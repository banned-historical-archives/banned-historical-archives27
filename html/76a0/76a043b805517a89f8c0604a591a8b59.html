 The Index to Photographic Exploitation Products is a guide to the contents of reports
 and memoranda produced by means of photographic interpretation. These are added to
 the Exploitation Products Data File (EPF) of the National Base of Image-Derived Infor-
 mation (NBIDI) when received by the National Photographic Interpretation Center
 (NPIC). The index includes imagery interpretation reports produced by various compo-
 nents of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence
 Agency, and foreign governments, as well as those produced by NPIC. At the request of
 COMIREX/NIDBWG, this publication is compiled and published monthly then
 cumulated annually by NPIC for the use of properly cleared components of USIB mem-
 ber organizations.
 Listed documents are on file in NPIC, and microfiche copies are available to re-
 questers when parent organizations are unable to provide copies. Information, such as
 bibliographies on specific subjects, is available from the EPF to answer requests which
 cannot be satisfied from the PEP.
 Requests for regular distribution of the PEP, for additional information from the
 EPF, or for microfiche copies of documents should be channeled through appropriate
 liaison offices located in NPIC. Organizations which do not have a liaison office in NPIC
 should submit the request in writing to NPIC/PSG/RSD/IB.
 25X1
 25X1
 The PEP consists of six indexes:
 ? Subject in alphabetic sequence.
 ? Originator in report type/number sequence.
 ? General category with subject in alphabetic sequence.
 ? Geographic coordinate sequence. (Geographic coordinates area listed where a
 single area is involved.)
 The accession number sequence may be referred to for complete information on
 each document, including edited abstracts. An asterisk at the end of an abstract in-
 dicates the abstract was prepared by the Reports Analysis Section. Selected infor-
 mation is contained in the other sequences. The accession number should be used
 when requesting microfiche copies of documents.

 IN LATE 1976 THERE WERE FOUR PLANTS IN CHEKIANG PROVINCE ENGAGED IN THE PRODUCTION OF IRON' STEEL. AND
 ROLLED STEEL PRODUCTS. THREE ARE PIG IRON PLANTS AND ONE IS AN IRON AND STEEL.PLANT.
 THERE ARE TWO MEDIUM AND FOUR SMALL BLAST FURNACES AT THE PLANTS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING AN
 ESTIMATED 1r120 METRIC TONS OF PIG IRON PER DAY. A SIDE-BLOWN CONVERTER BUILDING IS IN USE IN THE
 PROVINCE. IN AUDITION, THERE ARE FOUR ROLLING MILLS WITH A TOTAL ROOF COVER OF APPROXIMATELY 33#510 SQUARE
 METERS.
 CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY WAS EVIDENT AT TWO PLANTS. A SINTERING PLANT AND. AN ADDITION TO AROLLING MILL
 WERE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT ONE PLANT AND AN UNIDENTIFIED BUILDING AT ANOTHER. LI-CHIA-HSIANG IRON PLANT
 AND HANG-CHOU IRON AND STEEL PLANT WERE OPERATING WHEN SEEN ON THE LATEST AVAILABLE PHOTOGRAPHY; THE IRON
 PLANTS AT SAN-MEN AND WU-I DID NOT APPEAR TO BE OPERATING WHEN LAST SEEN.
 THIS REPORT SUMMARIZES THE PRODUCTION FACILITIES AT EACH PLANT AND PROVIDES AN ANNOTATED PHOTOGRAPH OF
 A SELECTED PLANT. A MAP SHOWING PLANT LOCATIONS IS ALSO INCLUDED. THE CUTOFF DATE FOR INFORMATION IN THIS
 REPORT IS OCTOBER 1976.

 THREE COMPONENTS BELIEVED TO BE PARTS OF MARINE REACTOR PLANTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM PHOTOGRAPHY.
 TWO OF THESE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE Y CLASS NUCLEAR-POWERED BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINES (SSBNS) AND ONE
 WITH THE SIBIR NUCLEAR-POWERED ICEBREAKER (AGBN). TWO MORE POSSIBLE MARINE REACTOR COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN
 OBSERVED SINCE OCTOBER 1973 AT SEVERODVINSK SHIPYARD 402, BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN RELATED TO ANY PARTICULAR
 CLASS OF SUBMARINE. THESE FIVE COMPONENTS ARE THOUGHT TO BE PARTS OF REACTOR PLANTS BECAUSE THE
 ARRANGEMENT OF OPENINGS IN THEM RESEMBLES THE ACTUAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE REACTOR PLANT COMPONENTS ON THE
 NUCLEAR ICEBREAKERS LENIN AND ARKTIKA.  (INFORMATION ON THE REACTORS OF THESE SOVIET ICEBREAKERS COMES FROM
 CLANDESTINE PHOTOGRAPHY AND OPEN SOURCE LITERATURE.) ADDITIONALLY, THESE COMPONENTS HAVE ONLY BEEN SEEN IN
 SHIPYARDS INVOLVED WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OR OVERHAULING OF NUCLEAR-POWERED VESSELS.
 NO INTEGRAL REACTOR PLANT COMPONENTS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO H. E, N AND D CLASSES OF SUBMARINES HAVE
 SEEN IDENTIFIED ON PHOTOGRAPHY. ONLY WORK STRUCTURES RELATED TO THE OVERHAUL AND REFUELING OF THESE AND Y
 CLASS SUBMARINES HAVE BEEN ANALYZED. AS NO U CLASS SUBMARINE HAS YET BEEN OVERHAULED OR REFUELED, LITTLE
 MENTION IS MADE OF D CLASS REACTORS IN THIS MEMORANDUM.

 TWO LARGE DOMES. DESIGNATED PUNCH BOWL ARE MOUNTED ON THE ISLAND SUPERSTRUCTURE OF THE SOVIET AIRCRAFT
 CARRIER KIEV. THESE DOMES PROBABLY HOUSE ANTENNAS FOR RECEIVING DATA FROM RADAR OCEAN RECONNAISSANCE
 SATELLITES (RORSAT). THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR TO,SINGLE DOMES WHICH ARE ASSESSED AS BEING RORSAT RECEIVERS ON
 FIVE E-II CLASS. ONE J CLASS AND THE 402K SUBMARINES. THE ONLY OTHER SATELLITE RECEIVER IDENTIFIED ON THE
 KIEV 15 PERT SPRING. WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH NAVIGATION SATELLITES (NAVSAT).
 NO RORSAT AND NAVSAT RECEIVING ANTENNAS WERE IDENTIFIED ON THE FOUR KYNDA AND FOUR KRESTA-I CLASS CGS.
 THE ONLY SATELLITE RECEIVERS ON THE TWO SVERDLOV CLASS COMMAND CRUISERS ARE THE NAVSAT ASSOCIATED PERT

 THE SA-8 IS A HIGHLY MOBILE, TACTICAL. SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE (SAM) SYSTEM. TWO ESSENTIAL. ELEMENTS OF
 THIS SYSTEM ARE THE SA-8 (GECKO) MISSILE AND ITS TRANSPORTER-ERECTOR-LAUNCHER.(TEL). THE GECKO MISSILE IS
 A RELATIVELY SMALL, COMMAND-GUIDED MISSILE WHICH WILL OPERATE AT LOW-TO MEDIUM ALTITUDES. THE TEL IS
 AMPHIBIOUS AND HAS FOUR MISSILE LAUNCH RAILS. AN ACQUISITION RADAR. AND A FIRE CONTROL UNIT MOUNTED ON IT.
 BECAUSE EACH VEHICLE IS A COMPLETE FIRING UNIT, THIS SYSTEM REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT DESIGN IMPROVEMENT
 OVER THE SA-4 AND SA-6 SAM SYSTEMS. THIS UNIT IS MORE EFFICIENT AND HAS IMPROVED SURVIVABILITY. AMORE
 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM INCLUDING A LINE DRAWING OF THE SA-8 (GECKO) MISSILE IS PRESENTED.

 SINCE 1970 THE SOVIETS HAVE DEACTIVATED 250 SA-2 SITES THUS REDUCING THE FORCE FROM A HIGH FIGURE OF
 ABOUT BUD ACTIVE SITES TO THE PRESENT FIGURE OF 550. A PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDY OF ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF THE
 SOVIET UEPLOYEO ACTIVE AND INACTIVE SA-2 SITES REVEALS THAT THERE IS GENERALLY MORE THAN ENOUGH EXTRA
 EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE LOCALLY TO REACTIVATE THE UNOCCUPIED SITES. THE STUDY DETERMINED THAT IN NINE OF THE
 ELEVEN AREAS STUDIED THERE WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH SA-2 EQUIPMENT IN THE LOCAL AREA TO EQUIP THE UNOCCUPIED
 SITES IN THAT AREA. IN ONE AREA ENOUGH EQUIPMENT FOR ALL BUT ONE UNOCCUPIED 'SITE WAS FOUND'AND IN ONLY ONE
 .AREA WAS THERE NO EXTRA EQUIPMENT. THIS DISCOVERY WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE A BEARING ON SEVERAL INTELLIGENCE
 ISSUES. IT APPEARS THAT IN A TIME OF RISING TENSION THESE SITES COULD BE READItY ACTIVATED AND INCREASE
 THE DENSITY OF THE SOVIET AIR DEFENSE NETWORK. THE POSSIBLE USE OF LOCAL RESERVISTS TO MAN THESE SITES
 WOULD HAVE A BEARING ON UNDERSTANDING THE SIZE AND STRUCTURE OF RESERVE MILITARY UNITS IN THE USSR. AND IT
 WOULD ALSO APPEAR TO BE OF SOME VALUE IN ASSESSING CONSTRAINTS--MANPOWER OR FUNDS--BEING FELT BY THE
 SOVIET MILITARY AND HOW THEY ARE DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM.

 COMPONENTS OF A NEW' CANISTER-LAUNCHED. SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE (SAM) SYSTEM HAVE BEEN OBSERVED AT THE
 SAM FIRING RANGE OF THE KAPUSTIN YAR MISSILE TEST CENTER. THIS SAM SYSTEM HAS BEEN UNDER DEVELOPMENT AT
 COMPLEX G OF THE SARY SHAGAN MISSILE TEST CENTER SINCE 1973. THE APPEARANCE OF THIS SYSTEM AT KAPUSTIN YAR
 PROBABLY MEANS INITIAL TROOP TRAINING MAY BEGIN SOON AT THIS RANGE.
 SEVERAL AREAS OF THE SAM FIRING RANGE WERE EXAMINED TO DETERMINE WHERE THIS TROOP TRAINING MIGHT OCCUR.
 RECENT MODIFICATIONS AND NEW CONSTRUCTION WERE OBSERVED AT TWO SITES. THESE WERE THE SAM R+D TRAINING
 FACILITY B--A FORMER SA-2 TRAINING SITE--AND AT LAUNCH SITE 0 IN THE SA-3 LAUNCH AREA. THESE TWO.SITES
 WILL APPEAR ALMOST IDENTICAL IN BOTH SIZE AND CONFIGURATION WHEN COMPLETED AND ARE THE MOST LIKELY AREAS
 FOR TROOP TRAINING OF THE NEW MISSILE SYSTEM. THIS FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT BOTH SA-2 AND SA-3 DEPLOYED SITES
 MIGHT BE CANDIDATE SITES FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS NEW SYSTEM.

 NORTH LAUNCH PAD IS PROGRESSING MORE SLOWLY. AND. BASED ON THE CURRENT RATE OF CONSTRUCTION. IT WILL NOT

 FOUR PROBABLE ABM LAUNCH SILOS ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT SARY SHAGAN MISSILE TEST CENTER (SSMTC). TWO
 ARE AT LAUNCH COMPLEX B AND TWO AT LAUNCH COMPLEX F. THESE SILOS ARE BEING BUILT WITH TECHNIQUES SIMILAR
 TO THOSE USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW (FOURTH GENERATION) ICBM SILOS (TYPES IIIF AND IIIG). THESE
 SILOS AT SSMTC ARE'                           IN AN EARLY-TO-MID-STAGE OF CONSTRUCTION. IF CONSTRUCTION
 CONTINUES AT A STEADY PACE THEY SHOULD BE'COMPLETE AROUND SEPTEMBER 1977. A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF THE
 SIZE OF THESE SILOS WAS MADE FROM THE COMPONENTS OBSERVED TO DATE AND BASED ON THE GENERAL TECHNIQUES USED
 TO CONSTRUCT THE NEW ICBM SILOS                        USABLE DEPTH OF THESE SILOS SHOULD BE ABOUT 25 METERS
 AND THE EXIT DIAMETER SHOULD BE                        ALTHOUGH THIS SIZE ESTIMATE IS PRELIMINARY.  IT IS CLOSE
 TO THE SIZE OF THE TYPE III-H ICBM SILO FOR THE SS-17 ICBM.

 A REVIEW OF THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF YURGA ARMAMENT PLANT 75 INDICATES THAT THE PLANT IS ACTIVELY PRODUCING
 THE FOLLOWING: A COMPONENT OF THE SS-17 ICBM LAUNCH-ASSIST DEVICE (LAD), COMPONENTS OF THE TYPE III-F
 SILO, AND A COMPONENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE TYPE III-X LAUNCH CONTROL SILO. LARGE EXCAVATORS PROBABLY FOR
 CIVILIAN USE, ARE ALSO PRODUCED AT THE PLANT. PRODUCTION OF THESE ARTICLES PROBABLY OCCUPIES MOST OF THE
 PLANT'S FLOORSPACE. THEREFORE, SERIES PRODUCTION OF SLBM, ASW, OR ANY OTHER MISSILE SYSTEM WHICH WOULD
 REQUIRE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF FLOOR-SPACE IS CONSIDERED UNLIKELY. THE PHOTOGRAPHY SUPPORTS THIS
 CONCLUSION AS NO EVIDENCE OF THESE WEAPONS WAS OBSERVED.

 IN JULY 1976 THE KRIVAK CLASS DESTROYER REZVYY. PHOTOGRAPHED UNDERWAY IN THE BALTIC SEA. WAS SEEN
 EQUIPPED WITH TWO LARGE SINGLE BARREL GUNS MOUNTED AFT. THESE GUNS ARE IN THE SAME POSITION AS THE TWO
 TWIN BARREL 76.2MM GUNS SEEN ON EARLIER KRIVAK DESTROYERS.   ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE KRIVAK DESTROYERS
 BUILT AT SHIPYARD STATE 820 IN KALININGRAD SUBSEQUENT TO THE REZVYY WILL ALSO BE EQUIPPED WITH THE NEW
 GUNS. THESE GUNS ARE UNLIKE ANY KNOWN TO BE CARRIED BY OTHER SOVIET SURFACE COMBATANTS.

 SUBMARINE. A TAIL SECTION OF A MISSILE THOUGHT TO BE AN SS-N-7 WAS RECOVERED FROM THE BARENTS SEA IN 1970
 AND ANALYZED UNDER THE PROJECT NAME CLUSTER VIOLET. THE SS-N-9 IS A SURFACE-TO-SURFACE NAVAL CRUISE
 MISSILE CARRIED BY THE NANUCHKA CLASS GUIDED MISSILE COMBATANT. UNFORTUNATELY THE SS-N-9 HAS ONLY BEEN
 SEEN TWICE ON PHOTOGRAPHY OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY TO PERMIT BASIC ANALYSIS OF THE AIRFRAME.  COMPARISON

 THIS MEMORANDUM IS A DETAILED STUDY OF THE CHUNG-CHING ARMORED VEHICLE PLANT 256 USING ALL AVAILABLE
 PHOTOGRAPHY AND COLLATERAL INFORMATION. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE ANNUAL PRODUCTION RATE OF
 CHUNG-CHING PLANT 256 AT THIS TIME' HUT IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE PLANT IS PROBABLY MANUFACTURING AS MANY
 AS 200 TYPE 59 ARTILLERY TRACTORS AND FROM 25 TO 100 TYPE 60/63 TANKS PER YEAR.
 THE CHUNG-CHING ARMORED VEHICLE PLANT 25o IS LOCATED ON THE SOUTHERN OUTSKIRTS OF CHUNG-CHING. THE
 PLANT IS ONLY ROAD SERVED. BUT RIVER PORT AND RAIL FACILITIES ARE LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 2 KILOMETERS TO
 THE SOUTHEAST. THE PLANT CURRENTLY MANUFACTURES TYPE 60/63 LIGHT AMPHIBOUS TANKS AND TYPE 59 TRACKED
 ARTILLERY TRACTORS. THE, SIZE AND ACTIVITY LEVELS OBSERVED WITHIN THE PLANT INDICATE THAT IT MAY ALSO BE
 ENGAGED IN MANUFACTURING CIVILIAN PRODUCTS.

 DETAILED PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS HAS SHOWN THAT THE UNIQUE RAILROAD CARS THAT WERE SEEN AT THE KURUMOCH
 ROCKET ENGINE TEST FACILITY BETWEEN AUGUST 1971 AND FEBRUARY 1976 WERE PROBABLE AIR COMPRESSOR CARS.
 APPARENTLY THESE SPECIALIZED RAILROAD CARS PROVIDED COMPRESSED AIR FOR THE TEST FACILITY WHILE A PERMANENT
 COMPRESSOR INSTALLATION WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. A PERMANENT GAS TURBINE COMPRESSOR PLANT WAS CONSTRUCTED
 AT KURUMOCH BETWEEN NOVEMBER 1970 AND MARCH 1975. THIS GAS TURBINE PLANT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN REPORTED AS A
 SOURCE OF HYDROGEN GAS AND AS A HYDROGEN LIQUEFACTION PLANT.
 DURING THE COURSE OF THIS-STUDY. A LIQUID HYDROGEN STORAGE AREA WAS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE TEST
 FACILITY. THE PRESENCE OF A LIQUID HYDROGEN RAILROAD CAR UNLOADING AT THE STORAGE AREA IN FEBRUARY 1975
 REVEALED THAT THE TEST FACILITY RECEIVES LIQUID HYDROGEN BY RAIL. AND THAT IT IS NOT PRODUCED Oro SITE.
 LIQUID HYDROGEN IS MOVED WITHIN THE TEST FACILITY BY A ROAD TRANSPORTER. AND ANOTHER TRANSPORTER IS USED

 TWO SQUARE PAIR RADARS WERE OBSERVED         ASSEMBLED AT SARY-SHAGAN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R+D)
 RADAR FACILITY 3                                         THEY WERE DEPLOYED ON CONCRETE PADS NEAR THE TWO LARGE
 PROBABLE RADARS 11VUbLU UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL COVERS AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF A RADAR CONTROL BUILDING. THE
 COMMAND GUIDANCE ANTENNAS FOR THE SQUARE PAIR DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ATTACHED, AND NO MODIFICATIONS WERE
 DISCERNIBLE. NEITHER SQUARE PAIR WOULD OPERATE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE CURRENT ORIENTATION (TOWARD THE RADAR
 FACILITY SUPPORT BUILDINGS), AND EACH SHOULD BE TURNED IN A NORTH-WEST AZIMUTH TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE
 SARY-SHAGAN MISSILE TEST RANGE.

 THE SOVIET BLACK SEA EXPERIMENTAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH STATION (CHENIS). IS A CIVILIAN OCEANOGRAPHIC
 RESEARCH CENTER. IT IS SUBORDINATE TO THE INSTITUTE OF OCEANOLOGY OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AND IS ALSO
 KNOWN AS THE SOUTHERN BRANCH OF THE INSTITUTE OF OCEANOLOGY. CHENIS IS LOCATED ON GOLUBAYA BUKHTA (BLUE
 GULF) BETWEEN NOVOROSSIYSK AND GELENDZHIK. ON THE NORTHEAST COAST OF THE BLACK SEA. IT SHARES BLUE GULF
 WITH A SOLAR RESEARCH FACILITY. CHENIS IS REPORTED TO CONDUCT A WIDE VARIETY OF OCEANOGRAPHIC WORK. THIS
 INCLUDES THE MAN-IN-THE-SEA PROGRAM, HYDROACOUSTIC RESEARCH. PHYSICAL OCEANOLOGY, SATURATION DIVING. AND
 EXPERIMENTING WITH MANNED AND UNMANNED SUBMERSIBLES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A WIDE VARIETY OF OCEANOGRAPHIC
 EQUIPMENT AT CHENIS. THIS INCLUDES TWO HABITATS AND TWO MANNED SUBMERSIBLES. TWO PROBABLE UNMANNED
 SUBMERSIBLES. TWO INSTRUMENT PLATFORMS, AND A POSSIBLE HYDROACOUSTIC DEVICE. IN ADDITION. CHENIS USES TWO
 LENTRA CLASS TRAWLERS IN SUPPORT OF ITS WORK..

 THIS STUDY PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF PROBABLE BURIED ANTENNAS BEING DEPLOYED AS A NUCLEAR SURVIVABLE.
 COMMAND/CONTROL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WITHIN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. CHARACTERISTICS OF BURIED
 ANTENNAS ARE DEVELOPED AND APPLIED TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA SYSTEM. AN ANNOTATED PHOTOGRAPH AND A
 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF EACH INSTALLATION IS INCLUDED.
 THE FIRST PROBABLE BURIED ANTENNAS WITHIN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA WERE DETECTED IN 1973 AT THE
 SUNTIEN INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILE COMPLEX. SINCE THEN. A TOTAL OF 38 SITES WITH 131 ANTENNAS HAS
 BEEN IDENTIFIED. OF THESE SITES. 16 ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AIRFIELDS. 8 ARE ASSOCIATED WITH
 SURFACE-TO-SURFACE MISSILE COMPLEXES. AND 1 IS ASSOCIATED WITH A MILITARY REGION HEADQUARTERS. ANY
 ASSOCIATION OF THE REMAINING 13 SITES IS UNKNOWN. EACH SITE CONSISTS OF ONE OR MORE BURIED ANTENNAS AND AT
 LEAST ONE UNDERGROUND FACILITY. THE ANTENNAS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE BURIED HALF-WAVE DIPOLES OPERATING BELOW
 6 MHZ. EMPLOYING EITHER SURFACE WAVE PROPAGATION OR SKY WAVE PROPAGATION. THE APPEARANCE OF ONLY ONE
 ANTENNA AT SOME SITES AND THE ESTIMATED OPERATING FREQUENCIES SUPPORT THE THEORY THAT THE ANTENNAS OPERATE
 USING THE SURFACE WAVE MODE IN THE MEDIUM-FREQUENCY RANGE. BASED ON THE SURFACE WAVE RADIATION
 CHARACTERISTICS. POSSIBLE CORRESPONDENTS ARE IDENTIFIED. FURTHERMORE..  IT IS SHOWN THAT A NUMBER OF BURIED
 ANTENNA INSTALLATIONS ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO THE NATIONAL BURIED CABLE SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM PROBABLY PROVIDES
 FOR PRIMARY COMMUNICATIONS. AND THE BURIED ANTENNA SYSTEM PROBABLY PROVIDES FOR ALTERNATE COMMUNICATIONS.
 A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH THE BURIED ANTENNA SYSTEM AND THE NATIONAL BURIED CABLE SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE A
 SIGNATURE FOR IDENTIFICATION OF UNDETECTED MILITARY INSTALLATIONS WITHIN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

 JONAVA NITROGEN FERTILIZER PLANT USES NATURAL GAS FEEDSTOCK FROM THE DASHAVA'GAS FIELDS TO PRODUCE
 AQUEOUS AMMONIA. NITROGEN AND COMPOUND FERTILIZERS. METHANOL.`DRY ICE. AND REPORTEDLY RESINS. ITS MAIN
 PRODUCTS INCLUDE AMMONIA. METHANOL. NITRIC ACID. UREA, AMMONIUM NITRATE AND`NITROGEN-PHOSPHATE-POTASSIUM
 (NPK) FERTILIZERS. AND POSSIBLY UREA AND MELAMINE RESINS.
 CONSTRUCTION OF THE FERTILIZER PLANT BEGAN IN 1962. AND IT HAS BEEN UNDERGOING EXPANSION EVER SINCE.
 PORTIONS'OF THE PLANT WERE FIRST OBSERVED OPERATING IN 1966. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1971 AND 1975, AN
 AMMONIUM NITRATE PLANT AND A NITRIC ACID PLANT, WERE BUILT AND CONSTRUCTION WAS BEGUN ON AN IMPORTED
 AMMONIA PLANT AND AN NPK FERTILIZER PLANT. THESE PLANTS WILL PROBABLY BE COMPLETED BY EARLY 1.977.'AN
 APPARENT EXCESS AMMONIA CAPACITY AND AN ADJACENT CONSTRUCTION SITE SUGGEST THAT ADDITIONAL FERTILIZER
 FACILITIES MAY BE ADDED 10 THE PLANT.
 TH15 REPORT INCLUDES A GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE FERTILIZER PLANT AND A TABLE SUMMARIZING ITS
 PRODUCTION AREAS AND THE VOLUMES OF MAJOR PRODUCTION BUILDINGS. THE TABLE IS KEYED TO A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE
 COMBINE.

 THIS PAPER ADDRESSES CERTAIN SENSITIVE ASPECTS OF THE USE OF U-2 PHOTOGRAPHY IN GUATEMALA DURING THE
 FEBRUARY 1976 EARTHQUAKE RELIEF EFFORT, THE DETAILS OF THE U-2 MISSIONS AND THE DISPOSITION AND
 UTILIZATION OF_THE IMAGERY ARE EXPLAINED IN AN UNCLASSIFIED REPORT (NPIC REPORT R-08/76).
 THE INSTANCE IN GUATEMALA OF THE USE OF THE U-2 ABROAD IN AN UNCLASSIFIED ROLE FOR DISASTER ASSESSMENT
 WAS PRECEDENT SETTING. THE REACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF 'GUATEMALA (GOG) AND THE WORLD PRESS WERE
 INFORMALLY NOTED TO ASSESS THE SENSITIVITY OF AN AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (AID) USE OF AN
 AIRCRAFT AND RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEM NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION. DESPITE THE
 HISTORICAL NOTORIETY OF THE U-2. ITS USE IN THIS UNCLASSIFIED ROLE APPEARS TO HAVE -CAUSED NO OUTCRY.

 THE U-2/IRIS-2 PHOTOGRAPHIC SYSTEM HAS PROVEN TO BE A VERY EFFECTIVE SYSTEM FOR DISASTER RELIEF
 RECONNAISSANCE. AT THE HIGH OPERATIONAL ALTITUDES OF THE U-2. THE IRIS-2 PANORAMIC CAMERAS CAN PHOTOGRAPH
 HUGE AREAS ON A SINGLE MISSION. THE HIGH-RESOLUTION BLACK AND WHITE IMAGERY OF THE IRIS-2 IS EASILY
 INTERPRETED WITH HUMAN RATHER .THAN ELECTRONIC RESOURCES. FOR THIS REASON LDCS ARE LIKELY TO FIND
 HIGH-RESOLUTION BLACK AND WHITE IMAGERY MORE USEFUL AND LESS THREATENING THAN MULTISPECTRAL. DIGITAL
 SYSTEMS.
 THE DATA PROVIDED BY THE U-2 IMAGERY PROVED ESSENTIAL TO THE DISASTER RELIEF EFFORT. THE IMAGERY
 PROVIDED THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF THE DISASTER AND ENABLED ASSESSMENT OF THE DAMAGE IN REMOTE
 AREAS. PHOTOGRAPHS OF.EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE WERE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL TO ADMINISTRATORS. PLANNERS. AND
 ENGINEERS IN THEIR RELIEF WORK. THE PHOTOGRAPHS ALSO PROVIDED THE US CONGRESS WITH A VERY GRAPHIC PORTRAIT
 OF THE DISASTER.

 DESNA IS A SOPHISTICATED MISSILE AND SPACE VEHICLE TRACKING SHIP HAVING AN OVERALL LENGTH OF 139.9.
 METERS AND A MAXIMUM BEAM OF 18 METERS. THE TWO DESNA UNITS ARE DEPLOYED IN THE SOVIET PACIFIC FLEET AND
 ARE NAMED CHAZHMA AND CHUMIKAN. THESE UNITS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED FLYING THE NAVAL HYDROGRAPHIC ENSIGN AND
 ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE A DUAL MISSION -- SUPPORT OF MONITORING MISSILE TESTS IN THE PACIFIC. AND A SUPPORT
 ROLE FOR MAJOR SPACE OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THEY PROBABLY PERFORM VARIOUS HYDROGRAPHIC/OCEANOGRAPHIC
 OPERATIONS WHILE ON LONG DEPLOYMENTS. THESE VESSELS ARE BELIEVED CAPABLE OF REMAINING ON STATION FOR A
 CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT REPLENISHING. BOTH UNITS SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME DEAD-IN-WATER WHEN
 ON STATION. BOTH DESNA UNITS ARE PRESENTLY HOMEPORTED IN PETROPAVLOVSK.

 ACTIVITY.   THIS REPORT UTILIZES ALL PERTINENT IMAGERY FROM THE CUT-OFF DATE OF THE LAST REPORT (8 MARCH
 1977) TO 8 SEPTEMBER 1977.   OF SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD WAS THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW 13.
 4-METER SUBMERSIBLE AT THE SEVEROMORSK NAVAL BASE AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF A PREVIOUSLY UNIDENTIFIED
 15-METER-LONG SUBMERSIBLE THAT IS CARRIED BY THE KOMMUNA ARSD AT SEVASTOPOL.  SINCE MANY OF THE
 SUBMERSIBLES ANALYZED HAVE NO KNOWN SOVIET NAME. THEY WILL BE REFERRED TO BY THEIR LENGTH.   IT SHOULD NOT
 BE ASSUMED. HOWEVER. THAT SUBMERSIBLES HAVING SIMILAR LENGTHS ARE THE SAME. SINCE MOST HAVE UNIQUELY
 DIFFERENT HULL FORMS.

 PRODUCTS INCLUDE AMMONIA, NITRIC ACID' SULFURIC ACID, AMMONIUM NITRATE FERTILIZER, STYRENE, AND
 POLYSTYRENE. AMMONIUM SULFATE FERTILIZER AND POTASSIUM NITRATE ARE ALSO POSSIBLY PRODUCED.
 THE COMBINE REPORTEDLY BEGAN OPERATION PRIOR TO 1941 AS AN AMMONIUM SULFATE PLANT AND HAS SINCE BEEN
 EXPANDED SEVERAL TIMES. DURING THE 1971-75 FIVE YEAR PLAN, A SULFURIC ACID PLANT WAS CONSTRUCTED AND THE
 EXISTING STYRENE AND POLYSTYRENE PLANTS WERE EXPANDED. CONSTRUCTION ALSO BEGAN ON AN IMPORTED COMBINED

 STANDARD GAUGE RAIL CONSTRUCTION IN THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA CONTINUED AT A HIGH LEVEL IN 1976.
 ABOUT 3x100 KILOMETERS (KM) OF RAIL CONSTRUCTION WAS OBSERVED, COMPARED TO THE 3,300 KM SEEN IN 1975. THE
 AMOUNT OF RAIL LINE COMPLETED DROPPED SLIGHTLY. FROM ABOUT 1x080 KM IN 1975 TO ABOUT 910 KM IN 1976. THE
 NUMBER OF ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, HOWEVER, ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 201 TO 294. RAIL YARDS, REPAIR
 FACILITIES. AND NEW RAIL BRIDGES ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE INCREASE. NOT INCLUDED IN THE RAIL CONSTRUCTION
 FIGURES IS THE 960 KM OF RAIL LINE BEING ELECTRIFIED IN 1976. WHICH WILL MORE THAN TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF
 ELECTRIFIED RAIL IN CHINA.
 CHINESE RAIL CONSTRUCTION DURING 1976 WAS CLEARLY DIRECTED TOWARD THREE GOALS:
 (1) TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF THE EXISTING RAIL LINES
 (2) TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND BRING ISOLATED AREAS INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY
 (3) TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
 EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF EXISTING RAIL LINES INCLUDED THE ELECTRIFICATION PROJECTS
 UNDERWAY IN SZECHWAN, SHENSI. AND HUPEH PROVINCES AND THE DOUBLE TRACKING OF THE TIEN-CHIN/CHI-NAN RAIL
 LINE IN HOPEH AND SHANTUNG PROVINCES. BRIDGE. BYPASS, AND REALIGNMENT PROJECTS OBSERVED ALONG EXISTING
 RAIL LINES IN NORTH AND EAST CHINA MAY BE EVIDENCE OF ADDITIONAL DOUBLE TRACKING. THE CONSTRUCTION OF 67
 RAIL YARDS AND REPAIR FACILITIES AND 42 TRANSFER AND STORAGE FACILITIES WILL ALSO IMPROVE THE CARRYING
 CAPACITY OF THE RAIL SYSTEM-
 PROJECTS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO ISOLATED AREAS WERE PARTICULARLY EVIDENT IN 1976. RAIL LINES WERE BEING
 CONSTRUCTED,TO ISOLATED REGIONS IN TSINGHAI PROVINCE (TOWARD KO-ERH-MU) AND TO THE REMOTE AREA OF WESTERN
 CHINA FROM TURFAN IN SINKIANG UIGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION. IN NORTHEAST AND NORTH CHINA, A RAIL LINE UNDER
 CONSTRUCTION FROM PEI-CHING TO TUNG-LIAO WILL OPEN UP A LARGE, SPARSELY SETTLED AREA FOR ECONOMIC
 DEVELOPMENT AND WILL PROVIDE 'A MORE DIRECT RAIL LINK FROM PEI-CHING TO THE NORTHEAST. ALSO. A RAIL LINE
 UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN SHENSI PROVINCE NORTH FROM HSI-AN WILL PROVIDE RAIL ACCESS TO THE YEN-AN AREA.-
 SUPPORT TO INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CONTINUED THROUGHOUT CHINA IN 1976. ACTIVE RAIL PROJECTS WERE SEEN AT
 160 INDUSTRIAL OR RELATED FACILITIES. AMONG THE MORE IMPORTANT OF THESE FACILITIES ARE TWO PETROLEUM
 REFINERIES'?THREE IMPORTED NITROGEN FERTILIZER PLANTS, AND SEVERAL THERMAL POWER PLANTS.

 TWO MISSILE SITES# EACH HAVING ONE SILO# HAVE BEEN UNDER CONSTRUCTION SINCE LATE 1975 NEAR LO-NING IN
 EAST-CENTRAL CHINA. THIS IS THE FIRST NEW MISSILE SILO CONSTRUCTION TO BE IDENTIFIED IN CHINA SINCE 1970.
 THE NEW SITES -- DESIGNATED LO-NING LAUNCH SITES 1 AND 2 -- EACH CONSIST OF AN EARTHEN APRON EXCAVATED
 INTO A STEEP HILLSIDE. THERE IS PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE THAT SILO CORING IS UNDERWAY AT BOTH SITES BENEATH
 LARGE SILO COVERS.
 WE COMPARED THE LO-NING SITES TO CHINA'S CSS-3 AND CSS-X-4 ICBM SITES IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHICH
 MISSILE SYSTEM WILL EVENTUALLY BE DEPLOYED IN THE NEW SILOS. NO FIRM CONCLUSION COULD BE DRAWN FROM THE
 PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE. BUT THERE ARE SOME SIMILARITIES TO SITE LOCATIONS AND SILO COVERS AT CSS-3 SILOS.
 WE BELIEVE THEREFORE THAT THE CSS-3 ICBM SYSTEM IS THE ONE MOST LIKELY TO BE DEPLOYED AT LO-NING.
 WE ALSO ATTEMPTED TO DETERMINE IF THERE WAS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LO-NING SITES AND CURRENT
 CONSTRUCTION AT THREE CHINESE MISSILE TEST CENTERS. WE FOUND NO PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF ANY SUCH
 RELATIONSHIP.

 (PBV) WHICH IS CAPABLE OF RELEASING UP TO THREE INDEPENDENTLY TARGETED REENTRY VEHICLES. THE SS-NX-18 HAS
 BEEN TESTED IN TWO CONFIGURATIONS. ONE VERSION CARRYING A MIRV PAYLOAD AND THE OTHER A SINGLE RV. THE MIRV
 1787
 TOP SECRET CHESS RUFF
 VERSION IS ASSESSED TO HAVE A MAXIMUM BOOSTER RANGE (NRE) OF ABOUT 6,500 KM CARRYING THREE 175-KG RV'S.
 THE SINGLE RV VERSION IS ASSESSED TO HAVE A MAXIMUM BOOSTER RANGE OF ABOUT 8,000 KM WITH THE RV PROBABLY
 WEIGHING ABOUT 285 KG. THESE RANGES CAN BE CONSIDERABLY ENHANCED BY USING THE PBV FOR RANGE EXTENSION. THE
 DEPLOYMENT PLATFORMS ARE BELIEVED TO BE THE SEVERODVINSK SHIPYARD-PRODUCED DELTA III CLASS SSBN UNITS.
 STARTING WITH WHAT WAS INITIALLY BELIEVED TO BE DELTA II UNIT NUMBER 5. THESE SSBN'S ARE CONFIGURED WITH
 MISSILE DECKS WHICH ARE ABOUT 1.0 METER HIGHER THAN THOSE OF THE FOUR DELTA II UNITS. THIS INCREASED
 MISSILE DECK HEIGHT ALLOwS, FOR       GER MISSILE TUBE,                         WHICH IS NECESSARY TO ACCOMMODATE
 SS-NX-18 MISSILE. THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT THESE UNITS HAVE A
 DROPPED KEEL IN THE MISSILE BAY AREA. THE FOUR UNITS OF THE DELTA II CLASS ARE BELIEVE  TO BE CONFIGURED
 WITH THE SS-N-8 WEAPON SYSTEM AND HAVE MISSILE TUBES
 THIS STUDY IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE SS-NX-18/DELTA III WEAPON SYSTEM WHICH
 IS AVAILABLE ONLY AT AN SI/SAO CLASSIFICATION. SELECTED SUBSYSTEM TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS ARE INCLUDED

 IN APRIL AND MAY 1976, A NEW PASSENGER SURFACE EFFECT SHIP (SES) WAS SEEN ON SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPHY ON
 THE QUAY AT KERCH SHIPYARD KAMYSH BURUN 532. THIS APPEARS TO BE THE VESSEL CALLED RASSVET' A MODEL OF
 WHICH APPEARED IN THE FEBRUARY 1977 ISSUE OF THE SOVIET SHIPBUILDING MAGAZINE SUDOSTROYENIYE. WE HAVE
 REVIEWED PHOTOGRAPHY OF BOTH KERCH AND THE SOSNOVKA BOATYARD, A KNOWN SES PRODUCING YARD' TO DETERMINE
 WHERE THE SHIP WAS CONSTRUCTED. WE CANNOT CONFIRM THAT THE NEW SES WAS PRODUCED AT EITHER YARD BUT BELIEVE
 IT WAS MOST LIKELY BUILT AT SOSNOVKA. THE SOSNOVKA BOATYARD HAS PRODUCED TWO CLASSES OF PASSENGER SESSr
 ZARNITSA AND ORION. WHICH ARE STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR TO THE NEW SES. THE NEW VESSEL IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
 ORION AND IS PROBABLY A FOLLOW-ON DESIGN. THE ONLY SESS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH KERCH ARE MILITARY
 RESEARCH VESSELS, AND IT IS DOUBTFUL THE NEW VESSEL WAS BUILT AT KERCH. IT WAS PROBABLY THERE FOR SEA
 TRIALS.

 TWO CSS-X-4/CSL-2 LAUNCH VEHICLES THAT WERE SEEN ERECTED AT SHUANG-CHENG-TZU LAUNCH SITE B-2 WERE
 STUDIED IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE IF THIS LAUNCH VEHICLE CAN BE ROTATED AFTER IT IS PLACED ON THE LAUNCH
 STAND.
 BY COMPARING EVENLY-SPACED, DARK STRIPES SEEN ON ROTH VEHICLES, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS AT
 LEAST A 24 DEGREE DIFFERENCE IN THE ROTATION OF THE TWO MISSILES WHEN THEY WERE ERECTED. THESE MISSILES
 WERE APPARENTLY EITHER ERECTED IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS, OR ONE, OR BOTH, OF THE MISSILES WAS ROTATED AFTER
 IT WAS ERECTED, NO EVIDENCE COULD BE FOUND THAT THE LAUNCH STAND OR THE LAUNCH PAD WAS DESIGNED TO ROTATE
 THE MISSILE. IT DOES APPEAR THAT A ROTATION OF ABOUT 35 DEGREES COULD BE ACHIEVED BY REALIGNING THE CENTER
 LAUNCH TABLE ON THE LAUNCHER BASE. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE CENTER LAUNCH TABLE HAS EVER BEEN
 ROTATED.*

 THE SOVIETS CONSTRUCTED 29 E-II CLASS GUIDED MISSILE NUCLEAR POWERED SUBMARINES (SSGNS) BETWEEN 1962
 AND 1967. EACH-OF THESE SUBMARINES CARRIED EIGHT SS-N-3 CRUISE MISSILES IN FOUR PAIRS OF MISSILE LAUNCH
 TUBES MOUNTED ALONG THE DECK OUTSIDE THE PRESSURE HULL. EIGHT OF THESE SUBMARINES WERE LATER MODIFIED
 DURING OVERHAUL. AND OTHER SOURCES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE SS-N-3 SYSTEM WAS REPLACED BY THE NEWER. MORE
 ACCURATE SS-N-12 CRUISE MISSILE SYSTEM ON AT LEAST TWO OF THEM. ONE IN THE NORTHERN FLEET AND ONE IN THE
 PACIFIC FLEET. IN THIS STUDY WE HAVE MEASURED THE ANGLE OF ELEVATION OF THE MISSILE TUBES ON SS-N-3 AND AN
 SS-N-12 EQUIPPED SUBMARINES TO SEE IF THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE WHICH COULD BE USED TO DETECT A CHANGE IN
 MISSILE SYSTEMS. NO MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND IN THE ANGLE OF ELEVATION.

 SHIPS WERE NEARING COMPLETION. ONE WAS IN THE LATE STAGE OF CONVERSION. AND ONE WAS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF
 CONVERSION- ESV SUPPORT SHIP IS A GENERAL FUNCTION WE HAVE ASSIGNED TO THESE SHIPS. BECAUSE THE FUNCTION'
 OF THE,LARGE ANTENNA THAT WILL BE CARRIED BY THESE SHIPS IS NOT KNOWN- WE HAVE'NOT BEEN ABLE TO APPLY A
 MORE SPECIFIC FUNCTION SUCH AS SPACE EVENT SUPPORT. MISSILE RANGE INSTRUMENTATION. OR COMMUNICATIONS RELAY
 TO THESE SHIPS. THE SPACE PROGRAM THAT THESE SHIPS WILL PROBABLY SUPPORT IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.

 FITTER AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED AT KOMSOMOLSK AIRFRAME PLANT 126 AND ARE NORMALLY OBSERVED ONLY IN
 THE SOUTHEAST PLANT AREA. THE PLANT IS PRESENTLY PRODUCING FITTER D, WHICH INCORPORATES AN UPGRADED
 AVIONICS PACKAGE.
 ALL AVAILABLE PHOTOGRAPHY OF KOMSOMOLSK AIRFRAME PLANT 126 FROM 1969 THROUGH'1973 WAS REVIEWED IN AN
 ATTEMPT TO DEFINE THE-TIMING AND DURATION OF THE FITTER B PRODUCTION RUN AND THE BEGINNING OF FITTER C
 SERIES PRODUCTION. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT SERIES PRODUCTION OF THE FITTER 8 MOST LIKELY STARTED IN LATE
 1969 AND ENDED IN EARLY TO MID-1973. FITTER C APPEARED TO BE IN FULL PRODUCTION BY SEPTEMBER 1973.
 PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE BEGINNING OF FITTER C PRODUCTION EARLIER THAN LATE 1972. A
 .TYPICAL FITTER ORDER-OF-BATTLE DERIVED FROM RECENT GOOD-DUALITY PHOTOGRAPHY OF SELECTED REPAIR, TRAINING

 TWO SMALL, VERTICAL TEST STANDS WITHIN THE USSR WERE EXAMINED IN AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THEIR
 FUNCTIONS IN.THE SOVIET ROCKET ENGINE TEST PROGRAM. ONE OF THE TEST STANDS THAT WAS STUDIED WAS TEST STAND
 4 AT THE ZAGORSK ROCKET ENGINE TEST FACILITY (RETF). IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TEST STAND 4 IS_ CAPABLE OF
 TESTING SMALL ENGINES' SMALL STAGES, AND IS POSSIBLY CAPABLE OF COLD FLOW TESTING OF LARGE ENGINES. A NEW
 TEST PROGRAM WAS STARTED AT TEST STAND 4 ABOUT 1971, HOWEVER, THE EXACT NATURE OF THIS PROGRAM COULD NOT
 BE DETERMINED-,THE OTHER TEST STAND THAT WAS STUDIED WAS TEST STAND 3 AT THE DNEPROPETROVSK RETF. THIS
 STAND 15 CAPABLE OF,TESTING SMALL ENGINES AT VARIOUS, SIMULATED ALTITUDES.

 A THIRD ELEMENT OF,THE V. N. CHELOMEY MISSILE DESIGN BUREAU HAS BEEN NEWLY IDENTIFIED IN THE MOSCOW
 AREA. THIS FACILITY IS KNOWN AS AIRCRAFT COMPONENTS PLANT 25. THE TWO OTHER FACILITIES KNOWN TO BE
 ASSOCIATED WITH THE V. N. CHELOMEY DESIGN BUREAU ARE THE MOSCOW GUIDED MISSILE AND SPACE RESEARCH CENTER
 REUTOV. AND THE MOSCOW MISSILE PRODUCTION PLANT FILI 23. AIRCRAFT COMPONENTS PLANT 25 WAS FUNCTIONALLY
 IDENTIFIED AS A PROBABLE DESIGN BUREAU BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVELY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FLOORSPACE THAT IS
 DEVOTED TO ENGINEERING/ADMINISTRATION. IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH V. N. CHELOMEY BECAUSE SEVERAL
 MISSILE-RELATED ITEMS OF HIS DESIGN HAVE BEEN OBSERVED AT THE PLANT AND BECAUSE OF THE PLANT'S PROXIMITY
 TO CHELOMEY'S MAIN DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE PRODUCTION FACILITY.
 THE EXACT FUNCTIONS,OF PLANT 25. AND ITS PLACE IN THE CHELOMEY DESIGN PROCESS COULD NOT BE DETERMINED
 FROM PHOTOGRAPHY. HOWEVER. THE APPEARANCE OF SEVERAL MISSILE-RELATED ITEMS AT BOTH PLANT 25 AND THE REUTOV
 FACILITY. SUGGESTS A CLOSE FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO.

 THE SOVIET UNION HAS BEEN EXPANDING ITS GROUND FORCE COMMITMENT IN MONGOLIA DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS.
 OIA BELIEVES THAT THIS EXPANSION CONSISTS OF ONE ACTIVE TANK DIVISION (TD) AND STORAGE FACILITIES
 CONTAINING THE TRACKED EQUIPMENT FOR THREE MOTORIZED RIFLE DIVISIONS (MRDS).
 THE SOVIET UNION BEGAN TO DEPLOY ACTIVE GROUND FORCE UNITS TO MONGOLIA IN LATE 1969. BY 1971 THEY HAD
 DEPLOYED ONE TD, ONE MRD AND SEVERAL SMALLER UNITS. NO CHANGE IN THE SIZE OF THIS FORCE WAS OBSERVED UNTIL
 THE FALL OF 1975. SINCE THIS TIME NEW SOVIET INSTALLATIONS AT THREE SEPARATE LOCATIONS IN MONGOLIA HAVE
 BEEN IDENTIFIED: MANDAL GOBI, BULGAN, AND ARBAY HEERE.
 THIS PAPER IS AN ANALYSIS OF THESE NEW INSTALLATIONS AND THE UNITS LOCATED IN THEM.*

 BETWEEN APRIL AND JUNE 1977 THE SYRIANS ROTATED THEIR UNITS IN LEBANON, REPLACING THE SIX BRIGADES THAT
 ENTERED THE COUNTRY IN 1976 WITH SIX BRIGADES FROM SYRIA. THIS INDICATES THAT THE SYRIANS HAVE NO
 INTENTION OF ENDING THEIR MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN LEBANON IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, EVEN THOUGH THIS
 ROTATION HAS CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED SYRIAN DEFENSES IN THE GOLAN HEIGHTS AREA.

 (PRC).THE QUAKE, WHICH REGISTERED 8.2 ON THE RICHTER SCALE, WAS CENTERED NEAR THE INDUSTRIAL CITY OF
 .TANGSHAN, ABOUT 150 KILOMETERS SOUTHEAST OF PEKING. OF THE APPROXIMATELY 3.8 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE AREA
 MOST AFFECTED BY THE EARTHQUAKE, ABOUT 6500000 WERE,KILLED AND 800.000 INJURED. SPURNING ALL OFFERS OF
 INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE. THE CHINESE BURIED THEIR DEAD' HOSPITALIZED THEIR INJURED, AND BEGAN RECOVERY
 OPERATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES INVOLVED ACTIVE PARTICIPATION BY THE PARTY, GOVERNMENT. AND MILITARY. THE
 CITY OF TANGSHAN WAS VIRTUALLY DESTROYED. ONLY THE HEAVY INDUSTRY BEING SPARED. AT LEAST 90 PERCENT OF THE
 HOUSING AND MUCH OF THE LIGHT AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY WERE REDUCED TO RUBBLE.
 AFTER THE INITIAL RELIEF EFFORTS. THE MAIN PRIORITIES WERE THE TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION
 NETWORKS.-TEMPORARY HOUSING WAS ALSO A MAJOR REQUIREMENT. IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE NEW DWELLINGS PROVIDE
 SHELTER FOR ONLY ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THE PREQUAKE POPULATION, A REFLECTION OF THE HEAVY LOSS OF SKILLED
 WORKERS EITHER KILLED OR INJURED AND EVACUATED. TO DATE ONLY THE ELECTRIC POWER. STEEL, AND SOME
 CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL INDUSTRIES ARE BACK IN OPERATION.
 THE RELIEF''AND RECOVERY OPERATIONS PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS OF HOW THE CHINESE WOULD
 REACT TO A LIMITED NUCLEAR ATTACK AND WHERE THEY PLACE THEIR ECONOMIC EMPHASIS. THE CHINESE RESPONSE TO
 THE EARTHQUAKE DISASTER INDICATES THAT THEY ARE ORGANIZED AND REMAIN REASONABLY CALM IN EMERGENCY
 SITUATIONS. A SIMILAR REACTION COULD BE EXPECTED IN A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE.

 THIS REPORT PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDY OF CIVIL DEFENSE ACTIVITIES AT 147 SOVIET
 INDUSTRIAL PLANTS. THESE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED PLANTS WERE SELECTED AS A SAMPLE FROM 12 KEY ECONOMIC
 RECOVERY INDUSTRIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO ASSESS THE EXTENT OF SOVIET EFFORTS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR THEIR
 WORK FORCE AND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES IN THE EVENT OF NUCLEAR ATTACK. THE REPORT IS PART OF CIA'S
 CONTRIBUTION TO AN INTERAGENCY EFFORT TO ASSESS THE OBJECTIVES AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SOVIET CIVIL
 DEFENSE PROGRAM. DEFENSE INDUSTRIES ARE BEING ANALYZED BY OTHER IMAGERY ANALYSIS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

 ANALYSIS OF IMAGERY OF KAPUSTIN YAR MR TEST COMPLEX C. SITE 1. GLADKAYA PROBABLE SSM RESEARCH AND
 DEVELOPMENT (R+U) TEST POSITION. AND DROVYANAYA MOBILE IRBM BASE it ALL IN THE USSR. HAS REVEALED PROBABLE
 ALIGNMENT/REFERENCE MARKERS WHICH APPEAR TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SS-X-20 MISSILE SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THE
 PURPOSE OF THESE PROBABLE ALIGNMENT/REFERENCE MARKERS HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. THE PRESENCE OF THE MARKERS
 AT TWO AREAS WHERE SS-X-20 LAUNCHES HAVE TAKEN PLACE (KAPUSTIN YAR AND GLADKAYA) AND NEAR DROVYANAYA
 MOBILEIRBM BASE 1. WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE A PROBABLE LAUNCH CAPABILITY, SUGGESTS THAT THEY ARE
 NECESSARY LAUNCH SITE STRUCTURES WHICH ARE BUILT NEAR THE LAUNCH POINT(S). IF THIS IS TRUE. THEN SS-X-20
 FIELD-DEPLOYED LAUNCH POSITIONS SHOULD HAVE SIMILAR SIGNATURES.

 THIS REPORT DESCRIBES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FLOORSPACE CONSTRUCTION AND PROVIDES AN OVERALL GROWTH
 PATTERN AT SOVIET AIRCRAFT DESIGN BUREAUS. THE DESIGN BUREAU. OR OKB (EXPERIMENTAL OR SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION
 BUREAU). IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF NEW AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS AND IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING
 OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS. DESIGN BUREAUS ARE HEADED BY CHIEF DESIGNERS WHO REPRESENT AN ELITE GROUP AMONG THE
 HIERARCHY OF SOVIET SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. MANY HAVE BEEN PIONEERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOVIET
 AVIATION. EVEN THOUGH SEVEN OF THESE CHIEF DESIGNERS ARE NO LONGER LIVING. THE BUREAU AND THE AIRCRAFT
 PRODUCED BY.THE BUREAU RETAIN THE NAME OF THE ORIGINAL CHIEF DESIGNER. FOR REPORTING PURPOSES THE-DESIGN
 BUREAUS ARE. DIVIDED INTO THREE CATEGORIES-LARGE (BOMBERS AND TRANSPORTS). SMALL (FIGHTERS). AND
 HELICOPTERS. DESIGN BUREAUS WITH DUAL FUNCTIONS ARE CATEGORIZED WITH THEIR MOST PROMINENT AND/OR CURRENT
 SYSTEM.
 THIS REPORT INCLUDES THREE LOCATION MAPS. NINE PHOTOGRAPHS. AND A COMPOSITE CHART OF DESIGN BUREAU

 A DETAILED SEARCH OF THE IMAGERY THAT COVERS A 5-NAUTICAL-MILE-RADIUS AREA CENTERING ON SIVERSKIY
 AIRFIELD REVEALS THAT-THERE IS NO ELECTRONICS EQUIPMENT IN THE AREA WHICH MATCHES THE POSTULATED PHYSICAL
 DESCRIPTION OR THE ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE. UNIDENTIFIED T8955/1031Z EMITTER. A ONE EYE AIR
 TRAFFIC SURVEILLANCE RADAR IS LOCATED AT SIVERSKIY AIRFIELD. AND A MODIFIED BAR LOCK AIR WARNING RADAR HAS
 BEEN AT SIVERSKIY AIR.WARNING RADAR FACILITY SINCE AT LEAST OCTOBER. 1976? HOWEVER. THE PHYSICAL AND
 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH THE ONE EYE AND THE BAR LOCK ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE T8955/1031Z
 SIGNAL.
 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE UNIDENTIFIED SIGNAL ORIGINATES IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE SEARCH AREA AT THE
 SIVERSKIY RADAR TEST FACILITY, WHICH IS LOCATED ABOUT SIX NAUTICAL MILES NORTHEAST OF SIVERSKIY AIRFIELD.
 THERE ARE TWO 15-METER-DIAMETER RADOMES AT THE RADAR TEST FACILITY WHICH COULD HOUSE THE T8955/1031Z
 EMITTER.

 DURING THE 1968-1970 TIME PERIOD THE IZHEVSK SMALL ARMS PLANT 524 UNDERWENT A MAJOR EXPANSION. THIS
 EXPANSION INVOLVED THE CONSTRUCTION OF BOTH PRODUCTION AND ENGINEERING/ADMINISTRATION BUILDINGS AND THE
 TOTAL AVAILABLE FLOORSPACE AT PLANT 524 INCREASED FROM ABOUT 58.800 TO 78x800 SQUARE METERS. SINCE 1970.
 ONLY ABOUT 4.200 SQUARE METERS OF FLOORSPACE HAS BEEN ADDED.
 THE 1968-1970 EXPANSION OF PLANT 524 WAS POSSIBLY TO ACCOMMODATE THE MANUFACTURE OF A NEW PRODUCT;

 THE SELDEVAYA NAVAL REPAIR YARD COMPLEX IS LOCATED ALONG THE SOUTH AND WEST SHORE OF SELDEVAYA BAY
 -ABOUT 20 KILOMETERS SOUTHWEST OF THE CITY OF PETROPAVLOVSK. IT IS A MAJOR YARD FOR THE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL
 OF SURFACE SHIPS AND SOME OF THE SUBMARINES ASSIGNED TO THE SOVIET PACIFIC FLEET. IT IS ALSO THE PRIMARY
 NAVAL YARD SERVING THE PETROPAVLOVSK NAVAL COMPLEX. THE MAIN PART OF THE INSTALLATION CONTAINS MAJOR SHORE
 AND BERTHING FACILITIES FOR SHIPS AND SUBMARINES. A SECOND AREA CONSISTS OF TWO FINGER PIERS AND A
 FLOATING DOCK USED FOR OUT OF WATER REPAIR. THERE ARE NO SHORE FACILITIES SUPPORTING THIS AREA. THE REPAIR
 YARD HAS BEEN IN OPERATION SINCE WORLD WAR II AND HAS BEEN UNDERGOING CONTINUED EXPANSION SINCE THE EARLY
 1960'S. THE EXPANSION HAS BEEN SYSTEMATIC AND WELL PLANNED AND HAS GRADUALLY. UPGRADED THE YARD FROM A
 SECONDARY,TO PRIMARY OVERHAUL AND REPAIR FACILITY. WHEN CURRENT EXPANSION IS COMPLETE. PROBABLY IN 1978 OR
 1979

 IN LATE 1976 THERE WERE THREE PLANTS IN FUKIEN PROVINCE ENGAGED IN THE PRODUCTION OF IRON. STEEL. AND
 ROLLED STEEL PRODUCTS. TWO ARE PIG IRON PLANTS AND ONE IS AN IRON AND STEEL PLANT.
 THERE ARE TWO MEDIUM AND THREE SMALL BLAST FURNACES AT THE PLANTS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING AN
 ESTIMATED 1.050 METRIC TONS OF PIG IRON PER DAY. A BASIC OXYGEN FURNACE (BOF) BUILDING AND A SIDE-BLOWN
 CONVERTER BUILDING ARE IN USE IN THE PROVINCE. IN ADDITION. THERE ARE THREE ROLLING MILLS WITH A TOTAL
 ROOF COVER OF APPROXIMATELY 22#980 SQUARE METERS.
 CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY WAS EVIDENT AT TWO PLANTS. A ROLLING MILL WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT SAN-MING AND
 A SMALL BLAST FURNACE,WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT FU-WEN. LUNG-YEN IRON PLANT AND SAN-MING IRON AND STEEL

 IMPROVED THE EFFICIENCY OF CEMENT PRODUCTION THROUGH THE CONTINUING INTRODUCTION OF ROTARY KILNS.   OIA HAS
 NOW IDENTIFIED 90 ROTARY KILN CEMENT PLANTS IN CHINA THAT CONTAIN A TOTAL OF AT LEAST 182 ROTARY KILNS.
 WHEN LAST OBSERVED. THLRE WERE 158 OPERATIONAL ROTARY KILNS AT 73 PLANTS.   AN ADDITIONAL 17 KILNS APPEARED
 TO SE OPERATIONAL AND SEVEN WERE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.   PRIOR TO 1970. THERE WERE 57 ROTARY KILN CEMENT
 PLANTS CONTAINING 114 ROTARY KILNS.   THE CHINESE HAVE ALSO CONSTRUCTED KILNS WITH CYCLONE SUSPENSION
 PREHEATERS AT SIX PLANTS.   SUSPENSION PREHEATERS INCREASE EFFICIENCY BY USING THE HOT EXHAUST GASES FROM
 THE ROTARY KILNS TO START THE PROCESSING OF CEMENT.
 SINCE 1970. 18 ROTARY KILN PLANTS HAVE BEEN NEWLY CONSTRUCTED AND 15 PREVIOUSLY EXISTING VERTICAL
 KILN PLANTS HAVE HAD ROTARY KILNS ADDED.
 THIS REPORT INCLUDES A TABULAR SUMMARY OF DATA ON THE 90 KNOWN ROTARY KILN PLANTS' DESCRIPTIONS
 AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF 13 RECENTLY IDENTIFIED PLANTS. AND A SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AT THREE PLANTS.

 THIS MEMORANDUM WAS PREPARED IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FOR A STUDY OF SCALEBOARD SIGHTINGS OUTSIDE KNOWN
 SCALEBOARD'ASSOCIATED INSTALLATIONS,,IT DESCRIBES IN DETAIL EACH SIGHTING TO INCLUDE DISTANCE FROM
 INSTALLATION. DISTANCE FROM THE NEAREST ROAD. TYPE OF ROAD SURFACE. TERRAIN. WEATHER. TYPES OF EQUIPMENT.
 DESCRIPTION OF TRAINING. AND OTHER PERTINENT INFORMATION.
 A REVIEW OF SELECTED SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPHY FROM JANUARY 1970 TO SEPTEMBER 1977 REVEALS 52 SIGHTINGS OF
 SCALEBOARD (SS-12) EQUIPMENT OUT-OF-GARRISON. IN MOST OF THESE INSTANCES ACTUAL FIELD TRAINING WAS BEING
 CONDUCTED. INCLUDING LAUNCH PREPARATION. MISSILE ERECTION. SIMULATED.FIRING, WARHEAD HANDLING' AND
 CAMOUFLAGE AND DECEPTION. FIELD TRAINING WAS OBSERVED AS CLOSE AS 400 METERS (M) TO THE GARRISON AND AS
 FAR AWAY AS 30 KILOMETERS (,KM). THE EQUIPMENT IN TRAINING WAS USUALLY 'LOCATED IN AN AREA OF FAIRLY LEVEL

 UNLOADING FACILITIES OR BERTHS BEING USED FOR GRAIN HANDLING, IT ALSO DISCUSSES THE EQUIPMENT AND METHODS
 USED At THE PORTS TO HANDLE GRAIN SHIPMENTS. THE STUDY WAS MADE FROM PHOTOGRAPHY OF VARIOUS DATES SINCE
 19.70p WITH MOST COVERAGE DURING THE YEARS 1973 TO MID-1977.
 EIGHT PORTS WHERE GRAIN HANDLING OPERATIONS INVOLVING OCEAN-GOING SHIPS TAKE PLACE WERE IDENTIFIED. THE
 PORTS ARE SHANGHAI' LU-TA' CHAN-CHIANG. TANG-KU' YEN-TAI' CHIN-HUANG-TAO, CHING-TAO. AND HSIN-KANG . ONLY
 TWO OF THE PORTS -- SHANGHAI AND LU-TA --HAVE MODERN GRAIN TERMINALS. THE TERMINAL AT SHANGHAI WAS
 COMPLETED IN 1975 AND THE TERMINAL AT LU-TA WAS IN A LATE STAGE OF CONSTRUCTION IN JUNE 1977.

 THE NAN-B IS AN INDIGENOUSLY DESIGNED, SMALL. SINGLE-ENGINE, SWEPT-WING. JET AIRCRAFT.  THE
 ROLE OF THIS AIRCRAFT IS NOT CERTAIN. BUT IT COULD PROBABLY BE USED EITHER AS A GROUND SUPPORT FIGHTER OR
 AS A JET TRAINER.  THIS WAS THE FIRST SIGHTING OF MORE THAN ONE NAN-B AIRCRAFT, WHICH INCREASES THE
 PROBABILITY THAT THE NAN-B MAY ENTER INTO SERIES PRODUCTION IN THE FUTURE.

 THE PRIMARY TRAINING FACILITY FOR SOVIET COSMONAUTS. FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO AS STAR CITY, IS LOCATED
 34 KILOMETERS NORTHEAST OF THE KREMLIN NEAR SHCHELKOVO AIRFIELD.  DURING A PERIOD OF EXPANSION BEGINNING
 IN THE EARLY 19705 AND CONTINUING THROUGH 1974 SIX MAJOR BUILDINGS AND SOME APARTMENT BUILDINGS WERE ADDED
 TO THIS FACILITY.   THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE SIX MAJOR BUILDINGS HAS A CIRCULAR CONFIGURATION AND WAS
 APPARENTLY DESIGNED TO HOUSE A CENTRIFUGE THAT WAS PURCHASED FROM SWEDEN.   MORE RECENT EXPANSION OF THIS
 TRAINING FACILITY DURING THE 1975-1977 TIME PERIOD. HAS RESULTED IN THE INITIATION OF CONSTRUCTION OF FIVE
 ADDITIONAL BUILDINGS -- INCLUDING A SECOND CIRCULAR BUILDING.  THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS SECOND
 CIRCULAR BUILDING SUGGEST THAT IT 15 DESIGNED FOR SOME PURPOSE OTHER THAN A CENTRIFUGE.  A,LIKELY
 POSSIBILITY IS THAT IT WILL BE A NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TEST FACILITY SIMILAR TO THE ONE AT THE MARSHALL SPACE
 FLIGHT CENTER IN HUNTSVILLE. ALABAMA.

 SOVIET DELTA-CLASS NUCLEAR POWERED BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE (SSBN) PRODUCTION HAS SLOWED
 CONSIDERABLY AT THE SEVERODVINSK SHIPYARD.   DURING PEAK PRODUCTION IN THE EARLY-TO-MID 19705. EIGHT
 CONSTRUCTION POSITIONS ON FOUR BUILDING WAYS WERE UTILIZED FOR SUBMARINE ASSEMBLY IN THE OLD MAIN
 CONSTRUCTION HALL.   IT IS BELIEVED THAT ONLY FOUR OF THESE POSITIONS ARE PRESENTLY BEING USED FOR
 SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION AND THAT THEY ARE ON TWO OF THE FOUR BUILDING WAYS.   THERE ALSO IS EVIDENCE THAT
 TRANSPORTER DOCKS ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED ON SOME OF THE OTHER FOUR VACATED CONSTRUCTION POSITIONS.

 ELECTRONICS RESEARCH INSTITUTE 340 WAS FIRST MENTIONED IN COLLATERAL SOURCES AND
 SUBSEQUENTLY WAS IDENTIFIED ON PHOTOGRAPHY IN 1972.
 THE. IDENTIFICATION OF THE TWO AREAS AS THE INSTITUTE IS BASED ON COLLATERAL INFORMATION AND THE
 PRESENCE OF THREE ENVIRONMENTAL DOMES? WHICH SUGGEST A RESEARCH INSTITUTE.
 THE.KUCHINO ELECTRONICS RESEARCH INSTITUTE IS 0.5 NAUTICAL'MILE(NM) EAST OF KUCHINO AND 11 NM
 EAST OF MOSCOW. THE INSTITUTE_CONSISTS OF TWO AREAS APPROXIMATELY 1.600 METERS APART.   BETWEEN THE TWO
 AREAS ARE AN EXTENSIVE RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX. AND EAST-WEST HIGHWAY. A MULTITRACK RAIL LINE. AND A CLAY
 PRODUCTS PLANT.      AREA A. THE NORTHERN AREA? IS BORDERED BY A RESIDENTIAL AREA AND A WOODED AREA.   AREA
 B IS BORDERED ON THE NORTH. EAST. AND SOUTH BY HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND ON THE WEST BY BROKEN FIELDS AND CLAY
 MINING.
 THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE TWO FACILITIES AS BEING RELATED IS BASED ON CO     ERAL SOURCES.  EXCEPT
 FOR.THE THREE ENVIRONMENTAL DOMES WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDED TO AREA A                       NO OTHER ELECTRONICS

 THIS STATION HAS PROBABLY BEEN ACTIVE_TO~A LIMITED DEGREE SINCE AT LEAST THE EARLY 1960SP BUT IN THE PAST
 TEN YEARS FACILITIES HAVE BEEN EXPANDED CONSIDERABLY.   THE MOST PROMINENT STRUCTURE AT THE TEST STATION IS
 A TWO-STORY,HUILDING WITH A LARGE INFLATABLE DOME ON THE ROOF WHICH PROVIDES A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT FOR
 ANTENNA TEST ACTIVITIES.   OTHER LESS ELABORATE SMALL TEST PLATFORMS ON THE STATION GROUNDS SUGGEST THAT
