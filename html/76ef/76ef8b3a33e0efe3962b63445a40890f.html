 UNITED KINGDOM  /._
 Discussions are under way between the
 British government and representatives of
 the International Monetary Fund on
 terms for a $3.9-billion credit.
 Prime Minister Callaghan could accept
 moderately stringent economic policy re-
 quirements but, given its thin parliamen-
 tary majority and the possibility of a
 revolt of the left, the government would be
 unable to accept or to enact harsh
 economic policy guidelines without risk-
 ing a confidence vote.
 Prime Minister Callaghan would
 probably accept:
 ? Controls on monetary growth and
 domestic credit expansion.
 ? Gradual cutbacks in public sector
 borrowing over the next three fiscal
 years.
 ? Reduction of public spending as a
 percentage of gross domestic product.
 The Labor government has succeeded
 up to now in persuading the unions to ex-
 ercise restraint in wage contract demands,
 but relations are becoming strained in the
 face of high unemployment, declining real
 wages, high prices, and skyrocketing in-
 terest rates. Callaghan believes that harsh
 terms for a loan from the Fund might be
 the last straw and could upset the alliance
 with the unions.
 The unions' cooperation has been a
 major factor in reducing inflation, cur-
 tailing strikes, and initiating steps toward
 halting some of the more extreme ex-
 amples of featherbedding in British in-
 dustry.
 Labor's precarious majority in the
 House of Commons is also being sorely
 tested by the opposition parties in the
 Commons  and  by  the  Conservative-
 dominated House of Lords. Thus far, the
 opposition in Commons has succeeded in
 gutting one bill, while Labor has gained
 passage of another by the narrowest of
 margins. Three more bills must be passed
 before the deadline on November 23, the
 end of the current legislative session.
 Tougher tests for Labor will come next
 spring-home rule for Scotland, the
 budget debate, and the vote that follows.
 The budget is
 austerity measures as a result of con-
 ditions attached to the prospective loan by
 the Fund. If Callaghan can work out
 terms acceptable to both the government
 and the unions, he will have a good chance
 of remaining in office through next spring
 and, with luck, perhaps even into 1978.
 ITALY     ' , ~,
 Prime Minister Andreotti last week got
 parliamentary approval  of some key
 austerity measures. On the critical ques-
 tion of how to limit cost-of-living wage in-
 creases, he avoided a showdown by referr-
 ing it to industrial and trade union leaders
 for solution.
 A favorable vote on Andreotti's
 package was never in much doubt; the
 major nongovernment parties, including
 the Communists, had signaled their inten-
 tion to abstain. Parliament approved in-
 creased taxes and public service tariffs
 that had already been decreed, as well as
 new measures requiring self-employed
 workers and businesses to pay 75 percent
 of their income taxes in advance. These
 and other measures should bring in about
 $6 billion in added revenue.
 Andreotti thus has parliament2&Xalnc-
 tion for his effort to reduce the
 government's deficit-one of the two
 main factors behind the country's persis-
 tent inflation. In extensive discussions
 with labor and management before the
 debate, however, he was unable to work
 out an agreed plan of attack on the equal-
 ly important problem of wages.
 Italian pay scales are tied by law to
 cost-of-living indices, and in the last three
 years wages have actually risen more
 steeply than prices. Some labor leaders,
 including Communists, have indicated
 that they might consider modifications in
 the wage structure, but they are reluctant
 to tamper with the so-called "escalator"
 mechanism itself-the more so as most
 workers regard the "escalator" as
 sacrosanct.
 Faced with labor's resistance and
 knowing that the Communists could bring
 down his government, Andreotti tossed
 the wage issue to industry and the unions.
 He told them to come back in a month
 with an agreed set of proposals. If they do
 not, he added, the government would try
 to attack the question through a cumber-
 some system of fiscal transfers and 2f.X1
 creased taxes, which the unions would
 prefer to avoid.
 Andreotti's challenge provides the
 Communists with an opportunity to use
 their considerable influence with labor to
 work  out  an  effective wage-restraint
 program and thus gain a large share of the
 credit should the austerity measures
 succeed. The Communists, however, also
 risk alienating rank-and-file unionists,
 which could further contribute to dissen-
 sion within the party. If they do agree to
 hold down wages, the Communists are
 sure to demand compensation in the form
 of political or economic concessions they
 can tout as evidence of their influence.

 WEST GERMANY
 US efforts to limit the spread of nuclear
 fuel enrichment facilities and reprocessing
 plants have provoked suspicion in West
 Germany and are likely to meet con-
 siderable resistance. West German in-
 dustry spokesmen assert that the US
 proposals are aimed at restricting enrich-
 ment activity to the US and the USSR.
 Government officials in Bonn probably
 consider this an overstatement, but they
 place a high priority on protecting the
 long-term interests of their nuclear in-
 dustry. The West Germans fear that their
 reactor sales would suffer if an inter-
 national agreement were to prevent them
 from offering a complete nuclear fuel cy-
 cle.
 The West Germans argue that the
 safeguards embodied in major German
 sales agreements last July with Brazil and
 Iran adequately address legitimate con-
 cerns about nuclear weapons prolifera-
 tion; they cite the Brazilian agreement as
 a model for the sale of nuclear technology
 in cases where the purchasing country has
 not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
 Treaty.
 The government views nuclear power as
 West Germany's major advanced
 technology industry. Over the past 20
 years, the government has invested about
 $6.5 billion in nuclear research and
 development.
 Its desire to develop a nuclear power in-
 dustry of global significance is linked to
 the question of jobs. Government projec-
 tions show that higher than normal un-
 employment may persist in Germany
 through the early 1980s.I
 The official policy on foreign nuclear
 sales has been a generally laissez-faire
 one. The government ostensibly requires
 an agreement guaranteeing the peaceful
 use of nuclear materials before approving
 export licenses. In fact, however, the
 government has allowed industry free rein
 in overseas sales. It has even facilitated
 contacts by including key businessmen on
 official visits to various capitals.
 In the future, the government may be
 forced to tighten up somewhat its
 procedures for nuclear sales, but it is un-
 likely to agree to any controls that will
 seriously threaten the potential of any key
 growth industry.
 FRANCE  16
 The French National Assembly last
 week approved increased outlays for
 defense, adopting a 1977 defense budget
 of 60 billion francs-about $12 billion at
 current exchange rates. This is a 20-per-
 cent increase over the 1976 budget; the
 real increase is about 11 percent after in-
 flation is taken into account.
 Operating costs have accounted for a
 growing portion of the  defense budget
 over the past two years; this year, they
 will absorb about 59 percent. A major
 cause is the pay raise ordered to alleviate
 morale problems in the military. Rising
 personnel costs will make it difficult for
 France to meet its long-term goal of
 reducing the percentage of the defense
 budget devoted to operating costs.
 The Assembly approved the budget
 after Defense Minister Bourges an-
 nounced that  1.3 billion francs for
 procurement of new equipment for the
 conventional forces had been added to the
 58.4 billion franc budget originally
 proposed. Opponents had criticized the
 earlier budget for putting, too much
 emphasis on paying off last year's debts
 and not enough on future defense needs.
 The 1.3 billion francs will allow the a~5X1
 force to purchase more Mirage F-1 air-
 craft, the army to buy French AMX-30
 tanks, and the navy to complete construc-
 tion of a support ship.
 The nuclear programs did not receive as
 large a share of the budget as they have in
 the past, but they retained their favored
 status, with emphasis on improving the
 quality of existing forces. Bourges told the
 Assembly that work will continue on the
 navy's M-4 submarine-launched ballistic
 missile and the S-3 intermediate range
 ballistic missile. He also said that by
 1980, the S-3 will replace the 18 older S-2
 missiles. The S-3 is designed to carry a
 one-megaton warhead to a range of 3,900
 kilometers (2,100 nautical miles).
 In addition, the current French
 nuclear-powered ballistic-missile sub-
 marine program apparently will be
 limited to five instead of six. submarines.
 The fourth probably will enter service
 next year, and construction on the fifth
 already is under way. France's sixth
 nuclear submarine evidently will form the
 first of a new class of attack submarines.

 USSR-YUGOSLAVIA !v , J ,
 The communique issued after General
 Secretary Brezhnev's official visit to
 Yugoslavia this week shows signs of hard
 bargaining, but the Tito regime is no
 doubt pleased with the results.
 To Yugoslavia, the key element in the
 text is Brezhnev's reaffirmation of Soviet
 promises made in 1955, 1956, and 1971 to
 respect the Yugoslavs' "separate road to
 socialism." The renewed promises by
 Brezhnev will probably receive wide atten-
 tion in the Yugoslav media. The Tito
 regime needs them to build popular con-
 fidence in the future.
 The communique described the at-
 Tito and Brezhnev meeting early this year
 mosphere surrounding the talks as one of
 "cordiality, mutual understanding, and
 mutual respect." The word "trust" that
 Tito permitted in the communique after
 his meeting with Brezhnev in Kiev three
 years ago was missing. The omission
 seems   to   reflect   Yugoslav
 wariness-revived in 1974 by a resurgence
 of pro-Soviet subversion-of the USSR's
 intentions toward Yugoslavia.
 Another basic element in the
 document-reportedly sought by the
 Soviets-is a mutual pledge to end
 polemics over differences between the two
 countries. The argumentative Yugoslavs
 may find it difficult to abide long by the
 letter of this agreement.
 The Soviets are undoubtedly pleased
 that the Tito regime agreed to expand
 party-government contacts and coopera-
 tion. Yugoslavia, however, managed to
 insert the word "voluntary" into a state-
 ment on the standards for cooperation in
 the communist movement as a hedge
 against imposition of Soviet views of dis-
 cipline in foreign affairs.
 The communique did not directly refer
 to military relations, but its broad phras-
 ing on  bilateral cooperation suggests
 the topic may have been discussed. We
 have  no  information  as  to  whether
 Brezhnev  requested  increased   naval
 access to Yugoslav ports.

 LEBANON  1
 Syrian units of the Arab peacekeeping
 force moved unopposed into Beirut on
 November 15, taking up preassigned
 positions on both sides of the confronta-
 tion line in the port and commercial dis-
 tricts. Similar units have begun moving
 into the Shuf region southeast of the city,
 and north from the capital to take control
 of the Christian radio station at Amshit
 and to open the road to Tripoli. About
 7,000 Syrian troops have been committed
 to securing the Beirut area.
 The Syrians have set up checkpoints on
 the approaches to Beirut in an effort to
 keep weapons out of the city and have
 begun arresting looters. Their main objec-
 tives appear to be control of the main
 roads, port facilities, and airstrips. Beirut
 international airport is scheduled to
 resume operations on November 19.
 A few thousand additional Syrian
 troops have apparently crossed into
 Lebanon in the past week to reinforce
 security units in the Shuf area and on the
 outskirts of Sidon. The peacekeeping
 forces are expected to enter Sidon and
 Tripoli by Lebanon's Independence Day,
 November 22.
 Although the deployment of these
 forces has gone smoothly, Lebanese com-
 mander al-Haj and his staff fear there
 may be a resurgence of Palestinian-
 inspired subversion and terrorism in
 Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon. Presi-
 dent Sarkis reportedly has already ap-
 pointed tribunals for Beirut, Sidon,
 Tripoli, and Zahlah to try cases of
 political sabotage.
 Palestine  Liberation  Organization
 chairman Yasir Arafat met this week with
 Lebanese leftist leader Kamal Jumblatt to
 discuss the provisions of the cease-fire
 agreement and relations with Syria.
 Arafat apparently is trying to arrange a
 rapprochement between Jumblatt and the
 Syrians. Jumblatt seems willing, but the
 Syrians, who are attempting to undercut
 Jumblatt, are likely to turn aside Arafat's
 overtures.
 Unrepentent Fatah hard-liner Salah
 Khalaf, meanwhile, has charged that the
 "conspiracy" against the Palestinian
 resistance is continuing. He insists that
 the fedayeen are entitled under the Cairo
 accords to continue their operations
 against Israel and to bear arms in
 southern Lebanon.
 The  Palestinians  reportedly  have
 moved large quantities of small arms. ar-
 tillery, and ammunition to Sidon, Tyre,
 and Nabatiyah to avoid having them con-
 fiscated by Syrian troops. The Christians,
 likewise, are caching weapons in their
 areas.

 WESTERN SAHARA
 As part of Saudi Arabia's increasingly
 active role in Arab affairs, Saudi Crown
 Prince Fahd has been traveling in Moroc-
 co, Mauritania, and Algeria since
 November I 1 in an effort to resolve the
 Western Sahara dispute.
 Fahd has met with King Hassan,
 Mauritanian President Ould Daddah, and
 President Boumediene. Fahd, who is ac-
 companied by Foreign Minister Prince
 Saud, will remain in the area most of this
 week. If the discussions are encouraging,
 the three North African leaders will be in-
 vited to Saudi Arabia for an all-out effort
 to resolve the Western Sahara issue.
 Saudi Foreign Ministry officials say
 that they have undertaken this diplomatic
 initiative because the success of the efforts
 of Saudi leaders with respect to Lebanon
 enables them to redirect their energies to
 North Africa, and because the Saudis
 allegedly believe that Algerian President
 Boumediene is now willing to find some
 solution.
 In any event, we believe the prospects
 for a negotiated settlement soon are
 remote. According to the Saudi account,
 Boumediene recently indicated that a
 settlement should respect the views of all
 parties, including the Polisario Front
 guerrillas, who are seeking independence
 for the territory. The Moroccans are un-
 likely to engage in any negotiations that
 give the Front a significant role

 BRAZIL Sd
 Once the votes are tallied nationwide
 from Brazil's municipal elections of
 November 15, the pro-government party
 will probably be far out in front. The
 country's leaders, however, will be closely
 watching the performance of the opposi-
 tion party. Earlier this year, President
 Geisel called the elections a national
 plebiscite for his administration, and his
 recent campaign activities have attracted
 broad attention to what ordinarily would
 be a minor political event.
 The official results are slow in coming
 in. The most recent news reports indicate
 that the opposition is leading in Brazil's
 major cities, where its political base is
 strongest. The pro-government party is
 said to be winning in smaller towns and
 rural areas. There is no question that the
 government will win overall as a result of
 its superior national organization, recent-
 ly enacted campaign restrictions, and the
 fact that the opposition was unable to
 field candidates in approximately 1,000
 smaller municipalities. The concern of the
 military-backed regime, however, is that
 its control of municipal offices may be cut
 from the 90-percent victory in 1972 to
 around 70 percent.

 Jamaica's recent efforts to round up
 new loans have fared poorly:
 ? The Organization of Petroleum
 Exporting Countries' Special Fund
 probably will not help.
 ? Canada last month promised $25
 million in short-term cash-part of a
 $100 million package, the rest of which
 is longer term project credits.
 ? The International Monetary Fund
 added $15 million this week.
 ? China refused a request for $30
 million.
 Rising private capital flight and the
 government's difficulty in garnering large
 new funds point to a payments gap in
 1977 that dwindling reserves would be un-
 able to cover. Manley's settlement with
 Alcoa last month setting an eight-year
 ceiling on bauxite taxes leaves little
 chance of help from a bauxite tax hike.
 The Chinese have publicly and
 authoritatively rebutted speculation that
 they might respond positively to recent
 Soviet gestures toward them.
 At a banquet on November 15 honoring
 visiting Central African Republic Presi-
 dent Bokassa, Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien
 lambasted the Soviets in such uncom-
 promising terms that diplomats from the
 USSR and its closest East European
 allies walked out of the hall. The Soviet
 diplomats departed during Li's attack on
 "wildly ambitious" and "criminal" Soviet
 actions in Africa, a popular theme in
 Chinese propaganda for several months.
 Had they stayed longer, the Soviet of-
 ficials would have heard Li, who is likely
 to become premier soon, accuse the
 Soviets of creating "false impressions"
 about a relaxation in relations between
 the two countries. Li asserted that
 Moscow's "arrogant demands" that
 China change its policy were wishful
 thinking and said the Chinese would con-
 tinue to carry out Chairman Mao's
 "revolutionary line in foreign affairs," a
 reference to China's opening to the US.
 Chinese officials seem to recognize that
 the USSR has had some success in por-
 traying its initiatives since the death of
 Mao Tse-tung two months ago as serious
 efforts to reconcile differences. The
 Chinese have been asserting privately that
 these gestures are not genuinely con-
 ciliatory, and Li's remarks are almost cer-
 tainly intended to dispel widespread
 foreign  press speculation about the
 possibility of a thaw in Sino-Soviet
 relations.
 Since Mao's death, Chinese propagan-
 da has remained vociferously anti-Soviet.
 Given the foreign press speculation about
 possible relaxation in relations with the
 Soviets, however, the Chinese apparently
 believed it was necessary to address the
 subject of the Soviet overture directly and
 in a manner designed to put this specula-
 tion to rest.
 It is likely that China finds little new in
 current Soviet blandishments. In any
 event, the Chinese are almost certainly
 disinclined to consider seriously the sen-
 sitive issue of relations with the USSR
 while they are still busy putting their
 domestic house in order and before they
 can assess the attitude of the new US ad-
 ministration   toward   China.
 JAPAN-KOREA-US
 The Japanese government last week
 mounted a public campaign to underscore
 its desire for a continued US military
 presence in South Korea-an effort that
 clearly reflects Japanese concern over the
 future course of US - South Korean
 relations.
 Over the past week or so, this theme
 has been emphasized in:
 ? A speech by Japanese Am-
 bassador Togo in Minneapolis.
 ? An interview given by the
 Japanese ambassador in Seoul.
 ? Remarks by Japanese Defense
 Agency and Foreign Ministry officials.
 Heavy Japanese press coverage and
 editorial comment reflect the apprehen-
 sion that relations between Washington
 and Seoul may be strained for some time
 to come.
 Public remarks by Japanese officials so
 far have not raised questions about the
 basic US commitment to defend South
 Korea. Still, the Japanese are clearly un-
 easy about the possible effects of alleged
 South Korean improprieties in the US
 and uncertain about the policies of the
 next US administration.
 In orchestrating this public effort, the
 Japanese are showing little regard for
 North Korean sensitivities about a con-
 tinued US troop presence on Korea. The
 North  Korean regime has reacted
 vigorously to each official Japanese state-
 ment on the subject and is giving heavy
 play to press accounts of alleged South
 Korean improprieties in the US.

 Most Israeli leaders think the outcome of the Lebanese
 civil war has weakened Israel's long-term strategic position.
 They are not sure what to expect next from the Arab states but
 are not likely to change their basic approach to negotiations.
 Israel: The Impact of the Lebanese Crisis
 Most Israeli leaders believe that the
 collapse of Lebanon's political system and
 the rise in Syrian influence in Lebanon
 will inevitably lead to a weakening of
 Israel's strategic position-if not now,
 then surely in the long run. Prime
 Minister Rabin's government has felt
 powerless to prevent these developments.
 It would concede that Lebanon could have
 rapidly become a much greater threat to
 Israel had Syria not intervened in the way
 it did.
 Israel's major concern last winter was
 that Syria might move without warning to
 impose a leftist Muslim regime in Beirut
 by military means. Such a step would
 have forced the Rabin government either
 to accept a fait accompli and face a storm
 of criticism at home, or to react by oc-
 cupying southern Lebanon and running
 the risk of triggering a wider Middle East
 conflict.
 The Syrians' split with the Palestinian
 guerrillas and their tactical alliance with
 the Lebanese Christians last spring thus
 came not only as a pleasant surprise to
 Israeli leaders but also did much to reduce
 domestic pressures on them to become
 more directly involved in the crisis. Even
 so, the Israelis remain wary of Syrian in-
 tentions.
 Palestinians, Syria, and nearly every
 other principal Arab state with Lebanon
 has resulted in:
 ? A virtual suspension of fedayeen
 terrorist raids on northern Israel.
 ? A relaxation of military tensions
 on the Golan Heights.
 ? A welcome breather from Arab
 pressures to resume negotiations for
 further territorial withdrawals.
 ? Until recently- a deenenino, of the
 split between Israel's two main adver-
 saries, Egypt and Syria, caused initial-
 ly by Egypt's signing of the second
 Sinai agreement.
 The Israelis believe their policy of
 "calculated restraint" toward Syrian in-
 tervention and their covert aid to the
 Lebanese Christians have also kept the
 growth of Syrian influence in Lebanon
 within acceptable limits and helped

 Organization.
 Syria has thus far carefully heeded
 Israeli warnings not to cross the so-called
 "red line." Syrian forces have generally
 kept well north of the Lebanese-Israeli
 border and have been used primarily to
 block a leftist takeover in Lebanon and to
 rein in the Palestinians-objectives that
 parallel Israel's own aims in many
 respects.

 support  has  helped the
 to preserve some measure of
 independence and, of more immediate im-
 portance to Tel Aviv, to gain control over
 part of southern Lebanon once used by
 the fedayeen to stage terrorist attacks on
 Israeli settlements in northern Galilee.
 ...And Possible Minuses
 Despite the pluses, the long-term con-
 sequences of what has happened in
 Lebanon are far less clear, and Tel Aviv is
 worried.
 With characteristic pessimism, many of
 Israel's leading press commentators have
 argued that whatever the outcome in
 Lebanon, it will ultimately be to Israel's
 disadvantage. They see Lebanon in-
 evitably slipping from its status of relative
 neutrality into the ranks of the Arab con-
 frontation states under the influence of a
 stronger, more aggressive Syria, and the
 closing of Arab ranks once more against
 Israel.
 Some Israeli commentators have
 already expressed alarm over the recon-
 ciliation between Egypt and Syria, expec-
 ting the Arabs, at a minimum, to shift
 their anti-Israeli propaganda campaign
 back into high gear.
 Foreign Minister Alton and Minister of
 Defense Peres, as well as other Israeli of-
 ficials, have expressed similar concerns
 about the future. For the present,
 however, the Israelis are not particularly
 worried about the presence of Syrian
 troops in Lebanon.
 Israeli chief of staff Gur recently dis-
 counted any immediate military threat,
 noting that the current division of Syrian
 forces between Lebanon and the Golan
 Heights puts Syria at a relative military
 disadvantage. The Israelis also know and
 are probably counting on the fact that the
 Syrians are likely to have their hands full
 for many months in Lebanon.
 South Lebanon
 The Israelis will continue to keep a
 close watch, especially on southern
 Lebanon, for any indication of a change in
 Syrian intentions. The Rabin government
 has already warned Syria publicly, and
 apparently through diplomatic channels,
 that it will not tolerate a resumption of
 fedayeen cross-border operations from
 territory under Syrian control.
 Israel does not under any cir-
 cumstances  want  the  Palestinian
 guerrillas to re-establish a strong presence
 near Israel's northern border. Ideally, the
 Israelis would like to see some kind of
 canton or federation system emerge in
 Lebanon that would leave: the south free

 of hostile Palestinian forces and in the
 hands of Christian and Muslim groups
 friendly to Israel.
 Consequently, the Rabin government
 will continue its so-called "good fence"
 program and its arms aid to Christian
 forces operating in the south,
 ? To encourage them to continue to
 look to Israel for support.
 ? To help them consolidate their
 hold over areas along the border from
 the coast to Bint Jubayl and farther
 north around Marj Uyun and
 al-Qulayah.
 ? To strengthen their overall
 bargaining position in the negotiations
 yet to come over Lebanon's future.
 The Israeli government will continue
 acting cautiously. Thus far, it has kept its
 military involvement in the fighting in the
 south to a bare minimum and has even
 denied its obvious aid to the Christians,
 presumably in part to avoid offering the
 Arabs additional reasons for uniting
 against Israel and in part to avoid giving
 the US reason to ask the Israelis to stop.
 Should the Palestinians decide to
 challenge the Christians' hold on this
 area, the Israelis would face an agonizing
 dilemma, especially if the Christians were
 in danger of losing. Defense Minister
 Peres indicated recently that Israel would
 do everything in its power short of open
 intervention to help its Christian allies.
 The Palestinians appear too weak and
 preoccupied with surviving to mount such
 a challenge, perhaps for many months. It
 is highly likely, moreover, that Israeli
 pressure, combined with Syria's attempts
 to exert greater control over the PLO, will
 sharply reduce if not eliminate the
 fedayeen  capacity  for  staging  cross-
 border operations from Lebanon.
 Beyond Lebanon
 Despite its transient importance,
 neither the Israelis nor the Arabs have
 ever regarded the Lebanese crisis as
 anything more than a sideshow to the
 main Arab-Israeli dispute. Tel Aviv has
 already begun to focus on what the Arabs
 are likely to do now that the war is almost
 behind them, and especially on the im-
 plications for Israel of the Syrian-Egyp-
 tian rapprochement.
 In general, the Lebanese civil war does
 not appear to have changed Israeli think-
 ing about Syria or the other Arab states in
 any basic way. The Syrian-PLO split has,
 at most, encouraged the Rabin govern-
 ment to believe that it may be possible
 eventually to reach a better accommoda-
 tion with Syria.
 Prime Minister Rabin still believes that
 the Arabs are not ready to make peace
 with Israel and that the best that can be
 achieved for now are more interim
 agreements.
 The Israelis are uncertain about the
 significance of the Arab summit meetings
 last month. Rabin and other top Israeli
 officials have indicated they believe that
 Syria, in exchange for Egyptian recogni-
 tion of its hegemony over Lebanon, has
 had to drop its objections to the Sinai
 agreement and to accept President
 Sadat's and the Saudis' approach to peace
 negotiations with its implicit reliance on
 the US as the catalyst for future

 agreements.
 The Israelis expect at a minimum,
 therefore, that the Arabs will push for a
 resumption of the Geneva peace talks next
 year and increase their pressure on the US
 to extract concessions from Israel.
 Beyond that, the Israelis are unsure
 whether the reconciliation between Egypt
 and Syria will result in a softening of
 Syria's position or a hardening of Egypt's.
 Before the Arab summits, Israeli press
 commentators and some senior Israeli of-
 ficials suggested that a stronger, more
 self-confident Syria might turn out to be
 more flexible in negotiations. They in-
 dicated that they did not expect Syria to
 end its close association with the PLO,
 but they speculated that Syria might be
 prepared to drop its insistence on direct
 PLO participation in the Geneva talks,
 now that that tactic has outlived its
 usefulness.
 More recently, Rabin has expressed
 concern that Syria, Egypt, and Saudi
 Arabia might put pressure on the
 Palestinians to abandon terrorism and
 moderate their political position in order
 to make it difficult for the US, and in turn
 Israel, to continue to deny the PLO a role
 in the peace talks. Israeli leaders especial-
 ly fear that the US might go along with
 such a move.
 Whatever tactics the Arabs adopt, the
 Israelis are unlikely to change their basic
 negotiating strategy. Rabin is no more
 anxious now than he ever was to move
 ahead  rapidly toward additional
 agreements.
 The Israeli government, therefore, will
 be ready to consider new approaches to
 negotiations, but will want to string them
 out. Time remains a valuable commodity
 to the Israelis in any future negotiations,
 almost as valuable as territory itself.
 Rabin wants more time to strengthen
 Israel's military defenses, to see whether
 the Arabs will live up to their past
 agreements, to test the sincerity of those
 Arab leaders who profess to be willing to
 live in peace with Israel, and to adjust psy-
 chologically and politically to shrinking
 security borders, if it comes to that.

 Soviet leaders apparently now think events in the Middle
 East will soon move toward a diplomatic showdown. They
 believe they must act quickly to avoid being left on the sidelines.
 New Soviet Efforts in the Middle East
 The USSR believes that the coming
 months may offer opportunities for mov-
 ing toward resumption of the Geneva
 talks. The USSR is publicly committed to
 a comprehensive settlement between the
 Arabs and Israelis and has stated that it
 cannot be excluded from the diplomatic
 process. The Soviets realize that the in-
 stallation of a new US administration
 could create a different diplomatic en-
 vironment that might pave the way for the
 Soviets to return to the negotiating arena.
 The Soviet proposal made on October 1
 to resume the Geneva conference was a
 reminder that Moscow intends to take
 part in any major diplomatic activity
 affecting the area.
 If the Geneva conference is reconvened,
 the Soviets could increase their chances of
 playing a significant role by improving
 relations with Egypt. The USSR is now
 making a fresh effort to explore rap-
 prochement with Egypt. The Soviets have
 also moved to ease the strains on their
 relations with Syria that were produce
 by the Lebanese war.
 The Soviets hope that Egypt is disap-
 pointed that it has not received more fro
 the US and that Arab opposition t
 Egypt's separate dealings with the U
 limits the possibilities for another roun
 of US-sponsored negotiations. Th
 USSR can also exploit Arab anxiet
 about the new US administration an
 Arab opposition to the recent US-Israel
 arms deal.
 Finally, the Soviets may feel compelled
 to act now because of Saudi Arabia's
 growing influence in Egypt and Syria and
 its contribution to arranging of a cease-
 fire in Lebanon. The Soviets undoubtedly
 believe that the Saudis are acting as US
 proxies in the Middle East and the
 USSR must be apprehensive about Saudi
 Arabia's success.
 Approach to Egypt
 The Soviet search for greater involve-
 ment in the negotiations in the Middle
 East has started with Egypt, the linchpin
 ?r erwiet efforts in the area for 20 years.
 During the past four years, Soviet-Egyp-
 tian relations have suffered a series of set25X1
 backs; President Sadat expelled Soviet
 advisers, terminated Soviet use of Egyp-
 tian naval facilities, and unilaterally
 abrogated the Soviet-Egyptian friendship
 treaty. Egypt's search for the good offices
 of the US in a series of Arab-Israeli
 negotiations has been particularly
 irksome to the Soviets.
 The USSR has also been concerned
 about Sadat's domestic policies. A
 political shift to the right has taken place,

 Arab Socialist Union have been purged.
 A parallel shift has taken place in the
 economic sphere, with some of Egypt's
 socialist institutions de-emphasized in
 favor of the entry of private Arab and
 Western capital.
 There is little likelihood that the USSR
 can dissuade Sadat from these policies,
 but for the first time in more than a year
 the USSR is trying to break the im-
 passe.
 Soviet  Foreign  Minister  Gromyko
 met with Foreign Minister Fahmi in
 Bulgaria on November 3 and 4 to explore
 The terse communique issued at the end
 of the talks, however, indicated that both
 sides were still wary of each other and
 possibly that the discussions did not go
 well.
 Egyptian Reaction
 How the Egyptians will react to these
 inducements is not clear, but the USSR is
 probably confident of a reasonable
 response. Soviet thinking may run along
 these lines:
 ? Cairo expects more attention
 from the US if the Soviet-Egyptian
 connection can be revived.
 ? The Egyptian military would
 favor a resumption of Soviet military
 deliveries.
 Syria
 Soviet-Syrian relations have been
 strained as a result of the prolonged
 fighting in Lebanon, and the USSR is
 likely to make the first moves to repair
 the damage.
 Moscow was clearly uncomfortable
 with the Syrian-Palestinian rift but could
 do little so long as Syria was pursuing its
 offensive and ignoring cease-fires sup-
 ported by the USSR. The Soviets made
 their case both publicly and privately
 against President Asad's actions but,
 despite Palestinian importuning, never
 applied decisive pressure on the S rians.

 Geneva Conference
 The Soviet call for a return to the
 Geneva peace conference is similar to that
 Moscow made last April, but the Soviets
 apparently now believe that events in the
 Middle East will soon enter a critical
 phase and that they must move quickly to
 avoid being left on the sidelines. The
 USSR may also believe that this time the
 chances of reviving Geneva are enhanced
 because:
 ? Egypt does not consider indepen-
 dent negotiations under US auspices
 as a productive option.
 ? The US has apparently aban-
 doned the step-by-step approach and
 accepts Geneva as the venue for com-
 prehensive talks.
 Moscow's Geneva proposal was
 carefully constructed to appeal to both the
 Palestinians and the Israelis.
 The USSR stressed that Palestinian
 attendance would be "on an equal footing
 from the very outset," showing its con-
 tinued support of the PLO's role.
 The only new element in the Soviet
 position on the Geneva conference is
 calculated to appeal to Israel-an agenda
 item to "end the state of war" as a key
 aspect of any eventual settlement. The
 stress on  "appropriate international
 guarantees" for Israel's existence and
 security might also be intended by the
 Soviets to placate the Israeli government.
 Moscow originally suggested that the
 conference reconvene in October or
 November, but Brezhnev in his speech to

 month pointedly avoided a specific time
 frame.
 The Soviets have one serious problem
 in their attempted revival of Geneva. As
 long as they support the idea of a peace
 conference, they will be partly responsible
 for getting the proposed participants to
 attend. This will not be easy for a number
 of reasons:
 ? Egypt ostensibly supports a return
 to Geneva, but as long as the
 Soviet-Egyptian  impasse continues,
 Sadat will refuse to close the door to
 US-sponsored diplomacy.
 ? Syria and Jordan have not em-
 braced the Soviet proposal.
 ? The role of the PLO is a major
 representational problem.
 ? Israel has already responded
 negatively.

 Jordan: The King's Problems
 King Husayn and other Jordanian
 leaders are coming under increasing
 criticism for failing to deal effectively
 with the country's domestic problems.
 Disaffection-caused mostly by a high
 rate of inflation-is especially noticeable
 among the East Bank, non-Palestinian
 population that has always provided the
 basic strength of the armed forces, the
 security services, and the monarchy.
 In foreign affairs, Jordan-which has
 almost no ability to take independent in-
 itiatives-is marking time. Jordan is slow-
 ly repairing the damage to its relations
 with Egypt and Saudi Arabia caused by
 its close ties to Syria, but has no effective
 strategy for dealing with its basic
 problems: Israel, the Palestinians, and the
 West Bank.
 Jordan's political and military leaders
 are not well prepared to deal with'the
 country's problems. Fortunately for them,
 these problems appear at present to con-
 stitute only chronic irritants. They do not
 seem to threaten Husayn's position.
 Prime Minister Mudhir Badran has
 concentrated on domestic matters sire X1
 his appointment in July, but his lack of a
 political base and his limited access to
 human and financial resources make it
 difficult for him to demand sacrifices
 of the people or changes in the govern-
 ment.
 Badran, moreover, apparently has only
 limited backing from the King, who is in-
 clined to concentrate only on foreign and
 military affairs. Husayn only recently
 turned again to Jordan's economic and
 administrative problems, which he has
 always treated on a sporadic basis.

 The armed forces commander, Sharif
 Zayd bin Shakir, is an able officer but is
 25X6      widely regarded as                too
 Westernized, and determined to acquire
 military hardware at the expense of the
 well-being of his troops. He evidently has
 been reluctant to implement plans to
 reorganize and reduce the size of the ar-
 my-steps necessary to improve pay and
 living conditions-lest he diminish his
 own power base.
 Most of the other high-ranking army
 officers, who generally are drawn from
 the Bedouin who predominate in the ar-
 my, are inept. They show no signs of hav-
 ing the managerial skill or royal contacts
 needed to deal effectively with the army's
 problems.
 Army Complaints
 Morale in the armed forces has serious-
 ly declined during the past year and is not
 likely to improve soon. Inflation has cut
 the purchasing power of the soldier's pay
 by half in the last two years. Despite a pay
 increase announced late last week, a
 junior officer is still paid less than an un-
 skilled construction worker.
 The pay problem has resulted in in-
 creased desertions and has prompted
 many soldiers to take a second job, which
 is illegal. It has also led an unprecedented
 number of officers and men to seek to
 resign.
 Although the level of military unrest is
 higher than at any time in recent years, it
 has not yet resulted in any open rebellion
 such as occurred in the garrison town of
 Zarqa in early  1974. Enlisted men,
 however, are now openly critical of the
 army leadership and, less frequently, of
 the King himself.
 There is no evidence that any group in
 the military is considering more radical
 forms of protest or a move against the
 King. Most army officers only want to at-
 tract the King's attention to their
 economic needs in the hope he will
 provide some relief.
 Among senior officers, morale may im-
 prove when the US-supplied air defense
 system is finally installed and when other
 programs to upgrade army equipment are
 implemented.
 Military commanders are hoping to
 provide regular salary increases to bolster
 morale over the longer term. This will
 require the negotiation of additional
 foreign financial subsidies, however, or a
 substantial reduction in the size of the ar-
 my. One plan under consideration aims at
 a reduction from five to four army
 divisions.
 The inflationary pressures that are
 hurting army personnel and middle-class
 civil servants are not likely to abate. These
 pressures result from world-wide inflation
 and the rapid expansion of the Jordanian
 economy. Domestic growth and the move-
 ment of foreign businesses and capital to
 Jordan from Lebanon have created and
 are likely to sustain inflationary shortages
 of labor, developed land, and imported
 goods.
 East Bank Sentiment
 A combination of minor political
 developments over the past few months
 has led East Bankers-middle-class urban
 residents and rural Bedouin alike-to
 question increasingly their customarily
 positive views of the King and his dedica-
 tion to protecting their interests.
 Conservative Bedouin leaders complain
 that their legal prerogatives have been
 reduced by the establishment of modern
 courts, and that they are not adequately
 represented in high government and army
 posts. In fact, the current cabinet does not
 include any spokesman for Bedouin
 interests, and the Bedouin lost their high-
 est ranking representative in the army
 through his forced retirement early this
 year.
 East Bankers also are upset over the
 lifestyle of the King, his family, and his
 advisers.  Religious conservatives, who
 complain about the royal family's Wester-
 nized, jet-set behavior, were offended by
 the fact that Husayn was abroad for most
 of the recent month of Ramadan.
 More sophisticated middle-class urban
 residents are also critical of the royal
 family and its hangers-on. The middle
 class, which customarily has been a prin-
 cipal recipient of civil service and other
 government benefits, is now alarmed and
 envious that full employment, increasing
 land prices, and widespread corruption
 have made unskilled workers and the up-
 per classes the chief beneficiaries of Jor-
 dan's rapidly growing economy.
 The Palestinians
 In public, King Husayn has consistently
 affirmed Jordan's adherence to the deci-
 sion of the Arab summit in Rabat in 1974
 that the Palestine Liberation Organiza-
 tion is the sole legitimate representative of
 the Palestinians. This stand has quieted
 the previously intense debate about the
 rights of the Palestinian majority on Jor-

 dan's East Bank by inhibiting independent
 Palestinian political activity in Jordan.
 The King's nominal concession of the
 Israeli-occupied West Bank to the
 Palestinians, where they constitute vir-
 tually all of the Arab population, has had
 its greatest impact on Jordan's domestic
 politics. The King has used this conces-
 sion to clear the way for increased
 Hashemite-Bedouin political dominance
 on the East Bank. Although Palestinians
 are alloted a quota of portfolios in the
 Jordanian cabinet, are heavily represented
 in the civil service, and serve in increasing
 numbers in the army, the King has made
 clear that there is no room for the
 organized  pursuit  of  Palestinian
 nationalism in Jordan.
 The Palestinians also have been in-
 timidated by Jordan's support of Syria's
 involvement in the Lebanese conflict.
 Several  prominent members of the
 Palestinian community in Amman were
 arrested last summer  following their
 public criticism of Syria's military moves
 against Palestinian forces in Lebanon.
 Husayn's success in keeping the Palesti-
 nian issue quiet is a major domestic vic-
 tory. Palestinian nationalism represents
 the greatest long-term threat to the
 Hashemite monarchy.
 Manifestations of East Bank - Palesti-
 nian rivalry are likely to surface again in
 Jordan's domestic politics whenever Jor-
 dan and the Palestinians are called on to
 participate in-or stand aside for-a new
 round of general Middle East peace
 negotiations.
 Peace Talks
 Husayn's public position is that he will
 participate in a new round of negotiations
 if asked to do so by the parties already in-
 volved. He says he will do so only as a
 spokesman for a confrontation state,
 however, and not as an aspirant for con-
 trol of the West Bank.
 Despite this stand, Husayn probably
 continues to view the future of the West
 Bank as bound up with that of Jordan. He
 would still like to see the two banks of the
 Jordan reunited in a federation in which
 the Palestinians would play an
 autonomous but subservient role. The two
 areas even now are joined by commercial
 and family ties.
 Officially, Jordanian spokesmen show
 no interest in occasional statements by the
 Israelis that Jordan must be involved in
 any negotiations on the future disposition
 of the West Bank. Privately, however, the
 Jordanians probably welcome such
 statements. They continue to take
 cautious steps to protect or enhance their
 limited political influence in the area.
 Jordan's West Bank policy is im-
 plemented by the activist minister of
 culture and information, Adrian Abu Aw-
 dah, who acts as prime minister when
 Badran travels outside Jordan. Awdah
 works to preserve Amman's ties to
 selected West Bank officials and at the
 same time attempts to undercut the
 appeal of the current PLO leadership in
 the area.
 Awdah's success will be limited both by
 Jordan's lack of substantial funds to dis-
 tribute on the West Bank and by the
 reluctance of the more nationalistic group
 of West Bank mayors elected last spring
 to be seen cooperating with the Jordanian
 government.
 Arab Relations
 Jordanian officials are uneasy that they
 played no significant role in the in-
 ter-Arab talks that led to the current
 cease-fire in Lebanon. They are none-
 theless relieved that Syria and Egypt
 have at least temporarily reconciled their
 differences. Amman's consistent backing
 of Syria had led to serious strains in Jor-
 dan's relations with both Egypt and Saudi
 Arabia.
 Husayn seeks as a matter of principle
 to temper his close association with Syria
 by maintaining good relations with Egypt
 and the conservative Persian Gulf states.
 This has been facilitated in recent months
 by the removal of the pro-Syrian former
 prime minister, Zayd Rifai, and by the
 successful negotiation of Saudi funding
 for a US-supplied air defense system for
 Jordan.
 Prime Minister Badran is much less
 enthusiastic than his predecessor about
 the merits of Jordan's recently developed
 military  and  economic  cooperation
 arrangements with Syria, but he has made
 no attempt to terminate them. With
 foreign affairs even more firmly in the
 King's hands, relations with Syria are
 likely to continue essentially unchanged
 for the foreseeable future.
 Jordan's involvement in Lebanon has
 been limited. Husayn probably would be
 willing to contribute limited numbers of
 Jordanian troops to the Arab peacekeep-
 ing force in Lebanon, but he is not likely
 to be asked, as this would be unacceptable
 to the Palestinians                  5X1

 The new Soviet five-year plan has relatively modest goals.
 Even so, prospects are not good for their fulftllment.
 -b5
 USSR: Five- Year Plan
 a
 The Soviet economy has not regained
 the momentum it lost because of the crop
 disaster last year. Even the improvement
 the Soviets expect next year probably will
 not get the economy back on the schedule
 established by the tenth five-year plan
 (1976-1980).
 The five-year plan was nevertheless for-
 mally ratified by the Supreme Soviet and
 a party plenum in late October virtually
 unchanged from the version presented to
 the 25th Party Congress last March.
 Although the plan goals are relatively un-
 ambitious, the prospects for fulfillment
 are not good.
 A 3-percent growth in gross national
 product is projected for 1976, compared
 with the planned average annual growth
 of 5 percent for 1976 to 1980. Industrial
 production grew by an estimated 4 per-
 cent during the January to September
 period-the lowest rate since World War
 II-largely due to a decline in processed
 food production, which is suffering from
 last year's harvest shortfall.
 The estimate for a low GNP growth
 rate this year also rests on a projected
 1-percent growth in total farm output.
 Although the harvest-particularly of
 grains-was good, livestock production
 is likely to drop by 13.5 percent.
 A Slow Start
 Few details of the 1977 plan were dis-
 closed last month, but most goals seem
 surprisingly modest in view of the fact
 that the economy will be bolstered by a
 good supply of agricultural raw materials.
 The growth rate planned in 1977 for in-
 dustry, for example, is only 5.6 percent
 compared with the average annual rate of
 6.5 percent projected in the five-year plan.
 Given the slow start in 1976, the Soviets
 must sustain high rates of growth
 throughout the remainder of the five years
 if the 1980 targets are to be met. Industry
 would have to grow by an annual average
 rate of almost 7 percent and agriculture
 by more than 6.5 percent in 1977 to 1980,
 Both rates exceed the Soviet record since
 1970 and seem beyond reasonable expec-
 tations.
 The final version of the five-year plan
 leaves intact the main thrust of the version
 released in March:
 ? Relatively rapid industrial
 growth.
 ? Ambitious farm targets backed by
 a large allocation of resources.
 ? Continued pledges to the con-
 sumer.
 ? Slower growth in new investment
 with emphasis on completing old pro-
 jects.
 ? Stress on increasing productivity.
 The final goals for consumer goods out-
 put, industrial materials, agricultural out-
 put, and investment are at the upper end
 of the range given to the party congress
 last March. A few targets are at the lower
 end, particularly those for total industrial
 output and producer goods. Only the
 labor productivity goal falls below the
 original target. The lowering of this goal
 is particularly ominous for the Soviets
 since they must now depend largely on in-
 creases in productivity for growth.
 A Forceful Presentation
 General Secretary Brezhnev's unusual-
 ly frank and forceful presentation of the
 plan to the party plenum identified the
 areas most crucial for the plan's success
 as agriculture, investment, and produc-
 tivity. While indicating that the economy
 was not doing particularly well in these
 areas, his tone was optimistic.
 According to Brezhnev, the most press-
 ing task in 1976 to 1980 is to improve the
 performance of agriculture. In a rare
 acknowledgment of the close competition
 for resources, he called the investment
 allocation to this sector "a tremendous
 sum" that necessitated "curtailing some
 of the requirements of other branches of
 the economy."
 Brezhnev said that neglect of the con-
 sumer sector by production and planning
 organizations would not be tolerated. He
 called for "achieving breakthroughs in the
 entire sphere of consumer goods output
 and services," identifying the satisfaction
 of consumer demands as a major prere-
 quisite to the success of the five-year plan.
 Although acknowledging the looming
 labor shortage, Brezhnev offered no
 solutions other than a general appeal for a
 more rational use of labor.
 The latest industrial investment figures
 show that most funds will continue to go
 into those sectors that are deemed impor-
 tant to scientific and technical
 progress-chemicals,  petroleum,
 metallurgy, electronics, and the heavy
 machine building industries. Brezhnev
 called the implementation of the invest-
 ment program "probably the central
 problem" and admitted the difficulties of
 achieving a large boost in the stock of
 plant and equipment with minimal invest-
 ment funds. He promised adoption of new
 measures to speed up the process of com-
 pleting unfinished construction  ro.ects.
