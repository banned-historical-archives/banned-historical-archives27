 -1r5-to .
 SIR: As you are aware, the Central Intelligence
 Agency seldom responds to criticism of any sort. It
 cannot remain silent, however, when a newspaper with
 The Star's a that on prints an article alleging that this
 aggencytlppos the heroin traffic in Southeast Asia. I
 re 6r to the column by Judith Randal in The Star of 29
 June.
 So serious a charge should be made only on the
 basis of the most convincing evidence. Miss Randal
 states only that "reporters have been hearing for more
 than ,a year" and then refers to an article in Harper's
 magazine by a graduate student, Alfred W. McCoy.
 Charges of this nature have been made previously
 and each time have been most carefully investigated
 and found to be unsubstantiated. The public record on
 this sub'ect is clear. There is, for instance, a report by
 Roland Pauli investigator for the Senate Foreign Rela-
 tions _ Committee, in the April 1971 issue of Foreign
 Affai-s, which states: ".   due to the long association
 with the CIA, the'Meo tribesmen in Laos'were shifting
 from opium to rice and other crops.
 The Congressional Record of June 2, 1971, printed a
 letter from John E. Ingersoll, director of the Bureau of
 Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, to Representative
 Charles S. Gubser of California, which states: "Actual-
 ly, CIA has for some time been this bureau's strongest
 partner in identifying foreign sources and routes of
 Illegal trade in narcotics. Their help has included both
 direct support in intelligence collection, as well as in
 intelligence analysis and production. Liaison between
 our two agencies is close and constant in matters of
 mutual interest.Much of the progress we are now
 making in identifying overseas narcotics traffic can, in
 fact, be attributed to CIA cooperation."
 Miss Randal's article is also in contrast to the two
 articles by your staff writer, Miriam Ottenberg, on
 June I
 8 and 19, 1972, in which she pointed out: "U.S.
 narcotics agents are making a sizable dent in the
 Southeast Asian dope traffic and-despite reports to
 the contrary - America's Asian allies and the CIA are
 helping them do it" And she quoted John Warner of the
 Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs as saying,
 "he had seen nothing of an evidentiary nature from Mr.
 McCoy `other than gossip, conjecture and old history'."
 Narcotics addiction is one of this country's most
 serious social problems. The Central Intelligence Agen-
 cy is dedicated to eradicating this menace and, specifi-
 cally, to interdicting the flow of narcotics entering this
 country.
 It is difficult to understand why a writer would
 publish material tending to undermine confidence in this
 effort withqut the most convincing proof. More than one
 year ago, in an address before the American Society of
 Newspaper Editors, Richard Helms, director of Central
 Intelligence, stated: "There is the arrant nonsense, for
 example, that the Central Intelligence Agency is some-
 how involved in the world drug traffic. We are not. As
 fathers, we are as concerned about the lives of our
 children and grandchildren as are all of you. As an
 agency, in fact, we are heavily engaged in tracing the
 foreign roots of the drug traffic for the Bureau of
 Narcotics ans J?p erous Dru s. We hope we are help-
 ollution; w   a we are not contributing to
 ing with a s
 the problem
 ."

 In our own country, we stand in greater
 need of what we call conscience. Order is
 Heaven's first law; the Universe, with the
 infinity of celestial bodies, is regulated by
 law and maintained in order. The human
 creature on our own planet-as well as those
 which may inhabit any like orbs-is en-
 dowed with the faculty of reason; with faith,
 that is to say, reasoned hope; with the belief
 of the pure in heart that the soul shall have
 immortal being.
 "Hats off to the past, and coats off to the
 future," must yet be the homely slogan.
 I believe that mirth and music are mate-
 rial gifts from Heaven to Man, in compensa-
 tion for the tragedies of life. Good thought
 and conduct constitute good morals. Evil is
 the exact opposite. If we transgress, we are
 punished, in one way or another.
 All the qualities of humanity that are pos-
 sessed of hope, faith, courage, diligence, rea-
 son, love of home and country, vision and
 noble ideals, must be exercised as indispen-
 sable labors in humanity's forward march.
 Apropos, the spirit of reverence and the
 Church must perform their necessary roles.

 transported out by American pilots and

 ROONEY REQUESTS HALF BILLION
 FOR RELIEF OF FLOOD RAVAGED
 STATES
 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROONEY) is
 recognized for 5 minutes.
 Mr. ROONEY of Pennsylvania. Mr.
 Speaker, in the wake of probably the
 most destructive flood in America's his-
 tory I have today announced that I will
 request an additional half billion dollars
 in Federal funds for relief in the five
 States which have been declared disaster
 areas by President Nixon.
 The $92.5 million now available to the
 States in the President's disaster relief
 fund will not begin to compensate the
 losses suffered by the five States. If
 Pennsylvania were to receive the entire
 $92.5 million it would cover only about 10
 percent of the cost of putting the State
 back together.
 I have introduced legislation to provide
 relief funds in the amount of one-half
 billion dollars to the States which have
 been declared disaster areas by the Presi-
 dent. This money would be disbursed by
 the Office of Emergency Preparedness
 whose primary function is the adminis-
 tration of the President's disaster relief
 fund. In past crises involving disaster
 areas in several States OEP has appor-
 tioned financial aid to the States accord-
 ing to the amount of damage sustained
 in the respective States. This is the only
 fair and realistic method of tackling the
 massive cleanup job ahead.
 Pennsylvania, hardest hit by the flood-
 ing by a wide margin, would receive the
 lion's share of the supplemental appro-
 priation, and Florida, having the least
 amount of damage of the five States,
 would receive the smallest portion. The
 remaining money would be distributed by
 OEP to Virginia, Maryland, and New
 York.
 Other Members and I of the Pennsyl-
 vania delegation will meet with Governor
 Shapp today to discuss the crippling ef-
 fects of the flood.
 I hope to explore all avenues of Federal
 assistance with the Governor and arrive
 at some concrete goals with regard to
 the needs of the stricken Pennsylvania
 communities.

 though the first Congress of the United
 States met in New York in 1789, in 1790
 it chose Philadelphia as the temporary
 seat of the new Government when Wash-
 ington was President.
 As students of history know, the Con-
 stitution was not a suddenly devised
 framework of government but the cul-
 mination of experience dating back to
 the Magna Carta of 1215 when 25 bar-
 ons of England united to force King
 John to sign and observe it.
 The Baronial Order of Magna Carta,
 composed of men who are lineal de-
 scendants of these 25 barons of England,
 and of which William Hannis Perot of
 Philadelphia is Marshal,  customarily
 commemorates the signing of the Magna
 Carta on the Sunday nearest June 15
 of each year at historic Christ Church in
 Philadelphia, the church attended by
 Washington. Most of the members of the
 order live in the Philadelphia region;
 some in the Washington, D.C. area. This
 order through the years has been a
 highly effective patriotic group in keep-
 ing alive the memories of the Magna
 Carta as a vital landmark in the de-
 velopment of constitutional liberty.
 On June 11, 1972, at this church, the
 Barons celebrated the 757th anniversary
 of the ensealing of the Magna Carta
 in an impressive program led by the rec-
 tor, the Reverend Ernest A. Harding,
 D.D., in which a member of the order,
 the Honorable Maurice H. Thatcher, dis-
 tinguished former Member of the Con-
 gress from Kentucky, and the sole sur-
 viving member of the Isthmian Canal
 Commission that supervised the con-
 struction of the Panama Canal, made
 the address for the occasion and received
 the Annual Award of the Order, which
 reads as follows:
 The Baronial Order of Magna Carta pre-
 sents its Magna Carta Day Award to Gov-
 ernor Maurice Hudson Thatcher in recogni-
 tion of his service to humanity:
 Particularly is this made for his champion-
 ing the Freedom of the Individual, further-

 by the Barons of England.

 April 1910. I served until August 1913-all
 during the construction era.
 My identification with the great enter-
 prise throughout my tenure was also that
 of Civil Governor of the Canal Zone. Colonel
 William C. Gorgas of Yellow Fever fame, was
 also a Member of the Commission; and we
 had our official headquarters in the same
 building.
 I was charged with certain duties which
 supported him in his important health and
 sanitary work; and it has given me great
 pleasure, in and out of Congress, in the
 years that followed, to have the opportunity
 to further provide for expansion of tropical
 research:
 The Republic of Panama ceded to our In-
 stitute, for the purposes OT a laboratory, im-
 portant lands and buildings in the City of
 Panama,  and we  have  erected  additional
 structures with Congressional funds.
 On an occasion of this character, it Is ex-
 pected, I believe, that the Awardee should
 submit some  remarks   dealing with mat-
 ters of current concern.
 This is the Age of Violence. Never in hu-
 man history has there been such brutal con-
 duct by people in the world, as is now tak-
 ing place.
 Under science the miracle of today be-
 comes the commonplace of tomorrow.
 The great achievements of science have
 been, in large measure, utilized by evilminded
 individuals for the most wicked deeds which
 mankind has ever conceived.
 Communism-the deadliest of evils, is busy
 as never before. We must wisely deal with
 these conditions, else they will destroy us.
 For this reason I speak of them.
 Assassinations, murders, thefts, robberies,
 holding for ransom,  hi-jacking,  guerrilla
 monstrosities;  slaying by wholesale of the
 innocent and defenseless, and degeneracies,
 have become the order of the day. No de-
 praved or cruel act is missing.
 The  news       media,  in  every  category, in
 large measure, are being prostituted; and
 the old Commandments, containing the es-
 sence of life experience; and the noble in-
 structions of the Sermon on the Mount, are
 being discarded in the world-at-large, and
 held in contempt.
 We canonize our criminals. They get the
 publicity, the sympathy, and the eulogies,
 and the acquittals. Our virtues are kept un-
 der the  bushel,  and  fail in  inspirational
 value. The red-carpet treatment has all too
 often been accorded by naive courts, juries,
 and others charged with the responsibilities
 affecting the social structure. Shrewd, bold,
 conscienceless members of my own profes-
 sion, often go beyond all decent bounds, and
 defy the courts, and enable the worst crimi-
 nals to escape the whips of justice, and re-
 peat their offenses.
 The TV and radio, and other media with
 certain exceptions, which so often have in-
 structed and inspired, and with so much
 potential for good, have all too oft become
 sewers  of  filth  and  degeneracy.  In  large
 measure, the children are neglected, and left
 to establish their own associations and con-
 siderations-with the inevitable results.
 No further enumeration is required. How-
 ever, we cannot ignore what Is so patent;
 such things bring disaster. I am a firm be-
 liever in the divine mission of Man; but I
 can have, of course, no conception as to the
 time he must live and struggle before he
 scales the peaks of lasting good. He has come
 and most grateful appreciation for their
 presence do this occasion,
 I also wish to thank with like appreciation,
 Baron and Mrs. Ross Porter Skillern for the
 gracious courtesies accorded myself and my
 traveling companion, Mr. Gilbert Dehnel of
 Washington, D.C. as guests in their charming
 home. Also, my thanks to others.
 Then, I wish to give assurance of my most
 grateful acknowledgement for the outstand-
 ing honor that was voted to me by the Baro-
 nial Order last fall, and now awarded.
 When I recall that men of such eminence
 as Generals MacArthur and Bradley; Chief
 Justice Bell, and certain outstanding mem-
 bers of the Baronial Order have been recipi-
 ents of this Award, I am indeed, humbly
 grateful that I am now thus honored.
 I know of no region more historic than
 that of Philadelphia, and its environs. In-
 dependence Hall and the Liberty Bell have
 their significance and memories.
 Great appreciation is due the Welsh and
 Swedes, as well as the English, Scotch and
 others. William Penn and his Quakers struc-
 tured a lasting monument. Here Benjamin
 Franklin grew into the vast proportions of
 a practical idealist, statesman, scientist, and
 successful civic and Revolutionary leader.
 This Commonwealth itself is a beautiful
 domain. Its great rivers, its mountains and
 valleys-together with its farming areas-
 present an unexcelled panorama of beauty.
 Valley Fore and Gettysburg-and the Get-
 tysburg Address-speak for themselves.
 Its historic worth is beyond all measure-
 ment.
 Besides the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
 vania there are three other Commonwealths
 in our American Union, namely, Massachu-
 setts, Virginia and Kentucky.
 My  own:, Commonwealth  of  Kentucky-
 with the aid of Daniel Boone, himself a na-
 tive of Pennsylvania, led the effort for the
 early settl$ment of Kentucky; and in time's
 course, there were born in Kentucky, the
 r?spective leaders of the North and South in
 the Civil War era, Lincoln and Davis.

 Air America clans m iggling
 SIR: Judi#hak8, in'her column of June 29 made
 'certain charges that I as managing director of Air
 America must take violent exception to. Her allegation
 . that this opium byproduct has been one
 of the more important cargoes carried by Air America
 is completely false. Needless to say, Miss Ran-
 dal. failed to provide any proof for this allegation and it
 is my opinion that a charge as damning as the one made
 by Miss Randal should be supported by more than just
 rumors.
 Air America is acutely aware of the Individual
 opportunities for smuggling that inherently exist with
 out type of operation. We realized that these opportuni-
 ties are made even more attractive by the fact that we
 operate in areas of the world where extremely high
 value, low bulk items such as gold and narcotics are
 easy to obtain and can be readily disposed of at tremen-
 dous profit.
 The company continually works to impress upon its
 employees the seriousness with which any and all smug-
 gling is viewed and evidence of such activity is cause for
 immediate termination! Also as a means for combating
 this situation we'have for years assigned highest priori-
 ty to the regular inspection of company aircraft, crews
 and cargoes by our own security force.
 The establishment of a separate Security Inspection
 Service under a USAID-Air America contract constitutes
 a major advance in preventing illegal transportation of
 drugs aboard U.S. government-chartered aircraft in
 Laos. Through the continued and expanded efforts of
 programs such as these, more effective means will be
 developed for greatly reducing and eventually eliminat-
 ing the opportunities for smuggling that still exist.
 Air America, in denying similar charges made by
 Alfred McCoy to the Senate Foreign Relations Opera-
 tions Subcommittee on June 2, 1972, stated that "if Mr.
 McCoy or any. other individual can provide proof that
 any Air America employee 'has been connected in any
 manner with the drug traffic, appropriate disciplinary
 action will be taken and the matter referred to the
 proper authorities."
 To date, no such proof has been forthcoming and we
 now extend the same inoftation to Miss Randal and The
 Star.

 The investigation and hearings con-
 ducted by the subcommittee have re-
 vealed barbiturate abuse to be both a sig-
 nificant public health problem and an
 ever increasing concern of law enforce-
 ment agencies. Barbiturate dependency
 and addiction have been described as
 more dangerous than amphetamine de-
 pendency and more widespread and
 physically destructive than heroin ad-
 diction. Barbiturate abuse is not a phe-
 nomenon restricted to the street culture
 of multiple drug abusers. It reaches into
 many areas of American life, affecting
 such diverse groups as grammar school,
 high school and college students, indus-
 trial workers, middle-class party goers
 and residents of our ghettos and barrios.
 Barbiturates are the best known of the
 drugs which are used medically to relax
 the central nervous system. On the street
 these sedatives are known as "downers"
 or "goofballs." They are also known as
 reds, red devils, yellow jackets, blue an-
 gels, rainbows, and Christmas trees. All
 are synthetically derived from barbituric
 acid. They vary, however, in the onset
 and duration of their action.
 Barbiturates  are highly dangerous
 when taken without proper medical su-
 pervision. Increasing use of these pills
 quickly produces tolerance. Once toler-
 ance is achieved, the user experiences a
 euphoric effect from taking "downers."
 Rather than feeling merely drowsy and
 sluggish, he actually feels high and com-
 pletely insulated from reality. A regular
 abuser will suffer severe withdrawal
 symptoms when the drug is suddenly ter-
 minated. Severe withdrawal may be
 brought on even by a moderate reduc-
 tion of the accustomed dose. After 12
 hours off the drug, the abuser experiences

 ing. Thus, casual attitudes toward these
 potentially destructive drugs, coupled
 with a readily available supply in the
 family medicine. cabinet, appear inti-
 mately connected with the current trend
 in youthful barbiturate abuse.
 Last December, the subcommittee con-
 ducted hearings on the nature and extent
 of barbiturate abuse. We heard repre-
 sentatives of the medical community de-
 scribe the enormous abuse potential of
 these drugs. Dr. Sidney Cohen, former
 Director, Division of Narcotic Addiction
 and Drug Abuse, National Institute of
 Mental Health, characterized 1972 as
 "the year of the downer." We heard
 young people who had experienced the
 horrors of barbiturate dependency relate
 how easy it is to obtain these dangerous
 drugs. In fact, many of the young wit-
 nesses had started down the terrible road
 to barbiturate addiction with pills taken
 from the family medicine cabinet. We
 learned from criminologists and sociolo-
 gists the dynamics of abuse and emerging
 nationwide patterns of barbiturate de-
 pendency and addiction.
 The subcommittee hearings on May 2,
 3, and 17 focused on the problem of il-
 licit barbiturate traffic. We heard testi-
 mony from a New York reporter who ob-
 tained barbiturates with prescription
 blanks he had printed at a nominal cost,
 bearing the name of "Dr. D. M. Sugob"
 which, spelled backwards, reads "Bogus,
 M. D." These prescriptions showed no
 BNDD number as required by law. The
 senior officer of the Norfolk, Va., Nar-
 cotics Squad told the subcommittee that
 his city is experiencing a steady increase
 in the illegal use and distribution of
 barbiturates. In fact, he predicted no
 less than a 100-percent increase in ar-
 rests for possession and distribution of
 barbiturates during the coming year.
 Mr. Joseph P. Busch, district attor-
 ney of Los Angeles County, told the sub-
 committee that-
 Barbiturates have always played a maor
 role In the illegal drug traffic in Los Angeles
 and In recent years they have become the
 growth drug.
 He cited a recent survey of Los Angeles
 city schools showing barbiturates to be
 the No. 1 school drug problem.  Mr.
 Busch described some of the typical bar-
 biturate cases encountered by juvenile
 officers in Los Angeles County:
 An eight year-old child. Dropped a red
 every day after school. His parents eventual-
 ly brought him to police. He said he enjoyed
 the feeling that the pills gave him.
 A sixteen year-old juvenile. Habit of eight

 Mr. Bryan Finkle, forensic toxicolo-
 gist, department of district attorney,
 County of Santa Clara, San Jose, Calif.,
 reported that his county was experienc-
 Ing a secobarbital epidemic. He pre-
 ser}ted alarming data indicating that
 during the year July 1, 1969 to June 30,
 1970, 45 percent of the 2,295 drug cases
 analyzed, or 75 percent of the 1,377 cases
 yielding positive results, involving the
 drug secobarbital; that 80 percent of
 these individuals were less than 26 years
 old; that 50 percent of the individuals
 involved in vehicle code offenses over a
 2-year period resulting in accidents in-
 volved the drug secobarbital; and that
 the average blood concentration of seco-
 barbital of those involved in these acci-
 dents was three times the maximum con-
 centration found in persons taking seco-
 barbital therapeutically under medical
 supervision.
 A special assistant attorney general
 from New Mexico testified that every
 few weeks, 40,000 illegal barbiturates ar-
 rive in Santa Fe, a city with a popula-
 tion of 40,000, These dangerous drugs
 are sold on the streets, in school corri-
 dors, and even on playgrounds adjoining
 elementary schools. We learned that
 Santa Fe is averaging close to one bar-
 bitlirate  death  every 3  days.  The
 youngest fatality, a 30-day-old infant,
 born a secobarbital addict, failed to sur-
 vive the violent convulsive consequences
 of its tragic entry into the world.
 lyfany witnesses,  including former
 barbiturate addicts and law enforce-
 ment officials, have told the subcommit-
 tee that barbiturates are obtained il-
 licitly from friends, street dealers, physi-
 cians, pharmacies, or by pilfering abun-
 dantly supplied family medicine cabinets.
 Others have suggested that a significant
 percentage of the persons abusing bar-
 biturates obtain them originally through
 legitimate channels and then resort to
 self-medication, nonmedical, use, or illicit
 traffic. One youngster, age 16, remarked
 that it is less of a "hassle" to obtain
 "dgwners"  than  it  is  to  purchase
 cigarettes.
 T have learned how readily available
 and inexpensive these drugs are from
 personal experience. Several months ago
 I visited a number of barbiturate treat-
 ment programs in California. During the
 course of a "rap session" with several
 barbiturate addicts, one young counselor
 at the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic in
 San Francisco, himself a former bar-
 biturate addict, slipped out of the session
 unnoticed. In a matter of minutes he re-
 turned with the fruits of several minutes
 efforts: A handful of legitimately pro-
 duced "yellow jackets," purchased for
 25 cents a capsule from a local street
 dealer.
 Although the specific numerical esti-
 mates differ, there is a consensus among
 those testifying to date, except for repre-
 sentatives of the drug industry, that a
 significant proportion of legitimately
 produced barbiturates find their way into
 the illicit market. Mr. John Ingersoll, the
 Director of the Bureau of Narcotics and
 Dangerous Drugs, recently told the sub-
 committee that "unlike the case of all
 other, major drugs of abuse, it appears
 that barbiturates are supplied exclusively
 from what begins as legitimate produc-
 tion."
 In order to bring a clearer focus on
 the issues of barbiturate abuse and illicit
 barbiturate traffic, I recently introduced
 two pieces of legislation relating to the
 production, distribution, and control of
 barbiturates. S. 3539 would provide for
 the rescheduling of several commonly
 abused shorter acting barbiturates from
 schedule III to schedule II of the Con-
 trolled  Substances  Act.  This  change
 would subject these particular barbitu-
 rates to stricter production and distri-
 bution controls. S. 3538 would require all
 manufacturers of solid oral form sched-
 ule II barbiturates to place identifying
 marks or symbols on their, products. This
 bill would facilitate law enforcement ef-
 forts to determine the sources of diverted
 barbiturates. I appreciate the support of
 my 26 colleagues who have cosponsored
 these two measures.
 Today, I am introducing the "Danger-
 ous Drug Control Act of 1972" which will
 further assist law enforcement agencies
 in their investigations of the diversion
 of controlled substances. This measure
 also provides for the Attorney General to
 conduct a comprehensive study and
 analysis of the diversion of controlled
 substances.
 My bill will require manufacturers to
 incoroprate an inert tracer ingredient
 in all schedule II and schedule III stimu-
 lants and depressants, including the
 widely abused amphetamines and bar-
 biturates. The presence of these tracers
 will assist law enforcement agencies in
 the identification of diverted controlled
 substances, whether seized in bulk form
 or in the form of illicitly manufactured
 or illicitly capsulized pills.
 Such a tracer system has been recom-
 mended by numerous witnesses who
 have appeared before the subcommittee.
 Mr. Joseph P. Busch, district attorney of
 Los Angeles County, recommended that
 tracer materials be placed in all do-
 mestically produced barbiturate sub-
 stances. Mr. Busch illustrated the use-
 fulness of tracers in a recent heroin in-
 vestigation, in which his office placed a
 tracer in chemicals being shipped to a
 Mexican laboratory believed to be pro-
 ducing heroin. When the tracer appeared
 in heroin sold in California, Mr. Busch
 was able to verify the origin of the
 heroin.
 Tracers in stimulant and depressant
 substances would provide similar assist-
 ance in source identification. Consider-
 able evidence supports the hypothesis
 that  legitimately  produced  domestic
 drugs, in bulk and dosage unit form, are
 shipped to Mexico and eventually im-
 ported to illicit markets in this country.
 The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
 Drugs and the Customs Bureau have
 seized 7,600,000 unmarked red secobar-
 bital units in the past 24 months. In one
 case, an individual was arrested in pos-
 session of 2 million unmarked red seco-
 barbital units and large quantities of
 amphetamines. The presence of a tracer
 would assist law enforcement officers in
 identifying the source of these drugs,
 even if the substances have been repack-
 aged or recapsulized for illegal trade.
 Tracers would in no way impair the qual-
 ity or the therapeutic value of these
 drugs.
 Although   "California   reds"-also
 known as "`Mexican reds"-have been
 found in Denver, New Orleans, and New
 York City, it is important to emphasize

 that this is a special situation super-
 imposed on a broader barbiturate abuse
 pattern affecting the entire Nation. The
 barbiturates seized in nearly all com-
 munities are legitimately produced do-
 mestic barbiturates in dosage unit form.
 My bill authorizes the Attorney Gen-
 eral to require the incorporation of trac-
 er, ingredients in other controlled sub-
 stances as may be necessary to control
 the diversion and abuse of these sub-
 stances.
 My bill requires the Attorney General,
 after consultation with the Secretary of
 Health, Education, and Welfare and oth-
 ers knowledgeable in the manufacture,
 distriution, and monitoring of controlled
 substances,  to  determine  appropriate
 methods for incorporating tracer ingre-
 dients in depressants and stimulants.
 The Attorney General is required to con-
 duct research and educational programs
 to implement the tracer program; to de-
 velop rapid field and laboratory identi-
 fication tecniques; to train local, State,
 and Federal law enforcement personnel
 regarding the identification of tracer
 elements and investigation of diversion;
 and to establish standards to evaluate
 diversion and tracer control of other
 controlled substances.
 There is an urgent need for a compre-
 hensive information system for use in
 detecting and preventing drug diversion
 and in measuring the impact of enforce-
 ment and regulatory efforts. The Comp-
 troller General in the April 17, 1972 re-
 port of the General Accounting Office
 entitled "Efforts to Prevent Dangerous
 Drugs from Illicitly Reaching The Pub-
 lic", made the following conclusions rela-
 tive to reporting and identification of
 seized drugs by law enforcement agen-
 cies:
 DRUGS SEIZED BY STATE AND LOCAL ENFORCE-
 MENT GROUPS NOT EXAMINED
 BNDD, the Bureau of Customs, and State
 and local enforcement agencies seize large
 quantities of drugs. BNDD strives to identify
 the manufacturer of drugs seized by its
 agents and the Bureau of Customs, since the
 manufacturers' identity can be valuable in
 BNDD's  investigation  to  determine  the
 source and significance of the diversion. We
 found however that, although it had made
 some efforts to identify manufacturers of
 drugs seized by State and local enforcement
 agencies, BNDD had no formal procedures for
 obtaining such information and that infor-
 mal requests for samples of seized drugs had
 produced few results.
 Manufacturers of legally produced amphet-
 amines and barbiturates can be identified
 by marking, such as trade names and trade-
 marks, or by pillistics. Pillistics, a procedure
 similar to ballistics, identifies pills with the
 machines which produced them. BNDD has
 obtained samples (authentics) of pills from
 manufacturers which have been identified to
 specific machines. When the origin of seized
 pills is unknown, the pills can be compared
 with the authentics in an attempt to identi-
 fy the manufacturers that produced them.
 BNDD officials expressed the view that
 more complete information on the origin of
 drugs seized by State and local groups would
 be a valuable aid in their investigation. The
 value of this information is illustrated in a
 case involving amphetamine pills seized in
 California. Through its examination BNDD
 identified pills smuggled in from Mexico as
 being manufactured by a drug firm in the
 Midwest. Subsequent investigations at this
 firm revealed that large quantities of am-
 phetamines were en route to a fictitious ad-
 dress in Mexico. This shipment was seized.
 In our visit to 13 State and local enforce-
 ment groups in California, New Jersey, and
 New York, we learned that a number of large
 seizures had been made in the past year but
 that little attempt had been made to deter-
 mine the origin of the drugs. Most officials
 were not aware of BNDD's efforts to identify
 manufacturers but were willing to cooperate
 with BNDD In establishing such a system.
 In one large metropolitan police depart-
 ment, we found that over 1,358,000 pills were
 seized during 1970. Three of the seizures con-
 sisted of about 270,000, 96,000, and 68,000
 pills and accounted for over 30 percent of
 the total seized. No attempt has been made
 by the police department to determine the
 origin of these drugs nor had BNDD obtained
 samples for this purpose.
 In other enforcement agencies, we found
 also that no attempt had been made to deter-
 mine the origin of many drug seizures rang-
 ing from 5,000 to over 100,000 pills. In ad-
 dition, we found that none of the enforce-
 ment agencies had uniform procedures for
 recording statistics on drug seizures and in
 several cases, no data was maintained.
 We believe that BNDD should establish a
 procedure to obtain information on drugs
 seized by State and local enforcement groups.
 BNDD also should obtain samples of large
 drug seizures for its examination when the
 origin of the drugs is unknown. In addition,
 a uniform reporting format should be sug-
 gested to State and local enforcement groups
 so that data could be gathered systematically
 and uniformly and could be reported to
 BNDD.
 The GAO report concludes that-
 Much more needs to be done by the Bu-
 reau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the
 States, local agencies, and the industry to
 reduce the diversion of legitimately manu-
 factured drugs into illicit channels where
 they become easily available to young people
 and adults.
 My bill provides for the systematic
 collection of data relevant to drug diver-
 sion and requires a thorough assessment
 of law enforcement efforts in this area.
 It requires the Attorney General to ob-
 tain comprehensive data from State and
 local agencies; to assess law enforcement
 efforts to control diversion; and to in-
 sure that State and local information
 systems are compatible with the Attor-
 ney General's diversion program.
 Manufacturers, wholesalers and retail-
 ers registered under the Controlled Sub-
 stances Act of 1970 have expressed con-
 cern that reports they have made to
 BNDD regarding possible diversion have
 not been systematically investigated and
 that when investigations are conducted
 they are infrequently informed of the
 outcome. My bill requires the Attorney
 General to establish uniform procedures
 to monitor and investigate all reports of
 dangerous drug purchases and orders of
 an unusual or suspicious nature and to
 systematically inform the reporting par-
 ties regarding the results of BNDD in-
 vestigations.
 To date there has been no systematic
 gathering of available data on the nature
 and extent of diversion. My bill requires
 the Attorney General to obtain from
 State and local law enforcement agen-
 cies all available information, including
 reports of thefts, seizures, and arrests in-
 volving controlled substances.
 The military services purchase sub-
 stantial amounts of dangerous drugs
 S 11321
 each year. The Defense Personnel Sup-
 port Center in Philadelphia, Pa., pur-
 chased about 131 million pills and cap-
 sules of dangerous drugs during fiscal
 years 1970 and 1971. The possibility of
 diversion within the military supply sys-
 tem is considerable. Many witnesses tes-
 tifying before the subcommittee have
 indicated that military bases, depots, and
 hospitals are common points of diver-
 sion for amphetamines, barbitarurates,
 and other dangerous drugs. The GAO
 report found that procedures for the
 military services to provide information
 to BNDD on thefts and other shortages
 of dangerous drugs are not adequate.
 My bill requires the Attorney General
 to obtain information on thefts and
 shortages within the military supply sys-
 tem and to establish procedures for reg-
 ular meetings with appropriate military
 officials on mutual problems concerning
 the diversion of controlled substances.
 To assure that information regarding
 the diversion of controlled substances
 receives appropriate attention, my bill
 provides that the Attorney General shall
 submit a comprehensive annual report
 to the Congress on the diversion of con-
 trolled substances. The report will in-
 clude an assessment of the nature and
 extent of diversion; an appraisal of the
 effectiveness of law enforcement efforts
 to curb diversion; and an evaluation of
 the tracer system provided in my bill in
 the investigation and prevention of di-
 version.
 The Controlled Substances Act of 1970
 requires  that  persons  manufacturing,
 distributing, and dispensing controlled
 substances register with the Attorney
 General. In determining whether to reg-
 ister an applicant, the Attorney General
 is required to determine whether a reg-
 istrant has failed to maintain effective
 controls against the diversion of any
 controlled substance, and whether he
 has failed to provide a standard of con-
 trol consistent with public health and,
 safety. Yet, under the 1970 act, the At-
 torney General is not authorized to re-
 voke or suspend the registration of per-
 sons who abandon controlled substances.
 My bill authorizes the Attorney Gen-
 eral to revoke or suspend the registration
 of manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers,
 and others who abandon controlled sub-
 stances, such as amphetamines and bar-
 biturates, or who fail to provide controls
 consistent with public health and safety.
 Criminal penalties are provided for reg-
 istrants who abandon controlled sub-
 stances. Thus, the Attorney General can
 insure not only that prospective regis-
 trants meet standards necessary to curb
 the diversion of controlled substances
 into illicit channels, but also that those
 currently registered to manufacture, dis-
 tribute, or dispense controlled substances
 continue to meet these same standards.
 The abuse and diversion of legitimately
 produced dangerous drugs into channels
 other than legitimate medical, scientific,
 and industrial channels should be a pri-
 mary concern for all citizens. The sub-
 committee, the Congress, and the public
 at large are all too familiar with the hor-
 rors of drug dependency and addiction
 and their attendant destructiveness and
 tragedy. While the current focus of con-

 tern today is on heroin addiction, it would
 be folly to overlook the present and pros-
 pective role of legitimately produced dan-
 gerous drugs.
 My bills S. 3539, S. 3538, and the Dan-
 gerous Drug Control Act of 1972 which I
 am introducing today, provide the assist-
 ance necessary to aid the law enforce-
 ment agencies of this country in their
 efforts to deal more effectively with the
 diversion of controlled dangerous drugs.
 We have learned from the experience
 of major urban areas, especially those on
 the west coast, that barbiturate abuse
 and addiction is a natural outgrowth of
 the abuse of psychedelic drugs and am-
 phetamines and that many heroin ad-
 dicts and methadone users are abusing
 or are addicted to barbiturates. Patterns
 of abuse experienced in California are
 emerging in cities and towns throughout
 our country. This "ripple effect" should
 clearly alert us to the need to control
 and monitor more adequately the pro-
 duction and distribution of dangerous
 drugs. I urge my colleagues to support the
 Dangerous Drug Control Act of 1972.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that a section-by-section analysis
 of the bill, together with the bill itself,
 be printed at this point in my remarks.
 There being no objection, the bill and
 analysis were ordered to be printed in
 the RECORD, as follows:
 S. 3819
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House
 of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That this
 Act may be cited as the "Dangerous Drug
 Control Act of 1972."
 SEC. 2. Section 305 of the Controlled Sub-
 stances Act  (Public Law 91-513, 84 Stat.
 1250) Is amended by adding at the end there-
 of the following new paragraph:
 "(e)  (1)  It shall be unlawful to manu-
 facture or distribute Schedule II or Schedule
 III depressant and stimulant controlled sub-
 stances, including immediate precursors, un-
 less such substances contain an inert, in-
 nocuous  tracer ingredient identifying the
 manufacturer or manufacturers, as required
 by regulation of the Attorney General. (2)
 The Attorney General is authorized to re-
 quire the Incorporation of tracer ingredients
 in any controlled substance as necessary to
 maintain effective control against diversion
 into other than legitimate medical, scientific,
 and industrial channels."
 SEC. 3. Section 602 of the Controlled Sub-

 "(b) The Attorney General, after consulta-
 tion with the Secretary of Health, Education,
 and Welfare and with national organizations
 representative of persons with knowledge and
 experience in the manufacture, distribution
 and monitoring of controlled substances,
 shall determine appropriate methods for in-
 corporating tracer ingredients in Schedule
 II and III depressant and stimulant sub-
 stances in a manner that will facilitate the
 Investigation of the illegal diversion of these
 substances. To carry out the purposes of sec-
 tion 305(e) and of this section the Attorney
 General shall conduct research and educa-
 tional programs. Such programs shall in-
 elude-

 SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
 SECTION 1
 This section contains a short title to reflect
 the amending of the Controlled Substances
 Act of 1970.
 SECTION 2
 This section amends section 305 of the Act
 making it unlawful to manufacture or dis-
 tribute Schedule II or Schedule III depres-
 sant and stimulant substances unless they
 contain tracer ingredients. It also author-
 iezs the Attorney General to require tracers
 in other substances as may be necessary.
 SECTION 3
 This section amends sections 502 of the
 Act by requiring the Attorney General, after
 consultation with the Secretary of Health,
 Education and Welfare and others knowl-
 edgeable in the manufacture, distribution
 and monitoring of controlled substances, to
 determine appropriate methods  for incor-
 porating tracers in depressants and stimulant
 controlled substances. This amendment of
 section 502 requires the Attorney General
 to conduct programs to implement the tracer
 program; to develop rapid field and labora-
 tory tracer identification techniques; to train
 local,  State  and  Federal  law enforcement
 personnel  regarding    the  identification  of
 tracer elements and investiagtion of diver-
 sion; and to establish standards to evaluate
 diversion and tracer control of other con-
 trolled substances.
 SECTION 4 (A)
 This subsection amends Part E of the Act
 by adding two new sections. The new sec-
 tion 504 requires the Attorney General to
 establish regulations to otbain comprehensive
 information from State and local law en-
 forcement agencies in order to assess the
 nature and extent of diversion and the im-
 pact of efforts to curb diversion; to estab-
 lish a uniform system for investigating and
 reporting the disposition of inevstigations
 regarding  dangerous  drug  purchases  and
 orders of an unusual or suspicious nature
 reported by registrants under the Act; to
 obtain from State and local law enforcement
 agencies all currently available information
 on the diversion of controlled substances, in-

 eluding reports of thefts, seizures and arrests
 involving such substances; and to obtain'
 information on thefts and shortages of con-
 trolled substances within the military supply
 system and establish regular meetings with
 the military services regarding diversion of
 such substances.
 The new section 505 requires the Attorney
 General to submit an annual report to the
 Congress on the nature and extent of con-
 trolled substances diversion; the effective-
 ness of law enforcement efforts to curb di-
 version of controlled substances; and the ef-
 fectiveness of the tracer system.
 SECTION 4 (B)
 This subsection redesignates sections 504
 through 516 of the Act.
 SECTION 5 (A)
 This subsection defines "abandon" as a
 voluntary relinquishment of possession, or
 control of a controlled substance without
 vesting possession or control in another au-
 thorized person.
 SECTION 5 (B)
 This  subsection redesignates clauses  12
 through 26 of section 102 of the Act.
 SECTION 5 (C)
 This subsection amends section 304(a) of
 the Act by providing that abandonment or
 failure to maintain effective controls against
 diversion or failure to provide a standard
 of control consistent with the public health
 or safety are grounds for suspension or revo-

 By Mr. McGOVERN:
 S. 3820. A bill to provide for payment
 of costs of pending litigation out of funds
 appropriated to pay a judgment in favor
 of the Yankton Sioux Tribe in Indian
 Claims Commission docket No. 332-A.
 Referred to the Committee on Interior
 and Insular Affairs.
 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, the
 Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota is
 one of the smaller, poorer tribes of the
 United States. Pursuant to the Indian
 Claims Commission Act, the tribe filed
 claims against the United States-a land
 claim for lands once owned by the tribe
 in. Iowa, generally described as the Royce
 151 claim, a claim for lands ceded by an
 1858 treaty, generally described as the
 Royce  410  and  Sioux  Fort  Lramie
 claims, and a suit for an accounting of
 funds and properties of the tribe by the
 United States. The Royce 151 claim was
 litigated as docket No. 332-A in the
 Indian Claims Commission. It resulted in
 a judgment for the Yankton Sioux Tribe
 In the amount of $1,250,000. Funds to
 satisfy the judgment were appropriated
 by the Congress by the act of July 22,
 1969 (83 Stat. 49). Those funds, less
 attorney fees, expenses, and planning
 funds have been invested but are not
 available for use by the tribe until Con-
 gress approves their distribution.
 Funds were borrowed by the Yankton
 Sioux Tribe from the "Expert Assistance
 Loan Fund" established by the act of
 November 4, 1963 (77 Stat. 301) with
 which to retain expert anthropologists to
 aid them in establishing their claim to
 aboriginal title of the Royce 410 area and
 to recognized title along with the Teton
 Sioux in the Sioux Fort Laramie lands.
 Those funds were repaid to the loan fund
 out of the award in docket No. 332-A.
 In the land case still pending, which is
 Indian Claims Commission docket num-
 bered 332-C, the Yankton Tribe alleged
 that it was paid an unconscionably low
 compensation for the lands which they
 gave up pursuant to treaty in 1858, rati-
 fled in 1859. To prove this, the tribe must
 establish the market value of those lands
 as of 1859 and further prove that the con-
 sideration which the Government actual-
 ly paid for the lands was considerably
 less than the true value of the lands at
 that time. The experts will also have to
 study whether the consideration moneys
 appropriated by Congress actually were
 used for the benefit of the Yankton Tribe.
 The area involved covers at least 72 mil-
 lion acres, most of it in the Sioux-Fort
 Laramie area. Although the Commission
 determined that the Yankton Tribe
 owned only a 17-percent interest in the
 vast Sioux-Fort Laramie area, the en-
 tire tract must be appraised in order to
 determine the worth of a 17-percent in-
 terest therein.
 This proof requires the assistance of
 expert appraisers experienced in the field
 of historical appraisal, a mineral ap-
 praiser to determine the value as of 1859
 of then-known minerals in the area, and
 historians to receive the times. In the
 accounting phase of the case which is
 Indian Claims Commission docket No.
 332-B, the tribe will need the aid of his-
 torians, anthropologists and accountants.
 When the claims have been determined,
 the tribe will need the aid of historians
 and accountants to defend against the
 Government's claim of offsets.
 The valuation phase of the Yankton
 land claim has been set for hearing in
 November of this year and the Yankton
 Tribe's attorneys are making every effort
 to be prepared for trial on that date. As
 early as March 3, 1971, the General
 Council of. the Yankton Tribe passed a
 resolution earmarking $150,000 of the
 funds due the tribe from their docket No.
 332-A award to cover these necessary
 litigation expenses. No attorney fees will
 be paid from this litigation fund. The at-
 torneys work on a contingent fee basis
 and will be paid if the pending claims are
 successfully concluded. The attorneys
 had earlier advised the tribe to file an
 application for additional funds from.
 the expert witness loan fund. The appli-
 cation was granted-subject to avail-
 ability of funds. To date, no additional
 funds are available for the Yankton
 Tribe's use. Appraisers, historians, and
 accountants undertook to do the work
 S 11323
 expecting funds to be available long be-
 fore today either from the loan fund or
 from the tribe's own funds to pay their
 fees and expenses. The loan fund is ex-
 hausted and the tribe's funds are held
 up here in Congress because of a dis-
 agreement over how much of the funds
 may be distributed per capita.
 The bill introduced today would release
 the $150,000 of Yankton funds, or as
 much as shall be necessary to pay fees
 and expenses of expert witnesses to avoid
 further delay in the litigation of claims
 before the Indian Claims Commission.
 Use of the balance of the award arising
 from docket 332-A can then be deter-
 mined at a later time.
 There is no disagreement concerning
 the establishment of this litigation fund
 to finance the tribe's remaining claims.
 If these funds are not made available for
 use in the litigation now, the Novem-
 ber 16, 1972, trial date for docket No.
 332-C-which is the Yankton's largest
 claim-will have to be postponed. No in-
 terest is generally paid to the tribe on
 judgment awards for lands taken where
 unconscionable consideration was paid.
 Therefore. if the Yankton Tribe is de-
 prived of the use of its money at this
 time to prosecute its pending claims,
 there will be several hundreds of thou-
 sands of dollars lost to the tribe solely
 because of the delay in obtaining its
 judgment.
 In addition, the necessary experts have
 been retained and have commenced their
 work with the trial date of November 16,
 1972, scheduled in their workload. If the
 litigation fund from docket No. 332-A
 is not made available, these experts will
 be forced to discontinue their work. Re-
 sumption of activity by these experts at
 a later date will only result in more re-
 quired work, more compensation to be
 paid by the tribe and a rescheduling of a
 trial date in the future which must be
 mutually acceptable to the Indian Claims
 Commission and the experts-for both
 the tribe and the Government.
 Therefore, denial of the use of this
 litigation fund at this time will result
 in delayed justice to the Yankton Tribe
 for claims now over 100 years old and,
 more important, definite loss of sub-
 stantial moneys to the tribe.

 sent that the full text of he bill I am now

 By Mr. MILLER (for himself and
 Mr. HUGHES) :
 S. 3822. A bill authorizing the City of
 Clinton Bridge Commission to convey
 its bridge structures and other assets to
 the State of Iowa and to provide for the
 completion of a partially constructed
 bridge across the Mississippi River at
 or near Clinton, Iowa, by the State High-
 way Commission of the State of Iowa.
 Referred to the Committee on Public
 Works.
 Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I intro-
 duce, for myself and my colleague from
 Iowa, a bill to authorize the City of Clin-
 ton Bridge Commission to convey its
 bridge structures and other assets to the
 State of Iowa and to provide for the
 completion of a partially constructed
 bridge across the Mississippi River at
 Clinton, Iowa, by the Iowa State High-
 way Commission.
 The Clinton Bridge Commission was
 originally created under Federal law in
 1944 to construct and operate bridges
 across the Mississippi River at Clinton,
 Iowa. The commission presently owns
 and operates two bridges, and in recent
 years has undertaken the construction
 of another bridge to replace one of the
 existing. bridges which is inadequate. As
 a result of a limitation in the enabling
 legislation on allowable interest that
 could be charged on bonds to finance
 construction of bridges, and because of
 an unfavorable ruling on the tax exempt
 status of any bonds, the commission has
 been unable to raise funds to complete
 the new bridge.
 Recently the Iowa State Highway
 Commission and the bridge commission
 agreed that construction of the bridge
 could best be completed by turning over
 the project to the highway commission.
 In order to facilitate this transfer and
 to insure the tax exempt status of the
 bonds, the highway commission has re-
 quested  that  Federal  legislation  be
 passed. Therefore, I am introducing this
 bill to authorize the transfer of the cur-
 rent bridges and assets of the Clinton
 Bridge Commission to the highway com-
 mission and to authorize the latter to
 complete construction of the new bridge.
 It is my understanding that the Iowa and
 Illinois Highway Commissions, and the
 Clinton Bridge Commission are all in
 favor of this legislation.
 It is hoped that the Public Works
 Committee will act expeditiously on this
 matter and, if necessary to facilitate
 passage, will add the provisions of the
 bill to the Highway Act of 1972 or other
 legislation which will be acted upon this
 year.
 A similar bill has been introduced in
 the House.
 I ask unanimous consent that a copy
 of the bill and a background memoran-
 dum prepared by the attorneys for the
 Iowa State Highway Commission be
 printed in the RECORD at this point.
 There being no objection, the bill and
 memorandum were ordered to be printed
 In the RECORD, as follows:
 S. 3822
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House
 of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That in or-
 der to facilitate interstate commerce by ex-
 pediting the completion of interstate bridge
 facilities across the Mississippi River in the
 vicinity of the City of Clinton, Iowa, the
 City of Clinton Bridge Commission (here-
 after referred to as the "Commission"), cre-
 ated and operating under the Act approved
 December 21, 1944, as revived, amended and
 re-enacted, is hereby authorized to sell, con-
 vey and transfer to the State of Iowa all of
 its real and personal property, books, rec-
 ords, money and other assets, including all
 existing bridges for vehicular traffic crossing
 the Mississippi River at or near the City of
 Clinton, Iowa, and the substructure consti-
 tuting the partially constructed new bridge
 which has been designed to replace the older
 of the two existing vehicular bridges, to-
 gether with all easements, approaches and
 approach  highways  appurtenant  to  said
 bridge structures, and to enter into such
 agreements with the State Highway Commis-
 sion of the State of Iowa (hereafter referred
 to as the "Highway Commission"), and The
 Department of Transportation of the State of
 Illinois as may be necessary to accomplish
 the foregoing: Provided, however, That at or
 before the time of delivery of the deeds and
 other instruments of conveyance, all out-
 standing indebtedness or other liabilities of
 said Commission must either have been paid
 in full as to both principal and interest or
 sufficient funds must have been set aside in a
 special fund pledged to retire said outstand-
 ing indebtedness or other liabilities and in-
 terest thereon at or prior to maturity, to-
 gether with any premium which may be re-
 quired to be paid in the event of payment
 of the Indebtedness prior to maturity. The
 cost to the Highway Commission of acquir-
 Ing the existing bridge structures by the
 State of Iowa shall Include all engineering,
 legal, financing, architectural, traffic survey-
 ing and other expenses as may be necessary
 to accomplish the conveyance and transfer
 of the properties, together with such amount
 as may be necessary to provide for the pay-
 ment                                                                       of the outstanding indebtedness or
 other liabilities of the Commission as here-
 inbefore referred to, and permit the dissolu-
 tion of the Commission as hereinafter pro-
 vided, less the amount of cash on hand which
 is turned over to the Highway Commission
 by the Commission.
 SEc. 2. The Highway Commission is hereby
 authorized to accept the conveyance and
 transfer of the abovementioned bridge struc-
 tures, property and assets of the City of
 Clinton Bridge Commission on behalf of the
 State of Iowa, to complete the construction
 of the new replacement bridge, to repair,
 reconstruct, maintain and operate as toll
 bridges the existing bridges so acquired until
 the new replacement bridge has been com-
 pleted, to dismantle the older of the two
 existing bridges upon completion of the new
 replacement bridge, and to thereafter repair,
 reconstruct, maintain and operate the two
 remaining bridges as toll bridges. There is
 hereby conferred upon the Highway Com-
 mission the right and power to enter upon
 such lands and to acquire, condemn, occupy,
 possess, and use such privately owned real
 estate and other property in the State of
 Iowa and the State of Illinois as may be
 needed for the location, construction, recon-
 struction or completion of any such bridges
 and for the operation and maintenance of
 any bridge and the approaches, upon making
 just compensation therefor to be ascertained
 and paid according to the laws of the State
 in which such real estate or other property
 is situated, and the proceedings therefor
 shall be the same as in the condemnation
 of private property for public purposes by
 said State. The Highway Commission is fur-
 ther authorized to enter into agreements with
 the State of Illinois and any agency or sub-,
 division thereof, and with any agency or sub-
 division of the State of Iowa, for the acquisi-
 tion, lease, or use of any lands or property
 owned by such state or political subdivision.
 The cost of acquiring the existing bridge
 structures, of completing the replacement
 bridge and of dismantling the bridge to be
 replaced  and  paying  expenses  incidental
 thereto as referred to in Section 1 of this
 General Assembly of the State of Iowa, or
 through the use of any other funds available
 for the purpose, or both. The above described
 toll bridge structures shall be repaired, re-
 constructed, maintained and operated by the
 Highway Commission In accordance with the
 provisions of the General Bridge Act of 1946,
 approved August 2, 1946, and the location
 and plans for the replacement bridge shall
 be approved by the Secretary of Transporta-
 tion in accordance with the provisions of said
 Act, as well as by The Department of Trans-
 portation of the State of Illinois. The rates
 and schedule of tolls for said bridges shall
 be charged and collected in accordance with
 said General Bridge Act of 1946 and applica-
 ble Iowa legislation and shall be continuously
 adjusted and maintained so as to provide
 a fund sufficient to pay for the reasonable
 cost of maintaining, repairing and operating
 the bridges and approaches under economical
 management, to provide a fund sufficient to
 pay the principal of and interest on such
 bonds as may be issued by the Highway Com-
 mission as the same shall fall due and the
 redemption or repurchase price of all or any
 thereof redeemed or repurchased before ma-
 turity, and to repay any money borrowed by
 any other means in connection with the ac-
 quisition, construction, reconstruction, com-
 pletion, repair, operation or maintenance of
 any of said bridge structures. All tolls and
 other revenues from said bridges are hereby
 pledged to such uses. No obligation created
 pursuant to any provision of this Act shall
 constitute an indebtedness of the United
 States.
 SEc. 3. After all bonds or other obligations
 issued or indebtedness incurred by the High-
 way Commission or loans of funds for the
 account of said bridges and interest and
 premium, if any, have been paid, or after
 a sinking fund sufficient for such payment
 shall have been provided and shall be held
 solely for that purpose, the State of Iowa
 shall  deliver  deeds  or  other  suitable  in-
 struments of conveyance of the interest of
 the State of Iowa in and to those parts ly-
 ing within Illinois of said bridges to the
 State  of  Illinois  or  any  municipality   or
 agency thereof as may be authorized by or
 pursuant to law to accept the same, and
 thereafter the bridges shall be properly re-
 paired, reconstructed, maintained and oper-
 ated, free of tolls by the State of Iowa and
 by the State of Illinois, or any municipality
 or agency thereof, as may be agreed upon.
 SEC.  4. The interstate bridge or bridges
 purchased, constructed or completed under
 the authority of this Act and the Income
 derived therefrom shall, on and after the ef-
 fective date of this Act, be exempt from all
 Federal, State, municipal, and local property
 and income taxation.

 nuclear power than they do with fossil fuels.
 In the long run, the extensive public debates
 about nuclear power will seem secondary.
 There is no alternative to substantial use of
 nuclear power.
 Q. But right now there is a lively debate
 about the future availability of uranium with
 some people suggesting we won't have enough
 cheap uranium to fuel the nuclear plants
 we'll be building in the next 10 years.
 A. It's hard to anticipate just how long
 low-cost uranium reserves will last. The es-
 timates of uranium reserves in the United
 States are made on a quite conservative basis.
 Much of the world has not been explored,
 and even in the United States there are areas
 that have not been explored. There was a
 find recently along the Santa Fe Railway in
 New Mexico. I think we can count on having
 plenty of uranium to meet our needs.
 Eventually the price of uranium would be-
 gin to rise and then the economics of light
 water reactors would start to suffer. We would
 begin to run out of low-cost uranium, but
 that is where the fast breeder reactor would
 prove its merits, because the price of electric
 power in the breeder is essentially Insensi-
 tive to the price of uranium. The breeder will
 exploit about 70 per cent of the energy con-
 tent in uranium, whereas the light water
 reactors built today exploit only 1 per cent of
 the energy content. In fact, the breeder will
 permit us to use what is a major potential
 asset in the United States and that is the
 vast amounts of depleted uranium left over
 from our weapons program, which could fuel
 breeders for almost a century.
 Q. The United States has spent more than
 20 years and about $800 million on breeder
 research. The AEC is about to enter into a
 contract for the first breeder demonstration
 plant, which is to be located in the Tennessee
 Valley. When can the country expect to see
 commercial electricity from the breeder?
 A. President Nixon has indicated that we
 should have an operating "demo" plant by
 1980, and that continues to be our objec-
 tive. We will be very close to that and I hope
 we beat it. We've ironed out all the outstand-
 ing problems except for the site, which we're
 now looking at. There are four or five sites
 under consideration. There will be a second
 demo plant located outside the Tennessee
 Valley. Our best judgment is that the first
 commercial breeders would be coming in after
 1985.
 Q. Few Americans understand the concept
 of the fast breeder. Can you describe how it
 would work and can you discuss its safety
 aspects?
 A. The fast breeder is just what the name
 suggest. Fast or highly energetic neutrons
 are produced in the fission process, and are
 absorbed by the fertile uranium-238. The
 absorption of neutrons converts the urani-
 um-238 into plutonium-239, which can be
 used as fuel. We anticipate that in 10 years'
 time a fast breeder would produce twice as
 much fuel as was consumed.
 On the safety aspects, a better understand-
 ing seems to be developing. For example, the
 power densities will be about six times higher
 in the breeder than they are in the light water
 reactor. That means that if all of the coolant
 were lost from around the fuel, it is more
 difficult to dissipate the leftover heat to avoid
 melting the fuel. But in the breeder there is
 far less likelihood of losing the coolant even
 in the case of an instantaneous double-ended
 major pipe rupture. The reason is that liquid
 sodium is used to cool the hot reactor core
 instead of water. One of the most important
 things to remember about sodium as a reac-
 tor coolant is that its boiling point is about
 1,600 degrees F., and consequently it does not
 have to be pressurized like water. Because it
 won't be pressurized, one avoids any chance
 of a major loss-of-coolant accident through
 blow-doyen, when loss of pressure turns very
 hot cooling water instantaneously into steam.
 That can't happen with a liquid metal cool-
 ant, because the coolant won't be under
 significant pressure.
 It has been pointed out that hot sodium is
 tricky to handle, that it reacts rapidly on
 contact with air or moisture. The design calls
 for the steel coolant system to be surrounded
 by nitrogen, so that if there are leaks of
 sodium there won't be any serious reaction
 of the hot liquid metal with oxygen. I should
 also point out that liquid sodium is not a new
 coolant. We and others throughout the world
 have used it in reactor plants safely for over
 20 years. More than a dozen sodium-cooled
 reactors have operated over this period of
 time. Sodium has been used in the 1 BR-II
 fan experimental breeder reactor in Arco,
 Idaho] for over eight years, and it was used
 for three years as the coolant in the world's
 second nuclear submarine, the Seawolf
 Q. Once nuclear power becomes really big
 business the question of the disposal of
 radioactive wastes comes up. How does the
 AEC plan to store its wastes once the nuclear
 garbage begins to pile up?
 A. Since the quantities of accumulated
 wastes are small, we do not have to begin
 storming high-level wastes from the com-
 mercial power reactors in a separate reposi-
 tory until about 1960. What we plan to do is
 to develop surface storage facilities at the
 same time that we continue to investigate
 geologic storage in a variety of configura-
 tions. We have put off any decision to move
 into underground geologic storage because
 the decision seemed to be an irreversible one.
 There has been concern about the effects of
 the long-term dissipation of heat from the
 solid wastes on salt formations. There is also
 concern that once placed underground, the
 wastes could become Irretrievable. I think
 further experimentation will resolve these
 uncertainties, but until such time as these
 uncertainties are resolved we plan to have an
 acceptable  alternative-the  capability  for
 storing such high-level solid wastes safely
 above ground.
 One of the problems in salt storage is that
 you must dissipate heat by natural means in
 a relatively confined area, with the salt close-
 ly packed around the cylinders, where one
 would want to watch what the dissipated
 heat might do to the salt and to the other
 geologic structures adjoining the salt. At the
 surface we can use methods by which the
 heat is readily dissipated, we're able to cool
 the cylinders and we're able to watch them
 for leaks. We're also able to move these
 wastes from one storage vault to another or
 re-can them if a leak should occur. Don't
 forget, these wastes will be solifled. There
 will be no liquids to worry about.
 The amount of wastes will be very small
 when the waste storage program begins, no
 matter where we're putting it. A 1 million
 kilowatt plant will produce about a cubic
 meter of high-level waste per year. All of the
 high-level wastes that will be generated by
 the year 2000 will require no more than 30
 acres of total storage area, even if we store
 the wastes above ground.
 1DRUG TRAFFIC
 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from New York (Mr. WOLFF), is
 recognized for 5 minutes.
 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Speaker, this morn-
 ing the Bureau of Narcotics and Dan-
 gerous Drugs held a press conference to
 refute charges made in a syndicated col-
 umn yesterday that some 26 tons of
 opium destroyed by the Thai Govern-
 ment on March 7, 1972, may not have
 been entirely opium.
 At this press conference, it was ad-
 mitted for the first time that about
 $1 million of U.S. funds were spent for
 resettlement of certain KMT irregular
 forces in Thailand in connection with the
 so-called seizure of the 26 tons.
 I must strenuously protest the outright
 deception involved in the buying of this
 quantity of opium. No American or Thai
 official statement or any press dispatch
 ever mentioned that U.S. funds were in-
 volved in this so-called seizure which has
 been cited again and again by admin-
 istration spokesmen as evidence of Thai
 cooperation to halt the drug traffic.
 If the United States did buy up opium
 and see to it that it was destroyed, then
 the action might be defended. But, ac-
 cording to the BNDD, all we did was pay
 and inspect part of it before it was
 burned. Meanwhile, it was the Thais who
 collected it, tested it at the time of col-
 lection, and ultimately destroyed it.
 I had hoped that the BNDD might
 clear this matter up. However, all that
 has happened is that the new question of
 U.S. involvement in this case has sur-
 faced and the BNDD spokesman ad-
 mitted that he had not even read the
 official interagency report upon which
 the Anderson column had been based.
 Therefore, I renew my request for this
 additional documentation in this mat-
 ter so that we in the Foreign Affairs
 Committee may have the information
 available to   s for our study  and
 consideration.

 office.
 Q. The whole country talks as if the United
 States is in the midst of an energy crisis.
 The White House says it, the Congress says it
 and the press says it. What do you think?
 A. I would prefer to avoid the general term
 "crisis." Clearly we have a problem with re-
 gard to fuels. We have topped out, in terms
 of oil production in the lower 48 states, at
 about 10 million barrels a day. Assuming
 Alaska comes on, that will provide an addi-
 tional 2 million barrels a day. If you can-
 Bider prospective demands for 1980, it lies
 somewhere between 22 million and 28 million
 barrels a day. If one took the immediately
 prospective oil prices for 1972, and we're
 talking about importing as many as 16 mil-
 lion barrels a day in 1980, the cost of that
 would be in excess of $15 billion a year.
 The U.S. balance of payments is in a rather
 parlous condition, and it's not clear that
 additional outpayment of $15 billion a year
 for foreign oil is something we can support.
 And that is only assuming a static situation.
 The trend in oil prices is up, and one can
 anticipate they will continue upward. So
 that the burden on U.S. balance of pay-
 ments, unless we're able to substitute other
 fuels for oil, could be on the order of $30
 billion a year.
 Beyond the question of fuel supply, there
 is a seemingly chronic problem with respect
 to electric service reliability. In the near term,
 there has been concern regarding regional
 shortages of electric power supply with the
 resultant possibilities of brownouts and even
 blackouts.
 Q. Can we substitute gas and coal for oil?
 A. The further development of gas in siz-
 able amounts seems out of the question-at
 least until we have gas from Coal. The an-
 aual demand for gas could be greater than
 85 trillion cubic feet by 1980, but the supply
 we anticipate will be little if any in excess
 of the 22 trillion cubic feet we produce to-
 day. There can be some supplement from im-
 parted liquefied natural gas, but it will be
 limited. We have enough coal to go for a
 century or, more, but utilities have tended
 to shift away from coal because of its sulfur
 oxides and other pollutants. We have not
 developed a way of readily and economically
 getting rid of the sulfur in coal. There Is a
 fair amount of low-sulfur coal In the West,
 but it's fairly expensive to transport. We will
 require an extensive national effort either to
 achieve coal gasification or otherwise to con-
 vert the coal to a form where it can be used
 in abundance  within environmental  con-
 straints.
 Q. The country wants power, but it wants
 clean, cheap power. How can it go on getting
 clean, cheap power in view of the fuels crisis
 you've just described?
 A. The trend in power costs is upward. One
 reason it's upward Is the introduction of en-
 vironmental regulations. Another reason is
 the rising cost of fuel. As we clean up our
 fuels, as we prevent noxious combustion
 products from getting into the air, or as we
 limit the discharge of heat into the water,
 this will post money. Consequently, the price
 of power will rise but it  will  be  cleaner
 power.
 Q. How much more expensive will it be?
 A. The cost per kilowatt probably will be
 something like 40 per cent higher in 1980
 than it is today, largely reflecting the higher
 cost of construction, the rising cost of fuels
 and environmental requirements. Through
 greater efficiencies we hope to limit the rate
 of increase in power costs. How? The con-
 struction of a nuclear plant now requires on
 the order of eight years-in other countries
 half that time. If we can cut the time for
 construction, we can do much to limit the
 increase in the cost of power.
 Q. What happened to put this country in
 the fix it's in today with regard to energy?
 A. The driving force behind the problem
 has been the enormous increase in energy
 demand, so that we have outstripped our
 own oil production at the same time that en-
 vironmental considerations put limits on the
 strip mining of coal and the burning of coal.
 It all reflects the higher aspirations of Ameri-
 ca and it has all come together at the same
 time.
 Q. Do you think there was a lack of fore-
 sight in government and industry as far as
 anticipating the demand for power, anticipat.
 ing the environmental revolution and even
 in anticipating what could have been done
 in technology to offset the problems we have
 today?
 A. There is something in that, though, it's
 very difficult to anticipate a relatively sud-
 den development like the thrust toward .. .
 higher environmental standards. There have
 been new findings with regard to the physical
 and health impact of combustion products
 that have, I think, reinforced the esthetic or
 quality-of-life aspect of the environmental
 movement.
 Most of the technology you've referred to
 has primarily been the responsibility of in-
 dustry. The one exception was nuclear en-
 ergy. As a result of the government mo-
 nopoly in nuclear energy, the total energy
 research an  development budget for civil
 application  ended to be funded in a lop-
 sided  manner:  most  of  the  money  into
 nuclear, relatively little into other energy
 sources. We can see this in retrospect.
 One of the things you have to keep in
 mind is that the utility industry is a regu-
 lated industry, and even though it receives
 Impressive revenues, nearly $25 billion a year,
 it has rarely put significant money directly
 into  research  and  development.  This  is
 partly because it's  a regulated industry,
 partly because It's fragmented and partly
 because of reasons of its own historical per-
 spectives and its role relative to the manu-
 facturers. The utility industry should have
 been a major source of funding for tech-
 nology development but it has not been.
 However, we now see clear signs of change.
 Q. Congress has criticized the executive
 branch for scattering energy policy through-
 out as many as 61 federal agencies, which
 suggests that if the United States has an
 you would call a coherent energy policy?
 A. We need a far more coherent energy
 policy than we have at present. President
 Nixon's proposal for a Department of Nat-
 ural Resources would help solve these prob-
 lems, but I believe we should have review
 of our fuel policies in one place. At present,
 the Interior ;Department has responsibility
 for coal and oil, the AEC has responsibility
 for uranium, the Federal Power Commission
 licenses hydropower facilities and regulates
 the price of gas. I believe all these fuel poli-
 cies should be under one roof, so there can
 be a more consistent treatment of fuels. As
 a member of the executive branch, I would
 say that one of the problems there is, not
 only  the fragmentation of responsibilities
 within the Executive but the fragmentation
 of assignments on Capitol Hill. In some sense,
 that may be a more difficult problem to deal
 with than reorganization with the executive.
 Q. One aspect of our energy dilemma is the
 environmental movement, a movement that
 has forced considerable change on energy
 policy. What kind of impact do you think
 this movement has had-mostly positive or
 largely negative?
 A. In some respects it has aggravated the
 dilemma because environmental regulations
 limit the use of fuels and technologies, but
 I think that in the large It has focused at-
 tention on the energy problem and in the
 long run that focusing of attention may be
 more valuable than the short-run impedi-
 ments. Is it necessary for total energy de-
 mand to grow at a rate of 4-5 per cent a
 year? This is the fundamental issue that the
 environmental movement has raised, and it
 is a good issue. Of course, it can be said that
 a fair number of environmentalists have
 been rather contentious, but this should not
 distract attention from the movement's fun-
 damental contribution, which is to focus on
 what we can do about ever-growing energy
 use.
 Q. How much good or ill effect has the en-
 vironmental movement had on the atomic
 energy program in the United States?
 A. Well, a minority in the environmental
 movement just do not like nuclear energy.
 The primary reason may be a fear of the un-
 known-neophobia. But all in all, the en-
 vironmental movement  has made a major
 contribution to nuclear energy. The reason
 is quite clear-the chief advantage of nu-
 clear energy from an environmental stand-
 point is that there are no combustion prod-
 ucts and therefore essentially no air pollu-
 tion. There has been a push in the direction
 of nuclear power because of the low availabil-
 ity of fossil fuels that meet our environ-
 mental standards. I'm not sure that was the
 objective of the environmentalists, but that's
 the way it has worked out.
 Q. How can you say the environmentalists
 have  helped  nuclear  power  that  much?
 They've held up licensing permits on count-
 less nuclear plant projects, which doesn't
 seem like much help.
 A. Hearings by licensing boards have been
 far more extensive than necessary. Delaying
 tactics have been deliberately employed in
 some cases, and I don't believe that's in the
 public interest. However, we should all be
 careful  not  to  blame  environmentalists.
 Many plants, both fossil and nuclear, were
 behind schedule even before the upsurge of
 interest in   environmental  matters.  The
 schedule slippage of most nuclear plants is
 due to inadequate planning, the slow pace
 of construction, labor disputes, the late de-
 livery of equipment, and prolonged test pro-
 grams. There are a fair number of plants
 which have elicited no protests from environ-
 mentalists that are two or more years be-
 hind schedule. The United States has turned
 out to be a country of relatively low effi-
 ciency in the construction of nuclear power
 plants. Until we've improved our efficiency,
 per cent of all the electricity produced in
 the U.S. today, but is a growing fraction of
 the total. Could you tell us what your latest
 projections are for nuclear power?
 A. We're still projecting 25 per cent of
 total capacity in 1980 in nuclear plants. That
 would be approximately 150 million kilo-
 watts. Construction lags might slow it down.
 By 1990, our estimate rises to almost 50 per
 cent of total power, something on the order
 of 600 million kilowatts. Changes in national
 energy and fuel policy could speed that up.
 It is useful to reflect on those numbers.
 When the United States entered the Second
 World War, the generating capacity in the
 country was 42 million kilowatts. So the nu-
 clear power estimate for 1980 is almost four
 times the total generating capacity of the
 U.S. at the start of the Second World War.
 For the next few years, the annual additions
 to nuclear capacity will represent about 50
 per cent of all the power we had prior to
 World War II. Roughly 50 per cent of all the
 capacity being ordered today is nuclear and
 In the years ahead it will probably be closer
 to 65 per cent.
 One reason for hesitancy in ordering, nu-
 clear plants is the congestion in the regula-
 tory process, delays in hearings, delays in
 licensing. But despite these delays, I think
 utilities recognize that nuclear plants meet
 environmental standards and provide a ready
 source of fuel. They look to the future and
 they probably see fewer uncertainties with

 I As
 HON. PHILIP M. CRANE
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 7, 1972
 Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, recently the
 New York Times printed an article un-
 der the headline, "Asian Drug Inflow
 Found 'Greater Than Realized'." In the
 course of the article, which was a lengthy
 one-about 42 inches of copy-it devel-
 oped that the Bureau of Narcotics had
 concluded that the amount of high-
 quality heroin. being smuggled into this
 country from Southeast Asia is "greater
 than previously realized."
 I must say, Mr. Speaker, this an-
 nouncement comes as no revelation to a
 thinking person, except, perhaps, to the
 Bureau of Narcotics. I, for one, have al-
 Ways maintained that the drug flow from
 Red China, euphemistically referred to
 nowadays as "mainland China," was
 greater than publicly acknowledged.
 I also have a very brief, one-paragraph
 news note from the Washington Post of
 August 2, mentioning a $1 million haul
 of heroin in New York. Origin of the
 heroin? "Mainland China." The investi-
 gation leading to these arrests had been
 in progress for 3 months; no doubt there
 are similar ones still going on. I will not
 be surprized to hear in the next few
 months of similar drug traffic exposes,
 with a similar point of origin for the
 contraband.
 It is unrealistic to place most of the
 blame on Turkey and France for the tre-
 mendous influx of drugs into our coun-
 try. After all, what interest has Turkey
 in undermining the character of Amer-
 ica's citizens? Surely not the same in-
 terest that Red China, given her ideolog-
 ical  convictions,  has  in  weakening
 America. Red China is trying very hard,
 and so far, with great success, to utilize
 this most recent weapon in the "con-
 tinuous revolution" between the Com-
 munist world and the non-Communist
 world.
 It is no accident that the young men
 who go at their country's calling to fight
 a war in Southeast Asia are the ones
 frost vulnerable to the drug-plague and
 the ones hardest hit by it. It is no ac-
 cident, either, that our Government
 policy has low-keyed the Chinese role in
 the drug traffic-political and diplo-
 matic expediencies play their parts in
 the attempt to cast the blame on France
 and Turkey.
 I am encouraged that my first point
 has been acknowledged; how long will
 it be until the second one is recognized?
 Mr. Speaker, I insert two newspaper
 articles in the RECORD at this point:
 [From the New York Times, July 28, 1972]
 ASIAN DRUG INFLOW FOUND "GREATER THAN
 REALIZED"
 (By Seymour M. Hersh)
 WASHINGTON, July 27.-A secret analysis by
 the Government's top narcotics enforcement
 agency has concluded that the amount of
 high-quality heroin being smuggled into the
 United Stq$es from Southeast Asia "is greater
 than previously realized."
 The new Government report, compiled last
 month by the Strategic Intelligence Office of
 the  Bureau  of  Narcotics  and  Dangerous
 Drygs, further showed that narcotics-control
 personnel was beginning to accumulate evi-
 dence linking organized crime to the South-
 east Asian drug market.
 Another Government study, reported on
 in The New York Times on Monday, con-
 cluded that there was "no prospect" of halt-
 ing the drug flow from Southeast Asia into
 the United States. This Cabinet-level study
 was later discounted by the man who com-
 missioned it-Egil M. Krogh Jr., a special
 White House aide for narcotics matters.
 Mr. Krogh said "there has been substan-
 tial progress" in reducing the influx of drugs
 from Southeast Asia.
 The Narcotics Bureau report stated that
 "the traffic at present relatively unorganized,
 but has definite potential for expansion as
 a replacement for Turkish-French heroin."
 Officials  from  the  Central  Intelligence
 Agency, State Department, Narcotics Bureau
 and Defense Department "are presently re-
 viewing the international trade," the report
 added, "with particular focus on Southeast
 Asia as an alternate to the Middle East as a
 source of supply."
 WHITE HOUSE THINKS OTHERWISE
 Nixon Administration spokesmen have re-
 peatedly maintained publicly, in opposition
 to statements of critics, that heroin smuggled
 from Southeast Asia makes up only a small
 fraction of the total United States annual
 supply.
 Last month Nelson G. Gross, the State De-
 partment's senior adviser for international
 narcotics matters, told a Congressional hear-
 ing that t'the overwhelming majority of the
 heroin coming to the United States orig-
 inates in the Middle East and is processed in
 European laboratoriees before being smug-
 gled into our  country.  We  estimate that
 probably 5 per cent and certainly no more
 than 10 per cent of the heroin presently
 flowing into the United States originates in
 Southeast Asia."
 The Cabinet-level study, while completed
 last February, was at odds with Administra-
 tion thinking in its conclusions that there
 was "no prospect under any conditions that
 can realistically be projected, of stopping the
 drug' flow from Southeast Asia. It was im-
 mediately assailed by Mr. Krogh.
 Asked in an interview today about the
 Narcotics Bureau's analysis, Mr. Krogh ac-
 knowledged that "from what I've learned
 so far, -there has to be a strong likelihood"
 that organized crime is involved In the flow
 of heroin from Southeast Asia, but he added
 that the evidence was not yet conclusive.
 "STATISTICS ARE FLUID"
 He emphasized that the Administration
 set up its international narcotics program
 only 18 months ago. Because of this, he said,
 it would be "impossible" to estimate  ac-
 curately which area in the world was re-
 sponsible for which percentage of the heroin
 reaching the United States. "Statistics at
 this time are so fluid," he said.
 Other officials said that content of the
 bureau's analysis had been approved by that
 agency's  over-all intelligence board  before
 its dissemination inside the Government.
 The Narcotics Bureau, a Justice Depart-
 ment agency, Indicated in its study, made
 available today, that much of the growing
 amount of heroin from Southeast Asia was
 being smuggled into the United States by
 "essentially political Chinese entrepreneurs
 operating out of Laos, Thailand and Hong
 Kong. The heroin is sold to ethnic Chinese
 seamen, many of whom may be organized,
 who jump ship once their vessels dock in the
 United States.
 Further intelligence may "reveal more pre-
 cisely the role of Far East heroin in the
 United States," the document said, "and may
 reveal the substance of long-standing hither-
 to unverifiable reports of a 'Chinese-Corsi-
 can' connection between morphine base from
 the Orient and the chemical expertise of the
 Marseille area. Perhaps this preliminary re-
 port will stimulate interest in acquiring more
 data on the 'Chinese connection'." Morphine
 is another product of opium, which is ex-
 tracted from poppy seeds.
 Intelligence reports "over the past year
 indicate an increase in the number of ethnic
 Chinese who illegally enter the United States
 and Canada," the document said, adding that
 the volume and the pattern of techniques
 used in the delivery of narcotics were not
 sufficiently known.
 "However," the report said, the  bureau
 "views the amount as a serious and increas-
 ing threat."
 EIGHT CHINESE ARRESTED
 Government intelligence agencies recently
 set up a joint effort, known as Project Sea
 Wall, to stem the growing smuggling through
 United States and Canadian dock areas.
 Within a month of the program's initiation
 on April 7, the report said, eight ethnic Chi-
 nese were arrested, most of them carrying
 one to four pounds of high-quality heroin
 strapped to their bodies.

 HON. WILLIAM L. SPRING
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE
 Monday, August 7, 1972
 workers in the country are thinking
 about the coming campaign. An article
 in the Chicago Tribune of Sunday,
 August     6,  1972,  titled  "The  `New
 Politics' Is Out of Step" by Mike La?Velle
 of Cicero, Ill., covers this aspect of the
 coming campaign very clearly. Mike
 LaVelle is a laborer in a pipebending
 shop and a free lance writer. What does
 labor's rank and file think about these
 labor leaders and their decisions-mean-
 ing George Meany, president of the AFL-
 CIO and I. W. Abel, head of the United
 Steelworkers-when they said they would
 not endorse  GEORGE  MCGOVERN?  How
 does the blue-collar man view GEORGE
 MCGOVERN and his proposals? This is an
 interesting and well-written article by a
 blue-collar worker who seems to under-
 stand what the issues of his time are. I
 know my colleagues will enjoy reading
 it:
 THE "NEW POLITICS" IS OUT OF STEP
 (By Mike LaVelle)
 They drove out Johnson, defeated Hum-
 phrey, booted Daley, and now the "kids"
 have their very own candidate for the Presi-
 dency of these United States of America. We
 thought they had their noses buried in an
 underground newspaper and all the time it
 was a delegate tally sheet. The kids are work-
 ing within the system-"whoople" and "ba-
 loney."
 They have never been out of the system,
 they are of it and in it, in the quality and
 quantity of their lives, up to their eyebrows,
 and always have been.
 When a contemporary liberal affection-
 ately, always, affectionately uses the word
 "kids," I know who and what he means-
 the affluent and pampered children of the
 white-collar Left. The blue-collar Hells An-
 gels are hoodlums; the upper class Weather-
 men et al are idealistic "kids," who are never
 idealistic enough to demonstrate on campus
 for mine safet  after the live burials of their
 y
 five teachers, four business people, four law-
 yers, three writers, two bureaucrats, two edi-
 tors, two politicians, two homemakers, one
 social worker, one newspaper indexer, one
 retired Army officer, and one secretary. The
 delegation included the correct amount of
 women, blacks, and youth which all sounds
 very democratic on the surface but which
 deceptively is not so.
 McGovern claims a blue-collar electoral
 response to his primaries. Yet not a one of
 the Oregon delegates, black or white, sweats
 on a production line. So how could they ef-
 fectively represent me or my peers who do,
 even if they wanted to. My gut feeling is that
 they do not want to represent me.
 Of all the delegates at Miami, 39 per cent
 had postgraduate degrees, 31 per cent had
 family incomes over $25,000 a year, and the
 average income was $20,000 a year. I do not
 know the national average, but mine with
 a  nonworking  wife  and  two  children  is
 roughly $7,800 a year.
 So much for the much ballyhooed "New
 Politics" McGovern convention.

 NO CAREFREE SUMMERTIME
 There are no formal sabbaticals or carefree
 summertimes for blue-collar youth to flood
 the streets of America working for this or
 that political candidate or cause. Instead
 they are in factories, steel mills, mines, or
 Viet Nam in the noncampus, nonelite system
 as it is. They were definitely not in evidence
 among the McGovern delegates at Miami.
 Life magazine called the Oregon delegation
 to the Democratic convention "nearly per-
 fect" according to the McGovern reform
 rules. Using Oregon as representative of all
 the McGovern delegates at Miami, let's look
 at its 34 delegates. There were six students,

 If there is a sweetish odor in the air then
 one can safely assume that Harvard's eco-

 Govern. I'd strongly suggest that McGovern
 give these people a mythical candidate to
 play with and leave the real one alone.
 "In San Diego, I was campaigning at an

 The Left-Right, war-peace zeitgeist has so
 completely swung around in the last 35 years
 that the isolationist America Firsters from
 the 1930s must be spinning in their graves.

 One seizure, on April 11, resulted in the
 arrest of seven Chinese seamen carrying a
 total of 11 pounds of heroin, the bureau's
 report said. it added that "further informa-
 tion developed that this 11 pounds was part
 of a 100-pound shipment which originated
 in Bangkok and was evidently delivered by
 a European diplomat assigned to Thailand.
 Sensitive sources have revealed that more
 shipments, sponsored by other groups, are
 on the way; arrests are anticipated In the
 near future."
 Significantly, the report noted that "the
 smuggling  activities  of  Chinese  seamen
 imply a loose but rather extensive arrange-
 ment between the seamen and their United
 States contacts to carry out the movement
 of narcotics from Southeast Asia on a con-
 tinuing basis. These arrangements appear
 to involve some degree of organization at
 the receiving end and possibly at the send-
 ing end."
 The report listed docks in San Francisco,
 New York, Miami and Vancouver as areas
 with some degree of organized smuggling,
 but also said that high-quality Southeast
 Asian heroin had entered the United States
 through other ports-among them Seattle,
 Portland, New Orleans, Baltimore and Phila-
 delphia.
 The report contained a number of clues
 indicating that the amount of organized
 smuggling could be far higher than even
 now suspected.
 It cited the arrest of a Philippine diplomat
 late last year in New York City with about
 37 pounds of a brand of highly refined heroin
 known  as  "double  uoglobe."  It  was  the
 diplomat's third trip to the United States, the
 report said. "At least one previous time
 he was accompanied by a known Chinese
 heroin dealer in Bangkok."
 The "double uoglobe" heroin, manufac-
 tured in Laos, was widely sold to United
 States servicemen in South Vietnam in 1970
 and 1971.
 Administration's inability to interfere with
 the known large-scale smuggling of opium
 via  trawler  from  northern  Thailand  to
 refineries to Hong Kong and Malaysia.
 During testimony June 2 before a Senate
 subcommittee, Mr. McCoy, a Ph. D. candidate
 in Southeast  Asian history, testified that
 beginning in 1965 "members of the Florida-
 based Trafficante family of American orga-
 nized crime began appearing in Southeast
 Asia."
 Mr.  McCoy  specifically  named   Santo
 Trafficante Jr., whom he described as the
 heir to the international criminal syndicate
 established by Lucky Luciano and Meyer
 Lansky, as having traveled to Hong Kong
 and Saigon in 1968.
 "In 1967-68 there was evidence of increased
 activity on the part of Indochina's Corsican
 gangsters," he also stated. "United States
 agents observed Corsican hero' 'in traffickers
 commuting betwen Saigon and Marseilles,
 where the Corsicans control the clandestine
 heroin laboratories."
 Mr. McCoy then told the subcommittee
 that a former high-ranking C.I.A. agent in
 Saigon-subsequently  identified  as  retired
 Lieut. Col. Lucien Conein, who played a ma-
 jor role in South Vietnam for more than 10
 years-"told me in an interview that in 1969
 there was a summit meeting of Corsican crim-
 inals from Marseilles, Vientiane, and Phom-
 penh at Saigon's Continental hotel.
 Intelligence sources acknowledged in sub-
 sequent interviews that the Government be-
 gan studying the Southeast Asian narcotics
 trade less than two years ago, primarily in
 response to the rapid increase of G.I. ad-
 diction. In early 1971, the White House re-
 portedly ordered the C.I.A. to coordinate in-
 telligence efforts in the area.

 When Marquerite thought she was ready
 Even though she v. ';s very ill

 She prayed, prayed and prayed
 When over 2 years in bed she laid
 And only 69 pounds she weighed
 In 24 hours the Dr's to her parents said
 Marquerite Timper would be dead
 Completely unconscious-she was they
 thought
 But every single word she caught
 Doctor told the Mother to
 Prepare a bit of chicken stew
 But that very night
 Marquerite-ate not a-bite
 But had her nurse-Ruth Ward
 Send the first shut-in-card
 To lovely Irving Berlins wife
 Who also was fighting for her life
 Later many phone calls she made
 As more-strength she gained
 Then to add to peoples fun
 Various parties she did run
 For the lonely, Handicapped, and Aged
 Into volunteer services she waded
 All this time our member-Nelle
 Helped-Marquerite-to get well
 When Helen Puschnig--.again came
 She added her wisdom to the game
 Of bringing various joy to all
 For entertainment in-the-hall

 And of course are very dear
 But I lova you-all, so don't you fear

 at $50,000 for Mrs. Tam Chun, 41;  $5,000
 for her husband, Henry Chan Chun, and $20,-

 The case was assigned to Judge Constance
 Baker Motley, with no date set for trial. The

 MARKETING BUILDtW SIFTED
 At another point, the bureau's analysis
 said that "sensitive sources also reveal fre-
 quent                                  communications  between  Chinese
 heroin traffickers in New York, Seattle, San
 Francisco, Portland and Vancouver, suggest-
 ing that an extensive wholesale marketing
 mechanism exists or is being established."
 In recent years, United States narcotics
 officials have repeatedly said that 80 per cent
 of all heroin known to be consumed in the
 United States comes via Marseilles refineries
 from Turkey's opium-growing areas. Ten to
 15 per cent was said to come from Mexico.
 The bureau's report tended to support the
 position of the opium-growing in Turkey and
 other areas a prime goal of its antinarcotics
 drive. Officials now expect the opium produc-
 tion in Turkey to end this year.
 The Nixon Administration's leading critics
 of  the  Administration's  narcotics  drive-
 Representative Robert H. Steele, Republican
 of Connecticut, and Alvin W. McCoy, a Yale
 graduate student who has written an expose
 of the heroin traffic in Southeast Asia.
 When told of the bureau's report, Mr. Steele
 commented: "Vietnam is truly coming home
 to haunt us. No matter what they say, this
 means that the first wave of this material is
 already on its way to our children in high
 school."
 Mr. Steele, a first-term Representative who
 last year helped reveal the extent of heroin
 addiction among G.I: s in Vietnam, asserted
 that Narcotics Bureau attempts to stop
 smugglers from jumping ship or otherwise
 getting into the United States were mis-
 guided.
 "Instead of trying to put up this barrier,"
 Mr. Steele said, "it would be much more eco-
 nomical if we just went to our allies in
 Southeast Asia-to Thailand, where most of
 this stuff  comes from-and stopped the
 traffic there."

 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 7, 1972
 Mr. BIAGGI. Mr. Speaker, the debate
 continues to rage in this Congress and on
 the public platform, in an attempt to
 defii a and project America's defense
 priorities for the immediate future. Many
 observers have termed the coming Presi-
 dential election a crucial one, in terms of
 a decision by the American people be-
 tween widely diverse views of this Na-
 tion's role in the spectrum of world
 events.
 For the further general edification of
 my colleagues, I would like at this time
 to include in the RECORD the text of a
 recent statement on the subject by Mr.
 Geoffrey R. Simmonds, president of
 Simmonds Precision:
 CAN WE AFFORD To BE SECOND BEST?
 (By Geoffrey R. Simmonds)
 Since the end of the Korean War, the Unit-
 ed States has followed a "balance of power"
 strategy in an effort to-maintain world peace.
 The philosophy behind this strategy is that
 we can avoid a confrontation of world powers
 only if we maintain a constant military pos-
 ture equal to, or stronger than our potential
 enemies. This strategy is expensive. It is sup-
 ported by heavy expenditures in research and
 development and a strong financial commit-
 ment to advance military technology.
 The War in Southeast Asia has had an ef-
 fect on this balance of power that has gone
 largely unobserved by the American public.
 We have spent more than $150 billion of our
 national wealth in the day-to-day costs of
 maintaining the Vietnam War. As a result
 our financial resources have been strained
 and we have curtailed during this period, our
 research and development of new weapon sys-
 tems and advanced military hardware.
 In contrast, the Russians, since the Viet-
 nam War have taken advantage of our slow-
 down to embark on an airport technological
 development program aimed at global mili-
 tary supremacy. We can no longer rely on the
 "sour grapes" rationalization that our tech-
 nological quality is better than the Russians'
 quantity. The bare assumption of U.S. tech-
 nical superiority is no longer valid. Let me
 give you an example from the aircraft indus-
 try. The U.S. Air Force is developing an ad-
 vanced variable -geometry strategic bomber,
 the B-1, which is scheduled to fly three years
 from now. The Russian equivalent of the B-1
 is the "Backfire" strategic bomber. Three of
 them are flying now ... and there are more
 on the way.
 Another example is the new Russian MIG-
 23 "Foxbat" twin-jet, all weather fighter. This
 is a Mach 3 aircraft that out-performs in
 speed and altitude anything we now have in
 service or on the drawing boards. The Grum-
 man F-14 Navy variable wing fighter aircraft
 is scheduled to be operational with the fleet
 in 1973, and the McDonnell Douglas F-15
 is Scheduled for service with the Air Force in
 the mid-70s. Both are rated at Mach 2+.

 al posture in today
 s
 changing world. At the end of World War II,
 the U.S. had the most modern and efficient
 industrial complex in the world. A large in-
 vestment in plant and equipment permitted
 high wages, provided high productivity, and
 gave us the assurance that we could sell our
 HON. RICHARD G. SHOUP
 products  competitively  anywhere  in  the
 world.
 Now, times have changed. Both our friends
 and our former enemies-partly with Ameri-
 can taxpayers' money-have completely re-
 built their war-torn industries. They control
 industrial plants that are, relatively speak-
 ing, more modern and productive than ours.
 It is interesting to compare the produc-
 tivity of $100 in 1970 wages in a few selected
 countries. A Japanese company gets more
 than 100 hours of work for each $100 of wages.
 Compared with that, a French, German or
 British company will get about 50 hours of
 work. For the same wages, an American com-
 pany gets only 25 hours of work. It is obvious
 that we must be four times as efficient to
 compete with the Japanese. And we have seen
 the results: imported products at prices well
 below domestic levels.
 In one of our main markets, aerospace, the
 European governments together have com-
 mitted $4 billion in taxpayers' money to the
 development by private companies of com-
 mercial aircraft. In this way, four different
 commercial aircraft will be developed. The
 governments and the companies intend to
 capture the lion's share of a $30 billion mar-
 ket.
 It is against the traditions of the U.S. free
 enterprise system to use public money for
 commercial development. European govern-
 ments, on the other hand, have already come
 to grips with the fact that private industry
 simply cannot finance the sky-rocketing costs
 of advanced technology. They consider the
 "national interest" to include healthy tech-
 nological development of industries such as
 aerospace computers, atomic energy and elec-
 tronics, and they have decided to use public
 money for these purposes. Over the next few
 years, we in the U.S. will be faced with the
 same decision.

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 7, 1972
 Mr. SHOUP. Mr. Speaker, a number of
 my constituents have expressed their
 concern for the attitude in Congress to-
 ward young adults. I have assured them
 that I, along with a great number of my
 colleagues, believe that young adults
 must be represented as individuals and
 must share equally as citizens the privi-
 leges and responsibilities of our society.
 The future of our country lies in creating
 job opportunities for our youth, and that
 all youth should have the chance to bet-
 ter themselves through vo-tech or college
 training.
 I feel the following list of bills is of the
 type we have and should continue to act
 on:
 H.R. 6531. Provided incentives for building
 a volunteer Army thereby eliminating need
 for draft.
 H.R. Res. 223. Amended U.S. Constitution
 to lower voting age to 18 years.
 H.R. 12596. Coordinates all of the Federal
 agencies connected with the drug abuse prob-
 lem into a Special Office for Prevention of
 Drug Abuse.
 H. Res. 739. Expanded Federal Student In-
 tern Program to interns for employment dur-
 ing the summer months.
 H.R.7352. Establishes an Institute for col-
 lecting information on and training officials
 for the treatment and control of juvenile
 offenders.
 H.R. 11112. Provides individual income tax
 deductions for Vo-Tech and other higher

 THE`-PEK  G CONNECTION: COM-
 MUNIST CHINA AND THE NAR-
 COTICS TRADE
 (Mr. WAGGONNER asked and was
 given permission to extend his remarks
 at this point in the RECORD and to include
 extraneous matter.)
 Mr.  WAGGONNER.  Mr.  Speaker,
 many of us here in the Congress are
 worried by the amount of drugs that
 make their way into our country from
 many nations abroad. We all know and
 have read of the dangerous drugs that
 make their way here from Turkey, Mex-
 ico and other nations, but little is being
 said by this administration about the
 drugs that are being produced and clan-
 destinely brought into the United States
 from Communist China.
 Recently I came upon an extensive
 study which calls on our government to
 make a "fair, thorough and objective
 examination" of the amount of danger-
 ous drugs making their way on the Amer-
 ican market from mainland China.
 This 36-page study, commissioned by
 The Committee For A Free China and
 written by Allan C. Brownfeld, colum-
 nist, author, lecturer and winner of a
 a           Wall  Street  Journal  Foundation
 Award, cites authoritative United States,
 Soviet, Dutch, Argentinian, Republic of
 China,  Egyptian,  British,         Japanese,
 Hong Kong, Filipino and German sources
 for its conclusions.
 The study titled, "The Peking Connec-
 tion: Communist China and the Nar-
 cotics Trade," concludes:
 If our society is serious about putting an
 end to the flow of narcotics into our cities
 and into our military installations abroad,
 we must, initially, determine precisely who
 it is that is producing and marketing the
 drugs involved. The evidence, as we have
 seen, indicates that the government of Com-
 munist China bears a large portion of the
 responsibility.
 "The Peking Connection" states that
 in the face of such far-reaching substan-
 tive evidence, the U.S. Government "re-
 fuses to name Communist China a sus-
 pect, if not an active participant, in the
 narcotics traffic." It asserts:
 What is most exasperating is the burden
 of proof now falls on those who have ac-
 cepted at face value years of official assertion
 by the Executive Branch of Government that
 Red China was in fact engaged in the drug
 traffic.
 The study asks:
 Should it not be the obligation and re-
 sponsibility of the government of the United
 States-faced with a mountain of incriminat-
 ing evidence-to prove or disprove the valid-
 ity of Red China's involvement in narcotics
 trafficking?
 Among the many citations are:
 Chou En-lai's statement to Egyptian
 President Nasser. that-

 Institution asserting:
 Between two-thirds and four-fifths of the
 high grade heroin sold on the international
 market is and can only be supplied by main-
 land China.

 New York, saying:
 There is reason to believe that opium

 presented by Harry J. Anslinger, the material
 put  together  by  Professor  Turnbull,  the

 to have made little impression upon the rest
 of official Washington at the executive level.

 THE PEKING CONNECTION: COMMUNIST CHINA
 AND THE NARCOTICS TRADE
 (By Allan C. Brownfield)
 FOREWORD
 It has been said in recent days that the
 fight against  narcotics  addiction  is  the
 nation's number one domestic priority.
 Thousands of                                servicemen  are  returning
 from Vietnam with drug problems, and these
 newly returned addicts are fueling an already
 serious situation in our cities.
 There is significant evidence leading to the
 conclusion that Communist China is one of
 the primary sources of the opium which is
 then refined into heroin to which Americans
 in Southeast Asia have been subjected.
 In 1965, for example, the Egyptian pub-
 lisher and longtime confidant of the late
 President Nasser, Mohammed Heikal, quoted
 Communist China's Premier, Chou En-lai, as
 stating that, "The more troops the U.S. sends
 to Vietnam, the happier we shall be, for we
 feel we shall have them in our power, we can
 have their blood ... Some of the American
 soldiers are trying opium, and we are helping
 them. We are planting the best kinds of
 opium especially for Americans."
 After an extensive study of the drugs

 H 7904                    CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE          August 17, 1972
 coming into the American and world mar-
 kets, Professor Stefan T. Possony of the
 Hoover Institution at Stanford University,
 declared in November, 1971 that, "Between
 two-thirds and four-fifths of the high grade
 heroin sold on the international market is
 and  can  only  be  supplied  by  mainland
 China     . The heroin offensive appears to
 have accelerated in 1965."
 Although few Americans are aware of the
 fact, our own government placed a formal
 complaint before the United Nations in 1955
 concerning the opium being produced in
 Yunnan Province by the Communist Chinese
 government. Since 1955 it appears that Com-
 munist Chinese efforts in this field have in-
 creased dramatically.
 Yet today, at a time when the United
 States Government repeatedly declares its
 commitment to end the illegal traffic in
 narcotics, it refuses to seriously consider the
 role being played in the drug traffic by the
 government of Communist China.
 In fact, one is led to the conclusion that
 the Administration places the entire burden
 of proof regarding Red China's involvement
 in the dope trade on the shoulders of Ameri-
 can citizens who are deeply concerned about
 this narcotics traffic.
 The Committee For A Free China takes
 on this task only because we anxiously seek
 the truth, and we do not wish to see the
 realities of something as horrifying as nar-
 cotics proliferation swept under the pro-
 verbial rug.
 Discussing  the  effort by White House
 spokesmen to end all consideration of the
 role of Communist China in the drug mar-
 ket, columnist Jack Anderson wrote in the
 Washington Post of May 26, 1972:
 "In an unusually conciliatory move to-
 ward Peking, the White House is vigorously
 mobilizing the administration to fight what
 it calls 'arrant nonsense' about Red China's
 role in world dope trafficking.
 "The White House gesture toward Mao
 Tse-tung comes even as President Nixon is
 wooing Mao's arch-rival in the Communist
 world, Soviet Party head Leonid Brezhnev.
 "A White House memo contains evidence
 that Richard Nixon, once the implacable foe
 of  Communist  China,  is  now defending
 China. The memo was circulated quietly to
 the  Departments  of  State,  Defense  and
 Treasury, and the U.S. Information Agency.
 "The memo urges them to fight 'propa-
 ganda' against Red China. Included with
 the memo is a two-page briefing paper pre-
 pared by the federal intelligence agencies
 on. Red China and opium."
 The two-page briefing paper, according to
 columinst Anderson, contends that a "per-
 sistent propaganda campaign . . . is being
 promoted in this country by a number of
 groups who have consistently opposed nor-
 malization of relations between the U.S. and
 the PRC    . no evidence has yet been pro-
 duced to indicate any attempt on the part
 of Peking to introduce opium or heroin into
 Vietnam."
 The White House also maintains, without
 providing any evidence of its own, that China
 strictly controls opium production. Ander-
 son states that "Even in the old opium belts
 of Yunnan Providence, states the briefing
 paper, there is no 'significant illicit cross-
 border movements' to the outside world."
 The White House approach to this ques-
 tion is not only "unusually conciliatory," as
 columnist Anderson noted; it also overlooks
 the real evidence which is available, both
 with regard to Communist China's acknowl-
 edged past history in narcotics production
 as well as its current role.
 The Committee For A Free China com-
 missioned Allan C. Brownfeld, columnist,
 author,  lecturer  and  recipient  of a Wall
 Street Journal Foundation award, to review
 all of the available literature in this field,
 as well as to talk with experts in this country
 and in the Far East, including Hong Kong,
 long known as a major port of entry for nar-
 cotics. The conclusions drawn in Mr. Brown-
 feld's study are at variance with the con-
 clusions drawn by the White House, whose
 conclusions appear to be political and un-
 related to the real story of the production
 of and traffic in narcotics engaged in by the
 government of Communist China.
 It is clear that in any instance where the
 machinations of a totalitarian government
 are at work, it is not possible to know in
 detail all of the internal and external prac-
 tices engaged in by that government. To
 say that we do not know all there is to know
 about this subject is obvious. But what we
 do know certainly merits an investigation.
 The evidence which is available leads not to
 the exoneration of Communist China, but
 to its conviction.
 The facts, however, must speak for them-
 selves. They, and not political rhetoric, will
 lead to a solution of the drug problem which
 all of us say we want to solve, but which
 some seem to be aiding and abetting by per-
 mitting other goals to stand in the way of a
 thorough  exploration  of  the  world  as  it
 really is.-The Committee For A Free China,
 June, 1972.
 On March 20, 1972, President Nixon called
 drug abuse the nation's "Number One domes-
 tic problem" and said that despite the need
 to save money "this is one area where we can-
 not have budget cuts."
 The Washington Post declared that the
 President's statement concerning narcotics
 included "some of the strongest language he
 has used about drug abuse." The President
 said that the heroin pusher is worse than a
 murderer or burglar because what he does
 "strikes at the very heart of the society in
 which we live."
 In our efforts to prevent narcotics from
 entering the country we have taken action
 in Turkey, in France and elsewhere in the
 world to see that narcotics traffic is stopped at
 its source.
 Yet, despite our efforts, narcotics addiction
 increases, both within our own country and
 among American servicemen in Vietnam and
 elsewhere in Southeast Asia. In addition, the
 flow of narcotics is heavier than ever before
 despite the fact that new restrictions have
 been imposed on the previously identified
 main  sources  of  raw  opium from  which
 heroin is produced, namely Turkey and Iran.
 In recent days there has been much dis-
 cussion about the possible role played in the
 production and distribution of narcotics by
 the Communist Chinese government.
 .Many and diverse spokesmen-journalists,
 political leaders, academicans-have declared
 that Communist China is deeply involved in
 the drug traffic, and is using this traffic for
 the twofold purpose cf gaining foreign ex-
 change  and  subverting  both  American
 servicemen and non-Communist Asian socie-
 ties.
 Let us consider some of the statements
 which have been made on this subject.
 Speaking on the C.B.S. radio network on
 February 23, 1972, commentator Jeffrey St.
 John declared that "Ever since the establish-
 ment of the Reds on the China mainland
 they have been actively involved in drugs.
 However, it has only been in recent years
 that narcotics have served a specific ideo-
 logical end, coinciding with the mushroom-
 ing of the drug problem in Western nations
 like the United States."
 Testifying before a Congressional commit-
 tee in July, 1971, Dr. Robert Baird, a New
 York drug expert with 24 years in the field
 of drug addiction, contended that the Chi-
 nese Communists are now preparing to use
 drugs to demoralize the American popula-
 tion, especially young people, and for ideo-
 logical purposes. Dr. Baird declared that we
 are being misled into thinking that Turkey
 is the primary source of narcotics, and he
 estimated that Communist China produces
 55 to 60 percent of the world's hard drugs.
 In a report in October 1971, to the House
 Foreign  Affairs  Committee  entitled,  "The
 International Narcotics Trade and Its Rela-
 tion to the United States," Rep. Seymour
 Halpern (R-New York) stated that "... there
 is reason to believe that opium produced in
 Communist China, particularly in the Yun-
 nan Province, does enter the Golden Tri-
 angle-Burma, Thailand, Laos-drug conduit
 in Southeast Asia."
 Rep. Halpern noted that "It has been dif-
 ficult, because of China's great wall of isola-
 tion, to document the extent of her opium
 production in relation to her own consump-
 tion and to her medicinal requirements. Sev-
 eral experts have estimated, however, that
 the minimal medical need for her huge popu-
 lation would require about 100 tons of opium
 production per year. It is known that the
 People's Republic of China has the capacity
 for  large  cultivation,  particularly  in  the
 Southern provinces.       . There have been
 numerous rumors that a good portion of
 China's vast crop finds its way into illicit
 channels."
 The Washington Report of the American
 Security Council for January 13, 1972 re-
 ported that Hong Kong police have stated
 that illegal drugs smuggled out of Commu-
 nist China and bound for the Free World in-
 creased nearly 1,000 percent in 1971, most of
 it in opium, the raw material from which
 heroin is made. Police in Hong Kong seized
 12,600 pounds of opium last year, as com-
 pared with only 877 pounds in 1970.
 Rep. Philip M. Crane (R-Illinois)  stated
 on April 12 that "At a time when there is a
 euphoric feeling that peace may be at hand
 with the Communist Chinese, a feeling not
 borne out by the fact that the Peking gov-
 ernment continues to sponsor subversion and
 terror throughout Asia, one important ques-
 tion remains unanswered and, to a large
 measure, unasked. That question is this: how
 involved is Communist China in the flow of
 narcotics in Southeast Asia, and elsewhere
 in the world?"
 Citing the available evidence, Rep. Crane
 concluded that, "At a time when thousands
 of young Americans, particularly servicemen
 in Vietnam, are becoming addicted to heroin
 and other dangerous drugs, it is incumbent
 upon our government, if it is sincere in its
 desire to stem the tide of such drugs, to in-
 vestigate the possible involvement of Com-
 munist China in their production and dis-
 tribution."
 A report published in England in April,
 1972 declared that "The Chinese Communist
 government exports illicitly 2,000 tons of
 opium a year to the non-Communist world."
 Prepared by James Turnbull, Professor of
 Applied Science at Britain's Royal Military
 College of Science, the report states that "The
 annual sales are estimated to be worth $600
 million to Peking."
 Professor Turnbull writes that "The covert
 dissemination of opium narcotics, in particu-
 lar the addictive drug heroin, for commercial
 and subversive purposes represents one of the
 gravest threats to the armed services and
 societies of the free world."
 Published by the Foreign Affairs Publish-
 ing Company, Ltd., this report includes a
 foreword by a Conservative member of Par-
 liament, Geoffrey Stewart-Smith, who writes:
 "James Turnbull has produced a devastating
 exposure of the way in which the allegedly
 'trustworthy' Chinese People's Republic is
 carrying out a massive secret chemical war-
 fare strategy by exporting opium and heroin
 to the non-Communist world. In view of the
 growth of drug taking in Eastern Europe, it
 Is possible that the Chinese Communists are
 doing the same thing to their 'fraternal'
 Communist states there too."

 The hesitancy is something new. In 1963,
 for example, U.S. Narcotics Commissioner
 Henry Giordano charged that "The Red Chi-
 nese are extensively engaged in drug traffic."
 Others in Asia have made the same charge.
 The Chairman of the Japanese National Com-
 mittee for Struggle Against Drug Addiction
 stated in 1964 that "Peking has become the
 world's principal producer of opium poppies
 which yield opium., morphine, and heroin."
 The  Prime  Minister  of  Thailand  accused
 Peking of flooding that nation,with narcotics.
 In Hong Kong, a doctor at the anti-narcotic
 center stated, "There are upwards of a half

 THE NEED FOR BETTER REGTJLA-
 TION OF "PRIVATE CLUBS" IN
 NEW YORK CITY
 (Mr. KOCH asked and was given per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. KOCH. Mr. Speaker, I would like
 to bring to the attention of my colleagues
 a situation in my congressional district
 which illustrates how necessary it is,
 that in our zeal to protect the civil
 rights of the individual, we remember
 that the public also has civil rights
 which must be guarded.
 On Manhattan's east side and in
 Greenwich Village there has been a re-,
 cent proliferation of bars and so-called
 private-after-hours clubs which operate
 as centers for drug trafficking. The Tam-
 bourine bar on-East 81st Street is an
 alleged example of this type of bar. But
 whether chartered as private clubs or
 not, these places are taking advantage
 of a laxity in our laws and are creat-
 ing, with virtual impunity, not only a
 public nuisance but a public danger.
 Constituents of mine living near these
 bars  are  rightfully  angered  and
 frightened. Their streets are crowded
 with people who are obviously "stoned,"
 and assaults, stabbings, and shootings
 take place in and around some of these
 places.
 These clubs are cancers spreading
 crime and infecting otherwise decent
 neighborhoods.  The police have  re-
 sponded as best they can to all com-
 plaints but they cannot close these
 places down. They and other local au-
 thorities are forced to resort to the in-
 effectual issuance of summonses for
 petty violations; but business is woefully
 good, and the owners simply remove vio-
 lations, pay the fines and continue
 operations.
 Because some of these places are in-
 volved in illegal drug dealings and prob-
 ably linked to organized crime, I have
 asked the Federal Joint Task Force to
 investigate several of them. But clearly
 there needs to be a method of continual
 local law enforcement supervision. The
 State liquor authority has the legal power

 I
 to close down any establishment where
 liquor is served if it is found to be a public
 nuisance, but has failed to exercise suffi-
 cient initiative to protect the public from
 the menance these bars have become.
 The State liquor authority must do
 more than check occasionally to see if
 the gin is watered. It must actively and
 continually monitor the social impact
 that any bar has on the community, so
 that it can move quickly to revoke the
 bar's license if it is proven at a hearing
 to be a source of public disorder. If State
 legislation is needed to accelerate the
 administrative and court appeal pro-
 cedures during which one of these bars
 might be able to stay open, then we must
 have that legislation. At the present it
 is only after long delay, after the situa-
 tion becomes intolerable, that the SLA
 begins to act.
 In the case of privately chartered clubs
 where no liquor is served-and many of
 those are not private at all but profit-
 making businesses-legislation placing
 them under the city's department of
 consumer affairs for licensing is needed,
 thus allowing the department's inspec-
 tors to enter the premises for periodic
 inspection.
 Obviously the right of any individual
 to assemble in private with others hav-
 ing a common interest must not be
 abridged. But we must also recognize the
 right of the public to live in a decent
 safe community, and when the bars and
 so-called private clubs threaten that
 right, then there must be adequate con-
 trols to protect the public.

 DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL
 FINANCIAL ASSETS
 (Mr. VAN DEERLIN asked and was
 given permission to extend his remarks
 at this point in the RECORD.)
 Mr. VAN DEERLIN. Mr. Speaker, I
 have made it a policy, before each gen-
 eral election campaign, to submit for
 the RECORD a full public disclosure ofmy
 personal financial assets.
 I intend this as no reflection on Mem-
 bers who do not choose to make such dis-
 closure. The law requires only the finan-
 cial statements which all of us file with
 the House Committee on Ethics.
 However, those statements are limited
 in scope, and portions are sealed from
 public scrutiny except under exceptional
 circumstances. I continue to feel that the
 people of my district are entitled to know
 whether I, as my party's nominee for a
 2-year term in Congress, am free of fi-
 nancial ties which might influence my
 actions as their representative.

 and/or State tax forms are available for

 CHERNOFF TO THE RESCUE
 (Mr. VAN DEERLIN asked and was
 i
 g
 ven permission to extend his remarks
 at this point in the RECORD.)
 Mr. VAN DEERLIN. Mr. Speaker, we
 have been hearing much this week about
 the troubles of the American Revolution
 Bicentennial Commission. In the wake of
 disclosures published by the Washington
 Post,. a bill continuing the Commission's
 funding  authorization  was  removed
 rather suddenly from the House calen-
 dar, with the implicit hope that new pro-
 visions can be inserted to pull this agency
 out of its tailspin..
 As ;one who would like to see the com-
 mission succeed, in putting on a 200th
 birthday party which will reflect the
 values and aspirations of the widest pos-
 sible cross section of our populace, I
 would like to offer one suggestion.
 MY proposal is prompted by a letter
 sent last January by Jack LeVant, then
 the Commission's executive director, to
 David G. Mahoney, its chairman.
 In this letter, text of which is found
 on page S13681-513682 of yesterday's
 RECORD, Mr. LeVant states that the
 Commission would succeed if it were a
 "
 one-man show," free of undue, inter-
 ference from outsiders and with a co-
 llesive staff.
 Mr. LeVant goes on to say that a
 Perfect example of one-man control is that
 of Osaka and our friend Howard Chernoff.
 Now as it happens, Mr. Chernoff, a fel-
 low resident of San Diego, is also an old
 friend of mine. He has rendered dis-
 tinguished service under two administra-
 tions-first as a top aide to the USIA di-
 rector in the Johnson administration and
 more recently, under President Nixon

 He placed before the President on a "take 1971,  I  introduced  H.R.  6168  which

 also earned the praise of no less a judge pending in the Select Education Subcom-

 All of which leads to a rather obvious
 conclusion.
 Why not follow through on Mr. Le-
 Vant's warm endorsement, by naming
 Mr. Chernoff as the top man in the
 American Revolution Bicentennial Com-
 mission?
 I am convinced Howard would be just
 as efficient in handling the bicentennial
 bureaucracy as he was in shaking up the
 international trade paper shuftlers and

 different reasons, exists in
 Burma,  the  largest  opium

 Reflecting in acid words the
 problem of interesting other
 nations In the drug fight, the
 report said efforts to develop
 international narcotics polic-
 ing organizations have been
 hampered "largely because of
 widely varying national atti-
 tudes toward the drug prob-
 lem."
 These differences, it said,
 "are regularly and skillfully.
 exploited by the illicit interna-
 tional traffickers."
 The cabinet study detailed a
 number of international smug-
 gling routes. The "direct Eu-
 rope-United States route is the
 oldest"   French   smuggling
 route and remains the most
 active." This pathway is at-
 tractive, the study said, partly
 because it avoids the nerd for
 a  foreign  middleman    and
 partly because opium is more
 readily concealed in the large
 volume of trans-Atlantic com-
 merce, involving only one cus-
 toms inspection.

 About 80 per cent of the

 ing  Office  analyzed  drug

 abuse by U.S. military person-
 nel in Vietnam, Okinawa, the
 Philippines, Europe and the
 Continental United States.
 Of Vietnam, it said: "Until
 the fourth quarter of calendar
 year 1970, drug abuse among
 military personnel in Vietnam
 was primarily limited to mari- i
 juana. At that time, the use of
 heroin began to rise and has
 now  become  the  military's
 most serious drug problem in
 Vietnam ... Drugs were rela-
 tively cheap; a .25 gram-vial of
 heroin 94 to 97 per cent pure
 could be purchased for $2.50
 to $10 a vial. This compares to
 a stateside price of about $20
 for a similar quantity that is
 only 4 to 12 per cent pure her-

 '
 signifi-
 lomats and secret agents have been
 cantly involved in the narcotics traffic in
 Burma, The CIA, upon learning something
 `of the. content of thew bpok, apparently de-
 cided that it had cause for the expression of
 some concern. As a result, the author al-
 leges, the agency resorted to "extralegal
 meaPies"such as' CIA visits, to, the nub- calls and letters in an at-
 Eeapt "to harass and intimidate me and my
 publisher."
 I arty not conceriigst with the accuyacy
 of Mr. McCoy's text or his methods of schol-
 arship. I do, however, wonder about the way
 in, which the government expressed its inter-
 e'st in his work. Whether. there were visits
 to the publisher or ..phone calls, as Mr.
 McCoy alleges, is not the point. It is clear
 that the general counsel of the CIA,wrote
 a d ' asked !to see the, book prior to publi-
 catlon.. While he dgned that the agency's
 interest affected in any way the publisher's
 right to publish, the general counsel went
 oii to apply some heavy pressure, saying
 "it is our belief that no reputable publish-
 jug house would wish to publish such alle-

 tests, the publisher decided to submit the . pre-publication restraints on the words and
 bob for an unusual pre-publication review    idea8-the rIt ipnc ni this c imtry are to read

 pernicious. While disclaiming any intention
 to inhibit publication, the agency suggested
 more than once that no reputable or respon-
 sible publisher would want to publish a book
 without first validating the facts. And then
 the agency offered itself as chief validator. I
 am not sure whether the publisher needed
 to go as far as submitting the galley proofs
 of the book to the CIA for pre-publication
 review in order to ascertain the agency's
 views or whether, indeed, that decision was
 entirely wise. But to its credit, Harper &
 Row resisted the pressures and retained the
 ultimate publishing judgment.
 THAT IS all to the good, for the CIA, in
 offering its services as ultimate validator of
 the author's source material, was dangling
 a lure that leads down the path to acquies-
 cence in censorship. If Clifford Irving's caper
 taught us anything, it was that the pub-
 lisher has ultimate responsibility for check-
 ing the validity of the material he proposes
 to publish. It is clear that the publisher,
 upon learning that serious questions have
 been raised about the reliability of material
 it has on hand, should at least talk the ques-
 tions over with any responsible doubter.
 But finally, the responsibility rests with
 the publisher, it cannot and should not be
 shifted to any other party, particularly not
 to a secret agency of the government. Any ,
 other course would lead, to the erosion of a
 publisher's most precious right, the first
 amendment right of free speech, which is
 his only guarantee of his ability to promote
 the  free flow of information and ideas
 throughout society, and our only guarantee
 as well.

 - That drug smuggling is not a -problem

 that a sipment of the Double U-O Globe
 brand, _ a' bulk heroinn manufactured in the
 ro       np1e2 was `seized In an amount
 q4,        the police`to be worth $3.5-
 serving in Vietnam were heroin users."
 The politics of heroin-and in this book
 the emphasis is on the politics-is an art-
 ful one. Mr. McCoy cites the case of Ngo
 Dinh Nhu, brother of President Ngo Dinh
 Diem of South Vietnam, later murdered by
 his colleagues. During his brother's regime
 Nhu was head of the secret police and
 had set up a close apparatus of spies, in-
 formers and agents. He was so successful
 in harassing the National Liberation Front,
 the political arm of the Vietcong, that
 after he and Diem were killed, Nguyen
 Huu Tho, chairman of the N.L.F., told an
 Australian journalist that Nhu's demise
 was "a gift from heaven."
 Closed and Open Opium Dens
 The point the author makes, though, is
 that to keep the members of this network
 loyal took a great deal of money and that
 the only way Nhu could get it was from
 the drug trade. Diem had entered on his
 presidency determined to close down the
 opium shops, the author says, but the
 profit from the drug trade was so great
 that his brother restored it and used the
 money to harass the Communists.
 Gen. Tuan Shi-wen, commander of the
 Chinese Nationalist Fifth Army, based in
 the Golden Triangle, put the matter suc-
 cinctly. He is quoted in the book as having
 said, "We have to continue to fight the
 evil of Communism, and to fight you must
 have an army, and an army must have
 guns, and to buy guns you must have
 money. In these mountains the only money
 is opium."
 For the most part, Mr. McCoy demon-
 strates, an illicit drug traffic is carried on
 for the personal benefit and dollar profit of
 individuals, including some of the highest
 ranking officials with whom we do busi-
 ness in Southeast Asia. The picture of cor-
 ruption that he draws, of cruel and naked
 jockeying for power, of bloodletting and
 cynical maneuvering with underworld ped-
 dlers, is so strongly documented that it
 might make even the stanchest defender
 of the war in Southeast Asia wonder if
 it is worth it.
 The attitude of too many American offi-
 cials, he says, is one of "embarrassment
 and apathy." They argue that their job is
 to fight the North Vietnamese and kill
 Communists and nothing else concerns
 them.   is moral neutralit  is so wide-.
 e" n erworld in Southeast Asia, the
 book makes clear, as in the Middle East,
 in Western Europe, in America, has always
 been an essential part of the trade. Its
 members have the advantage of being free
 of ideology. They worked with Socialists
 in Marseilles, with the Gestapo under
 Vichy, with the American liberating forces
