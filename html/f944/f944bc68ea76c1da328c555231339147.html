 Syria-Israel
 MAKING ASAD HAPPY IN MOSCOW
 The Soviets rolled out the red carpet for
 Syri President Asad and opened the Kremlin's
 coffers a little wider in a less than subtle attempt
 to cement bilateral relations at a time when Mos-
 cow is having trouble elsewhere in the Arab
 world.]
 jAsad's five-day stay in the USSR coincided
 With the arrival in Washington of the Syrian del-
 egation to discuss disengagement and with strong
 anti-Soviet remarks by Egyptian President Sadat.
 With this backdrop, the Soviets had more reason
 than ever to use the visit to reiterate that Moscow
 must be a party to any negotiations leading to a
 viable Middle East settlement
 r  rMoscow also went out of its way, apparently
 some success, to keep Asad from following
 Sad is path away from the USSR and toward the
 US1The final communique expressed the resolve
 of both sides to "rebuff" any attempts to damage
 Soviet-Syrian  friendship] /This was probably a
 muted warning to the US, but more importantly
 it implied that Syria will not follow Egypt's ex-
 ample of improving relations with the US at the
 USSR's expense]
 he Soviets were somewhat less reticent
 than before in publicly criticizing US-Egyptian
 bilateral  negotiations.~jBrezhnev  referred  to
 President Asad and Soviet leaders at airport
 "ersatz-plans," concocted by "the aggressor and
 itsanov patrons," to substitute partial agreements for
 er-all settlement. He again stressed that the
 Geneva conference, where Moscow has a voice, is
 the authoritative international forum where a
 settlement must be worked out'!
 -2.   ;t he USSR has repeatedly failed to persuade
 'Asad to by-pass or at least de-emphasize the
 Washington  bilateral  negotiations  in  favor of
 Geneva, and it seems to have had no better luck
 this time] Asad's comment that "our points of
 view on t e main questions coincide" suggests]
 \that there were areas of disagreement, probably
 including the disengagement talksThe final com-
 munique fails to mention Geneva and merely
 repeats the language used in the one issued fol-
 lowing Gromyko's trip to Damascus last month-
 that disengagement is a partial step that must be
 tied to an over-all settlement, and that Moscow's
 participation in all the stages and spheres of a
 settlement is important.?
 [Asad,  who probably viewed the visit as
 necessary to assuage Soviet sensitivities over being
 excluded from the disengagement talks, was very
 generous throughout in his praise of Soviet sup-
 port for Syria. He characterized the Moscow talks
 in general as having consolidated ties of friendship
 and cooperation, but he was very bland and non-
 committal  concerning Soviet warnings against
 dealing with "imperialist and reactionary" forces.?

 lIn light of Moscow's recent set-back in its
 relations with Cairo, Asad may have sensed an
 opportunity to obtain generous aid commitments
 from the Soviets) Details are not yet available on
 the economic, scientific, and cultural agreements
 that Asad signed in Moscow, but it seems likely
 that they are indeed favorable to the Syrians.]
 I   he  communique  did  not  mention  any
 agreement on military aid, but did say that the
 two sides had "outlined steps" for the further
 strengthening of the Syrian armed forces. It seems
 likely that the Soviets will be generous in this area
 as well. The communique reiterated an earlier
 formula that Syria has the right to use all "effec-
 tive means" for the liberation of its occupied
 lands`abbut it did not use the Golan fighting as an
 occasion for sabre rattling.)
 25X1 /    Over the weekend of April 13-14, Israeli and
 Syrian forces fought their sharpest battles since
 ott the crest of Mount Hermon on April 13. By
 early the next morning, however, Israeli forces-
 using air strikes--had regained the summit. The
 level of fighting generally decreased early this
 week, but on April 17 and 18 Israeli aircraft again
 25X1 struck at Syrian ground targets in the Mount
 Hermon area.4
 Israeli aircraft flew a large number of sorties
 in the Golan Heights area over the weekend-
 particularly on April  14, the day the Israelis
 counterattacked on Mount Hermon. According to
 Tel Aviv, Syrian air defense units fired surface-to-
 SECRET
 air missiles of all types at the Israeli planes, but
 Israel reported no aircraft losses.
 An Israeli force also struck into Lebanon on
 Aril 12 in retaliation for the fedayeen attack on
 the Israeli village of Qiryat Shemona. This force
 withdrew after a few hours, but not before taking
 several  captives and destroying a number of
 houses reportedly belonging to fedayeen sympa-
 thizers. Despite the death of two Lebanese civil-
 ians, the attack was not as harsh as Beirut ex-
 pected. Tel Aviv presumably avoided larger scale
 retaliation because of its concern over the fate of
 two Israeli pilots held in Lebanon as well as the
 effect more serious attacks might have on peace
 negotiations.

 VAfter two days of heavy fighting in the   gon and the delta. Some senior government offi-

 the area and are maneuvering them into position has reinforced its units northwest of Saigon, and
 against the North Vietnamese forces.           the outlook is for more sharp fighting in this
 sector.
 11-1    In  Military  Region  3  the  government's
 Ran er base at Tonle Cham on the border of Tay
 Ninh and Binh Long provinces finally fell to the
 Communists late last week after being under siege
 for over a year. The base was the last government
 outpost within a major infiltration route north-
 west of Saigon, The impact of its loss has been
 primarily political, however, as the South Viet-
 namese announced on April 16 that they were
 indefinitely suspending the Paris talks with the
 Viet Cong. They cited the fall of Tonle Cham,
 continuing Communist pressure against other gov-
 ernment positions northwest of Saigon, and new
 attacks in the central highlands as reasons for the
 suspension
 14 As a military retaliation for the fall of Tonle
 Cham, the government directed air strikes against
 .the Communist administration center at Loc Ninh
 in southern South Vietnam and against other
 nearby targets. Meanwhile, almost all troops of
 the base's former garrison have managed to with-
 draw safely to An Loc. The ease with which the
 Rangers withdrew supports speculation that the
 base commander, in apparent violation of orders,
 abandoned the base in return for a Communist
 guarantee of safe passage?
 4 \Communist pressure in the area northwest of
 Saigon is aimed at strengthening their position in
 the border areas of Binh Duong, Hau Nghia, and
 Tay Ninh provinces. A recent shifting of North
 Vietnamese main force elements in Military Re-

 LAOS: THE PATHET LAO HOLD FORTH
 the Lao Communists, wasting little time in
 establishing their political and military priorities,
 have struck a note of reasonableness within the
 new coalition structure.)
 '   IPhoumi also dwelled on the Pathet Lao's
 interests in a frank and highly cordial meeting
 with the US ambassador, who assessed Phoumi as
 an individual willing to discuss serious matters in
 a non-polemical manner. Besides indicating that
 the Communists want to maintain good relations
 with the US, Phoumi tried to play down appre-
 hensions of a Pathet Lao take-over in Laos by
 stressing that the two sides should work calmly
 and amicably toward reconciling their opposing
 political viewpoints. Phoumi also stated again that
 it was essential for all foreign soldiers to leave
 Laos, and he hinted that the Pat et Lao may
 request aid for refugee resettlement
 IlOther Lao Communist members of the new
 coalition government have also been working hard
 to project an image of cooperation and cordiality.

 Some Unwelcome Fireworks
 The Khmer Communists dampened Buddhist
 New Year celebrations in Phnom Penh this week
 with their first sustained rocket attacks in over a
 month. Fifteen rockets fell on the capital be-
 tween April 13 and 15-most of them near the
 presidential residence-killing and wounding over
 30 civilians., At the same time, a flurry of Com-
 munist ground attacks forced government troops
 to abandon outposts along Route 5 some ten
 miles north of the city and along the Bassac River
 just below Phnom Penh. Skirmishing continued in.
 both areas late in the week as Cambodian Army
 units tried to retake the lost positions.
 In the countryside, the Communists are still
 blockading Kampot's outlet to the sea and are
 shelling the southwestern coastal city sporad-
 ically. Ground pressure has slackened, however,
 and government reinforcements are having little
 trouble working their way overland from the
 coast. The Communists have kept Kampot under
 siege for over a month, and they may soon begin
 to experience shortages of ammunition and other
 supplies. Moreover, many insurgent units pres-
 ently at Kampot saw action on other fronts ear-
 lier in the dry season and may be tiring/
 Some Welcome Attention
 Prince Sihanouk, who recently has been
 taking a back seat to his touring "defense minis-
 ter," Khieu Samphan, began his annual visit to
 Pyongyang late last week. In his major address in
 North Korea, Sihanouk acknowledged Samphan's
 growing political prominence by describing him as
 the  "authentic  representative of our people."
 Although Sihanouk was pessimistic about the
 prospects for a Khmer Communist military vic-
 tory this dry season, he again ruled out any nego-
 tiations with the Lon No[ government or with any
 third force. He did not mention the possibility of
 direct talks with Washington-a theme he revived
 last month during his visit to Laos.

 /The rehabilitation of veteran civilians who
 were ousted during the Cultural Revolution has
 long been a sensitive political issue in China. The
 struggle between those who favor bringing back
 former leaders and those who oppose the idea has
 been complicated by the related question of re-
 placing military men in top party and government
 posts with civilians. It appears to be easier for
 feuding central leaders to agree on removing sol-
 diers than on who should replace them, but the
 recent appointment of a new provincial leader
 demonstrates that progress is being made]
 \On April 15, a Peking broadcast describing
 the opening of the Spring Canton Trade Fair
 identified Chao Tzu-yang as the new party and
 government leader in Kwangtung Province. Chao
 headed the Kwangtung party committee prior to
 the Cultural  Revolution, but was gusted after
 attacks by leftist Red Guards in 1967,
 !His tortuous return to power has been typi-
 cal of others who have been rehabilitated. Chao's
 initial post - Cultural Revolution provincial ap-
 pointment was in Inner Mongolia. He then reap-
 peared in Kwangtung in April 1972, but was not
 named a secretary until January 1973. When the
 late-December rotation of military region com-
 manders vacated the top Kwangtung party and
 government posts, there were several candidates
 for the positions, including politburo member
 Hsu Shih-yu, the new Canton Military Region
 commander. Chao was elevated over two other
 Kwangtung secretaries who outranked himi
 hao is the first appointee to a top provin-
 cial             arty post previously held by one of the
 rotated regional commanders. The displacement
 of provincial military men has increased markedly
 in the last few months, and many soldiers are now
 targets of critical wall posters. It seems clear that
 civilians will fill most of the slots vacated by
 military men.
 The rehabilitation controversy continues to
 be hird-fought at both the central and provincial
 levels. Last December, Teng Hsiao-ping, the sec-
 ond highest ranking victim of the Cultural Revo-
 lution, was restored to the Politburo. Teng's ele-
 vation apparently took place in the face of strong
 opposition, as did his return to public view in
 April 1973. Several other high-ranking cadres who
 were purged or demoted during the Cultural Rev-
 olution have also returned to official favor, but
 reports suggest that others who were candidates
 for rehabilitation, such as former Central South
 Bureau leader Tao Chu, have been successfully
 blocked.)
 The rehabilitation question is clearly part of
 the anti-Lin, anti-Confucius campaign, and the
 issue appears to have been addressed by both
 sides. Depending on the context in which they are
 presented, media articles criticizing Confucius for
 wishing to "restore the old" can be read as thinly
 veiled attacks on either: pre - Cultural Revolution
 civilian officials, such as Teng or Chao, and those
 who wish to rehabilitate them; or those who wish
 to bring back people brought down in the later
 stages of the Cultural Revolution, most of whom
 were leftists. The trend in favor of the rehabili-
 tated veterans is a favorable sign for Premier
 Chou, who has led the effort to bring them back.

 TAIWAN STANDS FIRM ON AIR PACT
 ' !'. ITaipei last week underscored its tough stand
 on the impending China-Japan civil air agreement
 and put muscle into its threat to close Taiwan's
 airspace to Japanese planes by putting the Na-
 tionalist Air Force on alert.
 [A few days before the alert, Foreign Minister
 Shen publicly repeated Taiwan's demand that the
 present civil air agreement between Taipei and
 Tokyo be maintained. He warned that Taiwan
 would give up air links to Japan and refuse per-
 mission for Japanese aircraft to enter the Taipei
 Flight Information Region and Air Defense Zone
 if the Japanese unilaterally altered the existing
 agreement in order to secure a civil air pact with
 Peking
 jPremier Chiang Ching kuo is hoping that by
 Cooperating on the air issue with the right-wing
 Seirankai group of Japan's ruling Liberal Demo-
 cratic Party, he can help damage politically Prime
 Minister  Tanaka  and  Foreign  Minister Ohiral
 Chiang long ago wrote off both men as too pro-
 Peking and would prefer a more conservative cabi-
 net in Tokyol[Chiang's estimate of the situation
 ~,-within the party clearly overstates the strength of
 Seirank i as well as his own influence on events in
 Tokyo.
 25X1
 rA by-product of Chiang's course of action
 has been an increase in anti-Japanese feeling on
 Taiwan. This atmosphere, which stems from the
 Nationalists' sense of grievance against Japanese
 "perfidy,"  makes eventual  compromise more
 difficult.
 ?   IDespite his adamant public stand, which has
 aroused misgivings among his advisers, Chiang has
 not completely closed the door to negotiation,
 nor has he specified the exact conditions that
 would trigger a rupture in air service. The points
 at issue in retaining air links with Japan have been
 reduced to two: the presence of Nationalist air-

 handling of the name of Taiwan's airline. On the

 ever, Taipei may lose sight of the long-run neces-

 relations with Japan. It might precipitate a rup-

 UK-FRANCE: CONCORDE TROUBLES
 / The British Government is seriously consid-
 ering canceling its participation in the Concorde
 supersonic airliner. Britain's secretary of state for
 industry, Anthony Benn, presented a strong eco-
 nomic case to Parliament last month for ending
 the program, despite the fact he personally favors
 continuing development of the aircraft. Recent
 press  reports indicate that several government
 officials have made private comments suggesting
 that the new Labor government has embarked on
 a course that could bring the project to an end.]
 final decision, however, may not be made
 for several months. Cancellation of the project
 will be difficult because the Labor government is
 under great pressure from the British aerospace
 industry, trade unions, and civic groups to cony
 tinue development of the Concorde. London also
 faces the possibility of having to pay huge cancel-
 lation costs to its French partner should Paris
 decide to continue the project alone. The issue of
 cancellation costs could be the most influential
 factor in the UK's final decision.
 ' ~ccording to estimates by Benn, it would
 cost the UK an additional $944 million to finish
 and put into service its share-eight aircraft-of
 the 16 Concordes now under construction. This
 amount would be in addition to the $956 million
 that the British have already spent on develop-
 ment-money they acknowledge is beyond re-
 covery.1j
 ;Only a few Concordes are still under sales
 contracts. British Airways has ordered five and
 Air France has agreed to purchase four. When the
 Concorde was still in the early stages of develop-
 ment, major world airlines had options to buy 74
 of the planes. China and Iran also signed letters of
 intent to purchase three and two Concordes, re-
 spectively, but there is no evidence that they
 intend to exercise these options.
 a` 41 In his calculations, Benn has argued that the
 British  and  French would  continue to suffer
 losses even if more Concordes are sold. This is
 because the aircraft would have to be sold at a
 competitive international price, which is well be-
 low its production cost. Benn estimates that this
 loss in revenue, plus the cost to manufacturers of
 maintaining the spares and support facilities that
 the airlines would demand, would result in a loss
 of about $33 million per aircraft.
 France has been pressing the British in re-
 cent months to agree to the addition of a fuel
 tank to the Concorde to increase its 3,500 -
 nautical mile range by 200-250 nautical miles.
 The French apparently believe this modest in-
 crease would make the aircraft more attractive to
 the airlines because it would give the Concorde
 the capability to carry about 100 passengers plus
 baggage  non-stop  from  many West  European
 cities to the eastern US. The Concorde currently
 has only a marginal capability to make this run.
 An earlier plan to increase the Concorde's range
 and payload, which would have required rede-
 signing the wings as well as major engine modi-
 fication, was dropped because of the high costs
 involved and the additional delay to a project that
 was already six years behind schedule.
 Some British experts believe that no amount
 of modification or extra refinement will ever turn
 the Concorde into a commercially acceptable air-
 craft. They are of the opinion that the plane's
 payload and range are too limited to be attractive
 to the world's airlines. The advantages of the
 Concorde have been almost offset by the wide-
 bodied jets, which carry up to five times as many
 passengers. Although the Concorde can fly twice
 as fast as any wide-bodied jet, its flight time is
 nowhere near twice as fast on routes where it is
 necessary to stop and refuel. Concorde flights on
 long routes could in fact be slower than those of
 the larger, long-range subsonic jets because the
 Concorde  would  require  two  refueling
 stops

 N 11 rPeking  may  bring  charges  of  espionage
 against the Soviet helicopter crew that was cap-
 tured                                                                       in northwestern China last month The
 Chinese ambassador in Moscow told his colleagues
 a trial was "possible," and Vice Foreign Minister
 Chiao Kuan-hua labeled the crew "spies." Such a
 trial would heat up the Sino-Soviet polemic. Chi-
 nese exploitation of the incident has thus far been
 measured, and Moscow's reaction has been mainly
 low key.7
 ! There  have  been hints that the Soviets
 pressed Peking to release the crew. Soviet heli-
 copters apparently  overflew Sinkiang in early
 April,  and some Soviet diplomats reportedly
 dropped hints of trouble along the frontier. A
 strong anti-Soviet stand is politically important in
 China at this juncture, however, and there is no
 sign the Chinese plan to give up the crew soon.
 Rallies in Sinkiang, where the helicopter lande-I
 have linked the incident with the anti-ConfuciL,
 anti-Lin campaign. Peking also has tied the heli-
 copter to an alleged Soviet espionage case last
 January, in order to develop a pattern of Soviet
 misbehavior regarding China
 hould a trial be held, it is likely that the
 Chin se will give heavy publicity to this addi-

 affairs. There were a number of indications that

 Peking  contemplated  linking  important  indi-
 viduals in China with Soviet espionage even be-
 fore the helicopter incident. It is uncertain, how-
 ever, whether Peking would jail or repatriate the
 crew following a trial.
 I-The Soviets are privately spreading the line
 that there will be a trial of the helicopter crew.
 They were the first to publicize the helicopter
 incident  in  an apparent effort to pre-empt a
 massive Chinese publicity campaign. Now they
 seem resigned to the prospect of a trial, but intent
 on limiting the damage such a trial might have on
 the Western-primarily US-appreciation of Sino-
 Soviet relations.
 .Moscow would probably be restrained in its
 25X1   treatment of any trial unless Peking forces its
 hand by staging massive public demonstrations.
 This would be in line with current efforts to
 Sino-Soviet  affairs  in  a  low  key.
 Tito's program to re-establish the Commu-
 nist Party as the country's most powerful unify-
 ing force will take a giant step toward completion
 at the tenth party congress next month. The
 party's authority to make national policy and to
 exercise closer institutional control over the rank-
 and-file will be sharply increased}
 The last touches are now being applied to
 the report that will guide party policy for the
 next four years, and proposed changes in the
 party statutes are also under final scrutiny. Much
 of this was probably accomplished last week
 when party secretary Stane Dolanc, who is chair-
 man of the congress' preparatory commission,
 and Edvard Kardelj, the country's top ideologist,
 held several days of discussions with Tito. Kardelj
 subsequently indicated that substantial thanes in
 the central party machinery are in the works
 One of the key changes would abolish the
 largely advisory Permanent Conference and re-
 establish a full-fledged central committee-which
 was dissolved in 1969-as the main repository of
 party authority between congresses. In the ab-
 sence of a central committee, Tito has sometimes
 found  the presidium,  the party's top policy-
 making body, to be insufficiently responsive to
 changing policy needs. Re-establishment of the
 central  committee, which will  probably have
 around   165  members  selected from  regional
 parties and the military, appears mainly intended
 to  bolster  the party's control, stability, and
 confidencej.
 ii There also is a proposal to enlarge the nine-
 man executive bureau, which has strongly sup-
 ported Tito's plans to recentralize the party. With
 increased staffing, the bureau will be in an even
 better position to oversee and direct the activities
 of the party rank-and-file. In addition, the new
 party statutes enhance prospects for increased
 party control by abandoning the efforts, initiated
 in 1969, to create autonomous parties in Yugo-
 slavia's  constituent  republics.  Regional  party
 congresses-now almost over-have already re-
 organized  local  party  units to dovetail     more
 closely with the functional subdivisions of the
 central party apparatus..
