 SCOPE NOTE
 Over the past several years, Chinese leaders have changed tack in
 dealing with the United States and the Soviet Union while proclaiming
 their adherence to an "independent foreign policy." Their perception
 of the Soviet Union as the main threat to their security and of the Unit-
 ed States as the only strategic counterweight to that threat has not
 changed. However, they now judge the Soviets to be more vulnerable at
 home and overextended abroad-as in Afghanistan. Moreover, their
 relations with the United States continue to be impaired by differences
 over Taiwan. Accordingly, the Chinese have made tactical adjustments
 in their policy. These adjustments have led them to probe Soviet
 willingness to reduce tensions and to distance themselves publicly from
 the United States.
 Meanwhile, the Chinese are pressing ahead with the gradual,
 steady development of their strategic nuclear force begun in the mid-
 1960s. For example, they now have two intercontinental ballistic
 missiles capable of reaching targets throughout the United States and
 the Soviet Union and a sizable number of intermediate- and medium-
 range ballistic missiles. By 1987 they will probably have one operational
 missile-firing nuclear submarine. By 1993 we estimate a Chinese
 nuclear force of 10 to 20 full-range deployed ICBMs.
 In the light of adjustments in Chinese foreign policy and taking
 account of the steady development of Chinese military forces, particu-
 larly strategic nuclear forces, this Special National Intelligence Estimate
 assesses China's long-run security policies and the political implications
 of these policies for the United States. Will future Chinese leaders
 change China's current security policies and orientation? What path
 will China's security policy follow over the next 10 years? And what
 role will strategic nuclear forces play in these policies?
 This Special National Intelligence Estimate is intended to comple-
 ment NIE 13-3/8-83, Chinese Capabilities for Nuclear Conflict. That
 NIE discusses China's nuclear capabilities and deployments; this SNIE
 on China's long-run security policy discusses political implications for
 the United States.

 KEY JUDGMENTS
 What Kind of Long-Run Security Policy Will China Pursue
 Over the Next 10 Years? China in the next 10 years will continue to
 pursue a foreign policy that enhances its ability to maneuver between
 the two superpowers. But it will remain inhibited in attaining a
 significant capability for maneuver by the patently greater threat posed
 to it by the Soviet Union than by the United States. The size and quality
 of Soviet forces opposite China have continued to grow steadily during
 the past decade, supporting a Soviet military strategy designed to carry
 any future conflict quickly into Chinese territory. Barring any dramatic
 changes in relations, Soviet military capabilities probably will improve
 gradually through 1990.
 Chinese leaders undoubtedly look forward to the time when
 China's modernization programs will permit it to deal as an equal with
 the superpowers. But they are realistic enough to recognize that, by the
 early 1990s, China will still be far behind in industrial production
 capability, advanced technology, and modern weapons:
 - In the interim, China's leaders will probably be satisfied to
 have their country occupy a role analogous to that of France,
 relying on strategic nuclear forces to serve deterrence purposes
 rather than to constitute a ticket to the superpower club.
 - In this situation, China will not in fact occupy a seat at the table
 with the superpowers, but China's voice will increasingly be a
 factor in international forums on some key issues such as arms
 control.
 How Does China's Long-Run Security Policy Affect the Unit-
 ed States? For a number of years, the Soviets have had to take account
 of China's nuclear retaliatory capability; since the deployment of
 China's CSS-4 intercontinental ballistic missile (1980-81), the United
 States has also had to take account of possible attacks on its own
 territory. Should the United States become engaged in combat with the
 Chinese (for example, in Korea or the Taiwan Strait), it could no longer
 threaten the use of nuclear weapons against China without taking into
 account the possibility of Chinese nuclear retaliation against targets in
 the United States.

 China's need for US trade, educational facilities, and technology,
 and its common interest with the United States in opposing Soviet
 expansionism, will continue to provide some basis for consultation on
 these and other matters of shared strategic concern. China will continue
 to take positions that diverge from the United States on a range of Third
 World issues, but may be more interested in coordination or collabora-
 tion on key regional problems where US and Chinese interests coincide:
 - The technological gap between the West and China is unlikely
 to narrow any time soon. Thus at the end of 10 years China will
 still depend heavily on overseas training of its scientific and
 technical personnel and on importing technology, particularly
 from the United States.
 Moreover, China's relationship with the United States will
 afford it a degree of leverage in its dealings with the Soviet
 Union.
 What Nuclear Forces Will China Deploy Over the Decade? I
 China has only one nuclear missile system capable of reaching the
 continental United States--the CSS-4. Two silos for this ICBM are
 operational and at least four additional silos are under construction, but
 they will not be operational before 1986. By 1993, however, China's
 nuclear forces will approximate the following:
 - Ten to 20 full-range CSS-4 ICBMs capable of reaching all of the
 USSR and the United States, some possibly equipped with
 multiple reentry vehicles (MRVs).
 Some 20 CSS-3 limited-range ICBMs capable of reaching
 Moscow but only Alaska and Hawaii in the United States.
 Fifty to 90 CSS-2 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs)
 capable of reaching the eastern USSR.
 - Up to 30 new-generation solid-propellant IRBMs in that sys-
 tem's initial deployment.
 - Three to five nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines
 (SSBNs), each carrying 12 thermonuclear ballistic missiles with
 a range of about 2,400 kilometers.
 - Some tactical nuclear weapons.
 This section draws on the conclusions of NIE, 13-3/8-83, Chinese Capabilities for Nuclear Conflict.

 SECRET            LDA I
 Since all of the CSS-2s are configured for mobile deployment,
 China will continue throughout the decade to rely on strategic warning
 to permit the dispersal of mobile missiles to survivable wartime launch
 positions.
 Most if not all of China's strategic missile force will continue to be
 allocated to targets in the Soviet Union-Moscow being the primary
 one. China cannot be certain that Moscow's defenses could be penetrat-
 ed. Nor could the Soviets ensure against penetration of Moscow's
 defenses by one or more of the Chinese missiles.
 How Much Will China's Nuclear Forces Threaten the United
 States? China's security strategies over the next 10 years are unlikely to
 pose an appreciably increased military threat to US interests, despite the
 probable improvements in China's strategic and conventional military
 capability over this period. A substantial liberalization of US export
 controls on dual-use technologies would allow the Chinese to accelerate
 qualitatively their strategic weapons program during the next 10 years,
 but this would not markedly increase China's ability to threaten the
 United States strategically. The foremost concern for the Chinese will
 continue to be the improvement of their capability to deter or defeat a
 Soviet attack.
 Although Chinese capability for nuclear retaliation will be greater
 in 10 years than it is today, and could wreak significant destruction, it
 will still be very modest relative to the nuclear capabilities of the
 superpowers.
 How Will Possession of a More Formidable Nuclear Force
 Affect China's Policies Toward the USSR? The Chinese will continue
 to see the Soviet Union as the principal threat to China's security and to
 regard a strengthened nuclear force as the cheapest, quickest, and most
 efficient way of deterring Soviet nuclear attack and, to some extent, of
 deterring a large-scale conventional attack as well:
 - The improvements in Chinese nuclear forces will not give
 China a credible offensive capability against the Soviet Union.
 China will continue to rely on a long-term war of attrition,
 counting on its nuclear capability to deter Soviet use of nuclear
 weapons.
 The Chinese will still be compelled to rely on a minimum
 retaliatory strategy against population centers, industrial tar-
 gets, logistic centers, and rail and sea terminals linking Siberia
 with the western USSR.

 - China probably will improve its capability for tactical nuclear
 operations, which would give its leaders some new limited
 options when countering a Soviet invasion of China involving
 Soviet use of tactical nuclear weapons.
 - China will continue to maintain sizable armed forces, capable
 of sustaining a long war of attrition, in order to deter Moscow
 from initiating a conflict.
 - China will at the same time expand trade and cultural relations
 with the USSR and will attempt to normalize political relations
 on the basis of Soviet concessions on key issues. It will not,
 however, give in to Soviet demands.
 Will Possession of a More Formidable Nuclear Force in Itself
 Cause Chinese Leaders To Pursue a More Reckless or Assertive
 Course in East Asia? The strengthening of China's nuclear capability
 will not in itself improve prospects of regaining sovereignty over
 Taiwan, and a conventional military attack on the island by Beijing's
 forces remains improbable. Beijing will, however, reserve the right to
 resort to conventional force and will maintain pressure on the United
 States to phase out weapons sales to Taiwan in the hope of convincing
 Taiwan leaders that they have no choice but to negotiate a settlement.
 Increases in China's nuclear forces will not affect its support for the
 US-Japanese security treaty or its interest in stability on the Korean
 Peninsula. Nor will expected improvements in China's nuclear forces
 significantly increase the direct susceptibility of nonnuclear states to
 China's pressures. Whatever additional leverage China may have
 gained on such states by becoming a nuclear power it gained long ago
 when its successful testing and possession of nuclear devices and missiles
 became widely known. However, China's ability to threaten nuclear
 retaliation against the superpowers will have some impact on the
 nonnuclear Asian states seeking military aid from the superpowers.
 What Arms Control Policies Will China Pursue? Given the
 great and continuing disparity between Chinese nuclear forces and
 those of the superpowers, the Chinese are unlikely to modify their
 position on force limitations and reductions. They will not agree to limit
 or reduce their own forces until the superpowers have agreed to
 reductions in their own:
 - On the other hand, the Chinese will pay closer attention to
 arms control negotiations between the United States and the
 Soviet Union than they have in the past, particularly when, as

 in the case of the current negotiations on intermediate-range
 nuclear forces (INF), they fear that a US-Soviet agreement
 could result in increasing the nuclear threat to China.
 - Accordingly, China-like Japan and South Korea-will 'feel
 increasingly threatened by Soviet INF deployments and will
 want the United States to persist in arms control proposals
 based on global limits.
 How Important Is It to the Chinese To Avoid Major Warfare
 Over the Next Decade? For the remainder of this century the central
 aim of China's leaders will be the development of China's economy,
 and in particular its industrial. base. Hence, these leaders recognize the
 need for a long period of freedom from external pressures and armed
 conflict. Thus they will rely heavily on diplomacy, foster their ties with
 Japan and Western Europe, cultivate relations with the Third World,
 and avoid high-risk strategies that would place them in sharp confronta-
 tion with a superpower.
 Defense Minister Zhang Aiping has put forward certain principles
 which for the next decade probably will govern China's efforts to
 develop a modern, self-reliant defense industry:
 - Base the strengthening of national defense on the vigorous
 development of the economy.
 - Do not rely on purchasing weapons from abroad.
 - Develop only the most important and urgently needed military
 equipment.
 - Expand existing plants rather than construct new ones.
 - Give high priority to the development of nuclear forces.
 Despite serious weaknesses that will slow progress, the implementa-
 tion of Zhang Aiping's proposals probably will significantly improve the
 industrial base for defense production by the early 1990s.
 Nonetheless, shortages of funds and the technological backward-
 ness of China's industrial plant and research and defense infrastructure
 will prevent across-the-board modernization of Chinese conventional
 forces within 10 years. Some of the most glaring deficiencies probably
 will be eased, however, notably in antitank and air defense, radar,
 mobility, and communications. Progress in improving air force capabili-
 ty will be slower than in that for the ground forces, because of the high-
 er technology required.

 This Estimate is based on the judgments of NIE 13-10-82, Political
 Succession in China, which concluded that, although stable political
 succession from Deng Xiaoping to party Chairman Hu Yaobang and
 Premier Zhao Ziyang remains a somewhat fragile proposition, the
 chances favor a manageable succession and a continuance of pragmatic
 policies, both at home and abroad. If, alternatively, the succession does
 not proceed as planned and China is engulfed by fairly extensive
 political instability, then China could adopt a security policy far more
 inimical to US interests.

 1. Chinese leaders for 100 years have aimed at
 strengthening their nation in order to end the humilia-
 tion inflicted by militarily stronger powers. Since
 coming to power the Communist leaders have sought
 to establish legitimacy by providing the Chinese peo-
 ple with security against foreign and domestic ene-
 mies. Their early concerns were directed mainly at the
 United States because of American rearming of forces
 on Taiwan pledged to recover the mainland, the
 advance of US forces to the Chinese border during the
 Korean War, and US threats to use nuclear weapons
 against China both during the Korean war and in the
 1958 offshore island crisis.
 2. During the 1950s and 1960s the Chinese saw
 their security further threatened by Soviet meddling
 in their domestic politics and by the large Soviet
 buildup in Siberia and along the common border. Next
 came clashes with the Soviets on the border, culminat-
 ing in the 1969 Zhenbaodao (Ussuri River) conflict, in
 which the Soviets threatened to use nuclear weapons
 against China.
 3. Since 1949 other Chinese goals have been to
 reestablish Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan, Hong
 Kong, and Macau; to win acceptance of Chinese
 boundary claims along the Soviet and Indian borders;
 and to gain control over the Diaoyutai Islands (also
 claimed by Japan) and the Spratly Islands (also
 claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and
 Taiwan). Other long-term goals have been to increase
 China's influence in Asia and the world to a level more
 reflective of Chinese perceptions of China's size and
 historical importance.
 Past Policies and Strategies To Achieve Security
 Objectives
 4. Develop China Industrially and Militarily,
 Strengthen Self-Reliance. This has been China's
 fundamental security strategy. Although the Chinese
 economy faltered badly during the Great Leap For-
 ward and the Cultural Revolution, over the entire
 period 1953-83 it achieved an annual growth rate of 5
 to 6 percent, thus contributing to modestly building
 the industrial base needed for security policy.
 5. Promote Revolution. The promotion of Com-
 munist-led revolution in Asia was an important early
 element in China's strategy. Friendly neighbors were
 to be ensured through seizure of power by Communist
 parties throughout the region. But it soon became
 evident that these Communist revolutionaries would
 not succeed, and China gradually shifted to cultivating
 relations with governments in power. The Chinese
 have reduced but not cut their ties with other Asian
 Communist parties, thereby keeping a means of exert-
 ing pressure on those governments. But, this has
 impaired China's efforts to improve relations with
 other Asian governments.
 6. Exploit the Superpowers. In 1950, against a
 potential US-Japanese threat, Chinese leaders signed a
 defense treaty with the Soviet Union which brought
 China important benefits in weapons, industrial tech-
 nology, and training of scientists and technicians. This
 relationship with the Soviet Union ultimately became
 intolerable because the Soviets demanded special priv-
 ileges and interfered in domestic affairs. Also, the
 Chinese were disappointed with Soviet reluctance to
 back China's nuclear weapons program or to support
 China's confrontation with the United States over
 Taiwan. In 1960 the Chinese broke with the Soviets
 despite a continuing sense of threat from the United
 States.
 7. During the 1960s China pursued a policy of
 hostility to both superpowers, which attained its great-
 est intensity during the Cultural Revolution.
 8. During the 1970s, following the Soviet military
 buildup on the border and clashes with the Soviets on
 the border, China turned toward the United States,
 seeking diplomatic collaboration against Soviet expan-
 sionism, access to US technology, and training for
 Chinese scientists and engineers, as well as progress
 toward recovery of Taiwan. Because their experience
 with the Soviet Union had turned sour and they were

 uncertain of long-term US intentions concerning Tai-
 wan, the Chinese did not seek as close an embrace
 with Washington as they previously had with Moscow.
 They were determined to maintain a position that
 avoided close alignment with either superpower and
 showed confidence in being able to do so.
 9. Improve Defense Capability. Since its acquisi-
 tion of Soviet weapons in the 1950s, China has pro-
 gressed slowly in modernizing its military forces.
 Nevertheless, against UN forces in Korea, against India
 in 1962, against South Vietnam in capturing the
 Paracel Islands in 1974, and against Vietnam in 1979,
 China demonstrated its determination and willingness
 to use military force along its borders.
 10. Chinese Communist leaders decided in the first
 few years of their rule that China should have a
 nuclear capability and carried out their first nuclear
 test in 1964, less than five years after the Soviets
 withdrew their assistance. The small but growing
 Chinese strategic nuclear force presumably has had a
 significant deterrent effect on anyone considering a
 nuclear strike on China.
 11. Strengthen Ties With Neighboring States.
 China's relations with its neighbors have been mixed.
 China has been most successful in establishing friendly
 relations with Japan, Pakistan, and North Korea. It
 fought a costly war against UN forces in order to
 ensure a friendly North Korean neighbor. China and
 Thailand were at odds for years because of China's
 backing of the Thai Communist Party and Thailand's
 close association with the United States during the
 Vietnam war. Since Vietnam's occupation of Kampu-
 chea, however, the Chinese have ended active support
 for Thai insurgents. This has helped bring Bangkok
 and Beijing closer together. The other ASEAN govern-
 ments-those of Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines,
 and especially Indonesia-have maintained a cool
 attitude toward China, in part because of Chinese
 refusal to cut all ties with Communist insurgencies and
 movements in the area.
 12. China's biggest failure occurred in Vietnam.
 After years of receiving substantial Chinese aid in the
 war against the United States, Vietnamese leaders
 allied their country with the Soviet Union. The border
 dispute with India, India's close relations with the
 Soviet Union, and China's support for Pakistan have
 limited improvements in relations with New Delhi. In
 the Chinese view, the only serious neighboring mili-
 tary menace is the Soviet Union. India is perceived as
 unfriendly because of its ties with the USSR. Vietnam
 is viewed as unfriendly because, among other things, it
 represents a challenge for influence (dominance) in
 Southeast Asia.
 13. Mobilize International Political Opposition
 to China's Enemies. While the Chinese have regard-
 ed their own military strength as the primary guaran-
 tee of China's security, they have attached great
 importance to mobilizing international political and
 diplomatic support for China. China's entry into the
 United Nations as well as its growing influence in Asia
 and the world have improved its capability to mobilize
 such support.
 The Current Security Environment:
 Perceptions of External Threats
 Continuing Superpower Rivalry
 14. The Chinese see the world of the 1980s as
 dominated by superpower rivalry and an unchecked
 arms race. They anticipate a confused period, with
 gains and losses for each superpower, leading to a
 relative decline in the influence of both. Chinese
 rhetoric states that such circumstances favor the pur-
 suit of a less aligned foreign policy, enabling China to
 keep its distance from either superpower. In actuality,
 however, as evidenced by China's strategic and con-
 ventional force deployment, Chinese leaders recognize
 that the principal threat comes from the Soviet Union.
 Moreover, the lengths to which they have gone to
 preserve the substance of relations with the United
 States in trade, training, and technology transfer,
 despite serious strains over the Taiwan issue, indicate
 the importance they attach to those relations. Accord-
 ingly, because China has chosen to define its interests
 in these terms, its freedom of maneuver between the
 superpowers will remain subject to serious constraints.
 The United States: A Necessary Collaborator
 15. Chinese leaders value their country's relation-
 ship with the United States for the contribution it
 makes to China's development and the leverage it
 gives them against the Soviet Union. No other relation-
 ship currently can take its place in view of China's
 development goals. US educational facilities and the
 potential US contribution to offshore oil production

 and other major projects requiring advanced technol-
 ogy make the United States difficult to dispense with,
 despite Chinese frustration with bilateral irritants such
 as defections and limitations on technology transfer.
 16. The Taiwan issue remains a thorn in the US-
 Chinese relationship. Chinese leaders want to keep the
 pressure on in order to ensure that the United States
 carries out the agreement of August 1982 on arms sales
 reduction. To a considerable extent they can control
 the tension and avoid raising it to a level that would be
 too damaging to Chinese interests in relations with the
 United States. But domestic politics, nationalistic emo-
 tions, and the involvement of a leader's "face" some-
 times combine to create severe problems. Chinese
 leaders fear that the United States will be unable or
 unwilling to reduce or end its historical ties with
 Taiwan. This would either delay China's goal of
 reunification or foster a de facto "two Chinas" situa-
 tion. Either of these would be directly counter to the
 long-range Chinese goal of unification.
 The Continuing Soviet Threat
 17. The Chinese see the Soviet Union as the princi-
 pal threat to China's security because of the border
 disputes that have produced military clashes in the
 past and because of the strengthening of the already
 superior Soviet forces deployed in the vicinity of the
 border. (See charts.) Historical animosity also plays a
 significant role. (The Chinese, moreover, feel threat-
 ened by the continuing buildup of the Soviet Pacific
 Fleet.) Soviet domination of Afghanistan and close
 relations with India and Vietnam also add to the
 Chinese sense of being "encircled" and threatened.
 (See inset at top of next page.)
 18. Sino-Soviet talks, while unlikely to alter the
 conditions seen by the Chinese as threatening, may
 moderate the sense of being menaced by establishing a
 more normal relationship between Moscow and Bei-
 jing, emphasizing increased trade and exchanges.
 Agreement on minor border adjustments or on some
 reduction of forces close to the border would contrib-
 ute to a decline in tensions. It is unlikely that more
 substantial improvements in relations will occur dur-
 ing the period.
 19. The Soviet alignments that cause the Chinese to
 feel encircled are unlikely to change fundamentally.
 The Soviets will continue to pay the price to retain the

 The USSR began its recent round of political talks
 with China from a position of superior conventional
 and strategic military strength. The size and quality of
 Soviet forces opposite China have continued to grow
 steadily during the past decade, supporting a Soviet
 military strategy designed to carry any future conflict
 quickly into Chinese territory. Barring any dramatic
 change in relations, Soviet ground force manpower
 and equipment levels probably will grow gradually
 through 1990.
 Since the late 1970s, the Soviets have constructed at
 least 20 SS-20 IRBM bases-each with facilities for
 nine launchers-capable of striking China. The num-
 ber of launchers is greater than the earlier number of
 SS-4 MRBMs and SS-5 IRBMs deployed within range
 of China. The mobile SS-20, moreover, is highly
 survivable and has a MIRVed payload as well as
 greater accuracy, better reliability, and a shorter
 reaction time than did the older missiles.
 geopolitical and military advantages they bring. With
 strains between the partners in these relationships
 likely to increase, China will be quick to try to exploit
 any opportunities that arise and thereby erode Soviet
 positions in Vietnam, India, Afghanistan, and North
 Korea.
 Japan: The Chief Economic Partner
 20. The Chinese view ambivalently the strengthen-
 ing of Japan's armed forces. While they approve of a
 strong Japan to help check Soviet expansionism, their
 experience of Japanese invasion and their awareness of
 Japan's industrial power make them wary of a rapidly
 militarizing Japan. The small increase in Japan's mili-
 tary capability projected during the period of this
 Estimate, however, is unlikely to cause the Chinese
 serious concern that Japan might become a military
 threat.
 21. The Chinese regard Japan as their principal
 economic partner, although they will wish to avoid
 becoming overly dependent on Japan. They realistical-
 ly do not hope for formal military cooperation with
 Japan. Moreover, despite occasional criticism of Ja-
 pan's gradual defense buildup, they will continue to
 rely on strong US-Japanese bilateral ties as the best
 guarantee against remilitarization, and as a counter-
 weight to growing Soviet military power in Asia.
 Turbulence in South Asia?
 22. Even though China does not see India as a
 credible territorial threat, renewed armed conflict
 between India and Pakistan would nevertheless con-
 front China with a dilemma, in light of its longstand-
 ing security relationship with Pakistan. Soviet capabili-
 ty to punish China would serve as a deterrent to
 intervention, but failure to act in defense of Pakistan
 would damage Beijing's prestige and influence. China
 probably would not directly intervene militarily but
 would seek to halt the conflict while aiding Pakistan in
 other ways.
 The Chinese-Vietnamese Confrontation
 23. China views Vietnam as its most immediate
 potential enemy after the USSR and as the principal
 rival to its own goal as leader in the area. There are
 700,000 Vietnamese troops deployed near the Chinese
 border. These outnumber the Soviet ground forces
 deployed on China's northern border, but this Viet-
 namese threat remains a local one, not a strategic
 threat such as posed by the Soviet troops, aircraft, and
 nuclear missiles deployed against China. The Viet-
 namese forces, heavily reinforced after the 1979 Chi-
 nese incursion and equipped with $2 billion worth of
 high-quality Soviet weapons, are deployed in a defen-
 sive mode around Hanoi and between Hanoi and the
 Chinese border. The Soviet-Vietnamese alliance cre-
 ates the danger, however, that under some circum-
 stances China might have to fight a two-front war.
 24. The Chinese have kept pressure on Vietnam at
 a relatively low cost by supplying arms to the Kampu-
 chean insurgent forces. By resuming Sino-Soviet nego-
 tiations they have also fostered doubts in the minds of
 Vietnamese leaders concerning the reliability of the
 Soviet connection. They also hope that the extraordi-
 nary economic burden of the Vietnamese military
 effort will produce further strains with the Soviet
 Union, a change in policy toward Kampuchea, and an
 improvement in Beijing-Hanoi relations.

 The Military Establishment-Problems and
 Achievements
 - Give high priority to the development of nuclear
 weapons.
 Principles of Defense Modernization
 25. Defense Minister Zhang Aiping, in an important
 article in the party's theoretical journal on 1 March
 1983 (see inset), reaffirmed the basic principles cur-
 Excerpt From Zhang's Article
 Our country is a big country and it is not realistic or
 possible for us to buy national defense modernization
 from abroad.... At the outset it is necessary to obtain
 some technology that can be imported and model
 some weaponry on that of others.... Modeling one's
 weaponry on that of others is not a way of realizing
 defense modernization either . . . only by develop-
 ing-through self-reliance and in a realistic light-
 sophisticated military equipment that can be adapted
 to various conditions can we satisfy our Army's needs
 in its wars against aggression.
 Defense Minister Zhang Aiping
 1 March 1983
 rently governing China's defense modernization pro-
 gram. These principles, which are likely to continue to
 be followed through the period of this Estimate, are:
 - Base the strengthening of national defense on
 "the vigorous development of economic con-
 struction. "
 - Avoid excessive diversion of funds to military
 development, which would slow economic de-
 velopment.
 - Increase the interaction between military indus-
 try and civilian industry-make each serve the
 other.
 - Do not rely on the purchase of weapons from
 abroad.
 - Develop only "the most important and most
 urgently needed military equipment."
 - Emphasize the expansion of plants in the defense
 industry, rather than building new ones.
 - Give full play to the role of intellectuals.
 - Make good use of "the present relatively peace-
 ful international surroundings" to strengthen na-
 tional defense rapidly.
 26. Zhang's article indicates that China will contin-
 ue the policy followed since the break with the Soviet
 Union of slow modernization of its defense capability,
 emphasizing the development of a modern industrial
 base and the acquisition of selected foreign military
 technology in order eventually to acquire a self-reliant
 defense industry. The article also stresses the correct-
 ness of giving priority to the development of strategic
 nuclear forces, which give China "a relative advantage
 despite our country's weak economy and scientific and
 technological strength." (See inset.)
 China's Military Modernization Program
 - Professionalizing the People's Liberation Army:
 - Getting the military out of politics and internal
 security affairs.
 - Improved training:
 - Joint exercises.
 - Improved weapons, for example:
 - Type 69 tank, with improved capabilities (105-
 mm gun).
 - Antitank weapons, indigenously produced
 "Sagger."
 - Increased mechanization, self-propelled artillery,
 armored personnel carriers.
 - Air defense upgrade, indigenously produced SA-7
 and CSA-X-2 (mobile SAM similar to Crotale and
 SA-6).
 Impediments to Military Modernization
 27. Severe impediments will slow progress toward
 modernization. These include: industrial technology
 10 to 30 years behind the developed countries; short-
 ages of scientists, engineers, and technicians; shortfalls
 in energy and transportation; a sluggish bureaucracy;
 inefficient management; a weakly motivated labor
 force; an elderly leadership; and a 10-year gap in the

 ranks of well-educated young leaders, caused by the
 poor quality, or total lack, of higher education during
 the Cultural Revolution. Weaknesses are serious in
 areas important to the defense industry, such as
 metallurgy, electronics, machine tools, precision in-
 struments, and chemical production. Shortage of funds
 is an endemic problem which the government is
 attacking by reducing the size of the armed forces,
 sharply curtailing the production of obsolescent weap-
 on systems, and beginning an arms sales program that
 brought in $4 billion in contracts in 1981-82.
 Concentration on Priority Areas
 28. The Chinese demonstrated in the development
 of their strategic nuclear force that by concentrating
 scarce resources on a priority area they can make
 notable progress. The best scientists, engineers, and
 technicians and the most sophisticated equipment
 were assembled in this area. Priority funding, access to
 advanced foreign technology, strong political support,
 and insulation from the damaging effects of the
 Cultural Revolution have also contributed. This priori-
 ty treatment will continue and probably will enable
 the quantitative development of strategic nuclear
 weapons to proceed more rapidly than most other
 military areas.
 Need for Foreign Technology
 29. While they stress self-reliance, the Chinese rec-
 ognize the importance of "leading edge" foreign tech-
 nology to modernize their defense industries. They are
 meeting this need by signing major scientific and
 technology agreements with most of the developed
 nations, by making direct purchases of some military
 equipment and technology, and by sending abroad
 hundreds of technical delegations and thousands of
 students and visiting scholars. Of the more than 13,000
 students from China who are now abroad, some 11,000
 are studying in the United States. Almost half of these
 were sponsored by the Beijing government, primarily
 in the physical sciences-physics and chemistry-and
 in engineering; the remaining half are privately spon-
 sored by relatives, friends, and institutions outside
 China. Some 10 to 20 percent are estimated to have
 associations with military-related institutions in China.
 30. The Chinese are selectively purchasing dual-use
 technology, some of which is known to have been put
 to military use. Some dual-use technology fills key
 gaps in design and manufacturing processes; in other
 instances acquisition of technology is important for its
 symbolic value in demonstrating that China and its
 leaders are accepted on equal terms by the West and
 Japan. China also has a small but growing program to
 acquire advanced technology and technical data
 through covert means, particularly aimed at obtaining
 restricted US, West German, and Japanese technol-
 ogies having direct military application.
 31. The Chinese effort to acquire foreign technol-
 ogy holds a potential for sharply upgrading the domes-
 tic research and development effort. Nevertheless,
 inadequate R&D infrastructure, excessive compart-
 mentation of military-related industrial activity, and
 quality-control problems with replicating foreign mili-
 tary industrial equipment will continue to make Chi-
 nese absorption of foreign technology a slow and
 gradual process.
 China's Nuclear Force in 1993: A Growing
 Capability 2
 32. China has only one type of strategic missile
 system capable of reaching the continental United
 States, the CSS-4 intercontinental ballistic missile
 (ICBM). Two have been deployed and as many as four
 additional silos are under construction, which proba-
 bly will not be operational before 1986.
 the currently deployed CSS-4
 missiles are targeted on Moscow. Some 10 to 20 are
 likely to be deployed by 1993; some of these could
 carry MRVs.                                25X1
 33. The CSS-3, which can reach only Alaska and  _
 Hawaii in the United States, is deployed in two silos.
 Eleven roll-out sites under construction probably will
 be completed during the 1980s. Some 20 could be
 deployed by the late 1980s. Additional deployments
 are not expected.
 34. The bulk of the Chinese nuclear ballistic missile
 force consists of the medium-range CSS-1 (MRBM),
 with a 1,200-km range, first deployed in 1966, and the
 intermediate-range CSS-2 (IRBM), with a 2,800-km
 range, first deployed in 1971 and 1972. ]Both are
 mobile; neither is capable of targeting the western

 USSR. The CSS-1 force is being reduced in number
 and replaced by CSS-2s. CSS-1s probably will be
 :phased out by 1990. The CSS-2, with a design now 20
 years old, probably will not be upgraded and the
 :numbers deployed probably will level off by 1985.
 The Intelligence Community estimates that the num-
 ber of these two types of missiles currently deployed is
 60 to 115. The CSS-2 force probably will be supple-
 mented by solid-propellant missiles beginning in the
 late 1980s or early 1990s, based on the submarine-
 launched ballistic missile (CSS-NX-3) that was success-
 fully launched at sea in October 1982. By 1993 we
 expect China to have 120 to 220 nuclear ballistic
 missiles. Additionally, we estimate that China now has
 some 150 nuclear bombs and some 50 nuclear demoli-
 tion munitions.
 35. The 12-tube Xia-class nuclear-powered ballis-
 tic missile submarine (SSBN), designed to carry the
 CSS-NX-3 solid-fueled SLBM that was tested from a
 diesel-powered submarine in October 1982, began its
 sea tests early in 1983. It will probably become
 operational between 1984 and 1987. Its CSS-NX-3
 missiles are expected to have a range of 2,400 km, and
 initially will pose a threat to targets in the eastern
 of the Soviet Union.
 a total of four or five could be
 completed by 1993.
 36. China's nuclear strategy throughout the period
 will continue to rely on warning to permit the dispers-
 al of its mobile missiles to survivable wartime launch
 positions. Objectives and employment concepts will
 not fundamentally change; the characteristics of the
 delivery systems will force reliance on a minimum
 retaliatory strategy against population and industrial
 targets. Capability for tactical nuclear operations, al-
 though still extremely limited relative to those of the
 superpowers, will improve and provide Chinese lead-
 ers with some new options below the level of a
 strategic retaliatory attack.
 37. China's strategic nuclear missile force today is
 very small and backward in its technology in compari-
 son with those of the Soviet Union and the United
 States (see the table)
 SECRET                  25X1
 focus their nuclear weapons development efforts
 mainly on improving the CSS-4, increasing reliability
 and readiness of their mobile MR/IRBM force, devel-
 oping solid-propellant missiles, and developing tactical
 nuclear weapons.
 38. By the end of the period, the Chinese strategic
 nuclear force will still be very small relative to the
 Soviet and US forces, and its technology, will lag
 behind that of all four other nuclear missile powers.
 Nonetheless, US and Western export control policies
 will affect the pace of China's program. If the United
 States strictly limits the export of technologies related
 to nuclear weapons and their delivery systems, to
 electronic and antisubmarine warfare, and to intelli-
 gence gathering, the Chinese will make slower prog-
 ress toward upgrading their current strategic nuclear
 forces. On the other hand, scrapping most US controls
 over export of the technologies described above, giving
 the Chinese access to dual-use computer and electron-
 ic technology roughly equivalent to that available to
 most non-Communist developing countries, would al-
 low them to speed up somewhat the improvement of
 nuclear forces in this decade and to establish the
 industrial basis to introduce new generations of weap-
 ons in the late 1990s. China's capabilities would still
 not be in any sense comparable to those of other major
 missile powers because of limited ability to apply
 advanced technology to mass production of sophisti-
 cated military weapons.
 39. Despite these limitations, however, the addi-
 tions and improvements in the Chinese strategic mis-
 sile force during this period, together with effective
 use by the Chinese of mobility, camouflage, and
 deception and the addition of some tactical nuclear
 weapons, will increase China's capability to retaliate
 against a nuclear attack and thus add to the deterrent
 value of the force. The deterrent effect is also height-
 ened by the Soviet view of China as the most threaten-
 ing of the third-country nuclear powers and the
 assumption in Moscow that the Soviet capital remains
 the target of highest priority for Chinese missiles.
 China cannot be certain that Moscow's defenses could
 be penetrated. Nor could the USSR ensure against the
 penetration of Moscow's defenses by one or more of
 the Chinese missiles.

 Modernization of Conventional Forces

 Policies and Strategies for Exploiting Improved
 Nuclear Capabilities
 The Search for Major Power Status: A Seat at the
 Table?
 42. Chinese leaders, sensitive to not being taken
 seriously, look forward to the time when China will
 qualify for a seat at the table with the superpowers.
 But they are realistic enough to recognize that in the
 early 1990s China will still be far behind in industrial
 production capability, advanced technology, and mod-
 ern weapons. In the interim, China may seek to
 occupy a role analogous to that of France. In this
 situation China would not in fact formally occupy a
 seat at the table but its tacit consent will increasingly
 be needed by those at the table on some key issues
 such as arms control.
 43. The central theme of China's security strategy
 during the period of this Estimate will be one of a
 loose alignment with the United States that enhances
 its freedom of maneuver between the superpowers. In
 1979-80, Chinese concern over Soviet expansionism in
 Afghanistan and Vietnam and euphoria over the nor-
 malization of Beijing-Washington relations combined
 to produce fairly close political alignment with the
 United States. By 1981-82, however, China had
 changed tactics. It sought to enhance its leverage with
 the United States without appearing allied. Though
 still more disposed toward the United States than
 toward the Soviet Union., China became more
 independent in rhetoric while remaining close in
 substance. This is likely to prevail for the next 10
 'Years-barring a sudden, threatening advance of Sovi-
 et power, US moves perceived in Beijing as designed to
 make permanent the independence of Taiwan from
 China, or the onset of political instability in China.
 Advancing Toward Security Goals
 44. The achievement of China's security policy
 goals will depend heavily on internal stability during
 the leadership succession and the success of economic
 reforms in producing a respectable rate of economic
 growth-say, 5 to 6 percent during the period of this
 :Estimate. Prospects for political stability and modest
 economic growth are fairly good., Thus, by the early
 8 See NIE 13-10-82, Political Succession in China. The basic
 Ihrust of this Estimate is that, although the succession from Deng
 xiaoping to Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang remains a somewhat
 fragile proposition, the chances favor a manageable succession and a
 continuance of pragmatic policies, at home and abroad.
 1990s, China probably will have acquired a greater
 capability to deter attacks on Chinese territory and to
 accelerate the modernization of its armed forces dur-
 ing the 1990s. Success in these respects will also
 enhance China's influence in the region and the world
 and give it a more substantial claim to a seat at the
 table with the superpowers.
 Strengthening the Nuclear Deterrent
 45. The Chinese continue to view a strengthened
 strategic nuclear force as the most effective method of
 deterring nuclear attack and to some extent a large-
 scale conventional attack also. They believe that the
 combination of their existing strategic nuclear force,
 their large, although ill-equipped Army, and their
 concept of "people's war" provides reasonable assur-
 ance of a fairly long period of peace during which
 they can modernize their industrial and technological
 base and thereby modernize their conventional forces
 while continuing to improve their strategic. forces.
 They regard the "quick fix," such as Vietnam's acqui-
 sition of large amounts of advanced Soviet weapons, as
 an impracticable solution for a country the size of
 China. They see little choice but to follow the slower,
 and in the long run more dependable, course of
 building a self-reliant defense industry. If, however,
 China were suddenly to acquire sizable amounts of
 hard currency-unexpected oil reserves discovered
 and exploited-the purchase of some additional West-
 ern weaponry to offset Soviet numbers would become
 possible.
 Countering Soviet Encirclement
 46. The Soviet effort to encircle China, particularly
 through Soviet relations with India and Vietnam, is
 seen by Chinese leaders as increasing the risk of
 China's having to fight a two-front war. It is also
 viewed as impeding the achievement of China's secu-
 rity goals, which include surrounding itself with
 friendly neighbors, increasing China's regional and
 world influence, and recovering lost territories. Thus
 Beijing has resumed negotiations with the Soviets and
 the Indians, while maintaining firm ties with Pakistan
 and giving covert aid to the Afghan rebels. For the
 next 10 years, at least, diplomatic maneuver and
 cautious aid to certain opposition groups are likely to
 be important means of countering Soviet encircle-
 ment; maintaining extensive bilateral relations with
 the United States and Japan is another.

 Wrestling With the Vietnam Impasse
 47. The Chinese see Soviet ties with Vietnam as the
 most serious security threat next: to that posed by
 Soviet forces themselves. Vietnam's actions in Kampu-
 chea further exacerbate Sino-Vietnamese relations.
 China has attempted to counter Vietnamese and Sovi-
 et activities in the area by low-level aid to the
 Kampuchean rebels and by diplomatic efforts, partic-
 ularly in Southeast Asia. The Chinese will probably
 continue to avoid direct military action and rely on
 their aid and diplomacy to isolate Hanoi and Moscow
 internationally.
 Maneuvering Within the Strategic Triangle
 48. Assuming progress, even though slow and un-
 even, toward modernizing their industrial base and
 armed force, Chinese leaders will have increased
 confidence in their ability to conduct a more
 independent foreign policy. Ideally, they would like to
 maintain some degree of leverage over both Moscow
 and Washington. However, China's leaders view lever-
 age as more a tool to help achieve security than an end
 in itself. They will be constrained, therefore, in attain-
 ing this ideal posture by the hard facts that the Soviet
 Union will pose the more serious threat to China's
 interests and that the United States will have more to
 offer in needed technology, training, and trade.
 Fostering Ties With Japan and Western Europe
 49. The Chinese will seek to improve their freedom
 of maneuver relative to the superpowers by strength-
 ening links with Japan and Western Europe. Access to
 the technology, trade, and training available in these
 industrialized states will reduce, although by no means
 eliminate, China's dependence on the United States in
 these fields. That dependence could be totally elimi-
 nated in response to a sharpening confrontation over
 Taiwan, but only at the cost of significantly slowing
 China's development. Consequently, Chinese leaders
 will try hard to prevent damage to those parts of the
 bilateral  relationship most  important to China's
 development.
 Cultivating the Third World
 50. Emphasis on China's links with the Third
 World will continue to be more rhetorical than sub-
 stantive, except with those few Third World countries
 that can afford to buy substantial quantities of Chinese
 goods, especially Chinese weapons. Third World ties
 do not contribute directly to China's security, other
 than those with countries bordering on China, such as
 Pakistan, Burma, and North Korea, but are a potential
 source of support in international forums. China will
 continue to solicit Third World support in opposition
 to Soviet expansionism; in some situations Chinese
 policies will be parallel to those of the United States
 and in other places opposed. Chinese leaders will
 gauge gains and losses in China's weight in the world
 to some extent by their ability to mobilize Third
 World support for Chinese positions.
 Recovering Hong Kong and Macau
 51. The recovery of sovereignty over territories
 claimed by China but under control of others is
 unlikely to be accomplished during this period, except
 possibly for Hong Kong and Macau.
 Implications for the United States of China's
 Future Security Policies
 52. The security policies likely to be followed by
 China over the next 10 years do not pose an apprecia-
 bly increased military threat to US interests, despite
 the improvements in China's strategic nuclear and
 conventional military capability likely during this
 period. This judgment holds even if US export controls
 are substantially liberalized to provide dual-use tech-
 nology related to the strategic areas of nuclear weap-
 ons and their delivery systems, electronic and antisub-
 marine warfare, and intelligence gathering.  The
 Chinese will continue to be concerned primarily with
 improving their capability to deter or defeat a. Soviet
 attack and to resist further encirclement or consolida-
 tion of Moscow's position on China's borders. Many
 factors inhibit them from using military force outside
 China, even to recover territory claimed by them but
 controlled by others. However, if our assumption
 concerning leadership succession or internal stability
 were to change, we could not rule out a more aggres-
 sive Chinese foreign policy.
 Chinese Nuclear Force Improvements and the
 Superpowers
 53. For a number of years the Soviets have taken
 account of Chinese nuclear retaliatory capability

 against the USSR; since the deployment of the CSS-4,
 the United States has had to consider the Chinese
 threat to the continental United States as well as to US
 bases in Asia. Should the United States become en-
 gaged in combat with Chinese forces (for example, in
 Korea or the Taiwan Strait), it could no longer threat-
 en the use of nuclear weapons against China without
 taking into account the possibility of Chinese nuclear
 retaliation against targets in the United States. Within
 10 years, Chinese capability to retaliate will be some-
 what greater than it is today, although still small
 relative to the nuclear capabilities of the superpowers.
 54. Because of the great disparity between Chinese
 nuclear forces and those of the superpowers that will
 continue to exist for the next 10 years, the Chinese will
 not brandish their weapons against either of the
 superpowers. On the contrary, they will continue to
 declare that they will not be the first to use nuclear
 weapons and will continue to call for the abolition of
 those weapons (confident that the superpowers will not
 agree).
 Effect of China's Nuclear Forces on Nonnuclear
 States
 55. Improvements in China's strategic nuclear force
 will not significantly increase the susceptibility of
 nonnuclear states to Chinese pressures. Whatever ad-
 ditional leverage China may have gained on such
 states by becoming a nuclear power it gained long ago
 when successful testing and possession of nuclear
 devices and missiles became widely known. Soviets
 and Americans have discovered the difficulty of trans-
 lating nuclear weapons capability into political advan-
 tage, and the difficulty is even greater for a weak
 nuclear power like China. Increases in its strategic
 nuclear forces will, however, have other effects. States
 that fear China's military power (such as India or
 Vietnam) will continue to feel a compulsion to pay the
 price of protection by a superpower. Increases in
 China's nuclear retaliatory capability will also tend to
 weaken confidence in the willingness of a superpower
 to risk retaliation against its own territory in order to
 protect an ally.
 Maneuvering Between the Superpowers
 56. Even though the disparity between China and
 the superpowers will remain great in both strategic
 and conventional weapons, 10 years of political stabil-
 ity and economic progress would give the Chinese
 leaders greater confidence that their goal of a self-
 reliant defense production capability is attainable.
 Increased self-confidence, while not significantly in-
 creasing the leaders' propensity to risk large-scale
 military conflict, would encourage in them the deter-
 mination to try to maximize their freedom of maneu-
 ver in dealing with the two superpowers. Thus, China
 probably will continue to adopt foreign policy posi-
 tions that diverge from the United States on a range of
 Third World issues, while cooperating or consulting
 where US and Chinese interests coincide.
 57. For many reasons Chinese leaders will wish to
 avoid too close a strategic alignment with the United
 States. Chinese leaders have a growing confidence in
 their ability to deter armed conflict, a belief that
 Soviet internal problems and external entanglements
 reduce the threat to China, hopes for negotiating a
 lowering of tension with the Soviet Union, differences
 with the United States over several important issues
 (notably Taiwan), and a desire to burnish China's
 credentials with the Third World. Nevertheless, Chi-
 na's view of the Soviet Union as the chief threat, its
 need for US trade, technology, and training, and its
 interest in common with the United States in opposing
 Soviet expansionism, especially in Afghanistan and
 Vietnam, will provide a basis, albeit limited, for
 strategic collaboration with the United States in the
 form of consultation on strategic questions and parallel
 foreign policy actions. Some improvement in US-
 Soviet relations would give the Chinese greater incen-
 tive to seek strategic collaboration with the United
 States than exists today. The Chinese desire to avoid an
 overly close alignment with the United States is likely
 to persist throughout the period, in the absence of
 some new, threatening move by the Soviet Union.
 Persisting Need for Access to Western Technology
 58. Even if China remains politically stable and
 pursues a policy of seeking to expand its access to
 trade, training, and technology from the advanced
 industrialized countries, it is unlikely to narrow the
 technological gap, for technological change will con-
 tinue at a rapid pace in the West. China will continue
 to have difficulty absorbing new technology into the
 Chinese military-industrial system except in high-
 priority areas such as nuclear weapons. Ten years from

 minor adjustments in the Sino-Soviet border; their
 "recovery" will not require the threat or use of force.
 The manner of their "recovery" will be closely
 watched in Taiwan.
 61. The strengthening of China's strategic nuclear
 capability will not significantly improve prospects of
 recovering sovereignty over Taiwan, for nuclear weap-
 ons are not practicable instruments for Chinese leaders
 to use for that purpose. The strengthening of conven-
 tional forces over the next 10 years, however, probably
 will somewhat widen the edge that mainland forces
 have today over Taiwan forces. Beijing will reserve the
 option of using military force against Taiwan as a form
 of political pressure, but is most unlikely to resort to it.
 The military costs would be high, the physical damage
 to Taiwan's infrastructure and industry would be
 severe, and the political and resource burden of a
 subdued but recalcitrant population would be great. A
 military attack on Taiwan would also gravely damage
 Beijing's relations with Washington and Tokyo. Beijing
 can be expected to maintain pressure on the United
 States to reduce and eventually phase out weapons
 sales to Taiwan, in the hope of convincing Taiwan's
 leaders that they have no choice but to negotiate a
 settlement.
 62. Japan and Korea. The increase in China's
 military power will not significantly affect the Chinese
 position with respect to the US-Japanese security
 treaty or the Korean Peninsula. The Chinese will
 continue to regard the security arrangements between
 Japan and the United States as an important counter to
 the Soviet military buildup in East Asia and as a check
 on Japan going it alone. They will also prefer stability
 on the Korean Peninsula to renewed conflict there,
 which could pose excruciatingly difficult choices for
 them. Conflict in Korea would disrupt the peaceful
 environment so important to China's development and
 seriously damage its essential relations with Japan and
 the United States.

 now China's dependence on training personnel over-
 seas and importing technology from abroad will still be
 very great. Consequently, China will continue to be
 inhibited from taking foreign policy actions that
 would impair its access to foreign technology. These
 inhibitions will generally work in the US interest.
 China and Arms Control
 59. The disparity between China's small nuclear
 force and those of the superpowers offers little incen-
 tive to the Chinese to enter into arms control negotia-
 tions. China also lacks the technical capability to
 observe and closely monitor nuclear missile develop-
 ments in the United States and the Soviet Union.
 Nonetheless, the Chinese will pay closer attention to
 arms control negotiations between the United States
 and the Soviet Union than they have in the past. In the
 case of the current negotiations on intermediate-range
 nuclear forces (INF), they fear that a US-Soviet agree-
 ment could result in increasing the nuclear threat to
 China. Accordingly, over the next decade the Chinese
 may participate in arms control talks provided these
 talks are expanded beyond the confines of the super-
 power club. China-and Japan and Korea-will in-
 creasingly feel threatened by Soviet INF deployments
 and will want the United States to persist in arms
 control proposals based on global limits."
 Effects on Asian States Friendly to the
 United States
 60. Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Chinese proba-
 bly will reach agreement with the British during this
 period on the recovery of sovereignty over Hong
 Kong, although the actual exercise of their sovereignty
 probably will not occur until 1997 when the British
 lease on the New Territories expires. Hong Kong and
 Macau probably are the only "lost territories" that will
 be recovered during this period, except for possible
