 Another Death in the Part 's Family
 F          Y_
 The death of party vice-chairman Kang Sheng on
 December 16 should have little effect on Chinese
 policy-making.  Kang had 'peen inactive for several
 years, although he appeared at the party congress
 in 1973, at National Day ceremonies in 1974, and at
 the National People's Congress this year.  Kang was
 rumored to be ill at least since 1971, and he was
 in a wheelchair for the National Day celebrations
 in 1974.  He was aligned with the party's left wing
 and reputedly recruited Chiang Ching into the party
 in the 1930s.  Although his supposed illness may not
 have prevented him entirely from advocating leftist
 causes in higher party councils, the actual extent
 of his influence in recent years is impossible to
 determine.
 The memorial service held for Kang on December
 21 brought out all active Peking-based Politburo
 members.  The namelist, given in order of party
 rank, revealed no changes.  Chiang Ching, for
 example, despite the many setbacks she has suffered
 this year, remains the highest ranking member of
 the Politbrro, following the elite Standing Committee.
 Another highlight of the service was the reappearance
 of young party vice-chairman Wang Hung-wen, who pre-
 sided over the ceremony.  Wang's appearance was his
 first in Pekir.g since last May and was virtually
 mandatory under the circumstances.  He reputedly had
 returned to Shanghai earlier this year for further
 "seasoning" as a result of his less than glowing
 performance as a member of the hierarchy in Peking.
 Party vice---chairman Yeh Chien-ying, who himself
 has been ailing, delivered a rather warm eulogy,
 claiming that Kang was "beloved by the people of the
 whole country."  Kang, whose career was spent mainly
 in security.and internal intelligence work, was in

 Mao, the ailing Chou En-lai, and 90-year-old
 Chu Te, who has made several public appearances
 despite his age, did not attend the ceremony but
 did send wreaths.  The same was true of aging
 Politburo member Liu Po-cheng.
 There are signs that the party's most prominent
 intellectual, the octogenarian Kuo Mo-jo, is ill,.
 Kuo has not appeared publicly since October.  He
 sent a wreath to the Kang Sheng ceremony and has
 missed several events hosted by the Chinese Academy
 of Sciences, of which he is president.  On some
 occasions, these events have been held in Kuo's
 name, a formulation used fox. Premier Chou En-lai.
 Whether or not Kang's death means that the
 left has lost yet another voice, it ci;)es point up,

 both of whom are ailing to some degree, and was

 party Ting Pi-wu died at the age of 90.  Despite

 The persistent factionalism and worker unrest
 that has plagued China for more than a year seems
 to have abated somewhat as a result of a combina-
 tion of both harsh and conciliatory measures.  Al-
 though there are still signs of dissatisfaction
 among the populace, the worst seems to be over in
 terms of strikes and factional fighting.
 Workers,who have been striking for higher wages
 throughout the year have apparently won at least
 temporary relief as several provinces have adopted
 wage adjustment systems on a trial basis.  A final
 decision on wages may be included in the new five
 year economic plan, which begins in January, but no
 definitive word has yet come from Peking on the
 subject.  For now, the provinces are experimenting
 with a variety of wage schemes that benefit lower
 paid workers who have been in the same grade for many
 years.   In some areas, such as Y.wangtung, Kwangsi,
 and Heilungkiang, lower paid workers are getting a
 pay raise while apparently remaining in the same
 grade.   in Hupeh, however, lower paid workers will
 reportedly be promoted either one or two grades,
 depending on their length of service.
 Because they focus on the lower grades, these
 adjustments are not an excessive drain on the
 economy.  Thus, the provinces have found a relatively
 inexpensive way to appease the workers.   In Kwangsi,
 for example, strikes and slowdowns began to disappear
 after the implementation of a wage revision.
 Workers in Yunnan, by contrast, reportedly are
 still disgruntled because there has been no change
 in the wage system, but most of them are at least
 back on their jobs.  Yunnan and strife-torn Chekiang
 have been the most difficult areas to bring under
 control.

 The general unrest in Yunnan had apparently spread
 to the Hui minority group, which had raided PLA armor-
 ies, hijacked trains, and held mass rallies to pro-
 mote the notion of a separate Hui region.  Leaders
 of the so-called Hui rebellion were arrested and sent
 to Peking for political study sessions.  In addition,
 the Yunnan provincial leadership took steps to improve
 the living conditions of the Huis.  This carrot and
 stick approach has apparently been successful, and
 talk of an autonomous Hui state has died down.
 Leaders of other troubled provinces are appar-
 ently talking tougher and carrying through with their
 threats.   In Fukien, where factional problems still
 are affecting production, the provincial party boss
 reportedly has warned those engaged in factional fight-
 ing that they will be sentenced to labor reform.  Lower
 level officials--allegedly numbering in the hundreds
 --have reportedly been removed or reassigned.   A party
 leader in Tibet has publicly issued similar threats
 in regard to lower level officials responsible for
 agriculture who are following the wrong political
 line and fail to correct their errors.
 Although Peking has made some headway in
 stemming the worst of the disorders, the long-sought
 stability down to the grassroots is still somewhat
 elusive.   Factional rivalries, even when under con-
 trol, are virtually impossible to eliminate entirely
 and are likely to spring up again at the slightest
 sign of tension or political indecision in Peking.
 In this regard, the recent leftist assault on edu-
 cational policy--and especially any harsh moves
 against the perpetrators of this attack--could spark
 a resurgence of factional activity in the provinces.

 Peking has added 21 new routes and 58 new flights
 per week to domestic air operations since April, bring-
 ing total routes to 115 and total flight3 to 344.  Air-
 ports and aircraft inventories are also being expanded.
 International air operations are plagued by low
 traffic demand and continuing losses on existing routes,
 although China continues to seek new international air
 agreements.   China now offers flights to only 10 for-
 eign countries and is served by 10 foreign airlines.
 Peking has reciprocal air agreements with more than 30
 countries, however.   The most recent agreements were
 signed this fall with Finland and West Germany.  The
 surge of new foreign flights to China that occurred in
 the last few years has stopped, probably reflecting
 high fuel prices, Peking's stringent visa policy, and
 the general economic slump.
 Chinese aircraft inventories continue to grow
 despite serious under-utilization of the recently
 added 10 Boeing 707s and 8 British Tridents.   Origi-
 nally bought to augment the 5 Soviet IL-62s on inter
 national routes, several of these radium and long
 range aircraft are being flown on domestic flights
 alona w 'th 31 Soviet AN-24s and 45 IL-14s.

 value of China's foreign trade since 1959, for the
 past three years it has released fragmentary-sta-

 The Chinese have released a new figure for grain
 output in 1974 that is far larger than output claimed
 for any previous year--because soybean production
 has been included.
 25X1
 For each year from 1970 through 1973, the Chi-
 nese announced an absolute figure for the output of
 grain, which included rice, wheat, coarse grains,
 and potatoes.   In 1974 the Chinese reported only that
 output for that year was 2.4 times that of 1949.
 The derived output figure based on this increase would
 be 260 million tons.  CIA, however, believes that
 this total is a bit high.  Weather in 1974 was generally
 unfavorable, and output was probably closer to 255
 million tons.
 The new total for 1974 (announced at a UN FAO
 conference in Rome in mid-November by the vice-minister
 of agriculture and forestry, Yang Li--kung) is 274.9
 million tons.  Minister Yang also repeated the claim
 that 1974 output was 2.4 times that of 1949, and the
 coupling of this increase with an absolute figure
 makes it clear that the 1974 official output figure
 (2.428 times the 1949 grain and soybean output) in-
 cludes soybeans--and is consistent with our esti-
 mates.

 A major bridge across the Huang-pu River
 connecting Shanghai with a major petrochemical com-
 bine is nearly completed.  The rail section of the
 double-deck structure was completed in late August;
 the road will be done soon.
 This bridge and other transport developments
 continue to spur industrial growth in Shanghai,
 China's largest city.  Public transport has been one
 of the vital ingredients in Shanghai's industrial
 growth rate, which has averaged over 9 percent between
 1966 and 1974.  Nearly 6 million people--half the
 city's population--use Shanghai's public transport
 daily.

 ANNEX
 Education:  Back on the Front Burner
 The radical changes in education introduced five
 years ago as a result of the Cultural Revolution are
 again being defended, but chances are still good that
 they will undergo some, if not considerable, modifica-
 tion over the next year or so.   Since the first of the
 month, Red Flag, People's Daily and the provincial
 media have all carried adamant defenses of the Cul-
 tural Revolution reforms while attacking advocates of
 the more traditional approach to education.   Red Flag's
 verbal. assault on "bad elements in,education circles"
 The current' debate, which seems to have been
 going on below the surface for several months, may
 have been forced into the open by several speeches
 Chou made in September and October.   In his October
 speech, Chou criticized the reforms of the Cultural
 Revolution and claimed that there had been an over-
 emphasis on practical application at the expense of
 theoretical training.  He also deprecated a model cur-
 riculum that the radical faction.was then promoting.
 Chou's speech was circulated as .a centrally-originated
 document, indicating that his views commanded consid-
 erable support at the upper levels of the regime.I
 Mao's position-in the current infighting is crit-
 ical and, on most major points, his sympathies appear
 to.be with the moderates.   Chou Jung-hsin quoted him

 It is probable that Mao has not given wholesale
 endorsement to the moderate poeition however.  Having
 fathered many of the radical educational reforms him-
 self, he may well have a problem in backing away too
 fast and too unequivocally.   The leftists seem to be
 aware of the Chairman's vulnerability and"have made
 liberal use of his quotations from an earlier"period
 when he was more radical on this issue.
 disastrous educational stagnation--a statement that
 In any case, Mao's tilt toward the moderates has
 undoubtedly left the radical faction, led by Chiang
 Ch'ing,:. further isolated.  This latest blow comes on
 the heels of leftist setbacks in the cultural realm--
 also at'the hand of Mao--and a steady decline in re-
 cent months. of Chiang Ching's political stature.   In
 all probability, it was this erosion of radical clout
 that emboldened moderate elements to step up their
 criticism of the educational system, the last remain"
 ing edifice to the Cultural Revolution.  Likewise, the
 leftists probably realized that if their educational
 reforms were overturned, they would be left with little
 defense for the high cost of the Cultural Revolution.
 it may have been this sense of the high stakes that
 led the radicals to seek support in the public do-
 main.  Moreover, Chou Jung-hsin probably left himself
 vulnerable through his references to "10 years" of

 in effect questions the legitimacy of the Cultural
 Revolution itself.
 Even before the initial salvo was fired on De-
 cember 4 with the broadcast of the lead article in
 Red Flag, the leftists had apparently appealed to
 students at Tsinghua and Peking universities.  These
 two institutions have traditionally been centers of
 political. activism as well as models that other
 schools in the country watch closely for signs of
 new educational trends.   Peking University, moreover,
 was specifically criticized in the speeches of Chou
 Jung-hsin.  There are signs that since September
 there has been considerable activity--all of it
 peaceful--at these campuses on behalf of the Cultural
 Revolution reforms.   It is not surprising that the
 students, most of whom are from working class back-
 grounds and are the direct beneficiaries of the re-
 forms, would be quite sympathetic to the leftists,
 who undoubtedly were well aware of this reservoir
 of support.  It is no accident that the December 4
 Red Flag article was written by persons from Peking
 and Tsinghua universities.
 There are a number of other hints that the left-
 ists feel themselves on the defensive in this politi-
 cal contest.  The detailed, point-by-point refutation
 of the moderate position, characteristic of the De-
 cember 4 Red Flag article and much of the subsequent
 media play, reflects this defensiveness.   In particu-
 lar, the articles go to unusual lengths to refute the
 notion that the current educational system is turning
 out graduates who lack professionalism.  They cite
 numerous examples of student contributions to eco-
 nomic progress, emphasizing scientific achievements,
 A few articles plainly admit that there are "defects,"
 but hasten to add that any new system requires time
 to prove itself and that the educational reforms
 brought about by the Cultural Revolution are no
 exception.
 Finally, the leftists have displayed a certain
 amount of caution in trying to pin labels on their

 opposition.  Unlike numerous political battles in
 the past, the mudslinging seems muted.  The opposi-
 tion is portrayed as misguided, but the insinuation
 that it is in some way anti-socialist is for the
 most part avoided.
 At the same time,. in an attempt to sustain their
 reforms, the leftists have not hesitated to play on
 the insecurities of the large number of cadres in the
 universities who were purged during the Cultural Rev-
 olution and later returned to positions of influence.
 An important Red Flag article broadcast on December
 11 singles out these cadres and admonishes them to
 pay attention to seeing things from a proletarian
 outlook.
 The parameters of this educational debate are
 familiar, and the issues have been bandied about from
 time to time within the leadership during the past
 few years.  The last major outbreak of polemics on
 the education issue occurred in the spring of 1973,
 when university entrance examinations were briefly
 made a primary criterion for admission.  A counter-
 attack that summer forced the moderates to retreat
 on this issue.
 The outcome of the current round is likely to
 be quite different.  Unlike 1973, the moderates today
 are far stronger, while the political stock of the
 left has precipitously declined during the past year
 and a half.  There can he little doubt, judging from
 the ambitious economic goals set by the coalition of
 moderates around Vice-Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, that
 economic growth is their chief and overriding concern.
 An educational system that places a priority on
 quality and relies more heavily on proven methods
 probably has a great deal of appeal to these men--
 and provides the additional political dividend of
 further circumscribing the left.  Finally, and per-
 haps of decisive importance, unlike 1973 Chairman Mao
 has added his own political weight to the moderate
 side.  All of these factors suggest that the left is
 at best fighting a rear-guard action.
