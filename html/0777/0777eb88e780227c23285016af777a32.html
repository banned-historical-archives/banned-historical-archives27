 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUIIARY
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 KHRUSHCHEV'S FOREIGN POLICY PRONOUNCEMENTS
 Recent Soviet statements
 on summit talks are designed
 to convey the impression of an
 immediate readiness for such a
 meeting while implying that Mos-
 cow is adopting a conciliatory
 posture in accommodating differ-
 ent Western views on the timing
 of a summit meeting.   In his
 address to the Hungarian party
 congress on 1 December, Soviet
 Premier Khrushchev maintained
 the moderate and flexible line
 that has characterized his for-
 eign policy pronouncements since
 his visit to the United States.
 He took pains to deny "fabrica-
 tions" in the Western press that
 the USSR is no longer interested
 in an early summit meeting and
 said, "The Soviet Government is
 prepared to attend such a meet-
 ing at a time and place  that
 would be acceptable to all the
 participants."
 In another gesture toward
 De Gaulle, Khrushchev observed
 that the  French President's
 desire to have an exchange of
 views with him prior to a sum-
 mit meeting was "not-unreason-
 abl.e" and stated,          "Perhaps this
 will make for better understand-
 ing at the summit."  This treat-
 ment of De Gaulle, coupled with
 previous efforts to appear re-
 sponsive to French views on the
 summit, reflects Khrushchev's
 confidence  that De Gaulle's
 ambitions to enhance France's
 international prestige and in-
 fluence can be exploited to
 divide the Western allies and
 weaken their negotiating posi-
 tion at the summit.
 Khrushchev's relative re-
 straint in avoiding pressure on
 the West to agree to an earlier
 summit conference is another
 indication of Moscow's estimate
 that the passage of time will
 sharpen Western differences.
 Khrushchev  may feel that dur-
 ing his visit to Paris beginning
 on 15 March he will be able to
 prove De Gaulle's intentions
 more deeply and seek ways of
 manipulating Western differences
 to Soviet advantage.
 In dealing with the East-
 West issues, Khrushchev Again
 used recent statements by Chan-
 cellor Adenauer as a pretext
 for restating the Soviet posi-
 tion on Berlin and Germany.
 Throughout the speech Khrushchev
 stressed the warning contained
 in the TASS statement on 18 No-
 vember that if the West refused
 to conclude a treaty with both
 German states, the USSR would
 be "compelled" to sign a sepa-
 rate treaty with East Germany.
 Citing the Western peace treaty
 with Japan as a precedent, he
 claimed that the USSR had every
 moral and legal right to con-
 clude a separate treaty.  The
 premier avoided any suggestion
 that such unilateral Soviet ac-
 tion was imminent or related
 directly to the outcome of the
 summit meeting next spring.
 For the first time since
 his initial statement on return-
 ing from the United States, Khru-
 shchev repeated his commitment
 to President Eisenhower that the
 USSR would not impose a time
 limit or present an ultimatum
 on the Berlin negotiations. He
 declared, however, that a peace
 treaty must be signed which
 would include provisions for
 converting West Berlin into a
 free city.

 3 December 1959
 The threat of a separate
 peace treaty was also echoed
 in the 25 November communique
 following the talks between
 East German and Czech leaders
 in Berlin.   The Czech Govern-
 ment expressed its readiness
 to sign a peace treaty with
 both German states or the "one
 which is willing to do so."
 The possibility of East
 German participation in the
 summit discussions on a peace
 treaty was again raised by East
 German leaders.   Party leader
 Ulbricht declared that the Ger-
 mans would participate in such
 phases of summit talks.   Ear-
 lier, on 12 November, East Ger-
 man Foreign Minister Bolz made
 a similar claim.
 Although Moscow has failed
 to endorse the East German
 statements specifically, Gromyko
 said at the end of the Geneva
 foreign ministers' conference
 that "questions affecting the
 vital interests of the Germans
 cannot be settled without the
 Germans themselves, without
 the participation of both Ger-
 man states in the discussions."
 Moscow may be using the East
 German statements as a trial
 balloon to elicit Western reac-
 tion to the question of includ-
 ing German advisers at some
 phase of the summit negotiations.
 In its official statements
 and propaganda, Moscow has un-
 derlined its contention that a
 new phase of international re-
 lations based on peaceful co-
 existence is developing as a
 result of Khrushchev's initia-
 tive.   In his speech on 1 De-
 cember Khrushchev listed his
 visit to the United States, his
 talks with President Eisenhower,
 and the Soviet proposal for uni-
 versal disarmament as having
 produced a certain relaxation
 of tension, stressing, however,
 that this was only the begin-
 ning.   He expressed hope that
 a summit meeting would provide
 a "new step" forward in the
 struggle for peaceful coexist-
 ence.
 In assessing Western reac-
 tion to Moscow's peace offen-
 sive, Khrushchev claimed in
 Budapest that the West was di
 viding into two forces--"those
 statesmen and political lead-
 ers" who recognize the necessity
 of liquidating the cold war, and
 other Western circles bent on
 halting this trend. Khrushchev
 claimed that every "sober-
 minded" statesman has realized
 that the balance of forces "has
 tilted in favor of the social-
 ist nations," and he cited Ade-
 nauer as an example of those
 political leaders who refuse to
 recognize that the "past is
 disappearing, never to return."
 The recent publication in
 the Soviet press of statements
 by prominent Americans also
 is apparently designed to create
 the impression that the West is
 in the throes of a major re-ex-
 amination of its policies.
 The speech to the Hungarian
 party congress, like Khrushchev's
 two previous foreign policy
 addresses on 31 October and 14
 November, contains evidence
 that he is concerned over Pei-
 ping's challenge to Moscow's
 ideological primacy and hegemony
 in the Communist world and the
 Chinese Communists' apparent
 misgivings regarding his peace-
 ful coexistence strategy.   In
 a passage almost certainly ad-
 dressed to the Chinese Commu-
 nists, Khrushchev invoked the
 "principle of proletarian inter-
 nationalism" as the "supreme
 immutable law of the interna-
 tional Communist movement" and
 warned that "if the leadership
 of this or that country becomes
 conceited, this can only play
 into the hands of the enemy."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 3 December 1959
 The Soviet premier then
 returned to some of the main
 themes of his major address at
 the Soviet 21st party congress
 last February. At that time he
 took a line which contrasted
 sharply with Peiping's position
 up to late 1958, later partial-
 ly modified, on the rapidity of
 Chinese approach to a Communist
 society, the importance of "ma-
 terial incentives" in the econ-
 omy,  and the organization of
 agriculture.
 He warned that the "Lenin-
 ist principle of economic in-
 centives is of great importance
 for the advancement of a social-
 ist economy" and said, "We must
 not fall behind or go too far
 ahead.   We must, figuratively
 speaking, synchronize  our
 watches."  This is a reminder
 of his dictum at the 21st con-
 gress that all "socialist coun-
 tries ...will more or less si-
 multaneously reach the highest
 phase of Communist society."
 Khrushchev's statement that
 the Soviet Union has a stock-
 pile of rockets with nuclear
 warheads sufficient, if at-
 tacked, "to raze to the ground
 all our potential enemies" im-
 plies a greater Soviet capacity
 than is believed to exist, par-
 ticularly with respect to the
 ICBM.  The USSR may,,however,
 be able to launch a few opera-
 tional ICBMs against several
 key US urban areas.  On the
 other hand, the USSR probably
 already possesses sufficient
 numbers of 700- and 1,100-nau-
 tical-mile missiles to destroy
 most major European cities.
 Khrushchev recently re-
 ferred to his missiles in an-
 other way.   In a speech on 14
 November he stated, as an ex-
 ample of the mighty weapons at
 the USSR's disposal, that "in
 one year 250 missiles with
 hydrogen warheads came off the
 assembly line in the factory
 we visited."  The context im-
 plied he was referring to So-
 viet ICBM production, but avail-
 able evidence suggests that he
 probably was referring to the
 700-nautical-mile missile or to
 the combined output of 700-and
 1,100-nautical-mile missiles.
 West German Attitudes
 West German Chancellor
 Adenauer's recent statements
 suggest that he intends to take
 a hard line at the Western pre-
 paratory meetings.  He sought
 to secure solid French backing
 for his hard-line position dur-
 ing his-talks on 1 and 2 Decem-
 ber with De Gaulle in Paris.
 In an address to a Christian
 Democratic party meeting on 27
 November, Adeanuer called for
 patient, careful summit prepara-
 tions and warned that haste
 could mean disaster for Germany.
 There are indications that
 Adenauer will strongly oppose
 any proposals which he feels
 might undermine Western pres-
 ence in West Berlin or weaken
 the city's ties with the Fed-
 eral Republic.  On 30 November,
 West Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt
 warned against making changes
 in Berlin merely for the sake
 of change and termed hopes for
 a "perfect" solution of the
 Berlin question an "illusion."
 The chancellor demanded
 that the East Germans be given
 the same right of self-deter-
 mination now being granted to
 the peoples of Africa and Asia
 and urged Germans to stress "res-
 titution  of freedom" for the       25X1
 17,000,000 East Germans, rather
 than place all emphasis on re-
 unification.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUNNARY
 3 December 1959
 Throughout the border dis-
 pute between India and Commu-
 nist China, the USSR has at-
 tempted to maintain an appear-
 ance of impartiality in support
 of a peaceful settlement.  This
 stand, without precedent in the
 case of a dispute between a Com-
 munist and a nonbloc country,
 reflects the embarrassment the
 dispute has caused Khrushchev
 at a time when he is attempting
 to foster a detente with the
 West and encourage Nehru's
 "benevolent4' neutralism.
 The latest diplomatic move
 occurred on 22 November when
 Khrushchev sent word to Nehru
 that the USSR had given Commu-
 nist China "friendly advice"
 to negotiate a settlement of
 the border dispute with India.
 The Soviet leader stressed his
 desire to see negotiations be-
 gun as soon as possible.
 Khrushchev has sought by
 various other means to prevent
 any further deterioration of
 the situation which might harm
 the USSR's relations with India.
 He has consistently adhered to
 a neutral position in public
 pronouncements, expressing re-
 gret over the border incidents
 and hope that the dispute can
 be settled "by means of friendly
 negotiations to the mutual satis-
 faction of both sides."  He has
 characterized the dispute as a
 "little matter" that has been
 given too much importance, and
 he has publicly played down the
 strategic importance of the dis-
 puted areas.
 The Soviet press has also
 maintained this balance between
 the contesting parties.   On 10
 November Pravda led off with
 Peiping's position while discuss-
 ing                                                             an earlier exchange of notes

 whereas Izvestia led off with

 Moscow broadcast a paraphrase
 of those parts of Nehru's speech
 to Parliament opening the debate.
 over the border problem which
 stressed Nehru's desire to ne-
 gotiate the issue.
 While Moscow has probably
 been counseling moderation to
 the Chinese, it is doubtful that
 at this stage its advice is
 either a determining factor or
 at variance with Peiping's own
 views on how to deal with the
 issue.  The USSR is careful,
 however, to impress the Indian
 Government with its attempts to
 bring the dispute to a mutually
 satisfactory conclusion so as
 to gain as much credit as pos-
 sible for any moves which the
 Chinese Communists might make,
 even on their own initiative.
 Nehru apparently welcomes
 the continued Soviet attempts
 to ease Sino-Indian tension and

 probably regards them as evi-
 dence of Moscow's adherence to
 the "Camp David spirit."
 Nehru is unlikely to take
 any further step toward negotia-
 tions until he receives Pei-
 ping's reply to his proposal of
 16 November calling for Chinese
 evacuation of Longju outpost in
 Assam and withdrawal of both
 Chinese and Indian troops from
 border areas claimed by either
 side in the Ladakh region of
 Kashmir.
 The Chinese Communists also
 have indicated some concern that
 the border dispute might lead to
 a shift in New Delhi's foreign
 policy.   Peiping has repeatedly
 expressed its willingness to
 negotiate but has been unwilling
 to make prior concessions to
 India.   The Chinese would like
 to have strong Soviet support
 for their position although they
 realize Moscow has policy inter-
 ests which dictate a different
 approach to New Delhi.   If Mos-
 cow cannot give public support,
 however, the Chinese probably
 would prefer that it be less
 diligent in expressing its
 neutrality.
 Peiping, which has not yet
 replied to Nehru's letter of 16
 November, has sought to contrast
 Chinese "reasonableness" with
 Indian "intransigence" by highly
 slanted press reporting.   The
 Chinese, however, have avoided
 any comments which could be in-    25X1
 terpreted as official criticism
 of Nehru or New Delhi
 Iraq
 After two months in the
 hospital, Qasim returned on 3
 December to his office in the
 Defense Ministry where residen-
 tial quarters had been prepared
 for him.  A "great march" was
 scheduled for 4 December, and
 a special student holiday for
 the following day.
 Just prior to Qasim's de-
 parture,                  the American Embassy
 in Baghdad reported that an un-
 easy calm prevailed throughout

 parture from the hospital en-
 gendered a feeling that some-

 The first physical clash between
 Communists and nationalists in
 Baghdad in some weeks occurred
 on 28 November.
 The Communists have made
 two small but potentially im-

 Communist activity, and the
 Communists scored a substan-
 tial victory in the Iraqi Stu-
 dent Federation elections.   In
 addition, a new Communist daily
 began publishing in Baghdad on
 29 November.
 The Iraqi economy, mean-
 while, is stagnating, and the
 already high unemployment is
 rising.   Because of a restric-
 tive import policy and this
 year's poor crops, prices have
 risen considerably.   Peasants
 are reported eating next year's
 seed grain, which would mean
 poor crops again next year.
 The highly publicized agrarian
 reform program is lagging.
 The important development
 program  also  is  thoroughly
 bogged down because of the lack
 of adequate planning and an al-
 most total absence of compe-
 tent government technicians to
 carry it out.  Although capital
 funds, derived largely from oil
 revenues, are available, gov-
 ernmental mismanagement is
 widespread.   Soviet bloc eco-
 nomic assistance appears un-
 likely to bring about any early
 improvement in the country's
 economic situation.
 In a rambi.Lng speech on
 26 November celebrating the
 implementation of the Aswan
 High Dam project, UAR President
 Nasir made a direct attack on
 Qasim, the first in several
 months.   Spicing his comments
 with ridicule--particularly with
 regard to Qasim's messianic
 complex--Nasir charged the Iraqi
 leader with disrupting Arab
 unity and parroting 'Israel's
 Ben-Gurion and former Iraqi
 Premier Nuri Said.
 Nasir said Qasim's ego had
 become  so'  inflated  that  he
 might next be claiming credit
 for nationalizing the Suez Ca-
 nal.   Referring to a  recent
 press interview in which the
 Iraqi premier disclaimed any
 desire to speak of himself, Na-
 sir noted that Qasim had never-
 theless used the personal pro-
 noun more than 30 times.
 Nasir also attacked Qasim's
 recent statements about the Fer-
 tile Crescent scheme--a concept
 which would unite Syria with
 Iraq rather than with Egypt;
 he invited Qasim to "try" send-
 ing troops to Syria, claiming
 that Iraqi soldiers would re-
 fuse any such order.
 On 1 December, London and
 Cairo announced the resumption
 of diplomatic relations at the
 charge level.  Nasir's long
 hesitance to take this step--
 reflecting his distrust of Brit-
 ish activities in the Arab
 world--was probably overcome by
 his desire to improve his rela-
 tions with the West in general
 and, in particular, to ensure
 British acquiescence to a World
 Bank loan for his Suez Canal
 improvement program.
 UN military officers at-
 tached to the Israeli-Syrian
 Mixed Armistice Committee have
 expressed concern over the pos-
 sibility of renewed incidents
 along the Israeli-Syrian bor-
 der.                                                       They say Israeli officers
 have assumed a new "hard line"
 since the Israeli elections in
 early November.  According to
 the UN officials, these Israelis
 --apparently relatively junior
 officers--have said that the
 border has been quiet only be-
 cause Israel has taken no ac-
 tion, but that since this
 course has gained nothing,
 "other steps" to achieve Is-
 raeli aims were being considered.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 There is no other evidence of
 belligerent Israeli intentions,
 but  increased bellicosity  on
 the part of local Israeli com-
 manders--even if  unrelated to
 any higher policy--would  make
 clashes more likely.
 UN officers are particular-
 ly concerned about  the effect
 on the border situation of re-
 cent Israeli  irrigation                 work
 involving Jordan River waters
 and of recent   Israeli  over-
 flights of  Syrian territory.
 Since mid-November, four sepa-
 -rate overflights have been re-
 ported.   Some of them may have
 been intended to observe Syrian
 Army maneuvers which occurred
 between 18 and 22 November. The
 situation  along  the Israeli-
 Egyptian border is quiet,                                                               al-

 CUBAN GOVERNMENT CHANGES
 The shake-up in high Cuban
 Government posts on 26 November
 demonstrates Fidel -Castro's'-ap-
 parently complete commitment to
 extremism in his efforts to re-
 make Cuba.   He now has rejected
 practically all experienced and
 moderate  advisers.  He is re-
 sorting increasingly to charges
 of  persecution  of  the  Cuban
 revolution and is continuing
 his vicious attacks  against
 the United States. Ambassador
 Bonsai believes this trend is
 accompanied by a growing  re-
 ceptivity to guidance by Com-
 munist-oriented elements.
 The pro-Communist Ernesto
 "Che" Guevara, new head of the
 National Bank, now is in a po-
 sition to determine the allo-
 cation of the foreign exchange,
 on which  Cuba's economp    is
 based because of its large sug-
 ar sales.  He can thus  imple-
 ment his precept that to
 achieve true independence Cuba
 must shift the pattern of its
 trade away from dependence on
 the United States.
 Guevara  laid  the  basis
 for expanded trade   contacts
 during a three-month trip last
 summer to'nine Afro-Asian coun-
 tries and Yugoslavia.  Numerous
 trade missions he has sent  to
 Europe have found evident  in-
 terest in supplying Cuba--par-
 ticularly the  well-financed
 National Agrarian  Reform In-
 stitute (JNRA)--with                                                                credits,
 arms, agricultural equipment,
 industrial machinery, and tech-
 nical assistance.                                                              Guevara  is
 also likely to be instrumental
 in implementing Castro's  long-
 planned nationalization  of
 private banking in Cuba.
 The prime minister relies
 heavily for advice  on Guevara,
 whose economic knowledge  is
 basically weak and colored by
 his concept of the Cuban revo-
 lution as  a class struggle in
 which  the  government  must
 "change the economic panorama"
 of the country and its social
 system.
 The new minister of public
 works--also a powerful post--is
 Captain Osmani Cienfuegos,  who
 is  probably  a Communist.  He
 has served since last March as
 director of the Cuban Army's
 indoctrination program.   The

 NUCLEAR TEST CESSATION TALKS
 Soviet representatives at
 Geneva are seeking to create
 the impression of favoring an
 early settlement of all remain-
 ing issues in the political
 talks and are showing a rela-
 tively cooperative attitude in
 the technical talks on the de-
 tection of underground tests.
 American delegate Wadsworth
 believes that recent Soviet
 concessions in agreeing to
 American terms of reference and
 proposed agenda for the technical
 discussions show an  increasing
 Soviet interest in bringing the
 Geneva talks to an early and
 successful conclusion.   He be-
 lieves that in the political
 conference the Soviet delega-
 tion is seeking to expedite a
 settlement of outstanding is-
 sues, such as control commis-
 sion composition and voting
 procedures.
 Wadsworth reports that
 Soviet delegate Tsarapkin has
 told a United Nations official
 at Geneva that he would like,
 at the Christmas recess, to
 take back to the USSR various
 "new approaches" on the out-
 standing problems.
 The Soviet experts at the
 technical talks have sought,
 since the talks opened on 25
 November, to limit the mission
 of the experts to reaching con-
 clusions on the use of instru-
 ment readings at the control
 posts and the improvement of
 techniques and instrumentation
 of a nuclear test detection sys-
 tem.  They probably hope there-
 by to undercut Western insist-
 ence on the need to re-evaluate
 the effectiveness of the inspec-
 tion system as outlined in the
 1958 experts' report.
 The Soviet experts have,
 nevertheless, been willing to
 discuss and analyze new US data
 on underground test detection
 problems, apparently hoping they
 can reach early agreement in the
 technical talks  without alter-
 ing the basic conclusion in
 1958 that a control system under
 a treaty banning all tests is
 presently feasible.
 At the opening session the
 Soviet experts repeated the as-
 sertion that Moscow had agreed
 to the talks in order to re-
 move what
 it hoped was the "last
 obstacle"
 to agreement.
 They
 indicated
 willingness to
 study
 different
 "improvements"
 re-
 lated to the underground
 prob-
 lem and said Moscow had
 definite
 data leading them to believe
 that the talks would be success-
 ful.  They charged that, while
 Moscow could accept parts of the
 American report on detection and
 identification of underground
 explosions, it was "too specific."
 They expressed readiness to con-
 sider all proposals "of princi-
 ple" concerning the detection
 and identification of seismic
 events, and to recommend the
 "best of them" for adoption.
 On 27 November the Soviet
 experts belittled the quality
 and completeness of the data sub-
 mitted by the United States.
 They presented a report evalu-
 ating the new data in terms of
 both US records and data from
 Soviet stations, concluding with
 an even lower estimate than that
 in the 1958 experts' report of
 the number of earthquakes which
 could be confused with the kind
 of nuclear explosions on which
 the US information was based.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMARY
 3 December 1959
 Soviet tactics in both the
 political and technical talks
 suggest that Khrushchev has
 instructed his representatives
 in Geneva to make a concerted
 effort to press the negotiations
 to a decisive stage.   The USSR
 apparently hopes to focus the
 negotiations on obtaining
 United States agreement in
 principle to the concept of a
 predetermined number of on-site
 inspections of suspected nuclear
 explosions in any given year.
 SOVIET SECURITY CHIEF RESHUFFLES TOP STAFF
 The top central and re-
 gional command of the Soviet
 Committee of State Security
 (KGB) is undergoing a broad
 reorganization at the hands
 of Aleksandr Shelepin, who
 replaced Ivan Serov as
 security chief nearly a year
 ago.   The appointment of a
 new KGB head in the Lithuanian
 Republic on 23 November brings
 to six the number of regional
 changes effected since the
 first of"September.   In ad-
 dition to the regional reas-
 signments, two new deputy chair-
 men have recently been
 identified'in'the'central or-

 Shelepin is intent on a union-
 wide reshuffle of key posts in

 in place since the creation of
 the KGB in 1954.   In some in-
 stances their replacements are
 veteran, security officials who
 have been sent out from impor-
 tant posts in the KGB apparatus
 in Moscow.
 The new KGB chief in Ka-
 zakhstan is Konstantin Lunev,
 who had been first deputy
 chairman of the central organi-
 zation since at least January
 1955.   Since his transfer, two
 new deputy chairmen--Pavel
 Ivashutin and'.Vadim Tikhunov
 have been. identified in the
 Soviet press.  Tikhunov, long
 associated with Shelepin in
 Komsomol and party work, gives
 every sign of being the hand-
 picked appointee of the KGB
 chief.  Thus, while particular
 regional problems such as localism
 may have influenced the series of
 KGB changes, Shelepin;appears in-  25X1
 creasingly to have._.taken the? op-
 portunity to put his own candi-
 dates in key posts.
 Recent changes in assign-
 ments of top Soviet leaders
 are probably symptomatic of po-
 litical jockeying among Khru-
 shchev's lieutenants.  The po-
 litical maneuvering is not be-
 lieved directed in any way
 against Khrushchev, whose
 leadership remains firmly es-
 tablished; on the contrary, the
 Soviet premier could be playing
 Stalin's old game of encourag-
 ing rivalries and playing one
 lieutenant off against another.
 Further changes can be expected,
 possibly at the central com-
 mittee plenum scheduled for 22
 December.
 Yan Kalnberzin was suc-
 ceeded as Latvian first secre-
 tary on 24 November by Arvid
 Pelshe, who had been a close
 associate of the veteran party
 boss for the past 19 years as
 Latvian party secretary with
 responsibilities in the propa-
 ganda, education, and cultural
 fields.  The Latvian Supreme
 Soviet on 27 November "elected"
 Kalnberzin president of the re-
 public, a post devoid of po-
 litical significance.   At the
 same time, republic Premier
 Vilis Latsis was retired "be-
 cause of illness" and was suc-
 ceeded by Yan Peyve, president
 of the Latvian Academy of
 Sciences.
 These shifts, which amount
 to a complete shuffle of the
 KHRUSHCHEV'S AIDES
 Latvian Republic leadership, are
 similar to the shake-ups that
 have taken place in other repub-
 lics during the past year, and
 the underlying reason may there-
 fore be similar--failure to pro-
 vide vigorous leadership, par-
 ticularly in coping with na-
 tionalist sentiments and localist
 tendencies.   So far, however,
 neither Kalnberzin nor Latsis
 has been criticized, and the So-
 viet press reported that they
 were replaced at their own re-
 quest.
 The party faithful, however,
 will interpret Kalnberzin's trans-
 fer as a demotion, or at least
 semiretirement.  On the other
 hand, his reputation for faith-
 ful service has not been sullied,
 and he may be held in somewhat
 the same light as Voroshilov--a
 respected "old Bolshevik" who is
 largely without influence or
 power.   Whether or not Kalnberzin
 will remain a candidate member of
 the party presidium remains to be
 seen.  Nikolay was released on
 26 November from the job of presi-
 dent of the RSFSR, a post to which
 he had been assigned last April.
 Party Secretary Petr Pospelov
 told the RSFSR Supreme Soviet that
 the all-union central committee
 had found it necessary to recall
 Ignatov to "his main work" in the
 party secretariat.

 "proposed" Ignatov for the
 RSFSR post, Aristov stated that
 the party central committee,
 considering the great tasks
 which the RSFSR Supreme Soviet
 was called on to perform, had
 decided that it was "necessary
 for the RSFSR Supreme Soviet
 to be headed by a member of the
 party presidium."  Nothing hap-
 pened during Ignatov's tenure,
 however, to indicate any in-
 crease in importance of the
 RSFSR job, and now, seven months
 later, the "party presidium
 member" has been replaced with
 a lesser light--Nikolay Organov,
 who had been serving as deputy
 premier of the republic.
 Aristov's April statement
 was patently a bit of sugar-
 coating to make Ignatov's as-
 signment to such a politically
 insignificant post appear im-
 portant.   The real object could
 have been to weaken Ignatov's
 political position by transfer-
 ring him away from the party
 secretariat.   As it turned out,
 however,  the maneuver was only
 partially successful, for Igna':ov
 managed to stay on the secre-
 tariat and retain some of his
 former responsibilities in the
 field of supervision over agri-
 culture while performing the
 ceremonial functions of the new
 post.
 On the face of it, the ac-
 tion taken last April has now     25X1
 been reversed. Ignatov has made
 a comeback and may seek venge-
 ance.
 CZECH PARTY PREPARING TO SPEED "TRANSITION TO COMMUNISM"
 The USSR proclaimed At the
 21st party congress in January
 1959 that it had completed the
 "building of socialism" and had
 begun the "building of Commu-
 nism."  The Czech regime is
 hoping to claim this same stage
 of development by early 1961.
 Recent publication of a Septem-
 ber speech by party First Sec-
 retary Novotny to the central
 committee revealed that changes
 in the structure of the party
 and government will be necessary
 to accomplish the program of
 "completing socialism."  Novotny
 recommended that these changes
 be completed prior to the na-
 tional elections in late 1960.

 measure by "comrades' courts,"
 where regime-appointed "workers"
 will sit in judgment'over their
 colleagues at open trials in
 the factories and on the farms.
 This system is designed to in-
 still in the workers a fear of
 censure by their own associates
 for any deviation from the es-
 tablished regime discipline.
 It may also permit the Czech
 regime to reduce somewhat the
 constant secret police super-
 vision of the general popula-
 tion.   In this respect Czech-
 oslovakia is far behind other
 bloc countries  in making the
 secret police a less ostenta-
 tious feature of everyday life.
 Novotny proposed a reduc-
 tion in the number of internal
 political divisions.   The 19
 regions are to be cut down to
 8 or 10 territories, and the
 306 districts are to be cut to
 approximately half that number.
 As the party structure will
 continue to parallel that of
 the government, a reduction will
 take place in the number of
 party units, a process which will
 enable Novotny to weed out the
 overgrown party bureaucracy.
 The regime, which has already
 admitted some opposition to
 these moves, has warned that
 no localism or traditionalism
 will be tolerated.
 Novotny's innovations will
 not affect the economy drastical-
 ly.   The Soviet system of sov-
 narkhozes will not be copied
 because it is not adaptable to
 smaller nations.   However, col-
 lective farms, now averaging
 some 900 acres, will be merged
 to form 2,471-acre units.
 Novotny has taken a unique
 step in Eastern Europe by im-
 plying that his nation has ad-
 vanced to second place after
 the Soviet Union in the race
 toward Communism.   Although it
 previously had been accepted
 that the various people's democ-
 racies would "complete social-
 ism" simultaneously in 1965,
 a prominent worker in the Czech
 party Institute of History
 hinted on 25 October that this
 ,could occur at different times.
 Bulgaria, which has  rivaled
 Czechoslovakia over the past
 year in claims to advanced
 status in "building socialism,"
 has not been as explicit as
 Czechoslovakia as to when it
 hopes to begin the "transition
 to Communism," but has stated
 that the "prerequisites" for .
 this will be established by the
 end of 1961.
 Many Czech leaders have at-
 tributed their success to the
 highly developed industrial
 nature of the country at the

 and they offer Czechoslovakia

 and cultural relations  with
 the bloc.
 In his meetings with prom-
 inent Mexican officials, busi-
 nessmen, and industrialists,
 Mikoyan--the highest ranking
 Soviet official ever to visit
 Latin America--carried forward
 .the current Soviet campaign
 for "peaceful coexistence" and
 "peaceful competition."  When
 addressing industrial and farm
 workers, however, Mikoyan at-
 tacked colonialism and imperial-
 ism--at times referring specif-
 ically to US activities in
 Latin America.   He expressed
 Soviet support for the Cuban
 revolution and attempted  to
 identify the USSR with the
 struggle of peoples everywhere
 for independence.
 Mikoyan apparently was
 more bent on impressing  his
 Latin American audiences with
 the strength and achievements
 of the USSR, its peaceful aims,
 and the desirability of friend-
 ly relations than with                con-
 cluding any specific trade
 agreements. He is reliably re-
 ported, however, to have dis-
 cussed with Mexican officials
 a $100,000,000 credit for eco-
 nomic development as part of
 the Soviet plan to establish a
 successful economic program in
 at least one Latin American
 country as an example for
 others.
 Mexican officials considered
 the aid proposal merely a repe-
 tition in slightly more specif-
 ic terms of previously rejected
 Soviet offers and are unlikely
 to be more receptive now than
 in the past.   Although the pro-
 posal reportedly is "firm and
 official," no details have been
 revealed.
 During the first  week
 the visit received twice as much
 attention on Radio Moscow as did
 the first week of Mikoyan's trip
 to the United States last Janu-
 ary.   Reminiscent of the early
 Soviet propaganda treatment of
 Khrushchev's US trip, commen-
 tators told the Soviet people
 that Mikoyan's reception in
 Mexico was "warm" and "enthusi-
 astic" and made no mention  of
 Mexican press criticism or anti-
 Soviet demonstrations at the
 exhibition.
 Most Mexican Government
 officials exhibited a cool but
 correct attitude toward Mikoyan.
 Mexican press comment  on  the
 trip, however, has been  pre-
 dominantly critical, particular-
 ly of Mikoyan's attabks on the
 United States.   The government-
 oriented daily Excelsior                                                                 took
 the lead in criticizing-the
 propagandistic nature both of
 Mikoyan's public speeches and of
 the Soviet exhibition. On 19 No-
 vember, in line with its recent
 efforts to play a more important
 role on the international scene
 and probably to avoid the appear-
 ance of too close dependence on
 the US, the Mexican Government
 announced that President Adolfo
 Lopez Mateos has accepted "in
 principle" an invitation to visit
 the USSR extended by Mikoyan. No
 date for the visit has been set.

 Chou En-lai and other polit-
 buro members.
 A high-level party meet-
 ing at this time would probably
 be concerned with an evaluation
 of developments following Pei-
 ping's admission  of  serious
 economic  shortcomings  last
 summer.  Plans for a new "leap
 forward" in 1960 and the dis-
 position of "right opportunist"
 critics are likely agenda top-
 ics.   The absence of the for-
 eign minister from Peiping sug-
 gests that foreign policy mat-
 ters may also come up for con-
 sideration, including Peiping's
 deteriorating relations  with
 India and Indonesia, Sino-So-
 viet relations, and the Taiwan
 and Laotian situations.
 Mao Tse-tung's  last  ap-
 pearance in Peiping--where he
 had    spent the previous  six
 weeks--was on 22 October.    On
 23 and 24 October he reported-
 ly visited Tientsin, and on 25
 and 26 October he received, re-
 spectively, Brazilian and Aus-
 tralian Communist party leaders
 in Tsinan, capital of Shangtung
 Province.   Sometime late in Oc-
 tober he inspected two areas of
 Anhwei Province.  He may also
 have visited Shanghai then.
 Liu Shao-chi has also been
 away from Peiping since  late
 October and probably joined
 Mao in East China. A foreign
 visitor to Peiping was told by
 Chinese authorities that Mao
 and Liu were together on a gen-
 eral inspection tour to see
 that "directives were being
 carried out."  The foreigner
 was further told that they were
 both in Kunming  in southwest
 China, a location which does
 not fit in with other known
 points on their  junket but
 which may have been visited
 as a side trip.
 Mao's present  tour of
 East China is his fourth  in-
 spection trip this year.                                                                 His
 tours in the past often  for-
 shadowed conclaves of regional
 and national leaders. Last sum-
 mer, following a tour of the
 provinces, he  convened  the
 eighth central committee plenum
 at Lushan which revised economic
 targets sharply downward.
 Several other developments
 also suggest that a conference
 of party leaders in Hangchow or
 Shanghai has been or  still is
 in session.  Members of the par-
 ty politburo have been absent
 from Peiping for the past sev-
 eral weeks. Premier Chou En-lai
 may have joined the meeting after
 17 November, and Foreign Minister
 Chen Yi, who was last reported
 in Chengtu  on 7  November,
 probably also attended.  In ad-
 dition, American officials in
 Hong Kong have noted that pro-
 vincial party first secretaries,
 who generally were at their
 posts early in November, have
 made no, recent - appearances and may
 also have been present at the meeting.
 The pattern of Chinese Com-
 munist conferences in recent
 years suggests that a national
 party conclave can be expected
 before the end of the year. The
 meeting may take the form of a
 central committee plenum, although
 a session of the party congress--  25X1
 which last met in May 1958 and is
 supposed to hold annual sessions
 --is also a possibility.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 3 December 1959
 PEIPING'S TENTH ANNIVERSARY MILITARY REVIEW
 Unlike most recent Soviet
 and European satellite cele-
 brations, Communist China ex-
 hibited considerab&e military
 equipment in a review held dur-
 ing its tenth anniversary cele-
 bration on 1 October; the mili-
 tary part of the review equaled
 that of last year, and military
 formations led the parade. Re-
 cently received photographs
 show military equipment not
 previously identified in Com-
 munist China, including tanks,
 artillery pieces, and jet air-
 craft.
 The parade was led by ca-
 dets from military academies,
 followed by personnel from mili-
 tary training schools, the rail-
 way corps, the navy, and the
 infantry, motorized and para-
 troop units in trucks, 144
 pieces of artillery drawn by
 trucks and tractors, a mobile
 searchlight and antiaircraft
 unit, and a large number of
 tanks and assault guns.
 Two pieces of artillery
 were new to the annual parade--
 the 130-mm. field gun (M-46)
 and the 152-mm. howitzer (M-38).
 The 130-mm. gun had not hither-
 to been observed  outside the
 Soviet Union.   According to a
 Chinese account, some of the
 larger Artillery pieces were
 made in China.
 Ninety-nine Soviet T-54
 medium tanks, likewise said to
 have been of native manufacture,
 were seen for the first time
 in China.  These took the place
 of the T-34 medium tanks shown
 last year.   In the latter por-
 tion of the parade, 8,000 men
 of the Capital Militia Division
 marched by.  The militia were
 not in uniform but carried
 rifles, automatic rifles, ma-
 chine guns, and rocket launch-
 ers.  Observers noted that the
 militia appeared to be more im-
 pressive and businesslike than
 previously.
 Possibly the most signif-
 icant piece of equipment shown
 was the Farmer (MIG-19) super-
 sonic jet fighter, which par-
 ticipated in a 155-aircraft
 fly-by that coincided with the
 ground force parade.

 also have been of native manu-

 on 2 October  na t "hew, faster-

 BLOC ECONOMIC AID NEGOTIATIONS WITH ETHIOPIA
 Two bloc economic missions,
 one Soviet and the other Czech,
 arrived in Addis Ababa early
 last month to discuss the use
 of credits accepted by Emperor
 Haile Selassie during his vis-
 its to Moscow and Prague last
 summer.   While the bloc appar-
 ently is eager to set up an
 economic aid program in Ethi-
 opia, the primitive stage of
 the local economy presumably
 will make extensive surveys
 necessary before any signifi-
 cant projects can be under-
 taken.   It is more probable,
 therefore, that the bloc will
 tend to concentrate initially
 on projects which can be im-
 plemented easily and which have
 inherent propaganda potential,
 such as construction of medi-
 cal and educational facilities.
 In addition to agricul-
 tural aid and light industrial
 projects, including a pharma-
 ceutical plant, the Soviet eco-
 nomic delegation apparently is
 investigating possibilities
 for Soviet aid in mining and
 reportedly offered to con-
 struct an oil refinery at As-
 sab.   The delegation presum-
 ably will also draw up plans
 for constructing a secondary
 school and supplying medical
 equipment for a hospital--
 gifts which the USSR promised
 the Emperor last summer.
 The Soviet nine-man dele-
 gation now in Ethiopia is also
 exploring possibilities for
 assisting Ethiopia's agricul-
 tural development program.
 The Soviet Union, having offered
 to participate in the Emperor's
 new, ambitious "land reform"
 program, probably will provide
 both technical assistance and
 modern agricultural equipment.
 Haile Selassie, who has
 long sought to modernize agri-
 culture in Ethiopia and thereby
 increase the living standard of
 his 16,000,000 subjects, first
 announced the "land reform" pro-
 gram in late August following
 his return from the bloc.   The
 program, still in the formula-
 tion stage, would make available
 50,000,000 acres of government-
 owned land on both a cooperative
 and an individual settlement
 basis.   Four to six "coopera-
 tives" of 200 families each are
 to be established in the Awash
 Valley, and individual farmers
 are to settle on 40- to 50-acre
 tracts in the south.   The Emperor
 apparently believes that early
 implementation of a land reform
 program is necessary in order
 to expand agricultural exports
 sufficiently to reverse Ethio-
 pia's deteriorating financial
 situation.
 Judging from the make-up of
 the 21-man Czech economic mis-
 sion, Prague may offer a wider
 variety of projects, although
 they will probably be less ex-
 pensive than those of the Soviet
 Union.   In keeping with its past
 performances in the field of eco-
 nomic aid, Czechoslovakia pre-
 sumably will concentrate on light
 industrial projects for which
 Ethiopia has a great need.  After

 Nigeria's general parlia-

 regarded as crucial by Nigeria's
 tribally based three major par-

 Territory, will remain vacant
 until the future of that area
 is determined, probably in
 early 1961.
 The Northern Region--which
 encompasses about two thirds of
 Nigeria's total area and in-
 cludes slightly more than half
 the total population, estimated
 at 35,000,000--has been al-
 lotted 174 seats.  The Eastern
 and Western Regions received 73
 and 62 seats, respectively, and
 the federal district of Lagos
 three.
 American observers in Ni-
 geria expect that the ballot-
 ing will result in an almost
 even, three-way division of seats
 among the three major parties
 and their minor party allies.
 Forecasting is generally con-
 ceded to be more than normally
 hazardous in this instance,
 however, since it is Nigeria's
 first federal election in which
 the entire legislature will be
 directly elected on the basis
 of universal male--and in the
 two southern regions also female
 --suffrage.
 In any event, intense trib-
 al and regional loyalties and
 the personal popularity of major
 party leaders--especially the
 NCNC's flamboyant, US-educated
 Azikiwe and the AG's North-bait-
 ing Awolowo--and certain local
 candidates will be the most in-
 fluential factors in determining
 the outcome.   Intimidation and
 harassment of opposition ele-
 ments may also play a signifi-
 cant role, particularly in the
 north.   There the traditional
 rulers, pressed by parties al-
 lied with NCNC or AG, are not
 subject to the same legal re-
 straints with respect to con-
 trol over local police as are
 the southern governments.
 PRE-ELECTION TENSION IN BELGIAN CONGO
 Political tension is mount-
 ing in the Belgian Congo, with
 two major groups still planning
 to boycott local elections
 scheduled by Brussels for early
 and mid-December.  The ballot-
 ing for communal and territori-
 al councilors--the first colony-
 wide elections held in the Con-
 go--a    .visioned by Brussels
 as a first step toward increased
 Congolese autonomy leading to
 independence in about four
 years. Nationalist groups, how-
 ever, demand "immediate" inde-
 pendence and have threatened
 to boycott the elections unless
 they are preceded by round-table
 talks with Belgian authorities
 concerning the Congo's future.
 In a last-minute attempt
 to develop a formula for Congo-
 lese participation, leaders of
 the Abako and National Congo
 Movement (MNC) parties, which
 oppose the election, left for
 Brussels on 2 December for fur-
 ther talks with Belgian offi-
 cials.   At present only one of
 the three major Congolese group-
 ings--the Party of National
 Progress--has indicated that it
 will participate in the elec-
 tions.   Reports from Leopoldville
 indicate that the Abako is split
 on the issue, however, and the
 absence of united backing may
 make party leader Joseph Kasavubu
 receptive to a compromise pro-
 posal.

 Schrijver's attempts to restore

 The opposition Socialist party
 has withheld support of the gov-

 ing the door open for a future
 accommodation.   The Socialists
 have supported Congolese demands
 for a round-table conference
 but without specifying the tim-
 ing in relation to the December
 elections.   The American Embassy
 observes that the Socialists are
 themselves divided on Congo pol- 25X1
 icy, with an important element
 wanting the party to support the
 government position.
 No apparent progress has
 been made in breaking the im-
 passe within the Laotian Govern-
 ment over whether to extend the
 mandate of the present National
 Assembly, due to end on 25 De-
 cember, and when to hold elec-
 tions for a new assembly.   Pre-
 mier Phoui continues to press
 for a one-year extension of the
 assembly, with elections in De-
 cember 1960.   The King, the re-
 formist Committee for Defense of
 National Interests (CDNI), and
 influential elements in the ar--
 my, with varying degrees of
 firmness, favor letting the as-
 sembly expire and holding elec-
 tions shortly.
 At stake in this dispute is
 the balance of power within the
 government between conservative
 elements,  led by Phoui, and the
 CDNI, which has strong army sup-
 port and is viewed with great
 favor by King Savang.   Phoui's
 main base of power is the dom-
 inant conservative element in
 the assembly.   The premier prob-
 ably fears that if the assembly
 were allowed to lapse he would
 be reduced to the role of a fig-
 urehead even if retained as pre-
 mier in any reconstituted govern-
 ment.   The CDNI, on the other
 hand, probably calculates that
 with the assembly dissolved it
 could gain more posts in the
 cabinet and a greater voice in
 determining the complexion of
 a new assembly returned in pos-
 sibly army-controlled elections
 in the spring or summer of 1960.
 Phoui, possibly feeling
 that his implied threat to re-
 sign is sufficient to whip his
 opponents into line,  is proceed-
 ing with the preliminary steps
 necessary to extend the legis-
 lature's mandate.   The CDNI,       25X1
 however, gives no sign of aban-
 doning its opposition to his
 plans.
 Although there is a con-
 tinuing possibility that the
 CONI may be tempted to assume,
 with army help, full control
 of the government, a compromise
 is more likely to be reached.

 JAPANESE SOCIALISTS HURT BY VIOLENT TACTICS
 The violence which accom-
 panied leftist-led demonstra-
 tions opposing the US-Japan Se-
 curity Treaty near the Japanese
 Diet on 27 November has resilted
 in widespread public criticism
 and is having an adverse effect
 on the Japanese Socialist party.
 The party leadership has been
 put on the defensive because of
 its major role in the demonstra-
 tions and is reappraising its
 program for opposing the treaty,
 which is undergoing revision.
 Socialist efforts to pin
 the blame for the riot on the
 pro-Communist student organiza-
 tion, Zengakuren, and to claim
 that the police, on orders of
 the ruling Liberal-Democratic
 party, provoked the incident
 have been discounted by the
 press and public.   A top Social-
 ist official has indicated that
 the party might have to fall
 back on propaganda as its main
 weapon in its campaign against
 the security treaty.
 The Socialists probably
 will be less enthusiastic for
 the next demonstration, sched-
 uled for 10 December to coincide
 with the party's introduction
 into the Diet of a resolution
 against the treaty.   There have
 been no indications, however,
 that the demonstration will be
 abandoned.
 The government has acted
 quickly to utilize in its
 protracted effort to curb left-

 are expected to continue press-
 ing for additional canal bene-
 fits, especially the right to
 fly the Panamanian flag in the
 Canal Zone.
 A small number of Commu-
 nists, extreme nationalists,
 and several Cuban newsmen ap-
 pear to have been responsible
 for instigating several hundred
 Panamanians to stage a three-
 hour outburst of anti-American
 violence on 28 November follow-
 ing a large, relatively orderly
 "reaffirmation of sovereignty"
 rally.  The failure of the out-
 burst to achieve the serious
 proportions previously predicted
 can be attributed to an easing
 of tension following the recent
 mission of Under Secretary Mer-
 chant to Panama,  to strong pleas
 for peace and order by President
 de la Guardia and several civic
 organizations, and particularly
 to the determination of  the
 National Guard to back up the
 President's peace plea.
 In contrast to its inac-
 tivity on 3 and 4 November, the
 National Guard made every ef-
 fort to control the situation
 and proved to be  effective.
 The vigorous guard action on
 28 November may have been in-
 spired by reports that the anti-
 US demonstration would be turned.
 into a general revolt against
 the regime.
 Further anti-US agitation
 and disturbances may result from
 continued Panamanian demands
 for more economic and political
 concessions in the Canal Zone
 during the months preceding the
 May 1960 presidential election.
 PERU AND CHILE PROPOSE ARMS LIMITATION
 Official Peruvian and Chil-
 ean suggestions for a South
 American conference on  arms
 limitation to reduce defense
 spending in favor of increased
 economic development funds have
 interested the governments of
 Ecuador and Colombia. Political
 leaders of all four countries
 seem conscious that any large
 military purchases could wipe
 out the recent improvement in
 their foreign exchange balances.
 The scheduled area-wide discus-
 sion--in accordance with an
 Ecuadoran suggestion--at the
 Inter-American Conference in
 Quito next February is likely
 to be influenced by the pre-
 liminary negotiations initiated
 by Peru on 27 November.
 The disclosure--which seems
 imminent--of the Peruvian naval
 minister's purchase in late No-
 vember of a second British
 cruiser would probably disrupt
 the proposed cooperation, how-
 ever, unless the purchase is
 canceled by Peru's prime minis-
 ter, who is publicly committed
 to the disarmament move.
 Public opinion in both
 Chile and Peru strongly favors
 arms limitation..   The issue
 was raised by Peru's purchase
 last October of a British cruis-
 er, which greatly alarmed the
 Chileans and led President
 Ales~sandri to warn the American
 ambassador in Quito that the

 called his suggestion of a year
 ago that the United States
 should refuse to sell arms to
 Latin American nations and
 should withhold economic aid
 from those that bought else
 where.  His public statement
 in late November condemning
 arms purchases by underdeveloped
 countries probably made the best
 impression on Chilean public
 opinion of any of his official
 acts.
 This view also
 prevailed in Peru,
 where public opinion
 pressures enabled the
 Peruvian prime minis-

 armed forces minis-
 ters to agree to the
 move toward arms lim-
 itation.
 In addition to
 the Peruvian purchase,
 Argentina and Brazil

 nomic conditions in

 of the area's polit-

 to believe that the
 peace machinery of
 the Organization of
 American States is
 an effective protec-
 tionagainst aggres-
 sion.  Most civilian
 Latin American gov-
 ernments fear that
 consistent refusal
 of military requests
 for new arms would
 invite a military
 coup, particularly if armed
 forces in neighboring states
 were growing in relative
 strength.
 The four West Coast govern-
 ments are among the most conserv-
 ative in Latin America, and their
 interest in diverting defense
 expenditures to economic devel-
 opment projects no doubt arises
 in part from their reluctance
 to join the more leftist Latin
 American governments in looking
 to the Soviet bloc for economic
 aid.

 Several compromises af-
 fecting the future political
 and commercial orientation of
 the European Economic Commu
 pity (EEC) were reached by the
 EEC foreign ministers who met
 in Strasbourg in late November.
 The ministers agreed to
 proceed with the organization
 of periodic political consulta-
 tions, long advocated by the
 French and Italians.   Reflect-
 ing suspicions primarily on the
 part of the Benelux countries
 that the proposed talks might
 become a vehicle for a French-
 dominated Continental political
 bloc within NATO, it was de-
 cided that no permanent polit-
 ical secretariat would be set
 up and that the consultations
 would be rotated among the cap-
 itals of the six member coun-
 tries.   The first of the quarter-
 ly foreign ministers' meetings
 is scheduled for 25 January in
 ' Rome .
 A similar compromise of
 French and Benelux views was
 also reached on EEC tariff and
 quota changes scheduled for
 1960.   In effect, it was agreed
 that the intra-EEC commodity
 quota enlargements due in
 January would be extended to
 nonmember countries, that the
 internal tariff cuts due in
 July might be extended to other
 "most-favored" nations, and
 that contact would be estab-
 lished with other European
 countries--primarily the mem-
 bers of the Outer Seven--to
 discuss trade problems.
 This three-part policy,
 together with a renewed dec-
 laration of intent to negotiate
 in the GATT a reduction in the
 EEC's common external tariff,
 is substantially the program
 proposed by EEC President Hall-
 stein.   By leaving the July
 tariff generalization on a
 discretionary basis, however,
 the ministers in effect gave
 in to French complaints that
 across-the-board generaliza-
 tion would involve a "speed-
 up" of the Common Market for
 France, but not for the other
 members.
 Despite this concession
 to Paris, EEC sources believe
 the proposed acceleration of
 the development of the Common
 Market as a whole is by no
 means dead.   According to them,
 some compromise between the
 French and Benelux positions
 can perhaps be worked out--
 possibly Benelux agreement
 to earlier institution of the
 Common EEC tariff, provided
 the French agree to a 10-percent
 reduction in the target rates.
 Although generally liberal
 in nature, the ministerial de-
 cisions leave largely unresolved
 the difficult question of re-
 lations between the Common
 Market and the Outer Seven.
 On this issue, there is ap-
 parently increasing disposition
 to await some clarification of
 American views.   Indicative
 possibly of a desire to solve
 the problem in'an "Atlantic
 framework," President Hallstein
 declared at a press conference
 after the meetings that "prac-
 tical policy" would require
 that the United States be
 brought into any talks between
 the Six and the Seven.

 character of the 'recent Salz-

 of Austria" is a major Liberal
 objective.   He condemned as
 "nonsense" the concept of an
 Austrian nation in a country
 which "in spirit, mind, and soul
 has been German for a thousand
 years."
 Whether this still-limited
 revival of pan-Germanism will
 in the future become a menace
 to Austrian stability will de-
 pend as much on the outlook
 for government coalition of the
 People's and Socialist parties
 as it will on the Liberal or-

 the Liberals have tended to
 attract ultraconservatives from
 the People's party, anticleri-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 EGYPT'S ECONOMY UNDER NASIR
 President Nasir's regime
 has halted, at least temporari-
 ly, the steady deterioration in
 Egyptian living standards
 which characterized the quar-
 ter century preceding the rev-
 olution in 1952.   This improve-
 ment has occurred partly through
 a redistribution of income fa-
 voring urban workers particu-
 larly, through the expenditure
 of large amounts of foreign ex-
 change reserves, and through a
 substantial increase in the na-
 tional debt.
 There has been a major
 shift in investment from the
 luxury housing and public works
 programs of earlier regimes to
 projects which yield returns
 quickly.   Increases in invest-
 ment and in agricultural and
 industrial production have been
 impressive but not large enough
 to assure economic growth at a
 rate faster than that of the
 population.   Thus, despite the
 optimistic goals set forth in
 Egypt's Second Five-Year Plan
 (1960-64), prospects for the
 future are not bright.   The
 Syrian region has separate
 long-term economic development
 schemes of its own.
 Assets and Liabilities
 Egypt is extremely poor
 in natural resources.   Although
 it occupies 386,198 square
 miles, about 96 percent of the
 area is desert.   Thus 25,500,000
 people are crowded into the
 13,900-square-mile Nile Valley,
 which is some 900 miles in
 length but only from one to 12
 miles wide for most of this dis-
 tance.   Below Cairo the Nile
 delta fans out to about 125
 miles in width at the Mediter-
 ranean coast.
 From the 1920s to 1952,
 Egyptian living standards had
 continually declined, partly
 because of the feudal character
 of the society, but mostly--
 since industry was relatively
 unimportant--because of the pop-
 ulation pressure on the narrow
 and virtually unexpandable agri-
 cultural base.   The population
 now is increasing at a rate of
 2.5 percent, by more than 600,-
 000 people annually.   Although
 Egypt's crop yields per acre are
 among the highest in the world,
 its agriculture is inefficient,
 since it employs at near-sub-
 sistence levels an agricultural
 labor force somewhat larger than
 that of the United States.
 Further expansion of farm
 land can occur only at tremen-
 dous cost.   The Aswan High Dam
 will bring an additional 1,000,-
 000 acres into production over
 the next 15 years, but the cost
 will exceed $1.2 billion. Because

 of the population increase, the
 High Dam's addition to the
 6,383,700 acres now irrigated
 will not prevent the amount of
 farm land per capita from de-
 clining even further.
 Aside from modest petro-
 leum reserves and some iron
 ore, the country is virtually
 devoid of natural resources in
 commercial quantities.   Coal
 must be imported from Europe
 for the new steel mill, which
 probably puts the plant into
 the category of an economic
 liability, although it is wide-
 ly viewed in Egypt as a major
 achievement of the revolution.
 Egypt's population is not
 trained in the skills necessary
 for industrial expansion.   New
 plants have required extensive
 training programs for their la-
 bor forces, with the result
 that operations have been rel-
 atively inefficient and prob-
 ably will continue so for some
 time.
 Egypt's almost complete
 dependence on cotton as an
 earner of foreign exchange is
 a major liability of the econ-
 omy which the Nasir regime in-
 herited.                      In the short run,
 the surest way to add to the
 national income is to increase
 the production of cotton and
 especially extra-long-staple
 cottons.   This was successful,
 notably in 1954 and 1957. Like
 most primary commodities, how-
 ever, cotton is not a dependable
 foreign exchange earner, for
 sales are subject to wide
 swings in demand.   For Egypt,
 which specializes in long-
 staple cottons, this is espe-
 cially true, since the growth
 of the world demand for this
 type of cotton has been fall-
 ing off.   For the next several
 years, however, the country
 will have little choice but to
 continue to place heavy empha-
 sis on cotton production.
 Agricultural Reform
 The revolutionary regime
 in 1952 was convinced that all
 of Egypt's economic ills could
 be blamed on the feudalistic
 partnership of the landowners
 and foreigners.   The problem of
 reform was tackled immediately
 with few inhibitions.   Foreign
 businessmen, however, were not
 ousted on a large scale until
 the 1956 Suez crisis, which
 brought with it the side ef-
 fects of Egyptianization of
 businesses and sequestration
 of foreign assets.
 One of the first acts of
 the revolutionary government
 was to destroy the economic and
 political power of the land-
 owners and end the feudalistic
 system in agriculture.   The
 goals set forth in the Egyptian
 Agrarian Reform Law of September
 1952 were achieved in late 1958,
 by which time all land in excess
 of 207.6 acres owned by individ-
 uals had been seized and dis-
 tributed to new owners.   Over
 586,000 acres, almost 10 percent
 of Egypt's agricultural land,
 were redistributed.   By 1960 the
 government plans to distribute
 an additional 207,600 acres now
 held in trust by Moslem institu-
 tions.
 Agricultural output of ma-
 jor field crops increased about
 14 percent between 1952 and 1957,
 but this resulted largely from
 increased use of fertilizer and
 improved seed rather than from
 an increase in acreage or from
 improved cultivation techniques.
 A significant aspect of the
 land reform program was a sub-
 stantial reallocation of income.
 It has been estimated that be-
 fore the revolution about 30
 percent of the national income
 went to a few individuals as
 "unearned" income, primarily in
 the form of land rents.   The
 government, chiefly through tax-
 ation, has transferred a large
 amount of this income to its
 own budget and used it to fi-
 nance welfare projects and de-
 fense.

 Company in 1956.   This action
 won for Egypt a major source
 of badly needed foreign ex-
 change--in 1958 about $120,000,-
 000, or four times the amount
 received before nationaliza-
 tion.   During and after the
 Suez crisis, the bulk of for-
 eign business was subjected to
 some form of Egyptian control.
 Foreign firms now have
 been largely eliminated from
 banking and insurance, while
 in other industries government
 participation has been fostered
 through the establishment of
 an Economic Organization to
 provide a framework for gov-
 ernment control of the economy.
 Since the formation of this or-
 ganization in 1957, there has
 been a steady expansion of
 state control over business.
 Until very recently, foreign
 investment was discouraged,
 particularly by Minister of
 Industry Sidky, whose anti-
 foreign bias blocked foreign
 investment in several specific
 instances.   Sidky's apparently
 declining influence may presage
 new government inter-
 est in encouraging
 foreign investment.
 Egyptianization
 has not been. without.
 cost to Cairo. Payments
 to Britain alone for
 properties taken over
 amount to about
 $80,000,000, and
 since 1956 Egypt has
 lost many of its tra-
 ditional Western cot-
 ton markets.
 Industry
 According to of-
 ficial statistics,
 Egyptian industrial
 output rose 38 per-
 cent from 1952 to
 1957, or an average
 of 8 percent annual-
 ly, and this rate of
 increase probably
 continued through
 1958 and 1959.   In-
 vestment in industry
 has increased mark-
 edly from $43,000,-
 000 in 1952 toabout
 $144,000,000 in 1958.
 Despite this increase, in-
 vestment appears to be too low
 to ensure satisfactory growth
 of the economy.  Gross invest-
 ment in 1957 probably amounted
 to about $280,000,000, or about
 8 to 10 percent of gross na-
 tional product; gross invest-
 ment would have to be increased
 to nearly 20 percent of gross
 national product to expand pro-
 duction as fast as the popula-
 tion is growing.  Not only is
 total investment in Egypt too
 low in terms of the gross na-
 tional product, but there is
 some evidence that the share of
 income devoted to investment
 may have fallen recently.
 Consumption Expands
 Consumption in Egypt is
 admittedly low but still too
 high to permit the capital ac-
 cumulation required for rapid
 economic development.  Much of
 the increased consumption has
 been financed by spending the
 country's foreign exchange re-
 serves, largely acquired during
 World War 11, and by increasing

 Communist countries are committed
 to provide about 54 percent of
 the foreign exchange credits so

 Progress and Prospects
 The regime has registered
 impressive gains in agricultural
 and industrial production since
 1952.   Industrial output has
 increased about 50 percent in
 established industries, and a
 number of new plants have been
 constructed.   Agricultural out-
 put has also increased.   These
 improvements, plus heavy de-
 fense spending and increased
 consumption, have been made
 without serious inflation. The
 groundwork has been laid for
 expansion along the lines en-
 visaged in the Second Five-
 Year Plan, but it appears ex-
 tremely unlikely that the goals
 of the plan will be met within
 the five-year period.   The in-
 crease in production thus far
 is not attributable to the sub-
 stantial economic aid from the
 Communist bloc; however, Com-
 munist assistance will be of
 major importance in the Second
 Five-Year Plan. Cairo's improv-

 Spain's economic stabili-
 zation program, inaugurated in
 July, appears to have made an
 auspicious, start toward curb-
 ing inflationary pressures,
 stabilizing prices, retarding
 the rise in living costs, end-
 ing the drain on gold and for-
 eign exchange reserves, and
 eliminating the country's seri-
 ous balance-of-payments defi-
 cit.   The program, which is
 sponsored by the finance and
 commerce- ministers with the as-
 sistance of the Organization
 for European Economic Coopera-
 tion (OEEC) and the Internation-
 al Monetary Fund (IMF), has
 brought Spain over $400,000,000
 in financial aid.   The program
 faces strong opposition from
 influential vested interests
 and is handicapped by Franco's
 failure to support it publicly.
 Curbs on bank credit to
 private industry and the reluc-
 tance of businessmen to make
 future commitments have slowed
 economic activity.  The feeling
 is widespread among the public
 that the government will not be
 able to carry out the program
 efficiently and fairly.   Unem-
 ployment has increased substan-
 tially, and the great majority
 of workers have lost up to a
 fourth of their take-home pay
 because of shorter hours.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 delay further implementation
 of the program.   This would
 probably result in a worsening
 of the problems it is now seek-
 ing to combat.
 Economic Recession
 The decline in industrial
 output and employment evident
 early in 1959 has been intensi-
 fied since stabilization went
 into effect.   This trend has
 been particularly apparent in
 the major industrial centers
 of Barcelona, Bilbao, and Va-
 lencia and has been most marked
 in the textile,  paper,  and
 leather industries. A number of
 firms have closed down, and
 others have suspended payments.
 Tight credit, reduced domestic
 demand, and a lack of foreign
 exchange for imports of machin-
 ery and raw materials have con-
 tributed heavily to this situa-
 tion, but a major factor is the
 uncertain outlook for business.
 Many businessmen have adopted
 a "wait-and-see" attitude and
 are avoiding new commitments.
 Layoffs to cut production
 costs have swelled the number
 of enemployed.   Nearly all in-
 dustries have eliminated over-
 time, which usually averaged
 two to four hours daily, and
 many are not working full time.
 Because of these cuts, take-home
 pay is inadequate for workers'
 basic needs, even though the
 rise in the cost of living from
 January to October 1959 has been
 moderate compared with that of
 the past two years.
 Nearly one tenth of the
 total labor force is unneeded
 but is maintained on the job
 because the law makes it very
 difficult for permanent employ-
 ees to be discharged.   Labor is
 increasingly concerned that man-
 agement will find a way to re-
 lease these surplus workers,
 who reportedly number some one
 million.   Some firms are said to
 have instituted bankruptcy pro-
 ceedings as a move in this di-
 rection, and many industrialists
 have been clamoring for remedial
 governmental action.  One step
 toward a solution is a recent
 government decree providing some
 unemployment insurance.
 The government continues
 to oppose an across-the-board
 pay raise.  Only about 265,000
 workers have gained economic
 benefits through the collective
 bargaining system which went
 into effect late in 1958. The
 government refuses to approve
 any collective agreements which
 provide for price increases to
 offset wage boosts, and for this
 reason it recently turned down
 an agreement which would have
 benefited over 200,000 workers
 in Barcelona's cotton textile
 industry.
 Attitude of the Government
 The government's attitude
 on the stabilization program has
 been ambivalent. Some officials,
 including Finance Minister Na-
 varro Rubio, enthusiastic over
 the favorable initial results,
 believe that such restrictive
 measures as the curbs on pri-
 vate credit can now be relaxed.
 Others have shown increasing
 concern that the anti-inflation-
 ary aspects of the program will
 produce economic stagnation.
 They feel that private banks
 and business should be encouraged
 to take'advantage of the $262,-
 000,000 allowed for credit ex-
 pansion in 1959, almost all of
 which is still available.
 There are indications that
 Navarro Rubio, seemingly the
 chief exponent of the program,
 is encountering difficulties
 from other cabinet members who
 fear political repercussions
 from the economic adjustments
 necessitated by the program

 and therefore want to increase
 public expenditures above the
 $1.905 billion ceiling set for
 1959.   In addition, there is
 opposition from vested inter-
 ests apprehensive over the com-
 petition generated by liber-
 alized trade and a freer for-
 eign investment climate and
 from nationalists who prefer
 that Spain remain politically
 and economically isolated.
 The major shortcoming,
 however, has been the govern-
 ment's continued failure to
 explain clearly to labor and
 business the objectives and im-
 plications of the plan.   Gov-
 ernment officials seem unaware
 of the need to develop public
 confidence and support. Even
 more serious, Franco has re-
 frained from putting his per-
 sonal leadership and prestige
 behind the plan, so that in
 the event of a serious wave of
 popular discontent over its
 impact or the plan's failure,
 its chief proponents can be
 made the scapegoats.
 The future of the stabili-
 zation program is likely to de-
 SECRET
 Pend mainly on the government's
 awareness of the need to build
 up public confidence in it and
 to convince business that the
 sacrifices  demanded of it are
 temporary.  The government is
 not agreed on what the program
 really means or on the next
 steps to be taken, particularly
 with regard to decisions on fu-
 ture economic policy to stimu-
 late plans for private invest-
 ment.   Some remedial action is
 likely to be suggested by the
 OEEC mission which is scheduled
 to arrive in Madrid on 4 Decem-
 ber to evaluate the effect of
 the measures taken thus far
 under the program.
 The threat of rising unem-
 ployment, which some fear may
 reach 500,000 by early 1960,
 will generate social unrest and
 possibly widespread worker dis-
 turbances.   Should political
 pressures force a general wage
 rise,  removal of the curbs
 on bank credit to the private
 sector, or an increase in pub-
 lic spending, the program would
 be in serious difficulties.
 Such steps would be tantamount
 to rejecting the plan and would
 probably result in a renewal
 of the  'inflationary  cycle.
