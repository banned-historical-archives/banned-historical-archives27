 Several vic;nettes abotY; Chinese leaders have
 surfaced in recent weeks.   Although some of the
 stories may be apocryphal, they provide some clues
 as to how the Chinese peop'..e perceive their leaders.
 One story circulating in Peking is that Vice
 Premier Teng Hsiao-ping htis virtually invited criti-
 cism of himself by stating that anyone who assumes
 responsibility should not be afraid of criticism.
 The story sounds very much like the rather blunt,
 outspoken Teng and is consistent with a number of
 indications that his confidence has grown along with
 his authority.
 The latest in a series of tales about Chairman
 Mao's displeasure with Chiang Ching is that he re-
 portedly rebuked her last fall for her efforts to
 make a major political issue of using the "back
 door," an expression that refers to obtaining jobs
 or entrance into universities through personal con-
 nections.  The "back door" issue did emerge rather
 suddenly in late 1973 and tended to divert public
 attention from the then more important anti-Confucius
 campaign. Peking finally issued a directive in March
 1974 deferring any action on the issue until a later
 date, and the much publicized "back door" controversy
 eventually subsided.  Peking is still on public record
 as opposing "back door" methods, but no steps have
 been taken against people who have used such methods.
 According to the story, Mao's reason for want-
 ing to turn a blind eye toward the "back door" issue
 was that it involved so many people that to make a
 public issue of it would be too disruptive.  The
 reasoning is certainly sound:  during the brief
 period when the issue was daily propaganda fare, it
 created considerable confusion and consternation

 among university students who had gained admission
 through their influential relatives.  Some students
 left the universities, others were pressured into
 doing so, and still others agonized over what to do.
 In any event, whether or not Mao did argue with his
 wife over pursuing this matter, the Chinese people
 see her as the person who opened this Pandora's box
 and obviously as a disruptive force on the political
 scene.
 Another story about Chiang Ching is that she
 failed to applaud, unlike other Chinese leaders,
 after a private screening of a film about "Iron Man
 Wang," China's model worker who died a few years
 ago.  The film was probably not produced under her
 auspices.   In contrast to the growing number of docu-
 mentaries (such as this one) that are now being shown
 in the country, Chiang Ching's "model" cultural works
 are idealizations, not documentaries.
 Propaganda that has supported Chiang Ching's
 role in culture has not been noticeably receptive
 to work other than her "models" and has occasionally
 denigrated them.  Under these circumstances, it
 seems entirely consistent with Chang Ching's image
 that she would not applaud a cultural effort that
 was not of her own doing.
 There is in fact some tenuous evidence that
 Madame Mao is not quite the cultural force

 Ilocal Honan operas
 were enthusiastically receive  but that Chiang Ching's
 models were nowhere  to be seen.           A recent broadcast
 from Shantung Province, Chiang Ching's home, failed
 to mention th4 model works in a lengthy account of
 cultural activities.
 According to the story about the private film
 showing, party Vice Chairman Wang Hung-wen stopped
 applauding when he noticed that Chiang Ching was not
 doing so.   The Chinese people apparently have the

 there J.s reason
 for concern.  AS in Chekiang, the Wuhan militia was
 disbanded for participating in factional struggles
 rather than repressing them                                      25X1
 The Wuhan militia is now un er   a direct command of
 the Hupeh provincial authorities, and Peking presum-
 ably hopes that they can straighten out the situation
 without having to call for troops.
 September 2, 1975
 With some notable exceptions, Peking's campaign
 to improve unity and stability and boost production
 has made progress this year.  The level of urban
 crime seems to have been reduced and some advances
 have been made in dealing with disgruntled youths,
 who were the mai.i perpetrators.   However, the inter-
 vention of regular troop                                         25X1

 to restore pu  is order and local authority to
 pre - Cultural Revolution levels has a considerable
 distance to go.
 The militia, particularly the urban militia,
 has been Peking's primary instrument to enhance
 order in the last two years.   In the aggregate,
 the militia has performed reasonably well.   The
 upgrading of the militia has allowed the regime to
 virtually complete the removal of the military from
 the expanded civil affairs duties acquired as a
 result of the Cultural. Revolution, and has supported
 the priority goal of reducing the military's
 political involvement.   Thus, when Peking called
 in the PLA in Chekiang--and in effect admitted
 failure on the part of the militia--it was not
 an easy decision.  Furthermore, the well-publicized
 nature of the decision seems to be a warning to all
 parties, including the militia and its leaders, that
 factionalism will not be tolerated.

 Another example of progress was reflected in
 Szechwan, which announced on May 21 that the
 Chengtu Municipal militia command had been estab-
 lished.   Szechwan has been one of the more turbulent
 areas in China, and the creation of the Chengtu com-
 mand is several months behind most other major cities.
 One problem that seems to have arisen as the
 result of Peking's emphasis on reducing factionalism
 is the abuse of militia authority in the name of law
 and order.                                          activities
 of militia      s in Peking often border on criminal
 acts--including street fighting with juvenile gangs.

 of the minister of foreign trade, who resisted their
 investigation while in a Peki ncr  rPQI-  11ran.l-

 it.   In Peking, this might include alternate
 politburo member Ni Chih-fu, a model worker who
 commands the capital workers militia.  Ni is
 hardly a major political target, but the real
 architects of the urban militia movement are
 difficult to identify.  Wang dung-wen's name has
 been mentioned as a possible national militia
 leader, but the impetus behind the upgrading of
 urban militia is more likely to have come from more
 moderate regime leaders.  With the political left
 in disarray, any backlash is likely to be limited
 at present.

 The Commitment to Tanzania:   Hardly Altruism
 25X1
 Festivities surrounding the formal completion
 of the five-year, $402 million Tan-Zam railroad in
 Dar es Salaam this fall and the probable attendance
 of a high-ranking Chinese delegation will bring into
 focus Peking's heavy investment in Tanzania.  Presi-
 dent Nyerere's government is, in fact, the leading
 African recipient of Chinese economic aid and the
 second leading recipient worldwide of military as-
 sistance from Peking.
 The Chinese will maintain a significant aid
 program and large numbers of personnel in Tanzania
 well beyond ribbon-cutting ceremonies on the Tan-
 Zam line.  Although the arrangements are not yet
 final, several hundred technicians will probably
 stay on to assist in operating and managing the
 railroad. The continued presence of about 300 Chi-
 nese now working on several small rural development
 and construction projects and of some 750 Chinese
 military advisers also seems assured.  Under a $74-
 million agreement signed by Peking and Dar es Salaam
 last year, the Chinese have also agreed to construct
 two rail spurs into coal- and iron-rich areas in
 northwestern Tanzania and to help develop these re-
 sources.
 Despite its scope and expense, the Chinese
 effort in Tanzania is not aimed primarily at short-
 term economic and political goals within the coun-
 try itself.  On the economic front, the Tanzanians
 have little that China needs in terms of raw ma-
 terials and the Tanzanian market is a minuscule one
 for the Chinese.   Politically, Peking certainly
 values Dar es Salaam as a reliable diplomatic ally
 and is undoubtedly pleased that Nyerere has bor-
 rowed from the Chinese model for his own domestic
 programs.

 Such gains, however, could probably have been
 achieved with much less expense, and Peking clearly
 views its considerable investment in Tanzania in
 terms of the long haul and the larger African--and
 Third World--context.  On this broader plane, Pe-
 king has attempted to create in its aid program in
 Tanzania a model demonstrating to other African
 and developing countries China's willingness to ex-
 tend generous and politically untied aid without any
 danger of foreign subversion or interference in in-
 ternal affairs.   To this end, the Chinese have ap-
 plied themselves to their aid projects in Tanzania
 with unusual energy--particularly the. Tan-Zam proj-
 ect, which will be completed well ahead of sched-
 ule--while carefully avoiding any impression that
 they are pressing for direct influence over the
 country.  Peking, in fact, has gone so far to limit
 the impact of its large presence on the domestic
 scene in Tanzania as to provoke some criticism from
 Tanzanian officials.  The low key Chinese approach
 has had the overall effect, however, of building
 trust and allaying suspicions both in Dar es
 Salaam and elsewhere in the region.
 The establishment of durable relations between
 Peking and Dar es Salaam has also given the Chinese
 an important leg up in their competition with Mos-
 cow for influence with regional black nationalist
 movements.  Peking has long acted as Tanzania's
 agent in training and equipping various guerrilla
 groups.   This direct Chinese access and backing
 from the influential Nyerere were instrumental in
 gaining Peking the inside track with Samora Machel's
 forces in Mozambique.  The Chinese are moving in a
 similar manner to develop a strong position in
 Rhodesia, where Peking long backed the Zimbabwe
 African National Union (ZANU) and has recently
 stated its willingness to train and equip the joint
 forces of the African National Council--an um-
 brella organization which has absorbed ZANU and other
 Rhodesian nationalist groups.  The breakdown last

 week of talks between Council leaders and Salisbury
 and the increased possibility that guerrilla opera-
 tions might resume in Rhodesia have played com-
 fortably into Peking's hand.
 While China is on the whole probably satisfied
 with the returns from its commitment to Tanzania,
 the relationship has not been without its strains.
 Strident Chinese calls for "armed struggle" in
 southern Africa and repeated warnings that efforts
 at compromise between black nationalists and the
 white-minority governments were "political decep-
 tions" leave little doubt over Peking's displeas-
 ure with Nyerere's--and Zambian President Kaunda's
 --support for talks between Salisbury and the Rho-
 desian nationalist groups.   Peking has also had to
 draw the line on continued requests for arms from
 Dar es Salaam and can only view as ingratitude
 Tanzanian questioning of the quality of equipment
 already delivered.  Tanzania's acceptance of
 $74 million of Soviet military assistance in 1974
 undoubtedly increased Chinese irritation.  Peking
 has been willing to play down such frictions, how-
 ever, and this is another measure of the central
 role Tanzania has played and will continue to  la
 in China's strategy in the area.

 The Restriction of Bourgeois Rights:
 Shades of the Great Leap Forward
 F7           I
 Efforts to restrict "bourgeois rights" have
 intensified recently as the movement to consolidate
 the dictatorship of the proletariat continues.  The
 major targets of this phase of the campaign include
 free markets, private property, private plots and
 other types of sideline production.  Although these
 "bourgeois rights" are protected under the Chinese
 constitution--Chang Chun-chiao in his speech on the
 revision of the Constitution stressed that these
 rights are a necessary supplement to the socialist
 economy--a recent Red Flag article indicates that
 the party's line now demands their restriction.
 The heaviest pressure appears to be directed at
 the free markets.  Free markets in some provinces
 have been closed and hawkers are subject to arrest
 by security officials and confiscation of their goods.
 Free markets in other provinces, however, remain
 open but are subject to stringent controls.  Opera-
 tions of the remaining free markets in Kwangtung are
 controlled by regulations apparently contained in a
 recent provincial level document.  The new restric-
 tions include limited operation of the markets every
 fifth day, strictly controlled selling prices, and a
 ban on selling goods covered by the state procurement
 sli?stem--rice, tea, wheat and flour to name a few.
 Moreover, hawkers are required to obtain certificates
 stating that their communes have fulfilled the state
 quota on those items being offered for sale.  Public
 security forces, special market personnel, and the
 militia have been mobilized to enforce these new
 measures.

 Although no clear policy toward the restriction
 of the other "bourgeois rights" has yet emerged, re-
 cent Red Flag articles indicate that any private
 activity which interferes with tt,e collective process
 or is not included in the state plan will be restricted.
 The absence of any clear central direction has led to
 widely disparate methods of implementation in the
 provinces.  In some provinces all kinds of private
 activity including private plots are being banned,
 while in others only the more flagrant offenses are
 being remedied.
 Although the movement to restrict "bourgeois
 rights" has many political overtones, recent articles
 are stressing the detrimental economic effects that
 result from the failure to restrict these rights.
 One report suggests that the recent poor harvest in
 one area of Kwangtung was caused by too much atten-
 tion to private plots.  However, the last time the
 leadership tried to abolish private plots and other
 incentives during the Great Leap Forward the results
 were disastrous.  Peasant intransigence and bad
 harvests forced the leadership to retrench.
 These new attempts to restrict "bourgeois rights"
 are already meeting with public opposition.
 Besides the certain econoinic effects, the restric-
 tion of bourgeois rights may have other serious con-
 sequences, which could threaten the stability that
 the leadership is trying so hard to achieve.  Under
 the circumstances--a stricter birth control policy
 which uses rations as a disincentive plus youths
 without ration cards who have returned illegally from
 the countryside--the proliferation of black markets
 is inevitable.  Already hawkers in Peking and Kwangtung
 are avoiding the restrictions and militia patrols by
 25X1

 selling door to door.  The expansion of black markets
 could also contribute to the rising creme problems in

 China Trade Delegation To Visit the US
 A high-level delegation from China's Council
 for the Promotion of International Trade will arrive
 in the US on September 5 for an 18-day tour,                  The
 mission will be composed of leaders of the council
 and representatives of the machinery, minerals and
 metals, and native produce trade corporations.
 Meetings will be held with members of Congress,
 government officials, and US businessmen to discuss
 Chinese exports and imports, trade exhibitions, and
 regional trade promotion offices in the US.  The
 Chinese will also want to discuss the legal issues
 in US-China trade, including most-favored-nation
 treatment, a subject on which the Chinese are in-
 creasingly vocal.
 China has expressed concern over the imbalance
 in US-China trade and has been seeking to promote
 exports to the US.  Early this year a Chinese tex-
 tile delegation visited the US; a mission from the
 light industry trade corporation will arrive here
 next month.  Last year, China's trade deficit with
 the US reached $700 million.
 US-China trade is off substantially this year
 because of the sharp drop in Chinese purchases of
 US agricultural products.  US exports to China for
 the year will reach about $250 million, compared
 with $807 million for 1974.  Chinese exports to the
 US will total about $150 million, up from $115 mil-
 lion last year.
 For the first half of 1975, US exports to China
 were $147 million and US imports were $73 million.
 Deliveries of US cotton from 1974 contracts accounted

 for about half of China's imports from the US dur-
 ing th:.s period.  Ammonia plants, oil exploration
 equipment, and construction and mining machinery
 purchased in 1974 made up most of the remainder.
 Nonferrous metals, textiles,chemicals, and
 foodstuffs made up the bulk of China's sales to the
 US.   The Chinese are again purchasing US steel
 scrap, which will be an important item in trade
 through December.  No further imports of US grain
 or cotton are expected this year.

 Peking has moved rather quickly in the wake
 of the 'Bangladesh coup to reinforce its improved
 position in South Asia.   Last Sunday, only two
 weeks after the overthrow of Mujibur Rahman, China
 extended recognition to the new government.   Peking
 consistently had refused to ao this far with the

 Peking is well aware that the Indians are not
 going to take kindly to the decision to recognize
 Dacca, but undoubtedly calculates that recognition
 will do more to deter rather than provoke moves by
 New Delhi.   India's somewhat more accommodating
 attitude toward Dacca in recent days may have
 influenced this judgment.  The Chinese all along
 have carefully avoided antagonizing the Indians
 about developments in Bangladesh.
 The change of government in Dacca would seem
 to give Peking some badly needed leverage in the
 region which it can use in dealing with India.
 At the same time the Chinese have generally avoided
 critical commentary on Prime Minister Gandhi's
 recent internal difficulties.  While this approach
 will not be lost on New Delhi, the Indians are
 likely to consider any Chinese rapprochement with
 Dacca as a far more significant development--and
 one that is inimical to their interests_
