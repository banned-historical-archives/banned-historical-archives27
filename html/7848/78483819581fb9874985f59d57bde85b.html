CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN

DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
*USSR-China:LIfter long and bitter wrangling during 
September and October in meetings preliminary to the 
world Communist conclave to begin on 10 November in 
Moscow, the Soviet and Chinese parties managed to ar-
rive at some compromise formulas on certain aspects of 
their dispute but remained as far apart as ever on other  
issues, including some of the central ones. 
the Soviet party, represented by Suslov and Kozlov, traded 
personal insults with the Chinese delegation, headed by 
Teng Hsiao-ping, and both parties at times descended to 
"puerile but heated" exchanges. Most of the parties rep-
resented supported the Soviet views, but Albania continu-
ally and the Asian satellites frequently sided with the Chi-
nese, At a banquet following the apparently inconclusive 
meetings, Khrushchev and Teng Hsiao-ping quarreled 
"violently" about the nature of Soviet leadership of the world 
Communist movement   
(Page 1) 
II. ASIA-AFRICA 
Jordan-LIAR: Jordanian forces have been ordered to 
end the "state of emergency" alert in which they were placed 
after the assassination of Prime Minister Majalli last August, 
and some units--in addi-
tion to the Guards Brigade already withdrawn--are being 
pulled back from the Syrian border area. There has been no 
evidence of a comparable step-down in the readiness posture 
of Syrian forces near the frontier. The Jordanian action indi-
cates diminished concern in Amman over the imminence of a 
large-scale military clash with the UAR, but terrorist and 
propaganda activity by each side can be expected to continue.

Republic of the Congo: The prospect for a full-
dress UN debate on the Congo has brought a reitera-
tion by Tshombe and Lumumba_91 their positions in 
�the current political impasse. (In a 7 November mem-
orandum passed to the American consul, Tshombe ex-
pressed the hope that Congolese and Katangan leaders 
would agree on a "new" formula for a political associa-
tion�presumably a confederation�which would be "in 
conformity with the regional peculiarities" of the Congo 
area: On the same day, Lumumba endorsed the UN role 
In the Congo and applauded the criticism of Brussels and 
the Mobutu government contained in the report of UN rep-
resentative Dayal. 
In contrast with the political lull in Leopoldville, the 
struggle in Orientale Province between pro- and anti-
Lumumba elements continues unabated.LCongo Army ele-
ments reportedly threatened on 4 November to march on

South Vietnam: The South Vietnamese Government's 
communique of 8 November charging an incursion into its 
territory by three regular North Vietnamese battalions 
from bases in Laos appears designed to dramatize its 
struggle against local Communist dissidence. The 
charges apparently refer to the previously reported at-
tacks between 21 and 26 October against outposts near the 
Laotian border in the central highlands of South Vietnam. 
These attacks reportedly were carried out by bands of lo-
cal tribesmen under Communist cadres who probably were 
Infiltrated from North Vietnam, In implying that its charges 
may be brought before the International Control Commission, 
South Vietnam may hope to focus attention on North Vietnam's 
increasing activity aimed at the overthrow of the Diem gov-
ernment.

Moscow and Peiping Fail to Resolve Disagreements  
an account of the 
conference in Moscow during September and October of 
bloc and nonbloc Communist parties which was called in 
an effort to resolve Sino-Soviet differences prior to the 
meeting of world Communist leaders that is to begin 
on 10 November. According to this accou4t, the exchang-
es between the Soviet and Chinese representatives were 
extremely bitter, and a number of issues were left un-
settlecti 
fAs a basis for discussion, the Soviet party had pre-
pared a document setting forth issues in the Sino-Soviet 
dispute. Some 100 pages of amendments to this document 
reportedly were proposed during the conference:j 
ahe principal Chinese spokesman, Teng Hsiao-ping, 
"fiercely attacked" Soviet strategy for the world Commu-
nist movement. In particular, there was a "heated argu-
ment" about Soviet views on the noninevitability of war, 
with the Chinese insisting that the bloc should be willing 
to undertake and to support local wars. In the course of 
this discussion, Teng reportedly reaffirmed the Chinese 
position that Peiping should be given nuclear weapons and 
rejected the idea that the Soviet Union should have a con-
trolling voice in the defenses of other bloc countries:3 
EThe Chinese further attacked the USSR for having with-
drawn technicians from China. Moscow countered that the 
technicians had been withdrawn because Peiping had tried to 
indoctrinate them-4 
[In the last of the discussions, Soviet spokesman Suslov 
criticized the Chinese at considerable length, both on sub-
stantive issues and for their derisive attitude toward the 
"right of a majority," i. e. those supporting the Soviet party. 
Suslov argued that the decisions supported by the majority 
should be made unanimougj

The Situatioiti. the Congo  
*ape 
The likelihood of a full-dress UN debate on the 
Congo has brought a reiteration by Tshombe and Lu-
mumba of their respective positions. On 7 November, 
Lumumba endorsed the current UN role in the Congo 
and applauded the criticism of Brussels and the Mobutu 
government contained in the report of UN representative 
Dayal. 
{Also on 7 November, Tshombe. passed a memorandum 
to the American Consulate in Elisabethville expressing hope 
that Congolese and Katangan leaders would agree on a "new" 
formula for political association�presumably a confedera-
tion--which would be "in conformity with the regional pecu-
liarities" of the Congo area. Tshombe has periodically in-
dicated he would accept some form of political association 
with the Congo, provided it involved a sufficient degree of 
provincial autonomq 
In contrast with the political lull in Leopoldville, the 
power struggle in Orientale Province between pro- and anti-
Lumumba elements continues unabated. CA recent shipment 
of automobile parts from Czechoslovakia to Stanleyville was 
reported to include arms for pro-Lumumba forces there. 
Elements sympathetic to Lumumba, led by his leftist vice 
premier, Antoine Gizenga, have maintained the initiative in 
Orientale Province and have imprisoned or placed under, house 
arrest numerous supporters of Colonel Mobutu. 
  however, the Congo Army garrison 
at Watsa�in northeast Orientale Province--has threatened to 
march on Stanleyville if imprisoned army officers there are 
not re1eased:7 
Elsewhere, there are indications that many Congolese are 
sensitive to the need for a restoration of political stability. In 
two areas of Kivu Province--one of them a Lumumba strong-
hold�minor officials and businessmen recently spoke to an 
American official concerning the need for a restoration of 
popular confidence and for the return of Belgian employers. 
Several expressed apprehension concerning the effect of a re-
turn to power by Lumumba.

The Situation' in Laos  
(yormer Premier Phoui Sananikone, who has just returned 
to Laos after an absence of several months, is in Lu ng 
Prabang assessing the situation with an eye toward ttempting 
to reconcile non-Communist elements in Laos. Phoui is a 
conservative, old-guard politician who shared the leadership 
of the probably now moribund Rally of the Lao People with 
Souvanna Phouma. In the past he took a somewhat harder line 
toward the Communist-dominated Pathet Lao than did Souvanna. 
Phoui could conceivably serve as a bridge between the v rious 
factions which have arisen since Captain Kong Le's August 
coup, although his usefulness may be impaired by bitterness 
stemming from the conflict with the King and General Phoumi's 
Committee for Defense of National Interests which led to 
Phoui's fall from power early last Januarya 
tiPhoui will presumably consult in Luang Prabang with 
Souvanna Phouma, who is on another fence-mending tour of 
the northern provinces. Phoui has already concluded that 
it is necessary to encourage opposition to the Pathet Lao and 
Kong Le in Vientiane itself, rather than to rely solely on build-
ing up anti-Pathet forces in Luang Prabang and Sav nn khet. 
Souvanna and his moderate supporters have for some time 
been trying to pursue such a policy, but with only marginal 
effect 3 
an a statement to the National Assembly on 7 November--
just prior to his departure for the north--Souvanna is reliably 
reported to have informed the deputies that nothing had been 
achieved in the nearly four weeks of talks with the Pathet Lao. 
He claimed the government had rejected Pathet demands for 
inclusion in a coalition government, while the Pathet Lao had 
stalled on the government's demand for a supervised cease-fire 
between opposing forces in the field. A Pathet Lao negotiator 
is said to have gone to Sam Neua to get a decision from Prince)

CAt the same session, the assembly reportedly appointed 
a delegation to enter into negotiations with General Phoumi's 
Savannakhet Revolutionary Committee. The delegation re-
portedly will seek talks with Phoumi's representatives at 
some neutral site, since it fears it will be arrested if it goes 
to Savannakhet. The chances of success in this venture are 
highly uncertain, although a settlement worked out by the 
assembly might possibly be attractive to both Souvanna and 
Phoumi as a face-saving means of reaching a settlement 
without the necessity of a direct personal confrontation.

"Guided Democracy" in Indonesia  
President Suk,arno's appointment of leaders of the 610-
member People's Consultative Congress on 8 November com-
pletes the reorganization of the Indonesian legislature under 
the reinvoked 1945 constitution. His choice of the congres-
sional leaders, drawn from the three major parties and the 
army with a nonparty leftist as acting chairman, is continued 
evidence that the president is still trying to integrate all po-
litical elements under "guided democracy." 
The two-house legislature will be a rubber-stamp organiza-
tion, as evidenced by activities of the Council of Representatives. 
The Communists control about 25 percent of the members of 
both houses. The or nizational trappings of "guided democra-
cy" also include the Supreme Advisory Council,which is expected 
to ensure political guidance, and the National Planning Board to 
provide economic direction. Yet to be formed is the National 
Front, a mass organization to function through a multilevel 
structure ranging from a central board in Djakarta to village 
organizations throughout the nation; as yet, only the central 
board has been appointed. 
Sukarno's stated ambition is to create an administration un-
hampered by political dissension which can direct all its energies 
toward national fulfillment. He regards the various councils, 
all of which include Communists, as an important step toward 
his goal. In practice, the congress and councils are largely 
facades behind which Sukarno, assisted by the cabinet and the 
army, governs the country. 
Although the army continues to obstruct the Communists in 
a fairly effective manner, it has failed to influence Sukarno 
against the Communist party or against the acceptance of large 
amounts of bloc aid. he Indonesian cabinet is reported, as of 
1 November, to have decided to proceed with a Soviet loan offer 
of over $400,000,000 for naval equipment4
