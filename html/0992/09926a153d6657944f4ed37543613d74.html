PERSIAN GULF: Situation Report 
Military Activity 
er-k/ )1ixibrIddeit.) 
A US warship escorting a Military Sealift Command tanker out of the 
Gulf yesterday fired warning shots at several Iranian small boats after 
_they continued to approach despite verbal warnings to turn away.  
 Iran says its warplanes bombed key military supply 
routes near Al Amarah on the southern front and struck oil 
installations in northern Iraq in response to recent Iraqi airstrikes. 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
 25X1 
Comment: The US convoy was near Iran's Abu Musa Island when the 
incident occurred. The limited number of boats involved?a dhow and 
two Boston Whaler-type speedboats?suggests the Iranians were 
probably testing US reactions. They may have hoped, however, to 
provoke a US attack as a way of underscoring Soviet First Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vorontsov's strong condemnation of the US military 
presence in the Gulf during his trip to Tehran that ended yesterday.

Vorontsov's Trip Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Vorontsov returned to Moscow

ylovjAmiKuwait, and Iran. hetdelivered  
" messages on the current situation in the Gulf to the leaders of Iraq   
and Kuwait from General Secretary Gorbachev and to Iranian Forei n 
Minister Velayati from Foreign Minister Shevardnadze. 
According to Soviet and Kuwaiti media reports, Gorbachev's 
messages asserted that the USSR is doing everything in its power to 
achieve a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and called for support 
from Baghdad and Kuwait for Moscow's idea of creating a UN naval 
force to ensure freedom of navigation in the Gulf. Kuwaiti Foreign 
Minister Sabah noted in a statement to the press, however, that 
Vorontsov had not brought any new proposal for ending the war. 
Gorbachev's message to the Amir of Kuwait stated that the USSR 
"firmly supports the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
Kuwait." Kuwaiti leaders, publicly interpreting this as a warning to 
Iran, claim Vorontsov told them that Moscow had rotested to Tehran 
over the recent Iranian missile attacks on Kuwait.

Comment: The primary purpose of Vorontsov's trip appears to 
have been to reassure Iraq and Kuwait, both increasingly critical 
of Moscow's unwillingness to enforce UN Security Council 
Resolution 598, of continued Soviet support. The Soviets probably 
believe that the best way to boost the prospects for their scheme to 
replace the Western naval presence in the Gulf with a UN force is to 
obtain Gulf Arab states' endorsement. Vorontsov's failure to obtain 
such an endorsement and his subsequent travel to Iran suggest that, 
despite some relatively positive comments on his talks from both 
Kuwait and Iraq, he did not succeed in allaying suspicions about 
Soviet intentions.

USSR: Moscow Party Leader Under Fire 
A top Soviet official's public criticism of Moscow party chief 
Boris Yel'tsin, an outspoken reform proponent and Politburo 
candidate member, probably indicates that General Secretary 
Gorbachev is unwilling?or unable at this time?to challenge 
more conservative forces in the leadershi ? led or 
Ligachev, his senior deputy in the party. 
At a press conference in Moscow onatur.?13, Central Committee 
Secretary Luk'yanov said that he and other members had disagreed 
with Yel'tsin's statements at the Central Committee plenum on 
21 October and claimed that Yel'tsin himself realizes he made a 
mistake. Luk'yanov said that the Politburo and Moscow party 
organization would review Yel'tsin's request to resign his posts. At the 
same time, Luk'yanov maintained there is no rift in the leadership and 
that all plenum speakers "without exception" fully supported the 
report given by Gorbachev at that meeting. 
Comment: Gorbachev may be seeking to prevent an open 
polarization of the leadership by blaming Yel'tsin for the squabble 
rather than backing the Moscow party chief's criticism of Ligachev for 
blocking reform. Yel'tsin has been a close Gorbachev ally and, like 
Luk'yanov, one of the most reform-minded members of the 
leadership. Gorbachev evidently wants to distance himself from the 
outspoken, abrasive Yel'tsin, however, rather than risk an open 
breach between his supporters and those of Ligachev. Yel'tsin is 
staying on the job for now, but his political position appears severely 
damaged. Unless he receives stronger backing from Gorbachev, he is 
likely to be replaced in the near future.

SYRIA: New Prime Minister 
President Assad's removal of Prime Minister Kasm over the 
weekend is probably an attempt to quiet dissatisfaction among 
his key subordinates in the Syrian military in advance of the Arab 
summit opening ftelet-Stmdaj 
L Ykilte 
Assad accepted Kasm's resignation and immediately ordered 
Speaker of the People's Council Zu'bi to form a new government. 
Rumors of such a change have been rife since two ministers in 
Kasm's cabinet received no-confidence votes last week as a result of 
the ongoing investigation by parliament of corruption charges.

sgu_g _senior Alawite officers 
Peeetttfr signed a letter claiming that Kasm had insulted the military40/ 
by supporting his Custom Minister's attempt to confiscate goods 
belonging to Defense Minister Talas at the Syria-Lebanon border. 
Comment: Kasm's removal has been expected, largely because of his 
association with Syria's dismal economic performance over recent 
years. Even more damaging for Kasm, however, was his appointment 
as the spearhead of Assad's latest anticorruption campaign; it ran 
him afoul of many prominent members of the ruling Alawite minority 
community. Kasm's recent sparring with Talas and the Alawite 
military elite and the President's desire to restore harmony to his 
regime left Assad little choice other than to discard his loyal fellow 
Ba'thist.

and may even receive another position in government in return for his 
service. The designation of Zu'bi, a Sunni politician, does not suggest 
there will be meaningful reforms soon.

"International Debt Agency" Scheme 
The banks discussing the "international debt agency" concept have not worked out its 
details, the broad outline of a plan under which such an agency 
would purchase the debt of troubled LDCs at secondary market values?generally far lower 
than the face value. The LDCs would be required to repay only the discounted value of the 
debt. The banks probably expect that funding for the agency would come from banks and 
governments in the developed countries and from multilateral lending institutions. The banks 
believe that this approach would provide several benefits to both the banking community and 
the world economy, including: 
? Ending the troublesome process of negotiating new money packages. 
? Freeing banks' bad debt reserves for more promising investment. 
? Helping LDCs achieve higher economic growth by easing their debt burden. 
Although this scheme appeals to West German and Swiss banks, those with smaller loan-loss 
reserves are less inclined to absorb the losses resulting from selling the debt at discount. 
Moreover, governments would have a tough time politically enacting such bailout policies at 
taxpayers' expense.

WESTERN EUROPE: Changing Attitude on LDC Debt 
West European bankers agree that the LDC debt situation is 
getting worse but differ on what to do about it. 
West European banks are worried that 
the deteriorating political situation in several Third World debtor 
countries?including Brazil, Argentina, and the Philippines?will 
prevent these countries from making concessions in future 
refinancing negotiations. Two major Swiss banks and one large West 
German bank are informally considering the benefits of forming an 
"international debt agency" of governments and banks of the 
developed countries to purchase at a discount a portion of troubled 
LDC debt. The banks are reluctant, however, to move forward now. 
West Germany's largest 
commercial lender, recently said that consideration should be given 
to forgiving some LDC debt?an idea until now rejected by most 
major banks. 
French and British banks, meanwhile, remain skeptical although 
basically supportive of  the US debt initiative. French banks, 
consider the idea of an international debt 
agency unworkable. 
Comment: Many West European banks, even those backing the US 
initiative, apparently believe that Brazil's inflexible position on interest 
payments and economic adjustment might shift negotiating leverage 
in favor of the debtors. Although the banks are unlikely to support an 
international debt agency at present, discussions about the idea and 
growing talk about debt forgiveness indicate that some banks will 
stiffen their resistance to new money packages and try to get the 
governments of the developed countries more involved in the LDC 
problem. 
West European governments, however, are not likely to take the lead 
in developing a new debt strategy. Although they have cooperated 
with US officials in the past by persuading European banks to 
contribute to refinancings, they are much less likely to do so if they 
perceive continued deterioration in the debt situation. Most will be 
inclined to look to the IMF and World Bank to handle countries with 
severe debt problems.

CHINA: New Central Committee 
The rejuvenated Central Committee endorsed at the close of the 
eight-day 13th Party Congress does not include Deng Xiaoping and 
eight other elderly Politburo members, thus ensuring Deng's 
promised "retirement"?and that of his leading orthodox rivals?
from the party's top policymaking organs. Deng and two other 
members of the Politburo Standing Committee, party traditionalists 
Chen Yun and Li Xiannian, stepped down, as did ideological 
hardliners Peng Zhen and Hu Qiaomu. Altogether, more than 
90 members of the 12th Central Committee are not returning. 
Comment: Despite formally retiring from the Politburo, the 
83-year-old Deng remains China's paramount leader and is staying on 
as chairman of the party's powerful Military Commission. Several of 
his most influential orthodox rivals have moved to a party advisory 
group that was instrumental in forcing the resignation of Hu Yaobang 
as General Secretary in January; they will remain politically active and 
a continuing problem for reformers led by Deng and acting General 
Secretary Zhao Ziyang. The new Committee meets two key reformist 
goals. Its 175 members on average are younger-55 years old?and 
better educated-75 percent have some university education?than 
their predecessors. Zhao will be confirmed as General Secretary, and 
members of the party Politburo, Politburo Standing Committee, 
Secretariat, and Military Commission will be named at a Central 
Committee plenum today. 
PAKISTAN: Resignation of Foreign Minister 
7-- n.,/ Yievkidow 
Islamabad radioester-eliail announced the resignation of Foreign 
Minister Yaqub Khan for "personal reasons." Prime Minister Junejo 
has not named a successor, but, under Pakistan's constitution, will 
himself serve as acting Foreign Minister until someone is designated 
for the post. Minister of State Noorani, Yaqub's senior deputy, has 
been named to represent Islamabad when the UN General Assembly 
takes up this month the annual Pakistani-sponsored resolution calling 
for the withdrawal of foreign forces?in effect, Soviet troops?from 
Afghanistan. 
Comment: Yaqub's resignation had been expected since he 
announced his ultimately unsuccessful candidacy for the top post in 
UNESCO, and his exit does not signal a shift in Pakistan's policy on 
Afghanistan. His most likely successor is Noorani, a veteran Muslim 
League politician who enjoys the confidence of both President Zia and 
Junejo. Less subtle in negotiations than Yaqub, Noorani has a 
reputation for outspokenness.

JAPAN: Lagging Interest in US Securities 
25X1 
Japanese investors will probably purchase and hold only a small 
quantity of US Government securities at this week's US Treasury 
auction. Japanese insurance 25X1 
companies and trust banks?the largest Japanese purchasers of US 
Government bonds?fear that the US dollar will again decline sharply, 
a development that would erode the yen value of any bonds acquired 
now. In an effort to support the US dollar, however, the Japanese 
Finance Ministry is reportedly urging Japanese investors to 
participate actively in the auction. 25X1 
Comment: Japanese investors currently appear disinclined to 
purchase overseas assets of any type. After large net purchases of 
foreign assets in June and July, net acquisitions declined to near zero 
in August and September. To appease the powerful Finance Ministry,

TANZANIA: Reelection of Party Charman

another five-year term as its chairman, despite significant support 
within the party for the candidacy of President Mwinyi.ge.Geffilog-te 
the-448-E-mierascZ Nyerere reneged on his earlier promise to retire and 
engineered his reelection out of concern that the party would 
abandon socialism in favor of Mwinyi's Western-backed economic 
liberalization program. 
Comment: Nyerere's reelection probably will slow Mwinyi's moves to 
dismantle state economic controls and implement the economic 
recovery program sponsored by the International Monetary Fund. 
Mwinyi, who almost certainly is unhappy with Nyerere's decision to 
remain as chairman, may cautiously seek ways to circumvent the 
party, perhaps by increasing parliamentary responsibility. Although 
Mwinyi's liberalization policies are popular in Tanzania?they are 
widely credited with reversing the economic stagnation associated 
with Nyerere's socialism?the public probably will accept reelection 
of the Dartv chairman as long as the economy continues to improve.

2. "The format of discussions should be agreed upon in advance, and the decisions that 
might be reached through the mechanism should be binding upon all the participants." 
3. "The transitional arrangement must be as broadly based as possible.... No specific posts 
would be earmarked for any specific party, and no party would be ensured a predominant role 
in the transitional arrangement." 
4. "The main functions of the transitional arrangements, in addition to running the affairs of 
state, shall be: 
? To set in motion any constitutional or other internal processes... necessary to ensure 
continued peaceful conditions in Afghanistan. 
? To formulate a declaration of neutrality."

USSR- Playing for Time 
AFGHANISTAN-
PAKISTAN: Kabul's minimal reduction in its proposed timetable for a Soviet 
troop withdrawal at September's UN-mediated talks with 
Pakistan and moves by Afghan leader Najibullah to strengthen 
his position indicate that Moscow's primary concern at the 
moment is the stability of the Afghan regime. The Soviets' 
concurrent effort to persuade the UN or Pakistan to initiate talks 
on the composition of a future Afghan government is probably 
intended to minimize the damage to their diplomatic campaign. 
Such talks would also enable them to probe the terms of a 
possible face-saving arrangement should they decide later to 
accept less than a coalition dominated by their clients. 
Endemic feuding within the Afghan ruling party has been intensified 
by the opposition of some elements to Najib and his Soviet-mandated 
"national reconciliation" initiatives. The disarray may have prompted 
Moscow to back away from delivering on its hints that Kabul would 
propose a withdrawal timetable of about a year at Geneva. This may 
in turn have led to the Soviets' apparent decision to give Najibullah a 
free hand to deal with dissenters at the plenum and party conference 
last month and to allow him to assume the presidency?the  focus of 
power under the proposed new constitution. 
These moves, together with statements at the party conference that 
the party will remain preeminent in a coalition, are likely to damage 
Moscow's international promotion of the regime's flexibility and 
sincerity. This probably will complicate Soviet efforts to reduce 
support of the annual Afghan resolution in the UN General Assembly 
this month or to water it down by introducing amendments that 
include acknowledgment of the national reconciliation initiative. 
Moscow evidently determined, however, that the situation in Kabul 
warranted assuming this risk. It probably hopes that by buttressing 
Najibullah it will underline its determination to pursue the policy with 
which he is identified, while reassuring party members that their 
"leading role" will be preserved. 
, Shifting the Diplomatic Focus 
Since the letdown at Geneva, Moscow has attempted to turn the 
focus of negotiations from the withdrawal timetable to the structure of 
the future government, an issue that the Soviets had declined to 
address for most of this year. Now they are soliciting ideas on how a 
coalition might be constructed and angling to have Pakistan and the 
UN take the initiative in setting up talks between the Afghan 
resistance and the regime.

Moscow's Objectives 
The Soviets probably hope that their new tactic will buy time for the 
regime to get its internal house in order, while convincing the 
international audience that Moscow and Kabul remain committed to 
compromise. Moreover, they hope that pressure to reach a common 
negotiating position will aggravate divisions within the resistance and 
between the resistance and Pakistan. 
At the same time, Moscow may be trying to prompt Pakistan and the 
UN to begin a process in which it can probe?without committing 
itself?how far the other side might be ready to bend to provide the

Outlook 
Moscow has continued to insist that the regime cannot be shunted 
aside and that the resistance will have to negotiate with it. The 
Soviets' unleashing of Najibullah may be designed to shore up the 
regime in preparation for serious negotiations on a coalition 
government or to reduce the risk to its stability should the Soviets 
offer a 12-month timetable at Geneva. 
The USSR, however, is likely to maintain its current strategy, at least 
over the next few months, through the UN General Assembly vote, a 
"grand assembly" called by Kabul to adopt a new constitution, and, 
possibly, a visit to Islamabad by Vorontsov, a US-Soviet summit, and 
a US-Pakistani showdown over the nuclear proliferation controversy. 
By then, it may become clearer to the Soviets how well the regime in 
Kabul can withstand the inevitable strains that any  serious 
negotiations would bring.

The Communists' Urban Guerrilla Efforts 
The decision to establish a network of assassination squads in Manila, called armed city 
partisans or "sparrow" units by the Communists, apparently was made sometime in 1980, 
although they were not activated until 1985. There 
probably are 100 to 300 armed regulars?men and women?in Manila, although as few as 
50 may be designated to carry out assassinations, 
_ Ithe urban guerrillas are divided into three groups: regular partisan operation units 
I  
that target low-level individuals; special partisan operation units that probably target higher 
ranking figures; and the Alex Boncayao Brigade that is designated to "liquidate" leading 
public officials and military and police officers. 
Over the past two years the sparrow units have displayed a consistent operating procedure. 
During the attack, one member shoots the victim in the head and chest at close range with a 
handgun?usually on a busy street corner or in a car?while others provide cover.

PHILIPPINES: Communist Insurgents Targeting Manila 
25X1 
The Philippine Communist Party's New People's Army?NPA?
has killed more local officials, police, and military personnel in 
Manila this year?including 11 last week?than in any previous 
year; it aims to demoralize troops, force a diversion of military 
forces from the countryside, and weaken support for the Aquino 
administration. The Communist Party of the Philippines?CPP?
probably will refrain from more assassinations while it evaluates 
these operations to avoid too strong a popular backlash and for

fear that a larger, more active urban network would be 
susceptible to government penetration. Although junior officials, 
police, and military personnel will continue to be the primary 
victims, the CPP may also attack senior military officers, and

between the Aquino administration and the armed forces and to 
aggravate the tensions that  contributed to the coup attempt on

the CPP has for several years debated the feasibility and 
appropriateness of urban warfare in Manila. Details of the debate are 
limited, but opponents of urban warfare probably argued that the 
NPA's successes in the countryside could not be easily replicated in 
Manila. Ideologues probably asserted that, by moving the insurgency 
into Manila, the party would appear to be abandoning the countryside 
where, according to their Maoist doctrine, the revolution must be 
fought and won. 
Advocates of urban warfare probably contended that, although 
operations in the capital would be dangerous, the potential benefits 
could be great. some of the objectives of 
warfare in Mani a: 
? Demoralize g vernment forces accustomed to a safe 
environment. 
? Relieve pressure NPA rural units by forcing a diversion of 
government troops o the capital. 
?  Train supporters in Ma

ANGOLA: Implications of Government Reverses 
The Angolan Government's retreat from Mavinga signals the end 
of the seasonal offensive for this year. The regime is not 
immediately threatened by its reverses, but its hopes for a 
significant military success have been dashed, and it may now 
consider other options, short of political reconciliation with 
UNITA. UNITA now has the initiative and probably recognizes the 
need to expand the guerrilla war if it is to build on its success. 
government forces that had 
begun to push toward Mavinga in mid-August have retreated back 
toward their starting point at Cuito Cuanavale. UNITA, with 
substantial South African ground and air support, has pursued the 
withdrawing government forces, and not all government units are out 
of danger. South of Lucusse?the second front of the two-front 
offensive?government forces still hold positions captured in early 
August but are far short of their objectives at Cangamba and 
Lumbala N'guimbo. _ the 
_ 
government brigades are digging in, with no apparent intention to 
continue their advance soon. 
By any measure, the offensive has been a major setback for Luanda, 
which recruited, armed, trained, and planned for two years with the 
expectation of capturing and holding key positions in UNITA-held 
territory. Government leaders, were 
confident that the Army could seize Mavinga, an important step in the 
government's goal of conquering the UNITA-held southeast and 
ultimately capturing UNITA's headquarters at Jamba. 
Luanda and Its Sackers 
The government is trying to play down the magnitude of the failure, 
characterizing the fighting in press reports as a routine sweep 
operation that would have succeeded had Pretoria not intervened. 
President dos Santos is likely to deflect criticism of his role, but the 
defeat will spur new infighting  among the fractious leadership. 
the search for scapegoats has already 
begun, with most of the finger pointing aimed at the military. The 
Angolan Air and Air Defense Forces are being blamed for their failure 
to protect advancing troops from South African airstrikes or to 
provide adequate air support. Individual commanders are being 
criticized for poor execution of the battle plans. 
Luanda's Soviet and Cuban backers probably will come in for a share 
of the recriminations. The Cubans, who adhered to their backup role 
and took little part in the fighting, have been accused by Angolan

officers of not providing needed air support to the government forces, 
 The Soviets, who, 
 promoted the strategy of a large 
offensive and played a major role in planning and equipping the 
operation, also are likely to share blame for the setback. 
Moscow and Havana have condemned South Africa's involvement in 
the fighting, but neither is likely to see a need for drastic action. The 
regime in Luanda is not immediately threatened by military reverses 
in the isolated southeast, and there probably is little that Moscow and 
Havana can or would do  militarily in the near term to rectify the 
situation 
UNITA and Pretoria 
UNITA's ability, albeit with South African support, to frustrate two 
years of preparation by Luanda, inflict significant losses, and seize the 
initiative in the southeast is a major success for the insurgents. UNITA 
leader Savimbi's decision to pursue withdrawing government forces 
back to Cuito Cuanavale reflects his interest in building on a 
successful defense by turnina the withdra7al into a rout, 
South Africa's intervention with both air and ground forces played a 
key role in UNITA's success. By committing its forces, Pretoria not 
only demonstrated the extent to which it is willing to support Savimbi, 
but also showed that a South African-backed UNITA can block 
Luanda's aims even when the government forces are equipped by the 
Soviets and backed by Cuban garrison troops. Continued South 
African airstrikes on the retreating government forces indicate 
Pretoria backs Savimbi's bid for a larger victory. 
Outlook 
Although its defeat is not sufficiently threatening to push Luanda 
toward reconciliation with UNITA, Luanda may try to improve its 
military prospects by limiting Pretoria's ability to intervene in future 
fighting. The government may show more interest in pursuing a 
negotiated end to South Africa's occupation of Namibia by trading off 
a Cuban troop withdrawal. Luanda might also consider restricting its 
operations to regions in Angola sufficiently far from Namibia to make 
South African intervention more difficult and costly. 
Savimbi probably realizes that a battlefield victory in the southeast 
will not by itself force the government to pursue his goal of political 
reconciliation and power sharing. He has won some relief from 
government attack in the southeast for the next few months and is 
now likely to intensify his countrywide guerrilla operations, particularly 
in northern Angola where the government is most sensitive to military 
pressure.
