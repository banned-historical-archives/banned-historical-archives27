that might compromise agents or technical systems. Prevent-
ing such revelations was one of the main reasons McCone 
insisted that the United States not rely on intelligence as a 
substitute for comprehensive on-site inspections to verify 
Soviet compliance. In comments at meetings of the Com-
mittee of Principals during 1964, he addressed details of con-
ducting those inspections?including the wording of phrases 
pertaining to them in subsequent protocols. He wanted to 
avoid giving the Soviets more chances to violate the spirit of 
the treaty by taking advantage of ambiguous language in its  
letter. 
"Sttcw.?vi  
Confronting the Main Adversaries (I): The Soviet Union (U) 
President Kennedy put McCone on a committee that 
reviewed proposed American tests to ensure they conformed 
to the provisions of the treaty. He continued in that func-
tion after Lyndon Johnson became president. The other 
members were Rusk, McNamara, Seaborg, Foster, Maxwell 
Taylor, and Jerome Weisner, the White House science 
adviser. This responsibility drew on McCone's nuclear 
expertise and was not directly related to his role as DCI. For 
instance, in February 1964 he argued against conducting an 
underground excavation test under the PLOWSHARE pro-
gram because it might release radioactive debris in detect-
able quantities. By his reading, the treaty permitted only 
fully contained tests. McCone's interpretation of the agree-
ment was questionable, but President Johnson decided for 
political and diplomatic reasons to suspend the proposed 
explosion. As Bundy advised the president, "You don't want 
the Russians accusing you of breaking a treaty [in an elec-
tion year]." The AEC did not conduct the test until Decem-
ber." (U) 
A leadership change in Moscow in October 1964 dis-
rupted activity on arms control for a while. Until the politi-
cal situation in the Kremlin stabilized, McCone cautioned 
ACDA Director Foster, the United States should not raise 
the issue of nuclear disarmament. He believed the Soviet 
policy elite was so preoccupied with internal politics and 
relations with the Eastern European satellites that it could 
not discuss the issue meaningfully. On one occasion during 
this period, McCone uncharacteristically spoke theoretically 
about how disarmament would have a long-term beneficial 
effect on the Soviets. In comments reminiscent of Eisen-
hower's censure of the "military industrial complex," the 
DCI opined that if Soviet industry was redirected to make - 
consumer products instead of "the sterile goods of war," the 
Soviet people "would be more affluent, they would have 
more tact, they would move away from their sterile society 
and into a different type of society." He thought Washing-
ton and Moscow might even consider exchanging intelli-
gence on each other's capabilities as one of several steps 
toward ending the arms race. For the DCI, the problem was 
getting the superpowers to agree on the essential first step?
a verification system that really worked. 59) 
The largest Soviet underground test yet, on 15 January 
1965, fortified McCone's suspicions about Moscow's will-
ingness to observe the treaty's limits. Just a few days after the 
DCI told a congressional committee that through all of 
1964 the Soviets apparently had not violated or taken advan-
tage of loopholes in the treaty, 
I At a later meeting of the 
Committee of Principals, McCone "was particularly strong 
in his feeling that this was...a test ban violation," according 
to Seaborg, and evidently wanted the US government to say 
so explicitly in a press release. Instead, the administration 
took a more subdued approach, merely announcing that the 
detonation had occurred while quietly asking the Soviets for 
an explanation. When news of the test appeared before the 
official announcement, an irate President Johnson chastised 
McCone, Ball and McNamara for the unauthorized disclo-
sure, which he feared might derail further arms control 
efforts. Johnson, wrote Seaborg, was "direct and vociferous

in his complaints" to them "as the leaks had involved their 
departments" and "must be stopped." The administration 
concluded a few weeks later that the explosion was part of a 
PLOWSHARE  experiment 
McCone's initial reaction to the test was 
hasty and overdrawn, bespeaking his unmitigated distrust of 
Soviet intentions." X 
"No other accomplishment in the White House gave 
Kennedy greater satisfaction," presidential speechwriter 
Theodore Sorensen wrote soon after the test ban treaty was 
ratified. Averell Harriman concluded years later, however, 
that it had been a hollow achievement. "When you stop to 
think of what the advantages were to us of stopping all test-
ing in the early 1960s when we were still ahead of the Sovi-
ets[,] it's really appalling to realize what a missed 
opportunity we had." Yet while McCone was AEC chair-
man and DCI during the years the test ban was being dis-
cussed, he never advocated using a treaty to freeze the US 
nuclear advantage. One foreseeable consequence of the US 
government not having done so soon became a reality. The 
treaty forced testing underground, allowing the Soviets to 
develop, produce, and deploy even deadlier weapons. As 
noted earlier, they quickly seized the opportunity. The treaty 
also would have scant impact on the problem of prolifera-
tion, in the judgment of the Intelligence Community. "[IN 
India, Israel, Sweden or other technically competent nations 
show as much determination to develop such weapons as 
have France and China, the types of pressure which the 
USSR and the US have been willing to use to date against 
potential proliferators would probably not be successful," an 
October 1964 NIE stated. Meanwhile, the Johnson admin-
istration continued sending proposals for a comprehensive 
test ban treaty to negotiators in Geneva. The effort would 
not bear fruit until 1968, when the United States and the 
Soviet Union signed the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons.6)14 
Taunting the Bear: Anti-Soviet Covert Actions (U) 
During McCone's tenure, CIA's covert action operations 
against the Soviet Union were redirected outward, just as its 
espionage activities were, and for the same reasons.

Confonting the Main Adversaries (I): The Soviet Union (U) 
The Monolith Cracks (U) 
The split between the Soviet Union and the PRC was one 
of the salient factors in US policy toward those countries 
during the early 1960s.74 Moscow and Beijing's mutual hos-
tility had multiple causes rooted in history, ideology, and 
national interest. These sources included the two countries' 
longstanding rivalry over territory in central Asia, their con-
test for leadership of the international communist move-
ment, ideological differences over the nature of Marxism, 
personal antagonism between Khrushchev and Mao Zedong, 
and the resentment of Chinese rulers over what they 
regarded as inadequate Soviet aid, always begrudgingly given, 
and the Soviets' tepid support of the PRC in its dispute with 
the Republic of China on Taiwan. By 1963, after Moscow 
declined to help Beijing in its border dispute with India in 
1962 and compromised with Washington over the missiles 
in Cuba, the estrangement was public and complete. The 
two regimes had become, in Ambassador Charles Bohlen's 
paradigm, the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks of the com-
munist world!' While McCone was DCI, assessments by 
CIA and the Intelligence Community that the split was wide 
and enduring contributed to the Kennedy administration's 
decision to exploit it?to drive the communist powers fur-
ther apart by effecting a detente of sorts with the Soviet 
Union while isolating the PRC internationally as a dangerous 
revolutionary force. CIA?notwithstanding McCone's 
uncertainties about the severity of the split?helped execute 
the policy through various covert endeavors. (U) 
CIA analysts first began describing differences between 
the Soviet Union and the PRC in 1952. During the rest of 
the 1950s, the Agency's judgments about the split, although 
not uniform, went further than the rest of the community 
in concluding that Sino-Soviet solidarity was eroding?
especially after Stalin's death in 1953.76 Coordinated com-
munity assessments were more guarded. An NIE in 1954 set 
the general tone for the next several years: 
Communist China is more an ally than a satellite of 
the USSR. It possesses some capability for indepen-
dent action.. .We believe that despite potential sources 
of friction between the two powers arising from occa-
sional conflicts of national interests, the cohesive 
forces in the relationship will be far greater than the 
divisive forces throughout the period of this estimate 
[mid-1959]. 
Such judgments paralleled those of most policymakers 
downtown, who until around 1960 thought conclusions 
about a schism were, in former CIA analyst Harold Ford's 
words, "based heavily on tea-leaf interpretations of what 
Soviet and Chinese media were saying." Bilateral disputes 
were over tactics, not strategy, and would come and go as sit-
uations changed; animosity was highly personalized between 
Khrushchev and Mao, and thus transient; and fundamental 
agreement on the basic point continued?the West, and 
especially the United States, was the prime enemy who 
would be vanquished through socialist revolution!' (U) 
Events in 1960 and 1961?the Kremlin's sudden with-
drawal of advisers from the PRC, and Khrushchev's denun-
ciation of Mao and his foreign proxies?provided the 
definitive proof of grave discord that had been missing. As 
Sir Percy Cradock, a senior member of the US-UK Joint 
Intelligence Committee, has aptly written, "All this marked 
a new stage of the struggle: secret family quarrels, with indi-

CHAPTER 10 
rect abuse and the occasional sound of muffled blows, were 
succeeded by open disagreement and public polemics. The 
West now had something to bite on...... 
When this assortment of open source and secret informa-
tion was collated and examined, a new analytic line rose to 
dominance in the community during McCone's years as 
DCI: the competing interests of the communist powers 
overrode their ideological affinities and made their differ-
ences irreconcilable. "There is still one Communist faith," 
stated an estimate in August 1960, "but there are now two 
voices of Communist authority.... The Sino-Soviet relation-
ship is not a Communist monolith." ONE chief Sherman 
Kent wrote McCone in late 1961 that 
the Sino-Soviet conflict is at bottom a clash of 
national interests. While each professes devotion to 
Communist unity, each seeks to mobilize the entire 
world Communist movement in the service of its own 
aims.... Barring a radical change in Chinese outlook 
or leadership, we now believe that the chances of a full 
break in party relations between the two during the 
next year or so have increased very substantially. 
"S inn-Soviet relations are in a critical phase just short of an 
acknowledged and definitive split," an NIE in early 1962 
concluded. "There is no longer much chance of a funda-
mental resolution of differences." A year later, an NIE fore-
cast that "the Chinese will almost certainly continue.. .to 
expand their influence at Soviet expense.... A formal schism 
could occur at any time." In 1964, the sense of the commu-
nity was that Sino-Soviet relations might vacillate some-
what, but "the rift is so deep and the national interest of 
each party so heavily engaged that there is virtually no 
chance of reconciliation under the present leaders. The 
international movement may now be on the eve of a formal 
split." "Soviet leaders appear to have concluded that they 
will be locked in a severe struggle with China for a pro-
tracted period," went another estimate that year, "[and they 
will] pursue their own interests.. .despite the cost of...con-
sequent fracturing of the international movement.' (U) 
Assessments such as those ran contrary to the traditional 
thinking of some senior CIA officers?mainly longtime stu-
dents of communist theory and Soviet affairs in the DDP 
and the DI?and, at least for most of the time, of DCI 
McCone. Like most members of the US national security 
establishment, McCone had believed for many years that 
the Soviet Union and the PRC were steadfast allies. To 
McCone, the early evidence of a split was too sketchy, too 
inferential, too contrary to continued signs of cooperation. 
As AEC chairman, McCone told the NSC in 1960 that he 
"took the schism.. .with a grain of salt," noting how fer-
vently the Soviets supported China's application for UN 
membership and representation at meetings of the Interna-
tional Atomic Energy Agency." (U) 
As DCI, despite briefings such as the one from Kent 
quoted above, McCone maintained his skepticism. In 1963, 
he told the NSC that he did not think the "very great" dif-
ferences between the communist superpowers were "very 
deep" or that a "final break" would occur. Inside CIA, 
McCone urged Agency analysts not to become fixed to their 
latest judgments and to look at and weigh carefully all evi-
dence of either reconciliation or rupture. "[W]e must study 
the indicators with great care and great objectivity and not 
be influenced by a preconceived conclusion in this matter." 
Current assessments about a schism?for example, the DI's 
statement in July 1963 that "[w]e can.. .expect an acceler-
ated emergence of two competing and hostile Communist 
world centers, with accompanying disruption of world 
Communism"?must not become the new conventional 
wisdom. With the nation's vital interests at stake in several

Confronting the Main Adversaries (I): The Soviet Union (U) 
McCone saw some convincing reasons why both Mos-
cow and Beijing would set aside their differences-not the 
least of which was the struggle against their shared American 
enemy-and he questioned whether Khrushchev was acting 
as if a split really had occurred. In the premier's discussions 
with Harriman in Moscow during the test ban negotiations 
in July 1963, for example, McCone thought Khrushchev 
was telling the United States that the communist powers' 
dispute could be straightened out. The DCI noted that 
Khrushchev said he would still assist China and had not 
mentioned abrogating their mutual defense treaty. 
"Frankly," McCone told his senior analysts, 
I have been alarmed over what he said to Harriman, 
and I fail to give the very great optimistic, hopeful 
turn to the events of the last two weeks which are 
being carried around by some in Washington. Except 
for Mao's statement which seemed to draw the color 
line, yellow and black versus white, we don't seem to 
have very much to pin our hopes on, except for a lot 
of polemics."X 
One bit of controversial information that McCone and 
most Agency analysts considered but dismissed was the 
assertion of KGB defector Anatoliy Golitsyn that the Sino-
Soviet split was part of a massive disinformation plot-a 
"strategic deception"-orchestrated in Moscow. After coun-
terintelligence chief James Angleton told PFIAB in 1962 
about Golitsyn's idea, CIA officers had assured the board 
that there was no evidence for the defector's idiosyncratic 
assessment. Nonetheless, upon hearing from Golitsyn per-
sonally, McCone ordered a panel of Agency specialists on 
the Soviet Union and China to study the question again. 
His action did not indicate that he accepted the defector's 
theory. Rather, he seems to have regarded Golitsyn's inter-
pretation as additional intelligence that Agency estimators 
should factor into their judgment on the nature and extent 
of the rift. The panel of experts-dubbed the "Flat Earth 
Committee" by detractors of Golitsyn's "handler," Angle-
ton-concluded, in line with previous CIA assessments, 
that the defector's theory was unsupportable, and thereafter 
McCone did nothing else to lend credence to it. (The 
Golitsyn case and McCone's relations with Angleton are dis-
cussed in Chapter 13.)83 
At least in analytical terms, McCone maintained a "prove 
it" attitude about the split throughout his directorship. In 
1964, he told the NSC about new clandestine information 
that indicated the Sino-Soviet schism was deeper than the 
countries' public statements suggested. He further noted that 
the Soviets had deployed more troops along the Chinese bor-
der, and that allies of Beijing, such as North Korea, were cas-
tigating Moscow for "deviationism." In early 1965, however, 
he told a congressional oversight committee that Khrush-
chev's ouster in October 1964 eliminated a major irritant 
between the two countries. Moreover, he testified, "[C]ertain 
defense treaties [between Moscow and Beijing] are still in 
existence.. .they have not abrogated those, and.. .until some 
such move as that takes place[,] it is a little hard to take the 
position that the rupture is irreparable."" 
McCone's reservations about Sino-Soviet tensions did 
not lead him to order the reconsideration of community or 
Agency assessments, as he had in one instance with Viet-
nam, nor to temper CIAs covert activities to exploit the dif-

ferences between the communist powers. The Agency's 
operational initiatives supported an overall administration 
policy designed to fall somewhere between, in Dean Rusk's 
words, "tinkering...as though we were playing with toys" 
and "retreat[ing] behind the business that 'well, we ought 
not to [try to widen the rift] anyhow.? The Department of 
State directed all US missions to treat the Sino-Soviet con-
flict in ways that would highlight the "inconsistency [in] 
relations" between the two countries, "deny communists [a] 
monopoly in interpreting their problems," and "counter 
communist efforts [to] paper over [their] serious differences 
and therefore maintain [the] fiction of non-existent mono-
lithic unity." The long-range purpose of the administration's 
efforts was clear from President Kennedy's comment at a 
press conference in December 1962: "We would be far 
worse off?the world would be?if the Chinese dominated 
the Communist movement, because they believe in war as 
the means of bringing about the Communist world.... 
[W]e are better off with the Khrushchev view than we are 
with the Chinese Communist view, quite obviously." US 
policy, aided by CIA's operations and informed by its analy-
ses, preferred the Soviet Union over the PRC.' (U) 
On the analysis side, CIA's response to the communist rift 
showed the timeliness and responsiveness that characterized 
the DI's work under the direction of McCone and Cline. 
The latter was perhaps the most forceful advocate inside the 
Agency of the view that the Sino-Soviet split was deep and 
permanent. He effectively managed the DI's production on 
the issue so that it comprehensively addressed current devel-
opments, responded to customer requests, investigated high 
impact/low probability scenarios, and conducted retrospec-
tive reinterpretations of events in the communist world dur-
ing the past several years. Policy-relevant analyses included 
anticipating the regional impact of the schism, especially on 
Japan, and examining the probable response to US actions to 
promote pluralism in Bloc countries. DI research on or

of North Vietnam, did it make sense for the United States to 
further antagonize them by accentuating the schism, thus 
inducing them to step up their aid to Hanoi? If the North 
Vietnamese were Soviet proxies, would US rapprochement 
with Moscow drive Beijing to increase its support of the 
North as a way to irritate the Soviets? If the two communist 
powers were both helping Hanoi against their common cap-

remained deep enough to exploit through covert and other

the East against the West, or widen it by forcing the Soviets 
to choose between the tangible benefits of "peaceful coexist-
ence" with the United States and its revolutionary kinship 
with the Vietnamese communists? As the Johnson adminis-
tration wrestled with these questions, CIA's covert activities 
in exploiting Sino-Soviet tension made little headway in 
McCone's last year. 
Khrushchev's Ouster and Intelligence Failure (U) 
Tir-14 
Nikita Khrushchev (U) 
Soviet Premier Nikita 
Khrushchev fell from power 
on 15 October 1964 in what 
CIA called "a carefully 
planned and skillfully exe-
cuted palace coup" prompted 
by "a long accumulation of 
grievances and dissatisfaction 
with his leadership." His 
replacement by a "collective 
leadership" from the Polit-
buro caught the US govern-
ment off guard. The 
Intelligence Community had 
been aware of the problems besetting the Soviet leader and 
had noted "friction and jockeying" in the Kremlin inner cir-
cle. For example, assessments in mid-1963 noted that 
Khrushchev confronted an array of difficulties?a stagnant 
agricultural sector, a restless intelligentsia, a collection of res-
tive satellite countries beleaguered by worsening political and 
economic difficulties, Politburo discontent over his handling 
of the Cuban missile crisis and relations with Communist 
China?and that "his predominance [in the Soviet leader-
ship] has diminished somewhat." McCone himself told an 
official audience around the same time that domestic and 
foreign concerns were critical enough to restrain Soviet 
""Ltilkt+i 
Confronting the Main Adversaries (I): The Soviet Union (U) 
adventurism. The community, however, had not foreseen the 
emergence of a coalition of rivals strong enough to bring 
Khrushchev down. Its last forecast of the premier's durability, 
in early 1964, concluded that his "internal position is now 
probably stronger and his freedom of action apparently 
greater than a year ago."" 
McCone was embarrassed by this collection and analysis 
lapse on the most important international leadership issue of 
the time. The DCI himself learned about Khrushchev's 
removal in a telephone-call from Moscow either on the 15th 
or the 16th. "[W]hat appeared to have happened came as a 
complete surprise to me and to almost everybod else," he 
said in a confidential briefing. 
Wit out 
hare evi ence, t e an ysis cou s on y specu ate on the 
meaning of the Kremlin's "cryptic" announcement and posit 
"indications" that the ex-premier had not stepped down vol-
untarily. Subsequent assessments of Khrushchev's departure 
were full of conditionals and qualifiers ("appears to have," "if 
these were," "seemed," "best guess") that showed that the US 
government's Kremlinology was little more than ill-informed 
conjecture. This relative ignorance of internal Soviet politics 
showed glaringly in an unenlightening Agency analysis that 
the new Soviet leaders "would be either less troublesome or 
more dangerous to the West." In an apparent effort to put 
the best light on the intelligence failure, McCone publicly 
claimed a few weeks later that Khrushchev's opponents "did 
not themselves believe they had the strength to remove him 
until they had assembled" in Moscow on 14 October and 
were just as surprised as anyone else when their plot suc-
ceeded the next day." 1:1(

Khrushchev probably fell from power, McCone 
explained to the NSC two days after the fact, because of his 
erratic behavior and inconsistent public statements, his 
flawed leadership that contributed to the Sino-Soviet split 
and tensions with the Warsaw Pact countries, and his advo-
cacy of reallocating resources toward consumers and away 
from heavy industry and the military. The DCI had to con-
cede that CIA analysts knew little about the relationship 
between the two Soviets now running the Kremlin, Alexei 
Kosygin and Leonid Brezhnev, but he doubted that their 
power-sharing arrangement would last long and predicted 
that one of them, or possibly a third figure, would emerge as 
both premier and first party secretary?as Khrushchev had 
after Stalin died. McCone anticipated no sharp shifts in 
Soviet foreign policy in the near term and later told a Senate 
oversight committee that the leadership change seemed to 
be having the salutary effect of making Moscow suspend its 
subversion efforts in the Third World." X 
The sense of the Intelligence Community was the same. 
In estimates McCone approved during the first part of 
1965, the community forecast that Soviet actions abroad 
would follow the lines of the previous two years. A collective 
leadership, with its inherent power struggles, was more 
prone to policy fluctuations, but the new Soviet rulers were 
unlikely to seek confrontation with the West or, on the 
other hand, to make significant concessions to it. Risk aver-
sion, not adventurism, would be their watchwords." 
What To Do Next? (U) 
The inadequate information and tentative analyses about 
the Soviet leadership typified American intelligence on the 
Soviet Union during McCone's tenure. The community was 
getting better at strategic weapons assessments because of 
CORONA,\ 
/led to?at times?speculative analysis, 
making it harder for the Johnson administration to devise a 
well-founded Soviet policy. (U) 
The administration saw Khrushchev's ouster as an oppor-
tunity to move toward detente with the Soviet Union, but 
McCone did not believe a change was warranted. Speaking 
almost as a lone voice in the senior policymaking circle, he 
argued in late 1964 and early 1965 that with Brezhnev, 
Kosygin, and their comrades preoccupied with internal 
maneuvering and keeping control over the Bloc countries, 
new initiatives that might ensnare' the United States in 
unexpected problems or create openings for Soviet ripostes 
should be avoided. Because the US strategic and political 
position was so much stronger than the Soviets', the admin-
istration ought not to do anything?including back-channel 
feelers?that would help them inadvertently. McCone's col-
leagues criticized this view as "Eisenhowerish," however, and 
it went against the administration's belief that Moscow's pre-
dicament might make it more receptive to diplomatic over-
tures. Washington, according to this line of reasoning, 
would be shortsighted to let matters drift when so many 
issues of mutual interest?nuclear weapon,, Cuba, China, 
Third World conflicts?needed attention. 
2 
In the closing months of McCone's directorship, Viet-
nam intruded into the superpower relationship, causing seri-
ous estrangement. The two sides' actions reinforced one 
another. The new Soviet leaders reengaged their country in 
Indochina through diplomatic contacts and affirmations of 
support to local communists, and the Johnson administra-
tion escalated the war through bombing and troop deploy-
ments. The Soviet Union's moves did not surprise 
Washington. Even before the administration's military 
actions, the Intelligence Community had forecast that Mos-
cow?largely out of reluctance to surrender the field to 
Beijing?would become more active in the region. The 
Soviet government, however, was more willing to antagonize 
the United States (and the PRC) over Vietnam than Ameri-
can analysts had believed." (U)

By McCone's departure in April 1965, the brief period of 
"peaceful coexistence" was over. Throughout his dealings 
with Soviet affairs in the 1950s and 1960s, McCone 
doubted whether such a condition, by that name or any 
other, ever could have been established. After all, peaceful 
coexistence, as its architect Khrushchev had said, "is the 
form of struggle appropriate to the present epoch!' 
McCone was consistently realistic about the Soviet Union's 
long-range intention of winning that struggle against the 
West. He, CIA, and other members of the community, how-

largely from insufficient intelligence about the "main adver-

Soviet strategic intentions. Despite improvements in human

Confronting the Main Adversaries (II): The People's 
Republic of China (U) 
president Kennedy continued Eisenhower's "two Chi-
nas' policy for dealing with the People's Republic of 
China and the Republic of China.' The approach 
treated them as separate states, striking a balance between 
their interests and containment of the communist regime in 
Beijing through regional alliances, diplomatic pressure, and 
military assistance to the Nationalist government on Tai-
wan. For example, the Kennedy administration refused to 
support the designs of ROC President Chiang Kai-shek to 
return to the mainland through military invasion, while at 
the same time it worked to prevent PRC admission to the 
United Nations. Despite Chiang's insistence that deteriorat-
ing conditions inside China (such as a catastrophic famine 
in 1961) presented the best opportunity yet for military 
strikes or large-scale paramilitary operations, Kennedy 
abided by his statements during the 1960 campaign and 
would not condone such tactics. (He conveyed his position 
to the PRC through a back channel in Warsaw.) Nor would 
he go to war over what he regarded as insignificant pieces of 
real estate in the Taiwan Strait?the islands of Quemoy, 
Matsu, and the Pescadores, causes of recurrent tension since 
the 1950s. (U) 
On the ROC's side, the presiden sup-
ported small harassment operations a and, 
and in the case of UN membership, he went further than his 
predecessor in siding with the ROC by secretly pledging to 
use the US veto in the Security Council to prevent the 
PRC's entry. A good deal of the administration's sufferance 
of the Nationalists resulted from its fear of the powerful 
China Lobby and its allies in Congress. More broadly, 
Washington's hardline policy toward the PRC was but one 
aspect of the general posture of toughness it struck toward 
communists worldwide. (U) 
Kennedy generally regarded Mao Zedong's China as a 
greater threat to global peace than the Soviet Union?as an 
undisciplined revolutionary state committed to spreading its 
virulent brand of communism to the Third World, and

especially Southeast Asia. Mao, the president declared in 
August 1963, led a "Stalinist" government that "has called 
for.. .international war.. .to advance the final success of the 
Communist case." Beijing's actions had produced "a more 
dangerous situation than any we have faced since the end of 
the Second World War."' The danger grew more pro-
nounced as Beijing developed nuclear weapons and grew 
further estranged from Moscow; it might be tempted to 
assert its influence over the communist world by brandish-
ing its strategic weaponry. Yet, intelligence on the PRC's 
intentions and capabilities was sketchy, increasing the likeli-
hood that US policymakers, working without sufficient 
knowledge, might provoke a confrontation with grave inter-
national consequences. (U) 
The Unclear Intelligence Picture (U) 
For John McCone and CIA, this situation called for 
intensifying collection on military and political targets and 
devising covert actions to weaken Beijing's hold on the 
mainland and subvert its stature among developing nations 
and foreign communist movements. McCone?strongly 
anticommunist, politically connected to the China Lobby, 
and personally acquainted with Nationalist leaders?wanted 
the Kennedy administration to be firm with the PRC. Com-
menting on a Department of State policy paper in 1962, he 
wrote: "It seems a little bland.., to recommend only the very 
long term policy of avoiding provocation and hoping things 
will be better after Mao and his colleagues.. .die.... This 
strikes me as simply adopting an attitude of hopefulness 
rather than facing up to what may be much more pressing 
short term strategic convulsions in Asia thrust on us by the 
Chinese Communists."' Historically, however, US policy-
makers had perceived that of the two "main adversaries," 
Communist China posed the lesser threat. Moreover, the 
PRC, although designated a Priority National Intelligence 
Objective for several years, in reality had only recently 
emerged as a target distinct from the Sino-Soviet Bloc.)*(

"Stitsizz,  
Confionting the Main Adversaries (II): The People's Republic of China (U) 
Assessments (U) 
CIA analysis of the PRC during McCone's tenure 
remained the stepchild it had been in the 1950s. Since the 
middle of that decade, most assessments of China appeared 
in the context of Sino-Soviet relations, tensions over Tai-
wan, and possible renewed hostilities in Korea. The DI paid 
relatively little attention to internal Chinese affairs. Policy-
maker interest in the PRC as a discrete issue subsided fur-
ther around 1960 after the Soviet Union ended military aid 
and Mao's "Great Leap Forward" failed.3k 
Personnel allocations in the DI for PRC-related accounts 
during McCone's tenure are less clear than with the Soviet 
Bloc because many officers worked in components dealing 
with the Far East overall or in functional elements whose 
geographic responsibilities are not readily apparent from 
available sources or whose staff temporarily shifted assign-
ments to China affairs when needed. 
Lacking broad knowledge of political, economic, and 
military matters in the PRC, CIA and Intelligence Commu-
nity analysts produced assessments that, although logical 
and thoughtful, did not advance insights that gave more 
than episodic help to US policymakers. Early in McCone's 
tenure, the estimates' conclusions were substantially more 
moderate than the policies they were meant to inform. In 
mid-1962, for example, while the administration was raising 
fears of Chinese belligerence during another tempest in the 
Taiwan Strait, USIB published a forecast that "over the next 
few years Communist China will follow relatively conserva-
tive and rational policies of the kind recently instituted." 
Three years later, however, with more intelligence in hand, 
community analysts reached judgments that were more 
hardline: Beijing would move more forthrightly to eject 
Western influence from Asia and supersede Moscow as 
leader of the communist world. Chinese foreign policy "in 
some ways resembles an international guerrilla struggle, 
which attempts to wear down the enemy's strength by 
attacking the weak points"?a metaphor that, given what 
was occurring contemporaneously in South Vietnam, did 
not inspire confidence that US policy toward the PRC 
would succeed.15X 
Beijing's Nuclear Puzzle (U) 
As in previous years, US policymakers during McCone's 
directorship took the most interest in the PRC when its 
nuclear weapons program was an issue. The key intelligence 
question McCone and the community had to answer was: 
When will the Communist Chinese test their first nuclear 
device? The PRC's strategic weapons program began in 
1955 when Mao?amid a dispute with the United States 
and the ROC over some offshore islands?authorized a full-
scale development effort. Three years later, with major 
/As early as 
December 1960, CIA forecast that the PRC probably would 
detonate its first nuclear device  in 1963. In April 1962  
nalysts concluded that the 
first test most likely would occur in early 1964.16 
Intelligence and estimates on these subjects found a ready 
audience downtown. That was especially so by early 1963, 
when President Kennedy told his national security policy-
makers that he regarded PRC acquisition of nuclear weap-

ons as "probably the most serious problem facing the world 
today." "The President was of a mind," Bundy informed 
McCone, "that nuclear weapons in the hands of the Chinese 
Communists would so upset the world political scene it 
would be intolerable to the United States and the West." 
The PRC's stature in Asia would rise, as its neighbors looked 
to it as a model of economic development and as a regional 
power broker. As discussed in the previous chapter, 
Kennedy's concern that Mao's revolutionary regime would 
join the nuclear club was the impetus behind his drive for a 
test ban treaty throughout the year.17K 
McCone was determined to prevent an intelligence fail-
ure like that of 1949, when the timing of the Soviet Union's 
first atomic test caught the United States by surprise.' His 
service as chairman of the AEC prepared him for this issue; 
his familiarity with nuclear technology shows clearly in his 
writings and statements on the subject as DCI  
mcuone directed his deputies in 
January 1963 to undertake an all-out, all-source collection 
effort against the PRC. The Chinese nuclear threat, he 
noted, was "foremost in the minds of the highest authority 
and therefore should be treated accordingly by CIA.... 
There should be no hesitation on the part of CIA to recom-
mend any and all types of clandestine activities directed 
toward the securing of additional information" about 
Beijing's nuclear program. X 
The new intelligence gave community analysts more 
assurance that their earlier forecasts were accurate; in July 
they again predicted that the PRC's first nuclear test most 
likely would occur in early 1964 at the soonest but they 
conceded that it could happen before.

Confronting the Main Adversaries (II): The People's Republic of China (U) 
The First Test: Forecasts and Follow-Up (U) 
Imagery was the key source. Relying on satellite and 
aerial photography?the former benefiting from improved 
camera resolution and larger film supplies on each mis-
sion?community analysts by mid-1964 had identified five 
suspect installations and concluded that two of them, Pao 
tou and Lop Nor, were the most likely sites for the first test 
explosion. Lop Nor attracted special attention after 
CORONA photography showed construction of a tower 
that could hold a bomb. In July, McCone told President 
Johnson that the community could not foretell when the 
Chinese would detonate a nuclear device but that the pres-
ence of those installations in various stages of assembly and 
operation indicated that PRC scientists had overcome at 
least some of the problems caused by the Soviet cutoff of 
technical assistance in 1960. The president suggested that 
U-2 photography would give more precise information, but 
McCone and Rusk advised against such a mission on techni-
cal and diplomatic grounds. \ 
With intelligence gaps remaining on such a sensitive sub-
ject, community analysts were circumspect. A special esti-
mate issued in late August 1964, "The Chances of an 
Imminent Communist Chinese Nuclear Explosion," noted 
that while Lop Nor was being readied for a test, a shortage 
of plutonium suggested that one would not occur until after 
the end of the year. Some members of the community dis-
agreed with that judgment?the 15th anniversary of the 
founding of the PRC, 1 October 1964, had been suggested 
as a possible date?but no representative took a footnote. 
Two scientists who  advised CIA on strategic issues 
told McCone that Agency analy 
screwing up oy assuming the Chinese device had to use 
plutonium, not uranium, and thus would take longer to 
prepare. Perhaps, having heard that opinion, McCone was 
bolder in his forecasts when he met with Western European 
heads of government in September, saying the Chinese may 
conduct a test within 30 to 60 days. At this point, McCone 
changed his mind about sending a U-2 over Lop Nor, but 
Rusk and Bundy countered that the consequences of losing_ 
a plane were too great to justify the risk.  
With a Chinese test drawing nearer, McCone and other 
officials in the community advised the president that the US 
government could prevent the PRC from achieving a propa-
ganda victory and avoid being blamed for another intelli-
gence failure by announcing that the administration already 
knew a test would occur soon. Such a statement would, as 
one American diplomat said at the time, "reassure neighbor-
ing countries that the US was watching and aware." Johnson 
agreed, and Rusk told the press on 29 September that "for 
some time it has been known that the Communist Chinese 
were approaching the point where they might be able to det-
onate a first nuclear device." This announcement marked 
the first time that information derived so evidently from sat-
ellite imagery had been made public. Meanwhile, CIA

continued planting stories in Asian media designed to mini-
mize the psychological and political impact of a Chinese 
test, and the Department of State told US embassies in the 
region to prepare material for use in overt propaganda and  
official statements. 
At this key juncture, President Johnson and his national 
security advisers ruled out a preventive military or paramili-
tary strike." The president, who had not evinced the same 
anxiety over Chinese nuclear weapons as his predecessor, 
maintained his policy of avoiding confrontation with 
Beijing. His attitude to the PRC's nuclear threat was that, in 
his words, "different dangers require different policies and 
different actions" than toward the Soviet Union. Over the 
preceding several months a consensus had developed among 
administration policymakers that Beijing's acquisition of a 
nuclear capability would not change the status quo in East 
Asia enough to justify military action. Attacks on mainland 
strategic sites while the United States and the PRC were not 
fighting each other would be politically and militarily risky 
and might cause the Chinese to increase their support to 
North Vietnam. PRC reprisals against Taiwan also could 
not be ruled out. In any case, damaged facilities would be 
rebuilt, leaving the United States with a Hobson's choice of 
attacking again or acquiescing in embarrassment. (U) 
Accordingly, the administration judged that intensifying 
current policies and programs was the best way to contain 
the Communist Chinese threat. Those steps included con-
tinuing (but futile) efforts to enlist Moscow in diplomatic 
moves against Beijing. Some officials still considered mili-
tary and paramilitary options, including an overt, nonnu-
clear airstrike by the US or ROC air forces, covert ground 
attacks using American and Nationalist agents inside China, 
and sabotage operations by airdropped ROC commandos. 
The last scenario was deemed the most workable and 
received "serious analysis" at the time, according to a con-
temporary document, but did not go forward because it had 
several prominent flaws beyond the likely diplomatic fall-
out. Details about target facilities were not known for cer-
tain, the Soviet Union probably would not support the 
action, and the destruction of Chinese stocks of fissile mate-
rial would be only temporary. With the efficacy of attacks 
far from assured and with the election less than two months 
away, President Johnson?running on a "peace platform" 
against Republican hawk Barry Goldwater?was not about 
to order military action inside the PRC. McCone agreed 
that the timing for attacks was wrong just then but said the 
US government should not categorically rule out a preemp-
tive strike. (U) 
CORONA photographs of Lop Nor taken on 8 October 
removed any doubt that the first Chinese test would occur 
within days.' Beijing had grounded all aircraft near the site, 
removed workers and equipment from the com ound, con-
structed bunkers and instrument  platforms

impact was muted. As Ray Cline later 
said, the administration had "pretty 
well prepared the world for expecting 
this event [without] becoming unduly 
alarmed by it." The White House 
released a statement, composed well in 
advance, that minimized the accom-
plishment.X 
In retrospect, the community's main 
misjudgment was presuming that 
because the weapon would be pluto-
nium-based, the Chinese would not be 
able to test a bomb as soon as they did. 
Instead, by developing a uranium-
based device first, the Chinese were 
able to "join the atomic club" sooner 
than expected. (They did not explode a 
plutonium-based nuclear device until 
June 1967.) Moreover, Beijing's ability 
to develop fissile material on its own, 
rather than acquiring it from the Soviets, suggested that the 
proliferation problem was more serious than anticipated. 
Despite indications that a second test might occur soon 
after, the administration continued its display of calm confi-
dence.'

with the Chinese test coming right after Nikita Khrush-

Confronting the Main Adversaries (II): The People's Republic of China (U) 
Still an Enigma (U) 
As American involvement in Vietnam increased during the 
early Johnson presidency, policymakers put more pressure on 
CIA to improve its collection against the PRC. Following 
along lines McCone had laid out, USIB in mid-1965 reaf-
firmed the need for the Intelligence Community to develop a 
collection and analytical prowess against the PRC "commen-
surate with that against other highest priority targets." 
Progress was halting, however. Secretary of State Rusk spelled 
out the persistent problem in late 1965: "The difficult policy 
decisions and judgments we make concerning Peking are con-
tinually handicapped by insufficient information on its capa-
bilities, intentions, actions, and strategy." The turmoil of the 
Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s only made the Chinese 
target harder to work against, and collection efforts ended the 
decade in disarray. Despite efforts to fill the intelligence gap 
made during the tenures of McCone and his immediate suc-
cessors, China was "still an enigma" in 1970, the Agency 
reported to PFIAB. Real advances in collection and analysis 
had to await the PRC's emergence in the early 1970s from its 
self-imposed isolation.4><

"Et RC4/ 
McCone and the Secret Wars (I): Espionage and 
Covert Action (U) 
ajohn McCone's management of CIA's clandestine activ-
ities was conditioned on three facts. First, unsteeped in 
the argot and methodology of espionage and counter-
intelligence, he was more interested in analysis and 
technical collection than in secret operations. (One COS 
recalled that during McCone's introductory tour of stations 
and counterpart services in Europe in late 1961, the DCI 
asked him, "What, exactly, is a double agent?")' Second, 
nothing in McCone's background endeared him personally 
or professionally to careerists in the DDP. His years of fed-
eral service notwithstanding, he had not traveled in the same 
social circles as the elite Easterners and OSS veterans at the 
top of the operations hierarchy, and he was regarded as more 
of an "outsider" by the Clandestine Services than by other 
Agency components. (U) 
Third, after the Bay of Pigs, the Kennedy White House 
was determined to control covert actions far more closely than 
when Allen Dulles was DCI. The bureaucratic changes the 
administration instituted for overseeing covert actions left the 
DCI with a reduced role in them?a limitation McCone 
worked to surmount. The administration created a simpler 
NSC apparatus than its predecessor used and gave more 
authority to the Special Group to plan and review CA opera-
tions. The Special Group, in turn, set up two subgroups: the 
Special Group Augmented, which directed efforts to topple 
Fidel Castro, and the Special Group Counterinsurgency, 
which by late 1962 oversaw secret projects in nearly a dozen 
Southeast Asian and Latin American countries. Authority 
over covert action was concentrated in the hands of Robert 
Kennedy, McGeorge Bundy, and, through much of 1962, the 
president's military adviser, Maxwell Taylor. CINs indepen-
dence decreased further in 1963 when the White House 
directed it to seek approval for all covert actions costing more 
than on a "cost and risk" basis. Before then, station 
and ivision c iefs had approval authority except in sensitive 
cases, which they referred to the ADDP, the DDP, or the 
CHAPTER 
12 
DCI, who decided whether to raise a project with one of the 
Special Groups. (Espionage operations were exempt from this 
outside review and authorization).2 
McCone's lack of familiarity with clandestine operations 
and predilection for technology and analysis, along with the 
administration's close management of covert actions, meant 
that the new DCI's approach to managing the DDP would 
be more "hands off" than it would be with analysis and sci-
ence and technology. He had no interest in being and no 
brief to adopt Allen Dulles's role as the "Great White Case 
Officer." McCone's DDP, Richard Helms, characterized 
McCone generally as "a very good manager.. .a quick 
study...a man with a firm hand." In the realm of clandes-
tine activities, that meant the DCI delegated day-to-day 
responsibility to the respected and canny Helms, counting 
on his "chief operations officer's" experience in espionage 
and counterintelligence, keen political sense, and skepticism 
about covert action to restrain gung-ho operators, conspira-
torialists, and other overly zealous Cold Warriors. At the 
same time, McCone became well-versed in operational 
details when he needed to be, insisting that his deputies reg-
ularly inform him about large or politically sensitive 
projects. For example, he routinely met with Helms after the 
morning staff meeting for a private briefing on close-hold 
operations, and he expected the Watch Office to notify him 
of developments in clandestine operations. Thus prepared, 
he would intrude himself in those activities, formally or 
informally, to whatever extent he or the White House 
deemed necessary. 
3,1;8f 
Like most "manager-reformer/outsider" DCIs, McCone 
valued technical collection over traditional espionage, but 
unlike some later representatives of that type (such as James 
Schlesinger and Stansfield Turner), he did not denigrate 
HUMINT. Even though McCone spent much more of his 
time on overhead reconnaissance than field operations, he

recognized that "spies in the sky" had significant limitations 
and must be used in conjunction with the recruitment and 
exploitation of well-placed, reliable human sources. Just as the 
CORONA program was gaining momentum, he cautioned 
senior Agency managers not to become transfixed by that 
achievement. "While satellite photography represents the 
best, and probably the most dependablek] information avail-
able to us," he wrote to Helms, "we should be careful that we 
do not depend solely and exclusively on this source." The 
Soviets could deceive the satellites easily and inexpensively, 
McCone believed, so he urged the DDP to "exert every possi-
ble effort" to collect HUMINT on Soviet missile sites. In the 
aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis, in which aerial recon-
naissance had proved vital, the DCI warned the Intelligence 
Community against "drifting into a frame of mind that high-
level photography is all we need, that it will show everything 
that must be seen." Without balanced collection, intelligence 
services "run the risk of tnaking a serious error."' 
Despite the Bay of Pigs fiasco, McCone neither chose nor 
was required by the White House to restructure or downsize 
the olitically weakened DDP.

counterinsurgency operations in the Third World, where it 
had the greatest interest in containing communist influence,

McCone instituted or endorsed readjustments in the 
ways DDP staffs and area divisions did business. The 
changes were intended to impose greater policy oversight, 
administrative rationality, operational effectiveness, and cost 
consciousness 
As chairman of USIB, McCone knew what requirements 
had been levied on CIA stations, and, as DCI, he could fol-
low how collectors acted on them inside the Agency. When 
apprised of situations that hampered the DDP's ability to 
fulfill the community's needs, he sought remedies. In some 
cases, the stations used clandestine assets to acquire informa-
tion that could be obtained overtly. McCone urged staff-
and division-level managers to screen requirements more 
carefully in order to allow case officers to make the best use 
of their assets. The DCI also worked with his counterpart at 
DIA, Gen. Joseph Carroll, in finding ways to limit bureau-
cratic conflicts and duplication of collection by DDP and 
military intelligence components.

To enable CIA to conduct more effectively the paramili-
tary operations the White House wanted, McCone ratified 
establishment of the Special Operations Division (SOD) in 
July 1962. An internal survey conducted at the time 
McCone became DCI identified deficiencies in personnel, 
logistics, research and development, and management of the 
Agency's paramilitary programs and capabilities. One of the 
study's findings was that activities were so complex, exten-
sive, and expensive that they needed to be centralized. 
Accordingly, SOD was created through a merger of th 
Df the former Development Projects ivi-
sion and the SOD 
became a self-contained unit that planned and ran lanc., sea, 
and air operations. It also proved more effective at getting 
the area divisions to use their expertise than had been the 
case under the previous arrangement, largely because it now 
had its own resources.8.1*<

following up on an recommendation that 
greater control be exercised over them, McCone in February

tive Committee for Air Proprietary Operations (ExCom-
Air), chaired by the general counsel. Eventually the DCI 
himself would review all major new projects and capital 
expenditures for the air proprietaries.9X 
  By 
then, McCone?who appreciated ork on science, 
technology, and nuclear issues?was persuaded that it 
would be most effective as a collection unit for the DI rather 
than as a support unit for the DDP. Friction between

With one politic

gandists will always allege that the Peace Corps is used for

from the Soviet Union (HTLINGUAL),13 and testing LSD 
and other mind-altering drugs on unwitting American sub-
jects (MKULTRA)." According to the Church Committee 
in 1976, no Agency documents show that McCone knew of 
the mail opening program, and McCone's testimony to that 
effect was consistent with the statements of James Angleton 
of the CI Staff and Howard Osborn, former head of the 
Soviet division and the Office of Security. McCone and 
Executive Assistant Elder have said the reasons he did not 
know CI Staff was reading American and Soviet mail were 
that HTLINGUAL was a small operation in place since

In early 1952, CIA-with the concurrence of the US Post Office-began scanning the exteriors of letters sent from the United States to the Soviet Union. During 
the first three years of the operation, Agency security officers occasionally opened some letters without Post Office knowledge. In late 1955, James Angleton, head of 
the CI Staff, took over the program and proposed that CIA review all mail to and from the Soviet Union that went through, New York and open about two percent 
of the letters (approximately 400) monthly. Richard Helms, then the Chief of Operations in the DDP, approved this phase of the program, which began in early 
1956. HTLINGUAL was terminated in 1973. For brief periods, US mail to and from Cuba and Communist China was examined under similar programs. US Sen-

drugs in the late 1940s. The project, called BLUEBIRD, initially worked on developing countermeasures to interrogation techniques using drugs. In 1951, a larger 
project named ARTICHOKE looked into the operational use of unconventional interrogation methods, including drugs and hypnosis. Reports that the Chinese 
had "brainwashed" prisoners during the Korean War gave further urgency to these inquiries. From 1953 on, the Agency's efforts were combined with similar under-
takings by the US military, as well as research on behavior modification and poisons, into an umbrella program managed by the DDP's Technical Services Staff (later, 
the Technical Services Division). Rockefeller Commission Report, 226-28; "Behavioral Drugs and Testing," CIA memorandum prepared for Rockefeller Commission,

McCone and the Secret Wars (I): Espionage and Covert Action (U) 
1952, was never presented to the DCI for renewal, was not a 
line item in the Agency budget, and did not produce any-
thing worth bringing to McCone's attention. Richard 
Helms, on the other hand, has said that HTLINGUAL "was 
well known to John McCone, even though he denies ever 
having known about it." McCone's careful attention to 
CIA's role in the investigation of Kennedy's assassination 
supports Helms's assertion. Some of the information the 
Agency developed on President Kennedy's assassin, Lee Har-
vey Oswald, came from examinations of his mail under 
HTLINGUAL, and it seems implausible that the DCI 
would not have been told, even in passing, about the pro-
gram after the assassination (see Chapter 14). Furthermore, 
DDCI Carter was told in February 1965 that congressional 
inquiries into mail surveillance might touch on HTLIN-
GUAL, and it seems unlikely that he would not have fore-
warned the DCI about the details of such a potentially 
damaging controversy. The preponderance of evidence indi-
cates, therefore, that McCone most likely was aware of at 
least part of the program?the mail examinations if not the 
openings?possibly by late 1963 or early 1964.15>e 
Similarly, recollections differ about the surreptitious drug 
tests.' The evidence indicates that McCone not only knew 
about them but disapproved of them sufficiently to order 
their suspension. According to the Church Committee 
report, McCone did not learn all the details of MKULTRA 
until Helms?possibly in anticipation of a critical IG report 
on the program?informed him in mid-1963. According to 
Helms, McCone raised no objection to unwitting testing at 
the time. McCone testified to the Church Committee, how-
ever, that no one had told him about the project in a way 
that "would have turned on all the lights." 1:Scr 
Some confusion might have arisen in McCone's mind 
over the nature and scope of the MKULTRA program. 
MKULTRA technically was only an accounting device used 
to designate a broad range of investigations into human psy-
chology and behavior managed by DDP's Technical Services 
Division under Dr. Sidney Gottlieb. Work with pharmaco-
logical and biological agents was only part of the program, 
and most of the money was 
spent on prosaic and largely 
ethical psychological tests, 
literature surveys, and 
chemical analyses (most of 
which took place in Ameri-
can universities and 
research institutions with-
out CIA's sponsorship 
made known). The most 
troubling aspect of MKUL-
TRA was the administra-
tion of psychotropic drugs 
to unwitting subjects in 
what were called "normal 
Sidney Gottlieb (U) 
life settings"?which included hospitals, prisons, and safe-
houses 
I nese tests, aitnougn rew in number and relatively inexpen-
sive, represented a key facet of MKULTRA. Any formal 
briefing given McCone on the overall project presumably 
would have explained the program's very broad, and mostly 
benign, scope and glossed over the details of the secret 
experiments. N? 
After the IG in 1963 recommended closing the safehouses 
in San Francisco and New York, McCone suspended testing 
on unwitting subjects but put off a final decision on the pro-
gram as a whole. During the next year, Helms recommended 
to Carter (as acting DCI) that blind testing be resumed. 
Helms warned that "an apparent Soviet aggressiveness in the 
field of covertly administered chemicals" was "inexplicable 
and disturbing" but that the Agency's "positive operational 
capability to use drugs is diminishing, owing to a lack of real-
istic testing." The experiments, Helms believed, could not be 
validated without unwitting subjects. He also worried that 
"decreasing knowledge of the state of the art.., results in a 
waning capability on our part to restrain others in the intelli-
gence community (such as the Department of Defense) from

morale and loyalty of the closed Clandestine Services com-

in the Agency. I had made 26 assault landings in the South Pacific, Southwest Pacific and so on?and of about the same size, many of them, as the Bay of

Frank Wisner (U) 
and senior officers, McCone temporarily took Wisner on as 
a special assistant, after which he would resign and become a 
consultant to the DCI and DDP on operations. McCone 
and his deputies placed few demands on Wisner. After Wis-
ner left the Agency in August 1962, he wrote some reports 
on intelligence and political topics, working out of an office 
in the old East Building. He spent most of his time running 
his farm, managing his investments, collecting Greek arti-
facts, and reviewing books on espionage. In March 1965, he 
sent a letter to McCone conveying his distress that NBC 
Television was planning to run a documentary on CIA that 
contained "inaccuracies, distortions, and...ugly myths, 
many of which are of demonstrably communist origin." 
McCone politely agreed with Wisner, but he had already 
done his share of complaining to magazine publishers and 
network producers. McCone did not see Wisner again. In 
October 1965, Wisner had another breakdown and killed 
himself.' 
Liaison Activities (U) 
Lastly, McCone fulfilled his duties as the US govern-
ment's top-ranking intelligence "diplomat" through dozens 
of meetings with high-level foreign leaders and liaison repre-
sentatives overseas and at Headquarters. He took 10 busi-
ness trips outside the United States during his tenure?five 
to Western Europe, three to Southeast Asia, and two to 
Latin America?and he held policy and intelligence discus-
sions with heads of government, cabinet ministers, service 
chiefs, and military commanders. On these trips, McCone 
was highly conscious of status and protocol, preferring to 
deal only with officials of commensurate rank and to discuss 
only the most important bilateral intelligence topics. 
According to Helms, who accompanied the DCI several 
times, McCone was so accustomed to dealing with the top 
level of leaders in the United States and foreign countries 
that he did not seem to think meeting relatively junior for-
eign officers for operational discussions was time well spent, 
despite the benefits to the liaison relationship. He did not 
want trips to include successions of courtesy calls and a 
social whirl of parties and sightseeing. Instead, he insisted 
they deal with official matters of substance, and be sched-
uled for maximum efficiency and thoroughly documented. 
As a gesture of appreciation to helpful foreigners, McCone 
instituted a practice he had followed in the private sector of 
sending birthday greetings to people overseas who worked 
closely with the Agency. He enjoyed at least cordial relations 
with the major Western and Asian services, except for 
France's. Relations with the French had been poisoned by a 
KGB defector's charges that the Soviets had riddled the 
French government with agents (see Chapter 13).21X

Covert Action and Intelligence Policy (U) 
Befitting his roles as intelligence director and presidential 
adviser, McCone deeply involved himself in numerous high-
profile covert action programs that were important elements 
of the Kennedy administration's national security policy.' 
The administration regarded covert political operations as 
essential weapons in the struggle against the Soviet Union 
and the PRC for influence in the Third World. That predis-
position, combined with longstanding bipartisan support 
for such activities and Allen Dulles's active patronage of 
them, meant that McCone did not need to "sell" the 
Agency's CA capabilities to the nation's new policymakers.  
McCone, along with the chairman of the JCS, the dep-
uty secretary of defense, the under secretary of state for 
political affairs, and the president's national security adviser, 
was a member of the NSC's Special Group (renamed the 
303 Committee in 1964), which usually met twice monthly 
to review and authorize covert action proposals.' The Spe-
cial Group was, as Richard Helms later described it, "the 
mechanism that was set up... to use as a circuit breaker so 
that these things did not explode in the president's face and 
that he was not held responsible for them." During the 
Kennedy administration, the S ecial Grou 
reconfirmed 
? a...rove or

(or, in McCone's absence, the DDCI's) before they were 
submitted for Special Group consideration. The DCI met 
weekly with Carter, Elder, Helms, CA Staff chief Cord 
Meyer, and appropriate DDP division representatives to 
review the plans.24 McCone required proposals to include a 
budget statement indicating if the funds were available in 
the area division or the directorate, or if some adjustment of 
accounts or further congressional authorization were neces-
sary. In mid-1962, the DCI assurecIPFIAB that, in a not-so-
subtle contrast with his predecessor's sometimes haphazard 
approach, "all covert action programs are now handled in an 
orderly, correct manner.".X, 
McCone did not, however, descend to the field-level 
management in which Dulles reveled. Instead, he remained 
at the policymaking stratum, helping formulate the goals 
and outlines of the larger or more potentially problematic 
covert actions and monitoring their execution. He left their 
implementation to his expert deputies, Helms and Meyer. 
Over the course of his directorship, McCone tended increas-
ingly to submit only large CA proposals and sensitive elec-
tion operations for Special Group review. Otherwise, he let 
the DDP operate under prior directives when its responsi-
bility and authority were clear. (Those lower-profile projects 
were vetted with the local ambassador or with Department 
of State leadership.) In late 1963, however, McCone 
directed the DDCI to undertake what would now be called 
a "zero-base" review of all CA projects-then numbering

his roles in formulating foreign policy, contacting the busi-

Latin America (U) 
"Latin America required our best efforts and attention" 
because it was "the most dangerous area in the world," Pres-
ident Kennedy said in 1963. Most foreign policy problems 
"paled in comparison with the prospect of the establishment 
of a Communist regime" in the Western Hemisphere. In the 
decade preceding the Kennedy presidency, 13 Latin coun-
tries had undergone violent or extra-constitutional changes 
of government. The new administration-fearing that the 
impoverished and oppressed masses of the region would 
embrace leftist panaceas-undertook a two-track approach 
to encourage economic development and social reform. 
Overtly, a Marshall Plan-style initiative called the Alliance 
for Progress provided billions of dollars in foreign aid and 
technical expertise, and the US military ran training and 
assistance programs for local armed forces and security ser-
vices. 
Helms told his statt in early 1962 that it is imperative to 
realize the extent to which WH [Division] is the 'wave of 
the future" for the Agency."Jel 
McCone underscored the point with three direct actions.

country became the showcase for the Kennedy and Johnson

McCone and the Secret Wars (I): Espionage and Covert Action (U) 
Some senior officials in the new Kennedy administration, 
particularly in the Department of State and the Bureau of 
the Budget, worried that a "cultural U-2 incident" might 
result from the "real hazard" of the increasingly thin cover of 
the funding network and that important foundations might 
be embarrassed by disclosure of their CIA ties. These early 
worries produced no action, however, owing to indifference 
at the top. The president and the attorney general appar-
ently saw no need to reform the funding of the Agency's CA 
programs and did not ask then-DCI Allen Dulles to reply 
substantively to questions about the funding network that 
Dean Rusk had posed in early 1961. Following the White 
House's lead, the Special Group declined to impose serious 
changes on individual CA projects or the scope and empha-
ses of covert action as a whole during an NSC audit in 
August 1961. Accordingly, when McCone took over as 
DCI, "higher authority" had not flagged the covert subsidy 
situation as a serious problem he needed to address." 
During the next two years, Agency officers jousted over 
the issue but did not seek resolution at a level high enough 
to engage the DCI even indirectly." OGC, Cover and 
Commercial Staff, and the now reorganized CA Staff 
exchanged many interoffice communications?the lawyers 
warning of the danger that official and journalistic probes of 
American tax-exempt foundations posed to the Agency's 
covert funding network, the operators giving assurances that 
they had quietly handled similar problems before and trying 
to keep OGC out of the day-to-day running of the network. 
These discussions replicated what had occurred among 
administration officials: vague high-level concerns eliciting 
from program managers a combination of nonchalance, 
bureaucratic defensiveness, and partial solutions to narrowly 
construed difficulties. 
Compartmentation limited the extent to which Meyer's 
CA Staff could implement the mandate it received from the 
new DDP, Richard Helms, to impose tighter controls on the 
sprawling network. In mid-1962, Helms had ordered the 
new CA Staff to create 2 
to survey all covert actions, 
amass central data 
files on 
projects, and recommend improvements to both operations 
and overall procedures. Despite this effort, neitheiior 
would comprehend how vul-
nerable the Agency was until too late. Making the situation 
worse was Meyer's failure to indicate to the DDP or DCI, 
even as late as early 1964, that something was amiss. Despite 
compartmentation, Meyer knew about security problems 
from OGC, and he met with McCone regularly about other 
CA projects. He chose, however, to handle the issue from 
his limited vantage point, without informing the DCI and 
top Agency management. Even when McCone dealt with 
CA funding matters in the  cases of 
he did so in response to specific 
developments and not because he was aware of a larger secu-
rity problem.>< 
Accordingly, McCone was incensed when he first heard 
about the covert funding dilemma on 31 August 1964, 
when Rep. Patman in open session of Congress identified a 
cut-out and seven other funding facilities (the so-called 
"Patman Eight") the Agency used in some CA projects. Pat-
man, who had started investigating one of CIA's foundation 
cut-outs earlier in the month, had grown dissatisfied with 
the Agency's lackadaisical responses to earlier, private 
requests for confidential information. Acting DCI Carter 
(McCone was on vacation) and senior IRS officials tried to 
placate Patman, who thought he had been "trifled with," 
and convinced him not to reveal anything else about the 
operations. The media already had the main story, however, 
and McCone first heard about the flap in news reports. At 
his staff meeting on 1 September, he vented his anger over 
Patman's revelation and the failure of operations managers 
to alert him and other senior officers about a controversy 
that had been building for three weeks. Without naming

names, he declared that "it was inexcusable that a matter 
this sensitive and which has absorbed the staff since 10 
August, was not brought to the attention of higher levels in 
the Agency until it was too late and the damage had been 
done." In McCone's mind, his deputies had violated the 
implied executive contract he made with them: In exchange 
for receiving substantial administrative independence, they 
must keep him fully informed of their activities and warn 
him of potential problems. The scenario must have seemed 
to McCone like a small-scale repeat of the Cuban missile 
crisis, when he had also returned from a holiday to find a 
huge mess, which his subordinates, in his judgment, had 
mishandled.") 
Early that afternoon, McCone personally had to explain 
the debacle to President Johnson, by then already disgrun-
tled with the DCI and the Agency over Vietnam (see Chap-
ter 15). McCone seems to have tried to shift the blame to 
Patman by stressing the "great damage" that the publicity 
would produce, rather than to admit that CIA's missteps 
had caused the difficulty in the first place. When the presi-
dent asked him what the Agency intended to do, he could 
only reply rather feebly that "there was little we could do 
except keep quiet" and find other ways to fund the Agency's 
covert action clients.' As a hard-driving manager accus-
tomed to working with plans and projections, McCone 
must have had difficulty admitting to his superior that the 
organization he had been picked to run effectively had failed 
at a basic executive responsibility: developing alternatives for 
administering sensitive programs when they ran into trou-
ble.V 
McCone immediately put Agency officials to work repair-
ing the damage." DDCI Carter unsuccessfully approached 
the editor of the Washington Post about delaying an editorial 
criticizing the Agency's use of foundations. Cover Staff 
stopped using the "Patman Eight" foundations, and Patman 
was persuaded to rein in an aggressive committee consultant 
who wanted to investigate all of them. CIA:s Legislative 
Counsel got permission to review and edit the transcripts of 
the Patman committee's open hearings. McCone told Meyer 
to prepare a comprehensive study of the CA funding process. 
The review concluded that sudden shifts in payment mecha-
nisms would cause more problems than they would solve but 
that minor adjustments should be explored. Meyer also 
chaired a high-level internal study group that proposed use-
ful procedural fixes but still operated under the tacit premise 
that future embarrassing leaks, while inevitable, would 
emerge slowly and sporadically and could be controlled. 
According to Elder, when McCone told the CA Staff to find 
another way to finance some of its activities, the officers 
"saluted loyally... [and] probably gave it an honest try[] but 
they simply couldn't find another way to do this." 
This disposition against a major overhaul became the 
consensus within the Agency and the administration. 
McCone did not reject out of hand Rusk's suggestion in 
September 1964 that the Agency could handle many so-
called covert actions through overt sources such as AID, but 
other administration principals were inclined to leave well 
enough alone. After hearing Meyer present his postmortem 
in late October, some members of the 303 Committee 
expressed vague unease with CIA's use of foundations for 
cover, but overall the policymakers agreed that the Agency 
had no other choice. With minor modifications in train and 
the Patman investigation under control, the furor over fund-
ing subsided during McCone's remaining months as DCI.

with Vietnam and other issues and was planning to leave 
Langley anyway. When he resigned, an attitude of quies-
cence prevailed as the threat of a massive security breach in 
the subsidy system seemed less likely. Reality would strike 
hard two years later when Ramparts published its expos?ot 
McCone as Operations Overseer (U) 
Most critics of the Intelligence Community, during 
McCone's directorship and today, do not question the need 
for the United States to conduct espionage against foreign 
adversaries. The usual complaint is that CIA and its coun-
terparts do not collect enough foreign secrets?that they do 
not deploy enough clandestine agents against the right tar-
gets and rely excessively on technical collection. Except 
when intelligence assets are compromised and diplomatic 
embarrassment results, controversies over HUMINT opera-
tions generally are confined to the community and deal 
mostly with competition for resources and debates over the 
proper mix of spies and satellites. McCone took part in his 
share of such discussions, but he left clandestine collection 
mainly to DDP veterans he believed he could trust. Given 
his unfamiliarity with field tradecraft, he was wise to do so, 
and for the most part, his deputies rewarded his confidence. 
(U) 
Then, as now, covert action was the more problematic 
activity for the DCI because it crossed the boundary between 
intelligence activity and foreign policy implementation. Even 
some experienced intelligence practitioners question whether 
CA should be the responsibility of an agency whose primary 
missions are collection and analysis. Involving CIA in politi-
cal action and paramilitary activities, the argument goes, gives 
the Agency a stake in policies that inhibits its ability to inform 
decisionmakers objectively. For McCone, inclined as he was 
to serve simultaneously as the president's chief intelligence 
officer and as a foreign policy formulator, that conflict of pur-
pose did not arise. He took seriously his responsibilities as a 
member of the Special Group/303 Committee, for, also then 
as now, covert action stood to get CIA?and the DCI?in 
more difficulty than any other intelligence activity. With the 
notable exception of the 1964 funding flap, and to the extent 
that he could influence developments in the CA area, 
McCone continued the programs he assumed from Allen 
Dulles, implemented new ones suggested by the Kennedy and 
Johnson administrations, and kept the Agency, and himself, 
out of trouble.

McCone and the Secret Wars (II): 
Counterintelligence and Security (U) 
J
ohn McCone had more experience in counterintelli-
gence and security when he became DCI than in espi-
onage and covert action. He had overseen the security 
practices of his shipyards during World War II, and as 
chairman of the AEC, he was entrusted with protecting 
some of the country's most sensitive secrets and was familiar 
with the investigations of Soviet atom spies. This firsthand 
background with intelligence attacks made McCone very 
security conscious and, amid the many counterintelligence 
events of the early 1960s, willing to give the Agency's coun-
terintelligence professionals?especially CI Staff chief James 
Angleton?a large measure of latitude. McCone respected 
Angleton's intellect and admired his tenacity, but he did not 
have a close working relationship with the reclusive and sus-
picious spy hunter. They met alone only about a dozen 
times and around 30 times in total during McCone's 41 
months at Langley. They apparently never lunched together 
at Headquarters. Angleton found other ways to engage the 
DCI more informally?occasionally dropping by McCone's 
Northwest Washington residence in the early evening.NL 
Some journalists have por-
trayed McCone as beguiled by 
Angleton, who supposedly 
took advantage of the DCI's 
innocence of the secret world 
to spin captivating theories 
and pursue shadowy projects. 
Given McCone's personality 
and management style, how-
ever, he hardly was susceptible 
to manipulation or willing to 
tolerate Angleton's supposed 
"no knock" privilege. Rather, 
the DCI kept himself informed

involved himself in, important counterintelligence develop-
ments?such as high-level Soviet defections, suspected pen-
etrations of the Intelligence Community, and sensitive 
liaison relationships. Otherwise, he let Angleton, who 
reported to Richard Helms, run counterintelligence largely 
as the two saw fit. In the area of community security, in con-
trast, McCone was much more engaged. He responded 
quickly to compromises and instituted procedures to reduce 
the likelihood of breaches. Like DCIs before and since, 
however, he could not stop enterprising journalists from 
gaining access to classified material.N 
Penetrations and Deceptions (U) 
The extent to which McCone allowed Angleton to shape 
his perception of counterintelligence affairs was most evi-
dent in the case of Anatoliy Golitsyn?a middle-ranking 
KGB officer who defected to the United States in December 
1961. After initially providing a trove of useful intelligence, 
Golitsyn made sensational allegations about Soviet "moles" 
and deception and caused years of disarray in several West-
ern services. Golitsyn was the first KGB staff officer to 
defect to the West since 1954. According to Walter Elder, 
"Angleton represented [Golitsyn] to McCone as being quite 
special, and McCone was intensely curious."' At the time he 
came to the West, Golitsyn claimed his information was too 
important to tell to any American except the president, the 
attorney general, and the DCI. Golitsyn's CIA handlers put 
him off for awhile, but?not assuaged after two meetings 
with Robert Kennedy and playing on the Agency's fear that 
he might "go on strike"?he wangled an interview with 
McCone in July 1962. Golitsyn set the tone for their rela-
tionship in his third sentence by complaining that "I had 
expected that our meeting would take place earlier." The

DCI tried to mollify Golitsyn by stressing the importance of 
his information, soliciting his views on Soviet internal affairs 
and foreign policy, and assuring him that "[Nide do not want 
to do anything at all, and will not do anything at all, that 
will be embarrassing to you or restrictive to you." (McCone 
noted elsewhere around this time that Golitsyn was "tem-
peramental and difficult to handle and at times resentful of 
our tactics.") At this first encounter, the defector proposed 
organizing anti-Soviet counterintelligence and counterpro-
paganda initiatives with other Western services. McCone 
was receptive and directed Helms and the CI Staff to work 
with Golitsyn on developing his project.'. 
McCone met with Golitsyn 10 more times--on several 
occasions alone?during the next 27 months and arranged 
for Golitsyn to see Robert Kennedy again because, Elder 
recalled, "[he] was acting like a prima donna and his ego 
needed soothing." The former KGB officer used some of 
these meetings to describe Moscow's purported strategic 
deception program?which included dispatching false defec-
tors to discredit him?and to solicit McCone's support for a 
$15 million organization to study the Soviet regime and the 
KGB. During a luncheon in the DCI's private dining room 
in mid-December 1962, McCone heard Golitsyn expound 
his theories that Khrushchev's de-Stalinization policy was a 
myth, that the Soviet Union's purported "splits" with the 
PRC and Yugoslavia were actually deception operations, and 
that the Cuban missile crisis was a propaganda ploy. At 
another meeting in late November 1962, after Golitsyn 
accused Agency officers of assorted improprieties toward 
him, McCone "stood up to him somewhat angrily and 
demanded proof," which the defector never provided.W 
McCone and Golitsyn's CIA and FBI handlers put up 
with the defector's arrogance and irascibility for a time, 
because he appeared to provide sensitive information corrob-
orating previous reporting and leads to other potential 
sources.' Elder has characterized the thinking of McCone, 
Helms, Angleton, and the management of the DDP's SR 
Division at the time: "Golitsyn was threatening to go out in 
the world on his own. We felt he was the best defector we 
ever had. His potential was at least the best.... Besides, no 
one put the case to McCone that he should not see 
Golitsyn." Even a critical study prepared by the post-Angle-
ton CI Staff in 1976 described Golitsyn's substantiated intel-
ligence as "a tremendous collection... [with] invaluable 
insights.. .some of it was highly significant."/ 
Golitsyn's report-
ing, extensive in its own right, soared in value in the absence 
of other comparable HUMINT.

with McCone. The DCI thought Golitsyn might settle down if he met with the FBI but could not convince J. Edgar Hoover to see him. The FBI chief refused to 
violate his personal policy of not meeting with defectors, agents, or criminals and believed Golitsyn wanted an interview "simply on the basis of ego." Helms, speak-
ing for the DCI to the FBI liaison to CIA, Samuel Papich, noted that the attorney general had said "one should play up to the ego of an individual such as 
[Golitsyn],? but Papich (and Hoover) were unmoved. In February 1965, Bureau counterintelligence officials reported to Hoover that Golitsyn was too caught up in 
his theories to be trusted, and may even be a fabricator. In July 1965, Hoover ordered all official Bureau contact with the defector to cease. Helms, "Memorandum

McCone and the DDP also 
used Golitsyn as an analytical 
resource on the Soviet Union 
during and after the Cuban 
missile crisis. In October 
1962, the CI Staff had   
Golitsyn assess probable 
Soviet reaction to President Kennedy's speech imposing a 
quarantine on Cuba. Golitsyn thought Soviet Premier 
Nikita Khrushchev would go to the brink but then step 
back, knowing he could not win concessions in Berlin with-
out a war he was not prepared to start. In mid-January 
1963, the DCI asked Golitsyn to evaluate Moscow's appar-
ent failure to anticipate Washington's reaction to the deploy-
ment of offensive nuclear missiles in Cuba. Golitsyn 
presented his views in a hastily arranged interview with the 
CI Staff's chief analyst, Raymond Rocca. He judged that the 
Soviet maneuver was political, not military; Khrushchev had 
intended to force the West to negotiate over Berlin and 
other issues and to sow dissension among Western allies. 
According to Golitsyn, the Soviets had calculated all along 
that eventually they would have to remove the missiles, but 
they were willing to pay that price to make diplomatic gains. 
They did, however, misjudge how fast and how far the con-
frontation would escalate. Golitsyn's assessment tracked 
generally with McCone's and probably enhanced his credi-
bility with the DCI. 
By early 1963, however, McCone's curiosity about 
Golitsyn was satisfied, at least temporarily, and officers in 
SR Division?already weary of Golitsyn's incessant and 
increasing demands?had concluded that he had nothing 
else useful to offer. He had passed on almost all of his first-
hand knowledge, and he now purveyed new information 
largely from "analysis" of operational material US and for-
eign services gave him. ADDP 
Thomas Karamessines went so 
far as to write that "there is no 
question... that we allowed the 
defector to blackmail us into 
control...no defector, irrespec-
tive of his value, should be 
allowed to place us in that 
position." Except for Angleton 
and the CI Staff, there was lit-
tle resistance at Langley when 
Golitsyn accepted an invita-
tion from Britain's MI-5 to 
help it hunt Soviet agents in 
London. Golitsyn had wanted to move to the United King-
dom for several months, having, according to Elder, "real-
ized he had run out of credit here. Furthermore, he realized 
we were not going to bankroll his $15 million project to 
bring down the Communist Parry of the USSR." After que-
rying the British, McCone approved the relocation. Angle-
ton wanted Golitsyn back, however, and may have contrived 
(through a leak to a British tabloid) to force him out of 
England. After Golitsyn returned to the United States in 
August, McCone and Helms accepted Angleton's unprece-
dented proposal to take on the defector as a counterintelli-
gence adviser completely under CI Staff control. McCone 
appeared to agree with Helms that this troublesome and 
seemingly intractable case?which still seemed to have 
potential counterespionage benefits?would be best han-
dled outside SR Division lest it disrupt regular espionage 
operations. 
Golitsyn soon was back in McCone's office elaborating 
on the Soviet "master plan": the Sino-Soviet split was bogus, 
concocted by Moscow; the KGB had penetrated the 
Agency's Soviet division (with an agent codenamed "Sasha"); 
McCone sent an urgent EYES ONLY cable

asking him to

self-promotion, he could have seen an opportunity to ingratiate himself with the DCI..4

McCone and the Secret Wars (II): Counterintelligence and Security (U) 
White House Damage Control: The Profumo Affair (U) 
McCone?evidently for reasons of national security, 
diplomacy, domestic politics, and friendship with the 
Kenned s?took what 
ater described as an inordinate interest in a for-
eign sex and espionage scandal that brought down a British 
government. The principals in the episode were the British 
secretary of state for war, John Profumo; a Soviet naval 
attache and GRU officer, Yevgeny Ivanov; and a teenage 
English prostitute, Christine Keeler, who was servicing both 
men. Publicity about Profumo's infatuation with Keeler 
broke in October 1962, when she sold her story to a Lon-
don tabloid. Profumo disputed everything she said about 
their relationship and tried to suppress news coverage. His 
denial of impropriety to the House of Commons in March 
1963 soon was shown to be false, causing a public furor over 
possible breaches of security. In early June, Profumo admit-
ted to Prime Minister Harold Macmillan that he had lied. 
He then resigned from the Cabinet. Macmillan?whose 
government had already been shaken by several other coun-
terintelligence contretemps and had reached its nadir of 
public support?convened an official inquiry, which con-
cluded that the Profumo-Keeler-Ivanov link had not dam-
aged British national security.' McCone later agreed with a 
British official's characterization of the affair as "more of a 
bedroom farce [than] serious espionage." At the time, how-
ever, the DCI declared that "this matter [is] of great concern 
to highest authority," and Walter Elder said it caused "great 
excitement" at Langley and the White House. As it 
unfolded, the scandal revealed deep anxiety about its poten-
tial for compromising secrets and embarrassing the Kennedy 
administration.' 
Three US angles to the Profumo Affair?US-UK diplo-
matic relations, possible compromises of US intelligence 
secrets, and some of John Kennedy's private indiscretions 
before he was elected president?explain McCone's "inordi-
nate interest" in the scandal and his participation in

high-level meetings with FBI and Department of Defense 
and Department of State officials about it in mid-June 
1963." The diplomatic context in which the episode 
unfolded was the so-called "special relationship" Kennedy 
and Macmillan enjoyed as leaders of the Atlantic commu-
nity and the two most powerful countries in NATO. In 
keeping with the president's interest in affirming and pro-
tecting that political bond, McCone would have wanted to 
discover anything that might weaken or discredit it. 
1 he hrst concerned fleeting and innocuous contact between 
one of Keeler's friends and ambassadors David Bruce and 
Charles Bohlen at a high-society function to which all had 
been invited. Kennedy apparently already knew about the 
incident, probably from Bruce, and seemed unconcerned.

thoughtful The Truth At Last: My Story. Some British intelligence officials thought the whole business was a Soviet political action operation designed to discredit 
their government and did not take the espionage element too seriously. 
e other counterintelligence episodes that damaged Macmillan's reputation included Soviet penetrations of the Admiralty, the conviction of George Blake in 1961, 
and the defection of Harold "Kim" Philby in 1963. Conon Molody (alias Gordon Lansdale) was a Soviet illegal who ran the Portland spy ring, so named because it 
collected secrets from the Underwater Weapons Establishment at Portland, England. The ring's members included Morris and Helen Cohen (alias Peter and Helen 
Kroger), who were Soviet atomic spies in the United States until 1950. They fled the country the day Julius Rosenberg was arrested and arrived in England in 1954. 
Molody and the Cohens were convicted in March 1961. William John Vassall, a clerk in the Admiralty, stole secrets for the Soviets until his arrest in September 
1962. He was sentenced the same day that President Kennedy announced the Cuban missile crisis. Philby and Blake are too well known to require discussion here. 
All the above cases are conveniently summarized in Norman Polmar and Thomas B. Allen, Spy Book: The Encyclopedia of Espionage, 72-73,128-29,341,433-36,

McCone and the Secret Wars (II): Counterintelligence and Security (U) 
>c 
The timing of the possible Air Force security breach 
helps explain some of the worry it caused in Washington. 
The early 1960s were proving to be one of the worst periods 
in Western counterintelligence history, with numerous inci-
dents indicating serious problems inside several services: the 
defections of three NSA officers to the Soviet Union in 
1960; the arrests of George Blake, the Portland spy ring, and 
John Vassal! in Britain during 1961-62; the discovery of 
Soviet penetrations of the West German intelligence service 
in 1962 and the Swedish military in 1963; the arrest of a US 
Navy yeoman, attached to the US Navy headquarters in 
London with top secret and special NATO clearances, in 
September 1962 for spying for the GRU; "Kim" Philby's 
defection to Moscow in January 1963; the indictment of a 
Soviet spy ring in July 1963 in New York on charges of steal-
ing US military secrets; and the investigation of Sgt. Jack 
Dunlap, an NSA courier and probable GRU penetration at 
Ft. Meade. This succession of cases prompted several official 
inquiries into the US Intelligence Community's security 
practices and heightened the administration's and the DCI's 
wariness about further incidents.' 
President Kennedy's reputed personal connection to the 
Profumo affair became a potentially messy diplomatic and 
public relations issue for the administration?and, it 
appears, for McCone, whose role as the president's chief 
intelligence officer now took on an unprecedented aspect. 
The scandal broke in the United States just as the adminis-
tration was showcasing the Anglo-American relationship. 
The New York Herald Tribune and the Washington Post mis-
takenly reported that US intelligence services had uncovered 
Profumo's indiscretion and tipped off their British counter-
parts. Second, and far worse from the White House's per-
spective, the New York Journal-American claimed that one of 
"the biggest names in American politics" who held "a very 
high elective office" had been involved with the Keeler 
ring.' The White House was alarmed because just before 
and after the 1960 presidential election, John Kennedy 
allegedly had had assignations with one or two of Keeler's 
friends. The administration?not to mention Her Majesty's 
Government?would be humiliated if news of the presi-
dent's purported encounters with some of the same women 
in Britain's sex-for-secrets imbroglio appeared just after he 
made a state visit there. In late June, Robert Kennedy sum-
moned the Journal-American reporters to his office to con-
firm that they were referring to his brother during the 1960 
campaign and pre-inaugural period, and to demand that 
they reveal their sources. They refused. Soon after, the attor-
ney general threatened the paper with an antitrust suit, and 
it dropped its coverage of the affair.") 
Given McCone's friendship with Robert Kennedy?the 
chief protector of the president's reputation?and his 
responsibility as DCI for assessing the security damage of 
the Profumo episode, it seems likely that McCone knew the 
truth about John Kennedy's past link to the Keeler circle, 
used CIA resources to find out what the and the FBI 
had uncovered about it, and passed on what he learned 
o the attorney general. President Kenne ys 
tee ess encounters with women of dubious note?a Mafia 
moll (Judith Exner) and a suspected East German agent 
(Ellen Rometsch), among others?were widely known in 
official and unofficial Washington at the time and already 
had caused difficulties for the administration. With 
McCone's official duties and his intimate connections to the 
At a meeting with McCone, Gen. Carroll, and Alan Belmont of the FBI on 20 June 1963, McNamara said he felt like he was sitting on a bomb in this matter as he 
could not tell what would come out of it." The airmen told Air Force investigators that they had met Keeler in nightclubs but were not sexually involved with her or any 
of her friends. The airmen eventually were cleared. D.J. Brennan memoranda to William Sullivan (both FBI), 20 and 26 June 1963, Belmont memorandum to Tolson,

president's family, it is not surprising that he would have the 
Agency quietly find out all it could about any American 
involvement in the scandal?partly for diplomatic and secu-
rity reasons, but also in large measure to aid the White 
House in squelching a particularly ill-timed scandal. In part 
because of the DCI's apparent assistance, "once again Bobby 
handled a presidential lapse," one of John Kennedy's biogra-
phers has written. No American officials were tied to the 
Keeler ring, and later that summer US intelligence services 
concluded that the Profumo incident had not damaged 
American security interests. Despite all the attention he paid 
to the Profumo-Keeler episode at the time, however, 
McCone professed to have "no recollection" of it when 
questioned during the 1980s.30
..Itik 
"The Last of the Romanovs" (U) 
McCone had to help contain the security and political 
damage from another runaway counterintelligence case, that  
of Col. Michal Goleniewski  
Gole-
niewski was one ot the West's most valuable CI sources dur-
ing the Cold War, but his role as a useful asset ended when 
he became mentally deranged. He was a Polish intelligence 
officer who worked as a KGB mole in his own service 
Goleniewski had psychological problems, however, that 
emerged fully after he defected?notably his fanciful claim 
to be the last Russian tsarevich and heir to the Romanov 
name and fortune. Seized by this delusion and resentful at 
the treatment CIA officers had given him, Goleniewski 
stopped cooperating with debriefers in 1963, holed up in 
his New York apartment, refused to return a handgun the 
Agency had given him, and began writing long, rambling 
letters to US government officials?among them the chair-
man of the House Immigration Subcommittee, the presi-
dent, the attorney general, the FBI director, and the DCI. 
CIA renegotiated Goleniewski's contract in his favor in 
October 1963, and, when that incentive failed, took the 
opposite tack and suspended it in early 1964.3* 
Soon after, Goleniewski's story appeared in the press, 
with the New York Journal-American taking the lead in pub-
licizing "what looms as a greater scandal than the famous 
Alger Hiss case." Goleniewski made sensational public 
charges about KGB penetrations of the US government: at 
least 19 employees were Soviet spies, including four at CIA, 
a dozen at the Department of State (most posted to the 
embassy in Warsaw), and three scientists working on classi-
fied projects; the Agency had lost more than $1 million in

fumo FOIA File 65-68218. In contrast to the Profumo affair, the attorney general evidently did not enlist McCone in helping contain two other potential scandals: 
the president's encounters with Rometsch, a capital "party girl" suspected of working for the East German Stasi; and his affair with Mary Meyer (the estranged wife 
of CA Staff chief Cord Meyer), whose diary describing their relationship was acquired (and, in some accounts, destroyed) by Angleton after her murder during a rob-
bery. Given the potential intelligence angle in the Rometsch case, it may seem odd that Robert Kennedy did not involve McCone. Her relationship with the presi-
dent, however?unlike Keeler's with Profumo and Ivanov?was purely personal. Summers, 309-12; Burleigh, 246-49.

McCone and the Secret Wars (II): Counterintelligence and Security (U) 
operational funds in Vienna that wound up in the hands of 
communist organizations; and lax security practices guaran-
teed that more enemy agents remained undiscovered. This 
counterintelligence cause c?bre caught the attention of the 
House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate 
Internal Security Subcommittee. The latter subpoenaed 
Goleniewski, but he refused to appear, pleading illness. (He 
later accused CIA of preventing him from testifying by 
keeping him under detention in a New York safehouse.) The 
defector's story was widely reported and prompted many 
editorials urging the US government to tighten security. A 
vituperative anticommunist member of the House Un-
American Affairs Committee, John Ashbrook (R-OH), took 
to the floor to denounce the government for harboring sub-
versives and covering up Soviet espionage in the United 
States. An eight-year-old list of over 800 security risks at the 
Department of State was retrieved from the files and 
resulted in a number of personnel investigations there and 
the recall of several employees from Warsaw.33XL 
Amid this public row, the Agency's relationship with 
Goleniewski degenerated further, as did his mental condi-
tion. The defector berated CIA to his FBI contacts, spurned 
the ministrations of DDP officer George Kisevalter (perhaps 
the Agency's most experienced handler of defectors), and 
pressured CIA to restore his contract by threatening legal 
action and full disclosure. He went ahead and told his tale 
on a radio talk show in New York and cooperated with a 
headline-seeking book project on the Romanov mystery 
written by the Journal-American reporter responsible for the 
outlandish stories published so far.34X 
McCone first got involved in Goleniewski's case in mid-
1963 when he approved a special financial and security 
arrangement?much of it already set in place?and Agency 
sponsorship of a private congressional bill to grant citizen-
ship to Goleniewski. The defector had written to McCone 
in April complaining about his treatment and threatening to 
tell the White House about his situation. The DCI spoke to 
Goleniewski, whom he regarded as a "psychopathic case," 
but he thought the Agency should take extra measures to 
ensure the defector's physical and financial security in recog-
nition of his past value as a counterintelligence source. 
McCone also had to assuage the irate chairman of the 
House Immigration Subcommittee, Michael Feighan (D-
OH), who was sponsoring the citizenship bill without 
knowing either all the details of the case or the Agency's pro-
cedures for dealing with private legislation for defectors. 
The DCI and other CIA officers persuaded Feighan to 
encourage Goleniewski to be more cooperative. That 
approach did not work. Goleniewski went public several 
months later, and the congressman took his side in the dis-
pute, at least until the Romanov fantasy eclipsed the CI 
aspect.35)64( 
As the situation unfolded, McCone kept the White 
House, Congress, and USIB informed, and oversaw how 
Carter, Helms, and General Counsel Lawrence Houston 
managed the increasingly difficult case. A new CIA angle 
briefly arose in January 1965 when 
Herman Kimsey, publicly 
contended that the Agency possessed finger and sole prints 
and dental charts that corroborated Goleniewski's claim to 
royal lineage. McCone also had to deal with some residual 
antipathy from the FBI, which CIA had kept out of the 
Goleniewski case until after the Pole arrived in the West. 
One unexpected benefit from the problems with Gole-
niewski was a series of improvements in the Agency's defec-
tor handling procedures.'...X 
Overall, McCone and his deputies made the best of a 
bizarre situation that was imploding at the same time CIA 
had to cope with unprecedented public and media criticism 
and the DCI's relations with the White House were growing 
more tenuous (see Chapter 15). By placating a recalcitrant 
asset, keeping members of the Intelligence Community 
apprised of the case's problems, and anticipating the conse-
quences of adverse publicity, McCone and CIA executives 
minimized political damage to the Agency while enabling 
Besides the sources cited above, see also the many news articles in the Goleniewski clipping file, HIC. The tone of the Journal-American stories is conveyed in these

US and Western services to exploit Goleniewski's knowledge 
effectively. (U) 
Persistent Suspicions about Francis Gary Powers (U) 
McCone undertook a vigorous-perhaps heavy-
handed-inquiry into the U-2 incident involving Francis 
Gary Powers immediately after the Soviets released the cap-
tured pilot in a prisoner exchange in February 1962.'7 
McCone believed that more lay behind the shootdown in 
May 1960 than either Powers would admit or most techni-
cal evidence indicated. Personal and patriotic sentiments, 
institutional interests, and security concerns motivated 
McCone's energetic quest for an answer, and, when one he 
deemed satisfactory was not forthcoming, they drove his 
vindictive actions against the pilot.) 
Francis Gary Powers on trial in Moscow in 1960 (U) 
Influencing McCone's aversion to Powers was his knowl-
edge that some senior Agency and community officials had 
always doubted Powers's story. Just after the incident, CIA 
officers told journalists that Soviet antiaircraft missiles could 
not reach as high as the Kremlin claimed they had and that 
the plane had suffered a flameout or other malfunction that 
caused it to drop within range of Soviet air defenses and 
fighters. Then-DCI Allen Dulles gave that evaluation to the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 31 May 1960 and 
the following month to C.L. Sulzberger of the New York 
Times, who noted in his diary that 
Dulles is sure Gary Powers was not shot down at nor-
mal altitude (about 70,000 feet). The U-2, when it 
reaches rarefied altitudes, tends to get a flameout. We 
think Powers glided down to try and restart his motor. 
He was then shot down around 30,000-40,000 feet. 
Present Soviet defenses don't go above 60,000 feet. We 
think Powers parachuted. 
According to a secret Department of State report in June 
1960, the U-2 debris displayed in Moscow's Gorky Park was 
in much better condition than would have been expected 
had it been damaed by a missile and then plunged nearly 
r  
13 miles to earth. 
n October 1960, the 1-'131 began a 
full investigation of Powers and his family, exchanging infor-
mation with CIA well into 1961. The Bureau's conclusion 
about Powers's loyalty was redacted from documents 
released in his FBI FOIA file, but McCone would have been 
privy at least to the content of the unexpurgated originals. 
Other information in Powers's file indicates that the Bureau 
remained suspicious toward him.38.3X

McCone and the Secret Wars (II): Counterintelligence and Security (U) 
So did many Americans. Instead of returning home to a 
hero's welcome, Powers faced a barrage of criticism. Newsday 
asked whether he was "A HERO OR A MAN WHO 
FAILED HIS MISSION?" A US senator said "I wish that 
this pilot who was being paid thirty thousand dollars a year 
had shown only ten percent of the spirit and courage of 
Nathan Hale." An American Legion official called Powers "a 
cowardly American who evidently valued his own skin far 
more than the welfare of the nation that was paying him so 
handsomely." The president of the Fund for the Republic 
opened a study of the decline of character in the United 
States by asking, "Should we be alarmed by the difference 
between the behavior of Airman Powers and of Nathan 
Hale?"' (U) 
McCone, sternly moralistic and patriotic, shared these 
sentiments and must have found Powers's public apology at 
his trial?"I am deeply repentant and profoundly sorry"?
especially hard to take.' The widely published photograph 
of Powers with his head slumped to his chest, probably 
taken during a moment of fatigue and despondency, never-
theless was seen by many Americans as a symbol of craven 
collaboration and no doubt set badly with the DCI. Beyond 
his personal feelings, McCone may have sensed that the 
Agency's reputation might suffer if he did not try to make 
Powers pay a price for seeming to cooperate with the enemy. 
He may also have wanted to deter other reconnaissance fly-
ers from placing survival over national security and giving 
the Soviet Union more propaganda victories. (U) 
Unresolved counterintelligence and security questions 
added to McCone's animus toward Powers. Since mid-1960, 
both CIA and the FBI had investigated leads and theories to 
explain the loss of Powers's U-2. These included a break in 
communications security that could have allowed the Sovi-
ets to monitor transmissions between pilots and the U-2 
control base in Adana, Turkey; sabotage of the aircraft in 
and hijack-
ing ot the spyplane by a purported special Soviet intelligence 
unit codenamed Molniya ("lightning" in Russian). Soviet 
interest in acquiring a U-2 was well known in the commu-
nity, and, farfetched as it sounded, the hijacking theory at 
least had the merit of resolving the dispute over the U-2's 
altitude when it was damaged. Although the Soviets claimed 
it had been flying at 70,000 feet, the consensus of US intel-
ligence officials at the time was that Soviet antiaircraft mis-
siles could not reach it. That meant that either the U-2 had 
lost power and dropped within the missiles' range or that it 
was forced down some other way?according to the Molniya 
theory, because Soviet operatives had somehow drugged 
Powers.4' (U) 
Another, more likely, possibility troubled McCone as 
much: Powers had defected and perhaps even had been a 
Soviet agent with the mission of delivering a U-2 behind the 
Iron Curtain. Former' DDCI John McMahon?at the time 
a high-ranking official in the U-2 program?has said that 
just after Powers was shot down, McCone thought the pilot 
had defected. Nothing McCone had learned since May 
1960?including a favorable CIA security review of Powers 
that he probably saw or knew about?had changed his 
mind. A defection would have partly explained some of the 
U-2 incident's anomalies: Powers's failure to use his ejection 
seat, which would have set off the aircraft's camera-destruct 
mechanism; the relatively good condition of the wreckage; 
Powers's reportedly comfortable treatment while in prison; 
and?from a counterintelligence standpoint, probably the 
most disquieting improbability?his emergence relatively 
unscathed from what experts considered an unsurvivable 
freefall and parachute drop from an extreme height. As the 
former director general of Britain's Royal Air Force medical 
service publicly commented at the time: 
It is utterly impossible for a pilot to bail out [at that 
altitude] without using ejection equipment. He would 
be destroyed instantly by the slipstream and air pres-
sure. Should he survive this, he could not last more 
than 45 seconds without the oxygen equipment 
attached to the ejection seat, and the 50-below cold 
would make life impossible.42>?, 
According to Lawrence Houston, McCone 
suspected that Powers a 
flown his plane to a lower altitude and then parachuted 
before Soviet missiles shot it down. The fact that, as Hous-
ton put it, "we [CIA] were getting slightly different stories" 
from Powers during intensive debriefings by technical and 
operations officers in February 1962 made McCone even

more skeptical. Of course, McCone did not want the 
Agency's suspicions of Powers to leak out. Just after Powers 
was released, a journalist asked the DCI whether the pilot 
was a defector. McCone responded, "[O]f course a small 
segment of people in the U.S. may think so, but there was 
nothing so far that would give credence to that belief." The 
DCI did not hint that he was in that "small segment of peo-
ple."". 
McCone disagreed with the findings of the CIA damage 
assessment team that debriefed Powers for two weeks after 
his repatriation and largely exonerated him. That was the 
same team that had met in the summer of 1960 to estimate 
what Powers knew about the overflight program and could 
have told Soviet interrogators. After the 1962 debriefings, 
the team concluded that Powers's disclosures had caused 
much less harm than previously thought and indicated it 
was satisfied with his behavior in captivity' 
At Houston's suggestion, McCone quickly convened a 
board of inquiry to consider whether the US government 
should charge Powers with dereliction of duty. The board's 
members were retired federal judge E. Barrett Prettyman, 
the chairman; John Bross from the DDP; and Lt. Gen. 
Harold Bull, a consultant to ONE. McCone directed the 
board to answer three questions: Did Powers fulfill the terms 
of his contract with CIA? Did he conduct himself in captiv-
ity as a patriotic American should? Did the Agency's man-
agement of the U-2 program need improvement? The 
Prettyman panel spent nine days reviewing a large body of 
information, 
testimony from 23 witnesses, including Powers, 
military personnel associated with him, and medical experts; 
a film of Powers's trial; 
and photographs of the U-2 's wreckage 
an an analysis of them by the plane's builder, "Kelly" 
Johnson of Lockheed. In a 14-page letter to McCone, the 
board stated its conclusions: "[T]tle evidence establishes 
overwhelmingly that Powers's account was...truthful...that 
throughout this incident Powers acted in accordance with 
the terms of his employment and instructions and brief-
ings...and that he complied with his obligations as an 
American citizen." Accordingly, Powers was entitled to back 
pay of approximately $52,000. Around the same time, a 
group of Air Force experts, convened by the secretary of the 
Air Force at McCone's request, supported Johnson's analysis 
(and Powers's description) that a nearby explosion could 
have broken off the aircraft's wings.45)?
McCone was unconvinced and kept looking for reasons 
to penalize Powers. His concerns about Powers's supposed 
misjudgments and possible security breaches came through 
clearly in questions he posed to Houston just after reading 
the Prettyman report. McCone wanted to know if Powers 
could have been in touch with outsiders after he received the 
mission brief; if Soviet aviation activity during the flight was 
unusual, suggesting the Soviets already knew about it; and if 
Powers's actions after his plane was damaged made it harder 
for him to activate the destruct mechanism. Houston's 
respective answers were: possibly, apparently, and probably 
not. With President Kennedy's assent, McCone reconvened 
the Prettyman board to reconsider the only evidence that

Several reports about Powers's private contacts, suggesting that he might have defected, were all found to be provocations. For example, CIA had determined by Sep-
tember 1960 that a British report that the Soviets had recruited Powers in late 1959 was false. An Agency counterintelligence officer called the information "the last 
checkable lead on any reference to disloyalty on the part of Powers." It is not known if McCone was aware of the report or the evaluation.

contradicted Powers' testimony 
McCone and the Secret Wars (II): Counterintelligence and Security (U) 
In early March 1962, the Agency issued a public state-
ment?approved by McCone?that seemed to accept Pow-
ers's version of the shootdown. The pilot had "lived up to 
the terms of his employment...and...his obligations as an 
American"; "no evidence has been found" of Soviet espio-
nage activity (i.e., Powers did not try to defect)  or of sabo-
e. On the Prettyman board's conclusion 
he statement said: 
Some information from confidential sources was avail-
able. Some of it corroborated Powers and some of it 
was inconsistent with parts with Powers's story, but 
that which was inconsistent was in part contradictory 
with itself and subject to various interpretations. Some 
of this information was the basis for considerable 
speculation.. .that Powers' plane had descended grad-
ually from its extreme altitude and had been shot 
down by a Russian fighter at medium altitude. On 
careful analysis, it appears that the information on 
which these stories were based was erroneous or was 
susceptible to varying interpretations. The board came 
to the conclusion that it could not accept a doubtful 
interpretation in this regard which was inconsistent 
with all the other known facts.,:k 
The statement, however, did not dispel completely the 
impression that Powers somehow had done something 
unpatriotic. For Powers and his supporters, the devil was in 
its nuances and omissions. The statement did not declare 
unequivocally that, in the Agency's judgment, his disclo-
sures to the Soviets had not harmed national security, nor 
did it vouch for what Powers claimed he had and had not 
told his captors. Also, the Agency withheld other, more sen-
sitive findings favorable to Powers. Consequently, at a Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in early March 
1962, one of the members asked McCone, "Don't you think 
he is being left with just a little bit of a cloud hanging over 
him? If he did everything he is supposed to do, why leave it 
hanging?" McCone declined this opportunity to endorse the 
Prettyman Board's findings, to acknowledge that Powers had 
concealed secrets while in captivity, or to officially absolve 
him. Powers appeared at an open hearing of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, chaired by longtime Agency 
ally Richard Russell, and won praise from the members and 
generally favorable press coverage. In April, the Air Force 
reinstated Powers?a decision in which CIA, the Depart-
ment of State, and the White House concurred?and Lock-
heed hired him as a test pilot the following December.* 
The swing in public sentiment toward Powers must have 
irked McCone, who then took other steps against him. In 
late June 1962, the DCI decided that commercial publica-
tion of a book by Powers about the shootdown "would be 
harmful to Powers and not in the best interests of the 
Agency" and sent the general counsel and a high-ranking 
DDP officer to dissuade the pilot. They reported that after 
discussing the matter with Powers, "he was reluctantly 
receptive to our guidance." Powers wrote to McCone, how-
ever, that he might reconsider writing a book later. In April 
1963, the DCI awarded the Intelligence Star to all American 
U-2 pilots except Powers, and he may have advised Presi-
dent Kennedy not to meet with Powers, even though a year 
before the president had welcomed two captured Air Force 
reconnaissance pilots released by Moscow.' N 
The Agency's investigation into John F. Kennedy's assassi-
nation gave McCone further reason to wonder about Pow-
ers. Lee Harvey Oswald was stationed at a U-2 base in Japan 
during 1957-58, before he defected to the Soviet Union in

1959, and speculation arose that he had divulged technical 
information about the U-2 program that would have helped 
the Soviets shoot down Powers's aircraft. By May 1964, CIA 
had concluded that Oswald did not have access to such 
information. After that possibility was discounted, McCone 
thought he had another reason to suspect that Powers had 
done something wrong.' (U) 
Toward the end of his directorship, McCone appears to 
have decided to wash his hands of the Powers matter. In 
March 1965, he approved awarding the pilot the Intelli-
gence Star. Two days before McCone stepped down, DDCI 
Marshall Carter presented Powers with the award, which 
bore the year 1963 engraved on the back.' /W 
Improving Community Security (U) 
The rash of counterintelligence and security incidents 
involving US citizens that erupted in the early 1960s 
required strong action from McCone in his capacities as 
DCI and chairman of USIB. Including those cases men-
tioned above, over a dozen US government personnel, most 
of them in the military or from NSA, were implicated in 
espionage activity for hostile services during 1961-65.5' 
Much of the response to those specific incidents was han-
dled by the organizations in which the perpetrators worked. 
Members of USIB also took broader steps at the community 
level to tighten and rationalize interagency security. N, 
McCone's statutory responsibilities for protecting sources 
and methods did not grant him specific authority to imple-
ment rules outside CIA, but he tried to rectify that situation 
through bureaucratic means.' He made substantial progress 
in overcoming agencies' jealous protection of their preroga-
tives and in encouraging them to recognize their mutual 
interests. Three of his first accomplishments along those 
lines were bringing to closure protracted negotiations over a 
system of uniform security control markings and procedures 
for disseminating and using intelligence, having USIB pro-
mulgate policies for exchanging counterintelligence and 
security information among member agencies, and estab-
lishing consistent counterintelligence and security practices 
at installations overseas) 
The DCI's main instrument was the Intelligence Board 
Security Committee (IBSEC), established in 1959 but ener-
gized during his tenure. Under the chairmanship of either 
the DCI or CIA's director of security, IBSEC also imple-
mented PFIAB's recommendations for changes in security 
practices following the Dunlap case.54 Those recommenda-
tions included imposing stricter standards for personal con-
duct (especially "abnormal sexual activity"); developing

According to John McMahon, Robert Kennedy asked McCone to pressure Powers not to write a book about the shootdown. David Wise and Thomas B. Ross were 
about to have The U-2 Affair published when they heard that Powers was going to write his own story. They did not want any competition and complained to the 
attorney general, who in turn told McCone that it was inappropriate for the pilot to write anything. McMahor H, 33. Kennedy's intervention notwith-
standing, the DCI had his own motives for keeping Powers quiet. Powers eventually told his version in Operatt ht (1970),

McCone and the Secret Wars (II): Counterintelligence and Security (U) 
more intense security indoctrination programs (including 
counterintelligence case studies); and resolving any doubts 
about a suspect employee in favor of protecting national 
security. After a former NSA cryptanalyst, Victor Hamilton, 
defected to the Soviet Union in 1963, IBSEC oversaw the 
response of community components in coordinating 
medical, security, and personnel information during appli-
cant and employee investigations.K 
Because military personnel committed most of the anti-
US espionage uncovered in the early 1960s, McCone sought 
to tighten security procedures for servicemen in community 
organizations that fell under his purview as DCI. In practical 
terms, he could do little about NSA, which answered to the 
secretary of defense, and the military services' intelligence 
components were even farther from his reach. After the Dun-
lap case broke in the summer of 1963, McCone pointed out 
in a memorandum to Secretary of Defense McNamara how 
successful CIA's security procedures had been and com-
mended them to the Pentagon. One entity he could deal 
with more directly was NPIC. He wrote to McNamara that 
he had determined that all Department of Defense employ-
ees assigned to NPIC would be investigated and processed as 
CIA personnel were, including the taking of a polygraph. 
The secretary of defense said he was anxious to begin poly-
graphing new military assignees at NSA but foresaw prob-
lems if that were done to Pentagon personnel currently at 
NPIC. McCone and McNamara therefore agreed that all ser-
vicemen detailed to NPIC in the future would be "fluttered"

McCone made less progress in establishing uniform per-
sonnel security standards throughout the community. 
Expanding the scope of security investigations was expen-
sive, and the DCI historically did not have responsibility for 
designating access to classified defense-related material. Dis-
cussions among community organizations about standards 
for access to sensitive compartmented information dragged 
on for the rest of McCone's tenure. In addition, unfavorable 
comments from several congressional committees about 
using the polygraph on federal employees made it hard for 
McCone to incorporate the device more extensively in 
screening community personne1.56Nt 
Unauthorized disclosures of classified information in the 
media became a growing problem during McCone's direc-
torship as journalists took a more adversarial approach 
toward the national security establishment in general and 
CIA in particular. McCone was sensitive to unfavorable 
publicity and "leaks," and he instituted many internal inves-
tigations into news stories that appeared to be based on clas-
sified information. These time-consuming inquiries almost 
always proved fruitless. The journalists had First Amend-
ment protection, and their government sources were excep-
tionally difficult to uncover because so much intelligence 
was so widely disseminated within the community. Among 
numerous examples, two stand out as fair illustrations of the 
challenge McCone and USIB faced. (U)

McCone was willing to go along with another, more dras-
tic, approach to preventing leaks?one identified in the so-
called "Family Jewels" report of 1973 as among the most 
troubling of the Agency's questionable domestic activities.' 
"Project MOCKINGBIRD" was, according to the report, "a 
telephone intercept activity.. .conducted between 12 March 
1963 and 15 June 1963... [that] targeted two Washington-
based newsmen [Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott] who, at the 
time, had been publishing news articles based on, and fre-
quently quoting, classified materials of this Agency and oth-
ers, including Top Secret '62 The 
Office of Security, then under Sheffield Edwards, ran

officer who worked on the operation, Edwards received his 
orders from McCone, who agreed (under pressure from the 
attorney general) to authorize the wiretaps of the journalists' 
homes and office. Because their main source(s) appeared to be 
Si The "Family Jewels" report was a compendium of possibly illegal CIA activities that James Schlesinger ordered OIG to compile soon after he became DCI in Feb-
ruary 1973. It included details of domestic spying, drug resting, mail opening, and assassination planning, some of which went on during McCone's tenure. Press 
disclosures of some of the report's contents precipitated investigations into CIA operations by the Rockefeller Commission and special congressional committees led 
by Sen. Frank Church and Rep. Otis Pike.

McCone and the Secret Wars (II): Counterintelligence and Security (U) 
in the Department of Defense, McCone had Elder brief 
McNamara and the director of DIA. (An employee in ONE 
was regarded as the most likely leaker inside the Agency.) 
Besides the DCI and Elder, only three other Agency managers 
supposedly knew about MOCKINGBIRD?DDCI Carter, 
Executive Director-Comptroller Kirkpatrick, and General 
Counsel Houston. (A few security personnel who processed 
the take from the wiretaps also were witting.))Lict 
MOCKINGBIRD did not identify Allen and Scott's spe-
cific sources, but it helped reveal the journalists' methods 
and many of their contacts outside CIA and the Pentagon, 
including members of Congress and their staffers, adminis-
tration officials, and current and former federal employees. 
By showing how far well-connected Washington newsmen 
cast their reportorial nets, the operation underscored how 
difficult it was to catch leakers en flagrante delicto. Surveil-
lance of Allen and Scott was suspended after a few months, 
and MOCKINGBIRD was terminated, just after McCone 
left Langley." 
The Man Who Protected the Secrets (U) 
The several-year outbreak of counterintelligence and 
security incidents that began in the late 1950s and contin-
ued through McCone's tenure was the worst the Intelligence 
Community faced until the "decade of the spy" in the 
1980s. The cases arose at a politically inopportune time for 
the DCI, charged as he was after the Bay of Pigs with prop-
erly managing CIA's clandestine activities and preventing 
operational embarrassments. Some of the counterintelli-
gence and security episodes that came to term during his 
tenure resulted from mistakes and oversights committed 
before, but as the incumbent, McCone had to accept 
responsibility for them. He generally handled the controver-
sies appropriately, avoiding undue publicity, allaying policy-
makers' concerns, and instituting useful preventatives at the 
community level. Perhaps as important, he appreciated his 
own limitations in the counterintelligence field, and, except 
for cases that were especially sensitive or that disrupted liai-
son relationships, he left CI matters to more experienced 
lieutenants. That said, while he was willing to entertain the 
maxim that "no intelligence service can for very long be any 
better than its counterintelligence component," he did not 
blithely accept unfounded ideas from even as vaunted an 
intellect as James Angleton. (U) 
On the debit side, McCone's relative inexperience with 
counterintelligence probably made him defer too much to 
his operations deputies, Helms and Angleton. Had McCone 
given the Golitsyn defection more direct attention, some of 
the early problems it caused internally and with sister ser-
vices might have been avoided or attenuated. The forbear-
ance McCone and his deputies exhibited toward that 
difficult case said more about the Agency's poverty of Soviet 
intelligence sources than anything else. Some espionage 
operations that hostile services began or kept running in the 
early and mid-1960s went undetected even when CIA's 
counterintelligence capabilities arguably were as keen as 
they ever would be. Lastly, McCone did not recognize that 
the Agency's CI efforts were too focused on European prob-
lems and Soviet operations while the Cold War?including 
the one fought in the shadows?was fast becoming a multi-
polar, truly global conflict. Serving under two activist 
administrations, he helped the Agency take espionage and 
covert action into new theaters. Counterintelligence at CIA, 
in contrast?perhaps reflecting its bureaucratic culture of 
compartmentation and secrecy, and the idee fixe of Angle-
ton?remained parochial, inbred, and unadaptive during 
McCone's directorship. (U)

Death of the President (U) 
J
ohn McCone and Lyman Kirkpatrick, the Agency's 
Executive Director-Comptroller, met with PFIAB 
through the morning of 22 November 1963. The 
main topic of discussion was CIA's image problem, 
which McCone attributed to hostile journalists. The DCI 
planned to fly to California that afternoon for the Thanks-
giving holiday and, before leaving, over lunch, wanted to 
talk about the PFLAB meeting with his senior deputies. He, 
Kirkpatrick, Richard Helms, Albert Wheelon, Ray Cline, 
and Sherman Kent were eating in the French Room, a small 
space next to the director's office, when Walter Elder dashed 
in and cried out, "The president's been shod" X 
McCone turned on the television, watched the news bul-
letins, phoned the attorney general at his nearby home, and 
said, "I'm going to Hickory Hill to be with Bobby."' The 
DCI made his call before the overloaded Washington-area 
telephone system went down 30 minutes after the first news 
from Dallas. He remembered wondering on the short drive 
to the Kennedy house "who could be responsible for a thing 
like this. Was it the result of bigotry and hatred that was 
expressed in certain areas of the country, of which Dallas 
was one? Was this an international plot?" (U) 
While McCone was with Robert and Ethel Kennedy in 
their second floor library, the attorney general answered the 
phone, listened briefly, and then said, "He's dead." McCone 
recalled feeling shock, disbelief, profound sadness, and great 
concern for the country. A few minutes later, he and Robert 
left the house and walked around the lawn, speaking pri-
vately. One of the numerous phone calls to interrupt them 
was from Vice President Lyndon Johnson in Dallas. After 
expressing his condolences, Johnson told Robert that the 
assassination might be part of a worldwide plot and indi-
cated that he probably should be sworn in right away. The 
attorney general was initially taken aback but then agreed,

found out the appropriate procedure from the Department 
of Justice, and informed the presidential entourage in Dal-
las. He wanted to fly there right away, but McCone said that 
would take too long and suggested instead that the slain 
president's body be brought to Washington as soon as possi-
ble. Air Force One landed at Andrews Air Force Base that 
evening, and John Kennedy's body was taken to Bethesda 
Naval Medical Center for an autopsy. Meanwhile, the con-
trovers over who had killed him, and why, had already 
begun. 
Initial Fears of a Conspiracy (U) 
McCone returned to Headquarters at around 1530, sum-
moned the CIA Executive Committee, asked the Intelli-
gence Community's Watch Committee to convene at the 
Pentagon, issued orders for all stations and bases to report 
any signs of a conspiracy and to watch all Soviet personnel, 
especially intelligence officers, for indications that the Soviet 
Union was trying to take advantage of the disarray in Wash-
ington. The immediate reaction at Langley, as elsewhere in 
the US government, was to suspect that a foreign, probably 
communist-directed, effort to destabilize the United States 
might be underway. Richard Helms recalled that "[v]e all 
went to battle stations over the possibility that this might be 
a plot?and who was pulling the strings. We were very busy 
sending messages all over the world to pick up anything that 
might indicate that a conspiracy had been formed to kill the 
President of the United States?and then what was to come 
next." One of the first cables was the following message 
Helms sent to all CIA stations overseas: 
Tragic death of President Kennedy requires all of us to 
look sharp for any unusual intelligence developments.

directed that a special

obtained a graphic film of

an amateur photographer named Abraham Zapruder, 
McCone had NPIC officers analyze the footage (particularly 
the time between shots) and prepare briefing boards for the 
service.' 
Lee Harvey Oswald (U) 
Photo: UPI/Bettman 
Some senior Agency officers looked into possible KGB 
involvement. The chief of the DDP's SR Division, David 
Murphy, framed the essential question the day after: "[W]as 
Oswald, wittingly or unwittingly, part of a plot to murder 
President Kennedy in Dallas as an attempt to further exacer-
bate sectional strife and render the US government less 
capable of dealing with Soviet initiatives over the next year?" 
Also on the 23rd, Mexico City station reported that less 
than two months earlier, Oswald had met with a KGB 
officer possibly from the Thirteenth Directorate?responsi-
ble for assassination and sabotage?at the Soviet embassy in 
Mexico City. Headquarters officers speculated on 
24 November that "[a] lthough it appears that he [Oswald] 
was then thinking only about a peaceful change of residence 
to the Soviet Union, it is also possible that he was getting 
documented to make a quick escape after assassinating the 
President."' (U) 
The Agency's inability to locate Nikita Khrushchey right 
after the assassination especially alarmed McCone and his 
deputies. The Soviet premier's apparent absence from Mos-
cow could have meant that he was in a secret command cen-
ter, either hunkering down for an American reprisal, or 
possibly preparing to strike at the United States. "We were 
very high in tension about any indicators which would sup-
port such a theme," Helms said. "It became manifest  within 
24 or 48 hours, however, that this was not the case.'

One of the Agency's star Soviet defectors, Peter Deriabin, wrote a lengthy memorandum a few days after the assassination arguing that Oswald was a KGB agent who 
either was dispatched to kill Kennedy or was sent to the United States on another mission and then committed the murder on his own. Deriabin contended that the 
Kremlin would have accomplished several objectives by eliminating Kennedy. Among them were removing the West's preeminent Cold Warrior from the scene; con-
straining US covert actions against Cuba, which would be stigmatized as acts of vengeance; and divertine the Soviet people's attention from domestic problems.

news of the assassination dee ly 
shocked their leaders and made them fear US retaliation. 
For some time after the assassination, and particularly 
following Oswald's murder on the 24th, Agency leaders 
would not rule out a domestic or foreign conspiracy?the 
latter possibly involving the Soviet Union or Cuba. A Head-
quarters cable on the 28th stated that "[wle have by no 
means excluded the possibility that other as yet unknown 
persons may have been involved or even that other powers 
may have played a role." On 1 December, the station in 
Mexico City, where Oswald had visited the Soviet and 
Cuban consulates a few weeks before the assassination, was 
told to "continue to follow all leads and tips. The question 
of whether Oswald acted solely on his own has still not been 
finally resolved." Two weeks later, Headquarters told the sta-
tion to "continue watch for...evidence of their [Soviet or 
Cuban] complicity..." McCone suggested two possible cul-
prits if Oswald had not acted alone. "Castro's been so fright-
fully intemperate in some of his talks," he told a senior 
Pentagon official, and "it would be within his capability if 
he thought he could get away with it, I think. Khrushchev, 
no. On the other hand, I don't know how completely 
Khrushchev controls the KGB." If either theory proved 
credible, Helms remembered, "[w]e could have had a very 
nasty situation. What would be the retaliation? A startled 
America could do some extreme things.......' X 
Besides determining whether an international crisis was 
imminent, Agency officers also tried to find out as much as 
they could about Oswald. Mexico City station reported on 
the 22nd that he had been at the Soviet and Cuban embas-
sies in the Mexican capital during late September-early 
-re?4 
Death of the President (U) 
October. Most of the assassination-related information 
about which McCone briefed President Johnson, McGeorge 
Bundy, and Dean Rusk during the next week concerned the 
Oswald-Cuba connection. On 23 November, McCone 
apprised the president and Bundy of the station's trace 
results. Later in the day, the station reported that the Mexi-
can police had arrested a Mexican national working at the 
Cuban consulate who supposedly talked to Oswald in Sep-
tember. That evening, McCone told Rusk about all these 
developments. On the 25th, a Nicaraguan walk-in to the 
US embassy in Mexico City said that when he was in the 
Cuban consulate in mid-September, he heard Cubans talk 
about assassination and saw them give Oswald money. 
Within a few days, however, this alarming report was shown 
to be a fabrication. McCone discussed the incident with the 
president and Bundy on 30 November and 1 December. 
Between 23 November and 5 December, the DCI briefed 
Johnson on assassination developments and other intelli-
gence matters every day but two?in varying measures, to 
communicate news about the investigation, to demonstrate 
how CIA was involved in it, and to create a bond with the 
new president 
McCone also participated in two rituals surrounding 
John Kennedy's death. On Saturday the 23rd, he went to 
the White House to pay last respects to the president, and 
on Monday the 25th, he attended the state funeral at St. 
Matthew's Cathedral in Washington. That morning, CIA 
and the FBI received numerous reports that attempts would 
be made to assassinate foreign leaders invited to the funeral. 
McCone personally told one of the supposed targets, French 
President de Gaulle, about the threats against him. Fifty-
eight CIA security officers joined the detail at the funeral, 
along the route of the procession, and at Arlington

Ambassador oy o er. oscow Embassy cable to Secretary of State, EMBTEL 1759, 23 November 1963, HS Files, Job 03-01724R, box 2, folder 
The Soviet Union immediately tried to dispel notions that it was behind the assassination. Less than 15 minutes after Kennedy's death was announced, the TASS news 
service issued a bulletin that rightwing extremists in the United States were responsible. Eastern European stations picked up and spread the story. According to former 
KGB officer Oleg Kalugin, who was stationed in New York at the time, "the Kremlin leadership was clearly rattled by Oswald's Soviet connection." KGB Headquarters 
sent "frantic cables...ordering us to do everything possible" to quell suspicions of Soviet involvement in Kennedy's death. "We were told to put forward the line that 
Oswald could have been involved in a conspiracy with American reactionaries displeased with the President's recent efforts to improve relations with Russia.... [T1he 
message we were to convey was clear: `Inform the American public through every possible channel that we never trusted Oswald and were never in any way connected 
with him." Moscow tried to play down Oswald's tie to the Soviet Union by insinuating that he was a Trotskyite or a Marxist of some undetermined sort, and not a "real" 
communist. Walter Elder recalled thinking that the Soviets' denials were too scripted; "it was almost like they were reading from a manual." Reviewing the early Soviet 
"line" on the assassination a few months later, Agency analysts suggested that "the charge against the extreme right was perhaps a 'conditioned reflex'.... Hoodwinked by 
its own preconceptions and wishful thinking[,] the Kremlin almost inevitably concluQled that President Kennedy had been struck down by his most radical right-wing 
opponents." Other Soviet publications further confused the picture by 'propagating assorted conspiracy theories. Izvestia, the government newspaper, and Red Star, the 
array periodical, speculated that organized crime was involved, while Pravda, the Communist Party organ, and Nedelya, a news magazine, proposed that Oswald was not 
the assassin. Media in satellite countries disseminated those notions also. Oleg Kalugin with Fen Montaigne, The First Directorate, 58; Elder quoted in Evan Thomas,

Cemetery. Later that day, the DCI went to a reception for 
visiting dignitaries hosted by President Johnson at the 
Department of State.lc 
Because of their relationship, McCone had frequent con-
tact with Robert Kennedy during the painful days after the 
assassination. Their communication appears to have been 
verbal, informal, and, evidently in McCone's estimation, 
highly personal; no memoranda or transcripts exist or are 
known to have been made. The DCI no doubt passed on to 
the attorney general the same information about Oswald, 
the Soviet Union, and Cuba that he gave to Johnson and 
other senior administration officials. In addition, because 
Robert Kennedy had overseen the Agency's anti-Castro 
covert actions-including some of the assassination plans-
his dealings with McCone about his brother's murder had a 
special gravity. Did Castro kill the president because the 
president had tried to kill Castro? Had the administration's 
obsession with Cuba inadvertently inspired a politicized 
sociopath to murder John Kennedy? In 1975, according to 
one of the Warren Commission's lawyers, McCone 
said he felt there was something troubling Kennedy 
that he was not disclosing.... McCone said he now 
feels Kennedy may very well have thought that there 
was some connection between the assassination plans 
against Castro and the assassination of President 
Kennedy. He also added his personal belief that Rob-
ert Kennedy had personal feelings of guilt because he 
was directly or indirectly involved with the anti-Cas-
tro planning. 
As head of CIA when much of that planning took place, 
McCone also might have had such feelings. A distraught 
Kennedy even had McCone affirm that the Agency itself 
was not involved in the assassination. When New Orleans 
district attorney Jim Garrison made that allegation in 1967, 
Kennedy was prompted to recall that soon after the assassi-
nation he had asked McCone "if they [the Agency] had 
killed my brother.... I asked him in a way he couldn't lie to 
me, and [he said] they hadn't.' (U) 
Managing CIA's Part in the Investigation (U) 
The FBI took the lead in the federal investigation of Pres-
ident Kennedy's murder. CIA supported the Bureau by 
obtaining information from clandestine and liaison sources 
outside the United States and from foreign contacts inside, 
principally in the Cuban refugee community in Florida. 
The Agency concentrated first on Oswald's activities in 
Mexico City in September and October 1963, and then on 
his residency in the Soviet Union during 1959-62 and his 
possible ties to Soviet intelligence. Within a week, Head-
quarters received about Oswald and for-
warded them to the White House, the FBI, the Department 
of State, and the Secret Service. After 29 November, CIA 
also began assisting the Warren Commission's inquiry.' (U)

Headquarters officers noted in a cable to Mexico City station, "We and other agencies are being flooded by fabrications on the [Oswald] case from several conti-
nents, some originating with people on the fringes of the intelligence business. Such fabrications are not usually done for money, but out of sickly fancy and a desire 
to get into the intelligence game. DIR 85616, 27 November 1963, MORI doc. no. 47629..K

As DCI, McCone's role between the assassination and 
the release of the commission's report 10 months later was, 
in his words, "to see that the investigation and the review of 
the CIA's relationship, if any, with Oswald were thoroughly 
studied and all relevant matters conveyed to the Warren 
Commission." According to Helms, McCone's function was 
"see[ing] to it that sufficient manpower and funds and other 
resources of the Agency were put to work in support of the 
Warren Commission and the FBI." McCone "cer-
tainly...maintained a continuing and abiding interest in 
these proceedings" but turned over daily management of the 
Agency's assassination-related activities to Helms, who kept 
the DCI, the DDCI, and the executive director informed. 
McCone's calendars indicate that after a flurry of meetings 
and discussions during the two weeks following Kennedy's 
death, he settled back into a routine schedule with his usual 
concentration on Intelligence Community affairs and for-
eign policy issues.' 
Helms, in turn, designated the chief of the Mexican 
branch in WH Division, John Whitten, to run CIA's initial 
collection and dissemination efforts, and an officer in the CI 
Staff's Special Investigations Group, Birch O'Neal, to han-
dle liaison with the FBI. After Whitten issued a report in 
December on Oswald's activities in Mexico City, Helms?at 
James Angleton's request, according to Whitten?shifted 
responsibility for Agency support for the FBI and the War-
ren Commission to the CI Staff. Helms did so for three rea-
sons: Whitten's paper was not regarded as quality work; the 
assassination investigation had a counterintelligence ele-
ment; and Angleton's sho provided a tightly controlled 
channel of communication. 
The CI Staff's chief analyst, Raymond Rocca, was the 
Agency's senior point of contact for day-to-day business 
related to the assassination. When needed, other Agency 
officers?notably Helms and the top managers in the SR 
and WH divisions (David Murphy and J.C. King, respec-
tively)?dealt directly 
with the commission 
and the FBI. According 
to Rocca, the CI Staff 
concentrated on Soviet 
leads while WH 
worked the Cuban 
angle. McCone evi-
dently had no problem 
with this bureaucratic 
arrangement or with 
any other part Of 
Helms's management 
of CIA's role. "[I]f he 
had been dissatisfied," 
Helms observed later, 
"he would have made 
his dissatisfaction 
clear[] and I wouldn't 
have forgotten it."13X

Death of the President (U)

The shift of responsibility to the CI Staff also had the 
potential benefit of improving CIA coordination with the 
FBI, which had long dealt with Angleton's unit. Agency-
Bureau relations had grown tense after the assassination 
because of jurisdictional disputes. Early on, McCone tried 
to assure J. Edgar Hoover that the FBI was in charge of the 
investigation and that CIA would be as helpful as it could 
be. In a short telephone conversation on 26 November, the 
DCI took almost every available opportunity to conciliate 
the bureau chief: 
I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this 
Agency is giving you all the help that we possibly can 
in connection with your investigation of the situation 
in Dallas. I know the importance the President places 
on this investigation you are making. He asked me 
personally whether CIA was giving you full support. I

you that you felt so.... [Y]ou can call on us for any-
thing we have.... I think it is an exceedingly impor-
tant investigation and report[,] and I am delighted 
that the President has called on you to make it.'( 
Despite McCone's ingratiating diplomacy and the CI 
Staff's liaison role, relations between the two agencies wors-
ened during the postassassination period. The Bureau's four-
volume report, issued in early December, did not mention 
CIA, referred to just two pieces of information that the 
Agency had provided, and contained much material that 
CIA officers had not seen before but that was germane to 
their own inquiries, such as extensive information on 
Oswald's stay in the Soviet Union. In mid-December, 
Hoover voiced suspicions that McCone had questioned the 
Bureau's investigative abilities and might have leaked derog-
atory information to the press. The FBI director concurred 
with a deputy's recommendation that a "firm and forthright 
confrontation" be held with the DCI for "attack[ing] the 
Bureau in a vicious and underhanded manner characterized 
with sheer dishonesty." Sam Papich, the FBI liaison to CIA, 
met with McCone on 23 December to discuss a private alle-
gation that the Agency was claiming it had uncovered evi-
dence that Oswald was part of a conspiracy?specifically, 
that he had received money in Mexico City in September as 
prepayment for killing John Kennedy. McCone then "had 
endeavored to leave the impression with certain people that 
CIA had developed information not known to the Bureau 
and, in essence, made the Bureau look ridiculous." Accord-
ing to Papich, the DCI became "very visibly incensed and 
left the impression that he might at any moment ask [me] to 
leave." McCone then denied that he had talked to any jour-
nalist about the assassination and had not been critical of 
the FBI's handling of the investigation, but that he had told 
President Johnson about the original report on Oswald in 
Mexico City. The encounter with Papich "left [McCone] in 
an angry mood."' (U) 
That dispute soon was superseded by recurrent problems 
over information sharing between the Agency and the 
Bureau. Not only did "a certain amount of pride of owner-
ship" inhibit CIA-FBI communication, according to 
McCone, but senior Agency officials took issue with the 
Bureau's uncoordinated disclosures of information to the 
public and to the Warren Commission, which became the 
premier entity investigating die Kennedy assassination. In 
December, they were particularly concerned that release of 
the FBI report on the assassination would compromise sen-
sitive CIA surveillance operations against the Soviet embassy 
in Mexico City by revealing that the Agency knew about 
Oswald's visit there. In mid-January 1964, Helms asked 
Hoover to direct his officers not to pass CIA-originated 
information to the commission without first obtaining 
clearance and coordination from Langley. Further animosity 
arose when the two organizations reached opposite conclu-
sions about the bona fides of a KGB defector, Yuri Nosenko, 
who claimed to have seen Oswald's KGB file compiled while 
the American was in the Soviet Union. A disagreement over 
CIA's plan to ask defectors it handled to review FBI infor-
mation was resolved when the Bureau agreed to allow such 
vetting as long as its own sources were protected and the 
Agency did not retain any original reports.' 
Dealing With the Warren Commission (U) 
Meanwhile, McCone and CIA had to work out a modus 
vivendi with the Warren Commission. Lyndon Johnson at 
first opposed creation of a presidential panel to examine the 
killing.' He preferred to let the FBI and Texas law enforce-
ment authorities quietly handle the matter. With rumors

already swirling that some sort of communist, rightwing, or 
underworld plot was involved, he did not want a lengthy, 
public inquiry that might produce explosive "revelations" 
and create pressure on him to act precipitously At most, he 
thought, a Texas-based, Texan-run investigative board 
should be convened.' (U) 
The president changed his mind as the idea of a blue-rib-
bon committee caught on with pundits and politicians after 
Jack Ruby shot Oswald in Dallas police headquarters and 
inspired fears of a broad conspiracy and questions about the 
competence of Texas authorities. Now that Oswald would 
never be brought to trial, Johnson calculated that a presi-
dentially appointed panel of distinguished citizens stood the 
best chance of preempting potentially demagogic state and 
congressional probes that might highlight Oswald's links to 
the Soviets and Cubans, feed other conspiracy theories, or 
reach contradictory conclusions. "This is a question that has 
a good many more ramifications than on the surface," the 
president said, "and we've got to take this out of the arena 
where they're testifying that Khrushchev and Castro did this 
and did that and chuck us into a war that can kill 
40,000,000 Americans in an hour." The public sentiment 
that troubled Johnson was reflected in a Gallup poll taken 
only a week after the assassination; just 29 percent of those 
surveyed believed Oswald had acted alone. (U) 
Accordingly, in Executive Order 11130 issued on 
29 November, Johnson announced the formation of the 
President's Commission on the Assassination of President 
Kennedy. It was a seven-member, bipartisan board compris-
ing the chief justice of the United States, Earl Warren; two 
members each from the Senate and the House of Represen-
tatives, Richard Russell, John Sherman Cooper, Hale Boggs, 
and Gerald Ford; and two prominent former government 
officials, banker-diplomat John McCloy and former DCI 
Allen Dulles. The president later called them "men who 
were known to be beyond pressure and above suspicion." 
"Se?44Th  
Death of the President (U) 
The panel was empowered to conduct a full and indepen-
dent inquiry and enjoyed a broad national mandate. Its 
members saw their function as bringing their collective 
experience and reputations to calm the shaken populace?
or, in McCloy's words, to "lay the dust... [and] show the 
world that America is not a banana republic, where a gov-
ernment can be changed by conspiracy." Other state and 
federal investigations quickly left the scene.' (U) 
During the next several months, the commission went 
about what the chief. justice called "a very sad and solemn 
duty," reviewing reports, requesting information from state 
and federal agencies, staging reconstructions, receiving testi-
mony, and preparing its findings. In September 1964, it 
released an 888-page report; two months later it followed up 
with 26 volumes of supporting transcripts and exhibits. It 
concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin 
and found no evidence that he or his killer, Jack Ruby, were 
part of a domestic or foreign conspiracy. The report?
described by the New York Times as "comprehensive and 
convincing," with its facts "exhaustively gathered, indepen-
dently checked out, and cogently set forth"?had the reas-
suring effect the White House and the commission had 
sought. After its release, 87 percent of the respondents to a 
Gallup poll believed Oswald alone had shot Kennedy.' (U) 
Under McCone's and Helms's direction, CIA supported 
the Warren Commission in a way that may best be described 
as passive, reactive, and selective. In early 1965, McCone 
told the Department of Justice that he had instructed 
Agency officers "to cooperate fully with the President's 
Commission and to withhold nothing from its scrutiny," 
and, through October 1964, CIA provided it with 77 docu-
ments and prepared 38 reports of varying lengths in 
response to its taskings. That cooperation, however, was 
narrower than those numbers might suggest. CIA produced 
information only in response to commission requests?
most of which concerned the Soviet Union or Oswald's 
"Johnson displayed his anxiety over conspiracy rumors on the night after the assassination. White watching NBC's television news broadcast, he started talking back 
to anchormen Chet Huntley and David Brinkley: "Keep talking like that and you'll bring on a revolution just as sure as I'm sitting here." Nancy Dickerson, Among 
Those Present, 96. Senior American diplomats were working to instill calm in both the United States and the Soviet Union. The US ambassador in Moscow, Foy 
Kohler, warned American leaders about "political repercussions which may develop if undue emphasis is placed on the alleged 'Marxism' of Oswald.... I would 
hope, if facts permit, we could deal with the assassin as 'madman' with [a] long record of acts reflecting mental unbalance rather than dwell on his professed political 
convictions." At the same time, Ambassador-at-Large Llewelyn Thompson urged Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Anastas Mikoyan to tone down Soviet rhetoric 
about reactionary capitalists. Pincus and Lardner, "Warren Commission Born Out of Fear," 2; George Lardner Jr., "Papers Shed New Light on Soviets, Oswald,"

activities while he was outside the United States?and did 
not volunteer material even if potentially relevant?for 
example, about Agency plans to assassinate Castro. Helms 
told the House of Representatives' Select Committee on 
Assassinations in 1978 that he "was instructed to reply to 
inquiries from the Warren Commission for information 
from the Agency. I was not asked to initiate any particular 
thing." When queried, "[Tin other words, if you weren't 
asked for it you didn't give it?," Helms replied, "That's 
right."2' (U) 
Examining the assassination in a different political cli-
mate, the Senate's Church Committee concluded in 1976 
that the Agency's inquiry was "deficient" in examining 
Oswald's contacts with pro-Castro and anti-Castro groups 
before the assassination, and that senior CIA officials 
"should have realized" that the Agency's Cuban operations 
"needed to be considered" by the commission. In 1979, the 
House assassinations committee levied a similar criticism: 
"The CIA acted in an exemplary manner in dealing with the 
Warren Commission regarding its narrow requests for infor-
mation. In another area, that of Cuban involvement and 
operations, the CIA's actions might well be described as 
reluctant."' (U) 
Transactions between the Agency and the commission 
were channeled through Helms but were conducted 
between the CI Staff?mainly by Angleton, Rocca, Arthur 
Dooley, and Thomas Hall?and the commission's counsel 
or staff. SR Chief Murphy and his counterintelligence depu-
ties, Tennent Bagley and Lee Wigren, also worked with the 
commission. Requests for information were rarely raised to 
the DDP or DCI level. Helms met with commission per-
sonnel only five times between January and June 1964. This 
limited degree of high-level communication resulted largely 
because most of the commissioners, with whom McCone 
would have dealt for protocol reasons, did not participate 
much in the investigation and left most of the work to staff-
ers. No documentary evidence indicates whether McCone 
ordered the circumscribed approach on his own or at the 
White House's behest, but DDCI Carter has recalled that 
McCone said he would "handle the whole [commission] 
business myself, directly"?including, presumably, establish-
ing, or at least ratifying, the chain of command and degree 
of responsiveness. Moreover, the DCI shared the adminis-
tration's interest in avoiding disclosures about covert actions 
that would circumstantially implicate CIA in conspiracy 
theories, and possibly lead to calls for a tough US response 
against the perpetrators of the assassination. If the commis-
sion did not know to ask about covert operations against 
Cuba, he was not going to give them any suggestions about 
where to look."... 
McCone himself had few personal dealings with commis-
sion members or staffers before he testified to the panel in 
mid-May 1964. In December 1963, he discussed with Sen. 
Russell the Nicaraguan walk-in to the US embassy in Mex-
ico City who proved to be a fabricator. In January 1964, at 
McCloy's request, he wrote to President Johnson and sug-
gested he encourage Chief Justice Warren to speed up the 
commission's pace. In April, he gave some commission 
members and staffers a tour of the facilities at Headquarters 
where assassination-related information was retrieved, 
stored, and microfilmed, and he demonstrated the proce-
dures the Agency followed in responding to commission 
requests. The DCI later said the chief justice seemed "quite 
satisfied" with what he saw. In May, McCone discussed with 
Warren and McCloy the need for the commission to refute 
conspiracy theories even if doing so gave them unwarranted 
publicity. "If your report doesn't dispose of it [the "second 
gunman" scenario] point by point, your report is a white-
wash," he warned McCloy. Also in May, the DCI discussed 
his upcoming testimony before the commission with its 
general counsel, J. Lee Rankin. Rankin told him the subjects

One reason for all this attention to con-
spiratorialists was that the ideas of one of the 
earliest of them, Thomas Buchanan, were cir-
culating widely by the time McCone testified 
to the commission. Buchanan, an expatriate 
American communist and former reporter 
for the Washington Evening Star, had pub-
lished articles in the French periodical 
lapress and produced a book, Who Killed 
Kennedy?, based on them in May 1964. The 
book's thesis, which anticipated many criti-
cisms of the commission's findings, con-
tended that a second gunman had fired on 
Kennedy from the Grassy Knoll because the 
windshield of the presidential car had a small 
hole in it. Only that scenario, Buchanan 
argued, would explain the anomalies regarding the bullets' 
paths, the timing and locations of the wounds on Kennedy 
and Texas Governor John Connally, and the contradictions 
between the emergency staff at Parkland Hospital in Dallas 
and the doctors who performed the autopsy on the presi-
dent's body at Bethesda Naval Medical Center. USIA and 
the Department of State worried about the wide circulation 
Buchanan's assertions had received in the foreign press. A 
mutual friend of the DCI and the chief justice, Fleur 
Cowles Montague-Meyers, lived in England and had 
warned McCone that Buchanan was effectively making his 
case for a rightwing conspiracy on British radio and televi-
sion shows. McCone arranged for Warren to talk to her so 
the chief justice could best position the commission to 
respond to Buchanan's charges.'N'

McCone does not appear to have had any explicit, special 
understanding with Allen Dulles, the commission member 
who worked closest with CIA, that aided the former DCI in 
steering the inquiry away from controversial Agency opera-
tions. McCone later denied that Dulles was the Intelligence 
Community's protector on the commission, and the latter 
declined a suggestion from the panel's head lawyer that he 
?`serve as CIA file reviewer" for the commission. Dulles did, 
however, advise Agency officers of the questions his fellow 
commissioners most likely would ask. As the only commis-
sion member who knew about the Agency's "executive 
action" operations, Dulles seems to have taken on this pro-
prietary responsibility himself. (It is not known if he told 
any commissioners in private about CIA's plots to kill Cas-
tro.) He worked through Helms, Rocca, Murphy, and other

Agency officers and, as was the case with other commission-
ers and staffers, did not need to deal with McCone 
directly.' The DCI's calendars and logs of meetings and 
telephone conversations for the period the commission 
existed do not show any contacts with Dulles, and McCone 
recalled talking to Dulles "very infrequently" during that 
time?perhaps mainly at social functions of the capital elite 
that they frequently attended. The two men "were not on 
the best of terms" then, according to Angleton. Their per-
sonal relations notwithstanding, McCone and Dulles both 
wanted to draw the commission's attention away from CIA 
and encourage endorsement of the FBI's conclusion soon 
after the assassination that a lone gunman, uninvolved in a 
conspiracy, had killed John Kennedy. The DCI could rest 
assured that his predecessor would keep a dutiful watch over 
Agency equities and work to keep the commission from 
pursuing provocative lines of investigation, such as lethal 
anti-Castro covert actions.". 
McCone and Helms spent about two hours before the 
commission on 14 May 1964. They answered questions 
about the Agency's information on Oswald, and evidence of 
a conspiracy behind the assassination, including Soviet or 
Cuban involvement. The DCI testified that 
[w]e had knowledge of him [Oswald], of course, 
because of his having gone to the Soviet Union.. .put-
ting him in a situation where his name would appear 
in our name file. However...Lee Harvey Oswald was 
not an agent, employee, or informant of the Central 
Intelligence Agency. The Agency never contacted him, 
interviewed him, talked with him, or received or solic-
ited any reports or information from him, or commu-
nicated with him directly or in any other manner. The 
Agency never furnished him with any funds or money 
or compensated him directly or indirectly in any fash-
ion, and Lee Harvey Oswald was never associated or 
connected directly or indirectly in any way whatsoever 
with the Agency.' (U) 
Although literally true, McCone's statement was incom-
plete. A former CIA employee, who worked in the Foreign 
Documents Division of the Soviet component of the DI, 
told the House assassinations committee in 1978 that in 
1962 he reviewed a report on the Minsk electronics plant 
where Oswald worked while in the Soviet Union. The 
report, according to the officer, came from CINs 
field office and was sourced to a former Marine who had 
defected and was employed at the plant. The record does 
not indicate if McCone knew of this report and its sourcing 
chain and chose not to tell the Warren Commission (pre-
sumably to conceal an embarrassing but, in the context of 
the assassination itself, irrelevant link between the Agency 
and Oswald); if witting CIA officers did not tell him about 
it (possibly for the same reasons); or if it was forgotten, not 
located, or not connected to Oswald.29. 
26 Dulles had several contacts with the Agency soon after the commission was set up. By mid-December 1963, he had asked the DI for a summary of world reaction to 
the assassination, requested an Agency secretary, sought advice from Lawrence Houston on the selection of the commission's lawyers, and spoken to the Office of Medi-
cal Services about Oswald's psychological condition. In January 1964, Dulles?apparently provoked by press criticism that the commission had been slow to get started, 
according to Angleton?asked CIA to suggest questions to be included in an official letter to the Soviet government. Knoche memorandum about DCI morning staff

the DCI testified to the COMMISSI011, Agency and Bureau officers reviewed J. Edgar Hoover's testimony and possible statements by McCone to ensure that there were 
no conflicts between the two directors' positions. CIA officers also prepared a briefing paper for McCone. The paper included guidance on assuring the commission 
that the Agency had disclosed all information it had on Oswald, and that allegations of CIA ties to Oswald probably were Soviet-sponsored disinformation. The 
DCI also was advised that, to protect sources and methods, he should not answer on-the-record questions about Oswald's activities in Mexico. The commission's 
chief counsel and a few staffers already had received such information "on a highly restricted basis." Church Committee JFK Assassination Report, 46-49; "Briefing for

band's death. In February, following accusations from Marguerite Oswald that CIA had "set up [her son] to take the blame" for the assassination, McCone stated 
publicly that Oswald "was never directly or indirectly connected with CIA." Washinaton Evenino Star 13 February 1964 Oswald clionini, file HIC (U)

In addition, the Agency had acquired information "from" 
Oswald without his knowledge through CI Staff's mail-cover 
and mail-opening program, codenamed HTLINGUAL. As 
noted in Chapter 12, McCone may not have been aware of 
that project before the assassination, but insofar as Oswald 
had been on the target list (because of his former defector 
status), it would be surprising if the DCI were not told about 
the program after 22 November. If not, his subordinates 
deceived him; if he did know about HTLINGUAL reporting 
on Oswald, he was not being forthright with the commis-
sion?presumably to protect an operation that was highly 
compartmented and, if disclosed, sure to arouse much con-
troversy. Moreover, no information in Oswald's correspon-
dence suggested he was a threat to the president, so the 
commission had no "need to know" about it.' (U) 
On a possible Soviet or Cuban role in the assassination, 
McCone told the commission: 
I have no information.., that would lead me to believe 
or conclude that a conspiracy existed.... We made an 
investigation of all developments after the assassina-
tion which came to our attention which might possi-
bly have indicated a conspiracy, and we determined 
after these investigations, which were made promptly 
and immediately, that we had no evidence to support 
such an assumption. 
McCone said the Agency had investigated Oswald's trip to 
Mexico City but found no evidence he had a relationship 
with Soviet intelligence or the Cuban government, or that 
his travel was related to the assassination. The DCI's state-
ments about Oswald and the KGB were based in part on SR 
Division's conclusion in December 1963 that Oswald was 
-rAr.z/ 
Death of the President (U) 
not a Soviet assassin. That report stated that although there 
were "several rather fascinating inconsistencies, loose ends, 
and unanswered questions about Oswald," his extensive 
pro-Castro activity and contact with the Soviet embassy in 
Mexico City violated a longstanding KGB prohibition on its 
overseas agents having contact with domestic communist 
parties or Soviet legations. Furthermore, there was no evi-
dence that the KGB had selected and specially trained 
Oswald for an "executive action" mission, as was its standard 
practice.' (U) 
After the full extent of CIA's regime-change operations in 
Cuba was revealed during the 1970s, congressional and 
journalistic attention focused more on what McCone and 
the Agency had not told the Warren Commission?particu-
larly about the plots to kill Castro. To many observers, and 
some CIA officers as well, these activities clearly seemed rel-
evant to the Kennedy assassination and to the commission's 
investigation, yet in 1964 Agency officials concluded that 
they were not. When the House committee asked McCone 
in 1978 if CIA had withheld from the commission informa-
tion about the Agency's plots to kill Castro to avoid embar-
rassment or an international crisis, McCone replied: "I 
cannot answer that since they (CIA employees knowledge-
able of the continuance of such plots) withheld the informa-
tion from me. I cannot answer that question. I have never 
been satisfied as to why they withheld the information from 
me." He said he assumed Dulles, who was DCI when the 
plots originated, would have told the commission about 
them. When asked if the Agency had provided the commis-
sion with information about covert action, McCone replied 
in the negative, stating that a "public commission" could not 
receive such material.'..<

Soon after the commission released its report, two American journalists who often wrote "investigative" articles on intelligence affairs, Robert S. Allen and Paul 
Scott, accused CIA of deception for not turning over to the commission a "national intelligence estimate warning that it is Kremlin policy to remove from public 
office by assassination Western officials who actively oppose Soviet policies." Allen and Scott were both right and wrong. The "estimate" actually was an interim 
study called "Soviet Strategic Executive Action" produced in October 1961. The Agency did not give it to the commission and instead provided a more detailed and 
more current product, "Soviet Use of Assassination and Kidnapping," dated February 1964. The Office of Security investigated the leak to Allen and Scott and 
reported to McCone that although the news story was "a serious compromise of a highly sensitive document.., damage to clandestine sources and methods would be 
nominal." In response to an Agency query, a Warren Commission lawyer said "no one [there] was excited about the Allen-Scott ?iece and to forget it." Robert S.

McCone's answer was neither frank nor accurate. By the 
time he testified to the commission in May 1964, he had 
known about the Mafia plots to kill Castro for nine months, 
but he chose not to mention them. (As indicated earlier, it is 
unclear whether he ever knew about the AMLASH assassi-
nation operation.) Moreover, McCone's reference to the 
commission about "an investigation of all developments 
after the assassination which came to our attention which 
might possibly have indicated a conspiracy" (emphasis 
added) precluded providing details about earlier covert 
actions that might have seemed pertinent.' (U) 
McCone judged that he should defer to the DDP's 
assessment that the plots to kill Castro had no bearing on 
the Kennedy assassination, and?consistent with the 
Agency policy of only giving information on request and the 
"need to know" principle?did not tell the commission 
about them. In his mind, the evidence showed Oswald was 
guilty, and the national interest would not be served by fas-
cinating but fruitless examinations of unrelated covert activ-
ities. Principles of plausible deniability and compartmen-
tation would be violated; ongoing operations would be 
compromised; and sensitive sources and methods would be 
revealed. Publicity about the US government's regime-
change efforts in Cuba would give the communists an 
unprecedented propaganda windfall that they could exploit 
for years and probably would have evoked strong condem-
nation from the international community. By withholding 
information on "executive action," the DCI could preserve 
Agency equities and avoid leading the Warren Commission 
toward a false conclusion about Oswald and Cuba.' (U) 
McCone's reasoning fit into the consensus that had 
quickly developed in the highest levels of the US govern-
ment after the assassination that the public needed to be 
convinced that Oswald was the lone gunman and that an 
international or extremist conspiracy had not killed an 
American president. As Deputy Attorney General Nicholas 
Katzenbach wrote to presidential assistant Bill Moyers on 
26 November: 
The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the 
assassin; that he did not have confederates who are 
still at large.... Speculation about Oswald's motiva-
tion ought to be cut off, and we should have some 
basis for rebutting the thought that this was a Com-
munist conspiracy or (as the Iron Curtain press is say-
ing) a right-wing conspiracy to blame it on the 
Communists.... We need something to head off pub-
lic speculation or Congressional hearings of the wrong 
sort." (U) 
McCone was convinced that neither the Cubans nor the 
Soviets had sought revenge against John Kennedy, largely 
because SIGINT had disclosed the stunned reactions of 
Cuban and Soviet leaders to Kennedy's death. ("They were 
frightened, and we knew that," a commission staffer 
remarked afterward.)' Once he concluded that Oswald had 
no current connection with Moscow or Havana?and he 
did not believe the commission needed to know how that 
determination was made?McCone presumably saw no rea-
son to raise what he regarded as peripheral, distracting, and 
unsettling subjects like plots to kill Castro. (U) 
However defensible the DCI's rationale might have 
seemed in 1964, it came under harsh criticism later. In 
1976, the Church Committee concluded that "concern with 
public reputation.. possible bureaucratic failure and embar-
rassment...the extreme compartmentation of knowledge of 
sensitive operations... [and] conscious decisions [by senior 
CIA officials] not to disclose potentially important informa-
tion" kept the commission from knowing all it should have. 
According to the House assassinations committee in 1978, 
the commission "failed to investigate adequately the possi-
bility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President," in part 
OIG, "Report on Plots to Assassinate Fidel Castro," MORI doc. no. 334698, 69-70. The Agency personnel assigned by Helms to assist the commission were not 
witting of the AMLASH operation. Officers of the DDP's Special Affairs Staff who knew of the assassination plots were never in touch with the commission. The 
House assassinations committee concluded that "the only person who knew of these plots and was in contact with the Warren Commission was Richard Helms." 
HSCA Hearings, vol. 11, 58, 67; HSCA Report, 4, 253. (U) 
34Angleton, however, told the House assassinations committee in 1978 that the Intelligence Community "did not have the capabilities" in 1963-64?such as "a 
code break or a defector?to determine whether or not Cuba was involved. "Top Spy's Testimony on Murder of JFK," Newsday, 20 June 1997, A3. (U) 
"Church Committee JFK Assassination Report, 23. Critics of the Warren Commission often have cited Katzenbach's memorandum as proof of a high-level effort, in 
assassination scholar Max Holland's words, to "put the machinery of government into gear to make the lone-deranged assassin story a convincing one" and reach "a 
pre-cooked verdict." More plausibly, however, Katzenbach?who has acknowledged that his language was less than artful?"advocated a process that would put 
rumor and speculation to rest, because [after Oswald's death] a purgative trial had been rendered impossible." Max Holland, "The Docudrama That Is JFK,"

because of the limited way the Agency cooperated with it.' 
In the long term, the decision of McCone and Agency lead-
ers in 1964 not to disclose information about CIA's anti-
Castro schemes might have done more to undermine the 
credibility of the commission than anything else that hap-
pened while it was conducting its investigation. At the time, 
however, McCone felt the need for clarity and closure all the 
more acutely because while the commission was going about 
its business, CIA and the FBI were feuding over a sensa-
tional counterintelligence case whose outcome could have 
destroyed the consoling sense of finality that the DCI and 
other US leaders were working so hard to fashion. (U) 
The Nosenko Incubus (U) 
No counterintelligence matter of McCone's tenure was so 
fraught with potential for conflict as the defection of KGB 
officer Yuri Nosenko in early 1964 and the ensuing contro-
versy over his bona fides. By claiming to know about the 
KGB's dealings with Oswald, and by extension a Soviet role 
in the Kennedy assassination, Nosenko became potentially 
the most important defector in history. The conclusions of 
several senior operations officers that Nosenko was a disin-
formation agent led McCone to approve Nosenko's deten-
tion and hostile interrogation, beginning a protracted, 
much-debated, and ultimately futile three-and-a-half-year 
effort to "break" him. The harsh treatment of the seemingly 
valuable intelligence source is only explainable by CIA sus-
picions that Nosenko was lying when he said the Soviets 
were not involved in killing Kennedy. "That made the 
Nosenko case so extraordinary and so different from all the 
others," Richard Helms has said. "Otherwise, we wouldn't 
have done all the things we ended up doing." Moreover, 
McCone's relationship with Robert Kennedy assured that 
the DCI would be responsive to the attorney general's urg-
ing that the Agency learn the truth about Nosenko and 
Oswald, and perhaps ren-
dered him even more 
inclined than usual to let 
the professionals in the 
DDP do what they thought 
was necessary to answer the 
crucial question: Did Mos-
cow order the murder of the 
president? An affirmative 
answer could have been a 
casus belli for the United 
States.' (U) 
When he first contacted 
CIA in Geneva in June Yuri Nosenko (U) 
1962 during a disarmament 
conference, Nosenko was a mid-level officer in the KGB's 
Second Chief Directorate, which was responsible for coun-
terintelligence and security. He was the Agency's first source 
on the structure and personnel of the directorate to have 
actually worked in it. He provided useful leads about Soviet 
agent and technical operations against US and British tar-
gets inside and outside the Soviet Union, agreed to work as 
an agent in place, and said he would reestablish contact the 
next time he was in the West. In late January 1964, 
Nosenko returned to Geneva and met with CIA officers. 
When asked if he knew about any Soviet role in the assassi-
nation, he claimed to have been the KGB officer assigned to 
Oswald's case when the American defected to the USSR in 
1959. According to Nosenko, the KGB had decided Oswald 
was unstable and unintelligent and declined to have any-
thing to do with him. Furthermore, Nosenko said, he had 
participated in Oswald's application for a visa to return to 
Russia in 1963, and he had been assigned to review 
Oswald's file after the assassination. If Nosenko was telling 
the truth, his information would dispel suspicions that Mos-
cow had some part in President Kennedy's murder. Nosenko

Nosenko was not the only communist bloc defector to come to the United States soon after the Kennedy assassination with information about Oswald that seemed 
to exculpate a US adversary. In early May 1964, a "well-placed" Cuban "in close and prolonged contact with ranking officers" of Castro's intelligence service reported 
that Oswald had been in touch with Cuban operatives "before, during, and after" he visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City in late September and 
early October 1963. The defector?codenamed AMMUG/1 and described as "very reliable" and "highly sensitive?did not know specifically whether the Cuban 
government had used Oswald in any capacity, but his reporting about the surprise with which Castro and Cuban intelligence officers reacted to news of the assassi-
nation indicated that Havana was not involved in it. CIA passed on the defector's information to the Warren Commission in mid-May. A commission staffer 
remarked that the panel "was winding up its investigation" and "saw no need to pursue this [Cuban] angle any further." Unlike Nosenko, AMMUG/1 was deemed 
bona fide?"an operational gold mine," according to Raymond Rocca. CIA blind memorandum, "... Debriefing of Cuban Source.. OSWALD Case," 5 May 1964,

also told his Agency contacts that he wanted to defect. In 
early February 1964, after he said he had been recalled to 
Moscow, he was exfiltrated to West Germany. A week after 
his arrival, McCone ordered Nosenko brought to Washing-

Between Nosenko's two encounters with CIA, however, 
serious doubts about his bona fides had arisen in SR Divi-
sion and CI Staff and extensive questioning following his 
defection seemed to support those suspicions.' Some of 
Nosenko's leads could be regarded as "giveaways" or "feed 
material" because CIA and the FBI already knew about 
them or because the cases were inactive or low-grade; 
Nosenko gave inconsistent or inaccurate descriptions of his 
personal history; anomalies in his information about the 
KGB were identified; he provided what seemed to be "pat" 
information on subjects he had no reason to know about, 
while claiming to be unfamiliar with topics he should have 
known about; and he did not show what was regarded as a 
defector's "normal" concern for his family and his future.' 
His contention that Soviet intelligence had had no opera-
tional interest in Oswald seemed implausible, considering 
the American had been stationed at an airbase in Japan 
involved in U-2 missions. Oswald's comfortable living con-
ditions in Minsk, his marriage to the niece of a Soviet army 
intelligence officer, and the circumstances of his return to 
the United States could be interpreted as suggesting that he 
had ties to the KGB. None of Nosenko's information about 
Oswald and the KGB could be confirmed independently; 
nor would Nosenko, a counterintelligence officer, necessar-
ily be able to say without reservation whether the KGB's for-
eign intelligence component had or had not recruited a 
particular individual. Also, it appeared too serendipitous 
that of all the thousands of KGB officers in the world, one 
who had had direct contact with the Oswald case three sepa-
rate times would seek to defect so soon after the assassina-
tion with information exonerating Moscow. 
Perhaps the most important factor in the Agency's think-
ing was the claim of an earlier defector, Anatoliy Golitsyn, 
that Moscow would send provocateurs to discredit him and 
divert attention from the search for moles inside CIA and 
other Western services. Golitsyn had labeled Nosenko as a 
disinformation agent in 1962, and James Angleton, David 
Murphy, and Nosenko's case officer, Tennent Bagley?who 
at first thought Nosenko was genuine?agreed. Nosenko's 
reappearance 19 months later had potentially monumental 
consequences. With the United States still suffering from a 
national trauma, the Warren Commission inquiry underway, 
and the Cuban missile crisis barely a year old, the Agency 
had to determine whether the KGB had dispatched a false 
defector to hide the fact that Oswald was a Soviet-sponsored 
killer. As Helms testified in 1978, "[i]f it were shown that 
Oswald was.. acting as a Soviet agent when he shot President 
Kennedy, the consequences to the United States...and...to 
the world, would have been staggering.") 
McCone's deputies kept him apprised of the Nosenko 
case from the day in early February 1964 when the KGB 
officer said he had been recalled to Moscow.' The DCI, in 
turn, passed on news of developments to the White 
House?especially to Robert Kennedy, who, according to 
Helms, was the driving force outside the Agency behind the 
decisions to extract the truth from Nosenko. From the first,

that out of 157 cases (63 concerning US citizens and 94 involving foreigners), 104 (52 in each category) were already known or suspected, unproductive or not yet

McCone received essentially all evaluations of Nosenko's 
bona fides from skeptics, including ADDP Thomas 
Karamessines, Angleton, Murphy, and Golitsyn, but he 
appears initially to have tried to keep an open mind. Possi-
bly he took early warnings about Nosenko as a standard 
caveat about any defector. In mid-February, he told Rusk he 
was inclined to believe Nosenko. After hearing about the 
results of further questioning, however, the DCI told the 
president that "the Soviet's performance and action were so 
different from any other defector case that our suspicions 
had been aroused."43A 
The breadth of Golitsyn's information about Soviet intel-
ligence activities and CIA officers' faith in it added to 
Nosenko's difficulty in establishing his veracity. McCone, 
Helms, Angleton, and SR Division managers thought the 
balance weighed heavily in Golitsyn's favor. Even without 
his information about Oswald, Nosenko would have had a 
hard time proving himself. Contributing to McCone's 
uncertainty was Hoover's conclusion?based largely on a 
trusted KGB source (codenamed FEDORA) the FBI had at 
the United Nations and the Bureau's own interviews with 
Nosenko?by early March that Nosenko's information was 
"valid and valuable" and that he was a genuine defector. 
Angleton, however, thought FEDORA was a plant because 
he corroborated supposedly inaccurate information from 
Nosenko and therefore must be part of the same deception. 
At about the same time, in early March, McCone and CIA 
felt pressure from the Warren Commission after Hoover 
unilaterally revealed to the commission what the defector 
had said about Oswald?which supported the Bureau's con-
clusion that he was a deranged killer acting alone. With the 
DCI's permission, Helms told the commission that the 
Agency had serious reservations about Nosenko and asked it 
to "await further developments."44.Nr 
To resolve the uncertainty about Nosenko, McCone in 
early April 1964 accepted the recommendations of Helms, 
Angleton, and Murphy that the defector be confined and 
interrogated until broken. (Agency officers had suspended 
informational debriefings of Nosenko a month before.) CIA 
Lareftsii;i 
Death of the President (U) 
detained Nosenko under the terms of an "exclusion and 
parole" agreement with the Department of Justice executed 
in 1955. The agreement gave the Agency authority to exer-
cise over defectors "control of a kind and degree it believes 
consistent with the internal security needs of the United 
States." The documentary record does not indicate what 
McCone knew about the austere conditions of Nosenko's 
year-long detention at an Agency safehouse 
. (Twelve of the 16 months of the Russian's con-
finement there were during McCone's tenure.) Helms does 
not recall that McCone ever asked for details of the inquiry, 
and the DCI does not appear to have been fully aware of 
much of the dubious logic and inappropriate pro-
cedures upon which the case against Nosenko rested. 
Assured by his senior operations and legal officers that the 
Agency was handling Nosenko lawfully and in ways they 
believed stood the best chance of revealing the truth, 
McCone let the hostile interrogation run its course. There is 
no reason to doubt that he would have accepted then the 
argument Helms made to congressional investigators a 
decade-and-a-half later to justify the severe treatment of 
Nosenko: 
[T]his became one of the most difficult issues... that 
the Agency had ever faced. Here a President of the 
United States had been murdered and a man had come 
from the Soviet Union, an acknowledged Soviet intelli-
gence officer, and said his intelligence service had never 
been in touch with this man [Oswald] and knew noth-
ing about him. This strained credulity at the time. It 
strains it to this day.... You are damned if you hold a 
fellow too long and treat him badly.. .and you are 
damned the other way if you have not dug his teeth 
out to find out what he knows about Oswald.45 
McCone soon received further impressions about Nosenko 
from the FBI and Golitsyn that reinforced his approval for 
having the defector interrogated. In May 1964, the FBI's liai-
son officer to the Agency, Sam Papich, told McCone that 
some Bureau officials "are very much concerned and recog-
nize that [Nosenko] could be a plant." "[H]is story has held

up-but the cases are peanuts-no real significance. The 
other leads that he gave us-many of them were known to 
us.... [The Soviets] have not suffered at all by what he's given 
us." McCone told Papich that CIA would not decide on 
Nosenko one way or the other unless the Bureau agreed with 
its judgment. In June, Golitsyn-after reading files on 
Nosenko and listening to tapes of his debriefings-reaffirmed 
his prior assessment that Nosenko was a false defector." In 
July, Golitsyn told the DCI that he disputed Nosenko's expla-
nation of GRU asset Pyotr Popov's arrest in 1959. Nosenko 
said KGB security caught a CIA officer mailing a letter to 
Popov. Golitsyn insisted, however, that Nosenko's account 
was intended to divert the Agency from the penetration agent 
who had tipped off the Soviets.' 
The Warren Commission's patience with the Agency over 
Nosenko had worn thin by mid-June, when it asked 
McCone for a definitive assessment of Nosenko's credibility. 
McCone had Helms tell Chief Justice Warren that CIA 
thought Nosenko might be a dispatched agent and to advise 
the commission that his information should be suppressed. 
One important concern the Agency had was the embarrass-
ment that would result if the commission's report included 
material from a source later shown to be a controlled Soviet 
agent. Warren later told McCone that the commission had 
accepted CIA's advice. In addition, at least three times in 
July, Agency officers (including Helms, Murphy, and Bag-
ley) told the commission that Nosenko might be a KGB 
plant. Those sessions settled the question; the FBI's debrief-
ings of Nosenko remained closed in the commission's files 
and did not contribute to its conciusions.48XL 
During the last 12 months of McCone's directorship, 
CIA officers subjected Nosenko to at least 160 hours of hos-
tile interrogation and an untallied amount of what was 
termed "neutral" questioning. According to Helms, the DCI 
did not follow the case closely at this stage but expected to 
be informed of major developments. Otherwise, once the 
Warren Commission formally concluded that Oswald had 
acted alone, McCone showed no further interest in pursuing 
the Nosenko aspect of the assassination.49., 
Meanwhile, the case remained unbroken. In January 
1965, CIA determined that Nosenko-who had not 
changed his story about Oswald and the KGB-was being 
deceptive but still could not ascertain why. When McCone 
left Langley, the Office of Security had nearly completed 
preparations for placing Nosenko in a specially built deten-
tion facility 
The USIB Executive Committee approved this phase of the 
Agency's handling of Nosenko, although it was not given 
details of the defector's treatment. There is no record that

McCone knew or asked about the mechanics of this much 
more grueling (and ultimately fruitless) phase of the investi-
ga tio 
As journalist David Wise pointed out in the late 1970s, 
there were several permutations to the question of Nosenko's 
authenticity, most of which were not considered by 
McCone or any senior Agency officer after the Kennedy 
assassination.' First, as conventional wisdom at CIA ran 
until the late 1960s, Nosenko could have been a false defec-
tor with a false story about Oswald and the KGB. Second, 
Nosenko might have been a real defector who had made up 
a story about Oswald to make himself a "bigger catch." The 
inaccuracies and exaggerations in his story were reevaluated 
later as consistent with the penchant of defectors to embel-
lish their biographies, access, and knowledge. (U) 
Third, Nosenko could have been a genuine defector with 
accurate information. The FBI believed Nosenko in 1964, 
and CIA concluded a few years later that his information 
about Oswald was accurate. Lastly, Nosenko might have 
been a controlled agent sent to the United States to report 
truthfully that the Soviets had nothing to do with Oswald or 
the assassination. Moscow miscalculated, however, in think-
ing the US government would find that story more believ-
able if it came through clandestine channels from a 
"defector" with an attractive resume. (U) 
As DCI, McCone never freed himself from the "zero 
sum" paradigm to which SR Division and CI Staff were 
wedded: Golitsyn was good, so Nosenko must be bad. The 
"stsg,zzi,  
Death of the President (U) 
empirically-minded McCone judged that enough facts 
existed to support that deceptively simple conclusion. As in 
other counterintelligence matters?an area in which he did 
not display much intellectual creativity?he deferred to 
trusted deputies. In 1978, McCone told the House assassi-
nations committee that he thought Nosenko was bona fide 
after all. He did not say what led him to that conclusion, 
but he may have been reflecting the Agency's revised view of 
Nosenko.52 Reliable KGB information shows that both 
defectors were genuine?an apparently elementary conclu-
sion that intellectual rigidity and bureaucratic obstinacy 
kept McCone and a significant number of senior Agency 
officers from reaching."* 
Loose Ends (U) 
In late September 1964, President Johnson appointed 
McCone to a four-man committee to advise on implement-
ing the Warren Commission's recommendations for improv-
ing presidential security. The commission had proposed that 
an assassination attempt, an assault against, or kidnapping 
of a president or vice president should constitute a federal 
crime; that a cabinet-level committee or the NSC assume 
the responsibility of reviewing and overseeing presidential 
protection programs; that the FBI and the Secret Service 
improve their investigative and intelligence capabilities; and 
that interagency cooperation and information sharing on 
security matters be promoted. Others on the presidential 
committee were C. Douglas Dillon, the secretary of the trea-
sury, who served as chairman; Nicholas Katzenbach, the

Nosenko was held rom August 1965 until October 1967, when, at DDCI Rufus Taylor's direction, the Office of Security (OS) took over his case. 
OS officer Bruce Solie handled the "clean slate" investigation. Using an analytical methodology that tended to explain away inconsistencies and inaccuracies in 
Nosenko's story?the converse of the approach that SR Division and CI Staff had taken?Solie concluded that Nosenko's detractors had not proven their argument. 
("Hit is not considered that based on all available information a conclusion that Nosenko is or is not a bona fide defector can be incontrovertibly substantiated at this 
time.") Nosenko was then released under supervision, resettled, compensated, and hired as a contractor. [Bruce Solie,] "Yuri Ivanovich NOSENKO," OS 801441/A,

acting attorney general; and McGeorge Bundy, the presi-
dent's national security adviser. Each member had an assis-
tant from his agency to do the staff-level work; McCone's 
aide was DDP officer John Mertz.% (U) 
The Dillon Committee met seven times through the fall 
and winter and held discussions with J. Edgar Hoover, 
James Rowley, the chief of the Secret Service, and Kermit 
Gordon, head of the Bureau of the Budget. The DCI 
attended only four of the meetings but took an active part in 
the deliberations when he did. He suggested that a presiden-
tial assassination statute contain an "informer clause" similar 
to those in other federal criminal laws; he thought a high-
level interdepartmental standing group should be estab-
lished to periodically review presidential protection; and he 
regarded surveys of buildings at sites of scheduled presiden-
tial visits as "tremendously wasteful" uses of manpower. As 
when he testified before the Warren Commission, McCone 
again pressed for federal agencies to make greater use of 
what was then called "automated data processing" technol-
ogy to collate information on presidential security. He 
brushed aside objections that returning Rowley to his previ-
ous job as head of the Secret Service's White House detail 
would cause personal and public relations difficulties. "The 
best approach would be to select the best available man as 
Chief of the Secret Service, after which Mr. Rowley would 
be required to 'fall into line' or otherwise become a casu-
alty." McCone recommended Michael J. Murphy, Commis-
sioner of the New York City Police Department, to either 
replace Rowley or assume a new White House position 
supervising the service.' (U) 
The Dillon Committee reported to President Johnson in 
late January 1965 and released a version of its findings to 
the public in early February (as intended, it had completed 
its work in time for the next session of Congress to consider 
its recommendations). Contrary to the Warren Commis-
sion, McCone and his fellow members concluded that the 
Secret Service should retain primary responsibility for presi-
dential protection and remain in the Department of the 
Treasury. Despite President Johnson's decision not to 
support any increase in the Secret Service budget?in keep-
ing with his government-wide economy drive?the com-
mittee called for a 57 percent increase in service personnel, 
improved training, and augmented resources. The members 
also encouraged the White House to seek legislation prohib-
iting shipments of firearms in interstate commerce except 
between federally licensed dealers or manufacturers. In other 
areas, the committee echoed Warren Commission proposals, 
calling for a federal assassination and kidnapping statute 
(with an informer rewards provision) covering the president 
and vice president; expansion of Secret Service agents' inves-
tigative and arrest powers; establishment of a cabinet-level 
group to oversee presidential protection; and improved 
cooperation among federal agencies and with state and local 
law enforcement departments. Several of the recommenda-
tions that McCone and his fellow committeemen made 
were soon adopted.% (U) 
One of McCone's missions as DCI was to keep CIA out 
of operational controversies, so it is ironic that, as a private 
citizen, he later gave information to the House assassina-
tions committee that rekindled charges that the Agency had 
hidden its supposed clandestine relationship with Oswald. 
In May 1977, columnist Jack Anderson (citing the commit-
tee's files) wrote that Antonio Veciana, in the 1960s a mem-

complement of agents was expanded 50 percent to 600; and its overall staffing was increased by over half to 920. Serving under the renamed director (the title 
"chief" was abandoned as archaic) were four new assistant directors, including one in charge of all protective security details, and another responsible for intelligence 
affairs. Servicing the latter was an overhauled, expanded, and automated research bureau that shared information with CIA, the FBI, and other government entities

described in an internal report as "a mixture of some fact 
and a great deal of fiction," did not hold up. A review of 
CIA records found no reference to Maurice (or Morris) 
Bishop as a true name, pseudonym, or alias; the Agency 
never supported Alpha 66; and Veciana was registered as a 
contact of the US Army, not the Agency.' (U) 
The House committee picked up the Bishop "lead" and 
questioned McCone about it in August 1978. McCone 
recalled a "Maurice Bishop" and believed the man was an 
Agency employee, but did not know where he worked or 
what his duties were. CIA management became concerned 
that the former DCI's statement, even though in context 
offhand and imprecise, would call the Agency's credibility 
into question. Scott Breckinridge of the Office of Legislative 
Counsel met with McCone in early October and brought 
along photographs of all past and present CIA employees 
with the surname of Bishop. After hearing that the Agency 
had no record of a Maurice or Morris Bishop, McCone 
declined to look at the photographs and said he must have 
been mistaken when he gave his deposition. He said that the 
name had come up along with a dozen or so others after five 
hours of questioning and that although Maurice Bishop 
?`rang a bell" with him, he might have been thinking about 
someone else. Breckinridge informed the House commit-
tee's chief counsel, G. Robert Blakey, in mid-October that 
"Mr. McCone withdraws his statements on this point." Nei-

Bishop" has ever been established.' (U) 
A Conspiracy in the National Interest? (U) 
Although criticism of the Warren Commission intensi-
fied and conspiracy theories proliferated through the 1960s 
and 1970s, McCone did not alter his view about Oswald's 
guilt over the years. He told the House assassinations com-
mittee in 1978 that he knew of no evidence that would tie 
Oswald to the KGB, Cuba, or CIA. Had a hostile country 
been involved, he said, it would have provided Kennedy's 
killer with an "escape hatch"?for example, a visa such as 
Oswald had tried to get from the Soviets and Cubans in 
September 1963. When asked about Jack Ruby's possible 
role as an "eraser" sent to "rub out" Oswald, McCone 
replied that the circumstances surrounding that second 
murder "were so bizarre and unpredictable that it was 
impossible to detect a rational plot." Besides Nosenko's 
bona fides, the only matter on which McCone had changed 
his mind was concealing information about CIA's involve-
ment in plots to kill Castro. With almost 15 years of hind-
sight, he said that the Agency should have told the Warren 
Commission about those schemes. He did not explain why 
he thought differently then. Possibly he believed that greater 
candor in 1964 could have helped attenuate the damage

guided its overall strategy. Bishop not only directed the assassination attempt on Castro in Cuba in October 1961, he also engineered the plan to kill Castro in Chile

that the Agency's reputation suffered during the "time of 
troubles" in the 1970s.59 (U) 
Despite the prominence that many conspiratorialists 
have given to CIA in their speculations about who killed 
President Kennedy and who has concealed "the truth," they 
do not accuse McCone of participating in any murder plot 
or coverup. Even the most fervent critics of the "lone gun-
man" and "single bullet" theories who posit Agency respon-
sibility for the assassination blame rogue operatives below 
the senior executive echelon. At most, McCone has been 
accused of concealing inconvenient or embarrassing facts 
about CIA's clandestine activities or contacts that might 
lend credence to theories that Cuba or the Mafia were 
behind Kennedy's death, or that the Agency had a secret 
relationship with Oswald.' (U) 
McCone did have a place in a "benign cover-up," or what 
also has been termed "a process designed more to control 
information than to elicit and expose it."61 The protective 
response by McCone and other US government officials was 
inherent in the conflict between the Warren Commission's 
stated purpose?ascertaining the facts of the assassination?
and implied in its mission?defending the nation's security 
by dispelling unfounded rumors that could lead to destruc-
tive international conflict. The DCI was complicit in keep-
ing incendiary and diversionary issues off the commission's 
agenda and focusing it on what the Agency believed at the 
time was the "best truth": that Lee Harvey Oswald, for as 
yet undetermined motives, had acted alone in killing John 
Kennedy.' Max Holland, one of the most fairminded schol-
ars of these events, has concluded that "if the word 'conspir-
acy' must be uttered in the same breath as 'Kennedy 
assassination,' the only one that existed was the conspiracy 
to kill Castro and then keep that effort secret after Novem-
ber 22nd."63 In that sense?and that sense alone?McCone 
may be regarded as a "co-conspirator" in the JFK assassina-
tion "cover-up." (U)

Working With a New Boss (I): McCone, 
LBJ, and Vietnam (U) 
On the morning of 23 November 1963, John 
McCone directed Executive Assistant Walter 
Elder to tell President Lyndon Johnson's secretary 
that the DCI would be at the White House at 0900 to give 
the scheduled intelligence briefing to the president) 
McCone did not routinely participate in this activity, but 
he wanted to establish rapport with Johnson, whom he did 
not know well, and impress upon him CIA's indispensable 
role in providing information and analysis to the White 
House. 
The DCI and R. Jack Smith, director of OCI, met 
Johnson as he came into McGeorge Bundy's office at about 
0915. For the next 15 minutes, surrounded by clattering 
typewriters, ringing telephones, and a din of voices, they 
exchanged compliments and expressions of support, after 
which the DCI, according to Johnson, "led me on a tour of 
the troubled globe," went over the President's Intelligence 
Checklist, and answered a few questions. McCone recalled 
that the president's mood "was one of deep distress over the 
tragedy, and grave concern over how to get his arms around 
the problems that confronted him, [and] some concern 
about how to properly handle the men in the organization 
whose competence he recognized but also whose allegiance 
was to President Kennedy." Smith remembered that the 
president's mind soon began to wander. "Beside the com-
pact, trim McCone, [Johnson] looked massive, rumpled 
and worried. He had no interest whatever in being briefed, 
and after some inconsequential chatting, he turned back 
into Bundy's office. We had no way of knowing it, but we 
had just witnessed a preview of McCone's future relation-
ship with Lyndon Johnson."X 
Adjusting Personal and Bureaucratic Relationships (U) 
McCone had worked with Lyndon Johnson only sporad-
ically in the past. They had first met in the late 1940s while 
CHAPTER 
15 
McCone was on the Air Policy Commission and serving as a 
special assistant to Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. At 
the time, Johnson was in the House of Representatives and, 
after the 1948 election, in the Senate. While McCone was 
under secretary of the Air Force during 1950-51, he over-
saw Korean War procurement and dealt regularly with 
Johnson, then the chairman of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee's Preparedness Subcommittee. By the time 
McCone became head of the AEC in 1958, Johnson was 
majority leader of the Senate and worked on legislation 
related to atomic energy McCone did not meet with 
Johnson as vice president outside of NSC meetings and 
other White House briefings, and the two men had not 
talked with each other since several months before President 
Kennedy's assassination. (U) 
Until his sudden elevation to the presidency, Johnson's 
experience with intelligence was marginal and skewed. He 
had received a few classified briefings in the Senate as chair-
man of the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee and 
as majority leader, but neither the Kennedy White House, 
Allen Dulles, nor McCone made much of an effort to keep 
him informed after he became vice president. Johnson, in 
turn, distrusted the Agency, believing that it had conspired 
with his political opponents to deny him the presidential 
nomination in 1960 and that its principal officers were 
Kennedy loyalists. He paid little attention to CIA products. 
As vice president, his office received the Current Intelligence 
Bulletin, a less sensitive daily publication than the PICL, 
which President Kennedy did not want distributed outside 
his immediate circle of advisers. In any event, Johnson pre-
ferred to receive information verbally or through the media, 
savored the VIP and diplomatic gossip he heard from 
J. Edgar Hoover, and did not relish delving into estimates 
and analyses.3X

In the short term at least, McCone had the president's 
attention.' After their initial encounter, the DCI said he 
would continue briefing Johnson personally and "will see to 
it that [he] breaks down the commonly held view that it is 
somehow 'immoral' for the DCI to be seen publicly per-
forming in such a role." In the two weeks or so after the 
assassination, McCone visited the White House almost 
every day, updating the new president on trouble spots 
around the world and apprising him of covert action and 
technical collection pro-
grams. Privately telling 
McCone that "he had the 
greatest confidence in me 
personally," Johnson asked 
the DCI not to confine him-
self to intelligence matters 
but come to him personally 
with policy suggestions?spe-
cifically mentioning that he 
was dissatisfied with the 
advice he was receiving on 
Vietnam, Cuba, and nuclear 
issues.) 
ship with the president was far from cordial. The DCI 
recounted for the president some personal talks he had had 
with the attorney general, including the latter's uncertainty 
about his role in the new administration.' (Over time, 
McCones close relationship with Robert Kennedy would 
compound the difficulties the DCI was having with the 
president.) In subsequent meetings in Washington and at 
the LBJ Ranch, McCone and Johnson discussed non-intelli-
gence subjects such as the federal budget, the US military 
presence in Europe, and the 
president's first State of the 
Union Message. (The DCI?
perhaps with his own "over-
alls-to-riches" success story in 
mind?suggested that the 
speech contain some refer-
ence to the individual's per-
sonal responsibility for 
poverty and its alleviation.) 
McCone with President Johnson (U) Photo: LBJ Library 
Soon after taking office, 
the president told McCone 
that he "intended to call upon me for a great many activities 
which would be different from those of the past." One that 
Johnson specified, serving as a political emissary to promi-
nent Republicans on domestic economic issues, was old hat 
to McCone, and he continued to brief and consult Gen. 
Eisenhower regularly. That the president at first regarded 
McCone as a trustworthy insider and objective counselor is 
clearly shown by his request that the DCI help him with 
some delicate personnel matters, including cabinet, senior 
policymaker, and ambassadorial appointments. Johnson also 
used McCone as a source of information about the inten-
tions of Attorney General Robert Kennedy, whose relation-
All this "face time" with 
the chief executive soon 
proved to be a mixed bless-
ing. McCone found himself 
drawn deeper into affairs that 
were peripheral or counterproductive to his mission as head 
of the Intelligence Community. Scarcely a week after the 
transition, he complained to his senior deputies that 
Johnson often tasked him "with matters of no direct rela-
tionship to CIA and of possible damage to DCI relation-
ships with SecDef and SecState." As a first step to avoiding 
these distractions, McCone decided to change procedures 
for White House briefings, dispensing with daily sessions in 
lieu of weekly NSC meetings where he would brief on cur-
rent intelligence only, try to steer clear of policy discussions, 
and "give the President [the] benefit of give and take with 
his top advisers."'

Working With a New Boss (I): McCone, LBJ, and Vietnam (U) 
Even with that rationing of contact, McCone wore out his 
welcome. Although he was purveying highly sensitive infor-
mation, his access to Johnson diminished as time passed. The 
DCI misinterpreted the president's predilection for informal 
policy discussions as an indication that he preferred to receive 
intelligence information regularly and verbally. Richard 
Helms recalled, however, that Johnson "finally got bored, 
closed the door, and that was the end. He just didn't want to 
do it any more. You couldn't make him do it any more." Wil-
liam Colby, who frequently accompanied the DCI to White 
House briefings on Vietnam, has recalled that "McCone's 
pressures for direct access to LBJ aroused the President's pro-
tective instincts against being pushed, and he was not 
impressed with McCone's efforts to dazzle him."W 
McCone had assessed his principal consumer inaccu-
rately. The president preferred reading short memoranda to 
listening to formal briefings. The DCI's "crisp, concise sen-
tences, spoken in his usual brisk manner, fell on deaf 
Johnsonian ears," according to R. Jack Smith. After a profes-
sional lifetime of running affairs his way, McCone did not 
adjust to the fact that he and Johnson operated differently. 
The DCI, accustomed to a hierarchical corporate environ-
ment, was used to listening to prepared staff recommenda-
tions at structured meetings and then making a decision, 
and assumed any chief executive?especially a newcomer to 
the job?would operate the same way. Instead, the presi-
dent, steeped in traditional "old boy" politics, preferred to 
talk over issues casually with friends and associates in relaxed 
settings and work out a "deal." McCone, according to 
Walter Elder and Ray Cline, had a much easier time work-
ing with the "presidential" Kennedy?the long-range, stra-
tegic thinker?than the "congressional" Johnson?the 
political tactician.' McCone later noted that while Kennedy 
used to insist on seeing him for a weekly recap and forecast 
of trouble spots, Johnson only wanted to see him if some 
intelligence matter warranted immediate attention. Nor did 
Johnson, after a few months, invite McCone's increasingly 
dissonant thoughts on policy, preferring to rely on the more 
compliant (and far more powerful) Dean Rusk and Robert 
McNamara. R. Jack Smith has written that 
Nile president's chief intelligence officer must have 
ready access to the president if he is to carry out his 
mission effectively. Moreover, it must be comfortable 
access. Both men must feel easy, confident of the 
other's support.... It cannot be legislated or com-
manded. It is the product of personal chemistry and 
compatibility of mind. 
Mutual comfort, ease and confidence, and good personal 
chemistry never characterized McCone's relationship with 
President Johnson.A 
McCone and others inside and outside CIA have over-
stated his lack of access to Johnson, but even if the quantity 
of contacts remained reasonably high, their quality declined. 
According to White House records, between 22 November 
1963 and 25 April 1965, the DCI met with the president 89 
times and spoke to him by telephone 14 times?or more 
than one direct contact per week. The average was higher 
under Kennedy, however, and not only did the frequency 
decline after mid-1964, but McCone increasingly saw 
Johnson only as a participant in meetings of national secu-
rity advisers and less often one-on-one.IA 
The DCI failed to persuade the president of the value of 
personal intelligence briefings and by early 1964 was com-
plaining to Bundy about not seeing Johnson. At Bundy's 
suggestion, McCone raised the subject of access at a private 
meeting with the president that April (the scheduled topic 
was Eisenhower, not intelligence). Johnson, presumably 
forewarned that McCone was "disturbed" at "not seeing 
very much" of him, replied that he was available anytime; 
"all [McCone] had to do was call up." McCone said he had 
tried to do so several times recently without success. 
Johnson then noted that he had been very busy of late, that 
the DCI was welcome to bring special matters to his atten-
tion, but that he "did not wish to be briefed just for the pur-
pose of being briefed"; he found the PICL "perfectly 
adequate" and went over it carefully. After their meeting, 
Johnson?probably assuming that McCone had griped to 
other officials about not getting into the Oval Office?sig-
naled to the DCI that the matter was closed. At an NSC 
HelnisE?OH, 36; Colby, Lost Victory, 182.X 
McCone admired Johnson's political acumen, however. In an off-the-record discussion with journalist James Reston, he said, It amuses me, you know, I go out 
west and he's got this kind of a hayseed reputation. I tell my friends.., now listen, this guy's no hick.. .he's had more experience than any man that's ever been Presi-

CHAPTER 15 
President Johnson reading the new President's Daily Brief(U) 
Photo: White House 
meeting following their talk, the president announced that 
he had just received a "thorough briefing" from the DCI 
and then asked if McCone had any intelligence matters to 
raise with the NSC?implying that those had been the sub-
ject of their just-concluded interview. McCone later noted 
for the record that "my discussion with President Johnson 
did not involve an intelligence briefing" (his emphasis). 
McCone tried again a few months later, offering to meet 
with the president at any time to discuss intelligence matters 
and give him "the full benefit" of Agency expertise. Johnson 
did not respond. Not until 11 months into Johnson's term 
did McCone have a private opportunity to discuss purely 
Agency affairs?organization, budget, personnel?rather 
than the clandestine activities that supported the adminis-
tration's diplomatic and military undertakings:1N' 
McCone tried, with more success, to impress Johnson 
with CIA's analytical contributions by adjusting the format 
of Agency publications to suit the president's preferences. 
Johnson probably was disinclined to read the PICL?a 
product tailored for his predecessor who had denied it to 
him?and the backgro under-likequality of the first 
issues prepared for him may have seemed insulting. 
(He did, however, expect his senior staff to read it.) 
Moreover, whereas Kennedy preferred to see the 
presidential publication in the morning, and 
enjoyed a sprinkling of chattiness and humor in it, 
Johnson wanted a more sober product to peruse in 
the evening when he did most of his reading. Get-
ting feedback on the content remained difficult 
during the transition. Kennedy would jot com-
ments on his copy or call Cline, Smith, or even jun-
ior officers to discuss stories that had not appeared 
in the PICL, but obtaining comments from 
Johnson was practically impossible. After awhile, he 
tended not to read the publication. A presidential 
aide told a senior DI officer that "if we [CIA] can't 
penetrate this sort of wall.. we'll just have to try 
something else." In January 1964, the biweekly 
President's Intelligence Review a summary of the 
preceding PICLs?premiered at the White House. 
Johnson's military aide, Gen. C.V. Clifton, said the 
president?"a painfully slow reader" who "just can-
not afford the time to digest a daily book"?thought the 
Review was "very valuable" and wanted it "kept up without 
chanEe  
 He also had NIEs give more attention to alternative, 
less probable scenarios as well as the outcomes that the com-
munity considered most likely.' 
Later in 1964, McCone and senior DDI officers decided 
that there was little use in producing a publication that the 
president read infrequently. The DCI accepted R. Jack 
Smith's suggestion that the most graceful solution was to 
stop publishing the PICL and prepare a new publication 
that conformed as much as possible to Johnson's work hab-
its. After the 1964 election, the Agency dropped the PICL 
and the Review, and on 1 December, the first issue of the 
President's Daily Brief (PDB) arrived at the White House. 
The president read it, liked the new format, and wanted 
publication to continue. As Johnson became more deeply 
involved in foreign affairs?especially tactical developments

"Got Lots of Troubles" (U) 
"Is it more dangerous," a despondent Lyndon Johnson 
confided to his senatorial mentor, Richard Russell, in late 
May 1964, "to let things [in Vietnam] go as they're going 
now, deteriorating every day... than it would be for us to 
move in?.. .1 don't see any other way out of it." After only six 
months in power, the president and many officials in his 
administration were feeling frustrated over the fact that, as 
McNamara later wrote, he had "inherited a god-awful mess 
eminently more dangerous than the one Kennedy had 
inherited from Eisenhower." During the Kennedy presi-
dency, the number of US military personnel in South Viet-
nam had grown from 875 to over 16,000, but when 
Johnson took office, their usefulness seemed doubtful. The 
junta of South Vietnamese generals that had ousted Ngo 
Dinh Diem in November 1963 was struggling with its new 
governmental responsibilities, and its members with each 
other. Counterinsurgency efforts were put on hold. Crony-
ism, corruption, and incompetence persisted at the high lev-
els of the Saigon regime, which was widely regarded as an 
American puppet. '4,v 
Despite these difficulties, President Johnson pledged to 
his top Vietnam decisionmakers two days after taking office 
that "I am not going to lose Vietnam. I am not going to be 
the President who saw Southeast Asia go the way China 
went." To Johnson, who felt bound politically to carry on 
T-Telaercnn 75-77  
his predecessor's policy, the alternatives were clear. As he 
told a reporter, "There's one of three things you can do 
[about Vietnam] .... You can run or you can fight, as we are 
do in', or you can sit down and agree to neutralize all of it, 
but nobody's gonna neutralize North Vietnam.... [S] o it 
really boils down to one or two decisions: gettin' out or get-
tin' in." His first directive on Vietnam, issued on 26 
November 1963, declared his intention to persist. "It 
remains the central objective of the United States in South 
Vietnam to assist the people and government of that coun-
try to win their contest against the externally directed and 
supported Communist conspiracy." He expected consensus 
among his advisers and demanded that they be as dedicated 
to this task as he was. "Don't go to bed at night until you 
have asked yourself, 'Have I done everything I could to fur-
ther the American effort to assist South Vietnam?" Pri-
vately, though, the president realized the quandary he was 
in. "I feel like one of those [Texas] catfish," he confided to 
his press secretary, Bill Moyers. "I feel like I just grabbed a 
big juicy worm with a right sharp hook in the middle of 
it."15 (U) 
Different Men, Different Views (U) 
McCone devoted more attention to Vietnam than to any 
other national security issue during the last 18 months of his 
directorship, and policy disputes over how to fight the war 
clouded his relationship with Johnson. The conflict's intrac-
tability only strengthened the president's determination to 
defeat the Vietnamese communists without a major military 
commitment that would derail his domestic policy agenda. 
This resolve, combined with Johnson's lack of interest in 
CIA activities, as well as other personal and bureaucratic fac-
tors, made McCone's dealings with the White House so dif-
ficult that by late summer 1964 he had decided to resign the 
following year. Meanwhile, during the remainder of his ten-
ure, CIA assisted the US military's expanded role in the 
clandestine war against North Vietnam and the Viet Cong,

and undertook its own covert initiatives with a mixed record 
of success. (U) 
What role McCone and CIA would have in the new 
administration's policy toward Vietnam was unclear in the 
beginning. McCone's early contacts with the president on 
Vietnam were amicable and candid. During the transition, 
Johnson sought McCone's advice on several sensitive policy 
and personnel matters related to the issue, such as who 
could best lead South Vietnam or which US advisers and 
ambassadors would be best suited for working on the prob-
lem. Johnson at first seemed to appreciate McCone's experi-
ence and insights, and the DCI was flattered by the 
presidential solicitations. McCone sensed a difference, how-
ever. After a meeting on 24 November 1963, he wrote: "I 
received...the first 'President Johnson tone' for action as 
contrasted with the 'Kennedy tone.' Johnson definitely feels 
that we place too much emphasis on social reforms; he has 
very little tolerance with our spending so much time being 
`do-gooders'...."16 (u) 
Changes that President Johnson made in his administra-
tion's foreign policy making processes further diminished 
McCone's stature. Largely as a bureaucratic gesture, the pres-
ident instituted an ostensibly more orderly and formal style 
of decisionmaking than had prevailed in the Kennedy 
administration. At the same time, however, he tightly con-
trolled a parallel collection of loosely structured arrange-
ments where the "real" decisions were made. Johnson 
dispensed with the discursive NSC meetings that Kennedy 
had favored, expected cabinet officers to be fully in charge of 
their respective policy domains, and elevated the role of the 
Department of State in framing and executing US foreign 
policy. Partly to prevent leaks about policy disputes, he used 
the NSC mainly as a briefing forum and a ratifier of deci-
sions. The Special Group Counterinsurgency, another 
Kennedy administration creation, met less frequently under 
Johnson and did not deal with Vietnam; the full Special 
Group and a new interagency coordinating committee took 
over its work.' Johnson preferred to address difficult 
national security issues in more intimate surroundings out-
side the NSC?ones analogous to the cloakroom manipula-
tions he engaged in as party chief in the Senate. Foremost 
among these were the Tuesday Lunches that he began host-
ing in February 1964. Rusk, McNamara, and Bundy were 
the charter members of that most elite of dining clubs. The 
president also had a "kitchen cabinet" of colleagues and cro-
nies from Texas and Washington from whom he often 
sought private counsel.' (U) 
Overall, these changes emphasized the status of Rusk, 
McNamara, and Bundy, and reduced McCone's informal 
avenues of access and influence to the White House. He had 
good personal relations with Rusk, but he never got along 
that well with Bundy, and he was still fighting with 
McNamara over bureaucratic and policy matters. Not sur-
prisingly, the DCI attended only six of the 27 Tuesday 
Lunches held between late February and late September 
1964, when they were suspended for the election campaign. 
He attended none after they resumed in March 1965.19 (U) 
McCone directly felt Johnson's penchant for hands-on 
management when the president intruded himself in the 
selection of a new chief of station in Saigon.' On 
2 December 1963, Johnson wrote to the DCI about a per-
manent successor to John Richardson, who had been with-
drawn but not yet replaced formally. Either bring in a "top-
notch man," the president directed McCone, or "promote 
the man on the spot." He asserted personal control over the 
appointment, telling the DCI that he awaited a nomination 
from among the Agency's "best and most experienced." 
McCone had intended to  have Richardson's replacement 
start the following June, 
but the presi-

dent wanted the COS position filled right away. On the rec-
ommendation of William Colby, McCone chose Peer de 
Silva, De Silva, an 
Army counterintelligence officer with the Manhattan 
Project in World War II, joined the Agency in the early 
1950s 
Before he left for Saigon, 
McCone took him to the White House to meet the presi-
dent. Dc Silva recalled McCone's advice to him beforehand: 
For God's sake, remember what's been happening here 
recently?President Kennedy has been assassinated, 
President Johnson is new in the White House, and the 
Vietnam problem is getting worse every day. [Ambas-
sador Henry Cabot] Lodge is becoming more and 
more obstreperous and Johnson wants no more prob-
lems out there as there were between Lodge and John 
Richardson; remember all of these things when we go 
to the president's office tomorrow.,ir 
At their meeting in the Oval Office, President Johnson 
assured de Silva of his full support but reminded him that 
one of his primary missions was to get along with Lodge, 
and not to forget that 1964 was an election year. At the 
same time, McCone warned Johnson that Lodge "would 
destroy de Silva if he opposed his assignment, or did not like 
him, or wished to get rid of him." The president said he 
would "communicate most emphatically" with the ambassa-
dor to prevent that, but McCone replied that Lodge "was 
absolutely unconscionable in matters of this kind...he had 
resorted to trickery time and time again during the Eisen-
hower administration and.., never failed to use the newspa-
pers in order to expose an individual or block an action." 
Johnson averred that he "would exercise the full power of his 
office to keep Lodge in line," but he would not go so far as 
President Johnson's NSC in 1964. McCone is at the far end of 
the table. (U) Photo: LBJ Library 
to remove the ambassador, as McCone wanted, lest he 
antagonize the Republicans.'. 
More than anything else, it was CIA's dissent from the 
administration's policy and its forecasts about Vietnam that 
estranged McCone from Johnson. McCone summarized 
their differences in a postretirement interview: "I disagreed 
with McNamara and others who said they could see the 
light at the end of the tunnel. We in the CIA didn't see any 
light at the end of the tunnel, and we had a very pessimistic 
view which was sharply resented by everyone right up to 
President Johnson." McCone set the analytical tone for his 
relationship with Johnson over Vietnam just two days into 
the new presidency by delivering a bleak assessment at a 
meeting of the senior Vietnam policy group (the president, 
Bundy, McNamara, Rusk, Lodge, and Ball). Speaking 
immediately after Lodge sanguinely described the prospects 
for the post-Diem regime, McCone reported that the Viet 
Cong had stepped up activity since the 1 November coup 
and were preparing to exert severe pressure; that the coup 
leaders were having trouble organizing a government and

securing help from civilian officials; and that counterinsur-
gency operations were at a standstill. The DCI concluded 
that he could see few reasons for optimism.'N, 
"McCone's position throughout this period," journalist 
Thomas Powers has aptly written, "was the one least conge-
nial to Johnson: a strong conviction of the importance of 
victory, combined with deep pessimism about how we were 
doing, ending with a claim that only strong measures might 
recover the situation.... McCone went further than most. In 
one meeting after another he insisted that if the United 
States was going in, it had to go in all the way." The presi-
dent initially respected McCone's frankness and even agreed 
with the DCI on some points. For example, he likewise 
thought Lodge "had made a great blunder in disposing of 
Diem" and said "in the most emphatic way that he felt the 
appointment of Lodge was a serious mistake," McCone 
wrote after a private meeting at the White House in late 
November 1963.23.1:iie 
Eventually, Johnson tuned the DCI out, to the detriment 
of CIA. Indicative of the president's attitude about the 
Agency was the following story he told at a private dinner 
(as recounted by Richard Helms): 
Let me tell you about these intelligence guys. When I 
was growing up in Texas, we had a cow named Bessie. 
I'd go out early and milk her. I'd get her in the stan-
chion, seat myself and squeeze out a pail of fresh milk. 
One day I'd worked hard and gotten a full pail of 
milk, but I wasn't paying attention, and old Bessie 
swung her shit-smeared tail through that bucket of 
milk. Now, you know, that's what these intelligence 
guys do. You work hard and get a good program or 
policy going, and they swing a shit-smeared tail 
through it.24 (U) 
Nor did McCone have any personal advocates inside the 
Johnson White House. He dealt with much the same 
national security contingent as he had under Kennedy, and 
his relations with them, strained since the Cuban missile cri-
sis, did not improve. Evidence of the DCI's outsider status 
was a clever but caustic memorandum that McGeorge 
Bundy wrote to President Johnson about him in May 1964. 
Bundy and Clark Clifford, the head of PFIAB, had agreed 
on "the ideal method of keeping John McCone really happy 
about the level of his contact with you: Golf" McCone, 
Bundy wrote, "is an energetic and agreeable golfer," has 
"more free time" than either Bundy or Clifford, and "can 
pay his own Burning Tree greens fee."' (U) 
While McCone drifted to the periphery of White House 
discussions of Vietnam, he retained some authority over 
war-related intelligence activities as chairman of USIB. 
Southeast Asia became a preoccupation of USIB during the 
Johnson presidency, the subject of action once a week on 
average. McCone and the other board members spent about 
a third of their time on the issue dealing with special esti-
mates; one fourth on SIGINT and other clandestine intelli-
gence about North Vietnamese violations of the Geneva 
accords; one fourth on overhead reconnaissance require-
ments; and one sixth on other special studies handled by 
USIB committees and subcommittees. The estimates, which 
McCone scrutinized before signing, were often discussed at 
5.2G.J.A. O'Toole, Honorable Treachery, 491 citing interview with McCone on PBS documentary Secret Intelligence, broadcast in 1989; McCone, "Memorandum for 
the Record.. South Vietnam Situation," 25 November 1963, FRUS, 1961-63, IV, Vietnam, August?December 1963, 635-37; idem, "Memorandum for the 
Record.. Discussion with President Johnson, 28 November 1963...," McCone Papers, box 6, folder 6; Johnson, The Vantage Point, 43 
ss Powers, The Man Who Kept the Secrets, 165-66; "Memorandum for the Record... Discussion with President Johnson, 28 November 1963...," McCone Papers, 
box 6, folder 6. McCone attributed Johnson's antipathy toward Lodge to conflicts they had while in the Senate.X 
Johnson's abiding bitterness over Diem's ouster was evident more than two years later in taped Oval Office conversations. To Sen. Eugene McCarthy, he paraphrased 
the coup proponents' words as "He was corrupt and he ought to be killed," and then said, "So we killed him. We all got together and got a goddamn bunch of thugs 
and assassinated him. Now, we've really had no political stability [in South Vietnam] since then." Right after, he said much the same thing to Maxwell Taylor: "They 
started out and said, 'We got to kill Diem, because he's no damn good. Let's.. .knock him off.' And we did.... That's exactly where it [Vietnam's downhill slide] 
started!" Conversations with McCarthy and Taylor on 1 February 1966, quoted in James Rosen, "What's Hidden in the LBJ Tapes," Weekly Standard, 29 September 
2003,12. If Johnson thought that CIA had been the Kennedy administration's "agent" in eliminating Diem, he may well have blamed it?and McCone?for at least 
some of his problems. (U)

McCone may have brought on some of this ribbing by being oversensitive about his "hall file" in the White House. In January 1964, for example, he discussed with 
the US government's chief financial officer, Bureau of the Budget director Elmer Staats, the relatively trivial question of outfitting his official car to prevent the driver 
and security officer from overhearing his confidential conversations. President Johnson already knew about the matter, and McCone worried that someone else in 
the White House or the Cabinet would seize on it to accuse him of "taking advantage because of a free hand with our budget." The DCI offered to buy the type of 
vehicle he wanted and donate it to the government, but Staats indicated t acre were better ways to handle the situation. Transcript of McCone telephone conversa-

saw as USIB chairman functioned well on the Vietnam issue 
during the Johnson administration. Requirements were sat-
isfied, and assessments were produced in a timely fashion. 
BNE and the DI had little apparent impact on policy and 
strategy decisions, however, because not enough of CIA's 
senior consumers?most significantly, the president?were 
listening, or if they were, they did not want to hear what 
they were being told. Ray Cline has written that "[a]s the 
Vietnam war became more worrisome, Johnson retreated 
more and more from orderly reviewing of evidence and sys-
tematic consultation.... Intelligence did not have a place at 
the table"?at least not the sort that McCone brought. Ana-
lysts' conclusions clashed with policymakers' geopolitical 
and ideological conceptions of international communism, 
their judgments of Moscow's and Beijing's intentions, their 
anxieties over perceptions of US prestige and power, and, as 
November 1964 drew near, their interests in securing 
Johnson's election. Regardless of how well the community 
performed, the president was still dissatisfied and frustrated 
with it. With three wire service tickers and three television 
sets in his office, and copies of the major American daily 
newspapers nearby, he did not often see what value the intel-
ligence services added to the information mix. "I thought 
you guys had people everywhere, that you knew every-
thing," he complained to McCone, only half in jest, "and 
now you don't even know anything about a raggedy-ass little 
fourth-rate country. All you have to do is get some Chinese 
coolies from a San Francisco laundry shop and drop them 
over there and use them. Get them to drop their answers in 
a bottle and put the bottle in the Pacific." The DCI, not 
known for his sense of humor, did not appreciate the jibe.'

Epiphany in South Vietnam (U) 
In the last weeks of 1963, a perplexed and troubled Presi-
dent Johnson sought to penetrate the many uncertainties 
about the new regime in Saigon and its ability to reinvigo-
rate the war against the communists. To this end, he dis-
patched a factfinding mission in mid-December, headed by 
McNamara and including McCone, Bundy, William Colby, 
Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Victor Krulak from the Depart-
ment of Defense, and William Sullivan from the Depart-
ment of State. During three busy days of briefings, 
meetings, working meals, and receptions, the DCI saw the 
principal figures on the Military Revolutionary Committee 
that governed South Vietnam?the leader of the coup 
against Diem, Gen. Duong Van Minh ("Big Minh"); the 
prime minister; the ministers of defense, foreign affairs, and 
internal security; the chief of military security; and some 
senior military commanders, including Gen. Nguyen 
Khanh, who would lead his own successful coup in January. 
McCone also met with Ambassador Lodge and MACV head 
Gen. Paul Harkins and toured parts of the Mekong River 
delta region southwest of Saigon, where the Viet Cong 
insurgency had made substantial gains during 1963.28>4% 
Beneath the diplomatic niceties, comforting words, and 
assurances of support and progress-to-be-made, McCone 
found the "ground truth" to be disconcerting. A few

sentences from his report to the president capture his down-
beat assessment: 
There is no organized government in South Vietnam 
at this time. The Military Revolutionary Committee 
(MRC) is in control, but strong leadership and 
administrative procedures are lacking.... 
The lack of an outstanding individual to lead and 
absence of administrative experience within the MRC 
are ominous indicators.... 
The political stability of the new government under 
the MRC is subject to serious doubt.... 
The military government may be an improvement 
over the Diem-Nhu regime, but this is not as yet 
established and the future of the war remains in 
doubt.... 
The VC [Viet Gong] appeal to the people of South 
Vietnam on political grounds has been effective.... 
The ability of the GVN [government of Viet Nam] to 
reverse this trend remains to be proven.... 
[T]here are more reasons to doubt the future of the 
effort under present programs and moderate exten-
sions to existing programs.. .than there are reasons to 
be optimistic about the future of our cause in South 
Vietnam." (U) 
While on the trip, McCone learned how distorted and 
incomplete US intelligence reporting had been?particularly 
that coming through military channels. Policymakers already 
were aware of problems with the amount, accuracy, and 
timeliness of intelligence about the Viet Cong, but McCone's 
concerns were different in degree and kind. "It is abundantly 
clear," he told the president, "that statistics received over the 
past year or more from GVN officials and reported by the 
US mission on which we gauged the trend of the war were 
grossly in error." There was "no excuse for the kind of report-
ing" that had understated difficulties in Long An Province 
near Saigon, he complained to Lodge. In a letter to Rusk 
soon after his return, McCone noted that South Vietnamese 
province and district chiefs had "grossly misinformed" field 
officers of the MAAG (MACV's forerunner) and the US 
Observer Mission, and that American civilian and military 
officials could not audit the reporting.' 
In these and other remarks, McCone attributed the intel-
ligence failings to US officials' dependence on liaison report-
ing, not to distortions in American reporting or assessments, 
or to bad field management of collection. He was aware that 
the US military had few reliable, independent sources and 
that it was inclined to "politicize" its reporting and analysis. 
Moreover, Lodge had been limiting the station's clandestine 
contacts with South Vietnamese officials. At this time dur-
ing the policy debate in Washington, and with a new presi-
dent just installed in office, however, McCone evidently 
thought it wiser to blame the ousted Diem regime for any 
intelligence shortcomings rather than MACV and the 
embassy. Lacking full authority over the entire US intelli-
gence bureaucracy, the DCI's ability to address the inade-
quacies of the military departments was limited in any 
event. X 
To rectify the situation from CIA's end, McCone pro-
posed dispatching a group of what he called "our 'old South 
Vietnamese hands" to independently examine the reporting 
system, which had failed to show the Saigon government's 
political weakness in the field.' These veterans from the DI 
and the DDP, many plucked from distant posts for the 
assignment, were instructed to spread out over the country-
side and reacquaint themselves with official, unilateral, and 
personal contacts, bypass the normal reporting processes, 
and discern the true lay of the land. The team (codenamed 
ross-checked reports from existing sources and 
eve Opel new methods to corroborate data. "This has not

McNamara, in contrast to his rosy public presentiments, in private made a similarly discouraging evaluation. "The situation is very cisturbing," he reported to the 
president. The new government of Gen. Minh was "indecisive and drifting." "Current trends, unless reversed in the next 2-3 months, will lead to neutralization at 
best and more likely to a Communist-controlled state." "The situation has in fact been deteriorating in the countryside since July to a far greater extent than we real-
ized because of undue dependence on distorted Vietnamese reporting. The Vietcong now control very high proportions of the people in certain key provinces, par-
ticularly those south and west of Saigon." McNamara memorandum to President Johnson, 21 December 1963, ibid., 732-33. (U)

been CIA's role in the past, as intelligence of this type has 
come through military channels," McCone wrote the presi-
dent. "However[,] I believe the next few months are so criti-
cal that information covertly developed will complement 
reporting we receive through the other channels.".N, 
At first McCone's idea was not well received at the Penta-
gon, where McNamara insisted that the survey group's mem-
bership be expanded to include officers from the 
Departments of Defense and State. McCone?recognizing 
that conflicts in reporting were inevitable, given that progress 
in the war was not quantifiable?nonetheless pointed out 
that MACV's excessive optimism and the embassy's pessi-
mism threw reporting out of balance, and that the US mili-
tary's intelligence assets in the South were inadequate and 
mismanaged. The JCS also complained about inconsistent 
and incomplete intelligence, so it went along with the survey 
team idea with the proviso that it would not develop a sepa-
rate collection and reporting system. When the CIA repre-
sentatives submitted their evaluation of field intelligence in 
mid-February, MACV commander Harkins criticized some 
of the judgments as too harsh. Such independent assess-
ments, he added, risked "misleading the national decision 
process by forwarding information not coordinated and 
cleared with other elements of the US reporting mechanism 
in Vietnam." Two improvements came out of the surve 
team exercise: the South Vietnamese national police, 
established prisoner interrogation centers in 
each province: 
Another Government, Another Debate (U) 
After returning from Saigon, McCone predicted that 
"another coup or even another thereafter might occur" in 
South Vietnam. He was right both times (although he did 
not forecast either date). On 30 January 1964, after scarcely 
three feckless months in power, Gen. "Big Minh" was 
ousted in a bloodless putsch led by Gen. Nguyen Khanh?
inaugurating months of leadership instability in Saigon. The 
US government was aware of the plotting two days before, 
but Khanh did not tell the embassy of his plan until just 
before it was executed. According to William Bundy, at the 
time the assistant secretary of defense for international secu-
rity affairs, Khanh's coup "was most definitely not antici-
pated or stimulated by any American."32X 
McCone heard about the coup on the 30th while travel-
ing in Western Europe and was not pleased. He had been 
decidedly unimpressed with Khanh when they met during 
the DCI's trip to South Vietnam in June 1962, and nothing 
he learned about the general afterward made him think dif-
ferently. Khanh, McCone recalled, was "pretty slick" and left 
him with "a feeling of insecurity...a very uncertain feeling." 
In addition, as he learned more about the circumstances sur-
rounding the coup, McCone came to believe that the 
embassy and MACV had kept information from the 
Agency. He later wrote that US officials in Saigon ahead of 
time had "a clear indication that Khanh meant action. Why 
was it not reported by MACV, Lodge, or CAS [Controlled 
American Source, a cover name for CIA] not 
informed?... [W]hy was the COS excluded from the play 
even after the Lodge reporting telegram went out?" "The 
remaining scenario of events," McCone concluded, "leaves 
doubt as to whether we [US intelligence agencies] were alert 
to the indicators, analyzed them for their effect on US pol-
icy and attempted to direct them." In short, the Khanh 
coup was an intelligence failure through and through.33><

Taylor depicted Khahn as "a skillful or unscrupulous croupier in the political roulette as played in Saigon," and the Agency's veteran Vietnam officer 
said he was manipulative and chronically dishonest. A more balanced station assessment of March 1964 described Khanh as a moody loner with intelligence anti

CHAPTER 15 
Approved for Release: 2015/04/10 001262737 
To get objective assessments of the unsettled situation in 
South Vietnam, McCone had Agency officers conduct two 
reviews, and took a second trip to the country in March. 
Executive Director-Comptroller Kirkpatrick and COS de 
Silva did one of the assessments, and the abovementioned 
special survey team did the other. De Silva, writing in Feb-
ruary, predicted that the "gradual abrading of the popular 
will to resistance? would destabilize the Saigon government 
unless countered by South Vietnamese military victories. 
Kirkpatrick was "shocked by the number of our (CIA) peo-
ple and of the military, even those whose job is always to say 
we are winning, who feel that the tide is against us." He 
added that the Viet Gong's superior intelligence capabilities 
were a major factor in their success, and that unless commu-
nist infiltration into the South from Laos and Cambodia 
was curtailed, "this entire pacification effort is like trying to 
mop the floor before turning off the faucet." Around that 
time, the urvey team submitted the first of two 
reports to t he initial one depicted a scene of gen-
eral deterioration, with the Viet Cong gaining headway, the 
South Vietnamese leadership ineffective, and counterinsur-
gency programs in disarray.'. 
Soon after receiving the above reports, McCone went to 
Saigon. Senior administration officials were not enthusiastic 
about his trip, but McNamara and Taylor already were trav-
eling there, and no good reason could be given why the DCI 
should not go as well. Moreover, he was not about to let 
Agency equities go unprotected during a Pentagon VIP tour 
whose main purpose was to convey Washington's endorse-
ment of Khanh. McCone could not be said to be going with 
an open mind. A few weeks before, he had commented that 
the last special estimate dealing with South Vietnam (dated 
12 February) was not sufficiently negative, and just before 
he left he wrote that "the situation is worse now than it was 
in December...I am more pessimistic of the future of the 
American cause in South Vietnam than [before]......35,1K 
Little that McCone saw or heard there during six days in 
early March would have changed his viewpoint. On the 
Vietnamese side, he met with Gen. Khanh and his military 
lieutenants; Gen. Minh, now the figurehead chief of state; 
and the vice prime ministers or ministers in charge of for-
eign affairs, economics, interior affairs, and cultural and 
social affairs. He did not receive what he thought were con-
vincing answers to questions about increased enemy activity, 
or about the Saigon government's abilities to conduct suc-
cessful "clear and hold" operations and to win the allegiance 
of the estimated 50 percent of the population that did not 
care who won the war. A report from the earn 
about intelligence and operational problems was notably 
discouraging in that regard. Perhaps the bluntest conclusion 
the DCI heard came from the Australian colonel who 
headed his country's advisory team: "We are being asked the 
wrong question. When someone asks 'can the war be won,' 
the answer is 'certainly, yes'; but if someone asks 'will the 
war be won,' the answer is 'very probably, no.'"36>< 
When the Pentagon party returned, McNamara submit-
ted to the president a trip report that included a dozen pol-
icy recommendations founded on the premises that South 
Vietnam was too important to let fall to the communists 
and that current difficulties could be overcome. Besides 
increases in nonmilitary aid and military materiel, 
McNamara proposed that the US government underwrite 
an expansion of the South Vietnamese army and the cre-
ation of a counterguerrilla force, authorize Saigon's forces to 
engage in "hot pursuit operations into Laos, and have the 
South Vietnamese air force prepared to launch retaliatory air 
strikes across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on 72 hours 
notice and full-scale air raids (along with US aircraft) on

there is a marked improvement in the effectiveness of the South Vietnamese government and armed forces, South Vietnam has at best an even chance of withstand-
ing the insurgency menace during the next few weeks or months." SNIE 50-64, "Short-Term Prospects in Southeast Asia," 12 February 1964, 1.X

30 days notice. McNamara circulated a draft of the report 
among the trip participants. Hoping for consensus but 
anticipating disagreement, he allowed dissenters to take 
footnotes.' (U) 
McCone took five. In the last?the longest and most 
important?he concurred with McNamara's proposals but 
called them "too little too late." He recommended instead a 
six-point program that would have significantly escalated 
the level of armed conflict and US involvement in Southeast 
Asia. For example, whereas McNamara's carefully hedged 
program of Cambodian border control emphasized that 
operations across the border should depend on the state of 
relations with Cambodia, McCone recommended that Gen. 
Khanh insist upon an immediate meeting with Prince Siha-
nouk to develop a joint border clearing program. If Siha-
nouk should refuse, McCone stated that Khanh, with US 
assistance, should "stop all traffic on the Mekong River to 
and from Cambodia, destroy Viet Cong installations in 
Cambodia, and authorize ARVN to engage in hot pursuit 
across the Cambodian border." In addition, McCone rec-
ommended that Nationalist Chinese troops be introduced 
into the delta?a proposal so unacceptable that Taylor 
warned that if it were put to the Joint Chiefs, they would 
unanimously oppose it.38* 
President Johnson did not want policy feuds among his 
advisers to be publicized, so at a meeting of the Vietnam 
principals to discuss McNamara's draft, he told the secretary 
of defense and the DCI that he hoped they could settle their 
differences. He deplored the fact that if such a split arose at 
an NSC meeting with a few dozen participants, it would 
immediately leak to the press. McNamara stated that his 
and McCone's judgments could not be reconciled. At that 
point, McCone decided to withdraw from the field as a pol-
icy adviser on Vietnam. "[A]s far as I was concerned," he 
told Johnson, "I would not advance my views at an NSC 
meeting unless specifically requested by the president for the 
simple reason that such matters as military and foreign pol-
icy were beyond my competence as Director of Central 
Intelligence." He had commented on McNamara's paper 
and expressed his thoughts to the president because he was 
asked to, but from now on, he said, he would confine him-
self to intelligence issues. At the next NSC meeting, 
McCone gave a terse summary of current developments and 
said nothing more.',X, 
The Intelligence War: The Southern Theater (U) 
The administration's war policy review in early 1964 
ended with the issuance of NSAM No. 288 on 17 March?
a document that was "minimal in the scale of its recommen-
dations at the same time that it stated US objectives in the 
most sweeping terms used up to that time," according to the 
Pentagon Papers. The directive ordered the implementation 
of the specific proposals in McNamara's report. There were 
four possible courses of action at this point, President 
Johnson told the NSC: "more war' against the DRV [North 
Vietnam] which is undesirable; pulling out, which is unde-
sirable; neutralization, which is impractical and conse-
quently undesirable; and the course outlined [in the report] 
which is the only real alternative." The comprehensive pol-
icy entailed, among other objectives, providing economic 
assistance to the South Vietnamese peasantry, training an 
offensive guerrilla force, augmenting the regular South Viet-
namese army, increasing military aid, and revitalizing the 
Strategic Hamlet Program. The policy also called for clan-
destine activities conducted by CIA and US Special Forces. 
McNamara forecast that "if we carry out energetically the 
proposals he has made, Khanh can stem the tide in South

Greene, and the Air Force chief of staff, Gen. Curtis LeMay, agreed with McCone's criticism of McNamara's report. Greene wrote that its recommendations "offer 
little more than a continuation of present programs," and LeMay advocated attacking Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia and North Vietnamese supply lines in

ome or tnese undertakings were already underway when 
the NSAM No. 288 policy was promulgated and were sub-
sumed under it. US officials thought the change in govern-
ment in Saigon would create a more hospitable environment 
for operations. The "Big Minh" regime had objected to 
sending Agency officers and US advisers into the countr 
side below the provincial or re imental levels 
The Agency's pacification program emphasized political 
action and propaganda and often experimented with varia-
tions on earlier projects.' As indicated by the gradual 
replacement of the term "counterinsurgency" with "pacifica-
tion," the focus shifted from repressive action against the 
Viet Cong to mobilizing the Buddhist-Confucian lowland 
peasantry to side with the Saigon government against the 
insurgents. The Census-Grievance and Aspiration Program 
was designed to attract the political loyalty of villagers by 
providing an outlet for their complaints on which the gov-
ernment would try to act quickly. It had an intelligence pay-
off as well: during interviews, peasants often identified 
communist cadre. Counter-Terror Teams (later renamed Pro-
vincial Reconnaissance Units) provided a measure of physical 
security by taking the war into Viet Cong safe areas with 
raids, ambushes, and "psywar" ploys. Advanced Political 
Action Teams and Armed Propaganda Teams (later called Peo-
ple's Action Teams and Revolutionary Development Teams), 
like the communists, lived, ate, slept, and worked in the 
countryside to assert the government's presence and demon-
strate its benevolent intentions. These units, eventually 
comprising up to 40 men, provided services to villagers and 
protected them from the insurgents until they were able to 
defend themselves. By mid-1964, more than 1,200 people 
in 17 of South Vietnam's 43 provinces were involved with 
CIA-directed political action teams.)K, 
The Agency's success with pacification depended largely 
on the commitment of the provincial government and the 
efficiency with which the indigenous bureaucracy delivered 
on its promises. CIA's pacification projects had to compete 
for attention from local officials?they ran alongside a 
much larger effort by the Saigon government to assert its 
control in  rural areas through a reactivated Strateaic Hamlet 
Program?
coning to "i iam o y, t e pro-
grams?particularly the People's Action Teams?were more 
effective at neutralizing and eliminating the Viet Cong 
infrastructure than at supplanting it with "positive local 
political institutions to prevent VC reinfiltration and sub-
version." As he later wrote, they "showed inconclusive 
results because they were imposed from above...rather than 
built from below by local efforts" (his emphasis). The 
projects accomplished enough, however, that Ambassador 
Maxwell Taylor and MACV commander William Westmo-
reland (who replaced Lodge and Harkins, respectively, dur-
ing the summer) recommended in August 1964 that they be 
expanded. McCone did not involve himself much in discus-
sions about the pacification program and left its develop-
ment and implementation in the hands of the DDP?

provide some useful insights into the major political 
developments on the Saigon scene, but as most of 
these took place in full public view anyway and at 
such a dizzying pace, they were almost as well reported 
in the press and by the embassy, leaving the Agency 
very little to add.... What's more, the Agency's efforts 
to work with Vietnamese intelligence services to 
improve coverage of the Communists in the country-
side were almost totally frustrated by the rapid 
replacement of the leadership of such services with 
every change in government, and the preoccupation of 
the new appointees with the much more proximate 
danger of yet another coup.4*" 
As with other hard targets, technical means?overhead 
reconnaissance -proved relatively 
more effective than human sources at collecting intelligence 
on the Viet Cong. Since 1962, CIA had flown many U-2 
missions over South Vietnam and parts of Laos and Cambo-
dia to photograph Viet Cong activity. McCone reminded 
the principals, however, that imagery collection faced seri-
ous limitations in a guerrilla war. He pointed out that, even 
with daily coverage, much insurgent activity was undetect-
able from the air. Except for truck convoys, Agency photo-
interpreters had not been able to track enemy infiltration 
into the South regularly and accurately. By April 1964, in 
any event, imagery targets shifted from strategic reconnais-
sance to discern communist intentions, to tactical support 
of counterinsurgency operations as the Viet Cong stepped 
up attacks on villages and ARVN positions.45>r

The Intelligence War: Taking It to the North (U) 
The Agency's worldwide collection program against 
North Vietnam, instituted in 1959, had deficiencies that 
came to McCone's attention at a USIB postmortem on a 
special estimate in April 1964. The estimate had stated that 
"[f]irm information about North Vietnam is extremely 
sparse. Accordingly, analysis... is extremely difficult." 
produced very 
unspectacular results, l.,olby wrote at the time. The DDP 
attributed the intelligence gap to North Vietnam's isolation 
and tight security. A former operations officer with long 
experience in East Asia recalled that "[o]f all of the denied 
area targets at the time [the early 1960s] to include the 
USSR, PRC, GDR [East Germany], North Korea.. .1 
believed North Vietnam was the most difficult target." Not-
withstanding those formidable difficulties in the field, 
McCone ordered CIA officers to do what they could to 
improve reporting.' 
MACV directed and controlled this ambitious agenda 
and created an unconventional warfare unit, euphemistically 
called the Studies and Observations Group (SOG), to carry 
out the US military's assignments. 
President Johnson 
approved the program on 16 January 1964, and it went into 
effect on 1 February. In mid-March, it was assimilated into 
McNamara's policy recommendations that were promul-
gated as NSAM No. 288. OPLAN 34A became the weapon 
the administration used to take the war to the North with-
out overcommitting the United States militarily during an 
election year. As Maxwell Taylor wrote at the time, "It is 
quite apparent that [the president] does not want to lose 
South Vietnam before next November nor does he want to 
get the country into war." Johnson, McNamara recalled, was 
"grasping for a way to hurt North Vietnam without direct 
military action."

be so sensitive that we tied our own hands in fightin this 
war," but the others' diplomatic sensitivities prevailed." 
From the inception of OPLAN 34A, McCone held little 
hope for its success.54 He believed that the missions were too 
limited; that the Viet Cong were already too well established 
in the South for Hanoi's support to them to be influenced 
by "pinprick" operations; and that the record of evious 
missions since mid-1962 was poor. 
e power o t 
government was t e crucia variable, the DCI insisted. 
Unless it established a firm hold in the countryside, expand-
ing clandestine operations in the North would be pointless 
because the Viet Cong "in all probability...would ultimately 
take over" the South. 
It seems obvious to me that unless the Khanh govern-
ment is strengthened...carrying the action into North 
Vietnam would not guarantee victory.... [I]f the 
Khanh government remains fragile.. .and we are con-
tinually confronted with coup plotting and.., if the 
resentment of [the] American presence increases, then 
it appears to me that carrying the war to North Viet-
nam would not win the war in South Vietnam and 
would cause the United States such serious problems 
in every corner of the world that we should not sanc-
tion such an effort,"N 
McCone did not accept the arguments of Rusk and 
McNamara that OPLAN 34A demonstrated American 
resolve. By this time, he had had enough of signals and sym-
bols and did not want Agency resources squandered on ges-
tures. What was needed, he contended, was a "more 
dynamic, aggressive plan" that would reinvigorate the strate-
gic hamlet program, expand pacification efforts, launch 
cross-border attacks against Viet Gong havens in Laos and 
Cambodia, and undertake other political and diplomatic 
initiatives. Nonetheless, although he thought that "no great 
results are likely from this kind of effort," he joined 
McNamara, Rusk, and Bundy in recommending that the 
president approve OPLAN 34A. He had said his piece, and 
More Dark Clouds (U) 
McCone soon had more reason to disagree with the 
Johnson administration's emerging policy of gradually carry-
ing the war to the North. During 7-9 April, he took part in 
a war game called SIGMA 1-64 that was intended to project 
how the conflict would develop over the next decade." (He 
had suggested the objective to the Joint War Games Agency 
in January when the idea of playing a Vietnam game had 
been discussed.) Designed by the RAND Corporation,

56Though McCone did not say so, he also may have objected to the political calculations that were factored into White House decisions to limit US involvement in 
Vietnam during an election year. President Johnson expressed that thinking in a secretly recorded conversation with McGeorge Bundy in March. In response to the 
Joint Chiefs' urgings that the United States "get in or get out" of Vietnam?a position very much like the Da's?Johnson told Bundy privately that he was only a 
"trustee" president, and that "I got to win an election...and then...you can make a decision. But in the meantime let's see if we can't find enough things to do to 
keep them off base and stop these shipments that are coming in from Laos, and take a few selective targets to upset them a bit without getting another Korea opera-
tion started." Transcript of Johnson conversation with Bundy, 4 March 1964, Taking Charge, 267. (U)

place in the spring of 1963. McCone did not participate in the first Vietnam war game held during his directorship, SIGMA 1-62 in February 1962, which pitted a 
US team against a Viet Gong enemy. (Cf. Henry L. Trewhitt, McNamara, 222, which confuses the 1-62 and 1-64 games.) He was scheduled to take part in a coun-

Working With a New Boss (I): McCone, LBJ, and Vietnam (U) 
SIGMA 1-64 was a command post exercise in which the 
players were divided into two teams?Blue (the United 
States and South Vietnam) and Red (North Vietnam and 
the Viet Cong)?each with a policy and an action element. 
McCone headed the Blue Team's policy group, and his Red 
Team counterpart was Maxwell Taylor; they layed Lyndon 
Johnson and Ho Chi Minh, respectively. 
deputy chief of FE Division, and Chester Cooper o ONE 
were the other CIA players in McCone's group; four other 
FE and ONE officers played on the action and control ele-
ments.X 
The rules for SIGMA 1-64 called for Taylor's team to use 
guerrilla strategy and tactics, exploit weaknesses in conven-
tional military doctrine, accept heavy casualties, and under-
mine democratic processes by using propaganda and 
deception. As the game progressed, military and political 
conditions in South Vietnam worsened, and McCone's team 
found its options shrinking to two unpromising alternatives: 
major escalation of conventional warfare or de-escalation 
and eventual withdrawal. The former risked Chinese inter-
vention and repetition of the Korean War, and the latter 
would seriously damage America's credibility and prestige. 
By the end of the exercise, steady escalation and the use of 
massive US air power north of the DMZ had not changed 
either the tactical or the strategic picture. The foundation of 
current administration policy was thus called into question: 
Attacking the North did not save the South. In the game, 
even though the United States eventually deployed 500,000 
ground troops and a large contingent of air and naval forces 
over a period of several years, the communists overran most 
of Laos and controlled most of the South Vietnamese coun-
tryside. Their infrastructure remained intact despite severe 
losses in manpower, and they had overextended and demor-
alized the ARVN. US policy had severe domestic repercus-
sions as well. Antiwar agitation arose on American 
campuses, and Congress prepared to oppose the administra-
tion's handling of the war. (U) 
According to William Sullivan of the Department of 
State, who led the Red Team's action element, McCone 
"concluded that his organization [the Blue Team] ought to 
call it quits and cut its losses." 
The experience of that game made him a dove on 
Vietnam then and forever more. He felt that its pro-
jections were accurate and that the shadows they cast 
before them should be heeded as real. He did not like 
what he foresaw if the US engagement in Vietnam 
continued down that predictable path. 
That observation is not entirely accurate, for McCone 
would soon advocate a much heavier conventional aerial 
and clandestine assault against North Vietnam and the Viet 
Cong. It is correct to say, however, that the game hardened 
his opinion that the United States must do what it needed 
to win the war, or it should pull out and leave the struggle to 
the South Vietnamese. (U) 
One insight McCone did not take away from SIGMA 
1-64 was that heavy bombing of North Vietnam would not 
force it to stop supporting the communist insurgency in the 
South. In a review of the game, two CIA participants told 
the DCI that "[n]o data have as yet been brought to bear 
which convince us that bombing the DRV could be 
expected to have any greater effect on the capabilities and 
will of the enemy than was the case with the French against 
the Viet Minh, a decade ago, or the US against North 
Korea." McCone had very different views on the efficacy of 
air power and would soon become, after Air Force Chief of 
Staff Curtis LeMay, the strongest voice in the administra-
tion for bombing Hanoi into submission (see Chapter 17).58 
>4;( 
Just after SIGMA 1-64 was finished, the DCEs special 
intelligence survey team submitted its second report. Wash-
ington and Saigon, the Dfficers concluded, had 
made progress in developing counterinsurgency programs, 
but both the US and South Vietnamese military remained 
fixed on conventional methods of warfare, and bureaucratic 
inertia and disarray at the middle and lower levels of the 
Saigon government were stifling initiative and innovation.

03041R, box 1, fiJder 9. The record does not indicate whether McCone shared LeMay's criticism that SIGMA 1-64's rules had artificially limited the Blue Team's 
ability to use air power. The outspoken general's objections caused enough controversy that the Pentagon decided to replay the game in September 1964. Even with 
greater weight and flexibility given to the Air Force, SIGMA 11-64 produced similar results and reinforced doubts concerning heavy bombing of the North. McCone 
was invited to participate in the game and showed up for one session. Walter Elder has said that McCone "hated all war games" and grudgingly participated out of 
"innate snobbery when he learned that the other seniors would be there." Prados, Keepers of the Keys, 205-6; Krepinevich, 133-34; Bird, The Color of Truth, 277;

CHAPTER 15 
The survey team recommended that the administration 
increase US advice and support for intelligence collection, 
political and civic action, and psychological warfare pro-
grams, and that disparate paramilitary forces be combined 
and more tightly administered. McCone urged his deputies 
to "button up" the team's work by moving its proposals 
ahead to the NSC's Vietnam Coordinating Committee, 
with the presumption that two of its key members, Sullivan 
and NSC official Michael Forrestal, would endorse them. 
That was done-and the ideas went no farther. The Coun-
try Team viewed CIA warily, and the Pentagon dismissed 
Agency suggestions for better utilizing regular forces." 
In early May 1964, Gen. Khanh's unexpected proposal 
that South Vietnam go on a war footing, evacuate Saigon, 
and break relations with France (because Charles de Gaulle 
had been advocating "neutralization") prompted an urgent 
meeting at the White House with the president, Rusk, 
McNamara, Taylor, McGeorge Bundy, and McCone. They 
decided that McNamara, Taylor, Forrestal, and William 
Bundy should go to Saigon to deal with this sudden devel-
opment. No one suggested including McCone, and his offer 
of intelligence support (in the form of William Colby) was 
not accepted. The secretary of defense returned at mid-
month to report the bleak news that chaos reigned in South 
Vietnam. Viet Cong attacks had intensified, and the Khanh 
government had lost control of more territory despite 
improvements in counterinsurgency operations. To stabilize 
the dramatically deteriorating situation, McNamara pro-
posed a large increase in Saigon's regular and paramilitary 
forces, which in turn would require another sizable incre-
ment in American support.60)K 
President Johnson did not want to widen the war signifi-
cantly, but he was willing to take some risks. How would 
Hanoi and Peking react, he asked the principals, if he autho-
rized retaliatory air strikes against North Vietnam, as Gen. 
Khanh wanted? Taylor did not think the communists' 
responses would amount to much, but McCone sharply dis-
agreed. He warned that neither the North Vietnamese nor 
the Communist Chinese could be expected to sit passively 
while the war's tempo and scope increased drastically. In a 
brief private meeting on 16 May, the DCI told the president 
that, at his direction, CIA's most experienced analysts had 
prepared a comprehensive assessment and concluded that 
the state of affairs in the South was grave. More American 
economic and military aid to Saigon would not solve the 
fundamental problem-Khanh's failure to create a strong 
and stable government. At other meetings, McCone advised 
that there was now at least an even chance that, by the end 
of the year, both Vietnam and Laos "would be very difficult 
to save" unless strong action was taken directly against 
North Vietnam. Committing US ground troops would be a 
political blunder, however, because "[Ole American public 
are fed up with adventures such as the Korean War and 
would not stand for another one." Instead, air attacks 
"would be more decisive...and possibly conclusive," and the 
public would accept them. "If we go into North Vietnam," 
he told the NSC, "we should go in hard." In taking this bel-
ligerent position, the DCI differed with most of his Viet-
nam specialists in the DDP, DI, and ONE, who continued 
to insist that the war would be won or lost in the South, and 
that the best hope for victory lay in improving Saigon's 
political and military performance.61)4(

Working With a New Boss (I): McCone, LBJ, and Vietnam (U) 
McCone joined almost all of the administration's senior 
Vietnam policymakers at a conference at CINCPAC head-
quarters in Honolulu during the first week of June for an 
extensive discussion of the whole situation in Southeast 
Asia.62 Despite all the talk, no major policy decision was 
made. A proposed action plan involving graduated military 
pressures, culminating in limited air attacks against North 
Vietnam, went unapproved. McCone spoke infrequently 
during the three days he was there. When he did, he reiter-
ated his grim view of events and prospects, in contrast to the 
more upbeat Lodge and Westmoreland. He disagreed with 
McNamara about the value of "surgical" bombing. The sec-
retary of defense thought such attacks would convey the 
desired signal to Hanoi whether the targets were destroyed 
or not. McCone thought the passage of a congressional reso-
lution supporting military action would deliver a much 
stronger message and be an "enormous deterrent" to the 
North Vietnamese.A 
The conference ended inconclusively, with US depart-
ments and agencies essentially being told to do what they 
were doing, only a bit more and better. "At best," 
McNamara wrote to the president, during the next three to 
six months, "the situation will jog along about as it 
is... [and] it may continue to deteriorate slowly." A follow-
on meeting of Vietnam advisers, which McCone attended, 
made little additional progress, and without a plan to esca-
late the war, the administration for now dropped the idea of 
getting Congress' formal approval for future military action. 
The president wanted to keep Vietnam out of the upcoming 
campaign. He had no intention of abandoning South Viet-
nam, but he would not expand US involvement, either. For 
now, the current policy would continue, as would planning 
for a wider war in the near future.64>;,, 
McNamara's forecast proved accurate. During the next 
several weeks, the South Vietnamese army won a few minor 
battles but did not seize the initiative in repelling more fre-
quent Viet Cong attacks. Buddhists, Catholics, and students 
resumed antigovernment activity. Rumors of coups swirled 
continuously in Saigon. Gen. Kha_nh, uneasy and insecure, 
publicly urged the United States to "march to the North" 
and complained about the new ambassador, Maxwell Tay-
lor, appointed in late June. Taylor reported in August that 
"the best thing that can be said about the present Khanh 
government is that it has lasted six months and has about a 
50-50 chance of lasting out the year...." In the meantime, 
North Vietnam mobilized its own forces for war, accelerated 
the transformation of the Ho Chi Minh Trail from a web of 
jungle pathways into an intricate logistical network, and 
prepared regular army units for infiltration into the South. 
As of late summer 1964, the administration's policy of grad-
uated pressures against the North and increased support for 
the Saigon government was demonstrably inadequate.65X

63 General Counsel Lawrence Houston had advised McCone that the 1954 and 1962 Geneva protocols on Vietnam and Laos, respectively, did not sanction most of 
the military moves the administration was considering, and even if the SEATO treaty permitted them, he believed that it was politically unwise for the United States 
to engage in direct combat in Southeast Asia without congressional authorization. McCone, "Memorandum for the Record.. .Meeting of the Executive Committee

1964?had no evident influence on administration policy.66 
On the afternoon of the 2nd, three North Vietnamese 
motor torpedo boats attacked the US Navy destroyer Mad-
dox 30 miles off the coast. The Maddox was in international 
waters at the time, but earlier it had been several miles inside 
the 12-mile limit claimed by 
Hanoi, conducting an 
ELINT mission as part of a 
series of patrols, code-
named DESOTO, that the 
US Navy had run in the 
Tonkin Gulf since Febru-
ary. The Maddox and US 
Navy aircraft from a nearby 
carrier sank or disabled two 
enemy vessels. The next day, 
accompanied by another 
DESOTO ship, the destroyer C. Turner Joy, the Maddox 
continued its clandestine collection mission and again sailed 
close to the North Vietnamese coast.X'

occurred and did not return to Washington until the 4th. In 
the meantime, President Johnson kept CIA out of the loop. 
He did not ask any Agency 
officer?not Acting DCI

On the night of the 4th, the US ships reported that 
enemy PT boats were firing on them. Despite subsequent 
confusion on the scene and in Washington about what, if 
anything, had happened, President Johnson?who chose to 
respond to the first attack only with a diplomatic protest?
decided on the 5th to retaliate by sending US planes to 
bomb several North Vietnamese offshore naval installations 
and an oil depot. These airstrikes were the United States' 
first overt punitive attacks on North Vietnam. The presi-
dent went on national television late that evening to justify 
his action: "Aggression by terror against the peaceful villag-
ers of South Vietnam has now been joined by open aggres-
sion on the high seas against the United States." He then 
called on Congress to approve the grandly labeled "Joint 
Resolution to Promote the Maintenance of International 
Peace and Security in Southeast Asia." Soon known as the 
Tonkin Gulf Resolution, it authorized the president to use 
whatever military force he judged necessary against the Viet-
namese communists. Seized by a sense of crisis, Congress 
passed the resolution on the 7th with only two dissenting 
votes. Also that day, the JCS approved a new military opera-

to attend his first meeting 
with key Vietnam advisers 
just hours after the North 
Vietnamese attack on the 
2nd. He did, however, sum-
mon several lower ranking 
military intelligence officers (he later called them "experts in 
technical intelligence") to help interpret intercepted North 
Vietnamese radio messages. At this stage, the president was 
treating the matter as purely military. Agency officers did 
not participate in any meetings on the Tonkin Gulf inci-
dents until McCone gave his first direct advice to Johnson at 
a luncheon meeting on the 4th, attended also by Rusk, 
McNamara, Vance, and McGeorge Bundy. He told Johnson 
that he "favored a dynamic action because the NVN's 
[North Vietnamese] had committed an aggressive act of war 
against us. We were the victims." He urged a forceful 
response even though he and others in the administration 
knew that Hanoi may have been retaliating for OPLAN 
34A raids by American-trained South Vietnamese maritime 
commandos on targets in North Vietnam on 30 July. 
McCone concurred with McNamara's proposal that US 
forces attack four North Vietnamese naval bases, but he 
added that the president should seek a congressional resolu-
tion authorizing the military action, as Eisenhower had dur-
ing the Lebanon crisis in 1958.67 
At an NSC meeting early that evening, however, 
McCone expressed strong reservations about the rationale 
on which Johnson was basing his decision to launch a retal-
iatory air strike. When the president asked him if the North

"StriRc.i4c,, 
Working With a New Boss (I): McCone, LBJ, and Vietnam (U) 
Vietnamese wanted to provoke a war by attacking US Navy 
ships, McCone replied: 
No. The North Vietnamese are reacting defensively to 
our attacks on their offshore islands. They are 
responding out of pride and on the basis of defense 
considerations. The attack is a signal to us that the 
North Vietnamese have the will and determination to 
continue the war. They are raising the ante. 
President Johnson and his advisers did not believe Hanoi 
would be so foolhardy as to challenge the formidable naval 
power of United States and would not have retaliated for 
OPLAN 34A missions because they had been so ineffective. 
McCone, however, judged more accurately that North Viet-
nam's leaders saw the US warships in the Tonkin Gulf as an 
opportune target for telling Washington that they would 
not stand for clandestine violations of their country's sover-
eignty and would not be deterred from pursuing their long-
range goal of unifying Vietnam under their control. At a 
briefing of the congressional leadership at the White House 
immediately afterward, the DCI was disturbed at Rusk's 
"evasive" answers that "left the impression that there was no 
serious overt [US] attack north of the 17th parallel but 
merely some covert espionage and sabotage operations"?in 
short, that the North Vietnamese action was totally unjusti-
fied. "I concluded that the meeting would break up with a 
misunderstanding... [and] I concluded that the group must 
be fully informed." McCone?apparently without consult-
ing the president?then proceeded to tell the legislators 
about the extensive US program of clandestine operations, 
including the raid on 30 July that he believed prompted the 
North Vietnamese attack on the Maddox on 2 August.") 
Within a few days, McCone had cause to question the 
intelligence on which the administration was acting. 
Presumably the 
DDI, whom PFIAB had summoned for an interview, first 
told McCone what he was going to say, especially given that 
the board's chairman, Clark Clifford, was a bureaucratic 
rival and personal antagonist of the DCI. McCone did not 
tell the White House about Cline's reservations, which were 
far from conclusive. On 8 August he read another internal 
assessment although 
fragmentary and ambiguous, it was "highly suggestive that 
action against the DESOTO patrol was contemplated." 
President Johnson knew that meaning was 
debatable and did not hear that CIA had any qualms about 
them until the 10th, when Clifford told him what Cline had 
said. It was a moot point. By then, Johnson had his congres-
sional mandate and was not going to undercut his policy by 
publicly questioning whether the North Vietnamese really 
had launched a second attack. There was nothing for 
McCone to gain by raising the issue, either. As presidential 
aide Walt Rostow would later observe about the Tonkin 
Gulf episode, "We don't know what happened, but it had 
the desired result."69X

CHAPTER 15 
Out of Favor (U) 
Approved for Release: 2015/04/10 001262737 
President Johnson had secured congressional and public 
support for his Vietnam policy, and with the November 
election approaching, he resisted pleas for launching an air 
war over North Vietnam. He had his legislative resolution, 
his approval rating had jumped from 42 to 72 percent, and 
85 percent of the American people supported the punitive 
airstrikes. Not surprisingly, he chose to continue the gradual 
escalation of the US role in the war. "Johnson got involved 
in his quagmire in Vietnam," McCone later observed, 
"because he couldn't make up his mind to win the war. It 
was my philosophy... [that you] don't get in a war if you can 
avoid it, but if you get in a war, then win it. And then settle 
the issues afterwards." Still, neither McCone nor other like-
minded officials in the administration?at this time, 
McGeorge Bundy, Rusk, Westmoreland, the Joint Chiefs, 
and Walt Rostow?could persuade the president that all-out 
bombing of the North would save the South.' (U) 
By then, McCone had already sounded out the president 
about how much he was wanted in the administration. At a 
meeting in mid-June, the DCI suggested that it was time for 
him to leave. According to Walter Elder, Johnson "waved 
this aside, stating that he wanted McCone to remain, cer-
tainly until after the election."' To maintain the facade of 
unity among his advisers and avoid giving his partisan oppo-
nents an issue, he would not let his Republican DCI resign 
so soon before the campaign. For his part, McCone did not 
want to give the GOP candidate, Sen. Barry Goldwater, any 
help. Despite the DCI's conservative views, partisan loyal-
ties, and disagreements with the president, he showed little 
enthusiasm for Goldwater's candidacy for personal and pro-
fessional reasons.' For the time being, McCone was in a 
bureaucratic limbo?on the outside of the White House 
looking in, relegated to the lesser function of purveyor of 
classified information, without a major place in Vietnam 
strategy debates. He had to wait for a more auspicious 
moment to disengage from his increasingly troubled rela-
tionship with Lyndon Johnson.X 
70IvIcCone/McAuliffe OH, 32, 35, 51. (U) 
7' Elder, "McCone as DCI (1986)," chap. 10, 51)fc 
McCone agreed with a journalist's characterization of the GOP's nominee as "lazy" and noted that when Goldwater was in California during the convention, "[h]e 
didn't do anything.... He was up to the Bohemian Grove Ian elite retreat in the redwood forests outside San Francisco], he was out boating, and every picture you 
would see he hadn't shaved." Transcript of conversation with Reston, 9 September 1964, 24, McCone Papers, box 7, folder 11. Also, after President Johnson directed 
that presidential candidates receive intelligence briefings, Goldwater snubbed CIA on the grounds that knowing classified information might "gag" him when he 
wanted to speak about national security issues. He received top-secret DIA briefings, however, in his capacity as a major general in the Air Force Reserve "Goldwa

Working With a New Boss (II): Intelligence Affairs 
under Johnson (U) 
Vietnam and the satellite reconnaissance programs 
took up more of John McCone's time than any 
other issue in the 17 months he served as President 
Johnson's DCI. He spent a fair share of his workday on a 
variety of other CIA and Intelligence Community concerns, 
however. Some of them have been discussed earlier; a few 
other prominent ones will be examined in detail in this 
chapter. In the operational area, McCone was most actively 
engaged with Cuba, the most important target of covert 
action outside Southeast Asia at that time. The most trou-
blesome counterintelligence and security matter he dealt 
with was the search for a Soviet penetration agent inside 
CIA. In addition, he worked hard to improve the Agency's 
public image and reputation at the White House and to 
manage its business on a reduced budget. Lastly, McCone 
continued his efforts to administer community affairs effi-
ciently and to avoid intelligence conflicts with the Pentagon 
at a time when the Vietnam war was straining CIA's rela-
tions with the military.X. 
Easing Up on Castro (U) 
President Johnson and his principal adviser on Latin 
American policy, Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Mann, 
followed the Kennedy administration's anticommunist, pro-
business approach, which sought to prevent social upheaval 
by encouraging economic development. They modified it, 
however, under the so-called Mann Doctrine by deempha-
sizing political reform and overtly accepting military dicta-
torships as long as they maintained order and contained 
subversion. The Alliance for Progress, for example, became a 
conventional aid program and lost the "social justice" con-
tent of the Kennedy administration.' (U) 
"What can I do about Cuba that won't get me in trou-
ble?" Lyndon Johnson asked his national security advisers 
soon after succeeding to the presidency. "The answer is lit-
CHAPTER 
16 
tie," McGeorge Bundy admitted to a colleague afterward, 
"but he [Johnson] needs to be taken up and down the hills 
we've all been on so many times." At first, the new president 
took a Kennedyesque hard line toward Castro. He told 
McCone in late November 1963 that "the Cuban situation 
was one that we could not live with," that the administra-
tion "had to evolve more aggressive policies," and that he 
looked to CIA for "firm recommendations." Accordingly, 
the DCI and the other members of the NSC's Special 
Group authorized CIA to develop among Cuban exile 
groups the capability to stage air attacks against targets on 
the island. At the same time, the Agency continued to iden-
tify military dissidents, build espionage nets, disseminate 
propaganda, and prepare commando strikes on economic 
facilitiesk 
Events soon after President Kennedy's death might have 
driven Johnson into an even more confrontational policy 
toward Cuba than his predecessors. 
In November 1963 the Venezuelan government discov-
ered a large cache of Cuban-origin weapons and explo-
sives on a farm in the northwestern part of the country 
(see Chapter 6). The discovery led CIA to conclude 
that there was now "solid evidence" for a "conclusive 
case" that Havana was trying to subvert neighboring 
pro-US governments. 
During 9-13 January 1964, anti-US riots involving 
more than 30,000 people in several cities in Panama left 
four US soldiers and 24 Panamanians dead, nearly 300 
people wounded, and more than $2 million in property

sumably contributing to the president's belief that the 
riots were Castro-inspired.' 
? In February, after the Coast Guard seized four Cuban 
fishing boats in US waters off the Florida Keys, Castro 
retaliated by cutting off the water supply to the US 
Naval Base at Guantanamo. Americans at the facility 
were in no danger because a contingency plan existed 
for having tankers shuttle water from Florida while base 
residents conserved supplies. 
Notwithstanding these events, President Johnson chose a 
slow and cautious approach to Cuba that stressed multilat-
eral diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions, and he 
played down secret warfare.' The new strategy was to isolate 
Cuba politically and commercially while quietly exploring 
signs that Castro wanted a rapprochement-under terms set 
in Washington.Nt 
At the new administration's first comprehensive discus-
sion about anti-Castro operations, in mid-December 1963, 
the president postponed any sizable covert projects to desta-
bilize the Cuban regime, although he continued to approve 
small-scale covert actions to keep US operatives busy and 
hopeful, even though Johnson thought they were "hypocrit-
ical and ineffectual." For the first few months of 1964, the 
Special Group approved a number of espionage and logistics 
missions into Cuba but rejected or tabled all sabotage pro-
posals. "[T]he pressure [from the White House] for boom 
and bang stopped," recalled Samuel Halpern, the senior 
officer on the DDP's Special Affairs Staff, which was run-
ning the covert operations.' Johnson had several reasons for 
this shift. He wanted to distance himself from the Kennedy 
administration's more adventurous policies. He did not 
want to antagonize the Soviet Union, incite a military clash 
with Havana, or derail US efforts to have the OAS punish 
Cuba for supplying arms to Venezuelan insurgents. Johnson 
also may have feared provoking Cuban attempts on his life, 
having concluded soon after Kennedy was assassinated that 
pro-Castro Cubans were responsible.)L 
Johnson's caution would frustrate McCone. In Decem-
ber, in NSC discussions about responses to the discovery of 
the arms cache in Venezuela, McCone opposed a diplomatic 
initiative and a plan to shadow and search suspect vessels. 
He thought contraband-bearing ships could too easily evade 
surveillance and believed diplomatic efforts would probably 
give Castro "reason to laugh in about three months' time 
over [their] ineffectuality." The DCI did not specify what he 
thought the administration should do about Cuban support 
to regional subversives.6X 
Discussion of the cutoff of water to the Guantanamo 
Naval Base, added to strain between McCone and the presi-
dent. According to CIA, Castro wanted to highlight what he 
regarded as an American "policy of aggression" and show the 
Cuban people and other Latin Americans that he could 
insult the United States with impunity. El jefe maxim? did 
not, however, want to spark a military conflict; according to 
CIA reporting, he cut off the water because it was the least 
provocative of three contemplated reactions to the fishing 
boats' detention-one of which was shooting down a U-2. 
As McNamara observed, "From a military point of view,

Working With a New Boss (II): Intelligence Affairs under Johnson (U) 
we're in no trouble... [but f]rom a political point of 
view.., it's dynamite." The legal aspect of the dispute posed 
no problem?Florida courts would handle it?but the prin-
cipals split over what other action to take. McNamara and 
JCS chief Taylor wanted to dismiss all Cuban employees at 
Guantanamo immediately; Robert Kennedy and McCone 
disagreed, arguing that a mass firing was an overreaction 
that would hurt the wrong people. The DCI added that it 
might prompt similar actions against Americans working 
overseas and that without the economic benefits derived 
from the base employees' salaries, the Cuban government 
might make an issue of the paltry rent the United States 
paid each year (only $3,000) for the facility. Instead, 
McCone proposed that "we go in now and cut the water 
pipes and say that we don't want Castro's water." President 
Johnson told McNamara that he "couldn't understand 
McCone. He's pretty hard-nosed, and I just couldn't find 
out where he was." The president wanted a firmer response 
and decided that the local workers should be fired. "We're 
going to make our base independent of Cuba," he told Sen. 
Richard Russell. The spat petered out in a few weeks. The 
Florida courts released the fishermen-36 went home and 
two stayed in Miami?and Castro offered to turn the water 
back on, but by then the US commander at Guantanamo 
had had the pipe into the base removed/ 
Despite concern on the NSC in early 1964 that the 
immediate threat Castro posed was being overblown, the 
administration launched a massive diplomatic and propa-
ganda campaign in the region, involving CIA assets, to 
ostracize Cuba. It succeeded; in July 1964, the OAS voted 
15-4 to call on member states to break relations and impose 
economic sanctions on Cuba. (U) 
McCone Takes a Stand (U) 
McCone saw no point in persisting with tentative ap-
proaches. If the administration was too concerned about 
"noise" to let CIA carry out and take responsibility for a full 
range of covert actions, "it is not worth proceeding at all," 
he told his senior deputies in January 1964. Underlying 
McCone's irritation was his bleak view of Cuba's prospects 
unless the administration adopted a more belligerent policy. 
He was "convinced that Castro had turned the cor-
ner...would very probably grow stronger... [and] was con-
ducting himself in a manner and carrying out provocative 
acts which had been declared.., totally unacceptable to the 
United States." He told the Special Group that the adminis-
tration's Cuban program was "in complete disarray," and 
that the current and proposed list of covert actions "gave 
Castro maximum grounds for righteous indignation with-
out really accomplishing anything"?partly because "many 
times.. .we have had to stand down actions of this type [eco-
nomic sabotage] in order to avoid raising the noise level." 
The DCI accordingly "felt that all prohibitions and self-
imposed restraints, such as the use of US territory for train-
ing of personnel, launching of provocative acts, etc., could 
be declared void." 
I concluded we had one of two courses to follow: 
either we move in on Castro in the most aggressive 
possible way, accept attribution and destroy him by 
acts of violence short of war or including war if neces-
sary, or, as an alternative, live with him in the hope 
that [P]rovidence might take care of the situation.... I 
felt the latter was a big gamble. 
McCone advised that the United States should undertake 
this new "dynamic action" after warning Khrushchev and 
Castro and informing the American people. Speaking for 
the White House, however, Robert Kennedy said it was 
futile to discuss what CIA would do until the president and 
his advisers made the fundamental decision about whether 
to live with Castro or pursue his downfall.UK 
Before the White House decided on its policy, McCone 
had a flash of insight that foiled a Cuban disinformation 
operation and delivered a strong blow to the Cuban econ-
omy. In early April 1964, he noted reports that Castro was 
scheming to drive up the price of exported sugar?on which 
it depended for hard currency?by trying to create the

impression that Cuba's next sugar crop would be small 
because of hurricane damage. McCone suggested that CIA 
put out an unattributable story exposing the scheme. When 
additional evidence of Cuban manipulation accumulated  
during the month  
epartment of State organized brief-
ings and releases of sanitized information that received wide 
media play. The disclosures caused sugar prices to plummet, 
and they stayed low for several months. Later in the year, 
McCone remarked that he was "particularly intrigued with 
the difficulties the Cubans are having." His idea had cost 
Cuba tens of millions of dollars, a substantial share of its 
foreign exchange.A 
McCone could win no converts to his all-or-nothing 
position on the Cuban covert action program. By April 
1964, the administration?increasingly preoccupied with 
Vietnam and reluctant to upset the Soviet Union?decided 
to stop Agency-controlled sabotage raids and have CIA con-
centrate on intelligence collection. At a White House review 
of Cuban operations, McCone described for the president 
the stark alternatives available to him: deciding whether the 
United States wanted "to bring about the eventual liquida-
tion of the Castro/communist entourage and the elimina-
tion of the Soviet presence from Cuba," partly through 
large-scale clandestine operations, or to "rely on future 
events of an undisclosed nature which might accomplish 
that objective." The DCI contended that the sporadic 
achievements in sabotage did not test the covert program 
fairly. He quoted from an Agency operational plan, prepared 
almost a year before, which stated that "unless all the com-
ponents of this program are executed in tandem, the indi-
vidual courses of action are almost certain to be of marginal 
value.... This is clearly a case where the whole is greater 
than the sum of its parts." McCone met resistance from the 
principals. Secretary of State Rusk spelled out the potential 
diplomatic problems that "noisy" sabotage operations would 
cause; McNamara said the covert program "has no present 
chance of success"; and Bundy noted that because develop-
ments inevitably would force the administration to turn the 
operations on and off again, a comprehensive and rigorous 
program such as McCone urged was not feasible:* 
In effect, the president and his advisers abandoned the 
Kennedy objective of ousting Castro and instead sought to 
harass and contain him. This was a return to the approach 
used in phase one of Operation MONGOOSE two years 
before: espionage, economic warfare, and independent sabo-
tage operations by exile groups. The Special Affairs Staff, 
under Desmond FitzGerald, drew up a comprehensive col-
lection program using expatriate sources, infiltration agents, 
liaison contacts, legal travelers, refugees, and port watchers. 
Training exiles for sabotage missions continued as well, 
although the likelihood that the administration would

Working With a New Boss (II): Intelligence Affairs under Johnson (U) 
approve any such raids steadily diminished.' Through the 
first half of 1964, the administration had grown more skep-
tical about backing militant exiles and warned them against 
staging unauthorized attacks. Policymakers concluded, how-
ever, that withdrawing support and severing connections 
just then was impractical and unwise. The assorted anti-
Castro factions were having difficulty obtaining money 
from non-US sources, and intensive surveillance by US 
authorities was hampering their freelance operations. At 
least for now, the administration decided that cutting off 
backing to the largest recipients-Manuel Artime's Move-
ment to Recover the Revolution (MRR) and Manolo Ray 
Rivero's Cuban Revolutionary Junta (JURE)-would elimi-
nate a potentially useful weapon against Castro. X 
As the autonomous groups' utility diminished, however, 
the Special Group chose to phase out the official relation-
ship. By June 1964, McCone told visiting journalists that 
"no exile activities are permitted which violate neutrality 
laws [,1 such as taking off for a raid from United States 
soil."' The MRR, the Agency's favorite, mounted several 
raids from third countries-which "the United States Gov-
ernment neither encourages nor discourages," McCone 
said-but had its subsidy cut after it created an interna-
tional controversy in mid-September by mistakenly attack-
ing a Spanish ship. Meanwhile, the JURE built a dismal 
record that included "violations of the rules of 'auton-
omy'...major errors in judgment, and.. .lack of success," 
according to the Department of State. Manolo Ray "has car-
ried out his projected operations ineptly and carelessly...he 
1 
has failed in a humiliating and noisy way."4 McCone 
thought the exiles' activities would still be useful if brought 
under greater US control, but the Special Group was too 
jaded toward them to agree, and the DCI conceded that 
Artime was "less and less responsive to persuasion [and] 
constituted a persistent menace." The last raid by either 
group, an unauthorized MRR attack on a fuel depot, 
occurred in February 1965, and Artime's organization began 
disbanding soon after. (Truly autonomous groups-notably 
Alpha 66 and its spin-off, Commandos L-continued to hit 
economic targets such as oil facilities, sugar mills, and facto-
ries, despite American interdiction efforts.)

CHAPTER 16 
Like its predecessor, the Johnson administration sought 
back-channel diplomatic opportunities to complement its 
not-so-silent war against Castro. The president hoped that 
quiet contacts would "keep Castro's temperature and the 
Caribbean noise level at a low pitch between now and [the] 
November [election]," a senior NSC staffer wrote in early 
1964. At the same time, the administration held out few 
hopes that an accommodation with Havana was likely?
largely for the same domestic political reasons. In the post-
assassination climate, given Lee Harvey Oswald's Cuban 
connections and the new president's need to prove his met-
tle against Castro, Johnson could not risk appearing "soft" 
on Cuba. Still, the president did not use Kennedy's death, a 
Soviet-Cuban trade agreement, or Moscow's pledge to aid 
Cuba if the United States invaded it, as pretexts for ending 
the unofficial approaches.' (U) 
Neither did Castro. A week after the Kennedy assassina-
tion, he put out feelers through the same back channel he 
had used before: his United Nations representative, Carlos 
Lechuga; his personal aide, Rene Vallejo; and an American 
journalist, Lisa Howard. CIA reported in February 1964 
that, according to a high-ranking Cuban official, Castro 
"sincerely desires to enter into negotiation with the United 
States." Soon after, Howard brought back from Havana a 
startling offer from the Cuban leader: 
Please tell President Johnson that I earnestly desire his 
election to the Presidency in November.... [I] f there is 
anything I can do to add to his majority (aside from 
retiring from politics), I shall be happy to cooper-
ate.... I know that my offer of assistance would be of 
immense value to the Republicans?so this would 
remain our secret.... 
If the President feels it necessary during the campaign 
to make bellicose statements about Cuba or even to 
take some hostile action?if he will inform me, unof-
ficially, that a specific action is required because of 
domestic political considerations, I shall understand 
and not take any serious retaliatory action. 
The White House did not officially respond to this message, 
so the hands-off diplomacy continued for several months. In 
the early summer, Cuban representatives asked the Spanish 
government to act as a mediator but got no reaction from 
Washington. In an interview with the New York Times in 
July, Castro offered to stop supporting Latin revolutionaries 
if the United States halted exile attacks against Cuba. Lastly, 
Ernesto "Che" Guevara's visit to the United Nations in 
December prompted other indirect contacts between the 
two governments. The Johnson administration did not 
reach a consensus on what steps to take next, however, and 
its intermittent pursuit of detente with the Cuban regime 
stalled. 7 (U) 
As when the Kennedy administration dabbled in behind-
the-scenes diplomacy, McCone adamantly opposed any 
agreement that would help Castro stay in power. He does 
not appear to have been aware of the Cuban leader's offer to 
"help" Johnson in the upcoming election, but he undoubt-
edly would have denounced the idea as fantastical and polit-
ically disastrous if publicized. In October 1964, McCone 
strongly disapproved when James Donovan, the lawyer who 
negotiated the ransoming of the Bay of Pigs prisoners, pro-
posed secretly meeting with the Cuban leader. McCone 
already had told Rusk that "CIA would oppose approaching 
Castro for any purpose except to threaten him if he tam-
pered with our U-2's." The DCI justified this refusal to talk 
by noting that the DDP was convinced that Castro could 
not remain in power for more than 12 to 18 months. "We 
would rather keep tightening the squeeze on him" than give 
Castro some indication that he could bargain with Washing-
ton.18,k

Working With a New Boss (II): Intelligence Affairs under Johnson (U) 
McCone later advised Bundy that instead of entertaining 
the idea of rapprochement with Castro and Khrushchev, the 
administration should "signal" them that "dire conse-
quences" would ensue if a U-2 were shot down over Cuba. 
For months, the DCI had been concerned that the Soviets' 
probable turnover of control of surface-to-air missile sites to 
the Cubans in 1964 raised the odds that a U-2 might be 
shot down (he presumed Castro's soldiers were more "trigger 
happy" than Moscow's men). The U-2 flights were essential 
for finding out what the Soviets were doing in Cuba 
Some administration officials wanted 
to use satellites in place of U-2 flights, but McCone pointed 
out that unpredictable weather, fixed orbits, and resolution 
capabilities limited their effectiveness against the Cuban tar-
get. He had the use of other platforms examined-drones, 
balloons, and the A-12-as well as the idea of mounting a 
satellite camera on an aircraft flying oblique routes. None of 
those options was adopted.' 
In one of his last exegeses on Cuba, McCone suggested 
that even though Castro remained in power, US policy over-
all had succeeded in marginalizing his regime. "Cuba still 
belongs to Castro," he told a Senate oversight committee in 
January 1965, notwithstanding major American expendi-
tures since 1960 to create a viable dissident movement. That 
was only one aspect of the US government's campaign to 
isolate Havana, however, and McCone believed that Wash-
ington had dealt Havana several hard blows by forcing the 
Soviet Union to withdraw offensive nuclear weapons from 
Cuba, publicizing Castro's attempts to subvert neighboring 
governments, and coordinating an international embargo 
on the island. In marked contrast to the fears that US poli-
cymakers expressed just a few years before, the DCI stated 
confidently that as of early 1965, Cuba "does not represent 
any real threat to the security of the United States."20..4**)C 
McCone was not as sanguine about the rest of Latin 
America, however, and supported embarking on a more 
energetic clandestine and counterinsurgency program in the 
region. At the last SGC meeting he attended, on 8 April 
1965, he told the members that the "dangers" south of the 
border required "positive, concerted and prompt action." 
"[T]here is evidence that a policy decision has been made 
[in Moscow] to conduct a more aggressive campaign not 
only in Latin America, but everywhere." At the DCI's 
behest, Desmond FitzGerald outlined for the SGC a general 
plan of intelligence collection, training of local security and 
police services, clandestine interdiction, and deployment of 
paramilitary strike forces and conventional military units. 
After hearing CIA's presentation, the SGC called for a full-
scale review of communist subversion in Latin America and 
the effectiveness of current US counterinsurgency programs 
and for an examination of new ways to assist the security 
efforts of regional governments. 
In a final pronouncement on covert action that he gave a 
few weeks before leaving office, McCone told Rusk that nei-
ther the United States nor its allies were properly organized 
to combat Soviet- and Chinese-instigated insurgency. 
McCone said Moscow and Beijing were exploiting the 
nuclear stalemate to "pursue an aggressive program of politi-

doing in Latin America with Cuba. He urged that the SGC 
be revitalized so that it could formulate a coherent program 
that would involve all relevant US civilian and military 
agencies as well as US allies in Western Europe, South 
America, and the Far East. Rusk agreed with McCone's 
assessment, but nothing was done for the rest of the DCI's 
tenure. Within a few months of McCone's departure, com-
munity analysts judged that "Castro's hold on power is firm" 
and that "there is virtually no chance of his overthrow in the 
foreseeable future. "2 
The Molehunt Widens (U) 
The Kennedy assassination and the defection of KGB 
officer Yuri Nosenko three months later gave new urgency 
to the CI Staff's hunt for the Soviet mole that KGB defector 
Anatoliy Golitsyn alleged had burrowed into the Agency. 
McCone was put in the position of authorizing one of the 
most internally divisive security activities CIA ever under-
took. The argument connecting the assassination and the 
defection hinged on the uncertain reliability of Nosenko's 
assertion that the KGB had had no interest in Lee Harvey 
Oswald when he defected to the Soviet Union during 1959-
62. Nosenko's bona fides had not been established at that 
point and consequently, Soviet complicity in the killing of 
John Kennedy could not be ruled out. If the Kremlin had 
gone so far as to murder the president, it almost certainly 
would attempt to manipulate the investigation to conceal its 
involvement. To do so, the Soviets would use the same well-
placed asset inside CIA that Golitsyn had described earlier 
as part of their "strategic deception" program. In addition to 
purveying disinformation and reporting on how the US 
government was reacting to the deception, the mole would 
support the credibility of a false defector sent to report that 
Oswald had no tie to the KGB. Nosenko suddenly 
appeared, with an unverifiable legend covering the years 
Oswald was in the Soviet Union, supposedly having no con-
tact with the KGB. As Golitsyn had warned, some of 
Nosenko's information on Soviet intelligence activities con-
tradicted his own reporting?including that about a mole. 
The all-too-convenient timing of this second defection rein-
forced James Angleton's suspicion that Moscow had pene-
trated the Agency, and gave the CI Staff chief more reason 
to pursue Golitsyn's leads about the elusive "Sasha."' (U) 
For more than two years, McCone had known about 
Golitsyn's claim that a Soviet mole was inside Langley, and 
he stayed abreast, through Helms and Angleton, of the most 
important aspects of the investigations of individual officers 
during 1962 and 1963.24 McCone did not accept Golitsyn's 
more extreme allegations?
-but by mid-
1964 he believed the threat of penetration was serious 
enough to warrant a systematic examination of the most 
plausible leads with the FBI. Feeding McCone's suspicions 
were continuing revelations of Soviet agents in Western 
intelligence services and investigations or arrests of several 
Americans suspected of or found to be spying for Moscow. 
After hearing Golitsyn allege that at least five Agency staffers 
and contractors, and possibly as many as 30, were KGB 
agents, McCone discussed the matter with J. Edgar Hoover 
in mid-October. That must have been a tough act of intelli-
gence diplomacy, as Hoover was perturbed that the Agency 
had let Golitsyn

Nosenko. Nonethe ess

From November 1964 until McCone left the Agency five 
months later, the HONETOL inquiry was run by a six-man 
committee that included three officers from each organiza-
tion.' Angleton and l of the CI Staff and

Interagencles over resources soon impeded 
HONETOL. as said that McCone would have been 
willing to "go to the mat" with Hoover to keep the joint 
activities going, but the DCI chose to expend his energies in 
his latter days on other issues such as Vietnam and NRO. 
After five meetings of the HONETOL committee between 
November 1964 and February 1965, the FBI concluded 
that Golitsyn was "a disruptive individual, seized with the 
overall theory of penetration and not above fabricating to 
support his theories," and the joint investigation ended. No 
mole was found at CIA during McCone's directorship.2.7N, 
Burnishing the Agency's Image (U) 
During the first several months of the Johnson adminis-
tration, McCone became noticeably more sensitive that 
CIP.'s popular image as a derring-do organization was losing 
its glamour and becoming a political liability to him and the 
Agency. He believed that Allen Dulles and some Kennedy 
administration officials had built up CIA's covert action 
capability at the expense of other functions, such as espio-
nage and analysis?so much so, he told the president, with 
some overstatement, that "my contribution.. .was impaired, 
travel is difficult, [and] visiting foreign countries is practi-
cally an impossibility[,] all to the end [that] neither the DCI 
nor the Agency were serving the President as effectively as 
they could." Johnson agreed, telling McCone that he 
"wanted to do everything possible to get me out of the cloak 
and dagger business... [and] was tired that a situation had 
been built up that every time my name or CIA's name was 
mentioned, it was associated with a dirty trick." Instead, the 
president preferred to emphasize CIA's reporting and esti-
mating functions and minimize public attention to its secret 
operations."* 
Although the alluring "spymaster" persona was ill-suited 
to a staid, blue-suit executive like McCone, he had difficulty 
shedding it at a time when James Bond books and movies 
captivated millions of people and US intelligence services 
spent billions of dollars on clandestine activities. Warning 
his senior deputies in December 1963 that "the year ahead 
will be a rough one for CIA," the DCI grew more worried 
about the Agency's image as his relationship with the presi-
dent worsened. By avoiding embarrassing disclosures and 
fashioning a less controversial reputation for the Agency, 
McCone hoped to retain his and CIA's influence in the 
media-obsessed Johnson White House.29>t 
McCone launched this public relations offensive in Janu-
ary 1964 by informing his senior staff of his "desire to create 
an image' of CIA" that emphasized its "statutory responsi-
bility" for analysis and support to policymakers rather than 
clandestine operations that critics portrayed as improper, 
ineffective, and unauthorized. "This is entirely wrong, both 
with respect to the activity and the coordination and con-

information. Most of the investigations of wrongly accused officers occurred after McCone left. Golitsyn was correct that the Soviets had a mole in the Agency, but  
he turned out not to be as senior or as damaging as feared. \

trol, and I wish to attempt to change this image." McCone 
wanted this effort carefully managed to prevent a recurrence 
of the "CIA press conference" flap described in Chapter 10. 
After that incident, McCone 
established a public relations 
committee under the chair-
manship 
of Lyman 
Kirk-
patrick, 
with Ray 
Cline, 
Richard 
Helms, 
and 
Paul 
Chretien of OPA as mem-
bers. He charged the com-
mittee with reviewing and 
approving all Agency activi-
ties with the media, includ-
ing press notices and 
background briefings. He 
further directed CIA not to 
publicly circulate estimates, 
analyses, and reports in its 
own name and instead to 
coordinate information 
releases with the Depart-
ment of State and the White 
House. Otherwise, he 
declared, "I wish absolutely 
no contact whatsoever, no 
comments, no discussions 
with the press except with my 
personal authorization.' 
In addition to instituting 
the image enhancement cam-
paign, McCone fought back 
at the Agency's critics in 
Congress and the media. In a 
private moment of extreme 
pique, he told a long-time supporter, Sen. Stuart Syming-
ton, that "I am not going to stand for a lot of sons of bitches 
like your friend [Sen. Eugene] McCarthy.. .who want to 
destroy the thousands of people here and what this organiza-
tion does...." "Either I am going to get this thing stopped[,] 
by Goa] or I am going to resign and go out and fight for 
this organization." After venting to Symington, McCone 
relaxed a bit and agreed with the senator that a better 
approach would be to pass 
intelligence information to 
CIAs allies on the Hill?such 
as Symington, Thomas 
Dodd, John Stennis, and 
Henry Jackson?and 
approach them about using 
the material in speeches 
defending the Agency.31) 
A contemporary depiction of the "cloak and dagger" image of 
intelligence that McCone sought to dispel (U) 
A scene from the movie The Adventuress 
Two months later, 
McCone set up what in effect 
was a media "watch commit-
tee." He told Marshall Carter 
"to get a group together 
whose job it will be to devote 
constant effort and atten-
tion, on a daily basis, to the 
task of positioning ourselves 
better to refute, promptly and 
effectively, false accusations 
levied against the Agency in 
the press and in the Con-
gress." McCone "attached 
great urgency" to this effort. 
Members of the task force 
were drawn from the DDP, 
the Offices of Legislative 
Counsel and General Coun-
sel, BNE, OCI, and the CI 
Staff. The group initially 
compiled the eight or ten 
principal charges usually lev-
ied against CIA and then prepared rebuttals for dissemina-
tion to the media and Congress as the occasion arose." 
McCone vividly displayed his defensiveness about CIA's 
image by the outrage he felt over the book The Invisible Gay-

chief as being "not as sensitive to the tricky problem of press relationships as a more experienced press officer might have been." McCone letter to Clifford, 16 Janu-

information. Doing so, Reston advised, would give journalists a sense that CIA was "attempting to be cooperative." Helms memorandum, "Talk with Mr. James

Working With a New Boss (II): Intelligence Affairs under Johnson (U) 
ernment by journalists David Wise and Thomas B. Ross. 
After learning of plans for its publication in mid-1964, he 
and several senior lieutenants orchestrated an aggressive 
damage-preemption and damage-control campaign to sup-
press and discredit the book, which sharply criticized CIA 
and the DCI. This effort at nonlegal prior restraint would 
be the Agency's most forceful ever against anyone other than 
former employees.' McCone's reaction contrasted markedly 
with his tempered response to CIA: The Inside Story by 
American journalist Andrew Tully, which appeared two 
years before. At that time, the DCI opposed having an 
Agency officer publicly rebut Tully's book, which at its worst 
was only mildly disapproving and left some readers 
impressed with the scope and scale of CI.A's enterprises. He 
judged that refuting the book only would draw attention to 
it, stimulate sales, and further damage CIA." By 1964, 
however, McCone had become much more thin-skinned 
about criticism of CIA, wanted to prevent injury to the 
Agency's standing within the administration, and believed 
that The Invisible Government contained many more harm-
ful allegations and revealed far more sensitive information 
than Tully's work. 
Wise, the Washington bureau chief of the New York Her-
ald Tribune, and Ross, a correspondent for the Chicago Sun-
Times, were among the first prominent practitioners of 
"investigative journalism" and already were notorious at 
Langley for their 1962 book The U-2 Affair, about the 
shootdown of Francis Gary Powers's spyplane. The Agency's 
in-house publication, Studies in Intelligence, described that 
"expose" as "another of the recent spate of books which pur-
port to reveal the inside story of secret operations and which 
gain some credence as authentic while intermingling fact 
and fiction without distinguishing between them."' Two 
years later, Wise and Ross followed up with The Invisible 
Government, which contained over 350 pages of extensive 
detail about CIA covert actions in Latin America, Southeast 
Asia, and Europe; the workings of NSA and DIA; and the 
Kennedy administration's national security apparat. The 
book was more than just reportage, however; it argued that a 
secret cadre of officials from the White House, the Depart-
ments of Defense and State, and the Intelligence Commu-
nity ran American foreign policy without accountability to 
Congress and the public. "[T]his shadow government is 
shaping the lives of 190,000,000 Americans.. .out of public 
view...without the knowledge of our elected representa-
tives," according to Wise and Ross.' (U) 
The book was not flattering to McCone personally 
("When he smiles,' a CIA man cautioned, 'look out.'"), but 
what especially riled him was the premise of the title: that 
the NSC's entity for reviewing covert actions, known as the 
Special Group or the 303 Committee, was, in his words, "a 
sinister and powerful organization existing outside the chan-
nels of authority." McCone believed that to achieve their 
purpose of discrediting covert action, Wise and Ross had to 
attack the Special Group/303 Committee, and to do that, 
they had to target the DCI by depicting him as the behind-
the-scenes leader of the US government's hidden foreign 
policy elite. As one of the Agency's internal reviews phrased 
the authors' contention, "the organization set up to control 
CIA's covert action mission has become a prisoner of John 
McCone and CIA, head and heart of the 'invisible govern-
ment." Besides that ominous-sounding thesis, the informa-
tion in the book, the DCI wrote, was "dramatized in a most 
slanted manner," and, whether it had been published previ-
ously or not, "the assembly of all of it under one cover"

"The Agency did not take such concerted action against an author again until in the early 1970s, when it twice went to court to prevent ex-officer Victor Marchetti 
from publishing a magazine article, and to force him to remove classified information from a book he was writing. The two cases upheld the legitimacy of the secrecy 
agreement CIA requires employees to sign. See John S. Warner, "The Marchetti Case: New Case Law," Studies 21, no. 1 (Spring 1977): 1-12. The Agency had no 
such leverage to use against Wise and Ross, and US espionage statutes had not been invoked against the media. (U)

flawed. They portrayed the Agency's energetic use of covert 
action in the past as the current reality, whereas in relative 
terms CIA was now more heavily involved in collection and 
analysis than ever before-in good measure because of his 
own initiatives. Lastly, McCone believed that Wise and Ross 
had deceived him. After meeting 
with them about their book in 
August 1963, he invited them 
back to discuss their work with 
him as it progressed, and 
requested that they submit the 
manuscript for a fact-check and 
security review. They did neither, 
and as recently as late April 1964, 
Wise saw the DCI but did not 
mention the by-then-completed 
book.'

McCone tried to prevent the pub-
lication of The Invisible Govern-
ment. First, he needed to show 
that the book seriously harmed the 
nation's security and was so rid-
dled with errors that it should not 
be foisted on an unwitting public. 
Armed with a "bootleg" copy of 
the uncorrected galley proofs, he 
convened an Agency task force-
with members drawn from the 
DDP, DI, and DS&T, the Office 
of Security, NIPE, the IG, the 
General Counsel and Legislative 
Counsel, BNE, and OPA-to scrutinize the book for mis-
takes, security compromises, and legal violations. The OPA 
staff conducted a separate, more detailed content analysis. 
McCone also directed that every Agency officer mentioned 
in the book comment on the accuracy of the references about 
him.39,1K 
The task force and OPA inquiries found that The Invisi-
ble Government contained over 200 "significant inaccura-
cies" and at least 120 "significant security disclosures" of 
cover organizations, clandestine personnel, operational 
details, or component functions-half of them revealed for 
the first time, and one-tenth of 
them previously known but still 
considered sensitive. Overall, the 
two studies concluded, the book 
represented more of a public rela-
tions problem than a breach of 
security. The OPA analysis stated

Working With a New Boss (II): Intelligence Affairs under Johnson (U) 
erences and using covert assets and sympathetic journalists 
to secure unfavorable reviews. No one thought legal action 
against the authors was justified, although McCone sug-
gested that the writer of another book with the same title 
"be advised very discreetly to bring suit" against Wise and 
Ross for copyright infringement. Some task force members 
thought that because so many facts in The Invisible Govern-
ment had already appeared in open sources, the Agency's 
options were limited and that questioning only some points 
would be misinterpreted as confirming the rest. Richard 
Helms, however, wanted the Agency to take a tough 
approach, writing to McCone separately that publication of 
The Invisible Government should be stopped if possible. 
"This book is a classic case of the whole being a far more 
damaging security erosion than the individual parts which 
compose it." It was, Helms believed, based on a "philosophy 
[that] is equivalent to saying that our activities should not 
exist." The Office of Security tried to find out if Wise and 
Ross had contacted current or former Agency employees 
during their research, but, as had been determined in previ-
ous cases of this sort, the book's information was so widely 
held throughout the Intelligence Community that specific 
sources could not be identified.4IX 
After the substantive review of The Invisible Government 
was done, McCone took several steps to get it spiked or 
revised. He forewarned the president of the book's potential 
for harm and suggested that Johnson refute the "shadow 
elite" notion at a press conference. According to McCone, 
"the President expressed regret that the book was published 
[and] discouragement over the license of government offi-
cials with the press, but didn't seem to know what to do 
about it." With the media starting to snipe at the adminis-
tration over Vietnam, Johnson did not want to get into a 
First Amendment wrangle with journalists and publishers-
least of all with CIA as the focus. The DCI tried to convince 
Look not to serialize the book because it contained "totally 
and maliciously distorted" interpretations and "philosophi-
cally...is just as screwy as it can be." "[It] gives to the Soviet 
propagandists and people like [Ghanaian president Kwame] 
Nkrumah and [Indonesian president] Sukarno and people 
like that just a speech for every night." Look's publisher, 
Gardner Cowles, thought McCone was "unduly agitated" 
about material that had already appeared in print but 
allowed Helms to review the second installment (the first 
had already run) and suggest deletions.'N 
McCone and Carter also complained about The Invisible 
Government to its publisher, Random House, and to the 
publisher of the newspaper that employed Wise, the New 
York Herald Tribune. To the former, McCone passed on-
no doubt agreeing with-the purported observation of 
Dean Rusk that "if the author wrote a memorandum put-
ting everything that's in that book and delivered it to the 
Soviet Embassy, we could put him in jail for life...." 
McCone called and met with Wise and Ross to convince 
them to correct errors and remove statements "that would 
be damaging to the national interest," and he considered 
having the Agency buy all copies of the first edition if the 
publisher agreed to some deletions. The authors stood by 
their work, and the president of Random House, Bennett 
Cerf, replied that he would be glad to sell the first printing 
to the Agency, after which he would order another edition 
printed, and then another, and so on. CINs pressure on the 
publishers had no effect. The book came out unchanged 
and soon rose to the top of the best seller lists-a "gold nug-
get" for Wise and Ross, as McCone had feared.'. 
After The Invisible Government was published, McCone 
acted to gauge and limit its effect. Acting on prior instruc-
tions, DDP stations and bases avoided giving the book fur-
ther publicity or credence by attacking it; when feasible, 
discouraged its publication, sales, and distribution in their 
host countries; planted or stimulated critical reviews in local

media; and reported communist-sponsored attempts to 
exploit it. McCone had copies and a critique of the book 
given to all members of CIA's congressional oversight com-
mittees, and had OPA create a central repository of foreign 
and domestically published material in which Agency per-
sonnel and activities were identified or compromised. Sev-
eral months later, McCone asked BNE for an account of 
how other countries had used The Invisible Government for 
political or intelligence advantage. Nkrumah reportedly was 
"much impressed" by it; Sukarno had ordered copies sent to 
his cabinet; and Pakistani president Ayub Khan was 
"shocked" and hoped nothing such as the book described 
was going on in his country. In the American press, accord-
ing to OPA, two-thirds of the negative coverage stressed that 
CIA was out of control and a threat to democracy, while 
one-third played up Agency ineptitude. In addition, 
McCone declared that "I want to attack the book in the 
reviews" and had a statement drafted that would serve as the 
basis for critiques by CIA contacts in the media and the 
publishing industry. A few of those Agency-generated 
appraisals eventually appeared.444X, 
All these Seventh Floor fulminations only made the situ-
ation worse. They antagonized CIA contacts in journalism 
and publishing, and contributed to the increasingly adver-
sarial relationship between the US government and the 
media over national security issues. In addition, McCone's 
misdirected determination to prevent CIA from getting bad 
press resulted in more negative coverage, not less. Not sur-
prisingly, the "spiking" story leaked, resulting in First-
Amendment-invoking headlines such as "McCone Tried to 
Stop New Book" and "Furious McCone Wages War on 
Book." McCone inadvertently had added a new twist to 
Wise and Ross's tale: CIA not only was sinister, but also 
undemocratic.45 (U) 
After several months, McCone's ire abated. Although he 
strongly believed that The Invisible Government had hurt the 
national interest, he concluded that its overdrawn premise 
about (in his words) a "monstrous, uncontrolled, secret 
action group" undercut the author's credibility. From the 
standpoint of the DCI and the Agency, it would have been 
better if he had reached that conclusion sooner and followed 
his previous policy of media disengagement, letting what-
ever hue and cry the book caused to subside on its own. In 
his judgment, however, at that time in that administration, a 
more combative stance was called for. Moreover, media 
savvy was not a forte of his. As it turned out, McCone and 
the Agency wasted their indignation: There was no sign that 
The Invisible Government affected the White House's regard 
for him and CIA one way or the other.tk 
Despite that experience, McCone stayed in the media 
fray as exposes of CIA multiplied. One of the more discom-
fiting among them was The Bay of Pigs: The Leaders' Story of 
Brigade 2506, by Haynes Johnson of the Washington 
Evening Star, which appeared in mid-1964. Written with the 
collaboration of leaders of the anti-Castro resistance, it con-
tained a startling allegation that seemed to substantiate the 
"invisible government" idea and caused McCone to order an 
internal investigation into the source of the leak. According 
to Johnson, a CIA field officer known as "Colonel Frank"-
true name told members of the Agency's 
Cuban proxy briga e t at his superiors at Langley had 
directed him to disobey administration orders to suspend 
the landing at the Bay of Pigs. With the Wise-Ross book 
selling so well, McCone could not allow the charge that CIA 
would contravene a White House command to go unrebut-
tecl.47 (U)

that he said what the book claimed he had. However, 
according to the inquiry, some Agency field officers thought 
the incident Johnson recounted 
very likely had occurred because 
"Colonel Frank had shown him-
self to be a wild man quite capa-
ble of making the statements 
attributed to him." The investiga-
tion attributed discrepancies in 
participants' recollections to per-
sonal misim-pressions, overzeal-
ous attempts to inflate morale, 
and language difficulties. 
McCone told PFIAB in June that 
the inquiry "turned up only an 
instance or two where in the heat 
of the operations statements were 
made to the effect that the opera-
tion was ready and nothing could 
make it fail." Despite the 
Agency's fears?which the flap 
over The Invisible Government 
probably intensified?The Bay of 
Pigs did not create much of a 
stir." 
McCone involved himself 
with another piece of journalism 
about the Bay of Pigs around this 
time?a proposed article by 
Mario Lazo, a prominent Cuban 
exile writer, in Reader's Digest. At the DCI's request, Helms 
showed Lazo's draft to McGeorge Bundy and said CIA was 
"anxious to see an end to these pieces which simply con-
trived to keep waving a 'bloody shirt' we would like to see 
buried." The DDP told Bundy that Kirkpatrick was going 
to try to get Lazo to withdraw the manuscript because its 
sympathetic tone toward CIA might suggest that the Agency 
was involved in its preparation. After reading the draft, 
Bundy said, "If you can knock off 
the article by a telephone call or 
by a meeting with the author, 
fine. If not, I do not propose that 
we take any further action. After 
all, this article is no worse than 
others which have appeared." 
Bundy's response suggests the 
White House did not believe that 
CIA's image was as easily tar-
nished as McCone thought, or 
that the costs of regularly intrud-
ing into the publishing process 
outweighed the benefits.'

Nevertheless, on two occasions 
in mid- to late-1964, McCone 
dealt with two potentially trou-
blesome articles in Time. In early 
June, the periodical told of an 
alleged CIA operation against 
Cuba launched from Miami. 
Soon after, McCone met with 
Time-Life publisher Henry Luce, 
who had heard that the DCI was 
"very annoyed" with Time's 
"totally false" story that the 
Agency had supported an infiltra-
tion attempt by the Cuban exile 
group JURE led by Manolo Ray Rivero. With the adminis-
tration sharply reducing its support to the anti-Castro expa-
triates, claims that the Agency was still working with them

invasion, 'I have also orders from my bosses, my commanders, to continue anyway." The Bay of Pigs, 76. The back of the book's dust jacket promised that the bri-
gade's commanders would "reveal the whole truth about... [the CIA's] secret plans to countermand White House decisions." One of the Agency's journalistic con-
tacts, Charles Murphy, advised OPA that he thought The Bay of Pigs was "more destructive" to the Agency than The Invisible Government. Johnson presented 
credible detail about a well-known operational failure, whereas "a good deal" of what Wise and Ross wrote was "preposterous." Murphy letter to Stanley J. Grogan,

"on the side" could be politically explosive. Drawing from a 
memorandum prepared by WH Division, McCone per-
suaded Luce to "investigate [the article] thoroughly." The 
story stood, but in spite of its "rogue agency" theme, it did 
not capture the interest of the White House, and the DCI's 
records do not indicate any follow-up on the matter.51k 
Another Time piece in October 1964 hit closer to home. 
CIA reportedly had conducted field investigations on several 
of the president's closest aides (Bill Moyers, Jack Valenti, 
George Reedy, and Walter Jenkins) before granting them a 
special clearance. Concerned that Johnson would think the 
Agency had insulted his trusted advisers or perhaps even 
thought they might be security risks, McCone wrote to the 
president directly about his "distress" over the Time story. 
He tried to assure Johnson that CIA had never considered 
investigating the aides, and that he had ordered the clear-
ances issued to them. McCone added that he could only get 
the Time writer to admit that the source of information was 
not a CIA employee. No detectable sentiment issued from 
the White House?indicating again that McCone was far 
more anxious about the Agency's public relations than he 
needed to be." .1t< 
Besides trying to induce writers and publishers to modify 
or withdraw unfavorable books and articles, McCone also 
contemplated legal action against them if a strong enough 
case could be made. He took some encouragement from a 
New York State Supreme Court decision in 1964 that 
enjoined the movie production company Twentieth Cen-
tury-Fox from showing the comedy film John Goldfarb, 
Won't You Please Come Home? because it misappropriated the 
name of the University of Notre Dame and thereby discred-
ited the school. The court placed a similar injunction on the 
publishers of the book on which the movie was based. 
McCone told the Agency's general counsel to obtain a full 
record of the case and follow the appeals "as it might be that 
law is being made.. .which will be extremely useful to us in 
restraining authors, as well as TV and motion picture pro-
ducers in the improper use of CIA for monetary benefits." 
Agency records do not indicate if any legal action resulted 
from McCone's idea while he was DCI.52 (U) 
Along with trying to curtail journalists' discussion of 
CIA, McCone ordered Agency executives "to reduce press 
contacts to an absolute minimum" and named "controver-
sial figures [in the media] who should be avoided alto-
gether." The strategy that McCone, Helms, Chretien, and 
John Bross of NIPE developed in early 1965 for dealing 
with NBC's proposed documentary on CIA put that atti-
tude into practice. In February 1964, NBC had broadcast a 
White Paper program on the Bay of Pigs affair that criticized 
the Agency, so the DCI and his deputies were on their guard 
when they heard that the network was preparing another 
documentary about CIA.53 They decided that the Agency 
would not collaborate officially on the program (including 
not allowing filming on the Headquarters compound) but 
would afford "unofficial, unattributable" assistance to NBC 
in making contacts and organizing information. Current 
CIA managers would encourage former officers such as 
Allen Dulles and Richard Bissell to appear on the program 
or provide background interviews. Helms wrote that "[t]his 
is the only device open to us for keeping the show from 
being overloaded with commentary from such critics as 
David Wise... [or] Andrew Tully...." (McCone declined to 
be interviewed; he cited his policy against speaking in pub-
lic, and disingenuously claimed that because he "was not so 
sure that the hostile attitudes toward the Agency were seri-
ous or were hurting [it]," there was no point in him appear-
ing on television.) Lastly, CIA permitted two Chinese 
defectors to be interviewed, and arranged for the release of 
U-2 photographs during the Cuban missile crisis and of the 
Soviet Union before 1960. "Since such material 
[aerial photography] has been used on TV before," Helms 
wrote, "it can hardly be regarded as a violation of security 
and would do much to get into the program an aspect of 
intelligence collection which is dramatic and effective."54

Working With a New Boss (II): Intelligence Affairs under Johnson (U) 
NBC broadcast the program, The Science of Spying, on 4 
May 1965, less than a week after McCone stepped down. 
The mistitled documentary had a narrower scope than 
Agency executives had thought, dealing only with CIA 
covert actions in Iran, Guatemala, Indonesia, Tibet, the 
Congo, Cuba, and Laos. It carried interviews with Dulles, 
Bissell, and Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Dulles defended the 
Agency as a vital weapon in the Cold War, and Bissell noted 
that it only carried out missions that the White House 
assigned it. McCarthy complained that CIA had usurped 
Congress' warmaking power by toppling governments at the 
president's behest. The program showed much "local color" 
footage but apparently no material that the Agency pro-
vided. CIA observers concluded that the damage the show 
inflicted "lies not in security breaches but in the editorial 
slant and misrepresentations" made through "clever [film] 
splicing" and "artful editorializing." 
McCone did not make any recorded comments about 
The Science o S in or the effectiveness of CIA's approach 
toward it. of the CA Staff?one of the officers 
most invo ved in developing the Agency's media strategy?
concluded, however, that "we probably devoted too much 
time and thought to the program." In the future, "[w]e need 
a subtle, patient, and carefully planned effort to see that we 
do get occasional positive treatment by TV and other 
media."' McCone's methods?reactive, defensive, and fre-
quently hostile?were proving to be ill-suited for the emerg-
ing era of greater public accountability and journalistic 
scrutiny. ltk 
In addition to this carefully controlled media contact, 
McCone?partly at the White House's suggestion, partly on 
his own initiative?lifted his self-imposed embargo on out-
side appearances and met with selected individuals and sym-
pathetic groups in controlled settings. In September 1964, 
the president asked McCone to travel to major US cities and 
meet with business leaders, publishers, and other prominent 
private citizens to discuss Cl/Vs views on world events and 
"disclose in a discreet manner [its] methods of operation, its 
competence, etc." Johnson believed "showing the flag" 
would offset unfavorable public comments about the 
Agency, particularly those emanating from Capitol Hill. 
The DCI "agreed to undertake this mission" and during the 
next several months met with journalists and corporate exec-
utives somewhat more often than before?to what effect is 
unclear.57,K 
Additionally, in late 1964, McCone attended two outside 
awards ceremonies and delivered remarks at each about 
international affairs and intelligence issues. He gave his first 
public speech as DCI on 14 November at the Catholic Uni-
versity of America, when he accepted the Cardinal Gibbons 
Medal for lifetime service to the Catholic Church. He used 
the occasion to defend CIA against some of the most com-
mon charges leveled against it, to recount some of its fore-
casting successes, and to describe the state of the communist 
world and the Soviet threat. After accepting the Herbert 
Hoover Medal from the American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers on 2 December, he made some general comments 
about world events. These appearances generated no unfa-
vorable publicity and, in a small way, appear to have helped 
put a more benign face on the Agency, at least in some quar-
ters." 
Tightening the Pursestrings (U) 
After President Johnson decreed an economy drive 
throughout the federal government in November 1963, 
McCone directed CIA managers to review their programs 
and budgets thoroughly and propose cutbacks within 90 
days. He also wanted fitness reports for executives at the 
rank of chief of station (or the stateside equivalent) and 
above to include attention to economy as a job element. He

gave his top administrative lieutenants, Carter and Kirk-
patrick, the primary responsibility for developing and carry-
ing out the frugality measures, which were encouraged by 
hallway posters admonishing Agency employees to keep in 
mind that "The dollar you save may be your own!" The cut-
backs included a hiring freeze; a curtailment in expansion of 
some programs in communications, photo interpretation, 
paramilitary operations, SIGINT collection, and research 
and development; and a reevaluation of personnel ceilings, 
overseas activities, and service and support functions. High-
overhead areas such as aircraft and communications opera-
tions were to be managed more carefully. By DCI decree, 
the Agency had to use competitive fixed-price contracts 
wherever practical instead of sole-source or cost-plus-fee 
contracts. If the latter were necessary, incentives were writ-
ten in for contractors to keep down costs.( 
McCone watched the economizing process carefully with 
his businessman's eye. Although he was pleased with the 
early results, he told Carter to "examine 'old Spanish cus-
toms' and eliminate [them] where possible," and urged his 
deputies that "no effort [should] be spared to expedite [the] 
attainment" of new budget and personnel ceilings. "[If any 
Directorate wanted to do something more than they were 
doing," he wrote, "they would have to absorb it within their 
own hide, and if they wanted to take on new responsibili-
ties, they would have to give up something at the bottom 
priority level." He specifically expressed his dissatisfaction 
with the cost-effectiveness of the DDP, telling Kirkpatrick 
that, judging from what it produced, it was too big.' 
McCone and his deputies at CIA met the president's 
economy goals without impairing the Agency's ability to ful-
fill its core missions of intelligence collection, analysis, and 
warnin? After six months, Kirkpatrick reported that a pro-
ould be saved through numerous 
elt-tightenings, especially reducing and real-
locating personnel, closing facilities, and streamlining pro-
duction. 
When McCone left 
Langley, CIA was putting into action what would be known 
later by the catch-phrase "doing more with less."61>c, 
Improving Community Management (U) 
To the end of his tenure as DCI, McCone strived to be a 
true director of the Intelligence Community, looking for 
better ways to carry out his responsibilities as its overseer 
and to improve coordination among its constituent depart-
ments. As of mid-1964, he was still dissatisfied with his abil-
ity to manage it. In his view, parochialism and short-
sightedness persisted. He valued CIA's role as a counter-
weight to policy-driven diplomats and worst-case warfight-
ers, and although he lauded individual community officials 
(such as the director of DIA, Gen. Joseph Carroll), he had 
little good to say about how the armed services ran their 
intelligence operations.

personnel[,] you don't and you can't get the profes-

rather low in priority...the fellows out of the bottom

McCone considered two 
answers to the problem of com-
munity disunity. One was to cre-
ate an assistant secretary of 
defense for intelligence who 
would superintend the collec-
tion and analysis activities of all 
military intelligence entities. 
McCone believed that establish-
ing this office would alleviate 
many of the bureaucratic con-
flicts between the DCI and the 
Pentagon and permit better 
management of tactical intelli-
gence. The other idea was to 
give the secretary of defense 
operational responsibility for the 
military elements in the commu-
nity?

The US Intelligence Board in April 1965 (U) 
while making the DCI the "executive agent" of all 
national intelligence resources?CIA, NSA, NRO, NPIC, 
and FMSAC. McCone saw some virtue in severing the 
DCI's "intimate relationship" with CIA so that he could 
more effectively guide the entire community, but he recog-
nized that the director's dependence on the Agency for staff 
support and nondepartmental analysis made that arrange-
ment unworkable. He compared the British and West Ger-
man intelligence bureaucracies and concluded that the latter 
offered a much better model for the United States. In Brit-
ain, the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee was 
separated from operations, which severely limited his value 
to the prime minister  
CIA and DIA worked well together by 1965, so McCone 
did not give their relations much attention during his last 
months at Langley. He had received evaluations of DLA's

CHAPTER 16 
McCone continued meeting weekly with USIB, which 
was as busy during Johnson's administration as it was during 
Kennedy's. Vietnam, Laos, the Soviet Union, and the Mid-
dle East were the main topics of national estimates and spe-
cial assessments. As discussed in earlier chapters, the board's 
committee structure and responsibilities were changed and 
new procedures for handling compartmented information 
and defectors were instituted under McCone's chairman-
ship. The Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance submit-
ted the most reports of any committee-representing one 
half of the board's output-a reflection of the surging 
growth of technical means in the national intelligence effort. 
Among his final significant actions as head of the commu-
nity, McCone issued several new DCI Directives: a charter 
for the Critical Collection Problems Committee, an impor-
tant vehicle for integrating all-source collection on "hard 
target" countries and problems; terms of reference for the 
USIB Watch Committee and National Indications Center, 
charged with warning of imminent Sino-Soviet Bloc hostili-
ties; and procedures for rationalizing production of nuclear, 
guided missile, space, and economic intelligence.65X) 
In the area of technical security, McCone found an 
arrangement ripe for the sort of consolidation he had 
effected elsewhere, but serious information compromises 
had to be uncovered before the situation was improved. In 
1956, the NSC had set up a Special Committee on Techni-
cal Surveillance Countermeasures a delayed reaction to 
the discovery in 1952 of a sophisticated listening device 
concealed in the Great Seal of the United States hanging in 
the American ambassador's office in the embassy in Mos-
cow. The committee had achieved some measure of interde-
partmental coordination, but as an NSC entity, it was too 
awkwardly positioned between USIB and community com-
ponents to set policy effectively. The NSC abolished the 
committee in late 1964-ironically, after discoveries of 
Soviet audio penetrations of the US embassies in Moscow 
and Warsaw indicated that the current system needed fixing 
urgently.66 In its stead, McCone, with the assistance of 
USIB, was charged with responsibility for coordinating 
technical surveillance countermeasures, and a new commit-
tee was set up for that purpose. Placed inside the now-effi-
ciently running machinery of USIB that McCone helped 
develop, the Technical Surveillance Countermeasures Com-
mittee was able to translate national requirements into 
action-precisely what had been missing in the previous 
countermeasures program. Within CIA, McCone told 
DDS&T Wheelon to mount a major counter-audio 
research and development program.' 
McCone took an especially keen interest in the prepara-
tion of the last annual reports on the community and CIA 
that were written for PFIAB during his tenure. After closely 
reviewing early versions, McCone had the community 
report revised and the "sterile, uninspiring" Agency sum-
mary redone from scratch. He wanted the reports to 
reflect the activities of the community and of CIA 
accurately and comprehensively and to bring out to 
the fullest extent the positive accomplishments of the

its successes in connecting technical collection to analysis. It 
should discuss successful recruitments of agents in place as

The Saga in Southeast Asia Continues (U) 
During his final nine months as DCI, John McCone 
tried, with no more success than anyone else in the 
Johnson administration, to solve the United States' 
Vietnam conundrum: how to fulfill security commitments to 
an anticommunist ally that seemed unable or unwilling to 
bear its share of the burden, without undertaking a costly, 
open-ended military involvement that risked either confron-
tation with the major communist powers or a humiliating 
stalemate, defeat, or withdrawal. As DCI and a member of 
the NSC, McCone contributed to the formulation of US pol-
icy in Vietnam and to CINs role in carrying it out. Though 
regarded as a "hawk" on military issues, his views actually fell 
well within the mainstream of administration thinking until 
he was near the end of his tenure, when he advocated a full-
bore aerial assault on North Vietnam. By then he was outside 
the White House inner circle, and his influence on Vietnam 
matters was insignificant throughout the closing period of his 
directorship. (U) 
Meanwhile, the clandestine war against North Vietnamese 
encroachments into Laotian territory, which had expanded so 
substantially during McCone's time as DCI, was fully subordi-
nated to the larger struggle between Hanoi and Saigon. Presi-
dent Johnson stepped up US paramilitary activities in Laos to 
interdict North Vietnamese infiltration into and operations 
against South Vietnam. The purpose of supporting the Hmong 
and other tribal forces in Laos changed. It was no longer an 
effort to uphold the Geneva agreements and secure Laotian 
neutrality but had become an operation to harass the North 
Vietnamese. Developments in Vietnam would determine the 
success or failure of the covert actions CIA and US Army Spe-
cial Forces conducted with America's Laotian tribal proxies. (U)

operation moved ahead during 1964.1 The United States 
kept resupplying the royalist and neutralist armies, and the 
Hmong force grew steadily in size to 17,000 (with expan-
sion to 23,000 authorized). The Pathet Lao launched suc-
cessful campaigns in central Laos and on the Plain of Jars in 
early and mid-1964. The Hmong again saw action in a tac-
tical role during the summer offensive and for the first time 
received support from US combat aircraft. (CIA-recruited 
American civilians, directed by Agency case officers, flew 
some of the missions; 
American use of other 
tribal fighters in the central and southern regions of the 
country increased. The NSC's Special Group, on which 
McCone sat, in June 1964 approved a plan, submitted by  
the JCS,

attempts to increase the size of the roadwatcher units and to 
use them in tactical operations. CIA insisted on, and 
retained, full control of the activities of Laotian irregulars.

Around the same time, the governing tripartite coalition, 
led by the neutralist Souvanna Phouma, fell apart in spite of 
US support after a military putsch in April 1964 failed and 
the communists withdrew from the government.' In 
August, CIA judged that the situation in Laos "is so fragile 
that it could crumble in any of many ways," such as a Pathet 
Lao counteroffensive or a rightist coup. Souvanna

run the country-eventually reestablished some measure of 
control, and in early 1965 Gen. Phoumi Nousavan-at one 
time the Agency's favored leader-fled to Thailand. The 
battlefield situation became much more active in early 1964 
and then stabilized, falling into a seasonal rhythm of engage-
ment and withdrawal-the "seesaw war," one writer has 
called it-that persisted for most of the decade. The struggle 
pitted 50,000 Laotian regulars and over 23,000 CIA-backed 
guerrillas (Hmong, Yao, and Kha) against perhaps 20,000 
Pathet Lao fighters and about 11,000 North Vietnamese 
soldiers.4 In December 1964, the US Air Force began 
bombing communist strongholds in Laos (Operation BAR-
REL ROLL)-which was in addition to missions already 
being flown by the Lao air force and the US Air Force and 
Navy-and a few weeks later the Ho Chi Minh Trail also 
was targeted. The bombing raised the spirits of the Laotian 
tribal fighters but had little tactical or strategic effect. In 
early 1965, North Vietnam reinforced its troops in northern 
Laos and along the Trail in preparation for its next dry-sea-
son offensive.* 
As the US military presence in Vietnam slowly expanded 
during 1964, McCone worried that the Johnson administra-
tion might be drifting into a commitment to send ground 
troops into Laos to disrupt Hanoi's campaign against South 
Vietnam. Speaking as a policy adviser with insights into 
Republican Party thinking, he told McGeorge Bundy in 
June 1964 that deployment of US forces in Laos "would 
cause consternation throughout the country...not one per-
son in 50 favored such [a] commitment." Even "hardboiled 
spokesmen" of strong action against the North Vietnamese, 
such as Sen. Barry Goldwater and former Vice President 
Richard Nixon, wanted the American presence in Laos lim-
ited to airstrike personnel and materiel. In the DCI's judg-
ment, congressional reaction to sending ground troops to 
Laos would be "infinitely more violent" than the debate over 
a congressional joint resolution supporting the current Viet-
nam policy.6X 
At the same time, McCone urged the administration not 
to make any concessions to the Pathet Lao, battlefield con-
ditions notwithstanding, and to insist that the Laotian com-
munists abide by all the terms of the 1962 Geneva accords. 
The United States had to resist North Vietnam's "salami" 
tactics against both Laos and South Vietnam, tactics that 
were part of its "plausibly deniable' scheme" to "weaken the 
will to resist among the anti-Communists in Southeast Asia 
so that the whole fabric will collapse, leaving the United 
States nothing to fight with or for." The Johnson adminis-
tration must adhere to a consistent, forward-looking policy, 
especially because international pressure probably would 
force it to attend another conference in Geneva, where it 
would be placed at a diplomatic disadvantage. (Informally 
to Robert McNamara, McCone said the United States 
should "move to Geneva from a real position of strength 
with the US fleet pointing at Haiphong. The Secretary of 
Defense agreed.") Otherwise, the DCI told the president, 
"there was a grave danger of us 'sliding down the slippery 
slope' on day-to-day decisions and that we did not have a 
full scenario of actions in view of the military effort that was 
now being made."' 
The reflex to retaliate when the Pathet Lao shot down a 
US reconnaissance aircraft early in June 1964 exemplified 
McCone's point. McNamara thought that the administration 
must stop "talking tough and acting weak," but Marshall 
4 In a cable from Vientiane in mid-May 1964, Ambassador Leonard Unger expressed the sense of frustrated resignation that most US officials in Laos felt at the 
time: 
[O]ur sorry position remains what it always has been.... PL [Pathet Lao] backed by Viet Minh can launch successful push at time and place of their choos-
ing[,] with friendly forces' capability of successfully resisting limited. If we have to live with the situation, and we do unless we want to risk Souvanna's quit-
ting or his and our being caught in violations of the Geneva accords, best we can do is to work thru Meo, Yao, etc., to take advantage of PL extending their 
lines of communication and harass their rear, hopefully causing them to pull back or at least to halt any drive that they may have in mind with the objective 
of reaching to or almost to Mekong...

Carter (speaking for the DCI) objected that a reprisal would 
be "out of sequence" and serve no longer range plan to 
improve the American position in Laos. Instead, McCone 
agreed only that the aerial reconnaissance missions should 
have fighter escorts authorized to return fire if attacked. The 
president, however, approved an airstrike against a Pathet Lao 
artillery site.' (U) 
After late November 1964, CIA's covert war came under 
tighter control with the arrival of a new ambassador to Laos, 
William H. Sullivan. Sullivan had been W. Averell Harri-
man's principal deputy during the negotiations in Geneva. 
"[C]onsidered brilliant by most and tyrannical by many," 
according to a recent history of the Laotian conflict, Sulli-
van had instructions to scrutinize all clandestine activities in 
country. The confrontation soon became known as "Mr. 
Sullivan's War." The popular image of the omniscient, 
omnipotent ambassador?as conveyed in Assistant Secretary 
of State William Bundy's remark that "[t]here wasn't a bag of 
rice dropped in Laos that he didn't know about"?is over-
drawn, as Sullivan had no command authority over US mil-
itary resources needed to support the Laotian irregulars. 
However, the ambassador carefully managed the American 
role in the covert war to maintain the appearance that the 
United States was adhering to the 1962 agreements. He 
resisted MACV's attempts to launch operations from South 
Vietnam using the local  fighters it had taken over from CIA 
under he did not want MACV's Studies 
and Observations Group using Laos as a staging point for 
infiltrations into North Vietnam; and he did not permit the 
Agency to recruit guerrillas from the Hmong living in the 
North. His expectations for operations against the Ho Chi 
Minh Trail were modest: "[a] little intelligence scouting, 
with luck a little sabotage, 
Sullivan believed that CAA operations in 
the Panhandle had the best chance to succeed of any US-
supported ground activity in Laos. In other regards, the 
Agency often found itself in a secondary role, brokering 
31:tfor.vi  
The Saga in Southeast Asia Continues (U) 
relations between Washington, the embassy, MACV, and 
the Agency's tribal proxies to ensure that the latter got what 
they needed to fight the communists.' (U) 
With Sullivan now overseeing covert operations, and 
with Laotian affairs subsumed under the Vietnam conflict, 
McCone largely withdrew from the issue for the rest of his 
directorship. Any complaints he had about the convention-
alizing and bureaucratizing of the clandestine war in Laos, 
and CIA's loss of operational independence there, do not 
appear in the record. The DCI probably realized that after 
a similar Pentagon takeover of paramili-
tary operations in Laos was inevitable, and by this late date 
he was tired of fighting the military bureaucracy. Speaking 
privately to Secretary of State Rusk, however, McCone ques-
tioned whether the US government was properly organized 
to conduct counterinsurgency Too many departments were 
involved, some were not discharging their responsibilities 
properly, and the diminution of the Special Group Counter-
insurgency's role was hampering White House management 
of the disparate programs whose objective was to combat 
communist-supported insurgencies.1? 
loon atter Mcone 
resigned, BNE assessed that the communists were unlikely 
to stir up the military situation in Laos. Since the Geneva 
agreements, they had achieved their main objective there:

men and material into South Vietnam:1X,

Sullivan's abilities highly. McGeorge Bundy credited the "resourceful" ambassador with blocking "an unusually foolish coup" in late January 1965 "by getting a tipsy

South might prompt the Saigon government to negotiate 
with Hanoi. In September, he told the NSC and congres-
sional leaders of the rising influence of southern "neutralist" 
factions that favored talks, and of signs of increasing anti-
American sentiment in South Vietnam. Taking issue with 
Rusk's conjecture that the communists' restraint after the 
Tonkin Gulf raid suggested their wariness and flexibility, 
McCone contended that Hanoi and the Viet Cong believed 
the war was going well and that their guarded reaction was 
tactical; intelligence reports indicated that they were tempo-
rarily shifting to political efforts to exploit divisions between 
southern Catholics and Buddhists. Further concessions by 
the regime to the Buddhists would further alienate the 
Catholics. "The schism between the rival interests is deepen-
ing and could easily precipitate a civil war unless the United 
States is able to exercise a moderating influence and per-
suade the differing parties... to patch up their differences for 
the duration." McCone held out little hope for that, how-
ever. Like McNamara, he believed that "we can squeeze 
through between now [late September] and the next several 
weeks... [but] after the election, we've got a real problem on 
our hands." The situation was worse than under Diem, 
McCone believed, and if Gen. Nguyen Khanh used force to 
suppress opposition, as the DCI thought some officials in 
Washington would encourage him to, then the South Viet-
namese leader would be through. Sen. Richard Russell, the 
Agency's staunchest ally in Congress, informed the president 
in early November that "I told John McCone he ought to 
get somebody to run that country [who] didn't want us in 
there.... Then.. .we could get out with good grace. But he 
didn't take me very seriously."13)? 
As the United States' chief intelligence officer, McCone 
was especially distressed at inadequacies in collection on 
Viet Cong operations?especially the failures of the South 
Vietnamese civilian and military services to detect prepara-
tions for terrorist attacks. 
What concerns me is [the] lack of detailed current 
intelligence on VC locations, activities, and operations 
which make possible recurrent and discouraging 
ambushes. I am at a loss to understand how VC forces 
can assemble in battalion size or greater in geographic 
areas or in the vicinity of communities which are pre-
sumably held by government elements without some 
advance knowledge of the presence of VC being com-
municated to the authorities. I am at a loss to under-
stand how a battalion size attack could occur four 
miles from the Saigon airport without a civilian infor-
mant communicating a warning. In sum, where are 
the Vietnamese Paul Reveres? Obtaining info of this 
type seems to me to be the responsibility of the Viet-
namese civilian and military [services] and I raised the 
question as to whether they are properly organized, 
trained, and motivated, and whether the friendl so 
ulation is in support. I do not believe that 
or MACV can do this, but we must see that it is one 
and done efficiently by the Vietnamese. 
McCone attributed the collection gap to "fear, apathy and 
discontent among the population," and noted that intelli-
gence operations in South Vietnam in general suffered from 
the same disarray that beset military and political activities. 
1 he United 
states soon paid the price of this collection failure. On 
1 November, two days before the election, the Viet Cong 
attacked the American airbase at Bien Hoa, killing five 
Americans, wounding 76, and destroying 27 of 30 aircraft. 
This was the first time the guerrillas had targeted a US 
installation. No warning had been received, even though 
Viet Cong fighters had infiltrated the surrounding area in 
recent weeks. The administration decided not to retaliate 
immediately; "we are inevitably affected by [the] election 
timing," Dean Rusk wrote.14 
'The section heading is taken from Johnson's comments to historian Doris Kearns about the political dilemma he found himself in over Vietnam: 
I knew from the start that I was bound to be crucified either way I moved. If I left the woman I really loved?the Great Society?in order to get involved 
with that bitch of a war on the other side of the world, then I would lose everything at home. All my programs... [a]ll my dreams.... But if I left that war and 
let the Communists take over South Vietnam... there would follow in this country an endless national debate?a mean and destructive debate?that would 
shatter my presidency, kill my administration, and damage our democracy.

Another collection lapse, this time involving North Viet-
namese infiltration into the South, became evident soon 
after the Tonkin Gulf incidents. President Johnson asked 
McCone why North Vietnam had not reacted strongly to 
US retaliatory airstrikes. McCone said Hanoi was waiting 
and watching and probably calculated that the political 
unrest in the South benefited it for the time being. Actually, 
unbeknownst to CIA, the US military, or the South Viet-
namese, North Vietnam had been preparing to deploy 
troops to the South for several months. In September, the 
first full combat units of the North Vietnamese army began 
to move down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. CIA did not report 
the movements until December:5 (U) 
During late 1964 and early 1965, McCone was involved 
in a dispute over collection of statistics on enemy infiltration 
that foreshadowed the controversy analyst Samuel Adams 
was to have a few years later with DCI Richard Helms. 
MACV recently had submitted new figures showing that 
Viet Cong and North Vietnamese infiltration into the 
South was up 250 percent. USIB sent a team to Saigon in 
mid-November to evaluate the numbers, which information 
then available in Washington could not corroborate. The 
team confirmed the much higher figures. McNamara and 
Rusk "expressed great dissatisfaction" with the revision. 
They thought critics of the administration's policy in Viet-
nam would charge that the new numbers were contrived to 
justify military action. McCone ordered the USIB contin-
gent to stay in Saigon until further notice and directed 
Agency officers to thoroughly review all CIA reporting and 
estimates about infiltration, with special attention to how 
affected collection and what influence the 
Pentagon and the secretary of defense had had on estimates. 
McCone wrote that "I am sure [this subject] will assume 
very major proportions over the next few weeks, and there-
fore I want a thorough and careful research job done." New 
assessments of Viet Cong strength by CIA, DIA, and the 
Department of State in early 1965 substantiated the upward 
trend; the revised figure of 50,000 to 100,000 was 50 per-
cent higher than previous MACV estimates. McCone attrib-
uted the increase to MACV's customary underestimation of 
the enemy and to bureaucratic delays in reporting informa-
tion on new communist units. A surprised McNamara 
replied that if the higher figures were true, "we were 'simply 
"StiteftE44  
The Saga in Southeast Asia Continues (U) 
outmanned." At that point, the discrepancy was subordi-
nated to assessment of the impact of the ROLLING 
THUNDER bombing program on enemy manpower 
movements, and McCone did not deal with the matter 
again.16,1K 
Throughout the latter part of 1964, CIA analysts pro-
duced a succession of downcast assessments that McCone 
approved and used in briefings and discussions with policy-
makers. He did not try, as he had in 1963, to modify their 
tone or prognoses. Not only did he agree with their judg-
ments, but he apparently believed that, now more than ever, 
the administration needed to hear the dismal truth. In Sep-
tember, CIA estimators concluded that "the signs of deterio-
ration are so many and so clear.. .that the odds now favor a 
continuing decay of South Vietnam will and effectiveness in 
coming weeks, sufficient to imperil the political base for 
present US policy and objectives in South Vietnam." In 
October, ONE described continued political and military 
deterioration and saw few prospects for improvement. 
Agency officers William Colby and George Carver indepen-
dently weighed in with similar conclusions. A Saigon station 
assessment in December 1964, drafted by George Allen, 
detailed intensifying enemy activity, declining ARVN effec-
tiveness, eroding government influence in the countryside, 
and persistent disunity and instability in the leadership in 
Saigon. Allen's report was not coordinated with other mem-
bers of the US mission, so in early 1965 the administration 
asked for a composite view. In February, Ambassador Max-
well Taylor approved a joint CIA-MACV estimate only after 
deleting discouraging forecasts from the outgoing cable. The 
station sent the original, bleaker analysis to Headquarters, 
where analysts used it when working on later assessments. 
After intelligence reporting in early 1965 indicated that 
Hanoi had dispatched entire combat units (up to division 
size) to South Vietnam, the above scenario repeated itself. In 
the spring, the mission drafted a gloomy assessment; the 
ambassador deleted the worst news from the outgoing cable; 
and the station sent the full text to Langley for analysts' 
use. 
CIA's in-house assessments of Vietnam between mid-
1964 and mid-1965 mostly were on economic subjects and 
came from the DI's Office of Research and Reports. ORR

analyzed scenarios of economic interdiction against the 
North (concluding, for example, that a naval blockade prob-

of North Vietnam and the mechanics of its infiltration of

support of military operations, ORR worked with targeting 
intelligence and conducted damage assessments after 
ROLLING THUNDER began in March 1965. As the anal-
yses accumulated, McCone and CIA were unalterably cast 
in the role of bearers of bad news?news that further 
estranged him and the Agency from the administration, 
while reinforcing its disposition to pursue victory in Viet-
nam.18AL 
What To Do Next (U) 
Administration officials agreed with CIA that conditions 
in South Vietnam had gotten much worse but decided that 
the United States must find a way to prevent a large scale 
political and military collapse there. With a landslide elec-
tion win behind him, and with his frustration over the war 
mounting, President Johnson was willing to entertain more 
venturesome options to buttress the Saigon government. 
Policy discussions during late 1964, to which McCone and 
other senior Agency officers contributed, focused on tac-
tics?what to do?rather than strategic issues?was Viet-
nam vital to US interests; could the United States achieve its 
objectives there; would the region fall to the communists 
without American intervention? The most important venue 
for deliberation in this period was an NSC working group 
headed by Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy and 
including members from the Departments of State and 
Defense, the JCS, the NSC, and CIA (Harold Ford from 
ONE). The president convened the group in early Novem-
ber to prepare a comprehensive new assessment for the prin-
cipals to discuss. During the next few weeks, it established 
the policy framework that the administration followed for 
most of the balance of McCone's tenure.' (U) 
The Bundy Working Group reached a consensus that the 
United States must undertake a gradually escalating pro-
gram of military actions, including airstrikes against the 
North, as a way to coerce Hanoi into negotiating. That 
approach, referred to as Option C in the group's report to 
the president, was deemed preferable either to continuing 
current military efforts (including reprisals against "terror-
ist" attacks) while seeking a diplomatic settlement on any 
acceptable terms ("Option A"), or quickly starting a "sys-

tematic program of military pressures" against a full range of 
North Vietnamese targets ("Option B," also called "a 
hard/fast squeeze"). The latter was considered too risky, rais-
ing the likelihood of Chinese intervention. US officials 
offered several reasons for stepping up American military 
activity: to boost South Vietnamese morale, to give the 
Saigon government a "breathing spell" from communist 
attacks, to interdict infiltration of Northern supplies and 
manpower, to compel Hanoi to stop supporting the Viet 
Cong and begin talking (McCone's rationale), or just to "do 
something" so the United States would not "lose" Viet-
nam?especially after China exploded its first nuclear device 
in October and raised its power profile in the Asian region. 
Option C, according to Bundy's group, had the advantage 
of flexibility: 
The whole sequence of military actions would be 
designed to give the impression of a steady, deliberate 
approach, and to give the US the option at any time 
(subject to enemy reaction) to proceed or not, to esca-
late or not, and to quicken the pace or not. Concur-
rently, the US would be alert to any sign of yielding by 
Hanoi, and would be prepared to explore negotiated 
solutions that attain US solutions in an acceptable 
manner." (U) 
The Bundy Working Group circulated drafts of its pre-
scription among senior administration officials. After 
McCone received his copy, he asked several high-level sub-
ordinates review it. DDI Cline, FE Division chief Colby, 
Abbot Smith of ONE, and R. Jack Smith, head of OCI, 
judged that the North Vietnamese most likely would not 
relent under gradual escalation and that the administration 
should not count on the Saigon government becoming 
strong enough to resist the communist insurgency.21$4 
In its final form, as approved by the president on 
7 December, Option C would be implemented in two 
phases. Starting in early December, covert operations and 
aerial reconnaissance flights north of the DMZ would be 
intensified, and communist infiltration routes inside Laos 
The Saga in Southeast Asia Continues (U) 
would be bombed (BARREL ROLL). After 1 January, an 
escalating series of aerial attacks against North Vietnam 
would commence. (U) 
McCone questioned the efficacy of this incremental 
approach, but he had not yet decided what he thought the 
administration should do. His thinking was in transition, 
driven by growing concern over the shakiness of the Saigon 
government. In September, he had agreed with the low-key, 
reactive policy then under consideration?reprisals against 
Viet Cong terror attacks 
ind the Navy's D.L.SU.I. 0 patrols, and limited South 
ietnamese air and ground operations against the Ho Chi 
Minh Trail. He believed that a sustained air campaign north 
of the DMZ would be too dangerous to undertake then 
because the government of South Vietnam was too weak to 
respond to the increased insurgent activity that might result. 
In addition, Communist China would likely augment its 
assistance to North Vietnam.' (U) 
At the same time, McCone was realizing that the Khanh 
regime probably was unsalvageable. Three leadership 
changes had occurred between mid-August and early Sep-
tember, and several more would follow by early 1965?
prompting Chester Cooper, an ONE officer on detail to the 
NSC, to remark later that "Khanh and [Gen. Duong Van] 
Minh checked in and out of their offices in the Presidential 
Palace like traveling salesmen at a commercial hotel." A dis-
tinct note of despair sounded in McCone's private com-
ments about the fate of the South. In early October, he told 
Ambassador Sullivan, "I often wonder if what is really 
involved here is an erroneous concept that we in this coun-
try, by pouring in thousands of people and a hell of a lot of 
money, could train them [the South Vietnamese] and 
encourage them and inspire them to fight." "You almost 
have to say that the outlook is hopeless," he lamented to 
some journalists several weeks later. "Mou just hang onto a 
little thread of hope that this government put together by 
this Council of Elders will take form and will get off the 
ground, and with civilian leadership and with Khanh devot-

ing himself to the military there might be some improve-
ment. But that's an awful thin hope, I believe."23,X1 
Those reservations notwithstanding, McCone joined the 
consensus on Option C, at least temporarily. By late 
November, he thought that if the administration started 
heavily bombing the North, the American public and the 
United States' allies would react with "anger, sorrow, and 
disgust." Any aerial attacks in retaliation for Viet Cong ter-
rorism must target their infiltration and supply infrastruc-
ture (lines of communication and depots, for example) and 
keep collateral damage to an absolute minimum. The DCI 
also thought that "going big" risked reuniting the commu-
nist world, then in some disarray because of the Sino-Soviet 
split. He doubted, however, whether the Viet Cong insur-
gency could be brought under control quickly even if North 
Vietnam stopped supporting and directing it. He told the 
principals that the residual communist threat in the South 
was "much greater and much more difficult" than the upris-
ing the British faced in Malaya in the early 1950s and "infi-
nitely more serious" than the Hukbalahap rebellion that the 
United States helped the Philippine government quash a few 
years later. It would take the United States 10 years and 
major military and economic assistance to South Vietnam 
to stamp out the Viet Cong, he contended.A 
A Fork in the Road (U) 
"By the end of January [1965]," historian George Her-
ring has written, "the major argument against escalation [the 
Saigon government's failure to govern] had become the most 
compelling argument for it." The administration aban-
doned the concept of securing stability in the South before 
expanding US military involvement in the North and 
instead saw escalation as the preferred way of achieving 
some measure of political order in Saigon. Heavy bombing 
above the DMZ and deployment of American combat 
forces in the South, in William Bundy's words, "would have 
some faint hope of really, improving the Vietnamese situa-
tion." In late January, McGeorge Bundy and McNamara 
informed the president that "[b]oth of us are now pretty 
well convinced that our current policy can lead only to a 
disastrous defeat.... The time has come for harder choices": 
either negotiate a way out, or use whatever military force is 
needed to prevail. Just over a week later, Bundy returned 
from South Vietnam to report that "[t] he prospect in Viet-
nam is grim. The energy and persistence of the Viet Cong 
are astonishing." "[W]ithout new US action defeat appears 
inevitable.... There is still time to turn it around, but not 
much." The United States needed to adopt a policy of "sus-
tained reprisal.., against any VC act of violence to persons or 
property." Air and naval attacks on North Vietnam must be 
gradual and related to the military struggle in South. "The 
object would not be to 'win' an air war against Hanoi," but 
the operations nonetheless would be continuous to exact the 
maximum political value. "Even if it fails, the policy will be 
worth it." There was little alternative, recalled Chester Coo-
per, who accompanied Bundy. "There was a general disposi-
tion after we were there for a few days to feel that...either 
we had to get out or do something more than we were 
doing."' (U) 
McCone came to that conclusion a bit sooner, having 
advised the president and the secretary of defense some 
weeks before that the United States had no chance of 
accomplishing its objectives unless it substantially increased 
airstrikes against the North and began low-level ground 
actions to check enemy infiltration into the South. Well into 
1964, the DCI had doubts about how effectively massive air 
attacks on the North would hamper the communist insur-
gency in the South. Eventually, however, like other key 
administration policymakers, he stopped worrying as much

Christmas Eve 1964, when scar bomb exploded in Saigon outside the Brinks Hotel where US military officers lived. The attack killed two Americans and wounded 
58 other persons. McCone advised the president against retaliating because Viet Cong culpability was too hard to prove. "Memorandum of Briefing of President

about the strength of the Saigon government and decided 
that the best approach was to go all out with Option B. The 
South would not, and probably could not, save itself, so the 
United States had no choice but to "go big" against the 
North. Even if a viable government were established in 
Saigon, the DCI said, the United States "could not win the 
way we were going" and must take "more dynamic 
action.. .a systematic series of attacks...starting in the south 
sector of North Vietnam and...work[ing] toward the 
north... [a] strike every day or at least every second 
day.. regardless of what the Soviets say or what the Chinese 
Communists say or what anybody else says."' (U) 
In taking that position, McCone differed with several 
senior Agency officers who advanced unsolicited opinions 
about the effect bombing would have on the North. Will-
iam Colby thought expanding the war might cause a con-
frontation with Beijing. The head of FE Division's Vietnam-
Cambodia branch bluntly called bombing a "bankrupt" 
move. Peer de Silva, the COS in Saigon, believed an air 
campaign would only provoke Hanoi into sending more 
troops down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Ray Cline thought US 
bombing would at best only buy time for South Vietnam. 
Lastly, Harold Ford told McCone directly that US policy in 
Vietnam was "becoming progressively divorced from reality" 
and that the "brave, resourceful, skilled, and patient" com-
munist enemy would not be beaten into negotiations. 
"[T]he chances are considerably better than even," Ford 
wrote, "that the US will in the end have to disengage in 
Vietnam, and do so considerably short of our present objec-
tives." McCone did not respond to this litany.' (U) 
Instead, the DCI justified his view strategically with the 
domino theory, to which he steadfastly held despite ()NE's 
judgment that it was untenable. McCone told the Senate 
Armed Services Committee in January 1965 that "if we 
pulled out of Vietnam.. .there would be a serious deteriora-
tion in Southeast Asia, and I think it would extend to Cam-
bodia, to Laos, to Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.... [lit 
The Saga in Southeast Asia Continues (U) 
would mean the acceleration of the communist movement 
throughout Southeast Asia." The reason was that the con-
flict in Vietnam "is no civil war. This is a straight Commu-
nist-directed guerrilla effort designed to remove the free 
thinking people of South Vietnam from any position of 
authority and take it over for Communism." That was why 
establishing a stable, popularly based government in the 
South was so hard. The communists were gaining control of 
more rural areas "not because [the peasants] are embracing 
the purposes of Communism, but because they are just war 
weary and tired and they just don't want to be shot at when 
they are out in the rice fields and will compromise almost 
everything to avoid that.' 
McCone's belief in the utility of heavy bombing probably 
drew on two experiences. As a member of the President's Air 
Policy Commission during 1947-48, he heard testimony, 
read reports, and participated in discussions on the decisive 
importance of air power in World War II. While he was 
under secretary of the Air Force during 1950-51, SAC's doc-
trine of strategic air power, so forcefully expounded by its 
commander, Gen. Curtis LeMay, dominated US policymak-
ers' thinking on the subject. In addition, the Korean war had 
provided to some observers a real world lesson in the effect 
an aerial onslaught could have on an adversary's will to resist. 
With the ground war at an impasse and covert operations 
accomplishing nothing, heavy bombing of military and civil-
ian targets was the only way to take the war to the enemy. 
Many Americans believed that large-scale bombing of dams 
in North Korea in the summer of 1953 had forced the Com-
munist Chinese and North Koreans to stop their diplomatic 
obstructionism and last-minute terrain grabbing and agree to 
a truce. The Air Force chief of staff in 1953, Gen. Hoyt Van-
denberg, summed up the attitude when he warned senior 
officers at the Air War College to "keep our eye on the goal 
of air power, which is to knock out the ability of a nation to 
fight." By the early 1960s, the Air Force's doctrine writers 
had outlined a role for strategic aircraft in low-intensity con-
flicts?a theory with which McCone agreed. To him, a stra-

tegic air campaign, run without regard for immediate tactical 
considerations, was essential for countering an externally 
supported insurgency of the scope that the Viet Cong were 
waging in South Vietnam." (U) 
Some policy realism also contributed to McCone's advo-
cacy of using strategic air power against the North. President 
Johnson would not pull the United States out of Vietnam, 
so the DCI argued for what he judged to be the most effec-
tive use of America's military capabilities?one that would 
exploit its technological superiority and economic resources 
while avoiding the commitment of a large ground force to a 
land war in Asia. South Viet-
nam as a proxy force was too 
weak to resist the Viet Cong, 
and covert operations across the 
DMZ could not help except 
very marginally. Massive air 
attacks against the North, how-
ever, would shift the arena of 
military combat from the 
South, where the position of 
Washington and Saigon was 
weakest, to the North, where 
the leadership in Hanoi would 
risk having its economy 
destroyed unless it capitulated. 
Capping the argument, Agency 
analysts had told McCone that 
such bombing would not elicit a 
major military response from 
North Vietnam's communist 
allies, and the Intelligence Com-
munity had judged that Hanoi 
probably would respond to 
intense American airstrikes by 
ordering the Viet Cong to temporarily suspend attacks in 
the South. Accordingly, "I'd go win this one," the DCI told 
the president. "I'd do whatever was necessary to win it."' 
(U) 
McCone's advocacy of heavy bombing moved him out-
side the administration consensus and made him seem like a 
hawkish counterpart to the solitary "dove" in the Vietnam 
policymaking circle, Under Secretary of State George Ball?
whose persistent argument for withdrawal and negotiation 
has led one biographer to label him the president's "in-house 
hair shirt." This McCone-Ball analogy is largely accurate.

use of "strategic air warfare," defined by Air Force doctrine writers as 
Air combat and support operations, designed to effect, through the systematic application of force to a selected series of vital targets, the progressive destruc-
tion and disintegration of the enemy's war-making capacity to a point where he no longer retains the ability or will to wage war. Vital targets may include key 
manufacturing systems, sources of raw material, critical material, stockpiles, power systems, transportation systems, communication facilities, concentrations 
of uncommitted elements of enemy armed forces, key agricultural areas, and other such target systems.

The only prominent decisionmakers to agree with the DCI 
were the JCS, but even they were divided on the issue in 
private. Despite the popular stereotype that they were anx-
ious to blast North Vietnam to rubble, the service chiefs dis-
agreed on the utility of an all-out bombing offensive against 
the North. None of them doubted that the United States 
would enjoy air superiority north of the DMZ or that 
bombing would inflict serious damage on enemy military 
and economic targets. Only the Air Force and the Marine 
Corps, however, believed that a sustained campaign of heavy 
bombing would force Hanoi to suspend support for the Viet 
Cong. The Army and Navy were unconvinced. Despite 
these disagreements, however, and to present a united front 
to the White House and the public, the service chiefs kept 
their doubts about strategic bombing off the record and rec-
ommended using the US bomber arsenal in an escalatory 
way (Option C). In that context, the hawk McCone was 
almost as alone on his own limb as the dove Ball was on 
(U) 
President Johnson, who had no historical experience with 
heavy bombing, resisted using it all-out against North Viet-
nam. In September 1964, he declined to authorize an 
intense aerial attack on the North; McGeorge Bundy wrote 
at the time that "in [the president's] judgment the proper 
answer to those advocating immediate and extensive action 
against the North was that we should not do this until our 
side could defend itself in the streets of Saigon." As late as 
December 1964, he complained to Ambassador Taylor that 
"[elvery time I get a military recommendation[,] it seems to 
me it calls for large-scale bombing. I have never felt that this 
war will be won from the air."' (U) 
By mid-February 1965, however, the president moved 
toward a more aggressive posture. Lethal Viet Cong attacks 
against American facilities at Pleiku and Qui Nhon and 
another change in government in Saigon in mid-February

The Saga in Southeast Asia Continues (U) 
forced him to concede that there probably never would be 
enough order in the South to justify waiting to intensify 
military action. "Johnson's highest priority for Vietnam" 
then, according to historian Robert Dallek, "was to settle on 
a well-defined, consistent policy that held out prospects of 
ending the conflict and convincing people that he knew 
what he was doing." He told his advisers that he "had kept 
the shotgun over the mantel and the bullets in the basement 
for a long time now," but "cowardice has gotten us into 
more wars than response has." In the president's judgment, 
limited, sustained bombing, escalated according to how 
Hanoi reacted to it, stood some chance of forestalling both a 
communist victory and a divisive domestic debate?the lat-
ter almost assured if he ordered a ground offensive. But 
Johnson was still planning to practice "flexible response" 
and not deliver the full force of American air power. "We 
face a choice of going forward or running," he declared. 
"We have chosen the first alternative. All of us agree on this, 
but there remains some difference as to how fast we should 
go forward."" (U) 
The president's decision on 13 February to begin ROLL-
ING THUNDER marked a turning point in US policy, 
despite his claim that "we seek no wider war." A campaign 
of regular bombing attacks went well beyond the "tit-for-
tat" reprisal strikes that had been the practice since the 
Tonkin Gulf affair. The scope and intensity of the bombing 
would increase gradually, use of napalm was authorized, and 
pilots could strike alternative targets without prior approval 
if they could not reach their original destinations. Over 100 
US and South Vietnamese aircraft?the largest number 
used on one day up to then?flew the first missions on 
2 March against an ammunition depot and a naval base. In 
April alone, 3,600 sorties hit fuel dumps, bridges, muni-
tions factories, and power plants across the DMZ. "The air

A Final, Futile Push (U)

To McCone, ROLLING THUNDER was no solution. 
Instead, he regarded it as just the kind of graduated, reac-
tive, politically calculated approach that he never thought 
would work in Vietnam. "We must not lose sight of our 
purpose," he told the NSC, "[which is] to help [the] South 
Vietnamese win freedom from Communist aggression.... 
[This goal] should not be compromised for collateral rea-
sons." Tentativeness had been the problem with US policy 
in Vietnam since 1961, McCone contended. By moving in 
American military forces gradually without a defined pur-
pose, "kin some ways we lifted the responsibility for the sit-
uation off the shoulders of the South Vietnamese, but we 
didn't provide the muscle to put it on our own shoulders." 
This incremental approach left the United States vulnerable 
to the charge that it was practicing "just another form of 
colonialism" and was not truly interested in preserving 
South Vietnam's right of self-determination. McCone con-
ceded that strategic bombing might cause North Vietnam to 
launch a "burst operation" against the South to quickly 
defeat its army, topple its government, and force out US 
troops. He thought, however, that if Hanoi judged that the 
bombing was threatening its economy, it would curtail guer-
rilla operations in the South "and wait for a sunny day, mak-
ing some pretense at negotiations." He told the president 
that most USIB members agreed with that conclusion, espe-
cially if airstrikes were flown more often than planned under 
ROLLING THUNDER and hit targets above the 19th par-
allel in the heart of North Vietnam.35)k 
McCone opposed deploying US ground troops to South 
Vietnam and did not want the administration to use Viet 
Cong attacks on American facilities there to justify doing so. 
Disagreeing with the Pentagon's conclusion that US installa-
tions in the South could not be protected from guerrilla 
raids without sending a large contingent of combat troops, 
he directed the DDP to develop a plan for establishing 
informant networks around American bases to serve as "Paul 
Reveres" if the Viet Cong tried to launch attacks like the one 
on Pleiku. He feared that if the joint US-South Vietnamese 
intelligence apparatus could not discover such activity 
nearby, a bigger surprise?North Vietnamese or Chinese 
intervention, or a massive Viet Cong uprising, for exam-
ple?might occur. The shock undoubtedly would produce 
calls from inside and outside the administration for a big 
buildup of ground forces. McCone consequently charged all 
departments represented on USIB to step up collection 
efforts against North Vietnamese targets and to give "the 
closest attention... to every available indicator, no matter 
how tenuous." As DDCI Carter passed on McCone's direc-
tive to the Agency, "We all need to remain cool and objec-
tive but... [y]ou can't afford to ignore any report, no matter 
how wild it may seem.. .It is absolutely essential that the 
analysts state their requirements... [and] be in the closest 
touch with collectors...."' 
The Intelligence Community's mixed record of working 
the North Vietnam target indicated how formidable a task 
the DCI was asking it to perform. 
twice as many communist 
prisoners of war were under interrogation at any given time 
than in the previous year, more aerial reconnaissance mis-
sions were being flown, and COMINT and HUMINT 
reporting had increased somewhat in volume if not in qual-
ity. The Agency had little success, however, at inducing 
defections by Viet Cong or North Vietnamese army person-
nel or in debriefing travelers to the North, and much report-
ing through US military channels was either redundant or 
unreliable.) 
CIA's other clandestine activities in Vietnam offered little 
to hearten McCone during this time, either. 
so the Agency's pacification 
programs?the Folitical Action, Counter Terror, and Cen-
sus Grievance Teams?languished. The CIA-run propa-

FE Division officer at the time; "there are insufficient con-
sideration, insufficient personnel and insufficient funds 
devoted to psychological endeavors." Moreover, 
McNamara's interest in OPLAN 34A faded in 1965 once 
US bombing began and US ground forces landed. In his 
judgment, the struggle had become a conventional conflict, 
and what he later called the "trifling efforts" of 
MACV-SOG could contribute little to its success. istori-
ans Kenneth Conboy and Dale Andrade have summarized 
this line of reasoning: "Rather than spending months pre-
paring for the insertion of a sabotage team armed with a few 
rockets, American planes could now rain down thousands of 
times more explosives during a single afternoon."' 
The NSC still wanted to use the "quiet option," however, 
so in response to its request, McCone submitted a much 
expanded covert action plan to complement the strategic 
bombing of the North that he was pressing the administra-
tion to undertake. Drafted by the DDP, the 12-point pro-
posal included extending support to political, labor, farmer, 
and student groups; expanding political action teams in dis-
puted areas; organizing Montagnard self-defense units and 
assisting local partisan groups; expanding harassment teams in 
Viet Cong-held territory; and developing irregular elements 
to locate, infiltrate, and seize enemy communications sites. 
The plan, McCone advised the president, would "improve 
the viability of the [Saigon] government.. .promote cohesion 
within the South Vietnamese military structure...encourage 
[the] South Vietnamese people to support their government 
and...participate more actively in the defense of their coun-
try" McGeorge Bundy thought CIA's proposal "should be 
explored urgently." The administration adopted some aspects 
of the Agency plan, but, 
The Saga in Southeast Asia Continues (U) 
assigned implementation of most of 
them to Army Special Forces. When Bundy raised the idea of 
recreating CINs defunct Civilian Irregular Defense Groups, 
McCone demurred. "[I] t was probably too late... the effort 
had gone past the point of no return...[and] more or less 
eroded away" The embassy and MACV opposed the pro-
gram then and would do so now zould not 
be reversed. When Bundy asked McCone if he had told the 
president about the problems with the turnover, the DCI said 
he had not because "it would be construed as 'bureaucracy 
and parochialism." Bundy chided him for that reasoning, 
saying "it would be too bad to lose the game out there and 
then have us say 'If you'd only done it our way we wouldn't 
have lost." Asked if that was fair to the president, McCone 
simply replied that "the decision had been made and could 
not be reversed."' 
In his last month as DCI, McCone made several 
attempts to persuade Johnson and his Vietnam policy cote-
rie not to let the United States get drawn into a slowly esca-
lating conflict, especially on the ground. His basic point in 
this final effort was the same as before: Hit the enemy fast 
and hard with devastating aerial firepower to make them 
immediately feel the cost of a protracted struggle and scare 
them to the negotiating table. ROLLING THUNDER as 
currently implemented, he told the NSC, was having little 
or no effect on the North Vietnamese. "Hanoi remains 
unconvinced that they [sic] cannot win out militarily They 
are not yet ready to negotiate." He did not oppose commit-
ting ground troops, only a piecemeal engagement unsup-
ported by a major escalation of the air war?particularly 
massive airstrikes north of the DMZ.' (U) 
Clandestine missions under OPLAN 34A and the US Navy's DESOTO patrols, briefly suspended after the Tonkin Gulf incidents in August 1964, had resumed 
in September under NSAM No. 314. After another supposed North Vietnamese attack on US destroyers in the Gulf on 18 September, President Johnson halted the 
DESOTO patrols. Later that month, the 303 Committee decided to review monthly mission plans under OPLAN 34A to avoid conflicts such as had occurred in 
late July and early August when sabotage attacks and ELINT patrols had overlapped. NSAM No. 314 (untitled), 10 September 1964, and Bundy memorandum to

The Agency's proposal was one of several multifaceted plans that US military and civilian officials developed around then. When Ambassador Taylor was faced with 
implementing a 21-point military program, a 41-point nonmilitary program, a 16-point US Information Service program, and CIA's 12-point program, he cabled 
McGeorge Bundy that US policy seemed to be fashioned "as if we can win here somehow on a point score." Quoted in Leslie H. Gelb with Richard K. Betts, The

The day before McCone presented the covert action plan, a Viet Cong car bomb exploded outside the US embassy, killing two Americans and 20 Vietnamese and 
wounding 200 persons. A CIA secretary was among the dead, and COS Peer de Silva was partially blinded. McCone arranged for a special medical evacuation flight

CHAPTER 17

By then, policymakers knew McCone's refrain by heart, 
and the president was losing confidence and trust in him. 
Recently in private, Johnson had described him as someone 
"that might get offboard later" and should be 
"view[ed] ...very carefully." The president, despite his own 
doubts about the war ("I don't see any way of winning"; 
"there ain't no daylight in Vietnam"), was set on his course. 
Convinced that overwhelming air power could not prevail 
("[a]irplanes ain't worth a damn") and that American 
ground forces must be sent in, he tuned out McCone, who 
believed just the opposite. With criticism of the administra-
tion's limited airstrikes already emanating from some quar-
ters of Congress, the media, and the public, and with the 
president needing to keep political support for his far-reach-
ing domestic program, McCone's more belligerent position 
was untenable anyway. The DCI seemed to know this. As 
political dissent and social discontent grew inside the 
United States, he realized that the United States would get 
caught in a contradiction if it went all out to defend South 
Vietnam from falling to communism. America was trying to 
be "a shining beacon to the world... [but] unless we look 
inwardly and straighten up some of the problems here, as 
long as we have a situation so deteriorating... [a]s long as 
we've got these race problems, as long as we've got crime, as 
long as we've got the youth problems.. .we can't serve as that 
beacon."' (U) 
McCone persisted, judging that the harm Vietnam's fall 
would cause to US national interests outweighed other con-
siderations. After a meeting of the NSC on 1 April 1965, at 
which Johnson approved a gradual escalation of airstrikes 
against the North and an active combat role for US troops 
in the South, McCone circulated a memorandum to Rusk, 
McNamara, Bundy, and Taylor in which he argued vigor-
ously that the measures were too little, too late. The "slowly 
ascending tempo" of bombing had not improved the situa-
tion on the ground but had made the communists more 
intractable and increased the likelihood of Soviet or Chinese 
aid to North Vietnam. If the airstrikes did not achieve mea-
surable results soon, the administration would face growing 
domestic and international pressure to call them off. 
"[T]ime will run against us.. .and I think the North Viet-
namese are counting on this." A large but ultimately fruit-
less commitment of US ground forces appeared almost 
inevitable to the DCI unless the administration changed 
tactics. 
I think what we are doing is starting on a track which 
involves ground force operations which, in all proba-
bility, will have limited effectiveness against guerril-
las.... [F]orcing submission of the VC can only be 
brought about by a decision in Hanoi. Since the con-
templated actions against the North are modest in 
scale, they will not impose unacceptable damage on 
it.... [O]ur proposed track offers great danger of sim-
ply encouraging Chinese Communist and Soviet sup-
port of the DRV and VC cause if for no other reason 
than the risk for both will be minimum.... We will 
find ourselves mired down in combat in the jungle in 
a military effort that we cannot win, and from which 
we will have extreme difficulty in extracting our-
selves.... [I]f we are to change the mission of the [US] 
ground forces, we must also change the ground rules 
of the [air]strikes against North Vietnam. We must hit 
them harder, more frequently, and inflict greater dam-
age. Instead of avoiding the MiGs, we must go in and 
take them out. A bridge here and there will not do the 
job. We must strike their air fields, their petroleum 
resources, power stations and the military com-
pounds. This...must be done promptly and with min-
imum restraint.' (U) 
McCone strongly disputed McNamara's proposal in 
mid-April 1965 that US bombing stay at its current level

that the bombing campaign had not curtailed North Vietnamese military activities significantly. Gen. Earle Wheeler (chairman, JCS) memorandum to McNamara,

for in the Pentagon's schedule in late April was not enough. Department of State telegram to Embassy Saigon, DEPTEL 2397, 22 April 1965, ibid., 602. (U)

McCone's connections to the Kennedys showed in January 1965 when he complained that the late president's loyalists were accusing him of using the DCI to blame 
John Kennedy for the Vietnam stalemate. "[T]hey have these little parties out at Georgetown.. .they had a party last night.. and the Kennedy crowd decided that I 
had framed up [sic] to get [the] Armed Services [Committee] in the Senate to call McCone to put the Vietnam War on Kennedy's tomb. And that I had a conspiracy 
going on to show that it was Kennedy's immaturity and poor judgment that originally led us into this thing." McCone did not make such a statement to the com-

and more US ground troops be 
sent to the South. (The first 
3,500 Marines had landed near 
Da Nang on 8 March, and more 
Marines, authorized to conduct 
offensive operations, deployed 
to Hue in April.) The secretary 
of defense said increased deploy-
ments were necessary to protect 
US forces already there and to 
release South Vietnamese troops 
to fight elsewhere. According to 
the DCI, McNamara's plan 
changed the purpose of the air-
strikes on the North. Instead of 
being the principal means of 
forcing Hanoi to negotiate, they 
would become just another tactic of harassment and inter-
diction. McCone argued that the communists could absorb 
present damage, that economic targets in the North must 
also be hit, and that US ground force deployments must be 
part of a coordinated strategy to intensify pressure against 
the North on all fronts. Lacking such a strategy, the United 
States would face a "slow...deliberate...progressive" com-
munist buildup that "would always confront us with an 
increasing demand for men, increasingly serious problems, 
and increasing casualties." The Johnson administration had 
several strategic options in Southeast Asia to choose among 
in early 1965, some more politically feasible than others. 
McCone's preferred course may have been no more likely to 
succeed than the few that were considered, and there was no

compelling historical case in 
favor of unlimited bombing. 
The most that can be said 
with certainty about the 
approach he promoted is that 
the Johnson administration 
never tried it.44)tc 
On his final day as DCI, 
28 April 1965, McCone gave 
President Johnson a letter 
summarizing his views on the 
drawbacks of limited air-
strikes, the tenacity of the 
communists in achieving their 
long-term goals, and the 
likely political and diplo-
matic consequences of failing to achieve progress soon. "I 
am not talking about bombing centers of population or kill-
ing innocent people," he assured the president. "I am pro-
posing to 'tighten the tourniquet' on North Vietnam so as 
to make the communists pause to weigh the losses they are 
taking against their prospects for gains. We should make it 
hard for the Viet Cong to win in the south and simulta-
neously hard for Hanoi to endure our attacks in the north." 
After hearing McCone make his case one more time, 
Johnson "accepted the letter and placed it on his desk with-
out comment." McCone concluded his dealings with the 
administration on Vietnam by observing afterward: "I per-
sonally feel this is as far as I can go or, for that matter, as far 
as the Agency should go in this matter."45X

President Johnson authorized the deployment of two more Marine battalions and a Marine air squadron on 6 April in NSAM No. 328. The NSAM also directed an 
increase in logistics forces in preparation for larger ground deployments, and expanded the mission of US forces from base security to include active combat. NSAM 
No. 328 was highly secret, distributed only to Rusk, McNamara, and McCone?the minimum needed to carry it out. The president warned them to avoid "prema-
ture publicity" about the new deployments and mission. Implementation "should be taken in ways that should minimize any appearance of sudden changes in pol-
icy, and official statements on these troop movements will be made only with the direct approval of the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State." "illhese movements and changes should be understood as being gradual and wholly consistent with existing policy." NSAM No. 328 (untitled), 6 April

Vietnam, January?June 1965, 613-15. McCone?with his successor, Adm. William Raborn present?made the same points to Rusk, who deflected the suggestion 
by saying that McNamara, Bundy, and he had considered the Das views but decided to hold to the present course. McCone, "Memorandum for the Record...Dis-
cussion with Secretary Rusk...," 27 April 1965, McCone Papers, box 2, folder 16. The day McCone stepped down, Sherman Kent prepared a memorandum for the 
president, with which OCI and FE Division concurred, supporting the basic points of McCone's 28 April letter. Kent, "Comment on Mr. McCone's Views of 28 
April 1965," DCI Files, Job 80R01580R, box 16, folder 341,4%. 
McCone's continual pressure for heavier bombing of the North had one unintended effect within the Johnson administration: convincing Clark Clifford to oppose 
continued escalation. In May 1965, President Johnson asked Clifford to read a private letter in which McCone argued that putting more troops on the ground 
required a big increase in airstrikes. According to Clifford, "the powerful internal logic of McCone's arguments helped me clarify my thinking," and he advised the 
president against sending more ground forces to Vietnam. Clifford, 409-10. (U)

Transition (U) 
J
ohn McCone's frustrations as Director of Central 
Intelligence mounted so substantially during the first 
several months of 1964 that by mid-year he had 
decided to resign?perhaps imminently. Throughout 
his professional career he had been used to controlling the 
organizations he was responsible for, and he was not accus-
tomed to answering to overseers or to competing for influ-
ence with equally assertive rivals while wrestling with 
seemingly insoluble problems. He had captained his engi-
neering and shipbuilding enterprises largely as he had seen 
fit, and at the Department of the Air Force and the AEC he 
had wielded command over focused organizations dealing 
with a relatively narrow range of issues and activities and a 
limited constituency of patrons and interests. As DCI, in 
contrast, McCone lacked formal authority over most of the 
massive and diffuse intelligence bureaucracies that he nomi-
nally directed, and he did not secure the political resources 
in the White House and Congress that would have enabled 
him to exercise the power he sought. He reportedly told an 
aide: "I've been trying to get [President] Johnson to sit down 
and read these papers [the Agency's annual estimates of 
Soviet strategic intentions]. When I can't even get the Presi-
dent to read the summaries, it's time for me to leave.' (U) 
In addition to these institutional and political limita-
tions, McCone gave several specific reasons for resigning. 
His influence in policymaking circles was declining at the 
same time public criticism of CIA was reaching new levels of 
intensity. The "frightful" and "sickening" Invisible Govern-
ment episode, as he described it, particularly disheartened 
him. He confided to a congressional friend in May 1964 
that "I took this job over to try and build it [CIA] up and if 
the attitude around town is to try and knock it down.. .1 
have got a wonderful home in Pasadena and I am not going 
to stay here for 30 minutes [more]." A few weeks later, he 
told President Johnson for the first time that he wanted to 
step down soon, saying that he believed he was getting too 
old to run a large government agency. Speaking in confi-
CHAPTER

dence to a trusted journalistic contact several months later, 
McCone outlined the bureaucratic and political aspects of 
the job that dissatisfied him. 
[T]here's a great many facets [sic] of this job that are 
quite out of character with me.... I like to be able to 
discuss what fm doing more freely than I can... and 
I'm very, very sensitive to a responsibility for an 
agency and for the work of a lot of dedicated men and 
then have them beaten up unmercifully, and unfairly, 
and incorrectly, and be unable to answer back.... This 
is the kind of thing that wakes me up at 3:00 [in the 
morning]...some of the things that are said are just 
absolutely incredible. 
Lastly, McCone wanted to devote more attention to his 
business interests, which since the late 1950s he had run in 
his spare time, and to his and his wife's personal lives.2>< 
The Search for a Successor (U) 
McCone recalled that his initial offer to resign in mid-
1964 "changed the intimacy of the relationship [with Presi-
dent Johnson] .... I could feel it in a hundred ways." Despite 
their personal and policy differences, however, the president 
tried to dissuade the DCI. To avoid creating any political 
problems for the administration, McCone agreed to stay on, 
but only until after the November election. In October, he 
apparently thought he was being rehabilitated. The presi-
dent asked McCone to accompany him to Herbert Hoover's 
funeral in New York on the 26th. According to a CIA offi-
cial who worked with the DCI, he "was as excited as a kid 
with a new toy." Johnson's gesture was a partisan calculation, 
however; he figured that as the administration's most promi-
nent conservative Republican, McCone should appear at the 
funeral of the doyen of the GOP's Old Guard. Despite the 
lengthy discussion the DCI and the president had while

traveling, the trip did not lead to a warming in their rela-
tions.' 
Afterward, Johnson did not try very hard to find a suc-
cessor to McCone. In mid-December, the DCI reminded 
the president that he had offered his resignation six months 
before and had agreed to stay only past the election. It was 
time to think about a new DCI, he told Johnson. Rumors of 
McCone's departure were circulated in the press, along with 
names of possible successors (including Roswell Gilpatric, 
Cyrus Vance, Nicholas Katzenbach, Maxwell Taylor, Paul 
Nitze, and Henry Cabot Lodge). McCone complained that 
the president "hasn't done a damn thing about it [replacing 
him]?except he talks to Clark Clifford during lunch some 
days."'Nr 
At a meeting with Johnson in late February 1965, the 
DCI took the initiative by submitting a list of 15 candidates 
and telling the president when he would be leaving. Johnson 
replied that he had four names under consideration (he did 
not say which) and would decide soon. In the meantime, he 
wanted McCone to remain until 1 May. The DCI replied 
that 1 April or earlier would suit him better. As a compro-
mise, the president proposed that McCone stay until the end 
of April but feel free to be away from Langley as much as his 
personal business required. CIA was efficiently organized and 
well-managed, and Marshall Carter had run it well in 
McCone's absence before, Johnson remarked.5*, 
Who did McCone think should succeed him? He 
believed an intelligence professional probably would be best 
suited for the job. He did not want the White House to 
demean the position of DCI by filling it with a patronage 
appointment like "some hotshot businessman or chairman 
of the Democratic National Committee in the State of Col-
orado." Nor did he think a military commander, unless pos-
sessed of unusual abilities, experience, and independence 
would be appropriate because CIA might become "a tool of 
the Pentagon." He doubted that an experienced civilian 
public servant with aspirations to become secretary of 
defense, secretary of state, or ambassador to a major Western 
European country would want to risk tarnishing his reputa-
tion by serving in the controversy-ridden post. Accordingly, 
although he personally preferred an outsider?intitially Gil-
patric, then Acting Attorney General Katzenbach?
McCone recommended Richard Helms ("superb") and Ray 
Cline ("a man of very great intellectual capacity"), with, 
according to Walter Elder, a nod toward Helms. McCone 
thought Lyman Kirkpatrick, the executive director and 
comptroller, would be "a hell of a good manager" but that 
his disability would diminish his influence and convey an 
image of reduced vitality. ("[E]very time an emergency is 
called...when the cameras are around at the White House 
doors, if the Director of Central Intelligence has to pull 
himself into a wheelchair...I think that would be bad.") 
Regardless of his successor's resume, McCone believed the 
new DCI must have a very close relationship with the presi-
dent?"that if the President was home at eleven o'clock at 
night and got to worrying over some development in South 
Vietnam, or what[ever], would call him up and say, 'Jump 
in your car and come down here and sit beside me on this 
bed, because I want to talk about this before I go to 
sleep'"?in short, just the opposite of what McCone had 
with Johnson. 
Much of the search for McCone's successor was con-
ducted by PFIAB Chairman Clifford and John Macy, 
former head of the Civil Service Commission, who joined 
the White House in late 1964 as a presidential "talent 
scout." Besides the intelligence careerists, Clifford and Macy 
considered defense establishment pillars such as Taylor and 
Gilpatric. McCone told McGeorge Bundy and Dean Rusk 
that picking Taylor "would be very damaging" because of 
the general's long history of conflict with the Agency  
While 1 knew Taylor 
well and tavorably, McCone said, "no appoint-
ment...would be more harmful to the Agency...." Other 
names floated in the press included Joseph Carroll, the 
director of DIA, and William Bundy, the assistant secretary

of state for Far Eastern affairs. As of mid-March, McCone 
said he still did not have the slightest idea whom the presi-
dent had in mind. At the end of the month, he recalled 
some years later, Johnson called him and talked about a 
retired US Navy admiral named William Raborn. In early 
April, however, Johnson was still privately vetting new 
names, such as Burke Marshall, 
an assistant attorney general con-
cerned with civil rights, and 
David Bell, the director of AID.' 
>I( 
Like almost everyone else at 
CIA, McCone was stunned to 
hear on 11 April that Johnson 
had selected Raborn. The admiral 
was a party loyalist from Texas, 
had managed the Polaris subma-
rine program, and enjoyed good 
rapport with Congress. At his 
staff meeting the following morn-
ing, McCone's voice and counte-
nance evidenced his displeasure, 
although he did not comment on 
the appointment. Several years 
later, he termed Raborn?with 
whom he had worked when the 
AEC was involved in nuclear-
powered submarines?"an unfor-
tunate choice... thrown into a job 
he wasn't really equipped for.... 
[Alt no time would I have consid-
ered him for that post." McCone observed that the DCI 
"[hadl to be kind of an operational manager and play some-
Transition (U) 
requiring "a different kind of mentality" from that of "a 
hard-driving, technical man" like Raborn. Beyond the 
White House's lack of consultation and Raborn's apparent 
unsuitability, McCone had reason to take the admiral's 
nomination as a personal slight. As intelligence historian 
Christopher Andrew has noted, "[b]y appointing Raborn, 
Johnson showed that he rejected 
McCone's style of leadership and 
was more interested in curbing 
the CIA's independence than in 
improving the quality of its intel-
ligence. He saw in Raborn a reli-
ably compliant DCI whose 
administrative efficiency would 
ensure that the [A]gency did not 
rock the presidential boat."' 
McCone and Adm. William Raborn (U) 
During the brief transition, 
McCone took Raborn on cour-
tesy calls around Langley and 
Washington to introduce the 
admiral to CIA officers, adminis-
tration officials, and congres-
sional overseers. The DCI also 
brought Raborn to some morn-
ing staff meetings to acclimate 
him to the daily flow of business 
at the Agency. Meanwhile, 
McCone's work pace slowed as he 
prepared to step down. He sat for

Richard Helms speaks at the farewell dinner for McCone and Carter on 26 April 1965. 
(U) 
McCone met with President Johnson alone for the final 
time as DCI on the day of Raborn's swearing-in, 28 April 
1965. McCone reiterated his belief that the president 
needed to receive personal intelligence briefings and not rely 
only on written reports, and he recommended that Raborn 
brief attendees of the Tuesday Lunches. Johnson agreed and 
indicated that he would work out some arrangement. 
McCone then urged the president to give to Raborn a letter 
like the one John Kennedy issued in January 1962 affirming 
the DCI's leadership of the Intelligence Community and 
role as the president's chief intelligence adviser. Johnson "felt 
this would be in order," and subsequently discussed the sub-
ject with McGeorge Bundy:* 
Leaving the Oval Office, McCone joined a large CIA del-
egation at Raborn's installation ceremony at the White 
House. As President Johnson lauded his new DCI, "tears 
were coursing down [the admiral's] crimson cheeks and 
forming tiny drops at the point of his 
chin," R. Jack Smith recalled. McCone's 
reaction to his successor's public display 
is unrecorded. That afternoon, the now-
former DCI hosted a luncheon for USIB 
and the following day left for California. 
After President Johnson received the first 
briefing from Raborn, he made it clear 
that their relationship would not be like 
the one he had had with McCone. The 
president ended their meeting by saying 
in exasperation, 'And, I'm sick and tired 
of John McCone's tugging at my shirt 
tails. If I want to see you, Raborn, I'll 
telephone yourli*C 
A Public Retirement (U) 
The limitations of Raborn's leadership 
soon became the stuff of corridor legend 
at Langley. An anonymous Washington 
wit summed up the Agency's recent his-
tory by observing that "Dulles ran a 
happy ship, McCone ran a tight ship, 
and Raborn runs a sinking ship." Perhaps out of fear that 
the admiral's substantive and managerial shortcomings 
would undo much of what he thought he had accom-
plished, McCone continually offered the DCI unsolicited 
advice on intelligence policy and administrative matters 
large and small. His business interests (as chairman of the 
Hendy International Company and as a member of several 
corporate boards) brought him to the East Coast regularly, 
and two or three times during his first year of retirement he 
came by Headquarters to counsel the reluctant Raborn. On 
those occasions, the Agency provided McCone with services 
customarily given to former directors, including a limousine 
and an intelligence briefing.' (U) 
R. Jack Smith, then the DDI, was the hapless victim of 
McCone's hard-charging habits during one visit. Suffering 
from a bad cold, Raborn told Smith that he did not want to 
see McCone or anyone else and left the DDI to "handle the 
I? McCone letter to Johnson, 26 April 1965, and McCone memorandum, 'Discussion with the President alone on 28 April 1965...," FRUS, 1964-1968, =II, 
Organization and NIanagettient of US. Foreign Policy..., 500-502. McCone and Johnson did not discuss the crisis in the Dominican Republic that was about to 
erupt. Nt

problem." Meeting McCone at Dulles Airport, Smith said 
neither Raborn nor Helms was at Langley and that the car 
would take the former DCI downtown. Without respond-
ing, McCone directed the driver to go to Headquarters. 
After they arrived and had taken the elevator from the exec-
utive garage to the seventh floor, Smith tried to steer his 
guest to his offices, but McCone turned toward the DCI 
suite, and, writes Smith: 
sailed into the Director's outer office at flank speed 
and without breaking stride opened Admiral Raborn's 
closed door and walked through. The Admiral sat at 
his desk...clutching a piece of Kleenex. Before he even 
sat down, McCone had already said, "Admiral, there 
are a couple of things I want to take up with you." I 
stood behind him silently indicating my helplessness. 
As I retreated in chagrin I met Dick Helms coming in 
the doorway, and my defeat was complete. As I 
explained to both men later, I could not have stopped 
John McCone from confronting Admiral Raborn that 
day except by a hard tackle below the knees." (U) 
At other times, McCone conveyed to Raborn his 
thoughts on "the very serious erosion of public confidence 
in CIA because of unwarranted attacks which unfortunately 
go unanswered"; suggested opportunities for the admiral to 
request intelligence studies and streamline the reporting 
process; proposed that the DCI portraits and autographed 
photographs of the presidents be moved to more visible 
locations; and offered to help Raborn deal with a proposed 
investigation of CIA by the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. In 1966, he urged Raborn to travel to Vietnam, as 
he himself had twice, to get a firsthand look at the political, 
military, and intelligence situation there." (U) 
The Agency retained McCone as a consultant until 1973. 
In 1966, he worked with CIA in responding to a request 
from the New York Times that he review a draft article criti-
SCPC.40.7/ 
Transition (U) 
cal of the Agency. He recommended that the Times not run 
the report and then proposed many editorial changes, some 
of which were made. According to Harrison Salisbury of the 
Times, "McCone's intervention had not weakened the series; 
it had reinforced it because his views had been tested and 
the stories rechecked and strengthened in the light of his 
observations." McCone also periodically offered advice to 
then-DCI Richard Helms. In 1967, for example, he briefed 
Helms on Mideast oil matters and asked him to pass on to 
the administration an idea for establishing a buffer zone 
between Egypt and Israel. Helms disagreed with the concept 
and presumably did not convey McCone's notion to the 
White House.15X 
In 1973, McCone asked CIA to terminate his consul-
tancy after his involvement in the Agency's covert action in 
Chile in 1970 came under congressional scrutiny.' In mid-
1970, the US government again mobilized clandestine 
resources to keep the perennial socialist candidate, Salvadore 
Allende, from winning the Chilean presidential election. 
Also again, American business leaders offered corporate 
money to CIA for use in supporting Allende's opponents. 
This time the group of concerned executives and industrial-
ists included McCone. Since 1965, he had been a member 
of the board of directors of International Telephone and 
Telegraph (ITT)-a sure target for nationalization under an 
Allende government because of its extensive economic and 
political influence in Chile. Through his contacts with 
Helms, McCone set in motion a series of discussions 
between ITT and CIA about the Chilean election. On his 
own initiative, McCone met with Helms several times dur-
ing May and June 1970 to discuss the situation. According 
to Helms, McCone seemed to think the Agency could 
repeat its successful intervention in 1964 when he was DCI 
and was dissatisfied that CIA was not mounting a massive 
covert operation this time. McCone pressed Helms to send 
an Agency representative to talk with ITT's chief executive 
officer, Harold Geneen. In a meeting in mid-July with Will-

jam Broe, then head of WH Division, Geneen offered to 
give CIA a "substantial" fund (later calculated at $1 million) 
to pass along to Allende's principal opponent. Broe 
declined, citing the US government's prohibition against 
backing a specific candidate, but he encouraged ITT to pro-
vide the money directly to the campaign. Company repre-
sentatives, guided by CIA advice, eventually passed 
approximately $350,000 to the National Party. McCone 
presumably was witting of these activities. je,Fs'r 
At the ITT board of directors' monthly meeting in early 
September 1970, just after Allende won a plurality of the 
popular vote, Geneen told McCone privately that he would 
put up $1 million of ITT's funds to support any US policy 
to build opposition to Allende before the Chilean legislature 
voted on the president in November. (Under the Chilean 
constitution, when no candidate won an absolute majority 
in the plebiscite, the Congress would select a president from 
the two candidates with the most votes.) McCone concurred 
with the idea and a few days later met with Helms and the 
national security adviser, Henry Kissinger?both members 
of the NSC's 40 Committee, successor to the Special Group 
and the 303 Committee?to convey ITT's offer. Kissinger 
said he would get back to McCone if the administration had 
a plan, but McCone said Kissinger never did. Later in Sep-
tember, as the second phase of the election drew nearer, CIA 
proposed a large-scale program to disrupt the Chilean econ-
omy as a way of encouraging Christian Democrats to vote 
against Allende or, failing that, to undermine the new gov-
ernment. The DDP, Thomas Karamessines, telephoned 
McCone to request his approval of the scheme, but McCone 
did not think the plan would work and so informed 
Geneen, who decided not to take part in it. CIA eventually 
spent between $800,000 and $1 million to influence the 
vote, which Allende won. 
McCone does not appear to have had any part in subse-
quent US efforts to destabilize Allende's government, which 
fell in a military coup in 1973. When questioned at the time 
by Sen. Frank Church about CIA-ITT activities toward 
Chile, McCone said he "would personally be very dis-
tressed" if a foreign government or corporation tried to 
influence a presidential election in the United States. He tes-
tified that ITT intended the money it placed in Chile dur-
ing the election as economic aid, prompting incredulous 
senators to note how inconsequential the amount was when 
compared to official US assistance of $1 billion. McCone 
did not persuade the legislators that ITT's intentions in 
Chile or its dealings with CIA were as innocuous as he 
claimed, but he did not incur any sanction for either his 
actions or his testimony:7 (U) 
McCone took part in other public affairs not related to 
intelligence during the late 1960s and early 1970s. President 
Johnson had placed him on a committee studying the feasi-
bility of a supersonic transport aircraft, and he stayed on the 
panel following his resignation. His business experience and 
contacts and his knowledge of the OXCART's development 
was useful to the committee's work. (The US government 
decided in the early 1970s, however, not to develop an SST.) 
After race riots broke out in Los Angeles's Watts District in 
the summer of 1965, McCone?a lifelong resident of Cali-
fornia?headed a committee appointed by Governor 
Edmund G. Brown to investigate urban violence and racial 
relations in the United States. The committee tried to allo-
cate blame for the riots evenhandedly and proposed an 
agenda of economic and educational programs targeting 
urban minorities. Two years later, President Johnson 
appointed McCone to an 18-member committee to deter-
mine how business and labor resources could be mobilized 
to attack poverty in the inner cities. McCone made over-
tures to the new Nixon administration in 1969, and in one 
instance discussed PFIAB with the president. During 
Nixon's second term, McCone served on the general advi-
sory committee of the Arms Control and Disarmament 
Agency." (U) 
In November 1976, McCone was called to testify before a federal grand jury hearing evidence about Richard Helms's perjury before the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee in 1973. McCone wrote to then-DCI George Bush that he "had little recollection of discussions that took place.. several years ago.... I was something 
less than the most informative witness and, at times, was concerned that the jury might think I was 'stonewalling' which was not the case." McCone letter to Bush,

As the Agency's relations with 
Congress and reputation with the 
public deteriorated in the early and 
mid-1970s, McCone decided that 
CIA must retreat from some of its 
traditional positions on openness and 
oversight. The scandals surrounding 
the Agency had so damaged its 
image, he concluded, that major 
changes were needed to end the criti-
cism and restore confidence in it. In 
1972, he endorsed a bill to require 
the Agency to distribute estimates to 
Congress and regularly report to the 
House and Senate committees on 
foreign affairs as well as the usual 
oversight committees. In 1975, 
McCone suggested to the Rockefeller 
Commission that PFIAB be strength-
ened, that a joint congressional over-
sight committee be established, and 
that CIA's name be changed (because 
it "is so tainted.") Later that year, he 
volunteered to apprise the Pike Committee?the House of 
Representatives' investigative committee, chaired by Rep. 
Otis Pike (D-NY)--of some of the Intelligence Commu-
nity's accomplishments. He told Vice President Nelson 
Rockefeller that "I think I'd better go talk to this man Pike. 
He's off the reservation." Pike replied that he was not inter-
ested in hearing about the Cuban missile crisis again and 
never met with McCone. In addition, McCone proposed 
the creation of an interagency subcommittee of the NSC 
that would monitor all CIA activities, not just covert action. 
In public testimony to a Senate committee in 1976, he 
repeated his call for the creation of a join congressional over-
sight committee.19,

At the same time he was espousing these ideas, which 
contradicted positions he had taken as DCI, McCone 
defended the Agency in two widely circulated publications. 
His essay on "Foreign Intelligence in a Free Society" in the 
Encyclopedia Britannica yearbook for 1976 explained in 
objective terms why intelligence collection and analysis "is 
an indispensable service for any government having even the 
most elementary international associations." He made the 
same case, with a slightly sharper pen, in a TV Guide article 
in early 1976, "Why We Need the CIA." In both pieces, he 
recognized that "changes must be made to extinguish...crit-
icism [and] to restore confidence... [in] an on-going, 
dynamic foreign intelligence service."' (U) 
McCone's participation in CIA and intelligence affairs 
lasted into the 1980s. He was one of the few ex-Agency offi-
cials who supported President Jimmy Carter's controversial 
nomination of Theodore Sorensen, John Kennedy's speech-
writer, to be DCI. While a member of the NSC Executive 
Committee during the Cuban missile crisis, he had been 
particularly impressed with Sorensen's abilities. McCone 
served on the Citizens Advisory Committee on Cuba, which 
President Carter had convened after the so-called "discov-
ery" of a Soviet army brigade in Cuba in 1979. He joined

tioning Agency officers about the nature of the supposed 
deployment and examining old intelligence reports. The 
panel concluded that the unit had been in Cuba since the 
missile crisis and that the Intelligence Community had lost 
track of it sometime during the preceding 16 years. 
McCone, presumably more defensive than the others about 
CIA's lapse, appears to have tried to implicate the Soviet 
Union in some sort of indiscretion and said the United 
States should "take steps to rectify the situation"?though 
he did not specify what.' (U) 
During the Reagan administration, McCone served on 
the President's Commission on Strategic Forces (also known 
as the Scowcroft Commission), which recommended ways 
to reduce American vulnerability to a first strike. In inter-
views for books and newspapers, he tried to set the record 
straight about CIA during the contentious directorship of 
William Casey. (On his trips to Washington, McCone often 
stopped by Headquarters to see the DCI.) In 1982, the 
Agency gave McCone the William J. Donovan Award in 
recognition of his contributions to the intelligence profes-
sion and, Casey said in his speech, of McCone's service as a 
"citizen statesman and.. .citizen soldier." In 1987, President 
Reagan presented him with the Presidential Medal of Free-
dom, the highest honor the US government can bestow on 
private citizens. The following year, McCone was named 
honorary chairman of the advisory board of the National 
Intelligence Study Center, a private information clearing-
house for intelligence scholars. He also was a trustee of the 
Monterey Institute of International Studies in California 
during this period.' (U) 
By the end of the decade, McCone's health was failing. 
On 14 February 1991 at the age of 89, he died of a heart 
attack at "Blue Stars," his home in Pebble Beach, California, 
overlooking Carmel Bay. He was buried nearby at the Car-

A DCI for His Times (U) 
Arthur Schlesinger Jr., historian and adviser to Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy, wrote the first assessment of 
John McCone as DCI in early 1965, before 
McCone resigned. The evaluation holds up well, almost 
40 years later. McCone, Schlesinger concluded, was a "cau-
tious, realistic, and self-effacing" director who 
repaired morale within the Agency, instituted mea-
sures to keep the CIA and himself out of the newspa-
pers...restored its relations with the State Department 
and the Congress, if not altogether with the Depart-
ment of Defense...declin[ed] to allow his own views 
to prejudice the intelligence estimates... [and] showed 
a fair-mindedness which shamed some of us who had 
objected to his appointment. 
Just after McCone died in 1991, then-DCI William Web-
ster described the sixth director as "sharp, tough, and 
demanding...a highly effective and widely respected leader." 
In 2004, then-acting DCI John McLaughlin?noting simi-
larities between the straits CIA found itself in after the Bay 
of Pigs debacle and the intelligence controversies of Opera-
tion Iraqi Freedom?described the way McCone handled 
himself inside what President Kennedy called the "bull's 
eye:" 
He would lead an Agency that was, for the first time 
in its history, under intense scrutiny and criticism.... 
If McCone was at all uneasy about the challenges 
before him, he did not let it show. With the confi-
dence and decisiveness of an experienced manager, he 
learned what he needed to know?and he learned it 
fast.... He was a leader suited for a tough business in a 
tough time. (U) 
McCone was the right DCI for the times?the manager 
and leader CIA needed desperately in the early 1960s, when 
the Agency faced an uncertain future in the wake of the Bay of 
Pigs humiliation. A president other than Kennedy may well 
have decided to put a submissive bureaucrat in charge with 
orders to downsize or dismantle it; even Kennedy, the dynamic 
cold warrior, briefly thought of doing so. He could not envi-
"Pttrlii.1./)  
EPILOGUE 
sion winning the Cold War without CIA, however, and 
needed a DCI like McCone to make sure the administration's 
clandestine arsenal was used as effectively as possible. (U) 
McCone fulfilled the Kennedy administration's expecta-
tions and more than ably completed the missions he was 
assigned. He brought his lengthy experience in business and 
government, his keen intellect, his political sophistication, 
and his forceful personality to bear on CIA's manifold 
administrative and political problems. He restored balance 
to the Agency's activities by reemphasizing its preeminent 
missions?collecting secret foreign intelligence and provid-
ing strategic warning and analysis to US policymakers?and 
keeping close watch over CA operations. Except for minor 
imbroglios over covert actions and information disclosures 
with Congress and the media, he kept CIA out of public 
controversy. When McCone left Langley 42 months after 
his appointment, the Agency and the Intelligence Commu-
nity were in far better shape to conduct their business than 
when he arrived. (U) 
Like Walter Bedell Smith, McCone was an archetype of 
the "manager-reformer/outsider" DCI, and he showed that a 
career as a Washington insider is not essential to running the 
community effectively. There are, of course, limits to how 
far a DCI can live apart from the capital scene and still be 
successful. James Schlesinger and Stansfield Turner demon-
strated that point, and they did not help themselves with 
their arrogance and hostility toward clandestine operations. 
A DCI who, like McCone, comes from beyond Washington 
determined to make changes, has political skills and connec-
tions, appreciates the community's bureaucratic culture, and 
enjoys the support of the president, can accomplish much in 
making the intelligence services major contributors to 
American foreign policy. (U) 
The watchwords of McCone's directorship were produc-
tivity, efficiency, and accountability. These he tried to 
achieve through centralization and the appointment of 
trusted and experienced subordinates. He eschewed man-
agement systems and models, and he did not proliferate 
sub-bureaucracies. He convened working groups and special

panels to address specific issues but disbanded them after 
they finished their assignments. McCone thought that intra-
mural competition?which he distinguished from offices' 
efforts to complement each other's activities?was corrosive, 
especially at lower levels. He wanted lines of authority, 
responsibility, and function clearly defined from the top 
down. Striving to be a true D/CIA, McCone brought more 
authority into the Office of the DCI and put trustworthy 
and knowledgeable insiders in charge of the key operations 
and directorates. They kept him fully informed through 
morning staff meetings and the reenergized DCI Executive 
Committee. (U) 
McCone accomplished most of the internal managerial 
goals he set for himself. Despite his reputation as a hard-
headed executive, he played the bureaucratic game adepdy, 
knowing that as an outsider he could not run CIA by sev-
enth floor edict. After 30 years in the private sector and the 
US government, he knew the difference between acting 
decisively and acting precipitously. Cognizant of the cultural 
differences within the Agency, he did not?as did Stansfield 
Turner and John Deutch?bring in a cadre of former associ-
ates to populate the upper echelon, nor did he try to run a 
unique government organization by business school para-
digms. He realized that CIA had some singular specialties 
and let the career experts practice them. (U) 
Externally, McCone had more difficulty. Probably his 
biggest misstep in community affairs was his initial handling 
of the dispute with the Department of Defense over run-
ning NRO. The controversy was clear evidence that the 
DCI?then wielding command authority over only one-
sixth of the community's resources?did not direct some-
thing called "central intelligence." When adjustments of the 
traditional CIA-Pentagon joint management of NRO 
became necessary, McCone negotiated away too much 
administrative and budgetary authority to the Pentagon, 
wrongly counting on personal relationships to offset the 
bureaucratic disadvantage in which he left CIA. He soon 
entered an interagency slugfest to regain the ground he had 
surrendered, in an effort that took up more of his time than 
any issue except Vietnam. (U) 
Two of McCone's signal accomplishments as DCI came 
in the areas of science and technology and analysis. With his 
engineering background and previous work at the Pentagon 
and the AEC, he was almost ideally equipped to lead the 
community early in a revolution in technical intelligence. 
McCone's centralization of CIA's scientific and technologi-
422 
G?411  
cal activities into a new directorate enabled him to mobilize 
Agency resources more efficiently and added to CIA's influ-
ence in this increasingly important aspect of the commu-
nity's work. He not only understood many of the design 
intricacies of the new overhead systems, but he knew 
enough about the politics of the military-industrial complex 
to be able to preserve for CIA a major role in the National 
Reconnaissance Program. A less combative or less knowl-
edgeable DCI almost certainly would have been far less 
effective at protecting the Agency's interests in the new era 
of technical collection?arguably the community's most 
vital contribution to Cold War intelligence. (U) 
McCone also raised the prominence of intelligence analy-
sis in the national security decisionmaking process. For 
intelligence analyses to be influential?let alone be read at 
all?they had to answer the questions the policymakers were 
asking. It was not enough to tell them what CIA thought 
was important. McCone regarded relevance, accuracy, 
objectivity, and timeliness as the keys to making intelligence 
analysis worthwhile. Except for the Vietnam special estimate 
in 1963, he kept his policy role from influencing his super-
vision of the community's analytic efforts. He was an empir-
icist who could be, and many times was, argued out of a 
judgment by facts or compelling logic. To him, the estima-
tive process existed to inform policymakers, not to press a 
case or plead a cause. (U) 
McCone did not win all his bureaucratic fights, but he 
established the authority of the DCI as the US government's 
national intelligence officer. He came to Langley with a 
"vision" of how the community should be run and worked 
assiduously to bring it to fruition. When he prevailed, he 
did so largely by building respect for himself and his ideas 
across organizational lines, even if he was often hard to work 
with. His reputation for integrity and candor served him 
well in interdepartmental and congressional settings; few 
officials or legislators ever accused him of being devious or 
playing political games. From McCone's time on, the DCI 
would be regarded (even if at times only formalistically) as 
director of central intelligence, not just director of CIA. 
Later DCIs?for reasons of personality or politics?were 
more passive in carrying out their duties or served under 
presidents who were indifferent or hostile to CIA. Nonethe-
less, McCone ensured that when a president who cared 
about intelligence took office and appointed an activist 
DCI, the Agency and the community would be well pre-
pared to serve both. (U)

Approved for Release: 2015/04/10 001262737 
In the early 21st century debate over intelligence reform, 
many of McCone's views would resonate. A "McCone per-
spective" would involve giving more power to the DCI?
making the position a true director of the Intelligence Com-
munity, with authority over the programs, budgets, and per-
sonnel of all intelligence agencies, and answerable to the 
president. McCone attempted to make himself a "chairman 
of the board" of "Intelligence, Inc." in a way that resembles 
current proposals to establish a national intelligence director 
with the statutory authority to coordinate all activities of 
community "operating companies" such as CIA, NSA, and 
NRO. McCone most likely would have regarded that 
reform as far more preferable to creation of large interagency 
centers combining operations and analysis on specific issues 
or decentralization of authority over intelligence affairs to 
purely civilian and military departments under their own 
directors reporting to cabinet secretaries. McCone would 
also have endorsed giving the DCI command authority over 
"national" or "strategic" intelligence agencies, leaving 
"departmental" and "tactical" components?INR, DIA, and 
the other military and civilian intelligence offices?under 
their respective cabinet secretaries. (U) 
At the same time that McCone demonstrated the impor-
tance of being close to the White House, he revealed the 
risks of trying too hard to be close. As Richard Helms?a 
very different type of DCI?observed, 
Each President has to be dealt with by a Director 
according to his personality and according to his way of 
doing business.... Every President is going to do his 
business the way he wants to do it. You say, well, he 
should discipline himself, but they never do. They do it 
exactly the way they want to do it. Even if you convince 
them that they ought to do it differently, they'll never 
do it for more than twice differently, and then they go 
back to the way they wanted to do it before.... The 
notion that a Director should constantly see[,] and be 
in the presence ofli the President is not necessarily true. 
As a matter of fact, he can become an irritant.... You 
either adjust your production to the man you have in 
the office or you're going to miss the train.' 
...S41`6134:4.1  
A DCI for His Times (U) 
McCone came on too strong with Lyndon Johnson in the 
early weeks of their relationship. With uncharacteristic 
obtuseness, he failed to adapt his approach to suit the new 
president's preferences. Then he compounded his error by 
constantly caviling about the administration's policy in Viet-
nam. In short, McCone almost argued himself out of a job. 
His disputatiousness and unconcealed dissatisfaction helped 
bring on the appointment of William Raborn, who knew 
little about foreign affairs and was chosen mostly because he 
would not bother the president. (U) 
Almost as important for an institution's history are the 
features of a leader's style that his successors choose not to 
emulate. Richard Helms, for one, learned by McCone's neg-
ative example. During his seven-year directorship, he con-
sciously fashioned his management approach to reduce the 
DCI's policy profile and to avoid bureaucratic battles. 
Unlike McCone, Helms did not believe the DCI could or 
should "wear two hats" and that if any director was bold 
enough, as McCone was, to take on the secretary of 
defense?by many measures the second most powerful offi-
cial in Washington after the president?he was sure to lose. 
Instead, the DCI's role in this more quiescent conception is 
mainly to "keep the game honest"?to "be at the table" at 
the pleasure of the president with the facts and objective 
analysis?while avoiding pointless and self-defeating skir-
mishes over turf and prestige and staying out of policy dis-
cussions as much as possible.' (U) 
Most of McCone's followers adopted Helms's approach, 
but neither style alone has guaranteed success. The DCI's 
standing and accomplishments have depended substantially 
on whether the president?because of ideology, politics, or 
something else?is suspicious of or uninterested in intelli-
gence and whether the national security adviser functions as 
the president's chief intelligence officer (as did Henry Kiss-
inger and Zbigniew Brzezinski). Most DCIs have been 
unable to influence those variables. On occasion, however, 
with the right conjunction of world events, personalities, 
and political needs, a DCI has reached the top of the 
national security apparatus. John McCone occupied such a 
place. (U)

For those who prefer visual media, espionage, covert 
action, and counterintelligence receive regular treatment on 
American and British television. US cable networks such as 
the History Channel, the Learning Channel, and the Dis-
covery Channel have broadcast numerous documentaries on 
intelligence that include discussions of some DCIs. Some of 
the programs are fairly breathless in tone, but others are 
solid in substance. In 1999, the British Broadcasting Com-
pany produced an excellent series called The Spying Game 
that handled several complicated intelligence operations 
with sophistication and insight. An earlier BBC effort, a 
1992 serialization of John Ranelagh's sweeping history of 
CIA, The Agency: The Rise and Decline of the CIA (New 
York: Simon and Schuster, 1986), was equally good. (U) 
Directors of Central Intelligence (U) 
As indicated in the introduction, the literature on the 
DCIs is extensive. Allen Dulles (DCI during 1953-61) has 
received more attention in print?including two full-length 
biographies and an extensive, once-classified, study of his 
directorship?than any other DCI. See especially: 
? H.W. Brands Jr., "Allen Dulles and the Overthrow of 
Clausewitz," in Brands, Cold Warriors: Eisenhower's 
Generation and American Foreign Policy (New York: 
Columbia University Press, 1988), 48-68;

Dulles provided his own reflections on Cold War operations 
and analysis in The Craft of Intelligence (New York: Harper 
and Row, 1963). (U) 
After Dulles, William Casey (1981-87) and Richard 
Helms (1966-73) have been written about more compre-
hensively than the other DCIs. Casey has been the subject 
of two books?Joseph E. Persico, Casey: From the OSS to the 
CIA (New York: Viking Press, 1990), and Bob Woodward, 
VEIL: The Secret Wars of the CIA, 1981-1987 (New York: 
Simon and Schuster, 1987)?and numerous articles, most 
relating to the Iran-Contra affair and covert actions of the 
Reagan administration. A perceptive analysis of Casey's lead-
ership is Joseph Lelyveld, "The Director: Running the 
CIA," New York Times Magazine, 20 January 1985: 16-28, 
50-51. Casey's denouement is recounted in James 
McCullough, "Personal Reflections on Bill Casey's Last 
Month at CIA," Studies in Intelligence 39, no. 5(1996): 75-
91; and David Halevy and Neil C. Livingstone, "The Last 
Days of Bill Casey," Washingtonian 23, no. 3 (December 
1987): 174-77,238-45. (U) 
One of the most insightful books about CIA, Thomas 
Powers, The Man Who Kept the Secrets: Richard Helms and 
the CIA (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1979), is more a his-
tory of the Agency than a biography of Helms. His director-
ship is covered a bit episodically in a classified study by 
Robert M. Hathaway and Russell Jack Smith, Richard Helms 
As Director of Central Intelligence, 1966-1973 (Washington, 
DC: CIA History Staff, 1993). See also David Robarge, 
"Richard Helms: The Intelligence Professional Personified,"

N. Bethell, "The Spy Who Went Out in the Cold: The 
Problem of Choosing Wars Wisely," Washington 
Monthly 12, no. 3 (March 1980): 28-41. Helms wrote a dis-
creet memoir (with William Hood), A Look Over My Shoul-
der: A Lifi in the Central Intelligence Agency (New York: 
Random House, 2003).K

William Colby's life is chronicled in John Prados, Lost 
Crusader: The Secret Wars of CIA Director William Colby 
(New York: Oxford University Press, 2003), and his eventful 
tenure receives thorough treatment in a classified work by 
Harold P Ford, William Colby As Director of Central Intelli-
gence, 1973-1976 (Washington, DC: CIA History Staff, 
1993). Colby's dismissal of the Agency's controversial coun-
terintelligence chief James Angleton is provocatively inter-
preted by one of Angleton's journalistic acolytes, Edward Jay 
Epstein, in "The War Within the CIA," Commentary 66, 
no. 2 (August 1978): 35-39. Colby wrote a fair-minded 
memoir, Honorable Men: My Life in the CIA (New York: 
Simon and Schuster, 1978) and a somewhat tendentious 
account of the Vietnam War, Lost Victory: A Firsthand

(Chicago: Contemporary Books, 1989). Xiit 
Besides the above-mentioned sources on Casey, there are 
relatively few works on the DCIs after Colby. George Bush's 
single year at Langley (1976-77) is noted in Herbert S. 
Parmet, George Bush: The Lift of a Lone Star Yankee (New 
York: Scribner, 1997), chap. 12, and Nicholas King, George 
Bush: A Biography (New York: Dodd, Mead, 1980), chap. 
12. Two articles look at Bush's short-lived experiment in 
competitive analysis on the Soviet threat: Robert C. Reich, 
"Re-examining the Team A-Team B Exercise," International 
Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence 3, no. 3 (Fall 
1989): 387-403; and Richard Pipes, "Team B: The Reality 
Behind the Myth," Commentary 82, no. 4 (October 1986): 
25-40. Bush included some documents from his director-
ship in his memoir-anthology, All the Best, George Bush: My 
Life in Letters and Other Writings (New York: Scribner, 
1999). (U) 
After James Schlesinger (1973), Stansfield Turner (1977-
81) probably generated more contention per capita than any 
DCI, but his directorship has not been studied in detail. 
Some of his management ideas are critiqued in Benjamin F. 
Schimmer et al., "The Slow Murder of the American Intelli-
gence Community," Armed Forces Journal International 116, 
no. 3 (March 1979), 50-54; and Edward Jay Epstein, "Who 
Killed the CIA: The Confessions of Stansfield Turner," 
Commentary 80, no. 4 (October 1985), 53-57. Turner pro-
vided an account of his tenure and his prescriptions for 
intelligence in Secrecy and Democracy: The CIA in Transition 
(Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1985). (U) 
Preliminary attempts at evaluating William Webster 
(1987-91) are Mark Perry, "The Case Against William 
Webster," Regardie's, January 1990: 90-95; and Loch K. 
Johnson, "DCI Webster's Legacy: The Judge's Self-Assess-
ment," International Journal of Intelligence and 
Counterintelligence 5, no. 3 (Fall 1991): 287-90. The "polit-
icization" issue that beset the directorship of Robert Gates 
(1991-93) is analyzed in H. Bradford Westerfield, "Inside 
Ivory Bunkers: CIA Analysts Resist Managers' Pandering," 
International Journal of Intelli gence and Counterintelligence 9, 
no. 4 (Winter 1996-97): 407-24 (part 1), vol. 10, no. 1 
(July 1997), 19-55 (part 2). Gates's pre-DCI career is the 
subject of David Callahan, "Robert Gates: Bush's Man at

1991): 14-21. Gates describes his years in the national secu-

Tenet), is Christopher M. Jones, "The CIA Under Clinton:

The directorships of Deutch (1995-97) and Tenet 
(1997-2004) are too recent to have received other than 
journalistic treatment. For an interesting examination of 
how Deutch handled a major controversy, see Abraham H. 
Miller, "How the CIA Fell Victim to Myth Posing as Jour-
nalism," International Journal of Intelligence and 
Counterintelligence 10, no. 3 (Fall 1997): 257-68. Deutch's 
post-CIA security problems are discussed, in the context of 
his fractious directorship, in David Wise, "What the Spy-
master Knew," Talk Magazine, November 2000: 25-31, and 
Thomas Powers, "The Whiz Kid vs. the Old Boys," New

Tenet's and CIA's relations with Congress are the focus 
of Chuck McCutcheon, "CIA's Role in Afghan War Restores 
Tenet's Image on Hill," Congressional Quarterly, 2 February

Tenet's involvement with Operation Iraqi Freedom in Plan

it published before 1990 are listed in Lester H. Brune, The

John Kennedy's secret recordings of many of the meet-
ings of the NSC ExComm during the missile crisis have 
become both an indispensable resource for scholars and a 
matter of disputation. Two edited collections of transcripts 
of those recordings have been published:

Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House during the Cuban 
Missile Crisis (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University 
Press, 1997);

tali, eds., The Presidential Recordings: John E Kennedy: 
The Great Crises, 3 vols. (New Jork: W. W. Norton,

audiovisual CD-ROM. (U)

The Kennedy Assassination (U) 
It is a historiographical oddity that an event of such Zeit-
geist-altering proportions as the Kennedy assassination has 
received so little rigorous attention from academics. Instead, 
in an intellectual corollary to Gresham's Law, bad scholar-
ship has driven out the good and even the mediocre. Jour-
nalists of assorted reputations, legal advocates, 
sensationalizers, political extremists, and so-called "indepen-
dent researchers" (i.e., buffs and freelancers) preempted the 
field from historians as the assassination became, in histo-
rian Christopher Lasch's apt phrase, "a rich field for the 
unchecked play of fantasy." (Lasch, "The Life of Kennedy's 
Death," Harper's Magazine, October 1983: 32.) One of the 
few scholarly treatments of the killing itself is Michael L. 
Kurtz, Crime of the Century: The Kennedy Assassination from

a Historian's Perspective (Knoxville: University of Tennessee 
Press, 1982). The conspiracist literature, in contrast, is volu-
minous, numbering over 2,000 books and thousands of arti-
cles and tracts that range enormously in reliability. Useful 
reference works about this corpus are: 
? Anthony Frewin, comp., The Assassination of John E 
Kennedy: An Annotated Film, TV; and Videography, 
1963-1992 (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1993); 
? James N. Giglio, comp.,John E Kennedy: A Bibliography

Assassination of John E Kennedy: A Comprehensive His-
torical and Legal Bibliography, 1963-1979 (Westport, 
CT: Greenwood Press, 1980). (U) 
For an early assessment of the assassination literature that 
still holds up, see Calvin Trillin, "The Buffs," New Yorker 
43,10 June 1967: 41-71. A more recent analysis is Robert 
Alan Goldberg, Enemies Within: The Culture of Conspiracy 
in Modern America (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 
2001), 105-48. Barbie Zelizer, Covering the Body: The 
Kennedy Assassination, the Media, and the Shaping of Collec-
tive Memory (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992) is 
an interesting examination of how journalists' "first draft of 
history," and their subsequent reworkings of it, have shaped 
what we "know" about the assassination. (U) 
Recent exemplars of the principal plot theories, with the 
alleged perpetrators discernible from the titles, are: 
? G. Robert Blakey and Richard Billings, Fatal Hour: The 
Assassination of President Kennedy by Organized Crime 
(New York: Berkeley Books, 1992); 
? L. Fletcher Prouty, JFK: The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot 
to Assassinate John E Kennedy (New York: Birch Lane 
Press, 1992); 
? William W. Turner and Warren Hinckle, Deadly Secrets: 
The CIA-Mafia War Against Castro and the Assassination 
ofJEK (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1992). (U) 
John Newman, Oswald and the CIA (New York: Carroll 
and Graf, 1993); Gaeton Fonzi, The Last Investigation (New 
York: Thunder Mouth's Press, 1993); and Philip H. Melan-
son, Spy Saga: Lee Harvey Oswald and US Intelligence (New 
York: Praeger, 1990), try to demonstrate that Oswald was an 
operative for CIA and/or the KGB. Many other books with 
mild to ardent conspiracist perspectives have been published 
during the past 10 years. (U) 
Appendix on Sources 
The most thorough open source accounts of Yuri 
Nosenko's defection and treatment are: 
? Gordon Brook-Shepherd, The Storm Birds: Soviet Post-
War Defectors (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 
1988), chap. 12; 
? Edward Jay Epstein, Legend: The Secret World of Lee 
Harvey Oswald (New York: McGraw Hill, 1978), 3-50, 
257-74;

? David Martin, Wilderness ofiVIirrors (New York: Harper 
and Row, 1980), 153-78. (U) 
In Legend, Epstein posited the intriguing but unsubstan-
tiated theory that the Soviets recruited Oswald when he was 
a Marine Corps radar operator at Atsugi Airbase in Japan to 
steal secrets about the U-2, which flew missions from that 
installation. After Oswald returned from the Soviet Union 
to the United States, the Soviets constructed a legend of him 
as a disillusioned defector to explain why he was in Russia 
and to conceal his intelligence activities. The Soviets never 
intended for him to kill John Kennedy, but when he did, 
they dispatched Nosenko as a false defector to corroborate 
the legend and, by inference, exonerate the KGB. Nosenko's 
bona fides, in turn, would be reinforced by another Soviet 
disinformation agent, who had volunteered him-
self to the FBI two years earlier in New York City but 
remained under Soviet control. The objective of these tactics 
was to have Nosenko testify before the Warren Commission 
that the KGB files he had seen showed that Oswald never 
had any connection with Soviet intelligence. Epstein elabo-
rates on elements of his interpretation in "The War of the 
Moles: An Interview with Edward Jay Epstein," New York, 
27 February 1978: 28-38. Legend and Martin's Wilderness of 
Mirrors represented the two sides of the public debate over 
Nosenko that started in the late 1970s when Agency and 
Bureau officers began telling their anonymous versions of 
the still-officially-secret story. Martin's reading of the 
Nosenko affair deals much less with the assassination and, 
based heavily on unattributed interviews with James Angle-
ton's opponents in CIA and the FBI, is far more critical of 
the Agency's long-time CI chief and its handling of 
Nosenko, Golitsyn, and counterintelligence in general. (U)

Approved for Release: 2015/04/10 001262737 
Several books on the Nosenko-Golitsyn controversy are 
reviewed in Cleveland C. Cram, Of Moles and Molehunters: 
A Review of Counterintelligence Literature, 1977-92, CIA 
Center for the Study of Intelligence Monograph CSI 93-
002 (October 1993). Nosenko's knowledge of Oswald is 
well summarized in Gerald Posner, Case Closed: Lee Harvey 
Oswald and the Assassination of JFK (New York: Random 
House, 1993), 46-56. CIA officer Richards J. Heuer Jr. 
incisively examines the flaws in the analysis of Nosenko's 
case in "Nosenko: Five Paths to Judgment," Studies in 
Intelligence 31, no. 3 (Fall 1987): 71-101, declassified and 
printed in H. Bradford Westerfield, ed., Inside CIA's Private 
World: Declassified Articles from the Agency's Internal Journal, 
1955-1992 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1995), 
379-414. The allegation that Angleton ordered Nosenko's 
incarceration has been disproved in Samuel Halpern and 
Hayden Peake, "Did Angleton Jail Nosenko?," International 
Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence 3, no. 4 (Win-
ter 1989): 451-64. A recent analysis of the Nosenko case, 
and Angleton's approach to CI generally, is David Robarge, 
"Moles, Defectors, and Deceptions: James Angleton and 
CIA Counterintelligence," Journal of Intelligence History 3, 
no. 2 (Winter 2003): 21-49. (U)
