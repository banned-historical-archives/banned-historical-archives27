 THEODORE WHITE HAS SAID THAT THE PROBLEMS OF SOCIETY CAN
 BE PLACED WITHIN THREE CATEGORIES: WAR & PEACE, BLACK &
 WHITE, AND BREAD & BUTTER.   IT SEEMS TO ME THAT OUR COUNTRY'S
 GROWING PROBLEM OF IMMIGRATION DOESN'T FIT VERY NEATLY INTO
 MR. WHITE'S LIST, AND BELIEVE ME, THIS PROBLEM HAS EXPLOSIVE
 POTENTIAL.
 WHILE IMMIGRATION HAS ALWAYS FUELED THIS COUNTRY WITH
 DIVERSITY AND VITALITY, AND WHILE AMERICA IS AND OUGHT TO BE
 A HAVEN FOR THOSE FLEEING OPPRESSION, WE HAVE ALWAYS EXERCISED
 CONTROL OVER OUR BORDERS -- UNTIL RECENTLY.  MOST AMERICANS
 DON'T REALIZE THAT 270,000 PEOPLE IMMIGRATE LEGALLY TO THE
 U.S. EVERY YEAR.  ANOTHER 190,000 RELATIVES OF CITIZENS
 LEGALLY ENTER, PLUS ABOUT 70,000 REFUGEES FLEEING POLITICAL
 PERSECUTION AND ANOTHER 5,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE GRANTED ASYLUM
 EVERY YEAR.  NOW ADD TO THESE NUMBERS, HOW MANY ILLEGAL ALIENS
 EACH YEAR?  HALF A MILLION?  A MILLION?  NOBODY KNOWS, BUT IT
 IS A FORMIDABLE NUMBER. HOW LONG CAN WE ACCEPT SUCH NUMBERS
 WITHOUT SERIOUS IMPACT ON OUR RELATIVELY INTEGRATED, MOBILE
 SOCIETY?

 UNABATED, WITH ITS INTENSIFYING DEMAND FOR BILINGUALISM, IT
 WILL SOON BE ACCOMPANIED BY DEEP POLITICAL DIVISIONS AMONG
 THOSE ALREADY HERE, WE CAN THEN EXPECT THE EROSION OF PUBLIC
 SUPPORT FOR ANY IMMIGRATION AT ALL.
 WE THOUGHT WE HAD THE PROBLEMS SOLVED LAST YEAR WITH A
 LEGISLATIVE TRADE-OFF OF AMNESTY FOR A LARGE GROUPS OF
 ILLEGALS  IN EXCHANGE FOR IMPOSING CRIMINAL SANCTIONS ON
 EMPLOYERS WHO MAKE A PRACTICE OF HIRING ILLEGAL ALIENS.  BUT
 THE PROPOSAL FOUNDERED ON THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT
 THAT THE STATES MOST SERIOUSLY IMPACTED BY THIS AMNESTY WOULD
 REQUIRE.  A LARGE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL ALIENS WOULD BE EXPECTED
 TO COME OUT OF THE CLOSET NOW THAT THEY HAD LEGAL STATUS,
 AND THE ADDED WELFARE AND SOCIAL SERVICE COSTS COULD NOT BE
 EVEN REMOTELY PREDICATED.
 CALIFORNIA, FOR ONE STATE, DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THE
 CHANCE WITHOUT A REASONABLE CHANGE OF FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT.
 ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS THE BEST THE
 ADMINISTRATION WOULD OFFER, AND SO THE WHOLE LEGISLATIVE
 ENTERPRISE JUST SHUT DOWN.   WE'RE TRYING TO REVIVE IT, BUT
 THE PROBLEMS REMAIN AND THE PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS STILL ELUDE

 THE PROBLEM IMMIGRATION IS IMMEDIATELY LINKED WITH IS
 FOREIGN POLICY -- PARTICULARLY IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  OUR NEW
 AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, VERNON WALTERS HAS CALLED
 CUBA THE BIGGEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD: ITS GOVERNMENT IS IN
 HAVANA, BUT ITS ADMINISTRATION IS IN MOSCOW, ITS ARMY IS IN
 ANGOLA, AND ITS POPULATION IS IN MIAMI!
 COMMUNIST NATIONS DON'T PRODUCE VERY MUCH FOR EXPORT
 --  BUT THEY DO MANUFACTURE REFUGEES BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN THE
 WORLD, AND IF CENTRAL AMERICA GOES COMMUNIST, WE CAN EXPECT
 A TIDAL WAVE OF REFUGEES FROM SOUTH OF TEXAS -- AND THEY
 WON'T BE BOAT PEOPLE EITHER.  THERE ARE 100 MILLION PEOPLE
 FROM THE RIO GRANDE TO THE PANAMANIAN BORDER -- TEN PERCENT
 IS THE RULE OF THUMB WHEN IT COMES TO REFUGEES FLEEING COMMUNISM.
 IN 1956, OVER A MILLION PEOPLE FLED NORTH VIETNAM AND HEADED
 SOUTH, IN THE EARLY 1960s, OVER A MILLION FLED CUBA -- AND THEY
 NEEDED BOATS -- SO WE CAN EXPECT LITERALLY MILLIONS OF REFUGEES
 HEADED NORTH TOWARDS TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA.  IF THIS EVER HAPPENS
 ONE OF THE IMPORTANT GOALS OF SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY WILL BE
 ACCOMPLISHED - THE DIVERSION OF OUR RESOURCES AND ATTENTION
 FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND NATO, AND WITH ALMOST EXCLUSIVE

 BUT THEN THEY DIDN'T APPROVE OF GRENADA EITHER.
 AN INTERESTING QUIRK OF HUMAN NATURE IS OUR PENCHANT FOR
 JUDGING OTHERS BY OUR OWN STANDARDS AND VALUES.  THIS IS
 CALLED "MIRROR IMAGING." AMERICANS BY NATURE ARE TRUSTING
 PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO BELIEVE OTHER PEOPLE ALWAYS MEAN WHAT THEY
 SAY.  UNFORTUNATELY, MODERN HIS'T'ORY BURGEONS WITH INSTANCES
 OF COMMUNIST NATIONS REWARDING THIS TRUST WITH TREACHERY,
 MUCH TO THE SORROW AND SUFFERING OF THOSE NUMBERLESS VICTIMS
 CAUGHT IN THE POLITICAL. CROSSFIRE.
 FOR EXAMPLE, AVERILL HARRIMAN, WHILE SERVING AS OUR
 AMBASSADOR TO MOSCOW DURING WORLD WAR 11, CABLED WASHINGTON
 ON AUGUST 1,  1944, TO REPORT A CONVERSATION THAT HE HAD HAD
 WITH STANISLAW MIKOLAJCZYK, TILE THEN POLISH PRIME MINISTER,
 ABOUT SOVIET PLANS FOR POLAND.   "IN SOME DETAIL," HARRIMAN
 SAID, "I EXPLAINED TO HIM THE EVIDENCE THAT SATISFIED ME THAT
 THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT HAD NO INTENTION OF COMMUNIZING
 POLAND," THAT ANALYSIS HELPS EXPLAIN WHY THE UNITED STATES
 MADE SOME OF THE MISTAKES IT DID IN EUROPE DURING THE 1940'S.

 NOW  HARDLY A DAY GOES BY WITHOUT SOME GRAPHIC REMINDER OF
 THE ON-GOING TRAGEDY OF A COMMUNIZED POLAND.
 SOME YEARS LATER, A CHARISMATIC GUERRILLA LEADER MARCHED
 INTO HAVANA AND WAS CELEBRATED BY THE AMERICAN MEDIA AS THE
 GEORGE WASHINGTON OF CUBA.  WE EVENTUALLY REALIZED WHAT
 FIDEL CASTRO STOOD FOR, BUT BY THEN IT WAS AGAIN TOO LATE.
 IN 1973 HENRY KISSINGER RETURNED FROM PARIS WITH A PEACE
 TREATY SIGNED BY THE NORTH VIETNAMESE.  MOST AMERICANS
 BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF.  TWO YEARS LATER, SAIGON FELL WITH
 DESPERATE AMERICANS ANXIOUSLY AIRLIFTED FROM OUR EMBASSY
 ROOFTOP, LEAVING BEHIND THE OUT-STRETCHED HANDS OF ABANDONED
 VIETNAMESE WHOSE FATAL MISTAKE WAS TO TRUST US.  I DOUBT
 HOWEVER MR. KISSINGER UNDERTOOK THOSE TREATY NEGOTIATIONS AS
 TRUSTINGLY AS IT MIGHT APPEAR, BECAUSE IN HIS BOOK WHITE
 HOUSE YEARS HE TEACHES A LESSON THAT EVERY DIPLOMAT,
 EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND EVERY AMERICAN NEEDS TO LEARN.
 KISSINGER WRITES: "FROM LENIN TO STALIN. . .TO BREZHNEV AND
 WHOEVER SUCCEEDS HIM, SOVIET LEADERS HAVE BEEN PARTLY
 MOTIVATED BY A SELF PROCLAIMED INSIGHT INTO THE FORCES OF
 HISTORY AND BY A CONVICTION THAT THEIR CAUSE IS THE CAUSE OF
 HISTORICAL INEVITABILITY.  THEIR IDEOLOGY TEACHES THAT THE

 CLASS STRUGGLE AND ECONOMIC DETERMINISM MAKE REVOLUTIONARY
 UPHEAVAL INEVITABLE.  THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE FORCES OF
 REVOLUTION AND COUNTER-REVOLUTION IS IRRECONCILABLE.  TO THE
 INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACIES PEACE APPEARS AS A NATURALLY ATTAIN-
 ABLE CONDITION, IT IS THE COMPOSITION OF DIFFERENCES, THE
 ABSENCE OF STRUGGLE.  TO THE SOVIET LEADERS, BY CONTRAST,
 STRUGGLE IS ENDED NOT BY COMPROMISE BUT BY THE VICTORY OF ONE
 SIDE.  PERMANENT PEACE, ACCORDING TO COMMUNIST THEORY CAN BE
 ACHIEVED ONLY BY ABOLISHING THE CLASS STRUGGLE, AND THE CLASS
 STRUGGLE CAN BE ENDED ONLY BY A COMMUNIST VICTORY."
 DESPITE A DREARY RECORD OF COMMUNIST BETRAYAL,
 JIMMY CARTER DECLARED DURING A MAY 22, 1977 PRESIDENTIAL
 COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AT NOTRE DAME THAT "...WE ARE NOW FREE OF
 THAT INORDINATE FEAR OF COMMUNISM."  IT TOOK THE BRUTAL
 SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN TO CHANGE HIS MIND IN LATE
 1979 WHEN HE TOLD THE LATE FRANK REYNOLDS OF ABC-TV'S WORLD NEWS
 TONIGHT BROADCAST TEAM THAT "...THIS ACTION OF THE SOVIETS
 HAS MADE A MORE DRAMATIC CHANGE IN MY OWN OPINION OF WHAT THE
 SOVIETS' ULTIMATE GOALS ARE THAN ANYTHING THEY'VE DONE IN THE
 PREVIOUS TIME I'VE BEEN IN OFFICE."  A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ON-

 HIS FIRST TERM, BUT IT OUGHT NOT TO INVOLVE SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL
 ISSUE AS THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE SOVIET THREAT TO FREEDOM.
 NEARLY SIX YEARS AGO A BAND OF SEEMINGLY PATRIOTIC
 SANDINISTA REVOLUTIONARIES OVERTHREW THE SOMOZA DICTATORSHIP
 IN NICARAGUA AND PROMISED THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES
 THAT THEY WOULD HOLD FREE ELECTIONS AND ESTABLISH A
 DEMOCRATICALLY PLURALISTIC SOCIETY.
 PROVING THAT HOPE USUALLY TRIUMPHS OVER COMMON SENSE, A
 MAJORITY OF MY COLLEAGUES VOTED IN 1979 FOR MILLIONS OF
 DOLLARS OF ASSISTANCE TO HELP THE SANDINISTAS IMPLEMENT THEIR
 REVOLUTION.  I WAS ONE WHO JOINED IN THAT HOPE WITH MY VOTE.
 MY LEARNING PERIOD WAS ACCELLERATED IN THE FEW MONTHS
 FOLLOWING THAT VOTE.  SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE STILL HOPING
 -- A HOPE THAT EVENTS OUGHT TO HAVE DASHED A LONG TIME AGO.
 HISTORY INDEED DOES REPEAT ITSELF AND OUR TRUST AND STARRY
 EYED IDEALISM HAS BEEN EXPLOITED TIME AND TIME AGAIN.  SO FAR
 WE HAVE SURVIVED OUR BLUNDERS.  NOT SO, SOME OF OUR ALLIES.
 HOW MANY MORE MISJUDGMENTS WE WILL BE PERMITTED WITHOUT
 MORTALLY WOUNDING FREEDOM IS A QUESTION I HOPE NEVER HAS TO
 BE ANSWERED.

 ALL THIS IMPLIES, A SERIOUS SAFETY FACTOR HAS BEEN LOST, AND
 THIS IS THE "MARGIN FOR ERROR." IN 1941 WE HAD TIME TO GEAR
 UP THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, ONLY THEN WE CALLED IT
 THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY.  I CAN RECALL SEEING VOLUNTEERS
 DRILLING IN CHICAGO'S GRANT PARK WITH BROOM HANDLES FOR
 RIFLES.  THE LUXURY OF TIME CAN NO LONGER BE COUNTED ON.
 ALL THE MORE REASON THEN, WHY A CLEARLY DEFINED AND
 EFFECTIVE FOREIGN POLICY -- ONE THAT CAN ANTICIPATE THE
 TWISTS AND TURNS OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS - A POLICY THAT
 CAN INFLUENCE EVENTS, NOT MERELY REACT TO THEM, IS
 INCREASINGLY ESSENTIAL IN A DANGEROUS WORLD.
 TRADITIONALLY AND CONSTITUTIONALLY THE CONDUCT OF
 FOREIGN POLICY IS A FUNCTION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE.  SINCE
 CONGRESS CONTROLS THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS, ITS ULTIMATE
 CONTROL OVER EVERYTHING THAT COSTS MONEY IS CLEAR.  HOWEVER,
 SINCE VIETNAM, CONGRESS HAS DEVELOPED AN ENTHUSIASM FOR MICRO-
 MANAGING FOREIGN POLICY THAT IS INHERENTLY COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.
 A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS IMPOSED THE WAR POWERS ACT ON A
 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, AND ONE CAN ARGUE BOTH SIDES OF THIS
 CONTROVERSY IN AN AGE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  A SIGNIFICANT
 ISSUE TODAY IS WHETHER THAT ACT IS CONSTITUTIONAL AND SINCE

 WE'LL NEVER KNOW UNLESS THERE IS A CASE OR CONTROVERSY BEFORE
 THE COURT -- THIS PRESENTS A VERY MURKY AREA FOR BOTH THE
 PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS.  THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION HAS NOT
 INHIBITED CONGRESS FROM SEEKING TO LIMIT THE PRESIDENT'S
 AUTHORITY AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF.  WE ARE NOW DEALING WITH THE
 SO CALLED FOLEY AMENDMENT WHICH BARS THE USE OF AMERICAN
 TROOPS "IN AND ABOVE NICARAGUA" UNLESS WE ARE DIRECTLY
 ATTACKED.  THUS DO WE BECOME ENFORCERS OF THE BREZHNEV
 DOCTRINE DE JURE AS WELL AS DE FACTO.
 BUT CONGRESS ALSO HAS MANDATED A LONG SERIES OF DUTIES
 ON THE PRESIDENT, INCLUDING CERTIFICATIONS, HUMAN RIGHTS
 REPORTS ON EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE WORLD, INTELLIGENCE
 OVERSIGHT (CONSISTING OF SEPARATE HOUSE AND SENATE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES, EACH WITH APPROPRIATE STAFF) WHICH
 IN PRACTICE BECOMES FAR MORE THAN MERE OVERSIGHT, AND IS BI-
 PARTISAN ON SOME MATTERS AND EXTREMELY PARTISAN ON OTHERS,
 LIKE NICARAGUA; RESTRICTIONS ON THE SALE OF MILITARY
 EQUIPMENT AND A HOST OF OTHER INTRUSIONS -- SOME USEFUL, SOME
 NOT.  ONE CLEAR RESULT IS A LACK OF SECRECY WHERE SOMETIMES
 SECRECY IS ESSENTIAL AND A LACK OF FLEXIBILITY AND ABILITY TO
 PROMPTLY RESPOND.

 WHILE WE ARE ON THE SUBJECT OF INTELLIGENCE LET ME
 COMMENT THAT SOME SENSE OF REALISM IS MISSING FROM THE BLIZZARD OF
 CRITICISM CONSISTENTLY HEAPED ON THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
 AGENCY.   I AM NuT UNCRITICAL OF SOME EGREGIOUS MISTAKES THE
 AGENCY HAS MADE, BUT "GOING PUBLIC" ON EVERY ONE MAY GET A
 POLITICIANS NAME IN THE NEWSPAPER BUT THE LOSS OF CONFIDENCE
 IN AN ESSENTIAL AGENCY CAN SOMETIMES BE A VERY HIGH PRICE TO
 PAY.   FOR EXAMPLE, JUST CONSIDER THE ENORMOUS DIFFICULTY
 FACING THE CIA IN LEBANON, WHERE THE ONLY WAY TO EFFECTIVELY
 ANTICIPATE AND DEAL WITH RAMPANT TERRORISM IS TO PENETRATE
 SOME OF THESE GROUPS.   THIS REQUIRES PEOPLE WILLING TO RISK
 THEIR LIVES AND WHO ARE ASSIMILABLE INTO THESE TERRORIST
 GROUPS.   I CAN ASSURE YOU CLARK KENT OR EVEN ADMIRAL
 STANSFIELD TURNER WOULDN'T MAKE IT PAST THE FRONT DOOR!  YOU
 WORK WITH WHO AND WHAT IS AVAILABLE AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.
 FROM OUR SAFE AND SECURE WASHINGTON OFFICES IT IS MIGHTY EASY
 TO THROW STONES -- ITS NOT SO EASY TO CATCH THEM.
 ONE VITAL INGREDIENT OF AN EFFECTIVE FOREIGN POLICY HAS
 BEEN MISSING FROM OUR POLITICS FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS -- AND
 THAT IS BI-PARTISANSHIP.  IF ITS YOUR ADMINISTRATION YOU
 DEPLORE THE SNIPING AND CARPING OF WHAT YOU LAUGHINGLY CALL

 THE "LOYAL OPPOSITION"!  BUT IF ITS NOT YOUR ADMINISTRATION
 YOU INSIST THAT YOUR INCESSANT BARRAGE OF CRITICISM IS ONLY
 "DEMOCRACY IN ACTION", AND BESIDES, IT IS CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM
 ANYWAY!
 BUT THE FACT IS THAT SINCE VIETNAM AND WATERGATE, THERE
 HAS BEEN A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE OFFICE OF THE
 PRESIDENT THAT HAS BEEN DOWNRIGHT HARMFUL TO OUR NATIONAL
 INTERESTS.
 OUR CONGRESS IS PEOPLED BY MANY MEMBERS WHOSE HISTORICAL
 PERSPECTIVE BEGAN AT VIETNAM AND THEN SHUT OFF SHORTLY
 THEREAFTER.  THESE MEMBERS RAN ON ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT
 PLATFORMS AND IT BECAME A PART OF THE CULTURE TO QUESTION
 AUTHORITY -- ESPECIALLY PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY.
 WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF STAFF, EVERY CONGRESSMAN
 DEVELOPED THE CAPACITY TO RUN HIS OFFICE AS A MINI-STATE
 DEPARTMENT AND SOME OF THEM DO JUST THAT.  FOR EXAMPLE, MAY

 SECRETARY OF STATE OCCURRED MARCH 20, 1984 WHEN 10 OF THE
 MOST PRESTIGIOUS DEMOCRAT CONGRESSMAN WROTE DANIEL ORTEGA
 THEIR FAMOUS "DEAR COMMANDANTE" LETTER.  SIGNATORIES INCLUDED
 MAJORITY LEADER JIM WRIGHT, THE AFORESAID MR. BARNES, THE
 DEPUTY WHIP BILL ALEXANDER, THE THEN CHAIRMAN OF THE
 PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE, EDWARD BOLAND, THE
 CHAIRMAN OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON ASIAN AND PACIFIC AFFAIRS,
 THE WELL-TRAVELED STEPHEN SOLARZ, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
 SUBCOMMITTEE ON EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST (AND PRESENT
 CHAIRMAN OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE) LEE HAMILTON AND FOUR
 OTHERS.  IN THIS HISTORIC LETTER TO THIS MARXIST-LENINIST
 HEAD OF STATE THEY SAID: "WE HAVE BEEN, AND REMAIN, OPPOSED
 TO U.S. SUPPORT FOR MILITARY ACTION DIRECTED AGAINST THE
 Approved For Release 2009/09/18: CIA-RDP87M00539R002203530057-2
 Approved For Release 2009/09/18: CIA-RDP87M00539R002203530057-2
 PEOPLE OR GOVERNMENT OF NICARAGUA."  AFTER COMMENDING THE
 COMMANDANTE FOR "TAKING STEPS TO OPEN UP THE POLITICAL
 PROCESS IN YOUR COUNTRY" (SOMETHING THAT WOULD SURPRISE THE
 EDITORS OF LA PRENSA, THE HEAVILY CENSORED DAILY PAPER IN
 MANAGUA) AND URGING FURTHER LIBERALIZATIONS, THEY THEN
 "PLEDGE OUR WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS THESE OR OTHER MATTERS OF
 CONCERN WITH YOU OR OFFICIALS OF YOUR GOVERNMENT AT ANY
 TIME."
 AS WE GRAPPLE WITH THE BUDGET, IT SEEMS WE REALLY DON'T
 NEED OUR EXPENSIVE STATE DEPARTMENT; ALL WE NEED TO DO IS LET
 ALL 535 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS KEEP THEIR HANDS ON THE WHEEL OF
 THE SHIP OF STATE AND "AWAY WE GO!"
 LEST YOU THINK THE "DEAR COMMANDANTE" LETTER WAS AN
 ABBERATION, PLEASE RECALL THAT ON JANUARY 11, 1985, 13
 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS LED BY RON DELLUMS OF CALIFORNIA, TED
 WEISS OF NEW YORK, PAT SCHROEDER OF COLORADO, WILLIAM GRAY OF
 PENNNSYLVANIA (CHAIRMAN OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE) WROTE PRIME

 GOVERNMENT'S DELAY IN ITS INITIAL DEPLOYMENT OF CRUISE
 MISSILES AND ASKING THAT HE SERIOUSLY CONSIDER FORMALLY

 MINISTER TO ASK THE SOVIET UNION FOR A "SIMILAR DEMONSTRATION
 OF RESPONSIBLE RESTRAINT CONCERNING THE FURTHER DEPLOYMENT OF
 THEIR THEATER NUCLEAR WEAPONS..."  THE KEY WORDS IN THIS
 LETTER ARE "INITIAL DEPLOYMENT" AS IT APPLIES TO BELGIUM, AND
 "FURTHER DEPLOYMENT" AS IT APPLIES TO THE SOVIET UNION.  BY
 THAT TIME THE SOVIET HAD 350 SS 20'S IN PLACE, BELGIUM HAD
 NONE -- SO GUESS WHO THIS PROPOSED PAUSE FAVORED!
 BUT THE MERITS OF THE LETTER AREN'T THE POINT -- THE
 LETTER ITSELF IS ENOUGH.  EVANS AND NOVAK REPORT ON APRIL 15,
 1985 THAT TWO DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMEN FLEW TO NICARAGUA AS
 ORTEGA WAS IN MOSCOW, AND ACCORDING TO DIPLOMATIC CABLES THEY
 WERE SEEKING HELP FROM THE SANDINISTAS IN CALMING THE
 "CONGRESSIONAL UPROAR" OVER ORTEGA'S TELL-TALE TRIP. A
 DEMOCRATIC LEADER IS QUOTED AS FEELING THAT "THEIR WEEKEND IN
 MANAGUA BROUGHT THEM 'DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO NEGOTIATIONS'."
 WHAT MUST OUR ALLIES AND OUR ADVERSARIES THINK OF US?  WE
 SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME NEGOTIATING WITH OURSELVES!  JUST TWO
 DAYS AGO WE PASSED OUT OF THE HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
 HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 3, WHICH REQUIRES THE PRESIDENT TO
 SUBMIT THE THRESHOLD TEST BAN TREATY TO THE SENATE FOR
 RATIFICATION (THE SAME TREATY THAT WAS WITHDRAWN BY PRESIDENT

 CARTER WHEN THE SOVIETS INVADED AFGHANISTAN) AND REQUIRING
 THE PRESIDENT TO IMMEDIATELY PROPOSE A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN
 TREATY TO THE SOVIETS.  NEVER MIND THAT WE HAVE SERIOUS
 VERIFICATION PROBLEMS AND THE SOVIETS HAVE SHOWN NOT THE
 SLIGHTEST INTEREST IN COOPERATING TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS --
 NEVER MIND THAT AMBASSADOR KAMPLEMAN AND FOREIGN MINISTER
 GROMYKO HAVE THEIR AGENDA ALL DETERMINED - NEVER MIND THAT A
 COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN SHOULD ONLY BE NEGOTIATED WITHIN THE
 CONTEXT OF OVERALL SUBSTANTIAL AND MUTUAL REDUCTIONS IN
 NUCLEAR WEAPONS -- NEVER MIND THE MANY REASONS WHY THIS
 ATTEMPT TO MICRO-MANAGE THE ONGOING ARMS CONTROL TALKS IN
 GENEVA IS SIMILAR TO PERFORMING BRAIN SURGERY WHILE WEARING
 BOXING GLOVES.   THE URGE TO LEGISLATE, TO INTERVENE IN
 COMPLICATED MATTERS THAT WE DIMLY UNDERSTAND IS IRRESISTIBLE.
 MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAN THE RAW PARTISAN POLITICS INVOLVED
 IS THE ABSENCE OF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE TO HELP OUR
 LEGISLATORS APPROACH AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE WE ARE AND HOW
 WE EXTRICATE OURSELVES.
 AS ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI TELLS US, THE LOGICAL EXTENSION
 OF A LACK OF INTEREST IN HISTORY IS A PRE-OCCUPATION WITH
 PERSONALITIES AND PERSONAL INFIGHTING.  AND CLEARLY IT IS

 EASIER TO TAKE POSITIONS ON ISSUES IF THEY ARE IDENTIFIED
 WITH A PERSONALITY OR A POLITICAL PARTY THAT YOU SUPPORT OR
 OPPOSE.  NO ANALYSIS IS REQUIRED.  SIMPLY THE IDENTIFICATION
 OF THE IDEA OR ISSUE WITH THE OBJECT OF YOUR SUPPORT OR
 OPPOSITION.  THUS TO MANY CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS, IF
 PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN ASSERTED THAT IT WAS MIDNIGHT THERE
 WOULD BE A RESOLUTION, WITH BROAD SPONSORSHIP INSISTING IT
 WAS HIGH NOON.   WHERE DOMESTIC ISSUES ARE INVOLVED, THE HARM
 FROM REFLEX OPPOSITION CAN BE MANAGED.   WHERE FOREIGN POLICY
 IS CONCERNED THIS IS NOT OFTEN POSSIBLE.
 WE DON'T SPEAK ANYMORE OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY, BUT
 RATHER OF REAGAN'S FOREIGN POLICY, OR CARTER'S, ALL OF WHICH
 UNDERSCORES THE DISCONTINUITIES THAT HOBBLE US AND NOT OUR
 ADVERSARIES.  WE NEED BI-PARTISANSHIP MORE THAN EVER, BUT NOT
 SINCE THE VERY EARLY DAYS OF LYNDON JOHNSON'S ADMINISTRATION
 HAVE WE SEEN A GENIUNELY BI-PARTISAN FOREIGN POLICY.  THE
 BREAKDOWN OF THE SENIORITY SYSTEM IN THE HOUSE, AND THE RISE
 OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, HAS WEAKENED HOUSE LEADERSHIP TO
 WHERE IT CAN MORE ACCURATELY BE CALLED "FOLLOWSHIP."  I NEED
 ONLY CITE THE LAST FEW MX VOTES AS PROOF OF THIS.
 THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER DIFFICULT PROBLEMS WE MUST

 RESOLVE IF WE ARE TO SURVIVE -- I SOMETIMES WONDER IF A
 LIBERAL DEMOCRACY SUCH AS WE ENJOY -- AN OPEN SOCIETY -- CAN
 EVER "KEEP A SECRET"'?  WE NEED TO HAVE SOME SECRETS, WE NEED
 TO HAVE EFFECTIVE AND NON PARTISAN OVERSIGHT OF OUR
 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, BUT ALL THAT SAID, ARE WE CAPABLE OF
 KEEPING A SECRET?  FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SOURCES WATCH US WITH
 FEAR AND DISMAY.   THE FREQUENCY OF DISCLOSURES OF CLASSIFIED
 INFORMATION DOES NOT INSTILL CONFIDENCE IN THEM THAT THEY
 WILL BE PROTECTED IF THEY COOPERATE WITH US.
 I FEAR THESE REMARKS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY DEPRESSING
 -- AND THAT'S NO WAY TO SPEND YOUR LUNCH HOUR; GETTING
 DEPRESSED.  THERE SURELY IS A BRIGHT SIDE TO MANY FOREIGN
 POLICY ISSUES -- FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE THOSE THAT DESCRIBE
 ITALY AS GENERALLY MARXIST, BUT MORE GROUCHO THAN KARL.
 LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 31,  1979,
 WHEN DENG XIAOPING THE VICE PREMIER OF CHINA VISITED
 LINCOLN'S  MEMORIAL IN WASHINGTON AND THE ILLINOIS DELEGATION
 WAS INVITED TO WITNESS THE CEREMONY.   I ATTENDED, EVEN THOUGH
 I THOUGHT IT A SUPREME IRONY THAT THE HEAD OF THE GREATEST
 SLAVE STATE IN HISTORY WAS TO PLACE A WREATH ON THE STATUE
 OF THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR.  AS I WATCHED  THIS VERY SMALL

 SPRIGHTLY ELDERLY MAN, I REALIZED HE REPRESENTED ONE BILLION
 PEOPLE AND 6000 YEARS OF CULTURE AND TRADITION.  WHAT DID HE
 WANT FROM US -- AN UPSTART COUNTRY BARELY 200 YEARS OLD, MADE
 UP OF POLES, GREEKS, IRISH, BOHEMIANS, GERMANS AND AN ARRAY
 OF ETHNIC, RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY -- WHAT DID HE WANT
 FROM US?  HE WANTED FOOD, TECHNOLOGY, HE WANTED US TO HELP
 PULL HIS NATION TWO CENTURIES FORWARD INTO THE MODERN AGE.
 AND WHY, I ASKED MYSELF, DO WE HAVE THESE THINGS, AND HIS
 GREAT COUNTRY DOES NOT?  AND THE ANSWER CAME TO ME IN A WORD
 -- FREEDOM.
 IN AMERICA THERE ARE NO WALLS AROUND THE HUMAN MIND --
 NO BARRICADES AROUND THE HUMAN SPIRIT -- AND WE SHARE A LEGAL
 SYSTEM DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE WEAK FROM THE STRONG.
 TO THE EXTENT THAT WE LAWYERS HELP MAKE THAT SYSTEM WORK
 WE BELONG IN THE COMPANY OF THE VITAL FEW WHO PRESERVE AND
 NURTURE FREEDOM AND JUSTICE.  NO SMALL ACHIEVEMENT!
