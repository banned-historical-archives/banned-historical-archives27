 those three top leaders and the curious mixture of
 leaders below their level, and the unprecedented degree
 of domination of the governing apparatus (below the
 topmost level) by career military men.  It now (in
 December 1971) appears that the very features of the
 Chinese scene which seemed in summer 1971 to testify
 to Lin Piao's increasing strength -- his domination of
 the central and regional military leadership through his
 proteges, the domination of the re-emerging Party
 apparatus by these and other PLA leaders, and the
 apparent absence of effective civilian control of this
 military-political leadership -- were taking shape in
 Mao's mind as evidence that yet another designated
 successor had over-reached himself and "failed the test."

 MAO'S CHINA, 1962-1971
 Summar  and Conclusions
 As of summer 1971, Mao Tse-tung's China was
 composed of a complex mix of leaders at all levels,
 pursuing a complex mix of policies.  It seemed to be
 Mao's mix -- or, at least, a mix approved by Mao.  But
 it was not a smooth mix, and it was not the mix that
 Mao had had In mind when he had launched the Great
 Proletarian Cultural Revolution more than five years
 earlier.  Some of the most fervent radicals had been
 casualties, the leadership below Mao's level was
 dominated by military figures and included few
 "revolutionary" young people, and some of Peking's
 current policies were such as would have been denounced
 as "revisionist" a few years earlier by Mao himself.
 The curious mixture in the leadership began at
 the very top, whcre since 1966 Mao, Lin I'iao and Chou
 En--lai had been stable as the Big Three.   Mao as chair-
 man of thu Party had remained the dominant figure, the
 prime mover -- a man himself predisposed to a generally
 radical and militant course but demonstrably willing
 (as it 197!) to change course when the realities of the
 world forced a retreat or offered new opportunities.
 Ile was a leader who had set out to produce a radically
 new Communist man but had come to rely primarily on
 professional and relatively conservative military men to
 govern China -- a situation unique among Communist
 regimes, and one about which Mao himself had shown
 some cmbarras--ment.  Lin as the Party's only vice-
 chairman remained Mao's designated successor but also
 remained an en ig,,m , a career soldier who had professed
 allegiance at the top of his voice to Maoist dogmas but
 had clashed with Mao's civilian radical proteges --
 and a watcher in the shadows whose influence on policy
 was impossible to calculate but  ho had seemed to he the

 main beneficiary of the course of Party-rebuilding in
 recent years.  And Chou as the Premier and more
 recently the Party's de facto secretary-general war,
 Mao's principal execu five nand' a credible alternative
 successor -- a man who for many years had been the symbol
 of comparatively "moderate" policies and was now
 presiding over the implementation of both "radical"
 and "moderate" policies and building a new Party apparatus
 designed to be responsive to himself as well as to Lin.
 Immediately ! low this top level, in the Politburo
 and in the other central organs of the Party, the mixture
 was one of proteges of Mao, Lin, and Chou, men who had
 long served with these three principals and had been
 given preferment by them in the Cultural Revolution.
 Although Lin and Chou were themselves Man's longtime
 proteges, below that level those regarded as "Mao's
 men" had often been and perhaps still were in destructive
 conflict with Lin and his group and with Chou and his
 group -- a conflict representing the convolutions of
 Mao's own "thought," his mixed and sometimes incompatible
 intentions.  "Mao's men" (incluling his wife) were a
 group of radically-inclined civilians like Mao himself,
 a group temperamentally better suited to the "destructive"
 than to the "constructive" stage of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion.  This group had recently been diminished by the
 purge or demotion of the two most important of them
 -- Chen I'o-ta and Kang Sheng -- who until 1970 had been
 the fourth-and-fifth-ranking Party leaders.  Lin's
 proteges (including his wife) were the military leaders,
 men who in general were much less, radically-inclined
 than Mao and less than Lin himself:  men who had been
 tinder heavy pressure in the "destructive" stage of the
 Cultural Revolution but who now constituted the strongest
 group in the Party Politburo, who surrounded Lin in the
 Party organ next in importance (the powerful Military
 Affairs Committee, which controlled and directed the
 entire military establishment), and who dominated most
 of the other leading bullies of the re-emerging Party
 apparatus and government machinery in Peking and through-

 out China.  Chou's proteges were fewer -- appearing in
 some of the central Party organs which he was assembling
 and in the government machinery which he headed, especially
 in Party and government bodies concerned with foreign
 affairs; but Chou had visible influence with Mao and
 seemed also to get on very well with the military
 leaders of Lin's group.
 At the provincial level and below, the leading
 Party and government organs were composed of a mixture
 -- a "three-way alliance" -- of military figures, old
 Party cadres, and representatives of mass organizations
 such as the notorious Red Guards.  The leadership in
 Peking had had and still was having a very hard time
 trying to induce these components to work together.
 Mao himself had expressed only qualified satisfaction
 with the leadership down through the provincial level,
 describing the military dominance as "temporary" and
 stating that the true "revolutionary successors" he
 had sought to produce were to be found at the county level
 and below, a generation away from leadership of the
 regime.
 The domestic policies pursued by these ill-
 matched assortments were carried out under the equally
 ill-matched rubrics of "struggle" and "revolutionization"
 on one hand and of "unity" on the other, as Mao insisted
 on having it both ways.  These policies included on one
 hand a continued disruptive purge of the Party at all
 levels and of society as a whole, the Maoist reindoctrination
 of all Party cadres and the sending-down of tens of
 millions of people to the countryside, the radical
 transformation of the educational system on Mao's lines,
 and a continued Maoist emphasis on ideological incentive
 in production.   But on the other hand thy included the
 rebuilding of the Party around military men (rather
 than rehabilitated Party cadres, as Mao originally
 intended) and the downgrading of the revolutionary mass
 organizations from which Mao had expected so much, a
 return to law-and-order and the reorganization of Chinese
 society a, a whole an military lines, the indroctr.ination

 of everyone with Victorian as well. as Maoist virtues,
 and a retreat. from the most extreme economic experiments
 together with an attempt to strengthen the economic
 base by rational. measures.
 Similarly, foreign policy was still conducted
 under the rubric of "struggle" against the "social
 imperialist" USSR and "imperialist" US, and was still
 called "revolutionary"; Peking had made no important
 concession to either of the two principal powers on
 any disputed matter, and Chinese support of guerrilla
 wars and revolutionary forces was still an important
 component of policy.  But Mao and Chou had downgraded
 the cuunter-productive "revolutionary" diplomacy of
 the Cultural Revolution period in favor of building an
 international anti-American united front and had given
 new importance to "people's" diplomacy, had entered
 into talks with the Russians to reduce the threat of a
 Soviet military attack, had welcomed "friendly" Americans
 to China and had gone so far as to invite President
 Nixon to visit.
 The most critical of those policies, both for
 China and the outside world -- those which had determined
 the character of the Party leadership (apparently
 for years to c'mc), and those adopted toward the USSR
 and the US -- were impelled by events which Mao had
 not foreseen.  And they took some years to mix in
 Mao's mind as a coherent set of policies.  Mao had
 surely not anticipated the enormous role -- as of summer
 1971 -- of the PLA and its leaders.  lie had heavily
 purged the military leadership -- as well as destroying
 the Party in 1966-67, but  by August 1967 had been
 forced to recol;nine the extent of his dependence on
 the PLA as an alternative governing apparatus, and --
 perhaps influenced by Lin Piao -- had rejected an effort
 by some of his l icutenants to conduct another large-
 scale purge of the PLA.                      Also by late summer 1967, Mau
 had been forced to recognize the losses inflicted by
 his "revo, Itit ionary" diplomacy, and    probably influenced

 which had been set up to give guidance to mass organizations
 and to conduct the purge of the Party and the PLA --
 were purged for their association with these repudiated
 initiatives and policies, both domestic and foreign.
 Mao did not admit, however, that these things had been
 done in the spirit of his own "thought"; and the primary
 leaders of the CRG, all of them his own proteges,
 remained in his favor.
 The change in Mao's attitude toward the CRG --
 in which his wife was a leading fieure -- proved to be
 gradual and reluctant.  When in March 1968 a small group
 of PLA leaders offended Madame Mao and the CRC, Mao did
 not hesitate to purge them.  Moreover, while lie
 supported Lin and Chou in successfully resisting a call
 from the leaders of the CRC for a larger purge of the
 military leadership at that time, he gave those same
 CRG leader:, the principal roles in Party rebuilding.
 The first substantial change in his attitude may have
 come in July 1968, when he made clear his severe dis-
 appointment with the misbehavior of mass organizations
 -- guided by the CRC -- in what was by then the "constructive"
 stage of the Cultural Revolution.  lie indicated at the
 same time his general satisfaction with the performance
 of PLA leaders as the heads of provisional organs of
 government, and may already have been thinking about
 naming these military men concurrently -- as was done
 in 1970-71 -- to the leading posts in the new Party
 apparatus then being rebuilt.
 A large new factor came into the picture in August
 1968, when Mao was clearly shocked by the Soviet invasion
 of Czechoslovakia.  lie had now to consider the possibility
 of a Soviet attack on China.  By Noveml,er 1968 Mao was
 ready to make a small overture to the incoming US
 administration.

 The bloody Sino-Sovict military cla,:hes of March
 1969 greatly stimulated each of these trends in Mao's
 thinking -- his disfavor for the violently disruptive
 young revolutionaries and their sponsors, his regard
 for the well -disciplined I'LA, and his hatred and fear
 of the USSR.   His felt need to avert a Soviet attack
 and tc prevent the formation of any Soviet-American
 alliance against China became the strongest element in
 his policy.  fie was to define the USSR -- not the US --
 as his "principal" enemy, and to justify both his talks
 with the Russians and his overtures to the US as a means
 of containing this enemy.
 Lin Piao was chosen in the sprint; of 1969 to
 reaffirm Peking's support of revolutionary forces but
 at the same tim' to profess Peking's return to a more
 flexible foreign policy -- including "peaceful coexistence"
 -- and Peking's favor for negotiations.   In September
 Peking agreed to begin talks with Moscow about the
 border, and in December agreed to resume the Sino-
 American talks (and, for the first time, in its Warsaw
 Embassy).  In the same period Lin's PLA was directed
 to restore public order in China -- which meant the further
 > suppress.c:n of unruly mass organizations.
 The related decision to rebuild the Party apparatus,
 around I'LA leaders -- on whom Mao was now doubly
 dependent, both for the governing of China and for
 repelling any Soviet attack -- was apparently made final
 at about this time, autumn 1969.  This decision to
 concentrate power throughout China in the hands of military
 leaders was probably resisted by the leaders of the
 CRC, who stood to lose the most from it.  In late 1969
 and  ;arly 1970 the Central Committee launched an "invest ig: t ir,n"
 of an extremist mass orl'anization close to the CRC
 (an investigation which was to lead k o primary officers
 of the (:IRG); the CRC itself was put out of business
 altogether; and Mao took Party-building out of the hands
 of certain officers of the CPC and placed it in'thr hand:
 of Lin Piao and Chou tin-lai.  Lin's role was apparently
 to be supervisory, while Chou as do facto secretary-general
 was to put together a new Party apparatus for Mao's and
 Lin'.-,; approval.

 The fragile trend toward improving Sino-American
 relations was interrupted in May 1970, when Mao felt
 ?       compelled to denounce new US initiatives in the Indochina
 war.  lie called publicly for a united front of the world's
 people -- including the American people -- against the
 US government.  This concept did not exclude the possibility
 of dealing directly with the US on such matters as
 Taiwan, and Mao soon reaffirmed his willingness to do
 this.
 This range of Mao's policies was ratified by a
 Party plenum of August and September 1970.  That is,
 tl4e plenum criticized and demoted those CRC leaders
 who symbolized repudiated domestic and foreign policies,
 it (apparently) approved the enhanced roles of Lin and Chou
 at the expense of the CRG leaders, and it endorsed the
 initiation of "people's diplomacy" against the US --
 the mobilisation of American popular npinion against the
 Administration.
 The veteran China-watcher lidgar Snow, interview-
 ing Chinese leaders in late i970 and early 1971, found
 Mao to be the man "in overall charge," playing his
 preferred role as the formulator of basic policies,
 withdrawn from the day-to-day administration.  Snow
 fo'nid Chou to have greatly enhanced status as Mao's
 chief executive, "running the country" on a day-to-
 day basis.   Sr:,w was impressed -- rightly so -- by Mao's
 dependence on Ch-au and the military-dominated apparatus.
 But there was a striking lack of reference to Lin 1'iao
 in Mao's remarks to Snow -- an omission which, in
 retrospect, may have meant that Mao even then was
 begin.ting to think about Lin in a new way.
 In talking with Snow, Mao stated clearly, and
 Chou confirmed, that it was Peking's policy to continue
 to explore the possibilities for an iml>rovement in Sino-
 American relations (Mao said lie would be happy to receive
 President Nixon), but that Peking expected such improve-
 ment to derive from popular pressure on the GS Government

 to make concessions to Peking.  Both Mao and Chou
 emphasized the issue of Taiwan, demanding US abandon-
 ment of Taiwan as the price for a substantial improve-
 ment in state relations.
 After the time of the Snow interviews, Peking
 continued to carry out a mixed bag of domestic policies,
 radical and moderate, doctrinaire and pragmatic,
 deriving from Mao's earlier pronouncements or attributed
 to new directives from him.   Party relations with Moscow
 remained broken and the Sino-Soviet border talks remained
 substantively deadlocked, but relations between the two
 governments improved a bit and the border itself remained
 quiet.   In spring 1971, Peking made a striking initiative
 in "people's diplomacy" toward the US with the invitation
 to the US pingpong team and several journalists to
 visit China, and in then inviting President Nixon to
 visit China Peking clearly saw new opportunities
 either for early gains at the government -tc -government
 level or for mobilizing popular pressure on the US
 Administration later if no gains wer^ made at the
 government level.  In all of this, Peking seemed much
 more confident of its position than it had seemed even
 a year earlier -- confidant that its domestic situation
 was in hand, confident that a Soviet attack had been
 averted, and confident that it stood to benefit greatly
 from current international trends even without. making
 substantial concessions.
 In many of Peking's policies, and particularly
 in the skillful conduct of foreign policy, the influence
 of Chou En-lai on Mao was apparent.   Lin Piao remained
 in the background, and the degree of his influence on
 Mao was quite uncertain.  Lin's strength had to be
 inferred -- from the media's treatment of him and
 especially from the course of Party re-building, in
 which professional military men long indoctrinated by
 Lin, many of them his longtime proteges and friends,
 had come to occupy most of the important posts.  This
 new apparatus, however, looked to be equally responsive
 to Chou.

 As of summer 1971, Mao's Cult continued to flourish
 in China, and he visibly dominated gatherings of. Party
 leaders.  All basic policies were still being attributed
 to him, and he was reliably reported to have over-ruled
 some recent decisions made by his lieutenants in carrying
 them out. lie was thought to remain capable of purging
 any other Party leader or small group of leaders, and
 of putting an end to any given "moderate" policy  - such
 as current foreign policy ?- should he decide that it
 was no longer productive.  But it seemed doubtful that
 Mao could successfully conduct another Cultural Revo-
 lution, another great purge of the governing apparatus
 -- which by this time consisted largely of PLA officers.
 Mao seemed to recognize the importance of retaining the
 good will of the military leaders, in order to remain in
 power and to get his policies carried out.
 As of summer 1971, Lin Piao was expected to
 succeed Mao, if Lin's precarious health did not fail
 beforehand.  While it had long been recognized that Mao
 was unstable and that none of his lieutenants was truly
 secure, it was thought probable that Mao would not change
 axis mind about Lin without good cause and that Lin
 would be careful not to give him cause.
 Chou En-lai, by summer 1971, seemed organizationally
 and personally in a good position to succeed Mao if Lin
 were to predecease Chou.  However, Lin and Chou appeared
 to he working well together, and it was thought probable
 that, if Lin were to succeed, they would continue to do
 so.  Chou was expected to have a very strong influence
 on Lin, holding Lin to a generally moderate course.

 Mao, Lin, and Chou were expected to continue to
 use the Politburo Standing Committee, the organizational
 core of power, to reach collective decisions and to
 supervise the Party apparatus. It was thought that if
 Chief-of-Staff  Huang Yung-sheng, Lin's longtime protege
 and Chou's app..rcnt friend as well, were not already
 a de facto member, he would probably be added to replace
 the demoted CRG leaders.  The full Politburo was expected
 to remain less important than the Standing Committee,
 but to continue to be used for discussions and perhaps
 even as a voting body.  Proteges and friends of Lin and
 Chou were expected to continue to dominate the Politburo.
 As of summer 1971, the strongest known component
 of the central Party apparatus was Lin Piao's Military
 Affairs Committee, composed almost entirely of his proteges.
 It was thought possible, hot'ever, that Chou En-lai was
 putting together a de facto Party secretariat at the same
 level to help him to co`arcTinate the political and economic
 work of the apparatus and to work with the MAC.  Any such
 secretariat was expected to include some onetime CRG
 leaders still in favor, some military men, and some of
 Chou's deputies in the governmental structure, and, under
 Chou's leadership, to prove more responsive to the
 Politburo Standing Committee than did the old secretariat.
 The visible portion of the central Party apparatus
 below the level of the Politburo Standing Committee,
 the MAC, and any new secretariat -- that is, the network
 of central departments -- was dominated by military men,
 and most of the rest of it was expected to be.  The
 same trend of military staffing was evident in the
 central government machinery, although Chou's proteges
 were running the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

 The provincial Party apparatus showed the same
 pattern of domination by military leaders, apparently
 reflecting Mao's concern for an effective governing
 apparatus and his decision to put Party-building in the
 hands of Lin and Chou. Twenty of the 29 provincial and
 major municipal committees were headed by career PLA
 officers, and Lin's proteges either headed or were
 among the leaders of all of the most important of them
 -- those that contained military region headquarters.
 In sum, as of summer 1971 Lin and Chou seemed to
 be working together, under Mao's leadership and with
 Mao's blessing, to build a new Party which would be
 responsive to them both as the leaders of a post-
 Mao team or to either one as the principal survivor.

 ANNEX:  MAO'S CHINA, 1962-71
 Preparations for the Cultural Revolution, 1962-65
 In the period 1962-65, Mao Tse-tung became con-
 vinced of the need to make the Chinese Communist Party
 apparatus more responsive to his policies, and to design a
 program to produce "revolutionary successors" in the
 Party leadership and to reinstil "revolutionary spirit"
 in the masses.  fie took several steps in that period to
 prepare for a Cultural Revolution -- that is, for a purge
 and reconstruction of the Party, and a reindoctrination
 of everyone.
 By January 1965 Mao had decided to replace Liu
 Shao-chi, the Party's senior vice-chairman and Mao's
 designated successor, with Lin Piao, long Mao's favorite
 military leader and the chief of the military establish-
 ment (PLA) -- which Mao and Lin had been developing as an
 alternative power structure to the Party apparatus.  By
 the end of 1965, Mao had apparently decided which of his
 lieutenants he was going to purge in addition to Liu
 (including the two ranking officers of the Party secre-
 tariat, Teng ifsiao-ping and Peng Chen), and which other
 of his lieutenants he was going to elevate in addition
 to Lin (including Chou En-lai., long the regime's premier,
 Chen Po-ta, long a factotum for Liao, Kang Sheng, the
 head of Mao's personal. political security force, and
 Madame Mao, a specialist in "culture").
 The        Ste s:  As is now well known, Maoist
 sources assert t at !`ao began to think about his Great
 Proletarian Cultural Revolution -- and the great purge
 which was to be central to it -- as early as January
 1962. At that time, Liu Shao-chi, the Party's senior
 vice-chairman and long `Mao's designated successor, is

 said to have criticized (at a Party conference) some of
 Mao's policies which had suffered disaster in the Great
 Leap Forward and "people's communes" programs.  Mao, Lin
 Piao, and Chou En-lai are said to have stood together
 at that conference in opposition to Liu and others, in-
 cluding Tong Hsiao-ping, the Party's secretary-general.
 That Mao at least by mid-1962 had begun to think
 about Liu and Tong in a new way -- that is, as his op-
 ponents, not his lieutenants -- is suggested by the ap-
 parently authentic text of a Mao speech to a group of
 Party leaders in August 1962.  fie expressed bitter resent-
 ment of the "revisionist" domestic policies forced on him
 by the collapse of the Leap Forward (policies which he
 was later to attribute to Liu and Tong).  He was also
 strongly critical of the way the Party apparatus in
 general had been conducting its work, in contrast to the
 good work of Lin Piao's Military Affairs Committee (MAC).
 At this meeting Mao indicated that he had special trust
 in Kang Shen; and Chen Pu-ta -- two longtime proteges to
 whom he had given many special jobs -- as well as in
 Lin.*
 At a Party plenum the following month, Mao ended
 the period of retreats in domestic policy.  He also
 discussed the threat of "revisionism," and called on
 senior comrades to admit their "mistakes" (admissions
 which were later to prove the key to survival for many
 leaders).  lie also called for the formation of two
 "special examination" groups -- apparently for the in-
 vestigation and evaluation of Party leaders, an operation
 which may have been assigned to Kang Sheng but remained
 CR-ang  a      n Mao 'a foremost specialist in poli ti oa 1.
 security work, and was also a longtime friend of Madame
 Mao 's.   Chen had been Mao 'a foremost  "theorie t " and
 writer, and had prepared the ground for some of Mao'o
 policies and investigated the' implementation of them.

 obscure.  Mao also revealed his awareness that the arts
 in China had been used to state the positions of his
 opponents.
 In the early months of 1963, Mao drafted a ten-
 point program designed to restore collective controls in
 Tura? areas and initiated other-campaigns to correct
 the "revisionist" policies of recent years.  Later in
 1963, in an unmistakable expression of his distrust of
 the Party apparatus, Mao issued his call to "learn from
 the PLA," and PLA officers soon began to take over the
 agitprop function in government organs.
 The Promise of a Purge:  In June 1964 Mao made
 known his concern a out tla problem of developing "revo-
 lutionary successors," and is said to have asserted that
 there were "conspirators" in all of the departments and
 provincial committees of the Party.*  In July, the Party
 set forth a 15-point program to cleanse itself of revi-
 sionism, and pointed publicly to the threat from the top
 level of the Party.  The Party newspaper, Peo le's Daily,
 soon called for a purge of the Party.
 At about the same time, Mao named Peng Chen
 -- second-ranking to Teng Ilsiao-ping in the Party- secre-
 tariat -- to look into the condition of Chinese "culture"
 meaning the threat posed by writers critical of .Mao's
 policies and by their high-level sponsors.  hang Sheng
 was named to I'eng's five-man group.

 mid-July 1965.  The operations of Peng's five-man group

 critics and opponents.*  By this time, Kang had apparently
 become the principal figure in Mao's personal political

 forecast by Mao in 1962.

 The Beginning of the Purge:  The Cultural Revolu-
 tion began uno  icia     in September 1965 at a Party
 conference where Mao called for an investigation of a
 playwright whose work had implicitly criticized Mao's
 policies; Mao again, as in 1964, pointed to "revisionism"
 in the Party apparatus, including the Central Committee.
 Then in early November Mao planted in the Shanghai press
 an article by Yao Wen-yuan (a young man who was to rise
 high on the Revolution) attacking the playwright-critic
 who was to serve as the symbol of all opposition to
 Mao.  Lin Piao's Liberation Army Daily immediately en-
 dorsed the line taken ln the article.   Lin, Chou En-lai,
 Chen Po-ta, Kang Sheng and Madame Mao were all apparently
 apprised of Mao's intention to conduct a large-scale purge
 of the Party.
 Leaving Peking together in late November, Mao and
 Lin took sanctuary in or near Shanghai, under the pro-
 tection of a Military Region Commander (Iisu Shih-yu) in
 whom they had confidence.  They began the great purge in
 the next month, by summoning to their retreat and arrest-
 ing Lo Jui-Ching, the second-ranking leader of the PLA,
 and Yang Shang-kun, director of the Central Committee's
 staff office, two of the men best qualified to lead a
 potential resistance group.

 The First Stage of the Cultural Revolution  1966
 The first year of the Cultural Revolution saw several
 spectacular developments:  the rise of a special Cultural
 Revolution Group, outside the Party apparatus, to conduct
 the great purge that lay ahead; the entrapment and subsequent
 purge of the principal leaders of the Party apparatus, in-
 cluding Mao's then-designated successor; the rearrangement
 of the Party hierarchy and the installation of Lin Piao
 as the Party's only vice-chairman and Mao's newly-designated
 successor; the explosive appearance of the Red Guards,
 as the instrument to attack the Party; ';ao's first call
 for "revolutionary" diplomacy; and the starring role of
 Madame Mao in the first large-scale purge of the PLA.
 The Entrapment of Party Leaders:  By January 1966
 Mao had selecteFihe core of what was to become the cen-
 tral Cultural Revolution Group.  He called together
 Chen Po-ta, Kang Sheng, and Madame Mao (Chiang Ching)
 -- who were to become the three ranking officers of the
 central CRG -- together with a fourth favorite who soon
 died.  In February, Mao, Lin and Madame Mao set in motion
 an investigation of the PLA that was to lead to the
 formation of a special Cultural Revolution Group for the
 PLA, a group which was to be dominated by Madame Mao
 for most of its life.
 In the same month (February 1966), Liu Shao-chi
 and Teng Hsiao-ping, in Mao's absence, approved for dis-
 tribution an "outline report" by Peng Chen's five-man
 group which had been working since 1964.  This report
 minimized "class struggle" -- contrary to Mao's own
 emphasis since 1962 -- and the offenses of right-wing
 writers of the type denounced by Mao.  Thus Liu, Teng
 and Peng -- the three principal leaders of the Party
 apparatus -- all fell into Mao's trap.  Peng was ar-
 rested in late March, while Liu was out of the country
 (sent on a tour of Asian capitals, under the guard of

 another of Mao's personal security men, Wang Tung-hsing).*
 Soon thereafter, an enlarged meeting of the Politburo
 convened by Mao "took the initiative in the solution of
 the Peng Chen problem." Chou Fn-lai, Chen Po-ta, and Kang
 Sheng -- who were to be closely if unhappily associated
 throughout the Cultural Revolution -- were sent to inform
 the existing Party secretariat under Teng Nsiao-ping of
 Mao's "instructions" and of Peng's "crimes."
 The Formation of the Cultural Revolution Grou :
 Before o filly launching the Cultural Revolution  Mao sent
 Lin Piao a letter (the official date is 7 May) which was
 to explain -- or at least justify -- much that was to
 happen in the next five years.  This letter called for
 the PLA to he turned into a "great school" in which the
 PLA would master its military speciality but would also
 study government and education and would become inw.'lved
 In ;agriculture and industry and mass work.  It seer!;
 doubtful, however, that Mao foresaw that within th., next
 year the PLA would become the do facto government of
 China, almost overwhelmed by tfiis range of extra-military
 activity.  Neither, presumably, did he foresee the extent
 to which the PLA would come into destructive conflict     25X1
 with the leaders of the central CRG.
 Sev'ra other important figures -- mainly propaganda
 and political security specialists -- were seized at
 about the name time, but they are not essential to this

 for resolute support of Chairman Mao and permanent adher-
 ence to Mao's thought, and promised harsh punishment to all
 of Mao's identifiable opponents.
 In late May and June, Liu and Teng fell deeper
 into Mao's trap.  When Party committees in cultural and
 educational institutions were reviled and physically
 attacked by revolutionary students and teachers -- pre-
 sumably primed by the new CI2G leaders -- the Party appara-
 tus under Litt and Tenn, sent work-teams to the campuses
 to restore Party control.  Mao then sprang the trap:
 in mid-July he personally criticized the operations of
 the work-teams, and on 5 August, in a personal poster,
 he told the young militants to "bombard the headquarters,"

 the Party apparatus itself.  At that time, "bombardment"
 was apparently meant to lead to radical reform, not
 destruction.
 While Mao was preparing to unveil the Red Guards
 as the main instrument to attack the Party, the Central
 Committee met in early August to approve Mao's design
 for the Revolution and his rearrangement of the Party
 hierarchy.  Lin Piao told the plenum candidly that the
 Cultural Revolution was conceived as a "general examina-
 tion...and general reorganization" of Party cadres.
 With PL,% and Red Guard units in attendance to enforce
 Mao's will, the Central Committee issued a 16-point
 decision giving official form to Mao's S August poster
 -- that is, an authorization for the young revolutionaries
 to attack Party leaders throughout China, attacks which
 in the next year were to bring down most of the members
 of the Central Committee itself.
 This August plenum named Lin Piao as the sole
 vice-chairman of the Party and thus the designated suc-
 cessor to Mao, and confirmed Chou En-l&i as the third-
 ranking leader.  Three Party leaders were added to the
 powerful standing committee of the Poli.tburo:  Tao Chu,
 a regional leader brought in to take over the propaganda
 apparatus, and Chen Po-ta and Kang Sheng.  Liu Shao-chi
 and Teng lisiao-ping were demoted and effectually removed
 from power.
 The Red Guards:  The Red Guards made their public
 appearance in mi -Vugust, and began to "bombard" the
 Party apparatus and everything else that displeased them.
 Their general directive -- to "bombard" whatever they
 liked -- came from Mao and Lin, but their continuing
 guidance came from Chou En-lai and the officers of the
 Central CRG, i.e. the three new members of the Politburo
 Standing Committee and Madame Mao.  Chou was never an
 officer of the CRG, but he appeared frequently with those
 officers and -- as befitted his Party rank -- was the
 most authoritative spokesman for the Party leadership

 below the level of Mao and Lin.  The Red Guards were not
 always responsive to Chou, however, and in the months to
 come some of them were to attack many of Chou's proteges
 and friends and were to aim at Chou himself.*
 The normal procedure for the Red Guard groups
 which fanned out over China in the late summer and early
 autumn of 1966 was to demand that Party leaders every-
 where appear before the masses to admit their errors
 and rededicate themselves to Mao.  These demands were
 often effectively resisted by local leaders with local
 forces, and there was much conflict among and within
 Red Guard organizations (all operating in Mao's name).
 "Revolutionization" in Foreign Affairs:  The Red
 Guards  romt.liie"start  mi -Augustj werelargcly concerned
 with the domestic scene.  However, Mao himself in early
 September foreshadowed the extension of the Cultural
 Revolution into foreign affairs by calling for the "revo-
 lutionization" of Chinese missions abroad and of Peking's
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  There were occasional re-
 ports of attacks on foreigners, including diplomatic per-
 sonnel, and attacks on the 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 and its minister (Chen Yi) began in October.
 The extent of resistance to, and conflict among,
 Red Guard organizations apparently disconcerted the leaders
 in Peking during the early autumn of 1966.  While they
 were deciding what to do about it, they set up another
 4T he Re   Cuar s were rarely given  (ao far as  in  known)
 specific targets.   They were told repeatedly to "inve. -
 tigate" and evaluate.   When in doubt, they were to submi t
 their problem to a Red Guard reception canter in Peking,
 which might pass it to the central CRC, which mi.~;ht pace
 it to the Big Three of Mao, Lin, and Chou.   The final
 decision on a critical matter -- e.g. the removal of a
 provincial first secretary -- was reportedly reserved to
 Mae.

 Cultural. Revolution Group for the PLA alone.  Madame Mao,
 ?        later identified as the PLA/CRG's "advisor," may have been
 its dominant figure from the start.
 During October, regional and provincial Party
 leaders were summoned to another Central Committee work
 conference to hear self-criticisms by Liu and Tong
 (rejected as unsatisfactory), and, more importantly, to
 learn directly from Mao and IJ-a that they would be
 subjected to another wave of Red Guard attacks and must
 try to "pass the test."  The test was to include an abasing
 self-criticism, correction of past mistakes, and support
 of the revolutionary masses.  That is, they would have to
 persuade Mao and Lin, through this process, that they were
 loyal to them.
 The Cultural Revolution moved farther into foreign
 affairs in December.  Diplomatic personnel began to be
 recalled for reindoctrination, and Mao-books and Mao-
 buttons soon began to be distributed through Chinese
 missions abroad.  The thrust of the Red Guard movement,
 however, was overwhelmingly against the !'arty apparatus.
 The Widen.in , Purge of the PLA:  During the car]),
 winter            eta am  filo - - in ffao's absence --
 had the starring role in the Cultural Revolution.   In a
 single incendiary speech in mid-December, the Madame
 denounced the second-ranking officer ot the Military
 Affairs Committee (Ilo Lung, who was genuinely in Mao's
 and Lin's disfavor), marled several second-level Party
 leaders for "rebel" attacks, and called for the destruc-
 tion of the regime's entire public security apparatus
 (although exempting Minister of Public Security Ilsieh
 Fu-chih).   The Madame's speech was soon followed by the
 purge -- almost certainly approved by Mao and Lin -- of
 Ilo Lung and many other central and regional military
 leaders, enough to qualify as a large-scale purge of the
 !'LA in the space of a few weeks.  At the same time, the
 PLA took over the public security apparatus.

 Most of the other top leaders of the Party --
 that is, Lin (who was out of sight), Chou, and the other
 officers (besides Madame Mao) of the central CRG --
 either approved of the full range of the Madame's activity
 or were afraid to interfere with Mao's wife, in the
 probably sound belief that she had Mao's approval.  How-
 ever, one top leader, Tao Chu of the CRC, who had ap-
 parently been the do facto secretary-general of the
 Party as well as its propaganda chief since August, was
 soon purged for attempting to "restrict the scope"
 of the Revolution.  From that time on, the central CRG
 as a whole appeared to be the do facto secretariat of the
 Party, and Kang Sheng reportedly rep acrd Tao as the
 de facto secretary-general.
 Madame Mao's mid-December speech set off the
 movement to "seize power" from below.  This call,
 continuing into January, apparently represented the
 leadership's decision to destroy the existing Party
 and pc"  r.nment -,tructure:: rather than to reform them.
 The violent assault on these structures led to their
 rapid collapse and to anarchy and chaos.  Thus in mid-
 January Mao per:;onally directed Lin Piao to order the
 PLA into action to "support the Left" -- which, at first,
 meant to restore order and to be a de facto military
 government in the name of the Left.

 The Zigs and Zags of 1967
 The Cultural Revolution, on a comparatively
 rightist course in early 1967 with the intervention of the
 PLA, turned left in March as restrictions were imposed on
 the PLA in dealing with refractory mass organizations.
 It turned right again in June, with renewed calls for
 order, and then ultraleft in late July, as officers of
 the CRG tried to Initiate another large-scale purge of
 the PLA leadership.
 In foreign affairs, the movement in this period --
 heavy criticism
 of proteges and  rien s of Chou En-lai's, and with "rebel"
 supervision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  In the
 months to follow, Chinese missions abroad were turned into
 centers for the propagation of extreme features of Mao's
 thought, leading to the international isolation of Mao's
 regime.  This trend reached its peak in August with a
 "rebel" attempt to seize control of the Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs and the burning of the British mission.
 Although Mao himself had provided the atmosphere
 in which "revolutionary" excesses in both domestic and
 foreign policy were committed, in August and September
 1967 he acted together with Lin Piao and Chou En-lai to
 repudiate the ultraleft -- withdrawing the threat to the
 PLA, and putting an end to the highly counter-productive
 period of "revolutionary" diplomacy.  In the final months
 of 1967, several secondary leaders of the CRG were purged
 for their offenses against Lin and the PLA and against
 Chou and the Foreign Ministry; but the ranking figures
 of the CRG, who had probably encouraged the secondary leaders
 in the excesses of July and August, remained in Mao's favor.

 The "Revolutionary Committees":  In January 1967,
 while the PLA was restoring order,  eF~Tcing called for the
 formation of "revolutionary committees" as provisional organs
 of power.*  To function while the Party was being slowly
 rebuilt, these were to be composed of )'LA officers, old
 Party cadres, and representatives of mass organizations.
 Party "core groups" were to be formed within these.**
 The period from late January through March 1967
 was almost too complicated to discuss.  While the PLA was
 taking the Cultural Revolution on a rightist course by inter-
 vening to restore order, and the first of the new revolution-
 ary committees appeared as early as February, one group in
 the leadership tried to turn the Revolution even further
 to the right by restoring old Party cadres to their positions.
 This was the "February countercurrent," later denounced as

 Arm  Laity, also stopped stating publicly thata further
 purge of the PLA was necessary, even though the purge
 continued in an orderly way throughout the period of
 dependenoe .)n the PLA.   At the same time (January 1967)
 the PLA/CRC was reorganized, and a prestigious old
 commander was named to head it; however, Madame Mao was
 now its official "advisor" and effectual chief, and in a
 position to remain the PLA's worst friend.
 **one Party "core group" -- in Shansi, headed by old
 Part;. cadre Liu go-ping -- was identified as early as
 February 1967; the head of another, a PLA figure, was
 identified later in 1907.  Mao's intention through 196?,
 to judge both from appointments made in Z96? and from
 Mao's remarks of late 1967, was to have moat of these core
 groups -- and therefore moot of the Party committees
 eventually to be rebuilt -- headed by old Party cadres.

 the model of an ultra-right initiative.  At the same time
 there was an ire, ortant leftist initiative -- heavy criticism-
 of several        25X1
 government  ea ers, most o  t em regar e  as proteges and
 friends of Chou En-lai.    Members of militant mass organi-
 zations which later merged with the extremely militant
 S/16 Group -- the leader of the attacks on Chou in summer
 1967 -- were active in these first attacks on Chou's circle
 and in such related initiatives as the siege of the
 Soviet embassy.
 At the same time, a "revolutionary rebel" group in
 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs began to "supervise" and
 evaluate -- that is, disrupt -- the work of that Ministry.
 In the months to follow, Chinese missions abroad (even
 in Communist states) were to be turned into centers for
 the propagation of various extreme features of Mao's
 "thought," leading to counter-action by local governments,
 retaliation by Peking, and the international isolation
 of Mao's regime.  Foreign Minister Chen Yi -- who object-
 ed strongly to all this -- was to be a casualty of the
 period. and not even Chou En-lai could restore him to
 favor.*
 Restrictions on the PLA:  By mid-March, the Great
 helmsman-Ha  Concluded -t a  t e Revolution as a whole
 was veering too for to the right.  The PLA, he decided,
 had made many "mistakes" in sorting out the true Left,
 had acted too vigorously against mass organizations and
 had suppressed too many obstreperous ones.  As a related
 - Mao In Mara~__again contributed to the atmosphere
 in which these things were done; he was quoted ac calling
 for Red Guards to be "international" as well as
 internal revolutionaries.   He made other such remarks
 in subsequent months, encouraging the whole spectrum of
 "Red Guard diplomacy."

 trend, too many old cadres given preferment by generally
 conservative PLA leaders were showing up in the new
 revolutionary committees.  Lin Piao in a 30 March speech
 told PLA leaders that they would henceforth be restricted
 in their use of coercion against mass organizations and
 that PLA units would not be permitted to take any
 important action as regards these organizations without
 first getting instructions from Peking.  In April, Mao
 himself told a Party work conference that there should
 be more young people in the new revolutionary organs,
 and introduced a new kind of three-way alliance:  along
 with the existing alliance of the PLA, old cadres, and
 the revolutionary masses, there was to be an alliance
 of the old and middle-aged and young.
 With this turn to the left, Peking initiated a
 new stage of "criticism and repudiation" of Liu Shao-chi
 (i.e. of the policies attributed to him), and together
 with this a massive campaign of "struggle-criticism-
 transformation" of all organizations in China.  All of
 these things -- Mao's and Lin's directives and the new
 campaigns -- combined to encourage the mass organizations
 to unprecedented violence in the months ahead.
 Troubles with Mass Organizations:  In May and early
 June there were renewed calls for order, and on 6 June
 a CCP Central Committee directive called officially for
 an end to various offenses by mass organizations (assaults,
 destruction of property, looting, unauthorized arrests),
 and gave the PLA the responsibility for enforcing the
 order.  Mao did not yet, however, authorize the PLA
 to use the necessary force, so mass violence of course
 continued.  A decision was soon made to send delegations
 around China to negotiate agreements between contending
 mass organizations.
 Hsieh Fu-chih (still Minister of Public Security,
 although the PLA had taken over his apparatus) was chosen
 to lead the first of these touring delegations, accompanied
 inter alia by a secondary leader of the central CRG.  Soon
 thereafter, Mao himself -- accompanied by C/S Yang Cheng-

 wu and others, including his personal security man Wang
 Tung-hsing -- began a tour of several provinces of
 eastern and central China.  Mao was to remain out of
 Peking for the entire summer, and thus in a position to
 disavow later some of the extreme actions taken by some
 leaders in Peking in the period -- even though these
 things were done in the spirit of Mao's directives.
 The CRG's New Initiative Against, the PLA: The
 already agitate  situation in China as o  July 1967 --
 with Red Guard organizations attacking anything they
 chose, and proving in general unresponsive to calls for
 order from Peking -- was brought to a boil in mid-July
 by the Wuhan Incident.  This was the failure of the
 Wuhan Military Region commander to protect Hsieh Fu-
 chih's delegation against local Red Guard organizations
 which had refused to accept a ruling against them made
 by the central CRG
 and which roughed up the delegation and kidnapped one
 of its membors.  Mao, out of Peking at the time, very
 probably approved the swift and harsh counter-action
 taken by other leaders, but mar not have expressly
 approved the threat -- developing at the end of July to conduct a larger purge of the PLA, and he sub-
 sequently treated this threat as if it had been made
 entirely on the initiative of certain leaders of the
 central CRG.
 The Wuhan commander was brought to Peking In
 the week of the Wuhan Incident and was broken.  At the
 same time, Madame Mao -- possibly on Mao's explicit
 order -- turned up the fire by calling for mass organi-
 zations to be given arms (by the PLA) for action against
 their enemies (whom they often regarded as including the
 PLA).  Lin Piao and Chou En-lai were both associated with
 this new order
 /although Chou attempted
 to place restrictions on the use of these arms..  In
 late July, many regional leaders and commanders of
 armies were summoned to Peking to be warned in strong

 terms about disobedience to and evasion of orders from
 Peking -- admonitions which were also to be expected.
 but at the end of July Red Flak (the Party theoretical
 journal supervised by Chen Po--ta and edited by two other
 CRC officers) called unmistakably for another substantial
 purge of the PLA.  Whereas previous commentaries (in Red
 Flag, Peo ale's Daily, and the Liberation Army Dail y)  afi ~lc'
 condemneis a b d"`is dful" of military  ea ers in Me
 Wuhan area and had argued that they were not representative
 of the PLA as a whole, the Red Flag editorial broadcast
 on 30 July call?d for the purge of a "handful" still in
 K wer in the PEA leadershi .  People's Daily, L  e3fira on
 yDai K, and 'e ing  adfo in the next 10 days -- as
 Tate---as 8 August -- repeated the Red Flag call for a
 purge of the existing PLA leadership.
 The Repulsion of the CRG's Initiative:  Lin Piao
 did not associate Ti mse f with t He late  u y and early
 August call for a larger purge.  Lin set forth his own
 position on 9 August in some tough "instructions"
 to a number of central and regional military leaders,
 in the presence of senior officers of the central CRC.
 His emphasis was very strong on the need for avoiding
 mistakes by seeking guidance from the Party center, in
 particular from Chou En-lai and the senior officers of
 the CRG, but he did not speak of any concomitant ne"d
 for any purge of the PtA leadership beyond the Wuhan
 group.
 Lin may have played an important role in getting
 that line withdrawn.  The original threat to the PLA may
 have been in accord both with Mao's sentiments and his
 own at the time, but Lin, after consulting his proteges
 and friends among the military leaders and examining the

 reports of Red Guard excesses in late July and early
 ?        August, may then have taken the initiative to ask Mao
 to make clear that the menacing line was not approved.*
 Whether as a result of Lin's initiative or not, the
 decision to retreat from that line was apparently made
 within a day either way of Lin's 9 August speech.  The
 line last appeared on 8 August.  It did not appear
 thereafter even in contexts in which it would be
 expected; for example, in subsequent discussions of
 disgraced military leaders such as Peng Te-huai and
 Lo Jui-ching, the call for further action against such
 scoundrels was confined to Party leaders.
 In any case, whether on Mao's initiative or on
 Lin's, the line was clearly withdrawn by 11 August.
 Chen Po-ta and Madame Mao, speaking to Red Guard groups
 on that date, both backed away from the S/16 Group and
 from the call for another purge of the ILA.  Possibly
 because the new line ?- forbidding threats against and
 attacks on the !LA -- was not known to come from Mao
 himself, it was not immediately effective; it proved
 necessary to reiterate it in stronger terms on
 4Mao` fimce   might have taken the initiative.  He
 had access to the same alarming reports that Lin had,
 and may have seen some alarming developments on the
 spot.  For example, it may have been at just this time
 that Neu Shih-yu, the commander of the military region
 in which Mao Was staying, was forced to flee for hie
 life, first to Shanghai where Mao was, then to Peking
 with Mao.  There is a smaller possibility that Lin
 took action to end the threat to the PLA without
 consulting Mao at all, and presented the chairman
 with an accomplished fact.

 up "Vice-Chairman Lin as our brilliant example."

 initiatives which would mobilize the American people
 against their govcrtuncnt (as suggested by Mao in his

 During the spring of 1971, Poking continued to
 carry out a mixed bag of domestic policies, radical and
 moderate,  doctrinaire and pragmatic, which either derived
 from Mao's earlier pronouncements or were attributed to
 new directives from hin,  Some of these were almost
 certainly the product of the thought and influence of
 Chou En-lai.   Party rebuilding around PLA leaders
 proceeded steadily, with the main beneficiary appearing
 to be Lin Piao.   A striking initiative in "people's
 diplomacy" -- in which Chou's influence seemed especially
 strong -- raised hopes for an improvement in relations
 between Peking and Washington, but. Chinese conditions
 for an improvement on the state level remained hard.
 The  status of several Chinese leaders seemed to hc,
 clarified in the period, while that of other:; remained
 to  :c'I'ta i))  or  became  so.

 of the regime's domestic policies under the rubric of
 "revolut.ionization" as defined by Moo.   The ''reveluticm-

 in Mao's thought,  its involvement in all kinds of non-
 military activity,  and  its preparation:, for ''people's
 War."   1he "educational rovolul.ion" included the ;Maoist
 content of the courses, the non-intollectuc:l or even
 anti - int cl l ec?tual character of teachers and  students,
 the combi))n.tion of study and labor.   The "ideoloc,icni
 revolut ioni at ion  of the people" meant the class
 strugg1c, the emphasis.; on ideological  incentives  in
 promoting production,  the "struggle-criticism-transforna..

 for "revolutionary successors," the concurrent purging
 of  the  Party and  the  rigorous  examination  of  candidates.
 But China's reconstruction could be viewed in
 less dramatic terms, even by some Chinese officials.
 The Chinese leader:; could be seen as concerned mainly
 with restoring order (militarizing Chinese society in
 the process), rebuilding the educational system to
 reduce the distance between the intellectuals and the
 masses,  indoctrinating everyone with old-fashioned
 virtues such as hard work and self-reliance and self-
 sacrifice, steadily strengthening the military est.ablish-
 mont, at temptini, to strengthen the economic base through
 administrative decentralization and regional self-
 sufficiency (with "preparations against war" now
 important chieFly as an ideological incentive to pro-
 mote production), streamlining and restn.ffing the

 leaders of the PLA were to see another purge on that
 scale shaping up, they would make  common  cause against
 Mao -- rind that they would prevail.   Since mid-1907, Mao
 himself had seemed to show a  good sense of his dependence

 Lin Pico:   There way, a reasonable doubt at to
 whether LiiT7'-igh.i-le second-ranking,  was  truly second in
 importance.   This doubt derived from Lin's long disappear.
 antes, the poor impression he made when he did appear,
 the possibility that he was seriously ill, and the
 relative difficulty of demonstrating Li.n's influence (as
 distinct from Mao's) on policy -- whereas Chou En-lai
 was furiously active and seemed almost tireless,
 dazzled almost everybody, and, on his record,  was
 easier to associate with the relatively moderate
 policies since the Ninth Congress than Lin was.
 But the disappearances in themselves did not.
 really matter, as that was Lin's style, just as  it was
 Mao's, and Lin was thought to be working with Mao most
 of the time that he was out of sight.   The poor impression

 action -- acting effectively and decisively, even
 repelling initiatives by other lenders.   For example,

 had again called  for a larger purge,  in the entire course

 Lin 'S  influence since 1968 had been more often
 visible in personnel appointments than in policy.  As
 a result of these, appointments, Lin's position in the
 structure of power seemed to be very strong and growirg
 stronger.  As argued in previous papers, Lin over-
 whelmingly dominated, through his proteges, the central
 military leadership in Peking and the powerful military
 region headquarters (the only regional authorities).
 Arid he had more recently come to dominate through his
 proteges the most important of the provincial Party
 committees, and several of the less important, and other
 proteges and comrades were moving increasingly into key
 positions  in the contra) Party and government structures.
 This (lid not scorn to be coincidental..   Lin seemed to
 be working deliberately -- with Chou Iln-lai's apparent
 consent and assistance, and with Mao's presumed approval
 -- toward a position in which he could dominate
 the decision-making process and policy-implementing
 machinery 'after Mao's death.
 It'was tho::g;tlt that there would he neater
 limi?tationn on lain Piaao as Mao's  succes  or than there
 were on Mau.   Lacking ;tea's charisma,  Lin would probably
 be unable  to  go as far in a radical direction as Mao had
 gone and still could go.   And there would be the same
 basic limitation:   Lin like Mao would be heavily
 dependent on his PLA comrades, and in a poor position to
 undertake any large-scale purge of them in a now
 Cultural Revolut ir,~i?    Lin's choice of both allies and
 enemies     hi:. sees,iiagly good relations with Chou
 and conservative military men, and his seemingly poor
 relations with the radicals of the CRC -- suggested
 that he was not so predis=posed to radical pol icies
 as Mao.   And he had shown an even stronger sense of
 his dependence on the PL:1 -- as witness his behavior
 in the wake of the 1h1'uhan Incident and the Yang Cheng-
 wu ra:;c.                         It was thought even possible that. Lin had
 departed from Mao's policy on those occasions -- not

 Chou fin-lai :  A good case could be made for
 Chou raLTicr             n as the successor:  on the grounds
 of his intelligence, his wide experience and great
 ability, his popularity (even with Lin's proteges and
 comrades), and his strong positions in the Party apparatus
 and  government machinery.   But Chou had apparently
 made the fund,vnental decision of his life more than 35
 years before, at the Tsunyi conference:   to support
 Mao, rather than to bid for first place himself.   And
 he had indeed supported Mao ever since, at every turn.
 As another observer had said, there had never been,
 and there was not now, a "Chou faction," in the sense
 of a Chou-led group seeking Chou's advancement at the
 expense of Mao.
 To judge from his behavior in the Cultural
 Revolution (especially the course of Party rebuilding)
 Chou extended that decision to include Lin:   to work
 feitlifully for Liri, to do his best for him.
 The Lin-Chou relationship had seemed to be a
 g,pod one.   They were temperamentally different types,
 and there was nothing in the record to indicate a close
 personal friendship.  But the record seemed to show that
 they had worked well together:   that after 1966  (when
 certain difference, had been apparent) they had played
 mutually supporting roles in the Cultural Revolution,
 and had cooperated closely in Party-building, giving
 preferment in genera] to those with records of successful

 In matters of policy, Li.n's predispositions, if less
 radic?~I than Mao's seemed more radical. than Chou's, but
 Chou was expected to exert a very strong influence on
 Lin through the frill range of policy, and to have virtual ly
 a free hind in the conduct of foreign Policy.   In other
 words, Lin appeared to recognize his dependence on Chou
 for manal'emeht just as he recognized his dependence on
 the PLA for power.  Chou's influence, like that of Lin's
 military comrades, seemed likely to move Liii  in a moderate
 direction -- that is, toward the right side of the range
 of Maoist policies to which Lin had sworn fidelity.
 Thus the prospect for Chou seemed what it had
 always been:       to remain the indispensable man, with
 strong influence on the chairman.

 above, T1aohail alwciys; secincdto be at trc center of
 the decision-making process, as he told Snow:   pointing,
 the direction and signing the directives; and with the
 dominance to carry other Party leaders with him at
 whatever point he made up his mind.            Iiowever, Mao
 had probably not reached Iii.s most important decisions
 in isolation; he had consulted Lin Piao  (believed to be
 almost constantly with him) and Chou En-1ai  (lii.s principal
 executive), he had operated through the standing committee
 of the Politburo, and he had sometimes worked through
 the full  (voting) Politburo.
 The organizational. core of power in China was
 the Politburo standing comniittce, not the full Politburo.
 This was because the standing committee was empowered to
 act  or the Politburo when the Politburo was not in
 session, and the Politburo was not often in session,   In
 practice, this meant that the Politburo  standing committee
 made those dcci sion s which the Party's officers
 (Mao and  Lin)  had not already matic,  including the
 decisions as to which policy matters to pass on to the
 full. (voting) politburo  for a vote or for discussion.
 In other words, the Politburo did not even consider a
 policy matter unless the Politburo standing committee
 wanted it to do so.   The Politburo standing committee
 also set up and supervised the entire Party apparatus,
 including the Military Affairs Committee which for some
 years hr;d bc- n the most  important. component of it.
 Between the end of 1966 and the winter of 1909-70,
 the Po] itburo standing committee had consisted of the Big
 Three of Mao, Lin and Chou, plus Chen Po-ta and Xang
 Shen};, the two ranking  leaders of the central  CI:G.   Tllis
 meant that there were four left-iticlincd leaders  (Mao,  Lin,
 Chen and };ant;) and only one right-inclined leader (Chou)
 in the organizational  core of porker.   As it had turned
 out, however, Chen and hang had takers up positions which
 Mao defined as ultra-left and unacceptable, and they it
 decline was almost certainly due in part to opposition

 Thus since the winter of 1969-70 or tlrcrc:lbout:s the

 and Chou,  whethar  operrtt.irlg; formally as the three
 remaining active members of the standing; committee or
 just meeting; informally as three old comrades who had
 worked well together for more than 35 years.  Chen

 standing; committee, and Kang Sheng, while perhaps
 nominally still a member, was probably not active in
 th:i s role.   Char and Kang; probably had been or were
 soon to be replaced by one or two other figures.
 The composition of this standing committee was
 an important  matter,  particularly under a leader less
 personally dominant than Mao.   The rcpiaccment or
 replacements for Chcn and Kang would presumably be

 As previously argued, tlhe Pol i tburo was probably
 of greater importance as a sounding-board and discussion

 The Central Party Apparatus:   Peking had told the
 world very~~L-t.lc~,il~out ~LrTic 'r-eii Trging central Party
 apparatus below the Politburo level.
 The best.-known component was tl'e Military Affairs
 Committee (MAC), which was responsive directly to the
 Politburo standing committee and which controlled the
 PLA,   Apart from Lin Piao as the de facto chief (Mao was
 the chairman) and three vice                   inactive), the
 officers of the MAC had not been identified for more
 than three years.   Ilowever, the key figures (the MAC
 standing comm i ttce members) were believed to he more or
 less tho    reported in 1.961), with one dropped and one

 the military chief in 1959, an'] chosen for his cl i to team
 in the (:u].tural Revolution.   Some of these men had long been
 close to Huang Yung-sheng as well.
 The only )'arty organ below the level of the Polit-
 buro standing committee with the potential to be as power-
 ful as the MAC already was would be a now Party secretariat.
 As noted previously, the cent.ra- Cl,,(; had reportedly functioned
 as the do facto secretariat after mid-19(6, but the new
 Party c:oiis:titution of 1969 had made no provision for a new

 Only a few of the other central departments of

 a few of their officers had been identified.  11owever,
 of the few identified and reported officers and of the
 many other persons known to be working in the central
 apparatus in unspecified posts, there was a very high
 proportion of ILA officers.
 The staff office was known to be operating, with
 broad responsibilities in the Party's administrative
 and political security work.   Its director was perhaps
 still Wang Tung-hsinlg, Mao's man, but its only recently-
 identified officer was a PLA leader, Yang Tc-chung.*
 Another PLA leader might have taken over the section
 charged with the physical. security of Party leaders.

 in operation.   Its director was said to be a little-

 Yao Wen-yuan of the old central CIW had been surmised
 to supervise or head this department; if not Yao, the
 head was probably a PLA officer.   Snow had found PLA
 men to dominate the propaganda apparatus at every level
 encountered, and, of a group of six recently-identified
 directors of central propaganda organs likely to be
 officers of the propaganda department, four were PLA
 officeers. *
 The international liaison department, dealing
 with foreign Communist Parties and highly important
 in the conduct of foreign policy, was known to be
 operating, headed by Keng Piao, a longt .~.ane protege of
 Chou En-lai.   Most of the apparent deputies were old
 cadres, but some were PLA officers.
 The relatively unimportant united front depart-
 ment had been the first to be surfaced, but none. of its
 officer.. had been identified.  The likely candidates were
 mostly old cadres.
 None of the departments of the "production" area
 of the central. Party apparatus --? e.g. economic planning,
 finance and trade, industry and commerce, rural wort. --
 had been identified or reported.  The experience of the
 PLA in supervising and performing such tasks in recent

 been given by Peking, and whose departments had not
 been otherwise identified or surmised.  Of these,
 more than half of those whose backgrounds were known

 the work of all of the ministries of machine building*;
 and military control. commissions had been given "super-
 visory" authority over almost all central government organs,
 including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Chou En-tai
 as premier had been hyperactive, without PLA supervision
 except through Lin Piao on the Politburo standing
 committee, and with Li lisien-nien as his principal deputy.
 None of th^:- old staff offices, coordinating the work
 of the var3.ous kinds of ministries, had been reported
 as back in business.  Many of the ministries had been
 merged, and some ministries and commissions had been
 abolished.   As things stood in August, some 26 ministries
 and commissions had been reported by Peking as active
 again.  Of the 26, the leading groups of two, National
 Defense and Foreign Affairs,  were well known.   Lin
 dominated the former directly and through his proteges,
 and Chou dominated the latter through his proteges,
 although several PLA figures had been added to the MFA

 those,  .vcn were PLA officers, who (judging from the one
 observed case) retained their PLA affiliation and wore
 their uniforms.  Many other military men appcared in
 the lists of functionaries of unidentified departments
 of the State Council  (central government), and many
 of these were expected to appear in key posts in the
 ministries and commissions thus far surfaced and yet to
 be surfaced.   In sum, as was found to be the case with
 the central. Party apparatus, most of the visible central
 government ri;ehinery below the level of. Chou and his vice-
 premiers was dominated by military men, most of the rest
 was expected to be, and Chou seemed to be assembling a
 government machine which would be responsive to Lin as
 well as to himself.

 The greatest interest in the central government
 machinery was of course in those key positions which
 it was expected -- would be announced by the NPC
 in the near future.   It was possible that Mao would
 decide to be chairman of the PI1C again (a post which, it
 was now Ialown, he sought to relinquish before the failure
 of the Leap Forward, but which many observers had seen
 as a demotion) or Lin might take it to further case
 the transition.  Several old-timers were eligible to
 replace Chu '1'e as the head of the NPC standing committee.
 But  it did not seem Eo matter who held these ceremonial
 posts.   It seemed virtually certain that Chou would
 continue as premier (there was no one else who could
 do this job -- by far the most important in the government
 -- anything like as well), and that a protege of Chou's
 (such as acting minister Chi Peng-fei) would be named
 Minister of Foreign Affairs, despite rumors that Mao's
 man Yao.Wen-yuan would get this post.   (Yao would
 seem unsuited to flexible diplomacy.)   Lin Piao was
 expected  to continue to dominate the Ministry of National
 1)efen:,e, through a protege such 1I s lluang Yung-sheng if
 Lin did not want to keep the post himself.   If the staff
 offices were resalrrect:cd, men close to Lin were expected
 to appear at the head of at least those concerned with
 machine-building (weapons) and with internal security.
 As for specific ministries and commissions, proteges of
 Lin were expected to head the Scientific $ Technological
 Commission, the Ministry of Seventh Machine-building
 (missile:,:   a Lin protege was already in this post.),
 and the Mini.1trv of Public Security.  Aside from this,
 it seemed that l.in could afford to give Chou a free
 hand in naming the heads of staff offices and ministries
 and  commissions,  secure in the knowledge that Chou would
 name the best men he could find, whether PLA leaders
 or old Party and government cadres.
 The Provincial. Part} A; paratus:   The provincial
 Party apparatus -- that is, the new Party committees in
 the 26 provinces and three major muni:.ipalities -- had
 shown the same pattern of domination by the military that
 had 1:, yen seen in the revolutionary committees that pre-

 ceded t.heni and were now subordinate to them, and in the
 visible portion of the central Party apparatus and
 central government machi.nery.  Of the 29 committees,
 20 were headed by career PLA officers (12 commanders,
 eight polit:i ail officers, all of whom had apparently
 retained their military posts concurrently), seven by
 old Party cadres (mostly serving as political officers
 concurrently), and two by men who had devoted much of
 their careers to security work of various kinds.   In
 most of the provinces :n which the first secretary was
 an old Party cadre rather than a career PL/1 officer,
 the next two ranking secretaries were career military
 men.   In only one case was there a representative of
 mass organizations ;revolutionary youth) among the three
 ranking secretaries of the new committee.
 The composition of the secretariats of the new
 provincial Party committees was not radically different
 from the composition of the revolutionary committees
 which they had displaced as the principal governing
 bodies..  In the great majority of cases, the new first
 secrctr4-y had been the chairman of the revolutionary
 committee, and the other secretaries had been officers
 of it.   In most of the few exceptions to this pattern,
 the old head of the revolutionary committee had
 proved unable to deal effectively with factional activity
 and had been removed from his post some months or
 even years before the new Party committees were formed.
 This question of the composition of the new Party
 committees was almost certainly one of those that had got
 Chen Po-ta and Kang Sheng into trouble.   1''hcrcas Mao
 had originally envisaged rehabilitated Party cadres as
 the leading elements of the new Party committees and
 as late as spring 1969 seemed to be calling for an
 upgrading of the position of representatives of mass
 organi.:ati.ons, his main concern had apparently come to
 be the establishment of an effective governing apparatus
 at the provincial level, which meant the domination of
 the new Party committees by military leaders and the

 virtual exclusion of the young revolutionaries who had
 pers.istecl in "factional" activity.   By autumn 1.969, the
 central CRG was being asked to confirm in their leading
 positions the military men whom they had most offended,
 and to cut away their own political base.  With the
 assignment of Party-rebuilding; to Lin Piao and Chou
 En-lai in late 1969 or early 1970, Chen and hang were
 on the way out, and were finished by n'id-1970.
 The new Party committees strikingly displayed
 proteges of Lin Piao in the most important posts.  Even
 more markedly here than in his reconstruction of the
 central Party apparatus, Chou seemed to be self-
 abnegating and to be doing his best for the designated
 successor.
 Of the 29 provinces and major municipalities, 11
 -- ten provinces and Peking -- contained the headquarters
 of military regions (MRs).   Of these 1.1 strategic
 committees,  seve1.1  were headed by protege:, of Lin Piao,
 and in the other four cases proteges of Li.n ranked
 second or third among the secretarics.*   In seven of
 these most important committees (Kiangsu, Kiwwangtung,
 Liaoning, llupei, Fukien, Shantung,  Sinkiang), proteges
 of Lin, headed two    (Ki.angsi and Tsinghai), old cadres
 who had worked for Lin in the past and whom he may have
 sponsored more recently headed two others (llonan and Hopei),
 ~In one of the; e four cases --  the Yunnan committee --
 a longtime protege of Lin was scheduled to become the
 first secretary of the new Party committee but died sud-
 denly (possibly by assassination) in December 1370; his
 deputy wac: then named first secretary, a protege of a
 Lin protege was moved in from another area to take the
 post of second secretary,  and an "old friend" of Lin's
 was named to the third spot.

 the proteges of Lin proteges headed two (Kwcichow and
 Ile 11ungkiang) , and there were Liri proteges; among the
 lesser figures of one of these (Ilopci) and four others
 (Hunan,  Kwangsi, Kirin and Tientsin).   In eight of the
 29 there were no visibl.c proteges of Lin's:  Shanghai,
 Anhwei, Chekiang, Shensi, Shansi, Inner Mongolia, Tibet,
 and Ninghsia; in some of these cases, however, the leaders
 included men singled out by Lin for special favor during
 the Cultural Revolution.   In only one case -- Shanghai --
 was the new committee headed by someone who was a protege
 of  another  primary  leader (Mao),  in  this  instance  a
 person probably uncongenial to Lin (Chang Chun-chino
 of the old central CRG), but Shanghai ws not a base of
 significant military power.  While there was a striking'
 absence of proteges of Chou En-lai in these provincial
 and major municipal Party committees, this provincial
 Party apparatus, like the central. Party apparatus and
 central. government  machinery,  was expected to prove
 responsive to Chou and others (e.g. Huang Yung-sheng) if
 Lin were out of the p.ictuae.
 The chief problem for Peking, with respect to
 this new provincial ]'arty apparatus, s;een1ed to lie
 in working out the relationship between the military
 structure which had been the real governing apparatus
 outside Peking for the past four years and the Party
 structure which was eventually to replace it as the primary
 instrument of command and control.   For one thing, there
 was no known party secretariat equivalent: to the MAC
 to dir.Z---7j,-e party apparatus.  At the provincial  level,
 Peking had of course reduced its problems in one sense
 by giving the. great major=.ty of Party pests to PLA
 leaders concurrently, but. it was uncertain which chain
 of command-and-control  they would obey.   Moreover,
 in the  cases  of those committees headed by old Party
 cadres,  it was at least questionable whether the military
 leaders of the area who were in subordinate positions on
 the Party committees Would accept the leadership of the
 cadres rather than responding only to orders from the
 MAC: and the MR commander:.   Further, absence of a

 regional Party apparatus meant that the most important
 figures outside Peking for some time to come would
 continue to be the leaders of the MMR headquarters, who
 could not be given orders by any provincial leader and
 might regard themselves as entitled to give orders to
 civilian provincial leaders.*  However, whatever the
 problems with chains-of-command and lateral relationships,
 the provincial Party apparatus seemed to be one which,
 in general, would work well for Lin and/or Chou.
 The Leadership in Sum: As of summer 1971, Mao
 was expected  o continue to dominate the Chinese leader-
 ship until his death or disablement, and to be able -- if
 he so chose -- to reverse any of the current "moderate"
 policies.   He was not expected to attempt to carry out
 another Cultural Revolution -- the only venture which
 seemed likely to result  in his overthrow.  The Party,
 governmental, and military structures were expected to
 be generally responsive to him.   Lin Piao  was  expected to
 succeed, but not to dominate the leadership to the degree
 that "lao had.   Chou En-lai was expected to be even more
 important to Lin than he had been to Mao, and to have even
 more influence on Lin than he had had on "fao, holding
 Lin more to the right than he had been able to hold Mao.
 While there could be no guarantee that Lin and Chou would
 work well together, they were expected to do so.   The
 military establishment which Lin had built was expected to
