 II. THE CPSU PROGRAM
 A.  Development of the Postwar CPSU Training Program
 1.    From the end of World War II until the death of
 Stalin (March 1953), the CPSU program for training Commu-
 nists from Free World CP's was very limited.  About 1953
 the program began to expand and to enter what appears
 to have been a period of experimentation.  This period
 lasted until about 1956.  The current CPSU program may
 be said to stem from that date.  Since 1956 an increasing
 number of Free World CP's have participated in what is
 evidently a planned and regulated program that is still
 expanding.
 Program to 1953
 2.   In the years immediately after the war the
 majority of trainees from Free World CP's are believed
 to have been either Communists resident in the USSR during
 the war who delayed their return home in order to complete
 some training, or exiles from their own countries who
 enrolled in CPSU training schools to occupy themselves
 as well as prepare themselves against the day when they
 could return home.
 3.   There is evidence that by the early 1950's Communists
 from at least a few Free World CP' s were going to the
 USSR for training.  Although the CPSU had apparently begun
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01100170011-9
 to expand its training program for foreign Communists,
 these efforts appeared tentative and haphazard.  In the
 case of a few CP's, one to three months of training were
 reportedly given during visits of some individual party
 members to the USSR -- but without prior arrangements
 or planning.  In the case of a very few parties, there is
 evidence that a small number of party members may have
 gone to the USSR specifically to receive training, to last,
 in some cases, for as long as five years.  Yet several
 parties had no knowledge of any CPSU program at that
 time.  Generally speaking, the CPSU training program in the
 early 1950's appeared to have little planning behind the
 selection of the foreign Communists involved, or in the
 scope and nature of the training.
 Program from 1953 to 1956
 4.   During the period from 1953 to 1956 the training
 program expanded further and the CPSU is known to
 have established at least three separate training institutions
 which were attended by Communists from Free World
 CP's.  These institutions appear to have been experimental,
 however, and preliminary to the subsequent emergence of
 the CPSU's Higher Party School* as the focal point of
 foreign Communist training.  During this period, foreign
 Communists attended not only the three separate institutions
 which are known, but also the Higher Party School.  In 1953,
 *See Section D. , paragraph 23 et seq.

 Only in the case of one Party is thew firm evidence that a
 program of some consequence was under way during this period.  In 1953
 a Latin American CP sent students to the first of three courses in the
 USSR which were held exclusively for Communists from this party.  Occurring
 during the period from June 1953 until Sine 1957, these three courses
 were of six months, fifteen months and two years duration.  It is
 estimated that approximately one hundred members of this CP may have
 been involved in this prog am.  The school for this one CP was entirely
 apart from any other OPSU training establishment, although it was
 administered by the Higher Party School.  While it is possible that
 separate establishments existed for other nationality groups, no evidence
 has ever been discovered which would indicate a similar program of such
 remarkable scope for any other Free World party during that period .  Insofar
 as can be determined, Communists from this CP have not attended a special
 separate CPSU establishment since the end of their third course in the
 spring of 1957.
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001100170011-9
 construction of new buildings for the Higher Party School
 was undertaken.  Although many more foreign CP's
 participated in the CPSU's training program during this
 period, their participation still appeared to be haphazard
 and limited, with little evidence that a planned program had
 yet emerged.
 (. 5.   Only in the case of one Party is there firm
 evidence that a program of some consequence was under
 way during this period.  In 1953 the Brazilian CP sent
 students to the first of three courses in the USSR which
 were held exclusively for Brazilian Communists.  Occurring
 during the period from June 1953 until June 1957, these
 three courses were of six months, fifteen months and
 two years duration.  It is estimated that approximately
 one hundred Brazilian Communists may have been involved
 in this program.  The school for Brazilian Communists was
 entirely apart from any other CPSU training establishment,
 although it was administered by the Higher Party School.
 While it is possible that separate establishments existed
 for other nationality groups, no evidence has ever been
 discovered which would indicate a similar program of such
 remarkable scope for any other Free World party during
 that period.  Insofar as can be determined, Brazilian Com-
 munistsAhave not attended a special separate CPSU estab-
 lishment since the end of their third course in the spring
 of 1957.
 6.   In 1953 the CPSU also organized -- under the
 auspices of the WFTU -- the WFTU Central School for
 Trade Union Cadres located in Budapest.  During its
 existence from mid-1953 until mid-1955   this school
 offered six courses, each of about three months duration.
 During this period the school was attended by a total of
 157 students, with a regional breakdown showing 84 from
 Latin America, 43 from the Middle East, ZZ from Africa
 and 8 from Southeast Asia.  While some of the students
 were not Communists, the great majority were Party
 members drawn from Communist labor activities.  The
 first four courses were characterized by a marked theoret-
 ical emphasis -- attributed to the Soviets -- which proved
 beyond the capacity of most students.  The last two courses
 were then changed to reflect more practical instruction
 in trade union problems.  It is quite possible that this ex-
 perience may have contributed to a CPSU decision to con-
 centrate party instruction for foreign Communists at the
 CPSU's own Higher Party School, or at least in the USSR.
 7.   In 1955 yet another CPSU training establishment
 was in existence which enrolled foreign Communists as
 well as Soviet students.  Located near Moscow, this school
 may have opened for the first time in 1955 on an experi-
 mental basis.  This is suggested by the evidence that in
 1955 the physical facilities of the school were very poor,
 the language problems inadequately solved, and Soviet
 efforts to establish military discipline (i. e. reveilles, parades,
 marching to classes, etc.) had to be given up in the face
 of student opposition.  The course began in September 1955
 and ended in the spring of 1956.  The student body numbered
 about one hundred, and in addition to Soviet students
 included foreign Communists "from many different countries."

 A Scandinavian CP is the only Free World party identified as having
 students at this school in 1955-1956.
 is not known whether the school continued to operate after
 that course, but available evidence suggests that by the
 fall of 1956 the majority of trainees from Free World parties
 began to be enrolled in the Higher Party School on a more
 or less regular basis.
 9.   During the period from 1953 to 1956, there was
 evidently a gradual increase in the number of trainees
 from Free World parties who attended the Higher Party
 School of the CPSU, either for full courses or for special
 lectures lasting but a few months.  A source who attended
 some lectures at the Higher Party School for a few months
 in mid-1955 identified numerous foreign Communists
 at these lectures.  He estimated that one thousand foreign
 students were then attending the Higher Party School, but
 that most of these came from Bloc parties.  However, he
 also identified students from the CP's of Bolivia, Cuba,
 El Salvador, Finland, Guatemala, Italy, Paraguay,
 Spain., Sweden, Syria, and Venezuela.  Although the source
 thought that the students from the Free World parties were
 enrolled in a two-year course at the Higher Party School,
 this cannot be confirmed.  It is probable that some were
 enrolled in a long-term course (of one, two or three years),
 but some may only have been attending special lectures
 covering a few months.
 9.   In the case of several CP's, there is evidence
 during this period that members may have attended lectures
 at the Higher Party School for only a few months.  In addition,
 a few of the graduates of the WFTU school went to Moscow
 from Budapest and received additional short-term training,
 possibly at the Higher Party School.  In 1955 one WFTU
 graduate was reliably reported to have gone to Moscow
 where he spent "forty-two days taking examinations in
 what he had learned." Since this is an excessive time to
 take examinations in a course which lasted but a few months,
 it is probable that he attended a CPSU school.  Another
 WFTU graduate was reported to have gone on to Moscow
 where he took a course lasting three months.
 Program from 1956 to date
 10.       In 1956 the expanding CPSU training program
 appears to have entered a new stage, with the entire program
 showing a planning and organization not evident before.
 The current program may be said to stem from 1956.
 Since then, an increasing number of foreign CP's have sent
 trainees to the USSR, often sending a new group to replace
 other Party members who have completed a course.  Reports
 of training given to Free World Communists have increasingly
 pinpointed the Higher Party School as the training estab-
 lishment involved.  In this connection a CC/CPSU decree
 of 26 June 1956 may be cited:
 "To establish in the Higher Party School attached
 to the Central Committee CPSU a special faculty for
 the training of (Party) workers assigned for instruction
 by communist and workers' parties of foreign countries.
 To retain for the special faculty the current curriculum,
 based on a three-year course of training, giving the
 rectorate of the school the right in case of need to
 introduce partial changes related to the composition
 of the students and in accordance with the wishes
 of the Communist parties of individual countries."

 The same decree shortened to two years the length of the
 course for Soviet students.
 11.  From 1956 to date, it is known that selected.
 foreign CP's usually have been invited well in advance to
 send trainees to the USSR.  The CPSU generally assigns
 student quotas (or slots) to the CP's invited to participate.
 While some CP's send trainees regularly to the Higher Party
 School, participation by others appears irregular, with
 these CP's -- either by choice or because no CPSU invitation
 is forthcoming -- sending trainees only every few years.
 The continuing expansion of the training program is
 underscored by the fact that in each year since 1956, a
 new CP has been identified as sending Party members
 for the first time to receive CPSU training.  Yet it is
 known that some CP's have not yet been invited to participate.
 In the case of at least one CP, the CPSU invitation was.
 declined because it was felt that the training offered was
 not suited to the problems of the CP concerned.
 12.   There is considerable variation in the length
 of time a foreign Communist may receive CPSU training.
 At the Higher Party School, a one year course appears
 very common for the Free World trainees, but training
 for two years is also frequent, and some trainees may stay
 for three and even four years at this school.  Some short-
 term training of a few months duration also continues to
 be given.
 13.   Once a foreign CP has accepted a CPSU invitation
 to send trainees to the USSR, the Party's selections are
 cleared with the CPSU whenever possible.  When feasible,
 a Soviet diplomatic establishment will communicate names
 and biographic data on the trainees to Moscow.  Often these
 diplomatic establishments will assist in making travel
 Sanitized -Approved For Release : IA-RDn         1nn17nn11-a
 arrangements, obtaining necessary documentation, and
 financing the travel of the foreign Party trainees,  It is
 suspected that the CPSU finances all travel of foreign
 trainees to and from the USSR.  It is also known that
 trainees receive allowances while at the school, and in
 some cases, it is known that the families of trainees receive
 monthly payments on which to live while the trainee is
 away.
 14.   The CPSU program of training Free World
 Communists is administered by the Foreign Section (or
 International Department) of the central Party apparatus.
 Personnel of this section negotiate with the foreign CP's
 concerning participation in the program, allocate numbers
 of training slots, advise concerning the caliber of trainees,
 and generally administer the enrollment of the foreign
 trainees in CPSU establishments.  Special arrangements
 for the foreign trainees, including guides and advisors, are
 handled by the Foreign Section.  Correspondence with the
 foreign CP concerning the progress of the trainees is another
 function of the Foreign Section. On some occasions,
 foreign area specialists from the Foreign Section give
 special lectures and hold seminars for groups of trainees
 from given foreign areas.
 15.   In 1957 the Higher Party School was expanding
 its facilities.  Additional buildings were being acquired,
 several blocks away from the main school complex.  At
 least one new building was completed for the school's
 use.  Improvements were being made in dormitories,
 mess facilities, etc.  In 1958 an official of the CPSU's
 Foreign Section told a visiting foreign Communist in Moscow
 that the CPSU was planning a further expansion in its
 program of training foreign Communists.  He stated that the

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01100170011-9
 CPSU had thus far only offered courses at its cadre school
 to very select foreign Communist leaders.  It now planned
 a new school which would be for Party leaders from all
 areas in the world.
 16.   At the present time, it is estimated roughly that
 300 Free World CP trainees per year are enrolled in regular
 courses at the CPSU's Higher Party School.  Estimating
 an average cost (including travel) of $2, 000, this Soviet
 training program for Free World Communists would represent
 an estimated outlay of $600, 000 per annum.
 B.  Participants in the Current CPSU Program
 1.   In most Free World countries it is very difficult
 to obtain reliable information concerning a CP's partici-
 pation in the CPSU's training program.  Even in some
 cases where there is firm evidence that a CP is sending
 trainees to the USSR, it has not been possible to determine
 the number of trainees being sent.  In most CP's this is
 a carefully guarded secret.  Often knowledge is limited to
 the national leadership.  In some CP's where there is a
 more general awareness of the program among Party
 members the Party has directed that this matter must be
 treated with "maximum discretion."  In the case of illegal
 CP's, travel by Party members to the USSR must be
 clandestine.  Even members of legal CP's may travel to
 the USSR without proper documentation, or take steps to
 hide their long stay in the Soviet Union.  At the Higher Party
 School itself, nationality groups are generally kept separate
 and students use cover names -- factors which further complicate
 the identification of trainees in the current program.
 2.  A student at the Higher Party School during 1957-1958
 has estimated that there were about 1500 students enrolled
 at that time.  Of these, about 700 were Soviet.  The remaining

 800 foreign students included Free World as well
 as Bloc trainees with the specific exception of the
 Chinese.  (If CPSU training of Chinese Communists is
 taking place at all, it is probably given in a separate estab-
 lishment.) While this source was able to identify several
 specific national groups at the Higher Party School, in
 other cases he could only state his general impression.  For
 example, he stated that Asiatics were strongly represented
 but he was unable to identify the countries they were from.

 European CP's
 3.   Since 1956 there has been reliable evidence that at
 least eleven European CPts (all free World parties). have been, or
 are currently, involved in the CPSU training program.  In the
 following cases, the number of trainees sent each year has averaged
 from about five to twenty.
 CP# 1 sent trainees to the Higher Party School in
 1955, 1956, 1957 and 1958.  No information is yet available
 concerning participation in the 1959-1960 course.
 CP # 2 sent trainees to the Higher Party School in
 1957 and again in 1958, both times for one year courses.
 In 1959, another group of trainees was sent to the USSR,
 reportedly to attend a four-month course.  No information
 is yet available concerning participation in the 1959-1960
 course at the Higher Party School.
 C? # 3 is not known to have sent any trainees to the
 USSR prior to 1959.  In 1959, a group was sent to the USSR
 on a study trip of a 4ew months duration.  One report has
 claimed that the group would attend a party course, but it
 is hot known whether an actual course is involved.  No
 participation has yet been noted in longer, regular courses.
 OP # 4 sent trainees to the USSR in 1956 (probably
 to the Higher Party School) and is known to have had trainees
 in the 1957-1958 course at the Higher Party School.   No

 CF # 5 probably sends trainees to the Higher Party
 School each year, but firm evidence is available only
 on the 1957-1958 course.
 CP # 6 sent trainees in 1956 and again in 1957 to
 the Higher Party School.  It probably sends a group each
 year.
 CF # 7 is known to send trainees to the Higher Party
 School, probably on a regular basis, but the 1957-1958 tsurse
 is the only one known to have been attended by trainees from
 this CP.  There is, however, reliable evidence that this
 CP sends some trainees for longer periods of time than
 one year.
 CP # 8 apparently sent no trainees to the USSR prior
 to 1959.  However, this CP is known to have scheduled a group
 for the 1959-1960 course at the Higher Party School.
 CP # 9 sent trainees to a one-year course in the USSR
 in 1958 (probably at the Higher Party School).  This was
 apparently this CP's first participation in the CPSU program.
 In 1959, a group of trainees was again sent to the USSR, re-
 portedly for a three-month course.  No information is yet
 available about participation in the 1959-1960 course at
 the Higher Party School.
 CP # 10 sent trainees to the 1957-1958 course at the
 Higher Party School.  It probably sends a group each year.
 CP # 11 sent trainees to the 1957-1958 course at
 the Higher Party School.  No further information is
 available.

 4.  Information on the participation of Latin American CP %
 in the CPSU training program has been more difficult to obtain than in
 the case of the European CP's.  In patt, this is due to the fact that
 several Latin American CP's are illegal and must operate clandestinely.
 In addition, trainees for OPSU schooling have sometimes been drawn from
 Party members living in exile in other countries.  Available information
 indicates, however, that some Latin American CP's have not yet participated
 in the OPSU program, and those which have sent trainees have -- with the
 exception of the special case mentioned on page~5,Paragraph 5 -- generally
 sent fewer v*bSrt Qf tr?i4ep  than  have the European OP's.  Within the
 last year the CPSU has increased the number of "slots" available to
 CP's at least in Central America, and it is possible that participation
 of Latin American OP's in the CPSU program is increasing generally.
 (See also the section on the expanding COP training program for Latin
 American Communists.)
 5.  In the case of six Latin American OP's there is reliable
 evidence of participation in the CPSU's current program.
 OP /1 1 sent trainees to the special CPSU establishment
 mentioned previously and which was organized for its exclusive
 use during 1953-1957.  There has been no evidence that trainees
 have been sent to the USSR since that time.  In early 1959,
 however, this OP was reliably reported to be considering sending
 another group to the USSR.
 OP # 2 sent trainees to the USSR for the first time in
 1959.  The trainees were scheduled for a two-year course] probably
 Lt the Higher Party School).

 OP # 3 has evidently sent trainees to the USSR for several
 years?  This practice has apparently been prompted in part by
 the Party's known desire to have always some Party leaders in
 reseave outside the countrt.  Trainees are  known to have been
 in the USSR in 1958.
 CP # 4 sent trainees to the USSR for the first time in 1956.
 The trainees attended the Higher Party School and were scheduled
 for a one-year course.  In 1957 another trainee was sent for a
 three-year stay.  In 1958 at least two additional trainees were
 scheduled for the Higher Party School; one of these was to stay
 for three years.
 CP # 5 was reliably reported to have received training slots
 from the CPSU in 1958`and again in 1959.
 CP # 6 sent a trainee in 1958 to a two-year course at the
 Higher Party School.  This was the first training slot made available
 to this CP.  In 1959 another trainee was scheduled to go to a two-
 year course at the Higher Party School.
 6.  In the case of two other Latin American CP %, the most tecent
 evidence relates to 1956 and 1957; there is no information on their
 participation in the CPSU program since those dates.  Some short-term
 three
 training has been indicated in the case of %w other Latin American CPts.

 Other CP's
 1   2/4:  In only a few other cases is there definite knowledge
 of the CP's which are participating in the CPSU's
 current program.  The "Asiatics" identified in the 1957-195 8
 course at the Higher Party School might have come from
 the Far East, Southeast Asia, or some areas of the
 Middle East.  There is no reliable evidence concerning
 CPSU training of African Communists, though numerous
 reports -- many of which are obvious fabrications -- allege
 that such training takes place.  (Many reports allege also
 that Africans are receiving Party training in Prague, but
 there has been no reliable information received on this
 subject.)

 European CP's
 2.  The selection process thich is known to be followed in one
 CP for attendance at the one-year course at the Higher Party Schools
 probably reflects the general procedure followed in many European CP's.
 (a) A'District Secretariat of the Party may propose the candidacy of a
 Party member; (b) this proposal is passed to a Regional Secretariat of the
 Party; (c) if the Regional Secretariat passes favorably on the candidacy,
 it forwards its approval to the Party's Central Committee; (d) if the
 Central Committee approves, it then undertakes "consultation with Moscow."
 Moscow subsequently advises the Party whether it "accepts" the proposed
 trainee.  (This communication with Moscow is evidently handled by the
 Soviet Embassy in this country.)  (e) The accepted candidate, along with
 others from his Party region, is then called before a panel of his
 egional Secretariat.  Here, he is informed officially that his selection
 as been approved and learns of his obligations to the Party in return.
 In at least some cases, trainees from this CP have had to agree to full-
 ime employment with the Party following their return from Moscow.
 3.  In the case of this CP, it is not clear whether each regional
 rkanization of the Party has a quota, but it is possible that this is so.
 n most of the European CF's mentioned in Section B., the known trainees
 ame from various parts of the country.  In the case of two CP's, the
 party headquarters sent circulars to regional Party organizations asking
 em to propose candidates.  On the other hand, in another Party the centr
 eadership is believed to have chosen the trainees with little or no
 consultation with regional organizations.  The leadership reportedly sougi
 placate Party criticism with assurances that selections would be made
 om various parts of the country.

 C.   Selection and Caliber of Trainees for CPSU Establishment
 1.   Methods of selecting trainees for participation
 in the CPSU's current training program can vary in
 different CP's.  Some variations are evidently due. to
 the difference in the number of the trainees which can
 be sent, whether a CP sends trainees each year, and the
 conditions under which a CP must operate.  The geographic
 distance from the USSR may also play a part.
 2.   The selection process followed in the&ustrian
 CPJor attendance at the one-year course at the Higher
 Party School, probably reflects the general procedure
 4.  The circular sent out by one of the Western European OP's
 provided details concerning the type of Party members who should be
 proposed as trainees to attend the CPSU's Higher Party School.  In
 this particular case one important requirement was that all trainees
 must be able to be away from their country for four years.  Other
 requirements for selection were:

 5.   It is evident, however, that similar require-
 ments are not necessarily followed by other European
 CP's in selecting trainees.  The trainees from other
 European parties may be older, often in the mid-to-late 30's
 and sometimes in the early 40's (though these are more
 rare). Trainees need not be unmarried, and sometimes
 husbands and wives have received CPSU training together
 at the Higher Party School.  It is true, however, that
 family difficulties and employment problems may affect
 the selection of a trainee.  Not all of,the i,nown European
 trainees have held positions on the                           25X1X6
 While some have come from regional and/or provincial
 levels as well as from the central party apparatus, they
 may also be district and city officials (very often district
 secretaries), district and city functionaries in youth and
 labor work, party journalists, etc.  It is clear that emphasis
 is generally on loyal and active party functionaries who
 may be expected to rise in the party, improve the effective-
 ness of their respective party units, and constitute an elite
 cadre which the party leadership can count on, both
 currently and to assume the leadership in the future.

 The regional Party organizations were also told in this circular
 that for any suggested candidate, they must teturn a full biography
 and political statement compiled by the Secretariat.  It is likely
 that these are forwarded eventually to Moscow.  (It should be noted
 that this CF also selects members to attend the University of Moscow
 and has requirements concerning their selection.  The mater Party
 difference in these requirements is that for the Higher Party School,
 the trainees should hold regional-level positions in the Party or in
 a mass organization;  for the University of Moscow, the? need b$ only
 Party members or members of the Party's youth organization.)

 6.   In the case of Latin American CP's (and possibly
 many other non-European Free World parties), the
 allocation of Soviet training slots and the selection of
 trainees appears to take place on a more ad hoc basis
 than is the case in the European CP's.  It is possible that
 better programming is now under way, but participation
 by the Latin American CP' s in the CPSU training program
 must continue to be influenced by the fact that many of
 these CP's are in an illegal or circumscribed status and

 (in pars, 6, opening pars. is OK down to line 11, the last sentence
 which should be changed to read:)
 .....The following example of the CP of country X may
 illustrate many of the problems and procedures necessary in
 the case of several other Latin American parties.
 In November 1957, while a representative of OP X was
 in Moscow, the CPSU invited the CP to send one trainee
 to the Higher Party School.  The CPSU asked for a
 "bell leader" and agreed to pay all expenses, including
 transportation.  It was agreed that the travel and
 training would be clandestine, with knowledge limited
 to the leadership of CP X.
 OP X established a communication channel to the CPSU
 via certain members of CP Y resident in country Z sW '
 who were contact men for the Soviet Embassy in country
 Z.
 Secretary General and the National Organizer of CP X
 select a member to receive the training.i$ecretary
 General subsequently obtained the approval of CP X's
 top leadership.
 Q-I'tepresentative of CP X visits country Z.  Through a
 CP Y intermediary, he is put in touch with a Soviet
 Embassy official, and he gives the official data on
 the selected trainee to forward to Moscow.
 The trainee begins to create his cover story to
 explain his absence to family and friends.  His
 cover story is that he is going to Country Z to obtain
 a better job.  He will correspond with his wife through
 a country Z channel.  His letters must show a country
 Z postmark and return address.  Since his passport will
 expire before his return, he will turn this matter over
 to the Soviets so that they can prepare a false passport
 for him to use on his return trip.  He will discuss
 with the Soviets how much of his pay at the school should
 be allotted to and sent. his wife via country Z.
 CP X receives a telegram from country Z state that the
 trainee should leave for country Z.
 Trainee leaves for count   Z.  He carries credentials 6a&1

 7.   Evidence suggests that many of the Latin
 American trainees scheduled for GPSU training are hand-
 picked by a very few top party officials, although these
 leaders may obtain the approval of their CP's top
 body.  In the current CPSU program, the Latin American
 trainees have, in general, appeared to come from a
 higher party level than have the known trainees of
 the European CP's.  Full Central Committee members
 are often selected and on a few occasions even Secre-
 tary Generals.  This is no doubt due largely to the
 fact that fewer training slots are available.  Another
 factor may be the generally lower level of local party
 schools in the Latin American area.  The party schools
 of the European CP's are generally much more elaborate
 and of a higher caliber than those which the Latin
 American CP's have been able to establish.     Often,
 European CP's have picked trainees for the USSR schools
 only after these individuals have completed their own
 party training courses.  Whereas the European CP's
 appear to be concentrating on the selection of future
 party leaders for CPSU training, the Latin American
 CP's have appeared to concentrate more on the trai ping
 of current leaders.
 8.   Since the identification of specific trainees from
 other geographic areas has been very difficult to establish,
 only a tentative and general conclusion can be made con-
 cerning the caliber of trainees being selected.  It appears
 that both high-level as well as young party members are
 involved1  Possibly this is determined essentially by the
 number of training slots available, and this number, in
 turn, may be determined by the CPSU's priority interest
 in a given party.

 D.  CPSU Schools and Courses
 1.  As indicated in Section A, there is knowledge
 concerning at least three different Party schools in
 the USSR which have enrolled Free World Communists*
 since 1953.  In addition, a WFTU training school was
 located in Budapest.  Of these schools, only the Higher
 Party School, is today known to be receiving Free Worl r
 trainees. f:It is possible, however, that a very few
 may cater to trainees from   25X1X6
 short-term training which has been indicated in the case
 of certain foreign trainees has dealt with specialized
 subjects, such as trade union tactics; this training may
 be patterned after the old WFTU courses.  The CPSU
 school which in 1955 appeared to be opening for the first
 time had in its curricula certain subjects which are
 not known to be taught currently in the regular courses
 at the Higher Party School.  As will be discussed,
 however, certain special lectures at the Higher Party
 School may today cover some of these particular subjects.
 No school similar to this 1955 school is known today.
 2.  Although there is reliable evidence that the CPSU
 plans a further expansion of its training program, and
 a CPSU spokesman has mentioned a new school for

 Party leaders from all areas of the world, it is probable
 that in the foreseeable future CPSU training of Free
 World Communists will continue to be based on the
 programs which have been identified in the last few
 Separate School for Bra$ fans (1953-1957)
 3.   This school was located about fifty-six kilometers
 north of Moscow near a suburb known as Pushkino.  The
 school was set up on a pre-Revolutionary estate of the
 Governor of Moscow and in 1953 was known overtly
 as a rest home of the Ministry of Health.  It appears
 likely that this school is the same as the "rest home" at
 Pushkin which various sources during the 19401s reported
 to be a disguised training school for foreign Communists.
 During the war years at Pushkin, foreign Communists
 were instructed in underground work, partisan warfare,
 sabotage and intelligence -- in addition to receiving political

 5.   The Pushkin school was administered by the
 Higher Party School and, like it, was under the direction
 of the CPSU's Central Committee.  The regular teaching
 staff was made up entirely of professors from the Higher
 Party School.  According to a reliable source, the courses
 studied                       Pushkino duplicated courses
 being given to othe  foreign trainees who were enrolled           25X1X6
 25X1X6
 6.      The second course for the              ommunists
 included a total of 1800 hours of study The various subjects
 were:
 Political Indoctrination (42 hours)
 (an introductory course which covered
 in an elementary fashion the tenets of
 Marxism)
 Russian History (120 hours)
 (both pre-Revolutionary and Soviet)
 Economic Geography (120 hours)
 History of the CPSU (200 hours)
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIAERDP78-00915R001100170011-9
 International Relations (120 hours)
 (particularly relations of the Soviet
 Union with other nations)
 Political Economics (200 hours)
 (Marxist economic theory and economic
 history)
 (the derivation and development of
 dialectic materialism and its transition
 into Marx- Engels -Lenin-Stalin eonomic
 philosophy)
 The remaining hours of study were devoted to the Russian
 25X1X6         language and occasional guest lectures.  A major emphasis
 at Pushkino was the study of Russian; it took place from the
 beginning of the course until the end.   las       25X1X6
 7.   There were notable differences between the second
 and third courses.  Some of the changes were evidently
 the result of Soviet efforts to improve the course (efforts
 which may have been prompted in part by criticisms
 voiced by some of the students).  Other changes occurred
 immediately after Khrushchev's anti-Stalin speech in
 February 1956.  Since much of the course had been based
 on the writings of Stalin, the de-Stalinization campaign
 resulted in numerous changes in the school courses and
 texts.   Changes in the third course included:
 Philosophy: much more emphasis was
 given to the history of philosophy, from ancient
 Greece to Russian social democratic theories.
 All Stalinist interpretations were dropped.
 Dialectic study was more thorough.
 History of the CPSU:  since the second
 course had drawn completely from the official
 Stalinist text, this course was completely
 revised.  Lenin's version, covering the period
 until 1924, was used.  For the period after
 1924, hastily drawn up revisions of parts of
 the Stalinist manual were utilized.
 Political Economics:  since the second course
 had been based on a manual published under
 Stalin and filled with references to Stalinist
 economic doctrine, a revised version was
 necessary.  In this, Stalin's name and his
 writings were not mentioned.  In the third
 course, this subject was much more emphasized
 and expanded to include Das Kapital, not studied
 in the second course.
 Political Indoctrination: this was elim-
 inated entirely in the third course.

 NNL
 History of the Labor Movement: this was
 much more emphasized and better organized
 than in the second course.
 Structure of the CPSU: this was virtually
 eliminated and replaced by a series of lectures
 on the actual experiences of old-time Bolshevik
 revolutionaries.  This was designed to acquaint
 the students with actual Communist practice
 in Russia prior to the Revolution.
 In addition, there was even greater emphasis on the study
 of the Russian language.   The courses in Economic
 Geography, Russian History and International Relations
 werermre or less the same.
 8.   To illustrate something of the subjects covered
 in the above courses, some of the subjects studied in
 the History of the Labor Movement may be cited.  The
 following is a partial listing only.
 The Industrial Worker Movement (in several
 different countries and at different times.

 each of the two courses taught there.  About twenty-seven
 professors from the Higher Party School constituted
 the teaching staff.  About four interpreters were assigned
 to translate the lectures.  The administrative director
 of the course, SINVALOBOV, who visited the school
 periodically and did not participate personally in the running
 of the school, was identified as a staff member of the
 CPSU central party apparatus who was responsible for

 countries.  A few other staff members of the central party

 Para 10.  The student governing body at Pushkino was a "burg" made
 up of about five higher-ranking students.  The "burn" was responsible
 for discipline, reviewing the progress of the students, and criticizing
 each student's achievements.  Security measures at the school were
 adequate but not strict; many of the trainees were already well
 versed in security practices.  The students made some trips to Moscow
 on Sundays, but generally were not allowed much freedom.  The confinement
 and condescending attitude of the Soviets occasioned periodic flares of
 resentment among the students. All students used an alias while in
 the USSR, by which they were known at the school, and Soviet identity
 documents were in the alias.  All students received 300 rubles per month.
 Periodically, ranking members of this Latin American OP visiting in the
 Soviet Union would visit the school and brief the students on happenings
 at home in their country and in the OP.  These
 visitors would also carry messages back on behalf of the students.

 Separate School for One Latin American CP (1953-3.957)
 para 4.  Party training of Communists from this OP began at Pushkino
 about October 1953.  The first course for these Communists (about
 thirteen in number) had begun in June 1953 in the vicinity of Moscow
 (possibly at the Higher Party School).  Only the second and third
 courses were held at Pushkino.  Over forty-two trainees attended the
 second course from October 1953 until December 1954.  About fifty-one
 students were enrolled in the third course which was held from June
 1955 until June 1957.  During this entire period, the Pushkino school
 was used exclusively for the training of Communists from this one
 CP.  The CPSU program of training members of this CP on# such a large
 scale was reportedly undertaken for the following reasons:  (a) some
 years before, the CP had failed in an effort to harass the government,
 thereby demonstrating a need for more and better trained cadres; (b) yet,
 more recently, economic unrest and strikes in the country had suggested
 the time was ripe for another OP effort; and (c) the CP overstated its
 capacities and the "refolutionary" situation in the country to the CPSU.
 These factors contributed to a Soviet miscalculation concerning the
 future of this OP and led to the unusual and large training program
 instigated in 1953.

 WFTU Training School (1953-1955)
 11,  For purposes of this paper, discussion of the
 WFTU training school in Budapest will be limited largely
 to the actual courses which were taught there.  As
 mentioned in Section A, the courses became more practical
 during the last two of the six courses given.  It should
 also be remembered that each of the WFTU courses was
 only about three months in duration.
 12. Before the courses were modified, lectures
 at the WFTU school included at least the following subjects.
 There is a similarity to some of the courses taught at
 Pushkino.
 Labor Unions and the State
 (origin, functions and forms of the State, etc.)
 several lectures on Political Economy
 (formation of capital, historic role of
 capitalism, etc.)
 Historical and Dialectical Materialism
 Marxist Philosophical Materialism
 Rise of the Labor Unions in Russia
 Methods of Struggle for Strikes
 (general rules, political and economic
 strikes)
 Workers' Movement and National and Colonial
 Problem
 Structure of Union Organization and Preparation
 of Union Cadres
 Congresses of the WFTU
 Histories of Significant Labor Movements
 Imperialism
 (characteristics, place in history, etc.)
 13.  After the courses were modified to provide more
 practical instruction, the following topics were taught.
 Problems of Practical Trade Union Work
 Trade Union Structure and Democracy
 The Work of the Masses in their Places of Work
 The Workers' Demands
 Sanitized -Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001'100170011-9
 Forms of Struggle and Particularly of Unity
 International Trade Union Work
 Political Economy and Trade Union History
 14. It is evident that most of the philosophical and
 political courses were eliminated, and are today taught
 at the Higher Party School.  Because there is no known
 central WFTU training school in practical trade union
 subjects, some Soviet training of foreign Communists
 in this field may occur periodically under the auspices
 of the USSR's All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.
 This could account for some of the short-term training
 indicated in the case of certain foreign Communists in
 the USSR.
 Possible Experimental School (1955? - 1956?)
 15.  In 1955 a Soviet training establishment was
 located "not very far" from Moscow in an area of
 villages.  Students were transported by automobile
 from Moscow.  For the 1955-1956 course (the only one
 about which any information is available), the total
 number of students was one hundred, including Soviet
 students.  While the foreign students were reported to
 come "from many different countries", it is obvious that
 they must have been a small group in view of the total
 student body.  Since many of the foreign students knew
 German, and because the course in the history of the
 working class movement reportedly stressed Western
 Europe and Scandinavia, it seems likely that the majority if not all -- of the foreign students may have been Western

 European.           Communists are the only nationality
 group which has been identified.
 16.  A peculiar characteristic of this school was
 the involvement of the Soviet military.  This fact, as
 well as the courses taught, suggests that the school was
 a joint effort of the Party and the armed forces, possibly
 involving also personnel from the intelligence services.
 Military instructors and teachers were detailed to the
 school and lived in a separate establishment from the
 civilian teachers.  Sometimes the military personnel
 appeared in uniform (ranks reported were from captain
 up to colonel) but more often they wore civilian clothes.
 Substitutions in both the military and civilian faculty
 occurred during the school year.

 Communists from one Scandinavian country are the only
 nationality group which has been identified.
 pars 17.  Another peculiarity of this school was the apparent Soviet
 effort to bring together Soviet foreign area specialists and Communists
 from the pertinent foreign areas.  It is !mown, for example, that in the
 dormitory group of a Scandinavian Bommunist there were three young
 Soviet students who were specialists on                         the country
 of that foreign trainee.  They had studied the language and "conditions"
 of his country, reportedly at the University of Moscow.  These Soviet
 students were very interested in "improving" their knowledge of that
 country through conversations with the foreign trainee.  It is amusing
 to note that the foreign trainee found the Soviet students unable to
 believe anything he stated about actual conditions in his country, and
 their opinions on life and politics in his country were completely out
 of touch with reality.

 school.    Subjects 1-3 and 9 were taught by civilian
 teachers. Subjects 10 and 11 were taught by military
 instructors, and subjects 4-8 were taught alternately
 by civilian and military teachers.
 (1) Russian language
 (2) History of Russia and the Soviet Union
 (3) Basic Marxism-Leninism
 (4) History of the CPSU

 eventually put their special training to some good use.
 There is some evidence that while the students were
 at the school discussions were going on between the CPSU
 and the foreign CP's involved concerning the future
 employment of the students.  Possibly the majority of the
 foreign students were fairly low-level CP members.
 20.   Other evidence about this school suggests that
 it may have been launched in an abrupt fashion and probably
 for the first time in 1955.  As mentioned in Section A,
 initial Soviet efforts to establish a purely military discipline
 had to be given up in the face of almost unanimous
 opposition by the foreign students.  Because many of the
 foreign students had little knowledge of the Russian language,
 German textbooks were finally used in some of the courses
 since some teachers also knew German.  The physical
 facilities of the school were described from "very bad"
 to "beneath all criticism." Poor food, a broken heating
 system, totally inadequate sanitary facilities, etc. , put
 many students in the hospital.  The leadership of the
 school was worried about the frequent cases of illness but
 ascribed them to the "softness" of the foreigners.
 21.   No instructors at this school have been identified.
 The school area was regarded as "restricted" by the local
 population of neighboring villages.  Students, in turn, were for-
 bidden to fraternize with the local people.  They did go
 on hikes and other excursions, and went to Moscow several
 times on sight-seeing trips.  Sometimes artists from Moscow
 gave performances at the school.
 22.   Reports were made regularly on the students'
 progress, general attitude and behavior.  According to one
 report, the Foreign Section (or International Department)
 of the CPSU sent these progress reports, in summary
 form, to the Central Committee of the CP's concerned.
 The Higher Party School (Vysshayaarartiynaya shkola)
 23.  The main address of the CC/CPSU's Higher Party
 School Is No. 6 Miusskaya Square, Moscow D-47.  The
 school was founded in 1939, although it actually stems
 from previous CPSU institutions, particularly the Communist
 University irneni Sverdlov and the Higher Propaganda
 School.  In 1946 a CC CPSU resolution provided for the
 reorganization of the entire network of CPSU teaching
 establishments, and the Higher Party School was attached
 directly to the CC/CPSU.  Presumably the school falls
 under the CC otdel (section or department) for Science,
 Higher Educational Institutions and Schools -- but the
 section for Agitation and Propaganda must be involved
 to a considerable extent in the school program.  The Foreign
 Section of the CC/CPSU is concerned with the allocation
 of slots, and the selection and training of Free World
 Communists at the Higher Party School.
 24.  As far as the training of CPSU members at the
 Higher Party School is concerned, in 1958 a CPSU publication
 stated:
 "The basic task of the Higher Party School
 is the Marxist training of leading cadres of the
 republic and oblast link from among Party
 members who have had a higher, mainly technical,
 education and sufficient experience in Party
 work.  The need for the organization of this
 profile of the work of the Higher Party School
 is caused by the fact that in recent years there
 have come into Party and Soviet work many
 Communists with higher specialized education
 but who do not have adequate knowledge in the
 field of Marxist-Leninist theory and economics....
 As far as the foreign Communist trainees at the Higher
 Party School are concerned, this school is the CPSU's
 special "cadre" school which "leading members" of other
 CP's may attend.
 25.  Courses given at the Higher Party School fall
 into two major categories: long-term training of one to
 four years, and short-term training covering possibly
 a period of a few months.  As mentioned in Part II, Section A,
 paragraph 10, a CPSU resolution in 1956 changed the regular
 course for Soviet students from three years to two years.
 The school year, for both Soviets and foreign trainees,
 begins in September.  Many foreign Communists stay only
 one year, although a two-year course is also frequent
 (particularly for Latin American trainees) and some foreign
 trainees may stay for as long as four years.  Both Soviet
 and foreign Communists may attend special lectures arranged
 by the Higher Party School, consisting either of a few
 special lectures or covering a three to four months period
 of study.
 26.   Information is available concerning the one-year
 course attended by Free World Communists at the Higher
 Party School in 1957-1958.  The regular curriculum included

 In addition, prominent guest lecturers might talk on a
 variety of subjects, particularly their experiences during
 the Revolution.

 28.   The foregoing will illustrate that the regular
 training given to foreign Communists at the Higher Party
 School is essentially theoretical and ideological.  Although
 this data relates to the one-year course, it is believed that
 foreign Communists who take two, three or even four years
 of training there continue to receive much the same sort
 of schooling.  With more time, however, the foreign Commu-
 nists undoubtedly receive more training in the Russian
 language and it is believed that certain courses, such as
 Party journalism, may be added.
 29.  Some information is available concerning the
 short-term training lectures given at the Higher Party
 School.   In 1955, some Free World Communists are known
 to have attended the Higher Party School only from April
 to July.  They were apparently in classes attended by other
 foreign trainees who were enrolled in regular, long-term
 courses.  But the short-term trainees in this case were
 taking individual study under the tutorship and direction of
 specific professors from the faculty of Political Economy.
 In 1957, it is known that some foreign Communists, not
 otherwise enrolled at the Higher Party School, attended
 two special lectures given there.  These lectures concerned
 "Guerrilla Operations under Conditions of Modern Warfare,"
 in OP "study groups" which have gone to the USSR.  While these study
 groups are undoubtedly exposed to various OPSU components for
 observation and briefing purposes, they may also attend special lectures
 organized for them at the Higher Party School.
 and were given by a Major General who had been in charge
 of guerrilla warfare operations in the Ukraine during
 World War II.  A source who attended these lectures has
 described the main points as follows:
 b.   differences between US and Soviet utilization
 of guerrillas;
 c.   guerrilla warfare is part of over-all military
 strategy;
 d.   main problems of guerrilla warfare:  effective
 command, training, communications, supplies
 and operational terrain;
 30.        Available evidence suggests that while the Higher
 Party School does provide lectures for foreign trainees
 on such specialized subjects as guerrilla warfare, such
 lectures are probably few in number and the bulk of the short-
 term training relates to the regular ideological and theoret-
 ical subjects.  Possibly -- though this is as yet only speculation --
 there may emerge a greater current use of short-term
 training for Free World Communists.  This isytrgested by

 to this position in 1946 and who was last identified in this

 32.   All the main buildings of the Higher Party School --
 six in number at the beginning of 1958 -- are located at
 the Miusskaya Square address.  There is at least one
 additional building belonging to the school on Leningradskoe
 Shosse, about fifteen minutes away; some two hundred
 students live there.                                he school
 is expanding further, with other. buildings being acquired
 in nearby locations.  At the Miusskaya Square address,
 one new building, twelve stories high, was completed in
 December 1957.  The school complex at Miusskaya Square
 contains living quarters, classrooms, and a large canteen
 where "very good and very inexpensive food" is available.
 The students, however, do not have to eat at the canteen.
 33.   The following data concerning the Higher Party
 School is based on reports made by a Free World Commu-
 nist who attended the 1957-1958 course:
 On the first day of arrival, foreign trainees
 attended an orientation meeting with the school
 director and his assistant.  Trainees from different
 Free World CP's attended in separate groups.
 The trainees were briefed on the use of school cover
 names and other school regulations.  All personal
 documents (including passports) were turned over
 to the school by the students; in return, each received
 an identity document which stated (in Russian) that
 the bearer, giving the true name but not the nation-
 ality, was a student at the Higher Party School.  This
 document also bore a photograph and was intended
 for use, if required, outside the school itself.
 At the first meeting, trainees were given some
 money and the regular financial arrangements were
 explained.  They, received money twice a month,
 on the 10th and 20th.  They received 1800 rubles
 a month*, from which they paid for their rooms,
 telephone, laundry, meals, etc.  Items owed the
 school administration were deducted from the payment
 due on the 2 0th.
 Students were told to bring any problems or
 difficulties to the attention of the school administra-
 tion or to the attention of the school's Party secretary.
 If something should happen at home, such as ill-
 ness in the family, the school administrator and
 Party secretary could make prompt arrangements for
 the student concerned to fly home.
 Security measures were quite strict.  Students
 could send and receive (at a Moscow post office box)
 as much mail as they wished, but all mail was cen-
 sored.  According to the Free World Communist
 source of this information, one always had the feeling
 of being watched.
 Individual nationality groups were generally
 kept isolated from each other, except for cases where
 more than one nationality group were taught together
 This sum has been confirmed by a source in another
 CP.  It is also known that trainees are not encouraged
 to save anything from their allowances.

 .   Some
 intermingling was also permitted during recreational
 sports and on field trips.  Students were, however,
 specifically warned against asking questions of
 fellow students, and they were also asked not to
 take photographs of each other.
 Hours of instruction were staggered to take
 care of the multiplicity of groups.  The courses for
 all groups, however, were believed to be the same.
 Classes for all groups lasted about five hours a day,
 with a break of ten minutes after each hour.  At the
 end of the formal classroom hours, students were
 free to do as they pleased.  They were warned, how-
 ever, that they should not forget the purpose for which
 they were there, and the examinations were very strict.
 As a consequence, afternoons and most evenings
 were devoted to study, especially by the Asiatics.
 Any student who performed unsatisfactorily was
 criticized fairly but severely before his entire group.
 Extra hours of instruction could be requested
 through the school dean, and every week the faculty
 was available for individual consultations with students
 on any problems they had.  A considerable amount
 of effort and care was devoted to the instruction,
 and the Party and school expended considerable effort
 to make things as pleasant as possible for the students.

 Since the CPSU's celebration of the 40th anniver-

 year 1957-1958, representatives from source's CP
 were in Moscow for the event.  They visited the Higher

 situation in the early 1950's.  COP training of one Far Eastern Free
 World OP was reportedly inaugurated in 1956.  COP seminars and
 conferences for visiting foreign Communists were first evidenced in
 1956.  Scheduled training of numbers of Latin Americans from several
 CP's was first arranged in 1957.
 2.      Although  only a limited amount of information is available
 concerning the current CCP program, it does appear to differ in
 several respects from that of the OPSU.  Separate training programs
 (somewhat on the order of the CPSU school at Pushkino) are indicated
 in several cases.   To date, it has not been possible to pin-point
 clearly one COP school where trainees from different foreign
 geographic areas* receive Party training together or even have
 contact with each other.  (etc. continue pare as is)

 3.   The CCP also appears to conduct much of its
 training of Free World Communists in courses of less than
 one year duration (often five to seven months), and to
 stress the practical rather than the theoretical in its
 training courses.  In addition to the organized training
 courses conducted in classrooms, however, it is also
 evident that the CCP favors seminars or conferences which
 can be held within a short period of time and which can
 include various foreign Communists from different countries
 who may be visiting in China at the time.  In these discussions
 Communists from different foreign areas are evidently
 brought together.
 4.   Like the CPSU, the CCP is prepared to finance
 the travel of trainees and to underwrite their expenses while
 in China.  The CCP equivalent of the CPSU's Foreign
 Section -- which one source has called the CCP's Central
 Liaison Department -- is concerned with the program of
 training foreign Communists in Party schools in China.
 It sponsors, coordinates and supports the training program
 involving foreign Communists.
 5.   The expanding program of training Latin American
 Communists suggests a CCP emphasis on underdeveloped
 countries where the experiences of the CCP may prove to
 be particularly applicable.  There is no information avail-
 able, however, concerning a CCP training program involving
 CP's from other underdeveloped areas.

 B.  Program for CF Japan
 1.  Knowledge of the CCP program for training members of the Japan
 Zk (JCP) has derived from several sources who were in China from 1953-
 1958.  Some slight discrepancies in dates and school names have been
 noted, but, in general, the extent and nature of the CCP program is
 evident.
 2.  Most of the evidence concerning the CCP program relates to
 the period 1953-1957, when special separate establishrents were set
 up for Japanese trainees.  In addition, there is some evidence that a
 few selected JCP members attended a regular CCP school during 1957-1958.
 After the first part of 1958, CCF training of JCP members was evidently
 curtailed as a result of the repatriation program, but there is
 evidence that at least some training of JCF members was continuing in
 the latter Dart of 1958.
 Temporary School at Yungnien (1963-1954)
 3.  In the fall of 1952, the Chinese were considering the status
 and repatriation of all Javanese residents in China.  From these
 residents, it was decided to select several hundred who would take part
 in a training program before they were returned to Japan.  The trainees
 were to be chosen from among all Japanese residents in various localities
 in China and were not bo be limited to JCP members alone.  The JCP
 organization in China, however, was clearly in immediate charge of the
 program.
 4.  In Y arch 1953, a school for the Japanese was established in
 Yungnien Hsien (Hopei Province), although it was evident that Yungnien
 was but a temporary school site and functioned primarily as an
 assembly point.  Students arrived in Yungnien little by little and
 the process of assembling was not complet       it about 0   ber.  The
 total number of students has been reported~etween 70t , with
 approximately 1500 being the best estimate.  The JCP leadership in
 China widently recommended the names of prospective candidates, but
 at least some trainees reportedly found themselves unwillingly at
 Yungnien as a result of persuasion, coercion and misinformation.
 5.  At Yungnien, the new arrivals were instructed to use aliases.
 They were forbidden to discuss with each other their occupational and
 personal histories, and they were directed to burn all personal papers,
 photographs and correspondence.  The students were organized into school
 companies- on the order of military components -- and each company had
 a JCP cell composed of the squad leaders, assistant squad leaders and one
 other Party member from each squad. Bow                               L.,

 6.  Officials of the school included both JOP and CCP members.
 Some have been identified as:

 principal (a ;- . - - T. ', e'Y,4 )

 NII (transliteration) - vice principal (in charge of

 rank equivalent go division ccomander

 INOUYE Hayasld (JCP) - deputy director of the Directorate
 of Training
 alias SUGIMOTO - a deputy director of training
 NAKAMURA Zentaro (JCP) - deputy director of the Administration
 TOGURA Kazuo (JCP) - worked in the Administration Office
 7. Despite the fact that non Party Japanese were also enrolled
 in the Yungnien school, the principal's address given on the day of
 admission to the school is said to have included the followings  This
 is a school to train JCP leaders of district committee amber caliber
 with the objective of arming the students in theories.  Students are
 requested to realize the importance of their mission and master the
 basic theories of revolution.
 8.  The teaching was evidently not intensive at Yungnien.  Studies,
 discussions and lectures included analysis of current news concerning
 Japan, other international affairs, and Marxist theories.
 School in Peivins (1956A1957)
 9.  In early 1954, the entire school was moved to a new location
 in a suburb of Peiping.  One-source has pinpointed the location as
 Lianghsiang, a suburb on the western outskirts of Peiping.  The school
 was newly built, with some construction still uncle  ay as the Yungnien
 trainees arrived.  During the three years of its existence, this
 school-was designated first as the Branch School of the Marx-Isnin
 Institute, and later was called the Branch School of the China
 People's University.
 1a.  The principal and vies prineipals were the same as those at
 Yungnien.  One new man, however, came from Japan to assume one of
 the vice principalahipe. - This was one ADACHI (believed to-have been
 KAWADA Kenji of the JCP Central Committee).  He arrived after the
 Sixth National Convention of the JCP in Japan, and lectured on
 decisions made at the convention as well as on conditions-in Ja-
 In mid-1956, both Principal TAKAKURA and Vice Arincipal ADACHI 1  t

 of the China Revolutionary Problems Research Office, was brought in and
 became the vice principal.

 U.  The teaching staff at the Peiping school numbered over :0,
 of whom ten were Japanese,, four were Soviets, and the remainder Chinese.
 Some of the subjects studied, and the instructors in each field, have
 been reported as follows:

 problem of women in China,  peace and the prohibition of atomic and
 hydrogen bombe, and the general theories nf-revolution,_incl?di  the
 theses of MAO Tse-tung.  Lectures were also given on the history of the
 CPSU, although it is not known who gave these lectures.

 12.  Texts used at the school consisted of published literature
 and material prepared by the instructors themselves.  According to one
 source, the instructors claimed that the preparation of texts on the
 history of the Chinese CP required considerable work because of a
 lack of material and guidance; only a meager amount-of Party records
 were available.  Works by LENIN, MAO Tse-Tung, LIU Shao-chi, and
 ohe KONSUTANCHIIFU (transliteration;           KONSTANTINOV) were among
 the texts studied.
 13.  The student body was organized into classes, with each class
 divided.-into-eight or nine groups (       ersons in a group).  Each- class
 had a class leader, assistant class leader and an organizer who were
 selected from Party members and who provided guidance in studies.  Party
 members held cell meetings within each class; non-Party members held
 "discussion meetings."  One source estimated that the total number of
 Party members-at the school was about 350-.  As the school term pro-
 gressed, however, there were increasing demands for membership in the
 JCP.  Indeed, one o  the topics frequently discussed at the cell
 meetings was "recruitment of new members".
 14.  Self-study and discussions were given more emphasis than
 lectures at the school.  Each lecture was followed by one to one-and-
 a-half days of self-study.  After the self-study, discussions monitored
 by one-or-two assistant instructors -especially-assigned-for-each  --
 subject were held within each class.  Examinations were held twice a
 year,
 15.  According to one source, the school received CCP direction
 through the CCP's Central Liaison Department.  From descriptions of
 this deuartment it is evident that this is the CCP's equivalent of
 the CPSU's Foreign Section and that this CCP liaison department, like
 that of the CPSU, is concerned - with- the program of training foreign
 Communists.
 16.  After graduation in the spring of 1957, the Japanese trainees
 spent about another year in China employed-in vsriaus-occUPttions: -
 The majority of the graduates were believed to'.have been repatriated
 -between- Apriland July 1958?---There- is- no- evidence- that specific Party
 missions were assigned to them.  The evidence does suggest that the
 Peiping school was - basically a training center in revolutionary
 activities, and that instruction was aimed at teaching the students
 dommunist principles and tradecraft.  Chinese instructors often
 described CCP strategies and tactics used against the 1 ucmintang.
 They cited specific techniques and indidents to demonstrate how
 particu    problems were met and solved by the CCP, and stressed the
 need to build a solid revolutionary base before entering into
 socialist programs.
 Enrollment in Regular CCP School (1957-1958)
 17.  It is believed that a handful of the JCP graduates from the
 Peiping school received further CCP training.  There is evidence that
 a few of these graduates may have attended a CCP Middle-Level Party
 wheel in- Chungking from about-June--195-7 until July- 1958.
 18.  The purpose of this school has been reported to be

 ''V- provid* cadres with actual training in the conduct of political
 campaigns.  The training was not a theoretical review; cadres participated
 in actual campaigns, directing and solving problems which they would
 later face in their Party wort.  One source has stated that, in
 essence, the training at this school consisted of exposing students to
 cheng feng (rectification), to wing to -fang  the "blocming and contending" ),
 to tzu pao (posters), and other campaigns before they were introduced
 on a national scale.  The training also exposed the shortceeaings of
 the students and eliminated those who were not qualified to carry out
 the programs of the Party.
 Japanese Trainees in the Sumer of 1958
 x'Z'&
 19.  'wring the seer of 1958, some
 were in Peiping to receive Party training.  One of these
 trainees observed on the school grrnmds a of of      Awal

 Japanese.  ne presumed that they were receiving training also and that
 the Japanese were housed in another of the residences in the school
 compound.  It therefore appears probable that CCP training of JCP
 members is a continuing program.

 including             one Free World CP in the Far East area that henceforth Party cadres
 'heading              would be sent to China ,and not -to thee USSR, -for - advanced training
 and practical experience.  By late 1957 it was evident that an
 increasing- number- of-Party m estbers were visiting China for several
 weeks and even months.  It was also apparent that they were obtaining
 and ex erience in China,
 Y. -
 2.  In November 1957 it was rip ( orted that Peiping was starting
 a school which would train about    members of this CP each year; the
 first sixteen were reportedly-then being selected.--But in view of
 the 1956 information, and the program already evident for this CP,
 it is quests unable whether the sixteen trainees rsportedJ in Nov ether
 1957 were the first such group.  In early 1959 it was estimated that
 since 1956 more than sixty high-level members and senior cadres of
 this Party had gone to China for training for average periods of
 five months.
 -    3 _ A defector has stated that the-s    etary-General of thin
 CF had been responsible for the original contact with the CCP whereby
 it was arranged for selected groups of Connninist cadres to go to
 China each year to attend indoctrination courses.   a stated that he
 knew from personal knowledge that those who had participated in
 such courses returned home thonoughly indoctrinated.-    had heard
 that the education included "field work", in the course of which the
 trainees were-obliged to sritnccs-some ac                      -as the -
 liquidation of a group of reactionary peasants.  If they watched such
 things without protest, they thus identified themselves morally with
 such behavior and would then commit themselves to clandestine and
 illegal activities if necessary.  In the case of other foreign trainees,
 --however, where there                             training they receive-- - - --
 in China, there is no suggestion of such activity.  "Field work" - in
 the sense of observing how- the CCP -is solving its problems - -is,
 however, a part of the CCP training given to foreign Communists.

 D.   Program for Latin American CP's
 1.   Evidence of a planned CCP program for training
 Latin American Communists was first manifested during the
 CPSU's celebrations in Moscow in November 1957 of the
 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.  During
 meetings between various CP representatives on this
 occasion, the CCP invited several Latin American parties
 to send trainees to a special CCP course to be held for
 them during the summer of 1958.  Necessary communications,
 and arrangements for transportation and finances for the
 trip, were to be handled by the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
 City (there are no Chinese Communist diplomatic estab-
 lishments in Latin America).                           Arrangements for another course
 for Latin American Communists -- to be held in the summer
 of 1959 -- were made during the visit to China of several
 Latin American CP leaders following their attendance at
 the CPSU's 21st Congress in January/Februaty 1959.
 The 1958 Course
 2.  As a result of the CCP invitation in November 1957,
 the first Latin American trainees for the CCP school
 arrived in Peiping (via Europe and Moscow) in April 1958.

 By the time the school term got underway in May, a total of seven

 3.  It was evident that the Chinese were disappointed that so few
 -- traimses attended the-school.  They had expected over twenty students from
 -_aame-seven CP+$--to--attend.  It xss also apparent that there had been some
 misunderstanding of the length of the school term.  Some of the trainees
 had expected the course to last only three to four months.  Instead,
 they found that the Chinese had planned a course lasting about seven months.
 4.  The Chinese made it clear that Central America had been singled
 out for this first school course for Latin America because, with few
 exceptions, the Central American parties were in poorer condition than
 any others in Latin America.  It was made clear, however, that in
 subsequent courses the Chinese anticipated that all Latin American OP's
 ~ouuld be represeate .  One CCP-spokesman--reportedly- stated that ~v courses
 lar to the-195t_caurse warn being Planned -for 195% but that these would
 ccmprise_two months of theoretical study and two months of practical
 application.  A CCP spokesman also mentioned that one of the prime
 difficulties at present was the lack of linguistically trained professors
 that currently there were only forty qualified Spanish translator-inter-
 preters in all of China although more linguists were rapidly being trained.

 5.   The school attended by the Latin American trainees
 was located in New Peiping on Fuhsing road.  All the
 buildings were located behind a ten-foot wall with electri-
 fied wire on top.  The school was a completely equipped
 institution with four combination residence-classrooms,
 gardens, garages, power plant, offices, movie theater
 and other facilities.  All of the Latin American trainees
 stayed in one building. * They were told that the school
 grounds were built especially for that course.
 6.   In early August, the heat and humidity in Peiping
 caused the classes to be transferred to Port Dairen.  All
 the Latin American trainees, plus their instructors and
 interpreters, flew to Dairen in a plane piloted by Chinese
 air force officers.  In Dairen the trainees lived in a palace
 which once belonged to the brother of the Emperor of
 Manchuria; their classes were also held there.
 7.   The theoretical part of the course lasted from
 mid-May until mid-August, after which the emphasis
 was on field trips.  According to a reliable source, the
 classes attended by the Latin American trainees covered
 the following main subjects.
 * As indicated in sectionUI B., one Latin American Commu-
 nist observed about twelve Japanese on the school grounds
 and presumed that they were housed in another of the
 residences in the school compound.  He also observed
 four "Negroes" and two other persons whom he thought
 were Hindus.  Possibly these were housed in other school
 residences.  Presumably, all of these were trainees.
 There was evidently no contact at all with the Latin Americans,
 however.

 cities of Changchun, Shanghai, and Canton, and to Hunan
 province.  In Peiping, the trainees also met with high CCP
 officials, including CHOU En-lai who talked with them con-
 cerning the necessity for Communist China to establish commer-
 cial and diplomatic relations with the Latin American countries.

 10.   Throughout their stay in China the Latin American
 trainees were asked many questions, by school officials
 as well as other CCP officials, concerning political,
 social, economic and cultural conditions in their respective
 countries.  At the beginning of the school term each
 student was given.               questionnaire involving
 conditions in his native country.  The students were also
 queried concerning any Chinese militants or sympathizers
 who might belong to their CP's; they were asked about the
 location of Chinese communities in Latin American
 countries to which propaganda material might be sent.
 Some of the trainees were questioned about the intelligence
 services in their countries.

 11.   The school for the Latin American trainees has
 been described as operating under the CCPts "Department
 of Liaison for Latin American Relations." This evidently
 refers to the Latin American section o th  CCPts Liaison
 Department. -- which iLe Japanese          called the Central
 Liaison Department.  The Latin American trainees have
 referred to a CCP Department in charge of Foreign Relations,
 but this may be the same thing.  The teachers and interpreters
 at the school were reportedly assigned by the CCP Depart-
 ment of Party Education.  Among the CCP personnel
 identified in connection with the school were (names are
 phonetic, corrected where possible):
 LIU (or LI) Tan-fu -- chief of the CCP liaison
 department fcr Latin America
 CHAO (fnu) -- chief of receptions for the Latin
 American liaison department
 CHAO Ming-h sien -- interpreter

 12.  The CCP offered no material aid to the Latin
 American CP's.  Instead, the students were told that the
 main CCP effort to assist the Latin American parties
 would be through courses of the type which the trainees were
 then attending.
 The 1959 Course

 of several Latin American CP's traveled to China from

 These CP representatives were called
 to a meeting with one LI, described as a member of the
 CCP's Department of Foreign Relations, and other officials.
 (It is possible that this LI may be identical with the LIU
 Tan-fu or LI Tan-fu who was identified during the 1958
 course for Latin Americans as chief of the CCP liaison
 department for Latin America).  The CCP officials advised
 the Latin American CP representatives as follows.
 a.   The CCP had decided to prepare a four to
 six months course for Latin American students.
 b.   The course would be based on the practical
 experiences of the Chinese Revolution.  Its aim would
 not be to teach general Marxist-Leninist theory,
 because that can be learned in any country.
 c.   The students should therefore be chosen from
 among leadership cadres at the national, provincial
 or municipal level.

 Moscow after attending the CPSU's 21st Congress.  Fifteen Latin American
 CP's are believed to have had representatives in China at this time,
 although Chinese overt announcements listed representatives frcn only

 American CP's individually asked CCP leaders to make possible the sending
 of party members to dtudy under CCP direction.  (etc. as written on page)

 party would-send.  Most--of the representatives estimated that-three to
 five trainees would be sent from each CP.  At the CCP's request, each
 CP then presented to the Chinese an air-transportation "budget" which
 would reflect the cost of travel from the respective countries to Prague,
 where the trainees would be picked up and flown to China via Moscow.

 d.   The CCP would pay all costs for this training,
 including air transportation to China.
 e.   The students should arrive in China by
 July 1959, since the course will begin about 1 August.
 25X1X6
 Before the Latin American representatives left China,
 they were given a sum in US currency with which to pay
 the transportation costs for each proposed student.
 The amounts varied, but the average was about $700 per
 student.
 16.   By June 1959 at least two of the Latin American
 CP's had selected their trainees for the forthcoming CCP
 course.    Presumably the other CP's involved had done so
 as well.   It is also known that in June one of the selected
 trainees was preparing reports which he would carry
 to the CCP.  During the visit to China of the Latin American
 CP representatives, the CCP had requested certain reports
 from the various CP's and had suggested that the reports
 be sent to China with the trainees scheduled for the
 forthcoming course.  The CCP requested general reports
 on the CP's concerned, and on the political situation in
 those countries.

 E.   CCP Short-term Seminars and Courses
 1.   Several reports have indicated that foreign
 Communists, while visiting for a short time in China,
 may attend seminars or special indoctrination courses.
 These are apparently efforts by the CCP to indoctrinate
 and train foreign Communists without setting up elaborate
 or long-term training programs.  Possibly this method of
 training has been utilized by the CCP because of the
 distance and the difficulties many foreign Communists
 would encounter in traveling to China for longer periods.
 2.   In 1956 an indoctrination course was given to
 foreign CP representatives in China (probably  several
 of those who had come to attend the CCP Congress held
 in 1956).  The "course" consisted of a series of eight
 conferences, in which were discussed the lessons learned
 by the Chinese Communists during the course of their rise
 to power.  The individual conferences were on the following
 subjects:
 a.   the characteristics of China (and of other
 countries) which affected the development of the
 Revolution and the Party;
 b.   experiences in clandestine work;
 c.   experiences in rural areas; the agrarian
 reform;
 d.   experiences in educational work;
 e.   experiences in the armed struggle; guerrilla
 warfare;

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01100170011-9
 f.   experiences in building the united front;
 the campaign for the rectification of the
 style of Party work;
 h.   experiences regarding the transition to
 Socialism.
 3.   Much of the material on which these discussions
 were based was to be found in the works of MAO Tse-tung
 and LIU Shao-ch'i.  The foreign CP delegates were instructed
 to read these works carefully and critically, utilizing
 and developing those aspects which would be applied to
 their own parties.
 4.   These conferences illustrate the "practical
 experiences" which the CCP prefers to teach instead
 of Marxist-Leninist theory.  One of the discussions on
 clandestine work, for example, concerned the "Bases and
 Experiences of Legal and Illegal Activity."  Under this
 heading, the foreign CP representatives heard discussions
 concerning why there is legal activity and illegal activity;
 legal and illegal activities according to the different
 historical situations; the differences between legal and
 illegal activity, and how one is transformed into the other;
 how an illegal party can utilize legal possibilities; and two
 points of view on the question of legal and illegal activity.
 Another discussion provided an example of the application
 of clandestine tactics in a specific historical situation:
 CCP experiences in clandestine work in Shanghai.
 5.   During 1958, several short-term courses were
 reportedly given to foreign Communists in China.  Unlike
 the 1956 conferences mentioned above, it has not been
 possible to obtain documentary or firm evidence concerning

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01100170011-9
 L
 these courses.  There is no reason to doubt, however,
 that some courses were arranged by the CCP in order to
 take advantage of the visits to China by several foreign
 Communists.  Courses reported during 1958 -- all of
 one to three months duration -- concerned the following
 subjects:
 a.   agrarian law (presumably land reform measures);
 b.   jurists (meaning of this is not clear, but it
 may concern how Communists can utilize existing laws
 to achieve their own purposes);
 c.   leadership and preparation of Communist
 youth and students (this course was reportedly given
 to some foreign Communists who had been in Peiping
 to attend a meeting of the International Union of Students).
 6.   The most recently reported short-term CCP course
 for foreign Communists concerns a "leadership" course to be held
 for some Communist leaders in Peiping following the
 Seventh World Youth Festival held in Vienna, Austria in
 July/August 1959.  Presumably, some foreign Communists
 were to travel to China from Vienna following the Festival.
 7.   The steadily increasing numbers of foreign Commu-
 nists who are traveling to Communist China will undoubtedly
 * It is at least possible that this "leadership" course is
 actually the 1959 course for the Latin American Communists.
 Information concerning this training to follow the Youth
 Festival was obtained from a Latin American source.

 be utilized by the CCP for training and indoctrination
 purposes.  Sometimes this may take the form only of
 "briefings" by CCP leaders.  During the February/March
 1959 visit to China of Latin American CP representatives,
 it is known that CCP leaders, including MAO Tse-tung,
 briefed the CP representatives on international affairs
 and on the "liberation struggle" in Latin America.
 F.   Evidence of Other Programs
 1.   The fact that one of the Latin American trainees
 at the 1958 CCP course spotted four "Negroes" and two
 "Hindus" on the grounds of the school compound is the
 most definitive evidence available that the CCP is
 training Free World Communists from other, as yet uniden-
 tified, CP's.
