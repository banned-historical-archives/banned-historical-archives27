 August 20, 1965         CONORESSIOV'AL' RECORD   SENATE
 S  t, in which Federal funds are used to
 underwrite costs of preschool training for
 children of the "hard core" poor.
 With the handling of this project his tar-
 get Representative  CHARLES  R. JONAS, Re-
 publican, of North Carolina, described what
 he called "a glaring example of extra cost
 whenever the Federal Government insists
 on handling a local program out of Washing-
 ton."
 Mr. JONAS, pointing out that his State al-
 ready had such a program in operation, fi-
 nanced by non-Federal funds,  said that
 North Carolina applied for Federal money to
 expand the program only to have the appli-
 cation rejected. The Congressman added:
 "The sole reason advanced by the Director
 of Project Head Start for rejecting the North
 Carolina plan was that our plan was based
 on State administration of the funds and
 program.
 "It apparently did not matter to the Fed-
 eral officials that the North Carolina pro-
 gram had been conducted by professional
 and trained public schoolteachers at a cost
 of $30 per child and that the federally di-
 rected program would cost $170 per child.
 "They were not interested in expanding a
 well established and efficiently operating pro-
 gram which would cost $140 per child less
 than the Federal program,,, but their concern
 was to retain control and direction of the
 program in the hands of Federal officials."
 A complaint about Project Head Start ex-
 pressed by educators in Boston:
 Children of "hard core" poor families are
 not being reached by the project because, as
 one teacher put it: "Nobody in their families
 cares enough to put them in it."
 A private day-care center for children of
 working parents in Indianapolis has com-
 plained that some of its teachers have been
 lured by higher salaries to an antipoverty
 preschool program.
 An incident at San Antonia, Tex., reported
 in the San Antonio News:
 A San Antonio physician refused to par-
 ticipate in a medical examination program
 for children involved in Project Head Start
 because she objected to the speed with which
 the youngsters were being processed.
 The physician said that some 100 children
 were rushed though in 1 hour.  The school
 district involved, which handles funds for
 the project, pays $5 for every 20 examina-
 tions.  The San Antonio physician said that
 tests required by the Federal Government
 could not be completed properly at the pace
 set.
 Adverse comment has been created in some
 areas by the antipoverty program's practice
 of paying teachers' salaries higher than those
 paid in public school systems.
 Typical of this comment is a statement
 by a Texan, referring to the academic staff
 at a Job Corps center:
 "They have pulled out of the school sys-
 tem good instructors and teachers with mas-
 ter's  degrees.   These  teachers  are  sorely
 needed in our public schools. There is quite
 a lot of dissension among teachers about the
 difference between their salaries of $5,000 and
 the $9,000 a year paid at Camp Gary."
 A prominent Negro educator,  Lester B.
 Granger, of Dillard University, New Orleans,
 called the antipoverty program a slaphappy,
 sloppy,  wasteful  procedure.  Mr.  Granger
 told the National Urban League convention:
 "The fat should be taken out of it.      We
 are going to waste two-thirds of the funds
 going into it, just like the New Deal. This
 doesn't mean I don't support it.  If we get
 even one-third out of it, it would help."
 The spreading complaints about the way
 the poverty war is run have been echoed in
 strong criticism in Congress, by members of
 both parties.
 Some examples, from The CONGRESSIONAL
 REcoRD-
 Representative  DONALD  D.  CLANCY,  Re-
 publican, of Ohio, branded the war "an
 obvious fiasco." Mr. CLANCY said: "There is
 hardly an aspect of the program that has
 not become mired in waste and utter con-
 fusion."
 Representative EbwARD  J.  GURNEY,  Re-
 publican,                                                                 of  Florida:  "Funds  have been
 given  out  without Investigation to sham
 groups, in  areas where  poverty is almost
 unknown."
 Mr. GURNEY said that in one such area, in
 Ypsilanti, Mich., "over 90 percent of the pop-
 ulation own their homes, nearly everyone has
 at least one car and a TV set, and the average
 family income is just dollars short of $8,000."
 A sample of political in-fighting in the
 antipoverty operation was given by Repre-
 sentative  LEONARD  FARBSTEIN,  Democrat, of
 New York.  Assailing William F. Haddad, the -
 program's  inspector  general,  Mr.  FARB-
 STEIN told the House:
 "He is the gentleman who ran against me
 last year and has stated publicly that he
 is going to run again. Now it is my opinion
 that he is subverting parts of this program
 for his own personal political gain.  I think
 he is attempting to build a personal political
 organization out of poverty funds."
 In spite of the rash of criticism in Con-
 gress  and  from  around the  country,  the
 heavily Democratic Congress insists upon
 giving Mr. Shriver more spending authority
 than he said he needed to expand the war
 against poverty.
 In so doing, the legislators disregard such
 comment as that of Representative ALBERT
 H. QUIE, Republican, of Minnesota, who said:
 "This program could become not just a
 national disgrace, but a national catastro-
 INFILTRA'I`gQN..-OF  VIETNAMESE-
 SPEAKING  RED  CHINESE INTO
 VIETNAM
 Mr. MILLER.  Mr. President, the de-
 gree and type of Red China's interven-
 tion in the Vietnam war has become a
 matter of grave concern to many.
 It was brought home in a report car-
 ried in the Sunday Star of August 8 that
 Communist  China  has  declared she
 would definitely intervene in the war if
 the United States continues its military
 buildup in that southeast Asia nation.
 It was again underscored in an August
 16 article in the Washington Post when
 Gen. Earle G. Wheeler, chairman of the
 Joint Chiefs of Staff, commented that
 Red China has "moved certain air units
 down into the southern part of China
 nearer to the border of North Vietnam."
 Both these reports indicate the pos-
 sibility of direct intervention in the war.
 But they also could indicate that Red
 China wants to bluff the free world into
 believing that it will enter the war, and
 thus force -a negotiated settlement on
 Communist terms.
 In my opinion, Red China does not
 wish to intervene to the extent that she
 would have to take on the United States
 in a head-on confrontation.
 Gen. Maxwell Taylor, former U.S. Am-
 bassador to South Vietnam, and ex-
 chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
 apparently holds this belief.
 According to the August 16 New York
 Herald-Tribune,  General  Taylor  re-
 marked that traditional hostility be-
 tween Red China and North Vietnam and
 Peiping's fear of the United States would
 20421
 "likely hold back the Red Chinese" from
 intervening in the war.
 However, as one Communist diplomat
 was quoted as saying in the Washington
 Post of August 16, the United States is
 overplaying the historical aspect of the
 friction between Red China and North
 Vietnam and underestimating the polit-
 ical ties between Hanoi and Peiping.
 I believe Red China will more likely
 seek to accomplish her ends through in-
 filtration at this time, hoping the United
 States will not regard this as sufficient
 cause for retaliation.  If one reads his-
 tory, it can be seen that such tactics have
 played a significant role in the East-West
 struggle since early in the post World
 War II period.
 Infiltration, blending into so-called
 guerrilla movements, is designed to en-
 able the Communists to avoid free world
 counteraction because it is difficult to
 make  a  clear  legal  case  justifying
 counterintervention.  Such tactics per-
 mit delaying counteraction until the
 strength of the guerrilla movement has
 grown to such a point as to magnify
 greatly the difficulties of defeating it.
 This type of warfare has its roots in
 the strategic and tactical principles de-
 signed by Red China's Mao Tse-tung.
 Infiltration, then, is the method Red
 China will most likely use if and when
 she decides to take a more active part
 in the Vietnam conflict.
 The question then is: When will Red
 China take this step?
 I believe that Red China may already
 be pursuing this course of action.
 That these fears apparently have some
 foundation is supported, in part, by an
 article which the Library of Congress has
 translated from a Chinese newspaper.
 I will come back to that in a few minutes.
 First I would like to sketch in some back-
 ground which will lend credence to my
 case.
 The likelihood of Red Chinese infiltra-
 tion into the Vietnam war has grown as a
 result of the defection to Red China of
 Gen. Li Tsung-jen.  General Li was a
 former Vice President of Nationalist
 China. He was Acting President of Na-
 tionalist China at the time of the Com-
 munist takeover on the mainland.
 After residing in exile in the United
 States for the better part of. 16 years,
 General Li showed up in Red China on
 July 20 of this year.  Needless to say,
 this was a propaganda coup for Red
 China.  But after an initial volley of de-
 nunciations of the country which had
 harbored him for nearly 16 years, Gen-
 eral Li faded from the scene.
 At the same time, from various reports
 in newspapers at -the time of his appear-
 ance in Red China, it was indicated that
 the State Department was not greatly
 disturbed over the defection.  This un-
 concern prompted me to pursue the mat-
 ter a little further.
 Apparently the State Department had
 ignored General Li's background.  It
 had ignored the fact that General Li had
 been an able governor of Kwangsi Prov-
 ince, bordering what is now North Viet-
 nam.

 2402                    CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-. SENATE         August 20, 1965
 This alone could very well indicate that
 Kwangsi Province, if infiltration is to be
 successful, would be the key in any plans
 of Mao.  What better way to cement to
 gether an effective force from this prov-
 ince than to bring back the one person
 held in great esteem by the people there.
 . I would like to quote an, observation
 from "China : An Area Manual." pre-
 pared by the Operations Research Office
 of Johns Hopkins University, under con-
 tract with the Department of the Army:
 Kwangsl was for many years governed well
 by two able generals, Pai Ch'ung-hsi and `Li
 Tsung-jen, who did much to give the prov-
 ince peace and a stable economy.  Tho  It
 not friends of Chiang Kai-shek, Li and Psi
 were not run-of-the-mine warlords; rattier
 they were men with a sense bf public re-
 sponsibility.  Their partial independence en-
 abled them to train one of the best armies in
 China.
 deeply impressed with Li Tsung-jen.  If he
 goes there and organizes them into militia
 corps they would be happy to respond.
 This, Mr. President, fits squarely with
 the observation in the manual prepared
 for the Department of Army by Johns
 Hopkins.
 Continuing, the article said:
 A  total  of  50,000  Vietnamese-speaking
 Kwangsl people will be conscripted as a first
 step.
 According to intelligence from Nanning,
 Li Tsung-jen, who was  accompanied  by
 Chinese  military  leaders,  Gen.  Lin Piao
 and  Lo  Jui-ch'ing,  flew to Kweilin from
 Peiping. They immediately went to Nanning
 to call  a  local high level conference, to
 launch P. movement for the Yao minority
 group to participate in the war. Fifty thou-
 sand volunteers of both sexes who can speak
 Vietnamese will be organized into military
 service. The reserve army will also be com-
 posed of 50,000 people.  Lin Piao will be re-
 sponsible for political      indoctrination, and
 Lo Jui-ch'ing will be responsible for intelli-
 gence work.  Within a short time they will
 be dispatched from Hanoi to the battlefields
 in South Vietnam  to assist the Vietcong
 guerrillas in resisting American troops and
 the troops of South Vietnam.
 In this connection, a few days ago the
 distinguished minority leader of the
 House of Representatives, Representative
 FORD, of Michigan, and I exchanged views
 on a television program, to the effect
 that we thought the use of Nationalist
 Chinese forces in South Vietnam should
 be considered.
 Some rather superficial responses to
 that suggestion were made to the effect
 that this would perhaps provoke the Red
 Chinese to enter the war. I suggest that
 on the basis of what I have disclosed thus
 far in my speech, whether Nationalist
 Chinese forces are or are not used in
 South Vietnam makes little difference.
 It appears that the decision has already
 been made by Red China to intervene in
 the Vietnamese war.
 If one examines a map, it can readily
 be seen that the railroad from Kwangsi
 Province can be used to transport this
 force into North Vietnam, and then down
 to the South Vietnam border.
 One can readily see that air units on
 Hainan Island, jutting from southern
 China-Kwangsi Province-into the Gulf
 of Tonkin could be used to airlift these
 forces across the gulf either into posi-
 tions adjacent to the North Vietnam-
 South Vietnam border or into South
 Vietnam Itself.  There are at least two
 known airfields on Hainan Island now;
 probably there are more.
 Mr. President, if, in fact, these reports
 are accurate, then we had better prepare
 ourselves for a change in the intensity of
 the war.
 I ask unanimous consent that an arti-
 cle entitled "Red Chinese Pledge Inter-
 vention in War," published in the Wash-
 ington Star of August 8, an article en-
 titled "Wheeler Says Chinese Move Air
 Units South," published in the Wash-
 ington Post on August 16, and also the
 various articles bearing on the defection
 of Gen. Li Tsung-jen, be printed at
 this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Washington (D.C.) Evening Star,
 Aug. 8, 1965)
 RED CHINESE PLEDGE INTERVENTION IN WAR-
 CITE INTENT To ACT IF U.S. FORCE RISES
 Tours.-Communist China declared Satur-
 day                                                                                                                               It would            definitely  intervene  in  the
 Vietnam   conflict,   as  it  has  repeatedly
 pledged to the Vietnamese people, if the
 United States continues its military buildup
 there.
 "We warn the U.S. aggressors once more:
 We, Chinese people mean what we say," the
 Chinese Communists asserted.
 "We, the 650 million Chinese people, have
 repeatedly pledged to the Vietnamese people
 our all-out support and assistance, up toand
 including the sending, according to their
 need, of our men to fight shoulder to shoul-
 der with them to drive out the U.S. aggres-
 sors."
 The warning was contained in a Commu-
 nist  Chinese  government  statement  dis-
 tributed internationally by the New China
 News Agency in a broadcast monitored here.
 JOHNSON OFFER REJECTED
 It also ruled out any peace offer by Presi-
 dent  Johnson                                                                                                                                                                and  said  "The facts have
 proved once again that Johnson's talk about
 peace negotiations is fraudulent;  what he
 really means is expansion of the war."
 The Peiping statement was in response to
 President Johnson's July 28 statement in
 which he said he is adding 50,000 U.S. troops
 in Vietnam.
 Peiping  then  reiterated  the  four-point
 Communist proposal as the only solution for
 the Vietnam issue.  These four points in-
 clude withdrawal of all U.S. Forces from
 South Vietnam.
 It was the third Communist reaction in
 two days to Johnson's statement.  The Viet-
 cong asked Communist North Vietnam Fri-
 day for active help in battling the Ameri-
 cans.                                                                                                                               And it Soviet Government statement
 said U.S. leaders "should have no delusions
 that American aggression would go unpun-
 ished."
 "UNJUST CAUSE"
 Red China said the United States is send-
 ing large numbers of troops to take part in
 combat in South Vietnam and added:
 "This display of arrogance and ferocity is
 actually  but the  swagger   of  a  helpless
 desperado.  The United States is fighting for
 an unjust cause in Vietnam, hence the low
 morale of its soldiers and the paucity of sup-
 port it gets."
 Predicting  victory  for     the   Vietcong,
 Peiping assailed Johnson's statement on a
 willingness to discuss peace.
 "Johnson's  statement of July 28 was a
 wholesale  exposure  of the  counterrevolu-
 tionary dual tactics used by the U.S. imperi-
 alists.
 "While announcing the sending of large
 reinforcements   to  South   Vietnam,   he
 hypocritically talked about America's will-
 ingness to begin unconditional discussions
 with any government at any place at any
 time.  This was not the first time Johnson
 played such a trick.
 FOUR-POINT STAND OUTLINED

 ministrative region of mainland China;
 it is surrounded by Kwangti4ng, Hunan,
 Kweichow, Yunnan, North Vietnam, and
 the Gulf of Tonkin.
 The chief agricultural crop is rice; it
 is the second leading tin-producing pro-
 vince.
 The chief railroad is the Hunan
 Kwangsl-Kweichow  line  from Heng-
 yang in Hunan, which passes through
 northern  Kwangsl via   Ch'uan-hsien,
 Kuel-lin and Liu-chow and proceeds. into
 Kwelehow Province.  There is a vital
 railroad extending from deep in Kwangsi
 Province to the North Vietnam capital
 of Hanoi.
 On August 6, the Chinese newspaper,
 Min Chili Journal, published in New
 York, ran this article with a" Hong Kong
 dateline.
 The headline was: "Li Tsung-jen ar-
 rived in Kwangsl."
 This is the same Li Tsung-jen who
 defected from the United States on July
 20 and who played such a vital role in
 Kwangsl Province.
 The text of the article follows:
 The  policymaking  body  in  Communist
 China led by Chairman Mao Tse-tung re-
 alized the difference between the attitude
 toward the Vietnam war taken by President
 Johfison and the attitude toward the Korean
 war taken by President Truman, and has not
 publicly  and  overtly  dispatched  Chinese
 Communist volunteers to participate in the
 Vietnam war, for fear of bombardment of the
 mainland by American airplanes.  Now they
 have devised effective measures in assisting
 Ho Chi-Minh by sending large groups of
 Vietnamese-speaking militia to participate
 in the velar.  Even if they are captured they
 can pretend that they are volunteers from
 North Vietnam because they can speak the
 Vietnamese language.  Thus the Americans
 cannot find any pretext to attack the Chi-
 nese. The people deep in Kwangsi and along
 the borders of North Vietnam were in the
 past deeply impressed with Li Tsung-jen. If
 lie goes there and organizes them into mili-
 tia corps they would be happy to respond.

 WHEELER  SAYS     CHINESE  MOVE  AIR  UNITS
 SOUTH
 (By Richard Halloran)
 The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
 said yesterday that Communist China has
 "moved certain air units down into the
 southern part of China nearer to the border
 of North Vietnam."
 Gen. Earle G. Wheeler added that the Chi-
 nese  have  increased  somewhat  their  air
 forces on Hainan Island, which juts from
 southern China into the Gulf of Tonkin.
 But Wheeler did not advocate American
 air strikes against  the  Chinese buildup,
 which he said does not include ground forces
 so far.  Wheeler appeared on the television
 show "Issues and Answers" (ABC-WMAL).
 Representative GERALD R. FORD, of Michi-
 gan, the House minority leader, agreed with
 Wheeler that the United Staters should not
 carry the war to China.
 URGES WIDENED BOMBING
 But FORD strongly advocated bombing sig-
 nificant military targets in North Vietnam's
 heavily populated,  industrial  area around
 Hanoi and Haiphong.  FORD was interviewed
 on "Face the Nation" (CBS-WTOP) .
 "Our Air Force with all their training and
 all their equipment ought to be capable of
 pinpointing significant military targets In
 any area in North Vietnam," he said.
 On relations between China and North
 Vietnam, Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor asserted
 yesterday that North Vietnamese  leaders
 have more to fear from China than from the
 United States.
 TRADITIONAL ENEMY
 The former Ambassador to Saigon said
 that the Chinese are very unpopular in both
 Vietnams, and they have been a traditional
 enemy through history. Taylor spoke in an
 interview with House Majority Whip HALE
 BOGGS,  Democrat, of Louisiana, for a New
 Orleans television station.
 A Communist diplomat here disputed this
 view, saying the United States is overplaying
 the historical aspect and underestimating
 the political ties between Hanoi and Peiping.
 On the military front, General Wheeler
 confirmed reports that North Vietnam has
 semimobile surface-to-air missile equipment
 In addition to the five SAM sites emplaced
 around Hanoi.
 He said he didn't know how much of this
 equipment North Vietnam has, nor whether
 Russians are manning it.  But because of
 these missiles, Wheeler said, "Our pilots have
 got to be more careful in the areas over
 which they fly."
 Wheeler reiterated the administration view
 that American forces are not taking over the
 Vietnam war.  But  he  said, "in certain
 instances, Vietnamese officers have volun-
 achieve a better military organization for
 command."
 On news coverage of the war, Wheeler ac-
 knowledged that relations between govern-
 ment officials in Saigon and the press were
 not good.  But he insisted that "a great deal
 of information is set down for the benefit of
 the press."
 The General also said that "we are going
 to have to take a very hard look" at the possi-
 bility of military censorship.   He said he
 was distressed by advance publication of mil-
 itary movements.

 (By Seymour Topping)
 HONG KONG, July 20.-Gen. Li Tsung-jeh,
 former Acting President of Nationalist China,
 who flew to Peiping today after 16 years of
 exile in the United States, pledged support
 of the Communist cause to make up for his
 guilty past.
 In a statement at the airport distributed
 by Hsinhua, the Chinese Communist press
 agency, the 74-year-old general appealed to
 Nationalist political and military leaders on
 Taiwan to follow his example and join in a
 common front against the United States.
 The  former  anti-Communist  leader  ac-
 cused President Johnson of expanding the
 war in Vietnam and "thereby even trying to
 provoke war against the Chinese people."
 The general was. warmly welcomed at the
 airport by Premier Chou En-lat and more
 than 100 other prominent political figures,
 .including a number of Nationalist officials
 who had defected since the Communist con-
 quest of the Chinese mainland in 1949.
 The demonstrative reception  seemed  to
 have been intended to encourage other Na-
 tionalist officials to rally to Peiping.
 HE DISAPPEARED IN ZURICH
 General Li, accompanied by his wife, Kuo
 Teh-chieh, flew to the Chinese Communist
 capital by a secret route aboard a special
 plane after having disappeared in Zurich,
 Switzerland.
 The general left the United States for
 Zurich last month after having sold his New
 Jersey home. He told friends that he wished
 to be with his wife, who was recuperating
 from an operation for cancer, but that he
 would return to the United States.
 It was understood that U.S. officials had be-
 come aware of the general's probable inten-
 tion to go to Communist China but had taken
 no action to, block his departure from New
 York.
 U.S. officials also anticipated that upon
 his arrival in Peiping the general would take
 up  the  Chinese  Communist  propaganda
 line against the Johnson administration.
 General Li, following a distinguished mili-
 tary career, became Vice President of Nation-
 alist China in 1948 while the civil war with
 the Communists was in progress. After Gen-
 eralissimo Chiang Kai-shek had temporarily
 retired as President, General Li served as Ac-
 ting President from January 21, 1949, to
 February 28, 1950.
 HE FORMED A THIRD FORCE
 Declining to  join  Generalissimo  Chiang
 in his refuge on Taiwan, General Li went
 to the United States in December 1949.                                He
 later                              broke  with  the  Taiwan  group   and
 formed what he called a third force to re-
 gain power in mainland China.
 In his statement in Peiping today, General
 Li said that his first mistake had been his
 refusal to accept the Communist accession
 to power and his second had been an abortive
 effort to start a third force movement.
 Cheng Su-yuan, who had been an aide to
 20423
 General Li in the third force movement and
 particularly active in Hong Kong, accom-
 panied  the  former  Nationalist  leader                                                   to
 Peiping today.
 Hsinhua distributed abroad a text of the
 statement by General Li. The Commmunist
 press agency said that the statement had
 been issued on his arrival but did not say
 whether it was being read by the general.
 In his statement General Li said he would
 like to advise his "comrades on Taiwan of
 impressions formed during my more than a
 decade's stay in the United States."  He con-
 tinued :
 "For years the United States has pur-
 ported to be opposing communism, yet it is
 actually committing a series of sordid crimes
 against the people of China and of the world,
 in an attempt to isolate China and dominate
 the world."
 U.S. DESIGNS ON TAIWAN SEEN
 The statement asserted that "the United
 States has been bent on seizing Taiwan for
 itself and has stopped at no tricks, and plots
 to attain this end."  It added that "reunion
 of Taiwan with the mainland is purely
 China's internal affair, in which the United
 States must not be allowed to meddle."
 In urging Nationalist leaders on Taiwan
 to defect to Communist China, the statement
 reminded them that Peiping had long ago
 announced a policy that "all patriots, both
 forerunners and latecomers, belong to the
 same family and that freedom of movement
 is guaranteed both to and from the main-
 land."
 Chinese sources in Hong Kong said it was
 expected that General Li would be given a
 titular post in the Peiping government sim-
 ilar to those awarded to Nationalists officials
 who rallied to Communist China.
 TAIWAN Is NOT SURPRISED
 TAIPEI, TAIWAN, July 20.-Nationalist China
 brushed aside today the defection of General
 Li but looked for the Peiping Communists
 to exploit it as a major cold war victory.
 Officials declined to talk about the cross-
 over, saying they did not want to lend it
 undue importance.   General Li had been
 read out of the ruling Kuomintank party in
 1952  after  having  clashed with  President
 Chiang.
 Word of the defection had been in the wind
 in Taiwan for a week.
 Thus the Peiping announcements came as
 no great shock to, the Nationalists.
 CHIEF DEFECTOR TO REDS
 WASHINGTON, July 20.-General Li is the
 most prominent figure to go over to the
 Chinese Communists since the collapse of
 the Nationalist regime.
 "There is no doubt that Peiping will try
 to get as much play as possible out of this."
 commented  one  official  closely  connected
 with Chinese affairs. "I don't expect a wave
 of defections from Taiwan, but it may give
 some of Li's old associates food for thought."
 Most experts on China at the State De-
 partment took the view that the effect of the
 aged former war lord's return was consider-
 ably limited by two factors.
 One was the personal motives that are be-
 lieved to have underlain his  action.  The
 general lived quietly with his wife in New
 Jersey and took next to no part in the politi-
 cal discussions and efforts that are common
 among some prominent Chinese exiles.
 General Li was described ashaving been
 almost completely dependent upon his wife
 in dealing with his surroundings.  The grave
 illness of Mrs. Li is believed to have been
 a strong motive in inducing General Li to
 give up his life here and return to China,
 where some of his wife's relatives still live.
 As for the second factor, General Li during
 his exile in the United States was considered
 by Taiwan to have cut himself off from the
 Nationalist movement.  For this reason ex-

 ports here believe that the Nationalist Gov-
 ernment will be able to play down the sig-
 nificance of his return.
 MOVE ASTONISHES COLLEAGUES
 (By Farnsworth Fowle)
 General Li's return to Communist China
 astonished American scholars at Columbia
 University with whom he had worked on a
 1,000-page autobiography in English transla-
 tion now complete and under consideration
 for publication by the Columbia University
 Press.
 It was one of five taperecorded memoirs
 by leaders of Nationalist China undertaken
 since 1959, by the university with the assist-
 ance of the Ford Foundation.
 General Li had been a perennial critic of
 the Nationalist administration on Taiwan
 and had never visited the island.
 Although he had duly arranged his trip
 with his wife to Switzerland through the
 United States Immigration and Naturaliza-
 tion Service office in Newark, he had not told
 his Columbia associates of his plans.   They
 said one of his Chinese friends had received a
 letter from him in Switzerland telling of the
 couple's decision  to  return to mainland
 Ohina.."
 General Li's motives for adhering to Com-
 Imunist China were a matter of speculation,
 as were the time and place of planning his
 return.
 Chinese nationalist, sources have circulated
 reports, which they describe as unconfirmed
 that two Chinese Communist agents moved
 iinto his neighborhood in Englewood Cliffs,
 N.J., where he owned so house at 77 New
 Street,  and that they started winning his
 confidence several years ago.
 Other associates thought that advancing
 age and the difficulty of obtaining servants
 might have impelled General and Mrs. LI
 to seek a more comfortable existence in their
 native land.
 These sources had heard unconfirmed re-
 ports that Mrs. Li had a brother in Switzer-
 land and that plans for the return to main-
 land China  might  have been  arranged
 through him rather than in this country.
 General Li spent some time in Europe in
 41963, returning to the United States Decem-
 ber 21 of that year.  In applying this spring
 for permission from the Immigration and
 Naturalization Service to leave the United
 States and return, he said he planned to
 leave in May and spend about 3 months
 abroad.  The permission was granted April
 28, 8 days after his application.
 os'F cIAL EXPLAINS CASE
 William J. Wyrsch, deputy director of the
 office of the Service in Newark, said the mat-
 ter had 'been handled in a routine manner.
 When asked how General Li had supported
 his wife and their son, See Sen (Jackson) Li,
 since they arrived on American soil Decem-
 ber 6, 1049, Mr. Wyrsch said the general had
 listed himself as a retired official of the Na-
 tionalist Government with a private income.
 Nlr.  Wyrsch explained that his office was
 not required to examine such matters more
 closely as long as the alien resident com-
 plied with all laws. The Li's had permanent
 residence here under the Refuge Relief Act
 of 1957.
 General Li came to the United States first
 for an abdominal operation.  When he left
 a New York hospital in 1950, the family
 moved to a spacious house at 4565 Delafied
 Avenue in the Fieldstone section of Riverdale
 in the Bronx.
 Neighbors recalled that the city police had
 maintained a sentry box with a man on duty
 outside the house 24 hours a day.  The Li's
 were remembered as an aloof couple in a com-
 munity in which distinguished foreigners
 are readily welcomed.
 A few years later the Li's moved to New
 Jersey.  The son, who according to friends
 served in the U.S. Army and is now an
 American citizen, was not active in the au-
 tobiographical project.  He Is living in River-
 dale with an older brother and is reported
 to have been completely surprised by his
 parents' return to China.

 SIXTEEN-YEAS               EXILE  RETURNS  TO  CHINESE
 FOLD
 (By Vergil Berger)
 PEIPING, July 20.-Gen. Li Tsung-jen, 74-
 year-old former Nationalist Chinese Acting
 President, returned to an emotional welcome
 here today after 16 years in exile, mostly in
 the United States.
 At the airport to greet General Li and his
 wife were Premier Chou En-lai, three vice
 premiers and several other top officials of the
 Communist regime, which ousted his Kuo-
 mintang government in 1949.
 Li said he was returning to "contribute my
 humble share to all efforts for the patriotic
 cause of opposing imperialism."
 He attacked the United States, accusing it
 of trying to dominate the world, and called
 on his Chinese friends abroad either to sup-
 port Communist China or to return here
 "for it is not yet too late to come back."
 (Li became vice president under Chiang
 Kai-shek in 1948, made an unsuccessful at-
 tempt to negotiate peace with the Commu-
 nists in 1949, and was acting president from
 January 1949, to February 1950, when Chiang
 withdrew his forces to Taiwan.)
 On his arrival by special plane Li ex-
 changed warm handshakes and greetings
 with the Communist leaders and former
 Kuomintang leaders who stayed on after the
 Communist takeover.
 Li also said the Chinese achievements un-
 der the Communist party, including the re-
 cent  successful  explosions  of  two  atom
 bombs, had "inspired great pride In every
 Chinese living abroad except a handful of
 diehards."
 [From the New York Times, July 22, 1965]
 TAIWAN PLAYS DowN Ex-AIDE's DEFECTION
 TArrEr, TAIWAN, July 21.-Nationalist China
 tried to take the defection of its former
 Acting President, Gen. Li Taung-jen, to Pei-
 ping In stride today.  Officials here are at-
 taching as little significance to the defection
 as possible.
 As one high-ranking official of the Kuo-
 mintang put it, "We are purposely play-
 tng this one down.    Why help the Chinese
 Communists with the propaganda barrage
 that is sure to follow?"
 All of Taipei's Chinese-language news-
 papers described the defection in a short
 news item on their inside pages.
 Most officials expressed the opinion that
 since General Li had been out of touch with
 Chinese affairs for so long, his defection
 would cause little stir among Chinese here
 and abroad.
 Nationalist China has always taken the
 position that he deserted it by going to the
 United States and remaining there for the
 last 16 years.
 It was also reported in the press here that
 General Li sent Mao Tse-tung, leader of Com-
 munist China, two boxes of paintings and
 scrolls a year ago and that in return Mr. Mao
 had sent him $100,000 through two agents
 who had sought to persuade him to return
 to China.

 HIGH                NATIONALIST DEFECTS  TO  PEIPING
 COMMUNISTS
 TOKYO.-Li Tsung-jen, who served 6 years
 as Vice President of Nationalist China and
 was its acting President for 1 year, threw in
 his lot with the Chinese Communists today.
 He fired a parting blast at the United States
 which had sheltered him since 1949.
 The New China News Agency said Li and
 his wife arrived by special plane at Peiping
 Airport.  They were greeted by Red Chinese
 Premier Chou En-lal and a delegation of 100
 high Communist officials.
 The 74-year-old former soldier-statesman
 was the most important Chinese to go over
 to the Reds since the Conununists drove
 Chiang Kai-shek from the mainland 16 years
 ago.
 Li reportedly left the United States July
 15 for Switzerland.  In a statement at the
 airport,  he called the United  States  our
 foreign enemy and accused it of "committing
 a series of sordid crimes against the people
 of China and of the world in an attempt to
 isolate China and dominate the world."
 DENOUNCES JOHNSON
 "Especially since Lyndon B. Johnson came
 to office," he continued, "the United States
 has stepped up its evil doings and expanded
 the war of aggression in Vietnam, even trying
 thereby to provoke a war against the Chi-
 nese people."
 Li had lived in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., for
 9 years.
 Li, whose defection has been rumored in
 Taipei and Hong Kong newspapers for a
 week, said he had made his choice because
 he had been impressed by Red China's two
 atom bomb tests and "the wise leadership"
 of Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-
 tung.
 "I hereby pledge to devotee the remaining
 years of my life to the service of my country,
 and may heaven and earth be witness to my
 sincerity," he said.
 OTHER MISTAKES CITED
 Appealing to his comrades in Chiang's
 Kuo-mintang Party to join him, Li described
 himself as an exile "with a guilty past." Be
 said he had always regretted failing to accept
 the Communist terms for "Internal peace"
 In China in 1949.
 He said his efforts during the first years
 of his self-exile to create a third force among
 the Chinese "added another mistake to my
 previous ones."
 Li said he had recently felt there were
 only two alternatives, either to side with the
 Communists "or to wallow in the mire with
 the reactionaries and be discarded along
 with them by the times."
 An army Commander by the time he was
 36, Li held key military posts for 20 years
 and served on China's National Military
 Council during World War II.  He was di-
 rector of Chiang's headquarters in Peiping
 from 1945 to 1949.
 He became Vice President in 1948 and held
 the title until 1954, although he spent the
 last 5 years of the term in the United States.
 When the Communists were on the verge
 of victory, Li and others clamored for peace
 negotiations.  Chiang abruptly resigned on
 January 21 and named Li acting President
 to give him a free hand in seeking a settle-
 ment.  Li got nowhere and after the main-
 land was overrun, Chiang resumed the Presi-
 dency on March 1, 1950, on Formosa.

 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, it is with
 much regret that I note the absence in
 this bill of any funding for section 108
 of the Housing and Urban Development

 has informed me that they recognize
 their responsibility for their personnel
 who are affected by closures at such in-

 and they also tell me that they support
 in principle the intent of section 108.
 However, they then proceed to imply

 that they simply do not have enough
 information at this time to advise the
 committee  as to  the appropriation
 needed.
 I submit, Mr. President, that all the
 sympathetic words on the part of the
 Defense Department will not replace the
 hundreds of dollars their employees are
 losing, on the sale of their homes.  Sec-
 retary McNamara has given us techni-
 cal objections instead of the humani-
 tarian approach, in view of the urgency
 of this situation.  Senator CLARK and I
 have worked diligently to protect the
 interests of our constituents at Olmsted,
 and It is with deep regret that we are
 now informed that the Defense Depart-
 ment refuses to act on our request.
 Originally, it was my intention to offer
 an amendment to the bill on the floor
 to fund section 108, but, in view of the
 committee's decision to await the De-
 fense Department's estimates, I shall
 defer any such action.  I do, however,
 call upon the Defense Department to sub-
 mit their estimates to the. Appropriations
 Committee at the outset of the second
 session of this Congress so that remedial
 action may be taken at that time.  I
 feel that it is the responsibility of our
 Government to insure that its employees
 are not subjected to extraordinary eco-
 nomic hardship through governmental
 action; in this case merely because the
 Department of Defense decides to shut
 down a Federal Installation.
 I' ask,' unanimous consent  to  have
 printed in the RECORD a letter dated
 August 17 from the Senator from Massa-
 chusetts [Mr. SALTONSTALLI in reference
 to that act.  I ask unanimous consent
 also that a statement of my colleague
 [Mr. CLARK] be, printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the letter
 and statement were ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:
 U.S. SENATE,
 COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS,
 August 17, 1965.
 Hon. HUGH SCOTT,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR HUGH: I was very much interested
 in Senator Clark's presentation before the
 Military  Construction  Subcommittee  last
 Tuesday for the immediate funding of the
 program authorized by section 108 of the
 Housing and Urban Development Act of
 1965.
 The committee considered the proposal
 and decided that the details had not been
 adequately worked out and it was difficult
 to assess the ultimate cost of the program.
 In the committee report it was pointed out
 that the Department of Defense may be pre-
 cluded from implementing section 108 dur-
 ing fiscal year 1966, in view of the provisions
 of section 406 of Public Law 85-241 as
 amended (42 U.S.C. 1594).  Section 406 with
 certain  specific  exceptions  prohibits  the
 construction or acquisition of family hous-
 ing units "at or in support of military in-
 stallations or activities" unless authorized
 by line items in an annual military construc-
 tion authorization act.                     The committee ex-
 pressed the opinion that the Department of
 Defense should make a study of, section 108.
 In my opinion it would be well to with-
 hold action until such time as the Depart-
 ment submits a thoroughly worked out plan
 to the Congress. I realize your deep interest
 in this matter and hope that something can
 be worked out next year.
 With kindest regards,
 Sincerely,
 LEVERETT SALTONSTALL,
 U.S. Senator.
 STATEMENT  OF                       SENATOR  JOSEPH  S.  CLARK,
 DEMOCRAT, OF PENNSYLVANIA, BEFORE THE
 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION SUBCOMMITTEE OF
 THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE
 -Mr. Chairman and members of the sub-
 committee, I am extremely grateful for this
 opportunity to appear before you.
 My purpose in testifying before you today
 is to urge the immediate funding of the
 program authorized by section 108 of the
 Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965,
 which has just been passed by the Congress.
 That program is designed to provide some
 badly needed financial relief to homeowners
 who lose their jabs as the result of the closing
 of a Federal base.  It was added to the bill
 as a result of the efforts of Senators SPARK-
 MAN, TOWER, and myself, and Representatives
 KUNKEL and BARRETT in the other body.
 . Although the need for such relief was made
 plain to me through the plight of my con-
 stituents in the Olmstead Air Force Base
 area, the problem is truly a national one.
 Similar hardships are being felt by or are in
 prospect for families in Mobile, Ala., and
 Waco and Amarillo, Tex.  The scenario is
 the same in each small community: an an-
 nouncement is made that the base will be
 closed;  hundreds  of  homes  are  suddenly
 placed on the market as people go elsewhere
 to find work; and the result is a sharp decline
 in real estate values.
 Consider the case of the homeowner who
 has just been told that his job is either being
 transferred or abolished.  More likely than
 not, his main financial asset is his house,
 bought at a time when the market was good,
 and  quite  probably  heavily  encumbered.
 Perhaps he is willing to accept a functional
 transfer,  which means  moving to a    new
 community.  Perhaps he would like to move
 to take a private job in some other part of
 the country.
 In either case, he will have to try to find
 a buyer for his house.  What he willprob-
 ably find instead is that his house has been
 turned from an asset Into an albatross over-
 night-because  of  the                                                                                          same  base  closing
 which cost him his job.
 The fact is that the simple economics of
 base closings extract a double penalty from
 the homeowner-employee. In a single stroke
 a shutdown order can rob him of the two
 things that are most precious to him: his
 livelihood and his savings.
 It was because of this need and this in-
 justice that we wrote section 108 Into the law.
 It provides in cases where a homeowner has
 lost his job as a result of a base closing and
 is unable to find a buyer willing to pay a
 reasonable price for his house, that the Sec-
 retary of Defense is authorized to buy the
 house at a price determined by consulting
 the market prior to the time the Department
 of Defense announced its intention to close
 the  base.   The properties thus acquired
 would than be turned over to the FHA for
 disposal.                        -
 There is nothing particularly novel about
 this idea.  It has been in use for some time
 by certain large corporations, notably IBM.
 And it provides a tested means for rectifying
 a serious Injustice and softening a severe
 financial blow.
 But this excellent program cannot do the
 people of Middletown, Pa., and Mobile, Ala.,
 20425
 and Waco, Tex., one iota of good unless and
 until it is funded.  For many, who are faced
 at this very moment with the need to sell
 their homes to seek new employment, justice
 delayed will literally be justice denied. And
 if the program should go unfunded this year,
 irremediable injury will be done to many
 Americans whose only crime was to lose their
 jobs as the result of a shutdown of a Federal
 installation.
 Accordingly, I hope that this subcommittee
 will seek the guidance of the Department of
 Defense in determining the size of the ap-
 propriation required to set this homeowner-
 relief program in operation now.  I urge the
 members of the subcommittee to include in
 the pending Military Construction Appro-
 priations bill the full amount needed to pro-
 vide this modicum of assistance to the many
 families whose lives have been disrupted by
 the closing of Federal Installations.
 Mr. STENNIS.  Mr. President, I sug-
 gest the absence of a quorum.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore.  The clerk will call the roll.
 The legislative clerk proceeded to call
 the roll.
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the order for the
 quorum call be rescinded.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore. Without objection, it is so ordered.
 FORTY-FIFTH   ANNIVERSARY  OF
 SERVICE OF MARK TRICE IN THE
 SENATE
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  Mr. President, yester-
 day we paid tribute to the distinguished
 secretary of the minority, Mr. Mark
 Trice.  Quite a number of speeches were
 made on the floor of the Senate, and
 other Senators would like to insert
 speeches in the RECORD.
 I therefore make the following request
 for myself and for the distinguished ma-
 jority leader:
 First, that all Senators may have 10
 days in which to insert speeches in the
 RECORD with reference to Mark Trice;
 Second, that those speeches be gath-
 ered and published as a Senate docu-
 ment.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore.                                                                                              Is there objection?  The Chair
 hears none, and it is so ordered.
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  Yesterday there was
 a soiree, so to speak, in tribute to Mark
 Trice, and at that time he was presented
 with a gift.  I thought it was an in-
 teresting gift, since Mark had been in
 the service of the Senate for 45 years.
 I could think of nothing quite so suit-
 able as supplying him with a large wall
 electric  timepiece  which,  instead  of
 moving forward like a clock, moves back-
 ward and, therefore, rolls back time.                                                                                                   In
 connection with that presentation, I took
 the liberty to offer a few quotations
 from a poem by Elizabeth Akers.
 I ask unanimous consent to have the
 quotations made a part of my remarks
 so that they may also be included In the
 document in which the speeches are to
 be assembled.
 There being no objection, the poem
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE         August 20, 1965
 ROCK ME TO  SLEEP
 Backward, turn backward, 0 Time, in your
 flight,
 Make me a child again just for tonight.
 Mother, come back from the echoless shore,
 Take me again to your heart as of yore;
 K*.ss from my forehead the furrows of care,
 Smooth the few silver threads out of my
 hair;
 Over my slumbers your loving watch keep-
 Rock me to sleep, mother-rock me to sleep.
 Backward, flow backward, O tide of the
 years.
 I am so weary of toil and of tears-
 Toil without recompense, tears all in vain-
 Take them and give me my childhood again.
 I have grown weary of dust and decay,
 Weary of flinging my soul wealth away,
 Weary of sowing for others to reap-
 Rock me to sleep, mother-rock me to sleep.
 -ELI7.AaETi3 AKERS.
 Mr. PROUTY.                       Mr. President, Mark
 Trice has been a part of the Senate for
 45 years.  He is much too young to be
 termed an institution, but one can say
 in. all honesty that he is a tradition.
 That tradition embodies respect for his
 fellow man, a willingness to counsel when
 counsel is needed, and simply a readi-
 ness to lift your spirits up when every-
 thing else is getting you down.
 In defining a gentleman, Cardinal
 Newman once said that "it is almost
 enough to say that a gentleman is one
 who never inflicts pain."
 Yes, Mark Trice is a gentleman in
 that spirit, but that does not say it all.
 As he would refrain from inflicting
 pain. on any one, so too would he sacri-
 fice his own comfort if it would bring an
 iota of happiness to another.
 On his 45th anniversary of service in
 the Senate-we salute Mark as an ad-
 viser, as a gentleman, but above all-
 as a friend.
 Mr. BENNETT.  Mr. President, some-
 body described the perfect staff man as
 one "with a passion for anonymity."
 When you add to that characteristic an
 equal passion for complete and equal-
 handed unselfish service, you are just
 beginning to describe Mark Trice.  It
 did not take him 45 years to learn to an-
 ticipate the differing needs and problems
 of Senators with wide differences in ex-
 perience, seniority, and personality. To
 each he conveys the impression that that
 man's problems are just a little more im-
 portant than usual and for each he has
 just the right suggestions. I am sure of
 this because ever since I came to the
 Senate as a freshman I have been the
 recipient of many special services and
 kindnesses.
 I am sure the Senate is a stronger and
 more effective legislative body because
 Mark Trice has `for so long been one of
 its unseen buttresses.
 Mr. JORDAN of Idaho.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, in spite of the fact that I have not
 been a Member of this body nearly so
 long as some, I do feel qualified to give
 testimony to the full measure of dedica-
 tion and devotion to duty that has
 marked the 45 years of service of Mark
 Trice at the Capitol.
 Coming to the Senate as I did in the
 latter portion of a session, I quickly real-
 ized               the necessity of having reliable
 information not only on the issues at
 hand, but also information on Senate
 procedures and operation. My colleagues
 quickly referred me to the secretary of
 the minority, Mark Trice.  This was
 sound guidance. I received the informa-
 tion I needed and Mark Trice more than
 once kept the junior Senator from Idaho
 from blundering astray.  Furthermore,
 Mr. Trice began at once to provide me
 the education needed by a new Senator.
 Now, one would expect the secretary
 to the Senate minority to guide new Sen-
 ators of the minority side of the aisle.
 But the manner and way this aid is given
 is what puts Mark Trice in a class by
 himself.  He never takes advantage of
 his position.  He is devoted to helping
 Senators perform their senatorial duties
 in the best way. And above all, certainly
 not the least of Mark Trice's commenda-
 ble traits is his integrity. He is friendly,
 amiable, unobstrusive, and yet Mark
 Trice commands the respect of all who
 work with him regardless of which side
 of the aisle they may have a seat in the
 Senate Chambers.
 Whether one is the most junior Mem-
 ber of the Senate or the most senior
 Member, all can seek and get valuable
 advice and assistance from Mark Trice.
 Those who receive this advice can always
 be assured that it will be given in the
 best interests of both the individual and
 the effective, responsible operation of the
 Senate.
 Mr. President, as a member of the Re-
 publican team in the Senate, I am grate-
 ful. to Mark Trice for his devoted service
 in the past 45 years.  I wish him well
 and congratulate him as he begins his
 46th year in the Senate. I am privileged
 to have him as my friend.
 Mr. MILLER.  Mr. President, today is
 the 45th anniversary of service to the
 Senate of J. Mark Trice, secretary to the
 minority.
 Such a period of service seems almost
 unbelievable when one considers the
 comparative youthful appearance of this
 fine public servant, and I suspect that
 his wonderful wife, Margaret, has had a
 great deal to do with it.
 The secretary to the minority comes
 about as close to being a Republican
 Senator as one can without actually
 being one.  He probably spends more
 time on the Senate floor than any of us,
 and his knowledge of pending legislation
 and parliamentary procedure is invalu-
 able in enabling the regular Senate
 Members to be informed at all times,
 merely by calling the floor, while we are
 necessarily in committee meetings or in
 our offices.
 I have, in my 5 years here, found Mark
 Trice a source of friendly, wise counsel-
 always cheerful, always helpful, and al-
 ways with the highest sense of dedica-
 tion to the Senate and its Members.
 I join with my colleagues in heartiest
 congratulations to Mark and Margaret.
 We are most proud of you, and you have
 our deepest affection.
 Mr. YOUNG of North Dakota.  Mr.
 President, I wish to join my colleagues
 in congratulating Mark Trice on his 45
 years of service in the Senate.
 Starting as a page, Mark has practi-
 cally grown up with the Senate. During
 the more than 20 years I have been asso-
 ciated with him, I have found him to be
 one of the most dedicated, able, and per-
 sonable public servants I have ever
 known.  He handles a very difficult job
 in a most commendable way. Not many
 could serve so well. His 45 ;years of con-
 tinuous service in itself speaks better
 than words of the esteem and respect in
 which he is held by all of the Members
 of the Senate.
 I treasure his friendship and express
 the fond hope that he will be serving the
 U.S. Senate for many, many years to
 come.
 Mr. COOPER.  Mr. President, today,
 I would speak of Mark Trice, and of his
 courtesy and, his helpfulness.  We ap-
 preciate these qualities, but to me the
 outstanding characteristics which have
 attended Mark Trice have been his
 steadiness, his correctness, his sense of
 duty, and his respect and loyalty for the
 Senate as an institution of our Govern-
 ment and of our country.  Mark Trice
 has served both his party and the Senate
 of the United States faithfully and hon-
 orably, and we honor him for this service.

 IMPRESSIEWS OF THE WAR IN
 VIETNAM
 Mr. BAYH.                    Mr. President, it is dif-
 ficult for the average American to vis-
 ualize and understand the kind of life
 faced by our Armed Forces in Vietnam.
 During periods of hostility most of us are
 dependent upon the perceptive powers
 and accuracy of those writers who are
 privileged to live with troops in the field
 for our knowledge of their everyday ex-
 periences and sacrifices.
 Recently a young information special-
 ist, Pfc. Richard A. Busse, of Gary, Ind.,
 wrote an excellent article depicting in
 clear yet moving terms some GI reactions
 to the problems and tribulations con-
 fronting our men in Vietnam.  This fine
 analysis is much in the tradition of
 Ernie Pyle, our famous Hoosier reporter
 of World War II.  Because indirectly it
 will help citizens at home comprehend
 in a limited way the thoughts and feel-
 ings of those now serving in Vietnam, I
 ask unanimous consent that this article,
 which appeared in the Gary Post-Trib-
 une for July 21, 1965, be printed at this
 point in my remarks.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 GARY MAN  AT SCENE TELLS How WAR HITS
 VIETNAMESE
 (EDITOR's NoTE.-Pfc. Richard A. Busse, son
 of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Busse, 4722 Grant
 Street, is an information specialist in Viet-
 nam.  He is a 1968 graduate of Calumet
 Township High School and a 1962 graduate of
 Northwestern University.  Busse is in the
 last year of a 3-year enlistment in the Army.
 Previous to duty in Vietnam he was stationed
 in Korea.  Busse is a reporter of service news
 in Vietnam and has also had articles printed
 in the Saigon Daily News. In this article he
 gives his first impressions of Vietnam, its
 people, and the GI's who have come there to
 aid in the fight for freedom.)
 . (By Richard A. Busse)
 A child is crying.  Its bandaged limbs hurt,
 The stretcher on which medics have placed it
 is not its own bed.  It asks for its mother
 and father, but they are dead, in the charred
 skeleton of a village sacked and burned by
 Vietcong guerrillas trained by agents of Com-
 munist He Chi-minh.
 No one can yet determine whether the
 shock of the terror the child saw will leave
 it as scarred within for the rest of its life
 as it is without.  But the chances are it will.
 At this moment a magic contrast to the
 violence it experienced adds to the child's
 confusion.   Gentle  hands from  far away
 bring it foods comfort, mercy.   They heal,
 and the strangers' soft voices, speaking a
 language  it  cannot  comprehend,  sound
 understanding.
 The child's people were not warlike.  On
 the contrary, they were traditionally wor-
 shippers of "the peaceful" and "the tran-
 quil."                                                                          They were unskilled in methods of
 self-defense,   But  peaceful  men  of such
 intensity who toil all day long to plant and
 harvest rice on the land of their fathers,
 grandfathers, and ancestors, do not have time
 to build walls against countrymen they do
 not know are their enemies.
 They tried to defend themselves when the
 truth broke upon them, using desperation
 against an enemy more skilled at guerrilla
 warfare than the best armies in the world.
 There was no reason to the slaughter the
 child saw, just cunning insanity.  To end it,
 the survivors would have to learn how to go
 out and destroy it, or forever live at the point
 of its sword.  But someone would have to
 teach them how, because peaceful natures
 cannot be changed overnight.
 Until then there would be more lonely
 aftermaths like this one, and more futile
 emotion; the anguish of more children left
 without their parents, and bewildered dogs
 rummaging through garbage.
 While Gray works, plays, and sleeps, the
 sound of mortar and artillery never ceases to
 come from west of Saigon.  Every night it
 grumbles  dully,  sometimes  shaking  the
 ground, compelling many of the new men
 just in from the States, Korea, Okinawa, and
 other bases throughout the Pacific, to lie
 awake, staring into the darkness of their
 tents, asking themselves * * * _"what about
 tomorrow * * * what will tomorrow be?"
 They live in a reception station, a tent,
 city growing every day to handle more and
 more incoming troops.
 Many here await transportation to duty
 stations all over Vietnam: outposts like Da
 Nang, Pleiku, and Vung Tau; Soc Trang,
 Dalat, and Bien Hoa; Due Hoa, Due My, and
 Phu Lam; Vinh Long, Song Be, Dong Xoal,
 Binh Gia, and many many more.
 Listen for these names.  Try to remember
 them.  As time goes by they will become as
 familiar to the Americans in the fields and
 towns of Indiana who inform themselves as
 they are now to the Americans who man the
 outposts in the fields of South Vietnam.
 These  names sound  strange  today,  as
 strange as the names of battlegrounds dur-
 ing World War II and Korea did to the gen-
 erations who made them immortal.
 Whether he is in a tent-city reception sta-
 tion, an outpost at night under attack by
 insurgent guerrillas, or in a rear area fighting
 a lonely battle against time or concern over
 personal problems at home, the GI does not
 take it entirely for granted that every Ameri-
 can agrees with his being here.
 Neither does the marine on patrol in the
 jungles around Da Nang, or the sailor in
 hostile' waters far off shore in the South
 China Sea, or the airman whose plane is hit
 and in trouble somewhere over North Viet-
 nam.
 It's a "helluva" way to have to go through
 a day over here, knowing that.  But he fig-
 ures the dissenting opinions in situations
 like this always point up the difference be-
 tween being near something and far away
 from it; between judging something from a
 distance and being involved in it up to your
 neck.
 Some men receive their hometown papers.
 Some have access to popular stateside mag-
 azines on current events.  Some can tune
 in on honest appraisals of the news from
 Washington over the Armed Forces Radio
 Service.  Democracy provides freedom of in-
 formation and he makes use of it.
 He reads about mothers back home asking
 "Why must mothers mourn?"
 No, he feels, it's not a crime for mothers
 to ask if their son's participation in the war
 in Vietnam is a necessary thing.  They should
 ask if only because it is a way of life with
 us to hold the value of the individual human
 soul above all else, especially when that soul
 is a son's.
 But he feels it is a woman's question in a
 man's world.  He feels that fathers who have
 fought on foreign soil understand his situa-
 tion only too well.  There is a certain com-
 mon chemistry about sons who wear their
 country's uniform. There is only one age
 among them -* * * the age of duty.
 Harassing fire  continues  in  the night.
 Enemies probe for each other. Single bursts
 boom across the horizon, then whole volleys.
 Sometimes flares drift down on parachutes,
 lighting the sky and the earth below when
 friendly forces want to see what the Vietcong
 are up to.  At night the Vietcong is in his
 element.   The flares burn with a dazzling
 golden light and leave erratic trails of white-
 looking smoke.
 Tent city is judged a relatively safe place
 by the men who live there, because it hasn't
 been hit by the Vietcong yet.
 Some men sit alone in the darkened tents,
 writing letters home by flashlight.  Others
 worry about why none have been coming
 from home.  GI's bless the balmy sea breeze
 embracing the land at night, tolerate the
 monsoon rains.which come at all hours, and
 curse the torrid heat of the day.
 They have done their details.  They have
 filled  sandbags  for  bunker  construction,
 painted  latrines,  dug  a  few ditches, and
 policed  the  compound,   And  they  have
 sweated.    Some now walk guard. Most of the
 guards are privates, and most of the privates
 are kids on their first time away from home
 and families. But they're doing all right.
 Some men lie on their bunks, staring into
 the darkness, listening to the sound of war
 rumbling distantly.  Perhaps the outpost he
 will be going to lies in that direction.  Yet
 he knows directions make no difference be-
 cause the war is all around.  There are no
 lines, no fronts, no thoroughly safe rear
 areas anywhere.  The guerrilla can hit any-
 where, sometimes singly by planting a bomb
 or throwing a grenade, or he may come in
 small groups, or in platoon, company, or
 battalion strength. Worrying about it is use-
 less.  But nobody loses sight of the fact that
 it could happen.  It's really all a matter of
 chance.
 It is a different kind of war, the kind he
 read about in the magazines before he got
 here; the unorthodox new tactics, the new
 weapons and new usages for old weapons,
 the sneak hit-and-run attacks the ambush,
 the terrorist raids, and the Vietcong-Viet-
 namese Communist-"VC" in f*I jargon.
 But the American soldier is resilient.  No
 matter where he is he brings a part of Amer-
 ica with him.  It is alive in his laughter, his
 wit, and his love of life and freedom.
 They ask questions amongst themselves,
 trying to put a picture together of their new
 situation, as they smoke outside their tents.
 They discuss all the rumors they've heard
 since arriving.  They speculate on what the
 duty will be like where they are going.  Some
 men's orders have been changed since ar-
 riving.  They're going to a place they haven't
 looked up on a map yet.
 "Hey, where's Phu Bai?"
 "Anybody know where Ban Me Thuot Is?"
 Nobody ever gets the pronunciations right,
 but after a while everybody gets to under-
 stand.

 to turn to a number of others. First of all,
 will you follow in your Bible as we consider
 Isaiah 65: 19.
 "And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy
 in my people: and the voice of weeping shall
 be no more heard in her, nor the voice of
 crying.
 "There shall be no more thence an infant
 of days, nor an old man that bath not filled
 his days: for the child shall die an hundred
 years old; but the sinner being an hundred
 years old shall be accursed.
 "And they shall build houses, and inhabit
 them; and they shall plant vineyards, and
 eat the fruit of them.
 "They shall not build, and another in-
 habit;  they shall not plant, and another
 eat:  for as the days of a tree are the days
 of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy
 the work of their hands.
 "They shall not labor in vain, nor bring
 forth for trouble; for they are the seed of
 the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring
 with them" (Isaiah 65: 19-23).
 This is an exceedingly rich passage of
 Scripture, and we suggest that you study
 it for your own private devotion.  There are
 several things to be noted which, as the con-
 text will clearly show, are a description of
 the conditions that will exist in this world
 during that coming golden age, centering in
 the city of Jerusalem, the world capital in
 that wonderful day when Jesus reigns upon
 the throne of David.
 First of all, will you notice that the Lord
 promises that In this wonderful age, which
 we believe lies in the not-too-distant future,
 sorrow and weeping and crying will be for-
 ever banished.  The Lord will remove those
 things which are causing the sorrows of this
 world today. Satan, of course, will be bound
 during that age, and cast into the bottom-
 less pit.  All men will at least nominally
 profess to know the Lord Jesus and bow the
 knee to Him,  to that sorrow and troubles
 and trials which beset us today will be ut-
 terly unknown when Jesus reigns upon the
 throne in Jerusalem.  Then will you notice,
 in the second place, that this passage also
 teaches that life will be greatly prolonged
 during the millennial age.
 "There shall be no more thence an in-
 fant of days, nor an old man that bath not
 filled his days: for the child shall die an
 hundred years old" (Isaiah 65: 20).
 From this interesting passage we And that
 life will be so tremendously lengthened that
 a child will not mature until he is at least
 a hundred years old. All the processes of life
 will be slowed up, so that a child will remain
 a child for an entire century.  As a result,
 since a child is not responsible until he has
 come to the years of accountability and this
 age of accountability will not be reached in
 the millennium until after a century of life
 here upon the earth, there can be no infant
 death of any kind.  No one will die during
 the miIliennium. under 100 years old, because
 the only cause of death will be open, deliber-
 ate, presumptuous rebellion against the King.
 The Minimum span of life will be 100 years,
 and only after the child has reached a hun-
 dred years, and the age of responsibility and
 accountability, will it be possible for it to
 (tie, and then, as we have stated, only in case
 of open rebellion against the King, the Lord
 Jesus.  So that we read further: "? * * the
 sinner being an hundred years old shall be
 accursed" (Isaiah 65: 20).
 in the 22d verse of this same chapter we
 read: "' *  * as the days of a tree are the
 days of my people, and mine elect shall long
 enjoy the work of their hands" (Isaiah Si:
 22).
 Since a thousand years is with the Lord as
 I day, and I day is as a thousand years, we
 can understand these statements.  You will
 recall that God said to Adam in the Garden,
 "The day thou eateat thereof thou shalt
 surely die."  Since a thousand years is as 1
 day with the Lord, God told Adam that he
 because of sin could not live out the span of
 1,000 years upon the earth, which is equal to
 one of God's days; and as a result Adam and
 all other antediluvians died before they ever
 reached the age of 1,000 years.  But at the
 coming of Christ and the setting up of the
 Kingdom, the curse will be removed, and
 then men will live out the full day of God,
 !,000 blessed years.
 Sickness will be unknown
 We said a moment ago that the only cause
 of death in the millennium will be a result
 of the immediate judgment of God upon
 open rebellion of sinners.  We are further
 told in the Scriptures that sickness will be
 unknown during this blessed age of Christ's
 reign upon the earth. In Isaiah 35, we read:
 "Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened,
 and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
 "Then shall the lame man leap as an hart,
 and the tongue of the dumb sing" (Isaiah
 35: 5.6).
 If you will notice carefully the context of
 this passage, especially the 34th chapter, you
 will notice that the time referred to is the
 time of Christ's return and the setting up
 of His Kingdom here upon the earth.  All
 sickness,  therefore, will  be banished. In
 Isaiah 33: 24, we read this:
 "And the inhabitant shall not say, I am
 sick: the people that dwell therein shall be
 forgiven their iniquity" (Isaiah 33: 24).
 I realize that it is exceedingly difficult for
 us to imagine this in an age of sorrow and
 sickness, suffering and death, on every hand;
 however, there will be a period of 1,000 years
 when there will be no hospitals, no clinics,
 no ambulances screaming down our streets,
 for there will be no sickness and no disease.
 According to the Word of God, there will be
 only the  occasional  funeral  service  when
 someone who has openly rebelled against the
 King of Kings will suffer the immediate
 judgment of Almighty God.
 No more poverty
 The next thing we are told In this won-
 derful passage concerning the Millennium is
 that poverty and want shall be abolished for-
 ever and ever. Inequality among people will
 be wiped out, and there will be that common
 blessing  of  Almighty  God  upon  all.   In
 Isaiah 65 we read once again:
 "And they shall build houses, and inhabit
 them; and they shall plant vineyards, and
 eat the fruit of them.
 "They shall not build, and another in-
 habit;  they shall not plant, and another
 eat" (Isaiah 65: 21, 22).
 Everyone will be self-employed, and shall
 enjoy the full fruitage of his own labor. The
 prophet Micah tells us: "But they shall sit
 every man under his vine and under his fig
 tree" (Micah 4: 4).
 Every single inhabitant of the world in
 that age will be independent, own his own
 property and his own home, and provide for
 his own family in abundance.  There will be
 no want, there will be no hunger, there will
 be no thirsting, there will be no problem of
 distribution, there will be no famine of any
 kind, but all will have enough, and all shall
 be satisfied.
 The Bible tells us also that in this wonder-
 ful age, all of the religious controversy and
 strife and difference of opinion which has be-
 come such a reproach shall be forever ended.
 There will not be a large number of religions
 all contending one with another, but in-
 stead one great world religion will be the re-
 sult.                                                                    In Micah 4 we read concerning the
 worship in this wonderful age:
 "And many nations shall come, and say,
 Come, and let us go up to the mountain of
 the Lord, and to the house of the God of
 Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and
 we will walk in his paths: for the law shall
 go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord
 from Jerusalem" (Micah 4:2).
 In this same vein we read the following in
 Jeremiah 31: 34:
 "And they shall teach no more every man
 his neighbour, and every man his brother,
 saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all
 know me, from the least of them unto the
 greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will
 forgive their iniquity, and I will remember
 their sin no more" (Jeremiah 31: 34).
 The Apostle Paul writing in the New Testa-
 ment also speaks of this coming day, when
 all of the divisions, not only of Christianity.
 but all religions will be forever past, and all
 men shall be worshipers of the Lord Jesus, at
 least in outward profession.  Paul tells us
 that the day is coming, when "at the name
 of Jesus every knee should bow, of things In
 heaven, and things in earth, and things under
 the earth;
 "And that every tongue should confess
 that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of
 God the Father" (Philippians 2:10, 11).
 We have already touched upon the fact
 that during this age there will be universal
 peace.  There will be no military training
 camps, no war plailes, no battleships, no hos-
 tile submarine activity, there will not even
 be any munitions factories, for in that day
 they shall "beat their swords into plowshares,
 and their spears into pruninghooks: nation
 shall not rise up against nation, neither shall
 they learn war any more."  Time would ut-
 terly fall us to quote passage after passage
 from Scripture, all of them with one accord
 and without contradiction speaking of that
 glorious age for which every true child of
 God must be looking.
 Truly as we look upon conditions in the
 world today, if we did not have this hope
 of Christ's returning, and we had to rely
 upon the power of the church, and the testi-
 mony of Christians to bring about the cessa-
 tion of hostilities and to bring In perfect
 righteousness, I for one would despair and
 give up hope entirely. Personally, if I did not
 believe in the Imminent, personal return of
 the Lord Jesus to make right that which is
 all wrong in this world today, and to bring
 in the peace for which man has so long been
 sighing, and for which he has so long been
 looking, I don't think I would care to preach
 another sermon. I would have to admit that
 the whole thing is a failure, and that the
 Gospel has not accomplished that which we
 had expected, and that Christianity is noth-
 ing else but another religion, and a tremen-
 dous farce.
 But, glory be to God, we have this assur-
 ance, we who know His program, that He who
 said Its would come, will come, and will not
 tarry.  His last promise which He left with
 His disciples was "I am coming again."  The
 last promise of the Bible Is:
 "He which testifieth these things saith,
 Surely I come quickly" (Revelation 22:20).
 So we can praise God that in the midst of
 all the darkening clouds of impending judg-
 ment and the ominous shadows of dark days
 ahead, when men's hearts are failing them
 for fear of things which are coming to pass
 upon the earth, we can still believe for our-
 selves that everything is going to be all right,
 that God is still on the throne, His program
 is being carried out in this world, and that
 soon He will come and take away the veil,
 and explain all that which today remains
 a mystery to us.  We are not only happy
 that we can believe this for ourselves, and re-
 joice in. the comfort which it brings to our
 own hearts, but we do thank God for the
 blessed privilege and opportunity of being
 able to bring it to others, to broadcast this
 message to a lost world, the message of hope
 and cheer which the world needs so much
 today.
 What a glorious, wonderful message it is to
 bring to a world which today is floundering

 girl, the gang he ran around with on the
 block, and the good life a million miles away.
 This is a GI's heritage a script he doesn't
 realize  he ' knows  already,  handed down
 through this century from generations of
 Americans who spent nights in tents like
 this on battlefields all over the world.
 His buddy doesn't answer, and he wonders
 how a guy can sleep so hard so fast.
 The American soldier in tent city is im-
 patient to get going.  He is perpetually tired
 of standing in lines and waiting for things.
 Nothing will satisfy him more, aside from
 going home, than to get to his new unit where
 he can begin the countdown of days until
 his 12-month tour is over and he can go
 home, to his folks, his car, and his girl, and
 the good life again.
 Other men, the college age men, look for-
 ward to home and school, many of them.
 Older men, lifers in the service, look for-
 ward to getting back to the wives and chil-
 dren they had to leave behind.
 Nothing in the Army will be good enough
 for the GI until then.  But that's good.  It
 gives a man something to fight for.
 The GI can be cynical, gross, and irrever-
 ent.             He can also be profound, reverent,
 and proud; comic, outspoken, and patriotic.
 He would probably never be able to adjust
 in another army where men are disciplined
 more for speaking out, because he is an
 American and these personal liberties are
 also a way of life.  He has always been so.
 He will put down the cocky youngster
 who thinks the world owes him an apology
 for throwing a curve into his life-like Viet-
 nam.             Yet he and the same kid will carry
 each other home the next night after a few
 beers.  He will go out of his way to com-
 municate with the local ladies, and he'll
 play with the throngs of children who gather
 around the compound to chase bugs in the
 glare   of  the  floodlights,  to  say  "hello"
 (every one of them), to ask "shine shoes?"
 and generally to gawk at the "big eyes" from
 far away.
 He likes children.  He can't turn his back
 on one; the spunky, rugged little Vietnamese
 boys who want to punch, wrestle around,
 and try out their karate, and the delicate,
 very femimine, and very lovely little Viet-
 namese girls with the beautiful long black
 hair who stand aside shyly; the little pee-
 wee who comes toddling up without his
 pants to be with bigger boys, or the hungry
 little kid who comes up and asks for a
 nickel.
 He works magic with these children.  It's
 called a smile, a stick of gum, a small candy
 bar, and a big heart.
 There is an undercurrent around which
 tells him almost instinctively that this land
 is witnessing a showdown between an ide-
 -ology like his, which cherishes the value of
 the individual human soul, like the souls
 of these children, and the dogma which
 places far greater value on the individual's
 back, a value like the Vietcong's brand of
 communism.
 He still has a lot to learn about personal
 diplomacy with people whose ways of life
 are different from his own, and that, when
 walking down a sidewalk in another man's
 land, it is often a sign of great humility to
 allow that man the center of the sidewalk.
 But he is learning * * * every day.
 He cannot be certain of the future, but
 he is determined to have one.  And many
 GI's, more than some Americans not here
 can ever know first hand, are determined
 that these Vietnamese kids and their fami-
 lies will have a future, too.
 He is apprehensive of that moment when
 the burden of battle may be dropped on his
 shoulders for the first time; when the qual-
 ities of mercy and charity, ingrained in him
 since childhood might have to be shoved
 aside if it becomes necessary to kill a man.
 Others will have no compunctions about
 pulling the trigger on a Vietcong.
 He senses that the character of war and
 the rumble of distant conflict remain con-
 stant in their honesty.  They are what they
 appear to be and nothing more or less. They
 seek not to impress because they are not
 living things of flesh and blood, like men.
 But they do impress, the first time, and last-
 ingly, for neither souls nor consciences have
 been built into them, or the power to deceive.
 What they are they make no excuses for.
 Neither  do  they  repent.   They  know  no
 better, and there is no hope of their ever
 being taught or learning differently.
 This is why no man can forget them who
 has over associated himself with them or
 experienced the havoc they wreak.
 Nobody  ever  guaranteed that living  or
 dying In this century would be easy. It's
 natural that a heavy burden should tire a
 man's shoulders, even a great nation's shoul-
 ders.  But it is how well a man or nation
 carries its burdens that bespeaks its char-
 acter.  And here in the embattled republic,
 humanity calls.
 To the American soldier who will have
 served here, died here, and survived here,
 it will have sounded eternally profane for
 the secure at home to have said, "you men
 were wrong and your ordeal in vain."
 Let the man guard his words who has not
 been here, who has not seen, and felt, and
 known this war.
 Let us ever guard his right to dissent.  But
 one Sunday in the church of his choice may
 he instead ask God to grant the Americans
 here and to those to come, the South Viet-
 namese soldier in battle for his Republic,
 and the Allies here to help him, one fair
 request:
 "The serenity to accept the things they
 cannot change here;
 The courage to change the things they can;
 And the wisdom to know the difference."
 MARITIME RESTRICTION PREVENTS
 AMERICAN WHEAT SALES
 Mr. McGOVERN.  Mr. President, the
 regrettable shipping restriction which
 makes it impossible for the United States
 to sell- wheat to Russia and Eastern Eu-
 rope cannot be defended on any rational
 ground.  The unfortunate aspects of
 such restriction is further underscored in
 an excellent editorial published in the
 Chicago Daily News of August 13, 1965.
 I ask unanimous consent that the edi-
 torial may be printed at this point in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Chicago (Ill.)  Daily News, Aug.
 13, 1965]
 RUSSIA TURNS WEST FOR WHEAT
 Russia                             has  plunged  into  the  Western
 wheat market in a big way with orders for
 214 million bushels from Canada to cost
 $450 million.                           The purchase reflects another
 bad harvest in the Soviet Union and raises a
 strong possibility that Russia will once more
 seek a deal to buy grain from the United
 States.
 U.S. wheat sales to Russia lack the sim-
 plicity of the Canadian approach.  To Cana-
 dians, business is business, and if Russia,
 Red China, or any other Communist country
 has the money, Canada will sell. Here the
 grain business gets intertwined with domes-
 tic and international politics and prejudice
 until the strands are lost.
 Already, forces are, being marshalled in
 Washington to block any wheat sales to
 Communist countries.  This despite the ex-
 perience of 2 years ago, when Russia bought
 $145 million worth of wheat in the United
 States without undermining the Statue of
 Liberty.
 U.S. stores of surplus wheat have declined
 a bit in recent years, to -a current 12-year
 low.  But there were still 819 million bushels
 in the bins as of July 1, being stored at a
 massive cost to the taxpayer and otherwise
 contributing to the insoluble farm problem.
 An opportunity to sell some of this surplus
 on the world market ought not to be lightly
 dismissed.
 Much of our surplus grain goes to coun-
 tries that can pay only in soft, local curren-
 cies, which means the sale is virtually a gift.
 Russia pays in hard currencies on the inter-
 national market, which is no small consider-
 ation in view of our precarious balance-of-
 payments situation.
 There are, of course, ample reasons for
 caution in trading with the Soviets that do
 not arise in trade with our allies.  It would
 be foolhardy, for example, to extend long-
 term credits to Russia and thereby help build
 up an economy that is in threatening compe-
 tition with our own.
 But we find no merit in the emotional
 argument  that  selling  Russia  subsidized
 wheat constitutes an American subsidy to
 Russia.  It is the American farmer and ex-
 porter who benefit from the subsidy, not the
 nation that buys grain at the world market
 price.  And if we block sales of grain to Rus-
 sia, there is nothing to prevent middleman
 nations from buying our grain at the world
 price and reaping a profit from selling flour
 to Russia.                                   -
 Nor should we overlook the propaganda
 value in the simple fact that the Commu-
 nist nations turn to the West when they
 need wheat.  Nothing they could do would
 better illustrate the basic point we are try-
 ing                                                                                                                              to  make:  Our  system  works;  theirs
 doesn't.

 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
 Mr. HARRIS.  Mr. President, the Con-
 gress needs to maintain Government-
 wide oversight and review of the research
 and development being financed by the
 Federal Government. The distinguished
 Senator from Arkansas [Mr MCCLEL-
 LAN] has long recognized that need and
 has himself done significant and valuable
 work toward that end in his capacity as
 chairman of the oversight committee of
 the Senate, the Government Operations
 Committee, on which I am honored to
 serve.  I am greatly pleased that our
 distinguished chairman [Mr. MCCLEL-
 LAN] has created a special Subcommittee
 on Government Research in the Senate
 Government Operations Committee, and
 has appointed me to chair it.
 With the help of the able and hard-
 working Senators who have been ap-
 pointed as members of this subcommit-
 tee, we will do our best to carry out the
 job our distinguished chairman has given
 us.
 Mr. President, to further explain the
 subcommittee's work and scope of oper-
 ations, I ask unanimous consent that a
 statement by the distinguished Senator
 from Arkansas [Mr. MCCLELLAN], dated
 August 20, 1965, and a statement which
 I made on the same date, be inserted in
 the RECORD at this point.

 There being no objection, the state-

 RECORD, as follows:
 STATEMENT BY SENATOR JOHN L. MCCLELLAN,
 CHAIRMAN,  COMMITTEE  ON  GOVERNMENT
 OPERATIONS, AUGUST 20, 1965
 Senator JOHN MCCLELLAN announced to-
 day that he has appointed a Special Sub-
 committee on Government Research of the
 Committee on Government Operations, to be
 composed of Senators  FRED  R.  HARRIS,  of
 Oklahoma,    as    chairman,    MCCLELLAN,
 ABRAHAM  RIRICOFF,  JOSEPH  M.  MONTOYA,
 KARL E. MUNDT, and MILWARD L. SIMpsoN.
 The subcommittee will be authorized and
 directed to undertake intensive studies, in-
 cluding hearings as may be necessary, into
 the operations of research and development
 programs financed by departments and agen-
 cies of the Federal Government. The studies
 will include research in such fields as eco-
 nomics and social science, as well as basic
 science, research and technology.  Special
 emphasis will be placed on those programs
 now being carried out through contracts
 with higher educational Institutions and
 private organizations, corporations and in-
 dividuals, to determine the need for the
 establishment of national research, develop-
 ment and manpower policies and programs,
 in order to bring about government-wide
 coordination and elimination of overlapping
 and duplication of scientific and research
 activities.
 The subcommittee will be further directed
 to examine existing research information
 operations, the impact of Federal research
 and development programs on institutions
 of higher learning, and to recommend the
 establishment of programs to insure equit-
 able distribution of research and develop-
 ment contracts among such institutions and
 other contractors.
 The staff of the full Committee on Govern-
 ment Operations will be assigned to provide
 the necessary staff services to the subcom-
 mittee, and the subcommitee chairman will
 be authorized to appoint, without compensa-
 tion, such technical advisors and consultants
 as may be required to attain the subcom-
 mittee's objectives. Should these studies in-
 dicate that legislative action may be required
 to develop an adequate and comprehensive
 program covering these operations, the sub-
 committee will be directed to submit ap-
 propriate recommendations to the Commit-
 tee on Government Operations.
 STATEMENT  OF SENATOR FRED R. HARRIS, OF
 OKLAHOMA,  AUGUST 20, 1965
 I am grateful to Senator JOHN L. MCCLEL-
 IAN, of Arkansas, chairman of the Govern-
 ment Operations Committee, for the creation
 at my suggestion of a special Subcommittee
 on Government Research, and for his ap-
 pointment of me to chair the new subcom-
 mittee.
 The Federal Government is the largest pur-
 chaser of research today. The Government is
 spending approximately $15 billion a year for
 research and development, or more than 15
 percent of the total annual budget.  This
 compares with a Government expenditure for
 the same ptitrpose of around $75 million in
 1940 and $2 billion in 1953.
 More than half of those engaged in. re-
 search in this country are financed by the
 Federal Government and most of the others
 are influenced by its research programs.
 The Subcommittee on Government Re-
 search will be an active subcommittee, ex-
 amining into all aspects of the huge, $15
 billion annual expenditure for Federal re-
 search and development programs.  I plan
 to call a meeting of the subcommittee soon
 to discuss objectives and to lay our work for
 next session and the balance of this session.
 I have long been concerned with the sub-
 ject embraced by this new subcommittee.
 Vice President HUBERTHUMPHREY, as chair-
 man of a Government Operations Subcom-
 mittee on Executive Reorganization and In-
 ternational Organizations, undertook in 1960
 studies of this matter, as did a House Select
 Committee on Government Research in 1963
 and 1969:.
 Presently, there is no way for one agency
 to find out readily whether a subject pro-
 posed to be researched by it is or has been
 the subject of research by some other gov-
 ernmental agency.  There is no centralized
 oversight or review of research contracts let
 by the various departments and agencies of
 the Federal Government.
 Research results are not readily accessible
 to government agencies or the general public,
 because there is no centralized filing, index-
 ing, or reporting of them.
 No present administrative procedure exists
 to require substantial justification for the
 letting of particular contracts.  Each agency
 pretty much makes its own decisions on
 whether research contracts should be let and
 to whom.
 Universities and other prospective research
 contractors have no regular way of knowing
 in advance- what research and development
 contracts are to be let.
 The $15 billion annual expenditure by the
 Federal Government for research and de-
 velopment has tremendous impact on higher
 education and our economy generally. There
 is no overall national policy on research or
 the proper use of research manpower re-
 sources.
 Approximately 100 of the 1,800 colleges
 and universities in America receive the bulk
 of research contracts let to higher education
 institutions.  Twenty universities do approx-
 imately two-thirds of the Government re-
 search  work and,  not surprisingly,  these
 same 20 universities graduate about two-
 thirds of the Ph. D. 's in the country. The re-
 sult obviously is that the favored institutions
 have grown stronger while the unfavored ones
 have become less able to compete for research
 projects.
 Lastly, our subcommittee, in addition to
 ;considering these  various  aspects  of  the
 problem, will also be concerned with making
 recommendations for the establishment of
 administrative machinery to eliminate dup-
 lications-and overlapping of research projects
 handled by different Federal agencies and to
 reduce unnecessary expenditures.
 COOPERATIVE ACTION TO ELIM-
 INATE  IMMEDIATE  AND DEEP-
 SEATED CAUSES OF RIOTS
 Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, last
 Tuesday I addressed a letter to the Pres-
 ident of the United States making sev-
 eral recommendations for action in con-
 nection with the tragic holocaust occur-
 ring in my State last week.
 Yesterday I received an excellent and
 constructive reply from the President
 telling me that my suggestions would be
 thoroughly considered. I ask unanimous
 consent that both letters be printed in
 the RECORD at this point.
 There being no objection, the letters
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 AUGUST 17, 1965.
 Hon. LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Recently in the Watts
 district of the city of Los Angeles in my
 State, the Nation and the world witnessed a
 tragic outbreak of violence and destruction.
 Apparently, law and order have now been re-
 established.   Sociologists  will  long  study
 what caused this explosion but the time for
 constructive measures by both the legislative
 and executive branches of the National Gov-
 ernment, and by the State government, and
 the communities affected is now.
 I have long supported the establishment
 and continuation of the programs carried out
 under the Economic Opportunity Act which
 is now before the Senate.  I believe it is es-
 sential that all Federal agencies, as well as
 those dealing with the antipoverty program
 be immediately mobilized on a coordinated
 basis  to  make  the  reconstruction  of the
 Watts area a true demonstration of self-help
 and cooperation between private and public
 groups.  I would hope that the resources
 not only of the Office of Economic Opportu-
 nity, but also of the Housing and Home
 Finance Agency, the Small Business Admin-
 istration, the Department of Labor through
 the manpower development, retraining, and
 employment programs would be imagina-
 tively extended to those who have suffered
 so much in this area.  Certainly programs
 such as Volunteers in Service to America
 (VISTA)  would be immensely  helpful  in
 working with community organizations to
 further adult participation on a neighbor-
 hood basis in community life.  I understand
 such a program has already been success-
 fully conducted on a demonstration basis
 in Philadelphia.
 Surely, all arrangements should be im-
 mediately made to eliminate the causes of
 this holocaust.  I respectfully believe the
 Federal Government can be of great assist-
 ance in this critically important field.
 With sincere respect,
 THOMAS H. KUCHEL.
 THE WHITE HOUSE,
 Washington, D.C., August 19, 1965.
 Hon. THOMAS H. KUCHEL,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR Tore: I appreciate your letter of Au-
 gust 18 recommending that programs of
 Federal agencies, as well as those of State,
 city, and private organizations,  be  coordi-
 nated to make the reconstruction of the
 Watts area in Los Angeles a demonstration of
 self-help and cooperation. between private
 and public groups.
 I have been deeply concerned about the
 Los Angeles situation.  As you know, I have
 followed the events there closely.
 In response to the request of Governor
 Brown and Mayor Yorty, Governor LeRoy
 Collins, Under Secretary of Commerce and
 former head of the Community Relations
 Service, was sent to Los Angeles to advise
 and consult with both the Governor and the
 mayor.  Governor Collins is working on all
 the  approaches you  have so thoughtfully
 suggested.  He has reported that he is meet-
 ing with the State, local, private, and Fed-
 eral representatives in Los Angeles immedi-
 ately to assist in bringing together the ef-
 forts of all of these agencies to ease tensions
 and begin the task of rebuilding.
 I agree that we must eliminate both the
 immediate and deep-seated causes of riots
 such as those we witnessed in Los Angeles.
 Together with the Congress, and with much
 help from Senators like you, we have been
 able to obtain many programs designed to
 give residents of poverty-stricken areas the
 sense of hope and responsibility essential for
 human growth in a free society.   But, there
 are complex problems and the solutions are
 neither quick nor easy.  The White House
 Conference InNovember should help us to
 find solutions, as should the work of the
 special  commission  announced    by  Gover-
 nor Brown to examine in depth the causes
 of the Los Angeles riots.
 With deep gratitude for your excellent sug-
 gestions and assurances that I will see that
 each of them is thoroughly considered im-
 mediately for appropriate action, I am, your
 friend,
 Sincerely,
 LYNDON B. JOHNSON.

 Eisenhower said that in 1954 the hope
 was that South Vietnam would be left
 in peace by the Communists in North
 Vietnam and could survive with suf-
 ficient economic aid.  But those hope
 have not been realized.
 President Eisenhower added:
 I have said again and again that I sup-
 port the President in his efforts to defeat
 the Communist military challenge in South
 Vietnam.
 Mr. President, any careful and fair
 review of our policy in Vietnam since
 1954 discloses the remarkable continuity
 and consistency of that policy.
 It has evolved logically from commit-
 ments originally made in 1954, based on
 the principle of assisting a country that
 formally requested us to help.
 Throughout this period we have never
 lost sight of the fact that peace through
 economic and educational aid and, yes,
 through some military advice and supply,
 was our basis for responding to the South
 Vietnamese plea for support.
 Anyone with an ear to hear or an eye
 to read must admit that in recent
 months the Johnson administration has
 stepped up our drive for peaceful nego-
 tiations-negotiations  anywhere.  anv-
 In southeast Asia "would be a grave
 threat to the whole free community," and
 "this possibility should now be met by
 united action and not passively ac-
 cepted."
 That was not President Johnson in
 1965; that was President Eisenhower in
 April 1954, more than 11 years ago.
 In the conditions of early 1954, united
 action did not prove possible, and at the
 Geneva Conference later that spring,
 agreements were reached which con-
 ceded one-half of Vietnam to Communist
 power.
 But the United States did not change
 its purpose.  It proceeded promptly to
 take the lead in the negotiation of the
 Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty.
 In the words of Secretary of State Dulles:
 The purpose of the Southeast Asia Collec-
 tive Defense Treaty is the creation of unity
 for security and peace in southeast Asia and
 the southwestern Pacific.  It is a treaty for
 collective defense against both open armed
 attack and internal subversion.   Although
 the United States has no direct territorial
 interest in southeast Asia, we have much in
 common with the people and governments of
 this area and are united in the face of a
 common danger that stems from interna-
 tional communism.
