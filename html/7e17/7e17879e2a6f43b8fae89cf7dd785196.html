 SOUTH VIETNAMESE ELECTIONS
 I.  The last time we met, the South Vietnamese
 elections were still a month away, and we
 were thinking in terms of a 60-percent
 voter turnout as a fair indication of the
 beginnings of public commitment.
 II.  Since then, the question of the size of the
 vote became the major issue in the elections.
 A.       The Viet Cong made it clear that they
 were out to disrupt'. the balloting.
 B.       The more militant members of the
 Buddhist hierarchy called on their
 followers to boycott it.
 C.       You have seen the results.  More than
 80 percent of the registered voters
 turned out on September 11.
 1.   Registration---5,289,000---was up
 12 percent from previous lists.

 III.   The result was a kick in the teeth, both for the Viet
 Cong and for the Bu3ca.flist militants.
 Premier Ky and other ceovernment....leaders mounted
 4 thorough and effective drive to get out the
 vote.
 B.     Extraordinary security precautions, together
 with good intelligence reporting on Viet Cong
 plans, stopped any major Communist efforts to
 disrupt.the voting.
 1.   Terrorism was well above the normal level,
 but had no significant impact.
 C.   There was no evidence of government favoritism
 for any particular candidates.   The consensus
 of foreign observers is that the election was
 honest.
 IV.    The election has thus demonstrated the administrative
 ability of the government, dealt a sharp blow to Viet
 Cong prestige,  and got South Vietnam's evolution to.-
 ward representative government off to a good start.
 A.   The election result should not be viewed as a
 popularity contest between the government and
 the Viet Cong, but rather as an effective demon-
 stration of the government's administrative and
 security apparatus.

 B.   The failure of the Viet Cong antielection cam-
 paign revealed their overall weakness in govern-
 ment-controlled areas when confronted by a well-
 coordinated and purposeful government program.
 C.  The elected assembly is made up of local favor-
 ite sons and a few well-known politicians,
 1.    It will begin drafting a constitution next
 week.
 2.    The voter turnout gives it  a relatively
 significant popular mandate, but there are
 of course many obstacles to be overcome be-
 fore we can expect a representative, effec-
 tive, government.
 THE MILITARY SITUATION
 I.   Since I last briefed you on US operations in the
 area of the Demilitarized Zone, there have been very
 few significant encounters with the enemy.
 A.   You may remember that Operation HASTINGS
 in duly killed more than 880 enemy soldiers

 by actual body count.   It forced the North
 Vietnamese 324th Division back from Quang
 Tri Province into the Demilitarized Zone
 and North Vietnam.
 B.   Since early August there have been indica-
 tions that this 9,000-man division is again
 concentrating in and immediately south of
 the Demilitarized Zone for another attempt
 to launch an offensive.
 1.    There are also indications that addi-
 tional combat forces are infiltrating
 into this area.   Elements of an un-
 identified North Vietnamese division
 were detected moving south in August.
 They may have already reached the DMZ
 area.
 2.   This latest buildup has been accompanied
 by an intensive logistics effort which
 includes the nightly movement of mili-
 tary cargoes by junk or other watercraft
 along the North Vietnamese coast to the
 border area.   From there, the materiel
 goes by truck to locations within or
 near the DMZ.

 C.   In an effort to counter this enemy buildup,
 US forces have launched a new spoiling
 operation--code-named PRAIRIE--and have
 greatly intensified air strikes in this
 area.
 1.   US activity has been successful in
 keeping the enemy off balance and has
 sharply curtailed his ability to
 launch any large-scale operation in
 the next month or so.   PRAIRIE has
 already inflicted more than 500 en-
 emy casualties.
 D.   Despite the relative success of US opera-
 tions in recent weeks, the enemy buildup
 in Quang Tri Province and southern North
 Vietnam poses a considerable threat.
 1.       It is clearly one of the most impor-
 tant military developments now taking
 place in the war.
 2.       The North Vietnamese have effectively
 extended their territorial control
 through the Demilitarized Zone into
 northern South Vietnam.

 3.   This offers them a number of military
 advantages, such as a more secure
 logistics and infiltration corridor
 and the ability to counter any sig-
 nificant US and South Vietnamese at-
 tempts to choke off infiltration by
 ground action.
 II.  We have obtained more and more evidence in
 recent months of the extent to which Hanoi
 is running--and taking part in--the war'in
 South Vietnam.
 A.   Captured documents and the interrogation
 of prisoners have now identified the man
 who is running the entire Communist war
 effort in South Vietnam.   He is Nguyen Chi
 Thanh,  (NNGWEEN CHEE TAHN) a politburo
 member of the-'North Vietnamese Communist
 Party.
 1.   Thanh is a general in the North Vietnam-
 ese Army, and has been its political
 commissar.   He left North Vietnam to
 take over operations in the South
 early in 1965.

 2.   His two principal deputies are also
 both generals in the North Vietnamese
 Army,  and members of the central com-
 mittee of the North Vietnamese Commu-

 3.   One of them, the military deputy, is
 Tian Van Tra, who used to be deputy
 chief of staff of the North Vietnamese
 Army. Now, under the alias of Tran Nam Trung,
 he is listed as chief of the military
 Affairs Committee of the so-called
 National Front for the Liberation of
 South Vietnam.
 4. The deputy who runs the Communist political
 organization in South Vietnam is General
 Tran Do.
 B.      That is a good sample of how little identifi-
 cation the National Front for the Liberation
 of South Vietnam actually has with the people
 of South Vietnam.

 COMMUNTST CHINA
 4
 I.  The internal political scene in Communist
 China has been marked by turmoil and disarray
 for many months now.   All of the indicatio4
 are that the situation is still unstable,
 and there may be further upheavals.
 A.   For the past month, mobs of rampaginc
 teenagers of the so-called Red Cuard oav
 kept the counry in a state of disord)r
 1.     They hava bec n roaming the stre^ as
 of all major Chinese cities,
 harassing su pected enemies of :he
 regime and o+ casionally beating then,
 up.
 2.     There have been a few reports of
 extensive virlence and bloodshed,
 but for the most part the Red Mrc'
 appear to be a disciplined and well.-
 controlled or,zanization.
 3.     In the past voek  or so, their activities
 have subsided somewhat.
 B.    The destructive an:ics of these teenagers
 have tended to divert public attentlcn
 from far more important development:,

 within the party leadership.   It appears
 to us that th;3 top power structure of the
 party is undergoing its most massive
 shake-up in the history of the Chinese
 Communist regime.
 (BRIEFING BOARD, CHICOM LEADERSHIP)
 II.   Last month, massive demonstrations in Peking on
 the 18th and 31st of August featured what
 appears to be a new line-up of the party's
 top policy-making body, the politburo.
 A.   Mao Tse-tung still dominates the leacershp,
 but Defense Minister Lin Piao has taken
 the place of Mao's long-time deputy,
 Liu Shao-chi.
 1.   Liu has been      titular chief of
 state.   Ther, has been no announce-
 ment that he has lost that position,
 and he is still a member of the
 politburo, hot. he has been dropped
 ignominiously from second to eighth
 place.
 3.    As for Mao himself, we are not sure just.
 how much control he still exercises over
 day-to-day events, or how long he wil' last.

 III.    Mao's new deputy, Lin Piao, is not in much
 better health.
 A.   Lin is one of the youngest men in the polit-
 buro at 59, b=it he has been ill for much
 of the past 30 years, probably with
 tuberculosis.
 1.    Our medical experts believe that the
 tuberculosis is in an arrested stage.
 This would still mean that he must
 limit his working hours, rest a great
 deal, and take long vacations, in order
 to prevent a recurrence.
 2.    His life expectancy is probably not
 much more than five years.
 IV.    Mao, however, appears to have chosen Lin to be
 his successor in spite of Lin's frailty.  We
 think this must reflect Mao's growing mistrust
 of other elements of the leadership.
 A.    Perhaps the most significant aspect of
 the recent changes has been the break-up
 of the group of leaders which had been
 running the party machinery for the past
 decade.
 1.   Liu Shao-chi was the leading member
 of that group.
 Approved For Release 2005/03/24 :,CIA-RDP82R00025R000700150002-1
 S E C R E T
 Approved For Release 2005/03/24: CIA-RDP82R00025R000700150002-1
 2.    The General Secretary of the Party,
 Teng Hsiao-ping, is another leading
 member of that group.  He has been
 weakened, but not as much as Liu.
 3.    A couple of months ago, in fact,
 Teng appeared to have gained hhi the
 shake-up.   All that has changed.
 Teng is still in the inner circle of
 Mao's advisors, but he has slipped
 from third or fourth place to sixth
 place in the power structure.
 B.    In place of the party leaders, military
 leaders close to Lin, and government
 figures like Chou En-lai, have risen in
 importance.
 V.    For many years now, it had appeared to us that
 the leaders of the party machinery--men like
 Liu Shao-chi--enjoyed Mao's full trust.
 A.    They not only had a long record of personal
 loyalty to Mao; their radical approach
 was also in accord with his.
 B.    This situation presents us with a
 puzzling contradiction, especially in
 regard to its policy implications:

 Approved For Release 2005~J0/2~ : FlJ-RpP82R00025R000700150002-1
 Mao is a;7;7arently intent on pushing
 through  ;. radical program to reshape
 Chinesc  ociety.   It appears to be so
 radical that the party rank-and--ii.le
 could not be trusted to carry it out.
 The Rec Guard had to be created.
 2.         There is, therefore, no satisfactory
 explanation for Mao's willingness to
 turn against his old comrades who
 appeared to share his radical views.
 3.         The government administrators and
 economic specialists who have been
 retained or even promoted--men like
 Chou En-lai, Chen Yun, and Li Fu-chun--
 are.the relatively moderate members of
 the politburo.
 4.    Yet these moderates are now the nei
 who presumably will he helping Macy and
 Lin Piao to implement the radical p ogram.
 VI.     As I have said, the situation appears to he highly
 unstable.  The events o  the past ten months must
 have intensified the antagonisms and mistrust
 among those leaders who have survived the purge.

 A.    The possibility has increased that when
 Mao finally does go, the succession will
 be disorderly, and marked by factional
 struggles and bloody purges.
 B.    It is also far from clear whether or not
 the new leaders are going to institui.e
 any major changes in domestic or foreicyi
 policy.
 C.    There has, however, been no change in the
 basic hard-line nature of the men at the
 top.   As a resr.lt, we foresee no abrupt
 change in Pekir'g'   polio' of implacable
 hostility towa.-d the United States.
 FOREIGN POLICY)
 1.    In general, the Peking leaders have been so
 pre-occupied with t-.oulles at home that they
 have been marking time on foreign policy.

 I I . On Vietnam, Pekinv. cor   not os to repeat its

 A.    The first  U.  S.  attacks on North Vietnam'
 POL storage facilities on June 29th pro-
 vided a short-lived barrage of propa-
 ganda.
 1.   Peking tried to convey the impression
 that China was more determined than
 ever to assist Hanoi in resisting
 this new escalc:.tion.
 2.    But the Chinese declarations of
 "resolute support" for the Vietnamese
 did not exhibit the ring of enthusi-
 asm that had marked similar state-
 ments on the subject a year ago.   The
 emphasis was on self-reliance by the
 Vietnamese.
 B.     Peking, however, appears to be just a;
 determined as ever that the North Viet--
 namese must continue the war.
 1. After the September 7th meeting of
 the U. S.,,and Chinese Communist ambassa-
 in Warsaw, the Chinese Ambassador
 dors
 released a statement attacking what he
 called the "U.S. peace talks swindle."
 Ambassador Wang repeated that China would
 support Hanoi against the U. S. to the end.

 C.    Those Chinese protests last week abou'. recent
 violations of Chinese air space did not have
 any threats of counter-action. For all the
 bluster of Chinese propaganda, Peking"s
 reaction to thcs,e incidents has been  :autious.
 Sino-Soviet Relations
 III.  The Sino-Soviet dispute has flared up again,
 but there is no indication that this marks a
 significant change in relations between the
 two countries.
 A.      Mass demonstrations by Red Guards outside
 the Soviet Embassy in Peking on Augus:
 29th and 30th were evidently intended

 delivered on August 26th which had pro-

 of the embassy.
 1.   The Chinese took care, however,  to
 prevent the thousands of people who
 took part in the demonstrations from
 getting out of viand and damaging the
 Soviet Embassy.
 2.   This suggests rf;k.ing is not willing to

 B.   Peking's most recent blast at Moscow
 was a People's Daily  article on
 September 8th, which accused Moscow
 of collaborating with the U. S. to
 "sell out the Vietnamese."
 1.    The article called the Soviets
 "renegades,"  "termites of the
 working class," and "scum in the
 revolutionary ranks."
 C.     Moscow has maintained a general posture
 of restraint, but the Soviet press is
 quoting liberally from criticism of
 China in the foreign Communist press.
 It has recently sharpened the tone of
 its own commentary on China.
 1.    In recent weeks, the Moscow papers
 have also reprinted some of the
 more extreme Chinese statements in
 connection with the Red Guard, to
 let the teen-age antics speak for
 themselves.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 I.   Today is a good time to take a look at the situa-
 tion in the Dominican Republic.
 A.   The last US troops--the rear guard of the
 Inter-American Peace Force--are scheduled
 to leave for home today.
 B.   From here on, the government of President
 Joaquin Balaguer is on its own.
 II.     There seems to be no :immediate challenge to
 the regime's authority.   There is also, how-
 ever, no promise that Balaguer can establish
 a strong or stable footing over the next six
 months or so.
 A.   Many of the Dominican military are pres-
 ently sympathetic to Balaguer.
 B.   Nevertheless, the President is conscious
 of the need to consolidate his hold on
 the armed forces.

 1.   He is trying to curb the power of poten-
 tial dissidents through a military re-
 organization plan.
 2.   On September 17th he fired the head of
 the air   force.   The new air force chief
 is just as conservative as the man who
 was fired, but he has pledged loyalty
 to the President.
 III. So far, Juan Bosch and his left-of-center Domini-
 can Revolutionary Party have been relatively
 restrained in their opposition.
 A.      Relations between Bosch and Balaguer could
 easily become estranged.
 1.    Balaguer has already demonstrated a
 strong sensitivity to criticism from
 Bosch.
 IV.   The withdrawal of the Peace Force will probably
 lead to a step-up in terrorism and agitation
 by the extreme left.
 A.      The three Communist parties, however, re-
 main divided.
 B.      The Communists constitute a serious problem
 for Balaguer, but unless they make common
 cause with non-Communists, they will not pose
 a major threat to stability.

 V.    Severe economic problems confront the govern-
 ment.
 A.   The government has been slow in launching
 a $40-million, US-financed investment
 program, designed to reduce widespread
 unemployment.
 B.   An acute balance of payments problem con-
 fronts the government.   This will require
 unpopular austerity measures.
 LATIN-AMERICAN ROUNDUP
 Finally,  if you gentlemen have the time, I have a
 series of brief notes on some of the hot spots in
 Latin America;
 THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS
 I.   In February 1967,  six British Caribbean ter-
 ritories  (Antigua,  St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla,
 Dominica,  St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Grenada)
 will assume a virtually independent "Asso-
 ciated Status   relationship with Great Britain.
 The US Consul General in Barbados is concerned
 that this rapid British withdrawal may leave a
 political vacuum on the islands.

 II.    Barbados receives its independence from Great
 Brtaint,on November 30th this year;  the date
 for elections has yet to be announced.
 III.    General elections are scheduled to be held in
 Trinidad and Tobago on November 7th with all
 indications pointing to victory for the moder-
 ate  government of Prime Minister Eric Williams
 and his People's National Movement  (PNM).
 IV.    In Jamaica, where general elections will prob-
 ably take place in the spring of 1967, a
 horse race is expected between the ruling
 Jamaica Labor Party of Prime Minister Bustamante,
 and the opposition People's National Party.

 I.    Fidel Castro has resumed his normally active
 role in Cuba,  following a period of relative
 inactivity late last spring; his power position,
 based on tight security controls and the loyalty
 of his key military and security officials, re-
 mains strong.
 A.   Castro is worried about the continued failure
 of his regime to overcome the many critical
 economic and administrative problems on the
 island.
 1.         His increasingly bellicose actions and
 statements during the last nine months
 probably result from personal frustra-
 tion over these problems.
 B.   Castro dwelt at some length on the revolu-
 tion's shortcomings in a bluntly worded
 speech on 29 August.
 II.    Our special Cuba Team which checks out all re-
 ports of nuclear weapons in Cuba continues to
 conclude that there are no such weapons or de-
 livery systems on the island.

 I.   Panama's President Robles,  in public and private
 conversations,  continues to voice optimism over
 the canal treaty, despite many problems still
 facing the US and Panamanian negotiators.
 A.    Robles'  recent statements, in which he in-
 dicated the talks were "going well," prob-
 ably are aimed at blunting the inevitable
 barrage of opposition criticism that will
 accompany the opening of the National As-
 sembly on October first.
 B.    Communist-led students and opposition groups
 will try to stir up trouble at the opening
 session of the Assembly; national holidays
 on November 3rd,  4th and 5th are also dates
 when the students traditionally clash with
 government security forces and stage anti-
 US demonstrations.
 ARGENTINA
 I.   The Argentine government, under President Juan
 Carlos Ongania, is making slow progress in in-
 stituting the reforms which impelled the mili-
 tary to oust the Illia government on June 27th.

 A.     The regime's revolutionary momentum has been
 slowed by Ongania's methodical, deliberate
 pace and by strong criticism of his govern-
 ment's takeover of the country's eight na-
 tional universities.
 1.          This involved get-tough methods with
 students and professors who protested
 the move.
 B.     The government seems to be firmly in the
 saddle at the moment, but a few potential
 storm warnings are up.
 1.          Chief of these is the indication that
 some of Ongania's key military backers
 are beginning to squabble over policy,
 and jockey for power.
 BRAZIL
 I.   The Brazilian .legislatur:e looks 99-- percent cer-
 tain to elect Marshal Arthur Costa e Silva as
 Brazil's next president on October 3.
 A.         With that, Brazil will enter an interregnum
 period which will be marked by political
 turbulence and not much forward progress.

 B.   President Castello Branco, who is due to
 leave office on 15 March 1967, plans to
 make the overhaul of the 1946 Constitution
 his last major project, but pulling and
 hauling over this project as well as ma-
 neuvering for the November 15th direct elec-
 tions of the new congress may keep politi-
 cal tensions high.
 ,C.  A stubbornly high rate of increase in the
 cost of living,  and growing student and
 labor opposition to the government, also
 promise to keep giving both the old and
 the new president many headaches.

 ECUADOR
 I.     In Ecuador, economic and political instability
 continue to plague the interim government of
 President Yerovi, and may lead to the postpone-
 ment of the Constituent Assembly.
 A.   This body now is scheduled to be elected on
 October 16 and to convene on November third.
 B.   Antigovernment plotting is being carried on
 by at least five disparate groups--composed
 mostly of corrupt opportunists with little
 popular  support.
 C.   Reports of preparations for a pre-emptive
 coup by military leaders add to the general
 public's disrespect for the government and
 lack of hope for the future.
 D.   Economic problems, stemming from a chronic
 shortage of funds, defy short-term solution
 and will be a continual embarrassment to the
 interim government and its successor.
 URUGUAY
 I.  The political temperature in Uruguay is rising
 as the country approaches the November 27th
 national elections, when voters will not only
 choose a new government but will also vote on
 four separate constitutional reform proposals.

 bipartisan proposal that would change the
 present nine-man executive to a presidential
 system of government, but it is far from cer-

 1.    The Uruguayan Communist Party,  through

 are not met, Uruguay could be in for a period

 GUYANA
 I.   In Guyana, a new outbreak of squabbling is
 once more threatening to break up the political
 marriage of convenience between Prime Minister
 Burnham and Finance Minister D'Aguiar.
 A.    We think the Burnham government probably
 would hang on even if D'Aguiar should
 leave the government, but it would sorely
 miss D'Aguiar's practicality and insistence
 on fiscal integrity.
 B.    A split in the governing coalition also un-
 doubtedly would give Marxist Cheddi Jagan
 and his friends a handy political weapon
 to use against Burnham.
 C.    It could prove especially dangerous if it
 comes soon after all remaining British
 troops leave Guyana on October 31.

 I. Guatemalan President Mendez has appealed for
 unity and peace, but extremists on both the
 left and right are engaging in terrorist tactics.
 A.    Continued assassinations of rightists by
 the Communist action group FAR has led
 far rightists to arm, and to plan vendetta

 alleged inaction of the president and the

 HONDURAS
 I.    In Honduras, President Oswaldo Lopez'  inep-
 titude, his lack of accomplishment, and his
 allowance of excessive power in the hands of
 Minister of the Presidency Ricardo Zuniga are
 breeding discontent.
 A.   The opposition Liberal Party is plotting
 the overthrow of the government and has
 the support of at least one military zone
 commander.
 B.   Restiveness in the military is growing,
 particularly over Zuniga's interference in
 their affairs.   Rumors are circulating that
 a coup attempt will be made when the presi-
 dent is visiting Mexico in late October.
 C.   There is no evidence, however, that military
 support for an overthrow is sufficient to
 be serious.
