 CONGRESSIONAL. RECORD - APPENDIX                    A2423
 A PERSONAL REPORT:  THE TEACHERS AND THE
 TAUGHT IN THE U.S.S.R.
 (By William Benton, former Assistant Secre-
 tary of State and U.S. Senator; presently
 U.S. Ambassador to UNESCO and U.S. mem-
 ber of its executive board; publisher and
 chairman, Encyclopedia Britannica)
 CHAPTER III. THE THRUST OF SOVIET HIGHER
 EDUCATION
 The  Soviet                       universities  train  teachers.
 They also train research scientists "at the
 theoretical level."  There were 33 Soviet uni-
 versities when I first visited the U.S.S.R. in
 1955. Now there are 40.  This is almost one
 new university a year.
 Engineers, physicians, agricultural experts,
 and other professionals are trained in spe-
 cialized institutes.   There are over 700 of
 these. They also train  scholars in basic
 research.  Only about 10 percent of Soviet
 students in advanced education attend the
 universities.  The rest attend the institutes.
 In     December  1963 Vyacheslav  Yelutin,
 minister of higher  and  secondary special
 education in the U.S.S.R., reported:
 "At the present time there are more than
 3 million students in higher educational in-
 stitutions.                                                                                The schools of higher learning
 will develop further in keeping with progress
 in science and technology.  By 1970 the num-
 ber of students will reach 4.7 million-that
 is, 1.4 times as many students in comparison
 with 1963.  By 1980 there will be 2.5 times as
 many  students  in  higher  schools.   This
 means the rate of training of high level
 specialists in the Soviet Union will exceed
 that of the United States even more than it
 does at present."
 The 3,258,000 students enrolled in Soviet
 higher educational institutions in 1963 com-
 pared with 4.494,626 degree-credit students
 in the United States.   (Yelutin questions
 this comparison; he told me he doubts that
 the first 2 years of undergraduate educa-
 tion in the United States should be classified
 as "higher education.")   Of these enroll-
 ments, about 60 percent in the United States
 were full-time students, whereas only 40 per-
 cent were full time in the U.S.S.R.  The
 Soviet plan for 1965, as delineated in a May
 1963 order of Yelutin, called for an enroll-
 ment of 3,860,000.  This projected an increase
 of 602,000 in only 2 years.  However, only
 1.6 million, or 41 percent, were expected to
 be full-time day students.
 These increasing enrollments will require
 greater numbers of institutes and univer-
 sities.   During the years 1983-70, 23, new
 higher educational institutions are planned.
 Nineteen of these will be devoted to science
 and technology.   Four will deal primarily
 with agriculture.
 Because of the differences in structure be-
 tween institutions of higher education in the
 U.S.S.R. and in the United States, it is im-
 possible to compare precisely the number to
 whom degres are granted.
 Yelutin gave me the following breakdown
 of student enrollment by specialization:
 Forty-two percent in "the  humanities."
 Most of these are preparing to teach-includ-
 ing the teaching of science--in secondary
 schools.
 Forty percent are preparing to become en-
 gineers and technical experts.
 Ten percent specialize in agriculture.
 Eight percent are in medicine.- ("More
 than 80 percent of these are women.")
 Yelutin conceded, "You are still ahead at
 the higher level in many areas.  You are
 ahead in physics, chemistry, biology, and
 mathematics.  Yes, you have more students
 in these areas. We are trying to catch up
 with you.  But we are definitely ahead in
 engineers.. We are now seeking to increase
 the number of students in the natural sci-
 ences, but we have solved the problem of
 engineers."
 In the Soviet Union, higher education has
 generally consisted of 5 or more years of
 full-time study, culminating in a "diploma"
 (diplom)  degree.  However, in the current
 year curricula have been shortened in a num-
 ber of fields, including teacher education.
 In 1963 a total of 332,500 diplomas were
 granted by Soviet higher institutions, com-
 pared with 316,000 in 1962.  American first-
 level (bachelor's and first professional) de-
 grees, of which 417,846 were awarded in 1962,
 are generally based upon 4 years of under-
 graduate education.  In the United States
 a master's, or other second-level' degree is
 generally obtainable with 1 or 2 years of addi-
 tional study.  This degree is intermediate
 between the bachelor's and doctor's degree.
 The Soviet system has no similar intermedi-
 ate degree.
 In 1963-64 there were 196,700 professional
 and teaching staff members in Soviet higher
 educational institutions, including about 500
 academicians (the highest academic rank)
 In various special fields, 6,700 holders of doc-
 tor's  (doktor  nauk)  degrees,  and  59,000
 holders of candidates of science (kandidat
 nauk) degrees.  These groups include about
 34 percent of the total number of scientific
 research personnel in the country.
 In the United States, Government service
 and college teaching are lowly paid profes-
 sions in a relative sense, but this is not the
 case  in  the  Soviet  Union.  The  Supreme
 Soviet recently adopted a law, according to
 Izvestia, increasing salaries of elementary and
 secondary schoolteachers an average of 25
 percent in 1964 and 1965. But teachers in
 the field of higher education in the Soviet
 Union have been extraordinarily well paid,
 again in a relative sense, for many years.
 These high rewards, plus the prized reward
 of relatively greater freedom of action than
 most officials and plant managers enjoy, help
 explain the tremendous motivation of Soviet
 students to achieve success in the world of
 Soviet scholarship.
 There are three grades of teachers in the
 higher Soviet institutes and universities: as-
 sistants, a rank approximately equivalent to
 an  American  instructorship;  the  docents,
 who are roughly comparable to our assist-
 ant and associate professors; and professors,
 who  normally  hold  the  doctor's   degree.
 (The Soviet doctorate is far more difficult to
 achieve than in the United States and thus
 is nowhere near as common; most achieve
 it only in middle age, with exceptions for
 the fields where scholarship flowers early,
 such as mathematics and physics.)
 The highest academic honor in the Soviet
 Union is membership in one of the acad-
 emies, and academy members are known and
 addressed as "Academicians."  Fourteen of
 the  republics  have  their own  academies.
 There  are  special  all-Soviet academies in
 medical science, pedagogy, agriculture, archi-
 tecture,  and                                                                                                                                       other fields.  Each academy
 elects its own membership.     The most pres-
 tigious of them all is the Academy of Sci-
 ences of the U.S.S.R.  Membership in the
 Academy of Sciences is the highest scientific
 honor that the Soviet Union can bestow, and
 it carries with a substantial stipend.  Most
 academy  members  receive  a     professor's
 salary as well.  They are the highest paid,
 most honored, and most independent profes-
 sional men in the U.S.S.R.  They conduct or
 supervise basic research in all areas of sci-
 ence, and they are currently credited with
 the  extraordinary  success of  the  Soviet
 Union in rocketry, space exploration, and re-
 lated fields.
 contributions to checking the spread of ag-
 gression and to bring about the peace that
 South Vietnam and southeast Asia deserve."
 Australian Government sources said the
 decision to send combat forces did not re-
 sult from the visit to Canberra recently by
 U.S. Presidential Envoy Henry Cabot Lodge,
 who is touring friendly Far Eastern and Pa-
 cific nations to win support for U.S. policy
 in Vietnam.  The sources said the Australian
 Cabinet had considered the idea of a more
 positive involvement for some time before
 Lodge's visit.
 Last week's decision recalled a plan put
 forward late in February by U.S. Representa-
 tive GERALD R. FORD, 'JR., of Grand Rapids,
 for winning the war in Vietnam without a
 major buildup of American troops.
 The  House  Republican  leader  proposed
 that fighting men from several Asiatic na-
 tions be assigned to the defense of South
 Vietnam against the Communist Vietcong.
 FORD had listed South Korea, Formosa, the
 Philippines, and Australia as countries he
 felt could contribute substantial numbers of
 troops to a joint force to defend freedom in
 South Vietnam.
 "Those countries have just as big an inter-
 est as we do in keeping southeast Asia free,"
 he said.  "Maybe more so, since they are
 geographically closer to the war."
 We observed at the time FORD made his
 proposal that the big question was whether
 other Asian countries would cooperate.  We
 also noted that the answer couldn't be ob-
 tained unless the question were asked.
 The  fact  that Australia  announced    its
 decision to send additional combat troops
 following and not before Lodge's visit to that
 country is significant.  The timing suggests
 the possibility that representatives of the
 U.S. administration are  now pressing the
 question  raised  by  FonD's  proposal  more
 than 2 months ago.

 Taught in the U.S.S.R.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. BERNARD F. GRABOWSKI
 OF CONNECTICUT
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday,, May 17, 1965
 Mr. GRABOWSKI.  Mr. Speaker, the
 article written by Mr. William Benton for
 the Encyclopedia Britannica 1965 Year-
 book should do more than awaken the
 American people to the importance of
 education in the cold war.
 It should make them realize that in
 order to form a better society and in
 order to maintain the growth and posi-
 tion of the United States as leader of the
 world, education is the essential in all en-
 deavors.
 To produce thinking men and women is
 not a process of stagnation, it is a process
 of constant stimulation, of constant ex-
 posure to new ideas.
 Mr. Benton ably demonstrates this and
 the importance which another nation, the
 U.S.S.R., is attaching to the teaching of
 their youths.
 The third chapter of the article fol-
 lows:

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX          May 17, 1965
 The Academy of Sciences runs the great
 research  institutes.  In these are concen-
 trated most of the fundamental or theoreti-
 cal research which In the United States is
 largely centered in our universities.  The
 prestige of the 162 full members of the Soviet
 Academy of Sciences is at least comparable
 to that we bestow upon the president of
 Harvard or a Nobel Prize winner.
 Our knowledge of how Soviet theoretical
 and applied scientific research are carried
 forward is not complete.  But I think we
 can  safely  say  that  three  bureaucracies
 carry on most research:
 1. The Soviet Academy of Science and its
 reasearch institutes.
 2. Universities and  teaching institutes,
 with their research staffs.
 3. Agencies of the various universities and
 ministries (e.g., for health, or the heavy in-
 dustries), as well as institutes for various re-
 gions, with the laboratories and teaching in-
 stitutes attached to them.
 These three engage In some competition
 for personnel.  However, in the monolithic
 society of the U.S.S.R. there is said to be
 even more competition for  prestige.  The
 lines of difference between basic or theoreti-
 cal research, in which our universities spe-
 cialize, and the applied research with which
 we Identify the great laboratories of Bell
 Telephone and General Electric, for exam-
 ple-these lines are much more blurred and
 confused in the U.S.S.R. than in the United
 States.
 Testimony in Support of the Freed
 Commission Act
 EXTENSION OF REM
 of
 HON. JOE R. POOL
 IVIWIN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, May 17, 1965
 Mr. POOL. Mr. Speaker, I should like
 to call to the attention of my colleagues
 the following testimony given before the
 House Committee on Un-American Ac-
 tivities on May 14. 1965, by the Honorable
 William C. Doherty, former Ambassador
 to Jamaica.  Experienced In both labor
 and foreign affairs, Mr. Doherty is well
 qualified to evaluate the need of our Na-
 tion for the Freedom Academy.
 His testimony follows:
 STATEMENT BY Wu.LIAM C. DOHERTY BEFORE
 THE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN AcTivr-
 TIES ON H.R. 2379, MAY 14, 1965
 Mr. Chairman and members of the com-
 mittee, my name Is William C. Doherty.  I
 am appearing today as a private citizen to
 testify in support of the Freedom Commis-
 sion Act.  My background and experiences
 have led me to take a particular Interest in
 the subject matter of this bill.  For 21 years
 I was president of the National Association
 of Letter Carriers and I was active In both
 the AFL and later the AFL-CIO.  I am at
 present a vice president emeritus of the lat-
 ter organization.  In addition I served from
 1962 to 1964 as U.B. Ambassador to Jamaica.
 It was my honor to be the first American
 Ambassador to that nation after It received
 its Independence from Britain.  With this
 background in both labor and foreign affairs,
 I have had occasion to observe the methods
 employed by Communists both In this coun-
 try and abroad in their attempts to under-
 mine free Institutions and turn legitimate
 movements  and innocent  Individuals  into
 instruments for furthering their totalitarian
 purposes.
 As is well-known to the members of this
 committee. the Communists have over a pe-
 riod of 40 years developed and refined a num-
 ber of political warfare techniques to ahigh
 level of effectiveness.  These techniques are
 taught to Communists from all over the world
 in  a  very  extensive   network  of  political
 schools within the Comm"Ist countries.
 The graduates of these schools then return
 to their own countries to staff Communist
 Party organizations and Communist front
 groups. They know how to write propaganda
 and how to reproduce and distribute it. They
 know how to couch their propaganda so as
 to appeal to various Interests and attitudes
 among the target population.  They know
 how to utilize groups which have goals only
 partially compatible with communism In
 campaigns which actually further the over-
 all Communist program.  For example, Com-
 munists often succeed In enlisting pacifists
 and democratic social reformers in move-
 ments which are actually aimed more at dis-
 crediting free governments and promoting
 Communist  totalitarianism  than  at  the
 limited and laudable goals to which they
 superficially appear to be directed. Gradu
 ates of Communist political schools know
 how  to  organize  groups,  how to arrange
 demonstrations, and how to transmute a
 peaceful demonstration Into forceful "mass
 action." They know     how to use limited
 slogans to enlist peasants In guerilla opera-
 tions actually under Communist control.
 Given favorable social and political con-
 ditions, such trained political experts can be
 effective out of all proportion to their num-
 bers.                                                                              In stable societies, such conditions are
 absent, and Communist movements degen-
 crate Into pitiable cliques of cranks and mis-
 fits, as we have seen in the United States and
 several countries of Western Europe. In the
 the Western Impact and the resulting drive
 for modernization, institutions are not stable,
 large groups feel that their interests are un-
 represented. masses of people are confused
 and despairing, and here the conditions for
 effective  political  action  by  Communists
 trained in the appropriate techniques are all
 too frequently present.
 in the years since World War II, and par-
 ticularly in recent months and weeks, we
 have seen how dangerous Communist polit-
 ical efforts can be to the cause of democracy
 and pluralistic development in general and
 to the national Interests of the United States
 In  particular.  Communist  guerrilla  and
 political  action brought Mao Tse-tung to
 power in China.  Adroit and energetic polit-
 ical action allowed the Communists to seize
 control of the democratic revolution which
 overthrew Batista in Cuba.  A few months
 ago a rather small number of Communists
 trained in Cuba and elsewhere came very
 close  to  maneuvering  Zanzibar  Into  the
 Communist bloc, and the danger is by no
 means eliminated today-  Most recently, a
 fairly small number of Communist agents,
 taking advantage of a people deprived of po-
 litical experience by 40 years of reactionary
 dictatorship, captured at least partial con-
 trol of an Initially democratic revolution in
 the Dominican Republic, making necessary
 the Intervention of American troops to pre-
 vent the Installation of a dictatorship of the
 left.  I want to say at this point that I com-
 mend President Johnson for his forthright
 action in stabilizing the chaotic situation In
 the Dominican Republic.  His administra-
 tion is taking a strong stand against com-
 munism In the Caribbean, just as he is in
 Vietnam. where the slightest sign of Irre-
 solution on the part of the United States
 could endanger the whole of southeast Asia.
 However, one cannot help but speculate as
 to what might have been done earlier to
 prevent situations such as those in Viet-
 nam and the Dominican Republic from de
 generating to the point that military action
 was required to stave off Communist threats.
 Had free men dedicated to the cause of dem-
 ocratic reform and development been as well
 organized, as energetic, and as well trained
 in basic political techniques as were the
 Communists, it would have been democratic
 groups which organized the peasantry in
 Vietnam, and It would have been democratic
 forces which emerged as the focal point of
 action from the confused situation in the
 Dominican Republic.
 Clearly, the free world must take steps to
 give those devoted to democratic action the
 training needed to overcome the threat of
 Communist activity.  Democrats must learn
 how  to  organize  student  groups,  labor
 unions, womens' clubs, political parties, and
 all the other organizations basic to effective
 political action.  They must also learn the
 operating techniques of the Communists, so
 that free men can anticipate what the Com-
 munists will do, and use democratic action
 to defeat the Communists when they do
 begin to move.
 The Freedom Academy offers one promising
 approach to this problem of training cadres
 for democratic political action.   it would
 give a full-time staff the support needed to
 carry out research on Communist political
 techniques, on the curriculums of Commu-
 nist political schools. and on the use made by
 local  Communist parties  of  graduates  of
 these schools. It would also allow the de-
 velopment of Ideas and procedures for com-
 bating Communist subversion and building
 up the many free organizations required for
 a pluralistic democracy capable of carrying
 through true social reforms.  The Freedom
 Academy could also Instruct our diplomats,
 Information experts. and aid advisers on
 Communist tactics in developing areas and
 on techniques which could be suggested to
 aid-receiving groups as probably effective in
 countering Communist challenges.  Finally,
 the Academy could train members of demo-
 cratic groups in other countries, be they
 farm groups, labor unions, political parties,
 government bureaucracies, or other organi-
 zations. In the political skills needed to ef-
 fectively achieve democratic social goals and
 remain Impervious to Communist infiltra-
 tion.
 We in the American labor movement have
 considerable experience In these problems.
 The International Department of the AFL-
 CIO constantly works in many ways to
 strengthen free, democratic labor unions
 throughout the world. Since 1962, the Amer-
 ican Institute for Free Labor Development
 has  been  working  in  Latin  America  to
 strengthen free unions and to bring social
 progress directly to their members.   This
 year the Afro-American Labor Center Opened
 in New York to undertake a related program
 in the countries of Africa. I am convinced
 that-our experience In the labor field shows
 that the type of research and training to be
 carried  out  by  the  proposed  Freedom
 Academy will be very effective In building
 democratic institutions and opposing com-
 munism.   Whereas our work is concerned
 with one specific type of institution, the
 Freedom Academy could operate on a broader
 basis and bring the benefits of democratic
 political training to a wider spectrum of
 organizations.
 To look more closely at the relevant expe-
 rience of the AIFLD, I should like to first
 describe Its training program.  Through local
 seminars In Latin America, through 3-month
 courses In resident centers in most capital
 cities, and  through  an  additional  course
 given at our school   In Washington, D.C.,
 young Latin American trade unionists are
 taught how to administer their unions, how
 to collect dues, how to prepare for responsi-
 ble collective bargainging, how to detect
 Communist attempts at infiltration, and how
 to foil them should they occur.  To date over
 20,000 young unionists have passed through

 one  or  another  phase of  this  training.
 Throughout Latin America, these trainees are
 now moving into positions of increasing au-
 thority within their unions, often displac-
 ing previous Communist leadership In the
 process.
 In addition to giving the trade union lead-
 ers        a  thorough  grounding  in  democratic
 philosophy and skills, the AIFZ.D gives them
 a concrete social program designed to bring
 the Alliance for Progress directly to the work-
 ers so that their tangible needs can be filled.
 The AFL-CIO's member unions have ear-
 marked $67 million for lending to union
 housing projects in Latin America.  Repre-
 sentatives of AIFLD's social projects depart-
 ment assist Latin American unions in set-
 ting up credit unions, housing cooperatives,
 workers' banks, and smaller self-help proj-
 ects of community development.  In rural
 areas, AIFLD experts help agrarian unions
 to bring knowledge of better farming tech-
 niques to their members, and to organize
 marketing and production co-ops to increase
 rural productivity and provide a better life
 for the peasant.   When programs such as
 these begin operating, they provide benefits
 now  that  Communist  agitators  can  only
 promise  vaguely   for  the  future,  after a
 bloody and costly revolution.  Taken to-
 gether,                 we believe  AIFLD's training  and
 social programs offer an effective approach
 to building free labor, institutions and In the
 process defeating  Communist attempts at
 subversion.
 I gather that many of these same ap-
 proaches would be taught in the courses of
 the Freedom Academy, and on the basis of
 our experience in the international field of
 free trade unionism, we feel such instruc-
 tion will be of great benefit to the cause of
 freedom. It is for this reason that I support
 the bill now under consideration.
 I would like at this point to conclude by
 citing a few specific lessons which we have
 learned from our oversea labor work, and
 which I am sure will be beneficial to the
 successful operation of the Freedom Acad-
 emy.
 First, the Academy must broadly repre-
 sent all the, main strands within the Amer-
 ican political consensus.  It can succeed only
 if it has the full support of most major inter-
 est groups, most philosophical viewpoints,
 and both major parties. If it becomes the
 exclusive preserve of one clique, or one view-
 point, it will never get the support needed to
 survive.  In the case of the AIFLD, Its great
 strength is that it Is supported not only by
 labor, but also by business; not Only by lib-
 erals, but by virtually the whole sweep of
 U.S. Political opinion, and by both Repub-
 licans and Democrats.  The same must be
 true of the Freedom Academy.  Without the
 full confidence of the public as a whole, the
 effort would be bound to fail.  I hope that in
 drafting the bill, machinery will be provided
 which will be sure to reflect the views of
 all major groups within the American con-
 sensus.
 Second, in training foreigners, the Acad-
 emy should work through existing demo-
 are less suspect abroad than the work of a
 government agency.  Such official agencies
 obviously are supposed to serve the immedi-
 ate  foreign-policy  Interests  of  the  state,
 whereas private groups can be presumed to
 have wider latitude. The Academy should
 train American private citizens in how to set
 up union-to-union, farmer-to-farmer, uni-
 versity-to-university and similar private re-
 lationships.  The knowledge of Communist
 techniques and democratic political skills
 could best be transmitted from the Academy,
 to private U.S. groups, to their counterparts
 abroad, rather than directly from our Gov-
 ernment to foreign nationals.. This private,
 institution-to-institution    approach    has
 proved its merit in the experiences of the
 AIFLD, AFL-CIO, Credit Union International,
 4-H, and other private groups.
 Finally, the graduates of the Academy must
 promote a philosophy of social reform and
 economic progress in keeping with our demo-
 cratic ideals.  The groups chosen must be
 forces for progress, with programs directly
 attacking  real social  ills.  While  political
 skills and techniques are important, it is
 issues and program and philosophy which
 win political campaigns, whether in a U.S.
 election or in a confused cold-war situation
 abroad.  Political gimmicks will not win the
 cold war.  If the policy content of a group's
 program is not appealing, all the finely honed
 techniques and strategems In the world can-
 not help it to match the social appeals of
 the Communists to a desperate population.
 The real reason why American labor's efforts
 abroad have been successful is that we stand
 for a better deal for the worker.  The politi-
 cal skills taught in our schools, and which
 will be taught In the Freedom Academy, are
 of value only as mechanisms to put across
 our social message.  It is the content, not
 the form of politics, that counts.
 I am confident that if these maxims are fol-
 lowed, the proposed Freedom Academy will
 make a great contribution to the cause of
 democracy throughout the world.  It is this
 potential that led me to come here today to
 support the bill, and I want to thank the
 committee very sincerely for having given me
 the opportunity to come here and express my
 views before such a distinguished and influ-
 ential forum.

 UNIVERSITY  OF  MINNESOTA,
 COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES,
 Minneapolis, Minn., April 1, 1965.
 Hon. CLARK MACGREGOR,
 House Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 My DEAR REPRESENTATIVE MACGREGOR:  The
 administrative committee of the College of
 Medical Sciences of the University of Minne-
 sota has carefully reviewed three proposed
 bills which would vitally affect medical edu-
 cation.  H.R. 3141 would provide direct sup-
 port of medical schools.  H.R. 3140 proposes
 the establishment of regional medical com-
 plexes for research, training, and demonstra-
 tion of patient care in the fields of heart
 disease, cancer, stroke, and other major dis-
 eases.  H.R. 3142 would provide support for
 medical libraries.
 We enthusiastically endorse and urge your
 active support of H.R. 3141 and H.R. 3142.
 H.R. 3141 Is particularly urgent In view of
 the well-known needs of the Nation's medi-
 cal schools including the University of Min-
 nesota.  This urgency is Increased manyfold
 by the likelihood of passage of some form of
 H.R. 3140, which would produce unparalleled
 demands for medical manpower.  If any sort
 of regional medical complexes are to be es-
 tablished as envisioned In H.R. 3140, passage
 of H.R. 3141 is an absolute essential for at-
 tempting to meet the consequent manpower
 needs. We can only wish, In retrospect, that
 a bill like H.R. 3141 had been adopted several
 years ago in order that a lag phase of serious
 proportions with respect to medical man-
 power could have been averted.
 Our administrative committee gave close
 attention to the details of H.R. 3140.  The
 committee recognizes that such a proposed
 bill would have a profound impact on medi-
 cal  education  and the  entire practice                                                                                                                            of
 medicine. The expansion of research and of
 medical education made possible under this
 proposal would, increase medical knowledge
 and facilitate the utilization  of  medical
 knowledge already at hand to reduce suffer-
 ing and death from cancer, heart disease,
 stroke, and other major diseases. Naturally,
 we support the objectives of this bill, but we
 do have a number of areas of concern with
 respect to the proposal as it stands.  We be-
 lieve that It can be strengthened and made
 more workable by appropriate changes, and
 we are making certain observations and rec-
 ommendations  for                                                                                                                                     your  thoughtful   con-
 sideration.
 The  University   of  Minnesota   Medical
 School has been operating as a part of a
 "regional medical complex" for many years.
 It has had an effective program of continuing
 or post-graduate  education  directed  at
 physicians especially in the area including
 Minnesota, North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,
 eastern Montana, northern Iowa, and western
 Wisconsin.  The Mayo Graduate School of
 Medicine in Rochester (formerly the Mayo
 Foundation) has served as an integral part
 of this complex.
 The program established by the Minnesota
 Department of Health in 1956 of a Minne-
 sota State plan for hospitals, public health
 centers, and related medical facilities has de-
 fined  and facilitated  the participation  of
 the University of Minnesota Medical Center
 in an organized regional program of referral,

 zation of the proposed new program.
 The administrative committee of the Col-
 lege of Medical Sciences of the University of
 Minnesota makes the following recommenda-
 tions regarding a program which would make
 the most effective use of manpower and
 facilities:
 1. Medical schools have been the founda-
 tion for the advances of medical sciences and
 for the preparation of physicians to practice
 all phases of medical care. Research in medi-
 cal  schools  has been  broadly  based,  not
 sharply categorized.  The Interplay of Ideas
 between the various fields of interest, both
 basic and  clinical,  has  contributed  sig-
 nificantly to these advances.                               Relationships
 between fields or specialists which may pro-
 duce the most significant new discoveries
 are not predictable.  Therefore the contin-
 uing           association               of scientific minds from
 across the broad range of medical sciences
 to allow free exchange of ideas constitutes
 the optimal environment for progress in
 medical research.
 If the regional medical complexes are to
 foster and assure the greatest possible ad-
 vances, they should provide support for re-
 search on a broad basis, not on a narrow
 categorical basis.  Each medical center (or
 combination of centers) receiving a grant as
 the basic unit of a regional medical com-
 plex should have support for research, medi-
 cal education, and exemplary medical care
 for heart disease, cancer, stroke and the other
 major diseases supported under this title,
 come an around-the-clock, around-the-
 calendar collection of these lethal boxes
 performed at the expense of the refuse
 collectors themselves as their contribu-
 tion to the health, welfare and safety of
 their community.
 Since the program was started, hun-
 dreds of thousands of persons have
 moved to the San Fernando Valley.
 Current population figures have topped
 the million mark, and if the Valley had
 status as a city, it would be the seventh
 largest in our Nation. Despite this great
 population growth, not one valley child
 has lost his life in this way during the
 lifetime of Operation Deathtrap.  It is
 my sincere prayer and trust that no
 valley child will lose his life in such a
 manner.  If we are granted this good
 fortune, it will be in large measure due
 to the unselfish and civic-minded effort
 on the part of these fine men who are
 members of the association.
 Operation Deathtrap was conceived by
 Will Chappel, San Fernando Valley civic
 leader and a public relations counsel,
 supported by Chief of Police William H.
 Parker and his valley command, and ac-
 tivated by the refuse removal operators.
 Working as a team, they have effected
 the removal of close to 1,000 of these
 derelict contraptions from garages, back-
 yards, vacant lots, and other unguarded
 areas used by small children as play-
 grounds.
 Their combined efforts have brought
 much favorable publicity to the city of
 Los Angeles and particularly to the San
 Fernando Valley.  But, more Important,
 I commend these citizents to you because
 of the safety legislation their efforts have
 inspired on the Federal, State, and city
 levels regulating and enforcing Installa-
 tions of safety devices in the manufac-
 ture of refrigerators, such as snap locks
 which can be opened from the inside of
 such appliances.
 Mr. Speaker, I feel deeply and con-
 scientiously that such a dedicated effort
 in my congressional district cannot go
 unaoclalmed for long, and I respectfully
 submit it to you and my colleagues In
 this House for the recognition it so rich-
 ly deserves.

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, May 6, 1965
 Mr. HALPERN. Mr. Speaker, on April
 8 I included in the RECORD a report on
 the conditions of Army basic combat
 training. This is a relevant issue when
 we speak of the need for reforming our
 military draft system, to make it more
 equitable and also more worthwhile from
 a military point of view.
 I asked the Department of the Army
 for its comments on this report.  I am
 pleased to learn that basic combat train-
 ing, according to Lt. Gen. J. L. Richard-
 son, Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel,
 has undergone some fundamental im-
 grams   or   organized   teaching   programs.
 This would make both the research and the
 teaching more productive.
 The passage of H.R. 3140, with suitable
 modifications, is supported by the adminis-
 trative committee of the University of Min-
 nesota College of Medical Sciences as a means
 not only of extending existing programs but
 also as a means of developing a more ade-
 quate system for medical research and train-
 ing and for more rapid application of new
 methods of diagnosis and therapy in medical
 practice.
 We invite your careful consideration of
 these recommendations.  We are continuing
 our intensive study of this proposed legisla-
 tion, and we shall subsequently present to
 you further and more specific suggestions.
 With best personal wishes, I am
 sincerely yours,
