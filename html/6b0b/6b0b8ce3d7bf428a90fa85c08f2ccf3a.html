 Far East
 VIETNAM
 Despite heavy monsoon  rains
 during the past week, allied troops
 had several successful encounters
 with Communist forces in the cen-
 tral highlands of Pleiku Province
 and on the coastal flatlands of
 Quang Tin Province.
 US forces participating in
 Operation PAUL REVERE II estab-
 lished heavy contact with a large
 enemy force on 14 August in the
 Chu Pong Mountain area in south-
 western Pleiku Province.   The bulk
 of the Communist force apparently
 eluded the attempted encirclement
 maneuver, however, and may have
 taken refuge in Cambodia.   Eleven
 allied battalions are continuing
 to sweep western Pleiku in an ef-
 fort to trap elements of four
 North Vietnamese Army regiments
 believed to be operating in the
 area.   Nearly 600 enemy soldiers
 have been killed since 1 August.
 In a day-long engagement  on 13
 August between South Vietnamese
 Marines and a Communist force of
 unknown size, 195 enemy troops
 were killed and five captured in
 Operation COLORADO/LIEN KET 52,
 northwest of Tam Ky in Quang Tin
 Province.
 A reinforced battalion of US
 Marines landed on the beaches of
 Phuoc Tuy and Binh Tuy provinces
 about 100 miles east of Saigon on
 16 August.   This marine operation
 --DECK HOUSE III--is intended to
 provide a blocking force for US -
 South Vietnamese Operation TOLEDO,
 which began on 9 August in Long
 Khanh and Binh Tuy provinces.   No
 significant contact has developed
 so far in this search for some
 4,450 Viet Cong troops reported
 to be in the area.
 Viet Cong guerrillas initiated
 a flurry of harassing actions
 against allied military targets in
 widely separated areas of the coun-
 try.   Although no firm trend is
 yet discernible, it has been antici-
 pated that the Communists might step
 up such activity prior to South
 Vietnam's 11 September elections,
 not only to intimidate voters, but
 also to offset the lack of any
 major Communist victory during the
 past several months.
 At least one effective ambush
 and five mortar and small-arms at-
 tacks were conducted by the Viet
 Cong on 16 and 17 August against
 allied military targets.   Also on
 17 August, Viet Cong terrorists,
 exploded a bomb at a fairground;in
 Hue, killing 30 South Vietnamese
 and injuring many more.
 South Vietnamese Elections
 On 12 August, the Saigon
 government issued the final list
 of 542 candidates for the 108
 seats in the 11 September elec-
 tions for a constitutional as-
 sembly.   Voluntary withdrawals
 contributed significantly to the
 high rate of attrition since 1
 July, when the initial posting
 showed 629 principal candidates
 and some 100 alternates.   The
 Central Election Review Council
 received only 42 complaints

 closely related to an increas-
 ing attack-sortie rate over more
 hazardous areas then to any im-
 portant improvement in North
 Vietnamese air defense.   The air
 war over North Vietnam was
 stepped up significantly on 29
 and 30 June with the attacks
 on the Hanoi-Haiphong area, and
 in the following month US air-
 c.r.at t losses   ncreased corre-
 -pondingly.   For example, only 21
 US planes were lost in 3,429
 sorties over North Vietnam in
 June.   In Jul%7, however, when
 the number of sorties rose to
 1,370 and US aircraft attacked
 more heavily defended areas,  42
 planes were lost.   August losses
 thus far are comparable to those
 of July.
 DRV Dispersal of Industry
 North Vietnam's propaganda
 claims of a stepped-up program
 of industrial decentralization
 and dispersal to minimize vul-
 nerability to air attack does
 not appear to have been imple-
 mented extensively.   The share
 of resources a.located to build-
 ing small plants is larger this
 year than lasts  and some exist-
 ing small plants have been moved
 out of urban areas, but there
 is no evidence of any intention
 to move the country's few large,
 modern industrial facilities
 out of the Hanoi.-Haiphong area
 where many of them are concen-
 trated.
 The develocppment of local
 industry according to Hanoi's
 plans will enh4n.ce self-suffi-
 ciency in rural areas that might
 be isolated by!air attacks, and
 will reduce to !,some extent the
 burden on the transportation
 system.   It is!likely to result
 in  some decline in production
 however, and will not eliminate
 the need to import machinery and
 raw materials ri.eeded by the food,
 textile, and machine building
 industries that constitute the
 core of the modern industrial
 sector.

 CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS I N LAOS
 Limited concessions by Pre-
 mier Souvanna seem to have satis-
 fied enough of the National As-
 sembly's demands for a greater
 political role to preserve the
 delicate balance within his gov-
 ernment.
 National Assembly members,
 chafing under their limited par-
 ticipation in the government,
 had served notice on Souvanna
 that the assembly session which
 convened in early August would
 bring sharp attacks on the gov-
 ernment ministries as well as
 pressure for an enlarged and re-
 organized cabinet.   The members
 reportedly wanted three vacant
 secretary of state positions--
 comparable to deputy ministers
 --filled.   They also were press-
 ing for the replacement of the
 four long-absent Pathet Lao
 cabinet members.
 Souvanna responded by agree-
 ing to appoint secretaries of
 state for finance, rural affairs,
 and sports and youth.   However,
 to retain at least the facade of
 tripartite government, he has
 refused to replace the absent
 Communists in his cabinet.
 urged an accommodation with the
 Pathet Lao.
 The increasingly powerful
 General Staff has declared its
 support of the present govern-
 ment and has sought to moderate
 assembly demands.   In return,
 the General Staff will reportedly
 press for the appointment of a
 military figure as minister of
 defense.   Souvanna holds this
 portfolio himself and is reluc-
 tant to give it to either of the
 two most-likely candidates--the
 already powerful Generals Kou-
 prasith and Ouane.   It is un-
 likely that he will acquiesce
 in the army's demand.
 Meanwhile, the present rainy
 season has allowed government
 guerrilla forces to make limited
 gains in military operations in
 northern Laos.  An attempt in
 early August to retake the area
 around Nam Bac north of Luang
 Prabang--long held by the Pathet
 Lao--has  apparently been success-
 ful.   The Communists offered lit-
 tle resistance to government and
 guerrilla forces, possibly ex-
 pecting to retake the positions
 when the dry season begins.
 In addition, Souvanna may
 accept the resignation of neutral-
 ist Minister of Interior Pheng
 Phongsavan, long a target of the
 assembly because of his leftist
 tendencies.   Souvanna's accept-
 ance of Pheng's resignation at
 this time--it has been tendered
 on earlier occasions--would mark
 the further decline of those in
 the Laotian Government who have

 NORTH KOREA DECLARES IDEOLOGICAL INDEPENDENCE
 North Korea has declared its
 independence within the world
 Communist movement by chiding
 both Peking and Moscow.   The dec-
 laration came in an article mark-
 ing the anniversary of Korea's
 liberation from Japanese rule.
 The article "Let Us Defend
 Independence" in Pyongyang's
 leading party newspaper, Nodong
 Sinmun, on 12 August, was the
 culmination of a long series of
 moves away from a pro-Chinese
 policy.   Although not mentioning
 Peking by name,  the article
 clearly rejected recent Chinese
 claims for leadership of the
 movement and declared that one
 country cannot lead the world
 revolution or serve as its center
 Nodong Sinmun approved Mos-
 cow's call for a united front
 among Communist states against US
 actions in Vietnam.   It balanced
 this,  however, by criticizing
 "revisionism" and issuing a warn-
 ing--by implication as much to
 Moscow as to Peking--that "it is
 impermissible to infringe on the
 independence of another country
 under the pretext of cooperation
 among the fraternal countries."
 Although clearly bidding for in-
 dependence in this earlier arti-
 cle, Pyongyang underscored a de-
 sire for warm relations with Mos-
 cow in a subsequent editorial in
 Nodong Sinmun on 15 August.
 Pyongyang has been moving
 toward warmer relations with Mos-
 cow since the change of Soviet
 leadership inOctober 1964. The
 new Soviet leaders,  in an ef-
 fort to re-establish influence
 in Korea, offered economic and
 military aid and adopted a pol-
 icy of moderation in the Sino-
 Soviet dispute.   In pursuance
 of this policy, Premier Kosygin
 visited North Korea in February
 1965.
 The Soviet Union also has
 made a major economic aid com-
 mitment.   An agreement signed
 in Moscow on 22 June promises
 Soviet assistance in installing
 a hot and cold steel rolling
 mill,  and in building a thermal
 power plant it  Pukchang,  an oil
 refinery,  an ammonia plant,  and
 other industrial projects. The
 agreement also envisages a
 significant increase in trade
 through 1970.

 A NEW TEAM I N PEKING
 First accounts of a mammoth
 rally held in Peking on 18 August
 to celebrate the "cultural revo-
 lution" indicate that the old
 hierarchy, strained by the inter-
 nal struggles of the past ten
 months, has been shaken up.
 Defense Minister Lin Piao
 was the principal speaker at the
 rally.  Named the "dearest comrade
 in arms" of Mao Tse-tung and
 seated at Mao's left on the plat-
 form, Lin appears to have replaced
 Chief of State Liu Shao-chi as the
 second man in the regime.   Liu was
 present but did not speak, and was
 listed eighth in the line-up of
 attending officials.   General Sec-
 retary Teng Hsiao-ping also failed
 to participate and was sixth in
 the lineup.    Premier Chou En-lai,
 the only member of Mao's inner cir-
 cle whose position in the power
 structure seems unchanged, was
 listed third and sat to Mao's
 right.
 A major surprise was the re-
 appearance of Chen Yun, once the
 party's top economic specialist,
 who went into limbo after bitterly
 criticizing "leap forward" methods
 in 1959.   Although Chen has made
 a few unimportant ceremonial ap-
 pearances since, this is his first
 appearance in many years at a turn-
 out designed to display elite lead-
 ers.
 The basis for the new line-up
 was probably established during the
 last days of the 1 to 12 August
 central committee plenum.   Peking's
 accounts of the meeting and the
 bland communique` issued at its
 close appear designed to convey the
 impression that top-level conflicts
 had been resolved and that all
 party leaders were united under Mao.
 It now appears, however,  that
 the top party conclave--the first
 of its kind in four years--was the
 scene of sharp debate.   This is
 suggested by indications of disar-
 ray in the party press while the
 meetings were in session.
 On 10 August the authoritative
 ideological journal Red Flag de-
 manded that the "cultural -revolu-
 tion" focus on bringing down power-
 ful party figures who had gone
 astray.   A central committee de-
 cision, publicized on 8 August, had
 stated that errant party leaders
 were targets of the drive.   This
 statement did not, however, take as
 strong a position as that put for-
 ward in Red Flag.   An editorial in
 People's Daily on 11 August also did
 not  ollow the extreme line taken by
 Red Flag the previous day.   A fol-
 low-up editorial in the People's
 Daily on 13 August omitted any ref-
 erence to the need for attacks on
 important party figures.

 The 11 August issue of
 People's Daily was pulled off
 the streets in order to delete
 a picture story about Mao. The
 story appeared the next day with
 only minor changes, but the re-
 call of People's Daily was un-
 precedented.
 The entire pattern of events
 raises the possibility that Mao
 had been pushing the extreme
 position on dealing with errant
 party leaders but encountered
 strong opposition from those who
 might have been threatened by
 this stand.
 All indications are that
 the politicai cauldron is still
 bubbling in Peking and the situa-
 tion at the top remains unstable.
 The shape of1the emerging new
 power structure is still unclear,
 but it reflects shifts that could
 profoundly affect the course of
 Chinese policy.

 PREPARATIONS CONTINUE FOR LARGE WARSAW PACT EXERCISE
 The Czech press is billing
 the week-long Warsaw Pact Ex-
 ercise "Vltava"--to be held dur-
 ing the last half of September
 in southwestern Czechoslovakia--
 as the largest maneuver in Eu-
 rope since the war by either the
 Warsaw group or NATO.
 Czech ground and frontier
 troops are to be augmented dur-
 ing the exercise by large con-
 tingents of East German and
 Hungarian forces,  and by the
 simultaneous air and rail move-
 ment of elements of several air-
 borne and ground force divisions
 from the USSR.   Previous exer-
 cises have occasionally featured
 either air, ground., or sea re-
 inforcement from the USSR, but
 the first two methods have never
 before been combined.
 In addition to such innova-
 tions as the combat use of tele-
 vision during the exercise, the
 Czechs have promised a massive
 parade at Ceske Budejovice after
 the exercise.   The parade may in-
 clude the first public display
 in Czechoslovakia of such weap-
 ons  as  the FROG-7 tactical rocket
 or the ZSU-23-4 self-propelled
 antiaircraft gun.   These were
 shown for the first time in Mos-
 cow last November and were also
 in the Warsaw parade last month.
 As in the case of last year's
 major exercise,  "October Storm,"
 the Warsaw Pact governments prob-
 ably intend their heavy advance
 publicity to minimize public ap-
 prehension over the military ac-
 tivity as well as to achieve an
 optimum propaganda impact.   An
 additional cobsideration this
 year is the desire to stress the
 Hungarian Arm 's recovery from
 the effects of the revolt ten
 years ago.   To emphasize this
 point, Moscow has apparently de-
 cided not to include the Soviet
 forces in Hungary in the "Vltava"

 MOSCOW PRESSES DIPLOMATIC CAMPAIGN TO ISOLATE US
 Moscow is using the issues
 of Vietnam and European security
 to mount an increasingly broad
 diplomatic campaign aimed at
 arousing international opposi-
 tion to US policies.
 Soviet ambassadors have
 warned their host governments of
 the gravity of the situation in
 Vietnam and, depending on the
 inclination of the government,
 have encouraged them to urge re-
 straint on the US  (e.g., Denmark,
 Sweden,  and Mexico)  or to criti-
 cize it openly  (e.g., Cyprus,
 India,  and Somalia).   The So-
 viets also emphasized the grow-
 ing danger of the Vietnam war
 to UN Secretary General Thant
 in the hope of getting him to
 join in bringing pressure on the
 US.
 At the same time, the Rus-
 sians are continuing their ef-
 forts to keep the question of
 European security open as a
 means of exploiting Western dis-
 unity.   They are dangling the
 prospect of an East-West detente
 to induce Western European coun-
 tries to press Washington and
 Bonn to abandon plans for a West
 German role in NATO nuclear
 sharing.
 Without committing itself
 to any course of action, Moscow
 is encouraging the impression
 that it is willing to engage in
 fruitful discussions of outstand-
 ing East-West issues,  and that
 US  "aggressive" policy in Viet-
 nam and Europe is the only ob-
 stacle to such discussions.   A
 Soviet demarche on European se-
 curity, made last week to the
 British foreign secretary,  is
 part of this effort.   The Soviet
 chargd in London sought to im-
 press the foreign secretary with
 Soviet "sincerity and flexibility"
 on European security.   Soviet
 propaganda also is stressing
 Moscow's willingness to discuss
 this question, but has not clearly
 defined when or with whom.   The
 Soviets have made clear, however
 --most recently in Premier Kosy-
 gin's speech to the Supreme So-
 viet on 3 August, the day of the
 demarche to London--that the
 existence of "two German states"
 within their present borders is
 to be a point of departure, not
 discussion,  for any talks on
 the subject.
 Despite the diplomatic ac-
 tivity capitalizing on the Viet-
 nam and European security ques-
 tions,                                                                              there is no sign that
 Moscow is preparing any construc-
 tive initiative.   In their dis-
 cussions on Vietnam,  Soviet dip-
 lomats have been quick to dis-
 claim that Moscow has any com-
 petence to act toward ending the
 conflict.

 NEVV SOVIET TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS
 The USSR has revised its list
 of areas closed to travel by for-
 eigners.   The revision represents
 the first official change in travel
 restrictions since August 1959.
 With the changes, 23
 percent of Soviet territory is
 now officially closed as compared
 to 26.5 percent before.   Although
 the newly closed areas are less
 extensive than those opened, they
 are of greater strategic signifi-
 cance.
 The Taymyr Peninsula, Sever-

 Many of the newly closed areas

 closed cities.
 Many of the previously closed
 areas have been carried over with-

 concentrations of ground forces are
 located remain secure from the eyes
 of foreigners,  as do the newer in-

 TITO MOVES AGAINST LIBERAL CRITICS IN YUGOSLAVIA
 By arresting archcritic
 Mihajlo Mihajlov and suppressing
 the philosophical journal Praxis,
 the Yugoslav regime has again dem-
 onstrated that domestic critics
 will not be permitted to challenge
 the Communist Party's fundamental
 authority.   The regime has acted
 with restraint, however,  in an at-
 tempt to minimize adverse reaction
 both at home and abroad.
 Mihajlov first got into trou-
 ble last year because of his ar-
 ticles criticizing the lack of
 literary freedom in the Soviet Un-
 ion.   Arrested but freed on ap-
 peal, he has since bombarded the
 Western press with articles de-
 signed to embarrass the Yugoslav
 regime and to publicize himself as
 a second Djilas.   He recently
 scheduled a meeting of his follow-
 ers to found a new opposition
 journal.   The meeting was announced
 in an open letter to Tito which de-
 nounced the one-party system and
 challenged Tito to prove that Yugo-
 slavs are free in practice as well
 as in theory.
 The regime's handling of the
 case has been adept so far.   Ini-
 tially, the security authorities
 only detained Mihajlov and allowed
 the meeting to take place.   Indi-
 rect official pressure resulted in
 very small attendance, however,
 and was intended to expose Mihajlov
 as a radical without significant
 support.
 This careful handling was
 prompted by the regime's sensitiv-
 ity to Western criticism particu-
 larly now when Western support is
 needed for the country's economic
 reform. An anti-Western and anti-
 American line is nevertheless
 emerging in semiofficial criticism,
 the Yugoslav press having accused
 Mihajlov of being an American agent
 and accepting large sums of money
 from the West. Should Mihajlov con-
 tinue his activities,the regime may
 link him to foreign intelligence
 circles.
 Although less publicized in
 the West, the Praxis group actually
 presents the rege with a more se-
 rious challenge,f',or they want to
 reform the party from within. The
 group emphasizes! the humanistic as-
 pects of Marxism' and urges greater
 consideration of the individual, a
 line the party theoretically could
 accept.
 The growing popularity of
 Praxis--when the regime wants to
 restrain the liberals after the
 fall of the conservative Rankovic
 --probably led to its suppression.
 There is evidence, however,  that
 the group will continue its efforts,
 possibly by publishing in Filozofia,
 the quarterly of the Croatian Phil-
 osophical Society.   The group also
 may expand its editorial board to
 include philosophers from Belgrade,
 thus broadening its national base.
 In any event, the Praxis group,
 with its carefully reasoned criti-
 cisms and its willingness to bend
 to pressure without abandoning its
 precepts, continues to attract ad-
 herents. As a result,the regime may
 ultimately find it necessary to
 carry its liberalization policy

 Middle East - Africa
 SYRIA AND ISRAEL CLASH AGAIN
 The increasingly belligerent
 posture adopted by both Israel and
 Syria in the wake of the 15 August
 border clash may lead to further
 and perhaps more serious exchanges.
 The latest incident, in which
 two Syrian MIGs were shot down,
 apparently began when an Israeli
 patrol boat ran aground close to
 the eastern shoreline of the Sea
 of Galilee (Lake Tiberias)  after
 firing on Syrian positions.   Al-
 though Israel claims sovereignty
 over the Sea,  Israeli boats had
 for several years refrained from
 approaching closer than about 250
 meters to the shore.
 Syria has long been the most
 militantly anti-Israel of the Arab
 states.   It has actively supported
 the Fatah terrorists by providing
 training facilities and a propa-
 ganda outlet,  in contrast to Leba-
 non and Jordan, whose governments
 have opposed terrorist operations.
 Following the 15 August incident,
 Syrian authorities stated that
 Syria would no longer complain to
 the United Nations,  but would
 counter further Israeli "provoca-
 tions" by striking inside Israel.
 In recent months, Israel has
 adopted a harder line toward Syria
 regarding raids into Israel by
 Fatah terrorists.   On 14 July, in
 retaliation for a series of border
 incidents, Israeli planes destroyed
 equipment at the site of the Syrian
 water diversion project in the area
 east of the Sea of Galilee.   In the
 past, Israeli troops had made re-
 prisal raids against alleged Fatah
 bases in Lebanon and Jordan, but
 this was the first time that Fatah
 actions drew Israeli retaliation
 directly against Syria.
 In a 12 August speech, Is-
 raeli Chief of Staff Rabin warned
 that Israel would continue to hold
 Syria responsible for Fatah activ-
 ities and implied immediate re-
 taliation.   Following the 15 Au-
 gust incident,  Rabin authorized
 "hot pursuit" in the event of an-
 other air clash.
 Even if Damascus should de-
 cide to curtail Fatah activities,
 it is possible that local Syrian
 commanders on the Israeli border
 would permit--or even encourage--
 infiltrators in direct contradic-
 tion of orders from Damascus.

 Belgium's educational assistance

 to make limited concessions re-
 garding certain Belgian economic

 It hopes to accomplish this by
 developing a multilateral aid

 NIGERIA'S FUTURE STILL UNCERTAIN
 The first round of what are
 likely to be involved and pro-
 longed talks on future regional
 relationships ended in Lagos late
 last week.   Representatives have
 returned to their home regions to
 assess their bargaining power and
 prepare for the second round,
 scheduled for the end of this
 week.   Meanwhile,  the tribal
 sorting-out of the army is under
 way, with the return of eastern
 troops from units in the North
 and the repatriation of northern
 troops who had been serving in
 the East.
 During the first round of
 talks, easterners reportedly
 tried unsuccessfully to pressure
 fence-sittincx mid-westerners to
 join them in supporting a seces-
 sionist position.
 Although northern delegates
 to the consultations have so far
 been counseling moderation,  sep-
 aratist feelings are also running
 high in the North.   In a 15 Au-
 gust conversation with the US
 consul in Kaduna,  the secretary
 to the northern military govern-
 ment said he saw no prospect for
 future close association with
 the East.   He indicated,  for the
 first time, that any continuing
 ties would have to add up to
 something looser than a federa-
 tion, and he seemed prepared to
 accept the destruction of Ni-
 geria's international identity.
 At present,  however,  some
 prominent northerners are evi-
 dently still arguing against such
 a breakup.   Western Nigeria's
 Yorubas,  led by their Chief Awo-
 lowo, who clearly hopes to emerge
 on top of a continuing federation,
 are also endeavoring to check the
 strong separatist currents ema-
 nating from the East and North.
 The troop exchanges should
 cut down on the possibility of
 tribal violence within the army
 units but will most probably lead
 to the army' further deteriora-
 tion as a national force. Even-
 tually all Hausa soldiers will
 probably have to be returned to
 the North,  including the contin-
 gent at Ike-'141  barracks outside
 Lagos.   Although Supreme Com-
 mander Gowon continues to return
 there for sa 'ety each night, he
 evidently still has only limited
 control over-its hard-core north-
 ern elements who largely brought
 him to power.
 The return of the eastern
 troops to Eni.gu has given east-
 ern military' governor Ojukwu an
 independent power base should
 he decide tojbreak from the fed-
 eration.   He !, can count on a well-
 armed,  all-Ibo battalion in any
 future confrontation with Gowon,
 whose authority he still has not
 formally acknowledged.
 A major question is whether
 Ojukwu has sufficient regional
 backing to make such a move. He
 has already been acting with
 considerable! independence and
 can be expected to cooperate with
 the provisional central. govern-
 ment only as it serves eastern
 interests.  His independence has
 made it difficult for Gowon to
 consolidate his shaky regime by
 bringing leading citizens from
 all over the country into the

 YEMENI PRESIDENT'S RETURN BRINGS CRISIS
 President Sallal has re-
 turned to Yemen from Cairo in
 what appears to be a desperate
 effort to counter growing anti-
 Egyptian feeling.   Despite his
 unpopularity with Yemenis and
 Egyptians alike,  Sallal remains
 the only major revolutionary fig-
 ure upon whom Nasir can depend.
 However, his return has brought
 Egypt and Yemen to the brink of
 a major crisis.
 For the last nine months
 Sallal had remained virtually a
 prisoner in Egypt.   His ineffec-
 tiveness and unpopularity in
 Yemen had made him a symbol of
 the failing Yemeni revolution and
 a liability to Egyptian inter-
 ests.   Meanwhile, Premier al-Amri,
 a tough army officer who formerly
 backed Sallal to the hilt, took
 control in Yemen.   The erosion of
 Amri's authority under Egyptian
 pressure, however, gradually
 forced most of the disparate
 elements of republican Yemen into
 one loosely knit,  anti-Egyptian
 group.
 As Egyptian influence
 slipped,  Sallal,  the progenitor
 of the Yemeni revolution, became
 Nasir's chief' remaining asset in
 Yemen politics.   So long as he
 remained faithful to Cairo, oppo-
 sition political leaders could
 always be discredited as "im-
 perialists" and "reactionaries,"
 and charged with being in secret
 contact with the royalist en-
 emies.
 With complete Egyptian eco-
 nomic and military control of
 Yemen,  Sallal's temporary suc-
 cess seems a foregone conclu-
 sion.                                                                               Nevertheless, Egyptian
 high-handednes1s may eventually
 force the republicans--particu-
 larly the tribesmen--into rec-
 onciliation with the royalists.

 CONTROVERSY OVER UNIVERSITY CONTROL IN ARGENTINA
 President Ongania is con-
 tinuing to wrestle with the prob-
 lem of the national universities
 in the face of numerous faculty
 resignations and extensive con-
 troversy over university autonomy.
 Ongania had hoped to reopen
 the University of Buenos Aires
 and several other national uni-
 versities--closed since the re-
 gime's 29 July declaration that
 their operation would be subject
 to direct federal control--on
 16 August.   However, the mass
 resignations that followed the
 closing of the universities have
 left several faculties of the
 University of Buenos Aires with
 greatly reduced teaching staffs.
 This,  combined with continued
 public concern over the changes
 and the possibility of student
 demonstrations, has apparently
 led the government to postpone
 their  reopening  until 22 August.
 The additional time will be
 used by the government to ex-
 plain its university policy to
 the public and to permit new
 university officials, appointed
 on 12 August, to establish them-
 selves in their jobs.
 Argentina's eight national
 universities, traditionally
 governed by a board composed of
 faculty,  students, and alumni,
 have been autonomous in their
 operations.   By tradition,  au-
 tonomy has also meant that uni-
 versity campuses were outside
 the government's legal jurisdic-
 tion and off-limits for police.
 While the end of autonomy may
 lead to more scholastic disci-
 pline and to less student con-
 trol over university affairs,
 faculty members fear that gov-
 ernment control will also mean
 the end of teaching freedom and
 will put pressure on them to
 adhere to the conservative,
 church-oriented beliefs of some
 government leaders.
 The ending of university
 autonomy has been the most con-
 troversial of the reforms yet
 attempted by Ongania.   The ex-
 tent of foreign and domestic
 criticism and the high number of
 faculty resignations apparently
 surprised the government,  forc-
 ing it to defend its position.
 President Ongania,  for his part,
 has assured the public that he
 does not intend to prevent or
 restrict academic freedom.  How-
 ever,  several key cabinet mem-
 bers and government advisers
 are known to believe that the
 faculty and students of the Uni-
 versity of Buenos Aires include
 Communists who must be "weeded
 out."   Pressures from right-wing
 circles in the regime could well
 mean that the government will
 exert a great degree of control
 over the curriculum as well as
 over the operations of the

 POLITICAL TENSIONS IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 President Joaquin Balaguer
 on 11 August called for a vaguely
 defined political truce and asked
 for legislation banning certain
 types of political activity for
 almost two years.   The proposed
 law,  according to Balaguer, per-
 mits routine party business and
 "merciless" censure of his gov-
 ernment.
 The intent of the proposed
 law is obscure.   The US ambassa-
 dor feels that opposition leader
 Juan Bosch's party is the major
 target.   Balaguer, however, said
 it was aimed at curbing extreme
 leftist-inspired political vio-
 lence and agitation.   A presi-
 dential aide described the law
 as a psychological deterrent to
 the regime's opponents.   Whatever
 its intent, the proposal's loose
 wording would risk its use by
 local military and police elements
 to justify throttling the left--
 which in turn might increase its
 attacks on the regime.
 The reaction of the left to
 the proposed law is mixed.
 F-B-osch himself
 asserts that Balaguer is out to
 destroy his party.   Extremists
 have characterized the proposal
 as dictatorial,  and have chal-
 lenged Balaguer to enforce it.
 The fatal shooting of a pop-
 ular former rebel commando leader
 on 12 August has added to polit-
 ical tension.   Although the
 extreme left may have been re-
 sponsible, the popular assumption
 in Santo Domingo is that he was
 gunned down by right wingers.
 The incident touched off outbursts
 of violence,  aggravated by the
 calculated terrorism of the Com-
 munist-oriented 14th of June
 Movement, which has recently step-
 ped up agitation.   The police,
 however, effectively contained
 the disturbances.
 Bosch has indicated to US
 officials that he is very dis-
 turbed and apprehensive over re-
 cent developments.   He alleges
 that he backs the government, but
 feels Balaguer is abusing many
 of the regime's'' supporters.   More-
 over, Bosch has overdrawn the
 gravity of the present situation
 by repeating eltaborate tales of
 right-wing conspiracy--hoping
 perhaps to encourage the reten-
 tion of the Int6r-American Peace
 Force.
 Meanwhile, incipient tension
 between Balaguer and the military
 was eased by an!11 August presi-
 dential statement voicing "abso-
 lute confidence", in top military
 leaders.   In an apparently related
 move, plans for 4 military reor-
 ganization were postponed.   Bala-
 guer's actions, at least for the
 present, have put an end to in-
 tense rumors of an imminent mili-
 tary command shake-up.  Neverthe-
 less, Balaguer is intent on im-
 plementing ambitious military
 reforms which could upset civil-
 military harmony.
