 Mao Tse-tung, 82, appears to be deteriorating rapidly, and China
 is probably already under some degree of "collective" leadership.
 It seems somewhat more likely than not that Mao's domination will be
 succeeded by a group which includes Leftist and Rightist figures but
 which on balance is Centrist.   If such a group in fact accedes to
 power, it is unlikely to make radical changes in either domestic or
 foreign policies in the immediate post-Mao period.   It may slightly
 reduce tension with the USSR, but it -- or almost any other possible
 constellation of successors -- will probably wish to maintain the
 opening to the US.
 A legacy of the Cultural Revolution has seemed to be a "factional"
 leadership below Mao's level, in which many leaders can be credibly
 regarded as Leftist, Centrist, or Rightist, calculated primarily in
 terms of their apparent allegiance to and fervor for Mao's fundamental
 revolutionary objectives.  Mao's latest and current favorite appears
 to be the Centrist Hua Kuo-feng, whom Mao personally named in April
 both as First Vice-Chairman of the Party and as Premier (passing over
 two Leftists who were in line for those posts).  Why did not Mao
 elevate one of the Leftists whose policy predilections are closer to
 Mao's heart?   The apparent answer is that Mao lacked confidence in
 the Leftists' ability to manage Chinese affairs, and that Hua was
 chosen as the most able administrator for the difficult period which
 Mao knew to lie ahead, the nearest thing to another Chou En-lai, who
 was the only one of Mao's principal lieutenants of the past 15 years
 to have remained in Mao's high favor until his death.   Hua was a
 "compromise" -- not one forced on Mao by other leaders, but in the
 sense of Hua's being, like Chou, a man who (as Mao saw it) could be
 relied upon to avoid the excesses repeatedly committed by the Leftists
 while not abandoning Mao's long-term goals as a Rightist would.

 At this time, those with the greatest access to Mao, and in
 the best position to influence whatever decisions he is able to
 make in his last months, appear to be the Centrist Hua Kuo-feng
 and the police figure Wang Tung-hsing, the head of Mao's personal
 bodyguard and of the overall political security apparatus.   Some
 Leftist figures (those passed over when Hua was named) and some
 Rightist figures probably also have some access to Mao, and they
 may be trying to manipulate the old man, maneuvering for position
 in the post-Mao leadership.   It is conceivable that Mao will once
 again, for the fourth time in a decade, change his mind about the
 succession, and, if so, in favor of the Leftists; but it seems
 more likely that Hua will bear the mark of Mao's favor -- for what-
 ever that is worth -- into the post-Mao struggle.
 UNLIKELY, BUT DRAMATIC, POSSIBILITIES
 There are some dramatic and highly disruptive contingencies
 that could occur on Mao's death.   The most important of these are
 a coup employing military and security forces of the Peking Military
 Region (MR), military intervention by some of the leaders of the ten
 MRs outside Peking, and a Soviet attack on China.   An attempted
 coup is a serious possibility; the other two seem most unlikely
 except in the event of a coup.
 The possibility of a coup has to be taken seriously, because
 of the sharp differences among various leaders and because there
 are forces in Peking which could probably bring off a coup, at
 least initially.   The passed-over and unpopular Leftists, fearful
 about their futures, or Rightist military leaders, fearful of the
 Leftists, might conspire with the most important figures of the
 physical security apparatus -- the leaders of the Peking MR and of
 the smaller inner-core forces -- to seize their opponents and even
 the Centrist figures like Hua Kuo-feng who have kept the balance.
 The three key physical security figures, acting just by themselves,
 could probably carry out a successful coup.
 But there are strong countervailing factors.   Neither the
 Leftists nor the Rightists would seem likely to be successful in

 enlisting the cooperation of the key security figures in any coup
 aimed at Hua.   Beyond this, any hypothetical group of conspirators
 would have to have the cooperation or assent of military forces in
 the Peking area, especially the main-force armies of the Peking MR;
 otherwise, the coup could quickly be reversed.  While two of the
 three key physical security figures do in fact command these forces,
 they too would have to face the problem of the morning after -- that
 is, to justify their actions not only to the forces they had employed
 in the coup but to military forces throughout China.   They might be
 sufficiently persuasive -- which is the reason for regarding a coup
 as more than a marginal possibility.   But a coup would carry a high
 risk of splitting the military forces of the Peking MR, leading to
 armed clashes among elements of them, in turn risking the spread of
 armed conflict throughout China to a state of anarchy or civil war.
 This situation would in turn entail the highest risk of Soviet inter-
 vention, a development which almost all of the post-Mao leaders --
 including the physical security figures, who are on record as hard-
 line anti-Soviet -- would wish to avoid.
 Intervention in the succession process by leaders of the MRs
 outside Peking seems most unlikely unless Peking itself is in a
 state of chaos and the conflict has spread further.   As things now
 stand, no single MR could possibly conduct a successful offensive
 against the capital with its own resources, and it would be very
 difficult -- owing to the strict controls all along the line -- for
 the leaders of a group of MRs either to conspire successfully or to
 bring their forces into action.
 The Russians might offer -- especially in a state of civil war --
 to provide substantial material support to a group of MR leaders whom
 they believed to be pro-Soviet, but no such leaders can now be
 identified, nor are the central leaders likely to allow the situation
 to deteriorate to the point that either the MR leaders or the Russians
 would attempt to intervene.   The Regional leaders will probably prove
 to be passive, accepting whatever arrangements are made in Peking
 and anticipating -- with reason -- an increase in their own influence
 with the successor leadership.

 A Soviet attack on China at the time of Mao's death, whether
 or not coordinated with action by MR leaders, seems the least likely
 of the dramatic possibilities.   There is no doubt of the Soviet
 ability to drive deep into the Northeast (without using nuclear
 weapons), but there are many sound military and political reasons
 to refrain from such an attack.  Although a Chinese civil war might
 present a serious temptation to Moscow, even in those circumstances
 there would be many obstacles to a meaningful military or political
 victory for the Russians.
 Beyond this, after Mao's death there will be the fact of a quali-
 tatively new political situation for Moscow to try to exploit.   The
 sensible course for the Russians, with their most implacable enemy
 departed and with a new group in power which is bound to feel insecure,
 will be to talk, not fight.
 AN UNSTABLE "COLLECTIVE"
 Assuming, then, no such dramatic development as a coup, a multi-
 regional revolt, or a Soviet attack, the successors -- even if they
 have been working together reasonably well as a "collective" during
 Mao's deterioration -- will still face a serious problem in distri-
 buting power among themselves in the immediate post-Mao period (meaning,
 a few months).
 There is no one of Mao's stature to turn to as the "natural"
 leader.   Although Hua Kuo-feng might immediately be named Chairman in
 the interest of an appearance of unity, a decision might be made (out
 of respect to Mao's memory) to retire the post of Chairman.   This
 would put Hua on a collision course with the Leftist Chang Chun-chiao,
 the apparent de facto  Secretary-General of the Party now and the other
 principal contender for the topmost place, for the post of de jure
 Secretary-General, which would then be the Party's most important
 position.   It would bring the already contending forces in the leader-
 ship into a crucial conflict at once.

 Assuming that the successors realize the dangers of such a
 conflict and retain the Chairmanship, recognizing Hua as the de facto
 leader and Chang as the (continuing) Secretary-General -- thus dividing
 the power and avoiding a direct confrontation -- Hua might later be
 installed as Chairman.   However, neither Hua nor anyone else as Chairman
 would be able to dominate the Party as Mao had.   Nor, probably, could
 any single faction -- whether Centrist, Leftist, Rightist, or other --
 as power and influence will be widely dispersed.                        The group that
 dominates, both in the immediate post-Mao period and for some time
 beyond, will probably prove to be some combination of the strongest
 figures from all points of the. political spectrum.
 Little is known of the personal character of the key figures --
 for example, the Centrist Hua Kuo-feng, the Leftist Chang Chun-chiao,
 and the two "wild cards," Chen Hsi-lien (the Commander of the Peking
 MR) and Wang Tung-hsing (the policeman), who look to be potentially
 the most powerful individuals.*  Thus it cannot be judged with
 confidence whether they will be able to agree even temporarily on
 what would seem to outsiders an equitable distribution of power.
 Chen and Wang, acting together, might be 'king-makers'  for any group
 of contenders of their choice; opposing one another, they might cause
 great disorder.   On balance, it seems likely that most of the key
 figures, acting from a sense of national interest, will be able to
 agree upon some form of "collective" leadership which conceals the
 extent of their differences.
 There is a credible distribution of power among the most important
 figures which, while probably unstable, might hold for the immediate
 post-Mao period.   The center-line in such a "collective" would run
 through the Center of the Chinese political spectrum as now perceived --
 "moderate" in Chinese terms, although still more "revolutionary" than,
 say, the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.   The
 constellation would be:
 *The term wild card" is used for a leader whose record does not
 permit his classification as Left, Center, or Right, but whose power
 is such that his support would be of great value to any classifiable
 contender.

 Chairman or (if that post is abolished) as Secretary-General;
 -- The Leftist Chang Chun-chiao, 64, as Secretary-General or
 (if Hua gets that post) as Premier;
 -- The Rightist old Marshal Yeh Chien-ying, 78, and the "wild
 card" Chen Hsi-lien, 63, remaining respectively Minister of Defense
 and Commander of the Peking MR, and the principal figures of the
 Military Affairs Committee which controls and directs the armed forces;
 -- The Centrist Chi Teng-kuei, 45, remaining the Party's super-
 visor of organizational work and becoming the back-up for Hua or Chang
 in the Party or governmental structure;
 -- The "wild card" Wang Tung-hsing, 60, continuing in the role of
 the leadership's principal security specialist;
 -- Most of these, plus one of the lesser Leftists -- the now
 second-ranking Vice-Chairman of the Party, young Wang Hung-wen, about 40,
 or Madame Mao, 61, or the propagandist Yao Wen-yuan, about 45 -- as
 composing the bulk of the Politburo Standing Committee, the core of the
 Party power; and
 -- The Rightist Chiao Kuan-hua, 64, the very able protege of
 Chou En-lai, continuing as Foreign Minister.
 A Centrist leadership of this kind would be expected to take
 Centrist positions on three inescapable policy-questions:  the group's
 relationship to Mao's "thought," the concept of "rehabilitation," and
 the Sino-Soviet-American triangle.
 Mao's successors will almost certainly affirm their fidelity to
 his "thought," in the interest of continuity and because they have been
 so intimately associated with his policies.  Whatever degrading of Mao
 in his Stalinist role may eventually occur, it will probably not come

 Approved For Release 2004/07/08 : CIA-RDP79T00889A000800050001-6
 in the immediate post-Mao period.   Some of the disruptive manifestations
 of Mao's "thought" can and very probably will be modified, but quietly,
 employing other aspects of the "thought" to justify this.
 Mao's policy of "rehabilitation" -- of thousands of Party cadres,
 government functionaries, and military leaders brought down in the
 Cultural Revolution, many of whom are again in important posts -- will
 probably be reaffirmed, although many will remain purged.   Some of the
 Leftist leaders would probably like to reverse the "rehabilitation"
 policy -- in effect, to call for another Cultural Revolution, another
 mass campaign to give them domination; but any such initiative would
 probably unite their opponents and result in the downfall of the Leftists.
 Because the military will probably have a strong voice in the
 Centrist leadership, Mao's successors may move to reduce the tension
 in the Sino-Soviet relationship, even in the immediate post-Mao period.
 There is some room for a very limited easing of this tension without
 appearing to repudiate Mao himself.   For example, there seems a good
 chance that the Chinese will quietly modify their demands in the border
 dispute.
 It is not expected, however, that the Chinese will adopt a policy
 of equidistance from the USSR and the US.   The probability seems strong
 that the USSR will remain the "main enemy," and that Mao's successors
 will persist in the policy of attempting to use the US as a strategic
 counterweight to the USSR.   Hua Kuo-feng, who seems to have the best
 chance to be the leading figure of the post-Mao "collective," appears
 to be genuinely committed to this course, and so does the likely Foreign
 Minister.   If for no other reason than that Peking's exploration of the
 potential of the US connection has not yet been completed, almost
 any constellation of post-Mao leaders could be expected to continue the
 process of exploration, even while complaining that the pace of "normali-
 zation" of Sino-American relations is too slow.
