 to          Britain urges prompt coordination on American disarmament
 proposal.-   T e Foreign O  icefl  wring t at  ritain may be un-
 able to support the United States in the UN Disarmament Com-
 mission, requests urgent consideration of British objections
 to the American proposal so that the West can present a
 solid front at next month?s meetings of the commission.   The
 Foreign Office emphasizes that the cabinet will have to
 decide the British position soon, and that Anglo-American
 agreement is necessary to gain maximum propaganda value
 from the commission's-work,
 Britain has been pressing the French Embassy in an
 effort to minimize French objections to the American pro-
 posal.   (S London 5177,  14 May 52)
 Comment.,   Britain objects to the American proposal for
 basing armed forces on population percentages because it
 apparently favors the Western powers, including the Com-
 monwealth countries, over the Soviet bloc.   France, evidently
 not counting some of the countries of South Asia on the
 Western side, believes that the American proposal favors
 the Soviet bloc.
 Britain does not believe that the USSR will accept any
 disarmament proposal, and is interested primarily in gaining
 the propaganda initiative.

 Denmark, Finland, Syria9  the Netherlands, and Bulgaria at-

 religious leaders of the USSR held from 9 to 12 May at

 in religion of all the world," which repeated all the sub-
 jects currently being exploited by Soviet-Communist pro-
 paganda9 particularly the peace lines.   (R Moscow 1813,
 13 May 52)
 Comment:   Activities suggesting that the Communists
 may bee contemplating the establishment of an international
 church front for peace have included invitations to important
 church leaders to visit Moscow; a joint meeting in Paris last
 December of the Commission of Churches for International
 Affairs with World Peace Council members including Joliotm
 Curie "at which misunderstandings were cleared up and another
 meeting considered;" a Conference for Christians for Peace in
 London which, however, got somewhat out of the control of its
 pro-Communist organizers, and peace conferences for clergymen
 in the Satellites.
 Attendance at the Zagorsk conference is believed to have
 fallen below Communist hopes; but continued efforts were fore-
 cast by one of the speakers, who stated that the time had come
 for a world congress of religious leaders of all countries to
 discuss the question of the defense of world peace.

 3.          Soviet Union purchases raw cotton from Pakistan:    Some
 firm  ea s have Been made   etwcen the U S  and  a ratan, ac-
 cording to Amjad Ali, a Pakistan delegate to the Moscow
 Economic Conference and a member of the Pakistan delegation
 to the UN.   He said the Soviet Union had placed a small
 order for raw Pakistani cotton, and that delivery had already
 been made.   (C New York 517,  14 May 52)
 Comment:   While such an order may be only a token purchase
 on the part of the USSR, it serves to strengthen Moscow's
 propaganda on its desire for enlarged trade.   It also points
 up an increasing Soviet effort to expand commercial relations
 in the South Asia area.

 Delos the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly re-
 cently awarded the Order of Motherhood Glory 1st Class to
 a number of Bulgarian mothers who ha,d given birth toe reared,
 and educated eight or more children,                                    25X1A
 Comment-.  Government efforts to increase the Bulgarian
 birth ra es   ave been reflected both in the institution of
 such decorations as the "Order of Motherhood Glory" and in
 the enactment of laws extending special benefits to pro-
 lific mothers.   An additional incentive was given by the
 1951 Decree on Encouraging Childbirth, according to which
 "all unmarrie w oc wrn       4 d, an  divorced Bulgarian and
 foreign citizens without children  who reside: in Bulgaria
 and who are between the ages of 21 and 45 for women and 21
 and 50 for men are required to pay a tax amounting to 5
 percent of their income."
 5.         Increase in Soviet signal personnel reported in Budapest-.
 The
 there are now more Soviet soldiers in Budapest than  as    a
 The Military Attache discounts the rumored presence of 159000
 additional troops, but has observed a noticeable increase in
 the number of Soviet supply and signal personnel in Budapest.
 He believes that the predominance of signal troops and
 equipment may indicate possible establishment of a Soviet
 signal center in Budapest.   (S Budapest           12 May 52)
 Comment-.   An increase in signal troops may possibly be
 accounted  or by known Soviet efforts to augment signal
 communications facilities between the USSR and the European
 Satellites.   Another possible explanation is suggested by
 Soviet interest in the construction of an underground air
 defense center reportedly near completion on Gellert Hill
 in Budapest.

 6.          Japanese react favorably to US stand on POW exchange-.
 Japanese press reaction to    a  ores  nice  erms  a-s been
 roughly divided between editorials strongly supporting the
 United States stand on POW exchange and those expressing hope
 that the negotiations would be continued, according to Ambas-
 sador Murphy.   There have been no reports unfavorable to the
 American position and no Communist treatment of the subject
 is evident.   Murphy comments that, having been sheltered by
 the occupation so long, the Japanese do not react as keenly
 on this matter as its importance to Japan would normally
 warrant,   (C Tokyo 132, 15 May 52)
 Comment-. The failure of the Japan Communist Party to
 make an issue of the  United States stand on exchange of POW's
 may be due to the suspicion that such a campaign would either
 be ineffective or would leave the party open to criticism of
 the Soviet failure to account for World War II Japanese POW's.

 9..           New jet superior to the MIG-15 reported in China:   A
 concludes that the power potential is not being fully utilized,
 The latest photographs reveal that there has been no recent
 augmentation of the Korean facilities, that no additional
 transmission lines are apparent and that the operating capaci-
 ty is less than that of 19450   (S CINCFE Telecon 5823, 15 May 52)
 Comment:  The total operating capacity of the North
 KoreanTiydraelectric system in August 1945 was approximately
 729,000 kilowatts.   In view of the destruction of industrial
 installations and the lack of transmission facilities to
 private consumers, North Korea probably still has a surplus
 of available electric power.

 India has, however, rejected a Peiping proposal to ship
 10,000 tons of food and other supplies to Tibet via India and
 to sell grain to India.   New Delhi took the view that the
 request for transit facilities should not be tied to the grain
 offer, and that in any case Tibet's transport facilities were
 inadequate for handling such large quantities.

 The Embassy assumes that Peiping will accept the Indian
 offer quickly in order to relieve a serious food shortage in
 Tibet.   (C New Delhi 4209, 14 May 52)
 Comment:   The Peiping regime has been expected to seek
 Indian cooperation in alleviating the?food shortage in Tibet.
 India's partial compliance with the Peiping request was
 presumably designed to conciliate Communist China without con-
 tributing substantially to Chinese strength in Tibet.

 Comment: Rumors of this sort have been reported from
 variousTries during the past few months.   A report in
 the 11 May issue of a French weekly claimed that a high French
 -official had met a brother-in-law of Mao Tse-tung in Geneva
 to discuss Indochina4
 Various French officials have categorically denied any
 intention of making armistice overtures to the Viet Minh,
 Minister Resident Letourneau recently repeated these denials,
 but also stated that the door to some sort of arrangement with
 the Viet,Minh has not been closed.

 the American company which built the plant to supply tech-
 nicians to operate it.   (C Tehran 4414, 14 May 52)
 Comment,   Iran has been able to produce crude oil and
 some s mefined products for internal consumption since
 oil nationalization.   The lubricating plant, which was
 completed shortly before the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company withdrew
 from Iran, has never been operated, however, and Iran has been
 forced to import lubricants.   Failure to put this installation
 into production will necessitate continued dependence on out-
 side supplies and a consequent drain on Iran's scanty foreign
 .'exchange.
 14.           Britain fears consequences of attemptto exclude USSR
 from Tangier,      ter ser sus consi erration t e Brit
 Foreign Office has abandoned the idea of excluding the USSR
 from the Committee of Control in the International Zone of
 Tangier because of the impossibility of maintaining the
 secrecy necessary to prevent the USSR from making a counter
 moves
 The British believe that Spanish participation in. the
 administration could be increased without arousing Soviet in-
 terest in assuming its seat on the Committee of Control.
 (S London 5190, 14 May 52)
 Comment:   Under the 1945 bilateral French-British agree-
 ment esta 571 fishing the present provisional administration in
 Tangier,  the Soviet Union as well as the United States was
 awarded a seat on the Committee of Control, which is the
 ultimate authority in Tangier,  The USSR has thus far refused
 to sit on the same council with a representative of the Franco
 regime, but the Western powers fear that it might exercise
 its prerogative and thus establish a foothold in this strategic
 area.

 Comment.  A former member of the now defunct Executive
 Commit ee o   the Communist Party in South Africa9 Dadoo has
 been a leading promoter of unity among all non-white groups in
 the Union9 which offers the greatest potential threat to
 white rule in South Africa.   Many other prominent Indian and
 native African leaders, like Dadoo, have been officially
 "named" Communist, but9 except in a few cases, the government

 South    scan export cu
 in orme  t e  merlcan  mbassador that manganese exports to all
 destinations will be limited to 500,000 long tons annually.
 A few weeks ago Minister of Economic Affairs Louw estimated
 South Africa's exportable surplus for 1952 at 700,000 tons.
 He now says the drastic cut is necessary as a conservation
 measure, since it is estimated that a higher export rate would
 exhaust known deposits in 50 years.   (S Capetown 89, 13 May 52)
 Comment.  This decision has been reached despite urgent
 American representations to the South African Government for
 increased exports in 1952?   In recent years, about 20 percent
 of American manganese supplies, including stockpile_.require-
 ments, has come from the Union.  This has amounted tows much
 as 400,000 tons a year, or 50 to 60 percent of South Africa's
 total manganese exports.

 Comment:  A meeting between Gruber and Tito9  to discuss an
 Austro- ugoslav "military understanding" among other things9 was
 reportedly considered by the Vienna and Belgrade governments last
 September,   This meeting9 which was strongly opposed by the US
 Legation in Vienna9 failed to materialize.
 The Communist press in Austria is likely to interpret a
 Gruber-Tito meeting as further "proof" that both countries are
 linked to Western defense planning.
 Only minor Communist demonstrations expected in Berlin:
 Althoug  t e TJS Hig  C mmm` ssioner s O  ice in Berlin has expected
 Soviet-created "difficulties" over signing of the Allied-German
 contractual agreement9 it reports that intelligence and police
 agencies have uncovered nothing more tangible in the way of
 specific Communist plans than the fact that the East and West
 Berlin Socialist Unity Parties intend to demonstrate on 20 May.
 American officials in Berlin still anticipate an increasing
 number of incidents before 9 and possibly after 9 the signing of
 the'contractual agreement9 but feel that the situation can be
 regarded with "calmness."   (C Berlin 13439 14 May 52)
 19.         East Germans reportedly organizing defense ministry:
 American army headquarters in Germany cons ders t attt ee pro
 visional appointment of Willi Stoph9 former chief of the East
 German paramilitary police procurement agency 9 to head the
 Ministry of the interior may be merely a "convenient cover" for
 Stoph and several of his associates while they organize a. defense
 ministry.  The new ministry might be formally announced upon the
 ratification of the Allied-West German contractual agreement.

 the Interior-for the purpose of organizing a. defense ministry.
 Heinrich Rau, who became a Soviet citizen in 1935 and led a
 Communist brigade in the Spanish Civil War, is mentioned as
 the government's choice to head the new ministry.
 20.         West German labor rejects anti-rearmament campaign:  The
 West    rman  edera ion of Trade  an ohs has not on y re ected a
 Social Democratic offer to participate in a joint effort against
 the Allied-German contractual agreement and the EDC treaty, but
 is now conducting a vigorous leaflet campaign on purely union
 problems, focusing its members'  attention away from foreign
 policy issues.

 The Federation's chairman claims that Adena.uer's coalition
 is prepared to support the Federation on the projected Trade
 Union law if he can prevent organized labor from actively op-
 posing the treaties.
 Comment.-   The Federation has some six million members;
 its present stand could be a potent factor in reducing op-
 position to the signing of the treaties.
 21.         Belgian controls may stop diversion of some strategic items
 to Orbit.-Emp .-sizing that the Belgan ,plan to control transit
 rade will not stop the shipment of strategic items to the
 Soviet bloc, a Belgian trade official has stated that the plan
 will prevent the diversion of goods originally exported to
 Belgium.   The new regulations will require Belgian shippers to
 present, in addition to a Belgian transit license, a certificate
 authorizing transshipments from the country of origin or COCOM
 country through which the goods may have passed.   This system
 will place the responsibility for any diversion on the origi?
 ating country.
 Belgium has not completed its list of items to be covered
 by the regulations and is waiting for Dutch comments before
 submitting the plan to COCOMO   (S Brussels 1695, 14 May 52)
 Comment.   Although the diversion to the Orbit through
 Belgian ports of items on the Belgian control list may decline,
 a shift to Dutch ports is, expected, since the Netherlands states
 that it will not institute physical controls over transshipments.

 22.            Brazil considering recognition of Bolivia   The Brazilian
 Charge      ,a res  n Vas   ngton informed the State Department
 on 14 May that his government had received satisfactory as-
 surances of Bolivia ?s compliance with its international obli-
 gations and believed that Paz Estenssoro was firmly in control.
 Under the circumstances Brazil felt that extended delay in
 recognizing the present government would be prejudicial to
 Brazilian interests.
 The Charge stated that Brazil was also consulting Chiles
 Peru, Uruguay9 and Venezuela in order to facilitate simultaneous
 action.   (S to Rio de Janeiro 1020, 14 May 52)
 Comment-  After the Cuban 10 March coup, Brazil recognized
 the ne?n Government on 22 March without prior notification
 to other governments9 despite prior assurances that it would
 act simultaneously with certain other Latin America.n countries
 and the United States on 27 March.
 23.         Bolivian decree provides for commission to study national=
 ization o  mines-    res  ent Paz Estenssoro has issued a  scree
 w is  prow  es for the creation of a commission to study
 ""nationalization by expropriation" of mines controlled or owned
 by the Patine, Bochschild9 a.nd Aramayo enterprises.   The com-
 mission9 to be composed mainly of government representative
 is charged with rendering a report on the juridical, economic,
 and technical aspects of "legal expropriation" of these mines
 within 120 days.   (R La Paz 4619 14 May 52)
 Comment-  The tenor of the decree appears stronger than
 Paz" previous indications that nationalization would proceed
 cautiously and for the time being primarily affect exports.
 The Patino management has stated that the mining companies
 will cooperate fully with the government and keep up productio
 since they believe that failure of the present government would
 bring chaos and loss of their investments.
 the MSA agreement may be delayed in
 Chilean Congress o  The U  Embassy in Santiago has stated that
 fEe-MSA agreement, which was sent to the Chilean Congress on
 17 April, may be "shunted aside" because of the copper problem.

 Meanwhile, the Radical Party is trying to win the Communist
 vote for its candidate, and this consideration may tend to hold
 up ratification of the agreement o   Also, a high government
 fficial has said that the agreement may not be ratified until
 after the 4 September presidential election.   (C Santiago,
 D-1304, 7 May 52)
 Comment.-   In general there was little reaction in Chile
 to the T-Wp-ril signing of the MSA agreement, but the 2 May
 denunciation of the US?Chilea.n copper accord provoked new
 leftist criticism of the MSA agreement.   There is now some
 tendency to tie ratification of this agreement to a satisfactory
 copper deal with the US.
 There have been several indications that Socialist-Communist
 forces have agreed to support the Radical-government bloc's
 presidential candidate for a stiff price.   Such collaboratio
 might impede not only ratification of the MSA agreement but also
 the negotiation of a new copper agreement with the United States
 24.          Early returns from Panama's presidential election favor
 Remon.-  Preliminary vote to u a ions from 53 of      precincts
 nama give presidential candidate Jose Rernon about 16 , 000
 votes against 6,000 for Roberto Chiari.   Although Chiari
 continues publicly to claim victory, one of his close friends
 states that in private he is conceding victory to Remon.
 Chiari?s followers claim that ballot boxes in various
 areas were stuffed by the pro?Remon element and that 8 ballot
 boxes in Panama City were stolen and destroyed.   The US Embassy
 reports that the box numbers as well as the numbers of the
 police cars which participated in the theft are public knowledge.
 (C Panama 952, 14 May 52)
 Comment.-   There has apparently been no violent public
 reaction to the alleged and apparently open fraud practiced
 by Remon's adherents.

 1.         French reforms unacceptable to Tunisians:  A Tunisian
 nationalist, sent to the United    ates   y    s party in
 order to line up support in the United Nations, states
 that the French-proposed reforms are completely unaccept-
 able to the Tunisians because they envisage French partici-
 pation in and control over executive and legislative
 branches of the government.
 Moreover, the Tunisians would fare worse under the
 recent proposals for actual French participation in the
 government than under the system of external  French control
 existing before mid-January.   (S,  S/S US t'N Del New York
 810, 13 May 52)
 Comment:   Although the former Chenik cabinet did not
 expect  he French to accept their demands for nn exclusively
 Tunisian executive, legislature, and civil service, it hoped
 for a progressive program including a considerable degree of
 local autonomy.
 2.          Argentina fabricating charges of United States plot:  A
 former OSS and Military Intelligence agent of  zec -Argentine
 nationality has stated that he was arrested and interrogated
 along lines which convinced him  that the Argentine police
 are "all out to uncover a plot by the United States."  He
 added that large numbers of people are being questioned, and
 that this will later receive  wide publicity.
 When the US Embassy asked the Foreign Minister why two
 Argentine employees of the US International Education service
 had been arrested, he replied vaguely that he "hoped to show

 May 52)
 Comment: Government-controlled newspapers and Peron's
 recen -speeches have emphasized the theme that foreigners,
 directed by the United States, are plotting against Peron.
 The police are apparently now trying to collect "evidence"
 to prove American interference in Argentine affairs and
 possibly to justify a demand that all USIE activities be
 terminated.
