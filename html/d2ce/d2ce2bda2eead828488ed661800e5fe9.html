 Hanoi is again taking a harder line in its propaganda output. After a
 brief period when some North Vietnamese spokesmen hinted that the
 National Liberation Front's program need serve only as a set of guiding
 principles for a political settlement in the South, the Communists once
 again seem to be linking any settlement to a more literal acceptance of the
 Front's program. Vietnamese Communist propaganda on the war has also
 become more bellicose, representing the US as being intent on a new
 escalation of the war and promising new counterblows.
 In South Vietnam, enemy units in many areas appear almost ready
 for renewed offensive activity. It is not clear whether intensified military
 action, if and when it comes, will be launched simultaneously throughout
 the country, as was the case in the Tet offensive, or whether it will be
 phased, possibly because of the differing stages of readiness of various unit
 concentrations. In any event, allied B-52 raids and spoiling operations may
 upset the enemy's timetable.
 The week produced additional signs of a trend toward the right in
 the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Mao Tse-Tung issued a proclamation on
 28 July telling militant revolutionaries to stop fighting. He specifically
 condemned those who strike at the army, disrupt communications, and
 kill, burn, and loot. These orders have already had a calming effect,
 although Mao has characteristically left it unclear just how far he wants to
 go in damping the Cultural Revolution. This uncertainty has led to an
 uneven performance by local army commanders in carrying out Mao's new
 dictum.
 The first annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian States
 in Djakarta has provided the occasion for private talks between Malaysian
 Deputy Premier Razak and Philippine Foreign Minister Ramos over the
 Sabah dispute. Although the substance of the dispute-Malaysia's refusal to
 consider the merits of the Philippine claim to Sabah -remains unresolved,
 both countries appear anxious t          wn public polemics over the
 issue

 VIETNAM
 Mounting evidence indicates
 advancing Communist preparations
 for launching attacks in wide-
 spread areas of South Vietnam by
 mid-August.  Allied operations,
 however, may upset the enemy's
 timetable in certain areas.
 Intensive reconnaissance ac-
 tivity by certain of the enemy
 units, coupled with an upturn in
 artillery shelling of allied po-
 sitions below the eastern portion
 of the DMZ, suggest that the Com-
 munists are preparing for larger
 scale attacks.   Enemy moves in
 northern I Corps, however, may
 only be intended to divert atten-
 tion from Quang Nam, Quang Tin,
 and Quang Ngai provinces, where
 the threat of widespread Communist
 attacks has been growing rapidly
 in recent weeks.
 The NVA 2nd Division is de-
 ploying into the Da Nang - Chu
 Lai area and could be in position
 to launch attacks by mid-August.
 Communist units are reported to
 have been spotted moving in the
 An Hoa region and clashes between
 allied and Communist forces
 southwest of Da Nang picked up
 markedly in early August.  I
 iversionary a  ac s were  o  e
 made in the An Hoa area prior to
 an attack on Da Nang.
 Page  3
 There are also continuing
 indications of a build-up of Com-
 munist forces in northwestern III
 Corps.   Prisoners from the NVA
 7th and the Viet Cong 9th divi-
 sions in Binh Long and Binh Duong
 provinces have reported that
 these units are now up to strength
 and are getting ready for major
 actions.  A rallier                    25X1
 I            Istated that he expects
 e o  ensive will begin on or         25X1
 about 15 August.  Another pris-
 oner revealed that he had been en-
 gaged in transporting ammunition
 and supplies from Cambodia since
 15 July and that he understood all
 preparations for a new round of
 attacks were to be completed by
 15 August.
 At present, the enemy's
 forces in the immediate Saigon
 area include at least 14 battal-
 ions of local and Viet Cong and
 North Vietnamese main force units.
 Other units are presumably re-
 fitting in nearby sanctuaries
 and could augment the enemy's
 offensive force in the capital
 city area on short notice.  At
 least eight additional Viet Cong
 main force battalions are re-
 ported en route to the Saigon
 area from provinces in IV Corps.
 Enemy units currently in
 position close to Saigon could

 mount a sizable, but limited,
 assault on the city within the
 next two weeks.     The Communists
 also have the capability of
 launching massive rocket and mor-
 tar bombardments on the city at
 any time.
 Hardening North Vietnamese
 Propaganda Line
 The North Vietnamese have
 reacted to recent public state-
 ments by US officials after the
 Honolulu conference by hardening
 once again their public position
 on the role of the Liberation
 Front in South Vietnam.   On 2
 August, Hanoi radio said the
 Front was the "master of the
 situation" and, therefore, has
 "a decisive say in the settle-
 ment of the South Vietnam issue."
 The broadcast went on to state
 in even more uncompromising terms
 that "there is no other basis
 for a solution to the South Vietnam
 problem than the judicious stand
 of the Front."
 Other recent North Vietnamese
 propaganda reinforces indications
 on the ground in South Vietnam
 that the Communists are on the
 verge of another round of offen-
 sive action.   Some domestic broad-
 casts by Hanoi seem designed in
 part to gird the North Vietnamese
 people for another major effort
 in support of the war and possi-
 bly for a US resumption of heavier
 and more widely ranging air at-
 tacks.
 Hanoi radio told the North
 Vietnamese that President John-
 son on 31 July had mentioned the
 possibility of "increasing mili-
 tary measures" and that Secretary
 Rusk on 29 July had "brazenly"
 called for reciprocity in return
 for a bombing halt.   The broad-
 cast concluded that the US is
 still pursuing the war and that
 the Johnson administration was
 in a "vicious cycle" that can
 only be broken by Communist mili-
 tary force.   An editorial in the
 party daily on 3 August warned
 the people to be ready for new
 US "escalation" and stated that
 the US is "threatening to use
 retaliatory military measures in
 case they are strongly attacked
 in the South."
 Political Developments in
 South Vietnam
 There are a number of re-
 ports that Premier Huong is con-
 templating several cabinet shifts
 that would give southerners more
 representation and would further
 erode the influence of Vice Presi-
 dent Ky and some of the senior
 generals associated with him.
 Huong
 intends even ua  y--           aps with-
 in six months--to step down,
 and is planning cabinet shifts
 to bring in his supporters before
 that day comes.

 RADICAL FORCES LOSING GROUND IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 The Cultural Revolution ap-
 pears to be taking a turn to the
 right once again, following a
 period of excesses.   After three
 months of rising violence, par-
 ticularly in areas adjacent to
 Vietnam, Mao Tse-tung finally
 issued a pronouncement on 28
 July telling militant  "revolu-
 tionaries" to stop fighting
 because the masses of students,
 workers, and soldiers were becoming
 "unhappy."  Mao specifically con-
 demned those who strike at the
 army, disrupt communications,
 and kill, burn, and loot.
 This statement, along with
 central committee directives issued
 on 3 and 24 July designed to end
 fighting in Kwangsi and Shensi,
 have been widely disseminated in
 recent days.  Mao complained that
 the Kwangsi and Shensi orders were
 ignored by militants elsewhere,
 and for this reason he was spell-
 ing out new orders that were to
 be enforced throughout the nation.
 These orders have already had
 a calming effect although, as
 in the past, Mao has left it
 unclear just how far he wants
 to go in damping the Cultural Rev-
 olution.   For example, Mao urged
 Red Guard factions to intensify
 "nonviolent" struggle against his
 enemies. In the past, such re-
 marks have been used by faction-
 alists to justify continued dis-
 order.
 Moreover, these orders, like
 25X1similar ones issued in the past
 year, do not yet seem to give the
 army an unequivocal and general
 mandate to curb Red Guards.
 It he army still refuses to
 intervene in Red Guard squabbles,
 although it has taken new steps to
 prevent military weapons from being
 stolen.
 In Kwangtung, however, the
 army has been dealing harshly and
 even savagely with the Red Flags,
 the leading radical faction in the
 province.  The army has occupied
 Red Flag headquarters, arrested
 Red Flag leaders, including its
 representative on the Kwangtung
 Revolutionary Committee, and ap-
 parently silenced its propaganda
 media.   Army patrols have been
 seen beating up Red Flag members,
 and travelers claim that many are
 now being tried on serious charges
 of murder and looting.
 During much of 1967, the Red
 Flag faction in Canton carried on
 a running feud with local army
 leaders and repeatedly denounced
 them in their journals.   At that
 time, however, the Red Flags had
 the support of major groups in the
 Peking Red Guard Congress and of
 the Cultural Revolution Group  (CRG),
 and the army did not dare to sup-
 press them openly.  The current
 suppression implies that radical
 leaders in Peking are no longer
 providing protection.
 August.
 The touchy issue of how much
 authority to give the army in
 curbing Red Guards may have
 strained relations between the
 army and some top leaders.   In
 an extraordinary departure from
 normal practice, not a single
 member of the CRG or of the po-
 litburo standing committee attended
 the annual army day celebrations
 in Peking.  All top leaders were
 in Peking, however, and attended
 a number of Red Guard or diplo-
 matic receptions just before and
 after the army ceremonies on 1

 be the beginning of increased

 areas.   The reconnaissance effort
 might be followed later in the
 year by acts of terrorism and
 sabotage.
 So far, South Korean security
 measures are apparently keeping
 pace with the North Korean at-
 tempts.   The recently completed
 anti-infiltration fence, more
 aggressive patrolling,  and the
 introduction of night-detection
 equipment are apparently making
 it more difficult for the North
 Koreans to infiltrate across the  25X1
 zone.   Increased security along
 the coasts would also hamper sea-
 borne infiltration.

 The threat of Soviet military intervention in Czechoslovakia faded
 following the Cierna and Bratislava meetings. The nature and extent of the
 concessions the Soviets and their adherents have been given by Prague may
 become evident only with time. The Czechs have, in any case, won a
 respite rather than an accommodation. What is clear is that none of the
 principals in the affair seem entirely satisfied.
 The Communists likewise can enjoy little satisfaction over the Ninth
 World Youth Festival, which closed in Sofia on 6 August. This gathering
 may not have been a total fiasco, but the strong-arm methods the Bul-

 ET-
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA WINS RESPITE FROM THE USSR
 The Bratislava agreement of
 4 August marked a step back from
 Prague's confrontation with Moscow
 and its allies, and reduced the at-
 tendant threat of massive military
 intervention in Czechoslovakia.
 The Czechoslovaks have won at least
 a reprieve but it is too soon to
 tell whether this will develop into
 any sort of modus vivendi.   Much
 will depend on how much they had
 to give the Soviets in return for
 breathing space and on how the Dub-
 cek regime uses the time it has won.
 Unless there are secret codi-
 cils to the Bratislava agreement--
 and neither side has yet done any-
 thing to suggest that there are--
 the results of the Bratislava con-
 ference fall well short of the maxi-
 mum Soviet demands as expressed in
 the Warsaw joint letter of 15 July.
 There was or-al agreement on all
 sides in Bratislava to end mutual
 public recriminations and to this
 end Czechoslovak leaders have asked
 their news media to exercise volun-
 tary restraint, especially in re-
 porting on foreign affairs.   The
 Czechoslovak press is restive under
 this restriction, however, and will
 probably continue to report on con-
 troversial subjects, but without in-
 vective.
 The Bratislava agreement also
 called on the Czechoslovaks to har-
 monize more closely their economic,
 defense, and foreign policies with
 those of the hard-line Warsaw Pact
 states.   The conference communique
 reiterated the call made earlier
 at the Dresden conference in March
 for an urgent top-level economic
 conference to be held "in the near
 future."   Such a conference might
 discuss economic assistance to
 Czechoslovakia.   In addition,,long-
 standing issues such as pricing
 policies, partial currency convert-
 ibility,and CEMA policy on trade
 with Western countries are li Cely
 to appear on the agenda.   Since
 Bratislavia, the Dubcek regime has
 acknowledged its economic depend-
 ence on CEMA, but has also stressed
 that strengthened Communist eco-
 nomic ties do not preclude ex-
 panded trade with the West.
 At Cierna, Dubcek apparently
 fended off Soviet efforts to sta-
 tion Soviet troops on Czechoslovak
 soil.   In return, however, the
 Czechs may have had to agree to
 accept Soviet military advisors
 and to give up any plans they, may
 have had for cutting their on de-
 fense establishment in the interests
 of economy.   No increase in the
 army or in the defense budget is
 contemplated before 1970, however.
 Dubcek's concessions in for-
 eign policy may have been more ap-
 parent than real,  for the re ime
 had already decided to move  lowly
 in this area.   It would appear
 that the Czechs have agreed to
 further p-ostpone ideas of rees-
 tablishing diplomatic relations
 with West Germany or Israel, and
 that Czechoslovakia's foreign pol-
 icy orientation will veer mo*e to-
 ward the Communist world than toward
 Europe, as had been originally
 planned.
 No participant at Bratislava
 was completely satisfied.   Hyingarian
 party boss Kadar has said that dif-
 ferences remain.  Kadar was riot

 specific, but he was probably re-
 flecting the concern he shares with
 the East German and Polish leaders
 over the political impact in their
 own countries of the Czechoslovak
 domestic  reforms.
 Since its return to Moscow
 on 5 August, the Soviet leadership
 has done everything in its power
 to represent the Cierna and Bratis-
 lava agreements as victories for
 Communist unity and orthodoxy.   In
 part, this is necessary to explain
 how the Soviet leaders could sud-
 denly go from bitter denunciation
 of Prague to smiles and handshakes
 with so little concrete to show
 for it.  Moscow's public treat-
 ment of Bratislava is also intended,
 however, to remind Prague that it
 will be expected to follow up its
 general pledges with deeds.
 The Soviet leadership has also
 gone to some lengths to demonstrate
 that it is united behind the policy
 decisions made last week.   How
 strong that unity is, however, is
 open to question and, should the
 Czechoslovaks back-slide on what
 Moscow thought was achieved at
 Bratislava, the strains in the
 leadership would increase.
 *       *       *
 During the past week,  there
 were indications that some Soviet
 units in East Germany were prepar-
 ing to return to garrison from lo-
 cations near the Czechoslovak       25X1
 border.
 Prague announced that the last
 Soviet troops left Czechoslovakia
 on 3 August.   The Soviet force of
 at least divisional strength, ob-
 served by a US attache in central
 Czechoslovakia on 29-31 July, prob-
 ably was included.
 The entire southeast quadrant
 of East Germany remains restricted
 to Allied mission travel until
 15 August.   Parts of this area have
 also been denied to other Westerners
 a. well.
 There have been reports that
 some East German reservists have
 been called up.   These call-ups are
 probably part of the large Soviet
 Rear Services exercise due to expire
 on 10 August.   Moscow previously
 announced that East German and
 Polish reserves would take part
 in the exercise.

 WESTERN EUROPE PLANS NEW FIGHTER AIRCRAFT
 A newly proposed multi-
 purpose combat aircraft will
 test the ability of a consor-
 tium of West European nations to
 develop and manufacture an ad-
 vanced weapon system without US
 help.   The program, which could
 involve as many as seven coun-
 tries and as much as $2.5 bil-
 lion, is in part intended to di-
 minish Western Europe's depend-
 ence on the US for sophisticated
 weaponry.
 The proposal for the new
 plane, designated the Multi-Role
 Aircraft-1975  (MRA-75), moved
 forward on 17 July when four na-
 tions signed an agreement setting
 up teams charged with defining
 the operational requirements and
 performance characteristics of
 the plane.   The four countries--
 West Germany, Britain, Italy,
 and the Netherlands--are to come
 up with an agreed list of speci-
 fications by the end of the year.
 Once the specifications are fixed,
 the builders hope to develop and
 produce the plane in another six
 or seven years.
 Canada probably will join
 the consortium and Belgium pos-
 sibly will.   France has shown
 interest but probably will not
 join as long as Paris entertains
 hope of developing an all-French
 rival.
 Britain worked to gain
 charge of the over-all design of
 the MRA-75, but settled for en-
 gine development.  The Germans
 jumped to the front on the de-
 sign of the airframe and the
 navigation system.   The design
 of other components will not be
 assigned until further studies
 are completed.
 The MRA-75 is to replace
 US-designed F-104s and Italian-
 designed G-91s now in NATO inven-
 tories and to fill the gap left
 by Britain's cancellation of its
 order for US-built F-llls.   Brit-
 ish aviation officials see a re-
 quirement for as many as 1,000
 planes among the West European
 military forces.  The consortium
 hopes to keep the cost per unit
 below $3 million.
 Western Europe's past suc-
 cesses in carrying out multi-
 lateral programs on complex
 weapon systems have centered on
 the production of US-designed
 hardware.  The Europeans are be-
 coming increasingly dissatisfied
 with this assemble-it-yourself
 approach, which makes them de-
 pendent upon the US for advanced
 technology.  The effort to de-
 velop an independent capability
 might stretch Europe's limited
 defense resources, however,. un-
 less the consortium can avoid
 the inefficiencies that have
 marked previous cooperative ar-
 mament ventures on the continent.

 YOUTH FESTIVAL ENDS AMID GENERAL DISSENSION
 .  The Ninth World Youth Festi-
 val in Sofia ended on a note of
 deep dissension on 6 August. Only
 rigid Bulgarian security measures
 prevented scattered violence from
 erupting into widespread disorder.
 The political organizers of the
 festival probably made few con-
 verts to the Communist cause and
 the net result may be a widening
 of the ideological schisms be-
 tween ruling Communist parties.
 Yugoslav, Czechoslovak,
 West German, and other delegates
 complained bitterly throughout
 the ten-day affair, especially
 about excessive security measures
 that contributed to what the Yugo-
 slavs called the "undemocratic
 atmosphere" of the festival. The
 Bulgarians apparently saturated
 the entire festival area with
 security forces.   These strong-
 arm squads quashed incipient pro-
 test demonstrations and forcibly
 excluded politically "unreliable"
 delegates from parades and semi-
 nars.
 Bulgarian militia twice at-
 tacked radical West German stu-
 dent leader Karl Wolff as he tried
 to organize demonstrations.   When
 he was later ejected from a semi-
 nar and denounced as a "fascist
 Goebbels," delegates from Czech-
 slovakia, Rumania, Yugoslavia,
 Poland, and even some from Bul-
 garia walked out with Wolff's
 delegation in direct opposition
 to the East Germans.
 Violent mistreatment of the
 Tunisian delegates prompted their
 government to demand an immediate
 explanation from the Bulgarian am-
 bassador.   The Tunisian protest
 received the unanimous support of
 the Pan-African youth movement.
 Delegations from the Arab world
 reportedly were generally unhappy
 because Israelis were allowed to
 participate and because Arab prob-
 lems were given scant attention.
 Even the Vietnam war, the
 one topic seemingly guaranteed to
 produce unity, failed to produce
 the desired effects.   A special
 train scheduled to leave Sofia on
 3 August loaded with gifts for the
 "heroic Vietnamese people" has not
 departed.  The reason for the de-
 lay is unknown, but the Yugoslavs
 have complained loudly that their
 consignment was deliberately dam-
 aged and that Yugoslavia's name
 was removed from the parcels.
 Bulgarian authorities were
 especially nervous about elements
 of the "new left" and prevented
 delegates from several countries
 from crossing the border.   The more
 radical portion of the French dele-
 gation was expelled, and other dele-
 gations left early, completely frus-
 trated and disgruntled.
 The total effect of Bulgarian
 heavy-handedness must have disil-
 lusioned even those delegates who
 managed to stay out of trouble.
 Repercussions from the festival are
 likely to be felt for some time,
 and may adversely affect Bulgaria's
 foreign relations.  Moreover, the
 Sofia experience will reinforce
 doubts in the Communist world about
 the value of these        y spectacu-
 lars. F

 YUGOSLAV INDUSTRY SPARKS ECONOMIC UPSWING
 Yugoslav industrial output
 has begun to rise following last
 year's stagnation.   The revival
 has been achieved, however,
 largely at the cost of a partial
 retreat from some of the liberal-
 izing economic reform measures
 enacted in 1967.
 Industrial output in the
 first six months of 1968 is up
 3.8 percent over the first half
 of 1967.   Vice Premier Gligorov
 has said he expects a 5-6 percent
 increase for the entire year,
 compared with the original esti-
 mate of 3-4 percent.   In 1967,
 production fell by 0.4 percent.
 The revival is the result
 of the about-face in government
 policy executed late in 1967 in
 response to rising unemployment
 and a worsening hard-currency
 trade deficit.   These problems
 gave rise to sharp public criti-
 cism and prompted the government
 to reimpose direct controls and
 higher tariffs on many imports
 that had been liberalized in 1967.
 These import controls have been
 largely responsible for the re-
 vival thus far--benefiting for
 cially the iron and steel and
 chemical industries, which had
 suffered from increased foreign
 competition in 1967.   In addition
 to import controls, the govern-
 ment is trying to revive growth
 by easing credit  terms for ex-
 ports and domestic sales of equip-
 ment.   Thus far, however, the
 Page   14
 latter measures are having lit-
 tle effect, and domestic output
 of machinery has not picked up.
 The foreign trade picture
 is mixed.   The deficit in the
 hard-currency area reportedly
 has decreased somewhat, largely
 because industrial exports have
 recovered from last year's de-
 cline, while imports have been
 held at the 1967 level.  Agricul-
 tural exports to the hard-cur-
 rency area, however, have dropped
 as a result of tightened EEC re-
 strictions.   Trade with the CEMA
 countries is running a sizable
 deficit, reflecting the contin-
 uing effort to reduce Yugoslavia'.s
 accumulated surpluses.   This ac-
 counts for the increase of 16
 percent in the over-all trade de-
 ficit in the first six months of.
 1968.
 There is some danger that
 the upswing could lead to renewed
 inflation and balance of payments
 difficulties that would require
 a further retreat from reform
 measures.  Although the regime
 hopes to avoid this, it is clear
 that continued government inter-
 vention in the economy will be
 necessary, regardless of whether
 the goal is to promote efficiency,
 stifle inflation, or stimulate
 growth.   The recent improvement,
 however, should cause some of the
 criticism of the regime's poli-
 cies to diminish.

 SOUTHERN YEMEN BESET BY TRIBAL OUTBREAKS
 Although tribal protests
 against the one-party Southern
 Yemen Government have broken out,
 the army has so far managed to
 keep them from getting out of
 hand.   The tenure of the regime,
 however, depends upon its ability
 to obtain continued support from

 They have begun to resist actively
 the socialist-oriented National
 Liberation Front  (NLF), which
 late last year outlawed all other
 political groups in Southern
 Yemen.   The rival political par-

 but the tribes have regained

 litical groups of the right and

 left.  Now, the tribesmen are
 seeking representation in a "na-
 tional unity" government, from
 which former rulers and "godless
 Communists" are to be barred.
 Their demands are not clearly
 defined, even in their own minds,
 but they are quite certain they
 want to share the power that the
 NLF has monopolized up to the
 present.
 The break with the NLF began
 among the Awlaqi tribal group,
 long a thorny problem in the
 area.   Under British rule, they
 had attempted to gain dominance
 in the army, a move that failed
 after the NLF purged the highest-
 ranking Awlaqi officers from key
 posts.   These officers appear
 to have become the leaders of
 the recent series of outbreaks,
 and have been able to call suc-
 cessfully for the defection of
 several hundred Awlaqi and Rad-
 fani soldiers.   Most of the army
 is composed of strongly anti-
 Awlaqi tribesmen, however, and
 the defections may not weaken
 army unity.
 Other tribes are also dis-
 satisfied with the government,
 and the spate of recent outbreaks
 will probably continue.  This in
 turn will force the army to re-
 consider its support for the pres-
 ent regime.  The army has never
 been enchanted with the NLF, but
 has supported it as the only prac-
 ticable alternative to direct mil-
 itary rule or a left-wing take-
 over.
 The NLF may be considering
 a more broadly based government
 once the present disorders are
 settled.   If it decides not to
 share responsibility with other
 power groups, however, or resists
 the idea too strongly, the army
 may be forced to replace it.   The
 NLF could even be excluded from
 the resultant coa 't-ion and find
 itself outlawed.
 EAST AFRICAN ECONOMIC COOPERATION SHOIIS LITTLE PROGRESS
 The eight-month-old East Af-
 rican Community  (EAC), comprising
 Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, has
 thus far made little headway
 toward accomplishing its goals of
 economic cooperation and expansion
 of regional trade.   Conflicting
 national interests and adminis-
 trative problems will probably
 continue to obstruct progress for
 a long time.
 The EAC was formed in Decem-
 ber 1967 with the hope that it
 would be more effective than its
 predecessor, the East African
 Common Services Organization,  in
 correcting imbalances between
 its members.   Kenya, for instance,
 has been receiving far more for-
 eign investment than Tanzania or
 Uganda, and has dominated trade
 between the three partners.   In
 addition, Kenya's leading role
 had always been accentuated by
 the location of the organization's
 headquarters in Nairobi, long the
 major economic center in East
 Africa.

 The three member countries
 have thus far failed to cooperate
 fully in trying to make the EAC
 viable, and they continue to sub-
 ordinate community interests to
 their own.   Development projects
 are not being coordinated, with
 the result that needed industries
 are neglected, while others, such
 as textiles, are being built in
 triplicate.   Hopes for more bal-
 anced trade have been hurt by
 transfer taxes imposed on certain
 goods, and trade itself has been
 impeded by import license require-
 ments.  Moreover, the community
 is plagued with serious logisti-
 cal problems such as inadequate
 transportation and scattered fa-
 cilities, for which funds have
 not yet been made available.
 Finding talented employees
 for the community has been an-
 other big problem.   Tanzania pre-

 graduates for its own government
 service, and Kenya discourages
 employment with the EAC, although
 not prohibiting it.   In addition,
 expatriates find the EAC's new

 CONGO (BRAZZAVILLE) PRESIDENT SURVIVES COUP ATTEMPT
 An uneasy calm has returned
 to Brazzaville, where President
 Massamba-Debat apparently has
 weathered the double onslaught
 of a sharp attack on his leader-
 ship by leftist-extremists and
 an attempted coup by a part of
 the army and some militia elements.
 The extremists, still reel-
 ing from Massamba's elimination
 of their top spokesmen from the
 government last January, began
 moving in mid-July toward a direct
 confrontation with the relatively
 moderate President.   Massamba and
 his "counterrevolutionary clique"
 came under sharp attack by student
 radicals for having imposed "Bantu
 socialism" on the country instead
 of the Marxist-Leninist variety.
 Extremist leaders within the party
 also criticized him for failing to
 call the long-postponed national
 party congress, through which they
 planned to reassert radical con-
 trol and perhaps oust Massamba
 from party leadership.
 Countermoves by the Presi-
 dent, including dissolution of
 the National Assembly and "sus-
 pension" of the party politburo,
 appeared momentarily to catch the
 radicals off guard.   Several ar-
 rests were made, including former
 paracbmmando chief Capt. Ngouabi,
 a restive northern tribalist, sus-
 pected by Massamba of plotting
 with radical leaders and militia
 elements to overthrow the govern-
 ment.
 On the defensive for the first
 time since the crisis had come
 to a head, Massamba amnestied
 all political prisoners after
 Ngouabi had released a number
 of detainees.
 Communiques broadcast on
 Brazzaville radio on 3 August--
 probably issued by the opportun-
 istic Ngouabi--were highly criti-
 cal of Massamb a and seemed to
 indicate he was out of power.
 In his "absence," Defense Secre-
 tary Poignet was named acting
 president and Ngouabi was ap-
 pointed army commander.  A few
 hours later, however, Ngouabi
 apparently became convinced that
 he was outgunned by loyal forces
 and appealed to Massamba to "re-
 join" the government.  After a
 day of negotiation with army
 and militia elements, Massamba an-
 nounced that the constitution would
 be "revised" and that he had
 formed aprovisional government,
 key members of which are persons
 closely associated with the Presi-
 dent and his pragmatic policies.
 Although the extremists thus
 far seem to have been unable to
 take advantage of the crisis,
 they will probably fight for
 positions in the new institutions
 promised by Massamba, especially
 the proposed 30-man National
 Council of the Revolution that
 is supposed to control composi-
 tion of the government itself.
 The crisis took on a new com-
 plexion on 2 August when paracom-
 mandos forcibly freed Ngouabi from
 prison.   Soldiers in Brazzaville
 apparently split into rival camps,
 with northerners grouped in op-
 position to loyal southern troops.

 BOLIVIAN POLITICAL SITUATION CALMED
 President Barriento's con-
 voking  of Congress on 6  August
 has, temporarily     at   least,
 calmed political tensions.   Be-
 fore agreeing to open Congress,
 Barrientos apparently received
 assurances of support from the
 parties that formerly composed
 the government coalition,  in-
 cluding their backing for the
 imposition of a state of siege
 in July and the appointment of
 a military cabinet.
 The President had earlier
 indicated that Congress might
 be prevented from convening un-
 til the supreme court had ruled
 on its constitutionality,  thus
 depriving the political opposi-
 tion of a forum to attack the
 government's actions during the
 political crisis stimulated by
 the Guevara diary scandal.   He
 was apparently dissuaded from
 this during an all-night ses-
 sion on 3 August with armed
 forces commander General Ovando
 and civilian political leaders,
 prior to which he reportedly
 threatened to resign from the
 presidency.
 The convoking of Congress
 has     deprived   antigovernment
 groups of a major issue, and an
 indication from the President
 that civilians will soon be
 brought into the cabinet would
 further ease the situation.   Po-
 litical tensions could rise
 again, however, if the opposi-
 tion in Congress is successful
 in provoking a confrontation with
 the government over the handling
 of the Guevara diary case.
 Student demonstrations and
 violence could also cause serious
 problems for Barrientos if they
 continue and are able to gain any
 outside support.  A student dem-
 onstration in Cochabamba on 2
 August attacking the Barrientos
 administration and "American Im-
 perialism" resulted in two stu-
 dent deaths and 100 arrests.   Se-
 curity forces have thus far dealt
 efficiently with the students but
 sporadic incidents of terrorist
 bombings and student disorders con-
 tinue.  Adding to the apprehension
 are unconfirmed reports that guer-
 rilla groups are forming in the
 countryside.
 Despite these problems, Bar-
 rientos believes he has the situ-
 ation under control, at least for
 now, and will be able to deal
 firmly with any future outbreaks
 of violence.   The opening of Con-
 gress should reassure civilian pol-
 iticians, and the military, the
 only group capable of dislodging
 the President  a  ears to be firmly
 behind him.
