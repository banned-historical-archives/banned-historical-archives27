 PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA:
 CHEMICAL FERTILIZER SUPPLIES
 1949-74
 1.   The Chinese fertilizer industry grew from only two plants producing
 27,000 metric tons a year in 1949 to at least 40 large and hundreds of small
 plants producing 25 million tons in 1974. Despite this expansion in output, China
 has been the world's largest importer of fertilizer in recent years. Currently, the
 fertilizer industry is configured as follows:
 ? Small plants now play an equal role in nitrogen output, using local raw
 materials to produce aqueous ammonia and ammonium bicarbonate.
 ? Nitrogen fertilizer production in large plants has grown steadily, except
 for sharp drops in 1961 and 1967. Growth was spurred in the mid-1960s
 by the purchase of a large urea plant from the Netherlands, which
 provided Peking with technology it subsequently copied.
 ? Phosphate fertilizer production is largely from small plants using domestic
 rock; the few large superphosphate plants use imported rock.
 ? Production of potassium fertilizer is low, despite large natural salt deposits
 in the western provinces.
 2.   Shortcomings in the fertilizer industry were highlighted by the poor
 harvest in 1972, which convinced Peking that agriculture needed more fertilizer
 and other inputs to help mitigate the effects of bad weather and allow agricultural
 output to keep pace with population growth. Unable to rapidly expand fertilizer
 production from domestic resources, China in late 1972 contracted for 13 of the
 world's largest ammonia-urea complexes from US, Netherlands, French, and
 Japanese firms.
 ? Upon completion in the next two to three years the imported plants
 will provide 3.5 million tons of nitrogen annually.
 ? Imports of nitrogenous fertilizer will be largely eliminated.
 ? The rate of construction of new small plants (which has slowed in recent
 years) will continue to decline, but they will remain an important source
 of fertilizer - particularly phosphate.

 3.   The huge expansion in fertilizer supply by the end of the decade could
 result in rapid increases in agricultural output. However, the full benefit of the
 increased supply will be realized only if complementary inputs such as advanced
 seed strains and improved water control features are adequately developed. We
 believe it unlikely that Peking will carry out these complementary tasks to the
 extent required, particularly in agricultural research.
 4.   Agriculture is progressing with the aid of such inputs as water control
 systems, mechanized farm tools, and agrochemicals. Because the amount of land
 suitable for cultivation in China is limited, however, chemical fertilizer has been
 and will remain the key to sizable gains in agricultural output.
 5.   This study surveys the present situation and. future prospects for fertilizer
 supply in China and reviews production techniques, resources, and development
 policy. Notes on the methodology used to make the estimates are presented in
 the appendixes.
 Fertilizer Supply
 Background
 6.   China produced only 27,000 tons of chemical fertilizer in 1949,' the
 first year under Communist control. The pre-Communist record of 227,000 tons
 produced in 1941 was not surpassed until 1953, and output did not reach one
 million tons per year until 1958. By 1960 a program using local building materials
 and raw materials in small plants began to grow in importance. Fertilizer assumed
 a central role in agricultural progress, and its output has subsequently grown rapidly
 except in the aftermath of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution
 periods.'
 7.   Nevertheless, in the 1970s China has remained the world's largest importer
 of fertilizer, purchasing more than one million tons of nutrient each year since
 1967. The process of achieving self-sufficiency in fertilizer, and therefore in grain,
 has not moved rapidly enough.

 Present Supply
 8.   In contrast to gains of 14% and 17% in 1972 and 1973, China's total
 fertilizer supply declined 7% in 1974 (see Table 1). The increase in domestic
 production of chemical fertilizer in 1974 was negligible as increases in nitrogenous
 and potassium output were offset by a sharp decline in phosphorus production.
 Phosphate fertilizer production declined 11% (despite increased domestic mining
 of rock) because of a reduction in rock imports. Disruptions related to the campaign
 to criticize Lin Piao and Confucius caused transportation bottlenecks and coal
 shortages. While output from large nitrogen fertilizer plants increased almost 17%,
 difficulties with coal supplies held the output of small nitrogen fertilizer plants
 to constant gains in 1974. Potassium output increased by about 7% during the
 year.
 9.   Overall fertilizer imports fell 33% in 1974. Purchases of. phosphate rock
 fell off sharply, as Morocco led world producers in quadrupling prices. Nitrogen
 fertilizer imports for the year also dropped, as shipments from Japan scheduled
 for the last quarter were postponed until 1975.
 10.   China has significant supplies of raw materials for the production of all
 three major nutrient types. Coal is found in abundance throughout the country
 and has been the main source of raw materials for the nitrogenous fertilizer industry.
 Extensive oil-related gas deposits and natural gas fields in Szechwan Province are
 increasingly being used as feedstock for plants that produce ammonia to be
 processed into urea. Domestic phosphate deposits in many areas have supported
 production, particularly in the small plant program, which provides most of the
 phosphate fertilizer production. Extensive potassium supplies are available in the
 Tarim and Tsaidam Basins in the far western part of China, but these areas are
 far from major agricultural areas. Secondary sources of potassium have been sea
 salt recovery operations.
 Products and Plant Types
 11.   Small plant ammonia production began in 1958 from units with capacities
 of 800 tons per year. These were later increased to 3,000 tons per year, and by
 the mid-1960s large plants with capacities of up to 40,000 tons per year were
 developed. The small plant program gained momentum with the development of
 the ability to produce complete sets of fertilizer plant and equipment within China.

 1.  Appendix B presents notes on the derivation of the production series. The import figures were derived from
 export data of major trading partners.
 12.      The quality of the output produced by this sector - primarily aqueous
 ammonia and ammonium bicarbonate - has often been questioned by Western
 observers, but the Chinese consistently have claimed that small plant output is
 suitable for their purposes. There are, nonetheless, problems with the products.
 Aqueous ammonia must be shipped in closed containers to slow the loss of its
 already low - about 17% - nitrogen content into the atmosphere. Ammonium
 bicarbonate, the main product, is unstable and cannot be stored for long periods,
 particularly when not under cover. Neither fertilizer comes near urea's 46% nitrogen

 Approved For Release 2002/03/25 : CIA-RDP79-00928A000200080002-4
 content and is thus of a lesser value per unit weight. Distribution also is a problem
 because demand is highly seasonal.
 13.   Ammonium nitrate production has been divided between military and
 industrial explosives and agriculture in its final uses. With a nitrogen content above
 30%, it is a useful fertilizer despite physical properties that lead to caking through
 absorbing moisture from the air and to spontaneous explosion under conditions
 of high temperature or pressure.
 14.   Urea production began on a pilot plant scale during the late 1950s. The
 high nitrogen content of urea and its relative ease of handling and application
 in its prilled form make it superior to ammonium sulfate and the volatile ammonium
 bicarbonate. However, the ability to produce prilled urea in commercial quantities
 came only after the purchase of a large urea plant from the United Kingdom and
 the Netherlands in the mid-1960s. This 175,000-ton-per-year facility, located at
 Lu-chou in Szechwan Province, was examined closely by Chinese technicians; since
 then a number of standardized urea plants, each with a capacity of 40,000 tons
 per year, have been domestically manufactured.
 15.   Phosphate fertilizer production has not expanded as rapidly as nitrogen
 production and is an important concern of the Chinese. Relatively little finished
 phosphate fertilizer is imported. Instead, phosphate rock, predominantly Moroccan,
 is purchased for conversion into single or triple superphosphate by large domestic
 plants. Small plants, which depend on domestic rock deposits, currently provide
 most of the phosphate fertilizer supply. However, many small plants do little more
 than crush the rock before it is spread on the fields.
 16.   Potassium production in China is limited despite large potash deposits
 in the western provinces. Two plants, both in Tsinghai Province, use carnallite,
 a natural salt, to produce potassium fertilizer. In Fukien and other eastern provinces,
 sea water is treated to obtain several salts, including potassium chloride and a
 potassium-magnesium fertilizer.
 17.   Finally, organic fertilizers have been and will continue to be of great
 importance in Chinese agriculture. Night soil is collected regularly, and hogs are
 lauded in the press as fertilizer factories. Probably as a result of the decline in
 supply in 1974, the use and production of organic substances is currently being
 widely publicized and praised for its results.

 Development Policy
 18.  In spite of significant growth in fertilizer production throughout the
 1960s and early 1970s, imports remained high. At the same time, application rates
 in China were far below those of many of its neighbors. The inadequacies of the
 domestic fertilizer industry were highlighted by the poor harvest of 1972, which
 convinced Chinese policymakers that agriculture required more fertilizer and other
 inputs to cushion the effects of bad weather. A population growth rate of 2%
 necessitated rapidly increasing agricultural output. Beginning in late 1972, China
 contracted for 13 of the world's largest ammonia-urea complexes from US,
 Netherlands, French, and Japanese firms (see Table 2). The decision to seek
 equipment abroad was dictated by China's inability to rapidly expand fertilizer
 production from domestic resources.

 19.   Each of the 13 ammonia plants being imported will have a daily capacity
 of 1,000 tons which will serve as feedstock to associated urea plants, each of which
 will produce 1,600 tons per day or more. Upon completion in the next two to
 three years, these plants will provide 3.5 million tons of nitrogen annually, more
 than the 3.2 million tons of nitrogen produced in China in 1974. China recently
 became the world's fifth largest producer of natural gas, and the urea plants will
 use gas as feedstock.

 20.   The prime motivation to import plant and technology was the inability
 of China's agricultural sector to provide adequate harvests in years of unfavorable
 growing conditions. The solution to the problem was to increase industrial inputs
 to agriculture by greatly increasing the nation's capacity to produce fertilizer. Higher
 urea production was seen as the necessary base of such an expansion because of
 agriculture's dependence upon nitrogen and the economies in production, storage,
 transportation, and application of urea itself. However, domestic shortages of
 technology in equipment design, inadequate supplies of key materials - such as
 stainless steel - and the limited capability of the machine tool industry worked
 together to prohibit rapid increases in urea plant capacities. Prices of imported
 equipment also began to look more attractive as world prices for fertilizer and
 oil increased rapidly. For example, the eight complexes purchased from the United
 States and the Netherlands alone cost less than the 2.2 million tons of urea imported
 in 1973 at 1974 prices, yet they could produce twice that amount yearly.
 21.   Tightness in the world fertilizer market was an early factor reinforcing
 China's decision to acquire imported fertilizer technology and equipment. In spite
 of increases of 6.1% and 7.2% in production during 1972 and 1973, world stocks
 of nitrogen fertilizer and phosphate rock were drawn on to meet demand. In its
 negotiations for fertilizer imports, Peking faced rising prices and increased
 uncertainty as to the availability of future supplies.
 22.   In late 1973, tremendous increases took place in the price of oil, a
 feedstock for ammonia production. Consequently, urea prices moved up so strongly
 that 1973 imports valued at $175 million would have cost $300 million in 1974.
 The most important price effect on Chinese imports, however, was the quadrupling
 in the price of Moroccan phosphate rock to $43 per ton in early 1974. Subsequent
 increases to $68 per ton led Peking to cut imports drastically.
 23.   By late 1974 the Chinese were also experiencing' shortages of foreign
 exchange, as their export sales fell off in the face of the world recession. Shipments
 of Japanese fertilizer scheduled for November and December, involving 150,000
 tons of urea and 60,000 tons of ammonium sulfate, were postponed to early 1975.
 In addition, Peking requested delayed payment for ammonium chloride purchased
 from Japan.
 24.   An easing of prices and product availabilities has characterized the world
 fertilizer market in recent months. As a result, fertilizer imports by Peking during
 the last half of 1975 will be obtained at sharply reduced prices, conserving foreign
 exchange, which continues in short supply. Despite lower product prices, however,

 Approved For Release 2002/03/25 : CIA-RDP79-00928A000200080002-4
 the imported urea plants remain a prudent purchase by virtue of their ability to
 relieve China's need to import nitrogen fertilizer and its dependence on a fluctuating
 world market.
 Small Plant Program
 25.  Small plants have played an important role in the development of China's
 fertilizer industry. An experimental program began in 1958, and 10 years later
 small nitrogen plants accounted for one-third of the national nitrogen productive
 capacity. By 1973, China had more than 1,400 small chemical fertilizer factories
 producing 63% of total fertilizer output, 75% of the phosphates, and 54% of
 the nitrogen fertilizer.
 26.   Savings accrue from reduced construction time, smaller investment, and
 forgoing the necessity of transporting large quantities of materials. Construction
 requires only one-third the time of large plants and is planned around local
 conditions to utilize local building materials whenever possible. Also, using local
 manpower in plant operations develops a large pool of trained workers.
 27.   The major benefits of the program derive from the location of the plants
 close to end users and raw material sources. Using plants scaled to meet local
 demand for fertilizer eliminates reliance on an already strained transport net and
 helps solve the problem of moving bulky aqueous ammonia and ammonium
 bicarbonate, which are susceptible to deterioration during shipping.
 28.   The wide distribution of small plants further reduces dependence on the
 transport system through using locations near sources of raw materials. In addition,
 plants and technologies may be varied in order to more adequately use materials
 as they exist in a specific area. By early 1973, 44% of all small nitrogen fertilizer
 plants had been switched to powdered coal and other local resources, releasing
 coke and hard coal for alternative uses.
 29.   The small plant effort has used natural and human resources that might
 otherwise have remained dormant and has assumed the major role in fertilizer
 production. However, the rate of construction of new plants has slowed because
 they already are widely distributed throughout the countryside.
 30.   There is little doubt that the small ammonia plants will play a smaller
 relative role after the imported urea complexes come on stream. The output of
 the 13 large plants alone will surpass total nitrogen fertilizer produced in 1974,

 of which half was provided by small plants. As the imported plants assume the
 major role in the growth of nitrogen output, however, small plants are likely to
 become the principal means by which the supply of phosphorus will be increased
 in order to maintain the nutrient balance. By 1980 this would call for nearly
 21 million tons of standard weight phosphorus fertilizer, an increase of about 150%
 over present levels.
 Prospects
 31.   The Chinese will not reach the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1971-75) goal
 of a total annual supply of 35 million tons of chemical fertilizer this year. Domestic
 output is unlikely to increase appreciably, and continued tightness of foreign
 exchange will probably hold fertilizer imports in 1975 below the level of 1973.
 However, oil income not diverted to plant and equipment purchases or used to
 offset the growing trade deficit might boost imports slightly above the depressed
 1974 level.
 32.   Recent Chinese attention to aid projects for Morocco may indicate an
 interest in renewing flows of phosphate rock at reduced prices. In any case, domestic
 output is being expanded to fill the gap, and compound fertilizer, in which the
 Chinese have shown recent interest, may be sought to provide sufficient phosphorus.
 The high level of Chinese purchases of Canadian potassium chloride over the past
 two years is likely to continue in the future.
 33.   Emphasis in the Chinese press on the production and use of organic
 fertilizer has been increased lately. The stress on organics suggests that there is
 little official hope of any substantial increase in the supply of chemical fertilizer
 over the short run.
 34.   Over the longer term, the key to increased output is the prompt
 completion and bringing into full production of the 13 imported urea plants. The
 first of these is expected to begin working in early 1977, with completion of the
 remaining plants scheduled in 1978. Construction lags and a lack of sufficiently
 trained Chinese technicians, however, may prevent a rapid rise to full plant
 productivity. Nevertheless, the output from the new plants plus the expected
 production from existing plants should enable China to produce 8 million tons
 of nitrogen fertilizer by 1980, relieving the need to import nitrogenous fertilizers.
 35.   This massive expansion in fertilizer supply could result in rapid increases
 in agricultural output by the end of the decade. The ability to fully utilize the

 Approved For Release 2002/03/25 : CIA-RDP79-00928A000200080002-4
 increased supply of fertilizer, however, will depend upon the development of
 complementary inputs. Without improved water control and advanced seed strains,
 returns on unit fertilizer applications will decline. The most suitable of China's
 arable lands are already under water control. Much of the remainder is either
 unsuitable for such projects or, as in North China, will require large, multipurpose
 works - high dams, extensive reservoir and delivery systems, and soil conservation
 programs. Numerous labor-intensive agricultural construction projects have been
 completed, but there is no indication that China is ready to undertake the large-scale
 projects to the extent required.
 36.   China continues to import and to develop high-yield varieties of seeds.
 Such strains require and respond to large doses of fertilizer. In addition to the
 problems of wide distribution and acceptance by the peasantry, these seeds require
 adequate water control if they are to be successful. Potential yields are unlikely
 to be realized as fertilizer inputs are increased if these problems are not addressed
 by the government.
 37.   The use of potassium fertilizer is likely to rise several fold by 1980.
 Despite considerable native potash deposits, the transportation network necessary
 to service the major locations in the western provinces can be developed only over
 the long term. Thus, annual potash imports of 2 million tons may be required
 by 1980.
 38.   The mixed performance of the fertilizer industry is in part a reflection
 of the inadequacies of some of China's other large industries. In spite of the major
 campaign since 1962 to push agriculture ahead with industrial inputs, certain sectors
 of the chemical, machine tool, and metals industries have been unable to meet
 the challenge. Large-scale production of prilled urea in China resulted only after
 the purchase and copy of foreign equipment. Even then, only medium-sized plants
 could be produced through the cooperation of these three industries. These
 industries will again be tested in the decade of the 1980s after the imported plants
 are in production. Maintenance of the accelerated growth rates of fertilizer output
 brought about by China's acquisition of the plants will depend upon the ability
 of these industries to provide additional large-scale chemical equipment for fertilizer
 production.

 APPENDIX A
 CHINESE PRACTICES OF REPORTING FERTILIZER OUTPUT
 We believe that the PRC is currently
 reporting the output of chemical fertilizer
 in standard units rather than as gross
 weight. In the late 1950s, when the Chinese
 published  detailed information  on the
 fertilizer industry, the output of various
 types of fertilizer was usually expressed in
 terms of these units. The standard unit
 refers to the nutrient equivalent of three
 basic  fertilizers -  ammonium   sulfate
 (20% N), super phosphate (18.7% P205),
 and potassium  sulfate (40% K20). For
 example, one million tons of urea fertilizer
 would be counted as 2.3 million tons of

 standard weight fertilizer because 2.3
 million tons of ammonium sulfate contain the same amount of nitrogen as the
 one million tons of urea. Data for 1952 illustrate the use of standard unit reporting.
 The tabulation below shows that the figure for ammonium nitrate expressed in
 standard units (derived as a ' residual) is consistent with the figure expressed as
 gross weight (from the First Five-
 Year Plan): The nitrogen content,
 and thus the nutrient value of the
 fertilizer, is the same in either case.
 There is no direct evidence
 that the Chinese have  changed
 this system, and recent statements
 imply that it is still in use. For

 Hsiao-ping told a Peking audience in October 1974 that China's fertilizer goal is
 60-70 million tons. * This level, which probably refers to 1980, could be reached
 only by converting the output of the urea plants now being imported from the
 West to its ammonium sulfate equivalent.

 Special Problem of Ammonium Nitrate
 During the 1950s, fertilizer output was reported in two ways: including and
 excluding ammonium nitrate. In Ten Great Years, for example, it was explicitly
 excluded. Thus the output of ammonium nitrate was reported or could be derived.
 Information on the production of ammonium nitrate for the years since 1958
 is not available, and there is little information as to how output is divided between
 military and agricultural uses. Most Western studies have assumed that ammonium
 nitrate was included in the percentage increases and index numbers reported for
 the early 1960s. We believe, however, that it was not included.
 Few observers have accepted the Chinese claim that fertilizer production
 increased 3 million tons in 1965. It was generally believed that an increase of
 this magnitude was not possible. However, if ammonium nitrate were excluded
 from claims for the years prior to 1965 but included in the 1965 total, an increase
 of about 3 million tons is reasonable.
 In addition, Chou En-lai's recent claim that fertilizer production in 1974 was
 4.3 times that of 1964 makes little sense unless the data reported for the early
 1960s exclude ammonium nitrate. An estimate for 1974 based on this assumption
 yields a reasonable 1974 total. The alternative is to believe that 1974 production
 fell nearly 5 million tons below the well-substantiated 1973 figure.
 For these reasons, we believe that ammonium nitrate was not included in
 the claims made for the years 1959 to 1964, but that it has been included in
 the claims made for 1965 and subsequent years.

 1965: Peking Review, 16 April 1966 indicated an increase of 3 million tons. WHP,
 12 February 1966 reported a 70% increase over 1964. The figures derived from
 these statements are reasonably close, and our estimate falls between them. It is
 assumed that chemical fertilizer totals began to include ammonium nitrate in
 standard units in 1965. The reported 3-million-ton increase, therefore, is the
 difference between total output in 1965 and output excluding ammonium nitrate
 in 1964.
 1966: Production increased 26% over 1965 (JMJP, 30 December 1966).
 1967-69: Work stoppages and raw material shortages during the Cultural Revolution
 resulted in lengthy shutdowns of many industrial plants and a 10% to 15% decline
 in total output. As Red Guard activity declined in 1968, 'industrial output began
 to recover and surpassed its previous high by 1969. It is assumed that chemical
 fertilizer production dropped sharply in 1967 and followed the same pattern of
 recovery as for industry as a whole.

 fertilizer was estimated to be the same as in 1958 on the assumption that the
 increase in production went to nonagricultural uses.
 1960: Conservatively estimated to be the same as 1959.
 1961-64: Production was assumed to have increased at the same rate as total output
 excluding ammonium nitrate.
 1965: Assume the same as 1964.
 Total Production Excluding Ammonium Nitrate
 1949-58: TGY.
 1959: JMJP, 22 January 1960.
 1960: Ekonomicheskaya Gazetta (Economic Journal), 10 June 1961. The Soviets
 indicated the figure was taken from the Chinese press.
 1961: Output in 1961 was 6.4 times the highest production prior to liberation
 (227,000 tons in 1941) (TKP, 1 October 1962).
 1962: Production increased 50% over 1961 (Peking Review, 11 January 1963, p. 3).
 1963: Production increased 39% over 1962 (FBIS, 2 January 1964, p. ccc 9-10).

 1964: Production increased 50% over 1963 (China Reconstructs, February 1965).
 Nitrogen
 1949-54: Sum of ammonium nitrate and total production excluding ammonium
 nitrate.
 1955-56: Sum of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate. Ammonium sulfate
 reported by the State Statistical Bureau, Basic Indicators of the Development of
 the National Economy of the CPR (in Russian), p. 39.
 1957-58: CKHW, 30 January 1959, p. 11.
 1959-60: Residual.
 1961: Small plant production of synthetic ammonia was 5,000 tons, or 2% of
 total nitrogen fertilizer output (KJJP, 15 June 1966). Small plant percentages refer
 to total nitrogen excluding ammonium nitrate. Large and small plant nitrogen
 production could be derived since one ton of synthetic ammonia yields four tons
 of ammonium bicarbonate.
 1962: Production was 60 times the 1949 level (FBIS, 13 March 1963, p. ccc 5).
 Small plant production was estimated to provide a transition to later figures which
 could be more accurately determined.
 1963: Total nitrogen production increased 22% (TKP, 16 December 1963, p. 1).
 Small plant ammonia production went up 66% over that of 1962 (NCNA,
 22 September 1964). The 66% increase was applied to small plant nitrogen fertilizer
 production.
 1964: Small plant output doubled from 1963 (see source under Nitrogen for 1965)
 and small plant ammonia production was claimed to be 10% of the total (NCNA,
 22 May 1964). Large plant output was derived by assuming the same percentage
 of nitrogen as for small plants.
 1965: Peking stated  (KJJP, 15 June 1966) that small plants accounted for 12%
 of total nitrogen output. Because there was an approximate yearly doubling of
 small plant nitrogen capacity since 1961 (KJJP, 15 June 1966), the small plant
 total could be estimated. Large plant nitrogen output could then be computed.

 1966: On the basis of an approximate yearly doubling trend of small plant output
 noted above, 580,000 tons was taken for the 1966 production. Assuming that
 small plants accounted for 12% of nitrogen output as in the previous year,
 production was derived for large plants.
 1967: Small plants were continuing to increase in capacity during this period.
 1968: With continued increases in capacity, small plants were claimed to account
 for one-third of total nitrogen output (JMJP, 10 April 1969).
 1969: Small plant nitrogenproductive capacity was claimed to have increased about
 six times since 1965 (Peking Review, 13 June 1969). The figure thus obtained
 was increased slightly to provide a smooth transition between the small plant
 percentage shares given for 1968 and 1970.
 1970: Small plant output went up 60% over 1969 and reached 43% of national
 nitrogen production (Economic Reporter, January-March 1971, p. 21). Large plant
 output was derived on the basis of this information.
 1971: Total production was assumed to remain at approximately 56% of chemical
 fertilizer, and small plant output was claimed to account for 50% of the national
 nitrogen figure (SCMP, 15-19 May 1972, p. 210).
 1972: FBIS, 26 December 1972, p. BI specified a 23.4% increase in nitrogen
 fertilizer. Small plant production was estimated to have risen to 51 % of the total.
 1973: Total nitrogen production was estimated on the basis of maintaining a
 constant percentage of total chemical fertilizer. Small plants were estimated to
 have contributed 54% on the basis of their synthetic ammonia production (NCNA,
 5 January 1974, p. 13).
 1974: Output of coal fell, affecting the growth of output at small plants. As a
 result, total nitrogen production grew more slowly than in other recent years.
 Phosphorus
 1955-56: Residual. Derived as total less nitrogen.
 1957-58: CKHW, 30 January 1959, p. 11.

 1959-60: Production was assumed to grow at a faster rate than that of nitrogen
 because of its lower base figure.
 1961: Residual. Small plant production was assumed to falll proportionately.
 1962: Residual. As the small plant program was developing rapidly, it was assumed
 to have provided a larger proportion of production.
 1963: Residual. Capacity was estimated to be less than 1.2 million tons by the
 Journal of World P & K, June 1963, p. 4).
 1964: Residual. Capacity was reported to be more than 2 million tons (JMJP,
 5 August 1964, p. 2). CHCW, 7 February 1965 claimed that 40% of total
 production came from small and medium-sized plants. Small plant production of
 phosphorus was derived by using small plant nitrogen output and total output.
 1965: Residual. Small plants were claimed to have produced 80% of total
 phosphorus (WHP, 2 October 1966).
 1966: Residual. Small plant capacity was claimed to have increased by 760,000
 tons in 1966 (NCNA, 17 September 1966). The increase in production was
 estimated at two-thirds of that figure, based on assumed start-up difficulties.
 1967: Small plants were assumed to have experienced a decline of 20% in output
 because of problems in general with extractive industries.
 1968: Residual. Small plants were assumed to have produced the same proportion
 of the total as in the previous year.
 1969: Residual. As conditions normalized, small plant production was assumed
 to have returned to 70% of the total as in 1966.
 1970: Residual. Small plant production was estimated on the basis of the percentage
 role it played in 1973.
 1971: Residual. Small plant output was derived from the claim that small plants
 produce 60% of all chemical fertilizer (FBIS, 3 January 1972, p. B12) and the
 small plant nitrogen figure.

 1972: Small plants were assumed to have accounted for about 75% of the total
 on the basis of the claim for the following year.
 1973: Residual. Small plants were claimed to have accounted for 75% of total
 phosphate production (FBIS,  14 January 1974, p. B 10).
 1974: Increases in the price of imported phosphate rock cut the purchases that
 predominantly feed large plants. Small plant output is likely to have fallen less
 as domestic rock deposits were utilized more intensively.
 Deposits in the dry salt lakes of Tsinghai Province are the main source of supply
 for potassium production, but are supplemented by sea salt recovery operations
 in the eastern provinces. The nature of production techniques makes it particularly
 difficult to estimate total output. The series presented here parallels recent British
 Sulfur Corporation figures (Statistical Supplement No. 10, Nov-Dec 1974).
