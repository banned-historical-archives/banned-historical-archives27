 A person like Chou En-lai, on the other
 hand, said to us something like the follow-
 ing: "The aid which we take the liberty of
 offering to you is not what we would like it
 to be.  It is too modest, as compared with
 our feelings of friendship and esteem. for
 you, and we thank you for being so kind as
 to accept it.  We must make it clear to you
 that there are absolutely no strings attached
 to that aid, and that you are not required to
 give anything in return.  It is an honor for
 us to be able to contribute, in an extremely
 small way, to your national construction (or
 defense) effort.
 ""We know that your progress is due solely
 to your own efforts, to the work and the
 sacrifices of your people.  We greatly appre-
 ciate your 'friendship, but we do not demand
 that it be exclusive.  We respect your non-
 alinement and understand very well that you
 have other good friends, even among the
 lectuals would have become Communist-
 being pushed into the Communist camp by
 the lack of understanding, distrust, and in-
 justice of the Americans and their disciples.
 The  Communist  powers  know  perfectly
 well that my presence in the government
 serves as a restraint on the communization
 of Cambodia.
 But they are much too smart to fight me
 and our government right now.                    They still
 need me for a while; they need my uncom-
 promising nationalism, for Cambodia to re-
 sist the pressures and provocations of the   -
 American camp.
 By fighting me now, the Communist pow-
 ers would certainly not throw me into ,the
 arms of the free world, even less into the
 arms of the Americans.  But they would
 alienate the majority of the khmer people,
 of our clergy, of our army, and of our police,
 who are irreversibly nationalistic,  And that,
 mistake would create insurmountable diffi-
 culties for a seizure of power by the Red`
 klmers of the pracheachon and by the ex-
 powers of the free world."
 You will note the difference in the ways
 of giving.  On one side we are being hu-
 miliated, we are given a lecture, we are re-
 quired to give something in return.  On the

 Independent and genuinely free states headed  _
 by obstinate and even intractable leaders,
 like De Gaulle in France and (I say this
 without false modesty)  Sihanuk in Cam-
 bodia.
 She preferred to create a chain of lamenta-
 bly vassalized nations supported at a loss-
 a rotten branch, deceiving from a distance
 but .breaking as soon as one leans against it.
 The Americans will understand only after
 their total effacement of the third-world that
 an ideal, or an ideology, is not conquered by
 the force of arms or money, but by offering
 another ideal, or another ideology, more in
 keeping with the nature and aspirations of
 man-accepted as an intelligent being.
 For having tried to make them understand
 this vital truth, the France of General do
 Gaulle-which, pursuing his line of reason-
 ing to the end, this year refused to partici-
 pate in the work of SEATO as a rightful
 member-the Americans and their fanatics
 called France, I said, a saboteur of the anti-
 Communist  alliance  and  accused her of
 "playing into the hands of Peiping."
 If France, a big power, ally of the United
 States of America and member of the atomic
 club, has for the Americans become the pur-.,
 veyor of communism, how can we expect our

 That is the lesson to be learned from the
 aberrant policy of the Americans.  That will
 be the conclusion to be drawn from their
 startling and decisive failure in the third
 world.
 POSTSCRIPT
 May I be permitted to quote, as last month,
 .these astonishingly accurate and deep lines
 written by the great British historian, Ar-
 nold Toynbee, from his book, "The United
 States of  America,  Involuntary Heirs to
 'Odious Colonialism":
 "To the people who suffered under West-
 ern domination in the past' his voice (Presi-
 'dent Johnson's-the author) sounds like the
 Ifaiser's and Hitler's.  The United States of
 America is absolutely against the determina-
 tion of the non-Western majority of the
 human race to bring about their own libera-
 tion from Western domination, which it has
 endured for the last 200 years.
 "The United States of America, not realiz-
 ing what she had done (to deserve this), has
 fallen heir to British, French, Dutch, and
 -Japanese  colonialism.  Consequently,  she
 has attracted to herself the hatred aroused:
 by the European and Japanese colonialists
 against themselves. It is a formidable herit-
 age; and even the U.S. military potential
 will not be strong enough to bear up under
 it for long.  The haste on the part of the
 United States of America to occupy the place
 in Vietnam which had been Inevitably va-
 cated by France demonstrated that colonial-
 ism had ceased to be possible (or, accept-
 able).  By assuming this anachronistic role,
 the United States of America has placed her-
 self into an untenable position.
 "When the non-Western people got rid of
 European  and  Japanese  colonialism,  they
 thought for u while that they had really re-.
 gained their independence.  But now., the
 Americans have taken on the relief and are
 dictating to the Asians what they should or ',
 should not do.' In other words, the Ameri
 cans, In their turn, are treating the. Asiatics
 like natives, which is making them furious.
 "The only practical foundation for co-
 existence between the non-Western'majority
 and the Western minority of the human race.:
 is the absolute equality of relations.
 "All Western powers, even including the
 United States and the weak but incorrigible'
 Portugal, will have to accept equality in the
 long run.  The sooner they accept it, the
 smaller will be the price they will have to
 pay,
 This final condemnation of U.S. ,foreign
 policy is even more impressive in that it was.
 voiced by an eminent Westerner, a, citizen
 of a country that is a loyal ally of the United
 States of America.
 The price the American people will have
 to pay for the blunder of their leaders .will;
 ,oertainly be a very heavy one.
