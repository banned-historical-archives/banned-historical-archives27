China: Economic Performance 
in 1987 and Outlook for 1988 
Summary Two economic problems most concerned China's leaders last year?
Information available 
as of 21 April 1988 
was used in this report. 
excessive inflation and lagging grain output: 
? China's official inflation rate was 7 percent in 1987?an improvement 
over the 9-percent rate of 1985, but higher than any other year in the last 
decade. Urban consumers were especially hard hit. Food prices rose at 
double-digit rates. Inflation rates of over 20 percent were reported in 
several major cities. Indeed, Beijing has acknowledged that the real 
incomes of one-fifth of China's urban dwellers declined. 
? Grain production did not meet Beijing's admittedly ambitious target level 
of 405 million metric tons, though China produced more than 400 million 
tons?a feat accomplished only once before. Strong consumer demand 
for grain-based foods?bread, meat, and beer?and moderate interna-
tional grain prices led China to more than double its grain imports, 
becoming a net grain importer after two years as a net exporter. To 
dampen demand and inflationary pressures, Beijing resumed the practice 
of issuing ration tickets for pork, eggs, and sugar in several major cities. 
Inflation and lagging grain output have led Beijing to avoid economic 
policies that run the risk of worsening, rather than improving, price 
stability and grain production. Tighter central controls over prices, bank 
credit, and out-of-plan investment, plus increased state spending on 
agricultural infrastructure projects?proven ways of reducing upward 
pressure on prices and stimulating agricultural output?form the core of 
Beijing's approach to these problems this year. 
The economy turned in a solid performance in other areas. Urban 
industrial output rose nearly 15 percent, profits and taxes remitted to the 
state increased nearly 10 percent, and labor productivity was up about 8 
percent in 1987. Chinese leaders generally credited the implementation of 
a contract system in industry?under which enterprises sign performance 
agreements with their supervisory bureaus specifying minimum output, 
earnings, and taxes?for the improved industrial performance. By last 
December, three-fourths of China's larger state enterprises had signed 
such contracts, and a majority of collective enterprises had adopted a 
parallel contract/leasing system. The contract system will remain in place 
for the near term, and some Chinese leaders would like to see it become a 
permanent feature of industrial policy. To introduce even greater fiscal 
accountability and managerial autonomy to enterprises, China adopted a 
111

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/08: CIA-RDP11S00229R000301520001-8 
new state enterprise law in March 1988 that spells out the responsibilities 
of factory managers and factory-level party officials, and Beijing may also 
implement bankruptcy regulations enacted in late 1986 before the end of 
this year. 
The contract system also forms the basis for reforms of China's foreign 
trade sector, which also performed well in 1987. China's trade deficit 
declined by 70 percent, from $12 billion in 1986 to only $3.7 billion. 
Foreign direct investment picked up after a disappointing 1986, and 
China's foreign exchange reserves jumped more than 50 percent, to $15 
billion. The particularly strong record has permitted the leadership to 
consider adopting more fundamental reforms in the management of foreign 
trade than it is likely to risk in agriculture or pricing industrial output. Vir-
tually all of China's leaders have endorsed the strategy of export-led 
development in China's coastal areas enunciated by party Secretary Zhao 
Ziyang last January. Beijing also has placed many local branches of 
national trading corporations under provincial or municipal jurisdiction, 
increasing their autonomy from Beijing. To encourage individual factories 
to step up exports, Beijing has increased the portion of foreign exchange 
they may retain from exports. Beijing has even begun to allow Chinese 
enterprises to exchange surplus foreign exchange for domestic currency at 
premium rates in officially sanctioned swap centers, another inducement to 
export. As in industry, these changes are designed to make individual 
factories and corporations more responsive to market conditions. 
China's economy will probably turn in another mixed performance in 1988. 
There are preliminary indications that droughts may decrease grain yields, 
limiting the near-term benefits of price and investment increases. In 
contrast, Chinese statistics for the first quarter of the year indicate that 
growth in industrial output may surpass last year's level. Primarily because 
of continued strong growth in exports, moreover, China's first quarter 1988 
trade deficit was 40 percent below the level of a year earlier. Imports will 
probably pick up, however, as Beijing eases controls over purchases of 
materials, components, and equipment for use in export-processing ven-
tures in China's coastal areas. 
Beijing's chief problem in 1988 may be managing inflation. China's retail 
price index reached double digits in the first quarter of 1988?twice the 
level of first quarter 1987?and Chinese officials acknowledge they will 
have a difficult time keeping inflation below 10 percent for the year, even if

it tapers off in the second half as planned. Sharp increases in industrial out-
put will strain already tight supplies of energy and raw materials. Inflation, 
moreover, will also be fueled by workers' demands for increased bonuses 
after a year of belt-tightening. 
Crucial but politically sensitive price reforms will proceed slowly over the 
near term in order to minimize economic dislocations among consumers. 
This year, Beijing will incrementally increase state-set prices for grain in 
order to stimulate production. But efforts to erode differentials between in-
plan and market prices for raw materials and other industrial inputs will be 
slowed until Beijing reduces inflationary pressures.

China: Economic Performance 
in 1987 and Outlook for 1988 
Economic Performance in 1987 
China's real GNP rose 9.4 percent in 1987, up from a 
7.8-percent increase in 1986, but below the double-
digit growth rates of 1984 and 1985. After particular-
ly rapid growth during the first half of the year, 
Beijing tightened credit in order to rein in investment, 
which had seriously strained industrial supplies and 
exerted upward pressure on prices. Fixed asset invest-
ment nonetheless increased 17 percent in 1987, with 
the strongest gains coming from collectives and pri-
vate individuals. State investment in raw materials, 
energy, light industry, and factory renovation projects 
also grew fairly rapidly. 
China's retail price index rose 7.3 percent during the 
year, according to official Chinese statistics, and some 
cities recorded double-digit inflation rates. Food price 
increases?up more than 10 percent?were responsi-
ble for most of the rise in the price index, roughly half 
of which is based on food. In real terms, accordingly, 
urban per capita income increased only 1.7 percent, 
and one-fifth of China's urban households experi-
enced a decline in their real incomes. Inflation also 
eroded gains in rural per capita income, which showed 
a 5.3-percent increase in real terms. 
The Rural Economy 
Gross agricultural output rose 4.7 percent in real 
terms last year, up from 3.4 percent in 1986, largely 
because of a strong performance in cash crop produc-
tion. Grain production reached 402 million metric 
tons, up 3 percent from 1986, but still below the 
record harvest of 407 million metric tons in 1984 (see 
figure 1). After two years of being a net grain 
exporter, China last year resumed its status as a net 
importer of grain, purchasing approximately 16 mil-
lion metric tons?primarily from Canada, Australia, 
and the United States (see figure 2). 
China's lagging grain production is in part a reflection 
of the success of reforms in the rural sector. For 
example, after achieving double-digit growth rates in 
the early 1980s through a combination of favorable

weather, increased financial incentives for peasants, 
and implementation of household-based farming, 
Beijing loosened central controls over peasants in 
1985, allowing them to produce the crops of their 
choice after fulfilling contractual obligations to the 
state for grain production. At the same time, Beijing 
relaxed state controls over the prices of nonstaple 
foodstuffs such as vegetables, fruit, and meat. Free 
market prices for cash crops soared, while the state 
dropped grain prices to avoid another grain surplus 
the size of that in 1984. Cash crop production conse-
quently began to draw an increasing share of China's 
farmland, and as a result, cash crop output gains have 
far outpaced increases in grain production. Low feed-
grain prices also encouraged peasants to raise live-
stock. However, the ensuing jump in meat production 
in 1985 and 1986 reduced the profitability of produc-
ing livestock and led to last year's return to rationing 
of pork (see table 1). 
State investment in agricultural infrastructure has 
continued to decline both in real terms and as a share 
of total capital construction expenditures, and neither 
local government agencies nor peasants have taken up

the slack. Beijing has permitted local officials to 
exercise greater autonomy in deciding how to allocate 
state investment funds in rural areas?and rural 
officials often have chosen to develop profitable rural 
industries on farmland rather than to make invest-
ments in agricultural infrastructure projects. Mean-
while, peasants have invested their savings in housing 
or consumer goods, fearing that changes in Beijing's 
agricultural policies might deprive them of benefits 
from infrastructural investments. Thus, total farm-
land has decreased and improvements needed in rural 
infrastructure have been lacking. 
Tight grain supplies in 1987 were also the result of a 
continuing rise in consumer demand, as rapidly rising 
incomes raised purchases of a variety of foodstuffs 
3

requiring grain inputs. Strong demand for bread, 
beer, cooking oil, meat, and eggs has strained supplies 
of high-quality grains, oilseeds, and feedgrains. To 
dampen demand and minimize inflationary pressures, 
Beijing has resumed the practice of issuing ration 
tickets for such food products as eggs and sugar in 
several major cities. 
In contrast to grain, China's rural industrial output 
posted strong growth in 1987. Indeed, rural industry 
and commerce are among the most dynamic segments 
of the Chinese economy, and now employ about 15 
percent of China's labor force?more than 85 million

people. Rural industrial output grew by 36 percent in 
1987 in real terms, and rural industries earned $5 bil-
lion from exports?about 15 percent of China's total 
export earnings. 
Industrial Performance 
China's urban industrial output grew 15 percent in 
1987 in real terms (see figure 3). Growth was especial-
ly rapid in the private and collective sectors, and the 
output of foreign-invested enterprises nearly doubled 
during the year?although it remains a very small 
portion of China's total industrial output. Production 
of consumer goods, farm machinery, motor vehicles, 
and chemical fertilizers and pesticides grew at double-
digit rates. 
China's output of electricity grew at a recordsetting 
pace?roughly 10 percent?but nonetheless failed to 
match the growth in industrial output. Power short-
ages continued to idle roughly one-fifth of China's 
industrial capacity. In contrast to healthy growth in 
electricity output, China's production of coal and oil 
rose only 3 percent.' 
Chinese statistics indicate that state enterprises im-
proved their operating efficiency in 1987. Profits rose 
6 percent and labor productivity increased by nearly 8 
percent. But one-eighth of China's state enterprises 
'China is the world's second-largest producer of coal, after the 
United States, and fourth-largest producer of crude oil, following

continued to lose money, and the size of those losses 
was larger last year than in 1986. By and large, 
factory managers have faulted rising input prices for 
their losses. Beijing last year deliberately increased 
state procurement prices for industrial crops such as 
cotton in order to stimulate production; at the same 
time, Beijing has encouraged the development of a 
raw materials market in which producers and users of 
such goods as steel, cement, and lumber buy and sell 
industrial inputs at free market?and substantially 
higher than state-set?prices. Last year, for example, 
for the first time a majority of China's rolled steel was 
distributed outside of the state plan. 
International Trade and Investment 
Concerned about the level of foreign exchange re-
serves resulting from two years of substantial trade 
deficits and lackluster foreign direct investment in-
flows, Beijing tightened controls over imports and 
foreign exchange expenditures last year. At the same 
time, Beijing stepped up efforts to boost the country's 
export earnings. As a result, China's trade deficit 
shrank from $12 billion in 1986 to only $3.7 billion in 
1987, according to Chinese Customs statistics (see 
table 2 and figure 4). With a net gain of $3.4 billion in 
earnings from tourism and other services, Beijing's 
current account was nearly in balance. Accordingly, 
official foreign exchange reserves grew from $9.9 
billion in January to $15.2 billion in December 1987, 
sufficient to cover more than four months' imports.

Hong Kong displaced Japan as China's top trading 
partner as Beijing curbed its purchases from Japan to 
reduce the large bilateral trade imbalance, diversify 
sources of supply, and find lower cost suppliers less 
affected by currency appreciation. Hong Kong also 
drew a larger share of China's exports, many of which 
the territory subsequently reexported to the United 
States and other destinations?including Taiwan and 
South Korea. The United States, West Germany, and 
the Soviet Union followed Hong Kong and Japan as 
China's major trade partners. 
China's imports remained stagnant for the second 
year in a row as a result of tighter procedures for 
allocating foreign exchange and closer monitoring of 
purchases to avoid duplication and encourage import 
substitution when possible. Purchases centered on 
industrial machinery not available domestically, 
equipment and raw materials to be used in export 
processing, and agricultural inputs such as fertilizer 
and pesticides. Reflecting Beijing's concerns about 
316739 4-88 
lagging grain output, imports of grains increased by 
more than 60 percent in value terms, totaling 
$1.6 billion. Reduced international grain prices also 
contributed to the surge in grain imports; Beijing took 
advantage of prices driven down by subsidies from the 
European Community and by the US Export En-
hancement Program to complement domestic output 
(see table 3). 
On the export side, China's 1987 performance demon-
strates the success of Beijing's efforts to promote 
rapid growth by: 
? Providing priority domestic investment funds to 
export-producing projects. 
? Allowing export-producing Chinese factories to re-
tain a share of their foreign exchange earnings. 
? Providing state subsidies to cover the losses of 
exporters selling goods at world prices that are 
below China's costs of production.

? Devaluing the Chinese currency relative to most 
major world currencies.' 
? Giving foreign investors special tax and other incen-
tives for participation in factories producing for 
foreign markets. 
China's export earnings grew by more than one-fourth 
last year?to nearly $40 billion. Export earnings from 
industrial and manufactured goods increased from 63 
percent of the total in 1986 to 66 percent. China's 
most striking export gains have come in textiles and 
apparel shipments?which last year accounted for 
about one-fourth of China's total exports. According 
to Chinese press reports, China is the world's largest 
silk producer and exporter?with its raw silk exports 
accounting for 90 percent of global sales volume, and 
silk fabric exports making up 40 percent of the world 
market. China also has become the world's second-
largest supplier of raw cotton by volume, after the 
United States. Raw cotton exports earned Beijing 
nearly $750 million last year, a 50;percent jump over 
1986. 
Beijing recognizes that foreign managerial and tech-
nical expertise has contributed significantly to 
China's ability to boost exports. Export earnings by 
foreign-invested enterprises doubled in 1987 to $1 bil-
lion. According to China's Ministry of Foreign Eco-
nomic Relations and Trade, China has signed con-
tracts for more than 10,000 foreign-funded 
enterprises, 4,300 of which are now in operation. 
China's paid-in foreign investment reached $8.5 bil-
lion by the end of last year, showing a $1.9 billion 
increase in 1987?probably reflecting both investors' 
more favorable view of China's investment climate in 
the wake of new legislation adopted in late 1986 and 
appreciation of the Japanese yen and other currencies 
that have encouraged investment in regions with 
lower labor costs. But the apparent improvement in 
China's ability to draw foreign investment also re-
flects the depressed level of investment in 1986 as 
Beijing curbed inflows of foreign funds to nonproduc-
tive activities such as hotels.' 
'Beijing has not devalued the Chinese yuan against the US 
dollar?to which it is unofficially pegged?since mid-1986. As the 
dollar has fallen, however, the value of the yuan has effectively 
declined relative to many other currencies.

US-China Trade. China's exports to the United 
States rose by one-third last year, according to US 
Commerce Department statistics, reflecting the suc-
cess of China's overall export push. US sales to China 
increased by 12 percent?recovering from a slump in 
1986?but remained below the record level of 1985.. 
Accordingly, the US deficit widened to $3.4 billion, 
60 percent higher than in 1986. 
Paralleling trends in China's overall exports, light 
industrial goods are becoming an ever larger share of 
China's sales to the United States. Exports of sporting 
goods, toys, travel goods, handbags, footwear, and 
tape recorders have grown especially rapidly. Textiles

China's exports to the United States (see table 4). In 
value terms, according to US Commerce Department 
statistics, China ranked as the United States' second-
largest supplier of textile yarns and fabrics and as its 
fourth-largest supplier of clothing. The United States, 
in turn, was China's largest market for clothing, and 
third-largest purchaser of yarns and fabric, after 
Hong Kong and Japan, according to Chinese Customs 
statistics. Despite the signing of a four-year bilateral 
textile accord last December that limits increases in 
the volume of China's exports in specified categories 
to 3.3 percent annually, the value of China's textile 
exports to the United States will probably continue to 
increase as Chinese apparel producers continue their 
move into higher quality and higher priced articles. 
Regarding US exports to China, the most rapid gains 
have occurred in agricultural commodities. China's 
purchases of US grains jumped more than twentyfold 
in 1987, while its imports of fertilizers, organic chemi-
cals, edible oils, live animals, and oilseeds more than 
doubled. Machinery and transport equipment ac-
counted for more than 40 percent of US sales to 
China in 1987, as the United States continued to

benefit from China's strong demand for capital equip-
ment for upgrading factories and aircraft for upgrad-
ing the civil air transportation network (see table 5). 
High-technology equipment (computers, aerospace 
equipment, telecommunications gear, scientific instru-
ments, machine tools, and microelectronics devices) 
accounted for roughly one-third of China's purchases 
from the United States, as it has for the last three 
years. By the same token, the United States continued 
to supply about one-third of China's imports of high-
technology goods, a share of the market that has 
remained strong for the last five years (see tables 6-8). 
Sino-Soviet Trade. Sino-Soviet trade dipped in 1987 
to $2.5 billion, after reaching $2.6 billion in 1986. A 
number of factors contributed to the modest decline: 
? Tight domestic grain supplies constrained Beijing's 
ability to meet export commitments. 
? Chinese dissatisfaction with the quality and techni-
cal level of Soviet industrial equipment postponed 
many of the 24 industrial cooperation projects slated 
to take place under the five-year accord signed in 
July 1985.

Statistical Discrepancies 
China's Customs statistics differ considerably from 
those recorded by the US Commerce Department. 
China calculates it had a $1.8 billion deficit with the 
United States last year, rather than a $3.4 billion 
surplus. A major reason for the discrepancy is that 
the United States tallies all goods shipped to and 
from China, regardless of whether they are shipped 
directly or through third parties such as Hong Kong; 
China only includes direct shipments. In addition, the 
practice of including insurance and freight costs in 
the value of imports from the other partner accounts 
for about $1 billion of the $5.2 billion gap in trade 
statistics. The discrepancy between Chinese and US 
trade statistics has grown in recent years because 
China is shipping a larger share of its exports to the 
United States via Hong Kong.

? Trade reform and decentralization in both countries 
have made it more difficult for Beijing and Moscow 
to ensure that individual factories and trade corpo-
rations adhere to trade commitments made at the 
central level. 
Other factors will doubtless continue to constrain 
Sino-Soviet trade even if the countries iron out some 
of the specific problems that arose last year. For 
example, barter trade is by nature a cumbersome 
arrangement, with trade officials required to meet 
annually to negotiate the types and values of goods to 
be traded. Moreover, China and the Soviet Union 
both generally prefer to export their better goods to 
the West for hard currency instead of to each other, 
leading to reciprocal complaints about the dumping of 
inferior goods. Bilateral trade should therefore remain 
a small percentage of each country's total trade and

will be dwarfed by their trade with the United States 
and other Western partners. The Soviet Union is 
China's fifth-largest trade partner, accounting for 
about 3 percent of China's total trade, according to 
Chinese Customs statistics. 
Government Budget and Spending Priorities 
China's budget deficit widened in 1987 to $2.2 billion 
(8 billion yuan), equivalent to 3 percent of state 
revenue and about 1 percent of GNP' (see figure 6). 
This increase was not unexpected. Increased state 
investment expenditures accounted for some of the 
drain, as Beijing targeted priority construction pro-
jects in energy, raw materials, and light industry. But 
higher state subsidies to cover the losses of money-
losing enterprises and state trading corporations ex-
porting goods priced higher in China than in foreign 
markets, as well as payments to urban consumers to 
soften the impact of higher food prices, accounted for 
a growing share of the budget. Subsidy payments 
exceeded one-fourth of state expenditures. 
? Using Western accounting procedures, China's budget deficit was 
probably twice the level reported, equivalent to 7 percent of 
government revenue and 2 percent of GNP. China records receipts 
from domestic bond sales and central government borrowing from 
foreign sources as state revenues. China's net domestic bond issues 
in 1987 were equivalent to $1.1 billion (4 billion yuan), and its net 
foreign borrowing to cover state expenditures was equivalent to $1.4 
billion (5.1 billion yuan). 
11 
Beijing expects the budget to remain in the red for 
several more years, and is projecting another $2.2 
billion shortfall for 1988, despite an anticipated $500 
million (2 billion yuan) gain in tax revenues and a 
planned 50-percent increase in treasury bond issues. 
According to the Finance Minister, food subsidies will 
rise by 22 percent, and state investment in agriculture 
will jump 15 percent. Earlier this year, China's State 
Council instructed government offices and state-
funded institutions to reduce spending by 20 percent 
in 1988 and banned purchases of a variety of items. 
The streamlining of government ministries and com-
missions announced at the National People's Congress 
(NPC) in March is also expected to cut costs. Begin-
ning in June, China will create a new State Economic 
Planning Commission by merging two existing com-
missions, and replace 12 other industrial ministries 
and bureaus with nine new ministries and four state-
operated corporations. The net result is an expected 
reduction in State Council personnel from approxi-
mately 50,000 to 40,000. In addition to the fiscal 
benefits expected from the reshuffling, China's lead-
ers expect it to reduce government interference in 
enterprise management and to transform ministries 
into more efficient government organs.

Defense Spending. China releases statistics on nation-
al defense spending as a line item in the annual state 
budget, but provides neither a definition of the cate-
gories of expenditure included in the figure nor a 
breakdown of the total. Our own estimates of Chinese 
defense expenditures cover spending for investment 
(primarily weapon procurement); operating expenses 
(including maintenance and personnel costs); and re-
search, development, testing and evaluation 
(RDT&E). Using a building-block approach for valu-
ing the costs of these various components, we estimate 
that China's total defense expenditures for 1986 were 
roughly 45 billion yuan, more than twice that of the 
announced budget of 20 billion yuan. Using current 
exchange rates, this is about $12 billion. We believe 
the defense budget increased modestly in 1987. 
Despite the difference in absolute values, China's 
announced figures and the CIA estimates both show 
declining trends in the defense Sector's share of 
China's budget as well as in the size of the defense 
316741 4-88 
budget relative to gross national income (GNI). CIA 
estimates indicate that defense expenditures account-
ed for about one-third of China's total budget in 1978, 
and only one-fifth of the budget in 1987. Moreover, 
we estimate China's defense spending dropped from 
12 percent of gross national income in 1978 to only 5 
percent in 1987?somewhat less than the 7 percent 
for the United States, and significantly less than the 
20 to 25 percent for the Soviet Union (see figure 7). 
China has cut military spending by slashing personnel 
costs and postponing the procurement of most major 
weapon systems. Beijing has reduced its armed forces 
by about 3 million men since 1977, with most of the 
China began to publish gross national product (GNP) figures in 
1985, but has provided gross national income (GNI) statistics for 
the entire 1949-87 period. In recent years, GNI has been roughly 
equal to 80 percent of GNP.

China's military operating budget?nearly half of 
which goes for salaries?has declined by about one-
fifth during the last eight years. Beijing intends to 
complete the force reduction by the end of this year, 
but we believe that it may take several more years 
before demobilized men find civilian jobs and are 
moved from military posts. Expenditures on weapon 
procurement also declined about 10 percent between 
1978 and 1986 because Beijing has elected to post-
pone major weapon purchases until more technologi-
cally advanced systems become available. In contrast, 
we estimate that RDT&E expenditures have in-
creased about 25 percent since 1978, although this 
category continues to account for only about one-
eighth of China's defense expenditures.

Economic Policy in 1988 
Beijing has announced a modest reform agenda for 
this year that postpones crucial but politically sensi-
tive price reform pending reductions in the inflation 
rate, increases in grain output, and improvements in 
enterprise efficiency. Premier Li Peng announced in 
mid-February?and reaffirmed in his report to the 
National People's Congress in March?that China's 
top economic priorities in 1988 would be controlling 
inflation and improving agricultural output.

prices of consumer goods and public utility fees last

The 13th Party Congress 
The 13th Party Congress of October-November 1987 
was a crucial test of strength for China's reform 
leaders. In the aftermath of the ouster of Party 
Secretary Hu Yaobang in January 1987, reform-
minded Chinese officials sought to install younger, 
more pragmatic leaders in positions of authority, 
defuse ideological questions about the reform pro-
gram, and obtain an endorsement for a wider role for 
market forces in the Chinese economy. Those goals 
were generally achieved: 
? Zhao Ziyang was confirmed as Party Secretary, 
and joined by four new appointees on the Politburo 
Standing Committee?the most powerful body in 
the party. These represented a balance between 
market-oriented reformers aligned with Zhao and 
officials who, like Premier Li Peng, favor a greater 
role for the central government in managing the 
economy. New appointees to the Politburo and the 
Central Committee also gave these bodies a more 
reformist cast. And former Party Secretary Hu 
Yaobang remained on the Politburo, a rebuff to 
reform opponents who forced his ouster as General 
Secretary. 
? The Congress endorsed an ideological justification 
for a wide range of reform proposals contained in 
Zhao Ziyang's work report to the Congress. The 
"initial stage of socialism" theory provides for a 
century of experimentation with economic re-
forms?including private ownership, and the leas-
ing of land and enterprises?as long as the "public-
ly owned" sector of the economy is predominant. 
? Zhao 's work report endorsed greater use of markets 
for distributing raw materials, capital, technology, 
and labor. The report also indicated that central 
ministries should focus primarily on making over-
all industrial policy, leaving the implementation to 
lower-level entities responding to economic levers. 
Zhao also previewed some of the foreign trade 
reforms planned for 1988 as a result of impressive 
trade performance in 1987. 
Reformers' gains were not unqualified, however. 
Decisionrnaking by consensus continues to involve a 
wide spectrum of opinion about the pace and scope of 
reform, and a number of influential Chinese leaders 
remain more comfortable with an economy predomi-
nantly controlled by administrative fiat, rather than 
by market forces. Moreover, reformers face signifi-
cant practical problems in implementing many poli-
cies in the face of high inflation, growing state budget 
deficits, and large out-of-plan capital investments. 
produced in excess of state quotas and previously sold 
at market prices. In addition, Beijing plans to limit 
growth in the money supply by tightening controls 
over bank lending, and by requiring successful state 
enterprises to fund planned expansion by issuing 
bonds rather than drawing on bank loans, which carry 
a lower interest rate. The state is also reducing its 
investment in capital construction. Finally, Beijing is 
trying to trim personal consumption. Leaders hope 
that enterprise reforms will slow growth in worker 
wages and bonuses, thereby curbing demand. Mean-
while, Beijing expects that rent increases resulting 
from a reduction in state housing subsidies will soak 
up some of the excess funds now available to 
consumers. 
Managing Agriculture 
In the agricultural sector, Beijing is undertaking 
several major initiatives designed to stimulate grain 
production: 
? Raising purchase prices for grain produced and sold 
under state contracts. Beijing intends over time to 
phase out the current dual-track agricultural pricing 
system either by reducing the share of grain pro-
cured under contracts and increasing free market 
transactions, raising the prices the state pays for 
contract grain, or instituting price differentials 
based on quality with the aim of eventually selling 
high-quality grain at free market prices.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/08: CIA-RDP11S00229R000301520001-8 
? Increasing state investment in fertilizer and pesti-
cide production, in transportation and distribution 
networks, and in agricultural infrastructure projects 
such as irrigation. Beijing is concentrating rural 
loans as well as state investment on grain produc-
tion. Beijing may also invest tax revenues collected 
from nonfarm rural land use in agriculture. 
? Allowing peasants to purchase and transfer land-use 
rights, which would permit more efficient, larger 
scale operations. Beijing also recently lengthened 
the leasing period for rural land from 15 to 30 years. 
These measures are designed to give farmers a 
greater stake in the land's upkeep. 
? Encouraging peasants to use better seed strains and 
more tractors and other agricultural machinery in 
production. Beijing has introduced several state-
sponsored S&T initiatives in the last few years that 
are designed to improve productivity by providing 
training and funds to rural areas. 
Beijing is sensitive to the inflationary impact that 
substantial increases in grain purchase prices could 
induce and is searching for ways to minimize costs 
that must be borne by urban consumers. At the same 
time, Beijing recognizes that it cannot continue to 
increase subsidy payments, which are already a sub-
stantial drain on the state budget. A variety of 
possibilities are under consideration and will likely be 
the subject of continued debate in 1988. 
Improving Enterprise Profitability 
In the industrial sector, Chinese officials have said 
that the "contract system"?under which state enter-
prises sign performance contracts with supervisory 
bureaus specifying minimum output, earnings, and 
taxes?will form the basis for improvements in enter-
prise management and efficiency in 1988. China's 
leaders acknowledge that enterprises must become 
more efficient before they can absorb increases in 
input prices that would result from price reform and 
believe they must be put on a sound financial footing 
before they can cope with a hardening of the budget 
constraint. 
Three-fourths of China's large- and medium-sized 
state industrial enterprises and commercial entities 
had adopted the contract system by the end of 1987, 
15 
according to Chinese statistics. In addition, a majority 
of China's smaller state and collective enterprises had 
adopted a parallel contract/leasing system that allows 
factory managers to retain a share of aftertax profits 
and requires them to put up collateral to cover 
potential losses. 
Chinese leaders believe the contract system has im-
proved labor productivity and increased profits. In 
addition, they maintain that the contract system has 
helped Beijing improve control over unwarranted en-
terprise investment spending, although China's prac-
tice of permitting enterprises to deduct loan principal 
repayments from taxable income still tends to encour-
age excessive credit demand. Proponents of the con-
tract system also contend that contracts have relieved 
some of the pressure on managers to issue blanket 
bonuses to workers, keeping real wage increases in 
1987 below the rate of improvement in labor produc-
tivity (see figure 8). 
Chinese critics argue that the prospects for continued 
gains under the contract system in 1988 and beyond 
are less bright, however. For example, many of the 
one-year contracts were signed in the second half of 
1987, thus large worker bonuses for fulfillment of 
annual contract targets will not be paid until the 
second half of this year. This, in turn, could exacer-
bate Beijing's difficulties controlling inflation while 
also cutting into enterprise profitability. 
Critics have found fault with several more fundamen-
tal shortcomings as well: 
? Contracts do not make good managers out of bad 
ones, and China's 1987 statistics suggest that, while 
the number of unprofitable enterprises is not in-
creasing, poorly run enterprises are losing ever 
larger amounts of money. 
? The system rewards managers for negotiating low 
targets that can be easily achieved, rather than for 
necessarily improving production efficiency.

? The ability of the contract system to encourage 
greater managerial accountability is limited by Bei-
jing's requirement that large state enterprises em-
ploy surplus workers and produce specified goods, 
regardless of profitability or market demand. 
? Rising prices for industrial inputs?and a freeze on 
the prices most enterprises can charge for their final 
products?means that some factory managers have 
legitimate excuses for low profitability or even 
deficits. 
? Finally, contracts?which generally carry a one- to 
five-year term?tend to discourage investments in 
new technology and capital equipment, which have 
substantial long-term benefits but little immediate 
payoff. 
Still others point to the stultifying effect of the 
contract system on China's reform program as a 
whole, especially on needed changes to the wage and 
price system. Because last year's strong industrial 
317101 5-88 
performance can be traced?at least in part?to the 
implementation of the contract system, advocates of 
other industrial and price reforms will face an uphill 
battle in any attempts to introduce changes to the 
current tax or price structure that would significantly 
affect the performance of enterprises that have signed 
performance contracts. 
Chinese leaders expect a new enterprise law approved 
during the National People's Congress to further 
improve enterprise performance by curbing the med-
dling by party officials in factory operations and by 
paving the way for the institution of bankruptcy 
proceedings against faltering state enterprises. The 
state enterprise law is one of several recent changes in 
industrial policy designed to professionalize enterprise 
management and to hold enterprises and managers 
responsible for deficits. But, like the contract system, 
16 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/08: CIA-RDP11S00229R000301520001-8 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/08: CIA-RDP11S00229R000301520001-8 
ambiguities remain. Moreover, almost every responsi-
bility spelled out for managers and enterprises in the 
legislation is subject to other plans and regulations. 
For example, although the law allows enterprises to 
set prices for their finished goods, they are still subject 
to extensive price controls imposed by Beijing. More-
over, the law is vague about the powers of factory 
party committees, assigning them responsibility for 
implementing "all party and state policies." Finally, 
the law does not reduce the authority of government 
administrative bureaus to set mandatory production 
targets for factories and to manage supply and distri-
bution of most industrial inputs. 
Passage of the enterprise law provides the legal 
framework for Beijing to institute bankruptcy pro-
ceedings against unprofitable state enterprises under 
the provisions of a trial bankruptcy law passed by the 
NPC Standing Committee in December 1986. But 
managers will resist moves to institute bankruptcy 
proceedings, arguing that they cannot be held ac-
countable for deficits resulting from an irrational 
price structure, raw material shortages, and bloated 
work forces. Beijing will probably close only a few 
enterprises at first and will find new jobs for displaced 
workers in order to minimize workers' fears that 
enterprise reforms are a threat to their job stability. 
Reforming the Foreign Trade System 
Following the 13th Party Congress, Chinese leaders 
announced plans to undertake a major reform of the 
country's trade system?originally planned for 1987 
but derailed by both political uncertainties and the 
tight foreign exchange situation at the start of 1987. 
In recent months, trade reform has been reaffirmed in 
several major policy statements: 
? The State Council approved a Draft Plan for Re-
form of the Foreign Trade Sector in December 1987 
that calls for individual factories and trading corpo-
rations to have greater autonomy in conducting 
import and export transactions and to become more 
responsible for their profits and losses. 
? In January 1988, after making several trips to 
China's coastal provinces, Zhao Ziyang pronounced 
that the country should undertake an export-driven 
economic growth strategy centered on attracting 
17 
China's Private Sector 
During the 1988 National People's Congress, China's 
constitution was amended to provide a legal basis for 
China's growing private sector. Chinese statistics 
indicate that the country's private sector now in-
cludes up to 300,000 enterprises and an additional 20 
million "individual enterprises." Most of these are 
one-person or family-run operations, although a few 
employ several hundred people, according to Chinese 
press reports. Although the private sector generally 
leads the country in growth in productivity and 
output, it employs less than 3 percent of China's 
industrial labor force and produces less than 1 
percent of the country's industrial output. The private 
sector is more prominent in retail trade, however, 
handling nearly one-fourth of all retail sales in 1987. 
foreign investment and expertise to coastal areas. 
The strategy focuses on using imported raw materi-
als and parts to produce higher value-added labor-
intensive industrial goods for export. Acknowledg-
ing the crucial role of foreign managerial and 
technical expertise in developing China's export 
industries, Zhao's plan calls for further improve-
ments to China's investment climate. 
? Beijing sponsored three high-level meetings in Feb-
ruary and March of this year to discuss foreign 
trade reforms, China's environment for foreign in-
vestors, and the coastal development strategy. Lead-
ers discussed reform experiments planned for 
Guangdong and Fujian Provinces, as well as for 
Hainan Island?China's newest province and spe-
cial economic zone. 
? Premier Li Peng's March work report to the Na-
tional People's Congress listed trade reform and the 
coastal development strategy among China's priori-
ties for 1988. 
Two factors account for the attention Chinese policy-
makers are giving to foreign trade this year. Chinese 
leaders have said they believe recent changes in the 
world economy occurring as a result of the apprecia-
tion of the currencies of Japan, South Korea, and 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/08: CIA-RDP11S00229R000301520001-8

Taiwan present China with an historic opportunity to 
make inroads in Western markets with Chinese export 
goods priced low relative to similar products from 
other Asian countries. Second, China's strong trade 
performance in 1987 and buoyant foreign reserves 
have given this sector more room for experimenting 
with reforms. 
China has not yet approved a final plan for reforming 
the foreign trade sector. From the numerous state-
ments by Chinese leaders on the topic, however, we 
believe the reforms will include: 
? Decentralization. Provinces and municipalities will 
assume control over local branches of national trade 
corporations and sign contracts with them?similar 
to those now used throughout China's industrial 
sector?assigning levels of exports and foreign ex-
change earnings. More individual factories will be 
allowed to handle trade transactions. China's Minis-
try of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade 
(MOFERT) and central foreign trade corporations 
will continue to provide overall policy guidance, 
handle most of China's barter trade with the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe, approve large-ticket 
purchases, and monitor foreign sales of items China 
must restrict because of either domestic supply 
shortages or foreign import restrictions. 
? Raising Foreign Exchange Retention Rates. Corpo-
rations exceeding their contract targets for foreign 
exchange earnings will be allowed to keep a larger 
share of the surplus. Beijing has also begun to allow 
exporters of light industrial goods, arts and crafts, 
and garments to keep a higher percentage of their 
foreign exchange earnings than most other enter-
prises. The foreign exchange retention rate also 
varies from province to province, and as part of 
China's experimentation with economic reforms in 
Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan, these areas have 
been given higher rates than the norm. 
? Easing Currency Controls. As an outgrowth of the 
new policies on foreign exchange retention, Beijing 
has announced that Chinese entities with excess 
foreign currency will be allowed to swap foreign 
funds for Chinese currency at premium exchange 
rates in swap centers to be set up in many large 
Chinese cities. This is an extension of a practice 
Beijing has permitted for more than a year for 
foreign-invested enterprises in China and for state-
sector Chinese enterprises operating in the special 
economic zones. While easing central control over 
the exchange of Chinese currency for foreign ex-
change, Beijing is also preparing to loosen controls 
over arbitrage between convertible foreign curren-
cies. China's State Administration for Exchange 
Control, in March of this year, authorized financial 
institutions to handle the buying and selling of 
convertible foreign currencies on behalf of Chinese 
enterprises. This will allow enterprises that earn 
foreign exchange in one currency to import goods 
purchased with another currency. Chinese factories 
also will be able to avoid losses in the value of their 
primarily dollar-denominated foreign exchange 
holdings if the dollar continues to decline. 
Other changes are also contemplated. For example, 
Beijing may adjust the domestic tax system to favor 
exporters of high-value-added products. Some Chi-
nese leaders have also proposed that wages of workers 
in enterprises producing for export be linked to for-
eign exchange earnings. Finally, there has been much 
discussion of a plan to make trading corporations into 
commissioned agents that handle import and export 
transactions for a simple service fee. This approach 
would be designed to make enterprises?rather than 
subsidized trade corporations?shoulder the financial 
burden of their imports and reap the benefits accruing 
from successful export programs. 
The impact of these reforms will probably be limited 
as long as wide discrepancies exist between China's 
domestic prices and those prevailing in the interna-
tional marketplace. Although trade corporations and 
factories will be asked to take responsibility for profits 
and losses, many will point to factors beyond their 
control as being responsible for deficits. As a result, 
decentralization of trade authority may merely trans-
fer responsibility for subsidizing enterprise losses from 
the central government to a lower level, rather than 
eliminating the practice. In addition, even though 
some factories and corporations will be allowed to 
have foreign exchange accounts, Beijing will retain 
18

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/08: CIA-RDP11S00229R000301520001-8 
control over most of the country's foreign currency 
reserves, as well as the use of retained foreign ex-
change for imports subject to license approval by the 
central government. Members of the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to which China is 
applying for membership, will be watching the pro-
gress of China's foreign trade reforms closely to 
determine whether the changes bring China's foreign 
trade system more in line with GATT principles. 
Outlook for Price Reform 
Chinese leaders apparently have not reached a con-
sensus on how and when to make further changes in 
China's irrational price structure, although most now 
probably accept the need for prices to accurately 
reflect relative scarcities in the economy. Without 
price reform, China's attempts to make enterprises 
more responsive to market signals?and to hold them 
accountable for poor investment, production, and 
personnel decisions via the initiation of bankruptcy 
proceedings?will fall short. Firms that are well run 
and turn out needed products may operate at a loss 
simply because production costs exceed their product 
prices. Similarly, Beijing probably recognizes that the 
Reverse Blank 
19 
problems in China's agriculture sector cannot be 
resolved without an increase in the price paid to 
farmers to encourage production of needed agricultur-
al commodities as well as an increase in the state-
controlled prices paid by consumers for nonessential 
foodstuffs for which Beijing wants to curb demand. 
But considerable uncertainty remains over precisely 
how to accomplish needed price adjustments without 
disrupting the economy, provoking complaints among 
consumers, or substantially increasing the state's sub-
sidy burden. Chinese leaders apparently are willing to 
proceed slowly in order to minimize dislocations. 
Rather than simply freeing all prices and having 
current economic conditions determine their equilibri-
um level, Beijing is working to erode the differentials 
between in-plan and market prices for a variety of 
commodities?including grain and raw materials?
while also boosting production of items in short supply 
by gradually reducing the share of such items pro-
cured under state plans and by increasing the share 
sold at market prices.

Appendix A 
Evaluating Beijing's Reforms 
China is approaching the 10th anniversary of the 
watershed Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress 
(December 1978), which marked the emergence of 
Deng Xiaoping as preeminent leader and the adoption 
of Beijing's economic reform policies. The core of 
China's reforms is pragmatism. Beijing has scrapped 
Maoist-period theories of "class struggle" and the 
pursuit of modernization through political mass mobi-
lization in favor of rational development strategies, 
including decentralization of economic decision mak-
ing authority, greater use of material incentives, and 
increased economic contact with the West. Many of 
the reforms are not new to China, but had been tried 
or were at least discussed in the mid-1950s and the 
early 1960s. But the period since 1978 is the first time 
that these policies have been implemented without 
interruptions such as the Cultural Revolution of the 
mid-1960s. 
Changes came first and have progressed furthest in 
the countryside. Only isolated remnants remain of the 
Maoist commune system under which local party 
officials exercised almost absolute control over rural 
production decisions and peasants' daily lives. Farm-
ing is now conducted by individual households, which 
lease land from the state under long-term contracts. 
Apart from having to supply some grain to the state 
according to procurement agreements worked out at 
the local level, peasants have wide latitude to decide 
whether to grow grain or cash crops and livestock. 
Millions of peasants have left farming in the past few 
years to work in rural industries and transport or 
commercial enterprises. Nevertheless, the government 
still retains an important role in the rural economy. 
For instance, peasants still depend on state supply 
units to market some of their excess grain and to 
supply farm inputs, including machinery and 
fertilizer. 
Significant changes in the leadership and operations 
of urban state enterprises have also been implemented 
in the past nine years. Beijing has replaced many 
factory directors with younger and better educated 
21 
managers. Moreover, Beijing has increased the 
amount of revenues that factories can retain and has 
allowed managers greater discretion to use those 
revenues for capital construction or worker wages. 
Because factories are allowed to sell at market prices 
any production exceeding the quotas assigned in the 
central plan, output of key industrial materials, such 
as coal and steel, have increased rapidly. Thus many 
enterprises now purchase at least some output at 
prices well above those set by Beijing for in-plan 
production. However, upper-level economic bureau-
cracies and factory party officials still maintain close 
ties to and supervisory control over most state enter-
prises. And political and economic restraints limit 
managers' decisionmaldng authority. For instance, 
managers have the right to fire workers, but choose to 
maintain bloated work forces rather than face the 
wrath of displaced workers. To diminish resistance to 
layoffs, reformers have argued that China should 
construct a social safety net that would supplant the 
welfare functions that state enterprises now assume, 
but Beijing has not made much progress in imple-
menting one. 
That Chinese workers on the whole have benefited 
from reform is indisputable. Rapid gains in standards 
of living are evident in the countryside, where a 
housing boom is under way, and in Chinese cities, 
where an improvement in the quality and style of 
clothing is readily apparent. Increases in agricultural 
and industrial output have caused an improvement in 
workers' diets and an increase in per capita ownership 
of durable goods such as bicycles and refrigerators. 
However, despite these signs of improvement, urban 
residents complain about housing shortages, pollution, 
and inadequate services such as an overcrowded trans-
portation system. Moreover, the real income of some 
urban residents has fallen in recent years, and both 
urban and rural per capita income remains low by

world standards. Finally, media discussion of an 
enterprise bankruptcy law and policies that would 
increase labor mobility have probably increased wor-
kers' concerns that new reforms will decrease job 
security. 
Deng Xiaoping and other key reformers maintain that 
the gains from reform far outweigh the negative 
spillovers and argue that the shortcomings can be 
corrected only through implementing additional poli-
cies. Even so, the reform program has been buffeted 
by both political controversies and unforeseen eco-
nomic developments. To track the progress of reforms 
to date, it may be useful to divide the program into 
three periods. 
Phase One: Agricultural Success 1978-84 
From 1978 to 1984, implementation of rural policies 
dominated the domestic reform program. The period 
began with limited experiments with the "household 
responsibility system," under which individual farm 
households took control of fields, making planting 
decisions and working the land with little interference 
from outside authorities. These experiments began in 
Sichuan Province under the leadership of Zhao 
Ziyang, and in Anhui Province under Wan Li. By the 
end of the period, this system had displaced the 
production team approach?the last vestige of the 
collective system established in the middle and late 
1950s?throughout most of the country. Along with 
increased state prices for farm produce, greatly ex-
panded free market outlets, and good weather, the 
reforms produced a string of bumper harvests culmi-
nating in the record 1984 crop. Indeed, China became 
a net grain exporter in 1985. 
Most other domestic reforms?including those in 
industrial management, finance, and science and 
technology?have their roots in this period as well. 
Chongqing city in Sichuan, for example, was an early 
test site for experiments granting greater autonomy to 
factories. And selected research institutes began to 
sign contracts with factories as enterprises attempted 
to improve production and efficiency by applying new 
technology, and as researchers sought to make science 
23 
serve the economy as a whole. But the scope of these 
nonagricultural reforms remained relatively limited 
through the early 1980s. 
Domestic reforms during this period were accompa-
nied by a more open economic policy toward other 
countries and regions. Beijing, in particular, sought to 
attract Western investment and technology to Chi-
nese industry. To persuade potential investors of its 
enduring commitment to open up to the outside world, 
Beijing passed a law on joint ventures in 1979 and 
began a massive technology import program that 
centered on purchases of complete plants and equip-
ment from Japan, the United States, and Western 
Europe. By 1980, Beijing had also established four 
Special Economic Zones in South China to entice 
foreign investors by offering favorable tax rates and 
investment terms. Beijing intended for these zones to 
be "windows" where China could study foreign manu-
facturing technology and management, while keeping 
the negative side effects of capitalism out of China 
proper. The zones also had a political objective?to 
demonstrate Chinese tolerance of non-Communist 
economic forms as part of efforts to woo Hong Kong 
and Taiwan by Deng's "one-country, two-systems" 
approach. 
Phase Two: Urban Reform 1984-87 
Building on the success of rural reforms and having 
rebuffed a challenge during late 1983 by party mem-
bers who believed that Western "spiritual pollution" 
threatened China's social fabric, reform leaders in 
late 1984 moved to apply market-oriented policies to 
the urban industrial sector. Zhao Ziyang's work 
report to the National People's Congress in May 1984 
and Hu Yaobang's speech to the Party Plenum in 
October 1984 both marked this phase and stand as 
high water marks for reform optimism. 
Despite this optimism, the period following Hu's 
speech brought reformers unexpected economic diffi-
culties and sobering choices. To begin with, grain 
output fell in 1985 after four years of strong growth, 
initiating a period of lagging production and trigger-
ing debate over agricultural policies that continues.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/08: CIA-RDP11S00229R000301520001-8 
Furthermore, reformers misjudged their ability to 
maintain macroeconomic control once urban reforms 
began. Beginning in late 1984, a surge in wage and 
bonus payments and imports contributed to economic 
overheating in 1985, forcing Beijing to rein in credit, 
slow price reforms, and recentralize control over 
foreign trade in the face of mounting inflationary 
pressure and a precipitous decline in China's trade 
balance. 
Reform policies suffered another blow in early 1985 
when criticism of the Special Economic Zones?
especially Shenzhen?surfaced. Despite massive in-
frastructure buildup at Beijing's expense, the zones 
had failed to attract manufacturing investment, be-
coming centers of real estate and currency speculation 
instead. They were also a breeding ground for inde-
pendent "briefcase" trading companies that engaged 
in profitable?but unproductive?import and export 
transactions. Shenzhen, in particular, became a con-
duit for imports of high-demand consumer goods and 
microcomputers entering China at reduced tariffs; 
independent traders also made money by exporting 
and then reimporting Chinese goods and collecting 
state subsidies on both transactions to cover the 
difference between domestic and international prices. 
A major car import scandal in South China that 
broke in early summer 1985 added fuel to the charges 
of corruption and mismanagement. China had invest-
ed too much political and economic capital in develop-
ing the zones to abandon them, but the developments 
of 1985 temporarily tarnished the reputations of the 
zones and of the local leaders. 
Reforms in this period had their successes. Beijing 
boosted exports of textiles and other manufactured 
goods to make up for lost oil export earnings. The 
booming rural enterprise sector made progress in 
absorbing surplus farm labor. And overall economic 
growth continued at an impressive pace. But perfor-
mance in key areas?particularly China's state-owned 
industrial sector?was disappointing. If anything, ini-
tial urban reforms worsened performance in some 
state factories, raising costs and making managers 
more concerned about worker welfare than about 
production efficiency. Critics also found fault with 
China's massive technology imports after discovering 
that shortages of qualified technical personnel, re-
source and energy constraints, inadequate incentives 
for factory managers, and poor technology choices 
idled much of China's expensive foreign equipment. 
This period was also marked by an increasingly open 
debate over appropriate reform strategy. Deng helped 
maintain the appearance of leadership unanimity by 
carefully positioning himself between those who fa-
vored bolder initiatives and those who favored a 
slower pace and narrower scope for reform. But public 
disturbances, including student demonstrations in late 
1986, reinforced the fears of some leaders that re-
forms were proceeding too quickly and might even 
undermine the authority of the party. 
Party chief Hu Yaobang's fall in January 1987 was 
precipitated by complex political forces, but, in the 
process, reformers lost one of the most vocal and 
powerful supporters of faster political liberalization 
and of greater reliance on consumer-driven economic 
development. Although the orthodox-oriented "anti-
bourgeois liberalization" campaign that followed Hu's 
fall was brought to a close within a few months, high 
inflation and lagging grain output during the year 
narrowed the range of policy options open to China's 
economic leaders in the near term, and thus limited 
the scope of policy debates. 
Phase Three: Stressing Stability 1987-Present 
The current situation in China is a mixed bag for 
reform proponents. "Reform" remains the political 
watchword, Zhao Ziyang?a key reform leader?has 
replaced Hu Yaobang as party chief, other young 
reformers have taken their place on the Politburo, and 
some party officials who voiced strong skepticism 
about the reform program have been soundly re-
buffed. Indeed, it is no longer possible to speak simply 
of "reform leaders;" all Chinese leaders are now 
reformers in the sense that they are economic prag-
matists who favor some degree of expanded scope for 
market forces in China's economy.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/08: CIA-RDP11S00229R000301520001-8 
At the same time, however, strains in the economy 
have led Chinese leaders to postpone some important 
aspects of the reform program?including price re-
forms?and have led leaders to use administrative 
controls to rein in inflation and maintain control over 
imports. One indication of the increased caution that 
marks this period is the lengthening time frame for 
reform?reform leaders and economists now speak of 
decades to achieve basic reform goals. This trend 
toward a longer time horizon may in fact be a more 
realistic assessment of the changes China must go 
through as it moves toward a more market-oriented 
economy. 
Another characteristic of the current period is the loss 
of a clear goal as well as the proper path to be 
followed, in contrast to 10 years ago when simply 
implementing pragmatic policies constituted a reform 
agenda. One assessment of the current state of re-
forms is that China now risks stalling out half way on 
Reverse Blank 
25 
the road to a market economy. Such an assessment 
can be read between the lines when some economists 
point to China's current half-reformed, half-planned 
state, or even in Zhao's statement that a "pause" in 
reforms could turn into a retreat. Other Chinese deny 
that the goal of reform is a market economy, asserting 
instead that it has been to create "socialism with 
Chinese characteristics" under which market forces 
would coexist with state control. Therefore, although 
all Chinese leaders now consider themselves reform-
ers, a consensus over the ultimate shape of a reformed 
China is notably lacking.

Appendix B 
China's Foreign Investment Policies 
In recent years, Western investors have publicly 
voiced their concerns about limited access to the 
Chinese market; difficulties in obtaining the foreign 
exchange needed to remit profits and support their 
operations; rising costs of materials and wages; bu-
reaucratic redtape; and China's inadequate transport, 
communication, and power infrastructure. Many have 
also expressed uneasiness with the paucity of commer-
cial legislation pertaining to important investment 
issues. 
Over the last year and a half, Beijing has published a 
number of national laws fleshing out more general 
guidelines on foreign investment that were promulgat-
ed in October 1986. The new legislation: 
? Affirms the rights of joint ventures to hire and fire 
Chinese workers. 
? Exempts joint ventures from import licenses and 
duties for components used to produce exports. 
? Allows joint ventures with insufficient foreign ex-
change to obtain hard currency by exporting Chi-
nese goods not produced by the joint venture itself 
or by using Chinese currency profits to buy foreign 
exchange from joint ventures with a surplus. 
? Exempts remitted and reinvested profits from in-
come tax, reduces tax rates for export-producing 
enterprises and ventures that employ advanced tech-
nology in production, and cuts in half the tax on 
income earned by foreigners resident in China. 
? Gives joint ventures permission to charge Chinese 
customers foreign exchange for goods produced in 
Sino-foreign joint ventures that would otherwise 
have to be imported. 
Beijing also has permitted cities and provinces to 
experiment with additional provisions designed to 
encourage investment inflows into their localities, and 
Reverse Blank 
27 
most have done so?often vying with other regions to 
attract needed foreign investment. And the March 
1988 National People's Congress approved a new law 
on contractual joint ventures designed to encourage 
foreign partners to engage in nonequity forms of joint 
production activity. Although Beijing passed a law on 
equity joint ventures in 1979 and a law on wholly 
foreign-owned ventures in 1986, the legal status of 
contractual joint ventures has been poorly defined, 
leaving much room for negotiation during the initial 
stages of an agreement?and subsequent differences 
of interpretation. Even without the legislation, howev-
er, foreign firms signed more than 5,000 agreements 
to set up contractual joint ventures in China, and 40 
percent of China's paid-in foreign investment has 
come from contractual joint ventures. 
These changes have provided a legal basis for im-
provements in China's environment for foreign invest-
ment. Considerable uncertainty remains, however, in 
how the regulations will be implemented. For exam-
ple, foreign investors must have their operations desig-
nated "export-oriented" or "technically advanced" in 
order to be eligible for preferential tax and other 
treatment; precisely how Beijing makes these determi-
nations is unknown. There is also a great deal of 
discretion in how Beijing chooses to define "import 
substitutes" that are allowed to charge foreign ex-
change for domestic Chinese sales, as well as the 
percentage of the price that may be collected in hard 
currency. 
Beijing, moreover, continues to determine prices of 
inputs supplied to foreign invested enterprises as well 
as the prices at which joint venture products may be 
sold within China. With the frequent price fluctua-
tions now occurring in China, potential investors often 
have difficulty projecting their ability to earn a profit. 
And, despite the legal basis for joint ventures to hire 
and fire workers, as a practical matter, many continue 
to have difficulty attracting skilled Chinese workers 
to take jobs that are viewed as less secure than work 
in state-sector Chinese enterprises.

output under state procurement. 
Chinese peasants have more latitude to 
choose what to grow or to start rural 
industries. 
Soviet plan still predominates; Chinese 
have considerably reduced central 
planning. 
Soviet workers elect all managers, min-
