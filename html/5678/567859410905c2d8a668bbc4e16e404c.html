 CHINA-US:          Media Handling of the President's Visit
 Beijing's public treatment of the President's visit has been
 designed to underscore its desire for stronger bilateral ties while
 emphasizing that it remains as independent as before.
 public handling of differences over Taiwan and international issues
 has followed established lines and has been moderate in tone.
 Although the Chinese media excised some of the President's remarks
 about the USSR, Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders implicitly
 indicated support for US efforts to check Soviet expansionism by
 stressing the importance for regional and global stability of good
 relations between the US and China. The news agency Xinhua,
 moreover, highlighted the Defense Minister's talks with US military
 officials in the President's party.
 Soviet media, on the other hand, have been critical of the US but
 more restrained in complaining that China has not dissociated itself
 completely from the President's "anti-Soviet course." Officials in
 Moscow have been more critical of China in private, seeking to
 underscore the risks to the US of closer ties with Beijing.
 Comment: Beijing appears prepared-at least for now-to manage
 its media coverage of bilateral irritants carefully, in order to promote
 a more stable relationship with the US, for strategic and economic
 reasons. China will continue to emphasize its independence in foreign
 affairs, largely to appeal to nationalistic sentiment at home and to
 facilitate dealing with the Soviet threat and with suspicious Third
 World friends, like North Korea. The Soviets presumably also are
 discouraging closer Sino-US ties in any private contacts they may

 SPAIN:            .. Implications of.IRegional Election
 A regional party-the center-right Convergence and Union-
 decisively won the regional election in Catalonia on Sunday, but
 prime Minister Gonzalez's Socialist party also increased its
 share of the vote.
 Convergence and. Union has raised its representation from 43 to 72
 seats and has won an absolute majority in the 135-member regional
 assembly. The Socialists also increased their share, from 33 to 41
 seats. The chief national opposition party, the conservative Popular
 Alliance, won only 11 seats in the assembly. The Communists in
 Catalonia dropped from 25 to six seats, and other regionalist parties
 declined from 16 to five seats.
 Comment: The vote in Catalonia was primarily an endorsement for
 the Convergence and Union's management of regional affairs for the
 past four years, but it also has national implications. The party's
 strong showing will add impetus to the effort of Miguel Roca-the
 leader of its parliamentary delegation in Madrid-to forge a new
 federation of centrist and regional parties. The Popular Alliance's
 distant third-place finish will renew the public's doubts about party
 leader Manuel Fraga's ability to attract enough centrist support to run
 effectively against the Socialists in the next national election.
 The failure of the Communists leaves Prime Minister Gonzalez secure
 from any threat from the left and free to continue moderate policies
 that appeal to centrist voters. The Communists' decline in
 Catalonia-long a stronghold for them-stemmed largely from widely
 publicized infighting over personalities and policies as well as from
 the emergence of the new pro-Soviet party.

 Two Secyat
 Cairo is slowly moving toward normalized relations with Moscow
 but is not yet ready to exchange ambassadors.
 Egyptian Foreign Minister All has been misquoted in the press twice,
 most recently last weekend, as announcing that Cairo and Moscow
 have agreed to exchange ambassadors. In a published interview, Ali
 merely said that Egypt's good relations with the US do not prevent it
 from restoring full relations with the USSR.
 Normalized relations were not the principal topic during the visit to
 Cairo last month of Vladimir Polyakov, chief of the Near East
 Department in the Soviet Foreign Ministry and the last Soviet
 Ambassador to Egypt.
 Comment: President Mubarak and other Egyptian officials have said
 repeatedly that Egypt has to have good relations with both
 superpowers and that the USSR has to be involved in the Middle East
 peace process. Cairo also believes that Moscow shares its concern
 about ending the Iran-Iraq war.
 Mubarak probably also believes that public comment about future
 Egyptian-Soviet relations will help the government party in the coming
 parliamentary elections. Egypt's opposition parties advocate more
 balanced relations with the East and the West.

 YUGOSLAVIA:          Cabinet Changes
 Major changes in the Cabinet-including changes among the top
 economic advisers-reflect complex political and ethnically
 based maneuvering, not policy changes.
 The elevation of Foreign Minister Mojsov and Interior Minister Dolanc
 to the collective federal presidency, effective on 15 May, is the
 occasion for two changes. Raif Dizdarevic, a leading Bosnian Muslim
 with limited diplomatic background, will be the new foreign minister.
 The US Embassy reports that he believes that two of his predecessors
 at the Ministry who are now entering the federal presidency may
 interfere in his portfolio.
 the new Interior Minister, Dobrislav         . 25X1
 Culafic, got his job with the support of his predecessor. Culafic will
 preside over the Ministry that is enforcing a major crackdown on
 dissidents and intellectuals. Serb leaders vetoed another candidate,
 a Serb from Vojvodina Province, because his constituency stresses
 its autonomy from the Republic of Serbia.                             25X1
 Vice Premier Dragan and member-without-portfolio Janko Smole, the
 architects of Yugoslavia's stabilization strategy and the principal
 negotiators with the IMF, are leaving for personal reasons. The US
 Embassy reports that Dragan is exhausted following major surgery.
 Another economist, Croat No Margan, is leaving, the Cabinet, in order
 to assume an important position with UNESCO.
 Comment: No major policy shifts are likely. The large number of
 former foreign ministers in top executive posts probably ensures
 continuity in Yugoslav foreign policy. Belgrade's dealings with
 Western creditors may temporarily suffer from the loss of its most
 experienced financial negotiators. but the IMF package for 1984 has
 been completed.
 Culafic probably will have trouble asserting control over Interior in the
 shadow of Dolanc. The latter reportedly wants to head the powerful
 Federal Council for the Defense of the Constitutional Order, which
 oversees internal security policy.

 DENMARK: Security Debate
 In a major security debate in Parliament tomorrow, the opposition
 Social Democrats probably will present a resolution banning
 deployment of nuclear weapons in Denmark under any
 circumstances. It also will call for no-first-use, curtailment of INF
 deployment, and a Nordic nuclear-weapons-free zone.
 Comment: There is a good chance the Social Democrats can gain a
 majority for such a resolution. Excluding nuclear weapons even in
 wartime would raise serious questions about the Danish role in NATO
 and could also have repercussions on the security debate in Norway
 and the Netherlands. The Social Democrats reportedly are not
 seeking the government's ouster at this time, and they presumably
 will push for wording that will not require the government to adopt the
 resolution as policy or resign.
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Economic Pressures Persist
 The government has promised to back a wage bill now before
 congress, enact legislation on job security for union organizers, and
 expand the social security system. The country's five labor
 confederations have been demand in                     as well
 as on price controls. Meanwhile,                       police
 occupied several labor headquar ers as wee , and, accor ing to the
 US Embassy, authorities are taking extra security precautions for
 Labor Day demonstrations planned today.
 Comment: Tensions continue high as price increases on basic
 commodities and planned hikes on petroleum products threaten to
 push inflation to more than 40 percent this year-four times higher
 than last year. Strict budgetary controls demanded by the IMF will
 limit wage increases and probably will require new taxes.
 Nevertheless, President Jorge Blanco appears determined to carry
 out the austerity program while maintaining public order by granting
 limited concessions and by continuing tight security. The violence
 associated with suppressing the riots last week has restored order
 but probably has inflicted lasting damage on Jorge Blanco's political

 NORTH KOREA-USSR-CHINA: Summit Visits
 North Korean President Kim II-song hopes to use separate summit
 meetings with Chinese and Soviet leaders this month to increase his
 support from them and to discourage the growing level of contacts
 between Seoul and the Communist superpowers, especially China.
 Chinese party leader Hu Yaobang will visit P' on  an this week. and
 Kim will travel to Moscow later this month
 Comment: Hu Yaobang will use his visit to reassure Kim that Beijing
 did not compromise North Korean interests in talks with President
 Reagan. In Moscow, where Kim has not visited in an official capacity
 since 1961, he will probably seek greater material support, including
 project aid and advanced weapons systems, and Soviet backing for
 his plans to have his son. succeed him. Moscow views Kim's visit as an
 opportunity to signal that Soviet interests cannot be ignored in any.
 Korean settlement. The visit also will give Moscow a chance to take
 advantage of, and possibly add to, strains in Chinese-North Korean
 relations caused by Beijing's contacts                 as closer
 Chinese ties with the US and Japan.

 CHAD-LIBYA: Rebel Discontent With Tripoli
 the Libyans may be restricting
 the movement of the Vice President of Chad's rebel government-in-
 exile after he tried to arrange a meeting with a representative of
 President Habre's regime last month. Chadian Government officials
 claim that some 50 dissidents fled the Libyan stronghold at Fada last
 week and defected to the Habre regime. In addition, a serious dispute
 over military strategy arose last month between Chadian rebel troops
 and Libyan forces deployed near the 16th parallel
 Comment: Rebel disgruntlement almost certainly stems from Tripoli's
 heavyhanded control in the north and the dissidents' realization that
 they have lost their autonomy. Libya will be able to contain outbreaks
 of rebel discontent, but problems are likely to fester as long as the
 military stalemate continues. Increasing rebel unhappiness with the
 Libyans is likely to enhance Habre's image as a legitimate leader for
 Chadians favoring national independence.

 INTERNATIONAL:      Suppression of Illegal Narcotics
 Governments of some of the principal drug-exporting countries
 in Asia and Latin America are having at least limited success in
 their efforts, backed by the US, to combat narcotics activities.
 Results range from good to poor, and the gains are mainly short
 term. There has been little disruption of illicit crop production,
 which is. expected to rise this year in most areas. Control
 programs may gradually gain ground, but limited resources,
 domestic pressures, and widespread corruption continue to
 prevent more substantial progress toward suppression of the
 international drug trade.
 The US Drug Enforcement Administration and the National Institute
 on Drug Abuse say that more than 40 million people in the US are
 expected to spend up to $80 billion this year to consume some 4 tons
 of heroin, as much as 61 tons of cocaine, and about 14,000 tons of
 marijuana. Nearly all of these drugs come from crops grown in foreign
 countries, where illegal drug activities are an important part of the
 local economy
 Latin America produces most of the marijuana, all of the cocaine, and
 about a quarter of the heroin imported to the US, according to DEA
 estimates. Control efforts are making little headway, and kev
 segments of the drug industry remain largely unrestricted
 Colombia's cocaine and marijuana traffickers dominate the US
 market. Last year Colombia produced between 13,000 and 16,000
 tons of marijuana, and the country's cultivation of coca has increased
 considerably-the latter crop is still grown primarily in Bolivia and
 The Colombian Government, like others in Latin America, assigns a
 low priority to narcotics control. Its recent decision to undertake a
 campaign to test herbicide spray against selected coca and marijuana
 fields and its recent seizure of a large cocaine processing and
 trafficking complex indicate at least some willingness to begin to
 crack down on producers and traffickers. At the same time, strong
 nationalist sentiment, domestic political concerns, lack of financial
 resources, and the economic influence of the powerful illicit drug
 industry remain major obstacles to tighter control of narcotics
 activities in Colombia.

 Mexico's once exemplary opium eradication program-which made
 substantial inroads into production between 1      d 1982-has
 been weakened                                      Opium output       25X6,
 increased in 1983, and both the opium harvest and heroin shipments
 are expected to rise again this year. Although Mexican marijuana
 probably still accounts for only a small percentage of US
 consumption, exports are likely to increase in 1984.                  25X1
 The Jamaican Government's recent crackdown on marijuana
 smuggling has stalled, because of the traffickers' political influence,
 and because the Army is not strong enough to conduct sustained
 large-scale interdiction operations. Marijuana shipments from
 Jamaica-the second-largest supplier to the US after Colombia,
 according to DEA-have nearly doubled since 1981 and are likely
 to exceed 2,000 tons this year.
 Drug traffickers in some Latin American countries, meanwhile, are
 diversifying their operations or are beginning to play a major role in
 the international market for the first time. Peruvian coca growers are
 becoming directly involved in refining and smuggling cocaine. Belize
 has greatly increased its marijuana production in recent years, and it
 could overtake Jamaica this year as the second-largest supplier to the
 us.
 Southwest Asia's "Golden Crescent" -Pakistan, Afghanistan, and
 Iran-has long been the largest opium producing and consuming
 region in the world. According to the DEA, it currently accounts for
 about half the heroin reaching the US.
 Steady reductions until this year in opium production in the region
 were largely the result of the drop in Pakistan from about 700 tons in    25X1
 1979 to 45 to 60 tons in 1983. The Pakistanis attribute their continued
 success in curbing production to crop substitution, although
 unfavorable weather and soft market prices apparently have played
 a more important role. Pakistan has an organized antinarcotics
 program, but it is reluctant to risk a politically costly showdown with
 traffickers and refiners in the Pakistani-Afghan border area, where

 Increased opium output during the past two years in Afghanistan has
 enabled traffickers to offset Pakistan's reductions and evidently will
 result in a net increase this year in regional production. The regime. in
 Kabul shows little interest in allocating scarce resources to narcotics
 control, even though much of its opium production may be helping to
 support farmers who are active in the insurgency.
 Iran apparently is a net importer of opium. It is concerned chiefly with
 finding ways to cope with its large addict population and discounts
 its role as a refining and transshipment point for some heroin
 consignments going to Turkish traffickers.
 Southwest Asian heroin is expected to remain plentiful and could
 become even more abundant if competition among traffickers
 increases to take advantage of continued surplus production. The
 existing glut of Golden Crescent heroin on the European market
 might lead to larger shipments to the US.
 Narcotics production activities in the "Golden Triangle," where
 Burma, Thailand, and Laos meet, are concentrated primarily along
 the Thai-Burmese border. Southeast Asia currently produces about
 a quarter of the heroin reaching the US, according to DEA.
 Thailand's increased use of military force during the past two years
 against the groups that control the region's main opium-growing
 areas have had some temporary impact on refining and smuggling
 operations in the border area. The smugglers, however, are moving
 base camps and refineries deeper inside Burma, and some of the
 groups have agreed to work together to protect their access to
 opium, shipments of supplies and chemicals, and trafficking routes.

 Thailand's limited crop-substitution program continues to be poorly
 enforced, and Bangkok has been slow to promote wider participation
 among farmers, who sometimes could make more money by
 switching to other crops. The country's limited attempts at opium
 crop eradication have not had much impact either, and se     and
 political concerns                                   curithave      25X6

 Bangkok resumed some eradication efforts near the border with
 Burma in late February. This move, however, came too late in the
 growing season to have much effect. It probably was only a short-
 term effort at least partly aimed at easing US criticism during Prime
 Minister Prem's visit to Washington last month.
 Burma is estimated to grow more than 80 percent of the opium
 produced in Southeast Asia, and its problem-plagued antinarcotics
 programs are part of its broader counterinsurgency effort. Top
 eradication projects have had little impact and increasingly have been
 hindered by guerrilla threats of reprisals. Plans by Burma to expand
 control efforts have been stalled by lack of funds and by high-level
 government and military corruption.
 The opium harvest in the region this year is expected to be larger than
 the 600 tons produced last year, perhaps as much as 700 tons,
 according to preliminary DEA projections based on US Embassy
 reporting                       The impending bumper crop
 and the likelihood that many traffickers will adapt quickly to recent
 disruptions almost certainly will lead to continued increases in heroin
 shipments to the US from the Golden Triangle.
 Although production estimates for specific countries are often based
 on sketchy information and are not precise, intelligence
 indicates that wordwide production of illicit drug crops will
 expand in 1984. The result-as projected by DEA-will be an
 increase in the quantity of drugs available for export to the US this
 year. Large, long-term cuts in drug crop harvests are unlikely to be
 achieved in most of the key producing countries in the foreseeable
 future. Crop size will continue to be determined mainly by weather
 Even if major progress were achieved in one region, the net
 availability of illicit drugs to the US would be unlikely to decline. There
 is no evidence of organized coordination of narcotics activities in the
 three key regions, but producers and traffickers worldwide have been
 quick to exploit oooortunities afforded by local shortages and
 disruptions.
