 SOVIET AND CHINESE MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS
 I
 I intend to be
 in toda

 ar
 of
 y
 .
 g
 y
 what
 m
 we know, and what we conclude, about the Soviet
 ICBM force, the Soviet anti-ballistic missile
 capability, and Chinese Communist advanced
 weapons.
 II. This information is derived from all of the
 intelligence collection techniques available
 to the U. S. Government.   Many of these methods
 are highly sensitive, and I know that you will
 take this fact into consideration.
 4II. Our information base this year is better than
 it has ever been.  Nevertheless, we still have
 certain intelligence questions that we have been
 unable to answer satisfactorily.   The principal
 one of these has to do with a sharp difference
 of opinion in the intelligence community on the
 Soviet anti-missile capability, which I will
 discuss in a few minutes.

 IV.   Let me get right down to the conclusions of our
 latest National Intelligence Estimates:
 V.   New Soviet ICBMs are coming into operational
 status at a rapid pace.
 L1 1A. By our latest count,  'there are now 381 ICBMs
 ready to fire, and another 400 under con-
 struction.
 1.       We estimate that the operational count
 will reach a range of 670 to 765 in
 B.      The present deployment will do more than in-
 crease the number of ICBMs.   It will increase
 the ability of the Soviet ICBM force to sur-
 vive a U.S. strike.
 1.       The earlier deployment put the majority
 of the ICBMs on soft pads.   Many of them
 were clustered so that one good hit could
 knock out two or three of them.
 2.       We estimate that by 1968 four out of five
 missiles will be sheltered in silos.  The
 new missiles are far enough apart to en-
 sure that each one would have to be knocked
 out separately.

 /C.    What this does is to make the Soviets much
 more confident of their capability for what
 the military strategists call "assured de-
 struction"--the ability to destroy a signifi-
 cant proportion of our population and resources
 /           even if the United States should strike first.
 VI.       To have a clear understanding of the controversy
 over the Soviet anti-ballistic missile,  I would
 like to point out that it involves two separate
 missile systems.
 V AI.   First, around Moscow the Soviets are indeed
 deploying an array of missiles and radars
 //      conclusively demonstrated to be an ABM system.
 /B.     Part of the system should be ready to go
 this year.                               Cv uj

 1/ C.   When it is finished, Moscow will bb protected
 by about 100 solid-fuel missiles that can
 reach out several hundred miles and explode
 a .nuclear warhead above the atmosphere.
 -/1.    We think the system would have a good
 capability against a limited number of
 existing missiles,  but it doesn't have
 what it takes to cope with a major attack,
 or with the penetration aids that incoming
 missiles will have in the future.

 4,'JS.      This system I have just described is unique
 to Moscow.   You only have to think for a
 minute about what Moscow has meant in Russian
 history to realize that the Soviets will de-
 fend Moscow with any system that might help,
 regardless of cost, effectiveness, or feasi-
 bility.
 Vill.      We have seen no indication that this
 system is going to show up anywhere else
 in the Soviet Union.
 /V11.    Now let's leave Moscow to look at another defen-
 sive missile deployment.   This one, so far,  has
 showed up in 26 locations, which would indicate
 that the Soviets think pretty well of it.   We
 call this one the Tallinn system after the city
 in Esthonia where we first detected one of these
 installations.   The Tallinn system is the object
 of the controversy I have mentioned,  because so
 far there just isn't enough hard evidence to be
 positive of its purpose.
 A.   CIA believes that this system is more likel
 ?                                                              Y
 to be a defense against high-flying,  high-
 speed aircraft and other aerodynamic vehicles.
 This is the conclusion of the current estimate.

 d B.    The other view is that the weapon is basically
 an anti-ballistic missile, with a secondary
 mission against aerodynamic vehicles.   This
 is the view of DIA,  the Army, and the Air
 Force.
 /C.     Both views rely on inferences drawn from de-
 ployment patterns,
 Soviet requirements,  and other similar
 factors.
 1.   Neither side can line up enough evidence
 to disprove the other view.
 2.   The argument cannot be resolved until we
 get more information.
 VIII.  There used to be considerable discussion of a
 Leningrad system, which only helps to confuse
 he issue.
 VA.        In 1960 the Soviets began building three
 sizable missile complexes around Leningrad.
 1.   We suspected at first that this might
 /    be a prototype ABM system.
 2.   If so, it was abortive; the Soviets sus-
 pended work on the sites about 1962.
 3.   After the Tallinn facility was started
 in 1964,  the Leningrad installations

 /IX.   The Chinese Communists, as you know, have been
 testing nuclear devices, and ballistic missiles
 to deliver them.
 VIA.    As far as we can judge,  the Chinese should
 be able to deploy a few nuclear medium-range
 missiles this year.
 B.    We also estimate that if they are engaged
 in an attempt to develop an intercontinental
 weapon,  they could deploy their first crude
 ICBMs in the early 1970s.
 ~I.  We believe that they have embarked on
 an ICBM program.   We have seen no sign
 of any of the missile components,  but
 we have photographed a big new complex
 at their missile test range which has
 the dimensions of an ICBM launch pad.
 2.      Also,  this is one of those cases where
 logic carries almost as much weight as
 evidence.   If the Chinese feel that they
 were modified to accommodate the new lay-
 out.                                              As a result, the Leningrad system
 no longer exists.

 can develop a weapon system which could
 hit the United States,  they are not likely
 to turn down such a project without a try.

 on the missile test activity at the remote
 Chinese test range.

 DCI BRIEFING FOR
 RUSSELL SUBCOMMITTEE
 THE CHINESE COMMUNIST CULTURAL REVOLUTION
 The Chinese today are pre-occupied with the
 domestic purge which they call the "cultural
 revolution."
 Trying to determine who is doing what to
 whom right now is a lot like trying to
 pick a winner when several cats are fight-
 ing under a rug,  but this is our current
 reading:
 cry.  This is a struggle for power.
 LAY.   The prime mover at present is Defense
 ,,~~ Minister Lin Piao.   (Lin Byaw)
 L,1"2. 2. He has been driving to unseat any po-
 tential rivals ever since he was pro-
 claimed Mao's heir-apparent at the
 start of the present disturbance last
 summer.
 His immediate targets are the two men
 who have been at the top of the party
 machinery, Chief of State Liu Shao-chi

 (Lyew Shao-chee), and the general secre-
 tary, Teng Hsiao-ping.   (Dung Shaw-ping)
 For the past couple of months, Lin's drive
 appeared to be stalled.  There was some
 reason to believe that a group headed by
 Premier Chou En-lai (Joe En-lye) does not
 want to see the party machinery completely
 shattered.
 L1'1. The role of Mao Tse-tung  (Mao Dzeh-dung)
 during this period was obscure.   It
 appeared that he was giving general sup-
 port to Lin Piao (Lin Byaw), but was
 reluctant to condone extreme action
 against men as close to him as Liu (Lyew)
 and Teng  (Tung).
 t"D.   Early in January, the leadership struggle
 apparently entered a more critical phase.
 ~7.    Newspapers and Red Guard organizations
 have published authoritative reports of
 a bitter personal attack by Mao himself
 on Liu and Teng.
 With Mao's personal prestige engaged,
 the status of Liu and Teng will have to
 be settled soon. Et~-rally is----.schedule.d

 L'II.  This would be only a first step for Lin Piao.
 (Lin Byaw)  His goal all along has been to ac-
 coIplish a major reorganization of the party.
 B.  Many of the party leaders owe their careers
 to Liu and Teng, who have dominated the
 paltty machinery for more than a decade.
 1.     If Liu and Teng go down in disgrace,
 Lin will be able to use their past
 associations to demote or dismiss large
 numbers of party officials in key posi-
 tions.

 II.    I should note that my best China-watchers at
 CIA complain bitterly these days when they are
 asked to come up with a neat, short summary of
 the present situation.   They insist they have
 %got to have room to put in the loop-holes.
 VA.   The danger as they see it lies in the fact
 that there are apparently deep splits in the

 /l.    The cultural revolution is even turning
 on some of its own leaders.
 2.    There is Tao Chu (Tao Joo), for instance,
 who jumped up to fourth place in the
 hierarchy last August, behind Mao, Lin,
 and Chou En-lai.  Tao is now head of
 the party propaganda department,  and has
 been one of the directors of the cultural
 revolution from the outset.
 3.   Now Tao Chu is under attack.
 B.   There are at least two rival Red Guard head-
 quarters in Peking.

 to smash the rival headquarters, ac-
 cusing its leaders of trying to shield
 party leaders from attack.

 ~B.  There are two points, however, which we can
 make,
 1.   First, as long as China's leaders are
 pre-occupied with this internal wrangling,
 they will find it difficult to reach
 agreement on any new policy lines.   So
 we do not expect any radical departures
 from existing policies.
 Second, whoever wins, we can see no reason
 for suspecting that there will be any
 dilution of Peking's implacable hostility
 to the United States.  We have n
 in their rivalries      a might as well
 enjoy  h     ow while it lasts

 NORTH VIETNAMESE POSITIONS ON NEGOTIATIONS
 N I.     Holiday truce periods, diplomatic soundings, and
 international visits have recently produced
 numerous statements on the attitude of the
 North Vietnamese government toward negotiations.
 Because of its importance,  I would like to go
 over this subject with you in some detail,  at
 the ris   of being repetitious.   Indeed repetition
 is the Est of the matter,  for our analysts
 reach their conclusions on the North Vietnamese
 attitude through the laborious comma-by-comma
 comparison of literally thousands of Hanoi's
 pronouncements.   We have studied every one of
 them we could lay our hands on, public or private,
 made directly or through third,  fourth or fifth
 parties, over the last several years.
 A. We know that along with Western and neutral
 efforts, there has been a sustained try by
 Hanoi's Soviet and East European friends for
 two years to impress on the North Vietnamese

 the advantages of taking a flexible attitude
 on the question of negotiations.
 Hanoi's leaders on the one hand have stated
 that they feel the war will ultimately end
 in negotiations.
 Vl.   On the other hand,  it is clear that they
 neither wish,  nor feel compelled at
 present, to make any move which might
 be interpreted as a sign of weakness on
 their part.
 V /C" . Given these two elements of their thinking,
 it is not surprising that there are or appear
 to be significant differences among the various
 statements purporting to define their attitude
 toward negotiations.
 TI.   We have found it helpful to compare these state-
 ments with a couple of authoritative yardsticks:
 COOa policy statemen  by Premier Pham Van Dong in
 (
 April,  1965, antt                                   letter from President Ho Chi
 Minh to various world leaders a year ago, in
 January 1966.
 A.   Pham Van Dong stated that if the U.S. accepts
 Hanoi's four points as "the basis" for a
 political settlement it will be possible

 Approved For Release 200                 82R00025R000700190002-7
 "to consider" the convening of a Geneva-
 type conference.
 V B.    Ho Chi Minh in January 1966 stated that for
 a peaceful settlement to be achieved,  the
 U.S. must also "prove y actual deeds" that
 it accepts the four points.   He went on to
 demand that the U.S. must "end unconditionally
 and for good," all bombing raids and "other
 war acts" against North Vietnam.   He also
 stated that "if the U.S. really_._wants peace,__,
 it must recognize the National Front for--
 the Liberation of South Vietnam as the sole,
 genuine representative of the South Viet-
 namese people, and engage in negotiations
 with it."
 II.     Recent initiatives that have occasioned most of
 the current statements relating to Hanoi's
 attitude toward negotiations have been those of
 Ambassador Goldberg and U Thant, and the visit
 to Hanoi by Harrison Salisbury of the New York
 Times.
 /A.   In regard to U Thant's efforts,  the North
 Vietnamese representative in Paris, Mai
 Van Bo, speaking at a press luncheon on

 1.   Bo's statement was in keeping with Hanoi's
 distrust of the UN and its officers,  but
 one specific distinction should be made:
 U Thant personally is treated with greater
 restraint, probably because he has been
 openly critical of the U.S. position on
 Vietnam.
 January 5, said in reply to a question that
 North Vietnam rejects all efforts by the UN
 to deal with the Vietnam problem,  because
 Vietnam falls under the 1954 Geneva Agree-
 ments.
 /2. Thant in turn continues to insist that
 Hanoi will respond favorably to his
 initiative if the U.S. stops bombing
 the north,  but he has not offered any
 /~         firm evidence on this point.
 VB.       At the January 5
 meeting,  Bo referred to
 Ambassador Goldberg's letter to U Thant
 a         "the same old song."
 V I/1'.
 Adding weight to BoPs comment is a
 that another member
 of the North Vietnamese delegation in
 Paris had previously said Bo would not

 comment on the subject until he received
 instructions from Hanoi.
 /2.  The UAR Foreign Ministry told our Cairo
 Embassy on December 24 that the North
 Vietnamese Ambassador there had dismissed
 Ambassador Goldberg's letter as "strictly
 a propaganda ploy."
 C.    Bo also said that if the U.S. were to stop
 bombing finally and unconditionally, and
 thereafter propose to establish contact with
 the government of North Vietnam, he--Mai Van
 Bo--thought that such a proposal would "be
 1.   This is an unusual
 statement for a North
 Vietnamese spokesman.
 2.   It was presented as a personal opinion,
 but it has been interpreted as an authorita-
 tive indication that Hanoi would indeed
 respond to a cessation of air raids.

 cate that even if Hanoi agreed to "con-
 tacts," basic demands for a settlement
 would remain unchanged.
 e    mined and studied."

 V ID.     Bo,  in fact, used virtually the same terms
 to describe Hanoi's requirements as the Ho
 letter last January.
 I1I.     Bo's personal opinion that "contacts" might be
 considered is the only recent intimation that
 Hanoi would offer any quid pro quo for a bombing
 cessation.
 The Soviets and East Europeans have been
 questioned closely on this point by U.S.
 nd other Western diplomats.
 .   We have direct reports of conversations
 in which Brezhnev, Gromyko, and Foreign
 Minister Rapacki of Poland replied that
 /they could not say what Hanoi's reaction
 would be to a cessation.
 2.   They insisted,  on the other hand,  that
 there would certainly be no response from
 Hanoi as long as the bombings continued.

 stop "escalating" the war and make an uncondi-
 tional and suitable declaration of willingness
 to recognize the National Liberation Front
 as one of the main parties to a settlement.
 Another recent intimation of possible flexibility
 on Hanoi's-part was Harrison Salisbury's account
 of his interview with Pham Van Dong carried in
 the New York Times of January 4.
 A.      We will probably have to wait until Salisbury
 is back in the United States to learn in de-
 'tail what he was told.
 Hanoi seems determined to counter--at least
 publicly--the impression that Pham Van Dong
 indicated a more flexibile approach in the
 Salisbury interview.   Hanoi radio on January 6
 issued a statement characterizing Western
 press speculation about the interview as
 Z          "tendentious."
 CPham Van Dong's statement to Salisbury that
 the four points are to be considered not as
 conditions for peace talks but as constituting
 the basis for a settlement and as "valid

 conclusions for discussion" has been cited
 as evidence of a concession on Hanoi's part.
 In fact, however,  this has long been Hanoi's
 position.   Mai Van Bo stated in May 1965 that
 the four points were "working principles,"
 not preconditions.
 The confusion lies in part in the fact that
 other,  tougher demands, such as Ho Chi Minh's
 January 1966 letter, refer to conditions for
 a settlement, not for negotiations.
 /
 VF.     The North Vietnamese often fuzz this point,
 however.   For example Mai Van Bo on January
 5--after calling on the U.S. to recognize
 the four points and to end the bombing uncondi-
 tionally--stated that "only in this way can
 we reach a position favorable for a peaceful
 settlement."
 1.    So far, there has been no specific defini-
 tion of what is meant by "recognizing"
 or "accepting" the four points.   Such
 statements from time to time have stated
 that these are not preconditions, because
 the United States is not required to
 implement the four points prior to negotia-
 tions.

 2.       The formulations have never precluded
 the interpretation, however,  that the
 United States would have to commit itself
 to making the four points part of a settle-
 ment before any negotiations could begin.
 li' short, the recent statements have provided
 room for speculation and openings for exploration,
 but they have provided no good evidence that
 Hanoi has altered its basic demands for settlement
 of the war, and no assurance that a cessation of
 the bombing of North Vietnam will elicit any
 reciprocal concession from North Vietnam, such
 as an agreement to enter talks with the United
 States.

 HANOI'S "FOUR POINTS"
 Premier Pham Van Done to
 DRV National Assembly, 12 April 1965:
 "1)   Recognition of the basic national rights of the
 Vietnamese people--peace, independence, sovereignty,
 unity and territorial integrity.   In accordance with the
 Geneva agreements, the U.S.Government must withdraw from
 South Vietnam U.S.troops, military personnel, and wT eapons
 of all kinds, dismantle all U.S. military bases there,
 and cancel its military alliance with South Vietnam.   It
 must end its policy of intervention and aggression in
 South Vietnam.   In accordance with the Geneva Agreements,
 the U.S. Government must stop its acts.bf war against
 North Vietnam and completeTy cease all encroachments on
 the territory and sovereignty of the Democratic Republic
 of Vietnam(DRV).
 "2)   Pending the peaceful reunification of Vietnam,
 while Vietnam is still temporaari y divided into two
 zones the military provisions of the 1954 Geneva Agree-
 ments on Vietnam must be strictly respected,     a two
 zones must refrain from entering into any military al-
 liance with foreign countries and there must be no foreign
 military bases, troops, or military personnel in t'heeiir
 respective territories.
 "3)   The internal affairs of South Vietnam must be
 settled by the South Vietnamese people themselves in
 accordance with the program of the NFLSV (National Tront
 For the Liberation o  South Vietnam) without any foreign
 interference.
 "4)   The  eace#ul reunification of Vietnam is to be
 settled by tKe Vietnamese people in both zones, wit out
 any toreign inter .erence.
 ".....The DRV Government declares that any approach
 contrary to the aforementioned is inappropriate; any
 approach tending to secure United Nations intervention
 in the Vietnam system is also inapprop~rriate.   ..uc  ap-
 proaches are basically at variance with the1954 Geneva
 agreements on Vietnam."

 LIBERATION FRONT'S "FIVE POINTS"
 From a declaration by the National
 Front for the Liberation of South
 Vietnam, 22 March 1965:
 "'1.   The United States has disregarded the
 Geneva agreements.
 "2.   The NFLSV asserts that the South Viet-
 namese people will never drop their weapons as long
 as they have not achieved independence, democracy,
 and peace.     All negotiations would be useless, as
 long as U.S. troops and material have not been with-
 Uiawn                            from South  ietnam.
 "3.   Vietnam is one....The South Vietnamese
 acclaim the    ig ting spirit of their neighbors, Laos
 and Cambodia.
 "4.   The South Vietnamese people and their
 representatives, the NFLSV, have the full right to
 receive and warmly ac claim t Fe dust assistance of
 world peoples, especially when the U.S. imperialists
 are introducing troops to expand the war in South
 Vietnam and throughout Indochina.
 "5.   The South Vietnamese have scored brilliant
 victories and will continue the struggle against the
 U.S. _aggressors."
 NB:      These are difficult to summarize as
 demands for a settlement, and were prob-
 ably not designed as such originally.
 They passed virtually unnoticed in a
 lengthy NFLSV manifesto until a subse-
 quent reference in Hanoi to the "Five
 Points" as the basis for a Vietnamese
 settlement, after which they were
 extracted from the early statement and
 given the status of a program.

 SITUATION IN VIETNAM
 The Main Force War:
 1.    Combat activity in 1966 generally demon-
 strated--and, we believe, convinced the enemy--that
 large Communist units can not take the initiative
 in the face of superior Allied firepower, mobility,
 and improved intelligence.
 2.    In the northern part of South Vietnam,
 Communist main force units were repeatedly thrown off
 balance or mauled by US and Allied spoiling opera-
 tions;  in the delta,  they were essentially contained
 by South Vietnamese troops.   Viet Cong fatalities
 rose 40 percent last year over 1965, substantial sup-
 plies were captured or destroyed,  and large-scale
 enemy attacks dropped off sharply in the second half
 of 1966.
 3.    Communist main force strength is nevertheless
 greater now than a year ago  (by some 23,000 men,  largely
 through infiltration);  their main force units are still
 in the field,  and will probably try to keep Allied
 forces tied down in widely scattered areas.   The enemy
 will still attack in force when opportunities arise.

 Guerrilla Warfare and Harassment:
 1.   There is evidence,  both in Communist propa-
 ganda statements and in the pattern of their more
 successful recent actions,     that the Viet Coftg will
 place increased emphasis on guerrilla warfare this
 year.
 2.   Small-scale raids, sabotage, terrorism,
 and political subversion have never ceased.  Communist
 strategists now appear to believe intensified guer-
 rilla operations offer the best means of countering
 the impact of the US military build-up,  and of prevail-
 ing in a prolonged war.
 3.    CIA believes that enemy assets for waging
 guerrilla warfare are somewhat more numerous than the
 officially accepted 110,000 armed irregulars and
 40,000 odd "armed political cadres," but quality has
 probably suffered from the priority given in recent
 years to rapid expansion of the main force.
 4.    The Communist political and guerrilla in-
 frastructure remains deeply entrenched in much of the
 countryside, and may be reinforced by increased di-
 version of regulars to guerrillas-type operations.

 Pacification:
 1.    The effort to root out the Viet Cong from
 the countryside and to expand the Saigon government's
 writ showed little concrete progress over the past
 year despite scattered gains.
 2.    This year the government  (starting with
 some 56.7 percent of the population under its control
 and some 25,500 Revolutionary Development cadres) has
 trimmed its goals in the hope of making surer,  if
 slower, progress; however,  the program is still
 plagued with weaknesses, including official and popu-
 lar apathy at the local level.
 3.    The South Vietnamese army will be assigned
 to provide a security screen for pacification ac-
 tivities--perhaps the most important factor at present
 to the program's success; the army's poor leadership
 and morale and need for intensive retraining, how-
 ever, suggest that results will be spotty and slow.

 Political Situation:
 1.    The outlook for continued political sta-
 bility in South Vietnam is considerably brighter now
 than a year or six months ago,      but fundamental prob-
 lems of divisiveness and ineffectiveness remain.
 Some new major crisis cannot be ruled out.
 2.    The present government has survived for
 18 months,  and the evolution toward constitutional
 government is progressing on schedule;  an initial draft
 constitution has been prepared,  is scheduled for de-
 bate on January 11.  The timetable calls for pro-
 mulgation by about April,  and for presidential and
 legislative elections before the end of this year.
 3.    The immediate issue is Assembly resentment
 of the government's power to amend the constitution;
 beyond that, the prospect of elections themselves could
 entail unforeseen alliances,  new factionalism, and a
 new strain on the military whose unity and support
 remains essential to the stability of any regime.

 /Effectiveness of Bombing in North Vietnam:
 1.   The cumulative effects of the air raids on
 North Vietnam continue to limit the capability of
 the North Vietnamese forces for overt aggression,
 but they have not reduced the ability to support
 military activity in South Vietnam and Laos, either
 at present or increased levels of combat and manpower.
 2.   The bombings appear to be having some dele-
 terious effect on public morale.  We have reports of
 consumer shortages, and the extensive evacuation of
 civilian personnel has caused some economic difficulties.
 There is no good evidence, however, that the leadership's
 resolve to continue the war has been weakened.
 3.   The bombings have forced the diversion of
 major resources and work forces to repair damage.
 North Vietnam has been denied the use of larger coastal
 carriers, and is severely limited in the use of established
 port facilities.   Measurable losses to the economy and
 military establishment are estimated at $184 million.
 4.   On the other hand, POL supplies have not dropped
 below 60-day levels since September 1,   and attacks on
 rail, highway and waterway transportation have reduced
 efficiency but have not stopped movement.   Energetic
 construction of replacement and alternate bridges have
 rail capabilities at their highest level since the
 bombing stand-down a year ago.

 RHODESIA, SOUTH AFRICA, AND SANCTIONS
 I.   It is a sure bet that the problem of Rhodesia,

 3.  Meanwhile, they welcomed economic
 pressure against Rhodesia as a step
 toward making the major powers apply

 however--for instance, those which
 still operate within the British
 Commonwealth--insist that Rhodesia
 must be forced back into line.

 and sell tobacco, and the sanctions are not
 going to be extended to neighboring countries.
 A.   I do not need to speak to what the U.S.

 not going to go along with this, because
 the British economy is in bad shape already,

 attempts by guerrillas operating from

 these lines of bringing Wilson and Smith back
 together.  The African nations, therefore, are
 going to keep the pressure on London to make
 this impossible, and on all nations to extend
 the sanctions to South Africa. And you can
 that one of the main targets for these pressures
 will be the United States.

 This relatively rosy domestic scene may
 have helped convince Mobutu that he was
 strong enough to take on the Belgian
 company that owns and runs the copper
 mining    interests in the Congo--the
 Union Miniere, or Mining Union of. Upper
 Katanga, Tshombe's old stronghold in
 the southeastern Congo.
 II.    Mobutu gave the UMHK until January first to
 transfer its headquarters--which controls much
 more than just the Katanga copper mines--from
 Brussels to Leopoldville,(which they now call
 Kinshasa.)
 A.   The Belgians believe--and probably rightly--
 that the economic facts give them the upper
 and.
 1.        They provide about 70 percent of the
 Congo's foreign exchange, which has
 been cut off since December 23.  There
 is about enough on hand right now for
 one month of essential imports.
 2.        They do all of the export and marketing
 of Congolese copper.
 3.        Their best offer was to set up a
 headquarters in Leopoldville to run
 the Congolese portion of their interests.

 B. Mobutu apparently couldn't believe that
 his ultimatum couldn't work.   He kept
 hinting that the Belgian or the U.S.
 government should advise the company
 to negotiate with him.
 1. On January first, he had to go ahead
 and nationalize the company's assets
 in the Congo.
 2. He has set up a company in which his
 government will own 60 percent, with
 40 percent left for sale, or as bait
 to anyone who will help him run it.
 3. He hopes some 700 key managers and
 skilled workers who are foreigners will
 stay, to keep the mines running.
 C. Now Mobutu is asking $150 million from
 the company for copper they have in the
 export pipeline.   lie says if they don't
 pay, he will nationalize the Societe Generale,
 another related Belgian holding company with
 extensive assets in the Congo.
 D.   The company in turn claims $784 million from
 Mobutu for the assets he seized.   The directors
 in Brussels have announced that they will sue
 any firm trying to market copper or other metals
 from the successor company Mobutu has formed.

 Export of copper has stopped.   Mobutu
 ordered this just before Christmas to
 raise the squeeze on the Belgians.
 1.    It was pretty much of an empty gesture
 anyway, because most of the copper
 moves out by rail across Portuguese
 Angola---and the Portuguese have
 suspended transit traffic from both
 the Congo and Zambia to make these
 governments control Angolan exile
 guerrillas.
 III.    The pressure now is all on Mobutu.
 A.   He is losing fully half of the government's
 revenue as long as the copper doesn't move.
 B.   He is almost certain to have trouble
 working the mines if he can arrange
 for other marketing.
 1.   The European managers are not anxious
 to stay on under Congolese direction.
 2.   Many of the miners come from Ruanda,
 not from the Congo.   They are unhappy,
 too.   They don't think the Congo
 government is a reliable paymaster.
 C.   The two big Belgian companies are in sound
 shape financially, even without their Congo
 interests, and may feel this is as good a
 time as any to  et out.

 IV.   Mobutu has already sounded out,U.S. officials
 about a loan of $100 or $200,1to tide him over.
 He has been told flatly not to expect us  to
 bail him out, but he probably still believes
 that we will not refuse short-term financing
 of several hundred million if the alternative
 is collapse.
 A.   He is not a good risk at this point.
 Nationalization will make a shambles of
 the Congo economy, because the two companies
 have such wide interests in mines, banks,
 industry, and transportation.
 B.   The Belgians will be deeply resentful
 if he does receive help.
 C.   He has been negotiating a resumption of
 relations with the Soviet Union, and
 might get some help there, but even
 Soviet help couldn't do much to make up
 for a Belgian pull-out.
 V.     As this deadlock continues, there is a growing
 danger that the Congolese will tend to look on
 Belgian nationals--and indeed all whites in the
 Congo--as hostages.

 A.   There are about 40,000 non-African foreigners
 in the Congo.
 1.  The Belgians would be the primary
 targets for reprisals, or for violence,
 but the Congolese army is still little
 more than an undisciplined mob in many
 units.   They don't stop to look at
 passports.
 2.   That makes it understandable that many
 of the white foreigners the Congo must
 have to keep the economy running are
 beginning to have doubts about staying on.
