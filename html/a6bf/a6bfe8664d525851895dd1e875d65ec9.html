 Statement of Purpose
 This analysis of Communist Chinese propaganda on the
 nationwide formation of agro-industrial communes is intended
 to point up the vastly increased political and economic as
 well as the cultural and ideological controls which the
 Communist authorities will acquire over the huge peasant
 population of the mainland, and to provide pertinent back-
 ground or the development of the communes.  The communal
 process is intended to speed up the reduction of the Chinese
 peasant into a completely "socialist man," a.cog in the vast
 apparatus designed to extend Communist power and further
 Communist goals on the mainland of China.  The commune is
 intended to subordinate further the interests and welfare of
 the Chinese masses to the requirements of the Communist state,

 Summary
 Vastly,-?nereased control over the mainland population is Axplicit
 in the current Chinese Communist formation of agromindustrial communes
 and state-owned handicraft factories.  This first step toward forced
 communization is directed toward total state control, organization and
 ownership of mainland assets with workers and peasants alike to receive
 fixed wages rather than shares in the unit's productivity.  The larger
 agro-industrial units will permit easier central direction and indoc-
 trination and will provide for firmer control of the activities, work
 assignments and thoughts of China's masses.  The move, begun this
 spring at Mao Tse-tung,'s behest, appears designed to facilitate Communist
 China's intense drive for status in the socialist camp e? Peking is
 the only other nation in the camp beside the USSR to make the claim
 to be building Communism ?? and to make possible an increased economic
 product supporting Peking's claim to "great nation" status.  Achievement
 of these objectives, as in the past, will require further-inroads into
 the masses' freedom and welfare.

 II.  Communes to Replace Cooperatives as Chinaas Basic Unit
 Mao Calls for Communeso  The new "basic social unit" in Chinaus
 countryside is to be the agro-industrial "peopleOs commune "encompassing
 "industry., agriculture, commerce, culture and education and the military,"
 according to recent Peking announcements.  The concept is attributed to
 Mao Tse-tung, in keeping with the current cult publicity surrounding the
 Chinese leader.  According to CCP propagandist Chen Pe ta., writing in
 the mid-duly issue of the PartyQs new ideological journal Red Flag, Mao
 recently directed that the CPR's general course should be to "organize
 industry, agriculture, commerce and trade, culture and education and
 the militia mo that is., the armed strength of all the people om into a
 large commune which should form the basic unit of our society." The
 development was formalized on 29 August 1950 in a resolution of the
 Chinese Communist Central Committee.
 Hasty Organizations.  According to current publicity from mainland.
 China, the first communes were organized in April this year in Henan
 with the merging of small cooperatives into big ones - the average ratio
 is about 10 m 1.  By midsummer the campaign had spread quickly to all
 of China and in early September reports claimed virtual completion of
 the communization in six provincial areas.,  Henan., the first to begin.,
 was the first to announce completion of the task in early September,
 Virtually all other provinces and minority regions, after hasty establish-
 ment of experimental communes, were also well advanced in the transfoia-
 tion of their farm cooperatives and collectives and Peking reported that
 the communes would be established throughout the nation by harvest time
 this fall.*
 *  The possibility that the plan.for agro-industrial communes oo like
 that for cooperatives in 1955 ?? has been controversial is suggested by
 the fact that it was not reported on in the Party resolution on agricul-
 ture adopted at the second session of the VIII CCP Congress held this May,
 The Party resolution approved the controversial 12 year agricultural
 plan only "in principle" and recommended that the Central Committee be
 assigned the task of "making revisions that may be necessary" in the
 light of future developments.  The 12-year agricultural plan, orginally
 approved by the CCP Politbureau in January, 1956, has been revised at
 least eight times since then and has been the subject of some public
 controversy.  No direct criticism of the commune system has been
 publicized however,

 Publicity Stresses Production Potential, Conceals Repressions. Esta-
 blishment of the communes on the mainland have been accorded rather more
 than normal publicity for a domestic topic and broadcasts from Peking
 have beamed the news to all audiences at home and abroad.  Additionally
 the official Chinese Communist news agency, NCNA,, has transmitted reports
 of the development of communes to its. domestic and foreign consumers.
 Peking stresses the increased production potential of the communes;
 .repressive features of the system are revealed only implicitly.  The
 announcements of the completion of communal organizations in several pro-
 vinces in early September occasioned a peak in broadcast attention with
 some 80 separate broadcast commentaries on the subject in the week I m 7
 September.  This accounted for over ten percent of all broadcast commentaries over Radio Peking for the period.  The resolution of communes
 approved by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on 29
 August was released and publicized heavily on 10 September - 28 separate
 broadcasts carried the information to all audiences.  In addition to the
 regular stress in home and regional broadcasts, news of the communes is
 broadcast most widely to Southeast Asia and to Overseas Chinese audiences.,
 without apparent. tailoring.  As is customary, comment to date has made
 no attempt to portray the development of communes in China as one deserving
 of emulation-by other nations.
 Communes Necessary to Meet Accelerated Production Goals,  The rationale
 advanced for the large-scale organization of communes throughout China is
 first and foremost an economic ones  Peking on 20 August declared that
 "the superiority of the commune system has made it possible for the difficult
 and huge production assignments to be completed successfully."  Just two
 days before Peking reported a Peoples Daily comment that the peasants had
 begun to realize that "small cooperatives could not meet the requirements
 of the 'big leap forward? in various fields, but had become an obstacle
 to the development ofthe productive forces.'"  The paper added that it had
 become "urgent., under these circumstances, that the people?s communes"
 be established,  An account of. Honan?s experience stated,
 *  Controver. y over China?s ability to meet the rash goals for increased
 agricultural production was exposed publicly by both Liu Shao-chi and Tan
 Chen?lin, the Party?s agricultural expert, at the May Congress sessions.
 Both referred to ranking Party cadres who opposed "reckless advance" and
 who were "waiting for the autumn harvests to settle accounts."  Formation
 of the communes and amalgamation of small cooperatives seems part of the
 leaders' attempts to reach the high targets set.  There is no indication
 that the disagreement over "reckless advance" included disapproval of the
 organization of the-communes, although this may have been the case.

 In view of the increasing demands of industrial construction
 and the need for improving the people's livelihood further,
 the masses of cadres and people recognized the urgent need
 of merging the small. cooperative3 into large ones in order
 to solve the shortcomings involving manpower and materials
 which were being concounzered by the small farm c.,,,rganizations
 and to provide conditions for "building more, faster, better
 and more economically,"
 Propaganda Claims Greater Disci lpine and Efficiency'  Peking lists
 the following major advantages that communes will have ever the smaller
 and less ordered cooperatives and collectives,
 1, "The working efficiency of the peasants in the communes is,
 in general, 20 percent higher than in the agricultural
 cooperatives," according to a discussion of the question on
 1 September.  Comment stresses the more organized use of the
 available labor in specialized work brigades and notes es-
 pecially the release of women for work both in the fields   d
 in other communal activities.  The final break-up of the tra-
 ditional Chinese family system is predicated on the widespread
 development in the communes of public kitchens, nurseries,
 tailoring establishments and the like,..  One province alone
 claims that already seven million women have been released in
 this fashion from their household duties for more productive
 work.  Even the aged and infirm are to be encouraged to under-
 take limited production assignments geared to their infirmities.
 2..  Establishment of the more disciplined communes will facilitate
 the "accumulation of common funis1t, according to Peking's plans.
 The. ability of the regime, in short, to withdraw surplus funds
 and savings for state purposes and, at the same time, to supply
 less goods to the commune which instead will be expected to
 produce'its own necessities of life, will be considerably
 enhanced.
 The Peking regime expects a more rational and efficient use of
 the land in the large communes to bring about large crop increases
 which will in the foreseeable few years eliminate the food pro-
 blem and provide first an average of 1,000 and later 1,500 cattier
 of food per capita.  At the same time, the planned introduction
 of primitive industry in the communes will add to the total
 industrial prdduct and is expected in many. things to make the
 commune self sufficient in necessary industrial and consumer goods.,
 The State will thus be freed to pursue the goal of modernized
 heavy industry for defense needs, a goal which is currently
 (September) being reactivated on a priority basis.

 The introduction of industry into the basic farm communities.,
 it is hoped by the Chinese Communist authorities., will also'
 facilitate the "elimination of differences between town and
 country., industry and agriculture and mental and manual labor."
 The establishment of factory brigades within the communes is
 expected to gradually provide the worker nucleus for more
 widespread expansion of industrialization in China in the
 future.
 Existing communes., which average from 10,000 m 409000 in member-
 ship according to local conditions., will have the advantage., the Chinese
 Communists declare., of "centralized control and unified management" and
 will develop and engage in all spheres of activity,, including industry.,
 agriculture, forestry,, animal husbandry, subsidiary occupations., market-
 ing and supply, credit., culture and education,, public health, and
 communications.  The existing hsiang or administrative village is to be
 replaced by the commune and hsiang officials will staff the commune.
 Emphasizing the advantages of centralized direction and unified
 management,, the commune is set up on the basis of work brigades which
 can be assigned and utilized as deemed necessary.  Current reports state
 that centralized deployment of work brigades has resulted in the sudden
 growth of communal industrial units and in the advance of such other
 projects as afforestation.,.flood control., irrigation., electrification,
 and primitive farm mechanization.
 Private Proeerty Eliminated:  A major characteristic of the new
 commune is the system of "common ownership" which will universally deprive
 the peasants of the ownership of the few,things left to him in the
 collectives - private garden plots and tools.  The new commune member
 will be permitted to retain only It a small number of-domestic animals and
 fowl as private property.P?  The private garden plots., it is directed,,
 "will be taken over by the operational units Lommunal kitchen of the
 people?s communes for cultivating grain or vegetables for the joint con-
 sumption of the commune members."
 Propaganda Lists Strengthened P01it cal Control:  The political
 motivation for the change to communal organization clearly includes the
 increased degree of control which the Party can exercise over larger units.
 Control which. is presumat   necessary to meet China?s ambitious economic
 goals.  In keeping with this., Chinese Communist propagandists call for
 strengthening Party leadership and perfecting the Party organizations
 within the communes  The Party., Peking adds

 Approved For Release 2001/11/08 : CIA-RDP78-02771 R000300120008-5
 must not only consolidate all rank-and-file Party cadres,
 but must also.improve the methods of Party leadership,
 fully developing:the roles of the Party, youth league, and
 women's organizations.  It must also strengthen the Part  s
 ideological-political program for the members within the
 commune and develop the "red and expert" Party activists.
 Concomittantly, Chinese Communist propaganda lists labor discipline
 as one of the major characteristics of the new communes.  Frequent
 reference is made to imposing "stern control over the fulfillment of the
 labor quota" assigned each commune member.  Perhaps the greatest lever
 to be used in controlling the commune members is the newly adopted
 wage system whereby members who fail to work "enthusiastically" or are
 "lax" fail to receive a-bonus - deducted from their wages in advance
 or even to demotion in wage grade.  Another important lever of day to
 day control ever the commune members exists in the para-military
 organization established in the communes.  According to an editorial in
 Red Fes, one of the Party's theoretical organs, commune members are to be
 "organized along military lines, do things the way battle duties are
 carried out."  'Red Flag adds that the swift expansion of agriculture
 demands that the peasants "quickly strengthen their organization, act more
 quickly and with greater discipline and efficiency."
 Wage Coercion Outlined.  A basic difference between the new communes
 and the former collectives is the adoption of a wage system for peasants
 in the communes,  The new organizations will operate a "basic wage plus
 reward system" to replace the former "work-point,system" of remuneration
 under the socialist collectives.  Under the new wage system, Peking explains,
 the amotant of fixed wages will be paid to members according
 to the individual labor performances and work attitude, plus
 monthly and seasonal rewards.  The commune has also set aside
 funds for rewarding those whose performances have been adjudged
 outstanding.
 It is in the use of bonuses and rewards that the commune leadership
 can exert the greatest control.  Eighty percent of the basic wage of each
 member will be paid him directly, but 20 percent will be withheld, to be
 returned only 'in the form of a bonus or reward for outstanding performance.
 A worker who fails to display the proper "enthusiasm" or is lax or fails
 to work the requisite number of days not only loses the 20 percent of his
 basic wage already withheld, but runs the risk of being demoted to a lower
 wage grade or of having further wages deducted.  On the other hand, to
 qualify for a bonus, Peking requires that he be "obedient, enthusiastic,
 overfulfill production quotas, struggle against evil personalities and
 practices, think progressively and work at least 28 days per month."  The
 pressure for conformity and production are thus increased manifold.

 According to the draft regulations of one commune,, "the distribution
 of income shall be based on the principle of ensuring high speed in
 expanded production." While the regulations call for increased wages as
 the rate of production goes up, the regulations prescribe not only that
 the rate of wage increase must be slower than the rate of increase in prom
 duction,, but also that when living standards reach the level of "well-to-
 do middle peasants," the rate of wage increase should be reduced to make
 possible greater accumulation for industry.
 Financial Problems  Some problems are foreseen in the wage-income
 pattern of the communes.. One involves the expected reaction of members
 of comparatively well-to-do cooperatives which are forced to merge and
 hence share their wealth with poorer cooperatives.  The Party Secretary
 of Shansi Province, Tae Luuchia, writing in the 16 May Peo~ ple's Da.ili,
 warned that "the existence of markedly well-to-do and markedly poor
 cooperatives side by side might well lead to a fierce class struggle."
 And a Honan conference declared that communes should strive to maintain a
 !'reasonable ratio between the pay for labor contributed to agricultural.,
 industrial and subsidiary production in order to avoid discord between
 members engaged in different types of work,, thereby adversely affecting
 the practice of paying according to the contribution of labor."
 Similar Changes in Handicraft Coop2ratives to Meet Accelerated Goals
 The handicraft cooperatives too are in the process of transformation into
 amalgamated units known as cooperative factories or state-owned factories
 operating under the "system of ownership by all the people."  A report of
 a national handicraft conference held in Peking in September explained that
 workers in cooperative and local state-owned factories
 are given back their shares in the cooperative and become
 wage workers.  The local state-owned factory comes entire-
 ly within the system of ownership by all the people.  The
 cooperative factory also comes within that system in essense,
 since the members no longer own shares and rely entirely
 on wages.
 The report notes, however., that the cooperative factory "retains some
 elements of collective ownership," inasmuch as profits of the factory.
 after taxes,, are returned to the management of the local handicraft coop-
 erative.
 Like the agricultural cooperative transformation, the changeover of
 the handicraft cooperatives is based on an admitted necessity for re-
 organizing to meet the accelerated economic goals.  Acknowledging the dif-
 ficulty of meeting the "heavy orders" for their products,` Peking claims that

 it is only by turning themselves into factories., changing
 the system of ownership, further emancipating the forces
 of production and coordinating more closely with the nation-
 al economic plans that the handicraft cooperatives can a-
 chieve mechanized production speedily and better serve the
 country's socialist construction.
 The handicraft conference is said to have agreed "in general" that
 I'all handicraft cooperatives should be turned gradually into cooperative
 or state factories," and the change-over is reported to be underway all
 over the country.  Approximately a tenth of the 5,000,000 handicraft
 members have been effected to date.  The reorganization., it is reported.,
 is proceeding under the leadership of the local CCP committee and with
 the guidance and help of "experienced workers provided by the Party
 organizations."
 III.  Chinese Use of Soviet Exx"erience
 Khrushchev's Farm Plans-,  Peking's venturesome program to amalgamate
 its agricultural collectives into large agro-industrial communes bears some
 similarity to the program for the rapid merger of Soviet farm collectives
 begun in 1950 at the initiative of Khrushchev., then Politbureau spokesman
 on agricultural policy.  The 252,000 farm collectives in the Soviet Union
 at the beginning of 1950 were rapidly reduced to 97,000 by October of 19526
 Khrushchev advocated an even greater transformation in the countryside,
 and he recommended in 1950 and again in 1951 the formation of agrogorods
 or agro-cities around which the new and larger collective farms would be
 organized.*  Presumably these agro-cities were to include industrial
 facilities, as now provided in the new Chinese communes.  The Khrushchev
 plan of eight years ago was undoubtedly more ambitious than the current
 Chinese communal program, but it seems at least worth considering that the
 Chinese have borrowed from this original Khrushchev plan and adapted it to
 Chinese needs and circumstances., a technique which has become a hallmark
 of most Chinese comment on the usefulness of Soviet experience.
 Although Khrushchev9s 1950-51 espousal of agrogorods was immediately
 disavowed by the Soviet regime, it was seemingly returned to favor in
 .August this year when IzvestiaOs 17 August editorial quoted from Khrushchev's
 1951 speech and advocated the.reconstruction of farm villages along the
 lines advanced by Khrushchev in 1950-51.  Khrushchev's specific reference
 to agrogorods however was not repeated in Izvestia.

 Chinese Praise for Khrushchev PoliciesA  Pertinent to possible in-
 fluence on the Chinese of Khrushchevus original farm program is the ob-
 servation that Chinese leaders have been unusually open in their approval
 of Khrushchev's policies, particularly his domestic policies.  Chinese
 endorsement of current policies identified with Khrushchev is often far
 more direct than the customary endorsements from the rest of the socialist
 camp.
 Outstanding in this regard was the speech of the CPR chairman, Mao
 Tse-tung, at the 40th Anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution last
 November.  Mao, alone among the foreign Communist leaders in Moscow for
 the anniversary, approved the domestic policies identified with Khrushchev,
 including opposition to the "anti-Party group," improvement of Party and
 political work in the armed forces and the decentralization of industry.
 He called the policies `'wise measures" of the CPSU Central Committee.
 Praising the successes which the CPSU4s creative application of
 Marxism-Leninism to "practical tasks" had brought about in the Soviet
 Union, Mao declared:
 The wise measures taken by the Central Committee of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the questions of
 overcoming the cult of the individual, developing agri-
 culture, reorganizing the administration of industry and
 construction, extending the power of the federal republics
 and local organizationsz, opposing the anti-Party group,
 consolidating unity within the Party and improving the
 Party and political work in the Soviet Army and Navy., will
 undoubtedly promote still further the consolidation and
 development of all undertakings in the Soviet'Union.
 And Mao added a reference, unusually laudatory even for the Chinese, to
 the usefulness and universality of Soviet experience.
 The Chinese people are fortunate in having the experience
 of the October Revolution and of the socialist construe-
 tion in the Soviet Union,, which enabled them to make fewer
 mistakes., to avoid many others, and to pursue their cause
 fairly smoothly, although they still face many difficulties.
 It is clear that, after the October Revolution, if a pro-
 letarian revolutionary of any country should overlook or
 not seriously study the experience of the Russian revolution,
 of the proletarian dictatorship, and of socialist construc-
 tion of the Soviet Union, and should fail to use these
 experiences analytically and in a creative way in the light
 of the specific conditions in his own country, he would not
 be able to master Leninism...  and he would not

 Approved For Release 2001/11/08 : CIA-RDP78-02771 R000300120008-5
 be able to solve the problems of revolution and construc-
 tion in his own country correctly.
 Chinese Follow Soviet MTSS  ecentralizationo  The most immediate
 example of that devotion to Soviet experience cited by Mao as of such
 importance to the future of China, as of other socialist states., oc-
 curred less than three months later.  On 1 March 1958 the Communist China
 news service NCNA, and the principal Peking papers, carried extensive
 passages from Khrushchev?s report on the reorganization of the Machine
 Tractor Stations (MTS) before the February plenum of the CPSU Central
 Committee.  It was reported at the time that the Chinese papers "pointed
 out the great opportunities offered by the new measures."  Just two weeks
 earlier, Peking had publicized an experimental program paralleling the
 Soviet plan to turn over farm machinery to the individual farm coopera-
 tives.
 But Peking, aware that implications of slavish copying of the USSR
 would adversely affect the Chinese population, advanced a claim to have
 adopted the program independently of the Soviet Union, stating
 (1)  that the Chinese experimental program was worked out during
 the first five year plan and
 (2)  that the program for the decentralization of heavy farm
 machinery "had emerged from'l.economic and social conditions
 in China.
 Peking had suppressed publication in China of Khrushchevas first announce-
 ment (22 January 1958 in Minsk) of the Soviet reorganization of the MTS
 and had publicized Khrushchev?s second announcement in late February only
 after NCNA had released a report on China#s'own program based on Chinese
 conditions and needs.
 While these observations are only suggestive., they all point strongly
 to the keen interest the Chinese have evinced in Soviet internal develop-
 ments, and to the strong support they have advanced for Khrushchev?s prag-
 matic approach to economic-political organizations.  There seems little
 reason to doubt that Mao V5  unusually strong endorsement of Soviet experience
 and particularly of the internal policies advocated by Khrushchev evidenced
 an interest in utilizing Soviet planning in China U8  own economic course., with
 suitable revisions to fit the Chinese situation. Planning on the decentrali-
 zation of the MTS must have been well underway in both the Soviet Union and
 China during this period.    Furthermore., it is likely, but not at this time
 provable., that the Chinese leaders also developed an interest in Khrushchev?s
 more advanced plans for agricultural development.  The initial formation
 of China ? s first commune in April suggests that comrhunal plans were being
 developed at about the same time as were those for reorganization of China's
 machine tractor stations,. first discussed in February.

 IVs  Communes Provide First Step Toward Communism
 Liu Shao-chi Implied New Ideological Status-.  Peking's claim to be
 engaged in "a social transformation leading from socialism to Communism,"
 a claim advanced for the first tines with the advent of the commune system,
 appears on the surface at least to be somewhat at odds with its customarily
 acknowledged status of "transition to socialism."   This latter more modest
 stage, shared with other members of the socialist ea p, was endorsed
 officially at the CCP"s May sessions of the VIII Party Congress.  The
 political resolutions of that Congress concluded that the purpose of the
 newly-adopted general line was "to build socialism,"  But closer perusal of
 the chief Congress documents, particularly the keynote speech delivered. on
 behalf of the Central Committee by Party theoretician Liu Shao-chi, reveals
 some vacillation on the question of China's ideological status,with some
 broad hints.of a more advanced stage in the offing.
 On at least four occasions in his speech, Liu raised the issue of
 Communism as a stage to which China was currently aspiring.  Taken together,
 Liu"s argument appeared to be that
 (1)  China has already completed, in the main, its socialist revolution
 on the economic front (in 1956) and on the ideological and
 political fronts (in 1957);*
 (2)  The CCP"s new call for technological and cultural revolutions re-
 quires that China"s "constantly developing revolution must now
 advance to a new stage";
 (3)  This includes the duty to "consolidate and, develop socialist
 ownership",
 (4)  In order to achieve these ends, the Chinese are currently engaged
 in a"Communist ideological emancipation movement" in which a
 "mighty torrent of Communist ideas has swept away many stumbling
 blocks", and
 (5)  In Lenin?s words, this is "the actual beginning at Communism."
 China's farms were fully cooperativized in 1956, according to. Peking
 reports, and were transformed into "fully socialist cooperatives" or
 collectives by the following year.  This claim excludes certain minority
 areas which have been allowed to proceed at a slower pace in socialist
 reorganization.  This far-exceeded the pace originally recommended by Mao
 Tee-tung on 31 July 1955 when he called for a reversal of China's oonser-
 native agricultural policy.  Mao had scheduled the completion of coopera-
 tivization for 1960 and collectivization within three five-year plans.
 The current drive for the formation of communes, by Peking's own admission,
 is being conducted at an even faster pace was the drive during 1955-570

 Approved For Release 2001/11/08 : CIA-RDP78-02771R000300120008-5
 Expanding on what Liu Shao-chi termed Mao's belief in the Marxiat-
 Leninist theory of "uninterrupted revolution",,* Liu. argued that
 on the eve of the victory of the democratic revolution
 in 19499 the Party's Central Committee had outlined the future task of
 transforming the "new democratic state into a socialist state."  By
 projection, Liu seemed to argue that with the virtual victory of social-
 ism in China today, the transition to Communism need not wait for the
 loose ends to be tied up.
 The CCP leadership at the Congress was obviously reluctant to spell
 out Liu's implications,, as Party doctrine, and the Congress resolution
 stopped at the stage of "building socialist."  But just two and a half
 months later, propagandists began their reference to China's transition
 to Communism within the specialized context of the formation of agro-
 industrial communes.  Apparently the concept of the "uninterrupted revo-
 lution" is interpreted as authority for China both to complete the social-
 ist transformation and'at the same time, to proceed with the transition
 to Communism, at least in specified sectors of the nation.
 Communist Stage No Longer Remvteo  Elite Peking propaganda has boldly
 underscored the fact that with the establishment of communes,, China is
 actively experimenting with the form of Communism.  The Central Committee
 resolution (29 August 1958) approving the communes states clearly.
 It seems that. the attainment of Communism in China is no
 longer a remote future event.  We should actively use the.
 form of people's communes to explore the practical road
 of transition to Communism,
 The Central Committee admits that, the introductory wage, system is
 based on the system of "to each according to his work" rattier than on the
 Communist principle of "to each according to his need,"' and that the
 transition to "common ownership" may take six years or even longer for
 the entire country.  But following this, the Central Committee declares.,
 only a. "number of years" will pass before
 *  Although some writers have suggested a similarity between Mao's theory
 of "uninterrupted revolution" and Trotsky's theory of "continuous revolu-
 tion", in fact there is a basic difference inasmuch as Trotsky's theory
 applied only to international events,, while Mao's theory has bden applied
 so far only domestically.

 Chinese society will enter the era of Communism where
 the principle of from each according to his ability.
 and to each according to his needs will be practiced.
 At that foreseeable time,, according to the Party, 'the function of
 the state is. limited to protecting the country from external aggression but
 plays no role.internallye"  The Chinese Communists therefore hold out the
 possibility, in the "no longer remote future",, of the gradual withering away
 of the states
 Inasmuch as China has hitherto claimed only to be building socialism, or
 to`be in the transition to socialism, this appears to be a calculated move
 to mount the ideological ladder quickly and attain the rung which the Soviets
 themselves only reached in February 1956 when they claimed finally to be
 building Communist at the U CPSU Congress,  However., even the Soviets have
 not teen so forward in their anticipation of reaching the nirvana of
 Communism.
 Similarity to TuSoslav.Statements on Communes.,  In fact, Chinese Communist
 propaganda on both the Communes and the ultimate attainment of Communism and
 the withering away of the' state seems matched only by the Yugoslavs.  There is
 a striking parallel between current Peking proclamations and the pronouncements
 of the draft program of the Yugoslav Party this spring4*  The Yugoslavs., who
 first established communes in 1955 and reorganized them in 1951, appear to re-
 gard the communes as an essential step in preparation for Communism and the
 gradual withering away of the state.  Arguing -- like the Chinese.-.- that the
 state can wither away only as its functions are replaced by other forms of
 socialist organization,, the 1958 Yugoslav Party program explains:
 As a political mechanism of management aso the commune represents
 a leading institution of direct socialist democracy which realizes
 the government of the working people through the working people
 themselves and for theme  Taking over the management of social
 activities and having at its disposal the resources necessary to
 carry out these activities,, the commune is not only and solely a
 school of democracy, but it is that democracy itself; it is the
 basic cell of self-management, by citizens and their control of
 their joint activities..
 Soviet pronouncements have generally avoided reference to the commune even
 on the theoretical plane.
 Criticism of Yugoslav revisionism has not apparently hindered Chinese aware-
 ness of Yugoslav experimentation,  Both China and Poland adapted the'Yugoslav
 system of-workers' councils in 1956, but Although Poland repudiated the system
 this year,, China incorporated it in.the now constitution of the All=Chin
 Federation of Trade Unions in late 1957, and apparently continues to utilize
 the f ormo
