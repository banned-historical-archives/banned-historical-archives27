 DENG XIAOPING AND THE TAIWAN QUESTION
 Summary                                   "~l
 Deng's vulnerability on the Taiwan issue must be assessed in a
 broader context than a specific foreign policy question. Taiwan represents
 a fundamental issue because it raises questions of sovereignty and
 legitimacy.  Changes in Taiwan's status promoted by other countries--
 particularly the US--would require Deng to make corresponding adjustments
 in Beijing's relations with those countries; these would be calibrated
 to match the perceived provocation.  Such changes could be made without
 basic shifts in China's foreign policy orientation and in themselves would
 not seriously undercut Deng's political position.
 But in certain circumstances, where Deng 's policy lines were under
 serious challenge across a broad front and reversals began to become
 cumulative, a perceived setback on the Taiwan question could gravely
 undermine Deng's position.  This would be particularly the case if strong
 nationalistic sentiments--deep sources tapped by Mao in creating the
 "Yanan spirit" and in staging his revolution--became aroused and were
 turned against Deng while he was weakened as a reduZt of economic policy
 failures, social unrest, and a deepening sense of malaise.  In such
 circumstances Taiwan would be an inflammatory issue that dcmraae-limiting
 maneuvers by a weakened Deng might fail to control.
 This memorandum was prepared by
 Office of Political Analysis, National Foreign Assessment Center,
 in response to a request from Mr. James LiZZey, Office of the Assistant
 to the President for National Security Affairs.  Resea_rch.for this report
 was completed 17 March 1981.  This paper was coordinated with the National
 Intelligence Officer for East Asia.  Comments and questions mau he 2ddres^ed

 In less adverse circumstances, Deng could manage a retrogression
 of US-China relations, probably by seizing the initiative to take
 retaliatory measures against the US.  Recovery from such a situation
 would require time as well as the initiative and commitment to repair
 the damage.  Deng has the commitment--his assessment of China's strategic
 situation has not changed, and it is unlikely he would accept the idea
 of a real turn toward the USSR as punishment for US perfidy.  At 76,
 however, Deng may not have the time, and as policy setbacks weaken his
 credibility, he may find his initiative so restricted-that he would  ..~t
 be able to put his policies firmly back on track.
 These questions are complex because they raise fundamental
 questions about Chinese political dynamics and stretch our
 limited understanding of China's decisionmaking process.
 An assessment of Deng's vulnerability on the Taiwan question
 must address three aspects:   The relationship between foreign
 policy and domestic politics since 1949; the Taiwan question
 and leadership sensitivities regarding it; and Deng's position
 as China's preeminent leader?  Is the US connection now,
 or is it likely to become, a political liability for Deng?
 How vulnerable is Deng Xiaoping on the question of Taiwan?
 Would an upgrading of US relations with Taiwan weaken him
 politically to such an extent that he might lose his position
 in the current power structure.
 The Historical Record
 Chinese foreign policy since the founding of the PRC
 has undergone a series of radical shifts, some influenced
 heavily by domestic politics, but the historical record
 indicates that foreign policy differences have played a
 secondary part in-leadership struggles.   While.Mao Zedong
 and Zhou Enlai were alive, they dominated China's foreign
 policymaking.   Other leaders could exert some general
 influence but they had less responsibility for the formula-
 tion of basic policy.
 During the period up to the death of Mao, the many
 political struggles in Beijing were precipitated almost

 SECRET
 exclusively by domestic concerns.   Foreign policy aspects,
 however, may for tactical reasons have become an element in
 the infighting.   The fall of Politburo member Gao Gang in
 the early 1950s, still a murky matter, may have had an
 important foreign dimension in view of the charge Gao had
 covert ties to Moscow.   Former Defense Minister Peng Dehuai
 challenged Mao's agrarian policy at the Lushan Plenum of
 1959, and paid the price of opposing Mao by losing all his
 posts.   The additional charge of being pro-Soviet and
 opposing Mao's foreign policy line was a subsidiary issue.
 The Cultural Revolution was an intensely domestic affair,
 and the foreign policy-related charge against former State
 Chairman Liu Shaoqi---being a ?Khrushchev-type revisionist
 was not a major factor in his downfall.   Lin Biao, who died
 while fleeing to the Soviet Union and had earlier expressed
 reservations about and had tried to block China's opening to
 the United States, got in political trouble primarily for
 reasons unrelated to the orientation or conduct of China's
 foreign policy, and he fell in the climax of a domestic
 power struggle.
 As Zhou's health failed in the early 1970s, Mao came to
 rely increasingly on Deng Xiaoping for help in carrying out
 China's outward-looking foreign policy.   Mao turned against
 Deng in 1976, after Zhou's death, for domestic policy and
 power reasons, not because of foreign policy differences.
 But even in this instance foreign policy issues may have
 been at play.
 The historical record thus indicates that while specific
 foreign policy issues have repeatedly figured as tactical
 ploys within a larger struggle, domestic considerations have
 overwhelmingly been central to Chinese politics.   These
 ploys are useful in power struggles because particular
 issues assume importance as part of an indictment of a
 leade'r's overall performance; if a case can be developed
 against a leader for faltering on a range of issues, a
 foreign policy question could act as a catalyst for a major
 political struggle.
 The Taiwan Question
 The question of Taiwan's international status has great
 symbolic importance for PRC leaders, and it is potentially an
 explosive foreign policy issue.   For the PRC leaders, many
 of whom played an important part in the "liberation" of the

 mainland, Kuomintang control of the island is a constant
 reminder that the long civil war is not over, and remains a
 blatant challenge to the legitimacy, credibility and strength
 of the Communist regime.   It is important, however, to
 distinguish between the problem of acquiring physical control
 over the island and that of defending the PRC's formal claim
 to sovereignty over Taiwan.   Beijing cannot now conquer
 Taiwan by force of arms; it knows this but is not making the
 military preparations to change this fact.   What the PRC has
 done--w-4th many nations that maintain "informal" relations
 with the island but particularly with United States--is to
 trade off the substance of actual separation of the island
 from the mainland for the symbolism of "one China."
 The PRC leaders are particularly sensitive to any
 action that negates Beijing's symbolic claim to sovereignty
 over the island.   Such actions leave the PRC with neither
 the substance nor the symbol and tend to raise fundamental
 questions about the nature of the bargain its leaders have
 accepted.   These leaders rode nationalist currents--among
 others--to power 30 years ago, and they do not want those
 currents to be turned against them now.
 There is another salient aspect of the Taiwan question.
 Since 1954, PRC leaders have regarded the US approach to
 this issue as a crucial indicator of basic US attitudes
 toward Beijing.   This was true during the period of Sino-US
 estrangement, and it has remained so in the period of
 rapprochement since 1971.   Since rapprochement, moreover,
 the Taiwan issue has acquired a broad strategic context:   from
 Beijing's perspective,  for the US to permit its parochial
 concerns with Taiwan to damage the anti-Soviet front would
 indicate that it is not a reliable partner.   Thus, for the
 US to default in Beijing's eyes by failing both to take into
 account Chinese sensitivities and to act according to strategic
 imperatives would raise basic questions about the utility of
 the Sino-US relationship as a whole.   No Chinese leader can
 afford 'to forget this.
 Thus, the response of a large proportion of China's
 leaders to a perceived change in the status of Taiwan, brought
 about by the US, would be an emotional as well as a reasoned
 one.   Arguments to the effect that the larger strategic

 situation needs to be borne in mind or that the benefits of
 good relations with the US still outweigh the costs might
 very well be unavailing.   Like many relatively weak countries,
 China tends to stand on principle because it does not find
 it easy to throw its weight around.   Since 1949 it has
 repeatedly sacrificed possible advantage to uphold principle.
 In response to a perceived provocation on the Taiwan question,
 there would be considerable pressure within China to take
 the kind of retaliatory measures against the US that could
 severely strain the overall relationship.
 Deng's Power Position
 Since his return to power in 1977, Deng has made
 impressive gains in strengthening his position in the
 leadership and has become the paramount force in Chinese
 decisionmaking.   But though he is generally regarded as the
 regime's strongman or preeminent leader, Deng cannot dictate
 policy to the Politburo.   He must wheel and deal to accomplish
 his ends, and on more than one occasion he has been obliged
 to change policies or accept compromises and setbacks in the
 face of opposition.
 Deng's authority within the Politburo derives from
 three main sources:   his prestige and experience as one of
 China's most capable senior leaders;  his intricate and broad
 web of personal contacts throughout the Chinese party,
 government, and military bureaucracies; and the aggressive
 use of his political resources to propose, detail, and
 implement specific policy initiatives.   A few Chinese leaders
 have prestige comparable to Deng's, but very few can match
 his access to important leaders and levers within the
 bureaucracy.
 Deng's willingness to expend political capital to bring
 about change has in varying degrees alienated segments of the
 leadership--veteran party cadre, parts of the military
 establishment, and some economic managers, for example.   It
 is in dealing with such opponents that Deng has demonstrated
 his adroit political maneuvering as he resorts to improvisation,
 compromise, and retreat from time to time.   It was only a
 few months after Deng's greatest political triumph, at the
 Third Plenum of the current Central Committee in late 1978,

 for example, that he was under political att

 , not only by
 leftist leaders who had apparently been discredited and lost
 ground at the plenum, but also by former political allies.
 Characteristically, however, he returned to the offensive and
 by the time of the Fifth Plenum, in early 1980, he scored major
 new successes in strengthening his position in the power
 strnct~,re
 This volatility in the political setting is thus largely
 Deng 's own doing as he presses ahead to realize his objectives.
 His initiatives, arouse opposition among those with vested
 interests in the status quo; he forms new coalitions to isolate
 the opposition and consolidate his position; and then these
 coalitions come apart as the cycle begins once again.   In recent
 months Deng and his allies have been in retreat.   Economic
 policies with which Deng has been associated have not been as
 successful as he had hoped and have had to be altered, efforts
 to reform the party and loosen its rigid control of society have
 met stiff opposition and created unrest, and the show trial
 of the Gang of Four seemed to have created more problems
 than it solved.   Deng has found it necessary to placate the
 military and other elements concerned over too rapid change,
 and although he has recently won a signal victory in overcoming
 strong objections to his choice for a new defense minister,
 pockets of discontent remain among the military.   The absorp-
 tion in struggles of power has created impressions of disarray
 that adversely affect the image Deng wishes to project of a
 confident leadership ably and effectively bringing China into
 the modern world.   Nonetheless, Deng seems to have again managed
 the adjustments required to regain his balance, his opponents
 have been unable to form a cohesive alliance that could threaten
 his position, and we can expect him to return to the offensive

 Deng and the Taiwan Issue
 Deng expects to be judged on whether or not his policies
 bring about the intended results.   His image is one of a
 pragmatist--one who believes that if a policy works, it must
 be right.   This approach works to Deng's advantage in that it
 gives him great flexibility.   Implicit in his policy initiatives
 is the assumption that they will work, and that if they do not,
 they can and must be changed.   It is unlikely that he would

 allow a situation to develop in which he alone among ranking
 leaders was held responsible for a failed policy; he would
 act preemptively to change the policy first.   But pragmatism
 cuts both ways;  he himself will be judged on the success of
 his policies.
 Though the Taiwan issue is not likely in itself to be the
 crucial test for Dengist policies, it is one in which he has
 the least room to maneuver by sharing responsibility with other
 leaders.  At the crucial moment in the development of Sino-US
 relations, Deng deliberately trained the spotlight on himself.
 He personally conducted the final phase of the normalization
 negotiations.   He undoubtedly sold the pending agreement to
 the Third Plenum, which met just before the agreement was
 concluded--and it is not irrelevant to note that the decisions
 of this plenum legitimate much of Deng's reform program and,
 by implication, much of his authority.   It was, moreover, Deng
 who.visited the US in January 1979 and who personally and
 politically benefited from the accompanying applause; and it was
 Deng who made the substantive decisions during the visits of
 virtually all the US leaders who traveled to China in 1979 and
 1980.   In these circumstances, he would have to defend himself
 against the charge that he personally miscalculated or was
 tricked by Washington during the normalization negotiations and
 Deng, of course,  is prepared to take measures that would
 set back the development of Sino-US relations if he believed
 it necessary to do so.   Such an action could spring from his
 own belief that the US was deviating from the basic normaliza-
 tion principles, or from his perception that a demand for
 retaliation against US actions was building within the Politburo.
 Deng is responsible for China's foreign policy, and he is not
 likely to stand by passively in the  face of potential affronts
 to China's sense of sovereignty.
 Deng has placed many allies in key power positions, and in
 current circumstances anything less than a drastic downturn
 in Sino-US relations resulting from a unilateral US action
 would be very unlikely to precipitate Deng's fall.   It is
 clear, however, that he would not emerge from a setback on

 the Taiwan issue without suffering political damage.   If such
 a development coincided with serious troubles in other areas,
 the Taiwan issue could provide a dangerous weapon to opponents
 holding Deng to account for policy failures, and particularly
 for allowing China to be humiliated again by foreigners.
 Thus, Deng's frequent warnings to the US Government about
 the adverse repercussions of a change in policy toward
 Taiwan is likely to stem from several motives:   genuine
 concern about the issue itself, an attempt to preempt
 criticism about Deng's handling of the Taiwan issue the past
 several years, and awareness that political damage to
 himself and his programs could be considerable.
 In sum, we believe that a major change in US-Taiwan
 relations would contribute to a weakening of Deng's position
 within the leadership, and would lead him to retaliate
 against the United States in proportion to the perceived
 provocation.   Given the present state of political play in
 Beijing, we believe it unlikely that any prospective change
 in US relations with Taiwan would lead to Deng's fall.
 Repair of Sino-US relations and of Deng's political standing,
 however, would take time, and at age 76 he may not have
 enough.
