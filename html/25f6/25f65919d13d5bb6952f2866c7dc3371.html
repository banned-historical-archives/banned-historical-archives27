 MOSCG,A CAUTIOUS ON FORD-GISCARD TALKS, HAILS NEW OPEC PRICE
 Initial brief Moscow reports on the 14-16 December Martinique
 summit meeting between President Ford and French President
 Giscard d'Estaing treated factually and circumspectly their
 agreements on measures in the energy field.  At the same time,
 Soviet commentator: hailed as "very fair" the new decisions at
 Vienna by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
 (OPEC) to unify the price of oil effective 1 January and
 increase oil duties for foreign monopolies.  Moscow's well-established
 aversion to Western  initiatives that would lead to unified
 groupings of oil-importing states, and Soviet support to the
 OPEC members in any "confrontation" that might ensue in negotiations
 between OPEC and Western blocs, have been reiterated in comment
 on the Vienna OPEC session.  Such comment has been aimed at the
 United States and its November initiatives to form an international
 energy agency.
 FORD-GISCARD      A 16 December TASS report on the communique
 COMMUNIQUE        published at the end of the U.S.-French summit
 meeting concentrated on the energy aspects of
 the document, noting only briefly that the two leaders also
 discussed a "wide range" of world problems including East-West
 relations, the Middle East and Southeast Asia situations, and
 economic and monetary-financial problems.  TASS acknowledged
 that the two leaders, "in an attempt to reach a compromise
 essential for resolving" U.S.-French differences on energy
 questions, agreed to hold a conference of oil-importing and
 oil-exporting countries "at the earliest possible date."
 Tha TASS accounts pointed out that the French-U.S. agreement
 calls for preliminary coordination within "existing international
 organizations" of energy conservation programs and the develop-
 ment of alternative energy sources, followed by "intensive"
 consultations to achieve a single position at the conference with
 oil exporters.
 "Profound differences" between France and the United States on
 .the energy issue had been stressed in Soviet reports and comment
 on U.S. moves in mid-November to create an international energy
 agency.  For example, a 17 November PRAVDA dispatch by Rusakov
 highlighted French opposition to the U.S.-proposed "bloc" to
 "fight the oil-producing countries" and noted disagreements also
 among other European and Asian countries.  Rusakov added that U.S.

 policy on the issue sought to "overcome the U.S. energy difficulties
 at the expense of oil-producing countries," thus retaining a U.S.
 "leading role in the capitalist world" under the "pretext of joint
 action."  Moscow media attributed to Secretary Kissinger the
 formulation of the basic propositions for the plan tc create
 "a united bloc of capitalist countries."  Subsequent Moscow comment
 alluding to the International Energy Agency--formed on 15 November--as
 the "Club of 16" described it as an "instrument of pressure" on
 oil-producing states and, without mentioning Secretary Kissinger,
 noted that "a number of American statesmen" have sought a "harder
 attitude" toward the Arab countries.
 Soviet antipathy toward any ",mitad front" of oil-importing nations
 was reaffirmed in an 18 December Melnikov PRAVDA commentary.
 According to the TASS summary of his remarks, Melnikov described
 the International Energy Agency as a bloc of "developed capitalist
 countries opposed to oil-producer countries," adding a veiled
 warning that the OPEC members "will not remain indifferent" to
 "confrontation" plans being worked out by "imperialist circles."
 In what seems implicit criticism of the new U.S.-French coordination
 agreement--his comment being timed immediately after the Martinique
 summit--Melnikov argued that the attempt "by certain circles of the
 West" to secure a solution to the energy issue from "obviously
 unilateral positions" is "more than disputable."
 Moscow's caution in treating the new U.S.-French agreement is
 consistent with its past indifference and even negative reaction
 toward earlier Western-led efforts to convene international
 conferences on the energy question.   For example, Moscow from
 the outset disparaged the U.S.-initiated Washington energy
 conference in February 1974 as well as smaller follow-up meetings
 called by the United States.  The sketchy first reports on. the
 U.S.-French communique provide no direct evidence of Soviet
 criticism or opposition to such a conference, but the thrust of
 comment on the OPEC price moves suggests that Moscow prefers to
 see bilateral oil agreements between OPEC and oil-importing
 countries, rather than conference confrontations between OPEC
 and an organized grouping of importing countries.
 OPEC VIENNA      Soviet commentator Timoshkin told Arab listeners
 PRICE MOVES      of Moscow radio on 14 December that the 13 December
 Vienna OPEC decisions unifying the oil price on
 1 January and raising the tax for foreign monopolies were "very
 fair," representing an OPEC effort to "weaken the negative effect"
 of the capitalist world's inflation upon the national economies
 of the oil-producing states.  T'imoshkin added that the unified

 oil price would broaden possibilities for "direct trade relations"
 between the OPEC and oil-importing countries and thereby heir
 greatly to "curb  he looting practices of the international oil
 monopolies."  Ile noted that the Vienna OPEC actions came against
 a background of an intensifying "provocative propaganda campaign"
 against Arab and other oil producers, "particularly in the
 United States," that sought to blame oil producers for capitalist
 economic difficulties.  Consistent with Moscow's traditional
 defense of higher oil prices, Timoshkin described the OPEC
 actions as a "just struggle for their legitimate rights" to
 achieve a "fair share" of income from their natural resources,
 ~.aken from the profits of "imperialist cartels which exist
 by plunder."
 TASS English reports on the OPEC actions on the 13th and 14th
 were much less doctrinaire, noting that the increased returns for
 OPEC producers "should be viewed as a measure to make good the
 damage"  .rc,m current inflation, to offset increased spending
 by OFFC countries on industrial goods and foodstuffs from
 Western nations, and to publicizr_ the "huge profits" by "oil
 tycoons" and thereby prevent them from "endlessly forcing up
 prices of oil products."
 MILITARY ACTION       Moscow has exploited, particularly for Middle
 AGAINST ARAB OIL      Eastern radio audiences, U.S. press speculation
 about possible Western military intervention in
 Arab oil-producing states as well as CENTO naval maneuvers in
 November in the Arabian Sea region.  Moscow's ostensibly "unofficial"
 Radio Peace and Progress on 3 December told Arab listeners of U.S.
 press discussions about a U.S. plan to "occupy oil regions of the
 Arab world by force of arms," going as far as specifying the Arab
 states targeted for such action and noting that U.S. military
 forces have undergone simulated exercises to prepare for desert-region
 warfare.  The radio added that while the Arab states viewed these
 developments with "great vigilance," they continued their "oil
 onslaught on the positions of the imperialist monopolies" to gain
 control of their oil resources.  A 28 November Moscow broadcast
 to Iranian listeners discussing mid-November CENTO naval movements
 in the Arabian Sea region said their purpose was "to prepare for
 the occupation of oil resources," and saw in this a U.S. plan to
 "intimidate the progressive Arab states" in the region, which in
 turn proved there were "aggressive designs" beyond intimida`-ion.
 Moscow's handling of such speculation for domestic audiences, however,
 has been much more restrained.  A 16 November Russian-language
 report, describing U.S. speculation on possible "desperate military
 action" against Arab oil fields, optimistically declared that

 PODGORNYY, RED STAR REGISTER DISSENT FROM DETENTE MOOD
 Discreet demurrals from the prevailing mood of optimism that
 has characterized Soviet official attitudes toward U.S.-Soviet
 relations have been registered by Podgornyy in a Dushanbe
 speech on 29 November, and by RED  STAR  in a major article on
 21 November.*  Podgornyy, speaking a few days after the
 Vladivostok summit, limited his acknowledgment of the results
 to a mere endorsement of the official party-government statement
 of approval and stressed instead the need for caution in
 assessing the international 'situation and the foreign policy
 problems that remain to be settled.   RED STAR, writing on the
 eve of the summit, whose agenda was widely understood to have
 included SALT as one of its subjects, paid barely a word of
 deference to detente and stressed instead the need to insure
 continued qualitative improvement of Soviet strategic weaponry.
 PODGORNYY SPEECH      Podgornyy's brief remark  on Vladivostok
 were limited tc two brief paragraphs which
 paraphrased passages from the official party-government statement
 of approval which had been issued the day before.  They were
 sandwiched between two longer passages which presented a darker
 picture of the international situation.   The first recounted the
 history of the emergence of the "peaceful coexistence" principle,
 stressing the alleged Dersistence of Western opposition to this
 concept, and ascribing the r-cent moderation of Western policy in
 this regard to the "strengti,,entng economic and defense Might of
 the Soviet Union" and the "vitality of its Leninist foreign policy."
 The second warned against overestimating the results of Vladivostok,
 stressing the continued activity of opponents in the West, counseling
 caution in assessing Western intentions, and noting issues affecting
 U.S.-Soviet relations that remain to be settled.
 There are several aspects of theses remarks that appear to contradict
 prevailing Soviet positions on foreign policy or at least to 'rifer
 an alternative perspective on critical points.
 +   First, Podgornyy stressed the united nature of detente; he
 treated  it  as  though it were still in its infancy, an experiment
 *   The full impact of Podgornyy's remarks  was  not reflected in
 summaries of the speech carried by TASS and Moscow radio; the full
 text of the speech as published in IZVESTIYA on 30 November has just
 become available in translation.

 still to be tested.   "It goes without saying," he said, "that
 we are not establishing cooperation with the capitalist
 countries at a stroke, or by any means on all questions."
 This, of course, is inconsistent with Soviet rhetoric
 of recent years, particularly the repeatedly stressed conviction
 that the favorable turn in U.S.-Soviet relations has reached the
 point where it can be made "irreversible."
 4-  Second, he seemed to implicitly criticize the deal under which
 the Soviet Union was reported to have agreed to raise quotas on
 Jewish emigration in exchange for the U.S. Administration's
 support for removing trade restrictions.  Although the criticism
 was veiled and formally addressed to "certain foreign individuals,"
 it seemed to carry an implicit rebuke to those in the Soviet
 Government who would contemplate such a deal.  Denouncing the
 Western pressures in this regard as "overt interference in the
 sphere of internal state policy," he concluded with the ringing
 declaration that "our internal affairs have never been and will
 never be a subject for political bargaining."
 This interpretation of Podgornyy's remarks assumes added
 plausibility in the light of the TASS statement of 18 December
 and the accompanying publication of Gromyko's letter to Secretary
 Kissinger which deny that any deal was made on this issue.   It
 seems safe to assume that these actions were preceded by extensive
 debate in the Politburo.   Thus Podgornyy's remarks would have been
 appropriately timed to affect the outcome of the debate in the
 Politburo.
 4-  't`hird, he entered a strong caveat on the question of the future
 prospects of detente.  He insisted that detente was a two-way
 street and that further progress would depend on the extent to
 which both sides observed the "traffic regulations."  In this
 connection, he drew attention to various trouble spcts--the Mideast
 crisis, the Cyprus situation--which he said were due to the "concern"
 of the enemies of detente.
 4-  Fi.nally, he used phraseology in introducing these cautionary
 notes which carried a polemical ring.   "It would be intolerably
 nearsighted," he said, "to fail to take into account" these
 various negative aspects of the international situation.  Such
 challenging phrases have long been regarded by Kremlinologists as
 tell-tale signs of internal controversy.
 What factors in the current political situation might have prompted
 Podgornyy to distance himself from Brezhnev on foreign policy can,

 of course, only be conjectured.  A plausible theory might
 be that rumors of Brezhnev's intention to resign in the near
 future, which have been reported in the West, have prompted
 renewed maneuvering in the Politburo.   In this light, Podgornyy's
 speech could be seen as an effort to position himself to
 arbitrate the succession.   Such a role would not be out of
 character for Podgornyy, since he has carefully kept his
 distance from Brezhnev on policy issues in recent years.   Both
 on internal economic policy and on foreign policy he has
 taken positions which are more traditionaliei- than Brezhnev's.
 Such a position would be likely to recommend itself to the Soviet
 leaders in a period of transition.
 RED STAR ARTICLE      Although lacking the polemical overtones of
 Podgornyy's speech, the RED STAR art..cle of
 21 November was even more jarringly out of tune with the prevailing
 need of the pre-summit publicity.  Written by two military
 professors, and presented under a headina usually reserved for
 major theoretical items, the article was wholly devoted to the
 theme of military preparedness.   It presented an argument which
 strongly resembles the views which the Soviets usually ascribe to
 the "military-industrial complex" in the West.
 Its main themes included the contentions that modern military
 technology has greatly increased the importance of the time
 factor in modern strategy, that this has led to increasingly
 sophisticated weapons, and that this in turn has speeded the
 process of obsolescence and renewal.  The conclusion derived from
 all this is that the Soviet Union must be prepared to keep pace
 in the qualitative arms race.  As the article puts it:   "All
 this calls for an increase in the amount of scientific and experimental
 design work and for the raising of the technical complexity of
 military-technical equipment."  In plain terms, more R&D and plenty
 of MIRVs.
 Although the article does not specifically mention MIRVs (nor any
 other specific weapon system), this seems a fair interpretation
 of the above statement.  Moreover, it is supported by the fact that
 the immediately preceding passage had pointed out that one of the
 main driving forces of the arms race was the "competition between
 defensive and offensive methods of armed warfare."  MIRVs were
 originally conceived as a means of combating  ABMs and are still
 rationalized in terms of their presumed effectiveness against
 military targets, such as reinforced concrete structures, and so on.

 These features of the article, plus its timing, suggest that it
 may have been '_ntended to register the military's interest on
 the eve of the summit in retaining a free hand for continued
 technical upgrading of the Soviet strategic forces.   ThE. fact
 that the conclusions were presented as being grounded in Soviet
 "military science"--the sphere of So,.iet military theory which

 CYPRUS
 MOSCOW EXPRESSES HOPE FOR SUCCESSFUL INTERCOMMUNAL TALKS
 With President Makarios' 7 December return to Cyprus following his
 stay abroad after the 15 July coup, limited Moscow comment has
 looked hopefully toward negotiations between the Greek and Turkish
 Cypriots while holding in reserve the Soviet proposal for an
 international conference on Cyprus.  At the same time,  comment
 has cautioned teat progress will be slow and difficult.   Moscow,
 which favored the prolonged intercommunal dialog conducted by
 Kliridhis and Denktash sine- 1968 as a proper method for seeking
 a solution to the Cyprus proolem,  has reported without comment
 their discussions this fall,  limited to humanitarian issues and
 suspended since 4 December.
 IZVESTIYA commentator Melor Sturua on 15 December, speaking on
 Moscow radio's weekly roundtable program for domestic listeners,
 viewed Makarios' return as "proof"  that Cyprus is already
 "becoming more stabilized."   He identified three criteria for
 "helping to find a correct and positive solution" to the Cyprus
 problem:  "stabilization of the constitutional order on Cyprus,
 withdrawal of all foreign troops,  and successful and fruitful
 talks between the Greek and Turkish communities."  TASS on tho
 12th had reported a statement issued by the Cyprus communist
 party, A{EL, on the archbishop's return, emphasizing that "a form
 of constitutional structure for Cyprus can be found at a
 conference table" by Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
 Moscow has, however, recognized that a negotiated political settle-
 ment will not be easy to achieve.   A 9 December TASS report pointed
 out that "there are still great difficulties and obstacles on the
 way to reestablishing constitutional law and order."  PRAVDA's
 Drobkov, in a foreign-language commentary on the 12th, saw signs of
 hope in Makarios' return and the "joint line" adopted by Nicosia
 and Athens, but observed that because of Cyprus' "enemies"--the
 "North Atlantic bloc" and "imperialist agents" on Cyprus--normalize
 tion would "not be easy" and a political settlement would entail a
 "tenacious struggle."
 SOVIET PROPOSAL,      Concurrent with Makarios' return, Moscow has
 NATO "SOLUTION"       not been pressing its 22 August proposal to
 discuss the Cyprus problem within the UN
 framework.  As recently as 28 November, Moscow had formally reiterated
 its call for an "international conference" on Cyprus in the Soviet-
 Zambian communique issued that day.   The Soviet-French communique on

 Br.ezhnev's talky,     Paris, issued on 7 December, the day of
 Makar.:i.os' retut     the island, advocated that a settlement
 be reached through unspecified "negotiations."  And the communique
 on Romanian Foreign Minister Macovescu's talks in Moscow, released
 on 13 December, said only that the sides supported Cyprus'
 independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity "so that the
 domestic problems of the Cyprus people" may be settled peacefully.
 Soviet delegate Malik did reiterate the call for a conference in the
 13 December Security Council debate, which dealt with the six-month
 extension of the UN peacekeeping forces' mandate and the General
 Assembly's 1 November Cyprus resolution.  According to TASS' account
 ol the session, Malik said that UN resolutions on Cyprus could be
 implemented by "convening an international conference on Cyprus on
 a widely representative basis."
 The idea of a NATO-sponsored solution has again been rejected by
 PRAVDA's Drobkov.  As reported by TASS on 17 December, Drobkov
 portrayed NATO "proposals" to mediate the Cyprus problem as
 carrying an implied promise to "adjust" the Cyprus conflict in
 Greece's favor "in return" for Athens' return to the NATO military
 ranks.   Reiterating a standard theme, Drobkov denied that NATO could
 solve the crisis, claiming that it was fully concerned with "imposing
 its will on Cyprus, and at the sane time also on Greece."  Moscow in
 its coverage of the recent NATO ministerial meetings in Brussels did
 not report Secretary Kissinger's remark at a news conference on the
 13th that he was "more hopeful than before that progress on the
 Cyprus crisis is possible" after his talks in Brussels with the
 Greek and Turkish foreign ministers.
 TURKISH, GREEK ROLES      While the major organs of the Soviet central
 press continue to criticize Turkey's role only
 implicitly, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on 6 November and SELSKAYA ZHIZN on
 5 December were a shade more outspoken in pointing to Turkish obstinacy
 toward a political settlement.  The former noted that while Greece
 endorsed the Soviet proposal to discuss the Cyprus situation at an
 international conference, "Turkey, fearing to remain in isolation,
 opposes this."  SELSKAYAZI-IIZN, commenting on a Turkish foreign
 ministry spokesman's statement that talks between the two communities
 would be interrupted if Makarios returned to the island, maintained
 that  "soberminded individuals, even in Turkey, are beginning to
 realize that the situation that has been created on the island cannot
 last forever."
 Moscow has continued to voice vehement opposition to partitioning
 of the island.  NEW TIMES observer Vladimir Shmarov, in a 24 November

 Moscow radio commentary, outlined Soviet concern in pointing out
 that if the "notorious Attila line" is not abandoned, "two
 administrations may take root, which will in turn lead to the
 annexation of one part of the island by Greece and the other part
 by Turkey."
 Soviet media have indicated cautious approval of the new Greek
 Government's policy vis-a-vis Cyprus.  PRAVDA on 3 December, in a
 report on the Athens talks between Karamanlis and Makarios, said
 that they confirm the resolve of Greece and Cyprus to find a
 solution "in a peaceful way."   In further approval of Karamanlis'
 policies, Moscow radio on the 10th identified as one of the
 "positive changes" being carried out by his government the "pledge
 to achieve a solution in Cyprus based on the preservation of its
 independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity."  And Sturua
 on the 15 December roundtable program, in an apparent allusion to
 Greece's traditional support of enosis--Cyprus' union with Greece--noted
 that Athens is now "taking a more realistic stand" on Cyprus.

 DRV ARMY ANNIVERSARY ANTICIPATED IN COMMENT, EVENTS IN HANOI
 Vietnamese  connnunist  media are devoting predictably voluminous
 and authoritative attention to the upcoming 30th anniversary of
 the North Vietnamese army (VPA).  There have been major articles
 by Chief of Staff Senior General Van Tien Dung and Colonel
 General Song 1-lao, Chief of the VPA Genera]. Political Department,
 which  have been carried by Hanoi. radio as well as by DRV news-
 papers and journals.   llanoi papers have also published a lengthy
 account of the history of the VPA and an article on the communist
 military forces in South Vietnam by a southern military commentator
 under the pseudonym "Cuu Long."  This is the first known article
 attributed to Cuu Long since April 1972, when in the midst of the
 communist spring offensive he wrote an article stressing the
 significant role of guerillas in supporting main force units.
 Only the Song I-lao article, discussed below, is available in full
 translation at this writing.   However, available reports indicate
 that Van Tien Dung's article deals with the critical problem of
 coordinating the requirements for domestic construction and defense.
 Recent North Vietnamese public events--some in connection with the
 22 December VPA anniversary--have prompted a series of appearances
 by North Vietnamese military leaders.   After having been out of
 sight since mid-August, Chief of Staff Van Tien Dung reappeared at
 a soccer game on 27 November.  Dung appeared subsequently on
 6 December, along with Defense Minister Senior General Vo Nguyen
 Giap and Colonel General Song I-lao, to receive a visiting PLAF
 delegation; and on 15 December he attended an army sports
 competition marking the forthcoming VPA anniversary.  Dung had
 appeared fairly regularly during the last half of 1973 and early
 1974, taking on some of Giap's traditional functions during the
 latter's extended absence from public view from July to September
 1973 and from October 1973 to May 1974.   Clap made no appearances in
 June or July, but has been regularly active since the end of August.
 The surfacing of some military leaders who do not regularly attend
 public functions revealed some previously unknown promotions.  Last
 April's official announcement that a series of promotions had been
 granted gave no comprehensive list; the information has been gleaned
 indirectly with the sporadic mentioning of various officers
 identified with a higher rank than previously.*  Among these latest

 revelations was the identification of army logistics chief Dinli
 Duc Thien as a lieutenant general when he appeared at the
 .1.5 December sports event.   A 14 December visit by the I'LAF
 delegation to the command of the People's Armed Public Security
 Force= prompted the appearance of a prev:ously unrevealed major
 general--Nguyen The Tung, who represented the police forces.
 DRV GENERAL STRESSES ARMY'S COMMITMENT TO REVOLUTIONARY GOALS
 The lengthy article by Col. Gen. Song Hao, Chief of the VPA General
 Political Department, was given broad dissemination befitting a formal
 anniversary treatise; it was broadcast by Hanoi radio in daily
 Installments from 8 through 14 December, publish'-id in the army paper
 QUAN DOI NHAN 1)AN on the 16th, and printed in the December issues of
 the army journal TAP CI-II QUAN D01 NIIAN DAN and the party journal
 HOC TAP.   The article discussed in conventional terms many subjects
 raised by Song Ilao in past articles--praising the army for its
 obedience to the party, its determination, discipline, and unity, its
 good relations with civilians, and its achievements in study and
 training.  At the same time, some of the points ma le by Song Ilao could
 be read as an argument for a greater North Vietnamese commitment to
 achieving victory in the South.
 In analyzing the experience of the resistance against the French,
 Song Hao indicated that both domestic construction and fighting can

 conducted the resistance while building the country."  Ile again
 focused on his priorities in outlining the army's revolutionary virtues,
 maintaining that the army "strongly opposed all vile move.  to incite it:
 to seek materi-1. interests" and vehemently advocating determination to
 achieve success:
 Our cadres and combatants have always advanced and have
 never retreated.  All phenomena of half-way revolution,
 irresoluteness in coping with the enemy, lack of
 revolutionary offensive spirit, lack of determination
 to overcome difficulties and hardships, and individualism
 are inconsistent with our army's revolutionary nature
 and traditions.
 Song llao loter returned to this same theme, reiterating that the
 Vietnamese army and people have "never retreated" before an enemy
 no matter how powerful he has been," and have "always tried by

 all means to advance and have resolutely struggled and achieved victory."
 Cle;.ir.l.y indicating his formula for success, he added:
 Engaging in revolution means launching offensives.
 Only when we launch offensives against the enemy
 can we defeat: it, build and develop our strength,
 protect the revolutionary gains, and defend the
 North.
 Song 1-Iao did not go on to indicate that an offensive to drascical?.y
 change the situation in the South is likely in the near future.  On
 the contrary, in his concluding passages he suggested that the army has
 many obstacles facing it before it can achieve its ultimate objectives.
 lie expressed confidence that the army would advance to "total victory"
 but noted that "our combat task. still faces hardships and fierce
 challenges" and "ou- undertaking to build our paople's army into a
 regular, modern army remains difficult."
 Song Ilao dwelt upon the army's tradition of fighting throughout
 Vietnam, in effect justifying commitment of North Vietnamese units
 in the South.  While couched in general. language which''predictably
 avoids any explicit mention of the VPA presence in South Vietnam,
 Song Iiao's support for their role was clear.   He asserted
 impassionatel.y that "our country is one" and "each inch of land is
 part of the flesh and blood of the Vietnamese country" and is a
 "sacred pert of the fatherland that every patriotic Vietnamese must
 strive to protect."  Repeatedly he pointed out that the armed forces
 have fought "on any battlefield, distant or near," have "rushed to
 any place the enemy has been," and "have walked thousands of miles to
 very distant areas."

 PRC - KOREA
 PEKING CONTINUES HARD LINE TOWARD U.S, TROOPS IN KOREA
 Recent Peking comment on the UN debate over the Korean question has
 further demonstrated the PRC's steadily sharpening criticism of the
 continued U.S.  troop  presence in South Korea.           Following the defeat,
 with a tie vote, of the North Korean-backed resolution demanding the
 withdrawal from South Korea of foreign troops under the UN flag, a
 12 December PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article attacked the U.S.
 position or, the question as "lies."  Commentator further labeled as
 "deceit" (wan chuan ship chi jen chili tan) the U.S. argument that its
 ti.?oops are in South Korea to defend the Korean Armistice Agreement,
 but are not there under UN auspices and are not guilty of any inter-
 ference in the South's affairs.  Referring to the U.S. backed proposal
 which was passed by the General Assembly's First Committee, Commentator
 c'iarged the U.S. had "perpetrated various tricks to railroad through .
 an indefensible resolution" which "covers up" crimes of U.S. aggression.
 and intervention in Korea, creates a "pretext" to prolong the stay
 of U.S. troops in the South, and "unduly" refers the question of the
 dissoluticn of the UN Command to the Security Council.*
 On two previous occasions in the past two ionths the Chinese have used
 the UN forum to accuse the United States of deception on the Korean
 question.   Chiao Kuan-hua, in a 2 October UN speech, used exactly the
 same language as Commentator (wan chuan shin chi jen chill tan) in denying
 the U.S. assertion that the UN Command cannot be wiL',drawn because of a
 threat from North Korea.   More recently, on 29 November Chinese UN
 representative Huang Hua called the U.S. contention that its troops
 were in South Korea to maintain peace a "glaring reversal of the truth."
 Commentator echoed other propaganda in demanding that the United States
 w-;_tlhdraw its troops, halt military assistance to the South, and end its
 "connivance" with the South's provocations against the North,
 but put no time frame on withdrawal.   A greater sense of urgency
 regarding U.S. withdrawal was voiced at a Peking banquet, on the
 occasion of the 25 October anniversary of the entry of the Chinese
 People's Volunteers into the Korean War, by Politburo member Chen Hsi-lien,
 who called for U.S.  troops "to pull out of South Korea without delay."
 *  A few days before the vote, a 6 December NCNA correspondent's report
 had blasted as "gangster's logic" the U.S. position that its troops
 would remain in South Korea regardless of the outcome of the UN vote
 because they were there under the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty.   The
 report dismissed the treaty as a "mere    scrap of paper," which had been
 signed "illegally."

 PRC - THAILAND
 PEKING FAILS THAI CP ANNIVERSARY, MAINTAINS BANGKOK CONTACTS
 Peking media's practice this year of giving increased attention to
 the Thai Communist Party (CPT), while at the same time according
 sustained coverage to relations between the PRC and the Thai
 Government, was demonstrated most recently on the 32d anniversary
 of the CPT.  Peking's report on 9 December of a 1 December CPT
 statement on its anniversary, and acknowledgment in August of the
 anniversary of the Thai insurrection, contrast with Peking's
 ignoring of both anniversaries in 1973.%
 NCNA's 9 December summary version of the CPT's 1 December state-
 ment on the Thai communists' 32d anniversary included a reference---
 omitted in NCNA pickups of other CPT statements earlier this year--
 to "drive away the U.S. imperialists" from Thailand; however, the
 NCNA report ignored several other more specific CPT references to
 U.S. misdeeds as well as all references to the Sanya government.
 Peking's selective reporting of the CPT statement also implicitly
 indicated   approval, for the first time, of political struggle in
 Thailand as well as armed struggle, presumably reflecting Peking's
 perception of the Sanya administration's weakness.  All references
 to political struggle had been dropped by Peking in its coverage
 of the August Thai insurrection anniversary editorial, originally
 carried by the Peking-supported clandestine radio, Voice of the
 People of Thailand.  NCNA's 9 December pickup of the CPT 1 December
 statement included the CPT claim that "our party would like to
 cooperate with political parties, organizations and personages who
 support and join the people.  .    ."
 The 14CNA report also carried Peking's first mention of the CPT's
 ten-point policy statement issued on the party anniversary in
 1972.  The statement had been issued on ti,,= 30th party anniversary
 in 1972, just after Peking had taken its first steps to improve
 PRC-Thai state relations by welcoming official Thai envoys to China.
 Peking only gradually began to reiterate its support for the CPT
 after Thanom's ouster in October 1973, at a moderate pace reflected
 in its failure to commemorate the anniversary last December.

 The NCNA repo.' 's retention of the CPT reference to "U.S.
 imperialism" actively operating in Thailand was the first such
 Peking media treatment of this issue since September 1973, when
 NCNA carried the CPT's message of congratulations on the
 10th CCP Congress.  Peking has continued to carry factual
 accounts of U.S. troop withdrawals from Thailand, and in
 January 1974 reported an anti rIA demonstration in Thailand
 which noted both U.S. CIA and military roles in Thailand.

 unanimous vote of the Thai National Assembly on 6 December to
 repeal a decree which banned trade between the two countries.
 It quoted the Thai foreign minister as saying that the two
 countries "will develop normal trade relations."  Peking has
 also given considerable coverage to  the visit to Thailand of
 a Chinese basketball team, with an 8 December NCNA report
 quoting Thailand's deputy foreign minister as envisaging that
 the development of relations "will lead to the establishment
 of diplomatic relations."  And a Peking broadcast in Thai on
 12 December even quoted the Thai Air Chief Marshal Thawi
 Chunlasap as making "an admirable statement" on the permanency
 of Thai-Chinese friendship.  Recent NCNA accounts have reported
 the struggle for better conditions by Thai peasants, but while
 noting their call for Thai government departments to take
 action, NCNA has carefully avoided reporting any call for the
 government's overthrow.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 PRAGUE PARTY DAILY CARRIES NEW DENUNCIATION OF DUBCEK
 A new vitriolic attack on deposed CPCZ First Secretary Alexander
 Dubcek, in an 11 December RUDE PRAVO editorial article, marked
 the latest episode in the continuing power struggle between
 moderates and hardliners in the Czechoslovak regime.  The article
 was written to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the party
 document issued by the December 1970 CPCZ plenum assessing the
 events. leading up to the August 1968 Soviet intervention.
 Describing Dubcek and his colleagues in language markedly contrasting
 with that usually employe-1 by CPCZ General Secretary Husak, the
 article further highlights the increased assertiveness of the
 Bilak-style hardliners in that it is the first such article to
 appear on the anniversary of the 1970 party document.  The article
 was preceded last month by an 8-22 November Prague radio series
 which leveled an unusually extensive attack on .liberal emigrees
 who had fled Czechoslovakia in the wake of he intervention.
 The December 1970 party document, entitled "Lessons From the Crisis
 Development in the Party and Society After the 13th Congress of  he
 CPCZ," roundly denounced Dubcek and declared for the first time
 that the Warsaw Pact intervention had been carried out at the
 request of unnamed CPCZ Central. Committee members.   It was not mad`
 public until mid-January 1971, and the month-long delay in its
 release was wic:ely believed to have been due to Moscow's insistence
 on inclusion of the thesis that the 1968 invasion was requested
 by the Czechoslovaks themselves.  Reflecting the continued
 sensitivity of the issue,  the current RUDE PRAVO article did not
 revive the thesis of the alleged invitation, instead praising in
 general terms "the timely assistance of our closest socialist
 allies. "*
 In strident terms, RUDE PRAVO recalled that Dubcek--now working in
 a forestry center in the Bratislava area--was put at the head of
 the party in January 1968 by "the rightwing opportunist and anti-
 socialist forces."  He and other "liquidators" of the party, such
 The more conservative Slovak CP daily, Bratislava PRAVDA, did

 noting that "the allies came not only on their own decision, but at
 the request of thousands of communists and citizens from all strara
 of our population."

 as Smrkovsky, Kriegel, and Spacek, it said, conjured up "socialism
 with a human face," unduly stressed national specific features,
 and "gravely violated the interests of the party and its inter-
 national traditions and principles."  In effect conceding the
 continued appeal of Dubcek and his associates, th, article added
 that they "are directly responsible, both morally and politically,
 for making many of our honest people waver."
 The article noted that while Dubcek at present "remains in
 unenviable isolation," his alleged anticommunism has not slackened
 but increased.  This fact, it declared, was borne out by "Dubcek's
 letter"--a letter of condolence to Smrkovsky's widow, published
 in the Rome weekly GIOL'?II-VIE NUOVE in March 1374.  RUDE PRAVO
 added that this letter, in which Dubcek defended his and Smrkovsky's
 leadership, was "a welcome windfall for the blackest and most
 inveterate anticommunist reaction."  While Dubcek was stripped of
 his party membership durng an "exchange of party cards" in 1970,
 the Husak regime has so far refrained from bringing him and other
 top 1968 leaders to public trial.
 The article included only a single reference to Husak, stressing
 instead the unfinished work of "cleansing" the party which begun in
 April 1969, the date on which Husak replaced Dubcek as party leader.
 Similarly, it included only one notable moderate feature--a state-
 ment of the regime's intent to continue with a "differentiated"
 approach toward those      have been expelled from the party.
 Internationally, RUDE PRAVO underscored the crucial importance of
 Prague's alliance with Moscow, blaming anti-Sovietism for
 Czechoslovakia's "bitter" experience in the recent past and equating
 the combating of anti-Sovietism with "the defense of socialism
 itself."

 MOSCOW URGES MILITANT STAND BY LIBERATION FORCES IN RHODESIA
 Recent Soviet commentaries on Rhodesia have urged the black
 Rhodesian liberation groups to adopt a tough, uncompromising
 position toward Ian ,smith's white minority government, with
 Moscow's calls for militancy continuing even after Smith's
 11 December announcement that a cease-fire in the guerrilla
 war had been negotiated.   The Soviet militant urgings came
 after Prime Minister Smith rejected the demand for immediate
 black majority rule voiced at an early December conference
 in Lusaka attended by leaders of three Rhodesian liberation
 groups and the presidents of Zambia, Tanzania and Botswana.
 I~Jhile urging militancy, Moscow radio commentaries to Africa
 have blurred the details of events by not distinguishing
 between the original Lusaka conference demand on 6 December for
 immediate majority rule and the later modification of this
 demand which was followed by Smith's cease-fire announcement.
 Moscow's first commentary on the Lusaka meeting came two days
 after Smith had rejectpO the conference's initial call for
 immediate majority rule as a precondition for the cessation of
 guerrilla activities.  A 9 December Moscow radio broadcast to
 Africa credited the "positive changes" in Mozambique and
 Angola with influencing other African liberation movements to
 "step up their fight," and hailed as a "major decision" the
 agreement by the banned Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU),
 Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), and the Front for the
 Liberation of Zimbabwe (FROLIZI) to unite under the African
 National. Council (ANC).  Moscow did not delineate the demands
 of the Lusaka participants, noting only that the "racists" in
 Salisbury had rejected the "constructive proposals" of the
 "African representatives" and had replied with an "ultimatum"
 that the Rhodesian Africans cease their fight "against the
 pres,nt discriminatory processes in the country."  Moscow
 recalled that the "Zimbabwe people" had made "no compromises
 with I_lie racists in the past" adding that "there is even less
 reason for them to compromise today."   Moscow's Radio Peace and
 Progress program for Africa on the 10th was similarly vague
 about the black nationalists' demands, noting only that the
 "concrete proposals" of the Lusaka conference were answered by
 "undisguised hatred and frustration among Rhodesian racists and
 their South African allies" who "intend to continue following
 the racist course" in the hope of frustrating the national

 liberation movement in Rhodesia.   IZVESTIYA commentator
 Pilyatskiy's 11 December report on the Lusaka meeting, carried
 by TASS, cited the demand for immediate majority rule and
 called for the "intensification of the national liberation
 struggle" in order to "eradicate" colonialism and racism in
 Africa.
 After Smith's 11 December announcement that agreement had been
 reached to end the guerrilla war immediately in return for the
 release of political prisoners and the holding of a constitutional
 convention, Moscow continued to obscure the meaning of the
 evolving situation.  Commenting that events were "unfolding
 with unrelenting speed," a Moscow radio broadcast to Africa  on
 the 12th depicted Smith's announcement as a "concession" motivated
 by Salisbury's fear of their "growing   solation on the world
 scene," while failing to report that the 6 December demand for
 immediate majority rule had been dropped by the Lusaka conferees.
 Radio Peace and Progress' commentary on the 13th accused Smith
 and South African Prime Minister Vorster of "coordinating"
 their efforts to preserve racism in Rhodesia, branding Smith's
 proposal to settle the Rhodesian issue a "neocolonialist maneuver"
 designed to "dampen African vigilance and support for the freedom
 struggle."  The commentary suggested that the  "only possible
 response to the racist intrigues is a greater armed liberation
 struggle."  A 15 December Moscow Domestic Service commentary
 further characterized Smith's actions as an attempt "to delude
 world public opinion" in order to continue receiving economic ana
 military aid from the "NATO patrons of the racists," and accused
 the "leading bourgeois mass media" of "collusion" with the Rhodesian
 authorities by describing Smith with "rapturous adjectives."

 MANSFIELD IN CHINA:  Peking treatment of visiting Senate Majority
 Leader Mansfield has exceeded some of the protocol norms established
 for such visits, including Senator Mansfield's previous trip in
 1972 with Senate Minority Leader Scott.   NCNA described Mansfield's
 meetings with Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua on the 10th and with
 Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping on the 12th as "friendly and frank."
 (Chiao had also met Mansfield and Scott in 1972, before lie was
 foreign minister.)  A 4 July meeting between Teng and Senator
 Jackson had been characterized only as 'frank" and many such dis-
 cussions, including the ones last month with Secretary Kissinger,
 are not characterized by NCNA at all.   (Chiao did term the Kissinger
 talks "candid" in a banquet speech.)  Other signs of approval
 accorded Mansfield included an evening dinner hosted by Teng--
 Jackson had been given a meal at noon--and an hour-long meeting
 with Chou En-lai, according to AFP.  Western press reports of
 Secretary Kissinger's recent meeting with Chou and of the Chou-
 Jackson meeting reported that they lasted for only about half an
 hour.
 ROPIANIAN RELATIONS WITH USSR, PRC:  The communique on Romanian
 Foreign Minister Macovescu's 9-13 December "official, friendly
 visit" to the USSR served to reaffirm Bucharest's close ties
 to Moscow, the Warsaw Pact and CEMA.  The two sides noted "with
 satisfaction" that Soviet-Romanian relations are "developing
 successfully" and along the lines laid down in the 1970 treaty
 of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance.   _'hey also
 pledged "to contribute in every possible way to the further
 strengthening of friendship and multilateral  links among the
 socialist countries", as well as "to the consolidation of unity
 and cohesion, and to the development of cooperation among the
 Warsaw Pact members and CEIdA members."  A similar pledge was
 contained in the communique on Kosygin's visit to Bucharest to
 sign the 1970 treaty.   SCINTEIA, as on that occasion, explained
 that its pledge applied to the development of relations with
 "all" socialist countries.    This latter intention was underscored
 by the 6-14 December visit of PRC Foreign Trade Minister Li Chiang
 to sign a 1975 trade protocol providing for a "significant rise in
 exchanges," according to AGERPRES on the 14th.  During a reception
 held by Ceausescu on the 12th, the two sides, as reported by
 Bucharest radio, "stressed with complete satisfaction.  .  . the
 close and traditional relations of friendship, militant solidarity
 and all-round cooperation of our parties, countries and people."

 18 DECEMBER 1974
 PORTUGUESE RADIO PROGRAMS:  Observations on the content of the
 evening "political hour" feature at 2105 GMT (2205 local) on
 Lisbon's Radio Club Portugues  have confirmed a pattern which
 ii:cludes 25-minute programs by three political parties plus
 the Movement of the Armed Forces (MFA).  The Monday night
 program, sponsored by the Portuguese Communist Party, was
 announced on 25 November.  The Tuesday program is sponsored by
 the center-left Popular Democratic Party, whose first program
 was aired on 3 December.  The Portuguese Socialist Party has
 the Thursday slot, with ti'e first program appc_aring on
 5 December.  The bFA is spoi,soring two programs a week, on
 Wedn asdays and Fri gays .   In introducing the first PLFA program
 on 29 November, the announcer said that the PIFA broadcast would
 be a "program of the armed forces general staff, produced by
 the public information service of the armed forces,"and
 characterized Radio Club Portugues as "the radio station of
 freedom."  The Saturday and Sunday programs are devoted to
 music and sports, respectively.  No right-of-center parties are
 represented on the feature, nor is there a program sponsored by
 the Portuguese Democratic Movement, which reportedly maintains
 a close relationship with the Communist Party.
 TURKISH-LANGUAGE CLANDESTINE RAUI():   The Turkish-language communist
 clandestine "Our Radio" announced on 14 December that effective the
 following day listeners could hLar the "Voice of the Turkish
 Communist Party" broadcasting on ch-Irrtwave on Sunday and Tuesday
 nights at 0810 GMT (1010 Turkish time).  The Voice of the Turkish
 Communist Party has been on the air since January 1971 with Thursday
 night programs on mediumwave for Turkish workers in Europe.  Tile
 new shortwave broadcasts make the programs available to listeners
 in Turkey.  The Voice of the Turkish Communist Party broadcasts
 are heard on frequencies used by Our Radio, which operates from
 East Germany and has been broadcasting since 1958.  Our Radio has
 only occasionally carried statements and documents attributed to
 the Turkish CP.  The new 40-minute shortwave program, monitored
 on 17 December, stated that "these broadcasts are eagerly awaited
 as much in our country" as by the Turkish workers abroad.  Claiming
 that interest in the broadcasts was constantly increasing, the
 announcer said that all letters from listeners expressed a common
 wish for increased broadcasts two or three times a week.   A
 comment:ary on this program called for basic party organizations
 to be cstablished "among the masses in struggle," particularly in
 factories, faculties, barracks, and  trade unions.  Another item
 urged communists to penetrate, organize, and lead strike actions.

 A talk on conditions in Turkey asserted that when Turkish
 workers returned home from abroad for the holidays they
 would find a "deplorable situation"--shortages of many goods,
 growing unemployment, black marketeering, steep cost of living
 increases and inflation, as well as martial law in some
 provinces.  As in Our Radio comment, the Turkish CP broadcast
 assailed the Justice Party and "reactionary politicians" such
 as JP leader Demirel for supporting actions by "fascist commandos"
 against "progressive elements."
