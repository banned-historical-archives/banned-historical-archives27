 AN ASSESSMENT OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM'S CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND TACTICS
 SUMMARY:  The recent flurry of Soviet diplomatic notes
 and letters to various governments and leaders of the
 free world raises questions about the aims and the
 course of international communism in the year ahead.
 Has the USSR adopted a harder and bolder line follow-
 ing the meeting of Communist Party representatives in
 Moscow last November?  Presented here is a careful,
 dispassionate analysis of the subject, based in part
 on information not previously available.

 AN ASSESSMENT OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM'S CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND TACTICS
 In recent months, the unusual degree of activity shown by the
 leaders of the international Communist movement has raised questions in the
 minds of observers concerning the course to be taken by the movement in the
 near future.  The measure of this activity is to be found in the formal diplo-
 matic notes and letters sent by the Soviet government to various governments
 and leaders of the free world, in the less formal but authoritative texts of
 interviews granted by Soviet leaders to correspondents and publishers of free-
 world newspapers, and even in the offhand and apparently spontaneous comments
 of Nikita Khrushchev at diplomatic cocktail parties.  These various statements,
 while full of claims, contentions, and even threats, have not always been con-
 sistent on such matters as the conditions under which the Soviet leaders would
 participate in a "summit conference."  For the non-Communist observer it is
 important to determine whether the marked activity of the Communist leadership
 of late, despite apparent confusions, falls into any definite pattern indica-
 ting the objectives to be sought and the tactics to be used by the internation-
 al Communist movement in the months ahead.
 Tentative conclusions on this problem can be drawn from a careful
 analysis of the circumstances, the proceedings, and the outcome of the meetr
 ings of the Communist Party representatives from around the world held in
 Moscow last November in connection with the observance of the 40th Anniver-
 sary of the Bolshevik Revolution.  Two basic documents issued from these
 meetings:   a Twelve-Party Declaration adopted at a meeting on November 14-
 16 of representatives of the Communist Parties in power -- Albania, Bulgaria,
 China, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Mongolia, North Korea, North
 Vietnam, Poland, Rumania, and the Soviet Union (the Yugoslav party did not
 join in this action); and a Peace Manifesto adopted at a meeting on November
 16-19 of the entire body of Communist parties represented in Moscow for the
 anniversary celebration.  Both these documents, but particularly the Twelve-
 Party Declaration, deserve close study in the context of what is known about
 the Moscow meetings which produced them and the subsequent activities of
 Communist Parties around the world.
 It is standard practice with the Communists, of course, to publish
 only partial and frequently misleading accounts of international Communist
 meetings.  For example, statements published after the founding meeting of
 the Cominform (September 19+7) concealed completely the severe criticism to
 which CP Italy and CP France had been subjected by the Soviet, Yugoslav, and
 other delegations.  The general direction prescribed by the Communist Party
 of the Soviet Union (CPSU) for the international Communist movement was,

 however, clear:  the Free World Communist parties were to organize maximum
 pressure and violent assaults on local political structures while, at that
 period, the Soviets were about to complete the subjugation of Eastern Europe
 and the Chinese Communists aimed at gaining total power in China.
 In the case of the Moscow meetings of November 1957, reliable in-
 formation indicates that the Communist leaders had agreed not to publish
 detailed accounts of the meetings.  However, points of general significance
 are clearly discernible in published statements by Communist leaders.  Based
 on these statements, the following provisional observations may be made.
 THE MEETINGS IN PERSPECTIVE
 The Declaration and Peace Manifesto issuing from the Moscow meetings
 reflect the intention of the CPSU and the bloc Communist parties to efface the
 after-effects of Khrushchev's secret (de-Stalinization) speech to the 20th
 CPSU Congress in February 1956, the events of June and October 1956 in Poland,
 and the uprising in Hungary.  The evident aim is to integrate more closely
 the activities of the entire international Communist movement in the Free
 World with Soviet and Bloc policies and interests.
 The need for countering a trend toward disintegration in the Commu-
 nist movement was evident well before the Moscow meetings of Party leaders
 last November.  There were reports from mid-1956 on indicating that several
 Communist parties repeatedly requested the Soviets to improve procedures and
 techniques for the coordination of the movement.  In March 1957 Communist
 circles rumored consistently that the CPSU would render a decision on inter-
 national problems.                           On 1 July 1957, prior to the announcement of the Malenkov-
 Molotov-Kaganovich purges, various Communist parties abroad were given, through
 the local Soviet ambassadors, the CPSU version of the purge.  This unusual pro-
 cedure suggested that the CPSU recognized the need for improved international
 coordination.
 It is not unlikely, however, that the Soviets postponed attacking
 this complex and thorny problem on an international scale until they were in
 a position to galvanize the international Communist leadership into action
 with announcements of their achievements in rocketry and space travel.  The
 November meetings were apparently staged to deal with the problems of coordi-
 nation, as well as the confusion and ideological dislocations created by the
 20th CPSU Congress and its aftermath, in an atmosphere benefiting from these
 scientific achievements and from the celebration of the i1-Oth Anniversary of
 the Bolshevik Revolution.
 The line of action laid down at the November meetings complements
 current Soviet Bloc efforts to achieve a shift in the balance of power.  The
 general direction prescribed for the international Communist movement in the
 documents of the November meetings is intended to contribute to and acceler-
 ate this shift through a variety of united front tactics.  Depending upon
 local circumstances, these tactics may include, for example, direct action
 or political maneuver, insurrection or parliamentary methods, united action
 or popular fronts.  In adjustment to a new set of circumstances, the movement's
 general directive line is aimed militantly at increasing disunity, conflict and

 -3-
 polarization within the Free World.  The tempo of this increase obviously will
 be contingent upon local factors, such as the strength and status of the local
 Communist party, as well as the aid received from the Bloc.  It is precisely
 to conceal the militant and aggressive character of the Communist action line
 that the full minutes of the November meetings have been kept secret.
 The November meetings did not, of course, solve all problems and
 disagreements with which the international Communist movement has had to cope
 since the 20th CPSU Congress.  However, they were first, and exceedingly impor-
 tant, steps toward achieving real unity and effective international coordination.
 Their effect has been to formalize the basic outlines of global Communist tac-
 tics and to create the foundation of a new structure for the international
 Communist movement within and outside the Communist bloc -- in brief, to weld
 together the Communist movement in the spirit, although not in the form, of
 the prewar Third (Communist) International, or Comintern.
 Available data on the mechanics and organization of the meetings
 suggest, first, that the problems of international Communism received a thor-
 ough airing, and secondly, that the CPSU had distributed key roles to reliable
 delegations and leaders in order to maintain its own control and keep the
 meetings on the desired track.
 The preparatory stage took place in Moscow.  Prior to the formal
 sessions a "comprehensive exchange of opinions within and among delegations"
 was held for about one week.  Communist accounts also refer to "commissions
 established by Communist and Workers' Parties" in connection with the meetings.
 According to Communist practice, these "commissions" may have concerned them-
 selves with the drafting of the documents published.  They may also have dealt
 with more specific problems of doctrine and organization.
 For example, it is reliably reported that a conference of all Latin
 American. delegates was held under the chairmanship of the Soviet specialist
 for Latin American affairs of the CPSU, and attended by Chinese Communist
 delegates.  The conference permitted the representatives of significant Commu-
 nist parties In the area to discuss their problems.  Those selected to speak
 were delegates from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Cuba, and Guatemala,
 the latter also representing the Communist movement in Mexico and the Caribbean.
 This conference well illustrates the thoroughness with which Commu-
 nist area problems were discussed.  The Soviet chairman laid before the meeting
 a specific action program for the Latin American Communist parties which was
 accepted.  It included requests for:  (a) increased efforts to fan and exploit
 anti-U.S. sentiment; (b) revival of the Communist-controlled peace movement
 through a Latin American peace conference to be held in Argentina in 1958;
 (c) renewed efforts to attack the Organization of American States through a
 Communist-controlled conference in defense of culture to coincide with the
 next OAS conference; (d) support for the Communist movement in Cuba through
 organizing a week of solidarity with the people of Cuba; and (e) promotion of
 the Soviet economic offensive in the region through organizing a Communist-
 controlled conference on the regional economy.  At the same time, the

 Confederation of Workers of Latin America (CTRL) came in for some criticism,
 and ways and means of strengthening or reorganizing the CTAL were discussed.
 The chairman of this meeting also requested that the Latin American
 Communist parties improve and intensify the coordination of their activities.
 Specifically, he requested that a Northern Conference be held to include Commu-
 nist parties from Canada to Panama.  CP Mexico and CP Cuba were charged with the
 organization of this secret regional conference which, it was believed, could
 be held in Canada.  A secret regional conference of Communist parties in southern
 Latin America had been held previously in Brazil.
 As the Latin American conference, among others, illustrates, the pre-
 paratory work for the plenary meeting of Party representatives was under the
 control of the CPSU and the Bloc parties, which in this fashion assumed policy-
 making powers.  According to the account of Friedrich Ebert, politburo member
 of the East German Communist Party (SED), the "sister parties from the capital-
 ist countries" (i.e., from the Free World), were only "consulted" at this stage,
 even though these discussions centered around the drafting of the Twelve-Party
 Declaration, which contains a general directive for the Communist parties in
 the Free World.
 The meeting of the twelve Communist parties in power was opened by
 Khrushchev.  Mao Tse-tung was the first speaker on the draft of the Declaration,
 which had been prepared jointly by the CPSU and CP China.  Walter Ulbricht
 closed the debate.  The Declaration was adopted unanimously, although Gomulka,
 and possibly Kadar, may have had reservations ca language concerning the leading
 role of the Soviet Union.  Yugoslavia did not attend this meeting.  The twelve-
 party meeting represented in effect the session of a small but powerful policy-
 making executive -- an international Politburo or Presidium.
 The meeting of Communist representatives from sixty-five countries
 was a plenary session on the order of an international Central Committee.  It
 met "a few hours after" the conclusion of the twelve-party meeting, "in the
 same place."  It was again Khrushchev who opened the meeting with a speech
 which emphasized that "consolidation and preservation of peace (is) a prin-
 cipal task of the present time."  Suslov welcomed the meeting briefly.
 Allotments of speaking time were reduced to twenty minutes, but not all the
 delegates were permitted to speak, while others, such as the French and
 Italian delegates made lengthy speeches.  Mao Tse-tung talked for two to
 three hours, apparently about the internal problems of China.
 The meeting centered about the draft of the Peace Manifesto which
 according to Ebert had been drawn up "upon the initiative of the CPSU and the
 Polish Workers' Party," though Gomulka himself, in a 28 November speech to the
 Warsaw Aktiv, claimed exclusive credit for the initiative.
 The meeting of representatives of sixty-five countries also discussed
 the Declaration "decided upon by the representatives of sister parties of the
 socialist countries."  Again, there are no indications that it was brought to
 a formal vote, but it may be presumed that at least a majority of the Communist
 parties of the Free World represented there accepted the Declaration.

 A bulky written report by Suslov had been circulated prior to the
 meeting in order to speed up the discussion, and may have been considered by
 the earlier twelve party meeting.  This report must obviously have been dis-
 cussed at the larger meeting also.                         Available references suggest that it dealt,
 among other topics, with an assessment of the strength of the Communist movement
 in the Free World.  The report appears to have contained some frank admissions
 of existing weaknesses and damages sustained.  Judging from Ebert's account,
 the latter included admissions of "some damages at individual points of the
 Communist movement" as a result of the Korean War, the events in Egypt, and
 the Hungarian revolt.  This admission points to Europe, since the report claimed
 that "in Asia and Africa, however, and also in some Latin American countries,
 some of the sister parties have considerably grown."
 The difficult situation of non-Bloc Communist parties, which was
 referred to in the Suslov report, was apparently elaborated upon in speeches
 made by representatives of those parties.  Ebert stated, "their reports on their
 parties' struggle show the full impact of the difficult stand they have Lfacin 7
 the imperialist rulers."  Ebert referred particularly to needy Communist parties
 in Latin America and the Near and Middle East, and the small European Communist
 parties were also considered by Moscow.  The result appears to have been an
 acknowledgement of the needs of the weak Communist parties of the Free World.
 Ebert postulated:  "It appears to be a matter of greatest urgency to devote
 more attention to the sister parties which are working under such difficult
 circumstances and above all to grant them more moral and political help within
 the framework of the cooperation of the Communist and workers' parties of all
 the world."  The implementation of this policy is bound to increase security
 problems in many countries in the Free World where Communist parties are out-
 lawed or have lost ground.
 One of the most important items on the agenda, a subject extensively
 discussed, was the problem of the organizational integration of the Communist
 movement under the leadership of the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc parties.
 The position taken on this subject, and its implication for the CPSU and the
 Communist movement as a whole, are worth noting in detail.
 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MEETINGS FOR THE CPSU
 The pattern for the integration of the Communist movement under CPSU
 control was defined as early as 1920 in Article 14 of the "Conditions of
 Admission to the Comintern," which stated, "Each Party desirous of affiliating
 with the Communist International should be obliged to render every possible
 assistance to the Soviet Republics, in their struggle against counter-
 revolutionary forces."  The Moscow Declaration of the twelve parties provides
 a modernized version of this position, taking into account the enlarged area
 now under Communist control:
 "At bedrock of the relations between the countries of
 the world socialist system and all the Communist and
 workers' parties lie the principles of Marxism-Leninism,
 the principles of proletarian internationalism which
 have been tested by life.  Truljr the_vitalinterests

 support of the Soviet Union and all the Socialist coun-
 tries, who, pursuing a policy of Ereserving peace
 throughout the world  are the mainst   of peace and
 social Progress.?   Underlining supplied
 Within the bloc of Communist-controlled countries, the Soviet Union
 continued to be singled out for the leading position.  The Twelve-Party Decla-
 ration referes to "the indivisible camp of Socialist countries headed by the
 Soviet Union."  There are some indications that the Polish party leader,
 Wladislaw Gomulka, who has had an aversion for using the term "the Socialist
 camp led. . . " or "headed by the Soviet Union," may have objected to this
 language of the Declaration.  However, Friedrich Ebert, in his report on the
 twelve party meeting, related that Mao Tse-tung defended the assigtzment of
 the leading position to the Soviet Union and its party, on the grounds that
 the Soviet Union was powerful, could protect the other Communist countries,
 and had, since Stalin's death, improved its working methods.  Mao is reported
 to have said, "From all this results the leading role of the CPSU in the com-
 munity of the Communist and Workers' Parties and the leading role of the Soviet
 Union at the head of the states of the Socialist camp."
 Aside from its implications for the discipline and effectiveness of
 the international Communist movement, the adoption of this position seems
 intended to have the effect of strengthening the position of the CPSU within
 the Soviet Union.  Khrushchev's aim has been to replace the one-man dictator-
 ship of Stalin by the dictatorship of the Communist Party, which is also the
 basis of his personal strength.  The propagandistic treatment of the November
 meetings in the press and radio of the Soviet Union indicates that a stren-
 uous effort is being made to "sell" the CPSU and to strengthen its authority
 internally on the grounds of the increased international stature and prestige
 gained at the November meetings.
 At the meeting of the Moscow Party Aktiv (leading Party functionaries)
 on 26 November the CPSU Presidium member Furtseva, stressed t  point
 onded tleast
 five times.  As reported in Evening Moscow of November 27, she so
 Soviet leadership of the world movement "is very important to emphasize because
 revisionists in certain foreign Communist parties applied much effort to dis-
 credit the successes of the Soviet Union, undermine the authority of our
 party. . . This is why the position put on paper in the Declaration about the
 leading role of the Soviet Union in the family of Socialist countries, about
 the need to defend and support the Soviet Union as the first and most powerful
 Socialist power, is so important for further strengthening of the whole Commu-
 nist movement."
 The purported increase in prestige which resulted from the November
 meetings was likewise publicized by a number of other leading Soviet figures.
 The Soviet writer Korneychuk spoke in this vein at the 2 December plenum of
 the Central. Committee, CP Ukraine.  At the same meeting Soviet Marshal Chuikov
 stressed that "Soldiers, non-commissioned officers, officers and generals of
 the Okrug are studying the Declaration and Manifesto with a feeling of great
 pride in the dear Communist Party. . . .

 The internationalization of CPSU internal propaganda for the purpose
 of raising the prestige and authority of the Party is only one aspect of the
 "leading role" of the Soviet state and the CPSU in international Communist
 affairs.   The other is the commitment inherent in the claim to leadership, i.e.,
 to guide, assist, and strengthen Communist parties abroad.  The CPSU is now
 irrevocably committed to undertake actions which are bound to conflict with the
 posture of "peaceful coexistence" and non-interference in the internal affairs
 of the Free World countries.
 SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST MOVEMENT
 As previously noted, the November meetings represented only the
 first stage in the organizational integration of the movement,  The Declara-
 tion stated tersely, "After exchanging views, the participants in the meeting
 arrived at the conclusion that in present conditions it is expedient besides
 bilateral meetings of leading personnel and exchange of information, to hold,
 as the need arises, more representatives' conferences of Communist and workers'
 parties to discuss current problems, share experience, study each others' views
 and attitudes, and concert 5.e., coordinati action in the joint struggle for
 the common goals -- peace, democracy and socialism."  From the documents issued
 by the meetings and. from Gomulka's speech of 28 November to the Warsaw Aktiv
 and Ebert's report to the SED, only a few tentative conclusions can be reached
 at this time concerning the organizational principles and procedures laid down
 at the meetings.  Among the more important are:
 1.   Agreement in principle has been reached to the effect that the CPSU, as
 head of the international Communist movement, will give due consideration
 to the views of Communist parties, especially of those in power.  Both
 Mao and Gomulka expressed their satisfaction that the CPSU leadership would
 behave properly.
 2.   For the time being, the CPSU is willing to be correct in its dealings with
 foreign Communist parties and to foster the impression that "collective
 leadership" prevails in international affairs.  Furtseva, in her report to
 the Moscow Party Aktiv, emphasized that the documents issued by the meetings
 had been "collectively worked out."
 Instead of creating a "central management" (i.e. another Comintern) for the
 international Communist Movement, a coordination procedure was adopted.
 The main vehicle for coordination will be "conferences of a large number or
 even of all Communist and workers' parties."  According to reliable data
 these meetings will apparently be of two kinds:
 a.  Diternational  or  lenary) meetin&s of all (or a great majority) of
 Communist parties, on the model of the meeting of Communist party
 representatives from sixty-five countries, which would be able to pass
 decisions binding for all.  Such meetings are scheduled to be held at
 least once a year.  The CPSU will convoke these meetings.
 b.  Regional meetings of Communist parties with common problems.  Such
 meetings would apparently not have policy-making Powers and would deal
 only with "practical problems" on an informal, ad hoc basis.  Ulbricht,

 -8-
 at the November meetings, emphasized the need for regional consulta-
 tion and coordination of the anti-NATO campaign within the Bloc.  Prior
 to the November meetings indications pointed to increasing regional
 consultations on the NATO problem between CP France andother European
 Communist Parties.  Regional consultation meetings between Scandinavian
 Communist parties were held twice in 1957.  In the future such regional
 meetings should increase on the basis of need.
 Ii.     This coordination procedure complements but does not supersede bilateral
 relations and meetings.  The CPSU, therefore, can, as before, coordinate
 directly with those Communist parties which are more subservient or de-
 pendent than others.
 5.      Some constitutional and procedural terms apparently agreed upon in con-
 nection with the international (plenary) meetings, would be designed to
 provide guarantees for protecting the authority of Communist parties.  The
 following points emerged from Gomulka's 28 November address:  (a) "As a
 rule, such conferences must be participated in by Party leaders" (thus
 preventig the CPSU from manipulating secondary leaders in order to put
 pressure on the top).  (b) "The questions to be discussed must be known
 in advance to all its participants" (ensuring that national CP leaders
 would be able to anticipate and reply to criticism and other pressure).
 (c) "The problems existing in the internal policy of each party. . .
 cannot be decided by interparty conferences" (although this restriction
 is not to apply to the internal problems common to all parties if they
 can reach the same views on these problems).
 These affirmations suggest that Communist parties will accept plenary
 conference decisions as binding only with their consent.  The Declaration
 itself has already been formally accepted by Central Committees and party
 Aktivs in. the Bloc.  Outside the Bloc the Declaration has been accepted
 by CP France and CP Italy, among others.  The significance of these pro-
 cedural safeguards remains to be tested by practice, however.
 6.  The principle of subordinating the interests of Communist parties in capi-
 talist countries to the anti-colonial struggle was also discussed, as
 illustrated by the debate on the Algerian Question.  The French represent-
 ative, Maurice Duclos, defended, with little success, the CP France position
 that the rebellion in Algeria was counterproductive. All Yata, Secretary
 General of the Moroccan CP, speaking in behalf of all Arab CPs, objected.
 The Syrian delegate appears to have recommended strongly that the interests
 of the Communist parties in imperialist home countries, and in France in
 particular, be strictly subordinated to the interests of the struggle against
 colonialism.  This position was supported by the Dutch delegation.  In sub-
 sequent meetings with CP Morocco, the French CP apparently accepted All Yata's
 position and can be expected to render more aid to the Communist-supported
 insurgents.
 Among the other organizational and procedural questions discussed were
 the problem of speeding up and improving content of propaganda about the Bloc in
 the Free World in order to increase the appeal of the Communist system, and the
 right of the international body to criticize member parties publicly.  It is

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-00915R000800230048-6
 likely that the question of organizing illegal CP apparats for the eventual
 overthrow of governments came up.  There is also good. reason to assume that
 the CPSU discussed its subsidization of foreign Communist Parties.  According
 to standard practice some delegates returned with secret funds, as usual in
 small U.S. bills.  There are also firm indications that even small and politi-
 cally insignificant Communist parties were given secret communication channels
 with the Communist parties of the Soviet Union and China, and made arrangements
 for the training of their leaders in those two countries.
 As to the establishment of a permanent headquarters and the publica-
 tion of an official organ for the movement, the action taken at the meetings
 is not yet fully known.  Thus far only the issuance of a "theoretical journal"
 for the Communist and workers' parties has been announced as agreed upon.
 Contributions to the journal will be submitted on a voluntary basis.  As a
 preliminary step to issuing the journal a press agency may be set up, proba-
 bly in Prague.
 Whether there will be a permanent international headquarters organ-
 ization is not clearly discernible at this moment.  A more permanent organ-
 ization is bound to emerge from the pattern of plenary and regional meetings,
 if for no other reason than to conduct business between sessions.  According
 to some reliable sources the CPSU objected to the creation of an international
 headquarters organization because it desired to remain the sole organizational
 center.  If so, the Foreign Section -- or, as it is sometimes called, the
 International Department -- of the Central Committee of the CPSU may assume
 increasing significance.
 The emergence of future regional coordination centers acting on
 behalf of the CPSU can be anticipated, although evidence is not yet firm.
 It stands to reason that certain Communist parties will assume a more formal
 and dominant position in regional affairs because of their strength and ex-
 perience and, in certain areas, because of their legal status.  (A legal CP
 could better control communications than could an illegal CP.)
 The Communist Party of China is sure to be one such regional coordi-
 nation center.  It is known to maintain training courses for Communists from
 South Asia and Latin America.  The Communist parties of East German.  and
 Czechoslovakia will be similarly used by the Soviets.  Outside the Bloc it
 would be advisable to observe closely CP France (for its activities in Western
 Europe), CP Italy (for its activities in the Middle East), CP Finland (in
 Scandinavia), CP Mexico, Cuba, and Brazil (in Latin America), CP Indonesia,
 and obviously, CP Syria.
 A most important trend, however, in the regional pattern will be the
 further development of contacts between Communist parties in "capitalist" and
 "colonial and semi-dependent" countries.  Some Bloc Communist Parties (for
 example, those of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Soviet Armenia)
 have shown great interest in international problems and may channel their support
 through Communist parties outside the bloc.  As for the CPSU, its increased
 activity in the field of international coordination has become apparent.  A large
 delegation composed of CPSU propaganda specialists was sent to Italy, and a top
 Soviet trade union organizer was dispatched to Cairo in January 1958.

 TACTICAL PROGRAM FOR FREE WORLD PENETRATION
 In line with previous estimates by the Soviets, the Declaration re-
 flects the view that opportunities exist particularly in "colonial and dependent"
 countries (i.e., in the underdeveloped areas), whereas "relatively good economic
 activity" in a number of "capitalist countries" (i.e., industrialized areas)
 reduces the effectiveness of Communist leverage there for the time being.
 In order to increase the opportunities the Declaration puts in the
 center of Communist tactics the exploitation of a threat which, it alleges,
 derives from "the presence of military danger created by imperialism, and
 primarily by the imperialism of the United States of America, which has now
 become the center of international reaction."  By fanning war hysteria and anti-
 Americanism the Communist movement T,,ri_11 seek to mount increasing political and
 other pressures on the local governments and political structures.  The exploi-
 tation of this issue could, in the Communist estimate, effect a change in the
 balance of power in the country in which the party is operating, and therefore,
 internationally.
 The operational method selected for this purpose is the promotion
 of united front on the broadest possible basis.  "The Peace Manifesto clearly
 defines the position of Communist and workers' parties, which consists of
 offering support to every step taken by a stater a -party, an organization,
 a movement, or an individual for the  enervation of peace and against war.
 for peaceful coexistence, for the establishment of collective security in
 Europe and Asia, for reduction of armaments, and for banning the use of
 atomic weapons and the carrying out of atomic tests."  This position permits
 and demands manipulation not only of "left" political groups but also, and
 in some areas preponderantly, of "right" and nationalist forces.
 This tactic of building up pressure in the Free World is, of course,
 not a new one.  In the postwar period such attempts were intensified, partic-
 ularly in periods when the Soviet expansion drive was frustrated.  The Comin-
 form-endorsed tactic of direct assault was adopted following the loss of
 goodwill which the Soviet Union and Communist parties had accumulated during
 World War II in many countries.  When the aggression in Korea was halted, the
 Cominform tactic of direct assault was transformed into the tactic of the United
 National Front which closely corresponded to the current line, inasmuch as it
 was also based on marshalling all anti-American forces on a minimum platform.
 The current action line stems mainly from the frustrations suffered by the
 Bloc as a result of internal pressures developing after the 20th Congress and
 in the wake of the Hungarian revolt.
 The fact that this action line is being re-emphasized indicates that
 internal pressures are still operating in the Bloc.  The emphasis of the Decla-
 ration on the need for strict conformism with orthodox Communism and on the
 priority of the need for combatting revisionism strengthens this impression.
 Not for internal reasons alone, however, does the Soviet Union resort
 to this artifice of the "war threat" -- itself a paradox in a period when the
 "world system of socialism" proclaims superiority.  This device also permits
 the Bloc to provoke the U.S. and its allies into positions which can then be
 "exposed" as proof of the thesis.  For example, the Bloc can place the onus on

 Approved For Release 000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-00915R000809&30048-6
 the U.S. and its allies for failure to negotiate on Soviet terms; it can maintain
 a climate of political pressure on Free World nations, and especially on under-
 developed countries to alienate them further from the more developed and stronger
 Free World countries.  It can also make use even of the paradox implicit in the
 "war threat" device, by alternately emphasizing the war threat and the peaceful
 posture of the Soviet Union and the bloc.
 As an artifice, the "war threat" issue is in constant need of arti-
 ficial stimulation.  It is probable that the Communist leaders assembled in
 November were exposed to fabricated or distorted evidence of alleged "imper-
 ialist plots."  Since the events in Hungary in 1956, Bloc and Communist media
 in the Free World have used this tactic in order to keep their followers prop-
 erly agitated about the alleged "threat of war."
 As an operative directive, the war threat as the central issue for
 the United Front tactic is a signal for intensified disruptive action in the
 Free World.  This signal appeared previously in the August 1957 (#12) issue
 of Korrttmunist in an article by Ponomarev, and was apparent in the "Theses"
 issued in September by the Central Committee of the CPSU on the 40th Anniver-
 sary of the October Revolution.
 For "colonial and dependent" countries the Declaration prescribes
 a united anti-imperialist and anti-feudal front exploiting peasant unrest and
 the grievances of the middle class, as well as aspirations of "patriotic demo-
 cratic forces."  That the Declaration calls for increasing pressure emerges
 from its position on neutralist governments of underdeveloped countries ---
 the "zone of peace."  It defines as "the peace-loving countries of Asia and
 Africa" those"taking an anti-imperialist stand and forming together with the
 Socialist countries, a broad peace zone."  In this definition there is no
 longer, as there had been in the Khrushchev statement to the 20th CPSU Congress,
 any reference to "peace-loving European states."  More important, the "anti-
 imperialist stand" is emphasized as the chief criterion.  "Non-participation
 in blocs" is no longer mentioned as a chief characteristic of a neutralist
 country.  This language suggests that the Soviet Union now requires a closer
 alignment on the part of neutralist governments prior to considering them as
 useful adjuncts to its foreign policy aims.  Local Communist parties may
 therefore exert greater pressure on their governments to force their align-
 ment, or to bring them down.
 Pressure on the more developed capitalist countries can also be
 expected to mount.  This is indicated in the Declaration by the call for
 attacks on the "big monopoly" groups -- the traditional signal for intensi-
 fication of infiltration and unrest in labor and other fields.
 For those "capitalist" countries which are closely allied with the
 U.S., the Declaration also prescribes the foundation of a broad united front,
 based on unity of the working class (i.e., united action with Socialists) in
 order eventually to "overthrow the rule of the monopolies who betray national
 interests."  The Democratic Socialists, particularly in the Far East, remain
 a key target for the united front attack.

 The 40th Anniversary Theses flatly declared that without a Communist-
 Socialist united front "the working class cannot win power."  The Declaration,
 however, is not so strongly worded and emphasizes the incompatibility of (Demo-
 cratic) Socialist and Communist doctrine.  It is entirely possible that Khrushchev
 and the CPSU considered that opportunities exist for a "united front from above,"
 i.e., agreement with Socialist leadership, whereas leaders of Communist parties
 abroad, especially those from Europe, pointed to the practical difficulties
 involved.  The Declaration suggests that the tactic of the "united front from
 below" (i.e., infiltration and splitting of the rank and file from the Socialist
 leaders) has been agreed upon as the most practical one, especially in Western
 Europe.
 The Declaration also makes perfectly clear --- clearer, perhaps,
 than the 20th CPSU Congress --- that the purpose of the united front tactic
 is the gaining of state power.  Reviving Dimitrov's formulae of the 7th (Comin-
 tern) World Congress, it permits a variety of "transitional forms" to this end,
 i.e., a "popular front" based on "a united working class" (unity with the
 Socialists), or "other workable forms of agreement and political cooperation
 between the different parties and public organizations."  The latter formula
 obviously pertains to situations such as in Egypt, Syria, Indonesia or any other
 country where political fermentation is spearheaded by nationalist ("anti-
 imperialist") forces.  It is a formula which permits Communist parties in the
 Bloc or the Free World, as well as the Soviet espionage services engaging in
 covert political action operations, to suggest and make deals with any indi-
 vidual or opposition group which could weaken a government unfriendly to or
 insufficiently committed to the Soviet Union.
 The Declaration restricts the "parliamentary road to Socialism"
 to "a number of capitalist countries," and postulates that a Communist
 majority in a parliament must be employed so as to"smash the resistance of
 the reactionary forces and create the necessary conditions for peaceful
 realization of the Socialist revolution."  In case of resistance to this
 scheme, the Declaration warns, "the possibility of non-peaceful transition
 to Socialism should be borne in mind."  The intensification of the united
 front pressures in the Free World will, of course, vary from country to
 country.
 Generally, however, Communist parties in Free World countries will,
 for the time being, pose as "defenders of peace and constitution," as "pa-
 triots" interested only in reforms, and as nationalists who are more nation-
 alistic than non-Communist nationalists.  Under such cover Communist parties
 can be expected to build up their potential for subversion and disruption.
 Undoubtedly one of the reasons the proceedings of the November
 meetings have not been made public is an operational one.  The meetings
 evidently succeeded in establishing a preliminary program and a procedure
 for the tactical integration of the Communist movement.  The programmatic
 statement issued in the Declaration shows that the CPSU considers that oppor-
 tunities for increasingly aggressive action have improved since last year and
 that, given increased discipline and unity, these opportunities can be ex-
 ploited.  Publication of the proceedings would be certain to reveal that
 international Communism, in concert with the Bloc, has been called upon to mount

 a political offensive, and would expose the Peace Manifesto signed by the Com-
 munist parties from 65 countries as propaganda.  The true significance of the
 Peace Manifesto lies in the simple fact that Communist parties have been in-
 structed to act more independently of the international Communist front group,
 the World Peace Council, and that the latter organization, criticized at the
 meetings, is in for overhauling.  The current flurry of Soviet notes and letters
 illustrates the intensification of the "peace" campaign which can be expected
 from all Communist parties.
 The November meetings of Communist leaders in Moscow perpetuated
 and generalized the hardened and bolder line of the CPSU and Soviet foreign
 policy which has been characteristic of the period following Khrushchev's
 victory in the June Plenum of the Central Committee.  They resulted in a first
 step toward increased organizational unity within the international Communist
 movement.
 Various intra-bloc conferences, held after the November meetings, in
 the field of ideology, science, and particularly, long-range economic planning
 indicate the determination with which the CPSU pursues its objective of in-
 creasing cohesion in the Bloc.
 Whether the current tactical line of the world Communist movement
 will be maintained depends, of course, on its success, particularly on the
 ability of the Soviet Party and government leaders to dramatize convincingly
 their claims for the total superiority of the Soviet system on the basis of
 partial successes in the field of rocketry, and to play up at the same time
 their allegations of a war threat to such an extent that masses of people will
 be activated to join the Communist movement in one way or another.
 Mao's long speech at the plenary session was organized around the
 war threat and the superiority of the Bloc.  He contended that the imperialist
 powers were moving toward atomic war, and called upon the Communist delegates
 to do their utmost to disaxm the Free World completely.  Khrushchev in confi-
 dential discussions with foreign CP leaders in Moscow, also appears to have
 imbued them with a fighting optimism.
 Whether or not Khrushchev and Mao divulged their true estimates of
 the strength of the Bloc to the international Communist leadership cannot be
 ascertained.  In any case their talks were clearly designed to strengthen
 Communist morale and to inspire action designed to create serious trouble in
 the Free World.
 For the moment the official Soviet prognosis is extremely optimistic.
 The Soviet writer and Khrushchev protege, Korneychuk, addressing the plenary
 session of the Central Committee of the Ukranian Communist Party on 2 December,
 spoke of the great increase in the prestige of the Soviet Union abroad "since
 our country launched the artificial earth satellite," and made the claim that
 "new hundreds of millions of people" would be "organized around the invincible
 banner of peace."  His statement clearly indicates an expectation that the
 Communist movement, in stirring up the fear of war, can ride in on the coat-
 tails of increasing Soviet prestige.

 The year 1958 should provide the Soviets with a series of tests.
 An intensive and apparently well coordinated action program of Communist front
 organizations is unfolding.  Its main targets are in Asia, Africa, the Middle
 East and Latin America.  The Permanent Council and Secretariat, left behind by
 the Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference in Cairo, is to breathe new life into,
 and expand the chain of local Afro Asian Solidarity committees and energize
 Afro Asian youth, labor and women fronts.  The World Federation of Democratic
 Youth has announced that it will concentrate on Arab youth.  The International
 Union of Students will attempt to revitalize its activities looking toward the
 holding of its fifth Congress in Peking in September.  The Communist-controlled
 International Federation of Democratic Women has convoked its fourth Congress
 for June, in Vienna.  The World Peace Assembly scheduled for mid-1958 (and
 sponsored by the Communist-front World Peace Council) will be preceded by
 strenuous efforts to enlist a great number of new faces.
 The next plenary meeting of the international Communist leadership
 may well be held under the cover of one or the other of these major front
 gatherings, possibly the World Peace Assembly.  On such an occasion the Soviets
 may be expected to carry out a general review of their tactics -- and possibly
 to revise their estimates.
