 INDIA: RETROACTIVE LEGALITY
 Prime Minister Gandhi continues to con-
 solidate her political position, demonstrating a
 firm resolve to remain in office and to remove
 any possible threats to her exercise of power.
 At Gandhi's direction, her party's large
 majorities in both houses of Parliament this
 week enacted retroactive amendments to the
 election law under which she was found guilty
 last June of illegal campaign practices in 1971.
 The amendments render largely meaningless the
 Supreme Court's consideration next week of her
 appeal. They stipulate that the violations of
 which Gandhi was convicted are no longer of-
 fenses and that the figurehead president, rather
 than the courts, will determine the penalty for
 anyone convicted of illegal campaign practices.
 Two more bills are in the process of pas-
 sage. One will exempt these amendments from
 review by the courts and the other will designate
 the upper house of parliament, rather than the
 courts, as the proper authority to consider
 future charges of campaign violations.
 A constitutional amendment signed into
 law last week prevents the courts from acting on
 the legality of the state of emergency Gandhi
 declared in June. The measure had been ap-
 proved by Parliament and was quickly ratified
 by state legislatures also controlled by Gandhi's
 Congress Party.
 Meanwhile,  there  is increasing evidence
 that Gandhi may be contemplating fundamental
 changes in India's system of government. A
 special session of Parliament has been scheduled
 to begin on August 18, and the president of the
 Congress Party is working on a tightly held
 "crisis matter," presumably additional amend-
 ments to the constitution. Gandhi may well
 have in mind substituting for the present par-
 liamentary form of government a strong presi-
 dential system with herself as the first chief
 executive. Eventually she may also move to
 declare India a one-party state.
 UPI
 Popular reaction to Gandhi's recent moves
 remains restrained. The opposition was caught
 off guard by the crackdown in June, and most
 opposition leaders are either in jail or have gone
 underground. Press censors strictly control news
 of political developments, and security remains
 tight throughout the country. There is evidence,
 nonetheless, that opposition elements may be
 planning  nonviolent  demonstrations  in  the
 northeastern state of Bihar and possibly else-
 where on August 9, the anniversary of a major
 anti-British  protest led by Mahatma Gandhi.
 Other demonstrations could occur on August
 15,  India's  independence  day.

 RHODESIA - SOUTH AFRICA
 Vorster Withdraws Police
 The South African government's public
 acknowledgement on August 1 that it is with-
 drawing all its police forces in Rhodesia seems
 intended to underscore Prime Minister Vorster's
 impatience with Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian
 Smith's refusal to begin settlement negotiations
 with the black Rhodesian nationalists. Vorster
 may also hope that removing this symbol of
 South African support for the Smith regime will
 further his ultimate goal of peaceful coexistence
 with the black states of Africa.
 Some  1,600  South  African  police had
 participated  in  Rhodesian counterinsurgency
 operations until last December, when a truce
 with the black insurgents was arranged by the
 South African Prime Minister and four black
 African  presidents.  Last February,  Pretoria
 began a quiet withdrawal of the police, and less
 than 300 now remain in Rhodesia.
 Without  the South  African  police, the
 Rhodesian security forces will be hard pressed
 should the black nationalists carry out their
 threat to resume guerrilla warfare if Smith has
 not agreed by October to a settlement confer-
 ence. Rhodesian whites are outnumbered 20 to
 1, and the shortage of white manpower limits
 further expansion of the security forces.
 Smith says that a settlement conference
 between himself and black Rhodesians must
 take place in Rhodesia. The black nationalists,
 on the other hand, insist that the conference be
 held outside Rhodesia because several of their
 exiled leaders might be arrested if they returned
 for a conference.
 Several  considerations  may  have  kept
 Vorster from openly completing the police with-
 drawal  until                                                                            now.  He probably hoped    that
 uncertainty as to whether the withdrawal would
 be   completed  might  stretch  out Pretoria's
 leverage over both Smith and the black nation-
 alists. Also, Vorster was reluctant to provoke
 the right-wingers in his own National Party, who
 still feel strongly that South Africa should not
 abandon  the white  Rhodesians.  Vorster ap-
 parently has now come to believe that leaving
 even a small police contingent in Rhodesia has
 encouraged Smith to evade meaningful negotia-
 tions with the black nationalists.
 Vorster  is aware that the presidents of
 Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Botswana

 are still trying to keep the black Rhodesians
 from scuttling the truce. Last month the four
 presidents brought the quarreling  Rhodesian
 leaders together and told them that foreign sup-
 port for a new guerrilla offensive was contingent
 on their proving, through a joint approach to
 Smith, that a negotiated settlement was impos-
 sible. Subsequently, a senior Zambian official
 and the black Rhodesians began a new effort to
 resolve the impasse with Smith over a confer-
 ence site.
 The South Africans have announced that
 Smith is to meet with Vorster in Pretoria today.
 They may discuss the latest Zambian effort to
 salvage settlement talks.
 ANGOLA: FIGHTING SPREADS  / /
 The civil war between the National Front
 for the Liberation of Angola and the Popular
 Movement  for  the Liberation  of Angola  is
 steadily spreading. Portuguese officials in Lisbon
 and  Luanda  realize that  the situation has
 reached a crucial stage, but they are unable to
 stop the fighting.
 During  the  past week clashes between
 Angola's two principal liberation groups took
 place at a number of locations south of Luanda
 and in the exclave of Cabinda. Angola's third
 nationalist group, the National Union for the
 Total Independence of Angola, has strong tribal
 support in the area south of Luanda; this in-
 creases the prospect that it will be drawn into
 the fighting. So far, the National Union has
 remained neutral, although in recent months it
 has had to defend itself against small-scale
 attacks by the Popular Movement.
 The clashes in Cabinda apparently were
 sparked by a modest buildup by the National
 Front along Zaire's border with Cabinda. The
 fighting was light and the National Front did
 not penetrate the exclave in force. Cabinda is
 dominated by units of the Popular Movement.
 A  high-level  military  delegation  from
 Lisbon visited Angola last weekend. The group
 consulted with Portuguese military officials in
 Luanda and with representatives of the Popular
 Movement, which has close contacts with a
 number of influential officers in the Armed
 Forces Movement. The National Front and the
 National Union apparently refused to meet with
 the delegation, arguing that it was biased in
 favor of the Popular Movement.
 The suspicions of the Front and the Union
 increased with the departure for Lisbon of the
 Portuguese high commissioner in Angola, who
 had taken a neutral position regarding the fight-
 ing. He probably will not return, and the ter-
 ritory's military commander has become acting
 commissioner.
 Expectations of a Portuguese policy shift
 soon  regarding  Angola  are widespread,  par-
 ticularly  among                                                                          the  territory's estimated
 200,000 whites. Lisbon has announced that it
 will speed the evacuation of all whites who want
 to leave the territory. The announcement has
 provoked speculation  in  the  territory  that
 Lisbon realizes it is helpless to control develop-
 ments in Angola and now intends to turn the
 territory over to the nationalists and let them
 fight it out.

 NIGERIA: ALL QUIET    /   .! 3'    r -Z d
 The new regime lifted all emercncy re-
 strictions late last week as Nigerians quietly ac-
 cepted the replacement of General Gowon by
 Brigadier Muhammed as head of the Federal
 Military Government. For the moment the new
 rulers are preoccupied with putting their admin-
 istration in order and have not indicated how
 they intend to deal with economic problems.
 The Nigerian press, student groups, and
 trade unions have expressed support for the new
 government. At the same time, leading news-
 papers and student spokesmen-long-standing
 critics of military rule-have called on the mili-
 tary to set a firm schedule for returning Nigeria
 to civilian government. Pledges of loyalty have
 also come from several senior officers in the
 Gowon regime who apparently are reconciled to
 their forced retirement. Gowon presently is in
 Togo and may later join his family in London.
 In the new  25-man cabinet, the defense
 post went to Brigadier Bisalla, a respected north-
 ern minority tribesman. Colonel Garba, who
 first announced the coup, emerged as com-
 missioner of external affairs. Civilians hold 12 of
 the posts,  including such important ones as
 petroleum and energy, economic development,
 and finance. An Ibo supreme court justice was
 named commissioner of justice and attorney
 general. This is the only prominent position in
 the new regime awarded to lbos, who still are
 viewed with suspicion  five years after their
 defeat in the civil war.
 The new military governors of Nigeria's 12
 states have been downgraded in importance and
 no longer sit on the Supreme Military Council.
 The council may now be more able to control
 the governors, who were quite free-wheeling
 under Gowon. The governors now comprise the
 National Council of States, a new body intended
 to provide a forum for state representation and
 to act in an advisory capacity to the central
 government.                                   25X1

 COMORO ISLANDS: NEW GOVERNMENT
 A group that wants to maintain close ties
 with France ousted the government of President
 Ahmed Abdallah on August 3. Abdallah ap-
 peared to be moving toward a complete rupture
 with Paris following the islands' unilateral dec-
 laration of independence on July 6. The new
 government has pledged to seek a compromise
 with the inhabitants of the island of Mayotte,
 whose wish to remain a part of France had
 precipitated the dispute between Abdallah and
 Paris.
 About 50 members of the United National
 Front, a coalition of opposition groups, seized
 the local security forces' barracks in the capital
 of Moroni while Abdallah was visiting another
 island. There was no opposition or bloodshed.
 An    11-member  committee  headed  by  Said
 Mohamed Jaffar, a former president of the local
 governing council and former Comorian repre-
 sentative in the French Senate, is in charge.
 The new leaders favor independence, but
 they hope their policy of cooperation with Paris
 will  persuade the inhabitants of Mayotte to
 abandon their demands for incorporation in
 France. The new leadership is willing to offer
 the island considerable autonomy within a fed-
 erated state.
 Abdallah, backed by the Comorian cham-
 ber of deputies, declared the chain of four
 islands independent in an attempt to counter a
 move by the French National Assembly that
 would have permitted Mayotte to become a
 French overseas department. Mayotte political
 leaders denounced Abdallah's declaration and
 demanded that France maintain its authority on
 the  island.  Paris was willing to accept the
 Comoros'  independence and hoped Abdallah
 would  reach a compromise settlement with
 Mayotte.
 Abdallah,  however,  adopted  a  militant
 position; on August 1 he demanded that the
 French withdraw from all the islands as soon as
 possible. Pro-French demonstrations began in
 Mayotte on the same day. Jaffar and his fol-

 ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK
 The Islamic Development Bank, the
 largest multilateral aid institution funded by
 Middle East oil producers, held its inaugural
 meeting in Riyadh last week. The bank,
 headquartered in Jidda, has an authorized
 capital of $2.4 billion, more than $900 mil-
 lion of which already has been subscribed.
 The bank is scheduled to start opera-
 tions in October and will provide interest-
 free loans for development projects in Is-
 lamic countries. The bank may also supply
 equity funding for industrial projects, Most
 of its work presumably will be undertaken
 in conjunction with other international fi-
 nancial agencies.
 Pakistan and Egypt first proposed a
 Muslim development bank in  1970, but
 Saudi Arabia is now the principal champion
 of the institution. There. are 27 member
 countries and two applications are pending.
 Major OPEC commitments have been made
 by Saudi Arabia  ($250 million),  Libya
 ($150 million), the United Arab Emirates
 ($137 million), and Kuwait ($125 million).
 Pledges of $12 million or more have come
 from Turkey, Sudan, Pakistan, Egypt, and
 Bangladesh.
 The new bank brings to five the num-
 ber of OPEC-sponsored multilateral institu-
 tions that provide development assistance.
 The combined authorized capital of these
 banks is over $4 billion. There are two other
 OPEC-sponsored agencies not yet in opera-

 The upsurge of anti-Communist violence in
 the north has driven security forces, as well as
 Communist Party functionaries, out of several
 towns. The accidental shooting deaths of two
 demonstrators in Famalicao resulted in the sack-
 ing and burning of the local Communist head-
 quarters, as well as attacks on the property of
 known Communists. Similar incidents have been
 reported in neighboring towns, and one police
 official has stated that the people are mobilizing
 in many other places to the north to "finish off

 militancy by Catholics in opposing efforts to
 alienate the people from the clergy. Both the
 patriarch of Lisbon and the papal nuncio have
 said that the church in Portugal is determined to
 struggle against the government's pro-Commu-
 nist policies.
 Faced with these attacks, Communist Party
 leader  Alvaro Cunhal  has made an  unprec-
 edented appeal to radical leftist groups-some of
 which are among his bitterest enemies-to join
 with the Communists to prevent them from
 being overwhelmed by "counter-revolutionary"

 dealt a sharp setback in their efforts to infiltrate
 and control key military units. General Carvalho

 the expelled officers reinstated and their Com-

 decision  could  be  instrumental  in  restoring
 discipline to the military and in discouraging
 Communist penetration of other units.
 The Portuguese leaders' "shock" last week
 over the extent of independence sentiment
 reported in the Azores has been reinforced by
 the news of another independence movement
 with anti-Communist overtones on Madeira. The
 Madeira branch of the Popular Democratic Party
 is reportedly spearheading the independence
 drive, and Lisbon was sufficiently concerned last
 weekend to reinforce its garrison on the island.
 TURKEY: WAITING IT OUT
 Turkish Prime Minister Demirel declared
 this week that Turkey cannot negotiate a new
 defense agreement with the US as long as the
 arms embargo remains in effect. If no end to the
 arms embargo appears to be in sight by fall, the
 Turks may resume negotiations but solely to
 Former  prime  minister  Bulent  Ecevit,
 leader of the opposition, has challenged Demirel
 to outline the future status of US bases now
 that  bilateral defense  agreements  have,  in
 Turkish  eyes, become invalid. Ecevit clearly
 intends to make political capital out of the base
 issue in the senatorial elections scheduled for
 October.
 Ecevit's tough line will make it more dif-
 ficult for Demirel to show much give on the US
 base issue or the Turkish presence on Cyprus.
 Even  if  the  embargo  is  lifted,  Demirel  is
 expected to demand continued Turkish admin-
 istrative control over the bases and ask for some
 adjustments in Turkey's "special" relations with
 the US.

 Western leaders at the summit last week
 stressed that implementation of the provisions
 of the European security conference protocol
 will provide the only real test of the spirit of
 detente as expressed in Helsinki. In evaluating
 the conference, West Europeans will focus on
 military security and the freer flow of people,
 ideas, and information between East and West.
 The first in a series of follow-up meetings to
 monitor the progress in implementing the CSCE
 accords will be held in Belgrade in 1977.
 The Soviets went out of their way to play
 to the more optimistic instincts of the Western
 nations. Brezhnev's conference speech was an
 adroit expression of Soviet interests woven in a
 language sensitive to the nagging Western con-
 cern that Moscow had somehow gained the most
 from the conference. He called the non-inter-
 ference principles the "main conclusion" of the
 conference.  To the  West,  non-interference
 means no more Czechoslovakias. To Brezhnev, it
 means that the West cannot use humanitarian
 issues as an excuse to meddle in Soviet internal
 affairs. Brezhnev told the conference that the
 information  media  can  poison,  as  well  as
 promote, international understanding.
 Brezhnev studiously refrained from saying
 anything about the inviolability of frontiers-a
 concept that has been widely interpreted as
 legitimizing Moscow's post - World War II ter-
 ritorial gains in Europe and that was clearly one
 of the Soviets' principal objectives in CSCE. On
 the contrary, Brezhnev tried to give the impres-
 sion that CSCE was not a denouement, but a
 prologue. Brezhnev did not blanch at extolling
 the humanitarian benefits that will derive from
 the agreement.
 The words were easy, but the practice may
 be another story. The Soviets will have to show
 considerable flexibility and a flair for public
 relations if they are to convince others that they
 are living up to the agreements. The text was, as
 promised, printed in full in the Soviet press, but
 the Soviets seem to have been caught off guard
 when  American  correspondents  applied  for
 multiple entry visas.
 Brezhnev stated that with the conclusion
 of the CSCE, progress at the force reductions
 talks in Vienna is now a "priority goal" of the
 Soviet Union. This sentiment, echoed by all the
 larger Western powers except France, may be
 put to the test this fall when the talks resume.
 The first and, perhaps, most visible test of
 the new accord will come when the Warsaw Pact
 gives advance notice of its military maneuvers
 this fall under the provisions of military-related,
 confidence-building measures. This week, NATO
 members  agreed  on  a  text  concerning the
 notification of a series of exercises planned for

 September involving US, West German, Cana-
 dian, and French forces. The Allied announce-
 ment specifies the time, purpose, and area of the
 maneuvers, the  units  participating,  and  the
 number of troops involved. The Western powers
 will be watching whether the Warsaw Pact states
 reciprocate with the same degree of detail in
 their notification.
 The Communist performance regarding the
 provisions  for greater  exchanges of people,
 ideas,  and information will also be watched
 closely. Procedures for putting some of these
 provisions into effect still must be worked out
 in bilateral accords. Other provisions will be
 dealt with in international forums, such as UN
 specialized bodies and trade organizations.
 The  East  European  regimes  can  be
 expected to deal very cautiously with questions
 relating to the freer movement of ideas and
 people. Indeed, the East German and Czecho-
 slovak news media have only obliquely referred
 to such issues.
 The  West  anticipates  significant  com-
 mercial as well as political benefits to result
 from the accords. Western businessmen hope
 they will be allowed to set up offices in Moscow
 and to expedite transactions by dealing directly
 with factory managers instead of going through
 ministry officials.
 The Helsinki summit may breathe life into
 the largely dormant UN Economic Commission
 for Europe. The commission  is preparing a
 report on follow-up procedures for the CSCE, to
 include suggestions for projects involving:
 ? expansion of trade between East and
 West,
 ? economic planning and forecasting,
 ? regularized and detailed exchanges of
 information in the fields of science, technol-
 ogy, and the environment,
 ?  moves  toward  harmonization  and
 standardization,
 ? joint  research  concerning  environ-
 mental and energy problems,
 .?  development of common projects in
 the energy, communications, and transporta-
 tion fields.
 According to Chancellor Schmidt, the 35
 participating  nations are  now morally com-
 mitted to "let deeds follow words." The burden
 of  implementation-particularly  in  the areas
 requiring increased exchanges-will fall primarily
 on the East. The "voluntary" commitments
 represent,  in  the words of Prime Minister
 Wilson, "a moral commitment to be ignored at
 our mutual  peril."

 President Ford's whirlwind trip to Eastern
 Europe generated much  popular enthusiasm,
 which the leaders in Warsaw, Bucharest, and
 Belgrade will use to their own advantage. News
 media at each stop gave heavy coverage to the
 Presidential visits.
 Poland's leaders were obviously pleased
 that the President chose to visit their country
 only ten months after party chief Gierek be-
 came the first East European leader to talk with
 President Ford. The Poles appeared to be es-
 pecially proud that the President chose to stop
 in Warsaw before going on to Helsinki for the
 CSCE summit meeting. Polish news media have
 underscored expanding Polish-US contacts, par-
 ticularly in the economic and commercial fields.
 Gierek can be expected to emphasize Warsaw's
 developing ties with Washington as he tries to
 divert attention from his regime's economic
 problems.
 The timing of President Ford's visit to
 Romania-in  Bucharest's view-could scarcely
 have been better, since it closely followed US
 congressional action opening the way for most-
 favored-nation  status for Romania. President
 Ceausescu  probably hopes that the bilateral
 summit meeting will boost his prestige, which
 has suffered because of economic problems and
 the recent devastating floods. Ceausescu accord-
 ingly rolled out the red carpet, and the US
 embassy in Bucharest reported that the Roma-
 nians gave more media coverage to President
 Ford's visit than to that of any other foreign
 dignitary. Romanian journalists dwelled on the
 significance of most-favored-nation treatment
 and stressed the "profound fact" that the Presi-
 dent arrived in Bucharest only a day after the
 Helsinki summit.
 The Yugoslavs, like the Romanians, viewed
 the visit as a welcome sign of Washington's in-
 terest in their country's stability and indepen-
 dence.  Belgrade  reported  that  the dialogue
 between the President and Tito "went further
 than all other" Yugoslav-US summit meetings.
 Milika Sundic, Radio Zagreb's authoritative
 commentator, suggested that Belgrade was par-
 ticularly pleased with Washington's desire to
 improve relations in all fields, presumably in-
 cluding  military  relations.  Sundic  probably
 summed up Belgrade's hopes in noting that
 despite some continuing differences, Yugoslavia
 and the US will cooperate "as previously and
 perhaps more broadly" in solving problems to-
 gether.
 Egyptian Finance Minister Ismail returned
 home empty-handed on August 2 after extended
 negotiations with Moscow regarding Cairo's debt
 on military purchases from the USSR. The fail-
 ure of the negotiations to                                                                                                              make significant
 progress could lead Egyptian President Sadat to
 take further action against Moscow's remaining
 interests in Egypt. The Soviets are apparently
 trying to head this off by promising to hold
 more talks at an unspecified date in Cairo and
 holding out the prospect of additional develop-
 ment aid.
 The Egyptians wanted an extension of the
 ten-year moratorium, which expired in 1974, on
 its military debt to Moscow. The Soviets re-
 fused, insisting on payment of the $200 million
 now overdue. This would require Egypt to di-
 vert large quantities of exports-mainly hard-
 currency  earners-to  the  USSR  and  would
 impose additional strains on Cairo's balance of
 payments.
 The Soviet position indicates Moscow is
 going to continue to play tough with Egypt,
 even at risk to its remaining privileges in Egypt.
 The Egyptians have already clearly linked their
 restrictions on Soviet naval access to Egyptian
 ports to Moscow's inflexibility on the debt and
 on the provision of military equipment.
 One potential target for Sadat may be the
 Soviet MIG-25 reconnaisance unit, which has
 been stationed in Egypt since the October 1973
 war. The Egyptians appear to have initiated
 steps to force the Soviets to remove these four
 planes, but may have relented when Moscow
 invited the finance minister to Moscow. F_

 CYPRUS: GREEK FLEXIBILITY
 Prospects for a negotiated Cyprus settle-
 ment may have improved following a productive
 round of intercommunal talks in Vienna last
 week. The Greek side may now be willing to
 accept the Turkish demand for a biregional fed-
 eration with a weak central government, albeit
 in return for significant territorial concessions.
 In the most significant development
 date in the talks, Greek and Turkish Cypriot
 negotiators agreed to the transfer of the 9,000
 Turkish Cypriots in the south to the north and
 an improvement in the living conditions of equal number of Greek Cypriots      Turkish
 ex-
 pelled   zone. Some 800 Greek Cypriots
 pelled recently from the north will be allowed
 to return.
 Greek Cypriot willingness to permit the
 departure of the Turkish Cypriots-a long-stand-
 ing demand of the Turkish Cypriot leadership-
 represents a significant departure from President
 Makarios' past strategy, which used the presence
 of the Turkish Cypriots in the south as evidence
 of the feasibility of his multiregi to al federation
 a ascheme. Makarios now appears
 cloned this idea. A plausible press report from
 Ankara states that Greek Cypriot negotiator
 Clerides agreed in Vienna to accept a biregional
 federation with a weak central government in
 return for territorial concessions. Greek Cyp-
 riots have demanded the return of the rich
 Morphou and Famagusta areas and have vari-
 ously indicated a willingness to accept Turkish
 Cypriot control over as much as 25 percent of
 the island's land area. The Turks presently
 occupy 38 percent of the island.
 Much depends on whether the Turks meet
 the territorial demands of the Greek Cypriots.

 WEST GERMAN - POLISH ACCORD
 West German  Chancellor  Schmidt and
 Polish Communist Party Chief Gierek agreed in
 Helsinki last week on economic aid measures
 and repatriation of ethnic Germans-two issues
 that have hampered relations since the bilateral
 reconciliation treaty was signed in 1970.
 The agreement, initialed in Germany yes-
 terday and to be signed formally when Foreign
 Minister Genscher visits Warsaw in October, pro-
 vides for:
 ? A low-interest loan of $400 million by
 West Germany and a lump sum payment of
 about $500 million to a Polish pension fund,
 ostensibly as compensation for war losses;
 ? Polish permission for the repatriation
 of some 125,000 ethnic Germans over the
 next four years.
 Much of the $900 million could return to
 West Germany in the form of payment for ex-
 ports. Poland has cut back on purchases of West
 German goods due to low hard currency earn-
 ings and the coolness in  political  relations.
 Bonn's decision to boost its payment to the
 pension fund was the key to the breakthrough.
 Chancellor Schmidt held out against increasing
 the size of the low-interest loan that his pred-
 ecessor Brandt initially offered the Poles.
 West German officials have so far resisted
 demands from the Soviets and other East Euro-
 peans for government-subsidized credits. The
 only similar loan was to Yugoslavia under the
 guise of development aid.
 Schmidt still must obtain Bundestag ap-
 proval of the payment to the pension fund.
 Opposition  Christian  Democratic  leaders are
 charging the Poles with extortion, claiming that
 the Brandt government had already made a
 political payment for the emigration of ethnic
 Germans by recognizing the Oder-Neisse line in
 the treaty of 1970.
 Warsaw did allow over 50,000 to repatriate
 in the years immediately after the treaty but
 sharply curtailed emigration in 1973, when the
 Brandt government refused to meet its demands
 for credits and indemnification. The opposi-
 tion's arguments, however, are unlikely to influ-
 ence the final parliamentary vote, because the

 AUSTRIA: A NEW CHALLENGER                      61-.-63
 The death last month of Karl Schleinzer,
 the leader of the opposition People's Party, and
 his replacement by a political unknown diminish
 the party's prospects as it prepares for national
 elections on October 5.
 At a special party congress last week, the
 executive committee  unanimously agreed on
 41-year-old Josef Taus as the new party leader
 and chancellor-candidate. Taus, the director of
 the Austrian savings bank system and a member
 of the party's labor league, met the require-
 ments for a new, younger leader to challenge
 Socialist control of the government. Taus is the
 image of the self-made man of working class
 background. His banking experience may enable
 him to speak more authoritatively on Austria's
 economic issues than his predecessor.

 Taus, nevertheless, will have difficulty out-
 pointing the witty, urbane, and politically astute
 Chancellor  Kreisky.  The  outspokenness  of
 Kreisky has often involved him in unnecessary
 controversy, yet his stewardship coincides with
 a period of domestic political stability and pro-
 longed economic prosperity.
 Barring some dramatic event, such as a
 serious downturn in the economy or Kreisky's
 sudden physical deterioration, there seems to be
 little chance that the Socialists will fail to win a
 plurality next October.
 The best chance for the People's Party to

 Moscow is using more foreign laborers to
 complete  high-priority  natural  resource and
 tourism projects. It has established a new for-
 eign trade organization to arrange agreements
 and coordinate work with foreign construction
 firms.
 Most of the foreign laborers so far have
 come from Bulgaria, which began sending con-
 struction workers to the Soviet Union in 1968
 to build camps and other facilities for the tim-
 ber project in the Komi ASSR. Next came lum-
 bermen, and now over 10,000 Bulgarians are at
 the project. Others have worked on a gas pipe-
 line and various construction projects. As many
 as 45,000 Bulgarians are reportedly employed in
 the Soviet Union.
 Finns have worked on projects near the
 Soviet-Finnish border. Finnish laborers helped
 build the Hotel Viru in Tallinn between 1969
 and 1972. They are now on jobs such as the
 modernization of a pulp and paper complex
 near Leningrad, a logging project, and prepara-
 tory work on an ore concentration facility near
 the Soviet-Finnish border.
 The gas pipeline from Orenburg to Eastern
 Europe will employ the most foreign labor. Five
 East European countries agreed last year to send
 workers to build segments of the pipeline for
 this CEMA project in partial payment for gas
 that these nations will receive beginning about
 1979. Workers from Eastern Europe began en-
 tering the USSR in March and April; construc-
 tion activity will be at its height in 1976.
 Next year, 2,000 East European construc-
 tion workers will join 26,000 Soviets working
 on another CEMA project-the Ust Ilim pulp
 complex under construction since 1973.
 Western labor will be needed for the So-
 viets' hotel construction program. Last Septem-
 ber a Moscow official put the city's total labor
 shortage at 120,000, noting that the construc-
 tion sector, long blamed for shoddy workman-
 ship and failure to complete projects on sched-
 ule, was particularly short. Soviet officials have
 said they will need at least 40 new hotels in time
 for the 1980 Olympics. A $180-million agree-
 ment concluded in December calls for a French
 group to employ 800 workers to build three
 hotels in Moscow and one in Leningrad.
 Another agreement with a Swedish con-
 struction firm and Intercontinental Hotels of
 the US for four hotels was signed in May 1974,
 although final approval of the deal has been
 stymied by Soviet refusal to allow Intercon-
 tinental a role in managing the hotels. The So-
 viets are discussing more hotel construction ar-
 rangements with firms from France, Finland,
 West Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, the
 UK, and the US. Yugoslav construction firms
 are negotiating to build a $500-million Olympic
 village in Moscow. Yugoslav firms are also build-
 ing hotels in Sochi and Yalta.
 Moscow is not doing any favors for the
 countries that send workers to the USSR. The
 CEMA countries have complained that their
 commitments to Orenburg will exacerbate their
 own labor shortages and interfere with fulfill-
 ment of their production plans in some sectors.
 As a result, the number of East European la-
 borers expected to work on the project has been
 reduced to about half the originally planned
 25,000. Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and East Ger-
 many  have halved their  labor commitments
 since June, and Bulgaria has bowed out alto-
 gether. Only Poland is likely to provide the
 4,000-4,500 workers announced last year.
 Foreign labor will also be expensive; work-
 ers reportedly will continue to receive full pay
 from their home jobs, as well as a second salary
 from the pipeline job. The workers are also
 promised living standards comparable to what
 they are accustomed to at home, a policy which
 could create morale problems for the workers
 on the project.

 NORTH VIETNAMESE ARMED FORCES
 Three Months After Victory
 During a few dramatic weeks characterized
 by the rapid demise of the South Vietnamese
 government and the capture of massive amounts
 of US-made equipment and munitions, Hanoi
 emerged  with the second strongest military
 establishment in East Asia. This sudden military
 dominance has not been lost on neighboring
 Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philip-
 pines. There is apprehension in these countries
 that Hanoi, now fat with success and the spoils
 of war, might be tempted to increase assistance
 to the insurgencies with which these countries
 have to contend.
 Just what the communist leadership  is
 thinking in respect to the use of its military
 capability is unknown. One thing Hanoi will do
 is keep a strong force in the South as long as it is
 needed.
 Foremost among Hanoi's concerns is main-
 taining internal security, while the communists
 grapple with  economic,  administrative,  and
 political problems.
 Occupation Army
 The mission of most North Vietnamese
 army units in the South is that of an occupation
 army. Their duties now consist of providing
 security,  mopping  up  holdout  remnants of
 former South Vietnamese units, and assisting in
 restoring and maintaining general law and order.
 They also have administrative, engineering, and
 agricultural tasks.
 A high communist official recently con-
 firmed that security remains the major problem
 in the South. Although the resistance appears to
 have little hope, harassment attacks are wide
 ranging enough to require extensive counterin-
 surgency efforts from the communists. The
 South Vietnamese diehards have to a degree
 reversed the tables on the communists, who now
 station relatively large numbers of troops along
 highways, near bridges, and at remote outposts
 to fend off small attacking forces armed with
 light weapons.
 North Vietnamese forces have had to take
 up positions along the ill-defined border with
 Cambodia. Numerous small clashes have erupted
 as Khmer communists and Vietnamese commu-
 nists dispute territory. The Vietnamese moved
 quickly to assert claims to several offshore is-
 lands in the Gulf of Thailand earlier this sum-
 mer, and they are not likely to cede any prop-
 erty to their weaker communist neighbor.
 Communist forces in the South also have
 been heavily engaged in clearing the countryside
 of the dangerous relics of war. Both Hanoi and
 Saigon have announced that engineer units have
 cleared large numbers of unexploded bombs,
 shells, and mines, and removed derelict military
 vehicles from farmlands. They state that large
 parts of the country have been restored to agri-
 cultural production and that new farming areas
 will open.
 Communist military personnel are spending
 considerable time identifying, cataloging, and
 storing the large quantities of US equipment and
 munitions captured last spring. The North Viet-
 namese have already made use of some of the
 equipment, including US aircraft, in the delta
 and against the Khmer communists on some
 offshore islands. The eventual disposition of
 much of the captured equipment probably has
 not yet been decided. So far there has been no
 evidence that Hanoi is offering surplus arms to
 insurgents in other countries, although that pos-
 sibility worries neighboring capitals.
 The shortage of qualified civilian adminis-
 trators has forced the communists to use mili-
 tary personnel in a variety of government jobs,
 mostly at the lower levels. Some military cadre
 have been filling in as civil servants and helping
 with the "re-education" of former government

 VIETNAM  jflp
 Phnom Penh and Hanoi announced this
 week that North Vietnamese party chief Le
 Duan, responding to a Cambodian invitation,
 had just concluded talks with Khmer leaders in
 the Cambodian capital. Neither announcement
 gave any details of the discussions, the partici-
 pants involved, or the dates, but the meeting
 probably took place sometime between July 7
 and 22. During that time, no member of the
 North Vietnamese Politburo was seen in public,
 and there was speculation that Politburo mem-
 bers were in South Vietnam attending a party
 plenum. It is possible that Le Duan and others
 made a side trip to Cambodia.
 The North Vietnamese visit to Cambodia is
 the first publicly announced visit by a high-level
 foreign delegation since the communists as-
 sumed control in mid-April, and it may have
 been an effort by Phnom Penh to introduce
 some balance into the Peking-Hanoi competition
 for influence. Peking has yet to dispatch a dele-
 gation of equivalent rank, although Chinese
 representatives have been in Phnom Penh since
 shortly after the collapse of the Lon Nol govern-
 ment, and China has been by far the largest
 source of aid to the new regime.
 Probably aware that the North Vietnamese
 visit would touch Chinese sensitivities, Radio
 Phnom Penh on the same day broadcast a mes-
 sage to China's defense minister commemorating
 the anniversary of the Chinese army. The mes-
 sage warmly thanked the Chinese for their sup-
 port during the five-year war and noted that this
 support has continued in the "new phase of the
 Cambodian revolution."
 Communist  officials  are  preparing  the
 people in South  Vietnam  for possible food
 shortages later this year and next. Recent propa-
 ganda broadcasts have stressed that "famine,"
 caused by the old capitalist-oriented agricultural
 system, "will continue to wreak a disastrous
 impact for a long time to come as it cannot be
 overcome immediately."
 Rice stocks are probably large enough to
 last until the autumn harvest. There are local-
 ized shortages, but these reflect distribution
 problems rather than a lack of rice.
 Rice output this autumn, however, will be
 lower than last year's record crop of 7 million
 tons. The profit-oriented production and mar-
 keting system of the past has been upset, and
 farmers face reduced supplies of fertilizers, fuel,
 machinery, and spare parts-all of which must
 be imported and most of which were previously
 financed by foreign aid. Communist officials
 hope to compensate partially for production
 shortfalls by expanding farm acreage in formerly
 insecure areas and increasing rural labor. Urban
 residents are being encouraged to move out of
 the cities by offers of free land, transport, seeds,
 and tools. Since April, several hundred thousand
 people have reportedly been resettled.
 The communists have thus far avoided a
 rush to collectivize the agricultural sector. They
 probably recognize that such a move would dis-
 rupt production even more. Instead, communal
 farming has been introduced only in previously
 settled communist areas, refugee resettlements,
 and on newly opened farmlands provided to
 urban emigrants.

 A year ago, after Mao Tse-tung had left
 Peking, he reportedly summoned China's 11 re-
 gional military commanders. They refused to see
 him, and for good reason. The rest of the leader-
 ship in Peking had agreed to call a halt to the
 anti-Confucius campaign, which was aimed at
 several  of the commanders, in the name of
 national unity. The Chairman did not agree with
 this decision and still seemed bent on purging
 some of the commanders. This year there were
 new signs that the case against the commanders
 had been reopened-probably at the insistence
 of Mao. If so, the Chairman did not carry the
 day.
 The commanders were summoned in June
 to meet with the top party leadership in Peking.
 Under  these  circumstances, they could not
 refuse. Tensions between the party and the mili-
 tary had begun to ease during Mao's extended
 absence from Peking, and it seems likely that
 the month-long gathering of regional military
 commanders, some two months after the Chair-
 man's return to the capital, was called to air
 Mao's long-standing complaints.

 The charges against these military men
 have consistently been: support for former de-
 fense minister Lin Piao, who was accused of
 plotting a military coup, and harboring pro-
 Soviet tendencies. The first charge backfired on
 Mao himself. Earlier this year, he had to admit
 his own responsibility in helping to bring Lin to
 power, largely removing the guilt from the re-
 gional military commanders.
 The  military,  however,  seem  to  have
 emerged from the Peking meetings in a relatively
 good position. Eight of the regional command-
 ers appeared in their home bases during China's
 Army Day celebrations on July 31. This group
 includes Politburo members Li Te-sheng and
 Hsu Shih-yu, who have been in and out of
 political trouble for almost two years.
 It seems likely that the recent meeting
 focused on the pro-Soviet accusation. During
 Mao's absence from Peking, his hard-line anti-
 Soviet policy apparently came under some criti-
 cism, but upon his return to the capital anti-
 Soviet polemics from Peking heightened. The
 Chairman may have tried to use his success on
 the  Soviet  issue  against  the  military  com-
 manders, trying once again to purge them by
 branding them as pro-Soviet.

 Peking dealt less severely than expected
 with the former party boss of Heilungkiang
 Province, a military man who seemed almost
 certain to be purged. He lost his party post and
 was demoted to a strictly military-and rela-
 tively low-ranking-position in the regional mili-
 tary command.

 ARGENTINA: THE "MINI-CABINET"
 Although President Peron's return to work
 after weeks of illness was the publicized high-
 light of the past week, of far more consequence
 is the growing prominence of a small group of
 cabinet ministers who are assuming the day-to-
 day direction of the government.
 Dubbed the "mini-cabinet," the group is
 led by Interior Minister Benitez and includes
 Justice Minister Corvalan and Defense Minister
 Garrido. For the time being, these three remain
 politically acceptable to labor and the military
 because, unlike other ministers, they have no
 links to the ousted Lopez Rega.
 Since the emergence of the "mini-cabinet,"
 the government appears to have overcome some
 of its paralysis. Recent actions include:
 ? Tightening of controls on imports, to
 ease the balance-of-payments situation, and
 naming of a new central bank president.
 ? Intervention  in  the  National  Grain
 Board,  following  revelation of high-level
 bribery cases there.
 ? Easing of press restrictions that had
 been clamped on during the ascendancy of
 Lopez Rega.
 ? Granting of massive wage increases to
 public employees, following many weeks of
 indecision on that matter.
 ? Release of a number of political prison-
 ers, on condition that they leave the coun-
 try.
 The release of the prisoners, aimed at
 easing tensions, changing the rightist image of
 the government under Lopez Rega, and ridding
 the country of some key dissidents, began even
 before last week's truce offer by the leftist
 People's Revolutionary Army in exchange for
 certain concessions, including release of all polit-
 ical prisoners. That group also wants the govern-
 ment to end the state of siege and rescind all
 "repressive" measures, including the ban on its
 activities. Although the group realizes there is
 no chance that these demands will be met, the
 publicized offer is probably designed to enhance
 its image by displaying a willingness to be con-
 ciliatory and to highlight what it sees as govern-
 ment repression.
 Cabinet ministers who have ties to Lopez
 Rega continue to be attacked politically and
 have been rendered ineffective. Foreign Minister
 Vignes and Labor Minister Conditti reportedly
 have  offered  their  resignations.
 BRAZIL: TIME FOR RETRENCHMENT
 President Geisel has responded to a resur-
 gence of criticism from military conservatives by
 defining the goals of his administration in a way
 that de-emphasizes the importance of political
 liberalization. Last week, in a lengthy and rather
 detailed speech, Geisel instead stressed his con-
 cern with social progress and called attention to
 recent economic gains.
 Asserting that economic growth will con-
 tinue Geisel  outlined government efforts to
 stimulate  development, retard  inflation, and
 reduce Brazil's balance-of-payments deficit. The
 major portion of his speech was concerned with
 social programs. At the conclusion he made
 some  highly significant  comments regarding
 politics.
 Geisel made it clear that he does not intend
 to promote a return to democratic rule. On the
 contrary he stated his intention to retain special
 decree powers and alluded to the necessity for
 vigilance against communist infiltration and sub-
 version. He said "a lot has been published and
 said about political relaxation... none of which
 corresponds to reality." He then referred to
 "relaxation" in terms of technical social pro-
 grams that provide low-cost housing and free
 medical care to the needy.

 Just before the speech General Golbery,
 Geisel's political adviser, formally resumed his
 official duties after a long illness, but the Presi-
 dent's remarks suggest that Golbery, the ad-
 vocate of political liberalization, is unlikely to
 regain  the influence he previously exercised
 within the government. Instead it appears that
 Geisel intends to preserve the greater political
 freedom granted thus far, and to protect his
 own authority by adopting a more conservative
 political posture

 The  Latin  American Economic System
 (SELA) remains a disembodied spirit following
 the conference in Panama, where advocates had
 hoped to establish this new Latin/Caribbean
 association. A second try at creation is sched-
 uled for October 15. Venezuela, Mexico, and
 Panama, the leading proponents of a broad new
 hemispheric organization excluding the US, will
 probably lobby intensively for a more fruitful
 second session.
 Both the promoters and the demurrers feel
 that they achieved something at Panama. The
 originators of the notion take pride in having
 attracted delegates from 25 governments-all the
 invitees but the Bahamas and Surinam. More-
 over, they wrung a unanimous resolution out of
 the conference favoring the establishment of
 SELA despite grave reservations on the part of
 many countries.
 The opponents of SELA came reluctant
 but resigned to the need to maintain public
 solidarity, and found solace in having forced a
 delay while a working group drafts a more speci-
 fic definition of the organization's goals and
 structure. The fundamental concern of those
 opposed is that SELA's principal goal is pre-
 cisely what the would-be founders insist that it
 is not: to put pressure on the US.
 Critics of SELA also managed to raise the
 many practical problems that Venezuela and
 Mexico have tried to ignore. The vague prin-
 ciples proposed for SELA take no account of
 the many political and economic differences
 that divide the countries of the area, and they
 fail to clarify the relationship with the various
 economic pacts and federations already in exist-
 ence. The small countries are voicing their con-
 cern over prospects of being dominated by the
 much  larger economies of such countries as
 Brazil and Mexico. Also, the SELA documents
 do not address the question of who would bear
 the burden of granting special treatment for the
 least developed areas.
 One potential point of controversy never
 developed. The SELA meeting provided a kind
 of debut for Cuba  in the Latin/Caribbean
 brotherhood, following the recent lifting of the
 OAS  sanctions against Havana. Continuing
 Cuba's role as behind-the-scenes sponsor of
 SELA, Cuba's delegation worked unobtrusively
 and evidently took pains not to give offense.
 The Cubans will be elated at the founding of an
 all-Latin system, but clearly do not intend to
 trumpet SELA as an anti-US victory, at least for
 the time being.
 SELA's promoters will have to take some
 note of the concerns that have been raised, but
 probably count more on the momentum of the
 swing toward solidarity in getting the union
 established. Whether SELA ever really promotes
 economic development is most likely of rela-
 tively little importance to Mexico and Vene-
 zuela. They would take satisfaction in producing
 a paper organization that leaves out the US and   25X1
 that serves as another platform from which they
 can plead the case for a "new world order"
