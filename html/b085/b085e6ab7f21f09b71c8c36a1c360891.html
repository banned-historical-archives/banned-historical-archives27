 ITALY JOINS WAR ON UNITED STATES
 FBIS was still in its formative stage when the Japanese
 attack on Pearl Harbor plunged the United States into war. Only
 two monitoring stations were fully operative; the others were still
 ironing out communications and staffing problems. The demand
 for information from enemy sources was pressing. A fledgling
 FBIS responded. On 9 December 1941 its east coast monitoring
 station picked up Mussolini's announcement that Italy had
 joined Japan and Germany in war against the United States. The
 declaration was flashed to Washington ahead of the news
 agencies, and FBIS had registered the first of many
 achievements as the official U.S. Government monitoring
 service. In his speech from the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia, as
 broadcast by Rome radio's North American service, the Duce
 declared:
 ... Today the Italian flag is flying with those of
 Germany and Japan, symbolic of the pact of steel
 uniting the three countries.... Neither the Axis nor
 Japan wanted the spread of the conflict.... One man,
 and one man alone, an out-and-out despot, through
 an endless series of provocations, deceiving his own
 people, wanted the war and prepared for it day by day
 with diabolical perseverance. The formidable blows
 which have already been inflicted on the United
 States over the immense expanse of the Pacific are
 proof of the valor of the soldiers of the rising sun.... I
 say, and you hear it: It is a privilege to fight with
 them. Today the Tripartite Alliance, proud of its
 moral and material means, has a powerful instrument
 for war. It is sure of victory. [Crowd roars] Tomorrow
 it will be the maker and the organizer of a just peace
 among peoples.... Italian men and women, rise once
 more. Be worthy of this great hour. We shall win!

 HITLER ESCAPES ASSASSINATION
 ATTEMPT
 On 20 July 1944 a group of German officers attempted to
 assassinate Hitler by smuggling a bomb into a briefing session at
 his headquarters. The bomb killed several of those present, but
 Hitler escaped. Washington, reacting to German claims that the
 Fuehrer had survived the blast, urgently sought confirmation
 that he was still alive. This came later that day, when the
 German radio was heard to interrupt a scheduled newscast to
 announce that the Fuehrer was about to address the German
 nation. A very angry Hitler came on the air to say:
 German men and women: I do not know how many
 times attempts on my life have been planned and
 carried out. If I address you today, I am doing so for
 two reasons: first, so that you shall hear my voice and
 know that I personally am unhurt and well; second, so
 that you shall hear details about a crime which has no
 equal in German history.
 An extremely small clique of ambitious, unscru-
 pulous, and at the same time foolish and criminally
 stupid, officers hatched a plot to remove me and,
 together with me, virtually exterminate the Staff of
 the German High Command.
 A bomb which was placed by Colonel Graf von
 Stauffenberg exploded 2 meters from me on my right
 side. It wounded very seriously a number of my dear
 collaborators. One of them has died. I personally am
 entirely unhurt, apart from negligible grazes, bruises,
 and burns.... The assertion of these usurpers that I
 was no longer alive is disproved at this moment, as I
 am talking to you, my dear Volksgenossen....

 GERMANY CAPITULATES TO ALLIES
 Faced with defeat, Hitler took his life on 30 April 1945.
 German armies on the western front began surrendering on 4
 May. On 7 May 1945 the German radio at Flensburg carried the
 following statement by Reichsminister Count Schwerin von
 Krosigk:
 German men and women: The High Command of
 the Armed Forces today [7 May], at the order of
 Grand Admiral Doenitz, declared the unconditional
 surrender of all the fighting German troops. As the
 leading minister of the Reich Government whom the
 Admiral of the Fleet has appointed to wind up all
 military tasks, I turn at this tragic moment of our
 history to the German nation.
 After a heroic fight of almost 6 years of
 incomparable hardness, Germany has succumbed to
 the overwhelming power of its enemies. To continue
 the war would only mean senseless bloodshed and
 futile disintegration. This government, which bears
 the responsibility for the future of the nation, has
 been compelled to act on the collapse of all physical
 and material forces and to request of the enemy a
 cessation of hostilities. It was the noblest task of the
 Admiral of the Fleet and of the government
 supporting him, after the terrible sacrifices which the
 war had demanded, to save, in this last phase of the
 war, the lives of the maximum number of his fellow
 countrymen....

 JAPAN ACCEPTS SURRENDER TERMS
 The first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on 6
 August 1945. At first Tokyo radio merely stated that "a small
 number of B-29's invaded the skies today over Hiroshima and
 dropped both incendiaries and explosives." The full magnitude
 of what had happened was revealed gradually to the Japanese
 people the next day, when the radio announced:
 Yesterday, 6 August, the city of Hiroshima suffered
 considerable damage due to attacks by a small
 number of enemy B-29s.... The enemy used a new
 type of parachute bomb, which appears to explode in
 the air. With regard to its power, investigations are
 presently underway. However, we cannot be
 unconcerned....
 Since it is presumed that enemy planes will
 continue to use this new bomb, the authorities will
 point out measures to cope with it immediately. Until
 these measures are set forth, it is necessary for the
 people of the nation more than ever to strengthen the
 present air defense structure.
 On the other hand, as has been said many times,
 even if the enemy does raid with a small number of
 planes we must be careful not to regard the raids
 lightly. Furthermore, the enemy has used this new
 type of bomb and is simultaneously propagandizing
 the might of the present bomb in a big way....
 The dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
 was followed by an ultimatum from the four Allied Powers
 demanding total capitulation. The Japanese cabinet, according
 to monitored reports from the Japanese DOMEI news agency,
 deliberated at great length before reaching "unanimous"
 agreement on 11 August on a formal reply. On 14 August the
 Japanese domestic service alerted the population that "an
 important announcement" would be forthcoming the next day.
 On 15 August, DOMEI, in an English-language transmission,

 announced Japan's acceptance of the Allied surrender terms in a
 dispatch which stated:
 The Japanese Government yesterday sent a
 communication to the Allied Powers formally
 accepting the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration.
 'Iyhe communication was dispatched through the
 intermediary of the Swiss Government. The full text
 of the communication follows:
 'Communication of the Japanese Government of 14
 August 1945, addressed to the governments of the
 United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and
 China.
 With reference to the Japanese Government's note
 of 10 August regarding their acceptance of the
 provisions of the Potsdam Declaration and the reply
 of the governments of the United States, Great
 Britain, the Soviet Union, and China sent by
 American Secretary of State James Byrnes under the
 date of 11 August, the Japanese Government has the
 honor to communicate the following to the
 governments of the four powers:
 1-His majesty the emperor has issued an imperial
 rescript regarding the Japanese acceptance of the
 provisions of the Potsdam Declaration.
 2-His majesty the emperor is prepared to
 authorize and insure the signature of his majesty's
 government and the Imperial General Headquarters
 of the necessary terms for carrying out the provisions
 of the Potsdam Declaration.
 His majesty is also prepared to issue his commands
 to all the military, naval, and air authorities of Japan
 and all the forces under their control wherever located
 to cease active operations, to surrender arms, and to
 issue such other orders as may be required by the
 supreme commander of the Allied Forces for the
 execution of the above-mentioned terms.

 COMMUNIST INVASION TRIGGERS
 KOREAN WAR
 On 25 June 1950 North Korean forces invaded the Republic
 of Korea after claiming to have frustrated an invasion against
 areas north of the 38th parallel by troops of the Syngman Rhee
 "puppet government." In a long appeal "to all the Korean
 people" broadcast by Pyongyang Radio later that day, North
 Korean leader Kim I1-song placed all the blame for the fighting
 on the South Korean Government:
 ... Troops of the puppet government of country-
 selling traitor Syngman Rhee on June 25 invaded
 areas north of the 38th parallel along the entire
 breadth of the 38th parallel. The valiant Guard Corps
 of the Republic launched fierce battles in opposition
 to the enemy and frustrated the invasion of the troops
 of the Syngman Rhee puppet government.
 The government of the Democratic People's
 Republic of Korea, having examined the situation
 thus created, ordered our people's armed forces to
 launch decisive counterattacks and to [mop up the
 enemy].
 Under orders of the government of the Republic,
 the people's armed forces repulsed the enemy south of
 the 38th parallel and marched 10 to 15 kilometers
 south of the 38th parallel. The People's Armed Forces
 liberated many towns and cities, including Ongjin,
 Yonan, Kaesong, and Paekchon, and many villages.
 With all our patriotic democratic might we have
 struggled to attain unification for the fatherland by
 peaceful means, but the Syngman Rhee country-
 selling traitor gang has now provoked an internecine
 civil war in opposition to the people....
 Opposing the peaceful unification of the father-
 land, the Syngman Rhee traitor gang has long been
 preparing for an internecine civil war.... In a move to
 cover up its preparation for a civil war, the Syngman
 Rhee country-selling traitor gang has been inces-
 santly provoking clashes along the 38th parallel, in-
 flicting anxiety on the fatherland and people and
 attempting to shift to the authorities of our people's
 republic the responsibility for the provocative clashes.

 Dear brothers and sisters: A great danger confronts
 our fatherland and people. What are we to do to
 eliminate the danger facing our fatherland? The
 Korean people must-in this war against the
 Syngman Rhee country-selling traitor gang-[defend]
 the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and its
 constitution,  mop up the antipopular fascist
 Syngman Rhee puppet regime which has been formed
 in the southern half, liberate the southern half of our
 fatherland from the rule of the Syngman Rhee traitor
 gang, restore in the southern half the people's
 committees which are true people's governments,
 and, under the banner of the Democratic People's
 Republic of Korea, attain unification for the
 fatherland and found a powerful, democratic,
 independent Korea.
 This war-which we are carrying out in opposition
 to the internecine civil war which the Syngman Rhee
 country-selling gang has touched off-is a righteous
 war for the cause of the unification, independence,
 freedom, and democracy of the fatherland.
 Dear fellow countrymen, and I am addressing all
 the Korean people: If you do not want to once again
 become slaves to foreign imperialists, you must rise in
 unison in this country-saving struggle to throw over
 and smash the Syngman Rhee country-selling traitor
 gang. You must make all sacrifices and achieve
 unification for our fatherland....
 Our People's Armed Forces must demonstrate their
 valor, courage, and initiative in the struggle to defend
 to the death the democratic reforms in the northern
 half of the republic, to save our fellow countrymen in
 the southern half of the republic from reactionary
 rule, and to unify the fatherland under the banner of
 the people's republic. They must not spare their lives
 but must act with the utmost patriotic loyalty for the
 sake of the fatherland and the people and dedicate
 their last drop of blood to the unification of the
 fatherland....
 The people of the northern half must place all their
 business on a wartime footing and mobilize all their
 might and resources in order to mop up the enemy
 quickly and mercilessly. All business must be geared
 to the objectives of the war and to the mopping up of
 the enemy....

 Dear fellow countrymen, dear brothers and sisters:
 In order to quickly seize and eliminate the armed
 might and police state of the Syngman Rhee traitor
 gang, I call upon all the Korean people to rally more
 solidly than ever around the government of the
 Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Let us win
 our glorious victory, which will insure the unification
 and independence of the fatherland which we
 Koreans ardently desire!
 The history of mankind teaches us that the people
 who have risen in unison, risking even death in the
 struggle for freedom and independence of their
 country, have always emerged triumphant. The
 struggle of our people is a righteous one. Victory
 inevitably will be with our people. I firmly believe
 that our righteous struggle for the fatherland and the
 people will inevitably end in victory.
 The time has come now to unify our fatherland. Let
 us march forward valiantly with confidence in
 victory. Let us concentrate all our might on aiding our
 people's armed forces on the battlefronts. Let us
 concentrate all our might on mopping up and
 annihilating the enemy.
 Long live the Korean people, who have risen in
 unison in the nationwide popular war of righteous-

 MOSCOW ANNOUNCES DEATH OF
 STALIN
 On 4 March 1953 a Soviet Government statement monitored
 from TASS announced: "A great misfortune has befallen our
 party, our people-the grave illness of Comrade J. V. Stalin."
 The TASS announcement, the first official word of Stalin's
 illness, was followed on 6 March by a party-government
 statement on the Soviet leader's death. As transmitted by TASS
 it stated in part:
 The Central Committee of the Communist Party of
 the Soviet Union, the USSR Council of Ministers,
 and the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Council
 announce with profound sorrow to the party and all
 workers of the Soviet Union that on 5 March at 2150
 hours, after a grave illness, the chairman of the USSR
 Council of Ministers and secretary of the Central
 Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet
 Union, Josef Vissarionovich Stalin, died.
 The heart of the comrade and inspired continuer of
 Lenin's will, the wise leader and teacher of the
 Communist Party and the Soviet people-Josef
 Vissarionovich Stalin-has stopped beating. Stalin's
 name is infinitely dear to our party, to the Soviet
 people, to the workers of the whole world. Together
 with Lenin, Comrade Stalin created the mighty
 party of communists, reared and forged that party.
 Together with Lenin, Comrade Stalin was the inspirer
 and leader of the Great October Socialist Revolution,
 founder of the world's first socialist state.
 Continuing Lenin's immortal cause, Comrade
 Stalin led the Soviet people to a world-historic
 victory of socialism in our land. Comrade Stalin led
 our country to victory over fascism in the Second
 World War, which wrought a radical change in the
 entire international scene. Comrade Stalin armed the
 party and all the people with a great and lucid
 program of building communism in the USSR.
 The death of Comrade Stalin, the man who devoted
 all his life to the unselfish service of the communist
 cause, is a tremendous loss to the party, to the
 workers of the Soviet Union and to the whole world....

 DIEN BIEN PHU FALLS AFTER LONG
 SIEGE
 The siege of Dien Bien Phu, considered by many to be the
 crucial battle of the French-Indochinese war, was launched on 14
 March 1954 by 10,000 Vietminh troops. On 7 May, after 55 days
 of bitter fighting, the French fortress capitulated. The North
 Vietnamese News Agency, in claiming victory on 8 May 1954,
 stated:
 At 1700 hours on 7 May our troops occupied the
 entire Muong Thanh sector, after which the enemies
 at various support points signalled their surrender by
 raising the white flag.
 At about 1900 hours close to 2,000 enemies in Hong
 Kum, that is, in the southern subsector, tried to break
 the encirclement. Pursuit was undertaken. At 2200
 hours all the enemy forces that had tried to flee had
 been put out of action. By 2200 hours on 7 May,
 weapons were silent over the entire Dien Bien Phu
 front. The spokesman of the high command officially
 declared: "Our troops have destroyed all the enemy
 forces based at Dien Bien Phu."
 This morning, on 8 May, at 0800 hours the
 spokesman of the high command gave the official
 news: On the night of 6 May our troops launched a
 general attack against the defense system of Dien
 Bien Phu. After a night and day of extremely heroic
 struggle, our troops put out of combat on 7 May at
 1700 hours the entire enemy garrison of the Muong
 Thanh subsector. At 2200 hours on the same day our
 troops [took the entire] enemy garrison of the
 southern subsector.
 According to initial statistics, the number of enemy
 put out of action at Dien Bien Phu since the start of
 our attack amounts to 17 infantry battalions,
 including 7 paratroop battalions, 3 artillery units, and
 numerous engineer and motorized units. Fifty-seven
 enemy planes have been shot down or destroyed. The
 historic campaign at Dien Bien Phu has been a
 colossal success.

 victorious troops:
 Our Army has liberated Dien Bien Phu. I and the
 government affectionately extend congratulations to
 the cadres, fighters, people's laborers, [volunteer]
 youths, and local compatriots who so gloriously
 fulfilled their duties.
 Though the victory was great, it is only the
 beginning. We should not become boastful, nor
 should we indulge in complacency or underestimate
 the enemy. We are determined to carry out the
 resistance to wrest back independence, unification,
 democracy, and peace. Be it in the military or
 diplomatic field, only through a long-drawn-out and
 arduous struggle can we attain complete victory....

 SOVIET FORCES CRUSH HUNGARIAN
 UPRISING
 The Hungarian uprising in 1956 exemplified the importance
 of radio monitoring as a source of news from a nation in upheaval
 and virtually cut off from the outside world. Dissatisfied with the
 repressive policies of their government and inspired by student
 demonstrations in neighboring Poland, Hungarian students
 began holding mass protest meetings on 20 October 1956. The
 students' demands-for the formation of a new government
 headed by the popular Imre Nagy, the ouster of party and
 government officials associated with past repression, and
 withdrawal of Soviet troops-were quickly taken up by the
 general population. Armed violence flared on 23 October, when
 police fired into a Budapest demonstration attended by 100,000
 people. Within hours, the Budapest radio warned that "fascist
 reactionary elements" were attacking public buildings and the
 armed forces, and it announced that all meetings and
 demonstrations had been banned.
 Early the next morning,  it was heard carrying this
 announcement:
 The Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's
 Republic has ordered summary jurisdiction through-
 out the country to be applied against acts designed
 to overthrow the People's Republic-revolt, incite-
 ment, appeal and conspiracy to revolt, murder,
 manslaughter, arson, keeping of explosives and
 crimes committed by use of explosives, crimes com-
 mitted indirectly, force applied against official au-
 thorities, force against private persons, and illicit
 possession of arms. Crimes falling into the catego-
 ries of summary jurisdiction must be punished by
 death. This order is effective immediately.
 Minutes later the radio supplied these details:
 The dastardly armed attacks of counterrevolution-
 ary gangs during the night have created an extremely
 serious situation. The Bandits have penetrated into
 factories and public buildings and have murdered
 many civilians, members of the national defense
 forces, and fighters of the state security organs.

 The government organs had not reckoned with the
 bloody dastardly attacks and therefore applied for
 help, in accordance with the terms of the Warsaw
 Treaty, to the Soviet formations stationed in
 Hungary. The Soviet formations, in compliance with
 the government's request, are taking part in the
 restoration of order.
 The government is appealing to inhabitants of the
 capital to keep calm; it condemns the bloody havoc
 created by the counterrevolutionary gangs and
 supports everywhere the Hungarian and Soviet troops
 maintaining order. The liquidation of the counterrev-
 olutionary gangs is the most sacred cause of every
 honest Hungarian worker, of the people and the
 fatherland. At this moment we are concentrating all
 our strength on that task.
 As the fighting continued throughout the day, the radio
 alternated broadcasting offers of amnesty and warnings to those
 who persisted in fighting. Official pronouncements stressed that
 "opportunist and reactionary" forces were utilizing the disorder
 to jeopardize the country's socialist achievements and appealed
 to the people to help restore conditions to normal. Bowing to
 popular demand, party officials named Imre Nagy to the
 premiership and installed Janos Kadar, an early advocate of
 Titoism, as party first secretary.
 On 25 October Kadar and Nagy in a joint broadcast
 appealed for an end to the bloodshed and indicated that the
 people's demands for reform would be met. Kadar stated in part:
 Hungarian workers, dear comrades: The Politburo
 of our party has entrusted to me the post of first
 secretary of the Central Committee in a grave and
 difficult situation....
 The grave situation in which we have become
 involved is characterized by the fact that various
 elements are mixed up in it. The demonstration
 march of a section of the youth, which started
 peacefully in accordance with the aims of the
 overwhelming majority of the participants, after a few
 hours, in accordance with the intentions of
 antidemocratic and counterrevolutionary elements
 who joined them, degenerated into an armed attack
 against the state power of the people's democracy.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP85-00024R000300160001-4
 In this grave situation a decision had to be made. In
 complete unanimity, the leadership of our party
 decided that the armed attack against the power of
 our People's Republic had to be repelled by every
 possible means. The power of the working people, the
 working class and the peasantry embodied in the
 People's Republic is sacred to us and must be
 sacred to anyone who does not wish to reimpose on the
 neck of our people the old yoke, the rule of the
 capitalists, bankers, and large estate owners.
 This armed attack has wreaked bloodshed, destruc-
 tion, and serious material damage and will continue
 to do so until, with the help of our entire working people,
 we put a definite end to it.... It is the firm resolve of
 the party leadership, after the earliest possible
 restoration of order, to face frankly and without
 vacillation all those burning questions whose solution
 cannot be postponed. We want to solve these tasks
 without delay by deepening the democratization of
 state, party, and social life, with regard for realistic
 possibilities.
 Comrades, the Central Committee of the party
 proposes to the government that, after the restoration
 of order, the government should conduct talks with
 the Soviet Government in the spirit of complete
 equality between Hungary and the Soviet Union,
 fraternal cooperation, and internationalism, for the
 equitable and just settlement for both parties of the
 issues between the two socialist countries....
 Nagy, in the first of several speeches he was to broadcast to
 the nation in the next few days, said:
 Working people of Hungary: During the past few
 days our country has lived through tragic events....
 The new party leadership and government under my
 direction are resolved to draw the lessons of the tragic
 events to the maximum extent. Soon after restoration
 of order the National Assembly will meet. At that
 meeting I will submit an all-embracing and well-
 founded reform program.
 This program will embrace all important problems
 of our national life. The implementation of this
 program demands the reshuffling of the government
 on the basis of the rallying of the revived People's

 Patriotic Front and the broadest democratic national
 forces. The immediate cessation of fighting and the
 restoration of calm and order are absolutely
 indispensable for the realization of this program....
 As chairman of the Council of Ministers I hereby
 announce that the Hungarian Government is
 initiating negotiations on relations between the
 Hungarian People's Republic and the Soviet Union,
 among other things, on the withdrawal of Soviet
 forces stationed in Hungary on the basis of
 Hungarian-Soviet friendship and proletarian interna-
 tionalism and of equality between communist parties
 and socialist countries and national independence.
 I am convinced that Hungarian-Soviet relations
 built on that basis will provide a solid foundation for a
 sincere and true friendship between our peoples, for
 our national progress, and for our socialist future.
 The ordering back of those Soviet troops whose
 intervention in the fighting has been made necessary
 by the vital interest of our socialist order will take
 place without delay after the restoration of peace and
 order....
 Despite the appeals of Kadar and Nagy, the fighting
 continued to spread throughout Hungary. On 28 October, in
 another broadcast, Nagy reiterated his call for public support
 and alined his government with the cause of the people. He
 announced a general amnesty for all rebels, replacement of the
 security police with a new security force, and plans for Soviet
 withdrawal from Budapest. On 31 October, following a 30
 October announcement that the "reorganization of the party"
 had begun, Nagy informed the country:
 ... In the interest of the further democratization of
 the country's life, the cabinet abolishes the one-party
 system and places the country's government on the
 basis of democratic cooperation between the coalition
 parties, reborn in 1945. In accordance with this it sets
 up a smaller cabinet within the national government.
 The members of this cabinet are Imre Nagy, Zoltan
 Tildy, Bela Kovacs, Ferenc Erdei, Janos Kadar, Geza
 Losonczy, and a person to be nominated by the Social
 Democratic Party. The government will submit a

 proposal to the Presidential Council of the People's
 Republic to appoint Janos Kadar and Geza Losonczy
 as ministers of state....
 The Soviet army began mass evacuation of its troops from
 Budapest on 30 October amid conflicting reports that other
 Soviet forces were pouring into the country from Rumania. On 1
 November Budapest radio was monitored broadcasting the
 following news:
 Imre Nagy, chairman of the Council of Ministers
 and in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, today
 summoned Mr. Andropov, USSR ambassador
 extraordinary and plenipotentiary. Nagy told him the
 Hungarian Government had received authoritative
 information about the entry into Hungarian territory
 of new Soviet military formations. He demanded that
 these Soviet military formations be withdrawn at
 once.
 He informed the Soviet ambassador of Hungary's
 withdrawal from the Warsaw Treaty and at the same
 time declared Hungary's neutrality. The Hungarian
 Government, he said, is turning to the United
 Nations and seeks the help of the four great powers to
 safeguard its neutrality. The Soviet ambassador
 acknowledged the communication from the Hungari-
 an premier and foreign minister and promised to ask
 his government to give an immediate reply.
 On 4 November Soviet military forces, after pretending to
 yield to Hungarian pressure to withdraw, launched a massive
 armored invasion of Hungary. A stunned Nagy came on the air to
 say:
 This is Imre Nagy, the premier, speaking. In the
 early hours of this morning Soviet troops launched an
 attack on our capital city with the obvious intention
 of overthrowing the lawful democratic Hungarian
 Government. Our troops are fighting. The govern-
 ment is in its place. I hereby inform the people of
 the country and world public opinion of this.
 Only minutes before the Nagy announcement of the Soviet
 invasion, Ferenc Munnich, a member of the Nagy government,
 utilizing a transmitter normally reserved for the Hungarian
 radio's foreign-language broadcasts, announced that he, Janos

 Kadar, and several other "former members of the Imre Nagy
 government" were severing all relations with that government to
 form "the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Govern-
 ment." Munnich explained that their action stemmed from the
 Nagy government's inability to control the "ever-growing
 strength of the counterrevolutionary threat" to the country's
 socialist achievements.
 On 5 November the Soviet command, after occupying
 Budapest radio facilities, issued the following statement to
 the Hungarian population:
 We have taken action at the request of the
 Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government. That
 government informed us that forces of capitalist
 reaction were engaged in committing abuses in
 Hungary, that they wanted to restore the power of
 large landowners and capitalists, and that they
 wanted to deprive the workers of their achievements
 and the peasants of their land. Fascism appeared as a
 real danger.
 The government told us that Imre Nagy's
 government did not want to fight against reaction,
 and this enabled the counterrevolutionary gangs
 which had gained ground to murder workers and
 patriots, to ravage and to plunder. The government of
 Imre Nagy.had disintegrated and did not actually
 exist. There was total confusion in the country, and
 antipopular forces were committing abuses with
 impunity.
 In this situation the Hungarian Revolutionary
 Worker-Peasant Government requested the com-
 mand of the Soviet forces in Hungary to lend a helping
 hand in the liquidation of counterrevolutionary forces
 and in the restoration of order, internal peace, and
 calm. The command of the Soviet forces and we
 Soviet soldiers and officers are ready to extend this
 help to our Hungarian brethren....
 Within a week Soviet forces had crushed the revolt and
 installed Janos Kadar as the head of a Soviet-sponsored
 government. Nagy, after a period of asylum in the Yugoslav
 Embassy, was seized by the Soviet authorities and secretly
 executed.

 NASIR NATIONALIZES SUEZ CANAL
 In mid-July 1956 the United States and Great Britain
 announced that they were canceling large grants to Egypt for
 construction of the Aswan Dam. A few days later the World Bank
 followed suit and withdrew an even larger loan. Egyptian
 President Nasir reacted on 26 July by nationalizing the Suez
 Canal, asserting that the revenues would be used to finance the
 Aswan Dam. Speaking at a public rally marking the fourth
 anniversary of the overthrow of King Farouk, Nasir said over
 Cairo radio:
 Compatriots: When we look toward the future we
 feel that our battles have not ended. It is not easy for
 us to build ourselves up in the face of ambition-wide
 international ambition-international exploitation,
 and international plots. It is not at all easy to build
 ourselves and. our homeland, to achieve our political

 USSR ORBITS SPUTNIK, MANNED CRAFT
 In 1957 the Soviet Union startled the world by launching the
 first artificial earth satellite. An announcement by the Soviet
 news agency TASS on 4 October 1957 stated:
 . . . As a result of intense large-scale research
 conducted by Soviet research institutes and designing
 organizations, the world's first artificial earth
 satellite has been developed in the Soviet Union. On 4
 October 1957 the first satellite was successfully
 launched in the USSR.
 According to preliminary data, the carrier rocket
 gave the satellite the required orbital speed of some
 8,000 meters per second. At the present moment the
 satellite is looping the earth along an elliptical
 trajectory and can be observed in the light of the
 rising sun and setting sun through the simplest
 optical instruments, such as binoculars, telescopes,
 and so forth. . . . Reports on the subsequent
 movement of the first manmade satellite, launched in
 the USSR on 4 October, will be broadcast regularly by
 Soviet radio stations....
 Since the density of the rarefied upper layers of the
 atmosphere is not known for certain, no data are
 available at present for determining with precision
 the duration of the satellite's existence and the place
 where it will enter the dense layers of the atmosphere.
 It has been calculated that because of its tremendous
 speed the satellite will burn up on reaching the dense
 layers of the atmosphere at the height of several
 scores of kilometers....
 The successful launching of the first manmade
 satellite makes a tremendous contribution to the
 treasurehouse of world science and culture. The
 scientific experiment staged at such a great height is
 of great importance for fathoming the properties of
 cosmic space and for studying earth as part of our
 solar system. The Soviet Union proposes to send up
 several  more  artificial satellites during the
 International Geophysical Year. These will be bigger
 and heavier and will help to carry out an extensive

 program of scientific research. Artificial earth
 satellites will pave the way. for space travel, and it
 seems that the present generation will witness how
 the freed and conscious labor of the people of the new
 socialist society turns even the boldest of man's
 dreams into reality.
 A little more than 3 years later, on 12 April 1961, the Soviets
 succeeded in launching the first manned space vehicle. The first
 public announcement of this breakthrough came when Moscow
 radio informed Soviet audiences:
 Cosmonaut Gagarin has been launched successfully
 and is at present feeling well. Conditions in the cabin
 are functioning normally. The flight of the "Vostok"
 with Gagarin in orbit is continuing.
 Minutes later TASS disseminated the news to the world in
 the following dispatch:
 The world's first satellite spaceship "Vostok" with
 man on board was placed in a round-the-earth orbit
 in the Soviet Union 12 April. The pilot-space
 navigator of the satellite spaceship "Vostok" is a
 citizen of the USSR, Flight Maj Yuriy Alekseyevich
 Gagarin.
 The launching of the multistage space rocket was
 successful,  and after attaining the first escape
 velocity and the separation of the last stage of the
 carrier rocket the spaceship went into free flight on a
 round-the-earth orbit.
 According to preliminary data, the period of the
 revolution of the satellite around the earth is 89.1
 minutes. The minimum distance from the earth, at
 perigee, is 175 kilometers and the maximum, at
 apogee, is 302 kilometers; the angle of inclination of
 the orbit plane to the equator is 65 degrees 4 minutes.
 The spaceship with the navigator weighs 4,725
 kilograms, excluding the weight of the final stage of
 the carrier rocket.
 Two-way radio communications have been
 established and are being maintained with space
 navigator Gagarin. The frequency of the shortwave
 transmitters on board are 9,019 megacycles and
 20,006 megacycles and in the ultrashortwave range
 143.625 megacycles. The condition of the navigator in

 flight is being observed by means of radio telemetric

 Space navigator Gagarin satisfactorily withstood
 the placing of the satellite ship "Vostok" into orbit
 and at present feels well. The systems insuring the
 necessary vital conditions in the cabin of the satellite
 spaceship are functioning normally. The satellite
 spaceship "Vostok" with navigator Gagarin on board
 is continuing its flight in orbit.

 U-2 BLAMED FOR PARIS SUMMIT FAILURE
 On 1 May 1960, a U.S. high-altitude reconnaissance plane
 was downed on a mission over the Soviet Union. The fate of the
 plane was not publicly known until 5 May, when Soviet Premier
 Khrushchev, in a report to a USSR Supreme Soviet meeting
 broadcast by Moscow radio, stated:
 ... On May Day, early in the morning, at 0536
 Moscow time, an American aircraft crossed our
 frontier and continued its flight into the interior of
 our country. This aggressive act was immediately
 reported to the government by the minister of
 defense. A message from the government said: The
 aggressor knows what he is doing when he invades
 another's territory. If he remains unpunished he will
 launch new provocations. Therefore action should be
 taken and the aircraft shot down. This task was
 carried out and the aircraft was shot down!
 [Prolonged applause followed by a shout and further
 applause]
 The first investigation revealed that the plane
 belonged to the United States even though it had no
 identification marks. The identification marks had
 been painted over. [Stormy applause] A commission
 of experts is studying the data in our possession. It
 has been established that the plane crossed the state
 frontier of the Soviet Union from Turkey, Iran, or
 Pakistan.... After studying all the data the Soviet
 Government will send a stern protest to the United
 States and will warn it that if such aggressive actions
 against our country continue we retain the right to
 reply to them with the necessary measures to
 guarantee the security of our country. [Long and loud
 applause]....
 The Soviet leader also observed that with the Paris summit
 conference literally around the corner, "to send planes to invade
 the confines of a foreign country is poor preparation for such a
 meeting." This theme was picked up in subsequent Moscow
 radio commentaries, which emphasized that reactionary U.S.
 forces were doing their best to poison the atmosphere for the
 upcoming summit meeting. On 16 May, TASS transmitted the

 text of a statement by Premier Khrushchev announcing Soviet
 withdrawal from the summit conference. After noting that the
 United States intended to continue sending reconnaissance
 planes over Soviet territory and that this policy had been
 endorsed by the U.S. president, Khrushchev declared:
 How can the Soviet Government take part in talks
 under conditions of the actual threat posed by the
 U.S. Government, which declared that it will also in
 the future continue its violations of the USSR
 frontiers and that American aircraft have flown and
 will fly over Soviet territory? By this the U.S.
 Government has declared its intention to continue its
 unheard-of and unprecedented actions against the
 sovereignty of the Soviet state, which is a sacred and
 immutable principle in international relations.
 It follows from all this that for the success of the
 conference it is essential that the governments of all
 the states represented pursue an open and honest
 policy and solemnly declare that they will not commit
 any actions against one another which might
 represent a violation of the state sovereignty of
 powers. This means that if the U.S. Government is
 genuinely ready to cooperate with the governments of
 other powers in the interests of maintaining peace
 and strengthening confidence between the states it
 should, first, condemn the inadmissible provocative
 actions of the U.S. Air Force against the Soviet
 Union, and second, renounce the continuance of such
 actions and such a policy against the USSR in the
 future.
 It is self-evident that the U.S. Government in that
 case cannot but make those immediately guilty of the
 premeditated violation of the USSR state frontiers by
 American aircraft answer severely for it. Until this is
 done by the U.S. Government, the Soviet Govern-
 ment does not see the possibility of fruitful talks with
 the U.S. Government at the summit conference. It
 cannot be a participant in talks at which one par-
 ticipant has made treachery the basis of his policy
 toward the Soviet Union....

 CASTRO ESPOUSES MARXISM-LENINISM
 Following Fidel Castro's decision in January 1961 to sever
 relations with the United States, there was considerable
 controversy regarding the political orientation the Cuban leader
 would adopt in charting his country's future. His long speeches,
 broadcast by Havana radio, were thought by many to provide
 insight into his thoughts and were therefore closely studied.
 On 16 April 1961, Castro for the first time referred to the
 Cuban revolution as "socialist." During his 1961 May Day speech
 he announced that Cuba was entering into an "era of socialist
 construction" and spoke of the need for a "socialist constitution"
 to reflect the new system. But the speech that received most
 publicity came on 2 December 1961, when Castro declared in an
 address to university students:
 . .   There was a time when I was a political
 illiterate because of my class origin. We became
 revolutionaries because we had that vocation and
 because of native honesty. I did not come here to give
 a biography, but every time I found a truth I clung to
 it. When I left the university, I was not a Marxist-
 Leninist, but I was basically influenced by their work.
 We are much more revolutionary now than when we
 came into power. I have read "Das Kapital" up to
 page [390] but I plan to read further.
 Do I believe in Marxism? I believe absolutely in
 Marxism! [Long applause] Did I believe in it on 1
 January?I believed in it on 1 January. Did I believe in
 it on 26 July? I believed in it on 26 July. Did I
 understand it as I understand it today, after almost 10
 years of struggle? No, I did not understand it as I
 understand it today. There is a great difference
 between the way I understood it then and the way I
 understand it now. Did I have prejudices? Yes, I had
 prejudices! On 26 July? Yes. Could I call myself a
 mature revolutionary on 26 July? No, I couldn't call
 myself a mature revolutionary. I could call myself an
 almost mature revolutionary. Can. 1 call myself a
 mature revolutionary today? This would mean that I
 was satisfied with what I was, and of course I am not
 satisfied.

 Do I have doubts about Marxism? I understand that
 certain interpretations were incorrect, that it is
 necessary to make revisions. I do not have the
 slightest doubt. [Prolonged applause]
 The more experience we have, the more we know
 about imperialism. The more we see it in action in
 South Vietnam, South Korea, etc., the more we feel
 Marxist, sentimentally and emotionally. When we see
 the class struggle, we see the truths of Marx and
 Engels.... The works of Marx opened the way. They
 surpassed the works of other socialists. He had blind
 faith in his conclusions. His works show the real value
 of a revolutionary doctrine....
 Socialism does not have to be the same in each
 nation. Each nation must adjust socialism to its
 needs. Socialist truths are proven and established,
 but immense sacrifices were necessary to translate
 theory into reality.... Imperialism is hunger, misery,
 colonialism, discrimination, lack of culture, and ex-
 ploitation.  Hundreds  of millions  are spent on
 arms. . . . Imperialism pursues a criminal policy in
 America, Asia, and Africa. Cuba must be next to
 the people of China, South Vietnam, Angola, and
 so on. There is no halfway position between capi-
 talism and socialism....
 We had, in effect, to apply scientific socialism.
 That is why I began to tell you, with all candor, that
 we believe in Marxism, that we believe that it is the
 most correct, most scientific, the only true theory, the
 only true revolutionary theory. Yes, I state it here,
 with complete satisfaction [applause] and with full
 confidence: I am a Marxist-Leninist [pounds the
 table] and I shall be a Marxist-Leninist to the last
 day of my life. [Commotion and applause]....

 USSR MISSILE PULLOUT ENDS CUBAN CRISIS
 The worldwide tension created by the Soviet Union's covert
 installation of missiles in Cuba eased dramatically on 28 October
 1962 with Moscow's announcement that the missiles were being
 withdrawn. The announcement was contained in a message from
 Premier Khrushchev to President Kennedy. The first news of the
 Soviet decision to reach the president was an FBIS account of the
 message broadcast by Radio Moscow. The key paragraphs of the
 Khrushchev offer, as supplied to the White House by the FBIS
 Wire Service, read:
 Moscow Domestic Service in Russian at 1404 GMT
 on 28 October broadcasts a Khrushchev message to
 Kennedy. He declares: I received your message of 27
 October and I am grateful for your appreciation of the
 responsibility you bear for world peace and security.
 The Soviet Government has ordered the disman-
 tling of bases and dispatch of the equipment to the
 USSR. A few days ago Havana was shelled, allegedly
 by Cuban emigres; yet someone must have armed
 them for this purpose. Even a British cargo ship was
 shelled. Cubans want to be the masters of their
 country. The threat of invasion has upset the Cuban
 people.
 I wish to again state that the Soviet Government
 has offered Cuba only defensive weapons. I appreciate
 your assurance that the United States will not invade
 Cuba. Hence we have ordered our officers to stop
 building bases, to dismantle the equipment, and to
 send it back home. This can be done under U.N.
 supervision.
 We must not allow the situation to deteriorate [but
 must] eliminate hotbeds of tension, and we must see
 to it that no other conflicts occur which might lead to
 a world nuclear war....
 The importance of the radio as a means of rapid and direct
 communication between the two leaders during the crisis was
 emphasized in the president's reply to Khrushchev, which began:
 "I am replying immediately to your message of 28 October, which
 was transmitted by radio, although I have not yet received the
 official text, because I attach tremendous significance to acting
 quickly with a view to solving the Cuban crisis."

 NGO DINH DIEM OVERTHROWN BY
 MILITARY
 A group of South Vietnamese army generals opposed to the
 policies and attitudes of the Ngo Dinh Diem government
 launched a coup on 1 November 1963. Striking during the
 midday siesta, coup forces seized the radio station and other key
 locations in Saigon. Residents were informed that a new
 government supported by the army had been formed and were
 warned to stay off the streets. The radio also called on opposition
 troops to lay down arms. Although a late afternoon broadcast
 announced that the army was in control, resistance by members
 of the presidential palace guard continued through the night.
 Early the next morning, the radio announced:
 The revolutionary forces have heroically entered
 and occupied the Gia Long Palace, the last stronghold
 of the Ngo family and the place where for a long time
 the seeds of dictatorship, rottenness, injustice, and
 cruelty were sown. Faced with the gallant spirit of the
 revolutionary forces, Ngo Dinh Diem's henchmen laid
 down their weapons and surrendered. [The marines]
 and the armored corps heroically entered and
 occupied the Gia Long Palace.
 After wiping out the last resisting units, the
 revolutionary forces moved cautiously and called on
 the people inside the palace to surrender to avoid
 bloodshed. But Ngo Dinh Diem and his henchmen
 stubbornly refused to surrender. Therefore, the forces
 had to act vigorously-and they succeeded in
 occupying the entire Gia Long Palace.
 Ngo Dinh Diem and his entourage surrendered
 unconditionally to the revolutionary forces at 0645
 hours today. Ngo Dinh Diem and Ngo Dinh Nhu were
 taken in custody.
 Four hours later the radio carried the following brief
 statement:
 The Revolutionary Military Council respectfully
 informs compatriots that Ngo Dinh Diem and Ngo
 Dinh Nhu committed suicide this morning at 1045
 hours after they had been encircled and arrested by
 the army.

 GHANAIAN ARMY TOPPLES KWAME
 NKRUMAH
 Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah, considered one of
 the most politically secure of Africa's leaders, was overthrown by
 a military coup on 24 February 1966. At the time of his ouster,
 Nkrumah was en route to Hanoi, where he had planned to work
 for a Vietnam peace settlement. The army dissidents promptly
 took over the radio station and then moved to occupy other
 strategic buildings in the nation's capital, Accra. Colonel E. U.
 Kotoka, commander of the Second Brigade, made the following
 broadcast to the nation the morning of 25 February:
 I have come to inform you that the military, in
 cooperation with the Ghana police, took over the
 government of Ghana today. The myths surrounding
 Kwame Nkrumah have been broken. Parliament is
 dissolved and Kwame Nkrumah is dismissed from
 office. All ministers also are dismissed. The
 Convention People's Party is herewith disbanded. It
 will be illegal for any person to belong to it. We appeal
 to you to be calm and cooperative. All persons in
 detention will be released in due course. Please stay
 by your radio and await further details.
 Setting out their reasons for the overthrow several hours
 later, the coup leaders declared over Accra radio:
 The Ghana armed forces, in cooperation with the
 police, felt it necessary to take over the reins of power
 and dismiss former President Kwame Nkrumah, the
 Presidential Commission, and all ministers, and to
 suspend the constitution and dissolve Parliament.
 This action has been necessitated by the political and
 economic situation in the country. The concentration
 of power in the hands of one man has led to the abuse
 of individual rights and liberty. Power has been
 exercised by the former president capriciously. The
 laws have been suspended to the advantage of his
 favorites, and he has been running the country as his
 own personal property.

 economic system will collapse. The country is on the
 brink of national bankruptcy. . . . All of us have

 We have all suffered from shortages of essential
 commodities. The present mounting unemployment
 has affected almost every family. Rising prices have
 reduced our real incomes....
 Three days ago a new budget was introduced. In
 fact, this budget only increases the economic burden

 radical rethinking of our economic and financial
 policies. This will be done almost immediately, and
 we hope to be able to announce measures for curing
 our troubles within the next few days. The going will
 not be easy at first, but the future is definitely bright.
 Ghana should have been a much better country than
 it is now. With your cooperation we shall reverse the
 present trends....
 We shall honor all our international commitments

 membership in the OAU, the United Nations, and the

 CULTURAL REVOLUTION SWEEPS RED CHINA
 Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-tung,
 dissatisfied with the revolutionary outlook of many party and
 government officials, initiated a major political purge in 1966
 that was to foster years of factional strife and social disruption.
 High-level officials were replaced for "antiparty activities" in the
 "cultural revolution" that swept the country. The aims of the
 "cultural revolution" were clarified on 8 August 1966, when a
 plenary session of the CCP Central Committee issued a 16-point
 "decision" defining the goals of the "great proletarian cultural
 revolution." The decision noted the possibility of a difficult and
 protracted struggle but insisted that such upheaval was
 necessary to purify the nation's revolutionary spirit and thereby
 insure its future. The first two points of the decision, as
 disseminated by the New China News Agency, explained the
 situation to the Chinese people:
 1. The new stage of socialist revolution
 The currently developing great proletarian cultural
 revolution is a great one touching the souls of the
 people and is a more thoroughgoing and extensive
 new stage of China's revolutionary development of
 socialism.
 At the 10th plenary session of the Eighth CCP
 Central  Committee,  Chairman Mao said:  To
 overthrow a state power, it is always necessary, first of
 all, to create public opinion and to do ideological
 work. The revolutionary class does it; so does the
 counterrevolutionary class. Practice has borne out
 that this proposition of Chairman Mao's is absolutely
 correct.
 The bourgeoisie has been toppled, but it attempts
 to make use of the old ideology, old culture, old
 customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes to
 corrupt the masses and to win their hearts so as to
 achieve its restoration. The proletariat does just the
 contrary. It must take up and deal heavy blows
 against all the challenges of the bourgeoisie in the
 realm of ideology and make use of its own new
 ideology, new culture, new customs, and new habits
 to change the moral outlook of the whole society. At

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP85-00024R000300160001-4
 present our aim is to topple those who are in power
 but who follow the capitalist road, to criticize the
 bourgeois reactionary "authorities" in the field of
 academics, to criticize the ideology of the bourgeoisie
 and all exploiting classes, to transform education,
 literature, and art, and the superstructure which is
 incompatible with the socialist economic base so as to
 consolidate and develop the socialist system.
 2. The mainstream and zigzags
 The broad masses of workers, peasants,  and
 soldiers and the broad masses of revolutionary
 intellectuals and cadres are the main forces of this
 great  cultural revolution.  A great number of
 revolutionary youths who are otherwise unknown to
 the public have become brave forerunners. They have
 courage as well as wisdom. They use big-character
 posters and hold vigorous debates to air their opinions
 freely and to resolutely expose, criticize, and attack
 the covert and overt bourgeois representatives. In
 such a great revolutionary movement it is inevitable
 that they may have certain shortcomings, but their
 main revolutionary direction is always correct. This is
 the mainstream of the great proletarian cultural
 revolution which is advancing in this main direction.
 Since the cultural revolution is a form of revolution,
 it will inevitably meet with resistance. This resistance
 mainly comes from those who wormed their way into
 the party and rose to power but followed the capitalist
 road. It also comes from the habitual influences of the
 old society. At present this resistance remains strong
 and stubborn. However, the great proletarian cultural
 revolution is irresistible, because its situation is
 entirely favorable. A host of facts indicate that so long
 as the masses are boldly aroused, this resistance will
 soon be crushed.
 Because this resistance is comparatively large, ups
 and downs in the struggle are expected. These may
 even occur many times. There is no harm in these ups
 and downs. They will help the proletariat and other
 laboring masses, particularly the young generation,
 steel themselves, gain experience and learn their
 lessons, and understand that the revolutionary path
 is rough and full of zigzags.

 Several months after the start of the cultural revolution,
 FBIS radio behavior specialists noted that many provincial
 stations-in contrast to the normal broadcast pattern-had
 ceased to broadcast locally originated programs and were
 relaying Radio Peking material. Analysts studying this
 development concluded that regional station behavior provided
 an indication of which faction held the upper hand in the struggle
 for local supremacy. To accurately chart the frequent reversals in
 broadcast patterns-from solid relay of Radio Peking to local
 broadcasting and back again-FBIS instituted an extensive
 scanning operation to provide an up-to-date record of provincial
 transmitter patterns. On the basis of this data, supplemented by
 other information disseminated by Peking media, FBIS analysts
 wrote:
 The record indicates that a provincial radio is likely
 to carry local newscasts when one faction-any
 faction-is in control or believes it is in control. Local
 newscasts have been broadcast consistently, for
 example, in those areas which early in 1967 set up
 provincial-level revolutionary committees approved
 by Peking:  Heilungkiang, Kweichow,  Shansi,
 Shantung, and Shanghai. On the other hand,
 Sinkiang, with Wang En-mao maintaining control
 against apparent rebel efforts to topple him, also
 sustained local broadcasting through the spring and
 summer,  until the  end of August. Tsinghai
 "conservatives" broadcast local propaganda during
 the first three weeks of March assailing the "18
 August" group, which subsequently reseized the radio
 and proved itself to be the true leading Maoist
 organization in the province.
 The converse, in regard to relay of Peking, is not so
 simply stated. Clearly, in periods of local crisis, when
 no faction is in control, provincial radios have halted
 local broadcasting and reverted to solid relay of
 Peking-Wuhan, last June, prior to Peking's exposure
 of the "Wuhan incident," and Chengtu, last spring,
 prior to Peking's transfer of Chang Kuo-hua to
 Szechwan. But at other times and places, failure to
 broadcast local news cannot be taken as a reliable

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP85-00024R000300160001-4
 indicator of local chaos. In Fukien and Ningsia, for
 example, it is probable that some organ, presumably
 the PLA, has been maintaining control, and that one
 measure to this end has been a flat prohibition
 against local broadcasting by any faction.
 The importance of control of the radio station to
 any faction seeking provincial hegemony has been
 made manifest throughout the year, especially in
 proclamations that radios have been "seized" or
 "reseized." Sining radio explained last January that
 its delay in broadcasting reports of local support for
 the Shanghai movement was "because of obstructions
 put forth by a handful of persons in power in the
 Tsinghai provincial CCP committee . . . and the
 unwillingness of key responsible persons of this radio
 to broadcast them." The Tsingtao city radio in
 Shantung Province reported on 29 January that the
 PLA had prevented reactionaries from interfering
 with the broadcasting of rebel documents by Tsingtao
 radio,  "which had been placed under military
 control."
 The insight into the mechanics of the provincial radio
 shutdowns and the crucial importance of these transmitters in
 the leadership struggle was later substantiated when a year-old
 CCP Central Committee notice, contained in a Red Guard
 publication, became available in early 1968. The party directive
 decreed that "revolutionary masses" struggling against those in
 control of the radio stations must withdraw and conduct their
 struggles "away from the broadcasting stations." It further
 ordered that the local army command assume responsibility for
 such stations and insure that they "cease to edit and broadcast
 local programs and only rebroadcast the programs of Radio
 Peking."
 Red Guard newspapers and wall posters, although not
 usually available until months or years after initial publication,
 nevertheless contained timeless information of a basic and
 unique nature. They frequently provided detailed accounts of
 behind-the-scene developments, including several unpublished
 speeches by Mao Tse-tung heretofore unavailable to the Western

 world. In one such speech, as translated by FBIS, Mao was
 quoted as saying to a 24 October 1966 meeting of party func-
 tionaries:
 ... People must be allowed to make mistakes and
 make revolution as well. They are allowed to change.
 Let the Red Guards read "The True Story of Ah Q."
 This meeting is being handled better. At the last
 meeting we wanted to cram things in, but failed. We
 had no experience. At this meeting we have had 2
 months' experience. Altogether we have less than 5
 months' experience. In the 28 years of the democratic
 revolution, how many mistakes were made and how
 many people died? The socialist revolution has been
 going on for 17 years, but the cultural revolution has
 been going on for only 5 months. Experience can be
 gained only after at least 5 years.
 Nobody had thought, and I had not expected, that
 a single big-character poster, a Red Guard, and one
 big exchange of revolutionary experiences would
 create such turmoil in various provinces and cities.
 The students have made some mistakes too, but it is
 mainly we lords and squires who made the mistakes.
 (He asked Li Hsien-nien: "How did your meeting go
 today?" Li replied: "The Finance and Economics
 Institute held a denunciation meeting. I wanted to
 make a self-examination, but they did not allow me to
 speak.") You had better go and make your self-
 examination tomorrow, or they might think you were
 eluding them. (Li said, "I have to leave the country
 tomorrow.") You can tell them that in the past it was
 San Niang who taught her son, but that now it is the
 son who is going to teach San Niang. I think you look
 exhausted. If they do not tell you to make self-
 examination, you should insist on doing it. When they
 denounce you, you should admit your mistake. The
 mess was caused by the Central Committee.
 The Central Committee should be held responsible.
 The localities too should be held responsible. My own
 responsibility is the first and second fronts. Why
 divide it into the first and second fronts? First because
 [my] health is poor, and second because of the lesson
 of the Soviet Union. Malenkov was immature. He had
 not held power before Stalin's death. Every time he
 drank to [Stalin's] health he laid it on thick. So I

 wanted to have their prestige established before I
 died, but I had not expected that things would turn
 out the other way.
 Comrade T'ao Chu says that power has fallen to the
 hands of subordinates. But I deliberately let it fall
 that way. However, they have now set up
 independent kingdoms. There were many things
 about which they did not consult with me; for
 example, the land problem, the Tientsin speech, the
 cooperatives of Shansi, negation of investigation and
 study, and the acclamation of Wang Kuang-mei.
 These things should have been discussed by the
 Central Committee and decisions taken on them.
 Teng Hsiao-ping never consulted with me. He has
 never consulted with me about anything since 1949.
 In 1962 four vice premiers, Li Hsien-nien, Van Chen-
 lin, Li Fu-ch'un, and Po I-po, suddenly went to
 Nanking to see me. Later they went to Tientsin. I
 forthwith gave them my approval, and the four went
 home. But Teng Hsiao-ping never came....

 WAR BREAKS OUT IN MIDDLE EAST
 Full-scale war broke out in the Middle East on 5 June 1967
 when Egyptian and Israeli armed forces clashed in the Negeb
 Desert. The crisis situation began building with a series of border
 incidents early in the year. In late May, Egypt and other Arab
 states began massing troops along the Israeli frontiers, with Israel
 taking countermeasures. Tensions were further exacerbated
 when Egypt was able to implement a blockade of Israel's only
 southern seaport by forcing U.N. peace-keeping units to
 withdraw from the Strait of Tiran area. Washington's first
 notification that fighting was underway was an FBIS Wire
 bulletin reporting an Israeli radio announcement that Israeli
 forces had engaged an Egyptian armored force moving toward
 Israel. The magnitude of the action became apparent minutes
 later, when the. Israeli radio carried the following situation
 reports:
 A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Army has
 stated that fierce fighting started this morning
 between Egyptian planes and tanks, which began
 moving toward Israel, and the Israeli Defense Army
 forces which rushed to repel them.
 Here is a report just received. The army spokesman
 announced that the Egyptians this morning opened
 an air and land attack. Egyptian armored forces
 moved at dawn toward the Negeb. Our forces went
 out to meet them and repel them.
 Many Egyptian jet planes were seen on radar
 coming toward the country's shores. A similar
 attempt was made in the Negeb area. Israeli Air Force
 planes flew against the enemy planes. Air clashes
 developed and continue.
 The first confirmation of the fighting from an Arab source
 came 50 minutes after the Israeli announcement, when Cairo
 radio informed the Egyptian nation:
 Citizens: A military source has stated that Israel
 began its aggression at 0600 GMT hours today with
 air raids over Cairo and over all parts of the UAR. Our
 planes and antiaircraft guns have engaged them.

 Two hours later Cairo radio's transmissions to the Arab
 world carried the following official communique:
 At 0600 GMT the Israeli enemy launched a full-
 scale land and air attack against the United Arab
 Republic. In the air, Israeli aircraft carried out raids
 on a number of military airports in the Sinai area and
 the canal zone and on one of the military airfields
 near Cairo.
 On land, the Israeli forces carried out numerous
 attacks on all fronts. An offensive is now underway on
 fronts along the Egyptian borders. Sharm ash-
 Shaykh is being raided from the air.
 Beyond any doubt, Israel has started a full
 aggression in all sectors. Despite all attempts by the
 Israeli enemy to allege that the United Arab Republic
 started it, this fact is obvious from the pattern and
 development of events....

 VIETNAM PEACE TALKS OPEN IN PARIS
 On 3 April 1968 North Vietnam responded to President
 Johnson's 31 March speech announcing a limitation of U.S. air
 and naval attacks by issuing a government statement declaring
 its willingness to talk with the United States. The statement
 expressed readiness to appoint a representative "to contact the
 U.S. representative with a view to determining the unconditional
 cessation of bombing of North Vietnam so that talks may start."
 After more argument over the meeting site, the DRV Foreign
 Ministry on 3, May proposed that the talks start on 10 May in
 Paris. The statement, as transmitted by the North Vietnamese
 News Agency, said:
 On 31 March 1968, U.S. President L. B. Johnson
 announced the limited bombing of North Vietnam
 and once again expressed a desire to enter into talks
 with the DRV.
 On 3 April 1968, the DRV Government issued a
 statement making clear its stand and attitude on this
 subject and its readiness to appoint its representative
 to contact the U.S. representative. But due to the not
 serious attitude of the U.S. Government, the contacts
 which are to lead to talks between the two sides have
 not begun as yet....
 One month has elapsed since the DRV Government
 issued the above-mentioned statement. The prelimi-
 nary contacts which are to lead to the talks between
 the two sides should have been held. But the U.S.
 Government has deliberately resorted to dilatory
 maneuvers.
 In face of such a situation, the DRV Government is
 of the view that the formal talks between Hanoi and
 Washington should be held immediately. The DRV
 Government has decided to appoint Minister Xuan
 Thuy as its representative to enter formal talks with
 the U.S. Government's representative, to determine
 with the U.S. side the unconditional cessation of the
 U.S. bombing raids and all other acts of war against
 the DRV, and then hold talks on other problems of
 concern to the two sides.

 The DRV Government welcomes the French
 Government's willingness to offer Paris as a site for
 the talks between the DRV and the United States, as
 stated by French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville
 on 18 April 1968. The DRV Government considers
 that Paris, like Phnom Penh and Warsaw, is a
 suitable place for the formal talks between the two
 sides. These formal talks will begin on 10 May 1968 or
 several days thereafter.
 The U.S. Government must positively respond to
 the good will attitude of the DRV Government and
 stop all dilatory maneuvers so that the formal talks
 may start at an early date....

 BLOC ARMIES END CZECH FREEDOM BID
 Concerned over the liberal policies carried out by the
 government of Alexander Dubcek and the disquieting response
 they elicited abroad, the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary,
 Bulgaria, and the German Democratic Republic sent troops to
 invade Czechoslovakia on the night of 20 August 1968. The first
 news of the invasion came in the early hours of 21 August, when
 Prague radio reported:
 In a short while the Czechoslovak radio will be
 broadcasting an extremely important news item. Stay
 at your receivers. Awaken all your fellow citizens.
 [Brief musical interlude].... Yesterday troops of the
 Soviet Union, the GDR, the Polish People's Republic,
 and Hungary crossed the frontiers of the Czechoslo-
 vak Socialist Republic. All citizens are requested to
 maintain quiet and not to offer any resistance.
 Immediately after the announcement, the radio broadcast
 the following statement by the Presidium of the Czechoslovak
 Communist Party Central Committee:
 To the entire people of the Czechoslovak Socialist
 Republic: Yesterday, on 20 August around 2300,
 troops of the Soviet Union, the Polish People's
 Republic, the GDR, the Hungarian People's
 Republic, and the Bulgarian People's Republic
 crossed the frontiers of the Czechoslovak Socialist
 Republic. This took place without the knowledge of
 the president of the republic, the president of the
 National Assembly, the premier, or the first secretary
 of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central
 Committee.
 In the evening hours the Presidium of the
 Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee
 held a session and discussed preparations for the 14th
 Czechoslovak Communist Party congress.
 The Czechoslovak Communist Party Central
 Committee Presidium appeals to all citizens of our
 republic to maintain calm and not to offer resistance
 to the troops on the march. Therefore, our army,

 security corps, and people's militia have not received
 a command to defend the country.
 The Czechoslovak Communist Party Central
 Committee Presidium regards this act not only as
 contrary to the fundamental principles of relations
 between socialist states but as a denial of
 fundamental norms of international law. All leading
 functionaries of the state, the Communist Party, and
 the National Front: Remain at your posts as
 representatives of the people and organs to which you
 have been properly elected according to the laws and
 other norms valid in the Czechoslovak Socialist
 Republic.
 Constitutional  functionaries  are  immediately
 convening a session of the National Assembly of our
 republic, and the Presidium is at the same time
 convening a plenum of the Central Committee to
 discuss the situation.
 The Czechoslovak people reacted with a widespread
 campaign of passive resistance. Despite the Soviet seizure of the
 Prague broadcasting facilities on 21 August, Prague radio
 employees resumed broadcasts later in the day from a secret
 location and continued on the air uninterruptedly by constantly
 switching frequencies. By 25 August clandestine radio stations
 were in operation throughout the country, while the Soviets, in
 an effort to portray Czech backing for the invasion, had
 established a puppet station-Radio Vltava. The authentic
 Czech stations warned their listeners about this station,
 remarking acidly that it was identifiable by the poor-quality
 Czech and Slovak spoken. On 28 August, FBIS analysts provided
 the following report on the role the radio played in the week's
 events:
 The free Czechoslovak radio network that had been
 used throughout the occupation to inform the
 populace, publicize the continued functioning of legal
 government and party organs, and buttress the
 negotiating position of the Czechoslovak leaders in
 Moscow, was used following the leaders' return to air
 the speeches in which Dubcek and his associates
 sought to gain public acceptance of the Moscow
 compromise. The speeches and statements empha-

 sized that the outcome was the best the Czechoslovak
 leaders could have achieved considering the "political
 reality" of the occupation. They stressed that it was
 only by the acceptance of Soviet troops for an
 unspecified period, curbs on the media, and possible
 other limitations on freedom that the present
 leadership was allowed to remain in power and avoid
 either a bloodbath or a more repressive regime. In
 various appeals and speeches, the leaders conveyed,
 circumspectly, the idea that they were playing for
 time. They sought, also carefully, to assure the people
 that they had not basically compromised the regime's
 liberal orientation and that everything possible would
 be done to sustain the democratization process.
 The Czech radio was still broadcasting on 28
 August, as on the 27th, on at least seven transmitters,
 using frequencies in all broadcasting bands. On the
 28th the radio began identifying itself, when
 broadcasting from Czech studios, as the "legitimate
 transmitter of [name of studio]" and, when
 broadcasting from Slovak studios, as "the legitimate
 and still free transmitter of [name of studio]."
 The Soviet-operated "Radio Vltava," first heard on
 the day of the invasion, was still broadcasting on the
 28th on two mediumwave. frequencies, carrying
 communiques and appeals to the military forces and
 the civilian population and rebroadcasting Soviet
 commentaries. Another pro-Soviet transmitter, "The
 Workers' Voice of the Republic," had been on the air
 since 26 August broadcasting similar material.
 Concurrently, Radio Moscow was on the air from 21
 August with a nonstop program in both Czech and
 Slovak on an increased number of shortwave outlets
 plus a number of Czech transmitters preempted by
 the occupying forces.
 The round-the-clock Moscow broadcasts to
 Czechoslovakia included large numbers of commen-
 taries and Soviet press articles also carried in other
 broadcasts to both bloc and nonbloc audiences. Some
 Soviet press articles were broadcast only in Czech and
 Slovak, however, and station commentaries broad-
 cast exclusively to the Czechoslovak audience included
 commentaries on traditional Soviet-Czechoslovak
 friendship, on support for the military action in

 Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, and Hungary, as
 well as among Soviet citizens, and on the urgency of
 "defending socialism" against hostile forces. These
 broadcasts also decried attempts by "anti-socialist
 forces" to "provoke" the Czech people against the
 occupying troops and on the "fraternal" task
 undertaken by the Soviet soldiers.

 FIGHTING ERUPTS ON SINO-SOVIET BORDER
 The Sino-Soviet divergence, which began in the late 1950's
 as an ideological dispute over political strategy, bloc relations,
 and leadership of the international communist movement,
 developed into open hostility and finally into serious border
 clashes in 1969. Relations between the two countries seriously
 deteriorated under the impact of the Chinese cultural revolution,
 and the Sino-Soviet alliance-once hailed as the cornerstone of
 the socialist camp-became a thing of the past. Long-standing
 border tensions were seriously exacerbated in 1968 after the
 Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia, with Chinese charges that
 Soviet troops were massing along China's borders and
 committing provocations. In March 1969 these tensions exploded
 in bloody firefights over a disputed island on the two countries'
 Ussuri River border. Both sides took the unprecedented step of
 publicizing the clashes in an exchange of diplomatic notes. The
 Soviet protest, as monitored from TASS, declared:
 The Soviet Government states the following to the
 Government of the People's Republic of China:
 The Chinese authorities staged an armed
 provocation on the Soviet-Chinese frontier in the area
 of the frontier point Nizhne-Mikhaylovka (Daman-
 skiy Island) on the Ussuri River at 4 hours 10 minutes,
 Moscow time, on 2 March. A Chinese detachment
 crossed the Soviet state frontier and proceeded
 toward Damanskiy Island. The Chinese side, armed
 with machineguns and automatic weapons, suddenly
 opened fire on Soviet frontier guards protecting this
 area. The actions of the Chinese intruders were
 supported from an ambush by fire from the Chinese
 bank of the Ussuri River. Over 200 Chinese soldiers
 took part in this provocative attack on Soviet frontier
 guards. As a result of this gangster raid some Soviet
 frontier guards were killed or wounded.
 The impudent armed incursion into Soviet territory
 was an organized provocation of the Chinese
 authorities and has the purpose of aggravating the
 situation on the Soviet-Chinese frontier.
 The Soviet Government lodges a sharp protest with
 the Government of the People's Republic of China

 against the dangerous provocative actions of the
 Chinese authorities on the Soviet-Chinese frontier.
 The Soviet Government demands an immediate
 investigation and the strictest punishment of the
 persons responsible for the organization of the
 aforesaid provocation. It insists that immediate steps
 be taken which would preclude any violation of the
 Soviet-Chinese frontier.
 The Soviet Government reserves the right to take
 resolute steps to cut short provocations on the Soviet-
 Chinese frontier and warns the Government of the
 People's Republic of China that the entire
 responsibility for possible consequences of the
 adventuristic policy designed to aggravate the
 situation on the frontiers between China and the
 Soviet Union rests with the Government of the
 People's Republic of China.
 In relations with the Chinese people the Soviet
 Government is guided by sentiments of friendship,
 and it is going to continue this line in the future. But
 the reckless provocative actions of the Chinese
 authorities will be met on our side by a rebuff and will
 be resolutely cut short.
 Moscow, 2 March 1969.
 The Chinese version of the incident, as monitored from
 NCNA, stated:
 On 2 March 1969 Soviet frontier guards intruded
 into the area of Chenpao Island, Heilungkiang
 Province, China, and killed and wounded many
 Chinese frontier guards by opening fire on them, thus
 creating an extremely grave incident of bloodshed....
 The so-called "note of protest" from the Soviet Union
 is the fond trick of thief crying thief played by the
 Soviet revisionist renegade clique; it is the gangster
 logic of this clique which has taken over the mantle of
 Tsarist Russian imperialism and pushed the social
 imperialist policy of aggression. The Chinese
 Government sent a note of protest to the Soviet
 Government on 2 March 1969, exposing the true
 picture of how the Soviet frontier guards intruded
 into Chinese territory and carried out armed

 provocations, thus creating the grave incident of
 bloodshed. The full text of the note follows:
 Note of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the
 People's Republic of China to the Soviet Embassy in
 China; 2 March 1969:
 On the morning of 2 March 1969 Soviet frontier
 guards intruded into the area of Chenpao Island,
 Heilungkiang Province, China, and killed and
 wounded many Chinese frontier guards by opening
 fire on them, thus creating an extremely grave border
 armed conflict. Against this, the Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs of the People's Republic of China is instructed
 to lodge the strongest protest with the Soviet
 Government.
 At 0917 hours on 2 March, large numbers of fully
 armed soldiers, together with four armored vehicles
 and cars sent out by the Soviet frontier authorities,
 flagrantly intruded into the area of Chenpao Island,
 which is indisputable Chinese territory, carried out
 blatant provocations against the Chinese frontier
 guards who were on normal patrol duty, and were the
 first to open cannon and gun fire, killing and
 wounding many Chinese frontier guards. The Chinese
 frontier guards were compelled to fight back in self-
 defense when they reached the end of their
 forbearance, after repeated warnings to the Soviet
 frontier guards had produced no effect.
 This grave incident of bloodshed was entirely and
 solely created by the Soviet authorities, which have
 long been deliberately encroaching upon China's
 territory,  carrying out armed provocations and
 creating ceaseless incidents of bloodshed.
 The Chinese Government firmly demands that the
 Soviet Government punish the culprits of this
 incident and immediately stop its encroachment
 upon China's territory and its armed provocations,
 and reserves the right to demand compensation from
 the Soviet side for all the losses suffered by the
 Chinese side. The Chinese Government once again
 sternly warns the Soviet Government: China's sacred
 territory brooks no violation; if you should willfully
 cling to your reckless course and continue to provoke
 armed conflicts along the Sino-Soviet border, you will
 certainly receive resolute counterblows from the

 consequences arising therefrom.

 HO CHI MINH DIES OF HEART ATTACK
 The initial announcement that DRV leader Ho Chi Minh
 was seriously ill came on 3 September 1969, when the following
 Hanoi broadcast was heard in the early morning hours:
 Here is a communique on President Ho Chi Minh's
 health: Over the past few weeks, President Ho Chi
 Minh has not been well. Our party and state have
 been concentrating all capabilities and means to care
 for him. A collective of professors and medical doctors
 have been attending him day and night. We hereby
 inform our compatriots of the President's condition.
 Hanoi, 4:00 a.m. 3 September 1969. The Central
 Committee of the Vietnam Workers Party, the
 Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the
 Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Council of
 Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
 Shortly thereafter, the radio announced that Ho had taken a
 turn for the worse. The news that the DRV leader had died in
 mid-morning on 3 September was not made public until early on
 4 September. At that time Hanoi radio was monitored saying
 that he had suffered a "sudden, very severe heart attack." The
 radio stated:
 . . . The Central Committee of the Vietnam
 Workers Party, the Standing Committee of the
 National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of
 Vietnam, the Council of Ministers of the Democratic
 Republic of Vietnam, and the Presidium of the

 Democratic Republic of Vietnam, passed away at 9:47
 on 3 September 1969 after a sudden, very severe heart
 attack, at the age of 79.

 of qualified and well-equipped professors and doctors
 with seeking by all means to cure him. Everybody had

 ailment, President Ho Chi Minh has departed

 the Presidium of the Vietnam Fatherland Front

 aggressors, liberating the south of our country, and

 materializing the lofty aspiration cherished by
 President Ho Chi Minh-the building of a peaceful,

 HAVANA ENDORSES URBAN TERRORIST
 TACTICS
 The successes of urban terrorists in Latin America during
 the late 1960's prompted Cuba, long an advocate of rural-based
 guerrilla struggle, to endorse urban terrorism as a revolutionary
 strategy in 1970. This was done by publicizing in Havana's
 Tricontinental magazine a document revered in Latin American
 revolutionary circles, "The Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla,"
 by Carlos Marighella. The Tricontinental translation, provided
 by FBIS, was prefaced with the following editor's note:
 The front and back covers of our issue number 16
 are dedicated to the urban actions that are occurring
 in various Latin American countries-Brazil,
 Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay, etc.-because of those
 who have said "enough!" to exploitation and have
 decided to forge a new destiny for our peoples.
 Outstanding  in guerrilla warfare was Carlos
 Marighella, who was one of its strongest advocates, in
 theory and in practice. Months before he fell, struck
 down by the Brazilian dictatorship's bullet,
 Marighella left the summary of his rich combat
 experience in the Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla.
 Conceived as an instrument of the armed struggle in
 the cities of Brazil, the Minimanual contains valuable
 lessons useful to any revolutionary. By publishing it
 in its entirety in "Starting Points," Tricontinental
 fulfills its mission of spreading to the fullest extent
 possible revolutionary ideas, strategy, and tactics....
 Among his writings, the Minimanual has special
 importance. The work examines exhaustively the
 conditions, characteristics, necessities, and methods
 of the guerrilla war and the urban guerrillas, broadly
 demonstrating his sense of detail and organization
 and his logical clarity.... For the experiences it turns
 over in its pages and for its detailed foresight, the
 Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla will become one
 of the principal books of every man who, as a
 consequence of the inevitable battle against the
 bourgeoisie and imperialism, takes the road of armed
 rebellion.
 Marighella's Minimanual is a detailed compendium of
 urban terrorist techniques targeted primarily against "the
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP85-00024R000300160001-4
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP85-00024R000300160001-4
 government,  big  capitalists,  and foreign  imperialists,
 particularly North American." The 14 "action models" it lists
 include assault, hijacking, sabotage, ambushes, kidnapping,
 assassination, and general terrorism. In advocating execution
 and kidnapping as acceptable political tools, Marighella writes:
 Execution is the killing of a North American spy, of
 an agent of the dictatorship, of a police torturer, of a
 fascist personality in the government involved in
 crimes and persecution against patriots, of a stool
 pigeon, informer, police agent, or police provocateur.
 Those who go to the police of their own free will to
 make denunciations and accusations, who supply
 clues and information and put the finger on people,
 also must be executed when they are caught by the
 urban guerrilla.
 Execution is a secret action in which the least
 possible number of urban guerrillas are involved. In
 many cases, the execution can be carried out by one
 sniper, patiently, alone and unknown, operating in
 absolute secrecy and in cold blood.
 Kidnapping is capturing and holding in a secret
 spot a police agent, a North American spy, a political
 personality, or a notorious and dangerous enemy of
 the revolutionary movement. Kidnapping is used to
 exchange or liberate imprisoned revolutionary
 comrades, or to force suspension of torture in the jail
 cells of the military dictatorship.
 The kidnapping of personalities who are known
 artists or sports figures or are outstanding in some
 other field but who have evidenced no political
 interest can be a useful form of propaganda for the
 revolutionary and patriotic principles of the urban
 guerrilla, provided it occurs under special circum-
 stances and the kidnapping is handled so that the
 public sympathizes with it and accepts it.
 The kidnapping of North American residents or
 visitors in Brazil constitutes a form of protest against
 the penetration and domination of United States
 imperialism in our country. N \1   /I

 CAMBODIAN ASSEMBLY DEPOSES SIHANOUK
 On 18 March 1970, Prince Sihanouk was deposed as
 Cambodia's chief of state. The prince, who had been in France
 for medical treatment, was en route home at the time via Moscow
 and Peking. During Sihanouk's lengthy absence from the
 country, Cambodia's once cordial relations with the Viet Cong
 and DRV Government had become severely strained. The Viet
 Cong and North Vietnamese were ignoring a government request
 that they abandon their sanctuaries along the borders, and the
 National Assembly, sitting in almost continuous session,
 ostensibly to discuss domestic matters, had become a forum for
 nationalist sentiments.
 On the morning of 18 March a special government
 communique broadcast over the Phnom Penh radio warned of
 the subversive activities of the "Vietnamese and their agents"
 and announced that the city's police chief had been removed
 from his post "to restore a peaceful atmosphere." The
 communique also advised that the government was taking other
 "effective countermeasures" to protect the country. Shortly
 afterward, news agencies reported that the Phnom Penh airport
 had been closed to traffic and that all cable communications had
 been cut. Phnom Penh radio, now the sole source of information
 on events in the country, late that afternoon broadcast the
 following government communique:
 In view of the political crisis created in recent days
 by the chief of state, Prince Sihanouk, and in
 conformity with the constitution of Cambodia, the
 National Assembly and the Council of the Kingdom
 during a plenary session held on 18 March 1970 at
 1300 have unanimously agreed to withdraw their
 confidence in Prince Norodom Sihanouk. As of 1300
 18 March 1970, Prince Norodom Sihanouk shall cease
 his function as chief of state of Cambodia. Mr Cheng
 Heng,  chairman of the National Assembly, is
 entrusted with the function of chief of state until the
 election of a true chief of state in conformity with the
 national constitution.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP85-00024R000300160001-4
 This was followed immediately by a special message from
 the new acting chief of state:
 My dear and beloved compatriots: The National
 Assembly and Council of the Kingdom during a
 plenary session held on 18 March 1970 at 1300
 unanimously agreed by [open] vote to withdraw their
 confidence in Prince Norodom Sihanouk as chief of
 state  of Cambodia.  In  conformity with the
 constitution, as chairman of the National Assembly, I
 must assume the function of chief of state until a new
 chief of state is elected.
 On this occasion, I solemnly proclaim that
 Cambodia will continue to follow the same policy-
 that is, one of independence, neutrality, and
 territorial integrity-and that Cambodia will
 continue to recognize and respect all treaties signed
 previously. Finally, I appeal to bonzes of the two
 sects-in particular, the two chief bonzes-to kindly
 call on officials, students, all youth, and all strata of
 the people to maintain order so that our fatherland
 may remain prosperous.
