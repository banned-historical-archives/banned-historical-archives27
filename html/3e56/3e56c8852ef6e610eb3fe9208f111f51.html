 UPHOLD THE CONCEPT OF ONE DIVIDING INTO TWO; ATTAIN A STILL HIGHER GOAL
 Beijing RED FLAG.in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 pp 2-6
 [Speech by Comrade Hu Yaobang on 27 December 1981 while meeting with repre-
 sentatives attending a national conference on the creation of films]
 [Text]  I am a rooter for ball games, a rooter for radio and television
 broadcasts, a rooter for the movie industry.  In short, I am your avid
 supporter.  Our comrades of all party committees and propaganda depart-
 ments must assign such a task for themselves:  to be rooters, to cheer
 everybody up.
 Literature and art, like sports, have a broad mass character.  We must
 organize and lead the people to use all means possible to boost anything
 which has a broad mass character, which is beneficial to the people,
 which can inspire and educate people to aim high and which is popular
 among the people.  Because only by doing this can we prove ourselves to
 have what our party constantly claims as a mass viewpoint.
 The year 1981 will pass and a new year will come in only 4 more days.  How
 should we view our work this year and greet the new year?  Let me present
 these remarks to you comrades:  Uphold the concept of one divides into two;
 attain a still higher goal.  If there should be a "dui Tian" [a Chinese
 couplet often written and mounted on scrolls to be hung on the wall] for
 the new year, can these remarks be considered as fit for this purpose?
 All our comrades must uphold the concept of one divides into two at all
 times.  This is a conclusion reached at the meeting sponsored by the party
 Central Committee for the first secretaries of various provinces, munici-
 palities and autonomous regions to review the work of this year.  To view
 things with the concept of one divides into two, we can see, on the one
 hand, our party has achieved great progress in its work and the result has
 generally been good, but, on the other, we can also see that we have not
 been performing very well in other work, including that in which we ought
 to have done better, such as political and ideological work, [stabilizing
 the] commodity prices and so forth.  How does literary and art work fare?
 I hope you comrades will have this issue analyzed with the scientific
 attitude of one divides into two so that the work next year will be done
 better.

 As far as the movie industry is concerned, we must fully affirm that much
 progress was made during the past several years, and that new progress has
 been made this year.  Therefore, good and generally acceptable movies have
 been the mainstream.  This also tells that the majority of our comrades
 have.been working very hard.  Some middle-aged and young directors and
 playwrights have been maturing very quickly.  Our workers, peasants,
 soldiers and intellectuals, our Communist Party members, CYL members and
 Young Pioneers, in short people of all nationalities throughout the coun-
 try, male and female, young and old, people residing in cities and rural
 areas, are pleased with and welcome the accomplishments and progress
 achieved by the people of the movie industry and their hard work and con-
 tributions.  They can see these accomplishments with their own eyes, and
 they will remember them and are thankful for them.  This is what we usually
 mean as the rights and wrongs of a case will be judged by the public.  This
 is a fact, and this is the kind of confidence we should have.
 Of course, there is another side of the coin.  This is to say that certain
 movies are really not good enough, that certain comrades have not worked
 hard enough, and that relatively serious shortcomings and errors still can
 be found in certain works and among certain individual comrades.  The two
 main problems are simply thus:
 First, the political sentiments of certain works and certain comrades are
 not healthy.  Where are these unhealthy political sentiments reflected?
 They are reflected mainly in their attitude of ignoring, and even writing
 off, the great accomplishments achieved by the Chinese people in pursuing
 their socialist cause, and in their attitude of blaming the entire state,
 the entire revolutionary rank and file and the entire socialist system for
 the mistakes in our revolutionary process and for the destruction done by
 the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques.   Because of such
 attitudes, they conclude that communism has no future, and that communism
 is but a dim illusion.  That is what I mean, by unhealthy political thinking
 or political sentiments.
 Why do we have to criticize Comrade Bai Hua?  It is because his work
 "Unrequited Love" is unhealthy in political thinking and harmful to the
 people's minds.  Things have now turned out very well since he has been
 'criticized and since he has realized his mistakes and made a self-
 criticism.   Comrade Bai Hua is still a party member and a writer, and he
 will continue to write.  Comrade Bai Hua produced some good works in the
 past.  We hope he will'produce more good works.  People can see from this
 case that the party Central Committee's policies and ways of doing things
 are vastly different from those in the past, and these differences have
 demonstrated that our party has indeed learned a beneficial lesson from
 its mistakes and setbacks and has become more mature.
 There is no doubt that we must convincingly and seriously criticize
 erroneous things.  Here, we must adhere to truths and never try to save
 face.  It is best that one conduct self-criticism earnestly instead of
 shielding a shortcoming or fault.  The comrades, readers and audience must
 help him.  This is not only true for writers, but also true for the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 responsible comrades of our party committees at all levels.  Can we criticize
 the Standing Committee members of the-party Central Committee's Political
 Bureau and the comrades of the Secretariat if they have committed mistakes?
 Naturally we can criticize them.  We can even criticize Comrade Mao Zedong's
 errors.  Why can't we criticize ourselves, if we commit mistakes?  For our
 great cause, whoever makes mistakes in our revolutionary ranks should be
 criticized or told to conduct self-criticism.  However, we must face facts,
 be good to 'others and pay attention to science and policy.  We must not
 wantonly criticize people.   Perhaps some comrades would say that one's
 enthusiasm will be affected once criticism has started.  We say:  It all
 depends on what kind of enthusiasm you have.   If it is the kind of enthusi-
 asm detrimental to the socialist cause, should we not dampen this kind of
 enthusiasm?  This kind of dampening would help the healthy enthusiasm to
 further develop at the same time.
 Second, some comrades have failed to attain a lofty realm of thought in
 some of their works.  Their realm of thought is even very low.  Where does
 this phenomenon manifest itself?  Mainly, it shows up when they are unable
 to correctly handle the relations between love affairs and the revolution
 and between love affairs and the socialist cause, while inappropriately
 overemphasizing the love affairs.
 Naturally, love affairs constitute an important theme in literature and
 art.   We not only may write on this theme, but should write on this theme.
 I had mentioned this at the symposium on script writing held last year.
 Who says that we cannot write about love affairs?  They represent an
 integral part of human life and an important phenomenon in social life.
 The question is what role we let love affairs play.  All communists, revo-
 lutionaries and patriots should be even more broadminded and farsighted.
 Ardently loving only our great motherland, our great people and our social-
 ist cause is most valuable.  If we can classify our sentiments of ardent
 love into number one, number two and number three, the number one should
 be this type of ardent love.  Literature and art in the socialist period
 should be much more progressive than that in the new democratic revolution
 period.  First of all, our literary and art works should educate the
 people, particularly the young people, to love the socialist cause of the
 motherland and our people.  Fundamentally, love affairs should be identical
 with the revolutionary cause.   For the people's interests and for the
 socialist cause, a revolutionary should be able to completely sacrifice
 one's own love affairs and even life, if it is necessary to do so.
 People still remember the Hungarian poet Petofi's famous poem:   "Life is
 indeed valuable, but the price of love is even more valuable.  However,
 for the sake of freedom, I can give up both."  For the nation's inde-
 pendence and the people's freedom in the motherland, this democratic revo-
 lutionary in the mid-19th century was able to attain this kind of lofty
 realm of thought.  How can our socialist literature and art today retreat
 to the realm of thought where love is considered as something supreme?
 We should not let love between the sexes overtake the revolution and
 prevail over the revolution.  Nor should we give publicity to love being
 the noblest and doing everything for the sake of love.  Our literary and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 art wDrks should always be aimed at broadening the people's spiritual realm
 and Et encouraging and inspiring the people to dedicate themselves to the
 socialist modernization of the motherland.
 Only by upholding the concept of "one divides into two," will it be possible
 for us to attain a still higher goal.  In the next year, not only must you
 attain a higher goal, you must alwo work hard to attain a higher goal in
 doing the work of our party and the work of all trades and professions.  You
 said that in the next year, you would produce 100 feature films.  This is
 fine.  However, the question is what kind of feature films.  Everyone
 believes the quantity of 100 feature films should be ensured.  The quality
 of these films should also be better than those produced in 1981.  It is,
 therefore, necessary for you comrades to work harder than ever to con-
 scientiously solve the series of questions in the realms of ideology and
 art and in all fields of your work.
 As for economic development, there must be a practical and "unexaggerated"
 growth rate next year.  This means a certain quantitative as well as a
 strict qualitative requirement or combining of quantity with quality in
 this regard.  I think this requirement is also completely applicable to
 film production.
 If. w e make no big mistakes, adopt a scientific approach and go all out to
 push the national economy forward, it will be possible gradually to accel-
 erate the improvement of the people's living standards a little bit.  How-
 ever, generally speaking, it will not be quite possible for our living
 standards to catch up with those in the most economically developed coun-
 tries in the next 50 years or until the 2020's or 2030's.  Let us review
 some history.  China was gradually reduced to a semicolonial and  semi-
 feudal society since the middle of the 19th century.  After more than a
 century, a tremendous social change took place in China in the middle of
 the 20th century--China entered the period of socialism.  It might take
 another century or so for a fundamental and tremendous socioeconomic
 change to occur in our country so that China will be among the advanced
 of the world--or such a change might not take place until the middle of the
 21st century.   Therefore, the course of social history has determined that
 we Chinese have to bear more hardships in this century and the next.  What
 is so serious about bearing some hardships?  Difficulties and hardships
 will  ielp you succeed in your undertakings. This century and the next will
 be th?3 two centuries in which the Chinese nation will bring about tremendous
 changes and make tremendous progress.
 Such historical development and changes require our comrades to conscien-
 tiously experience all kinds of hardships and tempering.  After this diffi-
 cult historical stage, our nation will have a bright future.  This is the             u
 realm of thought in which our minds are emancipated. .:Such a realm of
 thought is one of revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism.   Is
 this not realistic?  We must be determined to work hard in the next five
 decades to make China a modern, powerful socialist country with political
 stability, economic prosperity, developed education and high ethical

 integration of revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism.  Could
 one be called a revolutionary realist if one disregards the nature of
 historical development and regards the people's cause and ideals as worth-
 less or devoid of any merit?  That is shortsighted, naturalistic and indica-
 tive of a declining mentality.
 Comrades, this question concerning the realm of thought is one of a funda-
 mental character and characteristic of the times.  Among our people, party.
 members and cadres, there will definitely be more and more people who
 firmly believe that our country will effect a tremendous change or progress
 from disorder to order and from poverty to prosperity and who conscien-
 tiously work hard for this purpose.  Now some people eagerly look forward
 to this, others are half believing and half doubting and still a very small
 number of people determinedly oppose such a tremendous change and progress
 and want to go backward.  This requires us to turn our party's correct
 lines and objectives, through our ideological, political, theoretical,
 propaganda, literary and art, journalistic and educational work, into the
 firm will and conviction of large numbers of party members, cadres and
 people, into the ideas, consciousness and public opinion of hundreds of
 millions. of people of various nationalities and into their actions.  There
 will be no future for our literature and art if they do not serve this
 purpose.  If our writers and artists.fail to stand ahead of the times but
 stand aside and only write, perform or sing something about the "wind,
 flowers, snow and moon" and "love," or if they stand behind the times and
 only write, perform or sing something "miserable" or which is "unbearable.
 to recall," then, what future will they have?  There will be no future at
 all for those who stand opposed to use and distort and curse the revolu-
 tion with a mentality marked by antipathy and gloom and with the language
 of hatred, and they are bound to be cast aside by the people.  Of course,
 this does not in the slightest degree mean that ugly phenomena in our
 social life cannot be criticized.  We have said on several occasions that
 they can and should be criticized.  The question here is what stand you
 take and'your frame of thought.
 Comrade Xia Yan has just asked me to say more about the question of study.
 I think this is an extremely important question.  The question of restudy
 faces not only you in your profession but also the whole party and people
 of all nationalities throughout the country, including us.  Of course, the
 division of work in society varies from people to people.   However, there
 are common yet different requirements for people.in study.  As far as
 writers and artists are concerned, I think that they must step up their
 study of Marxism, social life, culture, science and history.
 Marxism, which came into being more than 100 years ago, has its rich theory
 of literature and art.  But this does not mean that authors of classical
 works of Marxism have provided readymade answers to all questions about
 literary and art work.  Our study of Marxism today is for no other purpose
 than guiding our artistic practice with the Marxist stand, viewpoint and
 method.  We should strive to attain a higher ideological and a higher
 artistic level and to integrate the one with the other or to merge them
 into a single whole.  Only in this way will we be able to greatly raise our
 realm of thought and to promote social progress in a particular way.

 I do not know if you have read Comrade Wang Chaowen's "The Concept of
 Aesthetics" and some other comrades' aesthetical works.  I have read some
 of the book but have not yet finished it.  I feel that there may be some
 shortcomings in all books on aesthetics, but they still can help us under-
 stand some concepts or common sense of aesthetics so that we can avoid
 detours in this regard.  Now some of our comrades do not pay sufficient
 attention to theoretical questions, and our achievements in the theory of
 literature and art are very few indeed.
 Writers and artists should go deep into the realities of life in order to
 observe, experience and analyze persons and social phenomena of various
 kinds--this is a prerequisite for our literary and art creation.  If a
 writer does not do so, he can only fabricate stories according to his
 subjective needs.  Take the plot of having a love affair in a tank for
 example.  People only have to ask this:  Since the number of personnel
 assigned to a tank is limited, how can another person be added to it so
 casually?  Gorkiy once sincerely advised a young writer:  Do not write
 anything in a hurry but study it first.  He also said:  One must pay
 attention to reality in order to portray new life vividly and effectively.
 There are three kinds of realities--the past reality, the present reality
 and the sketchy reality of the future.
 In studying science, culture and history, one must pay particular attention
 to language.  I think it necessary to remind comrades, especially young
 comrades, to pay close attention to this matter.
 "A writing that is devoid of literary grace will not last long."  This is
 quite right.  It shows that a writing devoid of literary grace and refined
 language cannot touch people to the heart.  This is an extremely important
 experience.  Literary language is an art.  A work without literary grace
 definitely has little vitality.  Please take a look at Lu Xun, Guo Moruo,
 Mao Dun, Ba Jin, Gao Yu, Lao She, Zhao Zhuli and other literary giants of
 modern times.  Is any of them not a great master of the art of language?
 However, it appears that some young comrades have not paid close attention
 to this matter.  If one does not have sufficient literary accomplishment
 and is unwilling to study some classical Chinese poems and prose, his
 writing will be insipid and devoid of the effect of touching people to the
 heart.  If one goes on like this, how can one do one's job?
 Certain comrades mentioned the movie "Bosom Friend."  I think a movie like
 this can be produced.  Cai E indeed rendered outstanding service in the
 struggle of overthrowing Yuan Shikai during the old democratic revolu-
 tionary period, and Xiao Fengxian can be regarded as a woman with foresight
 and courage.  However, I do not know whether the movie's playwright and
 director read Xiao Fengxian's elegiac couplet for Cai E.  The first part
 of the couplet reads:  "Over the boundless horizon in the south, you
 ascended like a roc that wings skyward, lifted by the cyclone.  How can I,
 a survivor of a chaotic world, bear the fact that our union has become a
 mere dream?"  The second half reads:  "During your several years of stay in
 the north, I pitied myself for having led an aimless life.  But after
 having you, a hero, as my bosom friend, what is fleeting will be remembered

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 forever." You can see that this couplet, which mentions Cai's lofty ambi-
 tion and Xiao Fengxian herself, as well as her relationship with Cai, has
 a fairly deep perception and literary grace.  I hear that it was written
 by a literati in Xiao Fengxian's name.  Nevertheless, it has a certain
 literary value.  I think it would be nice if the movie "Bosom Friend" used
 this couplet as its theme and even used its words for the lyrics of a
 theme song.  From this we can see that we must continue to brush up on
 history and culture.  If our works have a correct theme and tell a touching
 story with a rich, graceful language, they certainly can powerfully educate
 and inspire our people.
 Some comrades maintain that our movies, like ball games, should'be up to
 the standard that they can compete with other countries on the inter-
 national movie scene.                          I think this issue must be analyzed because we will
 lose our bearings if it is not clearly analyzed.  Nowadays, the inter-
 national sports tournaments are matches of athletic skills conducted under
 unified competition regulations and judging standards that are inter-
 nationally acknowledged.  In light of these regulations and standards, who
 wins and who loses can be clearly distinguished, and the results, which do
 not have a class character, are spontaneously recognized by the whole world.
 However, literature and art, including motion pictures, are different.  It
 is one of the ideolggical departments that has a strong class and social
 character.   The same literary and art work may be judged differently, or
 even diametrically, by different people because of differences in their
 social status and world outlook.  Of course, different peoples and different
 countries can and should learn from each other in the field of artistic
 forms and skills of their literature and art.  All the positive results
 from the literature and art of all nations will contribute to mankind's
 cultural development.  In the final analysis, however, whether our litera-
 ture and art has a great vitality depends only on whether it meets the
 needs for the progress of people of all nationalities.  Therefore, the goal
 of struggle of our literature and art is not what it can accomplish inter-
 nationally, but how it can penetrate the hearts of'the broad masses of
 Chinese people and become a powerful spiritual weapon that can arouse
 hundreds of millions of Chinese people to struggle for socialist moderniza-
 tion.  If our literature and art really attains this.goal, it has expressed
 its major international significance.  If our own culture can be developed
 and thrive healthily in a great country like China, which has one-fourth of
 the world's population, and if our people will emerge in the world as a
 highly. civilized nation, it will be an inestimable contribution to and a
 tremendous motivating force in the world's cultural development.  Is it
 possible then that this will not be recorded in full detail in the
 cultural, history of the world?
 In short, in the interest of our country and people, we must heighten our
 spirits, rise up and be ready to exert sustained and strenuous efforts to
 build a stronger and more prosperous country.  We must also emulate the
 Chinese women's volleyball team's spirit of winning glory for the mother-
 land and the people.  Some comrades say that their burden is heavy and they
 already feel the "pressure."  I think this is good.  When tap water cannot
 reach the upper floors of tall buildings, it is because there is not enough

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100410001-2
 pressure.  There must be some pressure, but, of course, it should not be
 too large.  In the final analysis, we rely on our legs in order to attain
 a still higher goal.  Whether our legs can make large steps depends on how
 loyal we are to our motherland, the people, the party and the socialist
 cause.
 This meeting is being held quite successfully.  I propose that a meeting
 like this be held every December.  The meeting should be larger so it will
 be attended by directors, playwrights and some performers and singers.  The
 purpose for settling the general account at the end of the year is to be
 prepared for the fighting during the new year.  Let me repeat what I said:
 We must wage a hard struggle in order to attain a still higher goal!

 CARRY ON THE STUDY OF THE 12TH CPC CONGRESS DOCUMENTS IN A DEEPGOING WAY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 pp 7-8
 [Article by Shi Youxin [2457 0645 2946]]
 [Text]  Vast numbers of cadres and the masses are studying the documents
 of the 12th CPC National Congress.  People are in high spirits in this
 study.  All localities and authorities at all levels have effectively and
 rapidly mobilized leading cadres to explain and publicize the documents
 and train backbone members in propaganda work. Many comrades believe that
 this represents a good beginning for deepening understanding, unifying
 thought and putting into effect the spirit of the 12th party congress.
 The congress documents, in a'concentrated way, reflect the will of members
 of the CPC and the whole nation and express their ideals.  Therefore, these
 documents have a strong appeal.  These scientific and programmtic documents,
 different from other ordinary work reports, offer a regularized summation
 of the active practice led by our party both in reviewing our previous work
 and in planning our future work.  For this reason, our theorists, journal-
 ists, educators and personnel engaged in party and government work are all
 required to explain, give guidance, make expositions and give proof so as
 to help cadres and the masses to study the documents well, have a good
 command of the spirit and unify thought in order to arouse the people of
 the whole nation to go all out and struggle with one heart and one mind
 for the realization of socialist modernization.
 Now, in the wake of the publishment of the documents, we can see that a
 great variety of material for study, guidance and reference has also
 appeared.  Apart from being carried by the press, this is also being pub-
 lished in pamphlet form.  This demonstrates the great efforts made by
 propaganda workers and their initial achievements.  However, a new problem
 has also arisen in this good situation.   Such a large volume of things
 emerging before readers will simply confuse them and they will simply be
 at a loss over which to choose as reference and which to read as the
 primary source, as people's ability to make judgments is different and
 their time and energy are both limited.   How can we achieve good results
 in our study?  This is a question that we must take seriously.  Now, some
 comrades are not concentrating on the study of the documents.   They only
 skim through the documents and believe that they have fulfilled the task.

 Some even fail to finish reading the whole document, and then they turn to
 summary and guidance material and take this in place of the documents.
 This is a method of "putting the cart before the horse."  This will not
 achieve good results.
 Comrades in charge of organizing the study should pay attention to this
 problem.  They should really help everybody concentrate on the study of the
 documents.  If people only have superficial knowledge and fail to master
 the essence, the study will be fruitless.  Study is a painstaking mental
 labor and requires real efforts.  Glancing over something once or twice
 cannot be considered as finishing the study.  Moreover, having studied
 something does not mean that one understands it and understanding it does
 not mean having a good command of it.  The requirement for the study of the
 12th congress documents should be not only able to understand them, but
 also to have a good command of the essence of spirit.  To this end, we
 should, on the basis of reading the documents carefully and thoroughly,
 require different people to take different approaches in the study.  Some
 can take notes of one paragraph after another; some can write their view-
 points on various questions; and others can compare the documents with
 other documents and make an analysis so as to deepen their understanding.
 When encountering difficulties in the study, we should think them over by
 ourselves and then read some selected guidance and reference material.
 Focus points should be selected in the study of the documents.  Material
 beyond the documents should also be tackled after being selected.  The
 method of using the same strength to tackle all problems and extensive
 reading is inadvisable.
 It is necessary to oppose both "leftist" and rightist deviations in connec-
 tion with our real thinking.  To really achieve good results in the study
 of the documents, it is necessary to relate what we have learned with our
 own thinking, especially our thinking since the 3d Plenary Session of the
 11th CPC Central Committee, and check whether there is something in our
 minds that hinders the implementation of the 12th congress spirit.  It
 should be noted that some remnant influences of "leftism" have not been
 thoroughly eliminated in our work..  For example, in dealing with class
 struggle, some people think that the slogan of "taking class struggle as
 the key link,' is correct also as we embark on hitting at serious economic
 crimes or try to dish up this slogan in a new form.  In approaching the
 relationship between politics and economy, some people are keen on reviving
 formalism and empty talk in political work when we stress the importance of
 political and ideological work and they dish up again some imprecise or
 unsuitable viewpoints, such as, "place politics in command" and "politics
 must take precedence over economy."  In dealing with intellectuals, some
 people do not recognize that intellectuals constitute a reliable strength,
 as do workers and peasants in building socialism, and they continue to
 cling to the outdated proposition and policy of "unite, educate and reform."
 In approaching education, science and culture, some people indiscriminately
 stick a label of bourgeoisie on all of these and set them against laboring
 people; they flaunt the ignorance and backwardness that history leaves to
 the laborers as the true color of the proletariat.  At the same time, in
 actual life, there also exists the rightist tendency of deviating from and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 even negating the four cardinal principles.  We must also struggle against
 the bourgeois liberalist tendency and never relax this struggle.  How can
 we give up necessary criticism and struggle against the erroneous view-
 point of-negating that our country has been a socialist society, the pessi-
 mistic and negative arguments that merely look at the dark side of our
 society while we deny our bright side and the superiority of our socialist'
 system and the practice of propagating the old formulas and slogans of the
 bourgeoisie by sticking some "communist" terms on them?  All this consti-
 tutes obstacles to the implementation of the 12th congress spirit.  Without
 clearing up these obstacles, how can we really master the essence of the
 documents' spirit?  In short, we must carry out an ideological struggle
 on the two fronts against both "leftist" and rightist deviations and avoid
 focusing on the criticism of one erroneous tendency to the neglect of
 another.
 It is necessary to link the study of the documents with the study of basic
 theory of Marxism.  At the 1st Plenary Session of.the 12th CPC Central Com-
 mittee, when talking about the study of the 12th congress documents,
 Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed out:  "We should first do our best to master
 the basic spirit of the documents and associate this with the relevant
 basic theory of Marx, Lenin and Comrade Mao Zedong so as to unify our
 thinking."  This is a very timely and important instruction.  Principles
 and policies adopted by the 12th party congress are all in keeping with
 the laws of historical development and the people's demands.  Their
 ideological and theoretical foundation is laid on the basic theory of
 Marxism. Without the knowledge of the relevant basic theory, we will not
 have.a'profound understanding of the essence of the 12th congress documents'
 spirit.  Of course, we cannot lay aside the 12th congress documents to
 study those basic Marxist works.  Rather, the study of the Marxist basic
 works should serve the study of the 12th congress documents.
 On the basis of having a profound understanding and a good command of the
 spirit of the 12th congress documents, we should try our best to relate
 our study with reality of our units and solve some resolvable problems in
 a methodical way.  We are faced with the great task of creating a new
 situation in all fields of socialist modernization,  We should seriously
 consider how to create a new situation in our respective work, what to
 initiate and what to reform.  We should persist in the practice and
 measures that are in line with the principles and policies laid down by the
 12th party congress and strive to overcome existing shortcomings and
 deficiencies.  Through study, we should review the experiences in our work.
 This will help us better understand the 12th congress documents and more
 conscientiously and firmly implement the principles and policies decided by
 the 12th party congress.
 The key reason why the study in the previous period was carried out in a
 down-to-earth way is because leaders at all levels have taken the lead in
 the study.  In order to conduct the study in a more effective and lively
 way, it is suggested that leading cadres should be prepared and give rele-
 vant answers to the people's questions, should join the discussions with the
 masses and if different opinions exist, they can also take part in debates.
 In this way, with the exchange of ideas between leaders and the masses, the
 study will be filled with vigor and will be led to a more profound degree.

 PARTY BUILDING AND THE PROGRAM FOR CREATING A NEW SITUATION IN ALL FIELDS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 pp 9-13
 [Article by Zheng Hui [6774 1920]]
 [Text] The correct program and the series of principles and policies for
 creating a new situation in all fields of socialist modernization outlined
 at the 12th party congress constitute a fundamental basis for all fields
 of work in China's socialist construction in the years to come.  They also
 constitute a fundamental basis for party building, particularly the con-
 solidation of party organizations to be launched very soon.  Here, I would
 like to discuss my impressions on the guiding role of Comrade Hu Yaobang's
 report on strengthening party building.
 In his opening address at the 12th party congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
 pointed out that to integrate the universal truth of Marxism with the con-
 crete realities of China, blaze a path of our own and build socialism with
 Chinese characteristics--this is the basic conclusion we have reached in
 summing up long, historical experiences. Referring to socialist develop-
 ment, the new party constitution pointed out in the general program section:
 "The development and improvement of the socialist system is a long historical
 process," and "the cause of socialism is advancing and is bound to triumph
 gradually throughout the world along paths that are suited to the specific
 conditions in each country and are chosen by its people of their own free
 will."  An important principle of scientific socialism has been advanced
 here.. It provides people with a good deal of valuable enlightenment to
 correctly understand socialism.
 For a long time in the past there has been an oversimplified notion about
 socialism to the effect that after establishing the socialist system
 according to a fixed pattern, we can develop it speedily or easily into a
 perfect and ideal state.  The facts are just the opposite.  Socialism, this
 brandnew social system in human history, was first established in a number
 of countries which were relatively backward economically and culturally and
 the conditions of which were extremely complicated.  Its development can
 never be uniform or smooth sailing.  In the course of'practicing socialism,
 we are bound to go through many difficulties and setbacks and many even

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 commit grave errors.  Under the conditions when serious errors have been
 committed and tremendous setbacks exist in some specific systems, the
 superiority of socialism cannot be fully or notably brought into play.
 Marxism has brought to light the general laws governing socialism in
 historical developments.  Only by integrating the universal truth of
 Marxism with the concrete realities in their own countries and finding the
 correct paths that are suited to the specific conditions in their own coun-
 tries is it possible for communists in various countries to achieve suc-
 cesses in socialism.  Therefore, socialism will advance to common victory
 on a world scale through various forms and paths.  It will be impossible to
 attain good results by indiscriminately copying the experience or patterns
 of foreign countries without maintaining independence and keeping the
 initiative in our own hands or by imposing one country's experience or
 pattern on others.  Under the guidance of Marxism, all roads lead to com-
 munism.  This is a historical trend in the contemporary world communist
 movement.
 Our party has succeeded in solving the questions of choosing a path for the
 democratic revolution suited to China's specific conditions and for the
 socialist transformation of the means of production.  After the socialist
 system was established in an all-round way, our party was confronted with
 a completely new and more difficult and complicated problem of breaking a
 new path for socialist construction that is suited to China's national
 conditions.  Everybody knows that in the course of solving this problem,
 our party has made painstaking efforts and paid a heavy price.  After
 going through a tortuous path, we are now embarking on a new journey of
 historical development.  The 12th party congress represents a great mile-
 stone of this new journey.  The documents, such as Comrade Deng Xiaoping's
 opening address at the 12th party congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang's report to
 the.12th party congress and the new party constitution, are the banners
 guiding our victorious advance.  The documents comprehensively and pene-
 tratingly expound the basic contents of socialist economic, ideological,
 cultural and political construction, their respective status and their
 relationships with one another in accordance with guidelines of the party's
 general task in the new historical period.  These expositions have taught
 us that the four modernizations are the focal point of the whole party's
 work and the basis for solving international and domestic problems.  At the
 same time, great efforts should be made to build a high degree of socialist
 spiritual civilization and socialist democracy.  Building socialist spiritual
 civilization and socialist democracy is both an important aspect of our
 fundamental objectives and tasks and an important guarantee for building
 socialist material civilization.  The building of the three aspects are
 closely related with, and promote, one another.  All these constitute a
 complete program for building socialism as proposed by our party.   They
 also represent an enormous progress our party has achieved in the course
 of integrating the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete realities
 of our country and in its protracted efforts to explore a socialist path
 with Chinese characteristics.
 Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said:   In comparison with the time of the
 eighth party congress, our party has gained a much deeper understanding of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 the laws governing China's socialist construction and acquired much more
 experience.  At the time of the eighth party congress, the situation in
 launching all-round socialist construction developed very speedily and our
 party was not adequately prepared in both theory and practice.  The line of
 the eighth party congress was correct.  However, it failed to mature or
 solidly establish itself and, consequently, failed to prevent the occur-
 rence of serious errors in a later period.  History has profoundly educated
 the whole party.  From the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Com-
 mittee to the 12th party congress, our party systematically summed up the
 historical experience, both positive and negative, since the founding of the
 PRC and finally reached a new scientific plane in understanding the specific
 conditions of Chinese society and ways to build socialism in accordance
 with China's specific conditions.  Naturally, we cannot say that we have
 satisfactorily and thoroughly solved this problem.  Many principles and
 policies still remain to be further perfected, substantiated and revised.
 However, it should be said that the basic path is correct.  This is indeed
 of decisive significance to the growth and prosperity of our party and our
 socialist cause.
 Comrade Mao Zedong set forth, expounded and proved the idea of the close
 relationship between our party building and party political line.  More
 than 30 years' experience of party building since the founding of the PRC
 has once again confirmed this idea.  In the period of democratic revolution,
 party building was closely interrelated with the party's task of dealing
 with the united front and armed struggle.  Similarly, in the period of
 socialism, party building is also closely interrelated with the party's
 task of dealing with the socialist modernization program.  When the party
 correctly formulated and implemented the line for building socialism, the
 party invariably developed and made rapid progress.  Conversely, when there
 were some deviations in the party's line, particularly when such a serious
 error as the "Cultural Revolution" occurred, great damages were likewise
 done to party building.  Now, our party has led the people in achieving a
 great transformation of historic significance and has formulated a correct
 program for socialist modernization, thus providing the most important and
 fundamental guarantee for the party's victorious development.  In the course
 of creating a new situation in all fields in the years to come, our party
 will certainly be able to make our ranks purer and stronger in light of
 implementing the correct political line and, consequently, shoulder our
 historical missions more satisfactorily.
 In accordance with the specific conditions and requirements of the new
 historical period, the party constitution has set forth in the general
 program the three basic requirements that should be met in strengthening
 party building:  1) A high degree of ideological and political unity;
 2) wholehearted service to the people; and 3) adherence to democratic
 centralism.  What should be done to meet the three basic requirements and
 raise party building to a new height in relation to the socialist moderni-
 zation program set forth in Comrade Hu Yaobang's report to the 12th party
 congress?

 A high degree of ideological and political unity constitutes the first of
 the three basic requirements..  The unity referred to is a unity based on
 the basic political and ideological principles and Marxism.  In the past,
 when the "leftist" errors held a dominant position within the party,
 normal debates on different views among comrades within the party were
 regarded as a serious struggle of line and as class struggle.  Excessive
 means of struggle were used to enforce an erroneous ideological and polit-
 ical principle.  This inflicted grave damage on the cause of the party and
 the people.  We should never repeat this historical error.  However, we
 should not negate the extreme importance of party leadership with the
 errors committed by the leaders of the party; neither should we negate the
 important principle of upholding a high degree of ideological and political
 unity in the party with the pretext that there has been a lesson of enforcing
 unanimity within the party under the erroneous guiding ideology.  The prob-
 lem is that we should rely on the improvement of the party's ideological and
 theoretical level, the maturity of its political experience, the soundness
 of its democratic centralism and the development of its democratic life to
 ensure ideological and political unity in the party based on Marxism.  In
 view. of the fact that the party has formulated a correct line and that
 inner-party life has been increasingly restored to normal, it is perfectly
 necessary and entirely possible for us to meet this requirement.  In his
 report to the 12th party congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang has summed up our
 experience in effecting a great and historic change over the past 6 years.
 An important experience is that, on some major ideological and political
 questions of principle, the CPC Central Committee has waged appropriate
 struggles on two fronts--against both the "left" and the right deviation,
 and maintained the scientific character and unity of the party's guiding
 ideology.  Without this scientific character and without this ideological
 and political unity, there would not be such a good political and economic
 situation as we have today.  This truth is clear to all.
 The socialist modernization program set forth by the 12th party congress has
 correctly handled the relationship between socialist economic construction,
 on the one hand, and socialist ideological, cultural and political con-
 struction, on the other.  It has correctly handled the relationship between
 the contradictions among the people and those between the people and the
 enemy in the present stage of socialism as well as the relationship between
 the state, the collective and the individual.  It has correctly handled the
 relationship between the actual conditions and present policies of socialism,
 on the one hand, and the ideological system and lofty ideals of communism, on
 the other.  These are important problems which our party has, for many years
 in the past, strived to solve but has not been able to solve well.  In
 handling these problems, the "leftist" errors have invariably driven an
 aspect of contradiction to extremes and handled it in a completely reverse
 and nonsensical manner, thus degenerating into serious idealism and meta-
 physics.  The ideological and political unity enforced according to this
 "leftist" errors can only be formal or false unity, which inevitably damaged
 the party's fine tradition of seeking truth from facts, discredited socialism
 and dampened the enthusiasm of numerous party members in pursuing the com-
 munist ideal.   The current correct program set forth by the CPC Central
 Committee has broken completely with the "leftist" errors in the past and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 has also made a clean break from the rightist deviation.  To achieve polit-
 ical unity within the whole party with this program will enable the whole
 party to greatly raise its Marxist level, be firmer and more energetic in
 its current socialist practice and fully confident in the long-term pros-
 pacts of future'communism.
 In its efforts to bring order out of chaos in all fields in the past few
 years, the CPC Central Committee has, first and foremost, promoted
 ideologically the Marxist vitality of daring to make innovations and inven-
 tions and discarded all viewpoints which have been worshipped in the past
 and which have been proved through long-term practice to be incorrect.  It
 has applied basic Marxist principles and formulated principles and policies
 in accordance with objective conditions.  It has also constantly improved         a
 and perfected the content of the present principles and policies through
 practice.  The process in which these principles and policies have taken
 shape is one of constant development from practice to knowledge and from
 knowledge to practice, and one of repeated development of from the masses
 to the masses.  There is no end to practice and there is no end to learning.
 The guiding ideology of the party is in a state of lively movement.  There-
 fore, the high level of ideological and political unity which the new party
 constitution calls on the whole party to maintain is by no means a rigid
 and mechanical uniformity but a vigorous and lively unity based on correct
 integration of theory with practice and of leadership with the masses.
 This is a fine tradition which has taken shape in our party for a long time
 and which our party now pays particular attention to promote.
 A primary factor in achieving a high level of ideological and political
 unity is to step up our study.  The party constitution stipulates that all
 party members, particularly party cadres, should conscientiously study
 Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, essential knowledge concerning the
 party, and the party's line, principles, policies and decisions and acquire
 general, scientific and professional knowledge.  They should go deep into
 the realities of life to conduct investigations and studies and be good at
 waging struggles against various erroneous tendencies inside and outside
 the party.  In his report, Comrade Hu Yaobang stressed the necessity of
 vigorously stepping up the education and training of cadres.  He regarded
 this as a strategic measure for improving the quality of cadres.  We should
 carry out the training of cadres according to this guideline.  Provided
 that party members and cadres achieve notable successes in their studies,
 the whole party will be able to have a common language on major ideological
 and political issues and further lead the masses.
 The second basic requirement for strengthening party building set forth in
 the new party constitution is that party members should serve the people
 with heart and soul.   Our party has always regarded service to the people
 as its sole purpose.   It has always stressed that the words and deeds of
 party members should conform. to the people's interests, for this is the
 highest criterion.  In the protracted and ruthless armed struggles and
 underground struggles in the past, our numerous party members feared no

 sacrifices and fought bravely for the liberation of the Chinese people,
 displaying a high level of communist consciousness.  After the party
 becomes a party in power leading the political power of the state, by
 relying on the political power, it is able to work for the interests of the
 people oil a larger scale and degree.  On the other hand, the leading status
 of the party also subjects it to the danger of divorcing itself from the
 masses and of abusing its power.  Once this danger becomes a reality, the
 damages done to the interests of the people will be much more serious than
 an error committed in the revolutionary war period.  The "Cultural Revolu-
 tion" precisely serves as a profound lesson.  It was the outcome of a fault
 in the building of party in power and was in turn a cause for the huge wound
 inflicted on the party.  Due to the great damages done to the party polit-
 ically, ideologically and organizationally in the decade of domestic tur-
 moil, the phenomena of using public office for personal gain among some
 party cadres was fairly serious.  Through consolidation of party organiza-
 tions over the past few years, conditions have greatly improved in the
 party.  However, the contradictions of whether serving the people or seek-
 ing personal gain have not been completely solved or have not been solved
 at all among many party members.
 Comrade Hu Yaobang's report comprehensively analyzed the present condition
 of our party and set forth several problems that we should concentrate on
 solving in party building at the present stage.  The party is reforming the
 leading bodies; leading cadres of the party at various levels are engaging
 in cooperation between the old and the new and the succession of the old by
 the new*.  The party demands that large numbers of young and middle-aged
 cadres be promoted to various leading posts in good time and that veteran
 cadres who have been relieved of their heavy responsibility in "front line"
 posts continue to shoulder the tasks of passing on experience, giving help
 and setting an example.  The party demands that the young and middle-aged
 cadres who have been newly promoted to leading posts modestly learn the
 skills needed in economic and construction work and, with the spirit of
 doing pioneering work, score outstanding successes in their work.  The
 party also demands that party organizations at various levels and the
 numerous party members establish close ties with the workers, peasants and
 intellectuals and step up work with the masses.  In view of the fact that
 the existence of impurities in ideology, style and organization within the
 party is not suited to the new situation and tasks, it is therefore neces-
 sary to conduct an overall consolidation of party organizations over a
 period of 3 years.  In a nutshell, the solution of all these problems will
 enable party organizations and party members to dedicate themselves with
 the spirit of serving the people with heart and soul in socialist moderniza-
 tion.  Just as Comrade Hu Yaobang said:  "We must lay stress on getting
 every member to understand clearly the character, position and role of the
 party and to realize that all party members have only the duty to serve
 the people diligently, and conscientiously, and no right whatsoever to take
 advantage of their power and positions to 'fatten' themselves at the
 expense of the state and the masses."  The members of a party in power have
 many favorable conditions and opportunities to use public office for
 personal gain, to benefit themselves at the expense of public interests or
 to "fatten" themselves at the expense of the state and the masses.   In order

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 to be a qualified party member, one should never be allowed to "fatten"
 oneself like this.  In many of its articles, the new party constitution has
 made specific provisions on this question.  This is also an important
 aspect showing that the requirements for party members and party cadres
 in the'ncw period are more exacting than before.
 Party members should have the idea of wholehearted service to the people.
 This is determined by the character and tasks of our party.  Our party is
 the vanguard of the Chinese working class and its ultimate goal is the
 realization of communism.  With the exception of the interests of the work-
 ing class and the broadcast masses of people, the party does not have
 special interests of its own.  The communist social system that the party
 wants to establish is the most advanced and superior social system in human
 history.  Under this social system, the relationship between men and the
 relationship between the individual and society should be a completely new
 type of social relationship.  Does the individual or society hold supreme?
 Is all for the individual or is the individual subservient to society?
 This is a fundamental factor distinguishing a new society of public owner-
 ship from the previous society of private ownership.  In a communist
 society, there are ample and good conditions to ensure personal development
 and satisfy personal interests.  However, personal interests must be sub-
 ordinated to the interests of society and personal development must be
 adapted to the development of society.  In the initial stage of communism,
 it is likewise necessary to establish the fundamental principle that
 society should protect the individual and the individual should submit to
 society.  It is different from the higher stage of communism only in some
 respect of its specific contents.  Therefore, the idea of wholehearted
 service to the people is a communist idea reflecting a. new type of social
 relationship.  An important component of building a high degree of social-
 ist spiritual civilization is to develop this, advanced idea and this new
 type of social relationship.  If, in ideological building, our party does
 not put forward the requirement of wholehearted service to the people, the
 party.'s role of main support in the building of spiritual civilization in
 the entire society is out of the question.  Neither can we use these con-
 tents to influence and educate the broad masses.  Naturally, our party has
 invariably stressed that it is necessary to strictly differentiate publi-
 city of the communist ideological system from the current program of action
 and the present policies.  At the present stage, in economic and social
 life, we should uphold the system of distribution according to work and
 other' social systems.  We should demand that all members of society become
 communists.  However, if, in. the previous new democratic stage, our party
 was able to influence the masses with its communist spirit and win vic-
 tories, are there any doubts about the necessity for party members to
 firmly acquire the idea of wholehearted service to the people today, when
 the party has stressed the building of socialist spiritual civilization as
 a fundamental objective of socialism?
 The third basic requirement for strengthening party building set forth in
 the new party constitution is adherence to"democratic centralism.  With

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 respect to the stipulation of the party's basic principle of democratic
 centralism, the new party constitution is an improvement on all previous
 constitutions and is fuller in content. This is a special feature of the
 new party constitution.
 In his report to the 12th party congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang also concen-
 trated on expounding the importance of strengthening democratic centralism
 and further normalizing inner-party political life.  Now, the political
 life of the CPC Central Committee and many local party organizations has
 been restored to normal.  This represents a major progress.  However,
 undemocratic practices and patriarchal ways still have not been eradicated
 in many organizations, and cases of decentralism and liberalism exist to a
 serious extent.  We must concentrate on solving this problem when we
 strengthen the party organizationally in the days to come.
 The party's democratic centralism reflects, in essence, a new type of polit-
 ical relationship within the party in the organizational system.  In a
 socialist society, there is a new type of political relationship among the
 people and there is also a new type of political relationship within the
 political party of the working class.  The 12th party congress pointed out
 that great efforts should be made to build a high level of socialist
 democracy and that it is necessary to establish, in accordance with the
 principle of socialist democracy, a relationship of equality between men
 and a correct relationship between the individual and society.  Within the
 Communist Party, there should be a higher standard and stricter demand for
 this political relationship.  All party members enjoy rights within the
 limits prescribed by the party constitution, discharge the duties of
 membership and observe a unified discipline.  There should be equality in
 these basic respects.  The duties and limits of authorities of the higher
 party organizations are different from those of the lower party organiza-
 tions, and the duties and limits of authorities of party organizations are
 different from those of party members.  In their mutual relations, there
 are differences between the leader and the led.  However, these differences
 in work and posts do not mean that there are differences between the honor-
 able and'the lowly, between the high and the low.  Politically, there is
 complete equality between them.  Through the implementation of democratic
 centralism, the party develops truth and rectifies errors, thus attaining
 unity and unification of the party on the basis of Marxism.  This new type
 of political relationship cannot be mentioned in the same breath with the
 feudal autocratic system and bourgeois liberalism.  The organizational
 system of the party's democratic centralism has been established on the
 basis of this new type of political relationship; the improvement of the
 functioning of democratic centralism invariably promotes the development
 of, this new type of political relationship.
 When referring to the reform of the system of leadership and the leading
 organs, Comrade Hu Yaobang, in his report, also concentrated on expounding
 on the correct solution of the question of party leadership over government
 organs and over enterprises and institutions.  It was pointed out in the
 report that it is necessary to achieve a proper division of labor between
 the party and the government and between party work and administrative and
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 production work in enterprises and institutions.  This is a major question
 concerning how the party can correctly bring into play its leading role.
 The new party constitution has for the first time made a clear stipulation
 in this respect.  A good solution of this problem will enable CPC com-
 mittees at various levels to extricate themselves from routine administra-
 tive work and strengthen party leadership ideologically and politically and
 party building so that the administrative and production departments can
 .do their work actively, independently and concertedly, thus bringing their
 usefulness into full play.  This problem also involves the establishment of
 a new type of socialist political relationship of democracy and equality
 between the party and the nonparty masses.  We should regard it as a funda-
 mental principle for building socialist spiritual civilization and socialist
 democracy and solve it conscientiously, gradually and rationally.
 We should improve the functioning of democratic centralism and reform and
 improve the party's system of leadership in state life so that our relation-
 ship within the party and outside the party may develop soundly and so that
 we can create a political situation in which we have both centralism and
 democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of will and personal
 ease of mind and liveliness.  By that time, there will be unlimited
 prospects for the cause of socialist modernization.

 THE BASIC POLICY OF ATTAINING A HIGH LEVEL OF SOCIALIST DEMOCRACY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 pp 14-18
 [Article by Lu Zhichao [4151 0037 6389]]
 [Text] Like building a high level of socialist material and spiritual
 civilization, building a high level of socialist democracy is one of the
 fundamental tasks and targets of our country's people in the new historical
 period.   Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and
 under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, extensive publicity and
 discussions have been carried out on the theory of building a high level of
 democracy, and many practical reforms with far-reaching significance have
 been made.  The democratic system in our country, damaged in the past, has
 been restored and developed.  However, building a high level of democracy
 is an arduous task and requires a long process of struggle.  Discussions
 held in the past few years show that there exist different and even oppos-
 ing views on many questions concerning democracy.  These different views
 involve the understanding of the nature of socialist democracy and of
 questions such as democracy and dictatorship, democracy and centralism,
 the democratic system and democratic life, democracy and the legal system,
 democracy and party leadership, and so on.  In his report to the 12th party
 congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang gave in principle clear answers to these ques-
 tions.  The "report" is the guiding policy for building democracy from now
 on and at the same time i  should also form the basis on which we increase
 our understanding and unify our thinking.
 In the sections concerning the building of democracy, the "report" first
 makes clear the nature of socialist democracy in our country and expounds
 the relationship between democracy and dictatorship.
 The word democracy has many meanings and is often used to signify different
 things.  According to the Marxist point of view, democracy is first of all
 a question of state system.  Lenin said:  "Democracy is one sort of state
 form, one of its patterns."  ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 3, p 257)  In
 history, the replacement of the feudal system by bourgeois democracy was a
 great step forward.  However, bourgeois democracy is only democracy for the
 exploiting classes, a very small percentage of the population, and it is a

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 trap and a fraud for the proletariat and other laboring people.  Bourgeois
 democracy is in essence bourgeois dictatorship but the bourgeoisie has
 never admitted this.  After leading the broad masses of the people in
 seizing state power, the proletariat set up the dictatorship of the prole-
 tariat, or the people's democratic dictatorship.  Since this kind of
 democracy is for the laboring people, who account for the overwhelming
 majority of the population, and dictatorship is exercised only over a
 very small number of exploiters and hostile elements, the proletariat and
 the laboring people can openly announce that they must exercise dictator-
 ship over the people's enemies while practicing democracy among themselves.
 As long as class struggle still exists, we must not deviate from Marxist
 theories on class struggle and on the state when examining and handling
 issues concerning democracy.
 The basic Marxist views on democracy mentioned above have been repeatedly
 expounded in the party's documents in the past few years.  The following
 questions can be explained on the basis of these views:  First, democracy,
 which is a form of state structure and state system, also involves dictator-
 ship.  Therefore, when our party calls for building a high level of social-
 ist democracy, it is at the same time calling for strengthening and con-
 solidating the people's democratic dictatorship.  Only by developing a
 high level of democracy can we effectively exercise dictatorship and ensure
 the smooth progress of socialist construction.  It is one-sided and wrong
 to separate democracy from dictatorship, thinking that calling for a
 "higher level of democracy" means ignoring dictatorship over the enemy, or
 that stressing the necessity of exercising dictatorship over the enemy
 means restricting democracy.  Second, as a state system, socialist democracy
 is won by means of revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the pro-
 letariat and is not established on the principle of the minority submitting
 to the majority.  Moreover, after establishing this democratic system, a
 handful of class enemies who oppose socialism cannot be treated on the
 principle of the minority submitting to the majority.  The principle of the
 minority submitting to the majority only applies to the question of how to
 exercise state power among the people.  We must understand that class rela-
 tionships come before relationships between the minority and the majority
 among the people under a democratic system.  Otherwise, confusion will
 occur.  Third, viewed from the essential nature of state power, socialist
 democracy, we say, is incomparably superior to bourgeois democracy.  As
 Lenin said, it is "millions of times" more democratic than bourgeois
 democracy.   ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 3, p 634)  This is because in
 our socialist country, although the democratic system and democratic life
 have not yet been entirely developed or perfected the proletariat and the
 laboring people are already in the ruling position and are masters of the
 country.   On the other hand, in the capitalist countries, even in the most
 democratic ones, the broad masses of the people are still being ruled and
 exploited.  If we forget fundamental class relationships and compare our
 democracy with bourgeois democracy only in terms of concrete systems and
 forms, serious ideological confusion will occur.
 Some people may ask:  Since socialist democracy is of a higher type, why
 do we still say that our democracy is not extensive enough and why must we
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 set ourselves the target and task of building a high level of democracy?
 This involves another aspect of the meaning of democracy.  In the above
 discussions, we talk about the nature of state power, that is, state struc-
 ture.                     Here, we will talk about the administrative system, that is, the
 form of organization of state power, the building of the democratic system
 and the development of democratic life.  In this sense, our democracy is
 really not good enough and building a high level of democracy will involve
 a protracted process.
 Socialist democracy is a new type of democracy meaning that the whole of the
 people manage the state.  Since the socialist system has a short history,
 the task of building a high level of socialist democracy has not yet been
 accomplished in any country.  Besides, accomplishing this task in China
 will involve special difficulties.  China went through a feudal period
 lasting several thousands of years and it lacks democratic traditions.  In
 the past, we did not pay enough attention to developing democracy either.
 So a lot of time is needed to make up for this.   Besides, we have little
 experience in this respect.   Under these circumstances, we can only
 accomplish the task of building a high level of democracy through syste-
 matic, unremitting and protracted efforts to carry out the modernization
 program and to build socialist spiritual civilization.  It is not realistic
 to expect quick results or to attempt to do everything at one go.
 In short, with regard to the question of building a high level of democracy,
 we must distinguish between the two different meanings of democracy and at
 the same time we must realize that they are closely linked.  The proletariat
 and the laboring people have seized state power and set up the people's
 democratic dictatorship.  This is the prerequisite for developing the
 democratic system and democratic life.  Without state power, there will be-
 no democracy for the laboring people.                     On the other hand, developing a
 highly democratic system and life is an important condition for upholding
 the people's democratic dictatorship.   Without these, the power of the
 whole people to manage the state will never be fully realized or guaranteed.
 As far as the development of the democratic system and democratic life is
 concerned, our task in building a high level of socialist democracy,
 according to the report to the 12th party congress, involves the following
 main aspects:
 1.  The key to developing a high level of democracy is to continue to
 reform and improve our country's political structure and the structure of
 its leadership in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism,
 and strengthen the building of organs of state power at all levels.  The
 purpose of this work is to enable the people to better exercise state power
 and to enable government organs to lead and organize the people in building
 socialism.
 All our state power belongs to the people.  However, it is impossible for a
 billion people to directly grasp and exercise state power together.  They

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100410001-2
 must do so by means of government bodies composed of their representatives.
 Lenin said:  "We cannot imagine democracy, even proletarian democracy,
 without representative institutions."  ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 3,
 p 211)  In our country, the organs through which the people exercise state
 power are the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at
 all levels.  This system of people's congresses organized according to the
 principle of democratic centralism, is an administrative system suited to
 our country's conditions, and a form. of organization of state power capable
 of giving full expression to socialist democracy.  Reforming our country's
 political structure and the structure of its leadership does not mean
 changing this basic system but reforming specific systems and forms of
 organization which have drawbacks and defects in order to improve this
 fundamental system day by day.  There are two aspects of these reforms.
 With regard to the political system, they include strengthening the power of
 people's congresses and their respective standing committees at all levels,
 strengthening the functions and powers of the State Council and the people's
 governments at all levels and strictly implementing the responsibility
 system, abolishing the lifelong tenure system for state leaders, improving
 the election system and the supervision system of the masses over state
 cadres, and so on.  Regarding the structure of the state's leadership and
 leading organs, these reforms are mainly aimed at overcoming problems such
 as overcentralization of powers, cadres concurrently holding too many posts,
 excessive numbers of deputies, overlapping organizations, duties and
 responsibilities not being clearly defined, overstaffing, mixing up the
 party's work with that of the government, bureaucracy and inefficiency.
 The essence of this work is to reform irrational cadre systems and to
 ensure that the ranks of cadres gradually become more revolutionary,
 younger in average age, better educated and more professionally competent.
 Reforms in this respect are more specific but very important parts of the
 reform of the political system.
 The crucial question in this kind of reform is to implement the principle
 of democratic centralism comprehensively, from top to bottom.  On the one
 hand, the power of state organs at all levels must be based on extensive
 democracy and these organs must really represent the interests and will of
 the people and enable the people to exercise their power.  On the other
 hand, these organs must exercise the necessary centralism based on democracy
 so that they will become authoritative and effective and will be able to
 effectively lead and organize socialist construction.  Centralism based on
 democracy is an inevitable means and form for realizing democracy.  Some
 people think that calling for the building of a "high level of democracy"
 means ignoring centralism, while others think that centralism restricts
 democracy.  They do not really understand the system of democratic
 centralism.
 Of course, as a democratic political system, democratic centralism must
 first of all adhere to the principle of the minority submitting to the
 majority, and embody the views of the majority.  However, in the work of
 our state organs, the principle of democratic centralism should at the same
 time become a kind of work method and work style.  This kind of work method
 and work style is appropriate and complementary to the democratic nature of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 our political system.  In the past, we often regarded centralism based on
 democracy as merely a work method and work style and were not conscious
 that it was first of all a system.  Of course, this is wrong.  However, it
 is also a one-sided view to deny that at the same time democratic methods
 and style are necessary for a democratic system.
 2.  Socialist democracy is not merely a kind of political system.  It
 should also be extended to various aspects of the people's political,
 economic, cultural and social life.  This is an important part of develop-
 ing a high level of democracy and an important expression of the superiority
 of socialist democracy over capitalist democracy.  First, in addition to
 exercising their right to run the state by means of people's congresses at
 all levels, the people, as masters of the country and the society, must also
 directly enjoy rights of management to varying extents and in various forms
 in the political, economic, cultural and social life in which they partici-
 pate.  Only in this way can they give full play to their enthusiasm and
 initiative.  Our country is so big that democracy will not exist in an all-
 round way if people only enjoy the former right.  Second, democracy implies
 equality.  In order to develop all-round socialist democracy, we must also
 establish, among the people and according to the principle of democracy,
 equal political relationships between man and man, including equality
 between nationalities, equality between man and woman, equality among
 citizens before the law, relationships between citizens and the state and
 social rights and duties.  We must ensure that these relationships will
 become political guiding principles which people must observe, and ideologi-
 cal habits.   This is an important part of building democracy and at the same
 time an important part of building socialist spiritual civilization.  Third,
 in order to attain the goal mentioned above, democracy should also become a
 way for the people to carry out self-criticism and learn democratic, collec-
 tive and communist ideology.  A democratic method is one of discussion,
 criticism and self-criticism, persuasion and education.  This is a method
 which was created by our party and the revolutionary ranks led by our party
 long ago and has been effectively used to raise the people's ideological
 consciousness and to resolve contradictions among them.  Since the founding
 of the country, it has also been popularized. among the whole people and very
 good results have been obtained.  We must also see that without using the
 democratic method and raising the people's consciousness everywhere, the
 building of the socialist democratic system and the development of demo-
 cratic life are not guaranteed.
 We must closely link the building of socialist democracy with the building
 of the socialist legal system and systematize and legalize socialist
 democracy.  With regard, to this question, there exist.two confused ideas.
 The first is thinking that it is insufficient to stress only the building
 of a "high level of democracy" because this will make some people ignore
 the law and social order.  The second is thinking that the law restricts
 democracy and that stressing the building of the legal system will restrict
 the development of democracy.  Both of these ideas result from the same
 mistaken view of democracy not as a system but as anarchy under which one
 may do as one pleases and the legal system is not regarded as a guarantee
 for democracy but as a restriction to it.  These ideas set democracy against

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 the legal system in two different aspects.  Neither the nature of socialist
 democracy nor the functions of the socialist system have been correctly
 understood.  As a matter of fact, if we understand the correct meaning of
 socialist democracy and clarify the relationship between democracy and
 dictatorship, democracy and centralism, and the democratic system and
 democratic life, we will understand that socialist democracy is a political
 system and a social order which most conforms to the interests and desires
 of the whole people and is the most healthy and rational political relation-
 ship and habit of life.  The socialist system only consolidates it in a
 legal form.  Harming the people's interests and social order, and anarchy
 under which one may do as one pleases, are forbidden by the law because
 they undermine democracy.  The nature and functions of socialist democracy
 and the socialist legal system are essentially the same.  The task of build-
 ing a high level of democracy put forth by our party includes improving the
 socialist legal system.
 Why should we then put forward the idea of closely combining the development
 of democracy with that of legal system?  This is because socialist democracy
 is the content and foundation of the socialist legal system while the
 socialist legal system reflects and guarantees socialist democracy.  Social-
 ist democracy, whether as the essence of a country and the form of organiza-
 tion and mode of activities of state power, or as a guiding principle for the
 people's political relations and political life, should be written into law
 by the organs of state power (including constitutional and general laws).
 These laws must be observed by everybody, and compulsorily enforced by the
 organs of state power.  Only in this manner can socialist democracy become
 an authoritative, firm and unshakable system.  The degree of perfection of
 the socialist legal system marks the level of maturity and development of
 socialist democracy.  Therefore, strengthening democracy and perfecting the
 legal system are two organically related aspects of the task of the
 development of a high level of socialist democracy.
 The report to the 12th congress sums up our achievements in developing the
 legal system and puts forward our task for the future.   Since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our party has summed up and drawn
 on historical lessons, begun to pay attention to developing the legal system
 and scored remarkable achievements.  As a result, we have put an end to the
 idea and situation of "despising all law and authority" and set up initial
 rule by law.  The draft of the new constitution soon to be examined and
 approved by the National People's Congress will in particular open a new
 phase in the development of our country's socialist democracy and legal
 system.  It will provide an essential basis for extensive legislative work
 in the future.  Our party's task for the future is to continue to lead the
 people to.formulate and perfect various kinds of law while strengthening
 its leadership over the administration of law, strengthening education in
 the legal system and ensuring by various means the strict enforcement and
 observation of the law of our country.
 Judging by the present situation, the latter task is even more important.
 This is because at present many of our people lack the concept of a legal
 system or are ignorant of the law.   Our youth in particular is even more
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 ignorant about the law and its meaning.  Quite a large number of our party
 members, including some of our leading cadres fail to see the significance
 of developing the legal system.  Some of them even have a "special privi-
 lege" mentality and think that the law is formulated for common people, not
 for them. This is why there still exists the malpractice of failing to act
 according to the law or to strictly enforce it.  In order to put an end to
 this malpractice, we should first carry out education in the legal system
 among all our people.   In particular, we should educate and supervise the
 broad ranks of our party members and cadres and tell them to take the lead
 in observing the constitution and the law.  We should begin with our broad
 ranks of party members and cadres, make every citizen understand the law
 and the obligation to observe the law and set up a practice of doing every-
 thing in accordance with the law throughout our society.  Second, we should
 strictly enforce the law.  The key to this is the actual implementation of
 the principle that every citizen being equal before the law.  We should not
 allow any organization or any individual to have the privilege to transcend
 the constitution and the law.   Our party should steadfastly safeguard the
 power.of the judicial organs in independently exercising their authority and
 performing their duties.  It should encourage and support the judicial work-
 ers in enforcing the law in an impartial and incorruptible manner.  It
 should crack down on any practice of bending the law for the benefits of
 one's relatives or friends.
 Our country's socialist construction, including the construction of the
 material and spiritual civilizations and the development of a high level of
 democracy must be carried out under the party's leadership.   The task,
 theory, principle and policies of developing a high level of democracy have
 been put forward by the party and must be gradually carried out under the
 leadership of the party.  The question of whether we accept the leadership
 of the party is the key to the question of whether we will be able to develop
 our democracy along a socialist path.  Recognition or otherwise of the
 party's leadership is the demarcation line between the socialist concept of
 democracy and the various kinds of erroneous bourgeois and petit bourgeois
 concepts of democracy.  A very small number of people propose breaking away
 from the party's leadership, advocate a kind of "absolute democracy"
 divorced from the party's leadership and even raise the banner of fighting
 for democracy and freedom against the party.  These people proclaim them-
 selves or are called by others in flattery "fighters for democracy."  In
 fact, their thoughts and actions'hamper and impair the development of
 socialist democracy.
 It is common for our comrades to have some muddled perception of the rela-
 tionship between the development of democracy and the leadership of the
 party.  Some think that since democracy means all the people being the
 masters-and making decisions according to the principle of the minority
 being subordinate to the majority, it seems that we should not stress the
 party's leadership.  Otherwise, we will go against the principle of
 "democracy."  This view treats the principle of the people being the masters
 and the majority making decisions as being abstract and absolute and thus

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 distorts this principle.  The party's leadership means using the revolu-
 tionary consciousness of the advanced class and the science of Marxism-
 Leninism to clearly point out the correct path of revolution and construc-
 tion, enlighten the people, readjust their relationships, correctly sum up
 the interests and will of the people and unite and guide more and more
 masses in conscientiously carrying out the struggle for their own funda-
 mental interests.  The party is an indispensable tool for the people to win
 their final liberation that has emerged in the revolutionary struggle of the
 proletariat and the masses of people.  Without the leadership of the party,
 it would have been impossible in the past for the people to overthrow reac-
 tionary rule and win democracy; without the leadership of the party, it is
 impossible at present for the people to correctly and effectively exercise
 their right as masters.  A little recollection of history and a little
 consideration of reality will enable us to realize that without the leader-
 ship of the party, it would be impossible for the people to exercise their
 right as masters in dealing with problems which are relatively wide in
 scope or complicated, let alone problems related to revolution and con-
 struction among millions of people.  Therefore, a democracy that throws
 away the leadership of the party cannot be a socialist democracy.  It only
 means worshipping the spontaneousness of the masses and being the tail of
 the masses.  It will inevitably result in going against the will of the
 majority and harming their interests.
 However, the party's leadership involves mainly the formulation of the
 correct line, principles and policies and the gradual raising, through
 ideological and political work and the exemplary and guiding role of party
 members,'of the people's awareness and the work of guiding them in fighting
 for their own interests.  The party does not exercise its leadership over
 the people but among them.  Just as it was impossible in the past for the
 party to act single-handedly to seize state power in place of the people,
 it is impossible now for the party to exercise the people's right as
 masters in their place.   It can only organize and support the people in
 exercising their rights as masters.  In the opinion of some comrades, the
 party's leadership conflicts with democracy and democracy is at best
 nothing but form.   This has given rise to ideas and activities of
 neglecting the development of the system of democracy and failing to observe
 the law approved by the legislature of the people.  By so doing, they will
 inevitably become divorced from the masses and weaken and impair socialist
 democracy and the legal system.  Moreover, when the party's leadership com-
 mits mistakes and encroaches on the people's interests in dealing with some
 problems, we will not be able to promptly correct it.  We have learned very
 profound lessons on this in the past.  We should understand that the party
 is a part of the people.  The party leads the people to set up the system
 of democracy and formulate the constitution and law.   This system, constitu-
 tion and law embody both the party's line, principles and policies on the
 one hand and the whole people's common interests and will on the other,
 reflecting the fact that the party's leadership and the people's exercise
 of the right as masters coincide.  Therefore, the party must take the lead
 in implementing and observing this system, constitution and law.  The
 "report" particularly stresses the principle that "the party must act
 within the scope allowed by the constitution and law."  It demands that the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 activities of all party members and organizations including both the central
 and the basic levels must be in accordance with the constitution and law of
 the state.  This shows that the party takes the lead and respects the
 peoplets rights.  As for the activities of some cadres who, under the
 pretext of exercising the party's leadership, use their power of office to
 pursue their private interests and privileges and violate the democratic
 system and the law of the state, they can never be regarded as exercising
 the party's leadership.  On the contrary, they directly undermine the
 party's leadership.  Of course, these activities must be strictly banned.
 In short, our party's principle and policies on the theoretical relation-
 ship between developing democracy and strengthening democracy are clear and
 correct.  Some specific systems and measures have to be formulated after
 we have made further practical investigations and summed up our experience.
 The key is to strive to improve the party's leadership while adhering to it.
 All our party members must pay attention to the development of democracy,
 establish an intimate and trusting relationship with the masses of people
 and their representative organs, and promote the development of the social-
 ist democratic system and legal system by their exemplary actions in
 respecting democracy and observing the law.

 A RELIABLE GUARANTEE FOR SOCIALIST CONSTRUCTION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 pp 19-23
 [Article by Shao Huaze [6730 5478 3419]]
 [Text]  Vigorously strengthening the modernization of national defense and
 further consolidating it is a reliable guarantee for the people of the
 whole country devotedly to carry out socialist construction.
 In his report to the 12th CPC National Congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang put
 forward to the whole party and the people of the whole country the task of
 strengthening national defense.  We must see the importance of this task
 and vigorously carry it out by linking it with our country's situation in
 the international arena. and with the overall situation in our country's
 socialist construction.
 Modernization of National Defense Is an Important Part of Socialist
 Modernization and a Strong Guarantee for Socialist Construction
 The 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee formulated the
 strategic policy of shifting the focus of party and state work to modern
 socialist economic construction.  This policy was set forth on the basis
 of the principal contradictions which needed to be resolved at home and
 also on the basis of our experiences and lessons of the past.  It
 reflected the eager wish and basic interests of the people of the whole
 country.
 In order to concentrate our energies on carrying out socialist moderniza-
 tion, we need a sustained, consolidated political situation of stability
 and unity at home as well as a peaceful international environment.  In his
 report entitled "The Current Situation and Tasks" delivered on 16 January
 1980, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said:  "As far as China is concerned, our
 foreign policy is to seek a peaceful environment in which to accomplish
 the four modernizations."  "This is a major issue compatible not only with
 the interests of the Chinese people but with those of the people of the
 whole world."
 However, unlike domestic affairs, international affairs are not decided
 exclusively by us.  In the world at present, the superpowers are engaged in

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 fierce competition for their own benefits and for global domination.  They
 are the main cause of unrest and turmoil in the world.  The flames of war
 are raging in many places.  The 1980's will be a decade marked by great
 turbulence and riddled with crises.  Of course, the consciousness of the
 people of the world is widening and the forces against hegemonism are
 developing.  Experience shows that the people of the world can upset the
 superpowers' strategic plans through persistent, unremitting struggle.
 World peace can be maintained provided the people of the whole world are
 truly united and struggle resolutely against hegemonism and expansionism
 of all kinds.  However, possibility is not reality.  Take China's actual
 environment for example.  The Soviet Union has amassed heavy troops in its
 areas bordering on China and in areas in Mongolia bordering on China.  It
 supports Vietnam in its invasion and occupation of Kampuchea, expansionism
 in Indochina and Southeast Asia and continuous provocation in areas border-
 ing on China.  It invaded and occupied Afghanistan, China's neighbor, by
 armed force.
 We are carrying out socialist construction under international conditions-
 in which the world is far from tranquil and the danger of war still exists,
 and in a situation in which China's security is seriously threatened.  For
 this reason, we must never slacken our vigilance and must strengthen the
 modernization of our national defense.
 Strengthening our national defense is closely related to seeking a peaceful
 international environment.  In seeking a peaceful environment for socialist
 construction, we need a correct foreign policy on the one hand and a consoli-
 dated national defense on the other.  Both are indispensable.  Hegemonists
 and other reactionary forces are bent on increasing actual strength to attain
 their goal of aggression and expansion.  In order to cope with their aggres-
 sion, we should definitely develop our own actual strength.  When our actual
 strength (including our economic resources, political power and defense
 capability) is augmented, they will be forced to refrain from making reck-
 less moves against us.  Should they be blinded by lust for gain and stub-
 bornly invade us, we will have full confidence in defeating them in battle.
 For this reason, based on the interests of our state and nation and those
 of defending world peace, we regard the modernization of our national defense
 as an organic component of the four modernizations.  Building a powerful
 national defense is an important part of socialist modernization and an
 important guarantee for socialist construction.  Socialist China is a
 peace-loving country which has a strong defense capability.  Should anyone
 dare to launch a war of aggression against China, a crushing defeat is the
 only answer for them.
 Our Policy Is To Strengthen National Defense on the Basis of Vigorously
 Developing Economic Construction
 Building up national defense is a matter of great importance.  However,
 strengthening national defense involves questions of both policy and
 guiding ideology.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 The building up of national defense has different parts, involves work in
 many aspects and requires the existence of various conditions.  The most
 important prerequisite is the development of the national economy.  Building
 up national defense by taking it as an isolated matter is one policy;
 strengthening national defense on the basis of economic development is
 another.  Practice shows that only 'the latter policy is correct and effec-
 tive.  This correct policy was first put forth by Comrade Mao Zedong in his
 famous report. entitled "On the Ten Major Relationships" delivered in 1956.
 He said:  "We must strengthen our national defense, and to that end we must
 first of all strengthen our work in economic construction." "Only with faster
 growth in economic construction can there be greater progress in the building
 up of national defense."
 According to the Marxist viewpoint, economic resources are the material
 basis of violence.  Modern defense and modern warfare have become more
 dependent on the economy.  As a result of the rapid progress in science and
 technology and the increasing modernization of industry and communications,
 defense equipment and installations need to be improved constantly and the
 weapons and other equipment of the armed.forces also need to be renewed
 from time to time.  This inevitably entails a tremendous increase in defense
 spending, both financially and materially.  The needs and consumption of
 materials in modern warfare are beyond comparison with that in old-type
 warfare:  Take the recent Malvinas war between Britain and Argentina for
 example.  The war lasted for'more than 70 days, inflicting heavy material
 damage and losses on both sides.  Reportedly, Btitain spent about $2 billion
 on this expedition.  Of course, whatever the conditions in which a modern
 war is fought and no matter how modern the weapons may be, political and
 human factors play a final, decisive role in determining whether a war
 will end in triumph or defeat.
 The "theory that weapons are'decisive" in war was wrong in the past and
 still is wrong today.  Yet, the grim reality is that weapons are playing
 an ever-increasing role in war.  Failing to realize or neglecting this
 point will surely lead to mistakes.
 Undeniably, under the party's leadership and with the vigorous efforts of
 the people of the whole country over the past 33 years, we have won enormous
 achievements in building our national defense, and our army has expanded from
 a land force into a comprehensive army also including air and naval forces
 and other technical units.  Relying on our own efforts, we have devised and
 produced the atom and hydrogen bombs, long-range guided missiles and other
 sophisticated strategic weapons for self-defense.  We-see this as something
 to be proud of.  This is an important factor deterring the imperialists
 from launching a large-scale invasion against us.  However, generally speak-
 ing, our weapons and equipment are relatively backward; they are restricted
 chiefly by the levels of economic development of our country.  Modernization
 of national defense can only be a gradual process.
 For this reason, we must correctly handle the relationship between building
 up the economy and building up national defense.  The?'general principle
 guiding this relationship is, as pointed out in the "Resolution on Certain

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC"
 adopted by the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, that
 "the building up of national defense must be in keeping with the building
 up of the economy" and, as pointed out by Comrade Hu Yaobang in his report
 to the 12th CPC National Congress, that "our national defense must be
 strengthened on the basis of vigorous economic development."
 The 12th CPC National Congress put forward the objective of our country's
 economic construction for the last two decades of this century.  Once this
 objective is realized, our country will have much greater economic strength
 and defense capability.  In this sense, while striving to realize this
 great strategic objective of economic construction, we are vigorously
 strengthening national defense.  If our tasks, including the building up
 of national defense, are separated from the central link of economic con-
 struction and impede economic development, the building up of national
 defense will inevitably be impeded; this does not accord with the people's
 interests.
 On the other hand, with the daily development of the economy and the
 gradual improvement in people's livelihood, national defense should be
 modernized continuously.  National defense should be supplied with increas-
 ingly better material and technical conditions and with ever better weapons
 and equipment which it needs.  In drawing up plans for the development of
 industry, transportation, science and education, attention should be paid
 to the needs of building up national defense and launching a war against
 aggression in the future.  From the viewpoint of national defense, first
 we should do what we are capable of doing, and second, we should strive to
 do it well.  The first means that the scale and speed of building up
 national defense should be appropriate, should not go beyond the limits of
 our national financial and material capacities and should not affect the
 speed of economic construction.  The second means that the limited finan-
 cial and material resources should be used properly by bringing subjective
 initiative into full play and by adopting the various effective measures
 of having better troops and simpler administration and strictly practicing
 economy, so as to attain the greatest possible results.  As far as the army
 is concerned, it must continuously improve its weapons and equipment and
 make full use of the existing ones so as to win victory with the available
 weapons and equipment.  The building up of our national defense will develop
 steadily provided we adopt this correct policy.
 Strive To Build the PLA Into a Regular, Modern and Powerful Revolutionary
 Army
 The key to modernizing national defense is to build a regular, modern and
 powerful revolutionary army.
 Our PLA has developed in the fire of a protracted revolutionary war.  It is
 a completely new type of people's army led by the party, and numerous facts
 have proved that it is an army with powerful combat effectiveness.  After
 the smashing of the "gang of four" and especially since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, just as Comrade Hu Yaobang

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 pointed out in his report to the 12th party congress:  "The PLA has
 achieved marked successes in improving its military training and its
 ideological and political work, in bettering its relations with the civil
 authorities and the people, in defending our frontiers and safeguarding
 national security and in helping socialist construction.  It has further
 enhanced its military capability and political consciousness in line with
 the new historical conditions."  We firmly believe that by working hard on
 this basis, the tempo of army building can certainly be accelerated.
 New conditions, which did not exist before, have appeared in contemporary
 warfare.  The most salient feature is three-dimensional warfare.  It means
 that warfare will be simultaneously carried out in the air, on land and at
 sea, and it will be difficult to differentiate between the frontline and
 the rear areas.  To adapt to the demands ofthis kind of warfare, we must
 further build the PLA into a powerful composite army able to operate in
 concert with various branches of the services under modern conditions.
 The organizational system, weaponry, strategy and tactics as well as cadre
 training of the army must be oriented in this direction.
 The state of weaponry has an important bearing on the formation, establish-
 ment,. strategy and tactics of the army.  The appearance of modern weapons
 and the extensive application of the latest achievements of science and
 technology in war have presented numerous new problems to the pattern,
 strategy and tactics of warfare as well as to military organization.  The
 PLA is now engaged in the world of readjusting, reorganizing and restruc-
 turing.  It has implemented the policy of improving the quality of the
 troops, simplified the leadership structure, strengthened the composition
 of all service arms and intensified composite training.  This is a policy
 decision of great significance.  The implementation of the policy of
 readjustment will further improve.the combat effectiveness of our army.
 In the building of modern armed forces, the organization and command of
 warfare under modern conditions require large numbers of qualified person-
 nel in the military, political and logistic fields.  In the war years of
 the past, our party and Comrade Mao Zedong explicitly called for "learning
 warfare through warfare."  This correct policy destroyed the aura of
 mystery surrounding military work for the whole party, successfully trained
 large numbers of military personnel who were brave and skillful in battle
 as well as loyal to the people, and resulted in the victory of the revolu-
 tionary war.  Today's conditions are different.  Qualified personnel who
 can organize and direct contemporary warfare must be fostered by relying
 on strict regular training in times of peace.  In 1975 Comrade Deng
 Xiaoping proposed that the army raise the strategic position of education
 and training.  In recent years, close attention has been paid to army
 training and the contents and methods of training have been reformed to
 meet the demands of future operations.  All categories of military
 colleges at all levels have become better and better run, and outstanding
 results have been achieved.  The modern military attainments of the cadres
 have rapidly improved, and the basic level cadres who have mastered the
 tactical skill and specialized ability of fighting under modern conditions
 are maturing.  In the past, the battle fought continuously for more than

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 20 years meant that units possessed a large number of veteran cadres who had
 been tempered and tested for a long time in warfare as the backbone force
 in our army building.
 This Constituted the distinguishing feature and the superiority of our
 army. In recent years, a large number of young and middle-aged cadres with
 both ability and political integrity who are full of vigor and in good
 physical condition have also been constantly promoted to leading posts at
 all levels.  This has injected new blood into the cadre contingent and
 made it more vigorous.  Given the tasks and demands of the army, making
 the cadres more revolutionary, younger in age, better educated and pro-
 fessionally more competent is of paramount importance.  The proper solving
 of the problems of training cadres and making them younger in age will be
 of important significance to developing a new situation in army building.
 Regardless of how weaponry will change or how different the pattern and
 scale of warfare will be, the morale, combat will and spirit of sacrifice
 of the army members play a very important role in the outcome of a battle.
 We have-absolute superiority in this respect.  The commanders and fighters
 of our army are loyal to the motherland and the people, and their revolu-
 tionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death and their strict and
 conscious discipline are world famous.   In the protracted revolutionary
 war, the PLA established a complete set of ideological and political work
 policies, principles and methods which. guaranteed its consolidation,
 raised morale and strengthened organizational discipline.  During the 10
 years of internal disorder, the fine tradition of army ideological and
 political work was severely damaged.  After the smashing of the "gang of
 four" and especially since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
 Committee, this tradition has been restored and carried forward.
 In the building of socialist spiritual civilization, based on its own
 characteristics, the army has developed "four haves, three stresses and
 two fear nots" (have ideals, ethics, knowledge and physical strength,
 stress military appearance, manners and discipline, fearing neither hard-
 ship. nor death) activities, and outstanding results have been obtained
 within a short time.  A large number of advanced collectives and advanced
 individuals have appeared, and.a profound change has taken place in the
 spiritual aspect of the army.  Along with the more extensive and pene-
 trating development of these activities and the further strengthening and
 improvement in ideological and political work, the revolutionization of the
 army will be raised to a new level.  Our army has come from the people.
 It serves the people and has flesh-and-blood ties with the masses.  The
 people also always use this profile of the image of the army to judge our
 party and state.   The quality of the spiritual face of the army has a very
 important effect on the prestige of the party and the dignity of the
 motherland and also plays a' very important role in improving party style
 and popular custom and building the whole of socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion.                The report to the 12th party congress proposed that "our army will
 serve not only as a Great Wall of steel guarding our socialist motherland
 but also as an important force in building our socialist material and
 spiritual civilization."  This shows the high degree of confidence placed

 by the CPC Central Committee on the army, and is a glorious task the army
 should and also must certainly undertake.
 According to the teachings of Marxist-Leninist countries, the army is an
 important component of the state mechanism.  The "Draft of the Revised
 Constitution of the People's Republic of China" which will soon be sub-
 mitted to the National People's Congress for consideration, has given a
 new definition on the position of the army in the state system and stipu-
 lated the setting up of a Central Military Commission of the state.  This
 has been made as a result of summing up historical experiences and proceed-
 ing from our country's actual conditions and needs.  This stipulation does
 not in any way abolish or weaken the leadership of the party over the army.
 The PLA is a people's army created and led by the CPC.  History has proved
 that the leadership of the party over the army is essential for the inter-
 ests of the state and the people and definitely cannot be shaken.
 The preamble of the "draft of the revised constitution" has already clearly
 affirmed the leadership role of the party over the state and naturally also
 includes leadership over the part of the army belonging to the state.  The
 various effective systems of the party leading the army, which have been
 practiced for a long time, must continue to be upheld.  This is the basic
 guarantee for always preserving the quality of a people's army as well as
 the basic guarantee for speeding up the building of a modern regular army,
 and completely accords with the greatest interests of the people throughout
 the country.
 Construction of Strong National Defense Must Rely on the Joint Efforts of
 People Throughout the Country Under Party Leadership
 National defense modernization is one of the objectives of struggle for
 people throughout the country put forward by the party.  National defense
 construction covers many fields.  It is not the business of one or two
 departments nor is it just the business of the army.  Strengthening
 national defense includes raising the combat effectiveness of the people's
 army, and this can only be achieved by relying on the joint efforts of the
 army'and people under the unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee.
 Under peaceful conditions, improving the people's understanding of national
 defense is an important matter.  We must not waver in the least and must
 always adhere to this point of taking economic construction as the basis.
 However, we must guard against the misunderstanding among some of the com-
 rades who seem to think that national defense construction is no longer so
 important.  Our construction must as far as possible strive for a peaceful
 international environment.  However, we cannot, because of a peaceful life,
 adopt the attitude of lowering our guard and slackening our vigilance.  In
 particular, members of the PLA absolutely cannot slacken their combat will
 in the slightest, and they must be mentally prepared at all times to cope
 with all possible emergencies.  Not having a concept of national defense
 will greatly affect national defense construction in normal times and
 anti-aggression wars in the future.  Lenin, at the Ninth All-Russia Congress
 of Soviets, said:  "Having started on our work of peaceful development we
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 shall exert every effort to continue it without interruption.. At the same
 time, comrades, be vigilant, safeguard the defense potential of our coun-
 try and strengthen our Red Army to the utmost."  Under the premise of
 engaging in peaceful development, Lenin's decision to educate the people
 not to slacken their attitude of taking precautions was farsighted and
 showed a high degree of responsibility toward the interests of the state
 and the people.  This is still of guiding significance to us today.
 The strengthening of unity between the PLA, the civil authorities, the army
 and the people and the correct handling of relations between the army and
 its localities have an extremely important bearing on the construction and
 consolidation of national defense.  The PLA is an army composed of the sons
 of the people and the relations between the army and people are inseparable
 as fish and water.  If the army becomes separated from the people, it will
 not be able to move a single step.  In the past, our people needed a power-
 ful army for their own emancipation.  After victory, they also needed a
 powerful army in order to keep their minds at rest for labor.  For a long
 time, under the leadership of the party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the PLA not
 only developed close unity with the people but also created a series of
 correct principles and methods for handling the relations between the army
 and the locality.  In recent years, for the sake of eliminating the mis-
 takes of the "Great Cultural Revolution" and especially the aftermath
 caused by the sabotage of the Lin Biao-Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary
 cliques, the army and the locality have carried out a great deal of work
 under the leadership of the party, and unity between the army and people
 has greatly strengthened.
 In the battlefield on the self-defense counterattack operation against
 Vietnam, in the struggle to combat calamities and deal with emergencies,
 in urban as well as rural areas and in coastal as well as frontier
 defenses, stirring deeds of the army cherishing the people and the people
 supporting the army can be seen everywhere.  Such patriotic advanced models
 in supporting the army as Zhao Chenni and Ma Yaozhi, who bravely accepted
 difficulties for the sake of army building and defending the motherland,
 have greatly inspired the cadres and fighters of the units.  Such combat
 heroes as Yang Chaofen and Yan Long, who gave their young lives in defense
 of 'the frontier of the motherland, have filled the masses with a sense of
 incomparable pride.   The army supporting the government and cherishing the
 people, the locality supporting the army dependents and the strong unity
 between the army and people have been a source of strength in the past and
 will still be a source of strength in the future.  We must carefully
 treasure this kind of unity, use various practical actions to strengthen it
 and build a strong wall of steel which will strike fear into the hearts of
 the enemies and give the people peace of mind.
 The war against aggression of the future will be a people's war under
 modern conditions.  Comrade Mao Zedong's great thinking on people's war
 will still be an important magic weapon of ours for vanquishing the enemy.
 In the war of the future, the militia will still haveta vital indispensable
 position as well as role.  In carrying out better troops and simpler admin-
 istration, the army should appropriately further strengthen militia work

 and properly carry out the reserve service. system and the mobilization
 system. If militia building is properly grasped, the army will have a
 strong backbone force and will be able to drown the invading enemy in the
 ocean of a people's war.
 As early as in 1950, Comrade Mao Zedong said to the representatives of
 combat heroes and labor models of the whole country:  "China must build a
 powerful national defense army and a powerful economic force.  These are
 the two major things.  The success of these two things depends on the com-
 rades, together with all the commanders and fighters of the PLA as well as
 the workers, peasants and other people throughout the country uniting as
 one and working in cooperation." Today, if the army and people of the whole
 country mobilize themselves and bring their initiative and creativity into
 play under the leadership of the party, the grand task of developing the
 national economy, the task of strengthening national defense and various
 other tasks can all be successfully fulfilled.

 CORRECTLY UNDERSTAND OUR COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENT FOREIGN POLICY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 pp 24-28
 [Article by Qi Wen [7871 2429]]
 [Text] In his report to the 12th CPC National Congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang
 systematically elaborated our country's independent foreign policy.   The
 CPC Constitution adopted by the congress also expounded the fundamental
 stand of the CPC in international affairs.  Consistently adhering to the
 five principles of peaceful coexistence, China will continue to develop
 its relations with foreign countries, unswervingly strengthen its unity
 with Third World countries, ally itself with all the forces that can be
 allied with and struggle to oppose imperialism, hegemony and colonialism,
 safeguard world peace and promote the progress and striving of mankind.
 For every country in the world today, the question of what foreign policy
 to carry out is of prime importance.  Nearly 150 years ago, Marx and Engels
 pointed out, in "The Manifesto of the Communist Party":  "Production and
 consumption in all countries have assumed cosmopolitan characteristics ... in
 place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have
 comings and goings between all peoples and places and mutual inter-
 dependence on all sides.  As in material, so also is the case in intellec-
 tual production."  This quotation tells us how the world became a complete
 entity as soon as capitalism took shape and every country became, willingly
 or unwillingly, an inseparable part of this world.  It was in this course of
 capitalism's expansion throughout the world that backward and feudal China
 was forced to open its door -and be involved in the process of the whole
 world's development.  This is a process which cannot be resisted and which
 can also be extraordinarily painful.  From the mid-19th century onward,
 China'deteriorated from being a great country with an ancient civilization
 into a semicolony.
 For fully 109 years, from the Opium War to the founding of the PRC, China,
 through being forced to engage in intercourse with foreign countries and
 playing the role of being bullied, oppressed and trampled upon, had no
 independent foreign policy of its own.  This long and miserable experience
 did not end until the Chinese people, under the leadership of the CPC,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 defeated all agents of imperialism and founded the PRC in 1949.  One of the
 most valuable achievements of the Chinese revolution was the recovery of
 China's national independence.  The Chinese people, from being bullied and
 oppressed, now turned into a nation able to control its.own destiny, take
 the.initiative in pushing ahead with the world's development and make its
 own contributions to mankind.  This really was an earth-shaking change.
 It is not easy for an oppressed nation to recover its independence.  It is
 not easy either to implement a completely independent foreign policy after
 recovering independence.  Since imperialism and hegemony are still at large
 in the world and constantly exert pressure on those countries which have
 newly recovered independence, the implementation of an independent foreign
 policy is in itself a course of struggle.
 In his opening address given to the 12th CPC National Congress, Comrade
 Deng Xiaoping pointed out:  "While we Chinese people value our friendship
 and cooperation with other countries and peoples, we value even more our
 hard-won independence and sovereign rights.  No.foreign country. can expect
 China to be its vassal, nor can it expect China to swallow any bitter fruit
 harmful to China's interests."  This is a concise summary of our country's
 foreign policy, which embodies the spirit of independence and sovereign
 rights.
 Independence and sovereign rights are completely consistent with inter-
 nationalism.  As a socialist country led by the CPC, the PRC believes that
 all nations in the world will, sooner or later, take the socialist and
 communist path; that only through the ultimate liberation of mankind can
 the proletariat of every couptry attain its own liberation; and that only
 through the general development of the whole world can every nation attain
 its own goal.  In the final analysis, the interests of all nations entirely
 coincide.  We cherish our nation's interests, and respect other nations'
 interests as well.  For this`reason Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed out in his
 report:  "Integration of patriotism with internationalism has always been
 our basic point of departure in handling our external relations."
 As everyone knows, different classes have different points of view on
 "national interest."  The difference between proletarian internationalism
 and bourgeois nationalism lies in the latter seeking only a nation's
 selfish interests while the'former always considers a nation's own inter-
 ests and mankind's interests as a whole.  As their points of departure are
 different, their practices are naturally different.
 In implementing bourgeois nationalist foreign policy there are two situa-
 tions'and two guiding principles.  1) In the situation of weak national
 power, if the nation does not depend on a certain powerful country or bloc,
 it thinks itself clever and plays the "card game" of international politics.
 The treacherous diplomacy of the rulers of old China was a shame, and the
 trick of "setting the barbarians against the barbarians" which they played
 was nothing more than a standing joke.  2) In the situation where a state

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 is strong, the bourgeois nationalists of the state can become chauvinist
 and expansionist, or even imperialist and hegemonist.  As a result, they
 infringe upon other nations' interests,.and in turn make their own nation
 the object of resentment and. resistance in the eyes of other nations.
 Finally, they will be isolated in the world and thus bring disaster to
 their own, nation.  Many countries took this road in the past and some
 countries are still following this old road today.
 Old China was for a long time a weak, enormous country.  Accordingly, when
 our people won the victory of,revolution, we summed up our own and other
 people's experience in these two situations, upheld our own stand which
 embodies the integration of patriotism and internationalism and persistently
 oppose bourgeois nationalism.
 On the eve of the birth of the PRC, Comrade Mao Zedong declared, with
 dauntless proletarian revolutionary spirit:  "China must be independent and
 China must be liberated.  The Chinese people want to handle China's affairs
 on their own and can tolerate no intervention by any imperialist country.
 ..No matter how the latter may continue to oppose the Chinese people, we ~~
 Chinese people will always be able to find a way to win the final victory."
 Soon after the founding of the republic, Comrade Mao Zedong again taught us
 to "resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely wipe out great nation
 chauvinism."  Later, in view of the harm brought to the people of the world
 by the superpowers' hegemonism, Comrade Mao Zedong declared again that we
 would never be a superpower and seek hegemony.
 It is in the above two aspects that China's foreign policy, which is formu-
 lated under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, has drawn
 a demarcation line between itself and bourgeois nationalism.  At the First
 Session of the First National People's Congress, Comrade Mao Zedong also
 definitely pointed out:  "Our general task is to unite the whole people
 and win the support of all our friends abroad in the-struggle to build a
 great socialist country, defend world peace and advance the cause of human
 progress."
 Here, he meant that we must try to obtain aid from others as well as provide
 aid for others and defend our national interests as well as fulfill our
 international obligations.  In fact, in the last 30 years or more, we have,
 successfully withstood all the pressure imposed on us by imperialism and
 hegemonism.  In the Korean war and the Vietnam war, we also courageously
 made national sacrifices in the struggle to save world peace.  As to other.
 Third World countries which are engaged in the struggle for political and
 economic independence, we never hesitate to provide aid.  Many examples are
 available to support our claim that we are by no means parochial nationalists
 but are, rather, unwavering internationalists.
 Marxism-Leninism not only encompasses the proletariat's world outlook but
 also their struggle strategies and policies.  Because we have always kept in
 mind the overall world situation when handling foreign relations, we have
 been able to, in the light of the basic situation of each historical stage,
 stipulate our struggling tasks for the specific stage, clearly analyze the

 relationship between our enemies, our friends and ourselves, distinguish
 friends from enemies, major enemies from minor enemies, and direct allies
 from indirect allies, and thus correctly estimate our force in opposition
 to that of our enemies, and work out correct strategies to provide a con-
 crdte base for implementing foreign policy.  Therefore, our foreign policy
 has shown a valuable steadfastness and continuity.
 International affairs are extremely complicated.  Some unexpected thing may
 emerge at any moment to bring about unexpected turmoil.  Because of our
 scientific world outlook and a long-term strategy, we have been able to
 integrate our firm principles with feasible measures.  We have been able
 to be free from the influence and control of chance occurrences, and we
 have never been dictated to or deceived by our momentary emotional reaction.
 As Lenin remarked, accommodating oneself to temporary situations means
 practicing opportunism.  We have never practiced opportunism but have
 consistently advanced toward our goal.
 In the light of the above-mentioned characteristics, we can say that we are
 implementing a completely and genuinely independent foreign policy.  Our
 foreign policy enjoys a high prestige and has won for China an honorable
 image in the international arena.
 The five principles of "mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial
 integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal
 affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence" have
 consistently guided China in its efforts to develop relations with all
 other countries in the world.
 In April 1954, the newly independent China and India initiated these five
 principles in the "agreement concerning trade and transport between China's
 Xizang and India."  In June of the same year, when Premier Zhou Enlai was
 visiting India, he and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru incorporated
 these principles in the Sino-Indian joint communique.  These five prin-
 ciples show that we treasure, our hard-won independence, respect other
 countries' independence and resolutely oppose aggression against the
 independence and sovereignty of all countries.  The five principles also
 demonstrate correctly the position of a great majority of countries, par-
 ticularly of the newly independent countries in the world of today.
 Precisely because of this, the ideas of the five principles have met with
 a wide response over the past 30 years.  In many bilateral treaties and
 agreements, and in many international documents and manifestoes, similar
 wording to the five principles has been used to express the ideas of mutual
 respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression,
 and noninterference in each other's internal affairs.  A good example can
 be seen in the 10 principles set forth in the final manifesto of the Afro-
 Asian conference held in Bandung, Indonesia in 1955.
 It can be said that today the five principles have found deep resonance in
 the hearts of the people of the world and have become a universal norm in

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 guiding relations between states.  The norm of violence is often repudiated
 by public opinion.  The five principles have already replaced the imperial-
 ist logic of "might is right" which ran rampant in international life
 before World War II.  In the`international life of today, if we say that
 due to the existence of hegemonism the five principles are still not able
 to be implemented thoroughly, we can say nevertheless that these principles
 have at least become a powerful force of morality and justice and have
 become undeniable legal principles in international law.  This is an impor-
 tant progression in the international relations of the present age.
 ?         With regard to international'relations in general, our five principles are
 suitable for all countries.  Some people say Lenin advanced the principle
 of peaceful coexistence to guide relations between socialist countries and
 nonsocialist countries.  For this reason, this principle is not applicable
 to the relations between socialist countries.  In fact, at the time when
 Lenin proposed peaceful coexistence, there was only one socialist country
 in the world.   However, historical experience gained since the emergence of
 other socialist countries in the world, shows that relations between social-
 ist countries should also be built on the basis of the five principles.  Of
 course, socialist countries enjoy similar social systems.  In theory, they
 all take Marxism-Leninism as their common faith and, in practice, they take
 proletarian internationalism as their universal standard, so there should
 be more exteisive cooperation and closer relationship between them.  How-
 ever, the prerequisite to such a relationship must be strict adherence to
 the five. principles.  Meanwhile, socialist countries must play an exemplary
 role in implementing the five principles.   Just as Lenin said:   "If the
 proletariat allows its nation to practice even the slightest violence
 against other nations, then it is not a socialist proletariat."
 With respect to bilateral relations, our five principles do not repel any
 country.  China is willing to establish and develop normal diplomatic
 relations with any country if it can follow the five principles not only in
 word but also in deed.  Naturally, it is hard to avoid contradictions
 between countries.  Precisely due to such contradictions, it is necessary
 to find reasonable solutions to them through application of the five prin-.
 ciples so that relations between countries can continue to develop normally.
 As for those hegemonist countries which disregard China's sovereignty and
 attempt to force China to be subject to their interests, we cannot but wage
 a resolute struggle against them until they recognize that China's
 sovereignty brooks no violence and its security brooks no threat.  Then,
 we will develop our normal relations with them on the basis of the five
 principles.  But this must not, to the slightest degree, hamper our free
 initiative of opposing their policy of seeking hegemony over other coun-
 tries.  The course of carrying out the five principles is also the course
 of measuring strength against the hegemonists.  Upholding peaceful
 coexistence and fighting against hegemony are two aspects of the same
 thing.

 What force in the world today, is threatening the independence of various
 countries and world peace?  First and foremost, it is the hegemonism
 pursued by the superpowers.
 As is well known, through two world wars, particularly after the victory
 of the Chinese revolution, the old colonial system of imperialism fell
 apart with the independence of many colonial and semicolonial countries.
 But, its remnants are still to be found..  In addition, the superpowers
 seeking hegemony have taken the place of the old imperialists, consti-
 tuting a new menace to the peoples of all countries of the world.  Each of
 them is now operating its war machine with enormous military expenditure
 on a scale unprecedented in peacetime in human history.
 They are irreconcilably rivaling with each other in almost all regions of
 the world.  They are interfering in other countries' internal affairs by
 every means possible, even resorting to military force.  They are occupying
 the territory of other countries through their agents, or even directly
 dispatching their troops.  Through their eyes, they see only their strategic
 interest and do not see the interests of other nations at all.  After World
 War II, regional wars have not ceased on the earth. Until now there are
 still many "hot spots," such as the Soviet aggressive war in Afghanistan,
 Vietnam's aggressive war in Kampuchea, the war of the Israeli invaders
 against the Palestinian and Arab peoples and the war against African people
 in South Africa.  All these wars were hatched up, supported and instigated
 by the superpowers, or they are taking part in them themselves.  The
 rivalry between them has become a main source of turbulence and disturbance
 in the world today.
 The Chinese people share a common wish with the people of all other coun-
 tries in the world, a wish to build their own countries in peaceful world
 surroundings.  In order to seek peace and progress and to build their
 countries, the people of the'world have to fight against hegemonism in the
 face of the war menace of the superpowers seeking hegemony.   To this end,
 our strategic principle in international affairs is to cement unity with
 the proletariat, the oppressed nations and people of the world and to unite
 all peace-loving and justice-upholding forces in the world in a joint effort
 to oppose imperialism, hegemonism and colonialism, safeguard world peace
 and promote human progress.
 In the struggle to oppose imperialism, hegemonism and colonialism, the
 .Third World is playing a very important role.  This is because the countries
 of the Third World, including China, suffered the most cruel exploitation
 and oppression at the hands of imperialists and colonialists in history and
 today they are also the main victims of hegemonism.  Therefore, they are
 the most staunch fighters in the struggle against imperialism, hegemonism
 and colonialism.  The rise of the Third World is a major sign of the great
 changes in the world situation today.  The number of people in the countries
 of the Third World constitutes three-quarters of the world's population.
 Divorced from the vast Third World, international justice and human progress

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 would be meaningless.  More than 100 countries in the Third World spread to
 every corner of the world, covering over two-thirds of the earth's surface.
 They are the main force in the struggle against hegemonism because they can
 curb and tie up the major forces of the hegemonist superpowers and can foil
 their war schemes.
 In accordance with Lenin's theory that imperialism divides nations in the
 world into the oppressors and the oppressed, and that the international
 proletariat must fight together with the oppressed nations, and in
 accordance with his call for unity between the international proletariat
 and the oppressed nations, we must attach importance to the unity of people
 of the various countries in the Third World.
 Some people look down on the countries in the Third World because most of
 them today are comparatively backward in economy and weak in military
 strength.  Such people also hold that the Third World can hardly play a big
 role in international affairs.   But, if we look at this problem with an eye
 on the course of its development, we say such views are groundless.  As a
 matter of fact, the Third World has become a gigantic progressive force in
 the world after the former colonies and semicolonies achieved independence
 one after another.  It has changed and is still profoundly changing the
 look of the world.  The situation in which only a few powers control the
 destiny of the world is gone forever.  For years the United Nations was a
 place where the big powers were tampering with the voting machine.  Now,
 it has turned into a place where all kinds of hegemonism are repudiated or
 are-put on trial.  In this world organization and on other international
 rostrums, many just resolutions are passed with the support or sponsorship
 of the Third World.
 For example, the struggle launched by Latin American countries to oppose
 the superpowers' domination over oceans, and the struggle waged by oil
 export countries and other raw materials-producing countries for a
 sovereign right over their own natural resources have all achieved great
 success.  Are all these not facts which many people could not imagine in
 the past'and also cannot negate now?  In opposing power politics and bloc
 politics, the nonaligned movement, which comprises many Third World coun-
 tries, has dealt a heavy blow at the hegemonism of the superpowers.  The
 movement for establishing a new international economic order is now, with
 the participation of many countries of the Third World, pounding at the
 present international economic order which is unequal and unfair.  This is
 a movement of great strategic significance.  Although.there is no demand
 for forming a united front among countries of the Third World, nevertheless,
 they have identical views and take concerted action in the struggle.  This
 has converged into a mighty torrent, giving an impetus to the development
 of international relations toward equality and democracy.  The development
 of human history is complex and zigzags, but newly emerging things always
 conquer huge monsters which consider themselves unbettered in the world.
 Now we can see that the relatively poor Third World is precisely just such
 a promising new force.

 Apart from wishing constantly strengthening unity with Third World and
 other countries, China also needs to unite with all forces which can be
 united with regardless of whether they are governmental or popular, as long
 as their struggle is helpful to the cause of opposing hegemony and safe-
 guarding world peace.
 As everyone knows, the PRC established diplomatic relations-with many
 developed capitalist countries in Western and northern. Europe just after
 its founding.  We have maintained and developed good economic and cultural
 relations with these countries for many years.  In the last 10 years, we
 established friendly relations with Japan and more Western countries.
 Generally speaking, these relations are beneficial to both sides and have
 already yielded positive results.  We really value these relations and will
 continue to try our best to strengthen them on the basis of the five prin-
 ciples.  To be sure, there exist contradictions between these developed
 capitalist countries and the Third World countries.  However, the former
 are also facing war menace and suffering from the intervention, control and
 oppression exercised by the superpowers.  Therefore, it is not only neces-
 sary but also possible for us to unite with them under certain conditions.
 People all over the world are now carrying out peace campaigns of various
 types in the face of an increasingly serious menace of nuclear war.
 Although the composition of the members engaged in these campaigns, as well
 as their motives, are not completely identical, we always support them as
 long as they are really advantageous to the struggle to oppose hegemony
 and defend world peace.
 We oppose the hegemonist moves and war policy of the superpowers.  Never-
 theless, we always cherish deep feelings toward the broad masses of the
 people of these countries, and try our best to intensify our friendly ties
 with them.
 For a long time, we have emphasized the existence of a serious war threat.
 This is by no means alarmist talk but an inevitable trend which results
 from the scramble for hegemony between the superpowers.  Many facts in the
 last 30-odd years since the end of World War II have shown that the super-
 powers have never stopped trying to launch a world war, only to be checked
 by the people's force time and time again.  As long as the Third World
 countries and all peace-loving forces in the world can really unite
 together and are ready at all times to struggle resolutely against the plans
 of hegemonists, it is possible to continue to maintain a peaceful situation
 in the world.
 As a socialist Third World country, China is dutybound to engage in this
 struggle.  We will strive to preserve a peaceful international environment
 for the magnificent cause of socialist modernization of China, and make our
 contributions to the independence and security of the peoples of all coun-
 tries and the progress of mankind.

 EXCERPTS FROM SPEECHES MADE AT FORUM ON STUDYING THE 12TH CPC CONGRESS
 DOCUMENTS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 pp 29-36
 [Text] Wang Meng [3769 5536]:  "Raise the Ideological Level of Literary
 and Artistic Works and of Writers and Artists"
 Both literature and art are extremely important parts of a lively civiliza-
 tion.                     By looking at literature and art, we are able to see the condition
 of the society itself, the extent of education and the level of culture.
 At the same time, literature and art influence both society and man's
 spiritual world.
 Construction of a high degree of socialist civilization demands a great
 development of the causes of literature and art.  Four years of practical
 experience amply illustrate that the correct policies and directives issued
 by the third plenary session of the party Central Committee guiding lit-
 erary and artistic work, have established a fundamental insurance for the
 development of a new stage in literature and art in China.
 Here I would like to bring up several important points:
 1.  We must raise the ideological level of artistic and literary works and
 offer the masses healthy and ever improving works of art and literature.
 The lofty ideals and great practical experience of communism have imbued
 into our art and literature a hopeful and ever onward struggling spiritual
 force, and it is this which is one of the fundamental characteristics of
 socialist literature.  Despite the number of difficulties and obstacles to
 overcome, we will remain confident in the destiny of our people and the
 future of our homeland.  Of course, we cannot simply shut our eyes at will
 to 'all the problems, suffering and pain which exist in our lives, and our
 art and literature should try to avoid contradictions and should not use
 falsities, exaggerations, etc. in an effort to deceive everyone.  Similarly,
 we cannot turn a blind eye to the progress and victories in our lives nor
 the heroism and creative spirit of the people.  We. must make sure that we
 reflect freshness in life and communist values in practical day-to-day
 living.  Of greater importance is to avoid writing about problems merely
 for the sake of creating problems, or writing about pain for the sake of
 pain.  We must set out to overcome and destroy such pain and problems.

 Thus, a piece of work which concentrates on the judgment of something awful
 should follow the judgment with awe-inspiring righteousness and be written
 in a scientific manner; it should not be a way of expressing one's own
 personal conceit or denying general pride and propagating feelings of
 despair. In describing villains, our aim is to enliven the readers'
 vigilance and alertness and rejection of such concepts and thus gradually
 allow everyone to become a little better and a little more likable and not
 the opposite. It is not difficult to rely on the tears of discontent and
 complaint to influence some naive readers.  Such an attitude is both blind,
 cheap and irresponsible.  Ouc literature and art should call on the
 spiritual strength of the people, on the ideals of communism and on the
 historical and social sense of responsibility of the people, thereby
 admonishing and denouncing the more mediocre and sordid who display
 cynicism, apathy and hopelessness.  Every piece of writing and every work
 of art should display light and warmth, even only to an extent similar to
 that of a matchstick, so that when this light and warmth are added to that
 of other pieces of literature and art, the fused body will be much easier
 to see.
 2.  We must raise the taste and interest of both the writers, artists and
 the masses who read or appreciate literature and art.  Taste is also an
 expression of spiritual civilization.  A piece of literature or art must
 have taste, but there are different levels of taste.  Since the onslaught
 of such distasteful pieces as "looking toward money" and "merchandization,"
 there has been a fairly serious appearance in print and circulation of
 books of very low taste.  Some publishing houses even publish works dis-
 playing feelings of despair, which are held in contempt by academics in
 the Western world.  Some pieces of literature, under the guise of criti-
 cizing, actually make use of and peddle poor and low taste.  Such things
 run counter to our tasks of building a socialist spiritual civilization.
 Artists and writers must not forget that our mission is to climb to the
 pinnacle of socialist spiritual civilization and, under the direction of
 communist ideology, we want to critically carry on and pass down the most
 outstanding riches and artistic treasures and show our disdain for cursory
 and quickly put together low-grade work, struggling to combat poor taste
 and to produce beautiful works of art and pieces of literature of the
 greatest historical level and of utmost richness and talent.
 3.  In constructing a socialist spiritual civilization, we must train and
 bring up many new members of the socialist society, and we must start with
 ourselves.  Because of the very nature of literary and artistic work, it is
 sometimes very easy to become an overnight success and sometimes it is very
 easy for us to become self-conceited and self-satisfied as a result,
 thereby cutting ourselves off from the masses and feeling that we are not
 bound by the spheres of socialist morals and even adopt a supercilious
 attitude.   This is extremely dangerous.  In the past, people such as this
 and their behavior resulted in writers and artists in general dropping in
 the esteem of the masses, and sometimes even resulting in great disgust from
 frontline comrades.  We cannot be too cautious about the appearance of such
 phenomena and must be always on our guard against it.

 Wu Zuqiang [0702 4371 17301:  "Grasp the Building-of Socialist Spiritual
 Civilization With the Same Vigor and Determination as in Grasping the
 Building of Material Civilization"
 In the great announcement by.the party Central Committee referred to as
 "all-round development of a new phase in socialist modernized construction,"
 it was made very clear that our great task of constructing a high level of
 socialist spiritual civilization should take communist ideology as its
 central theme and the tactical significance of this in achieving socialist
 modernized construction.  China's artists and writers, and those in the
 party, in particular carry a great responsibility toward the construction
 of a socialist spiritual civilization.  My metier is music and I feel that
 all those involved in music and composition should study hard the writings
 of the party and the government and consider in detail how best we can
 carry out our duties within the..spheres of our work, thereby fulfilling
 our work responsibilities.
 On the musical front, we are faced with some extremely hard tasks.  We must
 continue our work to eradicate the negative results of the 10 years of
 social chaos and disorder and take care to prevent and overcome any
 ideological disarray in literature and musical bastardization which might
 arise from China's open door policy.  We must correctly implement the
 literary policies of the party and overcome sways to the "left" and right
 which have appeared during many years of party policy implementation.  Of
 even greater help is to initiate and activate among musicians enthusiasm
 for socialist construction and for the masses and strive to satisfy the
 multitude of musical demands of the masses, thereby continuously raising
 the level of musical enjoyment of the entire population.  The completion
 of these few tasks all require our deepest study of and work on the con-
 tents of the 12th national congress report so that we may raise our con-
 sciousness and strive for the preservation of ideological and political
 harmony with the party.
 The construction of material civilization requires planning, capital and
 the expenditure of energy.  The construction of socialist spiritual
 civilization also requires us to carry out effective but arduous work;
 otherwise, the appeal will be in word only and not in deed.  Here I have
 three points I would like to make:
 1.,  We must strive to correct certain mistaken attitudes in the party,
 attitudes which have existed for a long period of time and over a wide
 spectrum and which lead to little attention being given to education in
 the sciences and arts and discrimination against intellectuals.  Here the
 party Central Committee has done great work and has achieved significant
 results.   But, to eliminate the influence of mistaken "leftist" ideology
 in this area, we must all unite in understanding and carrying out our work.
 Some people still feel that it is possible to create a spiritual civiliza-
 tion without culture and even go so far as to publicly propagate and spread
 such mistaken thinking.  In the spirit of the 12th national congress, we
 must strengthen cultural development, implement the policies on intellec-
 tuals and recognize how this is closely related to the success or failure

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 of constructing a socialist spiritual civilization and thereby ensure that
 every policy and principle related to this cause is fully and effectively
 implemented.
 2.  The arts, including music, are an extremely important and significant
 part of spiritual civilization, which has its own idiosyncrasies.  Hence,
 we should implement the policy of "letting one hundred flowers bloom, let
 one hundred schools of thought contend."  In relation to this question,
 we already have ample experiences, both positive and negative and we
 should not again make the mistake of "leftist" and rightist swinging.  The
 kind of arts we are advocating are socialist arts with communist ideology
 as the nucleus.  We must trust in our art in order to be able to resist,
 with strength, the corrosion of the poisonous facets.of bourgeois arts.
 We should, of course, remain alert to the erroneous belief of "freedom"
 of the bourgeois classes.  But we should not prevent the active implementa-
 tion of the "hundred flowers" policy for the sake of such relatively small
 risks.
 3.  We should increase by a relatively large amount of the proportion of
 funds allocated by the state for scientific and cultural education so that
 the construction of a socialist spiritual civilization may obtain the
 material support it requires.  The serious problems of wastage within
 economic construction illustrate that such moves are by no means out of
 the question.  We must, without a doubt, quickly increase the attention
 paid to "intellectual investments."
 The party Central Committee has now officially announced two construction
 programs for civilization, and now we must tackle the building of spiritual
 civilization with the same vigor and determination as in tackling the
 building of material civilization.  A high level of socialist spiritual
 civilization will automatically motivate further development in.material
 civilization.  If we can come to understand this dialectical methodology
 and strive to bring together the construction work for both these kinds of
 civilization, then we will be able to establish a new all-round phase for
 socialist modernized construction.  Come, let us musicians join together
 with the masses throughout China, inspired by the spirit of the 12th
 national congress, and courageously march forward!
 Liu Shaotang [0491 4801 2768]:  "Build Socialist Literature With Communist
 Thinking as Its Core"
 In his report to the 12th CPC National Congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed
 out that "our educational work in the areas of science and culture is just
 getting onto the right track and is now developing considerably and now
 presents an admirable scene."   This estimation is entirely in keeping with
 the present scene of Chinese literature and art.
 In the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, many leftist
 errors in the area of the art and literature dating back several years were
 put right.  The party Central Committee considers literature and art as
 extremely important and thus carried out many close discussions with

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 writers and artists from the art world, proposing many excellent suggestions
 related to art and literature and thereby motivating the creative enthusiasm
 of young and old writers alike.  At the time when the artistic and literary
 world produced such bourgeois mistakes as "freedom" of expression which
 totally went against the four basic principles of communism, the party
 Central Committee immediately called an ideological work symposium and
 after exhaustive guidance, finally came up with an accurate criticism by
 searching the facts for the truth of the matter.  It was only because of
 the party's strict adherence to the struggle on two fronts that socialist
 art and literature were able to continue on the right track and show
 excellent initial progress.
 In reviewing the last few years of development in socialist arts, we can
 come to realize with even greater clarity the necessity for writers and
 artists to preserve ideological and political unity with the party.  Social-
 ist arts are an important part of socialist spiritual civilization.                    Thus,
 our writers and artists should be the conscious builders of socialist
 spiritual civilization.
 Cultural construction must be completely carried out under the guiding
 principles of the 12th national congress and must develop under the
 ideological guidance of communism.  Our writers and artists must play
 activating roles in the construction of material civilization and thus
 raise the ideological consciousness and level of morality in the masses,
 gradually developing more and more members of the socialist society into
 morally and culturally aware workers with strict discipline who may con-
 tribute greatly to society.  Writers should use their works as a fresh and
 encouraging new phase for the establishment of socialist modernized con-
 struction and not allow negatively directed works to depress the reader and
 poison the atmosphere.  Of course, literature should still make use of the
 bad and evil things in life, but the purpose of using such things should
 be to castigate them so that readers may gain some enlightenment from
 reading such things and be encouraged to actively strive for improvement.
 Writers who are members of the Communist Party should take the leading
 role here.  And this thus necessarily demands of us that we first improve
 our knowledge and understanding, strengthen our party allegiance and
 strictly follow the direction and policies laid down by the 12th national
 congress and thereby become a leading part of the creation of a new phase
 in socialist literature and art.
 China's. modernized construction must be planned and carried out on the
 basis of China's actual and objective situation.  Thus, our literary
 creators must also work in the realities of China's present situation.
 China's revolutionary literature has produced vast and valuable historical
 experiences and has thus established our own theoretical system.  We must
 cherish the achievements we have gained after so many years of struggle and
 then pass on and develop our revolutionary tradition.  We must remember the
 importance of studying and borrowing from overseas literature and related
 experiences but we must not duplicate word for word the style and format
 of foreign literature.  We must remain alert and continue to resist the
 corrosive influence of degenerate and decadent foreign literature.

 Socialist literature and art must adopt plentiful and lively means to
 express and propagate socialist spiritual civilization with communism as
 its nucleus, and yet should not be too sermon-like or obviously graphic.
 Writers and artists should involve themselves in the very heart of everyday
 life, mixing with the masses and jumping out of the restrictive circle of
 self-expression.  This is the fundamental path to raising the ideological
 consciousness and artistic level of the writer and artist so that they may
 establish .a new phase in socialist literature and art.
 Chen Guangzhong [7115 0342 1813]:  "Films Should Aim at Fostering the Good-
 heartedness of the People"
 Youths are the driving force behind the establishment of a new period in
 time, and the cinema is a key to opening the window of their hearts.
 Recently, there have been investigations into the situation of youths and
 their ideological attitudes in the factories, with questionnaires for
 young people being handed out.  In response to the question "What do you
 like doing most of all?" 98 percent of the young people responded by saying
 that they liked films most of all.  It is clear that the cinema is one of
 the forms of art which can relate most intimately with the masses, and in
 the case of young people it is an extremely attractive concept.  The
 cinema exerts a very subtle influence on youths, in terms of ideological
 enlightenment and the edification and fostering of morals and aspirations.
 China's cinema must propagate communism but it should not adopt methods of
 vacant preaching.  Instead, it should make use of varied and rich forms of
 art, with a lively and active style, to educate the youth of today.  And
 indeed, we have a saying:  "Facts speak louder than words."  Thus, the
 characteristic of newsreel films is the portrayal of upright real people
 and real events which allow the young people to actually see the qualities
 of communism in our everyday lives.  The use of moving events and stories
 tells the viewer that communism is not a hollow promise but that it actually
 exists all around us today, that those people twinkling with the shining
 light of communist thinking are not gods but that they exist and live among
 us and are the models for us to emulate.
 Our teaching should make the young people of today try to overcome their
 own shortcomings with enthusiasm, patience, discipline and sobriety.  We
 must make sure that we light _the fires of their ideology so that we may
 bring together the disordered and decentralized faculae of youth to
 create those powerful beams of light which work toward the development of.
 China, creating enormous energy.  Thus, in our penetration into everyday
 life we must broaden, enrich and multiply the themes we use, we must
 analyze people's hearts with greater thoroughness and, in particular, we
 must eulogize those new people and new ideologies which are establishing
 a new phase in time.  With the party line, we must accurately reflect the
 contradictions which appear in this new era.  The establishment and
 development of this new era will not come about through smiles, fresh
 flowers and merry expression, but requires arduous work and tortuous
 struggle.  In life there is both beauty and ugliness,`both light and dark-
 ness.  As we show new men of communism through the exposure of contradic-
 tions, the youth who are watching will feel doubly close to them and will
 attain a sense of respect and a need to study and emulate.

 Our studios recently finished a documentary called "The Glorious Call,"
 which involves an evaluation of the facts of everyday life so that youth
 viewers would be able to discern that which is truly glorious and beauti-
 ful and where it may be sought.  Young people love and respect beauty.
 Thus,'this film uses the spirit of communism to move toward beauty, to
 seek~out beauty and to create beauty!   I, a humble pawn in the field of
 cinematic news reporting, offer with sincerity and ardor, this tribute of
 spiritual nourishment of everyone, in particular our younger friends.
 Yu Shuzhen [0060 3219 3791]:  "Actors Should Pay Attention to the Social
 Effects of Their Performances"
 The party, in defining the construction of a socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion as the battle line in the 12th national congress, has meant that every
 party member, every revolutionary must come to understand his or her own
 duties and responsibilities in creating this socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion.  I am both a Communist Party member and an actor and I am determined
 to work from the very bottom of my heart.
 Actors serve the people through their own performing skills.  A song or a
 dance should never be belittled, for merely by jumping onto a stage and
 performing it one can influence the entire audience.  Thus, every actor and
 actress should think about the social effects of his or her acting.
 Just after liberation and the founding of the PRC, the party mood and the
 feeling of society was extremely good.  The 10 years of social disorder
 brought chaos to people's ways of thinking and also caused tremendous
 damage to the party mood and the general atmosphere in society, while the
 damage done to the spirit of the young people which had been built up
 until then, was extensive.  Since the implementation of our open door
 foreign policy, some of our young people have fallen under the influence
 of unhealthy foreign music.   Since the third plenary session and, more
 importantly, since the symposium concerning problems of ideological front
 lines, we,have been fighting against the "freedom movement" of the bourgeois
 classes and resisting the corrosive effect of bourgeois thinking, with the
 result that the situation has improved somewhat.  However, there are still
 a number'of young people who are still very keen on this decadent music.
 I feel that we must actively educate and guide these young people and that
 there should be no compromise.  In particular, there should be no pandering
 to bad-taste merely for the sake of "box office value."  In August of this
 year, our troupe visited a certain town for performances.   Before our
 visit, there had been many performances of programs with very little
 artistic value.  Consequently, we decided to perform pieces with healthy
 content and not in keeping with the tastes of a small minority.  Thus, they
 did not enjoy the performance and began to make trouble.  However, we had
 the support of the vast majority of the audience and thus the healthy
 trends prevailed over the evil ones.  Later, we traveled to Shenzhen for a
 performance.  Before we gave our performance, some people suggested that we
 sing and perform some popular songs from Hong Kong and Macao.  This we did
 not do.   Instead, we continued to perform our orthodox songs. There were
 no catcalls and no derisory laughter, and the effect was very good.

 Afterward, many young people in the audience said that they had not realized
 that China had such good music as that!  This clearly illustrates how the
 audience was able to distinguish between the beautiful and the ugly.
 Young people represent the morning sun; they have high spirits and are able
 to accept new things very quickly.  However, their world views have not yet
 solidified and become firm and thus they find it easy to imbibe advanced
 and progressive things as well as corrupt and backward things.  As a per-
 forming artist who is also a party member, I want very much to make use of
 healthy, progressive and pure. things to mold their moral character, nurture
 a healthy interest and steer them actively onward and upward in order to
 create a socialist spiritual civilization.
 Actors and performers should not only take care of the social effects they
 are producing while on stage, they should also remember the social influ-
 ence created by their own behavior in general.  The party Central Committee
 announced that art should serve the people and socialism.  Thus, we should
 think about the needs of the people and socialism.  I am a singer of folk
 songs an d on average, I receive about 10 letters a day, of which about 6 or
 7 come from the countryside.  These letters are of great help to me and they
 immediately make me think of those who have written them and the country-
 side where they live.  Under the influence of "looking toward money" and
 its.ideology, some people have disregarded the social influence and in
 seeking fame and fortune, have begun singing decadent songs.  In doing so,
 they have transgressed the ideal that the arts should serve the people and
 socialism.
 In his report to the 12th national congress, Comrade Hu Yaobang said:  In
 the next 5 years, we want to see a fundamental turn for the better in the
 party and society's mood and atmosphere.  In order to achieve this, every-
 one must work together with mutual cooperation and our performing artists
 must constantly remember their task and must begin from within themselves.
 Jiang Kun [1203 2492]:  "Bring Healthy Literature and Art to the People"
 In the wake of the important tasks outlined at the 12th CPC National Con-
 gress for the construction of a socialist spiritual civilization and as a
 young writer, I feel that the burden on me is by no means light!
 Comic dialogue is a style of'literature enjoyed by both men and women and
 young and old, suitable for both refined and popular tastes.  One take lasts
 less than an hour and, by means of TV and radio, it is instantly trans-
 ported into every household and every corner of the country.                     Because comic
 dialogue has these traits and advantages, our task and responsibilities are
 even greater.  What should we bring the people?  How can we help people
 relax after work and have the benefit of extremely interesting and arresting
 enjoyment?  These are important questions for us comic dialogue writers and
 performers.
 Comic dialogue is, by nature, very popular and widespread.  Thus, we should
 try to improve the ideological and artistic value of the performances and,

 not simply perform comic gags in order to cater to the needs of a small
 minority with poor taste, nor simply to try to get.cheap laughs.  In recent
 years, audiences and critics have criticized some negative trends in our
 productions of comic dialogue and we should be aware of this.
 The establishment of a socialist spiritual civilization demands that more
 and more literary and performing pieces be of a high level in terms of
 style and quality, and this spurs us on to search ceaselessly and more
 deeply for new creative material and themes.  Here, one of the most recent
 examples was a great inspiration for us.  During the 12th national congress,
 I and a Comrade Li Wenhua were making changes and improvements to a piece
 called "Time and Spring" written by an amateur writer.  The effects of the
 performance exceeded our expectations.  Why was this piece, which lacked
 comedy, received so well?  The reason was because the piece explained that
 young people should cherish time and should not waste their youth or spring.
 Today, young people generally feel that there is never enough time to do
 everything, while older people also wish that youngsters would appreciate
 time more.  Thus, this piece expressed all these feelings.  After the per-
 formance of this piece, I asked myself what is it that we should propagate
 most at the moment, and what is it that we should write about most at the
 moment.  I feel that the most fundamental thing is to make full use of the
 characteristics of comic dialogue to reflect the pulse of our times, to
 propagate communist ideology.  The 12th national congress pointed out that
 the masses and the cadres must unite their strength and struggle for the
 glorious goals we must achieve before the end of this century.  But some
 people still display a certain "vagueness and uncertainty about communism."
 Hence, we must rightly spread the word of communism so that people may come
 to. truly understand it.
 In order to propagate the most advanced ideology in the world, our per-
 formers of comic dialogue must be extremely strict with themselves.  First,
 they must arm themselves with communist ideology and, at the same time,
 must constantly try to improve themselves artistically.  Thus, they should
 ensure that they articulate with purity and do not allow filth and dirt to
 drift into their speeches, thereby creating linguistic pollution.  They
 should avoid sarcasm and vulgar forms of presentation.  Thus, in general
 they should give rein to the educational role of comic dialogue with a
 high degree of ideological and artistic authenticity, so that through
 their laughter the audience is molded to possess a high degree'of moral
 values so that they may seek truth and beauty and despise and abhor ugli-
 ness and evil.  Of course, this is easier said than done.  But with study,
 refinement and endeavor we can undoubtedly raise the standards of comic
 dialogue.
 Chen Haosu [7115 8504 5685):  "The Glorious Mission of the CYL"
 The CYL has a glorious mission in the establishment of a socialist spiritual
 civilization.
 Communist ideology forms the nucleus of socialist spiritual civilization.

 communism.  In historical terms, several generations of true communist
 fighters have always grown out of the ranks of the CYL, and among them are
 some of the glorious pioneers of China's communist movement.  Some are the
 old generation of revolutionaries who, in the intervening years, have
 jumped to position of leadership of the country within the party and, of
 course, even more of them are frontline cadres and activists who fought
 in all the revolutionary struggles and socialist upsurges.  Today, the CYL
 shows the way for China's youth to throw itself completely into the prac-
 tical program for the four modernizations, to study Marxism-Leninism-Mao
 Zedong Thought as well as modern sciences and culture so that they may
 become a new generation of people full of ideals; morals, culture and
 discipline who may exert greater and greater influence in helping the party
 foster and nurture a new generation of communist fighters.
 The CYL must play a penetrating and forceful role in the establishment of
 a socialist spiritual civilization, and this role should include both the
 construction of culture and ideology.  The CYL should earnestly support
 and promote the development of all cultural causes, such as education, the
 sciences, art and literature and sports, and should activate young people
 to delve into the realms of knowledge, encouraging them to study culture,
 science and technology.  The CYL must organize and help young people to
 study on their own and achieve results.  We should take note of the guiding
 words of Lenin, who said that one can only become a communist by using the
 entire treasure house of knowledge created by man to enrich one's own head.
 The CYL is a well-developed youth organization carrying the flag of cour
 munism.  For this reason, the CYL must preserve its communist purity.  We
 must recognize that in some young people the poison of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion's anarchy and out-and-out egoism has still not been flushed out and,
 in addition to this, some still suffer under the influence of foreign
 bourgeois thinking.  In order to improve young people's strength to resist
 such things and to help them develop a communist world view, we must build
 a line of defense into their ideology.  Thus, we must teach every CYL
 member to make demands on him or herself for the sake of the principles of
 communism and to absorb more and more young people within his or her sphere
 of action, getting them to join the communist ranks.  In order to set up a
 communist world view and ways of thinking, we must ensure that young people
 study,Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.  These are the basic tasks of the
 CYL.  This work should be integrated with the great efforts of the party,
 which is at the moment implementing policies to bring order out of chaos
 and to establish a great new era.  Advances in the ideology of young people
 in recent years have been the results of the practical study of communism.
 The CYL should take a leading role in urging young people to developing
 such policies as "the five stresses and four beauties," "setting up a new
 mood" and "serving you," and in doing so, struggling toward a turn for the
 better in the social mood.  Such activities are, in fact, an active and
 lively way of educating young people in ideology, morals and discipline
 and help to endlessly raise the level of their moral standards and elevate
 their revolutionary spirit with great vitality.

 Today's youth are the future of the country.  The CYL is the party's helper
 and reserve force.  The glorious blueprints drawn up at the 12th national
 congress will become wonderful realities in the hands of this generation of
 youths and one of the conditions which will decide whether the young people
 can carry such a great burden is whether the CYL is able to unite the young
 people to become a vast and mighty army of successors to communism.  The
 cadres of the CYL believe that we will not let the party or the people down
 in their expectations and hopes for us and that we will arduously work to
 organize and construct a "school for studying communism through actual
 practice" which is worthy of its name so that we may develop a frontline
 force for the establishment of. a socialist spiritual civilization and
 achieve our glorious mission with even greater success.
 Zhang Liqun [1728 2745 5028]:  "In Fostering New Socialists, It Is Impera-
 tive That We Continue With Communist Education"
 The establishment of a socialist spiritual civilization involves many
 things, and communist ideology is the very nucleus of it.  The construc-
 tion of a socialist spiritual education must be guided by communist
 ideology.
 From the 60-odd years of practical party experience, we can see that when-
 ever communist education is grasped, our work teams spring to life, the
 mood of the party flourishes and our causes develop and move forward.
 Whenever we slacken our grip on communist education, our causes
 stop their forward movement and even suffer setbacks.  Whenever we think
 of the spirit of Yanan or the spirit of Nanniwan, it is heartening indeed,
 and these have become the symbol of the indomitable revolutionary spirit
 of the old generation of revolutionaries, embodying the arduous struggle
 and glorious tradition in the party's and the people's communist movement.
 During the 10 years of social chaos, the wonderful tradition and revolu-
 tionary spirit of the party suffered terrible damage and the crazy fashions
 of "smashing, beating and looting" and the "spirit of rebellion" and their
 disastrous results have made us all very consciously aware of the fact that
 the construction of a socialist spiritual civilization ties in closely with
 the future of our party and our country as well as our general destiny.
 In order to correctly carry out the construction of a socialist spiritual
 civilization, we must first improve the party mood.  The exemplary role of
 the party is extremely important.   Similarly, we must tackle well the ques-
 tion of educating young people in the principles of communism.  There are
 390 million young people in China, making up two-fifths [as published] of
 the total population.  Young people represent the country's aspirations
 and future, and the realms of.their ideology and the quality of their
 culture decide the future of our country.   We must use Marxism-Leninism-
 Mao Zedong Thought as well as the spirit of communism to educate and arm
 the young people of China so that they will resolutely carry high the
 banner of communism and give themselves totally to the communist cause.
 Lenin said:  "We are the party of the future, and the future belongs to the
 youth of today.  We are the innovative party, and young people always want
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 to be ahead of others in terms of innovation.  We are the party continuing
 the selfless struggle against the corrosive elements of the past, and it is
 young people who always want to throw themselves, first of all, into a
 selfless struggle."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 11, p 338)  The young
 people of China possess a glorious revolutionary tradition and the young
 masses want to join the party in taking the broad road to communism.
 Nevertheless, we must remember that young people, having had their educa-
 tional foundations smashed during the Cultural Revolution, can tend to veer
 in the wrong direction since their. world views have not had a chance to
 fully develop and be consolidated.  We must start by examining the realistic
 situation of young people in China, study their characteristics and seek the
 truth about them and develop the teaching of communist ideology so that they
 may throw themselves completely into the middle of the practical side of the
 communist movement.
 The party has vast experience in teaching communist ideology to young people
 and such experience should be passed on and implemented.  However, after
 the 10 years of social chaos, there were some changes in the objective state
 of young people in China and,they took on some new characteristics.  In the
 country's new era of opening up a new phase for the construction of social-
 ist modernization, new situations and new problems are bound to arise.  For
 example, the recently implemented open door policy has meant that while we
 import advanced science and technology and administrative and management
 experience from capitalist countries, some very poisonous and corrosive
 things from capitalism have also seeped in, and some young people who lack
 the. ability to differentiate and resist cannot help but be influenced to
 various extents.  Hence, we must, with lucid estimations, probe and promote
 healthy and mature rules and regulations for young people, making use of a
 wide variety of lively methods to guide them into accepting Marxism and
 becoming full-fledged communists.
 When we carry out communist ideological education for our young people,
 we cannot simply rely on schools and the CYL.  We must enlist the strength
 of the whole society and so organize a mighty and powerful army to con-
 struct a socialist spiritual civilization.  Everyone, from all levels of the
 party and the government as well as every member of society and the front
 line, must bear the responsibility of educating the youth of China with
 communism.  In this work, we must be aware of the characteristics of youth
 and we must guard against simplistic, crude and formalistic methods.

 TAKE THE ROAD OF COORDINATED DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRY AND
 COMMERCE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 pp 37-40
 [Article by Yang Yichen [2799.2496 659111
 [Text] For many years, Heilongjiang Province has one-sidedly sought the
 development of heavy industry and neglected the development of agriculture
 and light industry.  This has resulted in a serious imbalance in the pro-
 portionate relationship between agriculture, light industry and heavy
 industry and a prolonged state of backwardness in the production of con-
 sumer goods for daily use and in diversified operations in the rural areas.
 As early as 1962, Comrade Zhou Enlai took us to task for not having our own
 local industry and scolded us for not making full use of our advantages and
 for "begging for rice with a golden rice bowl."  He was indeed speaking the
 truth, hitting the nail on the head.  In the past, on various occasions
 we did try to lengthen these two "short legs" of light industry and diver-
 sified agricultural operations.  However, because of the influence of
 "leftist" thinking and our imperfect understanding of the superior points
 of our province, we failed to grasp the opportunity.  Since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we have seriously implemented
 the Central Committee's eight-character policy of readjustment, restructur-
 ing, reorganization and upgrading.  We have attained a deeper understanding
 of the abundant resources and superior economic points of our province.
 Guided by the thought of treating the whole nation as a chessboard and
 commencing with bringing our superior points into full play, we began to
 pay attention to the development of the light and textile industries and
 diversified operations in the rural villages.  This has brought about a
 relatively big change in the' economic structure and we have begun to tread
 the new road of coordinated development of agriculture, industry and com-
 merce.  In our actual experience, we have come to realize that from the
 point of view of a province, if we want to implement the policy of readjust-
 ing the national economy properly, we must earnestly sum up the experiences
 and lessons of history and properly solve the following five issues in our
 guiding thought:

 1.  Gradually Establishing an Economic Structure Suitable to the Full
 Exploitation of the Superior Points of Our Province
 In readjusting the proportionate relationships and establishing a rational
 economic structure, we cannot depend on subjective wishes but must consider
 how to,make full and rational use of our region's superiority in resources
 and economic technology, and the objective needs for the planned and pro-
 portionate development of the national economy.  What is the criterion of
 whether an economic structure is rational or not?  This principally depends
 on whether or not the economic development can satisfy social needs and
 ensure the coordinated development of all the sectors of the national
 economy; on whether or not we have paid attention first to the actual con-
 ditions of our province and fully utilized its manpower, materials, finan-
 cial power and natural resources and on whether or not we can vigorously
 promote scientific and technological progress and raise the labor produc-
 tivity rate, so as to enable production to increase at a faster rate and
 achieve better results.  In the past, we lacked a sufficient understanding
 of this point.  Despite our many years' work in Heilongjiang, we have not
 .yet acquired a real and comprehensive understanding of the province.  We
 frequently paid special attention to its resources of coal, timber and
 crude oil for the development of heavy industry (which is correct) but
 scarce attention was given to the development of the abundant resources
 of the light and textile industries and the food industry.  Moreover, over
 a long period of time we have been satisfied with our province serving as
 a raw materials base but seldom engaging in processing work of the primary
 grade, far less in more intensive types of processing.  We even went so far
 as to forsake our superior points in preference to our weak ones and devoted
 much strength to the development of small iron and steel industries despite
 the lack of iron ore resources in our province.  As a result, we paid a
 heavy price but achieved poor results.
 Finally, through summing up the experiences and lessons gained, we began a
 provincewide large-scale economic investigation and acquired a more inten-
 sive knowledge of the superior points of our province.  The guiding thought
 of economic readjustment became clear in our minds and we no longer
 indulged in such foolishness as giving up our strong points and using our
 weaknesses.  We decided to bring into full play the superior points of 12
 categories of resources, these being grain, beans, sugar, milk, potatoes,
 hemp, fur, silk, chemicals, leather, timber, and reeds. We placed great
 stress on the development of the light and textile industries and gave them
 first priority in the provision of funds, energy, materials and technology.
 At the same time, we decided that with regard to heavy industry, the struc-
 ture of its products should be readjusted, the direction of its service
 reoriented, and the relative weight of its service to light industry and to
 agriculture continuously expanded.  On the side of agriculture, we decided
 that on top of grasping well grain production, we would actively develop
 economic crops and diversified operations and promote the overall develop-
 ment of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and
 fishery.  In the course of readjustment, we strove vigorously to make full
 use of our strong points, avoided our weak points and brought into full play
 all the superior points of our province being rich in resources and possessing

 a relatively firm industrial foundation, a fairly strong technology, a
 flourishing communications system, and extensive markets.  Our objectives
 were to build our province into the following sorts of base area:  a
 modernized agricultural base concentrating on production of commodity
 grain, and including the overall development of economic crops and diversi-
 fied operations; a light industry base having the food and textile indus-
 tries as its focal points of development; and a forestry base featuring
 afforestation and placing the focal point on the comprehensive utilization
 of timber.  In addition, we plan to develop our province into a base for
 energy with emphasis on the output of coal and crude oil, and into a heavy
 industrial base with emphasis on the machine-building industry and the
 building materials industry.  We thus proposed to build up a new-style
 economic structure featuring the coordinated development of agriculture,
 light industry and heavy industry.
 Under the guidance 'of the above thinking, and following 3 years of concen-
 trated effort, we have achieved relatively good results in the readjustment
 of the economic structure.  The following are the results, comparing the 3
 years previous to, with the 3 years after, the 3d Plenary Session of the
 11th CPC Central Committee:  The average annual grain output increased from
 24.9 billion jin to 27.8 billion jin, and in the latter 3 years, the gross
 output value of agriculture increased yearly at an average of around 9 per-
 cent.  In the gross output value of agriculture, the relative weight of
 economic crops grew from 9 percent to 15.4 percent, while that of diversi-
 fied operations increased from 20.2 percent to 24.4 percent.  As for indus-
 trial production, a number of small iron and steel plants and chemical
 fertilizer plants were closed and the internal structure of industry was
 readjusted.  Light industry has enjoyed a rapid development every year:
 an increase of 16.3 percent in 1980 over 1979; and an increase of 13.6 per-
 cent in 1981 over 1980.  A relatively big change was effected in the pro-
 portionate relationship between light industry and heavy industry.  The
 proportion occupied by light industry in the gross output value of
 industry rose from 26.3 percent in 1978 to 36.8 percent last year. The
 entire economy has attained new vitality, laying strong foundations for
 further readjustment.
 2.  Implementing Comprehensive Readjustment of Agriculture, Industry and
 Commerce and Stressing the Production of Consumer Goods
 Our readjustment work aims at solving the problem of the imbalance in pro-
 portionate relationship in accordance with the Marxist reproduction theory-,
 and the 'regulations governing the planned and. proportionate development of
 the national economy, to enable the various departments of the national
 economy to promote each other and not to become mutually disjointed.  Hence,
 we feel that to do a good job of readjustment, first of all we must think
 along the lines of effecting a comprehensive readjustment.   In other words,
 we should not confine ourselves to readjusting the individual enterprises
 themselves or to readjusting agriculture and industry separately.  Rather,
 we should carry out, on a provincewide basis and according to step by step
 plans,*a comprehensive readjustment of agriculture, industry and commerce.

 When the eight-character policy was first adopted, in order to strengthen
 light industry, we grasped the problem of the raw materials for agricul-
 tural and sideline products as a focal point of work.  After more than a
 year, the main contradiction was changed and the problem became one con-
 cernirig a serious lack of processing capacity in the light, textile and
 food industries.  This made us realize that if we isolatedly readjusted
 a certain area or link in the production process, the chances would be
 that we might attend to one thing and lose sight of another and that once
 we solved an old imbalance, a new imbalance might appear.  In this way, it
 would be difficult to ensure coordinated economic development.  In order
 to solve this problem, we grasped the central link in the production of
 consumer goods and decided on the focal development of some 10 trades and
 products including sugar refining, textiles, food products and the compre-
 hensive use of timber.  At the same time, we combined together the work
 of readjusting the industries and reforming the economic structure.  In
 order to break through the departmental boundary limits and facilitate the
 development of focal-point products, we have set up over 10 small specialized
 leadership groups of which 9 are concerned with the production of consumer
 goods.  The various groups are under the charge of committee secretaries,
 standing committee members and provincial vice governors, with each heading
 one or two of these small groups.  They worked hard on each industry and
 product and tightly grasped the different stages ranging from processing
 of. the raw materials to passing through the circulation channels.  They did
 their work thoroughly and achieved fairly good results.  For example, sugar
 production increased from 145,000 tons in 1978 to 344,000 tons in 1981;
 confectionery production from 15,000 tons to 27,000 tons; output of milk
 products from 10,400 tons to 18,000 tons; and the number of spindles in
 the textile industry increased from 340,000 in 1978 to about 500,000 in
 1981.  The comprehensive utilization rate of timber's "3 leftovers" (namely,
 leftovers from tree felling, processing and product-making) reached 27.7
 percent, the output capacity of artificial fiber boards using the "3 left-
 overs1t as raw materials'amounted to 360,000 cubic meters, and the gross
 value of its output was over 500 million yuan.  Meantime, in order to
 develop the light and textile industries, it was necessary to expand their
 production capacity and to undertake the needed technical rebuilding.  This
 gave new tasks to such heavy industry departments as the machine-building
 industry and others and made them reorient their direction of services and
 readjust the. structure of their products.  The healthy development of heavy
 industry was thus promoted.   In this way, if the 10 or more specialized
 small groups, which take consumer goods as their focal point, continue to
 tightly grasp their work in accordance with plan, then it may be estimated
 that by 1985, the economic structure of Heilongjiang Province will have
 become rational and a new appearance will emerge in the situation.
 Following the development of the light and textile industries, the demand
 for raw materials has sharply increased.  This, in turn, promoted readjust-
 ment of the agricultural structure and development of economic crops and
 diversified operations.  We plan that under the conditions of a steady
 increase in grain output, we shall basically change the agricultural struc-
 ture from its unitary, subsistence type and gradually attain the objective
 of making the output value of grain, economic crops and diversified operation

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 constitute one-third each of the gross output value of agriculture.  Thus,
 we shall put Heilongjiang on the road to modernized large-scale production
 which calls for little investment but achieves handsome results and a high
 commodity production rate.  At the same time, we shall bring into full play
 the role of agricultural mechanization and in this way liberate a large
 agricultural labor force for the further development of enterprises in the
 communes and production brigades as well as the processing industry for
 agricultural and sideline. products.  We shall thus endeavor to achieve the
 coordination between industry and agriculture and between the urban and
 rural areas.  This is a road which we must traverse in order to make the
 rural villages truly prosperous.  Indeed, it appears impossible that the
 rural villages will become truly prosperous if we confine ourselves only to
 grain production without developing economic crops and diversified opera-
 tion.  It will also be impossible if we endeavor to develop only agricul-
 ture without developing the processing industry.
 Development of agricultural production will bring in its wake higher
 demands on the commodity circulation channels.  This is to say, the circu-
 lation channels must be widened, the number of turnover points or stoppages
 must be reduced, the'work style in business must be improved, and commodity
 circulation must be facilitated.   In this way, we shall gradually form a
 "one dragon" system whereby purchasing, processing and marketing are linked
 together.  This "dragon" will find its way not only into the whole province
 and whole country but also into the world market.  Persistently grasping
 our work in this way will transform the economy of our country into a chain
 of interlocking stratagems of coordinated development of agriculture,
 industry and commerce whereby industry will promote agriculture, agriculture
 will lead industry, light industry will promote heavy industry, heavy
 industry will lead light industry, production will promote circulation and
 circulation will lead production.  The whole economy will thus embark on the
 road to healthy development.
 This "chain of interlocking stratagems" of coordination of agriculture,
 industry and commerce will also promote changes in the ownership system
 and the labor employment structure.  Over the past few years, based on the
 great development of socialist collective economy, in the cities, munici-
 palities and market towns in our province, the individual handicraft
 industry and repair trades have achieved a certain degree of development.
 The number of establishments engaged in collective and individual commerce,
 restaurant trade and repair trades increased from 33,000 units in 1979 to
 107,000 units last year, an increase of 220 percent.  This speed of develop-
 ment has not been seen in the past 30 years.  These commercial units and
 service trades provided employment to some 800,000 people of whom 340,000
 were young people awaiting employment.   If we press forward along this road
 of the "chain.of interlocking stratagems," the ultimate trend of development
 will be unification of agriculture, industry and commerce embracing the
 coordinated development of the urban and rural areas, of industry and
 agriculture and of the counties, communes and production brigades.  To
 conform to the development of this situation, we still need to strive hard
 to do a good job of the construction of small cities and towns.

 3.  Making Use of the Superiority of the Machine-Building Industry To Mend
 the Insufficient Processing Capacity of Agricultural and Sideline Products
 Following the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the
 rural policy adopted has been welcomed by the populace.  Development of
 economic crops and diversified operation has been rapid.  A large quantity.
 of raw materials has been provided for the light industry.  Some of the
 light industrial plants which used to struggle for raw materials now have
 an ample supply and have to dispose'of, or sell, their raw materials in
 stock.  In fact, in some cases, stockpiling of large quantities of raw
 materials has actually occurred.  Because of the overabundance of sugar
 beet, the existing sugar refineries had to extend their sugar-pressing
 period and overloaded their machinery with work.  The output volume of hemp
 was excessive, and the only thing to be done was to export it.  Due to the
 weak processing capacity of milk products and their irrational geographical
 distribution, there was much wastage of fresh milk once the busy purchasing
 season was over.  Large quantities of edible oils have to be stockpiled
 owing to the shortage of processing facilities.   A situation of this kind
 on the-agricultural front indicates that there is an urgent need to raise
 the processing capacity for agricultural and sideline products.
 How shall we solve the problem of insufficient processing capacity for the
 light and textile industries and the food industry?  We have depended mainly
 on utilization of the existing strength of the machine-building industry and
 on bringing the superiority of the machine-building industry into full play.
 In our planning, we closely linked the development of the light and textile
 industries with the readjustment of the machine-building industry and, in a
 planned manner and systematically, organized the machine-building industry
 to serve the development of light industry in our province and to produce
 whole-set equipment for the processing of agricultural and sideline products.
 Within the machine-building industry, a rational system of division of work
 has been effected, production of specific products and the direction of
 service have both been fixed.  Thus,.some products were intended for the
 comprehensive utilization of timber, some to serve the light and textile
 industries in tapping their potentials, in restructuring and in rebuilding,
 while some were to serve the sugar refining and food industries.  At the
 same time, full utilization was made of the foundation of existing light
 industry enterprises to continuously develop processing work to a more
 intensive degree and, through the comprehensive utilization of industry,
 form a package of interlocking strategies for the processing of raw mate-
 rials, preliminary grade products and final grade products.  As a result,
 the machine-building industry came to life, the processing industry
 developed and development of agriculture was promoted.  In 1981, the value
 of the products of the machine-building industry serving light industry
 increased by 14 percent over 1978 and the downturn in production of the
 machine-building industry became an upturn.

 t
 economic effect.  He clearly pointed out:  "Our country's national economy
 must traverse a new road at a relatively dependable speed, with relatively
 good economic effect and more real benefits to the populace."  It is a
 valuable experience gained after having paid a very high price.  It is the
 starting point of performing further a good job of economic readjustment
 and is particularly applicable to our province.  Our province has plentiful
 natural resources, a fairly good industrial foundation and has made rather
 large contributions to the state in various economic sectors such as coal,
 timber and oil.  However, generally speaking, our economic effect is rather
 poor.  At present, our economic targets are not only lower than the national
 average but also lower than our relatively higher historical level.  In
 order to change this contradiction of high superiority on one side but low
 economic effect on the other, what is most important is to effect a funda-
 mental change in ideology and to avoid making high targets and giving blind
 directions.  Indeed, we must refrain from such foolishness as undertaking
 high sounding projects which ultimately produce no,actual results.   We must
 combine proportion, speed and effect together, grasp speed with an eye to
 the economic effect and make speed abide by effect.  We must pay attention
 to improving the economic effect in the enterprises and, more importantly,
 to improving the overall economic effect in the structure as a whole.
 Over the past few years, what we did was to start with restructuring the
 irrational economic structure and then proceeded from various directions to
 improve the overall effect on the economy as a whole.  1) Aiming at satisfy-
 ing social demand, we strengthened planned production and vigorously
 developed those consumer goods of daily use which belonged to the so-called
 "short-line" and urgently needed category of goods but which possessed the
 necessary conditions for increasing production.  These goods included sewing
 machines, bicycles, wooden clocks, confectionery, beer, cigarettes, and so
 on.  The objective was to make them marketable.  2) Taking the original
 light industry enterprises as the base, the potentials of current enter-
 prises were fully tapped.  In the case of light industry "combination" and
 "joint operation" of the enterprises were carried out, whereas in the case
 of the machine-building industry the governing theme was to place emphasis
 on "both heavy industry and light industry" and on "both products for mili-
 tary use and products for civilian use."  Adhering to the principles of
 economic rationalization and specialized coordination, we organized the
 heavy and light industries to carry out technical rebuilding and development
 of their famous brand products and to enlarge the production quotas of the
 focal products of light industry.   In the establishment of new enterprises,
 priority was given to those projects which involved little capital outlay,
 could reap quick results and could attain large benefits.  We followed the
 theme of combination of big, medium and small projects but refrained from
 undertaking any more the wasteful "small, native and common" projects.  In
 the case of certain modern projects which one single enterprise could not
 handle, joint operation with other enterprises, or with the state or
 collective, was advocated.  We carried out well the job of achieving over-
 all balance and stopped the practices of "blind construction" and duplicate
 construction.  As for enterprises of an irrational structural composition,
 gradual readjustment was made while in the case of those enterprises whose
 products were of a poor quality and not marketable and which involved a

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 high consumption rate of raw materials and energy in production, and which
 achieved low economic results and generally were lacking in competitive
 power, we took firm steps to close, or merge, or shift them to other lines
 of production or trades.  3) Concurrent with the expansion of the processing
 capacity of the light and textile industries, we tightly grasped the tech-
 nical rebuilding of the older enterprises and performed a good job of
 improving the quality of existing products or replacing them with new and
 better products.  The poor and low quality of the benefits derived from our
 industry was attributable not only to the imbalance in proportionate rela-
 tionship but also to the low technical level of the enterprises and the
 poor quality of their products.  Why is it that certain products of light
 industry are stagnant in sales, or are stockpiled in the warehouses, or are
 unable to be sold outside the province or are incapable of entering into the
 world market?  The reason is not that there is no market demand for them
 but mainly that the structure of the products is not rational, their quality
 is poor and they generally lack competitive power.  The aluminum alloy
 bicycles with the brand name "Flying Dragon" which are made in our province
 have received general acclaim and the loudspeakers produced-in Zhaodong
 County have been enjoying flourishing sales throughout the country all
 because of the products being new and relatively good in quality.  We
 deeply feel that concurrent with the readjustment of the proportionate
 relationship between light industry and heavy industry, we should readjust
 the technological structure, coordinate the efforts to increase production
 capacity with the efforts to raise the technological level, heavily
 strengthen the technological strength of industry, actively promote the
 development of new products, speed up the improvement and replacement of
 old products and transform the backward countenance over sized and ugly
 products.  Only in this way can the economic effect be raised.  4) We firmly
 grasped management and control, strengthened the weak links in the circula-
 tion channels, further readjusted the relationship between industrial
 merchants, agricultural merchants and commercial merchants, opened up
 markets and oriented ourselves toward service to the whole country and the
 international markets.  We believe that only in this way can we open up
 financial resources, accelerate capital turnover and achieve better
 economic results.  We have learned from actual practice that increasing
 speed is easy but raising the effect is difficult and that stressing speed
 alone may easily make us forget about effect.  Naturally, stressing effect
 does not mean that speed is not needed, since speed and effect are united.
 5.  Taking a Nationwide View of Bringing Our Province's Superiority Into
 Full Play
 Following the continuous progress in readjusting the national economy, we
 have increasingly felt that from the standpoint of a single province it is
 extremely important to foster the ideology of treating the whole country as
 one chessboard.  This is in fact ordained by the very nature of this big
 unit,ed socialist country of ours.  Furthermore, we have brought forth the
 policy of "minding the whole situation, sharing difficulties, bringing one's
 superiority into full play, and making the utmost contributions."  Polit-
 ically, we maintain solidarity with the party Central Committee.   Eco-
 nomically, we are subservient to the centralized and united directions of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 the State Council.  The country as a whole represents the overall situation
 of which a province is a part.  A part should follow the whole and the
 theme "suiting measures to local conditions" should be altered to "suiting
 measures to national conditions."  In the past, we have made contributions
 to socialist construction.  Now we must still keep the whole situation in
 mind and make even more contributions.  In the course of readjustment, we
 must ensure fulfillment of the national plan, particularly fulfillment of
 the tasks related to the focal products such as grain, coal, crude oil,
 timber, electric machines, and so on.  The quantities of raw materials and
 products we should deliver must be so delivered.  Under the logical premise
 of relatively stabilizing the sowing area for grain, we should principally
 depend on raising the per-unit yield and developing economic crops and
 diversified operation.  At the same time, we should sum up the lessons from
 history and under the logical premise of ensuring the whole interests of
 the state, we should pay attention to the economic interests of this
 province, make full use of our strong points but avoid our weak points,
 fully utilize our superiority in natural resources and promote the develop-
 ment of light and textile industries and the food industry.  After having
 fulfilled the assigned delivery tasks of our products and resources, all the
 raw materials for our light industry which can be processed locally should
 first of all be processed locally.  This is a comparatively better method,
 and is advantageous to both our province and the state.  In bringing our
 superiority in resources into full play, attention should be jointly given
 to demand and feasibility.  Due to our limited funds and technological
 strength, concerning those raw materials and primary-grade products which,
 due to our limited funds and technological strength we lack the necessary
 conditions to fully utilize at the moment, either let the state ship .them'
 out on a unified basis,, or let our brother provinces and municipalities
 join with us in handling them on the principle of equality and mutual
 benefit.  We heartily welcome our brother provinces and municipalities
 possessing the necessary technology and capital but lacking the necessary
 resources to cooperate with us in organizing joint operation enterprises
 in such sectors as the food industry, light and textile industries, timber
 and its comprehensive utilization, and so on.  Let us in this way further
 develop this treasure house of Heilongjiang.

 HOW TO STUDY THE SIXTH PART OF THE REPORT TO THE 12TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 pp 41-45
 [Article by RED FLAG Editorial Office for Theoretical Education; passages.
 within slantlines published in boldface]
 [Text] This part of the report deals with the task of building our party
 and making it a strong leading core for the cause of socialist moderniza-
 tion as required by the new party constitution.  It begins with an explana-
 tion of the general principle guiding the revision of the party constitu-
 tion and the main points of the draft.  It then goes on to expound the
 following four tasks which we must concentrate on in tackling party
 building:
 First, improve the party's system of democratic centralism and further
 normalize inner-party political life.
 Second, reform the leading bodies and the cadre system and ensure that the
 ranks of the cadres become more revolutionary, younger in average age,
 better educated and more professionally competent.
 Third, strengthen the party's work among the workers, peasants and intel-
 lectuals and establish close ties between the party and the masses.
 Fourth, consolidate the party organizations step by step in a planned way
 so as to effect a fundamental turn for the better in the style of the party.
 Lastly, it gives the whole report a summing-up.
 In studying this part of the report, we can divide the beginning, the four
 tasks and the summing-up into six main points.  We can then refer to rele-
 vant documents and materials to better understand the'substance and essen-
 tial spirit of these main points and concentrate on studying how to do a
 better job of party building in accordance with the requirements of the
 party Central Committee.
 /In studying the beginning of this part, it is possible to achieve a better
 understanding by attaching importance to the following:  First, better
 understand the general principle guiding the revision of the party
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2

 constitution in the light of the characteristics and needs of the new
 historical period.  Second, find out by means of comparison and contrast
 to what extent the new party constitution has discarded the "left" errors
 in the constitution adopted by the 11th congress and carried forward the
 merits of the party constitutions passed respectively by the 7th and 8th
 congresses.  Third, better understand the significance and main points of
 the revisions of the party constitution./
 The report pointed out that the general principle guiding the revision of
 the party constitution is to set more. exacting demands on party members,
 enhance the fighting capacity of the party organizations and uphold and
 improve party leadership in conformity with the characteristics and needs
 of the new historical period.  In essence, conformity with the charac-
 teristics and needs of the new historical period chiefly means:
 1)  Our party is a political party in power and occupies a leading position
 in the life of the state.  This position as a political party in power makes
 it easy for our comrades to be tainted with bureaucratic habits and to become
 arrogant and conceited.  The danger of divorcing oneself from reality and
 from the masses has increased rather than diminished.  Hence our party is
 confronted with new tests and must set more exacting demands on party
 organizations and party members.  This problem was discussed at great
 length in the report of the eighth party congress on the revision of the
 party constitution but was not followed up earnestly.  This time, on the
 basis of summing up positive and negative experiences, the 12th party con-
 gress took our party's position as a political party in power into full
 account and set forth stricter requirements for party building.  These
 demands are all embodied in the new party constitution.
 2)  In line with its position as a political party in power, our party
 must maintain sound political life and better adhere to the principles of
 democratic centralism and collective leadership.  Inner-party political
 life started to become abnormal in the late 1950's.  During the period of
 the "Great Cultural Revolution," in particular, the party's principles of
 democratic centralism and collective leadership were seriously undermined.
 It is precisely on the basis of summing up experience and lessons in this
 regard and in conformity with the need to set things right that the 12th
 party congress included a series of stipulations to this end in the party
 constitution.
 3)  The new historical period requires our party to shift the focus of its
 work to'leading the cause of socialist modernization and build a high level
 of socialist spiritual civilization while working fora high level of
 material civilization.  It requires us to develop socialist democracy and
 strengthen the socialist legal system.  It also requires us to ensure that
 the ranks of our party's cadres become more revolutionary, younger in
 average age, better educated and more professionally competent.  It is
 precisely in conformity with these requirements that the 12th party con-
 gress adopted clear-cut stipulations in the party constitution.

 4)  Our party style was seriously damaged during the 10 years of domestic
 turmoil.  Thus, one of our important tasks for the immediate future is to
 effect a fundamental turn for the better in our party style.  It is pre-
 cisely in conformity with this requirement that the 12th party congress
 adopted appropriate stipulations in the party constitution regarding the
 activities of party organizations and the qualifications of party members.
 In other words, our party's position as a political party in power, the
 responsibilities entrusted to our party by history and the present state
 of our party style all place higher demands on party building in the new
 historical period.  In the course of our study, we must analyze existing
 problems in our party in the light of the four points discussed above in
 order to acquire a better understanding of the general principle guiding
 the revision of the party constitution.
 On the basis of summing up experience in party building over the years,
 the new party constitution has made many changes in the constitution
 adopted by the 11th party congress.  It has discarded the."left" errors
 in that constitution and carried forward and developed the merits of the
 constitutions passed respectively by the 7th and 8th party congresses.
 Thus, it suits the characteristics of the new historical period and the
 needs arising from actual party life.
 The constitution adopted by the 11th party congress emphasized the need to
 uphold "the basic line of the socialist period" and the theory of "con-
 tinuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat," and
 totally affirmed the "Great Cultural Revolution."  It set forth the need
 to "carry out many more great cultural revolutions," the need to expel
 "unrepentant persons in power taking the capitalist road" from the party,
 and so on.  All these are "left" errors carried over from the constitu-
 tions passed respectively by the 9th and 10th party congresses.  These
 errors were systematically sorted out in the "Resolution on Certain
 Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC" and
 should of course be discarded in the new party constitution.
 The constitutions passed respectively by the seventh and eighth party con-
 gresses were drawn up under situations in which the party's guiding ideology
 was relatively correct and inner-party political life was relatively normal.
 Therefore, their provisions on various aspects were more scientific and
 practical.  Take the party's general task for example.  On the basis of an
 analysis of China's national condition, the constitution passed by the
 eighth party congress stated that the task of the party was to lead the
 cause of socialist modernization and that the fundamental objective of our
 party in all its work was to satisfy the material and cultural needs of the
 people.  With a view to strengthening party building, carrying forward the
 fine traditions of our party and enhancing the fighting capacity of our
 party, the constitutions passed respectively by the seventh and eighth party
 congresses both expounded in their "general program" the importance of main-
 taining party unity, following the mass line, develop' criticism and self-
 criticism, adhering to democratic centralism and wholeheartedly serving the
 people.  As far as the party's principle of democratic centralism, the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 obligations and rights of party members, the relationship between the party
 and the CYL, etc., were concerned, the provisions in the constitutions
 passed respectively by the seventh and eighth congresses were more detailed
 and clear-cut.  These good points have been carried forward and further
 developed in the new party constitution.  For this reason, the new party
 constitution is an improvement on all the previous constitutions and is
 fuller in content.
 To begin with, the new party constitution has a "general program" which is
 more substantial in content.  It gives us a more comprehensive and scien-
 tific outline of the party's character and guiding ideology, its long-term
 and immediate objectives, its basic requirements for party members and
 party organizations and the basic principle of how the party should cor-
 rectly play its leading role.  The main content of the revision of the
 party constitution can be summarized in the following three major aspects:
 First, it sets more exacting demands on party members, party cadres and
 grassroots organizations than those in all our previous constitutions and
 adds a new chapter on party cadres which expects more from them than from
 ordinary party members.  Second, it lays down more systematic and all-
 round provisions for the principles of democratic centralism and collective
 leadership as practiced by the party and emphasizes in particular that all
 major issues must be decided upon by party committees after democratic
 discussions and that all forms of personality cult must be forbidden.  It
 also stipulates stricter provisions for party discipline.  Third, it makes
 many new provisions for improving the systems of the central and local
 organizations, tightening party discipline, reinforcing discipline inspec-
 tion organs and strengthening grassroots party organizations.
 These changes in the party constitution have been made so we can strengthen
 and improve party leadership and build our party into a strong leading core
 for the cause of socialist modernization in the new historical period.
 Provided that the whole party acts strictly in accordance with the require-
 ments of the new party constitution, there will be a fundamental turn for
 the better in the style of our party, its fighting capacity will be
 enhanced, its prestige will rise and it will be able to preserve the
 purity'of communism and never degenerate.
 /In studying the first task, we must fully understand the significance of
 improving the system of democratic centralism in the whole party and
 normalizing inner-party political life on the basis of the integration of
 theory and practice.  We must also make clear the relationship between
 tightening party discipline and improving the functioning of democratic
 centralism./
 Democratic centralism is the basic organizational principle of the party
 and requires that we practice a high degree of centralism on the basis of
 a high degree of democracy.  It reflects the relationship between the party
 and those led by the party, between higher party organizations and lower
 organizations, between individual party members and the whole party,
 between central and local organizations on the one hand and the masses of
 party members on the other.  Without a high degree of democracy as our

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100410001-2
 foundation, we will never be able to .achieve correct centralism and will
 develop patriarchal ways of one person deciding matters arbitrarily.  With-
 out a high degree of centralism, we will never be able to achieve true
 democracy and will end up in a state of excessive democratization and
 anarchy inside the party.  Thus, in order to ensure a high degree of
 centralism and unity within the party on ideological and political matters
 and ensure the normalization of inner-party political life, it is necessary
 to improve the functioning of democratic centralism in the whole party.  In
 carrying out democratic centralism, it is necessary to properly handle the
 relationship between higher and lower levels and between collective leader-
 and individual responsibility.  From history, we can see that rightist
 ship
 and "leftist" mistakes usually had something to do with our failure to
 correctly handle these two relationships.  In the period from its founding
 to the early years after the establishment of the PRC, our party imple-
 mented the principles of democratic centralism relatively well and inner-
 party political life was fairly vigorous and lively.  This was essentially
 because we did a relatively good job of handling these two relationships.
 The report of the eighth party congress on the revision of the,-party con-
 stitution emphasized in particular the importance of properly handling the
 relationship between higher and lower levels, upholding the principle of
 collective leadership and opposing the personality cult.  After the con-
 gress, the personality cult gradually appeared and developed and major
 issues were no longer decided upon after. holding collective discussion
 according to the principle of democratic centralism.  Usually an individual
 .or a few people had the final say.  Patriarchal practices of "what I say
 goes" and placing oneself above the organization developed constantly.
 Political life in the party and state, particularly in the Central Com-
 mittee, grew more and more abnormal, leading eventually to the decade of
 domestic turmoil.  We should always bear in mind this lesson of history
 about how the wrecking of the system of democratic centralism brought great
 harm to the party and the people.
 On the basis of summing up historical experience, our party has, since the
 3d Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, laid great emphasis on the
 need to uphold democratic centralism.  As a result, political life in the
 party, and first of all in the Central Committee, has gradually returned to
 the correct path, the path of Marxism.  There has also been marked improve-
 ment in the political life of many local party organizations.  This is one
 of'the basic reasons why our party has been able to formulate correct
 principles and policies and make important achievements in various under-
 takings in recent years.  However, there are still many party organizations
 which have not done a good job in implementing the principle of democratic
 centralism.  On the one hand, undemocratic practices and patriarchal ways
 have. still not been eradicated.  On the other hand, cases of decentralism
 and liberalism exist to a serious extent.  In order to enhance the fighting
 capacity of the party, we must conduct thoroughgoing education on demo-
 cratic centralism in accordance with the requirements of the new party
 constitution and get rid of these unhealthy phenomena.
 Strict discipline is an important guarantee for improving the functioning
 of democratic centralism in the whole party and normalizing inner-party

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 political life.  The basic principle of democratic centralism is:  indi-
 vidual party members are subordinate to the party organization, the
 minority is subordinate to the majority, the lower party organizations are
 subordinate to the higher ones, and all the constituent organizations and
 members of the party are subordinate to the National Congress and the Central
 Committee of the party.  Every organization and member of the party must
 resolutely adhere to this basic principle.  No one is allowed to go his own
 way and carry out only those principles, policies and decisions which are to
 his liking.  Otherwise, the party will not be able to achieve the unity of
 will, acquire fighting capacity and fulfill its tasks.  Not only will
 stressing the need for strict party discipline not hamper the development
 of inner-party democracy but is an important prerequisite for ensuring the
 normal democratic life of the party.  The new party constitution explicitly
 stipulates that violations and expropriations of the democratic rights of
 party members and organizations will not be tolerated by party discipline.
 Owing to the decade of domestic turmoil and the damage done by the Lin Biao
 and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques, cases in which discipline has
 slackened, right and wrong are confused and rewards and punishments are
 misused can still be found to a fairly serious extent in quite a number of
 party organizations.  This is an important expression of the unhealthy
 style of the party and is an important reason why, the party has been unable
 to play its role properly.  It is precisely for this reason that the report,
 emphatically pointed out that party organizations at all levels must be
 mobilized to fight resolutely to uphold party discipline.  In order to
 strictly enforce party discipline, the new party constitution devotes two
 chapters to party discipline and organs for discipline inspection and sets
 forth clear-cut provisions in both.  In studying this problem, we must
 integrate the study of the new party constitution with  actual practice and
 overcome erroneous tendencies in the functioning of democratic centralism
 and the enforcement of party discipline.
 /In studying the second task, it is necessary to lay stress on gaining a
 clear idea of two things:  1) The significance of reforming the leading
 bodies and the importance of resolving the division of labor between party
 and government.  2) Why it is necessary to reform the cadre  system and
 ensure that the ranks of the'cadres become more revolutionary, younger in
 average age, better educated and professionally more competent./
 In the final analysis, the reform of the system of leadership and the lead-
 ing organs of the party and state is demanded by the cause of socialist
 modernization.   The modernization program requires the service of leading
 bodies which are compact but. vigorous, highly efficient and free from
 bureaucratic practices and which have clear-cut job responsibility.  How-
 ever, defects such as organizational overlapping, lack of clear-cut job
 responsibility, overstaffing, failure to separate party work from govern-
 ment work, "aging" of the team, and serious instances of bureaucracy are
 still found in our leading bodies.  All this is not in keeping with the
 requirements of modernization.  Unless we are resolved to carry out reform,
 we will not be able to effectively implement the party's line, principles
 and policies even if they are correct.  Even if we have mapped out excel-
 lent plans, we will not be able to carry them out smoothly.  Comrade Deng

 Xiaoping once emphatically pointed out that in a certain sense, organiza-
 tional reform is revolution.  Whether or not-,-.this revolution is carried out
 will not only determine the future of modernization but will affect the
 destiny of the party and state.  In the course of study, we must fully
 understand the far-reaching significance of organizational reform on the
 basis of integrating theory with practice and get rid of ideological
 obstacles in this regard.
 An important part of organizational reform is to correctly solve the ques-
 tion of the division of labor between party and government.  This question
 has not been properly resolved in all these years.  In many localities,
 particularly enterprises, the party organizations often fail to separate
 party work from government work; instead they take everything into their
 own hands.  They have the habit of monopolizing administrative affairs.
 In so doing, they do not have the. time or energy for major issues which
 must be grasped, and thus weaken party leadership.  On the other hand,
 because the party has taken over the functioning of the government and the
 government that of the enterprises, many administrative organs and produc-
 tion organizations cannot play their respective roles. fully or independently.
 The normal progress of work is thus affected.  Party work must be separated
 from government work and the party should concern itself only with party
 affairs.  This will not only strengthen and improve party leadership but is
 an important guarantee for giving full play to the leadership role of
 administrative organs at all levels.  In the course of study, we must find
 out what are the leadership responsibilities of the party, why it is neces-
 sary to separate party work from government work and how we should go about
 it.  Party workers must pay attention to overcoming the erroneous idea that
 there will be nothing for them to do if they do not handle concrete admin-
 istrative work.  Comrades working in administrative departments and estab-
 lishments must pay attention to guarding against the erroneous tendencies
 of-breaking away from party leadership and refusing to carry out the party's
 principles and policies.
 Next to the reform of the leading bodies, another important task which
 urgently requires tackling is to reform the cadre system and ensure that
 the ranks of the cadres become more revolutionary, younger in average age,
 better educated and more professionally competent.  This is a cardinal
 principle for the party's work concerning cadres in the new period.  At
 present, "aging" is quite a serious problem in the leading bodies at
 various levels.  Many cadres do not possess the necessary cultural, scien-
 tific and technical knowledge.  This is in sharp contradiction to the
 requirements of socialist modernization.  In view of this situation, the
 party Central Committee set forth the timely demand that we gradually lower
 the average age of the ranks of the cadres and ensure that they become
 better educated and more professionally competent with the prerequisite of
 becoming more revolutionary.  In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary
 to reform that part of the cadre system which does not suit these needs.
 The so-called reform of the cadre system includes the abolition of the de
 facto life tenure for leadership posts, the introduction of a system
 requiring veteran cadres to retire or withdraw to the'second line, the
 institution and perfection of systems of job responsibility for different

 levels and types of cadres, together with corresponding systems governing
 the'training of cadres in rotation, their assessment, promotion and demo-
 tion, reward and punishment and so on, as well as efforts to further improve
 systems governing the democratic election and appointment and dismissal of
 cadres.  By carrying out these reforms in earnest, we will be able to pro-
 mote large numbers of energetic young and middle-aged cadres, who possess
 both political integrity and ability, to various leading posts in good time,
 and provide an institutional guarantee for the succession of the new to the
 old.  We must fully understand the importance and pressing nature of the
 "four reforms" in the ranks of the cadres and further eliminate erroneous
 ideas such as that cadres can only move up but never step down, "taking
 seniority as the only qualification" and discriminating against intellec-
 tuals, which have developed over the years.  In his address to the 12th
 party congress, Comrade Chen Yun put forth an important principle for
 resolving the question of the succession of cadres.  We must earnestly
 study his speech and grasp its essence.  The Central Committee stipulated
 that in the future all cadres must take part in training in rotation.
 This is an important strategic measure for raising the quality of cadres.
 Every comrade must fully understand the far-reaching significance of this
 measure, guard against the unhealthy tendencies of slighting knowledge and
 resigning ourselves to be mere laymen and actively take part in study.
 /In.studying the third task, we must understand why it is necessary to
 establish close ties between the party and the masses in the new historical
 period.  We must also understand the importance of strengthening the party's
 work among the workers, peasants and intellectuals./
 Wholeheartedly serving the people, proceeding from the best interests of
 the broad masses of the people in everything, firmly trusting and relying
 on the masses and maintaining close ties with them are the fine traditions
 developed in our party in the course of protracted revolutionary struggles.
 They are important guarantees for defeating mighty enemies and overcoming
 difficulties to win victories.  Under new historical conditions, it is of
 particular significance to preserve and carry forward these fine tradi-
 tions.  Our party's position as a political party in power determines that
 its activities vitally affect the interests of the masses.  Only by main-
 taining close ties with the masses and pooling their opinions, experience
 and wisdom can we formulate correct principles and policies and translate
 these principles and policies into mass action.  Estrangement from the
 masses can cause far greater damage now than before we came into power.
 Owing to the series of errors made by our party in its guidance work,
 particularly the mistake of the "Great Cultural Revolution," the party's
 ties with the masses have been weakened.  Some cadres forgot all about the
 fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses and set them-
 selves above the masses.  Some even made use of their authority to
 encroach on the interests of the masses and do damage to the party's cause.
 For this reason, we must conscientiously learn from the experience and
 lessons of history and effectively strengthen the flesh-and-blood ties
 between the party and the masses in every respect.  This is a question of
 fundamental importance in strengthening party building under new historical
 conditions.

 Our party has always attached great importance to'work among the workers,
 peasants and intellectuals and among the young people and women, and has
 accumulated rich experience in mass work.  However, owing to the decade of
 domestic turmoil and changes in historical conditions, the party's mass
 work has been somewhat weakened.  This is not compatible with the historical
 mission shouldered by the party in leading the cause of socialist moderniza-
 tion, and it urgently needs strengthening.  The report analyzed the actual
 state and new characteristics of various sections of the masses.  In the
 light of existing problems, it set.forth the task and requirements of
 strengthening links between the party and the workers, peasants and intel-
 lectuals.  It also set forth the principle of work and direction of
 endeavor for trade unions, the CYL, and women's federations.  All comrades,
 particularly those directly engaged in mass work, should make an earnest
 effort to understand the report, sum up experience and unify their thinking
 in line with the spirit of the report.
 /In studying the fourth task, we must correctly understand the present con-
 dition of the party and have firm faith that there will be fundamental turn
 for the better in the style of the party.  We must also understand the
 significance of party consolidation and also the principle and measures
 involved, and actively make ideological preparation./
 As the core leading the cause of socialist modernization, our party shoulders
 a heavy historical responsibility.  Practice since the third plenary session
 has shown and will continue to show that our party will definitely be able
 to better build itself up and lead the people of the whole country in
 creating a new situation of socialist modernization.  In view of the grave
 problems now existing in party style, some comrades do not have much
 confidence that our party can better build itself up and effect a funda-
 mental turn for the better in its style in the next 5 years.  The main
 reason for this kind of passive thinking is that they have not seriously
 analyzed the state of our party.  Our party is a party which has been nur-.
 tured over the years by Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. It is a party
 which has gone through the tempering of protracted revolutionary struggles
 and has been reared in glorious revolutionary traditions.  Our party has
 rallied'to its ranks outstanding elements of the Chinese working classes and
 the Chinese people and has brought up countless heroes who fought hard and
 laid down their lives for the communist cause.  The masses of fine Communist
 Party members are wholeheartedly serving the people and playing an exemplary
 role in production and other work..  Thus, despite the serious damage
 inflicted by the "Great Cultural Revolution," the main body of our party
 remains politically pure, healthy and strong on the whole.  On the other
 hand, it is true that impurities in ideology, style and organization still
 exist within the party.  The dark aspects cited in the report do exist.
 If we do not resolutely wage a struggle against these dark aspects and let
 them develop unchecked instead, our party will be in danger of degeneration
 and we will not be able to win a victory in the cause of socialist moderni-
 zation.   It is precisely with this in mind that the party Central Committee
 has time and again emphasized that the style of a political party in power
 determines its very survival.  From this high.level of political under-
 standing, it has led the whole party to wage an unremitting struggle against

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 unhealthy tendencies.  The staunch determination of the party Central
 Committee in resolving the question of party style can be seen in the
 formulation of the "Guiding Principles for Inner Party Political Life,"
 the struggle waged under its leadership to strike at grave crimes in the
 economic and other spheres and the decision made by the 12th party congress
 to carry out all-round consolidation of party organizations and rectifica-
 tion of party style.  The majority of party members also urge that further
 efforts be made to straighten out the style of the'party and remove the
 dirt from the body of our party.  The determination of the party Central
 Committee and the vast numbers of party meifnbers constitutes an irresistible
 force and a fundamental guarantee for the success of party consolidation
 and rectification. Facts show that the style of the party has improved
 compared with the past few years and will continue to improve.  It is
 groundless to doubt that we can effect a fundamental change for the better
 in the style of the party.  It is also completely wrong to take a passive
 and pessimistic attitude toward the dark aspects of the party.
 The 12th party congress decided on an overall rectification of party style
 and consolidation of party organizations, which will proceed by stages and
 by groups over a period of 3 years beginning from the latter half of 1982.
 This is an important measure for effecting a fundamental turn for the
 better in-the style of the party and a fundamental guarantee for the per-.
 sis,tence of the socialist road.  Everyone knows that the consolidation of
 party organizations and rectification of party style is the successful
 experience gained by our party in strengthening itself.  The Yanan rectifi-
 cation movement of 1942 enabled the whole party to achieve unprecedented
 unity and solidarity ideologically, politically and organizationally and
 laid the foundations for winning the new democratic revolution.  Now we
 are going to carry out another party consolidation and rectification under
 new historical conditions.  It will be no less significant than that of the
 Yanan rectification movement.  Of course things are different now.  The
 forthcoming party consolidation and rectification is aimed mainly at
 resolving the question of whether party members are qualified or not.  It is
 true that some of our party members do not meet the requirements and cannot
 set an example for the masses.  Some party members simply do not have com-
 munist ideals; some take advantage of their position to encroach on the
 interests of the masses, the',collective and the state; some even take
 bribes, pervert justice and become overlords who ride roughshod over the
 masses.  Through consolidating the party organizations and by adhering
 strictly to the new party constitution, we should expel from the party those
 who still fail to meet the requirements for membership after education, or
 ask them to withdraw from it.  At the same time, party organizations at all
 levels and all party members should be told to strictly carry out the pro-
 visions of the new party constitution.  In this way, there will be a marked
 change in the image of party members and cadres among the masses, the
 party will take on a new look in the eyes of the people of various nationali-
 ties throughout the country and the party's fighting capacity and leadership
 role will be greatly strengthened.
 The consolidation of party organizations is a matter of primary importance
 in party building at present.  It must be carried out step by step and in a

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100410001-2
 planned way in accordance with the. principle laid down by the Central Com-
 mittee.                     In matters of organization and leadership, the consolidation will
 start with the leading organs and cadres and then proceed, from top to
 bottom, to consolidate the leading bodies at different levels and effect an
 improvement in the work of party organizations and the method of leadership
 at all levels.  In the course of consolidating party organizations, it is
 necessary to follow the principles of "learning from past mistakes to avoid
 future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "clarity in
 ideology and unity among comrades" in unfolding criticism and self-criticism.
 In the final stage, there will be a reregistration of all party members.
 Although the all-round consolidation of party organizations will not start
 until the latter half of next year, there are problems which ought to be
 tackled now, such as the consolidation of leading bodies and the combating
 of serious crimes in the economic field.  We must attend to these problems
 in earnest and must not leave everything until the all-round consolidation
 of party organizations begins.  At present, we must conscientiously study
 the report of the 12th party congress and the new party constitution in
 conjunction with the study of the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the
 History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC" and the "Guiding Prin-
 ciples for Inner-Party Political Life" and make ideological preparation
 for the consolidation of party organizations and the rectification of party
 style.
 /In studying the summing-up of the report, we must lay stress on understand-
 ing the following:  1) The various fighting tasks confronting the party and
 the fact that we are bound to win; 2) the correct handling of difficulties;
 and 3) the need to forever uphold the principle of combining the universal
 truth of Marxism with the actual conditions in our country./
 The general task set by the 12th party congress for our party in the new
 historical period is to unite the people of all our nationalities in working
 hard and self-reliantly to achieve, step by step, the modernization of
 industry, agriculture, national defense and science and technology and
 building our country into a socialist country with a high level of civili-
 zation and democracy.  In accordance with the requirements of the general
 task and proceeding from present conditions, we must concentrate on grasping
 four tasks in the period to come.  First, we must systematically complete
 organizational reform and the reform of economic systems.   Second, we must
 go all out in building socialist spiritual civilization.  Third, we must hit
 hard at the serious criminal activities undermining our socialist economy
 and socialist system.  Fourth, we must rectify the party style and consoli-
 date the party organizations.  In the coming 5 years, we must effect a
 fundamental turn for the better in the financial and economic situation,
 in the standards of social conduct and in party style.   In addition to the
 above-mentioned tasks, our party faces yet another historic task, that of
 working hard to achieve the sacred task of reunifying our motherland.  At
 the same time, we must continue in our struggle to oppose imperialism and
 hegemonism and safeguard world peace.  These are the lofty tasks of creating
 a .new situation in all fields that lie before us.  All these tasks reflect
 the common interests and demands of the people of all, nationalities through-
 out the country.  They accord with the desires of the people and the tide of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 history.  Provided that we act according to the principles laid down by the
 12th party congress, we will definitely be able to accomplish the above-
 mentioned fighting tasks.  Our future is that our modernization and reunifi-
 cation will definitely succeed.
 Fulfillment of the fighting tasks set by the party is by no means easy and
 will not be plain sailing. We are bound to encounter all kinds of diffi-
 culties.  The attitude we take toward difficulties has an important bearing
 on whether or not we can accomplish the party's tasks.  If we overlook the
 difficulties, overestimate our subjective will and power and act blindly
 and rashly, we are bound to run up against a brick wall.  If we see nothing
 but difficulties, lose faith in the strength of the party and the masses
 and waver and procrastinate, we will accomplish nothing.  The correct atti-
 tude should be to go among the masses and dig into actual work, forge ahead
 in the struggle with added vigor and fight indomitably and indefatigably.
 In the course of study, we must take a correct attitude toward work tasks
 and difficulties and ponder over the question of how to better accomplish
 the tasks given us by the party in the light of our actual thinking and
 work.
 We must integrate the universal truth of Marxism with China's actual con-
 ditions, follow our own road and build socialism with distinctly Chinese
 features.  This is a basic conclusion drawn by our party after summing up
 historical experience over the years.  In order to achieve this integra-
 tion, we must promptly and correctly unfold the struggle between the two
 lines, oppose "left" and right tendencies wherever they appear and guard
 against and overcome all erroneous tendencies which deviate from the
 correct path.  We must conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong
 Thought and use the overall view of materialist dialectics to overcome the
 one-sided metaphysical approach of jumping from one extreme to another and
 shifting'from one tendency to another.  If comrades of the whole party can
 persevere in learning from the stand, viewpoint and method of Marxism,
 persist in going deep into the realities of life to conduct investigation
 and study and correctly implement the line, principles and policies of the
 party, the fighting tasks set by our party will definitely be fulfilled.

 HOW CAN WE SAY THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO QUADRUPLE INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL
 PRODUCTION VALUE BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY?
 Beijing RED FLAG.in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 pp 46-47
 [Article by Zhao Qi [0340 0366]]
 [Text] In his report to the 12th CPC National Congress, Hu Haobang said
 that the target for which our, economic construction should struggle from
 1981 until the end of the century is to quadruple industrial and agricul-
 tural production value on the premise of constantly improving economic
 efficiency.  Such a glorious target will encourage-the people and is
 perfectly feasible.  Some comrades feel that such a target is similar to
 those of 1958 and 1978--totally divorced from reality--and they are doubt-
 ful of being able to realize it.  How then should we look at this question?
 1.  We should look at it in terms of historical conditions.  In 1958 and
 1978 economic construction was not in fact taken as the nucleus of the
 party's work, nor were the relations between politics and economics
 correctly handled and positioned. At that time appreciation and under-
 standing of the rules of socialist construction was not very great, while
 economic construction quotas manifested a good deal of subjective arbi-
 trariness.  The situation today is completely different.  After the third
 plenary session of the party the focal point of the party's work was trans-
 ferred to socialist modernized construction.  With a guiding ideology we
 completed the restoration of order out of chaos, corrected the longstanding
 "leftist" mistakes that had been hindering economic development and, on the
 basis'of summing up all our positive and negative experiences, we created
 a correct party line with correct policies and direction.  The party's
 appreciation and understanding of the rules of socialist construction
 increased greatly in comparison to before, while all-round experience grew
 as well and consciousness and support of the implementation of correct
 party policies and plans also improved enormously   Economic construction
 was carried out under the collective guidance and leadership of the party
 Central Committee while major policies and tactical targets which embodied
 the collective wisdom of the entire party were thoroughly examined and
 investigated before release.
 2.  We should look in terms of the content of the targets.  The quadrupling
 mentioned in the 12th national congress is a target with overall balance
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 1111H Re those previous ones which displayed ignorance of the rules of pro-
 portional development and the need for overall balance.  Quadrupling takes
 the raising of economic efficiency as its premise and not only demands that
 both efficiency and speed unite together but, at the same time, it ensures
 further state construction and improvements in people's living standards.
 Such a target is comparably better than past ones which one-sidedly strove
 for quantity and production value, ignoring the targets of quality, effi-
 ciency and benefit.
 3.  We should look at the question in terms of the possibility of realizing
 the target.  In the past, high targets were unrealizable because they were
 so divorced from reality.  The quadrupling laid out in the 12th national
 congress is based on objective studies.  During the years from 1953 to 1981,
 despite the 10 years of social disorder and destruction and mistaken guid-
 ance in economic work, there was still an annual average rise in industrial
 and agricultural production value of 8.1 percent.  To reach quadrupling,
 we only need a continued average annual increase of 7.2 percent.  Why is it
 that what we were able to do in the past is not possible today?  Of course,
 we should remember that the base figures we start with today are much higher
 than those in 1953 and the absolute figures included in every 1 percent
 increase today are much more, thus making things that much more difficult.
 Nevertheless, we should remember that present favorable conditions are much
 more numerous than in the past.  In addition to the favorable conditions of
 politics and ideology mentioned above, the 30 years of socialist construc-
 tion that we have experienced have provided us with a very good foundation
 of material technology and we have already established an independent and
 relatively complete industrial system and system of national economy.  In
 1980, industrial production value represented 69.9 percent of total indus-
 trial and agricultural production value as compared with 43.1 percent in
 1952.  The number of industrial enterprises expanded to a figure of 370,000
 with a wide range of differing fields, and as the overall arrangement of
 industry grew constantly better, some important'industrial products leapt
 into a world ranking position.  Conditions in agricultural production also
 saw definite improvements.  We gained a batch of management personnel and
 technicians who have made remarkable achievements, in the areas of science
 and technology.  In 1981 all of China's work units working under the system
 of ownership by the people possessed a total of 5,714,000 natural scien-
 tists and technologists, an increase of over 12 times the figure for 1952.
 Such are the favorable conditions we have for achieving a quadrupling of
 production value in industry and agriculture by 2000.
 It should be remembered that the development potential of China's national
 economy is still enormous and some present important targets which reflect
 economic benefits are not only lower than those of economically developed
 countries but they are also lower than some of the best economic levels
 reached in China in the past.  If we inspire enthusiasm in every area and
 trust in governmental policies and the fact that technological improvements
 and advances will be able to unearth the enormous potential in enterprises,
 then we will be able to greatly increase economic benefits and speed up
 construction with little or-no increases in equipment, raw materials,
 energy or manpower.

 Some comrades pointed out that in 1981, industrial and agricultural produc-
 tion value only grew 4.5 percent over the previous year and that other
 figures in recent years are not much higher.  Therefore, these comrades
 gddstion whether quadrupling is actually a feasible target to set our-
 selves.                     We should not take an isolated and static point of view to
 examine this question.  Over a 20-year period, the annual average increase
 stands at 7.2 percent, but this does not imply that we want to reach this
 figure immediately.  We are saying that is to be seen as an average.  Dur-
 ing these 20 years, the first 10 displayed an annual average increase of
 less than 7 percent, while the final 10 years had increases of more than
 8 percent.  In this way, we will be able to achieve quadrupling by the end
 of this century.
 Speed of development during the first 10 years will not be very great, and
 the reason is that the backward situation concerning energy and communica-
 tions, which are restricting the development of China's economy, needs a
 long period of time before it may see any improvement.  Because'of a lack
 of funds and scientific personnel, original key technology projects and
 improvements in enterprise technology have so far only been carried out in
 only the most important areas and schemes have not expanded into wider
 spheres.  The development of science and technology, training of technical
 personnel, etc., also all involve specific processes.  Over a long period
 in the past, imbalances in the national economy and irrationalities in
 product structure, enterprise organizational structure and the economic
 management system that existed all required the expenditure of a great deal
 of time and energy for readjustment and restructuring.  The 12th CPC
 National Congress suggested tactical deployment split into two main parts
 and drew up a series of measures and important principles designed to solve
 problems which will arise during the first 10 years.
 After the first 10 years of readjustment the national economy will have
 sorted out the relations between all feasible areas and the delayed after-
 effect'will be enormous, resulting in the last 10 years' development speed
 far surpassing that of the 1980's.  This is because:
 1.  In the second 10-year period readjustments to the economic structure,
 including interenterprise and internal enterprise readjustments, will have
 been to a large extent completed.  The economic management system will also
 have reached an essential rationale and enterprise management and adminis-
 tration will by that time be on the right track, meaning that socialist
 spiritual civilization will be able to achieve even greater results and
 the enthusiasm of every region, every enterprise and all the workers will
 have been activated to even greater extents.  As a result of these factors,
 today's enterprise will greatly increase production power and raise quantity
 and quality at the same time it moves toward raising economic benefits and
 efficiency to these future levels.
 2.  There will be large-scale increases in energy in the last 10-year
 period.  As technology progresses and develops there will be huge decreases
 in energy consumption.  At present, China's use of energy is not very effi-
 cient but the potential for economizing is enormous.  Annual consumption of
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 standard coal in China is about the same as in Japan, but our production
 value as a result of such consumption is about one-fourth that of Japan.
 Of course there are some factors which make the situation not so easily
 comparable, for example the make-up of energy supplies differs, so does the
 make-up of our products.  But according to projected statistics, if by the
 end of this century the production technology of the most important sectors
 of China's industries is able to reach the level of present-day economically
 developed countries, then product-producing enterprises and work units will
 be able to cut their consumption. to half of the present amounts, and for
 every 1 percent increase in production value there will be only an 0.5 per-
 cent increase in energy consumption.  This is of extreme significance to
 the elevation of industrial production value.
 3.  As science and technology-develop, the accuracy and precision of work-
 manship of products will increase as well, thus products will rise in
 quality and increase in variety, and all this will in turn increase the
 value of the products.  The present utilization ratio of China's crude oil
 is very low and it should be remembered that economically advanced coun-
 tries, by processing crude oil into petroleum product, are able to increase
 prices 10 times and an additional 10 times when further processing produces
 end products with petroleum bases.  In other words petroleum-based end
 products have a value 100 times that of crude oil.  Obviously our potential
 in this area is enormous.  The same quantity of raw material at that time.
 will be able to produce twice as much as, or several times as much as or
 even several times 10 as much production value as now.  Thus quadrupling
 does not by any means demand quadrupling of all products in terms of quan-
 tity.  Some products, such a$ oil, need only be doubled in production value
 while the end products processed from the oil will produce production values
 far in excess of any quadrupling.
 4.  Some newly established areas of industry such as electronics, nuclear
 energy, oil refining, etc., will all see much faster development during the
 second 10 years, and this will bring about large-scale increases in quantity
 as well as production value increases.
 The few topics discussed above are all intimately linked with the develop-
 ment of technology.  It would be impossible to bring about  this quadrupling
 by using old equipment, old technology, old raw materials and old products.
 What is of utmost importance is our reliance on the development of science
 and technology. Today, China's industrial production technology is similar
 to that of economically advanced countries during the'end of the 1950's and
 early 1960's.  Today's science and technology in these economically advanced
 countries have made their most significant advances only in the last 20
 years or so.   So starting from now we must use the next 20 years to overtake
 levels that economically developed countries achieved in the last 20 years
 in certain areas.  Not only is this possible but it is something we should
 achieve, and to look at the.situation in this way provides us with the
 means to achieve the quadrupling of the industrial and agricultural produc-
 tion value.

 WHY IS IT THAT PEASANT INCOMES SHOULD NO LONGER BE INCREASED MAINLY BY
 RAISING THE PRICES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 pp 47-48
 [Article by Xu Ke [6079 2688]]
 [Text] With the exception of low production areas and regions that have
 suffered natural disasters, the last few years have seen general increases
 in peasants' incomes with obvious improvements in standards of living.
 The reasons for the relatively fast increases in peasants' incomes, apart
 from increases in production, are mainly because since 1979 the state has
 been increasing the selling prices of grain and other agricultural products
 on a fairly large scale.  During the 28-year period from 1950 to 1978 the
 price of agricultural products rose by 117.4 percent, an average annual
 increase of 2.8 percent.  In the 3 years from 1979 to 1981 prices of agri-
 cultural products rose by 38.5 percent, showing an average annual increase
 of 11.5 percent.  In 1981, sales of agricultural products far surpassed
 income for 1978, reaching 19,800 million yuan, mainly because of increases
 in brand prices and an extension to the spheres of negotiated prices and
 the limits of surplus prices.  Thus the 1981 income averaged out to 34 yuan
 for every peasant.  All this was very beneficial to promoting the develop-
 ment of agriculture, improving the standards of living of the peasants and
 activating the peasants' enthusiasm.  From a long-term point of view, it is
 still possible to carry out readjustments in the price parities between
 industrial and agricultural products but in the future lengthy period of
 peasant income increases we can no longer rely only on raising the prices
 of agricultural products, nor can we rely on decreases in requisition by
 purchase or increases in the scale of negotiated prices.  Why is this?
 We know that no matter whether we raise the prices of agricultural products
 to the limits of negotiated prices, at the same time that state purchases
 of agricultural products rise, expenditure will also necessarily increase.
 In other words, whereas before the state relied on agricultural commodity
 exchange to ensure stable prices, from which the peasants received a por-
 tion of their income, now it relies on raising prices and this increase
 again is returned to the peasant.  At present China is in the process of
 carrying out readjustments and therefore needs concentrated funds for
 essential construction work.  Most of these funds come from taxes and the
 profits of state-run enterprises handed over to the state.  However, it is'

 also necessary that the peasants furbish a portion of this accumulation.
 If there is no relatively large-scale increase in the labor production rate
 within an industry and we continue to raise the prices of agricultural
 products and enlarge the limits of negotiated prices and drop the amount of
 requisition by purchase, then the concentrated funds from the peasants will
 be reduced by the state, thereby affecting modernized construction.  This
 is not in keeping with the essential benefits of the people of the entire
 country, including the peasants.
 In terms of the present state of .the country's finances we cannot permit
 continued price increases of agricultural products.  Our country's economy
 is at present in the middle of readjustment and annual increases in national
 income are not large.  In terms of the financial management system, expan-
 sion of regional and enterprise financial autocracy has meant less profits
 received by the state from enterprises in the last few years.  This has
 resulted in continued decreases in national revenue.  Furthermore, govern-
 ment expenditure has shot up in some areas.  As far as government subsidies
 on essential items and some agricultural products are concerned, the 1978
 figures stood at 7,800 million yuan, while after some prices of agricul-
 tural products had been raised in 1979, the figure  in 1981 reached 3Z,000
 million yuan, representing 30 percent of the year's financial revenue.  If
 the selling price of agricultural by-products remains stable but the pur-
 chasing prices of agricultural products continue to rise then state finances
 used to subsidize these prices will also continue to rise and with no
 large-scale increases in state revenue, the state financial department will
 find it extremely hard going.
 The extremely fast increases in consumer funds do not suggest that
 increases in agricultural products purchasing prices are a good idea
 either.  In recent years, the incomes of the people both in cities and in
 the countryside have improved considerably while standards of living have
 also improved to varying degrees.  Nevertheless, we must appreciate that
 these improvements in the standards of living in urban areas and the
 countryside have taken place despite the lack of large-scale increases in
 state revenues.  During the Cultural Revolution our handling of the rela-
 tions between economic construction and the people's livelihood was not
 good, with accumulation rates reaching levels which were too high, thereby
 putting pressure on consumption by the people.   In order to change this
 situation the state has been lowering the accumulation rate over the last
 few years and using nearly all of the new increases in state revenue to
 improve the standards of living of the people.   Such actions as these are
 only feasible on a short-term and limited time scale.  Accumulation is the''
 very source and wellspring of extended reproduction and without accumula-
 tion it would be difficult for production to develop, and thus the standards
 of living of the people, both in urban areas and in the countryside, would
 not improve.  In order to achieve "food" and "construction" we can no longer
 rely on reducing accumulation funds.  As from today standards of living will
 continue to improve but increases in workers' average wages should be kept
 on a par with rises in labor production rates.   Increase in peasants' incomes
 should for the most part depend on the development of,production, the lower-
 ing of production costs and improvements in labor production rates.

 HOW SHOULD WE UNDERSTAND THE NOTION THAT THE SOCIALIST CHARACTER OF
 SPIRITUAL CIVILIZATION IS DECIDED BY IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 p 48
 [Article by Wu Hong [0702 4540]]
 [Text]  The establishment of socialist spiritual civilization includes the
 establishment of both culture and ideology.  The establishment of culture
 provides the foundations of culture and knowledge necessary for ideological
 construction.  In a socialist system, raising the levels of development of
 education, science, culture, etc. benefits greatly the elevation of
 ideological consciousness and socialist morality and plays an important
 role in helping to study and grasp the theories of Marxism, as well as the
 reception of communist education.  However, the socialist character of
 spiritual civilization is by no means decided by the scale and level of
 development of cultural construction, but is instead decided by ideological
 construction.
 The contents of ideological construction guide the developmental direction
 and developmental extent of society's political ideology and moral think-
 ing.  The ideological construction mentioned in the move toward the estab-
 lishment of socialist spiritual civilization during the 12th CPC National
 Congress includes six main areas and all in all the most important are
 revolutionary ideals, morality and discipline.  Here, then, the teaching
 of communist ideology becomes the nucleus for ideological construction and
 cultural construction must develop under the direction of communist ideology.
 This is an innate characteristic of socialist spiritual civilization and it
 is the essential trait that separates socialist spiritual civilization from
 other kinds of social spiritual civilization.   Socialism is the first stage
 to communism and not only should the productive forces have reached a
 fairly well-developed level but the people should also have fairly high
 ideological consciousness and morality.  The limitless development of the
 people's consciousness is one of the most important things that separates
 socialism from capitalism.  Although material production in highly developed
 capitalist countries is well developed, at the same time one still finds
 widespread decadence, corruption and degeneracy within social and spiritual
 life in such countries.  In China, the most important'part of ideological
 construction is to teach people to establish communist ideals and morals
 and mold these into their world views.  In addition, it is important to

 teach people to make the realization of socialist modernization their own
 personal task and to encourage them not to fear hardship, nor death, to
 think of people in general and not of themselves and to stress selflessness
 as well as a total spiritual and physical commitment to serving the people
 and thereby strengthening organization and discipline.  Communist ideology
 as the nucleus of ideological construction plays an important role in the
 construction of socialist spiritual civilization and also decides the
 socialist character of the spiritual civilization.
 Socialist ideological construction corresponds exactly to the socialist
 systems of economy and politics.  The socialist society has eradicated
 exploiters and cases of suppression by making the public ownership of the
 means of production the replacement of private ownership and taking this
 as the economic foundation of socialist ideological construction.  Upon
 this foundation, the common ideals and aims of the workers are formed, as
 well as the common moral principles and standards of behavior.  Further-
 more, from this basis the mutual unification, assistance and love between
 people, which represent new social relations, establish and develop them-
 selves.  An economic system with socialist public ownership requires that
 the workers display collective ideology and establish an attitude of being
 masters of their world.  Furthermore, the state power of the people's
 democratic dictatorship provides important conditions for the development
 of socialist ideological construction, the strengthening of communist
 education and the eradication of the influences of bourgeois thinking.
 In a capitalist system of exploitation the relations between people are
 undisguised relations of gain and loss, cold-hearted relations of
 "monetary exchange."  Corresponding to this, the system of bourgeois
 ideology advocates such selfish concepts as "everyone for himself."  Such
 attitudes not only point to exploitation, but also to suppression and
 cheating.  Because socialism and capitalism are not the same, the develop-
 mental directions and the nature of their social political ideology and
 ideals and morals are not the same either and thus the spiritual appearance
 of the people differs too.  This fully illustrates that the socialist
 character of a spiritual civilization is decided by the socialist system
 and its corresponding ideological construction.

 A DISCUSSION ON 'RULE BY INACTION'--THOUGHTS ON READING LAO ZI, NOT A STUDY
 OF HIS PHILOSOPHIC THEORY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 21, 1 Nov 82 inside back cover
 [Article by Li Ming [2621 2494]]
 [Text] Lu Xun termed Lao Zi's principle of "do nothing and nothing will be
 left undone" as the "inflated words of a disciple" and "high-sounding but
 impractical."  He ridiculed Lao Zi as one "whose heart reached to the skies
 but whose life was as thin as paper," really hitting the nail on the head.
 The intention of this early philosopher was to abolish "government action."
 Lao Zi's political view of "inaction" had considerable influence on certain
 people, an influence reflected in society to this day.  Of course, today
 things are much more complicated than they were in ancient times and cannot
 be treated in the same way.  But comparing the past with the present, it
 would not be wrong to say that there still exist the "inflated words of a
 disciple."  On the surface, governing by "inaction" would seem to imply a
 situation in which nothing is forbidden.  But in fact it does not mean that
 nothing be controlled or that we can do whatever we like.  This has been
 proven in the passage in the 5,000 characters which defines a "small country
 with few people" in which "sages and wisdom have been abandoned."  "If you
 practice inaction, nothing will not be governed."  This phrase appears to
 advocate "inaction" but in fact contemplates "action."  Can we not say that
 this view is a Lao Zi-type advocation of "action"?  It is often the case in
 the world that if one person doesn't do something, someone else will.
 Otherwise, what is the purpose of taking so much trouble to write so many
 words?  Absolute "inaction" means keeping quiet and not saying a single
 word.
 It is not wrong to let things take their own course; arbitrary "action"
 doesn't easily produce success.  But it is not a good idea to think like
 Zhong Gongbao and'suggest such a policy for "governing a country."  Since
 we may choke while eating, slip when walking, should we simply sit down
 without moving, and not eat or walk so as not to choke or slip?  If all
 this was really put into practice, I'm afraid it would not only fail to
 bring an end to war but would also cause people a lot:of trouble.  The idea
 of confining people in their own small universe where each enjoys "himself"
 and everyone lives a free and happy life is only an illusion, because such

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100410001-2
 a view denies the freedom of a whole society to make progress.  Would
 people be willing to work in such a situation?  Wouldn't they rise in
 rebellion?
 "Those who understand me are few; those who follow me are precious."
 Luckily, this old philosopher knew himself, and did not insist on popu-
 larizing this view.  It was proper for him to go west to Hangu and "finally
 tread the shifting sands."  Sima Qian said that he lived for 160 years, or
 perhaps more than 200 years.  The philosopher also said that the little
 chief responsible for guarding the Hangu Pass worshipped his philosophy and
 consequently went along with the old man.  Whether true or not, this saying
 survives.
 Q Historical facts prove that those in the position of governing a country
 who really understood public feeling were always those who were intelligent
 and paid attention to reality.  For example, in the early days of the famous
 Han dynasty, when "the monarch and his subjects only wanted to rest and do
 nothing"; though they "respected knowledge," their thinking was not stagnant.
 What they "respected" was its spirit.  How could it be said that these
 ministers arbitrarily followed political blueprints, that everyone from the
 top to the grassroots levels was "resting" and sleeping and practiced
 "inaction" to the extent that they had not a single active plan for govern-
 ing the country?  There were a number of useful measures conforming to
 natural conditions, such as "encouraging agriculture," "abolishing exorbi-
 tant taxes and levies" and selecting and promoting talents.  It was said
 that "Cao Shen followed the rules and regulations defined by Xiao He."
 Liu Bang defined 3-part laws after he entered Shanhaiguan.  Later, Xiao He
 studied the laws defined by the Qin dynasty and worked out "9-part laws"
 to replace the "3-part laws"; it was not easy to define the later laws
 because they covered much wider aspects. Without laws and rules and regu-
 lations, it would not be possible for Xiao He to remain prime minister,
 nor would it have been possible for Cao Shen, should he want, to become an
 "idle" and "mediocre minister."
 It is a natural historical development to positively "act" according to
 nature.  To do nothing and let things take their own course and become
 "disciples who talk empty words" may be all right; but in this situation,
 it will be difficult to "govern a country in peace."  Is it really acci-
 dental that the globe did not turn around according to the desires of those
 who advocated ruling the country by "inaction"?  Otherwise, would it not be
 difficult for later generations to write books of theories, summing up the
 development of the civilization of China over the past 2,000 years and more?
 Historians and historians of philosophy have criticized the political view
 of "inaction" as "contrary to history" and "contrary to development" and
 held that this ideology is far more reactionary than the restorationism of
 Confucianism, and all the criticisms are basically in agreement.
 From a historical point of view, Lao Zi's political ideology of "inaction"
 was aimed at seeking a way out for the society of his time; it had its own
 reasons and historical conditions for its emergence.  We can in no way put
 demands on the people of ancient times with today's knowledge and

 arbitrarily regard them as ignorant and presumptuous; if we do so, we will
 find it hard to avoid becoming nihilistic.  After all, Lao Zi was a wise and
 great ideologist of ancient times.  He acknowledged the contradictions in
 society at that time and tried to solve them.  His valuable philosophical
 theory represents the ideological level of an era and it has been explained
 by a great number of people of ancient and present times who have spared no
 efforts to explain and study the books written by Lao Zi.  It is natural
 to inherit this fine cultural heritage with a critical attitude.  But we
 cannot mechanically compare the past with the present.  If we take Lao Zi's
 view of "inaction" as a yardstick to measure our present era, we will no
 doubt go against history.
