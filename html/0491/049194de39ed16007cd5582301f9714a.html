 Briefly Noted
 Threat    Soviet Espionage Recounted
 to
 World     One of the best summaries
 Security  to date of Soviet espio-
 nage abroad during the
 25X1C10b                   past forty years, Ronald
 25X1 C10b         Seth's UNMASKED*
 25X1C10b
 Seth is
 well qualified for his task:   he
 has more than thirty books on espi-
 onage and war to his credit; he
 served in British intelligence dur-
 ing WWII and parachuted into Estonia
 to organize resistance operations
 against the Germans.
 Seth's historical section traces
 the philosophy of Soviet espionage
 back to the Tsars' Okhrana (counter-
 espionage organization) and its heavy
 reliance on agents provocateurs.   He
 attributes the breakdown of Soviet
 agents under questioning largely to
 this orientation, and cites the be-
 havior of Mikhail Gorin when ar-
 rested by the FBI in the late 1930's.
 Gorin, who did not have diplomatic
 immunity, implicated Ambassador
 Constantin Oumansky by calling upon
 him for instructions.
 Both Soviet blunders and suc-
 cesses are recounted.   Great Britain,
 one of the first major powers to rec-
 ognize the USSR, broke off relations
 in 1927 because of the vast, although
 clumsy, Soviet espionage operations
 against her.   French experience was
 similar but rather than break dip-
 lomatic relations after arresting
 a number of spies in Soviet employ,
 they dealt more cautiously with the
 Soviets, at least for a number of
 years.
 Cases of Soviet espionage since
 WWII in the United States -- e.g.,
 the Abel case, and in Great Britain
 -- e.g., the Blake, Vassall and
 Lonsdale cases, appear in the final
 chapters.
 The author warns that official
 and public memories are short and
 that many more Soviet successes will
 be scored unless extreme vigilance
 is exercised.   While some of his
 other conclusions are debatable, re-
 cent exposure of highly successful
 Soviet subversion of Scandinavian
 nationals testify to the serious
 threat RIS activities continue to
 pose to world security.

 Brezhnev   Territorial Acquisitions.
 Belabors
 West       Speaking at Kiev on 23
 Germany    October, CPSU First
 Secretary Brezhnev as-
 serted that the West German "re-
 venge-seekers not only yearn for
 the lands beyond Elbe but also some
 territories of their allies."
 Appropriate media should reply
 that there is no valid reason to
 assume that the German Federal Re-
 public will emulate the Soviet Union
 -- which indeed has not only "yearned
 for," but has actually grasped ter-
 ritories of her allies, e.g., Eastern
 Poland, the:Carpatho-Ukraine, Bessarabia,
 and so forth.

 Historical               Marxian
 Fact         vs.     Theory
 Have you ever compared the major changes in
 SOVIET SOCIETY and in CPSU doctrine and pro-
 grams
 The little booklet
 THERMIDOR
 will do it for you.
 The historical process, in which the climax
 of the French Revolution is symbolized in the
 term THERMIDOR, is remarkably similar to what
 has been and is happening in the Soviet Union.
 Not only does this lesson (i.e., the anatomy
 of revolution) invalidate Marx' theory of the
 "inevitable" historical evolution of all so-
 ciety into a Communist form.
 It shows equally well that the Communist model
 cannot sustain REVOLUTIONARY PROGRESS; that
 change must be made to liberalize activities
 to permit progress; or that a dictatorship must
 be maintained to dominate people, if and as
 possible.

 Soviet News Agency -- Novosti or APN.  The USSR plans to make
 APN (Agentsvo Petschati Novosti) a commercial type news servoi,ce
 better able to compete with western agencies such as AP, UPI,
 AFP and with NCNA (New China News Agency).  Soviet journalists
 have charged that TASS pushes the official Soviet line without
 regard to audience reaction, and insist that APN replace it as
 the USSR's propaganda voice abroad.  Concerned with failure of
 Soviet press performance, particularly in the developing coun-
 tries where NCNA is expanding its activities, APN plans to in-
 crease its coverage of foreign and domestic news while continu-
 ing to supply feature articles as in the past.
 The Soviets will continue their attempts to project an
 image of APN as a non-official, independent news agency.   It
 was sponsored at its inception in 1961 by four Soviet front
 organizations, including the All-Union Society for Dissemin-
 ation of Scientific and Political Knowledge [formerly the
 League of Militant Godless].
 Already operating in the USSR and abroad, it is expected
 that APN will  increase its staff of foreign correspondents,
 and will work more energetically to capture additional markets
 for its services.
 Mikhailov Returns to Prominence as Soviet Censorship Czar.
 Nikolai A. Mikhailov has been made Chairman of the Soviet Gov-
 ernment's State Committee for Publishing.  This office is re-
 sponsible for censorship of the public press -- to prevent leaks
 of vital military, economic and political  information, among
 other things.   (See NY Times of 7 November.)
 Stalin appointed Mikhailov head of the Komsomol  in 1938;
 he remained for fourteen years.  Shortly before Stalin's death
 in March 1953, Mikhailov was appointed to the Party Presidium,
 but since then he has spent much of his time out of the coun-
 try, for example as Ambassador  to Poland and later to Indo-
 nesia.
 This appointment places one more former head of the
 Komsomol  in a critical position in the current CPSU govern-
 ment.                                Both Aleksandr Shelepin and Vladimir Semichastny grad-
 uated from this position to become chief of the K.G.B. --
 Committee of State Security (which the latter still holds).

 #66                          Commentary          27 Oct-9 Nov 1965
 Principal Developments:
 1.   The Communist world marks the 28th anniversary of the Soviet
 "October Revolution" -- the universal Communist holiday for almost half
 a century.  Although Soviet anniversary pronouncements are devoted largely
 to internal economic matters and to the common danger of imperialist ag-
 gression abroad, keynote speaker Polyansky defends Soviet ideological po-
 sitions under Chinese attack somewhat more sharply than other post-
 Khrushchev Soviet statements.   The Chinese are formally correct in their
 messages and speeches, but People's Daily features an obdurate -- though
 thinly veiled and relatively restrained -- polemical resume of Peking's
 case against CPSU positions.   It sounds a call to "unite all forces that
 can be united to defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and to carry
 the revolution through to the end," blatantly appealing to the Soviet
 people over the heads of their leaders.  The North Korean party echoes
 the Chinese call for struggle against modern revisionism, but the North
 Vietnamese express their thanks to the fraternal Soviet people.   Only a
 few leaders of minor CPs (with possible exception of India's Dange) are
 reported in Moscow for the celebration, though the East European top brass
 participate in local celebrations in their respective capitals (except the
 Rumanians, as noted in para. 8).
 2.  A few days after the Afro-Asian Foreign Ministers yielded to
 Chinese pressure and decided to postpone the Algiers Conference indefi-
 nitely (#65), Peking People's Daily lambasts the Soviets for their "shock-
 in 'role in the whole affair -- again appealing to the Soviet people over
 the heads of the regime.
 3.  While the Soviets and their sympathizers view developments in
 Indonesia with increasing alarm, the Chinese and their comrades-in-arms
 denounce not only the "anti-PKI and anti-Chicom campaign of Indonesian
 reaction" but also Soviet complicity in it!
 4.  In addition to attacking the Soviets in connection with the
 above issues, the Chinese publicize the savage 16 October Albanian Zeri
 I Popullit attack on the new Soviet leadership in connection with the
 first anniversary of K's ouster (Chrono #65) and a series of articles
 from the Pakistan press which "lay bare Soviet-American collusion" on
 Kashmir.
 5. Especially intriguing is some material the Chinese did not pub-
 lish.   On 1 November NCNA domestic service told its subscribers that
 People's Daily on the 2nd would devote 2 1/2 pages to the "anti-Chinese

 comments issued by the leaders of the CPs of the Soviet Union and other
 countries and their press since the March Moscow schismatic meeting,"
 together with an "editor's note" denouncing the "diabolical and schem-
 ing" new leaders of the CPSU and their "frequent and voluminous anti-
 Chinese instigation at home" and "covert anti-Chinese activities in many
 places abroad."  NCNA listed the following anti-Chinese materials as in-
 cluded:   11 Soviet, 19 Czech, 10 Hungarian, 8 Bulgarian, 2 East German,
 2 Polish, 7 Italian (L'Unita and Rinascita) and 6 French (L'Humanite).
 Only an hour later, however, NCNA transmitted a brief service message
 requesting that the above item be held up until further notice.   The
 material has not been published by the end of our period.
 6.   Another secret top-level bilateral Party meeting in the Soviet
 camp -- between a Brezhnev-led Soviet and Gomulka-led Polish delegation,
 "somewhere" in Belorussia -- is announced after it is completed.
 7.   Pravda reports on the Soviet-line communique and resolution
 of "the fourth conference" of 6 Central American CPs in Mexico (includ-
 ing a call for a world CP meeting) and TASS announces the formation of
 a "Soviet committee to assist the first solidarity conference of the peo-
 ples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in Havana 3-10 January."
 8.   Tirana reports colorfully on a new "sharp clash" at an inter-
 national front meeting:  the WIDF Council in Salsburg, 26-29 October.
 9.   The Rumanians continue their independent ways, publicizing
 that Italian CP boss Longo recently again opposed a world unity con-
 ference (while omitting his criticism of the Chinese) and failing to have
 either Party boss Ceausescu or Premier Maurer attend the October Revolution
 celebration in their own capital -- in contrast to the other East European
 Communist states.
 Significance:
 Contrary to widespread speculation, the Soviets did not convene a
 "little summit" of sympathetic WCM leaders in connection with the Moscow
 Revolution celebration.  Moreover, Soviet pronouncements on the occasion
 could not be taken as evidence of any decision to launch a new phase of
 more active and open opposition to the Chinese, even though Polyansky's
 keynote speech treated the issues in conflict somewhat more sharply than
 other post-Khrushchev leaders.   The Chinese, on the other hand, attack
 the Soviets on all fronts, now appealing again to the Soviet people over
 the heads of the leaders as during the Khrushchev era.   They also imply
 a possible initiative to organize their own M-L International in the 7
 November People's Daily call to "unite all forces that can be united" for
 their objectives.

 If neither the simmering crisis in Indonesia, nor a renewed out-
 break of hostilities between India and Pakistan lead to a new confronta-
 tion between Peking and Moscow, the 23rd CPSU Congress, scheduled for
 29 March 1966 is likely to provoke new fireworks -- especially if it
 brings about (which we are not yet prepared to predict) changes in the
 top leadership or either an endorsement or a revision of the doctrinal
 structure, developed at the 20th, 21st and 22nd congresses, particularly
 concerning the Khrushchev-sponsored new party program, voted at the 22nd
 congress, 1961.

 AFRO-ASIAN CONFERENCE
 Continued from #65:  The Foreign Ministers Preparatory Meeting for the
 Second Afro-Asian Conference in Algiers convenes on the 3Ot, (after
 postponement from the 28th), -- bo coy tied by th.e Chinese an,', their
 supporters in demanding an indefinite postponement of the cc nference N. Korea, N. Vietnam, Cambodia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tanza:iia, Guinea,
 and con p (Brazzaville).  After 3 days of "unefding haggling" (as NCNA
 puts it) over an immediate Indian motion to invite the Soviet Union and
 Malaysia, a Japanese proposal to include South Korea,-and a Philippine
 proposal to include South Vietnam -- plus the Chinese-initiated propo-
 sal for postponement (which NCNA says was "put forward" by 17 countries
 present), the Foreign Ministers finally decide in the early hours of
 2 November to postpone the summit conference and authorize the standing
 committee to  continue its efforts to prepare for a conference at a
 future date.
 Meanwhile, the North Korean government publicly calls for postpone-
 ment (27th) and the North Vietnemese in Nhan Dan (28th).  Registering
 the first Soviet comment on the Chinese decision to boycott the scheduled
 conference, Izvestiya (28th) equates the Chinese conduct with attempts
 by the Western imperialists to undermine the meeting,"to which the
 Soviet Union has given its whole-hearted support."  A Peking Peopie's
 Daily editorial (29th) blasts the "shocking attitude" of the Algerian
 hosts, their "crude violations of the principle of reaching consensus"
 in "forcibly convening the second A-A conference, thus pushing A-A
 solidarity into a split."  NCNA issues an "authorized statement" (31st)
 denying Western press reports that China would agree to participate if
 it were postponed 3 months and the Soviet Union excluded.  NCNA (2nd)
 reports the final decision on postponement without comment, but TASS
 quotes Bouteflika as "certain that I express general sentiments when
 I say that the attitude was in favor of Soviet participation."  Yugoslav
 Tanym (2nd) says that "the view widely prevails (in Algiers) that post-
 ponement of the conference has thrown a shadow over the relations be-

 that "China has experienced one of its greatest defeats on the international
 scene by failing to wreck Afro-Asian solidarity," and Kom unist (nth):
 "Chinese extremism has dealt a blow to Afro-Asian cooperation which is
 sure to have wider and manifold repercussions."
 Having the last word on the subject, a People's Daily editorial (4th)
 not only crows over the "victory" but lambastes the Soviet for their role:

 INDONESIA
 Continued from #65:  While the Soviets and their sympathizers continue
 to view with concern  developments in Indonesia, the Chinese and their
 comrades-in-arms increasingly denounce "the anti-PKI and anti-Chinese
 campaign of Indonesian reaction," -- and Soviet complicity in it!
 Again the Albanians take the lead:     NCNA (27 Oct) publicizes an AWP
 resolution of the 26th which says that "the reactionary rightist armed
 forces of Indonesia, at the instation and with the active support of
 the American imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists, have launched
 a rabid campaign against the progressive and?democratic forces of the
 fraternal Indonesian people and particularly the PKI."  A Zeri I
 pal 11it article (2nd) charges that "these provocative and crude acts
 represent composite parts of a single plan, of a premeditated manifold,
 and hostile camnainn directed against the CPR by American imperialism,
 the Khru.shchevite revisionists, and international reaction...."  It
 calls on "the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist parties, the progressive
 peoples, and all revolutionaries and honest men" to defend the CPR --
 "the impregnable fortress of the revolution, progress, and socialism"
 -- and strike a li lltnin  blow against "the imperialist-revisionist
 'Holy Alliance' which presently constitutes the greatest danger for the
 NNW     peoples' liberty and peace."  NCNA publicizes (3rd) a statement by
 New Zealand CP  Gensecy Wilcox published that date in People's Voice
 calling for  the firmest backing and support for the PKI by the1CM";
 and (on the 4th) an article from Vanguard, organ of the pro-Chinese
 Australian dissident CP (M L), including the charge:
 "True to their role as handmaidens and counterparts to
 the U.S.  imperialists, the Soviet revisionists have been busy
 trying to undermine the mi h     I....The PKI as part of its
 heroic, patriotic stand has been an unswerving opponent of
 revisionism because revisionism is the betrayal of the
 national independence of Indonesia (and every other country)...."
 ZIP again (4th) flays the Soviets with the "holy Alliance" charge
 in a new article:  "The Imperialists, the Khrushchevite Revisionists,

 NCNA publishes (5th) the text of a new Chinese Government note of
 "strongest protest" to the Indonesian Government of a new "extremely
 serious incident in which rioters organized by the Indonesian right-
 wing forces raided. the Chinese Consulate in Medan on 2 November and
 insulted China's national flag, national emblem, and leader."  The note
 says that "the rioters outrageously shouted such slogans as "Down with
 the CPR" and "Down with Mao Tse-tung," and asserts that the raid was
 carried out  at the instigation and with the support of the Medan mili-
 .tary and goVern-mental authorities."
 "The above-mentioned outrage committed by the Indonesian
 right-wing forces constituted a gross violation of accepted
 principles of international law and a rude encroachment on
 the privileges enjoyed by the Chinese Consulate and the per-
 sonal safety of its personnel.  ~t seriously affronted the
 dignity of the Chinese state, and hurt the feelings of the
 Chinese people.  It further damaged the foundation of the
 friendly relations between China and Indonesia.  It was an

 November 6-Z:  The 48th anniversary of the Soviet "October Revolution"
 is marked throughout the Communist world by the   usual meetings, speeches,
 messages and editorials.  Contrary to speculation that the event would
 be used to cover a meeting of Soviet-aligned parties in Moscow, TASS
 reporting indicates that there is high-level representation from 2nly one
 of the ruling parties, the Cuban (Raul Castro), and only four of the
 ~ftw         non-ruling parties -- Spain  Tbarruru and Santiago Carrillo), Portugal
 varo Cunhal), India (Dange) and Syria (Bakdash).  Leaders of the East
 European parties attend the rallies in theg:r own capitals -- except
 for the Rumanians Ceausescu and Maurer, who are visiting the University
 in Cluj.
 Moscow keynote speech by Dmitriy Polyansky, is devoted largely to
 Soviet domestic economic matters, is slightly sharper than other recent
 Soviet statements in defending Soviet ideological positions under attack
 by the Chinese.
 "Due to its deep inner superiority over capitalism,
 socialism does not require that the revolutionary struggle
 in any part of the world be given pushes from the outside.
 Our party has always been against exporting revolution, as
 well as exporting counter-revolution.  'Of course,' Lenin

 Pravda editorials (5th and 6th) are less specific, speaking blandly
 of the struggle for peace and the need for unity.

 962.                REVOLUTIONARY PROGRESS AND COMMUNISM
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  Communists have attempted to monopolize the term revolu-
 tionary change and to make it synonymous with their concept of progress.
 All too often they successfully appeal to the underprivileged or "have
 nots" and to those driven to create a "new world" by advocating the use
 of force or the destruction of political or socio-economic institutions
 as the only path to progressive revolutionary change.
 As a counterpart to this effort, communists attempt to pin the label
 reactionary on all free world forces (the U.S. and former colonial powers
 in particular), and thus to destroy the influence of the mature nations
 in developing areas.   They also misleadingly describe the U.S., for ex-
 ample, as supporting all policies of regimes in developing areas which do
 resist change, and apply the term status quo (or reactionary) as a symbol
 for those who reject revolutionary progress.  U.S. efforts to persuade
 foreign regimes to make needed changes are cavalierly ignored or branded
 as imperialist - neocolonialist interfering in the internal affairs of
 other countries.
 Many leaders in all sectors of society fail to recognize or prefer
 to ignore the fact that the communists call only upon non-communists coun-
 tries to carry out violent revolution.   It is all too seldom observed that
 once communists attain power over a country, the dictatorship of the "pro-
 letariat" enforces communist institutions and maintains a status quo within
 the society based on a blue print designed half a century ago and a doctrine
 enunciated (by Marx) more than a century ago.   Communist dictatorships eu-
 phemistically call upon the proletariat to "complete the revolution" -- i.e.,
 to maintain the system set down by the Party.
 Similarly, leaders in developing countries too often fail to recognize
 the revolutionary strides made by mature nations.  Domestically this has
 been accomplished by extending the fruits of economic, technological, po-
 litical, civic and cultural revolutions to ever widening sectors of the
 population (U.S., Germany, Japan) and in changing institutions through
 legal and constitutional processes.   Internationally this is seen in the
 truly revolutionary endeavors to establish international principles and

 bodies (UN and its many bodies, World Bank, OAS), in subordinating certain
 sovereign rights to collaborative activity, and in assuming responsibility
 for peace and progress for the whole world.
 Communist-style Revolution:  post World War II.  A sizable part of
 public opinion in the free world, including certain Western leaders,
 hoped during World War Two that the fight against Hitler, in which the
 Soviet Union and the Western powers were allies, would lead to a better
 understanding between Communists and the free world after Hitler and his
 axis were defeated.   This hope soon proved to have been deceptive wishful
 thinking:   the Communists even used the last phases of the war -- once the
 immediate threat of a Soviet collapse under the Nazi onslaught had been
 removed (with Western aid) -- to further their post-war aims against the
 West.
 The mutiny of the Greek fleet in exile, the establishment of the
 "National Committee Free Germany" as the base for a future German govern-
 ment and of the "Lublin Committee" as a future Polish regime, Communist
 infiltration of resistance movements, large-scale caching of arms, pro-
 vided by the West to fight Hitler, for future uprisings (notable by the
 Communist partisans in Italy), Stalin's refusal to set up a joint admin-
 istration for the occupeid enemy territories and many other developments
 revealed that the war had not at all changed the Communist grand design
 to conquer the world, including the overthrow of their war-time allies.
 Consequently, no genuine and permanent peace settlements became pos-
 sible after World War Two:   only in areas of limited strategic importance,
 such as Austria, or where the West acted alone, as in Japan, was the war
 truly liquidated.  Everywhere else, temporary arrangements were the only
 possible solution.   They involved notably
 the division of three countries into Communist and non-Communist
 portions -- Germany, Korea and (later) Vietnam;
 Western de facto (though not de jure) acquiescence in Communist
 land grabs -- such as the Baltic States, East Prussia,
 Southern Sakhalin and the Kurile islands (the latter two
 taken from Japan); and
 "temporary" border lines which have, however, already lasted 20
 years and are likely to last longer (notably the Oder-Neisse
 line, placing Silesia, Eastern Pomerania and other former
 German territories under "Polish administration pending a
 German peace treaty").
 These compromise solutions, intended to re-establish a world-wide
 balance of power after World War Two, benefited only the Communists -- ex-
 cept that they limited their expansion (they obtained only part of the
 three divided countries -- where they had wanted all of them).   The Soviet
 Union is the  o n 1 y   major belligerent of World War Two which has

 emerged with major territorial gains from the war, including vast areas
 taken from her now Communist "allies" -- such as Eastern Poland, the
 Carpatho-Ukraine taken from Czechoslovakia and Bessarabia taken from
 Rumania.   Despite these sizable gains, the Communists tried several times
 to    c h a n g e   the balance of power by force:
 Berlin blockade           -- 1948/49
 Invasion of South Korea -- 1950/53
 All these attempts, undertaken with overt military force, ended in defeats
 for the Communists.        Attempts to gain additional territory through inter-
 nal (coups) and guerrilla warfare were successful only in Czechoslovakia
 (and, at least indirectly, in Cuba), but failed in Greece, the Philippines,
 Indonesia and Malaya.
 Wherever it is to their advantage, the Communists, especially the
 leadership of the Soviet Union, have been stout defenders of agreements,
 arrived at since 1945 -- which is not surprising since they greatly bene-
 fited from them.  They keep 20 Soviet army divisions in East Germany to
 sustain the Communist regime there against an uprising of its own subjects,
 as on 17 June 1953.   They protest violently whenever the fate of Eastern
 Europe is commemorated in "Captive Nations Week."  They greatly appreciate
 De Gaulle's recognition of the Oder-Neisse Line as Poland's permanent
 border (whereas the other Western powers still maintain that the border
 between Poland and Germany can only be settled at the German peace confer-
 ence).   They make persistent efforts to improve East Germany's shaky inter-
 national status -- see, for instance, East German party leader's Ulbricht
 recent state visit to Egypt, which was brought about when CPSU Presidium
 member and former KGB chief Shelepin "induced" Nasser -- badly in need of
 more Soviet military and economic aid -- to extend an invitation.   In these
 places they support the status quo.
 CPR-USSR Revolutionar  Strategy Conflict.  The open declaration of
 Chinese People's Republic (CPR) policy in the Lin Piao statement of
 27
 September 1965 (see BPG #175) and in Chen Yi's vitriolic statements
 to
 journalists in Peking in a four-hour interview at the end of September,
 spell out the doctrine of revolutionary change by violence which they
 have practiced for years.   CPR strategy conflicts sharply with that of
 the USSR which is more subtle:   it is based on retaining what they have
 gained on the one hand (status quo); and on the other, by destructively
 subverting free countries -- e.g., generally through "national wars of
 liberation" in Africa, and popular front tactics in Latin America.   The
 CPR upset the Soviet strategy and timetable by its open aggression in
 Asia.   So the USSR has conveniently "forgotten" about the Geneva agreement
 in which Vietnam was divided (because this turned out to be the only way
 in which overt warfare between Communists and the free world could be
 brought to an end).   The communists, including the Soviets, not only pour
 men, arms supplies and political support from North Vietnam into free South

 Vietnam, but they denounce the U.S., assisting the government of
 South Vietnam in defending its territory, as "imperialist aggressor,"
 "warmonger" and general villain.  Moreover, these Communist accusations
 are widely echoed by non-Communist critics of U.S. action in Vietnam
 (or of U.S. policies generally) -- by neutralists, pacifists, De Gaulle's
 propaganda machine, etc. -- with no reference to the international context
 which we outlined above.
 U.S. Reaction to Communist Double Standards.   Efforts of the free
 world and the U.S. in particular, to stabilize international relations
 by agreement while working for change and progress within the rule of law
 and through international diplomatic negotiation, have been increasingly
 difficult..   Communist parties to agreements persist in using a double
 standard:   they abide by agreements to stabilize the situation when it
 appears to their advantage -- e.g., Germany, East European boundaries,
 and Laos (at least verbally for the moment); they abrogate agreements
 which no longer serve their Purposes by armed aggression, support for in-
 ternal uprisings, and other destructive activities.  The result has been
 that the U.S. has had to use force, where Communists have applied the
 sharp side of their double standard and sought to take territory by armed
 aggression.

 963.           COMMUNIST CHINA:  Totalitarian Militarism,
 Its Nature and Its Goals
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  Communist China today is the most thoroughly militarized
 nation in the world -- not only does she have a standing army of close to
 2.5 million and vast Chinese reserves readily available to double and
 treble that number, she has in addition the greatest militia force ever
 claimed by any nation (best minimal estimate, 20,000,000).
 Militaristic indoctrination runs throughout the entire structure of
 Chinese Communist society where student and youth groups, professional
 people, commune workers, women's leagues -- in fact, every layer of her
 bustling life, is daily being thoroughly steeped in militant Communist
 ideology.  And at the apex of this massive ideological base stands Mao
 Tse-tung surrounded by a Central Committee and a Presidium both boasting
 more professional military men as members than any Communist structure in
 the world -- including that of the USSR.
 Over three decades ago, in the early days of the Revolution Mao made
 the statement that "in China,war is the main force of struggle."  Mao still
 rules China with this philosophy in the nuclear age.   The crux of his mili-
 tary philosophy rests today - as it did in the days of the Revolution - on
 the "mass line" strategy despite the technological advances in the methods
 mankind now has available for waging war.
 In considering war as it is fought today Mao does actually calculate
 that his armies may have to battle superior military forces, but he care-
 fully sets up specific conditions for his battles:   first, the-Chinese
 people, military and civilians alike, must be thoroughly indoctrinated
 ideologically and must be taught a rabid hatred for the enemy;  second,
 Approved For Release 1999/09/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061AO00300050005-0
 (963 Cont.)
 Approved For Release 1999/09/17 MMM-03061A000300050005-0
 superior intelligence and propaganda mechanisms must be developed under
 party and military control; and third, physical conditions must exist to
 permit Chinese forces to employ encircling, surprise attacks against the
 enemy.   Daily intelligence on the enemy's movements and regular supplies
 will be furnished for Mao's forces by the Chinese civilians -- an actively
 mobilized and organized force.
 In the gospel according to Mao, when these factors are functioning
 properly, the vast numbers of the Chinese fighting force, the skill of
 their ambushes and the strategy of their retreats will prolong the war
 to the point where the enemy's morale and resolve are so weakened and
 his supply lines are so overextended that Chinese Communist forces will
 wit through to victory.
 Mao's military doctrine was effective in the days of the Revolution
 and guerrilla armies but there are numerous indications that his former
 comrades-in-arms, China's professional military men, are protesting Mao's
 persistence in clinging to the military tactics of Revolutionary days in
 the face of the brutal realities of present day battle conditions.  Mao
 has actually met with setbacks and even some direct challenges from his
 military leaders because of his attempts to inject party influence into
 the People's Liberation Army (PLA), China's mighty ground forces.
 A review of the past 15 years makes it appear possible, in fact,
 that Chinese military men have become professional soldiers first and
 CCP apologists last.  Attached is an unclassified outline of what may
 chronicle a running battle between major factions warring within the
 PLA:   the practical professional soldiers versus the hidebound profes-
 sional party men.

 964.     2511t1dft XODUS IS SYMBOL OF REGIME'S BANKRUPTCY
 SITUATION: In a speech delivered in Havana on 28 September 1965,
 Fidel Castro said that persons with relatives in the United States could
 leave Cuba.     On 30 September, he offered to permit any persons who so
 desired to leave Cuba.   Four days later, on 3 October 1965, President
 Johnson stated that the United States would welcome any Cubans who
 desired to go there.   After several weeks of negotiations, via the inter-
 mediary of the Swiss Ambassador to Cuba, an agreement was reached between
 the United States and Cuba providing for the transfer of 4,000 Cubans per
 month from Cuba to the U.S.A. by chartered airplanes.   In principle, this
 exodus will continue until those who desire to have left.   However,
 despite the categorical nature of his early statements, Castro has now
 excluded young men of military age between 15 and 26, technicians, pro-
 fessional persons, and political prisoners.
 The Cuban exiles already in the United States have submitted the
 names of some 150,000 relatives who are presently in Cuba; however it is
 not known how many of these will actually leave.
 According to the International Rescue Committee, to date from
 300,000 to 400,000 Cubans have left their homeland.   Even the smaller
 figure represents 4+.1% of Cuba's population of about 7,203,000.   If an
 additional 200,000 manage to leave, this would mean a total of T%.-of the
 population.   Compare with the approximately 14+% who left East Germany
 from 19+6 to the present time.
 Departing Cuba is not without risk or without loss.   To leave via
 chartered plane, the Cuban will henceforth have to file application with
 the government.   He must then wait until the government notifies him
 that his turn has come.   In the interim, perhaps a period of a year or
 more, he must face the entire array of a hostile Communist government on
 which he must depend for everything from food rations to medicine for
 his children.   His possessions immediately inventoried, and then reinven-
 toried when he leaves to ensure that he has not sold anything and hidden
 the money.  When he is finally permitted to depart he may take only what
 he can fit in a suitcase; everything else -- car, house, furniture,
 clothes, works of art, everything -- is then confiscated by the Cuban
 government.
 It is not possible to estimate the total number of refugees who will
 leave Cuba, or the length of time over which their departure will take
 place.   It could be speculated, however, that a departure rate of 4,000 a
 month would mean an average of 133 people leaving per day.   If a total of
 50,000 people were to leave, this exodus could then take twelve and a half
 months.   If a total of 200,000 were to leave, the operation could last
 over four years.

 SITUATION:   Housing continues to be one of the glaringly inadequate
 sectors of the Soviet economy.   CPSU leaders have bragged for years that
 they would "catch up" with Western Europe in housing standards -- as they
 have said repeatedly that they would catch up with the United States in
 the supply of meats, dairy products and other food commodities, only to
 suffer continued agricultural failures.
 Their current seven-year plan (1959-1965) is far short of its goal
 of 887 million square meters (sq m) of dwelling space, and the quality
 of the new structures is generally poor.   In only one year has this plan
 for housing been fulfilled; since 1960 the construction of new housing
 space has actually fallen off, and the total area of housing is lower
 now than that achieved in 1959.  While the overall plan has been only
 76.4% fulfilled the portion for collective farmers and rural intelli-
 gentsia (e.g., professionals, teachers) has been only half completed.
 USSR minimum health and decency standards call for 9 sq m of living
 space (i.e., living, dining and bedrooms) within 13.5 sq m of total space
 (includes kitchen and bathroom) per person.   The construction achieved
 by the end of 196+ falls short of this standard by 4.9 sq m of total
 space.   Nine times the construction of urban-type housing attained in
 196+ will have to be built in the urban and state sector of rural housing
 to reach this goal -- or an additional 673 million sq m.   If this popula-
 tion continues to grow by approximately 3 million persons per year, and
 approximately 2% of the housing stock is retired from service each year,
 then almost 50 million sq m of urban-type housing must be built each year
 just to maintain the level of 8.6 sq m of total space per capita now at-
 tained.
 Actual Soviet housing of 8 to 9 sq m of total space per capita is
 very low compared with amounts achieved in the West -- approximately 20
 sq m in Western Europe and 30 sq m in the United States.   It is very doubt-
 ful that the Soviet Union's own goal of 13.5 sq m total housing space per
 person can be attained by 1970.   But achievement of the goal by 1980, which
 would require average annual. completions to increase by 5% per year, is not
 an unreasonable task.

 The goal of 887 million sq m may have been estimated on the previous
 performance rate in individual housing which accounted for about one half
 of the total area of housing constructed in the 1956-1959 period.   But
 individual housing has been curtailed in the last seven years by numerous
 factors:   failure to make land available or to provide utilities to the
 land made available:   lack of construction materials; restriction on
 credit; and confiscation of individual houses already built.  While indi-
 vidual housing -- which the Soviet people clearly desire -- may be stimu-
 lated by relaxing restrictive policies, on financing for example, this is
 not likely to occur in urban areas.   Control of housing construction in
 the USSR is strictly a political decision:   individual housing creates an
 urban sprawl requiring vastly larger public expenditures for utilities
 (e.g., transportation, power, sewers, fuel) than do apartment buildings;
 the Party is not likely to accommodate its people at this expense.
 Investment.  During the seven-year period, investment for housing
 construction has been declining in importance.   In 1958 housing construc-
 tion received 25% of Soviet investment; in 1963, only 18% and the estimate
 for 1964 and 1965 appeared even lower.  The decrease in the sector of indi-
 vidual housing is even greater:   1964 investment was approximately half of
 that for 1959.   Thus, in the field of shifting priorities in the Soviet
 economy, the so-called productive investment (e.g., industry, agriculture)
 took precedence over investment in housing.   The Brezhnev-Kosygin adminis-
 tration, which has posed as the friend of the consumer, allocates first
 priority to defense and to industry, clearly preventing any immediate jump
 in consumer standards, particularly for housing.
 Housing construction cooperatives are formed by groups of individuals
 each of whom furnishes the cost of constructing his apartment.  Usual prac-
 tice has been for the individual to provide 40% of the estimated cost of
 his apartment from his own funds and borrow the balance to be paid back in
 10 to 15 years.   The apartments are built by the state -- using the same
 plans, the same construction forces and materials and the same supervising
 organizations as state financed buildings.   Only the financing differs.
 The incentive for joining a construction cooperative is simply that the
 person moves to the front of the long queue of applicants for housing.
 The incentive for the government in organizing cooperatives is that it
 avoids adverse publicity for an overt price increase for housing and raises
 the price for housing greatly.  The down payment (even if the percentage
 should be reduced to the 27-30% advocated by some) equals or exceeds the an-
 nual wage of the average worker, and his monthly payment (even for the longer
 25 year period suggested by some) is at least two to three times the rental
 paid for state housing.   Cooperative apartments contributed insignificant
 amounts to housing construction in 1960 but rose to some 4.8 million sq m in
 1964.   It accounted for some 2% of the total 7-year construction total. Bank
 officials hope that more liberal financing will increase this up to 50% in
 coming years.

 Quality.   The defects long noted in products sent abroad plague
 the housing industry in the Soviet Union.   The Soviet press continually
 exhorts builders to improve quality.   For example, houses which have
 been built remain unoccupied because there are no water, sewer, elec-
 trical, heating or transportation facilities.                                In one city, of 115 build-
 ings put into service, 108 had serious defects.                           Concrete and mortar'fre-
 quently contain dirt and other foreign matter; forms used are irregular
 in shape; joint designs and sealing materials are poor so that wind and

 walls, are weak, irregular in form and subject to frost damage; and lum-
 ber is often uncured and warps or shrinks.                                    25X1 C 1 Ob

 Communist China's PLA
 Chronology of Policy Controversy
 1950 -- 1965
 Prior to the
 Korean War:             Communist China still had a revolutionary volun-
 teer force composed of those elements of the PLA
 which eventually drove the armies of Chiang-Kai-
 shek from the Chinese mainland in 1949.
 1950-195+:              With essentially the same volunteer revolutionary
 force, the Chinese Communists entered the Korean War
 in November of 1950 and were initially successful in
 capitalizing on the element of surprise and the use
 of the "human wave" tactic.   However, the superior
 firepower of the UN forces combined with the PLA's
 overwhelming supply problems proved insurmountable
 obstacles to Communist victory.
 195+:
 195+ - mid
 1960:
 The Chinese made efforts after the Korean War to con-
 vert their forces to a regular military establishment.
 Internally, then Defense Minister Peng Te-huai intro-
 duced one clear sign of professionalism:   ranks with
 differential pay scales.
 Externally, the Chinese Communists obtained Soviet
 support for the modernization of the PLA which was
 modeled along Soviet World War II lines.
 Date of the Sino-Soviet pact under which Moscow agreed
 to assist Peking in nuclear and advanced weapons de-
 velopment.
 1957-1959:                  Signs that differences of opinion were growing among
 CCP leaders centering about the Great Leap Forward:
 some of the top military men in the PLA begged that
 concessions be made to Soviet objections regarding
 the impracticality of the Leap in order to keep the
 flow of Soviet assistance moving to the developing
 Chinese military forces.
 1958:
 A marathon May to July conference of top Chinese Com-
 munist military leaders took place during which some
 officers pushed hard for wiping out party leadership
 in the PLA.

 October 1958:           The officer corps was reshuffled to bring into more
 prominence politically reliable military men;  the
 Chief of the General Staff (General Su Yu) was re-
 placed by a General (Huang Ko-cheng) whose aim it
 was to underline the claim that the party was in con-
 trol of the PLA.
 1960:
 1961:
 A suspected confrontation between MAO and Defense Min-
 ister Peng Te-huai when Peng attempted to "regularize"
 the armed forces by emphasizing professionalism in the
 officer corps and eliminating party considerations.
 This resulted in Peng's (one of Mao's revolution com-
 rades), dismissal.  A number of his supporters, in-
 cluding the then Chief of Staff (Huang Ko-cheng) were
 also thrown out at the same time in what was described
 in a Chinese army bulletin as "a purge of rotten ele-
 ments. "
 The Soviets withdrew most of their support from the
 Chinese Communists in the weapons, nuclear and in-
 dustrial development areas as well as training, and
 direct military aid.   This was the culmination of the
 "Great Leap Forward" debate and the temporary cessation
 of modernization of the PLA.
 The "purge of rotten elements" from the PLA leadership
 was completed presumably leaving only party-oriented
 military leaders in command.
 October 1963:           Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi stated that China
 would have to manufacture nuclear weapons, missiles
 and supersonic aircraft or degenerate into a third-
 class nation.
 196+:
 During this year Chinese leaders admitted that their
 program to develop an atomic bomb had been a severe
 strain on the economy.  At the same time, Mao's con-
 cept of the spiritual atom bomb was being widely
 touted for general consumption as was the alleged
 superiority of man over weapons.
 Early 1965:             Reports made to the National People's Congress indicated
 that elements of the PLA leadership were still unhappy
 ove  the loss of Soviet military assistance and felt
 that party policy towards the Soviet Union should com-
 promise sufficiently to heal the breach.

 1 June 1965:            An order was given abolishing all formal military
 ranks in the PLA because, according to Peking, it
 was "necessary to make the army more proletarian
 and militant."  All insignia to be removed from
 uniforms.   It has been speculated that this order
 was accompanied by a 50% cut in pay for officers.
 Mid-July 1965:          Peking announced that it would intensify the already
 heavy level of political indoctrination given to of-
 ficers above the regimental level.
 1 August 1965:          An article by Marshal Ho Lung, Mao's old comrade and
 Politburo member, admitted that the PLA had displayed
 "stubborn bourgeois opposition" to Mao's military
 ideas and that the CCP had been forced to deal with
 this situation "again and again."  The article simul-
 taneously appeared in the Red Flag, the Liberation
 Army Daily and the People's Daily.

 The " People's Daily' article
 provides  an   altogether  new
 insight into' the  abolition of
 ranks in the Chinese Army at,
 the beginning of this month. , At-
 first, ' official                        Peking  commen-
 taries represented the reform as
 no more than a return to the'"
 best revolutionary traditions.
 The only implied criticism of
 the  officer   corps   that the
 " Liberation   Army          D a i l y"
 allowed itself in announcing the
 abolition of ranks was'to say that
 they had contributed to rank con-.
 sciousness and the craving for
 fame and wealth.
 Unhealthy trends
 Now, however, the "People's
 Daily" has given the additional
 explanation that, since democracy
 means  equality  between    the
 soldiers and the cadres, " every
 revolutionary  soldier has  the
 right  to  oppose  any  actions
 which run counter to the party's
 policy,   and   any   unhealthy
 trends."  Both in training and in
 action, " the men are expected
 to discuss the ways and means of
 putting the plans into practice."
 In battle conditions, " the men
 have full discussions on how to
 take the enemy position and how
 to accomplish their combat mis-
 sion."  When the battle is over,
 " they are expected to comment
 on the battle, the command,, the   views that were shaped  inc eaa-

 These were not published in
 the open press, but a commen-,

 their chief purpose was to give
 effect to Mao's " principle " on
 army-party relations.  This was,
 it said, " to  place  the armed'
 forces under the party's com-
 mand,  and  not                                                                                                to  allow  the:

 that officers and political com-

 as unit leaders, which would pro-

 While important problems in

 Communist China has warned
 that "the 650 million Chinese people
 will definitely not stand idly by" in

 age of 18 before June 30 are eligible
 for the draft that year. Until re-

 January 1965 session, the National
 People's Congress lengthened each

 Housing Problems in the USSR*
 Summary and Conclusions
 Housing continues to be one of the glaringly inadequate sectors of
 the Soviet economy.       In only one year of the current seven-year plan
 (1959-65) has the plan for housing been fulfilled, and since 1960 the
 construction of new housing space has actually fallen off.  As for qual-
 ity, slapdash methods of construction, monotony of architecture and
 design, and lack of adequate water, gas, and other utilities character-
 ize Soviet housing now, as they did at the beginning of the plan period.
 The recent emphasis placed on building cooperative apartments has meant
 little for the general supply of housing, but rather has enabled the
 regime to increase greatly the price of part of the housing stock with-
 out increasing rents.   Moreover, the building of private houses -- once
 a bright spot in the Soviet housing picture -- has shrunk because of
 official discouragement.
 The failure of Soviet construction of urban-type housing to expand
 or even to meet plans during the seven-year plan period is shown in the
 following tabulation (in million square meters):

 Even in the unlikely event that the 1965 plan is fulfilled, results under
 the seven-year plan, which called for the construction of 650 million to
 660 million square meters (sq m) of urban-type housing space, will fall
 short by about 15 percent.   Furthermore, the separate goal of 7 million
 new houses to be built by collective farmers during the plan period will
 be met only halfway.

 Housing problems in the USSR are part and parcel of the low priority
 assigned to the consumer in the allocation of economic resources.   The
 magnitude of the housing problem is comparable to the magnitude of the
 agricultural problem, although there has been less public attention
 given to housing.  Even if the 1959-64 rate of housing construction were
 doubled in the next five-year plan period (1966-70), the Soviet consumer
 would have slightly less than the 9 sq m of per capita living space rec-
 ognized by the USSR itself as the minimum requirement for health and
 decency.   (The average per capita living space at the present time is
 only 5.7 sq m, about the same as at the start of the seven-year plan
 period.)   "Catching up" with Western Europe in housing, let alone with
 that in the United States, seems an impossible task for the next few
 years.   The Brezhnev-Kosygin administration has posed as the friend of
 the consumer, but its allocation of first priority to defense and to
 industry clearly prevents any immediate Jump in consumer standards -- and
 this is particularly true for housing.
 Housing Plans and Completion
 It is evident from even a superficial examination of the Soviet
 economy that housing is still an unsolved problem in the Soviet Union.
 Instead of the 887 million sq m of total space of housing that was planned
 to be constructed in the USSR during the seven-year plan period, only 678
 million square meters (sq m), or about three-fourths, will be built.   (See

 Published statistics on the area of urban-type housing planned and
 the area built reveal that, for the seven-year plan period, only in the
 first year (1959), have housing completions equaled the plan.   In 1964
 the plan for urban-type housing was 15 percent lower than the plan for
 1963 and 3 percent lower than actual completions in 1963, but it was still
 underfulfilled by more than 3 percent.   Even if completions in 1965 equal
 the plan, total completions of urban-type housing during the seven-year
 plan period will be 87.9 million to 97.9 million sq m short of the goal
 of 650 million to 660 million sq m.   Construction of urban-type housing,
 therefore, lags more than a year, or about 15 percent below the goal
 established by the plan.
 In addition to urban-type housing, the seven-year plan indicates
 that collective farmers and the rural intelligentsia were to build approx-
 imately 7 million houses, or an estimated 233 million sq m of housing.
 This part of the plan will be fulfilled approximately 50 percent.
 In presenting the 1965 plan, Premier Kosygin stated that the area
 of urban-type housing to be commissioned in 1965 (84 million sq m) would
 be the greatest amount ever achieved in the Soviet Union.  Although the
 statement is literally true, the 1965 plan for the total area of housing
 is lower by about 12 million sq m than the total amount built in 1959.
 Individual and State Housing
 In the last few years individual housing has been curtailed by
 numerous factors:   failure to make land available, failure to provide
 utilities to the land that is made available, lack of construction
 materials, restriction on credit, and confiscation of individual houses
 already built.   Recent events suggest a relaxing of this restrictive
 policy.   In an article in Izvestiya, Dmitriy S. Pudikov, chief of the
 long-term credit department of the Construction Bank of the USSR and
 author of a number of articles on private and cooperative housing, urged
 all-out support for building private homes.
 Although experience indicates that the Soviet people desire individ-
 ual houses and will build private houses if land, materials, and credit
 are made available, this solution of the housing problem has serious eco-
 nomic as well as ideological shortcomings.   These ideological faults may
 be temporarily ignored on the basis of expediency.   Further expansion of
 "urban sprawl," however, promoted by encouraging individual housing,
 requires huge expenditures for public utilities -- transportation, water,
 sewer, fuel, and power lines.   Supplying these services to new areas of
 apartment housing requires expenditure of considerable construction effort
 and resources.   Supplying the same services to areas of single-family
 dwellings increases the cost significantly.

 Limitation of individual houses in large urban areas is inevitable.
 In a market economy the limitation is affected by changes in the price
 of land.   Even in a market economy, however, the existence of zoning
 restrictions and similar "political" decisions strongly influences use
 of land. In the USSR, lack of economically determined prices for land
 forces all decisions on use of land into the political arena.
 Although recent efforts to encourage construction of housing by
 individuals may help to solve housing problems in the smaller urban and
 rural areas, solution of the major housing problem, that of large urban
 areas, will continue to depend primarily on construction of housing by
 the state or by housing construction cooperatives.
 Housing Construction Cooperatives
 A housing construction cooperative is formed by a group of individ-
 uals, each of whom furnishes the cost of constructing an apartment in a
 multiapartment house.   Usually the individual furnishes 40 percent of the
 estimated cost of the apartment from his own funds and borrows the balance
 to be paid back over a period of 10 to 15 years.   Except for source of
 financing, housing built by cooperatives and housing built by the state
 are identical.   Both types use the same plans, the same materials, and the
 same construction organizations, and are supervised by the same state
 organizations.   The incentive of the individual for joining a cooperative
 is that he moves to the front of the long housing queue.   The incentive
 of the government for sponsoring cooperatives is that the price of housing
 is greatly raised for those willing to pay the price, but without the
 adverse publicity of an overt price increase.
 Although housing cooperatives constructed only 2 percent of all
 housing built in the USSR during the seven-year plan period, they are
 receiving increasing attention from Soviet authorities.   Cooperative
 housing construction rose from insignificant amounts in 1960 to 1.8 mil-
 lion sq m in 1964, more than 5 percent of total housing commissioned.   The
 1965 plan provides for 7.5 million sq in, or almost 8 percent of all hous-
 ing, to come from this source.   Officials of the Moscow office of the Con-
 struction Bank assert that if conditions of financing housing cooperatives
 were liberalized for the USSR as a whole, the share of housing built by
 cooperatives would increase to at least 50 percent.
 Although this overly optimistic view of housing cooperatives probably
 will not be fully realized in the next several years,* measures have
 Even the reduced down payments suggested are equal to or exceed a
 year's wages for the average worker.   The monthly payment -- even
 for a 25-year loan -- is at least two to three times the rental
 paid for state housing.   If rent of state housing were raised to a
 level more nearly covering cost, the added cost of going to the head
 of the queue would be reduced, but then more people would try.

 been taken to make construction of cooperatives more attractive to the
 population.   The Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a decree on
 19 November 1964 which stipulated that (1) land allocations for housing
 cooperatives should be speeded up; (2) housing cooperatives would be
 relieved of the expense of razing old structures and of reimbursing pri-
 vate individuals for crops on allocated land; (3) occupancy of coopera-
 tive housing was restricted to members and their families; (4) cost of
 cooperative housing construction should be calculated with respect to
 prices, norms, and procedures established for state housing; (5) as of
 1 January 1965, interest charges would be reduced from 1 percent to 0.5
 percent; (6) in parts of Asiatic USSR, the down payment was to be reduced
 from 40 percent to 30 percent and the time for repayment extended. from 10
 to 20 years; and (7) improved finishing and more complete installations
 in the residential buildings might be permitted if paid for by the mem-
 bers of a housing cooperative.
 Although the main incentive for individuals to join housing coopera-
 tives is to get needed housing space more quickly, a secondary incentive
 is the possibility of benefiting from slightly more flexible design and
 better finish and equipment.   The conflict between quantity and quality
 of housing and the difficulty of departing from standard design are illus-
 trated by the following quotation from a Soviet article on housing:
 Cooperative housing is now being built according to estimated
 costs of state construction, is fully provided with building materi-
 als, and is included in the plan for contract work on a par with
 state construction.   By paying extra, the cooperatives may build
 houses with higher ceilings, so long as this does not conflict with
 standard plans and does not require retooling of the housing-
 structurals plants, and with higher quality finish in the apartments
 and improved sanitary and technical equipment.
 Housing Space Per Capita
 In urban areas of the USSR the minimum health and decency goal is 9
 sq m of living space of 13.5 sq m of total space per person -- at least
 4.9 sq m more total space than achieved by the end of 1964.*  Therefore,
 an addition of 673 million sq m, or 9 times the construction of urban-
 type housing in 1964, must be added to urban and state sector rural
 housing to meet the per capita space goals for the present urban and
 state sector rural population.   On the assumption that the urban and
 state-related rural population will continue to grow by approximately
 3 million persons per year and that approximately 2 percent of the hous-
 ing stock will be retired from service each year, almost 50 million sq m
 of urban-type housing must be built each year just to maintain the pres-
 ent level of 8.6 sq m of total space per capita.
 Living space means living, dining and bedrooms.   Total space includes
 in addition, kitchens and bathrooms.

 Attainment of the Soviet Union's goal of 13.5 sq m of housing per
 person by 1970 is very doubtful because it would require doubling the
 volume of construction achieved in the past six years.  Achievement of
 the goal by 1980, however, would require average annual completions to
 increase by only 5 percent per year, a not unreasonable task.
 Actual Soviet housing of 8 to 9 sq m of total space per capita is
 very low compared with the amounts achieved in the West -- approximately
 20 sq m in Western Europe and 30 sq m in the United States.   "Catching
 up" with Western Europe in housing, let alone the US, seems an impos-
 sible task for the next several years.
 Quality of Housing Construction
 The Soviet Union has consistently sacrificed quality for quantity
 in housing.   The immediate problem has been to get the populace housed
 in some sort of minimum comfort.   Thus, by Western standards, the quali-
 ty of housing has been extremely poor.   Soviet leaders and journalists
 recognize the poor quality and report, for example, that in one city, of
 115 buildings put into service, 108 had imperfections and serious defects.
 The Soviet press is continually exhorting builders to improve quality.
 In the rush to produce and to put into use additional housing space,
 there is lack of quality control and inspection.  Many houses are occupied
 without certification by the state commission even though they have a
 large number of serious defects and imperfections.   For example, in Irkutsk,
 apartment buildings were put into use with no electric illumination and
 with unworkable heating systems.
 The quality of materials leaves much to be desired,   The sand and
 gravel used for producing concrete and mortar frequently contain dirt
 and other foreign matter that degrade the quality of the concrete pro-
 duced.   The forms used for concrete panels are poorly dimensioned and
 poorly maintained; the result is concrete panels that are irregular in
 shape and have poor surfaces.   Because joint designs and sealing materi-
 als have not been developed properly, in many buildings the joints between
 panels are open, allowing penetration of both wind and moisture.   Brick is
 still the predominant material used for walls, but most of the brick pro-
 duced is weak, irregular in form, cracked, and prone to frost damage.
 The mortar used to join the bricks is poor and little care is taken in
 controlling the quality and proportions of water, cement, and sand.   Lum-
 ber is often uncured and thus causes warping and shrinking of floors,
 window frames, and other wooden parts.
 Lack of permanent cadres of skilled workers, resulting from high labor
 turnover, and use of unskilled volunteer workers contribute to the low
 quality of housing, especially noticeable in the finishing work.   In addi-
 tion, little use is made of instruments to insure that buildings are level
 and plumb when erected.

 Failure to Provide Services
 Throughout the USSR there are examples of housing that has been
 built but has not been occupied, because of failure to supply water,
 sewer, electrical, heating and transportation facilities.   In addition,
 there are numerous complaints of failure to provide such services as
 schools, shops, and recreation facilities in or near new housing areas.
 The failure to coordinate the construction of housing and the supply of
 services has been a major annoyance for a long time, and the end is not
 in sight.
 The administration of the housing economy is antiquated, not having
 been reviewed for 35 years.   Responsibility and funds are dispersed among
 numerous ministries and departments.   Finances that could be allocated
 for building repair are spent on a multitude of people engaged mainly in
 clerical work.   Thousands of buildings have not been repaired in time.
 In general, the tenant does little to alleviate the problem of mainte-
 nance, because of lack of incentive and because of the difficulty of
 obtaining the necessary materials for making repairs.
 Investment in Housing
 During the seven-year plan period the USSR will invest more than 55
 billion rubles in housing.   Total annual investment in housing has declined
 somewhat during 1959-64+, with 196+ investment approximately 88 percent of
 1959 investment.  An estimate of the capital investment required to fulfill
 the 1965 plan for housing is about 98 percent of the 1959 investment.
 The composition of the total investment in housing has changed sig-
 nificantly during the period.                                   In 1959, 37 percent of the total housing
 investment was for individual housing -- urban and rural, including houses
 built by collective farmers -- but in 196+ the share for this category
 dropped to about 22 percent and is expected to be somewhat less in 1965.
 Investment in individual housing steadily decreased until by 196+ it was
 about one-half that of 1959; small increases in investment by the state
 sector together with investment in housing cooperatives have maintained
 total investment at relatively constant absolute levels.
 During the seven-year plan period, however, housing construction has
 been declining in importance as a recipient of investment funds.   In 1958,
 25 percent of all investment in the USSR was devoted to housing construc-
 tion, but by 1963, the share of total investment used for housing con-
 struction had declined to 18 percent.   The estimate for 196+ and 1965 is
 even lower.   The decline in housing construction reflects shifting pri-
 orities in Soviet resource allocation.   Increasingly priority has been
 given to the so-called productive investment in industry and agriculture
 over nonproductive investment in housing for acquiring relatively scarce
 building materials.
 During both the fourth and fifth five-year plan periods (19+6-50 and
 1951-55, respectively), about 20 percent of all investment in the USSR

 Approved For Release 1999/09/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300050005-0
 was devoted to housing construction.   If during the coming years a similar
 share of total investment were to be used for housing construction, the
 per capita goal of 13.5 sq m of total housing space could be reached dur-
 ing 1971-80.
 The USSR is devoting a smaller share of capital investment to hous-
 ing than is the US.   During the period 1960-63 in the USSR, about 20 per-
 cent of total capital investment went to housing, compared to 24 percent
 in the US.  A comparison of the share of total construction activity
 devoted to housing in each country also indicates: that the USSR is devot-
 ing a smaller share than is the US -- 32 percent in the USSR and 40 per-
 cent in the US.
 If the USSR were to reassess its objectives and allocate capital
 investment and construction resources to housing to the same degree as
 the US, the volume of housing available to the Soviet people would meet
 their present goal in the 1970's.  At the present time, however, although
 Kosygin has indicated that the next five-year plan should be designed to
 "insure a more rapid rate of improvement of the people's living standards,"
 there is no firm indication that housing in the USSR is going to receive
 this relatively greater share of investment in the near future.
