PREFACE 
Intelligence is an indispensable element in the successful operation of any 
modern navy. 
World War II and the subsequent hostilities in Korea have more than 
demonstrated the value to planning and executing naval operations of sound, 
properly interpreted information about the character of the enemy?the product 
of naval intelligence. This value is even greater in periods of peace or in the 
twilight zone between war and peace such as we have experienced since the end 
of World War II. The extent, direction, and timing of our naval preparedness 
in these years depend directly on the depth and accuracy of our understanding 
of the hostile or potentially hostile forces that confront us. 
Accordingly the training of capable intelligence officers is one of the Navy's 
primary tasks. A good intelligence officer must first be a good naval officer; 
but, in addition, he must have spent long hours learning and perfecting the 
specialized skills that make it possible for him to penetrate the curtain of 
secrecy that enshrouds an enemy. Naturally these skills cannot be acquired 
simply by reading this or any other single book. At the postgraduate level the 
Navy trains its intelligence officers at the Naval Intelligence School. 
This text, which covers in a general way the major aspects of naval intelli-
gence and their relationships to the other functions of our naval establishment, 
meets two significant needs. First, for those officers assigned to intelligence 
duties for the first time, or with prior experience in one or another of the various 
components of naval intelligence, it provides a greater understanding of intelli-
gence as a whole. Second, to the general line officer preparing himself for more 
responsible operational commands, it gives an intimate acquaintance with the 
capabilities and limitations of one of the most important supporting elements 
in successful operational command, with the result that he will find himself 
better equipped to make use of the services which intelligence is qualified to 
perform for him. 
This text makes no claim to being an exhaustive treatise. Neither is it 
a book of rules and regulations, since that particular need is covered by the 
Naval Intelligence Manual and the Naval Intelligence Directives issued by the 
Office of Naval Intelligence. This is a textbook issued by the Standards and 
Curriculum Branch of the Training Division of the Bureau of Naval Personnel 
to bring to the officers and men of the Navy and the Naval Reserve such infor-
mation about the functions of Naval Intelligence as can appropriately be 
disseminated through the medium of a training text. 
This is the second revision of the original text, NavPers 16047, published 
in February 1946 and reissued in 1948. It was prepared by the staff of the 
United States Naval School (Naval Intelligence), Washington, D. C., and 
reviewed by the Office of Naval Intelligence. 
Suggestions, comments and criticisms are invited.

CHAPTER 1 
INTELLIGENCE: A GENERAL ORIENTATION 
INTRODUCTION 
The word "intelligence" has a long history in 
the English language. In the sixteenth century, 
in addition to its primary meanings denoting the 
power, capacity, and product of the intellect, it 
began to signify "information, news, or advice," 
and this secondary meaning implied that such in-
formation was secret, obtained through the clan-
destine efforts of spies employed by rulers or gov-
ernments. These agents were called intelligen-
cers, a word now obsolete, and the organization 
in which they operated came to be known as the 
Intelligence of the directing authority. In mod-
ern professional usage the word in its secondary 
sense has come to have three connotations: first, 
a body of knowledge; second, the formal organi-
zations engaged in producing this knowledge; and 
third, the activity or processes by which the knowl-
edge is produced by the organizations. When re-
ferring to a formal organization the word is 
usually capitalized. 
The popular concept of intelligence as a mys-
terious, glamorous, and hazardous activity has in 
part been derived from fictional accounts of in-
ternational intrigue on the Riviera, as described 
in the novels of E. Phillips Oppenheim, or from 
the published "cloak and dagger" exploits of two 
World Wars, both truth and fiction. Indeed, in-
telligence cannot be denuded of all mystery, 
glamor, and hazard for they are inherent to some 
degree in the work of all intelligence organiza-
tions. However, the aura of mystery is caused 
in greater part by the fact that the nature and 
purpose of intelligence activity are always 
guarded from public scrutiny by stringent se-
curity measures. In general, Intelligence is sim-
ilar to any other military staff section or govern-
mental agency performing tasks in the national 
interest. 
Because of the essential security of its opera-
tions, and the somewhat sinister quality attributed 
to it by popular literature, intelligence has long 
26910e-54 2 
1 
been considered an activity foreign to American 
custom and procedure. Not until World War II 
was there a real national interest in intelligence 
and a universal appreciation of its functions in 
military command and civil leadership. Even in 
the postwar period there has not always been com-
plete general agreement as to what intelligence 
means and what it can or should do. When prop-
erly forged, intelligence is a potent weapon, and 
its efficient use is based on certain indispensable 
principles and procedures. It is an exciting ad-
venture in forecasting what men and nations might 
do; in both offensive and defensive actions it is a 
sword and a shield. 
Under the stimulus of world events, America 
has become "intelligence-conscious," for experi-
ences of the past two decades have demonstrated 
that intelligence is essential, not only to military 
command, but also to the government of any na-
tion with worldwide interests and responsibilities. 
The phenomenal success of Nazi and Fascist dic-
tators in the years preceding World War II, the 
disaster at Pearl Harbor, and the forward march 
of Soviet communism in the postwar period have 
indicated the need for coordinated intelligence 
upon which to base policy and decision to insure 
the national welfare. There has been a growing 
realization that America cannot afford to be 
caught off guard or be forced into an unfavorable 
defensive position in the world scene. 
This new appreciation and support of its en-
deavors has given the intelligence profession more 
stature, and increasing use has been found for its 
products in solving a greater variety of problems. 
Intelligence has also acquired a technical vocabu-
lary to explain its processes and concepts, and 
for the first time in American history qualified 
persons, civilian and military, are being encour-
aged to make it a lifetime career. 
This study will describe the milieu in which 
intelligence operates, the concepts and principles

that govern its employment, and the professional 
tools which modern science and technology have 
made available to its personnel. To the profes-
sional intelligence officer, it can be no more than 
a review of what he has learned through training 
and experience; to the uninitiated it can serve only 
as an introduction. But to all concerned it will 
show the inseparable intermeshing of the activities 
of Naval Intelligence with those of other military 
and national intelligence organizations, and the 
corresponding interaction and cooperation that 
continually links intelligence with planning, 
policymaking, and operations at every level?
from the White House to the foxhole. Naval 
Intelligence represents only one part of the na-
tional intelligence effort. To see the activity of 
his own service in proper perspective the naval 
officer must understand and appreciate the vast 
body of intelligence knowledge, the agencies which 
produce it, and the methods by which it is made 
usable. 
Our first consideration is the significance of 
intelligence today, its total meaning, and the scope 
of its interests, activities, and responsibilities. 
THE CHANGING NATURE OF WAR 
The changing nature of war itself has created 
an increased need for intelligence. Men and 
weapons within the area of conflict have always 
been primary considerations, but by the 20th cen-
tury nations began to give attention to achieving 
their aims through influencing the minds of other 
men. By the written and spoken word nations now 
strive to affect the opinions, emotions, attitudes, 
and behaviors of the peoples of other nations, both 
friendly and hostile. During World War I, three 
theories of warfare were developed, all of which 
emphasized the psychological rather than the 
physical objective, and which were made practical 
by the development of the aircraft and the radio. 
The first theory shifted the purpose of the attack 
from physical destruction to demoralization of 
the opposing force by paralyzing its command. 
The second, "strategic bombing," not only was 
directed against the enemy's economic capabilities, 
but also aimed to overthrow the political govern-
ment by destroying the morale of the civilian 
population behind the battle lines. The third was 
based on a delay in physical attack until the moral 
CONFIDENTIAL 2 
disintegration and internal decay of the enemy 
had been accomplished by propaganda and other 
means of psychological operations. 
In World War II these theories were put to use 
and greatly refined. The mobility of tanks and 
aircraft was utilized to overwhelm enemy com-
mand. Aircraft and aircraft carriers turned 
space into speedways of conquest. Guerrilla war-
fare and the submarine were utilized to exploit 
enemy weakness. Amphibious warfare developed 
a new means of invasion. Radio propaganda was 
employed to confuse and to demoralize. The new 
strategy, or large-scale planning and directing of 
operations, used political, economic, and psycho-
logical as well as military warfare against entire 
enemy populations to accomplish ultimate 
objectives. 
In the modern era, as trade in finished indus-
trial products and raw materials was extended to 
all parts of the world, so likewise military con-
flict assumed world dimensions. War became 
total, directed against total populations and all 
human activities. Both Nazis and Communists 
have demonstrated consummate skill in using eco-
nomic, psychological, and subversive, rather than 
military weapons, to accomplish their basic objec-
tives. War by conventional military weapons has 
become only one aspect of total war; while so-
called "peace" has become a period when the other 
weapons have been used with devastating results. 
Though the war of shot and shell was over, 
the war of words and ideas was rigorously 
continued by Russia and directed against all 
noncommunist countries, and in particular 
(those of) her wartime allies. Within 5 
years this bloodless war enabled the Soviet 
Union to establish an ideological empire cov-
ering nearly a third of the land surface of the 
globe and including 40 percent of its inhabit-
ants, a conquest unequalled in history (J. 
F. C. Fuller, Brassey's 1951 Annual, p. 138) . 
By the middle of the 20th century, the well-
known Clausewitz definition that "war is the con-
tinuation of state policy by other means" had been 
reversed by the Soviet Communist Party. Soviet 
state policy had become the continuation of war 
by other means. A more appropriate definition at 
the current stage of history might be: "War is 
the imposition of one State's policy on another in 
such a manner that freedom of group will is lost."

uunFIDENTIAL 
INTELLIGENCE: A GENERAL ORIENTATION 
The key to the definition of any period as war or 
peace may well be found in the means employed 
and the effect of those means. 
In considering the changing nature of war it is 
significant to note that the strategy of total war 
differs completely in its fundamental premise 
from the old strategy of limited or battlefield war-
fare. As Fletcher Pratt points out in his book 
America and Total War, the old strategy was to 
attack the enemy where his strength lay. When 
his strongest force was defeated, the remainder 
fell with it. The new concept is to concentrate on 
weakness and not to encounter the enemy's 
strength, if at all possible. The point of view of 
the Soviet Union is indicated by Lenin's statement 
that "the soundest strategy of war is to postpone 
operations until the moral disintegration of the 
enemy renders the delivery of the mortal blow 
both possible and easy." As a result, the Soviets 
have employed political, psychological, economic, 
and technical means to achieve warlike objectives, 
wholly or in part, without the more expensive re-
sort to military force. By utilizing these means 
as part of a total subversive effort, the interna-
tional communists have fatally weakened certain 
of their target states, notably Czechoslovakia. 
Subversion, therefore, has been demonstrated as 
a new instrumentality for making war. The 
strategy of total war makes it increasingly diffi-
cult for any state to remain neutral in the struggle 
for power between dominant groups of nations. 
In the post-World War II period, world com-
munism has continued to emphasize the weapon of 
ideas in preference to, although supported by, the 
traditional weapon of physical force. Just when 
or if there may be a shift in emphasis, and how 
the United States should conduct its national poli-
cies to meet and thwart any means employed by its 
adversaries, are vital questions we face today. 
A survey of current international conditions, to-
gether with a clear understanding of the pattern 
and methods of total war, gives unmistakable 
meaning to the popular term, "cold war." In this 
situation at least two factors, other than the nature 
of total war, have given emphasis to the funda-
mental importance of intelligence and the need for 
its use: the increased scope and speed of war and 
the world commitments of the United States. 
3 
Increased Scope and Speed of War 
No longer is space itself a conclusive element 
for defense, nor are geographic features of the 
earth's surface impassable barriers to enemy at-
tack. The awesome technical improvements with 
which scientists are transforming the aircraft and 
the radio of World War II have given the speed 
of sound to the initiation of military attack. In 
World War II the German Blitzkrieg combined 
the use of planes and tanks to conquer France in 
35 days, while in the Pacific, the aircraft carrier 
brought naval forces separated by hundreds of sea 
miles into decisive conflict. At the same time de-
velopments in submarine and amphibious war-
fare withered the extended sea power of Japan and 
brought men, guns, and supplies over thousands 
of miles of ocean to overwhelm her vital defenses 
within a relatively short period. 
Strategic bombing, guerrilla, submarine, and 
psychological warfare carried the war far behind 
the battlefronts to entire civilian populations, 
vital industries, sources of the raw materials of 
war, and communications systems. The master 
plan of the two major Axis partners, Germany 
and Japan, encompassed the globe. To meet this 
threat, the United States fought in the far reaches 
of the Atlantic and the Pacific and sent forces to 
distant continents. All parts of the world felt 
the direct or indirect impact of a world at war. 
World Commitments of the United States 
In the interests of its own security and national 
welfare, the United States has assumed world-
wide commitments, both military and economic. 
The decisions which must be made are funda-
mental, far-reaching, and exceedingly complex. 
The problems involve such intricately related 
questions as economics, finance, national politics, 
raw materials, industrial capacities, communica-
tions, manpower, weapons, and scientific and tech-
nological developments. The growing interrela-
tion of political and military decisions has made 
it impossible for the responsible leaders in either 
field to take action without the closest coordina-
tion of effort, based on a full and mutual under-
standing. The decisions of the military com-
mander are no longer so directly circumscribed by 
the elements involved in a tactical field of action. 
The factors of total war, the increased scope and

INTELLIGENCE FOR 
speed of war, and interlocking world commitments 
have added to the complexity of both staff and 
field decisions. Obviously, the effect of these fac-
tors on the commander varies in degree with the 
echelon of his command. But at any echelon in-
telligence has become a necessity. 
Intelligence?An Essential Function 
More than 2,400 years ago a Chinese general 
named Sun Tzu is reported to have said: "Hostile 
armies may face each other for years striving for 
victory which is decided in a single day. This 
being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's 
condition . . . is the height of inhumanity. One 
who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help 
to his sovereign, no master of victory. Thus, what 
enables the wise sovereign and the good general 
to strike and to conquer, and achieve things be-
yond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowl-
edge." 
Intelligence, properly performed, can provide 
foreknowledge both for government and for mili-
tary commanders. It can reduce the possibilities 
of surprise, give estimates regarding both the po-
tential enemy and the area in which he might op-
erate, and so aid in reaching sound decisions which 
are vital not only to the security and welfare of 
the nation but also to success in combat. Intelli-
gence, properly used, has its place not only in war 
or preparation for war, but also in peace and keep-
ing the peace. 
INTELLIGENCE AS KNOWLEDGE 
"Intelligence regarding the loyalty of the aver-
age indigenous peasant to the present hostile gov-
ernment of . . . is important (1) to an evalua-
tion of the stability of that government and its 
capacity to extend its influence and (2) to the 
selection of an area along its coast for the landing 
of amphibious forces." 
By this hypothetical statement, the following 
charactertistics of intelligence are illustrated: (1) 
it is a body of knowledge; (2) it deals with a pos-
sible enemy state; (3) it affects a possible area of 
operations; (4) it can be used by top-level plan-
ners in government and on military staffs; and 
(5) it can aid the military commander in the 
planning of a specific operation. 
Knowledge regarding the "average indigenous 
CONFIDENTIAL

peasant" is much more than the sum of bits of 
information regarding few or many peasants, 
gathered from every conceivable source. Some of 
these bits of information may be true or false; 
some may be detailed or fragmentary; some may 
be general or factual in nature; some may come 
from sources which are accurate and reliable, some 
from sources which are inaccurate and unreliable. 
At any rate, many bits of information regarding 
the "indigenous peasant" must be gathered to-
gether and evaluated; they must be carefully 
analyzed and compared to see that they are plaus-
ible; and, after having been boiled down to an 
essence most closely approximating probable truth, 
they will provide a conclusion which is meaning-
ful. From the facts or information comes some-
thing new, called knowledge or intelligence. 
Information, then, includes such things as facts, 
documents, and observations, but is not intelli-
gence until it has been carefully screened and 
digested to provide accurate meaning. 
Intelligence, however, does not include the total 
substance of human knowledge, but only that 
which military and civilian leaders must have to 
make the vital decisions for today and tomorrow. 
It is the basis for a country's foreign relations, and, 
as a function of command, it is also essential for 
the planning and execution of military operations. 
In either case, it is knowledge upon which a suc-
cessful course of action can be based. It has been 
aptly stated that intelligence ideally is that knowl-
edge which a potential enemy has about himself. 
The scope of American national intelligence is 
exceedingly broad because the United States in 
the interests of its own welfare must know a 
great deal concerning the attitudes, activities, in-
terests, and long-range plans of all other states in 
the world. The concentration of interest, of 
course, will depend upon the conditions of inter-
national relations at any given time. Since it is 
impossible for any nation to attain the ideal of 
having all pertinent knowledge about potential 
enemies, certain gaps always exist. Intelligence, 
therefore, resembles a vast collection of jigsaw 
puzzle pieces. Some pieces belong to different 
puzzles, some will not fit any apparent gap in the 
picture, and some obviously belong but must be 
patiently fitted into the picture in order to solve 
the puzzle.

INTELLIGENCE : A GENERAL ORIENTATION CONFIDENTIAL 
Component Parts 
In assembling this comprehensive knowledge it 
is essential to break it down into component parts 
for better understanding and ease in handling. A 
systematic classification is achieved by a detailed 
compilation of, first, all the factors of physical 
environment and, second, of the characteristics 
that govern human behavior in a given country. 
Eight major divisions are generally used: military 
geography, transportation and telecommunica-
tions, sociological, political, economic, armed 
forces, technical and scientific, and biographical. 
Each of these components, discussed in detail in 
chapter 5, are indicative of the tremendous range 
of intelligence subject matter. All components 
are closely interrelated; no one can be considered 
separately. A valid estimate can be reached only 
by considering each in relation to the others. 
For the intelligence officer a similar comprehen-
sive knowledge about his own country is a neces-
sary tool, since only with this accurate and more 
familiar yardstick can he make valid comparisons 
and relative estimates. 
The Factor of Time 
The components listed above represent a divi-
sion of the subject matter of intelligence into broad 
fields of knowledge. A consideration of the fac-
tor of time produces a further breakdown into 
relative elements, labelled as follows: Basic, which 
is descriptive of the more permanent and signifi-
cant past; Current, which deals with the present; 
and Estimative, which concerns future develop-
ments. The truly significant element of intelli-
gence is, of course, the Estimative which projects 
situations and trends into the future. This fore-
casting, however, must be built up accu-
rately and painstakingly from both past and cur-
rent knowledge. 
The basic element is encyclopedic in nature and 
includes geographical and historical data. It 
provides the broad background against which to 
interpret the present and predict the future. It 
is a part of all the components already mentioned, 
but especially of those which cover the area of 
operations and the sociological, political, and eco-
nomic background of a people. As in the pre-
vious example of the "average indigenous 
peasant," in order to predict his reactions at some 
future time, the analyst must have a comprehen-
sive knowledge of the peasant's past attitudes, 
group habits, environment, and responses. Also, 
in deciding on possible landing beaches on the 
coast of the country in question, the intelligence 
officer must present to his commander a complete 
description of the beaches along the entire coast. 
The geographic knowledge must include soil; exits 
from beaches, topography behind the beaches; ac-
cessibility to roads, rail-lines, towns, water, build-
ing materials; recognizable features of the coast-
line; the slope of the beach, the sea bottom off 
the beaches, the surf, currents, tide, underwater ob-
stacles, sea approaches, and so forth. When it 
is realized that there may be a number of possible 
beaches along the coastline of a given country, 
the quantity of knowledge required becomes 
apparent. 
During World War II, the monographs and area 
studies prepared by Naval Intelligence provided 
detailed background knowledge of an encyclopedic 
nature which was indispensable to the planning 
of operations all over the world. The Joint 
Army-Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS) were 
also developed to provide background knowledge 
of areas about which little was previously known. 
The extensive encyclopedic documentation on 
heavy industry within Germany, for example, en-
abled intelligence personnel to note change or ex-
pansion, and to estimate the effectiveness of 
strategic bombing. The experience gained and 
lessons learned from these wartime studies have 
emphasized the need for continued coordinated 
efforts on the part of all intelligence activities 
in developing and maintaining a fund of basic 
knowledge in order that the day-to-day situation 
can be better interpreted. The National Intelli-
gence Survey program is a more recent step to-
ward meeting that need. 
The current element records the changes con-
tinually occurring among all groups of peoples, 
as well as those which may occur in the physical 
geography of the world. Knowledge about the 
past must be brought up to date. The significance 
of change lies in the possibilities not only of 
progress but also of decay. For example, in con-
sidering any other state, friendly or unfriendly, 
our military and civilian leaders are vitally in-

terested in knowing whether its steel production 
has increased or decreased to a significant degree; 
what changes have occurred in population, espe-
cially in the distribution of age groups; 
or whether there is a decided swing in popular 
support from one political doctrine to another. 
In considering financial aid to the Nationalist 
Chinese Government after World War II, United 
States leaders needed to know details about such 
matters as current economic conditions in China, 
and how they were affected by government poli-
cies; the needs of the people for food, clothing 
and shelter; the morale and status of equipment 
of the military forces; and the effectiveness of 
military and political opposition forces. From 
an infinitely complex situation an accurate esti-
mate was required in order to determine if finan-
cial aid would be of assistance and, if so, in what 
manner it should be given. 
Even the most limited description of the basic 
and current elements of intelligence indicates the 
enormous quantity and variety of details involved. 
It becomes readily apparent that there is a physi-
cal limit to the production of such a volume of 
knowledge. The question quickly arises: Since it 
is impossible to achieve the ideal, how should the 
effort be distributed? The only possible answer 
is to concentrate on those areas which are most 
directly related to the present and future deci-
sions of military commanders and civilian leaders. 
In any event, the basic and current elements of 
intelligence must be formulated so as to provide 
an accurate basis for the estimative. 
The estimative element deals with the future. 
It is knowledge of what a state or a military force 
of that state can or might do. In respect to in-
ternational politics, it includes the influence which 
any state can exert in the world and what forms 
that influence may take. In respect to a military 
force, it considers the effectiveness of that force 
at a given place and time and the objectives that 
force is capable of gaining, or might try to gain. 
In effect, this element of intelligence represents 
inferences from past and current knowledge 
which may or may not be complete. 
Involved in the estimative element are four pri-
mary factors: situations which exist or may 
eventually exist; vulnerabilities or specific weak-
nesses which may be exploited; capabilities; and 
CONFIDENTIAL 
6 
probable courses of action. An intelligence esti-
mate, to have real meaning, must relate to a situa-
tion, that is, to a possible enemy, to a possible 
place, to a possible time, and to the probable 
means which may be employed. No estimative 
knowledge can have meaning in a vacuum. 
Given the concept of total war, the vulnerabili-
ties of another state are particularly significant. 
Weaknesses may exist in any aspect of its national 
life?political, sociological, or economic. They 
may be found in its military forces or in its geo-
graphic position. The skillful exploitation of 
weaknesses may produce results out of all propor-
tion to the means employed. Conversely, failure 
to exploit them because of lack of knowledge can 
be costly to a disastrous degree. In both World 
Wars, Great Britain's insularity was a vulnera-
bility upon which Germany concentrated by 
means of its submarine force. Extremely serious 
situations resulted from this underwater warfare 
directed against the shipping which carried food 
to Britain's population and raw materials to her 
industries. In World War II, one of Hitler's 
blunders was his failure to invade England after 
the withdrawal from Dunkerque, an admirable 
illustration of failure to take advantage of a mili-
tary vulnerability because of lack of knowledge 
and planning. In the case of France, on the other 
hand, the moral weakening of her political struc-
ture, and internal dissension and corruption 
helped to create a vulnerability which the Ger-
mans exploited to the full. 
The capabilities of a state relate to its qualities 
of strength. The fundamental?and ultimate?
capability is that of military power, expressed in 
time and force, which includes not only men and 
guns, but also economic and industrial strength. 
Other strength factors include: geographical po-
sition; population, especially of military age; raw 
materials and industrial plants; transportation 
facilities; the stability of political structure; and 
the moral fibre of the people. During World 
War II, the German and Japanese Governments 
underestimated both the industrial capability of 
the United States and the strength and determi-
nation of the American people. 
In planning military operations, the following 
additional factors of strength or weakness are con-
sidered: numerical military strength, effect of

INTELLIGENCE: A GENERAL ORIENTATION CONFIDENTIAL 
time and distance, efficiency of personnel, quality 
of equipment, special weapons, and logistic sup-
port and reinforcement. 
Given the situation, together with the enemy's 
vulnerabilities and capabilities, the estimative ele-
ment of intelligence takes the form of probable 
courses of action. It may be deduced, therefore, 
that this element of intelligence represents guesses 
or opinions rather than verifiable facts and hence 
is of doubtful value. It is true that estimative 
knowledge is not absolute nor as exact as basic and 
current. However, if based on accurate informa-
tion carefully analyzed, it constitutes an educated 
guess and a carefully considered opinion of a much 
more valid nature than that derived from an in-
dividual "hunch" or snap judgment. 
Intelligence, then, is a body of knowledge which 
encompasses in greater or less degree, all world 
states, and all possible areas of operation. Its ele-
ments and component parts are interrelated and 
intermeshed. Its infinite volume of detail re-
quires emphasis only on those portions of knowl-
edge which are or will be needed by military com-
manders and civilian leaders. It is knowledge 
for a purpose. The only justification for its col-
lection and interpretation is to assist those who 
will use it in reaching vital decisions. Those who 
produce intelligence must keep this purpose fore-
most in mind. 
Use for Strategic Purposes 
Military commanders at all echelons of com-
mand draw upon the body of intelligence knowl-
edge in solving particular problems and in reach-
ing command decisions. Those in top echelons 
of command, and top-level leaders in government, 
use areas of this knowledge in formulating plans 
and policies and reaching decisions affecting the 
security and welfare of the entire nation. In time 
of peace, top-level commanders determine how best 
to dispose and utilize available military forces for 
the national security and assist the top-level ci-
vilian leaders who formulate the national policy 
toward other nations of the world. In addition, 
in time of war, these military commanders are re-
sponsible for the conduct of total military opera-
tions. This employment of intelligence is called 
Strategic Use. Strategic Use furthers the master 
plan of the nation's world relationships in both 
7 
war and peace?its grand strategy, which encom-
passes both military planning and foreign policy, 
and has an inevitable impact on domestic policy 
as well. 
From the military point of view, strategy does 
two things: it determines and assigns objectives 
which, if achieved, will aid in winning a war and 
strengthening the peace; and it allocates and gets 
to the right place at the right time an adequate 
and suitable force to accomplish each objective 
against enemy resistance. In respect to national 
policy, strategy is positive when it aims to im-
prove a current situation in world affairs; it is 
defensive when it strives to prevent a situation 
from becoming more unfavorable. When the na-
tion has a choice of several favorable policies, it 
then has the strategic initiative. 
In the restricted military sense, strategy con-
notes the application of armed force or the threat 
of that force; in a broader military-political 
sense, it includes the use of economic-political-
psychological activities to gain diplomatic or 
trade advantages or to influence the group think-
ing of another nation in a manner which will 
promote the welfare of our own Nation. The 
strategic role of intelligence when there is no 
armed conflict is to aid the chiefs of state in 
formulating grand strategy and to enable military 
leaders to plan in such a way as to support the 
decisions of the chiefs of state. 
An example of the use of intelligence for the 
purposes of grand strategy is afforded by Hitler's 
early development of a world-wide system for 
gathering information which was scientifically 
analyzed and evaluated. With this weapon he 
was able to implement his revolutionary methods 
of warfare, which took economic, political, and 
psychological forms during the years from 1938 
to 1940. It made possible his "fifth-column" ac-
tivities, his "war of nerves," and the corruption 
of high public officials. It was the basis for a 
succession of historic events: the annexation of 
Austria, the occupation of Czechoslovakia, Nor-
way, the Netherlands, and Belgium, the diplo-
matic isolation of the Balkan countries, and the 
fall of France. 
Through intelligence activities the Nazis probed 
the defenses of the Maginot Line, and through a 
skillful "war of nerves," followed by the ultimate

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
"blitzkrieg," 200,000 men were enabled to defeat 
a nation with 5,000,000 men under arms. 
In modern war, strategic bombing has increased 
the requirements for intelligence knowledge upon 
which military planners are dependent for target 
selection. In World War II the bombing of Ger-
man industrial targets required information 
about basic war industries and the thousands of 
industrial plants involved. For example, a great 
deal of study preceded the Allied decision. to 
bomb plants producing aircraft and their compo-
nent parts, ball bearings, synthetic rubber and 
oil, and thus to cripple a most important segment 
of German war production. 
The term, "Strategic Intelligence," then, is de-
scriptive of one use of intelligence knowledge. 
Other terms, commonly employed, relate not only 
to a use of this knowledge but also to the user. 
"National Intelligence" describes the knowledge 
used as a basis for reaching comprehe:asive deci-
sions regarding national policy, welfare, and se-
curity. It also identifies the users as top-level 
governmental groups whose interests are broader 
than those of any one department or agency. 
"Departmental Intelligence" identifies the user as 
a department of the federal government and re-
fers to the knowledge used in the carrying out of 
its mission and assigned responsibilities. "Naval 
Intelligence," for example, is one kind of 
"departmental intelligence." "Interdepartmental 
Intelligence," which lacks the scope of "National 
Intelligence," describes knowledge of. common 
concern to more than one department. Finally, 
other terms are employed to describe many of the 
component parts of intelligence knowledge ac-
cording to their content: such as "political intelli-
gence," "economic intelligence," and "technical 
intelligence." 
A. problem in the use of terms such as these has 
been the resulting erroneous impression that each 
represents a kind of intelligence that is different 
from all others. While these various terms are 
quite acceptable for convenient reference, the point 
to remember is that they do not describe separate, 
distinct or compartmented kinds of intelligence. 
All kinds are irrevocably interrelated; the mean-
ing of each, as well as the meaning of the total, is 
complete only when all are considered together. 
Regardless of terminology, intelligence can be only 
CONFIDENTIAL 
8 
one body of knowledge with component parts and 
elements which are drawn upon according to the 
needs of the user. 
Use for Operational Purposes 
While toplevel military commanders use intelli-
gence for broad planning purposes, they can never 
lose sight of the fact that their policies and deci-
sions must be translated into action by the lower 
echelons of command. Hence the knowledge used 
by all echelons is both broad and specific. The 
only difference is one of emphasis, which stems 
from the problem to be solved by the user. For 
example, the knowledge used becomes less broad 
and more specific as the toplevel decision is trans-
ferred for action to the theater commander, down 
to the task force commander, and so on to the com-
manders of the operatng fleet units. Thus intel-
ligence is used specifically for operational pur-
poses when it is a basis for decisions involving the 
physical employment of particular men and mate-
riel against a particular adversary. Here the 
current element of intelligence plays a most im-
portant part. 
As one illustration, in the latter days of World 
War II, the decision to drop an atomic bomb on 
Hiroshima was made at the highest policy and 
command levels on the basis of the most compre-
hensive available intelligence in view of the stra-
tegic implications for the entire Pacific war. At 
the same time, potential Japanese air opposition 
required the use of intelligence for specific opera-
tional considerations in determining whether or 
not such a mission could be successfuly carried out. 
It has often been said that intelligence is used 
for strategic purposes in time of peace and for 
operational purposes in time of war. Such a 
statement might have been approximately correct 
prior to World War I, when periods of war and 
of peace could be more accurately labeled. How-
ever, just as the pattern of total war has materially 
reduced the distinction between strategy and 
tactics so likewise has it resulted in a merging of 
the uses of intelligence for strategic and opera-
tional purposes. 
In time of peace, or when widespread military 
conflict is not involved, intelligence may be 
used for operational purposes, as well as stra-
tegic. The ideological war waged by the Soviet

INTELLIGENCE: A GENERAL ORIENTATION CONFIDENTIAL 
Union against many nonCommunist countries, in-
cluding the United States since 1945, is illustra-
tive. The weapon of ideas has been employed in 
an effort to incite unrest among labor and racial 
groups, and to capture the minds of men with false 
words. To take action against this weapon, radio 
programs, such as those produced by the Voice of 
America, have been instituted as a means of pre-
senting a true picture of American life and aims. 
Intelligence has an operational use when it serves 
as a basis for decisions regarding such matters as 
audience targets. 
In times of armed conflict, intelligence has many 
varied and vital operational uses. In planning 
and executing a large amphibious operation, such 
as that at Okinawa, the responsible commanders 
required the most detailed and comprehensive 
knowledge concerning the Japanese forces and de-
fenses on those islands, the physical area of opera-
tions, and enemy forces in adjacent areas which 
would be capable of interference. In a smaller 
specific combat situation, such as a submarine mis-
sion in the Formosa straits, the submarine com-
mander required specific knowledge as to when 
and where Japanese naval and merchant ships 
could be expected and which were the best targets. 
If a merchant ship carrying rice from Saigon to 
Tokyo was given first priority, that selection 
might well have represented a strategic as well as 
an operational use of intelligence. The knowl-
edge required as a basis for operations involving 
aircraft carriers separated by hundreds of miles 
may be both operational and strategic. 
For operational purposes, then, there is a need 
for the most detailed and specific knowledge about 
the enemy and the anticipated area of conflict. 
This is true for all types of military operations, 
amphibious, submarine, antisubmarine, mining, 
air, fleet, and reconnaissance patrols, to mention 
only a few. Similar knowledge is also required 
for the action phase of other types of modern war-
fare such as economic, political, and psychological. 
For convenience of reference in operational ac-
tivities, the knowledge involved has been labelled 
according to its use and its user. For example, the 
following terms are common: operational intelli-
gence, amphibious intelligence, air intelligence, 
and fleet intelligence. During World War II the 
term "operational intelligence" was defined as "in-
9 
telligence needed by naval commanders in plan-
ning and executing operations, including battle," 
and referred to operations of an extensive and 
time-consuming nature. A second term, "combat 
intelligence" was used to describe that part of 
naval operational intelligence required by naval 
commanders actually engaging enemy forces dur-
ing the comparatively short time of a naval battle. 
As in the case of the various terms applied to the 
strategic use of intelligence, it must be pointed out 
again that no separate or distinctive kinds of in-
telligence are involved. The parts or elements of 
the total body of knowledge are simply being used 
for a particular purpose which, in this instance, is 
operational. 
In connection with military operations, it must 
be emphasized that intelligence has one primary 
function: to aid the commander in resolving his 
mission and supervising the planned action 
against the enemy. This function, together with 
the role of the intelligence officer on an operational 
staff, will be discussed in chapter 12. 
Use for Countering Purposes 
A third major use of intelligence arises from the 
need for countering the positive efforts of poten-
tial enemies to carry out against a nation certain 
inimical activities known as espionage, sabotage, 
and subversion. In general, these activities have 
the common objectives of weakening or destroying 
any or all elements of a nation's total power and 
warmaking potential, thereby increasing the 
power advantage of the nation initiating them. 
Simply stated, espionage is the clandestine collec-
tion of information about a foreign country. To 
a degree, it is the art of spying. However, it may 
also be any unobserved or unapproved collection 
of information which, when gained, is used to the 
disadvantage of the subject nation. The target of 
espionage is particular information which will aid 
in determining a nation's capabilities and inten-
tions, its strengths and weaknesses. 
Sabotage is activity directed toward the damage 
or destruction of physical facilities vital to a na-
tion's total power, such as its industrial system and 
military establishment. Sabotage, however, is 
not only physical. It may be nonphysical, though 
just as effective, if its objective is the weakening 
or destruction of a program or a policy, domestic

INTELLIGENCE FOR 
or foreign, related to a nation's strength, security, 
and general welfare. This type of sabotage in-
cludes enemy activities which have as their result 
the creating of terror, panic, and civil disorders. 
Subversion may be described as activity aimed 
at attacking men's minds for such purposes as 
destroying primary loyalties and faith in consti-
tuted authority, encouraging continued dissension 
between social and racial groups, or causing in-
dividuals and groups to act consistently contrary 
to the best interests of a nation's government. As 
an ultimate objective, subversive activities are di-
rected toward transforming social institutions and 
eventually altering a form of government through 
unconstitutional means. While it is often difficult 
to differentiate between the activities of nonphysi-
cal sabotage and subversion, one point of distinc-
tion is the fact that subversion involves a com-
plete change in attitudes and points of view, a 
permanent transfer of loyalties and faith. A dif-
ference, then, is to be found in the degree of 
finality of the results achieved. Because of the 
common objective and related methods of espio-
nage, sabotage, and subversion, the term "subver-
sion" is sometimes used to include all of these 
detrimental activities. 
Quite naturally, every nation actively endeavors 
to prevent any other from carrying out success-
fully such activities. These opposing efforts are 
called counterespionage, camtersabotage, and 
countersubversion. 
Since it is apparent that some nations of the 
world have organizations trained to carry out 
espionage, sabotage, and subversion, the United 
States Government and its military services must 
be prepared to counter them in at least two ways. 
First, adequate security control measures must be 
established and maintained to safeguard informa-
tion, personnel, equipment, and installations 
against these inimical activities of foreign nations 
and of disaffected or dissident groups or individ-
uals which constitute a threat to the national se-
curity; and second, both the foreign organizations 
and the groups or individuals involved must be 
actively opposed and prevented from accomplish-
ing their objectives. In order to achieve maxi-
mum success, our responsible departments and 
agencies require both comprehensive and detailed 
knowledge regarding the objectives, plans, and 
CONFIDENTIAL 
10 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
methods of the enemy, and particularly the or-
ganizations, groups, and individuals trained in 
and assigned to the specialized activities described 
above. The knowledge used to counter these ac-
tivities may be called counterintelligence. How-
ever, it must be noted immediately that the term 
"counterintelligence" means much more than 
"knowledge"; it encompasses both organization 
and activity. In its comprehensive sense, there-
fore, counterintelligence is a specialized phase of 
intelligence related specifically to security control 
measures applied against the enemy's activities of 
espionage, sabotage, and subversion. A more com-
plete discussion of this subject will be given in 
chapter 15. 
The use of counterintelligence knowledge is 
closely and continuously related to the uses of in-
telligence for strategic and operational purposes. 
Regardless of the purpose, information concern-
ing it must be denied to the enemy, and his efforts 
to interfere by means of espionage, sabotage, or 
subversion must be opposed. This is essential in 
both peace and war. In time of peace for example, 
information regarding the grand strategy of the 
United States must be most carefully guarded. 
In time of war, the military commander usually 
includes a counterintelligence plan with his opera-
tions plan or order. Hence, while intelligence is 
being used for other purposes, it is being used 
concurrently to protect those purposes. The na-
ture and form of security control measures depend 
upon knowledge of the enemy and of the particu-
lar activities to be countered. 
The vital part which counterintelligence must 
play in time of peace is well illustrated by the 
Gouzenko incident in Canada in 1945. Through 
the voluntary confession of a cipher clerk in the 
Soviet Embassy at Ottawa, evidence was revealed 
that a Soviet spy ring had obtained much vital 
technical information regarding the atomic bomb. 
Subsequent additional evidence pointed to the 
probability that the Soviet Union, profiting from 
extensive espionage activities, was much further 
advanced in its atomic research program than had 
been considered possible. An immediate result of 
this information was a reduction in the world 
power advantage of the United States and her 
allies, maintained as long as she was in exclusive 
possession of the secrets of the atomic bomb. In

INTELLIGENCE: A GENERAL ORIENTATION CONFIDENTIAL 
view of this newly determined Soviet capability, 
both our national and military planning and poli-
cies became subject to revision. The deficiencies 
of counterintelligence in this instance had ob-
viously significant effects on a worldwide scale. 
Preparatory to the Allied invasion of Nor-
mandy counterintelligence was needed by appro-
priate authority to formulate protective, decep-
tive, and aggressive measures in the United States, 
the United Kingdom, and in enemy-occupied' 
France in order to thwart Nazi efforts to gain vital 
information regarding invasion plans. It may be 
assumed that the enemy concentrated his espio-
nage activities on finding out the time and place of 
the Allied landings, and the numbers and disposi-
tions of ground, air, and naval units involved; fur-
ther, that every effort was made by means of 
sabotage and subversion to disrupt the imple-
mentation of Allied plans. The responsibilities 
of counterintelligence were tremendous and its 
contributions substantially effective. 
These illustrations indicate that knowledge 
prior to enemy action is of inestimable value. 
Even more, they imply that positive action in ad-
vance which will deny to an enemy the opportunity 
to commit the act is of even greater value. This 
action feature of counterintelligence sets it some-
what apart from the uses of knowledge already 
mentioned. 
As was true of the other two major uses of in-
telligence knowledge, various descriptive terms 
have been applied to counterintelligence in order 
to define it. For example, it has been labelled as 
"domestic intelligence," "negative intelligence," 
"security intelligence," or "passive intelligence." 
Since these terms are not entirely accurate or com-
plete they should be noted only for reference pur-
poses. To be remembered is the fact that knowl-
edge used for countering purposes is still a part 
of the total body of knowledge, deriving its full 
meaning only when considered in the light of the 
whole. 
Other Uses 
There is frequent need for specific items of 
knowledge; in some cases, merely factual data or 
information .from which is derived the encyclo-
pedic or basic element of knowledge. For ex-
ample, in the formulation of a new policy or in the 
solution of a military problem, an agency or a 
commander may need to know the cargo unloading 
capacity of a certain port, the depth of water 
alongside a particular pier, the source of water 
for a town, or the lowest recorded temperature at 
the South Pole. Various departments or agen-
cies concentrate on specific areas of knowledge and 
must be prepared to provide reference service to 
organizations working on related problems. When 
knowledge or information is used for this purpose 
it is known as Spot Intelligence or Spot Informa-
tion. It is usually obtained by intelligence agen-
cies or collection units in response to a specific re-
quest. Important as this use is, care must be taken 
to ensure that concentration on the requirements 
of Spot Intelligence does not result in a neglect 
of the overall requirements of the intelligence 
mission. 
Other uses of intelligence may well arise in 
years to come. Since 1945 a concept of world 
state communities has been growing out of the 
activities of the United Nations and its associated 
regional pacts. As the United States increases its 
participation in these activities it is quite possible 
that there will be new uses for intelligence in such 
joint enterprises. But regardless of any new uses, 
or special terms to describe them, the knowledge 
involved will still remain a part of the total body 
of intelligence as far as the United States is 
concerned. 
In discussing various uses of intelligence, the 
users have been described in general terms. They 
include not only civilian leaders within the federal 
government and military leaders in all echelons 
of command, but also individual military person-
nel with specialized jobs?such as pilots, boat-
swain's mates, and tank drivers. Even those who 
produce intelligence must use it in order to con-
tinue the orderly expansion of the total body of 
knowledge. It is the organization of these pro-
ducers that gives a second connotation to the word 
intelligence. 
INTELLIGENCE AS ORGANIZATION 
In his book, A Soldier's Story, General of the 
Army Omar N. Bradley makes the following com-
ment: "Later in the War, I often explained to 
my Staff that 0-2 (Intelligence) existed to tell 
me what should be done on the basis of his in-

CONFIDENTIAL 
INTELLIGENCE FOR 
formation concerning the enemy." In this 
statement, General Bradley is referring to the or-
ganiZation which produces the knowledge he, as a 
commander, must have for his use. When spelled 
with a capital "I," Intelligence means organi-
zation. 
The historical development of intelligence or-
ganizations, and characteristics of the United 
States intelligence system are more fully discussed 
in chapters 2 and 3, but it is pertinent here to 
stress the impact of the pattern of total war on 
all intelligence organizations. Not only has to-
tal war caused a tremendous expansion of the total 
body of knowledge needed by civil government 
and military command, but it has also forced an 
intensive development of organizations specializ-
ing in many fields to gather and to produce that 
knowledge. Some nations, having maintained 
intelligence organizations for hundreds of years, 
have a substantial background upon which to 
draw. The United States, however, has a much 
more limited background; and only in recent 
years has it endeavored to stabilize the structure 
of its national intelligence system. The poten-
tialities of this system, in peace and in war, are 
great indeed; its youth is a limiting factor which 
will be overcome only by inspired leadership, 
hard work, and continuous years of experience. 
Prior to, during, and even after World War I, 
intelligence production was handled on an indi-
vidual basis, with little coordination of effort. 
Total war, however, has brought about require-
ments for knowledge based on information of such 
complexity and pervasiveness throughout the 
total of man's activities that it cannot be encom-
passed by individuals working singly. Meaning-
ful intelligence requires the group effort of many 
individuals whose activities must be carefully 
directed and coordinated. Therefore, efficient 
organization and skillful production have as-
sumed great importance. 
Sherman Kent has aptly stated that good in-
telligence organizations must possess certain char-
acteristics of a large university faculty, a great 
metropolitan newspaper, and a good commercial 
business organization. First, management must 
appreciate and tolerate broad individual freedom 
in the search for truth by personnel selected for 
their abilities in research and analysis. Second, 
CONFIDENTIAL 
12 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
organizational doctrine must emphasize rigid ad-
herence to the time requirements for completion 
of assignments, an observance of editorial policy, 
and an individual responsibility for accuracy, 
completeness, and clarity of meaning And third, 
the producers must be sure that the product is 
prepared and packaged in accordance with the 
needs and wishes of the consumer. They must 
also consider its value in relation to its cost. Like 
'a good business, Intelligence must stress plan-
ning; it must study the market, consumer reaction 
to its product, and new consumer problems which 
will require the development of new products. 
Intelligence must be a carefully defined, smoothly 
operating organization which remains sufficiently 
flexible to permit adjustment to emergencies. 
Continued application of the principles of mod-
ern management will aid in streamlining intelli-
gence organizations to reduce duplication of 
effort, without sacrificing complete coverage. 
Special efforts of management must be directed 
toward the development of a sense of purpose for 
each organization, an understanding of the over-
all intelligence production problems, and an ap-
preciation of the interdependence of the various 
producing organizations. Close coordination of 
the intelligence production of the various serv-
ices, departments and agencies, together with the 
greatest care in selection and training of person-
nel, can do much to develop smoothly operating 
organizations. 
Many problems of United States intelligence 
organizations stem from inexperience and from 
the inevitable fact that much information collected 
is incomplete and imperfect. Still others arise 
from the techniques employed to refine the infor-
mation. It should be clearly understood that, 
since this information relates substantially to the 
variables of human behavior, its processing into 
intelligence cannot apply fully the techniques of 
scientific research and laboratory method used by 
the exact sciences. An appreciation of various 
basic reasons for some of the problems of intelli-
gence organization can, in itself, benefit both the 
producers and the consumers of intelligence. 
Of necessity, intelligence work has become a 
profession, deriving its substance from other pro-
fessional fields, especially from the exact sciences 
and the social studies, but also requiring the con-

INTELLIGENCE: A GENERAL ORIENTATION CONFIDENTIAL 
tributions of the historian, economist, lawyer, and 
linguist. No longer is it desirable for individuals 
to be impressed into Intelligence service with the 
hope that they can "pick it up." The require-
ments for each worker include an accurate fund 
of knowledge which is not only broad, but also 
specific (in at least one field) . In addition, cer-
tain basic personal qualities are indispensable. 
Basic Attributes of Personnel 
Intelligence is an organization made up of peo-
ple; its effectiveness and success rest upon them. 
What then should be some. of their personal qual-
ities? First of all is flexibility of mind, which 
may be defined as the ability to meet new situa-
tions effectively as they arise. One who possesses 
this quality is capable of bold and original 
thought, and he does not hesitate when the need 
arises to depart from traditional procedure. 
A second quality is the ability to assimilate 
quickly a large and perhaps diverse number of 
facts into a comprehensive whole, from which sig-
nificant meanings may be drawn. This quality 
obviously implies others, such as a faculty for ab-
sorption and retention of background information, 
a natural curiosity, well-ordered mental processes, 
and imagination tempered by common sense. 
The ability to speak and write clearly, concisely, 
and accurately is essential if the information or 
intelligence is to be successfully transmitted to 
those who need to know. 
Personal enthusiasm, a strong sense of balance 
and proportion, and a wholehearted spirit of co-
operation rank high on the list. Because intelli-
gence work represents group effort, no one person 
should depreciate the work of others and magnify 
his own; he must recognize that there is much he 
can give and much he can receive in the total pro-
duction effort. He should never lose sight of the 
fact that he is contributing to overall objectives 
and meanings which may be vital for his country-
men's survival. Loyalty, then, is also basic. 
Intellectual honesty is that quality which will 
compel the intelligence work& to transmit the true 
meaning of his knowledge as he sees it, and not as 
the potential user would like to hear it. Emo-
tional stability is essential to continued good judg-
ment as well as to the indispensable quality of re-
liability. The significance of these qualities is 
well illustrated by the case of Col. Alfred Redl, 
head of all Austrian espionage during the days 
of the Old Austro-Hungarian Empire prior to 
World War I. Because of his homosexuality, he 
was successfully blackmailed by a Russian agent 
who obtained Austrian secret war plans, military 
codes, and a list of Austrian agents in Russia. The 
appalling defeats suffered by the Austrians in 
Galicia early in World War I were partly attrib-
utable to Redl's vulnerability. 
Other qualities and abilities are required in in-
telligence work, varying in degree according to 
the particular duties assigned. They will be dis-
cussed as appropriate in later sections of this text. 
The intelligence officer must possess qualities of 
leadership commensurate with the responsibilities 
of his billet. In general, he must have a minimum 
amount of knowledge in all fields relating to his 
work so that he may recognize the existence and 
general nature of any problem. For example, he 
must know enough about an area of operations to 
appreciate any conditions which might give rise 
to problems of health for a landing force. He 
must be able to coordinate the precise technical 
knowledge of the staff expert with his own general 
knowledge about the enemy in order to evaluate 
the full implications correctly. Finally, he must 
be able to integrate subsidiary conclusions in order 
to reach the essential overall estimate. 
It becomes apparent that the requirements for 
the intelligence officer are highly exacting. The 
body of knowledge with which he must concern 
himself is both comprehensive and widely varied. 
The question immediately arises as to where such 
personnel may be found and how they should be 
selected. 
Selection of Personnel 
In the case of officers for Naval Intelligence bil-
lets, a basic knowledge regarding the United 
States Navy is a first requirement. This knowl-
edge can best be obtained from active naval serv-
ice, although good training at naval schools can be 
an emergency substitute. The importance of this 
requirement has been indicated previously, when 
it was noted that the production of knowledge 
about the enemy and the area of operations is often 
facilitated by knowledge of our own forces and 
our methods in comparable operations. In addi-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
tion to naval knowledge and training, officers must 
be carefully selected on the basis of the personal 
attributes described above and the particular re-
quirements of the billet for which they are being 
considered. Specialized intelligence training is 
also essential. 
In general, intelligence personnel should be se-
lected from those who have specialized in fields of 
knowledge to which intelligence is related, such as 
architecture, archeology, engineering, geology, 
cartology, hydrography, photogrammetry, law, 
transportation and shipping, languages, the nat-
ural and physical sciencies, and the social studies. 
Valuable experience includes extensive foreign 
travel, investigative work with federal and state 
agencies, research and analysis, executive and ad-
ministrative. While it is true that the selected 
specialists are well versed in their own fields, they 
are entering a new field, and must learn to perform 
their assigned duties in Intelligence in accordance 
with new techniques. Training of all personnel is 
imperative. 
The Value of Training 
At least two facts emphasize the necessity for 
the most exacting training: First, the production 
of intelligence involves an intricate developmental 
process for which all pertinent material is seldom 
available; and second, the finished product may be 
vital to the welfare and security of the Nation 
and to the very lives of fellow countrymen. 
In order to contribute effectively to this produc-
tion, intelligence personnel must fully explore all 
possible sources for information; they must know 
when and how to explore; they must thoroughly 
understand the process for refining this informa-
tion: the adding, subtracting, tempering, and test-
ing which go into the forging of intelligence. In 
this refining process, they need experience to ap-
preciate the degree of improvising possible when 
essential items are missing, and the logical se-
quence to be followed in interpretation of informa-
tion. Above all, they must never forget that the 
product has no value unless it can be used. The 
critical factors of time and space in modern war-
fare subject them to a great amount of production 
under pressure. 
To say that intelligence workers are made, not 
born, implies that there are no substitutes for 
CONFIDENTIAL 
14 
training, continuous study, conscientious effort, 
and years of experience. As in other fields, the 
mechanics of training are not enough; the motiva-
tion must come from the worker himself. No out-
side assistance can be of real value without a 
determination on the part of the individual to 
become not just another intelligence worker but 
the very best. 
Although he may be a specialist in a particular 
field, the intelligence officer must develop an ap-
preciation of the other fields which comprise the 
sum total of intelligence knowledge. With this 
appreciation, he can more effectively direct his 
own efforts. Training must encourage that har-
mony of effort so important for the success of 
any organization. 
Learning through doing is another important 
training requirement. Painstaking, detailed work 
is part of the routine, a necessary preliminary to 
exciting accomplishment. A continuous training 
program can help to define the goals and objec-
tives. Such a program must also include Reserve 
personnel. 
Indoctrination in security measures for han-
dling classified material is an essential part of 
training. The intelligence officer must not only 
be thoroughly familiar with the regulations as set 
forth in the Navy's Security Manual for Classified 
Matter, but he must also have a real appreciation 
of their guiding principle, that classified material 
is made available only on a "need to know" basis. 
Intelligence personnel can provide accurate knowl-
edge regarding a problem only if they have access 
to all data bearing on that problem. If the clas-
sification of certain data restricts availability, 
knowledge will be incomplete and false conclu-
sions may be drawn. Intelligence officers, there-
fore, rank high on the list of those who need to 
know. 
There seems to be no question but that training, 
and continued training, is of inestimable value for 
developing the highest caliber of personnel to 
produce the highest caliber of intelligence. A 
program of training for reserve military person-
nel in peacetime has assumed more importance 
because of the rapidity with which the military 
services must expand in the event of total war. 
If military intelligence organizations are to be 
sufficiently flexible to continue adequate and effi-

INTELLIGENCE: A GENERAL ORIENTATION CONFIDENTIAL 
cient production of intelligence under wartime con-
ditions, there must be a substantial reserve force, 
well trained, which can be activated in a minimum 
time interval. Since World War II, the develop-
ment of a permanent intelligence corps in each 
branch of the Armed Forces represents a step 
toward improving this situation. While the ac-
complishments of reserve personnel in World War 
II were phenomenal, considering the fact that 
their training was carried out "on the job," mis-
takes were made. Modern warfare has reduced 
materially the available time to recover from mis-
takes. Only training can maintain reserve mili-
tary personnel at a degree of efficiency which will 
permit them when called upon to contribute ef-
fectively to the production of intelligence. 
Undoubtedly, one of the most difficult aspects of 
training is that of method in intelligence produc-
tion. This term, production, brings our discus-
sion to the third connotation of the word 
"intelligence." 
INTELLIGENCE AS PRODUCTION 
"Intelligence involves the collecting of infor-
mation, its processing, and the disseminating of 
the resultant knowledge to those who need it." 
In this illustrative statement, intelligence means 
production. The production effort, known as the 
intelligence cycle, includes collection, processing, 
and dissemination. Since the cycle is the subject 
of later chapters, only certain general comments 
need to be made here. A technical intelligence 
vocabulary has been developed to apply to the 
various phases of production. Different terms 
are sometimes used by different organizations to 
describe the same working tools, working proce-
dures, and mental processes, but if the basic proc-
esses involved are kept clearly in mind, confusion 
over definitions can easily be avoided. 
If the intelligence cycle is to be effective, there 
must be careful planning and firm direction to the 
production effort. Priorities in collection must 
be established, and a continuing program of 
guidance instituted for economic and efficient op-
eration throughout all phases of the cycle. Intel-
ligence organizations must be kept informed of 
overall plans and policies so that everything they 
do will have meaning and value. 
15 
Emphasis on the collection phase of intelligence 
production has resulted in the use of special terms 
to describe sources of information. For example, 
covert intelligence refers to information obtained 
by secret means, through spies or undercover 
agents, without the consent of the country in-
volved. While it is this type of collection which 
has given intelligence activity the flavor of ad-
venture and mystery, by far the greater amount 
of information is derived from sources available 
to anyone who knows how and where to look. 
Such sources include the newspapers, periodicals, 
governmental and business reports, radio broad-
casts, and diplomatic representatives. Informa-
tion gained from such sources is often called overt 
intelligence. 
Intelligence Collection in Time of Peace 
It is readily apparent that the collection of in-
formation and the production of intelligence in 
peacetime is facilitated because information is 
customarily more easily available than in war-
time. With the exception of some areas con-
trolled by totalitarian states, data can be collected 
the world over to provide the encyclopedic knowl-
edge which forms the broad base of intelligence. 
It is in such periods that Intelligence can make 
its greatest contribution to the nation by pro-
ducing knowledge which can be used to thwart 
the nonmilitary aggression of other states, to pre-
vent surprise, and to avoid devastating military 
conflict. 
In preparing for total war and avoiding sur-
prise, collecting information, and developing 
knowledge regarding the scientific and technical 
advances of other nations assume particular sig-
nificance. Science has always been applied to the 
perfecting of weapons of war. The improvement 
of old weapons and the invention of new ones 
have progressed rapidly since World War II. 
Never before has the fate of nations been sus-
pended so precariously in the balance or depended 
so completely on the efforts of scientists racing 
against time. The increasing range of weapons 
and new tactics in their employment have brought 
home to the United States the awesome prospect 
of being caught by surprise. Ignorance might be 
a deciding factor in total war; intelligence is the 
weapon which must combat it.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
The importance of intelligence in peacetime is 
well known to the French. The Prussian collec-
tion effort, prior to the Franco-Prussian War of 
1870, was so thorough that Bismarck's armies 
practically walked into Paris. The Nazi suc-
cesses prior to World War II provide more recent 
and equally appropriate examples. 
Intelligence Collection in Time of War 
The collection of information in time of war is 
accomplished by methods which are usually more 
costly in terms of men, money, and materiel. The 
enemy, once identified, expends even greater efforts 
to deny information regarding himself or to con-
trovert this information for the purposes of 
deception. 
Clausewitz pointed out the difficulties of war-
time collection when he said: "A great part of 
the information obtained in war is contradictory, 
a still greater part is false, and by far the greatest 
part is somewhat doubtful. What is required of 
an officer in this case is a certain power of dis-
crimination, which only knowledge of men and 
things and good judgment can give. The law of 
probability must be his guide." 
In time of war, collection is aided by such opera-
tional means as aircraft, submarines, reconnais-
sance patrols, ships, and by the interrogation of 
prisoners. Photography then becomes an indis-
pensable means of collection, and a source of 
knowledge for both strategic and operational pur-
poses. The accurate interpretation of photo-
graphs reveals both the activities of the enemy and 
the terrain characteristics of the area of opera-
tions. Because the factor of time has assumed 
such importance, continuing efforts are being made 
to develop techniques which will speed the trans-
mission of photographic information from its 
source to those who can interpret and dissem-
inate it. 
The numerical requirements for trained intelli-
gence personnel rise sharply in wartime. In the 
case of the Navy alone, hundreds of additional 
officers and enlisted men must be assigned to the 
expanded fleet organization, flag staffs, motor tor-
pedo boat, and air squadrons; to intelligence cen-
ters and advanced base units; to sea frontiers and 
naval districts; to naval attache posts; and to 
joint or combined military staffs. Rapid expan-
CONFIDENTIAL 
16 
sion can be accomplished only if there are sub-
stantial well trained reserve groups which can be 
quickly activated. To insure the continuous flow 
of intelligence production, however, adequate 
numbers must be employed at all times, in peace 
as well as war. The curtailment of this produc-
tion can be as disastrous to the nation as the 
failure to keep pace with the development of 
physical weapons. 
Processing Information 
The collection of information is a time-consum-
ing and expensive operation. It can be an almost 
futile effort unless its results can be converted into 
usable knowledge. This conversion phase is much 
more than the physical handling or rearrangement 
of information received; it involves original think-
ing as well as logical thought processes. Ob-
viously, many difficulties arise in large organi-
zations where volumes of factual material must 
be so catalogued and disposed that interrelation-
ships can be studied and new meanings derived. 
Processing data may be compared to refining 
crude oil. The oil is subjected to many stages of 
cracking; at each stage a different substance is 
developed; until, at the final stage, a new product 
is created. So it is with the processing of in-
formation. When received, the original informa-
tion is studied. From this study, first conclusions 
are drawn. These conclusions are then studied in 
connection with those supplied by other basic data. 
At each stage of study, the subject material is 
transformed into a new conclusion. As in the oil 
cracking process, each stage must follow a logi-
cal sequence. For ready reference at each stage 
of production, a complete and systematic filing 
system is essential. At no point, however, can 
any study or solution be considered as irrevocably 
definitive, in view of the fact that it concerns the 
activities of men in which there is constant 
change. Therefore, no conclusion may be said to 
be final; each is subject to possible change. Of 
course, material dealing with certain physical con-
ditions, such as terrain, are the least subject to 
change. 
A basic problem of production is that the in-
formation received may be incomplete and con-
tradictory, requiring the application of the most 
searching standards of proof for all conclusions.

INTELLIGENCE: A GENERAL ORIENTATION CONFIDENTIAL 
The processing phase itself is a delicate operation 
and subject to errors resulting from the omission 
of necessary comparisons, the inclusion of false 
data, or failure to follow a logical sequence. The 
problems of processing and the application of 
scientific methods in intelligence production will 
be discussed at more length in a later chapter. 
Intelligence Action 
In the military services, intelligence is a staff 
function operating as an adjunct of the com-
mander. Intelligence takes a vigorous part in 
helping to formulate the action which will be 
taken by or in the name of the commander. In-
telligence, therefore, is not an action agency, if 
by the term is meant chain of command authority. 
However, action, and plenty of it, is involved 
constantly in the collection of information and in 
the prompt dissemination of intelligence to those 
who need it. Skillful action also is required in 
countering the intelligence efforts of potential ene-
mies, as exemplified by the activities of the Army's 
Counter Intelligence Corps. 
To be stressed is the fact that Intelligence must 
maintain a positive and aggressive point of view, 
together with a keen sense of responsibility for its 
part in any action which will be taken. Intel-
ligence personnel can never retire from the scene 
of decision after presenting their recommenda-
tions; they continue to function after decisions are 
made and often become a part of action taken. 
CONCLUSION 
The purpose of this chapter has been to acquaint 
the naval officer with the meaning and significance 
of intelligence. It has been emphasized that in-
telligence is one great body of knowledge, used 
for a variety of vital purposes. It is the result 
of skillful production by organizations composed 
of carefully trained personnel, and in the right 
hands at the right time, it provides a sound basis 
for diplomatic and military decisions affecting the 
welfare and security of the nation. Such intel-
ligence, coordinated at the highest governmental 
level, is of common concern to more than one or-
ganization and transcends the exclusive com-
petence of any one part of the total system. 
It must not be assumed, however, that Intel-
ligence is infallible or that it can provide all neces-
sary knowledge. The most desirable situation 
would be the presentation of the precise intentions 
of potential enemies: when and where and with 
what means they plan to strike. Because such 
precise knowledge is seldom obtainable, Intelli-
gence strives to provide the closest approximation. 
Limitations of Intelligence 
Intelligence is not without its limitations, the 
first being that information regarding potential 
enemies is often incomplete and inaccurate. While 
a vast amount of information is available for col-
lection, the most vital is obviously concealed to 
the greatest degree possible. Often, incorrect in-
formation is made available for purposes of de-
ception, and its true identification requires both 
skill and experience. Since he seldom knows the 
enemy's specific objectives, the collector of infor-
mation does not always grasp the significance of 
what he gathers, and his reports become meaning-
ful only when collated with other data by the 
intelligence producing unit. 
A second limitation arises from incomplete un-
derstanding of our own plans and objectives. In 
the field of national affairs, this limitation is 
caused by the fact that the United States is still 
trying to interpret its own position of world lead-
ership and to formulate specific objectives which 
can aid the world today in the struggle against 
the threat of global conflict. In the field of mili-
tary command, Intelligence will be limited by the 
extent of its knowledge of the commanders' plans 
and problems. 
A third limitation is that of personnel with suffi-
cient skills and experience. Only in recent years 
has Intelligence been considered as a professional 
field, and its personnel in general require more 
training and more practical experience. Its doc-
trines of method and procedure are still in the de-
velopmental stage. In the military services, there 
has been additional limitation of numbers, for in 
the past, Intelligence has been manned almost ex-
clusively by reservists called to duty in time of 
actual conflict. In time of so-called peace, it has 
been skeletonized to the degree that production has 
been critically limited. 
A fourth limitation of intelligence lies in the 
research process itself. An error in basic data, if 
not recognized, can become magnified progres-

sively to produce entirely false conclusions. In 
intelligence work the cost of such errors may be 
measured in human life. Recognizing this limi-
tation, intelligence workers must exercise every 
effort to avoid the use of incorrect data and to re-
view most carefully the conclusions reached at 
each stage of the production effort. 
Other more specific limitations, such as those 
of the physical equipment sometimes used in the 
collection of information, will be noted in other 
sections of this text. In connection with the gen-
eral limitations indicated above, it is apparent that 
several can be reduced to a minimum and perhaps 
eliminated. The controlling factors include time, 
with its accumulation of experience, and an in-
creased understanding of the problems involved 
in intelligence production. 
The Place of Naval Intelligence 
The comprehensive body of intelligence knowl-
edge may be compared to a large pyramid, at the 
top of which are placed the most highly refined 
estimates needed for national policy decisions. 
Each contributing organization is represented by 
a cross section of the pyramid. Into these sec-
tions is channeled the raw data acquired from 
thousands of sources at home and abroad. There 
is a descending as well as an ascending flow of 
knowledge within this pyramid, as specific re-
quests for estimates are passed from the top down. 
The same holds true even within the organiza-
tional levels. There is also movement horizon-
tally between organizations on the same level. 
The speed with which the knowledge flows within 
and to the top of the pyramid depends upon the 
efficiency of the various organizations which make 
CONFIDENTIAL 
18 
up the pyramid. Because of the changing nature 
of war itself there can no longer be watertight 
compartments of knowledge nor can any one of 
these organizations be considered self-sufficient. 
Each contributes to and receives from the total 
body of knowledge. 
Naval Intelligence is an integral part of this 
pyramid. It produces what is known as depart-
mental intelligence. It contributes to the total 
body of knowledge through the use of the pro-
fessional naval training and experience of its per-
sonnel in interpreting and evaluating data con-
cerning an enemy. It provides specialized naval 
agencies particularly adaptable for the collection 
of certain types of information. It gives guid-
ance to the collection effort to assure that the in-
formation procured is relevant to the needs of 
naval planners and policy makers. It produces 
intelligence which will directly serve naval com-
manders in the solutions of their problems and 
the reaching of decisions both for overall plan-
ning and specific operations. 
While Naval Intelligence must therefore con-
tribute to the total body of knowledge, it must 
also utilize those parts of the total body of 
knowledge which directly or indirectly affect the 
successful accomplishment of its assigned respon-
sibilities. The same applies to all other organi-
zations of our national intelligence system. The 
only difference is one of emphasis. 
For these reasons, the scope of this text is neces-
sarily large, in order that it may serve at least 
two purposes: to indicate to the naval officer the 
broad body of knowledge with which he must be 
familiar, and to point out the specific naval uses 
of this knowledge.

CHAPTER 2 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
INTRODUCTION 
Intelligence is neither new nor peculiar to mod-
ern times, whether it be interpreted as knowledge, 
as organization, or as production. While the em-
phasis on its many aspects has varied from time 
to time, intelligence has always existed in one form 
or another. Ever since men organized themselves 
into community groups they have sought for var-
ious reasons to dominate other groups, by means 
of military force or by political or economic 
measures backed by military force. Whatever the 
means employed, advance information about the 
enemy, when collected and processed, has been used 
to advantage from time to time throughout re-
corded history. 
The story of armed combat is fundamentally a 
record of the historical evolution of military or-
ganization: from primitive men who fought as 
independent individuals with stones and clubs to 
modern men who fight as part of an intricate mass 
machine. As the organizations grew in size, so 
did the battles fought, requiring more and more 
the use of military staffs to assist the commanders 
in planning and carrying out their decisions. The 
history of this military growth has been divided 
into three periods: the first, from the beginning 
of written records to the fall of the Roman Em-
pire, a period when military methods evolved from 
mob action into a recognized art, including prac-
tically all of the modern principles of war; the 
second, the Middle Ages, when there was almost 
no progressive military thought; and the third, 
from about 1632, the time of Gustavus Adolphus, 
to the 20th century, when modern military ma-
chines emerged. As military organization has de-
veloped, so has Intelligence. 
Thus Intelligence has a military origin. Full 
knowledge has always been essential for the suc-
cessful general. The French Marshal Maurice de 
Saxe, in recording his experiences, commented: 
"You cannot give too much attention to spies and 
guides . . . They are as useful as the eyes in your 
head and, to a general, are quite as indispensable." 
To be found in one form or another in the ancient 
writings about war is the maxim: "Other things 
being equal, victory goes to the commander with 
the latest and the best information." Political 
leaders and the governments of nations have also 
made use of intelligence since the beginning of 
recorded history. 
While both military and political leaders have 
long recognized the importance of gaining ad-
vance information, there have been times when 
they either failed to obtain it or neglected to make 
use of it. A study of military history reveals that 
many defeats in battle have resulted from failures 
to use intelligence. Indeed, there are indications 
that intelligence has had a marked effect on the 
shaping of world events. 
Illustrative of a failure to use intelligence, and 
the effect on later events, is the case of the British 
Admiral De Robeck whose Anglo-French fleet won 
a complete victory in the Dardenelles during 
World War I. As a result the Turkish Govern-
ment began the evacuation of Constantinople, and 
the Allies might have taken the city, had De Ro-
beck made any effort to obtain information about 
the enemy. In ignorance he withdrew, and con-
sequently the ill-fated and disastrous Gallipoli 
campaign was undertaken. 
A striking feature of the historical development 
of intelligence is its slow progress, shown by the 
similarity of ancient and modern methods. There 
is little difference between the instructions of 
Moses to his 12 spies who were to go into the land 
of Canaan and those of Stieber, Bismarck's In-
telligence Chief, to his agents who were to infil-
trate France. The difference is merely in the 
numbers involved. In fact, modern intelligence 
seems to have little that is really new, although 
the character of intelligence has changed from 
time to time. Before the rise of nationalism, the 
collecting of information was a trade carried on

by those whose services were at the disposal of the 
highest bidder. With the upsurge of the modern 
states, patriotism gave new motivation to the ac-
tivities of the collector. In recent times, some of 
those engaged in intelligence activities are moti-
vated solely by an ideological fanaticism which 
recognizes no national boundaries. 
It is obviously quite difficult to trace the his-
torical development of intelligence. It is seldom 
exposed to the public eye, and for reasons of se-
curity, those making use of intelligence cannot 
disclose methods, sources of information, and ex-
tent of knowledge. Available records, therefore, 
are relatively few and incomplete. 
It is clear, however, that intelligence has not 
only been the first line of any nation's defense, but 
also the springboard of offensive action aimed at 
surprise and deception. At times it has taken the 
form of a shadowy undercover war of world-wide 
proportions. As a result, the outcome of great 
battles involving armies, navies, and air forces, 
has depended upon the result of conflicts between 
intelligence organizations. These have often 
taken place long before a declaration of war, and 
have continued after the signing of an armistice. 
The intensity of the total intelligence effort be-
fore and after World War II indicates that intelli-
gence activity is of a long range and continuing 
nature. 
Intelligence has served many purposes. From 
earliest times tyrants have subverted intelligence 
organizations into repressive systems of political 
police, thus placing exaggerated emphasis upon 
domestic espionage and counterespionage. Free 
people, too, have used intelligence to advantage 
in promoting and maintaining their national inter-
ests. Historically speaking, Intelligence has not 
been the exclusive tool of armies and governments, 
for it has also been used by revolutionaries, church-
men, bankers, trade unions, and criminals. 
In this historical review, the intelligence activi-
ties of armies and governments are of primary 
interest. Much can be learned from past experi-
ences for contemporary application. 
EARLY HISTORY 
The desire for advance information about a 
prospective adversary is an instinctive character-
istic of man. Even primitive tribes, with only 
CONFIDENTIAL 
the crudest weapons and no appreciable sense of 
group discipline, carried out reconnaissance of 
their enemies. For example, before a band of 
forest Indians set forth on the warpath, their 
chiefs sent the most able warriors to learn about 
the trails and streams in the area of attack and 
to discover the numbers, disposition, and state of 
preparedness of the enemy. The early successes 
of the American Indians against numerically su-
perior and better armed white men were often the 
result of the Indians' superior, though primitive, 
system of intelligence. 
20 
Intelligence in Antiquity 
Intelligence activity is as old as war. One of 
the earliest and best known records may be found 
in the Bible. Moses selected men from each of the 
twelve tribes and sent them into Canaan with these 
instructions: "See the land, what it is; and the 
people that dwelleth therein, whether they be 
strong or weak, few or many; And what the land 
is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; 
and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether 
in tents, or in strongholds; And what the land is, 
whether it be fat or lean, whether there be 
wood therein or not." It is to be noted that he 
chose leading men to do the job, and that their 
instructions included both the characteristics of 
the enemy and the area of potential operations. 
But long before Moses, the Pharaohs of Egypt 
were receiving regular intelligence reports from 
their agents scattered beyond the valley of the 
Nile. The Egyptian army had a rudimentary 
staff organization which included an intelligence 
function, that of receiving reports from recon-
naissance units. With the Assyrian armies as 
models, the Persians under Darius made further 
advances in military organization and planning. 
Herodotus' account of their invasion of Greece 
describes the extensive preparation that preceded 
their military campaigns. A system of staff or-
ganization was developed, and there is evidence 
of the functional existence, at least, of intelligence 
officers. The soldier kings, apparently, did not 
delegate any operational functions, but kept them 
inherent in command and so they have remained 
ever since. It is also most likely that the so-called 
"intelligence officers" were primarily collectors, 
and that the early military commanders who led

THE DEVELOPMENT 
their followers into battle solved their own intelli-
gence problems and did not rely on intermediaries 
to digest information reports. However, they did 
develop extensive courier services for the rapid 
transmittal of intelligence and administrative 
reports. 
Alexander the Great inherited an efficient mili-
tary machine from his father and for thirteen 
years carried on continuous campaigns throughout 
the then-known world. While the basis for a 
military staff existed in the form of several officers 
under his personal direction, Alexander appears 
to have been his own intelligence and operations 
officer. He relied heavily on reconnaissance, 
which was essentially on operational function. 
Military postal censorship is reported to have orig-
inated with this Greek conqueror. During one of 
his expeditions into Asia he heard rumors of dis-
affection among his allies and mercenaries. In 
order to determine the true situation, he announced 
that he was writing home and encouraged his 
officers to do likewise. When all the messages had 
been collected, he examined them and proceeded to 
correct such conditions as appeared to have been 
justly criticized. 
Intelligence in Ancient India 
At about the same time that Alexander was ex-
tending his conquests, the famous Brahman, 
Kautilya, is reputed to have overthrown the 
Nanda dynasty and established the first Mauryan 
king on the throne of India. Kautilya is known 
not only as a kingmaker but also as the greatest 
Indian exponent of the art of government, the 
duties of kings, ministers, and officials, and the 
methods of diplomacy. A Sanskrit book of ad-
vice to rulers, attributed to him, reads in part 
almost as a modern manual on military and polit-
ical intelligence. It emphasizes the fact that a 
highly organized intelligence service is essential 
to the state and of first consideration in both peace 
and war. In discussing the expansion and se-
curity of the state Kautilya says, " . . . he who 
has the eye of knowledge . . . can, with little ef-
fort, make use of his skill for intrigue, and can 
succeed by means of conciliation and other strate-
gic means and by spies . . . in overreaching even 
those kings who are possessed of enthusiasm and 
power." 
OF INTELLIGENCE 
21 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Kautilya recommends that his ruler should first 
strike the enemy at his weak points by means of 
spies. In describing the means to conquer an en-
emy's stronghold, he lists first "intrigue, spies," 
and "winning over the enemy's people." "Siege 
and assault" are last on the list. Although his 
terminology is a bit obscure, he accurately de-
scribes the modern fifth column and Soviet sub-
versive activities when he says: "The arrow shot 
by the archer may or may not kill a single man; 
but skillful intrigue devised by wise men can kill 
even those as yet unborn." Distrust and suspi-
cion are powerful weapons when forged within 
an enemy country. 
Before beginning a military operation, Kautilya 
advises: "The conqueror should know the compar-
ative strength and weakness of himself and his 
enemy" and no war should be undertaken without 
a careful examination of all the factors as reported 
by the king's spies. These factors could well serve 
as an outline for an estimate of the situation pre-
pared by a modern military staff. "Having ascer-
tained the power, place, time, the time of march-
ing and of recruiting the army, the consequences, 
the loss of men and money, and profits and dan-
ger," the conqueror "should march with his full 
force." Kautilya divides the king's army into 
five parts: elephants, chariots, horsemen, archers, 
and spies and of these he considers the spies the 
most important. 
The spy system of the Mauryans apparently 
rivaled that of the modern Soviets. It included 
many classes, both military and political, operat-
ing within India and in adjoining countries. One 
class shadowed the king's ministers and officials 
and attempted to determine their very thoughts. 
Another, drawn from the merchants and farmers, 
reported on the wrongdoings of the people. A 
third, whose sons and wives were kept at home 
as hostages, operated secretly in foreign countries, 
spreading unrest, committing acts of sabotage, and 
even assassinating political and military leaders. 
Official envoys to foreign kings were instructed 
to make friends with officials of the enemy, to con-
trast military stations, war material and enemy 
strongholds with those of their master, to deter-
mine the size and location of forts, to identify local 
intrigues, to sow dissension, and to determine en-
emy intentions.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Counterspies and watchmen were employed; 
there were border guards to check on all who 
attempted to enter or to leave; and travelers had 
to have passes. In order to dispose of seditious 
persons who opposed the king, these persons were 
secretly incited to reckless action and then con-
demned. Kautilya reminded his king that he 
would be able to know all things through his spy 
system, and that his information should be con-
sidered reliable if received from three different 
sources in exactly the same version. He also em-
phasized the importance of the speedy transmis-
sion of information. The Mauryan Empire of 
India appears to have been a police state in the 
most modern sense. 
Kautilya's book seems to have been a standard 
manual for the Mauryan rulers, and to have been 
based on experience. A study of the methods of 
this ancient dynasty, which was able to conquer 
and hold a greater part of India, sheds consider-
able light on the intelligence operations of any 
despotic state. 
Intelligence and War in Ancient China 
It is indicative of the early development of 
civilization in Asia that outstanding military and 
political leaders were recording their experiences 
and knowledge long before the same was done in 
Europe. About Kautilya's time in India, a 
Chinese General named Sun Tzu wrote a treatise 
on the Art of War which was so sound that its 
principles may be easily adapted to modern war-
fare. Sun Tzu discussed the fundamentals of 
war and the influence of politics and human na-
ture on military operations. His writings indi-
cate, in a striking manner, how unchanging these 
fundamentals are. 
Writing as a field commander on the subject of 
strategy and tactics, Sun Tzu emphasized the im-
portance of terrain study and accurate informa-
tion about enemy strength and intentions. He 
stressed maneuver and deception and the attain-
ment of victory by indirect methods. Like 
Kautilya, he recommended battle only as a final 
resort and placed primary importance on a good 
intelligence service: "A hundred ounces of silver 
spent for information may save ten thousand 
spent on war." His formula for victory aptly 
states the basic reason for maintaining an intelli-
CONFIDENTIAL 
22 
gence service: "If you know the enemy and know 
yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred 
battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, 
for every victory gained you will also suffer a 
defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor your-
self, you will succumb in every battle." 
Sun Tzu warns against information derived 
from appearances alone, and accepts only that 
which is obtained from intelligence agents. Most 
effective are those who have penetrated the high 
councils of the enemy and the operators whom 
we now term "double-agents." In addition, it is 
profitable to employ inhabitants of an enemy 
country to act as local spies, and to have other 
agents spreading false rumors for purposes of de-
ception. Finally, there must be spies in the 
enemy forces to be firsthand sources of informa-
tion. In selecting intelligence personnel Sun 
Tzu would employ only those with natural abil-
ity and of high mental caliber. He continues 
with the observation that if military warfare be-
comes necessary, "spies are a most important ele-
ment, because on them depends an army's ability 
to move." Another Sun Tzu maxim has been 
heeded by both Nazi and Soviet leaders of recent 
years: "To fight and conquer in all your battles 
is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence 
consists in breaking the enemy's resistance with-
out fighting." 
Developments by the Romans 
Quite independent of the Oriental generals, but 
about the same time, the Romans were developing 
their own military organization and doctrine in 
Europe. By the time of Julius Caesar the staff 
of each legion included ten "speculatores" who 
served as an information collecting agency. 
Caesar's successful campaign against the Helve-
tians was aided materially by advance information 
he acquired about their strength, movements, and 
plans. The "speculatores" are the first intel-
ligence personnel to appear definitely in a military 
staff organization, and there is evidence that the 
Romans differentiated between the staff functions 
of intelligence and operations. This early dis-
tinction was not "re-discovered" by military com-
manders until relatively modern times. 
The military success of the Romans was also 
aided by their communications system. Frontinus

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
and Lipsius, in their writings, describe the train-
ing of swallows as long distance messengers and 
the use of carrier pigeons, which explains the 
amazing speed with which the intelligence of Im-
perial Rome was transmitted. An efficient intel-
ligence organization was thus able to give warning 
of an impending surprise offensive by Hannibal 
and Antiochus in Asia Minor in time to enable 
Lucius Scipio to regroup his forces and administer 
a crushing defeat at Lydia. The Romans also em-
ployed ciphers to ensure the secrecy of communica-
tions. 
Skillful covert operations were of positive mili-
tary value. Scipio Africanus used his officers dis-
guised as menials and servants to secure reliable 
data on the strength of the opposing Numidian 
army. His methods have a peculiarly modern 
flavor since, in order to gain time for accurate ob-
servations, he entered into negotiations with the 
Numidians, presumably to arrange a treaty. 
In the following centuries of Roman imperial-
ism, intelligence continued to be fostered by the 
emperors, and covert activities were practised to 
an unscrupulous and vicious degree in palace cir-
cles. Vegetius, in his advice to the Emperor Vu-
lentinian, states that a general may avoid defeat 
if he employs spies on whose intelligence he can 
depend. Like the military writers of Asia, he em-
phasized the importance of trying to sow dis-
sension among enemy peoples, and comments that 
no enemy nation, regardless of how weak, can 
be completely ruined "unless its fall be facilitated 
by its own distraction." 
The professional army of the Byzantine Empire 
also had a well organized intelligence service. 
Much more colorful, however, was the elaborate 
spy system of the Empress Theodora which per-
meated the entire governmental structure of the 
Empire. It should be noted that the oriental mind 
has always appeared to stress political over mili-
tary intelligence. 
The Middle Ages 
Military intelligence in this period of chivalry 
was of little consequence to warriors for whom 
fighting was an individual sport. On the other 
hand, the Mongol conquerors who swept into east-
ern Europe from Asia during the 13th century 
made use of not only an efficient intelligence sys-
tem but also of an effective propaganda machine. 
Agents of the Mongol commanders ranged far in 
front of the invading hordes spreading rumors 
of Mongol terrors and collecting information on 
the weaknesses and rivalries of Europe. Local 
citizens were used to advantage. The Venetians, 
for example, striving to gain superiority over their 
rivals, supplied information to the Mongols in 
return for help in ousting Genoese traders from 
the Crimea. 
In addition to agents disguised as merchants, 
the Mongol commanders maintained a screen of 
scouts in front of each column of soldiers. They 
appreciated the need for the rapid transmission of 
information, and established a pony post system 
across the whole of eastern Europe. The code of 
laws set up by Genghis Khan instructed his gen-
erals to send out spies and to bring in prisoners 
who would be forced to give information which 
could be checked against the reports of the spies. 
The Mongols provided for Western Europe an un-
heeded example of an effective military intelli-
gence and staff communication system. They 
greatly influenced the Mogul Emperors of India 
who perfected an amazing political intelligence 
service. Among the personnel of this service were 
spies who visited houses twice daily for the osten-
sible purpose of removing refuse and trash. 
Although the knights of medieval Europe 
scorned the advance collection of information 
about their enemies, the churchmen had no such 
scruples. They not only utilized already known 
intelligence collection methods but contributed 
variations of their own. De Torquemada, head 
of the Spanish Inquisition, developed a political 
intelligence system which has scarcely been 
equalled. Thousands of intimidated men, women, 
and children were encouraged to give information 
which would incriminate their own relatives and 
acquaintances. Large groups of spies were care-
fully trained, and a manual of instructions was 
prepared for their guidance. 
The Renaissance of Intelligence 
With the rise of nationalism and the develop-
ment of modern armies the need for intelligence 
became apparent to the larger states. Following

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
an Italian lead, the principal courts of Europe be-
gan to exchange resident ambassadors, one of 
whose functions was to collect information on the 
political and diplomatic activities, the plans, and 
the military strength of potential enemies. As 
time progressed an increasing volume of political 
and military intelligence, collected by covert as 
well as overt means, flowed into the various capi-
tals of Europe to be processed and filed for use 
in making important strategic decisions. 
As early as the 15th century French and German 
military organizations known as "Landsknechts," 
meaning "men of the country" as opposed to for-
eign mercenary troops, were developed. The 
staffs of these armies embodied the principal char-
acteristics of the modern regimental staff. Be-
cause the quartermaster general had to precede 
the troops on the march in order to arrange for 
quartering and feeding, he also became responsible 
for reconnaissance. This functional development 
exerted considerable influence on the German and 
English staff systems. Gustavus Adolphus of 
Sweden created a "Chief of Scouts" on his Su-
preme Staff, indicating both his awareness of the 
importance of intelligence and his realization that 
intelligence as a staff function should be separate 
from operations and logistics. It is generally 
agreed that the military organization developed 
by Gustavus served as a pattern in Europe until 
the 20th century. With him, therefore, modern 
military history began. 
While there are records of intelligence activities 
throughout English history and especially from 
the time of Cromwell and Henry VII, it was Sir 
Francis Walsingham, under Elizabeth, who gave 
England its first national intelligence service. 
His crowning achievement was the employment of 
a spy on the staff of the Admiral in command of 
the Spanish Armada. Thus he was able to ob-
tain the most detailed information regarding the 
state of readiness of the Armada, its ships, equip-
ment, forces, and stores. In addition, under Wal-
singham's guidance, the English Government per-
suaded the bankers of Genoa to withhold certain 
loans to Philip of Spain which delayed his naval 
offensive against the English. 
In France, the crafty Cardinal Richelieu de-
veloped an effective intelligence organization. It 
CONFIDENTIAL 
04 
included a network of covert collectors who trans-
mitted prompt and accurate information to Paris 
regarding the activities of the many rebellious 
and dissident elements of the kingdom. An ex-
pert in political intrigue and diplomatic maneuver, 
Richelieu used his intelligence forces to strengthen 
the central government of France. After him, 
Louis XIV consolidated his personal power by 
means of a systematized political police, continu-
ous surveillance, postal censorship, and a peace-
time military intelligence organization. The 
famous French general, Maurice de Saxe, organ-
ized an intelligence service which represented a 
considerable improvement over others of his time. 
Unlike the Germans, the French based their mili-
tary staff organization on Roman theories. As 
a result, the French staff included officers charged 
with the separate functions of supply, administra-
tion, operations, and intelligence. By 1700 the 
pattern was set for the French staff system of 
World War I, and consequently for the system 
used by the United States Army. The French 
military writers of this early period appreciated 
the value of reconnaissance in major military plan-
ning and stressed professional knowledge as in-
dispensable to national military power. 
Intelligence activity appeared in other coun-
tries during the 18th century. In Russia it took 
the form of a political police system under the 
personal supervision of the Tzar. The forerunner 
of the dreaded Ochrana was the "Special Office," 
later called the "Secret Office," which was used 
extensively by Peter the Great. In colonial Amer-
ica, Baron von Steuben served as an intelligence 
and operations officer on Washington's staff. His 
recorded intelligence activities include an analysis 
of British and American capabilities and limita-
tions and a personal reconnaissance of General 
Clinton's forces before the battle of Monmouth. 
All of the great European military leaders, in-
cluding Marlborough, Prince Eugene, Maurice de 
Saxe, and Frederick the Great, appear to have 
recognized the importance of intelligence and used 
it. Each, in his own way, contributed to its de-
velopment. Frederick the Great, for example, 
established four classes of agents for the collec-
tion of information and set up careful rules for 
selecting and training them.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
Expansion of Intelligence Activities Under 
Napoleon 
Napoleon once said: "One spy in the right place 
is worth 20,000 men in the field." The truth of 
his remark was amply substantiated by one of his 
own agents, a man named Schulmeister, who man-
aged to become the Chief of Intelligence for the 
Austrian general in command of armies opposing 
the French. Every Austrian plan and move was 
carefully reported to Napoleon, while false infor-
mation was supplied to the Austrians. Undoubt-
edly the clever machinations of Schulmeister 
contributed materially to the brilliant French vic-
tories at Ulm and Austerlitz, which led to the sur-
render of Austria. It is of interest to speculate 
on what might have been the historical results had 
Napoleon's agent failed in his efforts. 
Napoleon's personal staff included two bureaus 
of interest. The first, and most important, was 
the Bureau of Intelligence, staffed by two officers 
and an unknown number of agents. Its function 
was to consolidate all incoming information re-
garding the enemy for presentation to the Em-
peror, and to obtain such special information as 
he desired. The second, closely related to the first, 
was called the Topographic Bureau. Here was 
maintained a large situation map covering the 
latest information regarding both enemy and 
friendly forces. In the field the French Head-
quarters Staff was divided into four sections, one 
of which was responsible for reconnaissance, op-
erational planning, communications, postal serv-
ice, and the employment of guide companies. 
It was at the beginning of the 19th century that 
large conscript armies came into general use, and 
with them large scale military maneuvers. 
Napoleon's genius for efficient military organiza-
tion brought him resounding successes and tre-
mendously influenced modern military theory and 
tactics. His military staff system was much more 
effective than that of the Prussians, and Intelli-
gence served him well during a part of his spec-
tacular career. It should be noted that during 
the wars between the French and the Germans, in 
1806 and again in 1870, victory came to the side 
which had the superior staff system. It may also 
be said that victory at Waterloo came to the gen-
eral who had advance information concerning the 
enemy and the area of operations. 
289196-54-3 
25 
In addition to his military intelligence organi-
zation, Napoleon maintained an effective secret 
political police service over all of Europe. Under 
the shrewd and remorseless direction of Joseph 
Fouche, and later of Savary, this service was held 
in fear and terror. It was during this period that 
the system of spying upon spies reached such pro-
portions that the term "counterespionage" came 
into popular usage. 
Like England, France has had a governmental 
intelligence system almost continuously since the 
15th century. But only during the time of Napo-
leon, and during and after the First World War, 
did the French system achieve the international 
scope of the English. 
The Status of Intelligence in the United States 
As already mentioned there is evidence that 
General Washington made some use of intelli-
gence methods; however, there was no organiza-
tional development in the United States until the 
late 19th century. At the beginning of the Civil 
War the Federal forces had no intelligence organi-
zation, and Gen. George B. McClellan relied al-
most entirely on the Pinkerton Detective Agency 
to collect and evaluate information for him. 
Pinkerton himself served as a staff Intelligence 
Officer to McClellan, although he proved to be a 
poor substitute for a trained military observer. 
For example, in July 1862, McClellan based his 
military plans on Pinkerton's inaccurate estimate 
of Lee's strength at more than 200,000, while the 
actual opposing strength was less than 90,000. 
During the Civil War both the North and the 
South made use of spies. The tapping of tele-
graphic wires was employed for the first time. 
One writer of this period, while acknowledging 
the importance of intelligence and listing a num-
ber of recognized collection methods, felt it neces-
sary to justify them as "honorable means of secur-
ing victory over the foe." It was during the Civil 
War that the United States Secret Service was or-
ganized, first as a military activity, and later as a 
Federal Government function.

INTELLIGENCE FOR 
ern intelligence systems. His claim to fame in 
this field is based both on the quality and the ex-
tensiveness of his organization. His influence 
throughout Europe was tremendous, especially in 
France and Russia. With Stieber's assistance 
Bismarck was able with lightning speed to over-
whelm Denmark in 1861, Austria in 1866, and 
France in 1870. Even the great German General 
Moltke was amazed at the vast amount of perti-
nent military information supplied by Stieber for 
facilitating the rapid advance of the German 
armies, to the extent of making possible an accu-
rate timetable for the victorious march into 
Austria. 
Stieber's activities in Austria for the 2 years 
prior to the invasion are an early modern example 
of the German fifth column technique. Methodi-
cally he gathered information on fortifications, 
troop concentrations, and supply capacities, and 
recruited agents and saboteurs. By the time of 
the Franco-Prussian War he had an estimated 
12,000 spies scattered throughout Europe, and 
boasted that some 85 writers on French news-
papers were under his control, not to mention paid 
sympathizers among Italian, Austrian, and Eng-
lish journalists. He set up a system of military 
censorship and organized a Central Information 
Bureau for propaganda purposes. He concen-
trated on developing statistical and biographical 
knowledge, including the industrial potentials of 
possible enemy states and detailed data regarding 
their politicians, diplomats, and higher civil em-
ployees. In addition to gathering information 
about roads, bridges, arsenals, fortifications, and 
lines of communication, he was interested in data 
on population, commerce and agriculture, local 
politics, and patriotism. Imitating Napoleon, he 
established the first formal system of German 
counterespionage. 
As one of Bismarck's most trusted advisers, 
Stieber organized an effective secret police system. 
He was also adept in the field of political intelli-
gence. His work in alienating Russia and France 
prior to the war with France in 1870 was highly 
effective. In 1867 he arranged for an attempt to 
be made on the life of Alexander of Russia who 
was on a diplomatic mission to Paris, but he also 
arranged to frustrate and capture the assassin. 
To cap it all, at the trial he bribed the French 
CONFIDENTIAL 
26 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
jury and obtained an acquittal. The ultimate ef-
fect was that the Russians were antagonized and 
canceled further efforts to form an alliance with 
France. 
Stieber created for Germany a superior intelli-
gence system which was feared and respected 
throughout the continent of Europe. Because of 
his influence, however, the German intelligence 
system always retained some of the characteristics 
of a police organization. 
Beginnings of Japanese Intelligence 
The Japanese early applied their imitative tal-
ents to the organization of up-to-date intelligence 
systems for both their Army and Navy. As a re-
sult, they were able to use Intelligence as an effec-
tive offensive instrument in the Russo-Japanese 
War of 1904-5 and to overwhelm its Russian coun-
terpart. The Japanese victory in this war has 
been attributed in large measure to the effective-
ness of their intelligence activities. For example, 
at Port Arthur advance information was obtained 
regarding the Russian minefields and the power 
station, transmission lines, and powerful search-
lights designed to blind the attackers. With this 
knowledge, the Japanese fleet captured the port 
with minimum losses in a remarkably short time. 
The Japanese were particularly successful in the 
speed with which they collected and transmitted 
information. 
During the 18th and 19th centuries, intelligence 
was centralized and systematized primarily at the 
highest governmental levels. It therefore had a 
political emphasis and often a secret police bias. 
In the military field, each general often served as 
his own intelligence officer and directed his own 
intelligence system. With the increasing com-
plexity of modern warfare, together with the 
added burdens imposed by larger, more diverse 
armies, greater logistical support and expanding 
areas of operations, commanders came to require 
better staff organizations, including adequate in-
telligence sections. The impact of the striking 
Prussian victories of 1867 and 1870 had a tremen-
dous effect on European military thinking and 
gave credence to the writings of such theorists as 
Berthier and Clausewitz. By 1900 the major 
European powers had developed modern staff sys-
tems and had placed intelligence on the same level

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
with personnel, operations, and logistics, designed 
to function in times of peace and war. 
The Development of the United States Intelligence 
Organization?Navy 
The improvements and expansion of the world's 
navies during the latter years of the 19th century 
caused the Navy Department to realize its need 
for information from abroad. The building of 
new ships of steel instead of wood had begun, and 
the best available technical data were required in 
order that these ships might incorporate the latest 
methods of construction and the most up-to-date 
equipment. Accordingly, in March 1882 the Sec-
retary of the Navy established by General Order 
an Office of Intelligence under the Bureau of Navi-
gation for the purpose of "systematizing the collec-
tion and classification of information for the use of 
the department, in relation to the strength and 
resources of foreign navies." The following year 
the Secretary emphasized two functions for the 
Office of Intelligence: the collection of informa-
tion regarding the progress of naval science and 
the dissemination of that information. Not only 
commanders, but all other officers, were directed 
to collect and submit appropriate professional ma-
terial to Intelligence. From the beginning, there-
fore, Intelligence was given the primary mission 
of collecting, interpreting, and disseminating in-
formation of value to the Navy. Commanders in 
chief were also directed to appoint an officer, pref-
erably of their personal staffs, to perform the 
duties of fleet intelligence officer; and com-
manders of ships were to appoint an officer of their 
command for similar duties. The emphasis was 
on positive foreign intelligence and on technical 
information such as ship construction and ord-
nance. There was some initial opposition to the 
new intelligence office from some of the Bureaus, 
but the office was soon accepted. 
Lt. T. B. B. Mason was selected to head the 
new office and was designated as the "Chief In-
telligence Officer." To him is due much credit for 
the early organization of the Office of Naval In-
telligence. He was assisted by two other officers 
in Washington, with one naval attache in London. 
In view of the fact that the office was not estab-
lished by congressional action, there were no ap-
propriations for maintenance; accordingly, clerks 
27 
CONFIDENTIAL 
and equipment were borrowed from other offices 
and bureaus. This situation existed until after 
the Spanish-American War. 
The activities of Naval Intelligence during the 
Spanish-American War are of particular interest. 
There was a broadening of responsibilities, with 
a shift in emphasis to intelligence for strategic 
and operational use. The Office of Intelligence 
prepared data on the strength of the Spanish Navy 
and the condition of Spanish home and colonial 
ports. At the same time, the attaches were au-
thorized to negotiate abroad for the purchase of 
ships and munitions of war, and six cruisers were 
purchased in this manner. In order to strengthen 
the position of attaches in collecting information 
abroad, requests for information by official for-
eign representatives in Washington were chan-
neled through the office. 
After 17 years of operation, the Office of Intelli-
gence was established on a permanent basis by 
Congress in 1899, with regular appropriations for 
carrying on its work. It was charged with ob-
taining information concerning the latest con-
struction and equipment of warships during 
peacetime, and producing knowledge of the 
strength and disposition of enemy forces in time 
of war. It was to assist in maintaining the Navy 
in a proper state of readiness for naval operations 
and in providing knowledge to aid in the conduct 
of hostilities. 
The administrative responsibility for the Of-
fice of Intelligence was shifted a number of times 
during the first 30 years of its existence: from the 
Bureau of Navigation, to the Office of the Secre-
tary, to the Office of the Assistant Secretary, back 
to the Bureau of Navigation, and to the Office of 
the Aide for Operations. Finally, in 1915, when 
a Chief of Naval Operations was created by law, 
the Office of Naval Intelligence was established 
permanently as one of the divisions under Naval 
Operations. 
During its formative years the Office of Naval 
Intelligence was organized on the basis of the sub-
ject matter with which it was concerned: there 
were desks devoted to ships, ordnance, personnel, 
communications, and steam engineering and elec-
tricity. At this time technical information took 
precedence. One early Intelligence publication 
was entitled "Coal, Docking and Repair Facilities

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
of the Ports of the World: With Analysis of Dif-
ferent Kinds of Coal." 
At various times prior to 1900 the Chief Intel-
ligence Officer had additional responsibilities, such 
as: translation of foreign documents, preparation 
of the War Plans of the Navy and the Auxiliary 
Naval Force. Intelligence also prepared various 
kinds of information reports for the Naval Bu-
reaus and for the Naval committees of Congress. 
In 1889 the regular report of the Secretary of the 
Navy included the following comment regarding 
Intelligence: "Its value to naval legislation and 
to naval administration is now fully recognized." 
Prior to World War I the development of a com-
prehensive intelligence organization was slow, and 
serious problems arose in connection with the 
availability of trained officer personnel. As a re-
sult civilian employees were used as much as pos-
sible to permit continuity of effort. 
Since collection was a basic responsibility of 
Naval Intelligence, the collectors assumed an early 
importance. The United States Navy sent its first 
attache to London in 1882, the year the Office of 
Intelligence was established. One additional at-
tache was later accredited to France, Russia, and 
Germany. As late as World War I, the Director 
of Naval Intelligence expressed the opinion that 
his office existed largely for the support of the at-
tache system. As official agents for collection 
purposes, the naval attaches were cautioned to use 
reputable business methods. Adequate financial 
support was a major problem, and officers volun-
teered for attache duty with full knowledge that 
their expenses would exceed their pay and allow-
ances. This situation soon created a prejudice 
against these posts and rendered difficult the as-
signment of qualified officers. 
The Development of the United States Intelligence 
Organization?Army 
The Army's Attache System dates from 1889. 
However, prior to World War I, the military at-
taches received little guidance or support; nor is 
it certain that the information they collected was 
properly disseminated. As in the case of the 
Navy, financial support was a serious problem and 
the selection of officers as attaches was often a 
haphazard matter governed either by personal ac-
quaintance or by the availability of an officer with 
CONFIDENTIAL 
28 
a personal income which would enable him to 
meet the expenses of diplomatic life in a foreign 
capital. 
The importance of intelligence to the Army was 
emphasized by Mr. Elihu Root when in 1902, as 
Secretary of War, he argued for the creation of an 
Army General Staff. In this connection he said: 
The Commanding Officer "must determine at what 
points and by what routes the place shall be ap-
proached, and at what points his troops shall 
land . . . ; and for this purpose he must be in-
formed about the various harbors of the island 
and the depth of their channels; what classes of 
vessels can enter them; what the facilities for 
landing are; how they are to be attacked; the 
character of the intervening country; how far it 
is healthful or unhealthful; what the climate is 
likely to be at the season of the proposed move-
ment; the temper and sympathies of the inhabit-
ants . . ." 
Primarily as a result of Mr. Root's efforts, the 
Congress created in 1903 an Army General Staff 
with three major divisions: Administration, Mili-
tary Information, and War College and Military 
Studies. In subsequent years new divisions were 
established and Intelligence was placed under the 
War College. The few officers assigned to Intel-
ligence before World War I had a constant strug-
gle against prejudice, a half-hostile tradition, and 
inadequacies of operating facilities. Such intel-
ligence effort as was possible was confined to col-
lection, with little processing or dissemination. 
As late as April 1917 the Army's Intelligence Sec-
tion consisted of only 2 officers and 2 clerks. 
Such was the status of military intelligence in 
the United States just prior to the First World 
War. By contrast, the major European powers 
at the same time had military intelligence organi-
zations operating as general staff divisions. 
WORLD WAR I 
The many tensions which had been building up 
for 50 years finally exploded in World War I. 
Perhaps some of them were observed by various 
intelligence groups, especially during the fateful 
year of 1913. Some writers have suggested that 
certain situations, such as the Austro-Balkan con-
flicts, might have been averted had intelligence

knowledge and organization been properly ex-
ploited. 
In any event, the various military intelligence 
services of Europe all believed themselves to be 
prepared to handle any situation, but they were 
not prepared for a long general war. Suddenly 
they found themselves short of trained personnel, 
and without sufficient funds. Their peace-time 
efforts had not been adequate. The German sys-
tem was coasting on its past reputation, while the 
Russians had never developed a modern or ef-
ficient system. Although British Intelligence was 
small, it had a nucleus of organization and a back-
ground of experience capable of rapid expansion. 
French Intelligence, in the first critical days of the 
war, failed in its estimate of enemy strength. It 
did not anticipate the possibility of early German 
use of reserves, which put twice as many troops 
against the French armies as had been estimated. 
General Joffre's battle plan was based on this 
erroneous estimate and had to be completely re-
vised, practically at the time of actual conflict. 
Belgian Intelligence, activated as late as 1912, 
collected vital information on the new German 
siege guns, the capabilities of which indicated 
serious weaknesses in the Belgian defenses at Ant-
werp, Liege, and Namur. However, the General 
Staff considered the reconstruction of these de-
fenses too expensive and too time-consuming to 
be worth the effort. In addition, it was believed 
inadvisable to disturb their popular King with 
such bad news. The high command was also in-
formed by Intelligence of the presence near the 
Belgian border of a German force of six brigades 
with a mass of artillery. The German tactical 
surprise at Liege, therefore, cannot be credited as 
much as a German success as an Allied failure to 
take proper countermeasures. Failures attributed 
to Intelligence have often been failures of a high 
command to utilize the intelligence available to it. 
As an additional example, at the Battle of St. 
Quentin the British Army suffered its most shat-
tering defeat of World War I. At the same time, 
it had available the most elaborate collection sys-
tem to be found in an area of combat. 
The nature of this war, of course, determined 
the pattern of intelligence activities. Develop-
ments in transportation?the railroad and the 
motor truck?made possible the use of large ar-
29 
mies and permitted the movement of sufficient 
ammunition and supplies to support the great ar-
tillery battles and the masses of men engaged in 
trench warfare. This tactical situation, in which 
the defensive position was stronger than the of-
fensive, resulted in the static kind of warfare 
characteristic of World War I. Discipline, train-
ing, and tactics were important factors in deter-
mining victory. Intelligence, therefore, concen-
trated on information about the armed forces of 
the enemy and their capabilities. 
The introduction of aircraft as implements of 
war added a new method of collection: aerial 
reconnaissance. Both the area of operations and 
the activities of the enemy behind the battlelines 
were brought into focus for observation, report-
ing, and use. 
A Cryptographers' War 
The employment of great armies over broad 
areas increased the requirements of communica-
tions. These were met by the perfection of wire-
less telegraphy. Codes and ciphers assumed a 
new significance and intelligence found an ex-
panded field of operations. In fact, from the 
intelligence standpoint, World War I has been 
described as a cryptographers' war. At times the 
outcome of land and sea battles was determined 
in advance of actual conflict by those who inter-
cepted and broke the enciphered operational mes-
sages of the enemy. 
Several examples will be given in a later dis-
cussion of communications intelligence, but two 
can be mentioned here because of their particular 
impact on the course of the war. At an early 
stage of hostilities two Russian armies, the First 
and the Second, were advancing separately against 
East Prussia, with the objective of joining forces 
for an attack against Hindenburg's army which 
was numerically superior to each, but inferior to 
their combined strength. The First Army failed 
to receive the field communications code which 
both were to use and was forced to send in plain 
language a message advising that it would be 
delayed three days in joining the Second. On the 
basis of this intercepted information, Hinden-
burg attacked and massacred the Second Army in 
the famous Battle of Tannenberg; then crushed 
the First Army 3 weeks later. Russia never re-

covered from this action and gradually slid into 
ruin and revolution. 
Early in 1917 the German ambassador to Mexico 
was given secret instructions to negotiate an al-
liance with Japan in order to promote an attack 
by that country on the United States, with the aid 
of Mexico. As her reward Mexico was to receive 
three of the American States. This secret mess-
age known as the Zimmerman note, was intercepted 
and broken by the British who gave it to the Amer-
icans. This incident had much to do with bring-
ing the United States into the war. 
A War of Spies and Agents 
Many tales have been told of the colorful per-
sonalities in World War I who worked secretly to 
obtain information or to protect it. The story 
of Mata Hari, the exotic dancer and condemned 
spy, has come to epitomize the romantic and ad-
venturous secret operative and to give the general 
public its strongest impression of those associated 
with intelligence activity. In spite of this fact, 
her actual effectiveness as an agent is considered 
questionable. There were agents, however, whose 
work was of considerable importance. 
One of the better known was Capt. Franz von 
Rintelen, a German agent who contributed in no 
small measure to impeding the flow of American 
supplies to the British prior to the entry of the 
United States into the war. With a talent for or-
ganization, he promoted pro-German and anti-
British sentiment in this country. His efforts on 
the New York waterfront were particularly suc-
cessful. There his ingenious sabotage caused 
ships bound for England to blow up or catch fire. 
Labor unions were goaded into crippling strikes 
against production and war shipping. A phoney 
supply firm was organized which took several 
million dollars of Russian money for war material 
which was subsequently destroyed at sea. 
The Middle East was the scene of widespread 
and significant underground activity, German ver-
sus British. In Persia a German agent named 
Wassmuss was so effective that four B ritish war-
ships and several thousand troops were eventually 
dispatched to curtail his efforts. On the other 
hand, Lawrence of Arabia organized and con-
trolled local tribes so effectively that he had more

value to the British than many thousands of 
soldiers. 
According to Gen. Maximilian Ronge, director 
of the Austrian Intelligence Service, secret agents 
were able to advise the enemy well in advance 
of every major attack that was projected in World 
War I. However, military high commands re-
peatedly failed to take advantage of this vital in-
formation. One interesting example is the Battle 
of Caporetto which the Austrians mounted against 
the Itrilians in October 1917. From the Austrian 
point of view, this battle was their most successful 
surprise attack of the entire war. It combined 
sound military judgment and thorough prepara-
tions with a skillful offensive use of intelligence. 
Weeks in advance of the battle information was 
gathered regarding critical adverse political con-
ditions existing within the civilian population in 
northern Italy. This information was dissemi-
nated to the Italian front line troops just before 
the battle by means of carefully initiated Italian 
newspapers. Espionage, counterespionage, cen-
sorship, and propaganda were all employed in this 
operation. The effect was devastating and the 
Italians lost 600,000 men as casualties and pris-
oners. The success of this engagement, however 
was not the result of surprise. The Italian gen-
eral had been fully warned of the intentions of the 
Austrians from several sources, including Ameri-
can Military Intelligence. It was successful be-
cause the Italians failed to act. 
The Myth of German Intelligence 
In 1914 German Intelligence still enjoyed a high 
reputation for offensive effectiveness throughout 
Europe. However, in the absence of strong lead-
ership supported by the government in power, the 
formidable organization created by Steiber under 
Bismarck had deteriorated badly. In addition, 
the German Imperial Staff was so confident of a 
quick victory that it could see no need for 
Intelligence. 
Actually, at the outset of the war the German 
military intelligence system broke down. From 
1906 it had concentrated its collection efforts in 
Russia and France. Its work was seriously handi-
capped by inadequate financial support, lack of 
trained personnel, and active opposition from the 
diplomatic corps and other groups within the gov-
Approved For Release 2003/12/09 : CIA-RDP85G00105R000100210002-9 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
ernment. When Col. Walther Nicolai was ap-
pointed Chief of the Intelligence Service for the 
High Command in 1913, he found that there was 
no top level guidance for military intelligence. 
As a result, his organization did not understand 
the political and economic factors involved in its 
work. Apparently Naval Intelligence was more 
effective, but liaison was poor and there was no 
coordination. 
When war began, unlimited funds were allo-
cated to Intelligence; but, Nicolai commented 
afterward, "money alone will not build up an In-
telligence Service." The German collection effort 
in the British Isles had been neglected because the 
High Command did not believe Britain would 
enter the war. In addition, British counterintel-
ligence was quickly able to apprehend the few 
German agents who were operating in the home 
islands. German Intelligence immediately suf-
fered a black-out of information and had no ad-
vance knowledge of the arrival in France of the 
British Expeditionary Force which joined with 
the French Army to defeat the Germans at the 
First Battle of the Marne. 
Nicolai found it necessary to reorganize military 
intelligence under the most adverse conditions. 
When appointed to his post he held the rank of 
major, and he soon found that his junior status 
was a real handicap. When war started his best 
officers were transferred to staff duty with the vari-
ous armies. The commanding general of the army 
marching through Belgium considered his intel-
ligence officers so unnecessary that he left them 
behind at Liege. 
Reasons for the initial failures of German Intel-
ligence included lack of preparedness, general 
neglect of overall responsibilities, and lack of 
foresight. Military and political leaders failed 
to recognize the importance of developing a good 
intelligence service at the right time and over-
looked the vital necessity for coordination of ef-
fort. Counterintelligence was also understaffed 
and handicapped at the start of the war, with no 
central direction, especially within Germany 
itself. 
In spite of its weaknesses and initial failures, 
German Intelligence improved materially as the 
war progressed. It achieved considerable success 
in its espionage and sabotage activities in the 
31 
CONFIDENTIAL 
United States under the direction of von Rintelen, 
and completely disrupted the French Intelligence 
Service prior to the Battle of Verdun. It aided 
the Russian revolutionary movement by transport-
ing Lenin across Germany into Russia. 
After the war was over, Nicolai wrote a de-
tailed account of the wartime problems of German 
Intelligence and the conditions under which it 
operated, stating: "Its character and methods 
. . . should be generally known if it is ever to 
succeed both in carrying out its own tasks and in 
thwarting the activities of the opposing Intelli-
gence Services. This applies also to States which 
possess no Intelligence Service, have no adequate 
idea of its importance, and do not realize how their 
people and their political freedom are threatened 
. . ." On the basis of subsequent developments, 
there is reason to believe that Adolf Hitler read 
Nicolai's book most carefully. 
French Intelligence 
The influence of Stieber in France was tremen-
dous. By 1900 the Deuxieme Bureau had been 
established as part of the General Staff System 
and made responsible for all enemy information 
and the topographical service of the command. 
The staff was composed of the following divisions: 
administration, intelligence, operations, and sup-
ply. This French system was to exert a strong 
influence on the development of the United States 
Army Staff during World War I. French naval 
attaches, unlike the British, were given direct con-
trol of the Naval Secret Service operating in their 
areas. 
A Civil Intelligence Service operated under the 
chiefs of police of the various larger cities, with 
headquarters at Paris. This service was based on 
the organization established under Napoleon III. 
Nicolai considered France as the "perfect master" 
in the field of political and military intelligence, 
"directed by a strong and deliberate power 
policy." 
Russian Intelligence 
Under the Tzars, Russian military intelligence 
had no centralized administration and suffered be-
cause of an inadequate number of personnel and 
no system for training. Full use was made of 
military attaches in the collection of information,

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
although some were compromised by disclosure of 
their undercover activities. The incompetence of 
the General Staff had a direct effect on the work 
of Intelligence which was far from consistent in 
performance. It failed in Germany, while it suc-
ceeded in Austro-Hungary. By means of black-
mail, the Russians obtained from the Chief of 
Austrian Intelligence, prior to the war, a list of 
Austrian agents operating in Russia and, more im-
portant, the complete Austrian battle plans. 
However, the Russian High Command, relying on 
this accurate information, failed to anticipate the 
probability of any changes in plans by the Aus-
trians when they learned of the treachery of their 
Chief of Intelligence. As a result the Russians al-
most lost the Battle of Lemberg in Galicia. 
Spying has always been a specialty of the Rus-
sians and they have been adept in the arts of 
counterintelligence. Using the informer system 
established in France under Napoleon as a model, 
the Ochrana perfected the employment of the 
"agent provocateur" for purposes of internal se-
curity and political repression. Some of the most 
active Russian revolutionaries were trained by the 
Ochrana. In addition, the so-called Black Cab-
inet served as a private censorship office of the 
Tzar and for a time brought under its cognizance 
even officials of the Ochrana. 
British Intelligence 
The statement has been made that the British 
entered World War I with the worst intelligence 
system in Europe and ended with the best. 
Whether the first part of the statement is true or 
not, it is apparent that the initial organization was 
small, with limited funds available. At the be-
ginning of 1914 there was a total staff of 14 to 
handle the counterintelligence section of military 
intelligence. Only 2 years earlier military staff 
doctrine had been formalized to include operations 
and intelligence functions within the same branch. 
Still earlier, the modern British Secret Service 
Department had been founded in more or less its 
present form. At the outset, however, the British 
were able to capitalize on the weaknesses of their 
opponents and to counter successfully the intelli-
gence activities of the Germans. In an amazingly 
short time sources of vital information were being 
exploited with significant results. It is quite pos-
CONFIDENTIAL 
32 
sible that the economic and financial organizations 
of the far-flung British Empire were helpful in 
developing many of these sources. 
Naval Intelligence expanded rapidly along with 
the total British Intelligence Service, achieving 
its greatest successes by means of censorship and 
its code room, the celebrated Room 40 0. B. With 
these means were combined a skillful use of covert 
agents. For example, an agent was placed in the 
German Admiralty where he had access to secret 
codes. On this agent's initiative, Admiral von 
Spec was ordered to attack the Falkland Islands. 
When the German squadron arrived it was met and 
destroyed by the waiting British. Illustrative of 
the work of the code room was an intercepted 
message which warned the British of an impend-
ing German naval attack on the eastern coast of 
England. The result was the Battle of Jutland 
which forestalled the coastal attack and crippled 
the German Grand Fleet to the extent that it re-
mained in its home ports for the balance of the 
war. The unfailing ability of Room 40 0. B. to 
break the enemy's codes aided immeasurably in 
the war against German submarines. 
By early 1918 the British Intelligence Service 
had reached a new peak of efficiency in the col-
lection of information and the production of in-
telligence. Nicolai, commenting later on British 
Intelligence, expressed the opinion that its work 
was unique and unsurpassed. The American 
Forces in Europe, which depended greatly on 
British Intelligence, regarded it as the best service 
in the world. The amazing accuracy of British 
information may be attributed in part to the ex-
treme care with which all reports were checked. 
The reporting records of all agents were kept in 
great detail in order to determine their degree 
of accuracy and reliability over long periods of 
time. Some agents, known to be employed by the 
enemy, were left at large in order that the British 
might know what the enemy wanted them to 
believe. Another basis for the strength of the 
British Service may have been its reported corps 
of covert agents scattered throughout Europe, 
quite independent of its recognized attache system. 
The British record in World War I was not 
without blemish. One failure occurred at the 
Battle of Jutland when vital information failed to 
reach the commanding officer in time to be of use.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
As a result the German fleet managed to escape 
destruction. In retrospect, the British com-
mander commented that the shore intelligence or-
ganization and the command afloat must be more 
closely linked "to insure mutual confidence and 
service." The problem, in this case, appeared to 
be one of coordination and communications. 
United States Naval Intelligence 
When war broke out in Europe the Office of 
Naval Intelligence was an organization inadequate 
for war purposes. Its personnel included 8 offi-
cers, 10 civilians, and 6 attache's. In an effort to 
keep abreast of rapidly changing conditions, Naval 
Intelligence, in 1915, established a War Informa-
tion Service to obtain military, political, and eco-
nomic information regarding potential enemies. 
At the same time, the office was reorganized on a 
functional rather than a subject matter basis. 
Four major sections were created. Section A was 
given administrative responsibilities and the con-
trol of the collection of confidential information 
at home and abroad. Section B included crypto-
graphic activities and a clipping service. Section 
C acted as a processing agency, while section D 
handled dissemination, archives, and a reference 
center. There were other sections concerned with 
translation, disbursing, filming, printing, and 
mail. For the first time, funds to carry on confi-
dential work were provided by the Congress. 
Immediately upon the entry of the United 
States into the war there was a great expansion 
in the organization and activity of Naval Intel-
ligence. The number of officers on duty jumped 
from 8 to 300, and the number of attaches was 
doubled. Since it was apparent that the intel-
ligence services of the Allies could supply full 
information regarding the enemy in the European 
theater, domestic counterintelligence became a 
principal activity. 
This work was delegated to Aides for Infor-
mation, now known as District Intelligence Of-
ficers, who were assigned to each of the Naval 
Districts. Their responsibilities included investi-
gations, plant protection, ship inspection, and 
naval personnel, both military and civilian. 
Branch Intelligence Offices were established as 
undercover agencies in large seaports and manu-
facturing centers. These offices grew to consider-
269196 54- 4 
33 
able size and accomplished much useful work. As 
an indication of the extent of naval counterintel-
ligence in the United States, over 3,000 individuals 
were actively engaged in its various activities at 
the peak of the war. Although cable and radio 
censorship was under the cognizance of Naval 
Communications, Intelligence provided consider-
able assistance. In the domestic field there was 
some conflict of interests between Naval Intel-
ligence and such other Government agencies as 
Military Intelligence, the Departments of Justice 
and Treasury, the Emergency Fleet Corporation, 
and the War Industries Board. 
Abroad, the naval attaches continued to have as 
their primary responsibility the collection of in-
formation. The quality of their work during the 
war was subject to considerable criticism, espe-
cially by staff officers assigned to United States 
Naval Forces, Europe, with headquarters in Lon-
don. Adm. W. S. Sims, in command of this force, 
was also critical of the evaluation of initial reports 
by Intelligence headquarters in Washington. At 
the same time, he fully recognized the importance 
of intelligence and stated that the "efficient and 
intelligent exercise of command is entirely de-
pendent upon information." It was his expressed 
point of view that there should be an entirely sepa-
rate Intelligence Section on a naval staff which 
would work in the closest cooperation with the 
other staff sections. He stressed the opinion that 
Intelligence should be prepared to be the first in the 
field in the event of war. Some of the criticism 
of the work of the naval attaches can undoubtedly 
be attributed to the fact that the number of per-
sonnel was inadequate to permit the satisfactory 
performance of their assigned responsibilities. It 
was also found that the personalities of officers per-
forming attache duties and their ability to work 
easily with representatives of foreign intelligence 
services were of great importance. 
United States Military Intelligence 
Col. Ralph H. van Deman, called the "father of 
American Military Intelligence," played an im-
portant role in the postwar recognition of Intel-
ligence as a separate function of the Army's Gen-
eral Staff. He was materially aided by the Sec-
retary of War, the Army's Chief of Staff, and Gen-
eral Pershing himself. The latter made Intel-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
ligence a coordinate section of his staff even before 
his forces landed in England in June 1917. The 
British, and especially the French staff systems 
influenced the staff organization of the American 
Expeditionary Forces in Europe, with the result 
that Intelligence sections were created at both 
higher and intermediate echelons. When America 
entered the war, Army Intelligence was rapidly 
expanded. 
The central office in Washington was organized 
into three branches. The positive branch was as-
signed the functions of collection, evaluation, and 
dissemination. Its responsibilities included prep-
aration of situation estimates and translation of 
documents. The negative branch carried out 
counterintelligence functions, including investi-
gations regarding disloyalty and sedition, enemy 
activities, and graft and fraud in organizations 
under the control of the War Department. 
Thousands of officers and men were engaged in 
this field. The Geographic Branch was concerned 
with the production of maps, photographs, and 
terrain studies. In addition there were sections 
for administration, collection of information by 
attaches and troops, and codes and ciphers. 
In connection with MIS, the code and cipher 
section, it should be noted that this type of work 
was almost unknown to the War Department 
prior to World War I. Its activities were many 
and varied and have been recorded in some detail 
by II. 0. Yardley in his book, The American Black 
Chamber. However, this section was regarded 
only as a wartime agency by the Director of Mili-
tary Intelligence and high Government officials, 
and was discontinued shortly after the war was 
over. During its relatively short existence, it 
demonstrated the importance of cryptography as 
an intelligence procedure essential to the success-
ful prosecution of war. 
In the European Theater there are interesting 
examples of the effectiveness of Army Intelli-
gence. One concerns the discovery of vital in-
formation on German submarine operations in the 
North Sea and around the British Isles. In Oc-
tober 1917, after a successful raid over England, 
the German zeppelin L-49 was forced down in 
France. Scraps of an operational map were ob-
tained through the persistent efforts of an Ameri-
can colonel who waded through a swamp over 
CONFIDENTIAL 
34 
which the zeppelin had traveled. The map con-
tained a code covering the North Sea and British 
Isles area. It meant little, however, until a code 
book was recovered from two American souvenir 
hunters who had rifled the cabin of the L-49 prior 
to the arrival of Intelligence representatives. 
With the map and the code book, the Allies gained 
complete data on German submarine operations 
and were able to surprise and destroy a large num-
ber of U-boats at their designated rendezvous. 
The activities of the military attaches in Eu-
rope and the military observers attached to the 
European armies during the first part of the war 
appear to have been handicapped by organiza-
tional deficiencies. In the War Department's 
Annual Report for the year 1919, the Chief of 
Staff commented that the valuable information 
gathered by these military observers was never 
properly used. During this period, the attaches 
were involved in counterintelligence work which 
proved both difficult and delicate. 
It was not until August 1918 that the Military 
Intelligence Division was established officially as 
coequal with the other Divisions of the Army 
General Staff. In commenting upon this devel-
opment, the Director of Military Intelligence 
stated that correct military information can be 
obtained only as the result of correct staff organi-
zation. He added: "Our Army now has its eyes 
open. It is the duty of every officer to study and 
support our intelligence organization in order 
that our Army eyes may never again be closed." 
At the height of its activity, near the close of the 
war, the Division in Washington was staffed by 
more than 1,200 highly specialized persons, of 
whom the majority were civilian employees. The 
field force was enlarged and improved, with rep-
resentatives in all important foreign countries, 
in the major cities of the United States, and in 
each military unit at home and overseas. Army 
Intelligence personnel were utilized by the Ameri-
can Commission during the peace negotiations in 
Paris. 
By the end of this war, there was apparent rec-
ognition of the close relationships which should 
exist between intelligence and national strategy 
and between intelligence and war planning. Brig. 
Gen. Marlborough Churchill, Director of Military 
Intelligence, wrote that national policy is based

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
on accurate predictions regarding the interna-
tional future and that war plans must be grounded 
on correct detailed information. "There is hardly 
an officer who does not realize that at a G. H. Q. 
and at the headquarters of every army, corps, di-
vision, and similar unit, G-3 cannot make good 
plans unless G-2 furnishes good information." A 
strikingly similar statement was to be made more 
than 30 years later by the Army's Chief of Staff, 
Gen. Omar Bradley, in relating his personal ex-
periences in World War II. 
Perhaps the most important single contribution 
made by the United States to the development of 
offensive intelligence method was the employment 
of aircraft to transport covert agents over the 
battlelines to and from areas under enemy control. 
In this connection, however, it should be noted 
that the head of Army Intelligence, at the end of 
the war, believed that covert agents could not be 
justified by the military in time of peace. In this 
belief he appears to have reflected the thinking then 
current among Washington officials.

In the period between World Wars I and II, 
political developments in each of the major na-
tions distinctively shaped the emphasis on and 
therefore the results of intelligence. Having 
fought a war to end all wars, the United States 
sharply curtailed its military expenditures and em-
barked upon a program of world peace. Public 
opinion was such that there was a necessary and 
rapid demobilization of both civilian and tempo-
rarily commissioned personnel. A similar situa-
tion existed in Great Britain, where a conservative 
government sought a return to the status quo. 
In France, Intelligence suffered increasingly from 
growing political corruption. On the other hand, 
restrictive political police systems became the 
foundation and support of autocratic govern-
ments in Germany, Italy, and Soviet Russia, not 
to mention other smaller countries in central and 
eastern Europe. 
The Neglect of Intelligence in the United States 
The intelligence organization which had begun 
to assume some form by the close of World War I 
deteriorated rapidly. Military Intelligence, such 
as it was, suffered from insufficient funds, lack of 
35 
CONFIDENTIAL 
appreciation or sense of responsibility on the part 
of the State, War, and Navy Departments, and, 
most of all, from a feeling by most officers that 
an Intelligence assignment was undesirable. For 
the most part, Intelligence billets were filled by 
officers awaiting retirement. Such capable officers 
as were assigned found little opportunity or en-
couragement to improve the situation. There was 
no successful effort to recruit or train new 
personnel. 
The organization of Naval Intelligence prac-
tically fell to pieces. Contributing factors were 
the general desire to return to "normalcy," and 
a feeling of antagonism toward any organization 
involving classified activities. In 1920 the Secre-
tary of the Navy assured the Congress that the 
activities of Naval Intelligence in the collection 
of information at home had been restricted and 
the office reduced to its prewar status. At the 
same time, the Director of Naval Intelligence was 
constrained to state that the activities of his of-
fice were now the same as they had been in 1882. 
The number of attaches abroad was cut dras-
tically. 
By 1938 world political conditions had stimu-
lated an increase in the number of naval attaches. 
However, the collection of information was in-
adequate and there were too few trained persons 
to process what was collected. By late 1941 the 
organization of Naval Intelligence had been ex-
panded in Washington, in the naval districts, and 
overseas. The volume of incoming information 
increased correspondingly, but the years of neg-
lect and inactivity could not be overcome so 
quickly. 
The Condition of British Intelligence 
The published records of expenditures ap-
proved by Parliament for governmental intelli-
gence organizations indicate roughly their status 
during the period from 1919 to 1939. More than 
$5,000,000 were appropriated in 1919. The fol-
lowing year operating funds were cut to about 
one fifth of that amount, and during succeeding 
years there were still further reductions. Al-
though the British had developed the best intelli-
gence organization in Europe during World 
War I, they soon found themselves with little 
more than a skeleton force, incapable of much

productive action. Fortunately, however, the 
vital nucleus was retained upon which to build 
again. 
By 1935 there were indications that British Na-
val Intelligence was active once more in the 
Mediterranean area. One of its self-revealed 
agents, Dod Orsborne, has given an interesting ac-
count of his own assignment. His purpose was 
to obtain and to transmit information about Mus-
solini's activities in Ethiopia and about the prog-
ress of events in Spain. He was disguised as the 
skipper of a boat whose appearance could be 
radically altered from sailing vessel to steam 
trawler to diesel-driven fishing boat. He landed 
agents in Spain, the Balearic Islands, Morocco, 
Algeria, and Libya and brought back vital infor-
mation to his contact at Gibraltar. His story is 
not only colorful, but also indicative of one type 
of intelligence operations in the Mediterranean 
during the period of increasing tension some years 
before the outbreak of war. 
By 1939 the funds reported as available to Brit-
ish Intelligence had been increased to more than 
$2,000,000. Once again the British were to de-
velop the most efficient intelligence organization in 
the world. Two of their initial and basic problems 
were those of personnel and training. For the im-
pending war, therefore, their early intelligence 
efforts were necessarily defensive. Their success 
has been attributed, in part at least, to qualities of 
discipline, imagination, and improvisation. 
The Decline of French Intelligence 
At the close of World War I, France had one 
of the most efficient and extensive intelligence sys-
tems in Europe. The head of Military Intelli-
gence, through his membership on one of the 
important Allied commissions, was able to expand 
his organization of covert agents throughout Eu-
rope during the early postwar period. As the 
newly created national states of central and east-
ern Europe developed their own governmental 
structures, their intelligence systems were closely 
coordinated with that of France. By this in-
genious method France was able to advance and to 
protect its national interests and to maintain an 
intricate network of agents and informers. The 
resulting organization was superior to that of 
Stieber and the equal, at least, of that of Napoleon. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
36 
In the decade before the Second World War, 
this organization was fatally weakened by the 
germs of internal corruption which spread 
throughout the nation, and which eventually aided 
the Germans in infiltrating both the political and 
military structure of France, thus further weak-
ening the French intelligence system. 
The Expansion of German Intelligence 
As early as 1924 the Chief of German Military 
Intelligence, Nicolai, declared: "Now that inten-
sive military, political, and economic espionage, 
after its successes in the World War, has become 
an official organ of the state, it is time that the 
public should recognize the fact." While the 
United States and Great Britain sought peace 
through the reduction Of their wartime organiza-
tions, the Germans strove to profit by their mis-
takes and to forge invincible weapons for military 
victory. The growth of a dictatorship under 
Adolph Hitler and the National Socialist Party 
encouraged, promoted, and soon absorbed this ef-
fort of the German militarists. 
The militarists, including Ludendorff, were con-
vinced that World War I had been lost because 
of a failure to organize the country for total war, 
behind the battlelines as well as at the front. 
Acutely aware that this war had shifted the em-
phasis of attack to the minds and emotions of 
both soldiers and civilians, they recognized the 
great importance of propaganda. Lenin had 
enunciated the idea of an initial moral disintegra-
tion of the enemy before attempting physical at-
tack; and Hitler was in complete agreement. In 
Nein Kampf, he wrote, "In the future, the place 
of the artillery barrage as preparation for an in-
fantry attack will be taken by revolutionary propa-
ganda, designed to break down the enemy psy-
chologically before the armies begin to function 
at all." 
To carry out this new type of warfare a new 
armament of knowledge was required. As soon 
as Hitler assumed power he gave high priority to 
the organization necessary to produce that knowl-
edge. By 1937 the new German intelligence sys-
tem was operating at peak efficiency with all of 
its many branches carefully coordinated by a Liai-
son Staff, of which Rudolph Hess was the chair-
man and Nicolai a permanent member. Included

in this system were: the Intelligence Service of 
the War ministry, under the direction of Nicolai ; 
the Abwehr, or Military Intelligence, under Ad-
miral Canaris ; the Auslands Organization (AO), 
or Organization of Germans Living Abroad, 
headed by Ernst Bohle ; the Special Service of 
the Foreign Office, headed by von Ribbentrop; 
the Foreign Department of the Propaganda Min-
istry, under Goebbels; Rosenberg's Foreign Polit-
ical Office; the Foreign Department of the Min-
istry of Economics and Finance; the Reich 
Colonial Office; and the Foreign Department of 
the Gestapo, under Himmler and Heydrich. 
Hitler's personal plan for world conquest was 
based upon means which were not only military, 
but also economic, political, and psychological. 
To make it effective, full information and accurate 
estimates were required concerning the entire re-
sistance capability, both actual and potential, of 
prospective enemies. Knowledge of actual re-
armament was not as important as rearmament 
potential; the capacity of an enemy's war industry 
was not as significant as the total industrial po-
tential which could be geared to war purposes. 
Prof. Karl Haushofer's Geopolitical Institute at 
the University of Munich thus became an ad-
ditional important branch of the German system 
devoted to the collection of information and the 
production of intelligence. With unlimited funds 
available, Haushofer employed more than a thou-
sand research workers at home and abroad, in-
cluding historians and economic statisticians. De-
tailed analyses of the more important countries of 
the world were prepared from the point of view of 
their political, economic, and sociological struc-
tures. Both geographic vulnerabilities and mi-
nority group problems were included in these 
studies. 
Such was the comprehensive and complex Ger-
man intelligence system. It was a worldwide or-
ganization for the gathering of vast quantities of 
information, with elaborate facilities for classify-
ing, evaluating, and converting that information 
into intelligence. Under the Nazis, intelligence 
as an activity was a huge enterprise, operating 
with the precision of a modern machine. No 
longer was intelligence a matter of individual ac-
complishment but rather the combined achieve-
ment of many groups. The dimensions of the new 
organization were drawn to accommodate the re-
quirements of global war, fought by many means. 
It was a system new to the modern world. 
In developing this organization the Nazis were 
influenced considerably by Soviet methods. For 
example, the machinery of diplomacy was care-
fully geared to intelligence operations. Special 
agents were attached to embassies, legations, and 
consulates throughout the world under the guise 
of military, naval, air, commercial, and press at-
taches. Networks of covert agents were tied in 
with these special groups. The worldwide or-
ganization of German-born men and women was 
exploited wherever possible. Its potentialities 
were great, as indicated by the size of its mem-
bership which was officially reported in 1937 to be 
3 million, and an additional 100,000 sailors serving 
on German ships. Special organizations in Ger-
many were utilized, such as the Students' Bureau, 
the Bureau for Educators and Teachers, and var-
ious labor and cultural groups. Even the Ger-
man youth were carefully organized and trained 
to believe that sabotage, murder, and spying were 
natural expressions of loyalty to the State and 
Per Filehrer. 
Every conceivable method was employed to gain 
information. One of the more technical was the 
breaking of diplomatic codes. A clever device of 
the German Foreign Ministry was the delivery of 
an important note to foreign embassies on a quiet 
weekend which would require the embassy to re-
quest instructions from its government. When 
such enciphered messages were presented to the 
Reichspost for transmittal, German cryptanalysts 
would attempt to break the codes used, capitaliz-
ing on the possibility that the message had not 
been paraphrased and would contain the German 
note verbatim. Whether or not this particular 
device was used against the Belgians, it is true 
that their diplomatic code was known to German 
Intelligence before the outbreak of World War II. 
Initially at least, within the War Ministry, 
Nicolai was able to coordinate all Military Intel-
ligence activities?army, navy and air?and to 
achieve an overall political guidance through liai-
son with the Foreign Office. Under Hitler, there-
fore, Nicolai's theories became practice for a lim-
ited period of time. In addition, he was able to 
expand the field of military intelligence interest

to include not only fortifications, military person-
nel, and materiel, but also such behind-the-line 
matters as communications systems, public utili-
ties, and scientific and technical developments. 
Careful and early planning was a key feature 
of the German system. For example, the Abwehr, 
under Admiral Canaris, had selected its foreign 
listening posts and personnel with the greatest of 
care years before war came. There are indications 
that even the isolation of Germany by its enemies 
was given consideration, and well-laid plans were 
prepared by the Abwehr to permit the continued 
flow of information into Berlin from various areas 
outside of Europe. 
Intensive advance planning, in which Intelli-
gence played a vital part, found its most startling 
expression in Hitler's development of the modern 
offensive weapon which came to be known, after the 
Spanish Civil War, as the fifth column. Highly 
effective in a number of foreign countries, this 
weapon consisted of corrupt, politically dissatis-
fied, self-interested people who were won to the 
Nazi cause by means of propaganda and master-
race doctrines. Many of these people remained in-
active and unknown, to be used for special pur-
poses when military conflict began. Then bridges 
were seized and road blocks formed by men in 
civilian clothes or local uniforms; and planned 
sabotage threw into confusion local defenses, sup-
ply systems, and transportation and telecommuni-
cations. 
German Intelligence operations abroad were 
many and met with varying degrees of success. 
In France the political and moral disintegration 
provided the Nazis with a most rewarding oppor-
tunity for fifth-column activities. A number of 
Frenchmen whose loyalties were bought by Ger-
man gold and promises held important positions in 
government and came from some of the first fami-
lies of the land. The frequency of trials for trea-
son in the prewar period revealed the gravity of 
the situation. Involved in some of these trials 
was betrayal to the Germans of secrets of the 
Maginot Line, the Belfort fortifications, and plans 
of the Metz fortress and the Toulon Naval Base. 
In other countries of Europe the appearance of 
the quislings after war began revealed the success 
of earlier German operations. 
Fully aware of the failure of German Intelli-
CONFIDENTIAL 38 
gence in Great Britain in 1914, the Nazis were 
determined that it should not fail again. Accord-
ingly, large numbers of agents were sent into Eng-
land years before Poland was invaded. The 
extensiveness of their activities is indicated by the 
number of espionage cases which were uncovered 
during the years from 1935 to 1939. Not all were 
caught, however. One successful agent who went 
by the name of Van Schullermann first arrived in 
England in 1927. By 1932 he had become a natu-
ralized citizen, well established in a modest busi-
ness near the naval base at Scapa Flow. Over a 
considerable period of time he seems to have gath-
ered accurate information about the antisubmarine 
defenses for this base. At any rate, to his efforts 
is attributed the German success in penetrating 
Scapa Flow and sinking H. M. S. Royal Oak early 
in the war. At the outset of their intelligence 
efforts in Britain the Germans were able to take 
advantage of the fact that the British were in no 
way prepared for hostilities, either in fact or in. 
spirit. But again, in 1939 as in 1914, the Germans 
were unable to cope successfully with British 
counterintelligence. Emphasis on quantity rather 
than quality of effort, and stereotyped methods, 
again were important factors in the German 
failure. 
Nazi intelligence activities in the United States 
began in 1933, soon after Hitler came to power. 
German shipping was utilized to introduce covert 
agents into the country and to transmit informa-
tion back to Berlin. By 1938 vital defense secrets 
were reaching German Intelligence files. Among 
them were blueprints for new bombers and 
fighters, stolen from aircraft plants in New York 
and Pennsylvania; key designs of naval ships, re-
vealing possible weaknesses; and certain codes of 
the Army Air Force. On the west coast German 
agents were relaying information to the Japanese; 
and members of the German-American Bund were 
striving to obtain classified maps of fortifications 
in the Panama Canal Zone. 
Within Germany itself, Hitler's intelligence sys-
tem was equally comprehensive. The Nazi leaders 
fully realized that they must- establish absolute 
control over the German people if they were to 
control the world. Accordingly, even before 
Hitler came to power his henchmen had laid plans 
for a secret police system. In 1932 there were

138,000 German police; a year and a half later 
there were 437,000, of whom almost half were 
members of the Nazi Elite Guard, called the 
Schutz-Staffel, or SS. By 1940 the SS alone 
totaled 432,000 men, organized into 36 divisions of 
12,000 men each. During war this army was des-
ignated to hold the inner front. A significant 
part of the SS was the secret police force called 
the Gestapo, a name which came to strike fear and 
terror into the minds of men. The Gestapo was 
not only inquisitive in nature; it was an inquisi-
tion. Its purpose was to hunt out, repress, and 
destroy all enemies of the Nazi State. Its meth-
ods were characterized by brutality, if not bestial-
ity. Its eyes and ears gradually penetrated all 
phases of German life. 
It must have seemed to the Nazis that they had 
indeed forged an invincible weapon for their com-
plete success. It was well made; and Hitler soon 
put it to triumphant use in Austria, Czechoslo-
vakia, and other areas of Europe. However, the 
Nazis failed to control the inevitable human factor 
which eventually led to the serious weakening of 
their entire Intelligence apparatus. Distrust arose 
and increased between the leaders of the Gestapo 
and those of the Abwehr of the Army General 
Staff. There were conflicts between the secret 
police and military intelligence, especially as to 
spheres of authority and responsibility. Rivalries 
became intense, with much personal jealousy and 
animosity. By 1938 Hitler found it expedient to 
form a high command of the armed forces and to 
relieve the general staff of any responsibility for 
the interpretation of intelligence. The political 
direction, urged by Nicolai, became political 
domination. 
Italian Intelligence 
Mussolini's major military intelligence effort 
was demonstrated briefly during his campaign 
into Ethiopia in 1935. It took the form of sub-
version of the Coptic priests in order to render 
even easier the overthrow of their government. 
The principal Italian Intelligence organization 
was the Fascist Secret Police, known as the OVRA, 
established officially in 1926 as a direct result of 
the insecurity of the Fascist government and a 
succession of attempts to assassinate Mussolini 
himself. Its weapons, applied with liberality 
against the Italian people, were fear, terror, and 
absolute power over life and death. The OVRA, 
as part of the state militia, devoted itself to ob-
taining information about all enemies of the state, 
both within Italy and abroad. Agents provoca-
teurs were active in Europe and in North and 
South America, where they attempted to hunt 
down and destroy Italian antifascists. One of 
their effective weapons against those who managed 
to escape from the country was holding as hostages 
families who had been left behind. 
In 1938, when Mussolini entrusted his political 
fortunes to Hitler, the German Gestapo entered 
Italy in force and rapidly replaced OVRA with 
its own organization. 
The Rapid Growth of Japanese Intelligence 
Even before Hitler began to implement his con-
cept of total war in Europe, the Japanese were 
putting many of the same theories to use in Asia. 
For example, the political and moral disintegra-
tion within Manchuria?an early objective for ag-
gression?provided an excellent opportunity for 
the use of the fifth column technique. 
For many years the head of the Army's Bureau 
of Military Information, Colonel Doihara, had 
been active in China. Using many disguises, 
from peddlar to priest, he had traveled about the 
country, gathering information and enlisting the 
services of dissident elements and criminal groups. 
He was particularly successful in utilizing agents 
provocateurs to create incidents which would jus-
tify interference in China by Japanese military 
forces. In the summer of 1931, for example, he 
arranged for the kidnapping of the commander of 
the Manchurian Infantry. Several days later, a 
group of men dressed in uniforms of the Man-
churian Infantry provoked an argument with a 
Japanese officer on the streets of Mukden and bru-
tally killed him before a crowd of onlookers. 
Taken into custody, these men stated that they 
had acted under the direct orders of their com-
mander. When an explanation was demanded by 
the Japanese Government, the commander, of 
course, could not be found. Immediately the 
Manchurian Government was accused of protect-
ing this officer and encouraging atrocities against 
the Japanese. After diplomatic denials were pre-
sented, the officer in question reappeared. Hay-

CONFIDENTML INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
ing been well treated, he was unable to support 
his story of kidnapping and was completely 
discredited. 
In addition to this type of direct pressure, the 
Japanese employed more subtle, though equally 
effective, methods. The Chinese opium industry 
was exploited and the sale of its product promoted 
among the people, with the double-edged result 
of further destroying their moral fiber and at the 
same time providing financial support for the 
whole operation. 
As Japanese plans for expansion in Asia devel-
oped, so did her requirements for information to 
be used to support conquest by military, economic, 
political, and psychological means. The alloca-
tion of more than $3,000,000 to official Japanese in-
telligence services for the fiscal year 1934-35 is 
indicative of the attention given to their develop-
ment. Listening posts and personnel were gradu-
ally established in Malaya, Singapore, Burma, 
Java, the Philippines, Morotai, French In do-
China, and India. After the "China Incident" of 
1937 the activities of military intelligence mate-
rially increased. With Manchuria and Korea as 
bases for operation, the collection effort against 
Soviet Siberia was intensified. Long before their 
attack against Pearl Harbor, the Japanese had ex-
tended their intelligence network throughout the 
world, utilizing agents of many types. 
Trained agents were provided in part by the 
Army General Staff. As the demand for personnel 
increased, it became necessary to establish secretly 
in 1938 a Rear Area Service Personnel Training 
Center, which was soon expanded into an Army 
Intelligence School. Officers trained at this school 
were sent abroad as military attach4s, diplomats, 
newspaper reporters, businessmen, or special 
agents. Their activities included: the collection 
of information and liaison work; the organiza-
tion of small guerrilla groups, especially in China, 
for scouting and undercover operations; and sab-
otage and subversion, which was concentrated in 
southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific. 
These officers were the vanguard for Japanese mil-
itary action, paving the way for the occupation 
of various areas by Japanese troops. 
Naval officers also acted as special intelligence 
agents and were distributed throughout the mer-
chant marine and fishing fleets disguised as wire-
CONFIDENTIAL 
40 
less operators, crew members, and ships' officers, 
especially in the Pacific. Thus training maneu-
vers of the United States Fleet, for example, were 
watched by expert eyes from nearby Japanese 
cargo ships or fishing craft. There were, of 
course, many situations in which Japanese person-
nel could not be used because of their oriental 
appearance. As a result, Caucasians were often 
employed, particularly Germans, in such areas as 
Hawaii, the United States, and South America. 
In addition to their trained personnel, the In-
telligence services had available literally thousands 
of amateur collectors of information, for one char-
acteristic of the Japanese is careful and conscien-
tious observation. More important, they feel 
impelled to report their observations to proper 
authorities. As a result, great quantities of in-
formation were channeled into Tokyo from trav-
elers, tourists, Japanese living abroad, and 
business firms operating in foreign countries. 
These amateurs usually had cameras and made the 
most of their opportunities to photograph war-
ships, naval bases, and other subjects of possible 
military interest. Reports and photographs were 
turned over to military authorities, either directly 
or through consulates, special messengers, or rep-
resentatives of the merchant marine. While 
much of this information was inaccurate or with-
out value, it was all carefully classified and proc-
essed by the Intelligence agencies of the Army 
and Navy and the Information Bureau of the For-
eign Office. This technique of capitalizing on the 
mass collection of information is a Japanese con-
tribution to the modern development of intelli-
gence activity. 
The collection procedures of the Japanese in 
the prewar period also indicate their appreciation 
of the importance of peacetime planning and 
preparation, years in advance of actual conflict. 
An excellent illustration is provided by one of 
their agents, a Dr. Kuehn and his family, who 
came to Oahu, T. H., from Germany in 1935. Dr. 
Kuehn posed as a scientist interested in the an-
cient history of the islands. About 1939 his 
daughter, Ruth, opened a beauty shop, which 
served as an excellent source of information gath-
ered from its patrons who were the wives of United 
States Navy personnel. As Japanese require-
ments for information became more definite, Dr.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
Kuehn began to forward through the Japanese 
and German consulates specific information re-
garding naval ships at Pearl Harbor. On De-
cember 2, 1941, a complete report on the number, 
types, and exact locations of United States naval 
ships in the Hawaiian area was prepared for the 
Japanese consul who transmitted it by short-wave 
radio to Japanese Naval Intelligence Headquar-
ters. At the appropriate time, the Kuehns were 
to be evacuated to Tokyo by submarine; but this 
plan failed to materialize because they were appre-
hended and taken into custody as the result of 
action by the United States Naval Intelligence. 
The Trend of Soviet Intelligence 
During the early years between the two World 
Wars, the development and consolidation of power 
within Russia consumed much of the attention and 
energies of the revolutionists who had seized con-
trol of the government in 1917. For this reason 
Soviet Intelligence was, first of all, a security po-
lice system, with military intelligence occupying 
a position of secondary importance. Conditioned 
to an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion while 
they were revolutionary conspirators, the Soviet 
leaders fully appreciated the need for a highly 
organized and pervasive Intelligence system to 
maintain rigid controls over the actions and even 
the thoughts of the Russian people. Within 3 
weeks after the revolution had become an accom-
plished fact, they established the Cheka which con-
tinued not only the tradition but also the methods 
of the Tzarist Oehrana. 
The Ch,eka was given great independence of ac-
tion, with the power to carry out searches, arrests, 
and executions. Its ruthless and brutal methods 
inspired such fear and terror that it became the 
object of widespread opposition within a few 
short years. As a result, in 1922, when the Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics was established, the 
Ch,eka was abolished. It was quickly replaced, 
however, by the 0. G. P. U., which had its head-
quarters in Moscow, with branches known as 
G. P. U. in each of the member republics. The 
purposes, powers, and methods of this new or-
ganization were substantially the same as those of 
the Ckeka, but its jurisdiction was expanded. 
The border and internal security troops were 
placed under its control, and a military section 
was created to insure the political allegiance of 
the Army and the Navy. In 1934, the 0. G. P. U. 
was replaced by the N. K. V. D. At this time 
there was further centralization of authority and 
a reorganization to include all police and firemen 
engaged in overt security duties. New sections 
were added to direct the surveillance of the civil-
ian population and of foreign espionage agents. 
Soviet Intelligence had now become a full-scale 
commissariat of the government, far more com-
prehensive and powerful than anything ever en-
visioned by the Tzars. Its stability and deadly 
influence were fully demonstrated by its bloody 
purge of Red Army personnel in 1937. 
The record of Soviet Intelligence within Russia 
during the period from 1917 to 1939 is one of 
steady expansion and increasing influence in every 
aspect of Russian society. Abroad it became 
more and more active, developing networks of 
agents and informers by many means. The inter-
national organization of Communists, the Comin-
tern, provided excellent opportunities for 
intelligence activities in many countries. Diplo-
matic and trade channels were exploited for the 
collection of information by carefully placed in-
telligence agents. For example, more extensive 
Soviet intelligence activities in the United States 
are believed to date from 1933 when diplomatic 
relations were reestablished between the two coun-
tries. In fact, every conceivable situation was 
skillfully turned to the advantage of intelligence 
operations. In 1929 when Stalin expelled Trot-
sky from the Soviet Union, the N. K. V. D. made 
use of this situation to send abroad a number of 
covert agents posing as escaped sympathizers. 
Some legitimate sympathizers were permitted to 
leave the U. S. S. R. only after they had agreed to 
serve the N. K. V. D. The double result of this 
procedure was to provide a good cover for intelli-
gence personnel and to confuse and discredit anti-
Soviet groups outside the country. 
The Spanish Civil War was also used to good 
advantage for intelligence purposes. Not only 
did Soviet personnel receive excellent practical 
training, but also valuable information was 
gained regarding the capabilities of other coun-
tries involved. One seemingly insignificant, but 
important, procedure initiated by the Soviets in 
this war was the careful collection of the pass-

ports of volunteers who came from many coun-
tries to fight in Spain. The passports of those 
killed were saved for later use by Soviet agents 
in other parts of the world. This procedure pro-
vides a good illustration of long-range planning. 
There are indications that Soviet Intelligence, 
or the use of intelligence, was not always success-
ful in the pre-World War II period. At the out-
set of the Russo-Finnish War of 1939, Soviet 
forces suffered some amazing defeats at the hands 
of inferior Finnish armies. There was subse-
quent speculation that the Kremlin may well have 
been led by Finnish Communists to believe that 
their country's armies would not materially resist 
Soviet military maneuvers. If this was true, then 
Soviet Intelligence may have suffered from a 
tendency to place too much reliance upon infor-
mation derived from affiliated foreign Communist 
organizations. 
During the early part of World War II, a fur-
ther reorganization of the Soviet Intelligence 
System resulted in the establishment of the Peo-
ple's Commissariat of State Security, called the 
N. K. G. B. This new agency relieved the 
N. K. V. D. of its functions in internal surveil-
lance and the collection of information abroad. 
WORLD WAR II 
The Second World War has been described as 
one of unparalleled mobility, tremendous destruc-
tiveness, and intense savagery. The technologi-
cal improvements in tanks and aircraft, when used 
in combination, made possible the lightning war, 
or "Blitzkrieg," so successfully employed by Hit-
ler. Poland was conquered in 18 days and France 
fell in 35. The French General Staff, complacent 
and unprepared, was paralyzed by this new war-
fare of fluid movement. The techniques de-
veloped by the Germans were later used with equal 
success by General Patton in his drive on Paris. 
Other methods of warfare were developed with 
notable effectiveness. Strategic bombing brought 
destruction behind the battlelines to all parts of 
enemy countries, while transport aircraft carried 
conquering airborne forces across geographical 
barriers. Amphibious craft made possible the 
launching of land attacks from the sea which had 
been considered too difficult in previous wars. In-
ventions in the field of electronics produced such 
CONFIDENTIAL 
42 
weapons as radar and guided missiles for long-
range battle use. The aircraft carrier replaced 
the battleship as the capital ship and made pos-
sible the waging of sea battles across hundreds of 
miles. Guerrilla warfare sprang out of internal 
resistance movements and was exploited on a wide 
scale. The submarine harassed lines of communi-
cations and committed sizable organized forces 
to its pursuit. The radio permitted an intensifi-
cation of propaganda and the waging of psycho-
logical warfare in all parts of the world, a type 
of "strategic bombing" of equal effectiveness in 
peace or war. 
World War II was much more than a series of 
battles between armies and navies; it was a gi-
gantic struggle between peoples for survival and 
for the perpetuation of their economies and ways 
of life. Hitler's intelligence weapon had to be 
improved upon and surpassed by the opposing 
nations. The variety of the modern methods of 
warfare imposed even greater demands upon In-
telligence, for it had to cover not only the armed 
forces of the enemy, their discipline, training, and 
tactics; in addition, it had to be conversant with 
industrial capacity, technological abili ties, trans-
portation and communication facilities, internal 
political situations, and the will of the people to 
resist. The speed of this war placed a premium 
on the time factor in the collection of information 
and the dissemination of intelligence. The com-
plexity and scope of military action increased the 
problems of preparing accurate intelligence esti-
mates which in turn led to the demand for more 
highly trained personnel. The sheer volume of 
advance knowledge required for success in battle 
forced the expansion of organizations to a size 
adequate for its production. The resistance move-
ments in occupied and enemy countries aided ma-
terially in the collection of information. The un-
precedented number of covert agents stepped up 
the work of both intelligence and counterintel-
ligence. Radio and aircraft facilitated the trans-
mission of information. The total impact of all 
of this intelligence activity rendered doubly im-
portant the most stringent security measures. 
At the beginning of World War II, the pre-
ponderance of land and air military strength was 
in the hands of Germany, Japan, and the Soviet 
Union. Likewise, the offensive intelligence

strength of Germany and Japan was superior. On 
the other hand, for over 2 years the Western Al-
lies were harassed, driven back, and on the de-
fensive, while they took time to prepare a counter-
offensive. 
The Effectiveness of German Intelligence 
The Nazis began the war with the world's best 
organized intelligence service. Without detract-
ing from the effectiveness of the German military 
forces, it is generally agreed that their early rapid 
progress was greatly facilitated by the advance 
preparations of Intelligence, which preceded and 
accompanied troop movements. Polish resistance 
was paralyzed by the Nazi fifth column which 
spread false rumors, issued conflicting orders, and 
transmitted vital operational information to the 
German General Staff. France, from the military 
point of view, was potentially much more power-
ful than Poland, yet fifth column activities had 
fatally weakened her ability to fight and, even 
worse, her will to resist. 
Greece and Yugoslavia were able to prolong 
their resistance to German covert penetration. 
Time and the examples of Poland and France were 
of some assistance to them. In addition, the 
Italian OVRA, which had assumed some responsi-
bilities to prepare these countries for invasion, 
failed miserably. In Greece, for example, Ger-
man forces were required to save Mussolini from 
being thrown back into the Adriatic. 
The German intelligence service had available 
unlimited funds, an army of agents, and a net-
work of collection centers. At the beginning of 
the war $200,000,000 were reportedly being 
spent annually on intelligence organization and 
propaganda. In 1943 the Abwehr was allocated 
$11,700,000 and had a personnel strength of 30,000 
including 7,000 officers. In Denmark alone there 
were 750 Nazi agents. The four major Intelli-
gence centers established by the Abwehr for the 
collection of world information were located at 
Konigsberg, Munich, Cologne, and Hamburg. 
Madrid, Lisbon, Berne, Ankara, Stockholm, Buda-
pest, and the Vatican were centers for the collec-
tion of information on a long-range basis. 
Brussels, Warsaw, Sofia, Bucharest, The Hague, 
and Paris were considered short-term centers. 
One network of agents was distributed among the 
43 
various diplomatic, consular, and commercial posts 
in these capitals. A second network worked inde-
pendently in the collecting and transmitting of in-
formation for strategic and tactical use. One of 
the specialized types of collectors was a group of 
deaf-mutes who were skilled in the reading of lips 
and the recording of conversations seen but not 
heard. 
In Great Britain, during the early months of the 
war, the Germans achieved some successes. The 
transmittal of vital information regarding war 
factories in Birmingham and Coventry aided in 
the bombing of those areas. The German lega-
tion at Dublin served as one collection center; 
while Lisbon and Oslo were relay points between 
England and Berlin. However, British counter-
intelligence soon proved more than a match for 
German Intelligence, whose effectiveness rapidly 
dwindled in the British Isles. In fact the British 
success in forwarding inaccurate information, 
ostensibly from German agents who had actually 
been taken into custody, confused and bewildered 
headquarters in Berlin. 
The entire Middle East was the scene of inten-
sive intelligence activities by German agents lo-
cated in Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and 
Afghanistan. The total organization extended 
from the Mediterranean coast of North Africa to 
the Indian Ocean. The objectives were to under-
mine British influence among the Arab peoples 
and to prepare them for German domination by 
means of corruption and subversion. In these ef-
forts the Germans had the active assistance of the 
Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. The German com-
mercial attache at Ankara was instrumental in 
fomenting an unsuccessful rebellion against the 
pro-British government of Iraq. The German 
ambassador at Ankara, Franz von Papen, was pro-
vided with more than $4,000,000 in gold to finance 
his work in the Middle East. But in spite of this 
well-organized and numerically superior machine, 
German Intelligence failed in its efforts. It also 
failed to forecast the Allied invasion of North 
Africa. 
Of particular interest is the "Cicero" affair 
which took place in Turkey during late 1943 and 
early 1944. "Cicero" was the code name of an 
employee in the British Embassy at Ankara. He 
became a German spy, motivated by a desire for

money and possibly an old hatred of the British. 
As a result of his efforts the Germans were pro-
vided with highly classified material of incredible 
value: a record of official messages passing be-
tween the British Ambassador and the Foreign 
Office in London. In this manner it is believed 
that the German Government was fully informed 
of the latest figures of American lend-lease 
deliveries and anticipated shipments; the minutes 
of the Allied Casablanca Conference; a resume of 
Allied conversations at Moscow between Stalin, 
Anthony Eden, and Cordell Hull, including a re-
port of the Russian demand for a second front in. 
Europe; decisions reached between Roosevelt, 
Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek at Cairo; and, 
finally, the conclusions of the Teheran Conference, 
including decisions of the military staffs of the 
Big Three. But even more incredible than the 
nature of the information itself is the apparent 
fact that the German military and political lead-
ers failed to make use of it. Von Ribbentrop 
seems to have questioned the accuracy of the in-
formation and the source remained suspect. The 
only real value to the Germans of "Cicero's" work 
was the breaking of the British diplomatic code. 
In South American countries, German Intelli-
gence exploited important sources of information. 
The German Ambassador to Argentina, Baron 
von Thermann, coordinated the collection effort 
in this part of the world. For transmittal pur-
poses he had available 12 powerful secret radio 
stations, operating with the knowledge of Argen-
tine authorities. As of 1942, over $2,000,000 were 
being spent annually in Argentina to subsidize 
German cultural organizations. There can be little 
doubt that information derived from Buenos Aires 
and various other ports in South America aided the 
operations of German submarine warfare in the 
Atlantic. 
Weaknesses in the German intelligence service 
rapidly diminished its overall effectiveness. Its 
elaborate mass training of agents resulted in a 
standardized type of operation and response which 
facilitated detection, and overcentralization of or-
ganization tended to reduce individual initiative. 
Political considerations were an increasingly lim-
iting factor. Tension and distrust grew between 
political and military leaders on the one hand and 
Army General Staff Intelligence personnel on the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
44 
other. As the war progressed actual leadership 
was concentrated in the hands of political leaders 
and military men chosen and influenced by them. 
Vital decisions were reached more and more by 
Hitler himself on the basis of intuition, rather 
than intelligence. This was particularly true in 
the campaign against the Soviet Union. Hitler 
and his henchmen often refused to accept unfavor-
able reports, even though well documented. As a 
result, intelligence personnel on all echelons came 
to color their reports, emphasizing the favorable 
factors and withholding or mitigating the 
unfavorable. 
There is some evidence to support the conten-
tion that Admiral Canaris, Chief of the Army 
Intelligence Section, was in active sympathy with 
those German military leaders whose opposition 
to the Hitler regime resulted in an abortive at-
tempt to assassinate Der Fuehrer in 1944. At the 
Nurnberg trials following the war, Ernst Kalten-
brunner, the head of the German Security Police, 
stated: "I had to accept this post (the Reich Se-
curity Office) at a time when suspicion fell on 
Admiral Canaris of having collaborated with the 
enemy for years . . . In a short time I ascer-
tained the treason of Canaris to a most frightful 
extent." Whether or not the individual involved 
was Canaris himself will probably never be de-
termined. It is known, however, that the British 
gained possession of information which could 
have come from very few other sources. For ex-
ample, all German plans for aggressive action 
prior to the invasion of France were reported to 
the British. They were warned of the impending 
attack on Norway in 1940. Winston Churchill 
had some knowledge of the plans for the invasion 
of England at a time when only a few highly 
placed officers of the German General Staff had 
similar information. It is of interest to note 
that much of this information gained by the Brit-
ish was disregarded, perhaps for lack of con-
firmation. 
Suspicion against Canaris reached such propor-
tions that he was relieved of command of the 
Abwehr in 1941 when Hitler established a unified 
secret intelligence service more directly under his 
personal control. 
German military intelligence was weakened by 
the attitude of the officer group toward it. In the

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
German staff organization, Intelligence was sub-
ordinated to Operations. While intelligence of-
ficers were expected to have a clear understanding 
of tactical situations, no particular specialization 
of knowledge or training was considered essen-
tial. German officers did not regard an intelli-
gence assignment worthy of a soldier and, conse-
quently, endeavored to avoid it whenever possible. 
However, the performance of military intelli-
gence must not be underrated. It remained a 
formidable weapon during World War II. The 
relationship of Intelligence to Operations kept 
the study of the enemy situation on an immedi-
ately applicable basis. All officers had been care-
fully trained to develop qualities of thoroughness, 
sense of duty, logical approach to problems, and 
accuracy. In spite of no special training, they 
became competent in these assignments as a re-
sult of hard work and careful study. Their abil-
ity to gather facts and piece together an accurate 
picture of the enemy situation was often amaz-
ing. They were most successful in the interroga-
tion of captured enemy personnel. Their radio 
intercept work was of a high order and a profit-
able source of information, especially after the 
Germans lost their air superiority. It was un-
fortunate for military intelligence that those 
officers who had trained themselves in intelligence 
were transferred in due time to other assignments 
more to their liking and ambition. But, as far 
as results were concerned, German military in-
telligence, which had been only mediocre in 
World War I, performed rather successfully in 
World War II, especially when permitted to func-
tion without the blight of political interference. 
The Errors of Japanese Intelligence 
The remarkable mass collection system of the 
Japanese provided Tokyo with a wealth of vital 
information prior to the outbreak of war. For 
example, when it was ready to move troops into 
Southeast Asia, the Imperial High Command had 
complete and accurate models of the defenses of 
Hong Kong down to the last gun position. Its 
detailed information regarding ship positions and 
movements in and around Pearl Harbor was used 
with devastating effect. However, the Japanese 
intelligence organization was not provided with 
a sufficient number of trained personnel at the 
higher echelons to assemble and evaluate the mass 
of material which had been collected. 
At the time of Pearl Harbor the Intelligence 
Section of the Army General Staff included only 
17 officers. Its growth was negligible until early 
in 1945 when 40 additional officers were assigned 
to be trained for duty with the armies organized 
for the defense of the Japanese islands. The de-
velopment of Naval Intelligence was equally slow. 
Beginning with 29 officers attached to the Naval 
General Staff, the total number was increased to 
97 by early 1945. The Kempeitai, or secret police, 
was primarily responsible for counterintelligence 
and was well organized, with trained personnel 
to carry out this function. It achieved a reputa-
tion similar to that of the German Gestapo, and 
many of its methods were comparable. 
The slow and limited development of Japanese 
Intelligence appears to have resulted from the 
high command's concept of a short war, defensive 
in nature, following the initial conquests. Based 
on the possibilities of an early German victory in 
Europe and the rapid consolidation of her own 
newly won territories, Japan believed that the 
United States would settle for an advantageous 
compromise peace. As a result, neither the Army 
nor the Navy expanded their intelligence organi-
zations to make possible the production of intel-
ligence for dissemination throughout all levels of 
command. At the headquarters level, intelligence 
for both the Army and the Navy was subordinated 
to the war plans sections and responsible prima-
rily for the production of background intelligence. 
There was apparently little coordination between 
the intelligence effort at headquarters and at the 
operational levels. 
In the field, intelligence units were utilized by 
military commanders for such purposes as the 
collection of tactical information, penetration and 
subversion of native peoples, and the exploitation 
of economic sabotage. These units often worked 
with the military governments established for con-
quered territories. The unit attached to the Nan-
king Government Military Affairs Committee, for 
example, was particularly active in the prepara-
tion of surveys and statistics and in attempting 
to influence and control the activities of the local 
Chinese. In general, however, these units were 
not effective, for a variety of reasons. In the first

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
place they were not organized in sufficient time 
to permit the accomplishment of their responsibil-
ities. One unit, created for the battle of the 
Pacific islands, became operational just 2 months 
before hostilities began. Another reason was the 
Japanese failure to appreciate the customs and 
habits of other peoples and an attempt to impose 
their own, without change. They alienated those 
whom they sought to control, and operated by 
means of intimidation and threats. There was 
continuous conflict over responsibility and author-
ity between military commanders, intelligence 
units, and representatives of the secret police. 
Finally, many operational commanders had no 
appreciation of the potential value or use of the 
intelligence units assigned to them, particularly 
from a long-range point of view. 
When Japan's diplomatic relations with many 
countries were broken, her primary sources of in-
formation were reduced to Allied communications 
transmissions, short wave and medium wave radio 
broadcasts, and newspapers and magazines pro-
cured through neutral sources. 
Special agents planted in the Western Hemi-
sphere continued to supply some information, with 
diminishing degrees of success as the war pro-
gressed. The case of one American citizen who 
served as an agent is illustrative of the use made 
of the nationals of various countries for espio-
nage purposes and, incidentally, of the devious 
means employed for the transmittal of informa-
tion. Mrs. Velvalee Dickinson, owner of an ex-
clusive doll shop in New York City, made use 
of her occupation and clientele to transmit infor-
mation regarding the movement of United States 
Navy ships. Various kinds of dolls provided an 
ingenious code. Her messages were transmitted 
via a contact in Buenos Aires. The suspicion 
which led to her discovery was aroused when one 
of her letters to Argentina was returned to the 
United States, addressee unknown. The Japanese 
had failed to notify her that her contact had 
moved. This incident has been popularized as 
"The Case of the Talking Dolls." 
These, then, were some of the errors of Japanese 
Intelligence, which were in turn errors of the 
Japanese High Command. They contributed to 
heavy losses in Japanese manpower and materiel 
and were factors in Japan's eventual defeat.

46 
The Resiliency of British Intelligence 
Although decidedly inferior to that of the Ger-
mans in numbers and resources at the beginning 
of the war, British Intelligence made maximum 
use of its available strength and centuries of ex-
perience. Much of the German Intelligence ac-
tivity in Britain had been carefully followed and 
its organization penetrated. When the Germans 
marched into Poland, therefore, it was compara-
tively easy, by means of extensive raids and ar-
rests, to destroy the overall effectiveness of Ger-
man Intelligence in Britain in much the same way 
as it had been accomplished early in World 
War I. 
After Dunkirk, when the British faced one of 
the most precarious and dangerous situations of 
their history, Intelligence proved to be a bul-
wark of defense. Appalling weaknesses were suc-
cessfully concealed from the Germans and accu-
rate information made possible the skillful use of 
inferior military forces. In his book, Top Secret, 
Robert Ingersoll has aptly commented: "Intelli-
gence was always the Empire's ace in the hole. 
When British fortunes were at the lowest ebb, it 
was their Intelligence organization which saved 
them." 
Once the country was on a war basis, ample 
funds and personnel became available, but the 
training of personnel required considerable time. 
It was not until several years had passed that Brit-
ish Intelligence was able to develop its outstand-
ing organization, again conceded to be the "world's 
best." By that time many covert agents of Brit-
ish, French, and German nationality were active 
within Germany itself. Innumerable bits of in-
formation, often irrelevant in themselves, flowed 
regularly into London for analysis by various in-
telligence agencies. Through the European gov-
ernments-in-exile, in London, encouragement was 
given to the underground resistance movements 
which sprang up against the Germans all over 
Europe. The time came when British Intelli-
gence was able to operate fifth columns in many 
countries of Europe as effective as those of Hitler. 
The British had many assets upon which their 
intelligence organization could draw. In addi-
tion to comprehensive experience, internationally 
educated, politically informed soldiers and civil-
ians were available who were adept in dealing

with foreign peoples. Their basic research and 
available source material were tangible assets. 
Their military and political leaders had a real 
and full appreciation not only of the value of 
intelligence, but also of long-range planning. 
Typical of British Intelligence personnel was 
a young man named Rankin who had lived all of 
his life in the inaccessible Chin hills of Burma. 
He knew the Burmese, Chin, and Manipur lan-
guages, dressed and lived like the natives, and had 
a sincere affection for them. Even though the na-
tives in these hills were anti-British, Rankin was 
able to influence them to support the Allied cause. 
A more intangible asset was the ability of the 
British to improvise. When their armies were 
driven off the continent and their channels of in-
formation blocked, they devised a means of ex-
tracting military information from photographs 
taken over enemy-held territory. In a relatively 
short time the results obtained were successful to 
a spectacular degree. The development of photo-
graphic interpretation as a technique for the col-
lection of information was a significant British 
contribution to intelligence in World War II. 
A further asset was the control of the informa-
tion upon which military decisions were made. 
This control, as well as effectiveness of presenta-
tion, was well demonstrated at the major political 
and military conferences held by the Allies during 
the war. In the European theater, for example, 
their intelligence organization was so complete 
that they were given primary responsibility for 
enemy intelligence in that theater. In the Middle 
East, British agents, experienced in local customs 
and traditions, surpassed the Germans in winning 
the support of those peoples. As is often true in 
the Orient, the bribe was the key to support, and 
it was often a case of outbidding the Germans. 
One of the real achievements of Intelligence was 
a delay in the German use of V-bombs against 
Britain. Preliminary reports about German de-
velopment of V-weapons were received as early as 
1942, and a female special agent was able to trans-
mit vital information concerning the activities and 
installations of the main research station at Peene-
muende. As a result of her work, one of the most 
effective Allied air raids of the war was carried 
out against this area at a time when some of Ger-
many's key scientists were there. Over 200 per-
47 
sons were killed during this raid, including the 
director of the station and the Chief of Staff of 
the Luftwaffe. The raid substantially retarded 
the production of these new weapons. 
British Intelligence, however, was not always 
successful. One of its failures contributed to the 
defeat of General Montgomery's forces at Am-
helm. Just prior to this engagement Intelligence 
lost track of one German Panzer corps and was 
unable to determine its location, which unfortu-
nately was Arnheim. The well-guarded move-
ment of this corps is reported to have resulted 
from a betrayal of Montgomery's plans by a 
Dutch traitor. In any event, British losses were 
heavy. Some of the troops who managed to es-
cape were aided by British agents in that area. 
Throughout the war, Intelligence continued to 
underestimate German production capabilities, re-
cuperative powers, and capacity to wage war. 
Basing its decisions on such estimates, the British 
General Staff discouraged an invasion of the con-
tinent from the west, believing that Germany's 
surrender could be brought about by aerial bomb-
ing. Opposition to invasion plans was further 
strengthened as a result of overestimating the 
strength of German fortifications along the chan-
nel coast. Captured German generals later 
pointed out that this overestimate had been caused 
by effective propaganda. A much earlier failure 
of Intelligence was its incorrect appraisal of Ger-
man intentions in Norway, just prior to the occu-
pation of that country. 
For a short period during the war there was 
intense rivalry between the Intelligence and Oper-
ations staffs, which temporarily blocked the inter-
change of important information. As a result, 
on one occasion, both groups put agents ashore at 
the same place on the coast of Norway within an 
interval of 3 days. The agents from Operations 
destroyed vital targets in the area and withdrew. 
When the Intelligence agents arrived they re-
ceived a warm welcome from the German field 
police. 
In the field of counterintelligence the British 
were of considerable assistance to the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation in both North and South 
America, and this mutual cooperation was of real 
value in smashing the Nazi espionage activities 
there.

Surprised and dismayed by the progress of

United States gradually became aware of the in-
adequacy of its intelligence agencies which it had 
so pointedly neglected. The success of the Jap-
anese attack at Pearl Harbor disclosed the tragic 
results of this neglect. Even more, it revealed a 
lack of coordination of effort in the collection of 
information, interdepartmental jealousies which 
stymied effective exchange of information, and in-
correct estimates of the war capabilities of the 
enemy. 
As a result, the older intelligence agencies were 
expanded and strengthened, and new agencies 
were created to develop sources of information and 
new techniques. Among these agencies were: a 
foreign propaganda agency, an economic warfare 
agency, a war production agency, the Office of 
Strategic Services, a branch of the foreign eco-
nomic administration, and special units in the De-
partments of Justice, Interior, and Agriculture. 
Founded in 1908 and reorganized in 1924, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation was officially 
given responsibilities for counterintelligence in 
1939. After the war began its personnel expanded 
to more than 15,000. It had a tremendous task 
in weeding out potentially dangerous aliens, as 
is indicated by the fact that over 7,000 Germans 
and 5,000 Japanese were detained or imprisoned 
after war was declared. The size of the job can 
be estimated somewhat from a partial list of ma-
terial collected from the hiding places of enemy 
agents: 4,626 firearms, including modern auto-
matics and submachine guns; 307,506 rounds of 
ammunition, 2,340 sticks of dynamite, 2,800 dyna-
mite caps, 3,787 feet of fuse, 1,700 items such as 
time bombs, teller mines and boohytraps ; over 
3,000 illegal radio receivers and shortwave trans-
mitters; 4,000 cameras, navigational instruments, 
naval charts, aeronautical maps, tens of thousands 
of detailed photographs of coastlines, ports, in-
dustrial plants; and thousands of feet of micro-
film containing vital records prepared by covert 
agents. Aided by Naval and Army Intelligence, 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation was emi-
nently successful in thwarting sabotage efforts. 
Although the sabotage of American factories was 
CONFIDENTIAL 
a part of the Nazi plan, there is no definite evi-
dence that organized German sabotage achieved 
any major destruction. 
One of the most clever counterintelligence feats 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was made 
possible by a German-born American citizen 
named Wilhelm Sebold, who was employed as an 
engineer by the Consolidated Aircraft Co. In 
1939 Sebold made a trip to Germany to visit his 
parents and relatives. While there he was de-
tained by the Gestapo and "persuaded" to become 
an undercover agent in the United States, with his 
family held as hostages in Germany. After train-
ing in espionage and radio transmission at a Nazi 
spy school, he was permitted to return to America 
with instructions to gather detailed statistics on 
aircraft and poison-gas production. He had been 
able to advise the FBI of his predicament through 
the American consul in Germany. Upon his re-
turn, Sebold was established by the FBI at Center-
port, Long Island, where the most modern short-
wave transmitter equipment was made available 
for his use. For a period of 16 months both fake 
and genuine information was transmitted to the 
unsuspecting Germans. By means of Sebold and 
his shortwave transmitters, the Nazis were thor-
oughly deceived as to the number of aircraft avail-
able to the British for the Battle of Britain and 
the FBI was able to round up over 30 Nazi agents 
in the United States and to gain information about 
others located in Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, and 
Chile.

The Office of Strategic Services 
The establishment of the Office of Strategic 
Services in 1941 under Maj. Gen. William J. Dono-
van was an unprecedented act on the part of the 
United States Government. Its early functions 
included research and analysis of military, politi-
cal, and economic information us it affected the 
security of the country. After Pearl Harbor it 
was placed under the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Its 
mission was twofold: to act in support of the Army 
and Navy in the collection and analysis of strategic 
information; and to be responsible for the plan-
ning and operating of special services. These 
special services involved covert operations which 
would not normally be carried on by the armed 
forces. Personnel were selected for this work only

THE DEVELOPMENT 
after the most intensive screening and psychologi-
cal testing for mental aptitude and emotional sta-
bility. Their training in subversive warfare was 
rigorous, extensive, and carried on under condi-
tions of the greatest secrecy. Altogether, during 
the war, thousands of OSS operators made their 
way into enemy countries to engage in black war 
fare, a term applied to the often unrecorded yet 
decisive struggle between spies and counterspies. 
Their weapons were bribery, treachery, and sub-
version. Although inexperience resulted in some 
mistakes, the agents of the OSS were able to 
achieve considerable success and to measure up 
favorably to the professional agents of the 
European powers. 
Early success marked the efforts of the OSS 
agents who helped to pave the way for the invasion 
of North Africa. A total of 15 men were in North 
Africa for almost a year before the actual invasion, 
operating 5 secret radio stations, transmitting vital 
information which facilitated the movement of 
troops ashore, and arranging the contacts between 
representatives of the Allies and friendly elements 
in that area. The Jedburgh Mission, developed 
in 1943 by the OSS and its British opposite num-
ber, proved most successful in integrating the ac-
tivities of friendly European underground resist-
ance groups with the overall plans of the Allied 
Command. The program of this mission was to 
parachute scores of three-men teams into France, 
Belgium, and Holland on D-day ahead of ad-
vancing Allied armies, to provide resistance 
groups with military supplies, and to lead them 
in coordinated guerrilla activities designed to 
create confusion and havoc behind the German 
lines. In commenting on the success of the Jed-
burgh Mission, General Eisenhower said: "In no 
previous war, and in no other theater of this war, 
have resistance forces been so closely harnessed to 
the main military effort." 
OSS agents encouraged the labor resistance 
movement in the occupied countries of Europe, 
while in Germany itself 80 separate contacts were 
established and workers were organized even in 
the factories of the Ruhr. When Allied troops 
reached the Rhine German bargemen were avail-
able to help them cross the river. In the Balkan 
countries the OSS helped to set up successful 
escape and evasion operations. Shortly after the

surrender of Rumania a total of 1,050 airmen were 
rescued from prison camps around Bucharest. 
The extraordinary heroism and bravery of one 
OSS agent, Corp. Frederic A. Mayer, resulted in 
the declaration of Innsbruk, Austria, as an open 
city and its capture by American troops without a 
fight. In Burma, OSS personnel helped to organ-
ize a guerrilla warfare campaign against the Japa-
nese. The intelligence they gathered provided 
the basis for almost all of the combat missions 
flown in that area by the 19th Air Force. In 2i/2 
years of operations, the Kachin guerrilla forces in 
Burma killed over 5,000 Japanese troops, dis-
rupted their lines of communications, and spear-
headed the advances of the Allies under the com-
mand of Gen. Stillwell. 
Further American Expansion 
In addition to the establishment of new intelli-
gence agencies, there was a tremendous expansion 
of the older military intelligence organizations. 
For example, at the peak of its wartime effort the 
Office of Naval Intelligence had a sizable number 
of officers, enlisted men, and civilian personnel in 
the United States and scattered throughout the 
world. After the Battle of Midway, naval com-
manders came to appreciate more fully the value 
of Intelligence officers attached to their staffs for 
operational purposes. Accordingly, the demand 
quickly exceeded the supply available. A more 
detailed discussion of the development of naval 
operational intelligence will be found in chapter 
13. However, it should be noted here that intelli-
gence was recognized as an essential function of 
the staffs of the operating forces afloat. 
The surface naval forces themselves were often 
valuable sources of information. For example, 
in June 1944 the aircraft carrier, Guadcalanal, 
captured a German submarine undamaged off 
Cape Blanco, French West Africa, and obtained 
five German acoustic torpedoes, submarine code 
books and the key to their changes, and every 
chart, publication, and general order that an oper-
ating German submarine carried. These items 
were, of course, of great value to Intelligence. 
One of the greatest contributions of the United 
States to the general development of intelligence 
was in the field of amphibious warfare, where the 
closest coordination of many types of intelligence

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
activities was required to provide adequate knowl-
edge upon which to base the successful operation 
of a complex military force transported over water 
with the objective of establishing itself on an 
enemy-held shore against opposition. The mere 
fact that such an operation involved Army, Navy, 
and Air Forces required the greatest ingenuity 
and diligence on the part of Intelligence to coordi-
nate and to consolidate all the diversified knowl-
edge into a package which was comprehensible, 
usable, and effective. 
The successes of United States Intelligence in 
World War II were particularly notable because 
they were achieved primarily by personnel drawn 
from the civilian population: business and profes-
sional men and women with an infinite variety of 
vocations. At the outset urgent personnel re-
quirements permitted only cursory initial train-
ing; it had to be done on the job. Therefore mis-
takes were made, not through lack of industry and 
devotion, but because of inexperience. In the 
winter of 1944, for example, Intelligence failed to 
interpret correctly the movements of von Rund-
stedt's troops on the western front, and the Ger-
mans broke through the Allied defenses in the 
Battle of the Bulge to inflict heavy losses of men 
and materiel. 
Despite its failures and frustrations, Intelli-
gence gained recognition from military and politi-
cal leaders in the United States to a degree never 
before attained. 
The Contribution of Chinese Intelligence 
At the beginning of war in the Pacific, United 
States Navy planners recognized the importance 
of cooperation from the Nationalist Government 
of China for ultimate victory over Japan. In 
March 1942 Comdr. Milton E. Miles, now Rear 
Admiral, left for Chungking to solicit the assist-
ance of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek in obtain-
ing information regarding weather and other 
matters of vital intelligence value to the United 
States Pacific Fleet. The result of Miles' mis-
sion was the formation of the Sino-American 
Cooperative Organization (SACO) , of which he 
was Deputy Director. 
The Director of SACO was Lt. Gen. Tai Li, 
Chief of the Bureau of Investigation and Statis-
tics (BIS) of the National Military Council of 
CONFIDENTIAL 
50 
China, an intimate friend and adviser of the Gen-
eralissimo. Tai Li, known for many years as a 
mystery man of Asia, had tremendous power and 
a reputation which inspired more fear and hatred 
than admiration. As early as 1926 he had asso-
ciated himself with Chiang when the latter took 
command of the Nationalist Armies at Canton. 
During the march into North China Tai Li acted 
as an advance agent, collecting information about 
popular sentiment, military and political devel-
opments, and advantageous routes of approach. 
The intelligence he produced was an important 
factor in the successive victories which led to the 
unification of China under the Nationalist Gov-
ernment. When Chiang was captured by the 
Communists, Tai Li aided in his rescue. In 1937, 
as commander of the loyal patriotic army, Tai Li 
held Shanghai for 3 months in the face of over-
whelmingly superior Japanese forces. He had 
almost unlimited energy and stamina and acted 
with a directness that was more western than 
Oriental. Because he had escaped death so often 
he was considered invulnerable, and his avoidance 
of all personal publicity added to the aura of 
mystery which surrounded him. 
Tai Li organized China's secret police, the BIS, 
in 1932, and directed its activities until his death 
in 1946. During this period he established a 
complex network of covert agents not only 
throughout China but also in Indo-China, Burma, 
India, Bali, Borneo, Formosa, and the Philip-
pines. He controlled the uniformed police in 
Free and Occupied China, as well as the Chinese 
puppets of the Japanese. Smuggling and anti-
smuggling activities came under his jurisdiction. 
He was Director of the Bureau of Communica-
tions and Transportation and Head of the Office 
of Freight Transportation Control. Thus he 
wore many different hats which gave him a power 
not only far-reaching but even paradoxical. 
A major function of the BIS was espionage and 
counterespionage directed against Japanese spies 
and Chinese Communists. Some of its agents 
were high ranking officers, well educated and well 
trained. Others were peasants, recruited from 
Chinese families which had suffered from Japa-
nese mistreatment. Representatives were located 
in the smallest villages and largest cities of China. 
The BIS formed the nucleus of an effective guer-

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
rilla army aimed at driving the Japanese out of 
China and combatting subversive elements. 
As the Director of SACO, Tai Li contributed to 
it the full support of the Chinese Intelligence Or-
ganization, which made possible the activities of 
almost 3,000 Americans (Navy, Army, Marine 
Corps, and Coast Guard) assigned to SACO, 
known as Naval Group, China. Their responsi-
bilities included weather reporting, coastwatch-
ing, guerrilla training, and combat operations. 
Their activities were made effective by the estab-
lishment of a radio communications network. 
Weather data supplied by SACO was of signif-
icant value to the first air attacks on the Japanese 
home islands and to the attacks on Iwo Jima and 
Okinawa. Information provided by SACO 
coastwatchers on Japanese naval and merchant 
shipping was the basis for the successful sweep of 
the South China Sea and its ports in January 
1945 by the United States Fleet. SACO also 
made possible the sensational destruction of Japa-
nese ships by the United States submarine Barb, 
as well as the sinking of thousands of tons of 
Japanese shipping by other American submarines. 
Tai Li and his organization made a significant 
contribution to the successful prosecution of the 
Pacific war. His untimely death shortly after 
the war was a serious blow not only to Chinese 
Intelligence but to the Nationalist Government 
itself. 
The Expansion of Soviet Intelligence 
Occupied as they were with military and politi-
cal developments in western Europe prior to the 
outbreak of the war, the leaders of Soviet In-
telligence in no way neglected the situation in 
the Far East. The clever and adroit activities 
of their spy ring in China and Japan during the 
period from 1937 to 1941 give some indication of 
Soviet operating techniques. The principal figure 
was Dr. Richard Sorge, a German national who 
was sent as a covert agent by German Intelligence 
to the Far East in 1933 posing as a foreign news-
paper correspondent. Among his close friends 
and associates were the German Ambassador to 
Tokyo and Ozaki Hozumi, a Japanese newspaper 
man prominent in government circles and a friend 
of various members of the Imperial Cabinet. 
Together, Sorge and Hozumi cultivated a num-
51 
ber of important sources of information, includ-
ing the German, British, American, and French 
Embassies, the Dutch Legation, the Japanese War 
Ministry, and the Japanese cabinet itself. From 
them they gathered invaluable data including esti-
mates and opinions at the highest official levels, 
which they evaluated and forwarded not to Berlin 
but to Moscow by means of radio, by courier 
through Shanghai, or through the Soviet Em-
bassy in Tokyo. The significance of their efforts 
is revealed by some of the reports transmitted to 
the Kremlin. In 1937, when the Japanese attacked 
China, Sorge reported that there would be no 
attack against the U. S. S. R. in Siberia. In May 
1941, Moscow was warned that the Germans would 
attack the U. S. S. R. along the entire western 
frontier on 20 June with a force of from 170 to 
190 divisions, the major objective being Moscow. 
The actual attack came on 22 June. In October 
1941, Sorge forwarded his well-documented con-
clusion that the Japanese would attack to the south 
in Asia and that there was no serious danger of 
any attack along the Siberian frontier. On the 
basis of this information the Soviets were able to 
transfer large units of their forces in eastern Si-
beria to the western front to strengthen their de-
fenses against the Nazi invasion. It is somewhat 
ironic that Sorge's activities were revealed by a 
Japanese Communist. 
A tendency of the Soviet leaders to permit the 
reports of their Communist friends in foreign 
countries to override the reports of other units in 
their intelligence system is shown by their initial 
reaction to indications of Hitler's decision to attack 
the U. S. S. R. The Communists inside Germany 
are believed to have reported that the Germans 
would refuse to march into the Soviet Union. 
When the attack actually came, the Soviets were 
taken by surprise. 
As the war progressed, the Soviets were able 
to take full advantage of association with their 
wartime partners in the expansion and extension 
of their intelligence activities. In the United 
States since 1924 there had been an organization 
known as Amtorg, created for the purpose of pur-
chasing all kinds of material for the Soviet Union. 
During the war the activities of this organization 
were intensified, together with those of the Soviet 
Purchasing Commission which worked closely with

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Amtorg. In addition to the procurement of mate-
rial, the collection of detailed information con-
cerning American industry was stepped up. 
Factory techniques, production statistics and labor 
relations were all matters of great interest, in 
addition to any fact which might have future in-
telligence value. As one example, all of the Amer-
ican patents concerned with carbon compounds 
were purchased?a total of about 30,000 in this 
field alone. By 1946 a comprehensive catalogue 
had been compiled of every mill, factory, refinery, 
and engineering plant in the United States. The 
Four Continent Book Corporation in New York 
City was developed as an agency for the purchase 
and transmittal of American technical publica-
tions, trade papers, and patents. In addition, it 
handled Communist propaganda literature in 
English and Spanish, forwarding the latter to 
various Latin American countries. 
By 1944 Soviet intelligence and propaganda ac-
tivities were expanded in Latin American coun-
tries through Soviet diplomatic representatives. 
In Mexico an extensive organization was devel-
oped for the purpose of destroying American in-
fluence first in Mexico and later in other countries 
of South America. As a part of this process, the 
Soviets aimed at the elimination of American busi-
ness interests and the eventual domination of the 
economies of these countries. Various cultural 
organizations were fostered, such as the Russian-
Mexican Clubs, to serve as propaganda media and 
sources of information. 
In Europe, during the war, a new counterintelli-
gence agency was created. It was known as 
"Smersh"?from the Russian words: "death to 
spies." It seems to have been organized originally 
in connection with the administration of the Soviet 
occupied areas of Europe, and was concerned with 
disaffection among Soviet troops and anticommu-
nism in any form. By painstaking processes it 
attempted to liquidate all individuals who were 
not proCommunist, including those active in any 
democratic-type parties, throughout Poland, 
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, and the 
Carpatho-Ukraine. Its carefully selected person-
nel, intensely loyal to the Soviet State, showed no 
mercy or compassion in their work. 
While positive information is not available, 
"Smersh" appears to have been organized into five 
CONFIDENTIAL 
52 
major departments: administration, operations, 
investigations, prosecution, and personnel. With 
central headquarters in Moscow, there were sub-
divisions established for each military district in 
Russia, as well as in Europe. Agents were at-
tached to all units of the Soviet Army, and net-
works of spies and informers were set up in the 
occupied countries, to make particular note of 
trends in political thought. The investigations 
department developed the science of interrogation 
to a high degree of perfection, while the prosecu-
tion department utilized three men courts to dis-
pose of those found guilty. 
Prior to World War II many improvements had 
been made in the functional organization of the 
Soviet military staff. One of these was an in-
creased emphasis on intelligence, notable because 
this function was weak in the staff organizations 
of both the Tzarist and early Soviet armies. Re-
vised military doctrine now included a reconnais-
sance, or intelligence, section at the division level, 
headed by a chief of section. He was responsible 
for the preparation of the reconnaissance plan, 
including air reconnaissance; the assignment of 
missions to subordinate agencies; the maintenance 
of the enemy situation map; the collection and 
analysis of information; keeping the commander 
and chief of staff informed of all intelligence in-
formation; and the dissemination of information 
to higher, coordinate, and subordinate units. Dur-
ing the war the intelligence organizations of the 
Army and the Navy apparently functioned sep-
arately; however, by 1946, there was some evidence 
that they had been combined. 
The pattern of Soviet Intelligence operations 
which seemed to emerge during the war period 
was that of comprehensive, overlapping informer 
networks within all countries under Soviet rule 
and of burrowing, multiplying systems of sym-
pathizers and agents within foreign countries of 
exploitable interest. The extensiveness of its op-
erations abroad was to be clearly demonstrated in 
the postwar period. 
THE POSTWAR PERIOD 
Great enthusiasm throughout most of the world 
greeted the unconditional surrender of Germany 
and Japan, the inauguration of the United Na-
tions Organization, and prospects for world peace.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
Amidst the glow of military victories the wartime 
Allies frequently met to chart a new world of 
freedom and prosperity. But many boldly pro-
jected plans failed to materialize, diametrically 
opposed points of view were bared, and even peace 
treaties were delayed interminably by disagree-
ments or failed completely of final approval by 
all concerned, as in the cases of Germany, Austria, 
and Japan. Two contrary concepts of world re-
lationships became more clearly defined in the 
opposing policies of the United States and the 
U. S. S. R. Gradually the peoples of the western 
world, especially in the United States, became 
aware of a new threat to their political and social 
institutions and their way of life. 
The aggressive ideology and world power ob-
jectives of the Soviet Government found expres-
sion in the absorption of the countries of Eastern 
Europe, a closely knit alliance with Communist 
China, and the encouragement of Communist or-
ganizations throughout the rest of the world. In 
an effort to counter these activities, the United 
States assumed world leadership to aid in reestab-
lishing the economic stability of those countries 
ravaged by the war but as yet free of Communist 
domination. Economic stability was considered 
to be fundamental to political and military sta-
bility, and through the improvement of standards 
of living the United States sought to destroy the 
conditions of poverty upon which Soviet propa-
ganda most effectively feeds. The Truman Doc-
trine of 1947 brought economic and military 
assistance to Greece and Turkey threatened by 
Soviet penetration. The European Recovery 
Program of 1948, popularly known as the Mar-
shall Plan, had as its objective the restoration of 
the economic productivity of Europe and the 
healthy employment of all its peoples. This am-
bitious program was gradually extended in a les-
ser degree to other parts of the world. In 1951 
the United States frankly embarked on a Mutual 
Security Program which tied together economic 
assistance and military cooperation. 
The outbreak of the war in Korea in June 1950 
brought into clearer focus the grim realities of 
the so-called "cold war," a term descriptive of 
various forms of the conflict between Communist 
and non-Communist countries which had been un-
derway for a number of years but which became 
58 
more apparent after World War II. In the light 
of postwar experience, some earlier events as-
sumed even greater significance than they did at 
the time. In 1943, for example, a group of young 
physicists working in the radiation laboratory of 
the University of California turned over to a 
Communist agent technical data for transmittal to 
a Soviet Vice-Consul. In 1944 Soviet representa-
tives in South and Central America were ordered 
back to Moscow for retraining. By that time the 
military defeat of Germany was assured, so that 
Soviet emphasis could again be directed toward 
bringing about the political and economic collapse 
of the non-Communist countries of the west. 
To achieve this ultimate objective, the Soviet 
Government has employed, initially at least, 
methods other than the force of arms. Penetra-
tion and subversion, propaganda and detailed 
organization have proved to be highly effective in 
various countries. The use of nationals as agents 
within their own countries has presented a most 
difficult problem for the counterintelligence agen-
cies of those countries. The Soviets have imple-
mented a plan to collect great quantities of 
information about non-Communist countries, ob-
viously in order to determine strengths and weak-
nesses. During this "cold war" Intelligence has 
assumed even greater importance than during 
World War II. The scope and methods of Soviet 
Intelligence in the postwar period have been indi-
cated by the disclosure of some of its activities in 
various parts of the world. 
Soviet Intelligence in Canada 
In September 1945 Igor Gouzenko, a cipher 
clerk in the Soviet Embassy at Ottawa, deter-
mined to expose the activities of Soviet agents 
and sympathizers in Canada. The documented 
information which he was able to furnish to the 
Royal Commission finally appointed to conduct a 
full investigation was a startling revelation of the 
extensiveness of the Soviet intelligence system in 
Canada, the type of individuals who were in-
volved, and the nature of the information which 
was being transmitted to Moscow. The impor-
tance attached by the Soviet Embassy to Gou-
zenko's testimony and substantiating documents 
was indicated by the strenuous efforts made to re-
gain custody of both.

INTELLIGENCE FOR 
The evidence uncovered by the Royal Commis-
sion definitely revealed the existence in Canada of 
a fifth column, organized and directed by Soviet 
agents. Within this fifth column were a number 
of spy rings, possibly as many as five, of which de-
tailed information was available only on the one 
headed by Col. Nicolai Zabotin, Soviet Military 
Attache in Ottawa. Additional rings appeared to 
be operated by the MVD, the Naval Attache, the 
commercial and political representatives, and the 
Embassy itself. Each of these rings was com-
pletely independent of the others, using separate 
codes and agents, and was apparently organized 
rather simply into various cells composed of 
agents working on similar tasks. Only one agent 
in each cell had contact with a Soviet representa-
tive and each made use of a "cover" name. The 
Royal Commission concluded that the Soviet or-
ganization in Canada was the product of careful 
and detailed preparation by trained men. Of sig-
nificance were the indications that the Canadian 
organizations were associated with similar ones 
in other countries, notably Great Britain and the 
United States. 
In Zabotin's ring only two individuals were Rus-
sian-born, and these had become naturalized Ca-
nadian citizens: Sam Carr, the Organizing Sec-
retary of the Canadian Communist Party, and 
Fred Rose, a member of Parliament. The re-
mainder were Canadian or British by birth and 
were motivated by Communist sympathies. Money 
was apparently of only incidental concern. 
Scientists and civil servants were especially cul-
tivated by Zabotin who approached them through 
local Communists, fellow travellers, and sym-
pathizers attending study-groups and special lec-
tures. The care with which prospective agents 
were selected is indicated by the positions held by 
those found guilty of turning over classified in-
formation to Soviet representatives: a senior 
worker with the National Research Council; two 
additional members of this Council who supplied 
information regarding explosives, atomic energy, 
and aircraft development; an employee in the Of-
fice of the High Commissioner of the United King-
dom; an employee in the Department of Muni-
tions and Supply; and a staff member of the cipher 
division of the Canadian Department of External 
Affairs. The most prominent individual involved

was Dr. Allan Nunn May, a nuclear scientist em-
ployed in research for the Canadian Atomic En-
ergy project at Montreal. The investigation dis-
closed that he had been a Communist before coming 
to Canada. The Royal Commission was particu-
larly astounded by the success of the Soviets in 
enlisting Canadians in positions of responsibility 
and trust who were willing to betray their country. 
Since the activities of Soviet Intelligence had 
been going on for some years, it was difficult to 
determine the amount of information which the 
Soviets had managed to accumulate. The evi-
dence indicated, however, that a considerable 
quantity of classified information had been trans-
mitted with regularity from various Government 
departments and agencies. Specific information 
included samples of uranium ore; data about 
atomic plants and processes; 'details of Asdic, a 
submarine detection device; formula of new ex-
plosives and blueprints of fuzes, such as the V. T. 
fuze; economic reports; and political reports, in-
cluding diplomatic messages exchanged with Great 
Britain and the United States. Of particular 
significance was the fact that much of the infor-
mation sought was technical and concerned the 
postwar defenses of Canada, Great Britain, and 
the United States. 
Two interesting Soviet Intelligence procedures 
were revealed by Gouzenko. The first was Zabo-
tin's plan to arrange for the entry into Canada of 
additional agents under the guise of personnel 
attached to a proposed Soviet Trade Mission. The 
second was the use of forged passports to permit 
the entry of agents into other countries from 
Canada. 
Soviet Intelligence in the United States 
The Report of the Canadian Royal Commission, 
published in June 1946, excited worldwide atten-
tion and particularly, attention was given to it in 
the United States where the evidence indicated 
that similar Soviet organizations were operating. 
Several Congressional committees found new 
sources of information regarding un-American 
activities and accumulated volumes of data. 
These committees were aided materially by a few 
repentant American Communists who, like Gou-
zenko, found themselves completely disillusioned 
by the wide gulf between Communist promises and

practices. Louis F. Budenz, editor of the official 
newspaper of the American Communist Party, 
the Daily Worker, was one such person. His testi-
mony, given in November 1946, disclosed the close 
relationship between American and Soviet Com-
munists. Further, it gave clues to the activities 
of Soviet agents operating in the United States. 
Gerhart Eisler, for example, was pointed out 
as the representative of International Communism 
in the United States and, as such, the boss of all 
American Communists. His true position could 
not be determined, but his status as a representa-
tive was substantiated. Eisler, a professional 
revolutionist, was active in the United States dur-
ing the 1930's, speaking before many groups, help-
ing to organize Communists and Communist sym-
pathizers, and identifying those who might be en-
couraged to aid the Communist cause. During 
the war years he may well have headed a Soviet 
spy network. In the late 1940's he evidently con-
centrated on artists, writers, and intellectuals. He 
was reported to have said that New York City 
would become the center of International Com-
munism outside of Russia. Because of the dis-
closures before the House Un-American Activities 
Committee in early 1947, Eisler was no longer use-
ful to the Soviet effort in this country. He es-
caped to Europe and later turned up as an official 
for the East German Government, operating under 
direct Soviet control. 
In July 1948 Elizabeth Bentley testified on her 
activities as a courier for a Soviet espionage system 
in the United States during the war. She col-
lected information from various Government em-
ployees in Washington, and turned it over to 
Soviet representatives in New York for transmit-
tal to Moscow. Her contacts in Washington were 
individuals employed by such Federal Depart-
ments as State, Treasury, Army, the War Produc-
tion Board, and the Office of Strategic Services. 
Among those she incriminated was William W. 
Remington who was first employed by the War 
Production Board and later by the Department of 
Commerce. In both these positions he had access 
to secret information, and in Commerce he headed 
a committee responsible for the clearance of mate-
rials for export to the Soviet Union. Unlike 
Gouzenko in Canada, Bentley was unable to docu-
ment her testimony.

CONFIDENTIAL 
During the summer of 1948 Whittaker Cham-
bers, reformed American Communist and a senior 
editor of Time magazine, appeared before the 
House Un-American Activities Committee in 
Washington. He described in detail his activities 
as a Communist from 1924 until 1938, when, dis-
illusioned and embittered, he renounced com-
munism and determined to expose the Soviet ac-
tivities of which he had been a part. Of primary 
interest was his work as an underground courier 
for a Communist cell, from 1934 to 1938, collecting 
classified information in Washington and carrying 
it to a Soviet agent named Colonel Bykoff in New 
York City. The purpose of this cell was the col-
lection of military and political information from 
the State Department. The sensational aspect of 
Chambers' testimony was his ability to produce 
documentary evidence which included copies and 
photographs of highly important British naval 
papers and extremely confidential reports from 
China, Yugoslavia, and Poland. The keys to cer-
tain secret American diplomatic codes were also 
involved. These substantiating documents proved 
beyond question that in 1938 some individual in 
the State Department had made important classi-
fied information available to him. That individ-
ual, according to Chambers, was Alger Hiss, a 
brilliant young man in the State Department, a 
prominent figure in the creation of the United 
Nations, and president of the Carnegie Endow-
ment for International Peace. Volumes of evi-
dence were accumulated in the succeeding sensa-
tional Hiss-Chambers legal actions which finally 
resulted in the conviction of Alger Hiss for per-
jury and a sentence of 5 years imprisonment. 
Additional cases involving suspected Soviet es-
pionage and Communist activities continued to be 
brought to light in the United States. In the 
spring of 1949 the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation released evidence against Judith Coplon, 
first employed by the Justice Department in its 
economic warfare section and later assigned to its 
internal security section as a political analyst. 
She was accused on two counts: taking unlawful 
possession of Government documents and spying 
for a foreign power. Her contact was a Soviet 
engineer employed by the United Nations secre-
tariat in New York. Her sensationalized trial on 
the first count in Washington resulted in convic-

tion, although subsequent trials on the second 
count in New York City failed of conviction be-
cause of certain legal technicalities. 
During 1949 and 1950, while the Justice De-
partment was prosecuting the leaders of the 
American Communist Party for conspiracy 
against the United States Government, the FBI 
was accumulating evidence against other individ-
uals suspected of treason in connection with the 
atomic bomb and military uses of atomic energy. 
In May 1950 Harry Gold confessed that, in 1944 
and 1945, he had acted as a courier in relaying 
atomic information to a Soviet agent for transmis-
sion to the U. S. S. R. His motives appeared to be 
basically ideological. His confession involved Al-
fred Dean Slack, a chemist, and David Greenglass, 
a New York machinist. The former was charged 
with revealing details of the manufacture of 
RDX, a secret high explosive developed during 
the war, and supplying a sample. The latter con-
fessed to turning over sketches and descriptions 
of the atomic bomb while he was employed at Los 
Alamos, N. Mex., working on the top secret Man-
hattan project. These men in turn incriminated 
other individuals including Ethel and Julius 
Rosenberg and Martin Sobell. These were accused 
of complicity in espionage work for Soviet Intel-
ligence, transmitting information concerning the 
atomic bomb. 
The evidence presented during these trials was 
startling. It became apparent that the Soviet 
Union had gained considerable information about 
the Manhattan project and the work of some of 
its scientists during the latter months of 1941; fur-
ther, that the schedule for the explosion of the 
first atomic bomb at Alamagordo was known at 
least a month in advance. Months before the first 
bomb was dropped on Hiroshima the Soviets had 
learned the principles of its construction. Rosen-
berg stated that he had procured information per-
taining to the use of atomic energy for aircraft. 
The series of shocking disclosures in the postwar 
period clearly indicated that Soviet Intelligence 
had developed intricate systems of covert agents 
in the United States for the purpose of channeling 
vital information of a political, military and scien-
tific nature to Moscow through both official and 
unofficial representatives.

Soviet Intelligence in Great Britain 
The Canadian Spy Case and the disclosures in 
the United States had eventual repercussions in 
Great Britain. Tipped off by the FBI, Scotland 
Yard initiated investigations which resulted in 
1950 in the apprehension of Dr. Emil Julius Klaus 
Fuchs, head of the Ministry of Supply's Theo-
retical Physics Division and the deputy chief 
scientific officer at Harwell, England's principal 
atomic installation. Fuchs was accused of releas-
ing American atomic secrets to Soviet representa-
tives in 1945 and British secrets in 1947. His con-
fession left no doubt as to his guilt. While the 
amount of information he had given was not pub-
licly announced for security reasons, it was appar-
ent that Fuchs had detailed knowledge of the con-
struction of atomic bombs and, further, that he 
was conversant with the initial studies for the hy-
drogen bomb. The tremendous advantages accru-
ing to the Soviets from this information are diffi-
cult to estimate, although it is obvious that their 
atomic program was greatly advanced. At the 
same time irreparable harm was done to the na-
tional security of both Great Britain and the 
United States. 
The investigations of Fuchs revealed that he 
had been a Communist for many years and that 
his motivation, like so many others already men-
tioned, was ideological. He was the scientist from 
whom Harry Gold had received his information, 
and his confession was of material assistance in 
the prosecution of Gold, Greenglass, and others. 
Soviet Intelligence in Sweden 
In September 1951 the long suspected activities 
of Soviet espionage in Sweden were dramatically 
exposed. A 42-year-old petty officer in the Royal 
Swedish Navy, Ernst Hilding Andersson, was 
accused of betraying military secrets to a foreign 
power, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to 
life imprisonment. From 1949 to 1951 he had pre-
pared and transmitted reports and maps of the 
defenses of naval bases at Stockholm and Karls-
krona, and of an air base, naval station, and the 
Boden fortress in northern Sweden. His three 
contact men were: a former Soviet Embassy sec-
retary, a former Tass news-agency correspondent, 
and an assistant to the Soviet Naval Attach6. 
While small money payments were made for in-

formation delivered, Andersson's motivation was 
to aid communism. Investigation showed that 
he had become a Communist in 1928, but that his 
first assignment in espionage was not made until 
1949. 
According to the Swedish Chief of Staff, incal-
culable damage to Sweden's security had been 
caused by Andersson's activities. Even more 
harmful, perhaps, were the similar efforts of 
Fritiof Enborn, a Swedish journalist, discovered. 
in February 1952. Sweden faced a new threat to 
her security and national defense system. 
Soviet Activities in South America 
In Mexico the Communist group appeared to 
fall into three categories: the professional agents, 
carefully trained in the art of collecting informa-
tion and spreading Soviet propaganda; the ideal-
ists, motivated by the propaganda; and the 
fellow travelers, inspired by their own liberalism. 
The Soviet Embassy in Mexico City made use of 
each category to promote its primary objectives 
of propaganda, penetration, and the destruction 
of the economic position of the United States and 
its favorable pan-American relationships. 
The Mexican pattern was apparent in other 
countries. In Guatemala in 1951 there were 
charges that the Communists were infiltrating both 
the government and labor. A primary target was 
the United Fruit Co. which was harassed by 
strikes and one-sided labor laws. In Chile the 
large and active Communist Party encouraged a 
series of strikes in the copper mines which helped 
precipitate a copper shortage crisis in the rearma-
ment program of the United States. In Panama 
the Communists attempted to capitalize on the po-
litical unrest in the country. 
In the postwar period, there were other positive 
indications and significant disclosures of Soviet 
Intelligence activities in various trouble spots of 
the world. The United States and her Allies 
found themselves faced with the necessity of com-
batting diverse problems of major proportions. 
The Readjustment of the United States Intelligence 
Effort 
At the end of World War II the demobilization 
of the Armed Forces was accelerated almost to a 
point of disintegration, at least from the point of 
269190-54----5 
view of ready effectiveness. The drastic reduction 
in personnel seriously affected all military activi-
ties and especially those of Intelligence. For ex-
ample, by 1946 the strength of Naval Intelligence 
had dropped sharply from its wartime peak. Pre-
war problems of Intelligence, such as personnel 
and production, once again developed, though to a 
lesser degree because of what appeared to be a 
positive if gradual change in both the popular and 
official point of view towards Intelligence. 
Even before the end of the war, top level plan-
ners had become convinced of the need for a perma-
nent well coordinated national Intelligence system. 
The result was the passage of the National Se-
curity Act of 1947 which for the first time in 
the history of the Nation, outlined the structure 
of such a system to operate in times of war and 
peace. 
The deterioration of the international political 
situation created urgent demands upon all intelli-
gence agencies. Moving into Greece to aid in the 
defense of that country, the United States Army 
was immediately involved in problems arising 
from guerrilla warfare and the infiltration 
of communist groups from the Sovietized Balkan 
countries. In Western Europe, advance informa-
tion concerning the trends of Soviet activities was 
essential to the formulation of any military or 
foreign policies which would effectively protect 
the interests of the United States in that area. 
Months in advance information was obtained 
regarding Soviet plans to blockade Berlin. The 
communist coup in Czechoslovakia was anticipated 
by 3 months. Evidence was accumulated to show 
that the Soviet Union was supplying arms and am-
munition to Communist groups in France and 
Italy. In the spring of 1948 events in Europe gave 
rise to serious misgivings that the Soviet Union 
might be contemplating offensive military action. 
Under terrific pressure, the Central Intelligence 
Agency produced an estimate that such action 
would not take place within the next 2 months 
and, in all probability, not within a year. 
With the outbreak of war in Korea the Navy, 
Army, and Air Force were faced with many se-
rious problems, including an acute shortage of 
Intelligence personnel and data. Drawing sub-
stantially upon their reserve organizations, the 
military services overcame these shortages and

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
rapidly increased the production of intelligence 
for operational purposes. Once again the need 
for intelligence was clearly demonstrated. 
POSTWAR INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS 
The impact of the cold war in the postwar 
period is shown by the emphasis given to intelli-
gence organizations and activities by both larger 
and smaller nations of the world. 
The United States intelligence system is dis-
cussed in detail in chapter 3 of this text, but 
certain general developments in military intelli-
gence should be mentioned here. Intelligence ac-
tivities have been expanded in order to provide 
the intelligence required for strategic planning. 
Broad programs involving research and special 
studies of foreign powers have been undertaken. 
Increasing importance has been placed on person-
nel training through the encouragement of reserve 
intelligence units and an emphasis on training 
schools for both regular and reserve officers. There 
has been some indication of a trend in the Army 
and the Navy to encourage officer personnel to spe-
cialize in intelligence work. Gen. Omar N. Brad-
ley, Army Chief of Staff, has been quoted as say-
ing: "I am recommending to the General Staff 
that the Army establish an Intelligence Corps in 
which personnel can specialize in Intelligence just 
as artillery men concentrate on guns, and armored 
corps men on tanks." The training of personnel 
assigned to attache posts has been improved. The 
work of counterintelligence has received more and 
more attention. 
As a newcomer to the field of intelligence, the 
United States has learned much in a relatively 
short period of time. Intelligence organizations 
have improved the quality of their product, and 
despite "growing-pains" have accomplished a 
great deal. 
The British Intelligence Service 
The British intelligence service is composed of 
several intelligence agencies. Of special impor-
tance is the British secret service whose operations 
and organization are closely guarded secrets. For 
budgetary purposes it is sponsored in Parliament 
by the British foreign office. Appropriations for 
the secret service are usually passed without com-
ment, and if a question is ever raised, the foreign 
CONFIDENTIAL 
58 
secretary replies that the matter is a secret of state 
which, if revealed, would no longer be secret. The 
British secret service corresponds, in many of its 
functions, to the United States Central Intelligence 
Agency. 
The war office, the admiralty and the air minis-
tries have separate intelligence agencies which co-
operate closely with the British secret service and 
other agencies. The military intelligence division 
(MID) is divided into some 20 different depart-
ments. In addition to purely military matters, 
sections of MID deal with the problems of spies 
at home, in the dominions and British possessions, 
and in foreign countries. The naval intelligence 
division is also divided into several departments 
for specialized work, as is the air intelligence 
division. 
Another organization of the British intelligence 
service is generally referred to as MI 5. This 
organization is devoted to counterespionage and 
security. It has jurisdiction in the British Isles 
and in the British possessions overseas. Many of 
its functions are similar to those of the United 
States Federal Bureau of Investigation. MI 5 
cooperates closely with the special branch of Scot-
land Yard as well as with the British secret service 
and the military intelligence agencies. 
The special branch of Scotland Yard, which 
may be included as a part of the British intelli-
gence service, is charged with guarding the Royal 
Family and important British officials and visiting 
foreign dignitaries. It is also concerned with 
counterespionage and problems of national secu-
rity. Some of its functions are similar to those 
of the United States Secret Service and the United 
States Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
There are several British joint intelligence com-
mittees and boards which include representatives 
from the major British intelligence agencies, mil-
itary and civilian. These joint committees and 
boards are subordinate to the British military 
chiefs of staff, though they contain civilian repre-
sentation. These committees and boards prepare 
estimates of all kinds and serve all interested min-
istries of the British Government.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
Contre Espionenage (SDECE.). It was established 
under this name in December 1945 and is a devel-
opment of intelligence organizations which oper-
ated under General de Gaulle from 1940 to 1945. 
General de Gaulle set up the Bureau Central de 
1?enseignements et d'Action (BCRA) in London 
in 1940. This was an expansion of the Service de 
Renseignements (SR) , a part of the old Deuxieme 
Bureau of the French General Staff. After Gen-
eral de Gaulle left London and went to Algiers, he 
combined the BCRA with an intelligence organi-
zation of General Giraud and created a new intel-
ligence organization called the Direction Generale 
des Services Speciaux (DGSS) . The DGSS was 
replaced shortly after the liberation of most of 
France by an intelligence organization called the 
Direction Generale des Etudes et de Recherches 
(DGER), out of which SDECE directly evolved. 
Historically, the Deuxieme Bureau of the 
French general staff has been the most important 
French intelligence organization. In the post 
World War II organization of French Intelli-
gence, the SDECE appears to have taken over 
most of the functions of the traditional general 
staff Deuxieme Bureau, leaving to the Deuxiemes 
Bureaux of the armed services responsibility 
mainly for operational military intelligence. The 
SDECE is subordinate to the French national de-
fense ministry and is divided into two main sec-
tions (called by the French, Offensive and Defen-
sive) which are concerned respectively with stra-
tegic intelligence and counterintelligence. The 
Surete Nationale, under the French interior min-
istry, is also a part of the French Intelligence 
system. The Surete is similar in some respects to 
the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation 
and the British Scotland Yard. 
The Soviet Intelligence System 
Often described as omnipotent and omnipresent, 
the Soviet intelligence system is in many respects 
unique in the postwar world. It is a vast, intri-
cate organization with an incredible amount of 
duplication and involving literally millions of 
people. With its two-pronged objective of inter-
nal security and external espionage, it maintains 
agents in every village of the U. S. S. R. and 
agents or potential agents in all countries of the 
59 
world where there are Soviet diplomats, trade rep-
resentatives or Communist Party groups. 
Within the U. S. S. R., the intelligence-security 
system is the cornerstone of the police state, re-
sponsible for insuring rigid political and eco-
nomic controls and rooting out all dissident ele-
ments. It can be assumed that the average So-
viet citizen is aware of the secret police to the ex-
tent that he knows he must remain where he is 
registered, perform his work satisfactorily, and 
refrain from any criticism of the government. 
He must also hope that his relatives and friends 
will do likewise. Should there be any deviation 
from the established pattern, he can anticipate 
severe punishment including death or hard labor 
in a penal camp. Within the borders of the coun-
try, the closest observation is maintained not only 
over all citizens but also over all visitors. 
Abroad, the strength of Soviet Intelligence lies 
basically in the worldwide organization of the 
Communist Party. As already indicated, the So-
viets have emphasized the use of agents who are 
citizens of the country in which they are to oper-
ate. These prospective collectors of information, 
recruited by the regular Communist Party organ-
ization, are fellow travellers and sympathizers not 
known as Communists. Either they are already 
in an exploitable position or possess the necessary 
qualifications. Sold on the basic doctrines of com-
munism, these individuals transfer their loyalties 
from their own country to the U. S. S. R. They 
are given small sums of money for "expenses" and 
so become subject to blackmail. Each new recruit 
becomes the member of an independent cell, but 
only the leader of the cell has a direct Soviet con-
tact. Thus this system is capable of almost in-
definite expansion and, of even greater impor-
tance, is subject to a minimum risk of exposure. 
In connection with this recruitment program, So-
viet Intelligence has an amazingly complete dos-
sier coverage of individuals all over the world: 
their appearance, interests, weaknesses, and politi-
cal inclinations. 
The counterintelligence activity of the Soviets 
is particularly noteworthy. Its defensive effec-
tiveness makes the term "Iron Curtain" most ap-
propriate. No one may cross the borders of the 
U. S. S. R. without great hazards of detection. 
All means of communications are rigidly con-

trolled, and the gathering of any information in-
side the country by foreign agents is notoriously 
difficult. The offensive aspects of Soviet counter-
intelligence are even more unique and constitute 
a Russian contribution to modern intelligence. 
The objective is the dissemination of false infor-
mation designed to mislead and confuse opponents 
and prospective victims. Seemingly "anti-Com-
munist" propaganda and individuals are skillfully 
utilized in a cleverly organized program. 
The controls of this tremendous organization 
were further overhauled and centralized at the top 
level in 1946. As a result, the major agencies pri-
marily concerned with intelligence activities from 
1946 to 1953 were: Military Intelligence, and the 
Ministry of State Security, or MG-B, formerly 
known as NKGB. During this period the MVD, 
Ministry of Internal Affairs (the former NKVD), 
appeared to have lost most of its police and intel-
ligence functions. 
Currently, the Military Intelligence organiza-
tion, known as GRU, is a part of the Soviet gen-
eral staff. From the military point of view, it 
is interested in political events and economic con-
ditions abroad and so collects information for in-
telligence purposes all over the world, It also di-
rects foreign sabotage. It maintains networks of 
agents, directed both by military attaches and by 
special agents assigned cover positions in Soviet 
diplomatic and consular posts. 
From 1946 to 1953 MGB had broad responsi-
bilities for political espionage and propaganda 
abroad and for the control of espionage activities 
of foreign Communist Parties. Its foreign de-
partment, known as INO, maintained an agent in 
every Soviet diplomatic, consular, and trading 
mission abroad. KRU, another department, had 
the objective of countering foreign political es-
pionage in the Soviet Union and the activities of 
anti-Soviet groups abroad. EKU, the economic 
department, was organized originally to control 
foreign economic activity within the U. S. S. R. 
Later it was composed of two sections: the first 
exercised political control over the domestic econ-
omy by means of secret police; the second directed 
external economic espionage and encouraged class 
warfare, industrial crises, and strikes. Two other 
departments, SPU and DTU, had responsibilities 
within the U. S. S. R. and were charged, respec-
CONFIDENTIAL 
60 
tively, with purging counterrevolutionary activi-
ties and suppressing espionage or sabotage activi-
ties directed against transportation. The careful 
correlation of all foreign intelligence at the top 
level was accomplished to formulate or to revise 
Soviet foreign policies. 
The personnel of MGB included: border guards 
and internal troops; specially trained spies and 
covert agents; highly placed Soviet citizens, who 
were not only specialists in such fields as econom-
ics, foreign trade, education and cultural activi-
ties, but also were well-trained in the work of in-
telligence; unofficial Soviet citizens who were na-
tionals of various satellite governments; and for-
eign Communist Party members. The Soviet 
Union has maintained the largest diplomatic corps 
of any country in the world, and the size of indi-
vidual missions has been far in excess of normal 
requirements. For example, in Ottawa the 
U. S. S. R. has maintained a diplomatic staff of 
70, as compared with maximums of 12 to 24 main-
tained by other countries. In Cairo the Soviet 
Ambassador has had a staff of more than 300; 
while the Egyptian Ambassador in Moscow has 
had fewer than 12. In London the U. S. S. R. has 
had more than 250 persons representing various 
agencies; while in Washington it has had approxi-
mately 1,100 official representatives. At the same 
time, in Moscow Great Britain was limited to 32 
representatives and the United States to about 175. 
The MVD cooperated with the MGB and con-
trolled the administration of the slave labor 
camps. It had its own troops, politically reliable 
and ready to crush any armed revolt within the 
country. Its activities were primarily internal. 
However, shortly after the dramatic announce-
ments of Stalin's serious illness and death in 
March 1953, news releases from Moscow revealed 
an important administrative reorganization of the 
Soviet Intelligence System. The MGB and the 
MVD were combined as the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. 
There are several possible weaknesses of Soviet 
Intelligence. The most vital may be that of inter-
nal suspicion. In striving for the greatest possi-
ble efficiency, Soviet leaders place little trust in 
their operatives, whom they keep under careful 
surveillance, including even their diplomatic rep-
resentatives. Complete thoroughness may, in it-

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
self, become a weakness. A second possible weak-
ness, similar to that of the Nazi Germans, is an 
emphasis on intensive training for their agents 
which has led to standardized methods and reac-
tions. While there is no way to determine the 
degree of success of Soviet agents, the fact that 
some of them have been discovered, especially in 
the United States, indicates that they are not com-
pletely successful. 
Since it must answer to only a small group of 
Communist leaders, Soviet Intelligence has almost 
absolute power. It acts as the eyes, ears, and 
punishing arm of the government in authority. 
Fear is one of its most effective weapons. There 
are, however, indications of an underground op-
position movement, especially in satellite areas, en-
gaged in sabotage and propaganda warfare on a 
considerable scale. 
The organization of Soviet Intelligence is fur-
ther strengthened by the intelligence agencies of 
the various satellite countries, including Poland, 
Hungary, Rumania, and Czechoslovakia. Each 
of these countries is engaged in intelligence activi-
ties which seem to be geared to those of the Soviet 
Union. The extent of these activities is illus-
trated by Hungary, for example, which has an or-
ganization out of all proportion to its size, inter-
est, and national income. 
The Rebirth of German Intelligence 
The political and economic conditions in post-
war Germany, divided as it has been into eastern 
and western zones, have led to underground re-
sistance movements with several intelligence or-
ganizations, each active in espionage, sabotage, 
and propaganda. The "Fighters Against Inhu-
manity" and the "Investigating Committee of 
Free Jurists in the Soviet Zone" are two such 
groups directing their activities against the Soviet 
occupation forces and the Soviet-sponsored Com-
munist Government in East Germany. The "Red 
Gestapo" is a security service organized by the 
East German Government to combat the covert 
activities of the West German groups. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A review of the development of the intelligence 
activities and organizations of various countries 
of the world throughout recorded history points 
CONFIDENTIAL 
up certain general principles and significant les-
sons. First of all, intelligence as activity is a 
product of war and the fear of war. In one form 
or another, it has always been an inevitable ad-
junct of military activity and command. Its de-
velopment, therefore, has been associated with that 
of military forces. History has shown that no 
major military endeavor has been better than the 
staff responsible for its direction. At the same 
time, the degree of the success of any major staff 
effort has often been proportionate to the knowl-
edge, or intelligence, upon which that effort was 
based. 
Intelligence has been used for other purposes as 
well. Wisely employed, it has given direction and 
meaning to the foreign policies of nations. 
Basely subverted, it has supported and maintained 
the autocratic power and authority of police 
states. 
There are many lessons of importance to be 
learned from the history of intelligence. Of these 
there are six which seem to have particular sig-
nificance. The first is the demonstrated need for 
continuity of performance. No successful organi-
zation can be improvised overnight: years of ad-
vance planning and preparation are required. 
Collection and production are effective only on a 
longterm basis. This means that intelligence ac-
tivity must be continuous in times of peace and 
times of war. The closest possible relationship 
exists between intelligence operations in peace-
time and their effectiveness in wartime. History 
has demonstrated time and again that adequate 
peacetime preparations have given a significant 
offensive advantage when military operations be-
gan. Associated with this lesson of history are 
two others: trained personnel are essential to in-
telligence organization; and adequate funds must 
be made available to maintain the personnel and 
the organization. The lavish outlay of funds for 
intelligence in times of crisis is not sufficient. 
Only longterm support, regardless of the apparent 
requirements of the moment, can assure continued 
success. 
A fourth lesson is the importance of unified di-
rection to coordinate and to concentrate the total 
intelligence effort of a nation. The failures of 
German Intelligence in World Wars I and II give 
particular emphasis to this point.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Fifth, the effectiveness of intelligence rests upon 
the speed of its dissemination and the adequacy of 
the communications systems upon which it must 
rely. 
Finally, intelligence must be used. Its func-
tions must be understood and its value appreciated 
by potential consumers. Time and again in mili-
tary and political history failures of intelligence 
have actually been failures to make use of it. 
The development of intelligence has been grad-
ual, almost imperceptible at times, and paced by 
the historical trends of nations and peoples. It 
would be difficult to determine with any finality 
the extent of its influence on historical events. 
There seems to be evidence, however, that intelli-
gence activity has had a marked effect upon the 
outcome of specific situations which have influ-
enced significant world events. In the broadest 
CONFIDENTIAL 
sense, therefore, the lessons to be learned from a 
study of the history of intelligence merit the most 
attentive consideration of those military and po-
litical leaders of any nation who bear in large 
measure responsibility for its security, its well-
being, and its destiny. 
Since this chapter has dealt with development, 
there has been an emphasis on intelligence in re-
lation to both military and political history. The 
illustrations of covert operations may have excited 
the particular interest of the reader, but the pur-
pose of this chapter has not been to give an exag-
gerated build-up for intelligence, nor to suggest 
that it is the answer to all military and political 
problems. In considering its importance the 
reader must see it in proper perspective. He must 
also recognize clearly that covert operations are 
but one aspect of its total activity.

CHAPTER 3 
UNITED STATES ORGANIZATIONS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY 
INTRODUCTION 
A study of its historical development has re-
vealed how and why, by the middle of the 20th 
century, intelligence has become exceedingly im-
portant to government and its supporting armed 
forces in their mutual objective of promoting and 
maintaining the security and welfare of any na-
tion in its relations with other nations. Foreign 
policies, to be sound and constructive, must be 
based on realism and fact. Military policies, as 
part of foreign policies, are subject to the same 
requirements. Since foreign and military policies 
are a product of the world environment interact-
ing with national aspirations and objectives, they 
are affected necessarily by the increasing complex-
ities of international relations. 
In recent years as a part of its foreign policy, 
the United States has assumed additional respon-
sibilities under various treaty and pact arrange-
ments with other nations on a world, regional, or 
bilateral basis. Thus special organizations have 
been required to carry out these new international 
tasks and new missions and responsibilities have 
been created for the armed forces. For these rea-
sons, the United States has found it imperative 
to reorganize and expand the agencies responsible 
for the formulation and direction of plans and 
policies relating to the national security. The 
organizations which produce the intelligence re-
quired by these agencies have likewise been sub-
jected to frequent change in order to carry out the 
tasks of new responsibilities. 
This chapter will review the organization of the 
various United States agencies which have respon-
sibilities in connection with foreign policy and 
will show how Intelligence is related to them. 
Two concepts must be kept in mind: first, that 
Intelligence is a service organization, not an end 
in itself; and second, that Intelligence is a unity 
and is not the exclusive province of any one agen-
cy. By tracing the interrelationships of these 
agencies and their Intelligence subdivisions, these 
63 
concepts should become clear and the intelligence 
officer should better understand his own position 
and functions. By reason of the frequency of 
joint operations, he must also be informed of the 
detailed organization of the army and air force. 
NATIONAL SECURITY ORGANIZATION 
The National Security Act of 1947, and the leg-
islation supplementing or amending it in 1949, 
produced fundamental and far-reaching changes 
in the organization and relationships of the armed 
forces of the United States. 
The pumpose of the Act was stated as being: 
To promote the national security by pro-
viding for a Secretary of Defense; for a -De-
partment of Defense, for a Department of the 
Army, a Department of the Navy, and a De-
partment of the Air Force; and for the co-
ordination of the activities of the Department 
of Defense with other departments and agen-
cies of the Government concerned with the 
national security. 
The policy expressed in the Act and its subse-
quent amendments was stated by the Congress as 
follows: 
In enacting this legislation, it is the intent 
of Congress to provide a comprehensive pro-
gram for the future security of the United 
States: 
to provide for the establishment on integrated 
policies and procedures for the departments, 
agencies, and functions of the government re-
lating to the national security; 
to provide three military departments, sep-
arately administered, for the operation and 
administration of the Army, the Navy (in-
cluding naval aviation and the United States 
Marine Corps), and the Air Force, with their 
assigned combat and service components; 
to provide for their authoritative coordina-
tion and unified direction under civilian con- .. 
trol of the Secretary of Defense, but not to 
merge them;

to provide for the effective strategic direc-
tion of the armed forces and for their opera-
tion under unified control and for their 
integration into an efficient team of land, naval 
and air forces; 
but not to establish a single Chief of Staff 
over the Armed Forces nor an Armed Forces 
general staff (but this is not to be interpreted 
as applying to the Joint Chiefs of Staff or 
Joint Staff) . 
Major Features of the National Security Legislation 
The major features of the Act were the establish-
ment of: (a) the National Security Council, the 
National Security Resources Board, and the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency; (b) a Department and 
a Secretary of Defense to provide unified control 
over the Armed Forces; (c) the Department of 
the Air Force as a separate command under the 
Department of Defense; ( d) the following agen-
cies under the Department of Defense (in addi-
tion to the three military departments) : the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff, the Munitions 
Board, the Research and Development Board, and 
the Armed Forces Policy Council. 
The 1949 Amendments to the Act increased the 
authority previously granted to the Secretary of 
Defense to exercise further centralized control of 
the military departments, and created the posi-
tions of Deputy and Assistant Secretaries of De-
fense, and the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs 
of Staff. 
The Air Force Organization Act of 1951 further 
clarified the organization and command structure 
of the Department of the Air Force, the Chief of 
Staff and the Air Staff, and the United States Air 
Force. 
By mid-1953, various Presidential Reorganiza-
tion plans had resulted in a number of changes in 
some of the agencies and offices created by the 
National Security Act of 1947. It also resulted in 
the redistribution of some functions originally as-
signed them. For example; Reorganization Plan 
No. 3 of 1953 abolished the National Security Re-
sources Board and transferred its responsibilities 
to the Office of Defense Mobilization. Within the 
Department of Defense there was a reorganization 
of some of its subordinate agencies and offices as the 
? result of Presidential Reorganization Plan No. 6 
of 1953.

Continuing efforts are made within the executive 
branch of the Government to increase efficiency of 
operations and to insure the greatest coordination 
of its widely varied activities, particularly as re-
lated to problems of national security. 
The National Security Council (NSC) 
The NSC is composed of officials specifically 
designated by statute. Among these are: the 
President of the United States; the Vice Presi-
dent; the Secretary of State; the Secretary of De-
fense; the Director of Defense Mobilization; and 
the Secretary of the Treasury. The President acts 
as chairman. 
In addition to the foregoing officials, the Presi-
dent is given authority to appoint (subject to the 
advice and consent of the Senate) as additional 
members of the Council other administrative gov-
ernment officials, including the Secretaries and 
Under Secretaries of other Executive Departments 
and of the Military Departments. 
The law provides that it shall have a staff headed 
by a civilian executive secretary. 
The function of the NSC is stated as follows: 
to advise the President with respect to the 
integration of domestic, foreign and military 
policies relating to the national security so as 
to enable the military services and the other 
departments and agencies of the Government 
to cooperate more effectively in matters in-
volving the national security. 
In addition to performing such other func-
tions as the President may direct, for the pur-
pose of more effectively coordinating the poli-
cies and functions of the departments and 
agencies of the Government relating to the 
national security, it shall, subject to the direc-
tion of the President, be the duty of the 
Council?
(1) to assess and appraise the objectives, 
commitments, and risks of the United States 
in relation to our actual and potential military 
power, in the interest of national security, 
for the purpose of making recommendations 
to the President in connection therewith; and 
(2) to consider policies on matters of com-
mon interest to the departments and agencies 
of the Government concerned with the na-
tional security, and to make recommendations 
to the President in connection therewith. 
The NSC is concerned with the ultimate correla-
tion of the Government's best military and diplo-

matic thought on problems relating to the position 
of the United States in the world society of na-
tions, and has the additional responsibility of 
making sure that our commitments do not exceed 
our abilities to carry theM out. The Secretary of 
State and his Department continue to exercise 
leadership in charting our foreign policy, but other 
branches of Government, including the military, 
have a chance to state their views before decisions 
are made. 
The NSC does not seek publicity but works 
quietly and secretly. When the President or one 
of the members of the NSC asks for advice on a 
particular situation, the Director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency has a summary of the situation 
prepared, which includes an appraisal of world 
reactions to it. A working group made up of 
representatives from each department recommends 
a course of action which may be acted upon with 
dispatch by the NSC itself. Disagreements not 
resolved are settled by Presidential decision. The 
long range purpose of the NSC is to provide a 
thoughtfully developed and clearly stated foreign 
policy in balance with military strength so as to 
give continuity to policies even as administrations 
change. The NS C also specifically guides the ac-
tivities of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
The National Security Act of 1947 created the 
"National Military Establishment" under the Sec-
retary of Defense; the 1949 amendments changed 
the organizational title to the "Department of De-
fense." The latter statute also made the Depart-
ment of Defense one of the "executive" depart-
ments of the Government equal to the other 
departments headed by cabinet officers; the De-
partments of the Army, the Navy, and the Air 
Force became "military" rather than "executive" 
departments, the Secretaries no longer being cabi-
net members. 
The current organization of the Department of 
Defense is indicated in figure 1. 
Office of the Secretary of Defense 
The Secretary of Defense is the principal as-
sistant to the President in all matters relating to 
the Department of Defense. He is normally a 
269196-54 6 
65 
civilian and cannot have been a regular commis-
sioned officer within 10 years of appointment to 
the Secretary's post. A special congressional act 
waived this restriction in the case of General of 
the Army George C. Marshall. 
Congress has restricted the Secretary's powers 
to change through administrative acts the func-
tions of any of the military services that have 
been fixed by legislation. Further, each of the 
three military departments is separately admin-
istered, and their respective Secretaries as well 
as members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have the 
right, after informing the Secretary of Defense, 
to express freely their recommendations on defense 
needs to the Congress. 
The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and the Joint Staff 
Although a body bearing the title Joint Chiefs 
of Staff has operated since 1942, the official per-
manent organization was not established until 
1917. At that time the position of Chief of Staff 
to the President was replaced by that of the Chair-
man, Joint Chiefs of Staff, the other members 
being the Chief of Staff of the United States 
Army, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Chief 
of Staff of the United States Air Force, and the 
Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. 
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, frequently termed 
the JCS, are the "principal military advisers" of 
the President, the NSC, and the Secretary of De-
fense. Their duties specifically include: 
(1) preparation of strategic plans and provision 
for the strategic direction of the military 
forces; 
preparation of joint plans and assignment 
to the military services of logistic respon-
sibilities in accordance with such plans; 
establishment of unified commands in stra-
tegic areas; 
review of major material and personnel re-
quirements of the military forces in accord-
ance with strategic and logistic plans; 
formulation of policies for joint training of 
the military forces; 
formulation of policies for coordinating the 
military education of members of the mili-
tary forces; and

Nations in accordance with the provisions 
of the Charter of the United Nations. 
The chairman, selected from among regular of-
ficers by the President, has no vote and exercises 
no command over the JCS or any service. He 
serves as presiding officer, provides the agenda for 
meetings, and informs the Secretary of Defense 
or President when the JCS has been unable to 
reach agreement on issues. He is appointed for 
a 2-year term renewable only once, unless a state 
of war would make change unwise. 
The Joint Chiefs have a Joint Staff not to ex-
ceed 210 officers drawn from the three services and 
headed by a Director appointed by the JCS. This 
relatively small, compact body in no way usurps 
the direct operational functioning of the individ-
ual armed services, but plans and coordinates. If 
the JCS must undertake operational functions, the 
service Chief most directly concerned acts as "Ex-
ecutive Agent" to control field and other agencies. 
The JCS exercise command authority as a body; 
they do not decide questions by majority rule. 
Most questions are satisfactorily resolved, but re-
maining differences of opinion are decided by 
higher authority. 
The Joint Staff is divided into three groups: the 
Joint Strategic Plans Group, the Joint Logistics 
Plans Group and the Joint Intelligence Group. 
Of necessity most studies involve intergroup col-
laboration. The Staff works full time for the JCS, 
and its members are not responsible to their own 
services. Since considerable amounts of JCS work 
involve detail that must be provided by the in-
dividual services, a number of Joint Committees 
have been established to work with the Joint Staff. 
The principal ones are the Joint Strategic Survey 
Committee, Joint Strategic Plans Committee, 
Joint Intelligence Committee, and Joint Logistics 
Plans Committee. 
The first of these committees is the senior policy 
planning and advisory group for the JCS, dealing 
with broad political-military problems from a mil-
itary viewpoint. The other three committees are 
part-time, staffed by officers with regular duties in 
their own departments closely related to their com-
mittee assignments. Plans prepared by any of 
the groups are reviewed by the appropriate com-
mittee before submission to the JCS and com-
mittee members are able to call upon their respec-
67 
tive services for advice. Thus the particular 
requirements and problems of the various services 
are coordinated in the planning of the Joint Staff. 
There are of course, still other specialized com-
mittees as depicted in figure 2. And ad hoc com-
mittees are also created to meet specific additional 
needs. 
The responsibilities of the JCS have been de-
lineated in the excerpt from the law given earlier 
in this section. The JCS contribute to the estab-
lishment of priorities to insure the meeting of 
military needs. Increasingly, too, they are work-
ing on budget allocations of the three services to 
be sure they match the strategic and logistics plans 
agreed upon. Specific questions come to them 
from the Services, cabinet secretaries, other Gov-
ernment departments, or from one of their own 
joint staff groups. 
The complexity of the problems of the JCS can 
be quite readily illustrated. For example, they 
have to consider the problem of stockpiling: How 
much will we require of certain specific materials? 
Other typical problems might be: How great is 
the threat of submarine warfare? How much oil 
and gas will be required in war and how long will 
the war last? Are reserves adequate? Is ration-
ing feasible? What is the availability of men and 
weapons? In planning the need for bases they 
must evaluate requirements in relation to avail-
ability, defense, and cost of acquisition. Of great 
importance are intelligence estimates regarding 
both enemies and allies, what they may or can do. 
Since planning can never be on the basis of un-
limited strength, the JCS must decide what risks 
can be accepted, what ones are unavoidable, and 
how these policies or positions interact upon each 
other. Future weapons planning is also an un-
certain and complex problem with tremendous 
consequences at stake. Many of these weighty 
problems hinge upon estimates of future interna-
tional developments, a matter of good intelligence 
assessment. All of the planning must be done 
within the limits of available money appropria-
tions. 
When the JCS finally prepare a strategic plan, 
it consists of four essentials: (1) a statement of 
national war objectives; (2) a statement of enemy 
capabilities; (3) a broad general concept of op-
erations; and (4) a statement of a number of time-

phased military tasks to be undertaken by the 
military forces, including the major tactical units 
to perform the tasks. The importance of the 
intelligence function in such planning is evident. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY. 
An understanding of the organization of the 
Navy Department is important to the intelligence 
officer for at least two reasons. In the first place, 
since Intelligence must supply many kinds of in-
formation required by the planners and command-
ers, its ability to supply meaningful information 
in no small measure depends upon its understand-
ing of the organization it serves. Secondly, In-
telligence is dependent upon its whole parent 
organization for most of the raw material which 
it is to process into finished intelligence. Like-
wise, since the same information may be of use to 
all three services, and any part of another service 
may be a source of intelligence useful to the Navy, 
an understanding of the other national security 
agencies is also important. 
The National Security Act of 1947 describes the 
functional organization of the Department of the 
Navy as follows: 
The term "Department of the Navy" as 
used in this Act shall be construed to mean 
the Department of the Navy at the seat of 
government; the headquarters, United States 
Marine Corps; the entire operating forces of 
the United States Navy, including naval avia-
tion, and of the United States Marine Corps, 
including the reserve components of such 
forces; all field activities, headquarters, forces, 
bases, installations, activities, and functions 
under the control or supervision of the De-
partment of the Navy; and the United States 
Coast Guard when operating as a part of the 
Navy pursuant to law. 
In general the United States Navy, within 
the Department of the Navy, shall include 
naval combat and service forces and such avia-
tion as may be organic therein. It shall be 
organized, trained, and equipped primarily 
for prompt and sustained combat incident to 
operations at sea. It shall be responsible for 
the preparation of naval forces necessary for 
the effective prosecution of war except as 
otherwise assigned, and, in accordance with 
integrated joint mobilization plans, for the 
expansion of the peacetime components of the 
Navy to meet the needs of war. 
All naval aviation shall be integrated with 
the naval service as part thereof within the 
Department of the Navy. Naval aviation 
shall consist of combat and service and train-
ing forces, and shall include land-based naval 
aviation, air transport essential for naval 
operations, all air weapons and air techniques 
involved ,in the operations and activities of 
the United States Navy, and the entire re-
mainder of the aeronautical organization of 
the United States Navy, together with the 
personnel necessary therefore. 
The Navy shall be generally responsible for 
naval reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare, 
and protection of shipping. 
The Navy shall develop aircraft, weapons, 
tactics, technique, organization and equipment 
of naval combat and service elements; matters 
of joint concern as to these functions shall be 
coordinated between the Army, the Air Force, 
and the Navy. 
It also describes the organization and functions of 
the Marine Corps: 
The United States Marine Corps, within the 
Department of the Navy, shall include land 
combat and service forces and such aviation as 
may be organic therein. The Marine Corps 
shall be organized, trained and equipped to 
provide fleet marine forces of combined arms, 
together with supporting air components, for 
service with the fleet in the seizure or defense 
of advanced naval bases and for the conduct 
of such land operations as may be essential to 
the prosecution of a naval campaign. It shall 
be the duty of the Marine Corps to develop, 
in coordination with the Army and the Air 
Force, those phases of amphibious operations 
which pertain to the tactics, technique, and 
equipment employed by landing forces. In 
addition, the Marine Corps shall provide de-
tachments and organizations for service on 
armed vessels of the Navy, shall provide 
security detachments for the protection of 
naval property at naval stations and bases, 
and shall perform such other duties as the 
President may direct: Provided, That such 
additional duties shall not detract from or 
interfere with the operations for which the 
Marine Corps is primarily organized. The 
Marine Corps shall be responsible, in accord-
ance with integrated joint mobilization plans, 
for the expansion of peacetime components of 
the Marine Corps to meet the needs of war.

tary. Before that time the Secretary of War was 
responsible for naval affairs. After 1815 the or-
ganization was modified to include a board of 
three naval officers to serve as professional assist-
ants to the Secretary. Then in 1842 this board of 
Navy commissioners was abolished, and the system 
of technical bureaus was established. By the time 
of World War I, the post of Chief of Naval Opera-
tions was established, and between the two world 
wars an Assistant Secretary for Air was also ap-
pointed. The immense new responsibilities de-
veloped during World War II were formalized in 
the legislation now governing Navy organization. 
Present-Day Navy Organization and Functions 
Although the National Security Act of 1947 set 
forth basic Navy responsibilities, later amplifica-
tions have been promulgated. The President and 
the JCS issued a paper on April 21, 1948, entitled 
"Functions of the Armed Forces and the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff." It specifies four purposes com-
mon to all three services for military operations: 
(1) to support and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, foreign or 
domestic; (2) to maintain, by timely and effective 
military action, the security of the United States, 
its possessions, and areas vital to its interest; (3) 
to uphold and advance the national policies and 
interests of the United States; and (4) to safe-
guard the internal security of the United States. 
Among the more specific functions this document 
describes is that of providing adequate, timely, 
and reliable intelligence for use within the Na-
tional military establishment. 
Using this 1948 document as an authority, the 
Department of the Navy, in General Order No. 5, 
established three principal organizational com-
ponents and enumerated four principal tasks. 
The principal components are: 
1. The Operating Forces: the several fleets, 
seagoing forces, sea frontier forces, district 
forces, and such of the shore establishments of 
the Navy and other forces and activities as may 
be assigned to the operating forces by the Presi-
dent or Secretary of the Navy. 
2. The Navy Department: the executive part 
of the naval establishment located at the seat 
of the government, which comprises the bureaus, 
boards and offices of the Navy Department; the 
Headquarters of the Marine Corps; and the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
70 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
Headquarters of the Coast Guard (when as-
signed to the Navy). 
3. The Shore Establishment: all other activi-
ties of the naval establishment including all 
shore activities not assigned to the operating 
forces. 
It is fundamental naval policy to "maintain the 
Navy as a thoroughly integrated entity in suffi-
cient strength on the sea and in the air to uphold, 
in conjunction with our other Armed Forces, our 
national policies and interests, to support our com-
merce and our international obligations, and to 
guard the United States including its overseas 
possessions and dependencies." The implementa-
tion of this policy imposes upon the administra-
tion of the naval establishment four principal 
tasks: 
1. First, to interpret, apply and uphold the 
national policies and interests in the develop-
ment and use of the naval establishment. This 
task may be described as the "policy control" of 
the naval establishment. 
2. Second, to command the operating forces, 
and to maintain them in a state of readiness to 
conduct war; and to promulgate to the naval 
establishment directives embracing matters of 
operations, security, intelligence, discipline, 
naval communications, and similar matters of 
naval administration. This task may be de-
scribed as the "naval command" of the naval 
establishment. 
3. Third, to coordinate and direct the effort 
of the Navy Department and the shore establish-
ment in order to assure the development, pro-
curement, production and distribution of mate-
rial, facilities and personnel to the operating 
forces. This task may be described as the "logis-
tics administration and control" of the naval 
establishment. 
4. Fourth, to develop and maintain efficiency 
and economy in the operation of the naval estab-
lishment with particular regard to matters of 
organization, staffing, administrative proce-
dures, the utilization of personnel, materials and 
facilities, and the budgeting and expenditure 
of funds. This task may be described as the 
"business administration" of the naval establish-
ment. 
The first and third tasks require additional com-
ment. Policy control includes guidance of the 
Navy as a whole, appraisal of its overall perform-
ance, and public relations in the broadest sense. 
Logistics is further described in General Order 
No. 5 as having two phases: consumer logistics,

UNITED STATES ORGANIZATIONS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY CONFIDENTIAL 
and producer logistics. The former involves the 
planning and forecasting of requirements on the 
basis of operational plans, a responsibility of the 
Chief of Naval Operations. The latter involves 
the developing and procuring of these require-
ments. Consumer logistics is intimately asso-
ciated with naval command while producer 
logistics is a matter of business adminstration, 
although, of course, the two are intimately related. 
Distribution of Executive Responsibilities 
Figure 3 outlines the principal subdivisions of 
the Department of the Navy. It will be noted 
that the secretary has 4 civilian executive assist-
ants and a larger number of naval professional 
assistants, including the naval command assistant 
(Chief of Naval Operations) and up to 12 naval 
technical assistants (counting the Chief of Naval 
Reserve, Chief of Naval Material, and, when so as-
signed, the commandant of the Coast Guard). 
The Secretary directs and controls the entire 
naval establishment and retains immediate respon-
sibility for policy control, public relations, morale, 
and budget. The civilian executive assistants 
handle business administration and producer 
logistics, exercising top management coordination 
of the work of the many bureaus and offices in 
the Navy Department. Bureau heads, however, 
have direct liaison with the Secretary, although 
routinely most of their business is transacted 
either through the Chief of Naval Operations or 
one of the civilian executive assistants. The bal-
ancing of military with civilian authority and 
responsibility within the Navy is shown by the 
division between the naval command assistant with 
his subordinates and the civilian executive assist-
ants with their staffs. 
Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) 
The Chief of Naval Operations is the highest 
ranking officer in the Department of the Navy. 
As such he is a member of the JCS and is the prin-
cipal naval adviser to the President, Secretary of 
Defense, and Secretary of the Navy. He is in 
command of the operating forces and includes 
among his responsibilities their training, readi-
ness, and war planning. He is required to deter-
mine the personnel and material requirements of 
the operating forces and to this end coordinates 
71 
and directs the efforts of the various bureaus and 
offices of the Navy Department. 
His Vice Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO) 
supervises the General Planning Group and the 
work of the five Deputy Chiefs of Naval Opera-
tions (DCNO) : Personnel, Administration, Op-
erations, Logistics, and Air. There is also an 
Assistant Chief of Naval Operations (Naval Re-
serve) advanced from his former position under 
the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Person-
nel). The General Planning Group prepares 
broad strategic plans and aids in developing logis-
tics requirements in support of such plans. These 
naval plans are based on overall plans received 
from the JCS. Another more recent change is the 
Progress Analysis Group to report on Navywide 
progress and readiness for war. Both the Com-
mandant of the Marine Corps and the Comman-
dant of the Coast Guard (in wartime) deal di-
rectly with the Chief of Naval Operations on 
matters of common interest. 
The office of the Chief of Naval Operations is or-
ganized along the same lines as the general staff 
of the Army, although different titles are used 
and there are some variations. For example, per-
sonnel and administration are separate sections. 
The latter directs United States naval missions, 
Navy participation in pan-American affairs, naval 
records and history, the Naval Observatory, the 
Naval Hydrographic Office, and the Naval Com-
munications Service. Air also has its separate 
organization to develop aircraft and guided mis-
siles, to organize aviation logistics, and to develop 
air warfare operating plans. The DCNO (Opera-
tions) Division includes intelligence and plans, so 
that the Director of Naval Intelligence is subordi-
nate to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. 
This same subordination exists in the Air Force. 
Training responsibilities are allocated as fol-
lows: individual training to the Chief of Naval 
Personnel, group training to the Deputy Chief of 
Naval Operations (operations) , and aviation to the 
Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air). By 
general policy either the Chief or the Vice Chief of 
Naval Operations must be a naval aviator to insure 
full representation of aviation needs. The Vice 
and Deputy Chiefs derive their authority solely 
from the Chief of Naval Operations, in the same 
manner as with staffs afloat. Although not in-

UNITED STATES ORGANIZATIONS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY 
flexible or fixed by formal regulations, the most 
frequent relationships between CNO and the Bu-
reaus are found as follows: DCNO (Logistics) 
with Yards and Docks, Ordnance, Supplies and 
Accounts, Ships, Medicine and Surgery; DCNO 
(Personnel) with Personnel; and DCNO (Air) 
with Aeronautics. 
The Naval Inspector General reports both to 
the Chief of Naval Operations and to the Secre-
tary of the Navy. He investigates and reports on 
all matters affecting the discipline and military 
efficiency of the Navy, making such recommenda-
tions as are required. In his work he has great 
latitude, and every part of the service is open to 
his scrutiny. His investigations are not to be 
confused with those made by the Office of Naval 
Intelligence which relate to security and are made 
only on request of competent authority. 
The Operating Forces 
Since World War II, all United States forces 
outside the continental limits have been organized 
under unified area commands. Each is under a 
commander-in-chief who has control over all 
United States forces?Army, Navy, and Air Force 
in his area?as assigned by the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff. Under the Executive Agent concept men-
tioned earlier, the Chief of Naval Operations holds 
that JCS position for the Pacific, Atlantic, and 
Eastern Atlantic-Mediterranean commands. The 
Chief of Staff, United States Army, is the Execu-
tive Agent for the Far East (FEC) , Caribbean, 
and European (EuCom) commands as well as 
United States Forces in Austria. The Chief of 
Staff, United States Air Force, is the Executive 
Agent for the Alaskan and Northeast commands, 
the United States Air Force Europe, and the Stra-
tegic Air Command (SAC). 
The Chief of Naval Operations has under his 
direct control the Pacific Fleet, Atlantic Fleet, 
and Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediter-
ranean. Each fleet has type components: Am-
phibious, Fleet Marine, Air, Battleships and 
Cruisers, Destroyers and Destroyer Escorts, Mine, 
Submarine, Service Force, and Training Com-
mands. 
Under Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet (Cin-
CPac) is the First Fleet, operating in the Eastern 
Pacific, and the Seventh Fleet, in the Western 
73 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Pacific. However, during the Korean fighting 
operational control of the latter fleet has been held 
by the Commander-in-Chief, Far East (Army) 
exercised through Commander Naval Forces, Far 
East (ComNavFE). The Commander-in-Chief, 
Atlantic Fleet ( CinCLant) , has the Second Fleet, 
and the Operational Development Force for evalu-
ation tests. Commander-in-Chief Eastern At-
lantic and Mediterranean (CinCNELM) has the 
Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, receiving logis-
tic support from CinCLantFlt. Each of these 
fleets is composed of appropriate ships tempo-
rarily assigned from type commands, and each is 
a purely operational command, the administration 
remaining under the type commander. 
Naval Forces, Germany (NavForGer) is under 
Commander-in-Chief, Europe (Army) . The Mili-
tary Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) is under 
the Chief of Naval Operations. In addition there 
are Pacific and Atlantic Reserve Fleets made up 
of the "moth-ball" ships. The Commanders of 
the Western and Eastern Sea Frontiers respec-
tively command these fleets as additional duty. 
Sea Frontiers 
Sea Frontier forces are part of the Operating 
Forces of the Navy. Geographically there are five 
such forces. The Eastern Sea Frontier (East-
SeaFron) includes waters off the Atlantic and 
Gulf Coasts and the 1st, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 
and 9th Naval Districts, plus Naval Commands 
of the Potomac and Severn Rivers. This sea 
frontier command is under CinCLant. The 
Caribbean Sea Frontier, under the Commander-
in-Chief, Caribbean (Army), includes the 10th 
and 15th Naval Districts, plus adjacent waters in 
the Caribbean and nearby Pacific. The Western 
Sea Frontier (WesSeaFron) under CinCPac in-
cludes the 11th, 12th, and 13th Naval Districts, as 
well as eastern Pacific waters. The Hawaiian Sea 
Frontier also under CinCPac includes the 14th 
Naval District and central Pacific waters. The 
Alaskan Sea Frontier is under Commander-in-
Chief Alaska (Air Force) and includes the 17th 
Naval District and north Pacific waters. 
These command relationships are in the field of 
military operations. Sea Frontier commanders 
are responsible for maintaining adequate plans for 
the defense of their respective areas, both of a

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
naval and a joint nature. They also must be 
ready to expedite and protect merchant shipping 
in their areas. Naval participation in search and 
rescue operations is under their control. 
In addition to operational duties, Sea Frontier 
commanders are administratively in the chain of 
command between the Chief of Naval Operations 
and the District Commandants. This is military 
command and coordination control in the interests 
of uniformity of action and avoidance of duplica-
tion among the districts. District Commandants 
still can deal directly with the Navy Department 
on matters not involving coordination or the mili-
tary readiness of their forces. 
The Shore Establishment 
The shore establishment includes the field ac-
tivities of the bureaus and offices of the Navy De-
partment and all shore activities not assigned to 
the operating forces. These activities are largely 
involved in producer logistics for the support of 
the operating forces. Although located princi-
pally in coastal areas, they may be scattered any-
where throughout the United States and its terri-
tories. 
It is appropriate at this point to provide an ex-
planation of the formal command relationships 
which apply specifically to the Shore Establish-
ment, based on General Order No. 19 which gives 
the official definitions. 
Command is the authoritative direction exer-
cised over a unit or individual of the Naval Estab-
lishment in all matters pertaining to the conduct 
of naval affairs not specifically expected by higher 
authority and is commensurate with the responsi-
bility imposed. Inherent in command are prec-
edence over all personnel serving with the com-
mand, the responsibility for coordinating the ef-
forts of the units or individuals commanded, the 
power to enforce the official will of the commander 
through the exercise of the necessary military di-
rections, the authority to make inspections to in-
sure compliance with such directions, and the 
initiation or application of authorized discipli-
nary measures incident thereto. A commander, 
within his discretion, may delegate the execution 
of the details to be performed by his authority to 
appropriate subordinates, but such delegation does 
not relieve him of the overall responsibility for 
CONFIDENTIAL 
74 
the performance of the personnel or units under 
his command. 
In General Order No. 19 "command" is subdi-
vided into four components which are defined as 
follows: 
Military Command is the authoritative di-
rection exercised over activities of the Naval 
Establishment in military matters together 
with the power to exercise authoritative direc-
tion in all matters when circumstances 
dictate. 
Military command stems from the Chief of Naval 
Operations, and is exercised over activities of the 
shore establishment through the Sea Frontier Com-
manders and the District Commandants, the 
Chief of Naval Air Training, and the Comman-
dant of the Marine Corps. It includes matters 
characteristic of a military organization, as con-
trasted to matters of the type provided for under 
Management Control in industry or business. 
Coordination Control is that necessary di-
rection of separate units of the naval estab-
lishment to insure adequately integrated 
relationships between all of these units. 
Coordination Control is a responsibility of the 
Chief of Naval Operations, exercised through the 
Sea Frontier Commanders and the District Com-
mandants, over shore activities located within the 
several districts. It fulfills the twofold purpose 
of providing for orderly and complete service in 
support of the operating forces and coordination 
between shore activities under different commands. 
Management Control is the direction exer-
cised, in other than military matters, by an 
authority of the Naval Establishment over a 
unit of the naval shore establishment in the 
administration of its local operating func-
tions. 
Management Control is exercised by the desig-
nated bureau or office of the Navy Department 
over a field activity in the non-military adminis-
tration of its functions. Bureau management re-
flects the policies and procedures of the Civilian 
Executive Assistants in the fields of Business Ad-
ministration and Producer Logistics, and includes 
overall responsibility for the work performed. 
It is to be noted that in the operating forces Man-
agement Control is included in "Command" and 
is always the responsibility of the Chief of Naval

UNITED STATES ORGANIZATIONS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY 
Operations. Command in the operating forces is 
not divided into the four components specified in 
General Order No. 19; however, commands of the 
operating forces which control activities of the 
Shore Establishment exercise that control in ac-
cordance with these four components. 
Technical Control is the specialized or pro-
fessional guidance or direction exercised by 
an authority of the naval establishment in 
technical matters. 
Technical Control is exercised by the bureaus and 
offices of the Navy Department according to their 
specialized technical responsibilities. This con-
trol extends throughout the naval establishment. 
The shore establishment consists of district ac-
tivities, fleet activities based ashore, Marine Corps 
supporting activities, and the Naval Air Training 
Command. Their relationships with the districts, 
sea frontiers, fleet commands, and bureaus, are 
governed by the regulations indicated above. 
A District Commandant is an officer of the line 
qualified for command at sea. In his naval dis-
trict he acts as the representative of the Secretary 
of the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations, Sea 
Frontier Commander, and the various bureaus of 
the Navy Department. His responsibilities in-
clude support of the operating forces, defense of 
the district, control of public relations, mainte-
nance of industrial mobilization plans, control of 
naval reserve matters, and maintenance of an ef-
ficient intelligence service both for security and 
operational purposes. Additional duties include 
operation of naval communications, collaboration 
with other Government authorities, supervision of 
legal matters, public works, and transportation. 
Each major harbor or operating area within a 
district has a Naval Base Commander, with pri-
mary responsibility to support the operating 
forces. A Naval Shipyard is but one component 
of a Naval Base. There are also Naval Air Base 
Commands with appropriate subordinate oom-
mands, including all aviation activities within a 
district with the exception of training commands, 
Marine Air commands, and weather centrals. 
The United States Marine Corps 
The Marine Corps, whose mission has been stated 
earlier, is divided like the Navy into three com-
ponents: the headquarters, the operating forces, 
CONFIDENTIAL 
and the supporting establishment. Headquarters 
include the Offices of the Commandant, the Supply 
Department, and the Personnel Department. In 
the Offices of the Commandant, the Division of 
Plans and Policies formulates intelligence plans. 
The major commands of the operating forces 
are Fleet Marine Forces, Atlantic, and Fleet Ma-
rine Forces, Pacific, each under a Commanding 
General, located respectively at Norfolk, Va., and 
at Honolulu. These forces contain balanced land, 
air, and service elements. The Marine Corps Se-
curity Forces guard naval shore activities, with 
a Marine Barracks established at each. Ship de-
tachments, actually a part of the security force, 
serve as gun crews and small-sized landing parties. 
The supporting establishment includes the quar-
termaster depots and other facilities required to 
service the Operating Forces. 
OTHER DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS 
The Department of the Army and Department 
of the Air Force resemble the Department of the 
Navy in structure, but different histories and mis-
sions have brought about somewhat different solu-
tions to their organizational problems. 
The Department of the Army 
This title refers both to the whole Army estab-
lishment and to the executive offices in Washington. 
The Department of War, created in 1789, became 
the Department of the Army in 1947 at which time 
the Department of the Air Force was established. 
The Secretary of the Army has responsibilities 
and an organization similar to those of the Secre-
tary of the Navy. His department includes a 
Chief of Staff, a General Staff, a Special Staff,

The mission of the Army places its primary

UNITED STATES ORGANIZATIONS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY CONFIDENTIAL 
serve in the manner of the chiefs of technical bu-
reaus in the Navy in determination of require-
ments, procurement, and storage of supplies, under 
the direction of the Assistant Chief of Staff 0-1 
Logistics, but they also command their technical 
branches and certain installations. For example, 
the Chief of Transportation commands Ports of 
Embarkation, Railway Repair Depots, and other 
Transportation Corps facilities. 
The Army organization provides for each mili-
tary commander a staff to aid him in his work. 
Divisions and larger units have a Chief of Staff 
to direct and coordinate a General Staff which in 
its four divisions, G-1 Personnel, G-2 Intelligence, 
G-3 Operations, and 0-4 Logistics, includes all 
functions of command. Under the coordinating 
General Staff is such Special Staff organization as 
may be required, including all other staff officers in 
a headquarters not specifically part of the General 
Staff. In brigades or smaller units the director 
and coordinator for the commander is called the. 
Executive, and there is no special staff, but there 
is an equivalent of the General Staff, known as S-1 
Adjutant, S-2 Intelligence, S-3 Operations and 
Training, S-4 Supply, and such other staff officers 
as may be required. 
Since the same pattern of organization appears 
at every level of the Army, there is no loss of 
efficiency when officers are transferred from one 
unit to another or between levels, for their respon-
sibilities are clearly defined and understood. The 
American General Staff system has one interesting 
variation from that of other countries, such as 
Germany. The United States Army rotates offi-
cers between staff and command assignments; the 
Germans built a preferential elite corps ear-
marked almost solely for staff assignment. 
The Office, Chief of Army Field Forces, is the 
field operating agency of the Department of the 
Army for the continental United States and is 
located at Fort Monroe, Va. The Army Field 
Forces are responsible for training, development 
of doctrine, and equipment. Its responsibility 
for overseas forces is limited to setting training 
standards and doctrine, and determining opera-
tional readiness. Orders to overseas commands 
are issued through the Department of the Army. 
The United States is divided geographically 
into six Army Areas and a Military District of 
Washington. The Commanding General of each 
area, or district, commands all units and activities 
within his area except those specifically com-
manded by one of the Technical Services or other 
agencies of the Department of the Army. 
Army Territorial and Troop Organization 
The Army refers to any land, sea, and air masses 
involved in the conduct of war as theaters of war. 
A theater of operations refers to an area where 
actual tactical operations are or can be conducted," 
and it may be subdivided into a combat zone and 
a communications zone. The combat zone may 
include division areas at the front, behind them 
corps service areas, and behind those in turn army 
service areas. The communications zone relieves 
combat commanders of responsibility for logistics 
and security operations not concerned with their 
primary combat missions. It is divided into an 
advance section, an intermediate section, and a 
base section. 
That part of the theater of war not included in 
the theater of operations is called the zone of the 
interior?a term usually applied to the United 
States, but on occasion also to foreign territory 
whether allied, neutral, or hostile. 
Army troop organizations range from the army 
group down to the rifle squad. An army group 
is primarily a tactical command made up of sev-
eral field armies. A field army includes a head-
quarters, certain organic troops, and a variable 
number of corps and divisions. The army is both 
administrative and tactical. A corps also includes 
a headquarters and certain organic troops plus a 
variable number of divisions. It is primarily a 
tactical unit but can be administrative. A divi-
sion is the basic unit of combined arms, includ-
ing headquarters, infantry, armored or airborne 
units, artillery, and other units as required. It 
is both administrative and tactical. 
There are smaller units such as the brigade, a 
tactical unit of two or more regiments, headquar-
ters and other small units; a group, a flexible 
organization with various attached units to ac-
complish a particular mission; a regiment, with 
headquarters, service company, and two or more 
battalions, or other smaller units; a battalion, the 
basic tactical unit; a company or battery, the basic 
administrative unit; a rifle platoon; a weapons

section; and a squad. An army rifle squad has 9 
men; in contrast, the Marines divide their 13-man 
squads into three 4-man fire teams. The rifle pla-
toon is the smallest infantry unit commanded by 
a commissioned officer. Such personnel and equip-
ment as are not required consistently by a particu-
lar unit are pooled and assigned to a higher unit. 
When particular tactical groupings are re-
quired, special task forces are created, preserv-
ing as much as possible the integrity of compo-
nent units. Armored divisions sometimes have 
combat commands with their own headquarters 
companies to direct temporary tactical groupings. 
The infantry division frequently uses a combat 
team consisting of an infantry regiment, support-
ing artillery, and engineers, or possibly also a 
signal detachment, medical battalion, and so forth. 
This is called a regimental combat team (RCT) . 
The Army classifies as "arms": the Infantry, 
Armored Cavalry, Field Artillery, Coast Artil-
lery, Corps of Engineers, and Signal Corps. It 
classes as "administrative services": the Adjutant 
General's Department, the Chaplains, the Corps 
of Military Police, the Inspector General's De-
partment, the Judge Advocate General's Depart-
ment, and the Finance Department. It classes as 
"technical services": the Chemical Corps, the 
Corps of Engineers, the Quartermaster Corps, 
the Transportation Corps, the Ordnance Depart-
ment, the Signal Corps, and the Medical Depart-
ment. 
Department of the Air Force 
From a modest beginning in 1907 as the aero-
nautical division in the Office of the Chief Signal 
Officer, the United States air arm has developed 
tremendously under the impetus of two world 
wars. In World War I the Army Air Corps was 
used in combat operations, and during World 
War II the Army Air Forces expanded to nearly 
21/2 million men operating 80,000 aircraft. After 
the war there was a reduction in size, but by 1950 
the objective was a total of 143 wings as a result 
of the Korean War and the world situation. 
The National Security Act of 1947 and its sub-
sequent amendments created an Air Force Estab-
lishment, a Department of the Air Force, and the 
United States Air Force. The civilian Secretary 
and his assistants have functions comparable to 
CONFIDENTIAL 
78 
their counterparts in the Department of the Navy 
and Army. The Chief of Staff, United States Air 
Force, is the principal military adviser to the Sec-
retary and exercises command over the Air Force. 
His Air Staff includes a Vice Chief and Deputy 
Chiefs as shown in figure 5. The five deputies 
are for Comptrolling, Personnel, Development, 
Operations, and Materiel. As was pointed out 
earlier, Intelligence is under Operations, together 
with Plans, Communications, Manpower, and 
Organization. 
The Air Force is charged with the responsi-
bility of being "organized, trained, and equipped 
primarily for prompt and sustained offensive and 
defensive air operations." Its missions as for-
mally defined include (1) defense of the United 
States against air attack; (2) the defeat of enemy 
air forces and the control of vital air areas; (3) the 
interdiction of enemy land power and communi-
cations; (4) the furnishing of combat and logisti-
cal air support to the Army, including air lift and 
resupply of airborne operations, close combat air 
support, aerial photography, tactical reconnais-
sance, etc.; (5) the carrying out of a campaign 
of progressive planned destruction of the enemy's 
war-making capacity; and (6) the providing of 
air transport for the Armed Forces. There are 
also the collateral duties of interdiction of enemy 
sea power, antisubmarine warfare, protection of 
shipping, and aerial minelaying. The latter are 
closely coordinated with naval efforts. 
Major Air Commands 
There are 13 major commands in the United 
States and 5 overseas, all under the Chief of Staff, 
United States Air Force. Those in the United 
States are grouped functionally as follows: (a) 
operational: Strategic Air Command, Tactical 
Air Command, Air Defense Command; (b) sup-
portive operational: Military Air Transport Serv-
ice, USAF Security Service, Headquarters Com-
mand; (c) training: Air University, Air Training 
Command, Continental Air Command; (d) de-
velopmental and logistic: Research and Develop-
ment Command, Air Materiel Command, Air 
Proving Ground Command, Special Weapons 
Command. 
The Strategic Air Command (SAC) includes 
heavy and medium bombers, long and medium

range reconnaissance aircraft, transports, and jet 
fighters. Organizationally it includes the 2d, 8th, 
and 15th Air Forces, each with several air divi-
sions; overseas it maintains the 5th and 7th Air 
Divisions. Its missions may carry it to any part 
of the globe. 
The Tactical Air Command includes fighter-
bombers, light bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, 
and troop carriers. Organizationally it includes 
the 9th and 18th Air Forces. It works closely 
with the Army Field Forces in developing tactical 
air support doctrines. 
The Air Defense Command (ADC) controls 
fighter-interceptor units, air bases, and radar sta-
tions along the possible air attack routes in this 
country. It consists of three regional forces, the 
Eastern, Central, and Western, each made up of 
several air divisions, supplemented by Air Na-
tional Guard wings. Their operations are closely 
integrated with the Navy Sea Frontier system and 
the respective Army Anti-Aircraft Artillery com-
mands. Elements of ADC may be assigned to 
commands outside the United States by the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. 
The Military Air Transport Service (MATS) 
combines the former Air Transport Command and 
Naval Air Transport Service. Its routes extend 
around the world, and it can provide military air 
lift as required. It provides supplementary serv-
ices such as airways communications, weather 
reporting, air and sea rescue. It includes person-
nel of the Navy as well as of the Air -.Force. A 
special operation of MATS is the Air Resupply 
and Communication Service (ARCS) which trains 
Air Force units in the preparations and dropping 
of psychological warfare pamphlets. 
The USAF Security Service produces and dis-
seminates communications intelligence and main-
tains communications security within the Air 
Force. The Headquarters Command is primarily 
an administrative adjunct of the Headquarters, 
United States Air Force, and operates the base for 
the heavy traffic in and out of Washington. The 
Air University includes a variety of schools and 
institutes ranging from the Air War College to 
the Extension Course Institute. The Air Train-
ing Command is responsible for all training below 
the Air University level from recruit to flying offi-
cer, and for this purpose uses the Flying Training 
CONFIDENTIAL 
80 
Air Force and the Technical Training Air Force. 
The Continental Air Command constructs and 
maintains air bases and other facilities within the 
United States, using as subcommands the 1st, 4th, 
10th, and 14th Air Forces. 
The six research centers of the Research and 
Development Command work on aircraft, mis-
siles, and armament. The Air Materiel Command 
buys, supplies, and maintains Air Force equip-
ment throughout the world. The Air Proving 
Ground Command develops operational tech-
niques and makes recommendations on require-
ments for equipment. The Special Weapons Com-
mand is part of the joint Army-Navy-Air Force 
atomic weapons organization. 
Overseas there are five air commands. The gen-
erals of the Alaskan and Northeast Commands are 
also theater commanders over all three services in 
their areas. The Caribbean Air Command and 
Far Eastern Air Force (FEAF) are under Army 
theater commanders and the United States Air 
Force in Europe (USAFE) operates under the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
Although the preceding discussion of organi-
zations for United States security is relatively 
brief, it provides a necessary background in 
nomenclature and functions. The balance of this 
chapter will deal with supporting intelligence 
subdivisions, emphasizing those within the De-
partment of Defense, but including others which 
are of interest. 
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE 
Naval Intelligence includes all the organizations 
that carry out the intelligence and counterintelli-
gence missions of the naval establishment. The 
responsibilities of the Director of Naval Intelli-
gence are: (1) to provide the naval elements re-
quired in the production of national intelligence; 
(2) to produce for naval commanders adequate 
and timely intelligence needed both for planning 
and conducting operations, and for estimating the 
capabilities, vulnerabilities, and proper courses of 
action of foreign nations; (3) to warn naval com-
manders of threats to the security of their 
commands. 
The components of Naval Intelligence are: (a) 
the Office of Naval Intelligence; (b) Intelligence 
foreign posts (Attaches, Observers, and Liaison

Officers) ; (c) Naval District and River Command 
Intelligence organizations; (d) Intelligence sec-
tions and units of the operating forces including 
outlying bases; and (e) joint and combined In-
telligence and liaison activities. Each of these 
components will be discussed in turn. 
It will clarify our point of view to think of all 
naval intelligence officers as serving on the intelli-
gence section of some commander's staff, the size 
and organization of the section depending on the 
needs of the command. On lower echelons, the 
intelligence section may consist of a single officer 
who also performs other duties, such as that of 
assistant operations officer; and the commander?
for example, the captain of a ship or an air squad-
ron?may not be normally thought of as having 
an organized staff at all. On higher echelons, in-
telligence duties may require the full time services 
of many officers. The higher the echelon of com-
mand, the more extensive the staff organization, 
and the larger and more complex the intelligence 
section. 
The highest echelon of the United States Naval 
Command is that of the Chief of Naval Operations 
(CNO) . CNO's Intelligence Officer is the Direc-
tor of Naval Intelligence (DNI) , and his intelli-
gence section is the Office of Naval Intelligence 
(ONI) . 
Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) 
Under the Director and Assistant Director of 
Naval Intelligence, ONI (0P-32) is divided into 
three branches which carry out the various objec-
tives necessary for the accomplishment of the gen-
eral mission of Naval Intelligence. Each branch 
of ONI is subdivided into sections, which are fur-
ther divided into units and desks. Figure 6 indi-
cates the current ONI organization. 
As the counterintelligence arm of the Navy, the 
Security Branch (OP 321) is charged with the 
safeguarding and security of naval information, 
personnel, equipment, and naval installations. Its 
five sections are: Investigations; Sabotage, Es-
pionage and Counter-Subversion (SEC) ; Secu-
rity Control; Commerce and Travel; and 
Censorship. 
Of particular interest are the Investigations 
Section and the SEC Section. The Investigations 
Section conducts investigations as required to pro-
81 
tect the Naval Establishment against espionage, 
sabotage, subversion and unauthorized disclosure 
of classified information. It also conducts other 
types of investigations upon request by competent 
authority?for example, investigations of appli-
cants for naval employment. The SEC Section 
functions as a research and evaluation unit, co-
ordinating and disseminating intelligence relating 
to sabotage, espionage, and counter-subversion. 
These two sections work as a team. The SEC Sec-
tion keeps track of the danger spots; its work is 
primarily a desk job. The Investigations Section 
acts as the hands and feet of the SEC Section. 
The Intelligence Branch (OP 322) is responsible 
for strategic and operational intelligence, specifi-
cally including air intelligence, and for the coordi-
nation of naval intelligence activities on foreign 
posts. It is required to collect and process infor-
mation, and to disseminate intelligence produced 
or received; to maintain liaison with other Federal 
intelligence agencies; and to direct and coordinate 
the preparation of intelligence directives, plans, 
and manuals. 
Its five sections are Estimates, Collection and 
Dissemination, Foreign, Operational, and Air. 
The Collection and Dissemination Section main-
tains official intelligence liaison with the Army, 
Air Force, State Department, and the Central In-
telligence Agency. This Section also discharges 
the responsibility of the Intelligence Branch for 
the collection of information by Naval Intelli-
gence foreign posts. One of its subsections main-
tains the CNO Chart Room; another provides 
maps, charts, photographs, and related material 
for intelligence purposes. The Foreign Section 
is responsible for supplying intelligence on foreign 
powers to the policy, planning, operational, and 
logistics agencies of the Navy. The Operational 
Section insures that timely intelligence, both basic 
and current, is disseminated within ONI and to 
the operating forces. The Air Section provides 
intelligence on foreign air power and coordinates 
the naval aspects of the joint air production intel-
ligence activities of ONI and the Air Force. 
The Administrative Branch (OP 323) super-
vises all management activities within and for 
ONI. Its five sections are: Field Activities, Gen-
eral Services, Personnel, Fiscal, and Training. 
General services include such matters as: publica-

tions, editorial review, reproduction, mail, files, 
and translation. The Personnel Section is re-
sponsible for the Naval Intelligence Reserve 
Program. 
Included within ONI are also offices responsible 
for Plans and Policies, Foreign Liaison, and Sec-
retariat. The Plans and Policies office prepares 
and coordinates Naval Intelligence plans. The 
Foreign Liaison office maintains official liaison be-
tween? ONI and foreign attaches, missions, and 
distinguished visitors. It also advises United 
States Naval officers in matters of protocol. The 
Secretariat reviews correspondence, reports and 
messages and otherwise relieves DNI of admin-
istrative details. 
Intelligence Foreign Posts (Attaches, Observers and 
Liaison Officers) 
Naval Attaches and their staffs who reside 
abroad are officially a part of ONI and thus under 
the cognizance of DNI. At the same time, at-
taches and assistant attaches have diplomatic 
status and report for duty to the ambassador or 
minister who is the chief of the diplomatic mis-
sion to which they are assigned. 
Naval Attaches are in command of naval attache 
offices whose size is determined by ONI in accord-
ance with the importance of the area controlled 
by the governments to which the attaches are 
accredited. The primary function of Naval In-
telligence officers stationed abroad is to collect 
information in accordance with the official delimi-
tation of topical material between the Navy, Army, 
Air Force, and State Department, and to forward 
it, after preliminary evaluation, to the Collection 
and Dissemination Section of ONI. Foreign 
Posts are supported by the Intelligence Branch. 
Naval District and River Command Intelligence 
Organizations 
General Order No. 19 states in part: ". . . The 
Commandant shall maintain within the district 
an efficient intelligence service, including such in-
telligence matters as affect the security of naval 
activities within the district, and such operational 
intelligence matters as are required by the com-
mander of the sea frontier in which the district is 
located . . ." 
Accordingly, in each District and River com-
mand, a District Intelligence Officer (DIO) serves 
on the staff of the Commandant, just as DNI serves 
on the staff of CNO. In certain designated dis-
tricts, the DIO has additional duty on the staff 
of the Sea Frontier Commander. The District 
Intelligence Office under the DIO is thus the 
Intelligence Section of the commandant's staff. 
While each District Intelligence Office is under 
the military command of the Commandant, its 
activities are coordinated by ONI which provides 
administrative support. Each District Intelli-
gence Office is organized in a manner similar to 
ONI although its primary mission is in the field 
of counterintelligence. Just as the Intelligence 
Branch of ONI supports naval attaches and other 
naval intelligence officers on foreign duty, the 
Security Branch supports the DIOs and their or-
ganizations. The relationships and responsibili-
ties of the DIO to DNI and to the Commandant 
are comparable to those of the naval attache to 
DNI and to the Chief of Mission. 
The District Intelligence organization consists 
of a headquarters office, zone and subordinate of-
fices as required, and intelligence units at naval 
stations and other naval activities as designated 
by the Commandant. The personnel of zone and 
subordinate offices are directly under the DIO. 
Intelligence officers assigned to naval stations and 
other naval activities are members of the staffs of 
those commands. 
Under the technical guidance of the DI0s, the 
various naval districts and river commands con-
duct specialized intelligence training programs 
for officers of the Naval Intelligence Reserve. 
Intelligence Sections and Units of the Operating 
Forces, Including Outlying Bases 
In the fleet, as in the district and river com-
mands, the basic pattern of the intelligence or-
ganization is that of the staff section. On the staff 
of each area, fleet, type, and task force commander, 
and on the staffs of all flag officers exercising com-
mand, there is an intelligence section headed by a 
flag Intelligence Officer. 
Sections 0504 (4) and 0506 (1), Navy Regula-
tions, 1948, provide, respectively, that a com-
mander in Chief, or commander of any other or-
ganization or unit of the Operating Forces shall

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
military aspects of the national and international 
situation" and shall "keep his immediate superior 
appropriately informed of . . . intelligence infor-
mation which may be of value." 
These two articles make each commander re-
sponsible for the collection, processing, and dis-
semination of intelligence within his own com-
mand, and the dissemination of intelligence to 
higher echelons. Because of the complexity of 
present-day naval operations, and the consequent 
need for a steady and voluminous flow of intelli-
gence, a commander must rely on his staff to carry 
out most of his intelligence responsibilities. 
Wartime intelligence organization in the oper-
ating forces was by no means uniform. This di-
versity was due in part to the relative independ-
ence of the various commands, and in part to their 
widely differing needs. Late in World War II, 
considerable progress was made toward uniform-
ity. Nevertheless, the exigencies of any future 
war are likely to result in intelligence organiza-
tions quite different from those of peacetime, since 
each commander must bear the responsibility for 
organizing his intelligence section to meet his par-
ticular needs. But no future development will 
alter the responsibility incumbent upon intelli-
gence officers with the operating forces--as upon 
all members of Naval Intelligence?to see that all 
intelligence received or produced flows upward to 
the higher echelons where it can be properly evalu-
ated and disseminated and so, ultimately, reaches 
the Office of Naval Intelligence. 
For background purposes, the organization of 
fleet intelligence during World War II need be 
only summarized. In general, the area command-
ers were served by large intelligence centers, which 
later set up offices in forward sectors for more 
rapid collection and dissemination. These intelli-
gence centers proved their usefulness, and counter-
parts of them are likely to be established in any 
future war. They were intelligence agencies, usu-
ally large, which served the commander and all 
subordinate units of his command, but were sep-
arate from the relatively small intelligence section 
of the staff itself. So far as practicable, they were 
joint activities of the Navy and the other armed 
forces. Their normal work included photog-
raphy, photo-interpretation, hydrography, car-
tography, target and flak analysis, interrogation 
CONFIDENTIAL

and translation. On the lower echelons of the 
area command, an intelligence officer?sometimes 
with one or more assistants?was assigned to each 
flag afloat, including fleet air wings. Intelligence 
officers were also assigned to battleships, cruisers, 
destroyer and motor torpedo boat squadrons, all 
major amphibious units and all carriers, air 
groups and air squadrons. 
Since World War II, ONI and the Bureau of 
Naval Personnel have had the objective of plac-
ing trained intelligence officers in all echelons of 
command. In practice, however, on many staffs, 
no trained intelligence officer is available, and a 
staff officer is given additional duty in intelligence. 
Shipboard intelligence organizations also have 
suffered from a lack of personnel. Article 0916, 
Navy Regulations, 1948, provides that the opera-
tions officer of a ship, under the commanding offi-
cer, shall be responsible for the collection and 
analysis of intelligence information. Accord-
ingly an intelligence officer, when available, is as-
signed to the operations department of every 
capital ship and of other ships as conditions 
warrant. 
The primary responsibility of intelligence offi-
cers assigned to the operating forces is to meet 
the intelligence requirements of their immediate 
commander. However, they have an added re-
sponsibility, through their commander to ONI, 
in collecting information for not only their im-
mediate command but also the Naval Establish-
ment as a whole. Intelligence Sections and units 
of the operating forces are supported by the In-
telligence Branch of ONI. 
Joint and Combined Intelligence and Liaison 
Activities 
During World War II the scope and diversity 
of the fighting required an unprecedented degree 
of joint and combined activity and hence joint 
and combined intelligence. United States naval 
intelligence officers served as observers with the 
British Fleet. British personnel were attached 
to American armed forces. Amphibious opera-
tions in both the Pacific and the European theaters 
were planned and supervised jointly by sea, 
ground, and air specialists. 
Naval Intelligence participated in joint intelli-
gence activities on all echelons during World War

II, from the Joint Intelligence Committee, the in-
telligence agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
down to small field units engaged in such tasks as 
the exploitation of captured documents and the 
interrogation of prisoners of war. Less than a 
dozen of these joint intelligence activities sur-
vived the peace. 
Several trends initiated in wartime have con-
tinued in the postwar period?namely, the trends 
toward joint and combined scientific research and 
development, joint and combined intelligence pro-
duction, and joint and combined staff training. 
All commanders of naval operating forces are 
authorized and directed, subject to the prior ap-
proval of DNI, to conduct or participate in joint 
intelligence activities which they believe are re-
quired for successful execution of their missions. 
Among the assignments open to naval intelligence 
officers are participation in the work of the Joint 
Staff, under the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and duty in 
the Central Intelligence Agency. 
MARINE CORPS INTELLIGENCE 
While the United States Marine Corps draws its 
intelligence information from the Navy, it pat-
terns its Intelligence organization after the Army. 
The Commandant of the Marine Corps has a staff 
Intelligence Officer (G-2) and a headquarters in-
telligence section which produces intelligence of 
interest to the Corps on such subjects as foreign 
coasts, landing beaches, and associated subjects. 
Most strategic intelligence is obtained directly 
from ONI. During joint operations the Marine 
Corps also obtains intelligence from the Army. 
Intelligence Officers are assigned to all Marine 
operating units of battalion level and higher. The 
size of the intelligence section varies with the size 
and needs of the unit. For example, a battalion 
has but one intelligence officer, while a division 
may have five officers in its intelligence section. 
Marine intelligence officers are also assigned to 
duty in ONI, in Naval Attache billets, on naval 
operating staffs and with the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 
ARMY INTELLIGENCE 
The Army intelligence organization is officially 
called the "Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, 
85 
0-2, Intelligence, General Staff, United States 
Army." The Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, is a 
member of the General Staff, United States Army, 
and is coequal with the heads of the other General 
Staff divisions. He is thus an echelon higher than 
his naval counterpart, the Director of Naval In-
telligence, but his responsibilities are substantially 
the same. 
As shown in figure 7, there are five operating di-
visions in the Army's 0-2 organization: Adminis-
trative, Collection and Dissemination, Production, 
Security, and Training. Each consists of several 
branches. The Administrative Division contains 
the following Branches: Attache, Fiscal, Message 
Center (communications), Personnel, and Service 
(including records and translation). The Collec-
tion and Dissemination Division operates the War 
Room, is responsible for intelligence requirements 
and publications, and maintains the 0-2 Docu-
ment Library. The Production Division is com-
posed of the Estimates Branch, three geographic 
branches?Eastern, Western, and Eurasian?the 
Technical and Special Research Branches, Area 
Resources Branch, and the Air Intelligence Com-
ponent which works with the Air Force. In the 
Security Division are the three branches respon-
sible for censorship, personnel security, and the 
security of military information. The Training 
Division is concerned with regular and reserve in-
telligence training, and also operates the Map and 
Photo Branch. 
The Army Security Agency (ASA) and the 
Counter-Intelligence Corps (CIC) are specialized 
organizations of importance. ASA is responsible 
for communications intelligence and security. 
CIC is the counterintelligence agency of the 
Army; it makes all investigations for which the 
Army is responsible under the Delimitation Agree-
ment, and also investigates compromises of mili-
tary information and cases involving foreign na-
tionals both in the United States and abroad. 
Each of these agencies takes care of its own ad-
ministration, including the procurement, training 
and assignment of personnel, and the development 
of equipment and doctrine. Their work, however, 
comes within the purview of G-2, and close liaison 
and coordination is maintained.

AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE 
The Directorate of Intelligence under the Dep-
uty Chief of Staff for Operations, Headquarters, 
USAF, is usually abbreviated "D/I" and desig-
nated AFOIN?literally Air Force Operations 
/Ntelligence?a term corresponding to "Op 32" 
in the Navy. In command structure, the Air 
Force follows the Navy, rather than the Army, in 
making Intelligence subordinate to Operations. 
This Air Force organization deserves special com-
ment for several reasons. It differs from ONI and 
0-2 in that it has no responsibility for counter-
intelligence; it formulates no policy for safeguard-
ing military information; and it specifically pro-
duces intelligence for the other military services. 
The Navy and the Army provide approximately 
one-third of the personnel in the intelligence pro-
ducing divisions of the Directorate in return for 
processed air intelligence for the Army, Navy, and 
Marine air arms. 
Figure 8 indicates that Air Force Intelligence 
is headed by a Director of Intelligence assisted 
by three Deputy Directors: for Collection and 
Dissemination, Estimates, and Targets. The Di-
rector also administers the Air Technical Intelli-
gence Center. 
The Director's responsibilities include collect-
ing information on the air potential and air forces 
of foreign countries; producing intelligence from 
this information; and disseminating this material 
not only within the Air Force, but also to the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Central Intelligence 
Agency, and other departments and agencies as 
appropriate. He directs and controls all USAF 
intelligence activities, including the Air Attache 
system. He sets up the air intelligence require-
ments for USAF photo reconnaissance, mapping 
and charting and geodetic surveying programs. 
He is further responsible for meeting the intelli-
gence requirements of the continental and over-
seas air commands, and the air administrative 
and technical services. The Director also repre-
sents the Air Force on intelligence matters with 
other departments and agencies of the United 
States Government and with foreign governments. 
The Office of the Director of Special Investiga-
tions, an agency under the USAF Inspector Gen-
eral, is the counterintelligence agency of the Air 
Force. It is responsible for safeguarding military 
87 
information, and for investigating all cases of 
espionage, sabotage, treason, subversion, etc., 
within the Air Force. 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (FBI) 
The FBI is the chief internal security agency 
of the Federal Government. It is now responsible 
for investigating violations of more than 100 Fed-
eral laws. Under some of these laws, such as 
the Atomic Energy Act and the Federal Em-
ployees Loyalty Program, specific responsibility 
has been given to the FBI by the law itself or 
by Presidential Directive. Under others, the FBI 
exercises its general investigative functions in all 
cases where the United States is or may become a 
party in interest. The FBI also promotes scien-
tific crime detection by means of its laboratory, 
its fingerprint files, and the FBI National Acad-
emy for law-enforcement officers. 
The FBI is organized in seven Divisions: (1) 
Identification; (2) Training and Inspection; (3) 
Administration; (4) Records and Communica-
tions; (5) General Investigations; (6) Labora-
tory; and (7) Security. The latter division is 
of primary interest to Naval Intelligence because 
of mutual counterintelligence responsibilities. 
THE DELIMITATION AGREEMENT 
The Delimitation Agreement originated in a 
Presidential directive of 26 June 1939, which pro-
vided that investigations of all matters concerning 
espionage, counterespionage, subversion, and sab-
otage (the "four categories") should be conducted 
and controlled emclusively by Naval Intelligence, 
Military Intelligence, and the FBI. The heads 
of these three agencies were directed to form a 
committee to pool information and coordinate ac-
tivities. This became the Interdepartmental In-
telligence Conference (IIC), which worked out 
the Delimitation Agreement, prescribing the juris-
diction and investigative duties of each of the 
three agencies. Under the original Agreement, 
the Navy assumed responsibility for the investi-
gation and disposal of cases in the "four cate-
gories" involving (a) personnel of the Naval 
Establishment, including civilians employed by 
the Navy, and (b) personnel in areas under its 
administrative control: Guam, Samoa, Palmyra,

Johnson, Wake, and Midway. In Japan, the 
Navy and FBI had joint responsibility. 
After the War, changes in the Delimitation 
Agreement were necessitated by the Atomic En-
ergy Act of 1946, which provided that everyone 
authorized to have access to "restricted" atomic 
data should have been investigated by the FBI. 
Some of the people for whom such authorization 
was desired wore Army or Navy uniforms. Ac-
cordingly, the FBI was required to conduct in-
vestigations of all Armed Forces personnel for 
"Q clearances" for access to "restricted" atomic 
data. However, as a result of the Agreement of 
February 1951, Armed Forces personnel are now 
given access to "restricted" atomic data on the 
strength of their military security clearances, ex-
cept in cases involving contractors with the Atomic 
Energy Commission or their employees. 
The Delimitation Agreement was also affected 
by the Federal Employees Loyalty Program (Ex-
ecutive Order 9835 of March 21,1947). Although 
this applied mainly to civilian employees in the 
Executive Branch of the Government, it directed 
the Armed Forces to take such steps as necessary 
to ensure the loyalty of their own personnel. It 
also directed the FBI to make all investigations. 
Accordingly, the Navy is no longer responsible for 
investigations in the "four categories" of civilians 
whom it employs or over whom it has administra-
tive control. Nevertheless, in areas under Naval 
Administrative control, the Navy in practice still 
does the job for the FBI, and also investigates 
all cases involving personnel of the Military Sea 
Transportation Service. For purposes of the De-
limitation Agreement, Reserve personnel on in-
active duty are civilians. 
To sum up, in the "four categories", the Navy 
now restricted to investigations involving ac-
duty and retired naval and marine personnel, 
the exceptions stated above. However, its 
Iction to make general security investigations 
the "four categories" is not restricted either 
3 Delimitation Agreement or any other regu-
17 document; and it still makes many investi-
ions involving civilians, for example, in cases 
Involving its own employees, applicants for naval 
employment, and employees of naval contractors. 
By provision of the National Security Act of 
1947, the Director of Special Investigations, 
269196-54----7 
USAF, joined the Director, FBI, the Assistant 
Chief of Staff, G-2, and the Director of Naval 
Intelligence on the Interdepartmental Intelligence 
Conference. Thus the Air Force is governed by 
and participates in the provisions of the Delimita-
tion Agreement. 
STATE DEPARTMENT INTELLIGENCE 
The Special Assistant to the Secretary of State, 
Intelligence, has the rank of Assistant Secretary 
of State. His office provides the departmental 
intelligence of the State Department. In the field 
of national intelligence, it is primarily, though 
not exclusively, responsible for political, cultural, 
and sociological matters, by NSC directive. In 
practice, it has also produced most economic in-
telligence and considerable scientific intelligence. 
It has a special responsibility for coordinating 
overt intelligence activities abroad, since, by NSC 
directive, the Chiefs of Mission are the coordina-
tors of such activities. 
As shown in figure 9, the State Department 
Office of Intelligence has two major suboffices, each 
of which has a number of divisions. The Office 
of Intelligence Research (OIR) plans and de-
velops an intelligence research program along 
regional and functional lines, and coordinates it 
with that of other Federal agencies. In this 
manner the Department is provided with the in-
telligence necessary for the formulation and exe-
cution of foreign policy. On the other hand, 
information pertinent to national security is fur-
nished to the Security Council, the Central Intel-
ligence Agency, and the Department of Defense. 
In addition to carrying on intelligence research, 
OIR prepares or participates in the preparation 
of studies and spot intelligence for authorized 
recipients in the Department and other Federal 
agencies. It continuously scrutinizes world situa-
tions and deals with intelligence problems sub-
mitted to it by the Secretary, Under Secretary, 
Planning Adviser, and other State Department 
officials, as well as the Central Intelligence Agency 
and the Department of Defense. It directs De-
partment of State participation in the National 
Intelligence Survey basic research program and 
works in close cooperation with the Central In-
telligence Agency and other governmental agen-

Government and other distinguished visitors, and 
for international conferences in the United States. 
It maintains official liaison with the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, the Treasury Depart-

a visa for entry into the United States unless he 
has been cleared through the Visa Division. Such 
clearance is effected or denied on the basis of 
information gathered by the Department and 
other governmental intelligence agencies with 
which it maintains close liaison. 
ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION INTELLIGENCE 
Because of the importance of intelligence con-
cerning the military applications of nuclear 
power, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) 
has an Office of Intelligence and a Division of 
Security. 
The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 first provided 
four divisions, Research, Production, Engineer-
ing, and Military Applications, to aid the General 
Manager in carrying out his duties. Other divi-
sions were needed, and in 1948 a Division of 
Security and Intelligence was created. Shortly 
thereafter, this division became the Division of 
Security when a separate Office of Intelligence was 
formed with a Director. 
The Office of Intelligence has no collection 
function, but it may request information from 
other agencies. When information of atomic and 
thermonuclear interest is received by any govern-
ment agency (including the non-intelligence agen-
cies such as Commerce), it is forwarded to the 
AEC where a group of highly trained scientists 
in the Office of Intelligence evaluates the incoming 
information. The Director of Intelligence may 
also call upon the leading scientists in the country 
for consultation on the proper evaluation of in-
formation received. The resultant intelligence is 
disseminated to the President, the National Se-
curity Council, the Department of Defense, CIA, 
and others as appropriate. This evaluation is 
AEC's important contribution to intelligence. 
91 
CONFIDENTIAL 
A great and continuing concern of the Atomic 
Energy Commission is the safeguarding of our 
atomic program from espionage, sabotage, theft, 
and destruction. This counterintelligence func-
tion is taken care of by the Division of Security. 
In Washington, on the General Manager's staff, 
the Division of Security has four sections: Physi-
cal Security, Personnel Security, Document Con-
trol, Violations and Visitor Control. The 
functions of each section are essentially what the 
names imply. The Division also supervises field 
security offices at nine installations in the United 
States. Internal security investigations are ini-
tiated by these offices, but if it appears that a 
regulation of the Atomic Energy Act has been 
violated, it becomes a case for the FBI. 
INTERDEPARTMENTAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES 
There are many areas of activity and interest 
where the intelligence requirements of two or 
more government agencies or departments coin-
cide; therefore, in the interests of efficiency and 
the coordination of effort interdepartmental in-
telligence agencies are established. If all the par-
ticipating departments are military, the agency is 
called "joint." 
Intelligence Organization for the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff 
The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) , to-
gether with its full-time staff, the Joint Intelli-
gence Group (JIG) , is the intelligence agency of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As such, it is the high-
est-level intelligence agency within the Depart-
ment of Defense. Its members are: the Assistant 
Chief of Staff, G-2, General Staff, U. S. Army; 
the Director of Naval Intelligence; the Director 
of Intelligence, USAF; and the Deputy Director 
of the Joint Staff for Intelligence. In short, the 
Joint Intelligence Committee is composed of the 
intelligence chiefs of all the armed forces, plus a 
fourth member who directs the Joint Intelligence 
Group. 
The JIC is charged with: (a) the preparation 
of joint intelligence estimates for the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff and their subordinate committees; (b) 
the coordination of photographic, mapping, and 
charting activities of the Department of Defense; 
and (c) security matters within JCS jurisdiction.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Since the three departmental committee mem-
bers devote only a part of their time to JIC mat-
ters, a full-time working staff is required to 
prepare joint estimates, reports, plans and policies 
for Committee approval. This staff is the Joint 
Intelligence Group of the Joint Staff. 
The JIC/JIG differs from other intelligence 
organizations relating to the national security in 
that it is neither a collecting nor a disseminating 
agency. It does not duplicate the work of the 
departmental agencies or the CIA, but merely uses 
the intelligence material of those agencies to meet 
the intelligence requirements of the JCS and their 
supporting committees and groups. 
Interdepartmental Coordinating Committees 
Where the intelligence requirements of two or 
more departments coincide, the necessary collec-
tion and production operations are brought into 
common action by special-purpose committees. 
There are a number of such coordinating commit-
tees, the most important being the Interdepart-
mental Intelligence Conference (TIC), discussed 
in connection with the FBI, the Intelligence Ad-
visory Committee (IAC), which serves to coordi-
nate the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) with 
the other Federal intelligence agencies concerned 
with the national security, and the National In-
telligence Survey (NIS) Committee. The IAC 
is composed of the intelligence directors of the 
Justice Department (FBI) ,the State Department, 
the Atomic Energy Commission, the Army, the 
Navy, the Air Force and the Joint Staff, in addi-
tion to the Director of Central Intelligence, who 
acts as chairman. 
During World War II, the main source of basic 
intelligence for the armed forces was a series of 
handbooks known as Joint Army-Navy Intelli-
gence Studies (JANIS). The deficiencies of the 
JANIS series emphasized the fact that basic in-
telligence must be produced on a much broader 
scale, over a longer period, and, as far as possible, 
in time of peace. Therefore, on 13 January 1948, 
the NIS program was initiated. 
The NIS Program represents the combined in-
telligence efforts of the CIA, the Army, the Navy, 
the Air Force, and the State Department. It is 
supervised by the NIS Committee, which consists 
of representatives of all the contributing agencies, 
CONFIDENTIAL 
92 
and is coordinated by the CIA. Its purpose is to 
produce a concise digest of basic intelligence, such 
as, encyclopedic knowledge of the geographic, eco-
nomic, socio-political and military characteristics 
of every foreign country. 
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
During World War II, intelligence-coordinat-
ing agencies including the Office of -War Infor-
mation (0W1) and the Office of Strategic Serv-
ices (OSS) were created by Presidential directive 
and a Joint Intelligence C ommittee (JIC) was es-
tablished under the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The 
JIC soon recognized the need for, and proposed, 
a national agency to coordinate intelligence 
produced by the various Departments. Its pro-
posal resulted in the Presidential letter of 22 Jan-
uary 1946, which created the National Intelligence 
Authority, and the Central Intelligence Group as 
its operating agency. The Authority was di-
rected to plan, develop, and coordinate all Federal 
intelligence activities "so as to assure the most 
effective accomplishment of the intelligence mis-
sion related to the national security." 
The National Security Act of 1947 established 
the National Security Council (NSC) which took 
the place of the National Intelligence Authority, 
specifically abolished by the act. The Central In-
telligence Agency (CIA) was established under 
the Council as the statutory successor of the Cen-
tral Intelligence Group. 
The Director of CIA 
The Act specifically provides for a Director of 
Central Intelligence, appointed by the President 
with the advice and consent of the Senate. The 
Director may be either a civilian or an officer of 
one of the armed forces. In the latter event, the 
Act provides the safeguard that, during his tenure, 
the Director shall be subject to no greater military 
control than would any civilian; nor shall he have 
or exercise any control, other than as Director, 
over any component of the armed forces. Service 
as Director is to have no effect, except as described 
above, on the status, office or rank in the Armed 
Forces of any military man so appointed. 
One of the most important provisions of the Act 
gives the Director the right in his discretion to 
"terminate the employment of any officer or em-

UNITED STATES ORGANIZATIONS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY CONFIDENTIAL 
ployee of the Agency whenever he shall deem such 
termination necessary or advisable in the interests 
of the United States." This provision frees the 
director from civil service restrictions. In an in-
telligence agency, where security is paramount, 
freedom in dismissing employees is an obvious 
necessity. 
The duties of the CIA are set forth in section 
102 of the Act, as follows: 
(1) to advise the National Security Coun-
cil in matters concerning such intelligence 
activities of the Government departments and 
agencies as relate to the national security; 
(2) to make recommendations to the Na-
tional Security Council for the coordination 
of such intelligence activities of the depart-
ments and agencies of the Government as re-
late to the national security; 
(3) to correlate and evaluate intelligence 
relating to the national security, and provide 
for the appropriate dissemination of such in-
formation within the Government using 
where appropriate existing agencies and fa-
cilities: Provided, That the _Agency shall have 
no police, subpoena, law-enforcement powers, 
or internal security functions: Provided fur-
ther, That the departments and other agencies 
of the Government shall continue to collect, 
evaluate, correlate, and disseminate depart-
mental intelligence: And provided further, 
That the Director of Central Intelligence 
shall be responsible for protecting intelligence 
sources and methods from unauthorized- dis-
closure; 
(4) to perform, for the benefit of the exist-
ing intelligence agencies, such additional 
services of common concern as the National 
Security Council determines can be more effi-
ciently accomplished centrally; 
(5) to perform such other functions and 
duties related to intelligence affecting the na-
tional security as the National Security Coun-
cil may from time to time direct. 
The first paragraph of Section 102 directs and 
authorizes the CIA to serve as intelligence ad-
viser to the NSC on all matters relating to the 
national security. 
The second paragraph requires the CIA to make 
recommendations to the NSC for coordinating 
such intelligence activities of the Government as 
relate to the national security. In performing its 
duties under this paragraph the CIA has the coun-
sel of the Intelligence Advisory Committee de-
scribed in the preceding section. Through the 
IAC, the CIA is able to maintain close contact 
with all the departmental intelligence agencies 
concerned with the national security; it can bene-
fit from their knowledge, experience and judg-
ment, and keep itself informed of their intelli-
gence requirements. Their views can serve as the 
basis for recommendations made by the CIA to 
the NSC. In particular, the IAC can help the 
CIA determine the primary fields of intelligence 
responsibility of the various departments and 
agencies. Thus it can help in promoting efficiency 
by the elimination of duplicate missions, func-
tions, and services. 
The third paragraph of Section 102 provides for 
the correlation and evaluation of intelligence re-
lating to the national security. This task involves 
the production of national intelligence. Just as 
the NSC integrates national policies that could 
not be integrated by either the State or the De-
fense Department alone, so the CIA draws upon 
the intelligence produced by the various depart-
ments, supplements it, and integrates it into a 
product which is suitable in content and form for 
national planning. However, the CIA does not 
interfere with the production of departmental in-
telligence. Each department must still evaluate, 
correlate, and interpret that intelligence which is 
within its own exclusive competence and is needed 
for its own use. 
The CIA is further charged with the dissemi-
nation of national intelligence within the Gov-
ernment. Because of this responsibility, CIA 
must at all times know the intelligence require-
ments of the various Government departments 
and agencies. This function of disseminating na-
tional intelligence to the departments that need it 
is clearly essential. Owing to the volume and 
complexity of intelligence information available, 
it should be a centralized function; and the proper 
place for centralizing it is the focal point where 
all the streams of incoming intelligence converge. 
Thus the Act gives the CIA two major functions 
of intelligence?production and dissemination. It 
makes no explicit provision for the third major 
function?collection. Nevertheless, the duties of 
the CIA under the second paragraph of Section 
102, with respect to the coordination of depart-
mental intelligence activities, entail the coordina-
tion of foreign intelligence collection. As to col-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
lection, then, the role of the CIA is at least to pre-
vent gaps, cross-purposes, and wasteful duplica-
tion among the various departments and agencies. 
On the one hand, to give a fictitious example, some 
department or agency should collect economic in-
telligence information. On the other hand, the 
Air Force should not concern itself with the col-
lection of detailed sociological information about 
Java. 
The fourth paragraph of this Section gives the 
CIA a further warrant for foreign intelligence 
collection by authorizing it to perform "such addi-
tional services of common concern as the National 
Security Council determines can be more efficiently 
accomplished centrally." In eliminating waste-
ful duplication of collection functions, therefore, 
the CIA can use either of two methods. It can 
discontinue the overlapping collection efforts of 
all but one of the departments, and arrange for 
that one to serve all the others. In doing so, it 
would merely be coordinating. Or, instead, it may 
supplant the collection efforts of all the depart-
ments with its own collection effort, and perform 
the collection function itself as a service of com-
mon concern to the existing intelligence agencies. 
Which, if either, method is used in any given case 
is of course determined by the NSO. 
To sum up, then, the National Security Act rec-
ognized the need for departmental intelligence, 
and in fact specifically provided for its continu-
ance; at the same time, the Act recognized the need 
for the coordination of departmental intelligence, 
and for the production and dissemination of na-
tional intelligence, and created the CIA to per-
form these functions; and, finally, the Act pro-
vided that certain unspecified intelligence func-
tions should be centralized in the interests of 
efficiency. 
OTHER UNITED STATES AGENCIES PRODUCING 
INTELLIGENCE 
Although it is not possible to trace in detail the 
organizations of all agencies of government that 
collect information and process it into intelli-
gence, it is most important for the naval officer 
engaged in intelligence work to realize that his 
sources are not limited to the national security 
agencies alone. With proper liaison he will dis-
cover that there are available vast analytical and

cataloguing resources in the federal government, 
and also many operating agencies with functions 
closely allied to security. 
Department of the Treasury 
A number of offices and bureaus within the 
Treasury have intelligence functions. The Office 
of International Finance studies foreign econ-
omies, international capital movements, gold 
movements, and exchange controls. It can block 
the movement of foreign assets under United 
States jurisdiction. The Bureau of Customs not 
only collects duties on imports but is concerned 
with preventing smuggling, registering vessels, 
and stopping the export of controlled materials. 
The Bureau of Narcotics controls trade in nar-
cotic drugs and of necessity works closely with 
some foreign governments. The Alcohol Tax 
Unit may become involved in blocking illegal al-
cohol operations if of an international scope. The 
United States Secret Service tries to prevent 
counterfeiting, and provides various protective 
services including guarding the President and his 
family. 
The United States Coast Guard, though a part 
of the Department of the Navy in wartime, is nor-
mally under the Treasury. It not only saves lives 
at sea, provides navigation aids, and sets safety 
standards for merchant ships, but also has major 
responsibility for port security and checking on 
the loyalty of seamen. 
Department of Commerce 
This is another department of interest to In-
telligence. It contains the Bureau of Foreign and 
Domestic Commerce with a subordinate Office of 
International Trade, a major collector and proces-
sor of economic and commercial intelligence from 
the whole world. The Federal Maritime Board 
has to study foreign costs of ship construction and 
operation, and approve any international rate 
agreements that involve United States steamship 
companies. The Civil Aeronautics Board makes 
many studies of world aviation developments, and 
works closely with the International Civil Avia-
tion Organization of the United Nations. The 
Patent Office collects and analyzes the official jour-
nals of all foreign patent offices. The Weather 
Bureau collects weather reports from all over the 
world to add to its domestic analyses. The Coast

and Geodetic Survey collects data on United States 
territorial waters and on a number of overseas 
areas that are important to naval operations. The 
Bureau of the Census as a service agency manipu-
lates data fed to it by government offices, and these 
include foreign trade statistics and international 
statistics in general. 
Other Agencies 
There are additional agencies. Some of the 
more obvious include: (1) the Office of Interna-
tional Labor Affairs in the Department of Labor, 
which watches developments abroad in use and 
behavior of labor and labor organizations; (2) 
the Office of Alien Property in the Department 
of Justice, which keeps track of foreign assets 
under our jurisdiction and possible trading with 
the enemy; (3) the Immigration and Naturaliza-
tion Service, also in the Department of Justice, 
which watches for violations of immigration laws 
and maintains border patrols; (4) the Depart-
ment of Agriculture's Office of Foreign Agricul-
tural Relations which has attaches abroad to 
collect data and makes analyses of world-wide de-
velopments in agriculture; (5) the same De-
partment's Bureau of Entomology and Plant 
Quarantine, which like the United States Public 
Health Service may be in the forefront of detect-
ing biological warfare attacks upon the United 
States; (6) the Post Office Department's Bureau 
of the Chief Post Office Inspector, whose studies of 
postal law violations may turn up much informa-
tion of intelligence interest; (7) the Department 
of Interior's Office of Territories and many special 
commissions and corporations which serve as 
sources of intelligence on our own territories; (8) 
the Federal Communications Commission, which 
tracks down clandestine radio stations and keeps 
95 
track of use of frequencies by transmitters both 
at home and abroad; (9) the Federal Reserve 
Board, which makes studies of international fi-
nance; (10) the Tariff Commission, which studies 
foreign costs, protective measures, and other re-
trictions ; (11) the Smithsonian Institution, 
which collects and studies scientific data the world 
over, and its subsidiary International Exchange 
Service which trades scientific publications with 
foreign countries; (12) the Library of Congress, 
which also has exchange and collection functions; 
(13) the Office of Civil Defense with its physical 
security functions; and (14) such quasi-official or 
private groups as the National Geographic Society, 
which can send expeditions to remote places, and 
prepare finished maps based upon data collected, 
and the Bureau of Railway Economics, which also 
has very wide collection and processing facilities. 
The above list, by no means exhaustive, indicates 
the variety of agencies that are in some way useful 
to Intelligence, although they are not intelligence 
agencies in the strict sense of the term. 
In any review of United States Organizations 
for National Security it must be kept in mind that, 
in actuality, they are not inanimate spaces on a 
formal chart but rather living vital composites of 
many individuals each of whom is daily contribut-
ing his talents and energies toward the production 
of a total coordinated product. The best finished 
product is possible only when each individual con-
tributor has a clear perspective of the total field 
of which he is a part so that his own efforts will 
blend effectively and harmoniously. Therefore, 
in order to aid the naval intelligence officer to 
carry out his assigned duties and responsibilities 
most effectively, the following chapter will be de-
voted to a consideration of the proper intelligence 
perspective he must have.

CHAPTER 4 
AN INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE IN A CHANGING WORLD 
The iob of Intelligence is "to winnow the extraneous data from the vital facts and to set these facts 
In proper perspective . . ." 
This statement was made following World War 
II by Rear Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter in 
describing the function of intelligence to produce 
usable knowledge. Its key words, "proper per-
spective" aptly describe the central theme of this 
chapter. 
Cause and effect, action and counter-action are 
woven into an unending pattern of conditions and 
situations which must be followed with infinite 
care the world over. The relentless continuity 
of events makes it impossible to consider them 
singly or outside their frame of reference. Mili-
tary policies and international politics are inter-
dependent and neither can be effective without the 
other. Similarly, the strategies of nations may 
begin and end within a period of war, or they may 
be conducted, with or without change, continuously 
between wars. The intelligence officer must be 
schooled in the field of international relations in 
order that he may develop a broad sense of world 
affairs and recognize the trends which will give the 
fullest meaning to emerging situations. In de-
veloping this sensitivity he must keep in mind the 
functions of intelligence, its past influence on 
world events, and the purposes of the various agen-
cies which it supports. 
In chapter lit was stated that Intelligence has 
three primary functions: first, to give warning 
of any hostile plans directed against a nation or 
a military force; second, to provide the knowl-
edge upon which policies and plans can be based; 
and third, to counter the intelligence efforts of 
opposing nations. The very nature of military 
warfare maximizes the opportunity of Intelligence 
to predict the time and place of attack. The 
greater variables in time of peace, however, re-
quire Intelligence to evaluate with care the par-
ticular factors which may produce specific 
developments within certain periods of time. The 
importance of such evaluations was stressed by 
Maj. Gen. William J. Donovan when he said: 
269196-54-8 
97 
"Government policy must be based upon a tested 
knowledge of the facts. What facts? The capa-
bilities, the intentions, and the policies of other 
nations . . (Intelligence is) just the careful 
gathering and analysis and interpretation of many 
bits of evidence." 
The need for intelligence in time of war has 
been generally recognized; its importance in time 
of peace is still a topic of considerable argument 
among some political leaders and students of 
government. A British writer recently com-
mented that, prior to World War II, intelligence 
seemed to have little purpose as long as the vital 
interests of the nation did not appear to be threat-
ened. As late as August 1952, a well-known 
American, in describing United States intelligence 
organizations, remarked that they would be un-
necessary if American relations with the Soviet 
Union were normal. This failure to understand 
the need for continuity in intelligence activity 
arises from a misconception of the terms "war" 
and "peace." Certainly they are not exclusive 
concepts. For example, it is almost impossible to 
pin-point the causes of wars and the exact times 
when each really began. Since basic national in-
terests remain relatively the same, the transition 
from war to peace is merely a shift in emphasis 
on the means employed to promote those interests. 
Instead of military force, the means may be poli-
tical, economic, psychological, or a combination 
of all three. 
Likewise for intelligence the end of a war means 
only a shift in major interests. Instead of the 
numbers and movements of troops and ships, in-
terest centers on the capabilities of new weapons, 
the acquisition of new strategic bases, and the 
development of new areas of political influence. 
Political machinations in the world's trouble spots, 
exploitation of markets for manufactured goods, 
and the control of strategic materials become sub-
jects of concern. Knowledge of these matters may

alter relationships and determine the attitudes of 
one nation toward another at international confer-
ences or at meetings of the United Nations. In-
telligence has the responsibility not only to acquire 
such positive information regarding other nations 
of the world, but also to perform its equally im-
portant function of preventing the disclosures of 
vital information and countering foreign es-
pionage. 
Consideration of the historical development in 
chapter 2 led to the conclusion that Intelligence 
has often influenced the outcome of military and 
political events which had world-wide repercus-
sions. The intelligence officer, therefore, must be 
fully aware of the scope of his interests and the 
implications of his activities. The guerrilla war-
fare carried on by Lawrence of Arabia in World 
War I had a strategic significance out of all pro-
portion to the size, area of combat, and equipment 
of his modest forces. The German agent, Wass-
muss, held southern Persia under his personal 
influence and did much to prolong the British mili-
tary campaign in that area. Early in World War 
II, a cipher clerk in the American Embassy at 
London provided Germany with vital diplomatic 
information passing between Washington and 
London. When his treachery was finally discov-
ered, during the dark days of Dunkirk and the 
fall of France, all classified communications of 
the American State Department had to be sus-
pended until new codes were prepared and. 
distributed. The impact of this failure of 
counterintelligence was brought out at the Nurem-
berg trials when various Nazi leaders stated that 
the information derived through the American 
cipher clerk influenced their decision to curtail 
military activity during the winter of 1939-40 
while they prepared for the spring offensive 
against France. The use of the Italian Embassy 
in London for the transmittal of this information 
may well have influenced Italy's decision to post-
pone her entry into the war for about ten months. 
In the preceding chapter, the purpose of the 
discussion was to review the various government 
agencies responsible for planning and formulating 
the foreign policies of the United States and to 
describe their supporting Intelligence subdivi-
sions. The Office of Naval Intelligence, as one 
of these subdivisions, contributes significantly to 
CONFIDENTIAL 
98 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
the production of the total knowledge used as the 
basis for national policy decisions which guide 
relationships with other nations in times of war 
and peace. This knowledge is also a fundamental 
source of support to the military commander in 
the area of operations and to both military and 
political agencies at all levels in their efforts to 
oppose the intelligence activities of other nations. 
When used at the national planning level, this 
knowledge is called Strategic Intelligence; at the 
naval planning level, it is called Naval Strategic 
Intelligence, the importance of which to any na-
tion depends upon the extent of that nation's sea 
power. At the operational level, this knowledge 
is termed Operational Intelligence. 
To be emphasized is the fact that, regardless 
of the level or echelon by which intelligence is 
used, those engaged in its activities, whether mili-
tary or civilian, cannot properly perform their 
duties without a comprehensive understanding of 
the world scene, from which is derived a clearer 
view of relationships between events wherever and 
whenever they occur. 
As early as World. War I, Brigadier General 
Marlborough Churchill, then Director of Military 
Intelligence, made this pertinent comment 
The reason why we have decided to study 
the whole world is that we believe it to be 
impossible correctly to predict the points 
which are going to be sensitive in the future, 
unless we take the trouble to find out the sit-
uation in all countries, and all the factors 
which go to make up an international situa-
tion. . . . If it is remembered that the assas-
sination of an Austrian Prince in 1914 started 
a conflagration which our Army was called 
upon to play a major part in extinguishing, 
it will be seen that MID is not doing its full 
duty if it does not attempt correctly to re-
cord and promptly to bring to the attention 
of the proper authority everything that is 
going on in the world. 
He also made the observation that, prior to World 
War I, Regular Army officers tended to limit their 
interest and training to matters of specific military 
content. 
We failed to realize that it is the duty of 
every Army officer to follow the example set 
so many years ago by the Navy, and make 
himself not only a fighting man, but also a 
well-informed man of the world.

AN INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE IN A CHANGING WORLD CONFIDENTIAL 
Important contributory elements which are the 
basis for a clear and proper perspective for in-
telligence personnel include an understanding of 
basic national interests and objectives, a knowl-
edge of the place and meaning of strategy and the 
resulting foreign policy, and an appreciation of 
the ultimate purposes of operational activities to 
implement both strategy and policy. The intelli-
gence perspective cannot be static: it must be ca-
pable of rapid adjustment to changing conditions 
and altered circumstances. It must always be 
positive, with a clear and unbiased view of its own 
purposes and responsibilities. The following dis-
cussion of these elements, although by no means 
exhaustive, should serve to portray the perspective 
which all intelligence personnel must acquire if 
they are to perform their duties successfully. It 
should also serve to indicate the necessity for 
further reading and continuous study. 
NATIONAL INTERESTS AND OBJECTIVES 
In view of the vast amount of knowledge about 
the world and its peoples, guidance is essential if 
intelligence activities are to be economically con-
centrated. Normally, specific guidance emanates 
from higher authority, but it is important to rec-
ognize that ultimate guidance is provided by the 
fundamental national interests and objectives 
which must form the basis for national strategy 
and policy. 
Our own national interests have never been more 
succinctly expressed than in the words of the Dec-
laration of Independence: "Life, Liberty, and the 
Pursuit of Happiness"; other expressions repre-
sent only the means toward these ends. Over the 
years these fundamental interests have gradually 
been broadened to include the preservation of na-
tional independence, freedom from war and the 
threat of war, improvement in standards of living 
so that everyone may have the opportunity to earn 
an even better and more secure livelihood, and the 
maintenance of friendly relations with all peoples 
of the world. 
From such interests come national objectives 
which include the protection of the American form 
of government and way of life at any cost from 
every challenge, the support of endeavors aimed at 
the peaceful resolution of all international prob-
lems, the encouragement of a healthy world econ-
omy, and the championship of nations threatened 
by any ruthless imperialistic aggressor. Em-
bodied in these objectives are certain definite social 
values, such as those enunciated as the Four Free-
doms by Roosevelt and Churchill. Of particular 
importance is the value of popular power which 
emphasizes the orderly process of making decisions 
through democratic participation. 
Few can find fault with these interests and ob-
jectives; the problems lie in their interpretation 
and implementation. For many complex reasons 
interpretations vary between various social groups 
within the nation and the power of one group may 
permit it to dominate the expression of national 
objectives at a given time. Historically, the popu-
lar power value when applied to foreign relations 
has resulted in the implementation of the objective 
of national security through international law and 
organization, a sincere effort to deter aggressive 
nations from their intentions by bargaining and 
persuasion. In his book, American Diplomacy, 
1900-1950, George F. Kennan has pointed out what 
appear to be not only certain theoretical deficien-
cies in this approach, but also the serious implica-
tions of its resultant theory of "unconditional 
surrender": 
It is a curious thing . . . that the legalistic 
approach to world affairs, rooted as it unques-
tionably is in a desire to do away with war 
and violence, makes violence more enduring, 
more terrible, and more destructive to politi-
cal stability than did the older motives of 
national interest. A war fought in the name 
of high moral principle finds no early end 
short of some form of total domination. 
If our national objectives as they relate to the 
rest of the world imply a defense of free countries 
of the world so that they may remain free, there 
is the added implication of an ability to wage war 
when necessary. However, atomic warfare of the 
present and the future could well bring ruin to a 
degree never before experienced and with it the 
destruction of what the war was fought to pro-
tect. For this reason alone, national objectives 
must transcend the mere winning of wars; they 
must include the realization of the purposes for 
which war is waged. These purposes, when de-
fined and understood, might well control the tac-
tics, targets, and even the weapons used; even 
more, they might alter the concept of total victory.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
In the past, American objectives, expressed as 
abstract moral principles, have led to some mis-
understanding and disappointment. In. the pres-
ent world crisis, there have been suggestions that 
they be more concretely defined: what are our spe-
cific objectives, our capabilities for reaching them, 
our plans for carrying them out? Various stu-
dents of government have raised the problem of 
what they describe as an American tendency to-
ward a negative approach to objectives; that is, 
expressing them in terms of opposition to those of 
another nation. They recommend a positive ap-
proach to objectives which might provide greater 
illumination and stimulation, not only to the 
American people, but also to the rest of the world. 
To point out the problems in connection with 
the interpretation and implementation of national 
objectives is easy; to solve them is a matter in-
finitely more difficult. Dr. William L. Langer, 
long associated with government agencies con-
cerned with national planning, has suggested the 
possibilities of a special staff, under the National 
Security Council, specifically charged with the 
long-range study of national objectives, together 
with provisions for the close exchange of ideas and 
coordination of action between the executive and 
legislative branches of the government. It is his 
belief that, by such means, greater unity of pur-
pose and action might be achieved. Without ques-
tion, clearly defined and well understood national 
objectives are fundamental to a national grand 
strategy aimed at encouraging our allies and dis-
couraging our adversaries. 
GRAND STRATEGY 
As a term, strategy has long been associated with 
war as an art of military command, but as a result 
of the modern complexities of war and of the-so-
ciety from which it stems, the strategy of today 
has come to embrace many factors other than mili-
tary: political, economic, technological, moral, 
and psychological. It has come to embrace activi-
ties of government and diplomacy aimed at the 
control and utilization of a nation's total resources, 
of which military forces is only one, for the pur-
pose of promoting and protecting national inter-
ests against actual or potential enemies. The di-
mensions of modern strategy become even more 
profoundly impressive when groups of nations 
CONFIDENTIAL 
band together for the promotion and protection 
of common interests. Simply defined, strategy is 
the basic pattern for employing instruments of 
power. In its broadest sense, therefore, it is 
known as grand strategy. 
In chapter 1 grand strategy was defined as the 
master plan of a nation in both war and peace, in-
cluding not only military planning but domestic 
and foreign policy as well. A more complete 
definition by B. H. Liddell-Hart is given in the 
Encyclopedia Britannica (14th edition) : 
Grand Strategy should both calculate and 
develop the economic resources and manpower 
of the nation in order to sustain the fighting 
services. So also with the moral resources?
for to foster and fortify the will to win, and to 
endure, is as important as to possess the more 
concrete forms of power. And it should reg-
ulate the distribution of power between the 
several services, and between the services and 
industry. Nor is that all, for fighting power 
is but one of the instruments of grand strat-
egy. It should take account of and and apply 
the power of financial pressure, diplomatic 
pressure, commercial pressure, and, not least, 
ethical pressure to weaken the opponent's will. 
A good cause is a sword and a buckler. Fur-
thermore, while the horizon of strategy is 
bounded by the war, grand strategy looks be-
yond the war to the subsequent peace. It 
should not only combine the various instru-
ments, but so regulate their use as to avoid 
damage to the future state of peacefulness, se-
cure and prosperous. 
There are other terms with which the intelli-
gence officer should be familiar in order to under-
stand this element of the intelligence perspective 
more thoroughly. Combined Strategy refers to 
the common strategy of coalitions of nations. Na-
tional Strategy is used interchangeably with strat-
egy and grand strategy, while Military Strategy 
is a more restrictive term, denoting the art and 
science of employing the armed forces of a nation 
to secure the objectives of national policy by the 
application of force, or the threat of force. Naval 
Strategy is the result of planning for the effective 
employment of naval power in support of national 
objectives. Other military terms have been found 
useful in describing the activities of nations. 
Strategic offensive, strategic defensive, and stra-
tegic initiative?all defined in chapter 1?apply 
to nations as well as to combat units.

AN INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE IN A CHANGING WORLD CONFIDENTIAL 
Interrelationships of Military and Political Factors 
The interchange of vocabulary is but one indi-
cation of how closely interwoven the military and 
political factors of our Nation's strategy have be-
come. Another indication is the reliance placed 
on the opinions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff by the 
Chief Executive and by the National Security 
Council, and the fact that the nation's military 
leaders are included in consultations involving top-
level planning in many areas which are not di-
rectly of a military nature. As shown in the pre-
ceding chapter, Congress has officially recognized 
the role of the military forces in connection with 
national strategy. 
World conditions, of course, have exerted a tre-
mendous influence in bringing about this situa-
uation in the United States. Specifically, the 
emphasis on force and the threat of force in the 
foreign policies of the Soviet Union has strongly 
affected the international relationships of nations. 
The problem of Korea provides a good illustration 
of the interplay of military and political factors. 
As early as 1947, $510,000,000 in military aid for 
South Korea was proposed. When the Soviet 
Union suggested a conference on Korean unity, 
the United States State Department dropped the 
military aid program. Later, when the U. S. S. R. 
took the strategic offensive and formally withdrew 
from Korea, leaving behind a trained North Ko-
rean Army, the United States had no alternative 
but to withdraw also, leaving no comparable army 
behind. When South Korea was invaded in the 
summer of 1950, it was the State Department, not 
the Department of Defense, which encouraged 
military support of the South Koreans. Having 
committed military units to Korea, the military 
leaders found their planning sharply circum-
scribed by strategic political considerations. 
Admiral Mahan set forth the proposition that 
"The strategist is he who always keeps the ob-
jective of the war in sight and the objective of 
the war is never military and is always political." 
In the past, the leaders of American military forces 
have tended to overlook this dictum, undoubtedly 
because of the meritorious, long-established, and 
deeply-rooted American conviction that overall 
civilian control of the Nation's military forces 
must be maintained at all costs. 
The Military Point of View 
The American military mind in the past has con-
centrated on the military factors involved in 
achieving victory and avoiding defeat; it has not 
associated itself officially with a consideration of 
the political implications of victory or the political 
situations which might lead to further conflict. 
As a result, when called upon, it has tended to 
concentrate on the use of direct, overpowering 
force to accomplish its objectives, leaving to other 
agencies the considerations of other means to carry 
out strategic plans. 
The developments following World War II, 
however, have had a profound effect on the think-
ing of both military and political leaders in the 
United States. It has become apparent that 
throughout that war the Soviets were guided in 
their strategic military planning by their postwar 
political objectives. For example, it has been sug-
gested that Soviet insistence on committing Allied 
forces in Italy to an invasion of southern France 
was based primarily on an effort to keep them out 
of the Balkan countries. As a result, there were 
no substantial British or American military units 
in Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary to retard the 
extension of Soviet control over those countries in 
the postwar period. The military objectives of 
the Korean war from 1950 to 1952 were obviously 
limited by broad political considerations. 
The American system of government and way 
of life will always assure civilian control of its 
military forces. The military themselves will be 
the first to reject any suggestion that they assume 
leadership in formulating national strategy and 
directing foreign policy. Since, however, our mil-
itary leaders are involved in national strategy, they 
must be thoroughly conversant with all the politi-
cal factors in order to contribute effectively to 
overall planning for the welfare and security of 
our Nation. 
Basic Considerations in the Formulation of Strategy 
Four concepts should be basic in the thinking of 
all those responsible for planning national strat-
egy. The first is that modern strategy is global. 
The interdependence of all parts of the world has 
increased to the extent that a changed condition 
in one area is quickly felt in many others. The

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Soviet "war by satellite" strategy has made clear 
the fact that many widely separated parts of the 
world are vital to our national security; while 
Stalin's comment that victory in Europe may first 
be won in Asia gives added significance to the 
drain on the military strength of France caused 
by the situation in Indo-China. An appreciation 
of this concept can serve as a constant warning 
not to concentrate on the security of one area 
without a full awareness of the possibilities of 
weakening the security of another. 
The second concept is that international rela-
tions are unstable; hence the strategic planner 
must be prepared to adjust rapidly to the prob-
abilities of change, perhaps even radical change. 
American relations with the Soviet Union, chang-
ing from allies in World War II to adversaries 
in the postwar period, illustrate the validity of 
this concept. It should be remembered also that 
the United States and Great Britain have not 
always been allies. The situation in postwar Eu-
rope demonstrates all too well the instability and 
delicate balance of relations between countries: an 
unfavorable resolution of internal conflicts within 
Germany, France, and Italy might sharply alter 
our relationships with those countries; and cer-
tainly the position of Yugoslavia has changed 
radically in a few short years. The Communist 
purges in the Soviet satellite countries during 1951 
and 1952 might indicate that the Soviet Union has 
not yet achieved complete stability in its relations 
with its involuntary associates. The significance 
of this concept is two-fold: fixation on a particu-
lar situation which exists at any given time can 
distort the evaluation of developing events and 
throw long-term planning off balance; strategic 
planning must be dynamic, sensitive to indications 
of change, and prepared to take the initiative as 
changes occur. 
The third concept is that of consistency to prin-
ciple. American goals and ideals have long been 
a source of inspiration to all people of the world 
who see in the United States a land of opportunity 
and a haven from tyranny where freedom has real 
meaning for the individual. Consistency in the 
championship of human liberty, wherever it is 
sought, is essential to any long-term success in 
strategic planning; inconsistency contains the 
seeds of self-destruction. In itself, this concept 
CONFIDENTIAL 
102 
poses some exceedingly difficult problems in a 
world where force is a constant threat. However, 
simply stated, it means that those responsible for 
national strategy must never lose sight of basic 
national objectives. 
The fourth concept is that the various means 
available to strategy are employed in varying de-
grees at all times to strengthen the master plan of 
one nation while restricting the plans of another. 
The availability of military force is a factor which 
constantly affects the formulation of strategies, 
as is illustrated by the effect of the postwar ac-
tivities of the Soviet Union in Europe and in Asia. 
Diplomacy, which pursues a more peaceful ap-
proach to the solution of world problems, endeav-
ors at all times to win friends and to create condi-
tions favorable to its own objectives. Economic 
power is exerted to strengthen and to destroy. In 
postwar Europe, the United States has used its 
economic resources to restore war-ravaged coun-
tries; while at the same time, in China, it has em-
ployed this power to weaken the Communist con-
trolled government. Similarly, the sociological 
instruments of emotion and culture are being ex-
ploited by opposing forces all over the world, on 
the one hand to build and on the other to tear 
down. In more recent years, science and tech-
nology have become powerful weapons; the atom 
bomb alone has played a significant part in the 
planning of world strategies. 
The essential point of this concept is that war 
and peace are relative terms and that no wise 
strategist can consider them to be mutually exclu-
sive with particular instruments appropriate only 
to one or the other. Such a point of view might 
lead to the sacrifice of long-term objectives for 
short-term advantages. A keen appreciation of 
this concept can immeasurably strengthen a na-
tion's grand strategy by permitting the skillful 
employment of all available instruments in the 
right degree at the proper place and time. 
All of these concepts can be reduced to the sim-
ple fact that strategy must be based on realities, 
and hence requires the availability of all perti-
nent knowledge. The approach to this require-
ment involves: first, a continuous awareness of 
the unknown. factors and an effort to uncover 
them; second, a full appreciation of the known 
factors and their realistic application to the solu-

tion of the many problems of planning; and third, 
the conscientious use of logical reasoning. 
Success in the formulation of strategy is 
achieved when the resultant policies are so inte-
grated with available instruments that war be-
comes either unnecessary or is undertaken with the 
optimum assurance of victory. 
POLICY IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
The net product of grand strategy, which is 
based on national interests and objectives, is called 
"policy"; when that policy concerns relationships 
with foreign countries it is called "foreign policy." 
Obviously policy cannot be established in the best 
interests of a nation without a great deal of care-
ful advance study and planning; thus it represents 
the last step in a nation's strategic planning proc-
ess and gives expression to its master plan. For-
eign policy is that element of the total plan, devel-
oped from experience and knowledge, which aids 
in the conduct of government business with other 
governments. 
In the postwar period there has been a notable 
growth of popular interest in American foreign 
policy, and much has been written on the subject. 
There has been criticism of certain aspects, such 
as the lack of realism, the absence of continuity, 
and excessive improvisation. In his book, The 
Road to Foreign Policy, Hugh Gibson, a long-
time career diplomat, refers to the "Open Door" 
policy in China, "Dollar Diplomacy," and the 
"Monroe Doctrine," among others, as "fragments 
of foreign policy" and suggests that some Ameri-
can foreign policies "can be described not too un-
kindly as hobbies of successive secretaries of 
state." 
From such discussions and criticisms it may be 
concluded that a real need exists for a better un-
derstanding of what foreign policies are, the proc-
esses from which they are derived, and an expres-
sion of the policies themselves in language 
unmistakably clear, with no possibility for mis-
interpretation. Such an understanding is aided 
by a recognition of the fundamental character-
istics and qualities which all policies should have. 
Foreign policies are rooted in the historical 
background of nations; they develop gradually, 
are the result of objective thinking, and have qual-
ities of stability and permanence. They never 
103 
spring suddenly into being and can seldom arise 
out of the emotional excitement of the moment. 
George Washington, in his Farewell Address, was 
encouraging the idea of objectivity when he 
warned against "passionate attachments." In dis-
cussing basic policy in his book, Mr. Gibson com-
ments that, in the light of subsequent events the 
post-World War II policy of the Allies to destroy 
the power of Germany was not a true policy be-
cause it was emotionally conceived and lacked the 
quality of Objectivity. The term "policy" should 
be applied only to something that is fundamental 
and of a long-range nature; it should not be con-
fused with tactical devices used to implement the 
basic plan. The Marshall Plan, for example, has 
been merely a device for implementing a basic 
policy of denying the control of Europe to one 
aggressor nation. However, it gives continuity to 
that policy and should not be misunderstood as 
an improvisation. 
Obviously, a policy is never one-sided; it always 
involves other nations and other peoples who have 
much to do with its effectiveness or ineffectiveness. 
The success of the balance of power policy in 
Europe depends upon the whole-hearted response 
and cooperation of various countries participating 
in the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, and the European Defense Com-
munity. The success of any policy depends also 
on the high caliber of those responsible for its ad-
ministration, their training, experience, and sen-
sitive perception of its many aspects and impli-
cations. The measure of success should never be 
gauged by spectacular immediate results, because 
the results achieved over a period of years are 
often much more significant. Since a policy must 
be judged on a long-term basis as it grows and 
develops, it cannot always be evaluated at a given 
time; rather, the degree of its effectiveness will be 
demonstrated by the manner in which it influences 
subsequent events. 
Since a true basic policy grows out of national 
objectives which are the common interest of all 
groups within a nation, it does not represent a 
partisan point of view. On the other hand, the 
implementing tactics or devices may well origi-
nate from the elected representatives of the people 
in control of the government at a given time. 
Finally, all policies are not of equal importance.

INTELLIGENCE FOR 
The defense of American policy in China, for ex-
ample, would not elicit the same immediate re-
sponse as the defense of our policy to protect the 
Western Hemisphere from aggression. 
A review of common characteristics should lead 
to the conclusion that foreign policies are the re-
sult of long-range planning and that shifting re-
lationships between nations will affect their execu-
tion, so that adaptability is essential to successful 
operation. An understanding of these character-
istics should do much to sharpen the intelligence 
perspective in identifying the broad patterns of 
policy, often obscured by tactical devices which 
are no more than implementations. Even more, 
it becomes apparent that the successful execution 
of policy requires at every step a great amount of 
knowledge and a full appreciation of cause and 
effect relationships. 
While the instruments of policy and strategy are 
the same, it must be reemphasized that they are 
the machinery through which policies operate and 
that their effective use is necessary if any policy 
is to have real meaning or ultimate value. Diplo-
macy and military forces are two basic instruments 
whose significance merits further consideration. 
Diplomacy is not a function limited to the diplo-
matic service. It is carried on through any official 
or unofficial activities which affect foreign rela-
tionships such as: a restrictive tariff act or a gen-
erous foreign aid measure passed by Congress; the 
movements of the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean; 
the behavior of American citizens, military or ci-
vilian, in a foreign capital; formal addresses or 
off-the-cuff remarks by high Government officials. 
It is true that the diplomatic service itself must be 
a highly trained body of devoted men and women 
capable of administering policy wisely in a con-
fused and troubled world. At the same time, pub-
lic opinion has much to do with diplomacy as an 
instrument of policy; the more enlightened it is, 
the more advantageously effective it can be. The 
importance of this instrument is self-evident; its 
failure results inevitably in war. 
Military forces are not only an exceedingly im-
portant instrument of policy, but also affect policy 
directly or indirectly. United States Army oc-
cupation and control in Germany, for example, 
will have an effect on American policies in Europe 
for many years, and likewise our occupation and 
CONFIDENTIAL 
104 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
subsequent retention of military bases in Japan 
have given a definite pattern to American policies 
in the Far East. Close coordination of military 
and political policies, therefore, becomes essential 
to the national interest. To be remembered also 
is the fact that military power as an instrument of 
policy must be adequate to support that policy; 
further, that the knowledge required to determine 
what constitutes adequacy must be supplied by 
an effective intelligence service. 
THE ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE 
Since modern nations can scarcely afford to 
maintain military forces sufficient to meet all even-
tualities, the production of knowledge from which 
to determine adequacy becomes a contribution of 
major consequence. Intelligence can also have 
great value in helping to compensate for certain 
deficiencies in military instruments available to 
carry out strategy and policy. Prior to World 
War II, one of the German military theorists, 
Captain von Gadow, recognized this value in an 
article prepared for Militaerevessenschaftliche 
Rundschau 
We must be far-sighted in our policies. The 
next war will depend on the success or failure 
of the great sea powers. Germany is not and 
cannot become a great sea power. But we 
can protect certain interests by erecting effi-
ciently working outposts which would have to 
fulfill highly important tasks in the sphere of 
naval strategy and may also often play a de-
cisive part in our foreign policy . . . 
In evaluating the military factor, Intelligence 
must inevitably assess the relevant political, eco-
nomic, psychological, moral, and technological 
factors. In so doing, it produces knowledge which 
can be used as the basis for the successful employ-
ment of these additional factors in total war. 
The preceding discussion of the planning of 
strategy and the formulation and execution of 
policy has indicated the quantity and scope of 
knowledge required. It has also suggested in 
general terms the necessary breadth of the intelli-
gence perspective. A review of some of the strat-
egies, policies, and tactical operations of Germany, 
Japan, and the Allied Nations before and during 
World War II and of the Soviet Union after-
wards will more specifically illustrate the vital

role played by Intelligence and the perspective its 
personnel must have in support of that role. Dur-
ing this review it will be well to keep in mind the 
intelligence organizations developed by these na-
tions as described in the latter sections of chap-
ter 2. 
GERMAN STRATEGY BEFORE AND DURING 
WORLD WAR II 
The grand strategies of the Axis powers were 
formulated separately in the 1920's and were im-
plemented and combined in the 1930's. Their 
tenuous roots may be traced to Mussolini's march 
on Rome and his establishment of the first dic-
tatorship; the Japanese fortification of their 
newly acquired Mandated Islands in the Pacific; 
and Hitler's dramatic presentation of himself and 
his scheme for world conquest in Mein Kampf. 
When Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 
1933, Nazism was established as a political and 
military force and secret preparation for war was 
begun. Germany, however, did not take the stra-
tegic offensive in the international arena until 7 
March 1936, when she reoccupied the Rhineland. 
A year earlier Italy had taken the strategic of-
fensive when she moved against helpless Ethiopia. 
By 1936 Hitler had created the "Rome-Berlin 
Axis" and, with Mussolini, had intervened in the 
Spanish Civil War for the purpose of testing new 
weapons and tactics, to say nothing of further 
undermining the stability of that country. By 
1936 he also had evolved and put into action the 
new Nazi strategy, which utilized not only mili-
tary but also economic-political-psychological 
means. Because he held the strategic initiative, 
Hitler was able to a large extent to predict and 
determine the course of events. 
In the period from 1936 to 1940 it became in-
creasingly clear that the grand strategy of the 
Nazi regime was territorial aggrandizement by 
means short of war, and the forging of armed 
might against the day when conflict with major 
powers could no longer be avoided. During this 
period Mussolini played second fiddle to Hitler; 
his ambition was perhaps not so grandiose, and 
certainly his resources were not comparable. He 
basked, however, in the reflected glory of the Nazi 
state as it gradually assumed hegemony over one 
European country after another from 1938 to 1940. 
105 
Hitler's spectacular successes were in large meas-
ure due to his "combined strategy" which adapted 
grand strategy to the purposes of a ruthless dic-
tatorship in which total mobilization could be en-
forced immediately for the waging of total war. 
That the Nazi grand strategy was truly global 
in scale, and was directed, among other objectives, 
at gaining a foothold in Latin America, was rec-
ognized in 1942 by Hugo Fernandez Artucio, who 
wrote in his "The Nazi Underground in South 
America": 
An undeclared war is being waged in Latin 
America today against the democratic insti-
tutions and the independence of the New 
World Republics. The war is being con-
ducted with fearful efficiency by the soldiers 
of the Third German Empire, who have been 
distributed by the thousands throughout the 
political underground of this continent. 
They are the agents of Adolph Hitler, whose 
mission it is to put into practice here, as in 
Holland and Belgium, Czechoslovakia and 
Norway, Austria and France, the principles 
of totalitarian warfare. In this concept of 
war, actual armed invasion becomes merely a 
link in a long chain of underground prepa-
ration . . . 
A political scheme of international implica-
tions has been set afoot on the American con-
tinent . . . Its object is to set up a govern-
ment as nearly like the totalitarian regime 
as possible, and the method employed is "the 
war of nerves." Its creators know, with 
Machiavellian cunning, the political function 
of fear. 
Nazi strategy was ably supported by the world-
wide German Intelligence Service, the concepts of 
which were broadened in order to implement new 
and revolutionary methods of warfare, such as 
the "blitzkrieg," the "war of nerves," and the 
"fifth column." The effectiveness of German In-
telligence in contributing to Nazi strategic pur-
poses in Spain is described by Hansjurgen Koehler 
in his book Inside the Gestapo. The particular 
device used was the Hagenbeck Circus which was 
sent to Spain to roam the countryside for months. 
Gestapo agents were included among the large 
numbers of circus employees. With this excellent 
"cover," these agents had little difficulty in obtain-
ing a great variety of important information. 
This circus also provided a means whereby Nazi 
propaganda could be distributed with little or no

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR 
difficulty. As a result of the Nazi intelligence ef-
fort in Spain, anti-German elements were almost 
completely eliminated, Germans residing in the 
country were enlisted as collaborators, and vital 
strategic data on Spain was collected. 
Tremendous sums of money, estimated at $200,-
000,000 annually, were allocated for intelligence 
purposes, including the creation of fifth columns 
and the conduct of propaganda activities. Such 
expenditures were possible because of the Nazi 
planned economy in Germany, and, from their 
point of view, it was money well spent--except in 
England and the United States. 
Although the ruthless aggressions of the Axis 
powers were in open defiance of existing treaties 
and international law, the western democracies 
were impotent, and could only helplessly observe 
the progress of events. For some time Hitler was 
not taken seriously, certainly not by Ramsay Mac-
Donald and Stanley Baldwin, although as early 
as 1934, Winston Churchill had begun to issue 
solemn warnings of the new peril which was 
taking shape beyond the Rhine. Thus England 
remained on the strategic defensive, and Neville 
Chamberlain's policy of appeasement did not im-
prove the situation. England was not alone, how-
ever, for the other democracies shared this 
unfavorable position. 
One problem was that England and France were 
getting very little intelligence out of Germany, 
because it was a part of the Nazi strategy to infest 
the homeland with armies of counterspies, to pun-
ish betrayal of military or industrial secrets by 
well-publicized beheading, and to employ torture 
and execution to stamp out disaffection whenever 
and wherever detected. But a greater problem 
was lethargy in the British Government and cor-
ruption in the Government of France which pre-
vented the right kind of action from being taken 
in response to such intelligence as was received 
regarding the German rearmament. 
As can be seen, the advantage of strategic ini-
tiative, and hence the advantage of surprise, lay 
with the totalitarian states dedicated to world 
conquest. Innumerable acts of aggression, almost 
imperceptible at their inception and fully identi-
fied only after they were accomplished facts, were 
carried out in times of ostensible peace by scores of 
fanatical and capable agents. Powerful nations

were lulled by skillful propaganda into a false 
sense of security; while others, less powerful, were 
threatened, coerced, and attacked. The Axis 
powers sought to change the existing world situa-
tion to one more favorable to themselves and, up 
to a certain point, each succeeded remarkably well. 
Failures in German Strategy 
The period up to and including the fall of 
France was characterized by brilliant Nazi suc-
cesses; thereafter, when Hitler was forced into 
war with both England and the United States 
while still embroiled on the continent of Europe, 
Nazi blunders were the order of the day. Of par-
ticular interest are the failures in strategy which 
led to failures on the field of battle and on the 
diplomatic front. The publication of war his-
tories, memoirs of key political and military fig-
ures, the texts of hitherto top secret international 
agreements, and "post-mortems" obtained through 
the interrogation of high-ranking prisoners of 
war, all shed light on different facets of German 
planning and strategy. The "post-mortems" are 
very illuminating although compensation must be 
made for personal bias. 
There is evidence that no war with England or 
the United States was contemplated by the Ger-
man High Command during the period of initial 
Nazi successes. An essay by Admirals Schniewind 
and Schuster includes this statement: 
A war on such a tremendous scale?or even 
with England?was in 1939 quite beyond the 
range of the preparations and intentions of 
the Government. But the policy of the Gov-
ernment and its political negotiations did not 
make any provision for this idea, as subse-
quent developments showed. They completely 
failed to realize the determination on the part 
of those who were later to become her enemies 
to declare war in the event that Germany car-
ried out any further activities similar to the 
occupation of Austria, Sudetenland, or Czech-
oslovakia. Germany, her armed forces and 
especially her navy, were thereafter taken un-
aware and had to enter the war inadequately 
equipped. 
Additional evidence is found in an article by Vice 
Admiral Hellmuth Heye, entitled, "From Panzer-
schiffe to E-Boats :"

tance from the naval point of view. The re-

AN INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE IN A CHANGING WORLD CONFIDENTIAL 
lease of Germany from the Versailles Treaty 
. . . was . . . a hopeful development. Ad-
miral Raeder, in common with all the best 
naval opinion, held the view that the war of 
1914-18 was lost as a result of Anglo-Ameri-
can sea power. The land decision was only a 
result of Anglo-American superiority at sea. 
The Navy therefore held the view that the 
waging of modern warfare is only possible, 
especially in the air age, when there is no de-
termining enemy superiority at sea. Natu-
rally all the necessary conditions appertaining 
to the use of the sea in an essentially conti-
nental country like Germany were difficult 
to achieve. From the to downward all im-
portant offices in the Ministry of War and in 
the air arm were occupied by persons who 
were essentially land-trained. The Navy 
found it impossible to introduce qualified of-
ficers into either the Air Ministry or the War 
Ministry. 
Naturally this state of affairs could not but 
have an influence on the decision taken on all 
questions connected with the sea and sea war-
fare. Nevertheless, every effort was made on 
the highest level to avoid under all circum-
stances hostilities with England. This hope, 
as I see it, remained up to the very day of the 
declaration of war by England. There is no 
better evidence on this than the fact that until 
close up to the outbreak of war, I believe 1938, 
the Navy was expressly forbidden to study or 
consider the problems presented by a war with 
England. 
This almost incredible failure in German basic 
planning was to have costly results in 1940 when 
the opportunity arose to invade the long-invulner-
able British Isles. Detailed plans for Operation 
Sealion had been prepared and were ready to be 
put into effect, but Nazi strategy had failed to 
foresee and prepare for this opportunity, and Ger-
many lacked the necessary landing craft and other 
naval units to carry out an invasion. Air power 
and land armies had been highly developed while 
sea power had been neglected. This crucial error 
in strategy seems to have resulted in part from a 
failure of German Intelligence to predict in ad-
vance the psychological factors which would make 
England a belligerent. Even this error might 
have been counterbalanced by a skillful diplomatic 
effort directed toward gaining and preserving an 
attitude of neutrality in England, but the Nazis 
lacked this capability and Hitler's personal short-
comings were reflected in the conduct of his 
foreign policy. 
The first major error in strategy involved Hitler 
in a land war and a sea war simultaneously and 
prevented him from mounting an invasion of Eng-
land in her weakest hour. A second, equally se-
rious, resulted in an all-out offensive against the 
U. S. S. R. in the winter of 1941-42. The land 
war now had to be fought on two widely separated 
fronts, a situation particularly dreaded by the 
members of the German General Staff. From the 
very first, Hitler underestimated Soviet strength 
and miscalculated Soviet intentions. Interesting 
comments on these failures in strategy were made 
by Colonel Gottschling, Chief of Staff of the Ger-
man Air Staff in Italy, during interrogation: 
Hitler's "idee fixe" was to wage war against 
Russia. The failure to invade Great Britain, 
the ever-increasing amount of aircraft Britain 
was receiving from the United States and 
Germany's ever-increasing number of aircraft 
losses served to spur Hitler on and in his ob-
session drove him to attack Russia. 
Luftwaffe fighter and bomber units needed 
in western Europe were dispatched to Bul-
garia, Rumania, etc. FIitler overruled every 
objection of the General Staff with his gift 
of persuasion. . . . 
I would summarize Germany's war mistakes 
as follows: 
a. Overestimation of England's ability to 
resist invasion. 
b. Underestimation of Russia. 
c. Overestimation of Germany' s allies, 
such as Italy. 
d. Our failure to treat France as an equal 
and obtain full use of the wealth and 
resources of the French colonial em-
pire. This could have been a stepping 
stone for the invasion of Great Britain. 
e. Declaring war on America. The High 
Command should and must have 
known that America's entry into the 
war meant Germany's defeat. 
?Defeat, Headquarters Army Air Forces,

A theme which reappears time and again in the 
various "post-mortems" is the disastrous result of 
Hitler's personal and complete control over Ger-
man grand strategy, particularly after the war 
began. Colonel Gottschling stated:

I have seen the most brilliant and deter-
mined men of my acquaintance go before Hit-
ler, determined not to acquiesce to his whims. 
These brainy and critical men returned fasci-
nated and for weeks remained under the spell 
of Hitler's charms or hypnosis. Thus, Hit-
ler exercised his influence on his General Staff. 
Vice Admiral Heye is quoted again in this 
connection: 
During the preparations for the operations 
in Norway I was only once present at a con-
ference with Adolf Hitler. In the course of 
this he emphasized the importance of the oc-
cupation of Norway for the whole conduct of 
the war and said he was the only man who 
could assume responsibility for such an opera-
tion. In the course of the war, as is well-
known, he on many occasions acted against the 
advice of his military chiefs and sometimes 
he met with successes. This fact may have 
caused him and many officers to regard him 
not only as a statesman but also as a superior 
general in the field. His intervention in mil-
itary operations grew at all events noticeably 
more pronounced. 
The German High Command progressively lost its 
freedom to reach military decisions of a strategic 
nature; more and more these were made by Hit-
ler himself on the basis of "intuition." It would 
appear that the major errors already listed, and 
some of their far-reaching consequences, might 
have been avoided if Hitler had been persuaded 
from exercising complete control over German 
grand strategy, and if more comprehensive and 
more accurate intelligence had been available to 
the High Command. Fortunately for the Allies, 
much of the information collected by the Nazis 
was unreliable and inadequately processed; even 
more, either the resulting intelligence was not 
disseminated to those who needed to know, or, if 
disseminated, was not used. Strategy, when for-
mulated by one individual on the basis of intui-
tion rather than fact, cannot fail to reflect not 
only the brilliance but also the faults of that in-
dividual. Further, when faulty intelligence is in-
volved, the errors are compounded and magnified. 
Other errors in German strategy included the 
failure to bring Spain into the Axis camp, a lack 
of appreciation for the advantages of joint opera-
tions in battle, and miscalculation of the enemy's 
total industrial capacity. Regarding the latter 
two, General von Senger was most outspoken i

The General Staff failed to understand the 
modern idea of warfare. It still thought in 
terms of Nineteenth century land battles, 
whereas we should have had a combined staff 
like Italy. Our General Staff was primarily 
occupied with army strategy rather than co-
ordination with the navy and air force. . . . 
The tragedy of the General Staff is historical 
rather than military. It saw its enemy in the 
Allied field soldier?whereas the real enemy 
was Allied industrial capacity far beyond the 
front, out of reach of bombs or the range of 
artillery. 
?Defeat, Headquarters Army Air Forces, 
July 1945. 
The turning of the tide against the Germans is 
generally agreed to have occurred in the fall of 
1942 when the Allies landed in North Africa and 
went on to defeat Rommel and to invade Italy. 
The Allied advantage lay in the important ele-
ment of surprise, not only in tactics, but also in 
the employment of many new types of landing 
craft and weapons. Initial military success led 
to a major political triumph, the fall of Mussolini. 
The way lay open to the "soft underbelly of Eu-
rope," but the Allied strategic initiative in the 
Mediterranean theater, except for long-range 
bombing of the Rumanian oil fields, dwindled in 
the face of stubborn German resistance and diffi-
cult terrain. Elsewhere in Europe, however, the 
success of air operations from bases in England, 
and the advance of Soviet armies following the 
defense of Stalingrad, gave the Allies the strate-
gic initiative on both western and eastern fronts. 
Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, the strategic offen-
sive maintained by Nazi submarine warfare was 
reduced to the defensive, and as the situation 
became more desperate it should have been ap-
parent to Hitler that victory was beyond his grasp. 
The landing in Normandy, the devastating sweep 
through France, and the junction with Soviet 
forces in Berlin were but the final stages of suc-
cessful Allied grand strategy in Europe. 
Japanese Strategy Before and During World War II 
Japan took the strategic initiative on the main-
land of Asia on 18 September 1931 when she ar-
ranged the Mukden Incident as a pretext for the 
invasion of Manchuria. Thereafter, she became 
deeply involved in a land war in China. How-
ever, unlike Hitler, who initially at least had a

AN INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE IN A CHANGING WORLD CONFIDENTIAL 
healthy respect for the military and industrial 
potential of the United States, the Japanese com-
pletely underestimated America's war-making 
capability and deliberately provoked a conflict. 
The attack on Pearl Harbor exploited surprise, 
the range of carrier task forces, and the power of 
aircraft to sink surface vessels. Not only did it 
surprise the United States but also Nazi Germany, 
for it now appeared that Japan was determined to 
fight her own war independently, without more 
than a perfunctory liaison with the Third Reich. 
Thus an early failure of the combined strategy 
of the Axis powers was the lack of effective coor-
dination?a problem which continuously plagued 
the German High Command. 
The final decision of Japan to make war, 
reached with the full concurrence and active con-
sent of Japanese military and civilian leaders, was 
based upon the following evaluation which is very 
well presented in the Summary Report (Pacific 
War), published by the United States Strategic 
Bombing Survey: 
a. The threat of Russia on the Manchurian 
flank had been neutralized by the decisive 
victories of Germany in Europe which might 
eventually lead to the complete collapse of the 
Soviet Union. 
b. Great Britain was in such an irretriev-
ably defensive position that, even if she sur-
vived, her entire war-making potential would 
be spent in a desperate attempt to protect her 
home islands. 
c. The forces which the United States and 
her Allies could immediately deploy in the 
Pacific, particularly in the air, were insuffi-
cient to prevent the fully trained and mobil-
ized forces of Japan from occupying within 
3 or 4 months the entire area enclosed within 
a perimeter consisting of Burma, Sumatra, 
Java northern New Guinea, the Bismarck 
Archipelago, the Gilbert and Marshall 
Islands, Wake, and from there north to the 
Kuriles. 
d. China, with the Burma Road severed, 
would be isolated and forced to negotiate. 
e. The United States_, committed to aiding 
Great Britain, and weakened by the attack on 
Pearl Harbor, would be unable to mobilize 
sufficient strength to go on the offensive for 
18 months to 2 years. During this time, the 
perimeter could be fortified and the required 
forward air fields and bases established.. So 
strengthened, this perimeter would be backed 
by a mobile carrier striking force based on 
Truk. 
f. While the stubborn defense of the cap-
tured perimeter was undermining American 
determination to support the war, the Jap-
anese would speedily extract bauxite, oil, rub-
ber, and metals from Malaya, Burma, the 
Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, and 
ship these materials to Japan for processing, 
to. sustain and strengthen her industrial and 
military machine. 
g. The weakness of the United States as a 
democracy would make it impossible for her 
to continue all-out offensive action in the face 
of the losses which would be imposed by fa-
natically resisting Japanese soldiers, sailors, 
and airmen, and the elimination of its Allies. 
The United States in consequence would com-
promise and allow Japan to retain a substan-
tial portion of her initial territorial gains. 
Most of this evaluation was incorrect, because it 
was based on faulty intelligence. 
At the very outset of the Pacific War, therefore, 
the seeds for Japan's eventual defeat were sown. 
She was unable to comprehend or to predict those 
psychological and moral factors which bolstered 
the Allied cause in a time of severe trial and mis-
fortune. Since the Japanese concept of the state 
involved ruthless tyranny and the complete sub-
jugation of the individual, she was also unable to 
appreciate the power potential of the Allies in 
obtaining a supreme voluntary effort from the in-
dividual, whether on the field of battle or on the 
production front. Individual response to a noble 
cause is one of the great strengths of a democ-
racy. Before a democracy fights, however, the 
enemy has usually gained the strategic offensive. 
The magnitude of their early successes at Pearl 
Harbor, in Malaya, in the Philippines, and at 
Wake, Guam, and Rabaul, encouraged the Japa-
nese to commit an outstanding error in grand 
strategy?expansion beyond the perimeter origi-
nally planned. The nature of this new plan and 
its inherent weaknesses are also described in the 
Summary Report (Pacific War) : 
Accordingly, a new plan was approved, pro-
viding for (a) an advance into the Solomons 
and Port Moresby., to be followed, if success-
ful, by a further advance into New Caledonia, 
Samoa, and the Fiji Islands; (b) the capture 
of Midway; and (c) the temporary occupa-
tion of the Aleutians. Accomplishment of 
such a program would cut the line of com-

munication between Australia and the United 
States, reduce the threat from Alaska, and 
deny the United States all major staging areas 
more advanced than Pearl Harbor. 
By stretching and overextending her line of 
advance, Japan was committed to an expen-
sive and exacting supply problem. She de-
layed the fortification of the perimeter origi-
nally decided upon, jeopardized her economic 
program for exploiting the resources of the 
area already captured, and laid herself open 
to early counterattack in far advanced and, 
as yet, weak positions. 
It should be pointed out, however, that this new 
plan was partially successful; for example, sig-
nificant strategic gains were achieved by the tem-
porary occupation of Kiska in the Aleutians. The 
United States was immediately placed on the de-
fensive in an area from which it had planned to 
take the offensive. The Japanese action denied to 
the United States Fleet advance bases for opera-
tions in the northwest Pacific and the Bering Sea, 
from which aerial reconnaissance could be main-
tained over the northernmost Japanese Islands. 
Furthermore, it was a threat to the shipping routes 
between the west coast of the United States and 
the east coast of Siberia; it endangered sealing 
and fishing in the Bering Sea, and imperilled the 
northwestern area of Alaska. The influence of 
Japanese technical intelligence on this decision to 
move into the Aleutians is indicated by the fol-
lowing quotation from the United States Strategic 
Bombing Survey (Pacific) : 
In Commander Hashimoto's opinion the 
Japanese move into the Aleutians was con-
ceived as a flanking operation to the occupa-
tion of Midway. Once Kiska and Attu were 
occupied it was decided to hold them for the 
purpose of blocking a United States amphibi-
ous advance toward the Empire via the Aleu-
tian Chain, and also to deny the use of the 
western Aleutians as bases from which long-
range bombers might operate. He said that 
the Japanese were aware in the latter part of 
1942 that the United States had plans for a 
high altitude, long-range bomber, and, in 
about February 1943, had information con-
cerning the B-29. This information was later 
confirmed in a radio broadcast by an Ameri-
can general. He went on to say that the 
B-29 appeared in operation 8 months later 
than the Japanese had estimated it might ap-
pear. When Attu was re-taken by the United

States, the Japanese expected long-range 
bomber operations from Massacre Bay. 
?Interrogations of J a p anese Officials

The operation launched against Midway, also 
a part of this new plan, was far from successful. 
In fact, in the words of Captain Tsuda : 
The Battle of Midway was the beginning of 
the Japanese failure in the war, I do not mean 
that this was the decisive battle of the war, 
but the loss of our carriers and some of our 
best pilots and officers affected us throughout 
the war. It called for the reorganization of 
the carrier divisions and the Naval Air Force 
in general. Due to the loss of ships we were 
unable to meet the Americans in force in the 
Solomons.

The explanation for this fatal error to expand 
the original perimeter may be found in the com-
ments of Admiral Toyada, one of her top naval 
leaders: 
I think the decision to expand the area of 
operations so widely might be attributed to a 
feeling on the part of the Japanese authorities 
at the time that the state of mind under which 
you fought the war and the state of mind 
under which we fought the war were very 
different, in that to us this was the war for our 
very national existence, whereas in your case 
it was merely a case of national honor or per-
haps protection of your economic interests in 
the Far East; and, because to you the war 
under such conditions would be of relatively 
slight significance compared with ours, there 
might have been a feeling on the part of our 
leaders that, should the war continue a little 
longer, you would lose your will to fight, and 
with that idea we might have continued 
spreading the battleline.

If this explanation can be accepted as authorita-

psychology of the American people. Here again 
inaccurate intelligence had repercussions of the

Although the United States had early been 
placed on the strategic defensive, by the end of 
1942 precarious footholds had been consolidated 
and reinforced in the southwest Pacific, thus up-
setting the enemy's strategic plan. The Battle of 
Midway dealt a heavy blow to the Imperial Fleet, 
and the strategic initiative passed to the American 
forces. Thereafter, having ousted the Japanese 
from Attu and Kiska, the north Pacific units were 
employed as a holding and diversionary force, 
while the major Allied attacks were carried out 
by carrier task force raids, amphibious operations, 
and strategic long-range bombing always aimed 
at the final target, the Japanese home islands. 
ALLIED STRATEGY BEFORE AND DURING WORLD 
WAR II 
Allied strategy in its entirety during this par-
ticular period serves to illustrate two points: the 
tremendous ultimate value in coordinating the 
strategies of allied nations; and the long term 
effectiveness of strategy formulated in times of 
peace as well as war. 
As has been mentioned, the grand strategy of 
the Axis was sharply divided, so that effective 
concentration of power against major objectives 
was never possible. On the other hand, the war 
effort of Great Britain and the United States was 
most closely coordinated. Varying degrees of co-
ordination were achieved from time to time with 
the U. S. S. R., and with other Allied nations. 
Perhaps the outstanding feature of Allied grand 
strategy was the early implementation of the prin-
ciple of combined British and American conduct 
of the war. Gen. George C. Marshall has com-
mented on this feature as follows: 
On December 23, 1941, Winston Churchill, 
Prime Minister of Great Britain, accompanied 
by the British Chiefs of Staff, arrived in 
Washington to confer with the President and 
the American Chiefs of Staff. Out of the 
series of discussions which then followed re-
sulted an agreement, not only regarding the 
immediate strategy of our combined conduct 
of the war, but also for the organization of a 
method for the strategical command and con-
trol of British and American military re-
sources. Probably no other Allied action, in 
the field or otherwise, has exerted as power-
ful an effect on the conduct of the war as the 
prompt establishment of a prescribed pro-
cedure for achieving unit of effort through 
the medium of the Combined Chiefs of Staff 
acting under the direction of the leaders of 
their respective Governments. 
?Biennial Report of the Chief of Staff of the 
United States Army, July 1, 1939 to June 
30, 1941. 
The pooling of resources and ideas generated a 
total power which swept the Axis countries into 
defeat. This concentration of power also included 
the use of Army, Navy, and Marine Corps in 
joint operations, especially in the Pacific. Joint 
and combined intelligence activities contributed 
substantially to strategic planning. For example, 
the results of British experiments in photographic 
interpretation were made available to the United 
States, while air intelligence methods, and operat-
ing procedures aboard United States carriers were 
provided the British Fleet through special train-
ing and liaison arrangements. This mutual ex-
change at many echelons was invaluable to the 
combined allied strategy. 
It has already been suggested that grana strat-
egy is conducted in time of ostensible peace as well 
as in wartime. This is well illustrated by the fact 
that the United States began to cooperate with 
Great Britain in her war effort more than 3 years 
before Pearl Harbor, and was actually at war with 
Germany long before formal declarations were 
made. Arrangements for the exchange of de-
stroyers for bases under 99-year lease agreements, 
the convoying of merchant shipping, and the 
American Lend-Lease program were all early in-
dications of combined strategy and military 
planning. 
NATIONAL STRATEGIES IN THE POSTWAR 
PERIOD 
The events of the postwar period, which have 
their roots in past decades, will continue to influ-
ence the events of the future. The fate of the 
world, or of civilization as it is now known, con-
tinues to hang in the balance, years after the termi-
nation of World War II. Former enemies and 
former allies have united into new combinations 
in peacetime, striving to achieve their objectives. 
New strategies are being implemented and new 
pressures applied in support of them.

the world, and the crises caused by many diver-
gent often delicate situations, tend to obscure a 
clear view of national strategies. However, it is 
apparent that a dominant influence upon them has 
been the fact that only two nations emerged from 
the war with the full stature of major powers--
the United States and the U. S. S. R. It is neither 
possible nor practicable to consider current events 
in detail, or to speculate on developments in the 
immediate future, but there are indications now 
which shed light on the postwar strategies of 
these major powers. 
United States Strategy 
In his book, The Price of Power, Hanson W. 
Baldwin presents an interesting discussion of 
United States strategy. His thesis is that in con-
tinuing to strive for the fulfillment of her objec-
tives in support of democracy and a just and last-
ing peace for the world, the United States aims to 
preserve the political integrity of the "fringe-
lands" of Europe and Asia in order to prevent 
the extension of Communist influence either to the 
Atlantic in Europe or to the East and South China 
Seas in Asia. This implies the restoration of a 
balance of power. There are, of course, many 
subsidiary aspects to this strategic purpose. Bald-
win goes on to describe the United States as "home 
base" for operations with additional advanced and 
intermediate bases, both fixed and mobile, required 
because of the limitations of even the latest weap-
ons of warfare. Okinawa is illustrative of a fixed 
base, while the United States Navy provides stra-
tegic mobile bases. Such a system of widely dis-
persed military bases becomes fundamental to 
strategic planning. Of equal importance is the 
development of "positions-in-readiness," that is, 
friendly and allied countries who can contribute 
to strategic purposes, both military and political. 
The necessity for advance military bases was dis-
cussed by Colonel Clifford J. Heflin in the Air 
University Quarterly, Fall 1947: 
The idea of operating from home bases, 
without the burden of establishing and main-
taining advanced and intermediate bases, 
would be welcomed by every Air Force officer, 
if it could be realized without paying too pro-
hibitive a price. From the inherent character-
istics of the airplane as developed during the 
last 40 years, however, it appears probable 
CONFIDENTIAL 
112 
that the price of such a method of operating 
will continue to be extremely high in the meas-
urable future. Even if aircraft had attained 
the range necessary to launch bombing at-
tacks from a distance of 6,000 to 8,000 miles, 
it would be likely to remain much more eco-
nomical in materiel, and therefore more effi-
cient, to operate from nearer bases, wherever 
they could be obtained . . . 
If the coastal areas of Europe and Asia are of 
most importance in United States strategic plan-
ning, then the significance of both sea and air 
power, becomes readily apparent. The Atlantic 
and Pacific Oceans are American sea frontiers 
which must be protected, for only across them can 
the United States exert its strength, whether it be 
military, economic, or cultural. Strategic air 
power is expressed by planes, both land and car-
rier based, capable of transporting atomic weap-
ons. Logistic superiority involves not only the 
American industrial system, but also the capacity 
of the United States and her allies to move their 
products throughout the world by means of su-
perior sea power and merchant marine. Other 
aspects of United States strategic planning may 
well include an ideological offensive and a highly 
mobile military force capable of almost immediate 
retaliation against any aggressive action. 
The Strategy of the Soviet Union 
In his book, The Strange Alliance, John R. 
Deane, formerly a Brigadier General in charge of 
the United States Military Mission to the 
U. S. S. R., says: 
In my opinion there can no longer be any 
doubt that the Soviet leadership has always 
been motivated by the belief that communism 
and capitalism cannot coexist. Nor is there 
any doubt in my mind that present-day Soviet 
leaders have determined upon a program 
pointed toward imposing communism on those 
countries under their control, and, elsewhere, 
creating conditions favorable to the triumph 
of communism in the war against capitalism 
which they consider to be inevitable . . . 
The program of the Soviet leaders is being 
carried out with equal aggressiveness in two 
ways: First, by the introduction and compul-
sory acceptance of communism in those coun-
tries which the Soviet Union controls either 
by force or by the threat of force; and second, 
by the infiltration of Communist ideology into

those countries which, for the moment, are 
beyond the orbit of Soviet control. In be-
tween are some nations that are subject both 
to Soviet threat of force and ideological in-
filtration. Among these are Greece, Turkey, 
Iraq, and to some extent China. It is safe to 
predict that these countries will be subjected 
to a war of nerves which they will be able to 
resist only by the firm support of the western 
democracies . . . The program of infiltration 
is world-wide. It is evident throughout Latin 
America, Canada, the British Empire, Asia, 
and not least?the United States. 
In attempting to achieve world domination the 
Soviet Union aims to exert pressures in many areas 
by many means in order to extend her political 
influence and to weaken her adversaries by causing 
them to overextend and to dissipate their strength 
and power. Subsidiary elements of her strategic 
planning include substantial military forces in 
being, the threat of attack with atomic weapons, 
propaganda and subversion. 
In propaganda and subversion the Soviets have 
been highly successful. Their strategic purposes 
have been well served by the widespread employ-
ment of radio broadcasts to disseminate the com-
munist point of view and to vilify the western 
democracies. The Nazi techniques of the "war of 
nerves" and the "fifth column" have been most 
effectively employed. Intensive effort has been 
directed toward the development of new weapons 
and electronic equipment, the large scale produc-
tion of interceptor and long-range aircraft, and 
the expansion of a submarine fleet. 
In attempting to combat the logistic superiority 
of the democracies, the Soviets have concentrated 
the production of their heavy industry on arma-
ments. In addition, it is of vital interest to the 
U. S. S. R. to prevent the translation of Ameri-
ca's tremendous war potential into actual strength. 
The tortuous course of the Soviet "peace" offen-
sive seems to be directed toward this end. A po-
tentially much more dangerous approach has been 
the suggestion of the availability of the Russian 
market for the sale of the products of foreign 
industry: a proposition particularly attractive to 
the business interests of the western democracies 
beset by economic problems and the urgent need 
for expanding foreign trade. 
CTIVE IN A CHANGING WORLD CONFIDENTIAL 
The Atomic Bomb 
The successful adaptation of the principle of 
nuclear fission to war purposes has had a marked 
effect on national strategies in the postwar period. 
Just how marked the effect has been is a matter 
of personal opinion. Some writers have felt that 
the initial possession of the atomic bomb gave to 
the United States a dominant world power posi-
tion. Winston Churchill, speaking before a Tory 
party conference in Wales in 1948, solemnly 
observed: 
It is my belief?and I say it with deep sor-
row?that . . . the only sure foundation of 
peace and of the prevention of actual war rests 
upon strength. If it were not for the stocks 
of atomic bombs now in the trusteeship of the 
United States, there would be no means of 
stopping the subjugation of Western Europe 
. . . If the United States were to consent, in 
reliance upon any paper agreement, to destroy 
the stocks of atomic bombs . . . they would 
be guilty of murdering human freedom . . . 
In connection with the development of an atomic 
bomb, the strategic initiative was first held by 
Germany. It was the knowledge that the Nazis 
were engaged in intensive atomic research that 
prompted the United States to undertake its own 
program and to expend nearly $2,000,000,000 in 
order to gain the strategic initiative in atomic 
power. Secretary of War Stimson considered the 
success of this program to be a great historical 
achievement attained through the integrated ef-
forts of scientists, industrialists, labor, and mili-
tary personnel. The fact that the United States 
alone possessed the atomic bomb was a great, if 
temporary, advantage and undoubtedly influenced 
strategic planning. 
The announcement in September 1949 that there 
was evidence of a recent atomic explosion within 
the U. S. S. R. and subsequent similar announce-
ments in 1951 have had a profound effect on na-
tional strategies and no longer does the United 
States have its unique power advantage. The part 
played by Soviet Intelligence in bringing about 
this change has been described in chapter 2. 
However, the development of tactical atomic 
weapons for offensive use in war makes the concen-
tration of military forces or supplies extremely 
hazardous, and what was once a capability be-

comes a vulnerability. Thus, the Soviet capabil-
ity to mass large military forces is not now as 
significant strategically as it was prior to 1952. 
On the other hand, Soviet progress in the harness-
ing of atomic energy has been much more rapid 
than was expected and, even if the United States 
maintains its production lead, the time might 
come when the Soviet Union would have enough 
atomic weapons for an attempted knock-out blow 
against American industry. 
Progress in the development of the hydrogen 
bomb represents a new factor in strategic plan-
ning, as do other scientific projects in related fields. 
As a result, the most detailed knowledge possible 
regarding scientific activities in the atomic age 
becomes a matter of great importance to grand 
strategy and represents a grave responsibility for 
intelligence. 
Indications of Strategies in the Postwar Period 
After 1945, disturbing reports from Soviet zones 
.of occupation revealed that these areas were being 
drawn into the Soviet orbit along the typical lines 
of Communist-operated countries. The guaran-
tees of free elections in the Balkan countries and 
the promise of the ultimate unification of Korea 
were brushed aside. Red Army garrisons were re-
duced or withdrawn only after communist dom-
ination and control of the various coalition 
governments were assured. 
The drive for extension of Soviet influence into 
the eastern Mediterranean, a centuries-old Russian 
objective, was renewed in several indirect ways. 
Occupation forces in Iran were withdrawn only 
in the face of stern threats of action by the United 
Nations. The Soviet Foreign Minister advanced 
the proposal of Soviet trusteeship of the former 
Italian colony of Libya. Pressure was exerted on 
Turkey to agree to joint control of the Turkish 
Straits, and Communist guerrilla activities were 
intensified in Greece, weakened by the Nazi occu-
pation, internal dissension, and admitted British 
inability to provide a stabilizing influence. Amer-
ican planes, lost over Yugoslavia, were shot down. 
It was apparent that Soviet strategy aimed at the 
exploitation of political and military weaknesses 
whenever and wherever they could be found. 
In the light of Soviet intransigence and double-
dealing on many major issues throughout the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
114 
world, the United States evaluation of this situa-
tion was that Soviet domination in the eastern 
Mediterranean would threaten the independence 
of other states in the Middle East, vital supply 
routes through the Suez Canal, and important 
sources of oil upon which the United States Navy 
depends for a sizable proportion of its fuel sup-
ply. Accordingly, as a counterstrategic move, the 
Truman Plan was promulgated to provide mili-
tary and economic aid to Turkey and Greece. The 
strategic aspects of this plan were summarized 
by Walter Lippmann in March 1947: 
The reason for intervening in Greece and 
Turkey is that of all places in the world they 
are the best suited strategically for the em-
ployment of American military power to 
check the expansion of Soviet military power. 
The power of the Soviet Union is in its inex-
haustible reserves of infantry capable of 
pressing upon its wide land frontiers in Eu-
rope and Asia. There is no other power or 
group of powers capable of mobilizing the 
troops to hold, much less push back, the 
masses of the Red Army on land. The power 
of the United States is on the sea and in the 
air. This kind of power can be exerted to 
check the Red Army only if it can be brought 
within striking distance of the vital centers of 
the Soviet Union. 
The obvious and unique strategic approach, 
as all history proves and the Russians are 
most keenly aware, is across the Black Sea 
to the Ukraine and the Caucasus. The en-
trance to the Black Sea is in the eastern Med-
iterranean through the Aegean Sea and the 
Dardanelles, that is to say between Greece and 
Turkey . . . 
Insofar as we are able to exert American 
sea and air power in the Black Sea, we have 
the means of checking the advance of the Red 
Army westward into Europe. We are on its 
flank and in its rear, and we are able to main-
tain a balance of power, without which serious 
diplomatic negotiation is impossible. 
Since the sea and air power of the United States 
Navy is intimately associated with the strategic 
situation in the Mediterranean, it follows that 
Naval Intelligence can and must make a signifi-
cant contribution to strategic planning. 
American success in Greece, strengthened rela-
tionships with Turkey, and the deviation of Tito 
from the Moscow orbit have all combined to serve 
the strategic purposes of the United States. How-
ever, it should be pointed out that there is still

AN INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE IN A CHANGING WORLD CONFIDENTIAL 
little room for complacency or undue optimism. 
The oil supply was cut off from Iran in 1951 and 
the unstable government of that country is seri-
ously threatened by Soviet subversive efforts; 
while, at the same time, the nationalistic aspira-
tions and racial prejudices of the Arab peoples 
throughout the Mediterranean basin are being ex-
ploited as a means of weakening the position of 
the United States, Great Britain, and France in 
that area. This development has been particu-
larly serious in that it poses a threat to the chain 
of United States strategic air bases located along 
the North African coast. In the fall of 1952, the 
purging of presumably dissident elements in 
Czechoslovakia appeared to be serving the double 
purpose of stabilizing Communist control in that 
country and appealing to the anti-semitic preju-
dices of the Arab world. In view of the general 
unrest, the United States Gth Fleet has played a 
major strategic role in the Mediterranean, show-
ing its flag in ports from Trieste to Istanbul, thus 
bolstering local confidence and deterring overt 
Soviet action. 
The Soviet land blockade of Berlin in 1948-49 
represented a major test of strength. Although 
the airlift was very costly to the western democ-
racies, its strategic significance was tremendous. 
In the first place, it showed that the United States 
was not ready to be driven out of Germany; and, 
even more important, it strengthened the will of 
the Germans and other peoples of western Europe 
to resist Soviet aggression. Economic support to 
the anti-Communist nations of western Europe 
further aided United States interests, while influ-
ence was effectively applied in support of anti-
Communist political parties in a series of crucial 
national elections in France and Italy. 
In Asia, Communist control was gradually ex-
tended over all of China, with the exception of a 
few offshore islands and Formosa. Even inacces-
sible Tibet fell under the domination of the Com-
munist government in Peking, thus posing a po-
tential threat to India. The control of China, 
plus that of Sakhalin and the Kuriles, gave the 
Soviet Union the strategic initiative in Asia. Not 
only did it make possible the application of strong 
pressures on the large resident Chinese popula-
tion in many areas of the Far East, but it also pro-
vided a strategic support base for guerrilla war-
115 
fare and Communist encouraged nationalist re-
volts in Indo-China, Malaya, Burma, and Indo-
nesia. The strategic position of the United States 
in the Philippines, Okinawa, and Japan was im-
mediately threatened. If Soviet influence were 
extended to Southeast Asia and the Persian Gulf 
area, India and Pakistan would be in a very pre-
carious position. 
Faced with mounting commitments all over the 
world and with Soviet pressures exerted at many 
points from one extreme of the Eurasian continent 
to the other, the United States did not have ade-
quate military or political strength to support its 
commitments fully or summarily resist all pres-
sures. In Japan, for example, in June 1950, there 
were only four inexperienced American divisions, 
all understrength, engaged primarily in routine 
occupation duties. When the military blow was 
finally struck in Korea, the United States was un-
prepared to support the political integrity of that 
country. However, its strategic significance re-
sulted in action by the United Nations. 
The Korean war, from the strategic point of 
view, has indicated on the one hand that World 
Communism will resort to military force to 
achieve its objectives when other means prove un-
successful. On the other hand, it has shown that 
the United States will employ the most vigorous 
defensive measures to halt Soviet penetration and 
control of the coastal littorals of Asia. An exten-
sive rearmament program has been initiated in an 
effort to attain military strength consonant with 
world commitments and adequate to deter the mil-
itary power which the Soviets have maintained 
and increased since World War II. In this re-
spect, the war in Korea may eventually prove to 
be an event of tremendous consequence to the na-
tional welfare and security of the United States. 
This brief review of postwar strategies shows 
that planning and intelligence are closely linked, 
for Intelligence must provide the knowledge for 
the planners. It must aid in the assessment of 
Soviet actions wherever they take place and pre-
pare realistic estimates. Timing and method are 
of tremendous importance. Are the Soviets pre-
pared to exert military force in several areas, and, 
if so, where and when? Will they continue to 
hope for military, political, and economic decay 
in the western democracies, or will they strike

nor? Do they feel that the extension of their 
influence by nonmilitary means is fast enough, or 
will they decide in favor of open war even at the 
risk of the atomic destruction of their population 
centers? A great number of diverse elements are 
involved in finding answers to any of these ques-
tions: the progress of Soviet technology, the tem-
perament of individuals in the Kremlin, increased 
exploitation of natural resources, the morale of the 
peoples of western Europe, and economic problems 
in all parts of the world. To find the right an-
swers, the resources and skills of the personnel of 
all United States Intelligence agencies will be 
taxed to the utmost. 
IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGY 
In an effort to prepare neat definitions, much 
has been said and written on the subjects of strat-
egy and tactics, although the nature of modern 
warfare has led to the inevitable conclusion that 
the differences between the two cannot be drawn 
as clearly today as they were formerly?just as 
the distinctions between war and peace are no 
longer clear-cut. Tactics, as a military term, re-
fers to the employment of units in combat and to 
their ordered arrangement and maneuver in rela-
tion to each other or to the enemy. In connection 
with the employment of the nonmilitary factors 
of strategy, tactics is simply descriptive of the 
various implementations of a nation's master plan. 
Strategy and tactics are directly related to strate-
gic intelligence and operational intelligence, 
the meanings of which have been discussed in 
chapter 1. 
In brief the intelligence officer, in his perspec-
tive of the world scene, must recognize that strat-
egy is the forest, tactics are the trees, and neither 
has meaning without the other. He must not only 
understand the relationships between world events 
as they occur, but also be able to predict how an 
enemy may react in a given situation. In con-
sidering the matter of tactics, he must realize that 
although operations may vary in size and intensity, 
they are always designed to further the strategic 
plan and national objectives. 
Thus far it has been emphasized that intelli-
gence materially serves strategy, and that it has 
an important responsibility in assisting the im-
CONFIDENTIAL 
plementation of strategy by non-military means. 
In a tactical or operational military situation in-
telligence plays an equally significant part. Here, 
the intelligence officer must have a professional 
competence in matters relating to military opera-
tions and their component elements. This involves 
knowledge of the characteristics, capabilities, and 
new developments of ships, aircraft, weapons, 
technical equipment, personnel, and materiel, to-
gether with procedures, methods of employment, 
and techniques. His professional competence will 
be further increased by study of the art, theories, 
and history of warfare. 
Principles of Warfare 
The Principles of War, or general truths 
adopted as guides for action, are based upon the 
writings of theorists and the experiences of suc-
cessful military men from ancient to modern 
times. The many books on this subject merit the 
attention of intelligence officers, because they are 
basic guides to the organization, maintenance, and 
application of all types of military forces. These 
principles influence tactics, and an understanding 
of their application gives greater meaning to the 
procedures involved in developing operational sit-
uations. They can serve as a check-list for analyti-
cal purposes, but it must be remembered that they 
cannot be considered individually since they are 
all closely interrelated. 
The Principle of Objective emphasizes the need 
for relating all tactical objectives to national ob-
jectives and has been mentioned in the preceding 
discussion. The Principle of Offensive means 
concentration of all possible effort toward obtain-
ing the objective by successful offensive action; it 
is based on the truism that military victory can 
only result from offensive action. An offensive 
has the advantages of initiative and freedom of 
action, and compels the enemy to disperse his 
strength, thereby limiting concentration of forces 
for effective action. Finally, an offensive raises 
the morale and determination of both the fighting 
force and the supporting civilian force; while, at 
the same time, it may effectively lower the morale 
of opposing forces. Defensive action is not con-
sidered a principle of war, because it is tolerated 
only for purposes of security or for gaining ad-
vantages leading to ultimate offensive action.

AN INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE IN A CHANGING WORLD CONFIDENTIAL 
The Principle of Mass includes a concentration 
of combat power, proper timing and placement, a 
sufficient number of personnel who are carefully 
trained and thoroughly indoctrinated for preci-
sion work, the availability of weapons and mate-
riel for fire power in adequate quantity and of 
proper quality, and the facility to move both men 
and materiel as required. Accumulative mass is 
based on a systematic plan and timetable to re-
duce the enemy's power of resistance effectively. 
To the physical shock effect of mass attack must 
be added the psychological effect in creating anx-
iety and fear in the minds of both troops and 
civilians. Related to this principle is that of the 
Economy of Force which directs the distribution 
and alignment of forces for combat to achieve de-
cisive results. This principle does not mean the 
saving or non-commitment of military force. 
Marshal Foch once made some pertinent com-
ments on this subject: 
There is a proverb which says you cannot 
hunt two hares at the same time. You would 
catch neither of them. Efforts must be con-
centrated. Those who would say economy 
means sparing one's own forces being careful 
not to disperse one's own efforts would only 
state part of the truth. Those would come 
closer to the truth who could assimilate the 
other art of knowing how to expend usefully 
and profitably to make the best possible use 
of all available resources. 
The appropriate distribution of force reduces the 
element of risk; forces are not committed to battle 
before sufficient strength has been gained to in-
sure success. This principle acts as a check and 
a balance on the others. 
The Principle of Movement concerns the mobile 
qualities of combat units and their proper and 
prompt logistic support; it conditions and limits 
the principles of offensive, mass, and economy of 
force. Mobility involves not only the speed, range, 
and maneuverability of equipment, but also the 
ability to transport combat units as entities with 
a minimum loss of time. The security of lines of 
movement becomes a vital factor in a successful 
operation. For example, in the North African 
campaign of World War II, logistic support was 
denied the Nazis by Allied naval and air forces 
which sank German ships and shot down German 
transports which were attempting to bring in addi-
tional troops and materiel. This principle largely 
determines the possibility of Surprise which is an-
other principle of war. The employment of sur-
prise permits the more effective use of combat 
forces when the enemy is unaware of the time and 
place of their impending effort. Surprise is often 
possible as a result of security, rapidity of move-
ment, deception, and the audacity of the com-
mander in striking under conditions which appear 
unusually difficult and therefore unlikely. New 
weapons and new or different methods of making 
use of current weapons may also make surprise 
possible. Obviously, surprise can magnify the 
effects of an offensive or a mass attack. However, 
advantageous as surprise may be, it must be kept 
in mind that the enemy may employ it too, so that 
all preparations must be taken to guard against 
surprise. 
The Principle of Security is applicable in times 
of peace as well as war and is closely associated 
with the warning function of intelligence and the 
activities of counterintelligence. In an opera-
tional situation close attention must be given to 
such matters as camouflage, dispersion, antiair-
craft weapons, radio and radar countermeasures, 
early warning networks, and defensive armament. 
The Principle of Simplicity recognizes the great 
importance of clear-cut military organization and 
easily understood administrative procedures in 
order to obtain the greatest degree of cooperation 
and coordination. Simplicity reduces to a min-
imum the possibilities of faulty execution through 
misunderstanding and makes easier the handling 
of an unexpected situation. Clarity in command 
responsibilities and relationships and the publica-
tion of Standard Operating Procedures contribute 
to the required simplicity of military operations. 
Confidence, a minimum of confusion, and a max-
imum of efficiency are qualities which can be de-
rived from careful attention to this principle. The 
Principle of Cooperation provides for unified ef-
fort toward a common goal; unified command, 
joint training, economy of joint effort, and self-
lessness of interests are all contributory factors.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
plementation of strategy, a consideration of spe-
cific operations which took place in the Pacific 
during World War II is most helpful. The suc-
cesses and the failures of the opposing forces were 
directly related to the effectiveness of their re-
spective intelligence efforts. 
For the attack on Pearl Harbor the Japanese 
commanders were provided with intelligence 
which was amazingly complete, accurate, and 
usable. The contribution of intelligence to their 
success is well summarized in the United States 
Strategic Bombing Survey, Japanese Military and 
Naval Intelligence Division: 
The shocking success of the Japanese attack 
on Pearl Harbor was due to careful planning 
based upon nearly complete intelligence as to 
the position, movements, and strength of 
United States forces in the area . . . 
The Japanese had a large amount of de-
tailed information concerning United States 
fleet units, air strength, and other military in-
stallations at Pearl Harbor which was put to 
effective use in the surprise attack. After the 
raid, crashed Japanese planes and a beach 
midget submarine yielded annotated charts 
and other documents which set forth the 
United States situation in fairly accurate 
The midget submarine had on board a 
United States Navy hydrographic chart 
which had been used as a track chart for the 
sub's intended transit of the harbor. It was 
annotated with detailed navigational data, 
with the names and positions of major units 
expected to be in the harbor, and with the 
berthing areas of minor units and auxiliaries. 
Similar intelligence concerning ship anchor-
ages? charts for aircraft torpedo runs against 
specified targets, and data on Honolulu radio 
frequencies were found in crashed planes. 
The leader of the first attacking flight, Cap-
tain Fuchida, has reported the careful prep-
arations which accounted for the effectiveness 
of the attack. The attacking pilots were 
briefed on 23 November, 3 December, 7 De-
cember, and at a final session two hours before 
the attack on 8 December (Tokyo time). At 
the briefing the day prior to the attack, the re-
vised estimate of the major units at Pearl was 
announced as no carriers, 7 battleships and 7 
cruisers. Actually there were 8 battleships 
and 8 cruisers. At the final briefing, the pilots 
were given mimeographed sheets indicating?
with names in most cases and with substan-
tial accuracy?the probable positions of the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
118 
warships berthed around Ford Island and at 
the Navy Yard. 
Conditions affecting the United States Forces 
during the period immediately following the at-
tack are discussed in the Report of the Joint Com,-
mittee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor 
Attack : 
While it appears that some planes under 
Navy direction were assigned to search the 
sector to the north of Oahu, generally re-
garded as the dangerous sector from the 
standpoint of an air attack, they were diverted 
to the southwest by reason of a false report 
that the Japanese carriers were in that 
direction. 
Admiral Smith, Chief of Staff to Admiral 
Kimmel, said he did not get the information 
as to the probable location from which the 
Japanese carriers launched the attack for 
some 2 days. There is a great deal of con-
fusion including false civilian reports of troop 
parachute landings and a false report from 
one of our own planes concerning an enemy 
carrier to the south. A chart showing the 
position of the Japanese carriers was taken 
from a Japanese plane by the Army on De-
cember 7 but was not shown the Navy until 
the afternoon. 
The deplorable feature of the action follow-
ing the attack was the failure of the Navy and 
Army to coordinate their efforts through in-
telligence at hand. The same Army radar 
unit that had tracked the Japanese force in, 
plotted it back out to the north. Yet this 
vital information, which would have made 
possible an effective search, was employed by 
neither service. 
The situation in connection with the Japanese 
occupation of the Philippine Islands was some-
what similar. Here again, accurate intelligence 
regarding American forces on Luzon made pos-
sible effective operational planning, which was 
coupled with the element of surprise. The Jap-
anese estimate of the situation in the Philippines 
proved to be substantially correct and their forces 
enjoyed early and economical success in spite of 
the fact that the United States ground forces main-
tained organized resistance longer than had been 
anticipated. 
The basis of Japanese success in this operation 
was the destruction within a week of American 
air strength by the Japanese 11th Air Fleet based 
in Formosa. According to information brought

chi, then Chief of Staff of the 2d Fleet, and of 
Captain Takahashi, then on the 11th Air Fleet

the strength and disposition of the American air 
forces. Making use of surprise, the invaders were 
able to destroy most of the American planes on the 
ground. This vital information was obtained by 
reconnaissance aircraft on 24-25 November which 
reported 300 planes in the Luzon area?there were 
actually 317. 
Prior to the Battle of Midway in mid-1942 there 
was a tremendous decline in the efficiency of Jap-
anese Intelligence, with the result that the Jap-
anese commanders entered into this battle with 
an abysmal lack of anything approaching accurate 
knowledge. The Japanese Estimate of the Situa-
tion, discussed in the ONI Review for May 1947, 
included the following specific points: (1) Al-
though the U. S. Navy "lacks the will to fight," 
it will counterattack if Midway is occupied; (2) 
"The enemy is not aware of our plans ;" (3) the 
United States has no carrier force in the vicinity; 
and (4) after attacking Midway by air and de-
stroying American shore-based strength, the Jap-
anese Striking Force will still have enough planes 
"to destroy any enemy task force which may 
choose to attack." 
On the other hand, the United States forces had 
available a rather accurate estimate of Japanese 
plans and preparations drawn up by Intelligence 
from various items of information derived from 
many sources. One of the vital decisions of the 
Pacific War was made by Admiral Nimitz when 
he accepted the estimate of his intelligence section 
that Midway and the Aleutians were primary ob-
jectives of the enemy. By 23 May, Rear Admiral 
Bellinger, Naval Air Commander at Pearl, was 
able to predict the Japanese plan of attack, the 
composition, approximate routes, and timetable of 
the forces which were threatening Midway. This 
battle was a major success for U. S. Intelligence; 
the "United States Strategic Bombing Survey" 
comments: 
The battle of Midway was a notable early 
occasion where United States intelligence con-
cerning the enemy was superior to the enemy's 
intelligence concerning the United States, 
thus affording an opportunity to organize and 
employ our forces effectively and achieve a 
victory of decisive importance. 
Just as the Battle of Midway is generally con-
sidered to have been a turning point in the war, 
so it was also a turning point in the intelligence 
effort. As the war progressed, American intelli-
gence increased in quality and quantity while that 
of the Japanese decreased. The Imperial Staff 
continued to underestimate United States strength 
and capabilities and concluded that no major op-
erations could be attempted before the end of 1912 
because of American naval losses at Pearl Harbor 
and heavy shipping losses in the Atlantic. 
These faulty estimates were partially responsi-
ble for the success of the Allied counterattack 
through the Solomons area which marked a change 
in pace from the defensive to the offensive. The 
American landings in the Guadalcanal area in 
August 1942 caught the Japanese completely by 
surprise at the particular time when they were 
not prepared to defend the area or to mount an 
effective counteroffensive. Their difficulties were 
compounded by two disastrous errors: the first 
was an initial intelligence report that less than 
1,000 American troops were involved in the land-
ings, while actually there were more than 19,000, 
including the 1st Marine Division and two Army 
battalions; the second was an underestimate of 
troops required to recapture Guadalcanal, based 
upon experience in China and in Malaya. 
Using this inaccurate and incomplete informa-
tion, the Japanese made a number of attempts to 
regain the island with insufficient forces which 
were destroyed one after the other. In August, 1 
battalion was committed and destroyed; in Sep-
tember, 3 battalions mounted an unsuccessful as-
sault; in October, after the extent of United States 
strength was realized, a joint Army-Navy opera-
tion involving two divisions of 29,000 troops was 
carried out which also failed. Further attempts 
were equally ineffective and Guadalcanal was 
finally abandoned in January 1943. By continu-
ing to underestimate the strength of the American 
forces, the Japanese gave them the invaluable op-
portunity to strengthen their position gradually 
so that each attack was successfully repulsed. 
The glaring error of the Japanese during the 
Solomons campaign in underestimating United 
States strength resulted in a serious weakening of

their air and naval power by piecemeal commit-
ment in a series of ineffective counterattacks. 
Their best carrier air groups were decimated, and 
their warship strength in all categories was ma-
terially reduced in the long series of naval actions. 
At the same time, heavy transport shipping losses 
progressively curtailed their offensive operations, 
not only in the Solomons-New Guinea area, but 
later in other areas as well. The effects of this 
poorly conceived plan of operations in the Solo-
mons were far-reaching. Since the carrier air 
groups had been drawn from the Combined Fleet 
based at Truk, their destruction made it impossible 
for the fleet to support Japanese positions in the 
Gilbert and Marshall Islands either by surface or 
air action. Before replacements were possible, 
American forces were able to over-run those is-
lands. These persisting losses had a deteriorating 
effect on Japan's total military strength from 
which she was never able to recover. 
At the battle for Leyte Gulf the Japanese naval 
operation, carried out by means of a three-pronged 
attack, was planned and executed with almost no 
intelligence available. In numerous instances in-
dividual commanders could not employ their units 
effectively because of the lack of knowledge re-
garding their opposition. The effect on the out-
come of the battle is summarized in the United 
States Strategic Bombing Survey: 
Investigation shows that a continuing basic 
weakness in the Japanese position throughout 
this action was the lack of adequate opera-
tional intelligence. This is seen to have con-
tributed to their other difficulties and to have 
compounded them. They were unable to get 
adequate timely information as to the 
strength, location, and movements of the 
United States forces, and as a consequence 
were operating a large part of the time by 
guess and chance. The chief cause of the lack 
of adequate intelligence in this situation was 
the recurring failure to maintain air recon-
naissance, which was admittedly a cardinal 
weakness. There is no indication that there 
was any effective Japanese submarine scout-
ing in these actions. 
In this battle, as was later the case at Iwo Jima 
and Okinawa, United States naval commanders 
were able to base their operations on much better 
intelligence regarding the strength, disposition, 
and composition of opposing forces. 
CONFIDENTIAL 120 
It is true that in the latter stages of the Pacific 
war the Japanese were able frequently to prepare 
fairly accurate estimates of impending Allied op-
erations; but it is equally true that the number 
of possible objectives was rapidly reduced as the 
Allied forces approached their ultimate objective. 
The campaigns at Midway, in the Solomons, and 
in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands each reflected 
progressively sharper drops in the quantity and 
quality of intelligence available to the Japanese 
operational commanders. As a result, they were 
forced more and more to rely on professional spec-
ulation which contributed to defeat rather than 
to victory. From a review of the various Pacific 
campaigns, it is concluded that intelligence con-
tributed materially to successful military opera-
tions, while a severe and sometimes insurmount-
able handicap was imposed upon the commander 
who did not have it, or who failed to use it. 
DYNAMICS OF STRATEGY, TACTICS AND 
INTELLIGENCE 
Just as strategy and tactics are formulated in 
part from the knowledge provided by Intelligence, 
intelligence activities are likewise affected by de-
velopments arising from strategies and tactics. 
The intelligence perspective, therefore, must have 
flexibility and the capacity to adapt itself to 
changing conditions and circumstances. Events 
can and do take place in the world scene and in 
operational situations which have a direct and 
immediate impact on planning, so that Intelli-
gence must be prepared to react promptly if it is 
to make its full contribution. 
During the course of their long history, British 
planners have shown a remarkable capacity to 
make use of changing events, extracting the ad-
vantages presented and adapting their plans and 
policies accordingly. Such a procedure at the 
higher planning levels might be critically de-
scribed as improvisation and opportunism; how-
ever, since the British have not deviated from their 
basic national objectives, its merit has been his-
torically demonstrated. In this connection, 
Churchill has commented: "We assign a large 
importance to opportunism and improvisation, 
seeking rather to live and conquer in accordance 
with the unfolding event than to aspire to domi-
nate it often by fundamental decisions."

AN INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIV 
World War II is replete with examples of the 
ability of American commanders in the field to 
adapt themselves readily to changing circum-
stances; the ingenuity of the individual American 
soldier, sailor, and airman has reflected a common 
national characteristic. American top-level plan-
ning in the past has tended to differ from that of 
the British. In noting this difference, Churchill 
again has said that "in the military as in the com-
mercial or production spheres, the American mind 
runs naturally to broad, sweeping logical conclu-
sions on the largest scale. . . . They feel that once 
the foundation has been planned on true and com-
prehensive lines, all other stages will follow natu-
rally and almost inevitably." The approach of 
American planners has been to prepare several 
carefully analyzed plans each of which, if selected, 
will lead to inevitable conclusions. The success of 
this approach has also been amply demonstrated. 
In view of the trends of modern warfare, however, 
it is entirely possible that American planners may 
now find it advantageous, if not necessary, to make 
full use of developing situations. Whenever this 
is true, Intelligence can make a substantial 
contribution. 
For the greatest success of their mutual effort, 
the relationships between policy-makers and In-
telligence should be closely scrutinized at frequent 
intervals. In his provocative article, Intelligence 
and Policy-Making in Foreign Affairs, Roger 
Hilsman, Jr., serving with the Joint Military Ad-
visory Group in Europe in 1952, has analyzed these 
relationships and found a division of labor which, 
in his opinion, may not be the best. 
Intelligence on the one hand and policy-
making and action on the other are separated 
physically, organizationally, chronologically, 
functionally, and by skills?separated in every 
possible way. 
His suggestion, in part, is a reconsideration of or-
ganizational structure. Regardless of what sug-
gestions may be offered, it is true that the dy-
namics of strategy, tactics, and intelligence can 
best operate under the most carefully coordinated 
conditions in an atmosphere of mutual 
understanding. 
Attitudes for Intelligence 
In assuming its share of responsibility, Intelli-
gence must maintain a perspective that is positive, 
269196-54--9 
: CIA-RDP85G00105R000100210002-9 
E IN A CHANGING WORLD CONFIDENTIAL 
clear, and keenly alert; it must never lose sight 
of its own purposes and objectives as determined 
by the requirements of those responsible for na-
tional strategy and its implementation. In Mr. 
Hilsman's opinion, 
. . . the important step for intelligence is 
an intellectual reorientation designed to create 
a new set of attitudes?a frame of mind which 
is manipulative, instrumental, action-con-
scious, policy oriented. The major task 
before the researchers is one of recasting their 
thought to the context of action, and adapting 
their tools to the needs of policy. 
Ultimately, both operators and researchers 
must move from hunch and intuition to an im-
proved capacity for explicit and disciplined 
policy analysis. If at the same time the re-
searchers become policy-oriented, there may 
develop a more effective integration of knowl-
edge and action . . ? The first problem is one 
of attitudes and skills. 
?World Politics, 0 ctober 1952. 
Although critical, this statement serves a good 
purpose in that it stimulates a thoughtful con. 
sideration of appropriate attitudes. 
Two things merit special attention. The first is 
that planners must recognize that intelligence is a 
continuous activity and that planning must be 
grounded on fact rather than on conjecture. The 
second, is that Intelligence personnel must con-
sider their work in time of peace as important as 
in time of war, if not more so. General Donovan 
has appropriately said: 
It is much more difficult to prevent war than 
to wage it. It is even more important in 
peacetime, in a sense, to know what people are 
up to, and what's going on, so that the peace 
can be preserved. If you want to have peace 
in the world, you've got to know the truth of 
what is happening and not be forced to rely 
on rumor. Rumor might make us act in one 
way, and knowledge would compel us to act in 
another. 
Shortly after World War I, Colonel Nicolai, well-
known German intelligence officer, urged that the 
peacetime functions of Intelligence be maintained 
and said, "But if even today certain circles believe 
that nations can cooperate, they ought to make 
sure the way of cooperation is illuminated by a 
good Intelligence Service . . ." 
Nicolai also summarized the role of intelligence 
in the world scene when he said: "The Intelligence

Service moves ahead of developments into the dark 
future, in order to discover what it will be and to

This discussion has stressed the importance of 
accurate, pertinent knowledge as it relates to the 
fields of strategy and tactics. The tremendous 
volume and scope of such knowledge require that 
CONFIDENTIAL

it be reduced, for the sake of manageability, to 
its logical component parts in order that it may 
be efficiently collected, carefully evaluated, and 
made available in usable form. The following 
chapter will outline by component parts the con-
tent of intelligence used by strategic and opera-
tional planners.

CHAPTER 5 
COMPONENTS OF INTELLIGENCE KNOWLEDGE 
Intelligence knowledge is generally divided into 
eight component parts: geographic, transporta-
tion and telecommunications, sociological, politi-
cal, economic, technical and scientific, armed 
forces, and biographical. Each part is then often 
identified as a type of intelligence. While this 
division is not completely standardized and varia-
tions can be debated, it is agreed that no one com-
ponent can stand alone. Each is interdependent 
and interrelated with one or more of the others. 
In order to gain a proper perspective when using 
this knowledge, all parts must be integrated into 
a well-balanced whole. 
In connection with use, two points must be em-
phasized: first, for purposes of planning and 
reaching decisions at almost any command level, 
the user can seldom confine himself to only one 
component; and second, depending upon the par-
ticular problem at hand, he will usually select 
various items from different components in deter-
mining the best answer. In other words, point of 
view and particular needs govern the use of in-
telligence knowledge and the parts thereof. In 
estimating the capabilities of an opposing military 
force, for example, the commander must know 
more than its size and fire-power, as gained from 
enemy order of battle reports. He must also be 
informed of the enemy's economic and technical 
resources and the personal characteristics of op-
posing commanders and personnel. Under some 
circumstances, political and social forces govern-
ing enemy behavior may be important. Thus 
knowledge not encompassed by the category of 
Armed Forces Intelligence may be of inestimable 
value to a subordinate command in carrying out 
its assigned task and represent a vital saving in 
time and lives. An Underwater Demolition Team 
is greatly aided by advance geographic knowledge 
regarding such matters as beach gradient; avia-
tors need meteorological data as well as target 
information; and those responsible for logistics 
require a wide range of intelligence knowledge in 
128 
order to perform their responsibilities efficiently 
and economically. 
Since these various components are mutually 
supporting, the intelligence officer cannot wisely 
confine his energies to the mastery of only one, as 
will be pointed out in the ensuing discussion. 
GEOGRAPHIC INTELLIGENCE 
Geographic intelligence is the military evalua-
tion of all the geographic factors which may in 
any way influence a military operation. Military 
geography embraces all aspects of the physical en-
vironment of man, both natural and artificial: the 
position, size, shape, boundaries, weather, climate, 
water characteristics, land forms, drainage, vege-
tation, and surface materials of all parts of the 
earth; also the cultural or man-made features such 
as cities, transportation routes, industries, mines, 
and farms. 
Frontiers 
The problems of location, size, shape, and fron-
tiers for a territory are largely strategic. Loca-
tion basically affects the economic, political, and 
social nature of a country because of its relation 
to markets, to agricultural and mineral resources, 
to terrain and climate, and to transport. Military 
problems grow out of the economic, political, and 
social. Size and shape and frontiers have mili-
tary significance, for great size may afford an 
opportunity to trade space for time. Air power 
may shrink distances but size will still give min-
utes or hours of warning of conventional air at-
tack to centrally located industrial sites. On the 
other hand, size is a weakness when there is waste 
or undeveloped land that requires expensive long 
hauls for industry and long military movements 
of materiel and personnel from one frontier region 
to another. The shape of a country, of course, 
determines the relative amount of frontier to be 
defended. Frontiers have multiple significance. 
Strong natural frontiers as opposed to artificial

ones may tend to isolate countries from other peo-
ples and ideas and hamper trade. Purely politi-
cal frontiers that shift with the fortunes of war 
will affect the military and political views and 
behaviors of nations. Sea frontiers will influence 
the growth of seapower. The military study of 
frontiers must consider man-made features such 
as fortifications and bridges. In a time of cold 
war, the fact that satellite frontiers have been de-
nuded of farms and villages, stripped bare of 
vegetation at the boundary itself, and protected 
by electrified wire, mine fields, and patrols with 
dogs is no small intelligence consideration. In 
the planning of conventional military campaigns, 
frontiers may be studied for their tank traps, 
dragons' teeth, bunkers, and access roads, as well 
as for their natural physical elements. 
Topography 
Land forms, drainage, surface materials, and 
vegetation, all elements related to topography, are 
of more than army interest. The general char-
acter of continents and islands, even of plains, 
mountains, and plateaus, are of strategic interest. 
For example, the broad sweep of the North Ger-
man plain across Germany, Poland, and into 
Russia, as well as the Pyrenees barrier, are of 
importance in assessing the potentialities of Soviet 
military advance in Europe. But whether col-
lected in strategic encyclopedias or observed in 
field operations, military concern extends to in-
dividual valleys, basins, ridges, cliffs, hills, and 
other features. In this age of joint operations, 
all three services are concerned with these elements 
of topography. Of special importance to the Navy 
are the detailed characteristics of coasts and land-
ing beaches. All these topographic features affect 
the movement and supply of forces, the types of 
equipment that can be used, the methods of attack 
and defense, the possibilities of concealment and 
surprise, and many other operational matters. 
Land forms and drainage conditions are so 
closely related that it is almost impossible to con-
sider one to the exclusion of the other. Whether 
an area is fully or partially drained, the number, 
width, depth, and direction of rivers and streams, 
and the condition of their banks and crossing-
places, are determining factors in the movements 
of troops and the tactics employed in any given 
CONFIDENTIAL

NAVAL OFFICERS 
area. The number, size, and distribution of lakes, 
ponds, lagoons, swamps, and marshes are elements 
that may play an important part in military oper-
ations. Subsurface water is a principal source of 
water supply, and in many areas constiutes a ma-
jor drainage problem in excavation and construc-
tion. In recent years rivers and swamps have 
many times shaped military actions. Examples 
are the causeway from Johore to Singapore's back 
door, the Remagen bridge across the Rhine, the 
Yalu river, which freezes over to allow troops to 
cross without bridges, and the Rapido in Italy 
which was a barrier for so long. 
Military interest extends to soils analysis as well 
as to land form. The materials of the surface of 
the earth determine, among other things, what 
kind of vehicles can move over it, whether it is 
suitable for entrenchments, how quickly it will 
drain, and the effect of frost. Surface materials 
have a definite significance concerning the con-
struction and maintenance of roads, airdromes, 
and other engineering problems. In addition, in 
the broader picture, soils affect agriculture, min-
ing, and basic transportation routes. There are 
many regions where seasonal weather changes re-
lated to local soils bar virtually all movement ex-
cept along established railways and better roads. 
Japanese ability to honeycomb some of their war-
time positions proved to be a major factor in slow-
ing the reduction of their military power. This 
was noted in such places as Iwo Jima and Okinawa 
where soft rock allowed relatively rapid digging. 
The coral of some south Pacific atolls proved to be 
a superb construction material for airstrip run-
ways. The muck of Attu rendered inefficient much 
of our artillery fire in the landing at Massacre 
Bay. 
Coasts and landing beach intelligence, of special 
naval interest, is now becoming so specialized and 
requires such development that its detailed discus-
sion is reserved for the amphibious section of 
chapter 13. It involves a study of the sea ap-
proaches, the coastal terrain, the beaches them-
selves, the beach exits, and adjacent terrain. 
The presence or absence of forests, brush, grass-
land, cultivated crops, and other forms of vegeta-
tion has a vital effect on military operations. 
Vegetation may be in either the primeval state or 
the result of cultivation. In any case, its charac-

ter, distribution, and seasonal variation have im-
portant bearings on cross-country movements, 
deployment, concealment, and visibility. Local 
supplies of food, forage, and timber are also re-
lated to the nature of existing vegetation. Exten-
sive areas of dense vegetation, such as woods and 
jungles, or the relative absence of vegetation, as 
in the desert areas, may be a major consideration 
in strategic and logistics planning. They may 
result in a need for special types of organization, 
equipment, and methods of supply. When these 
areas are not too extensive, they are considered 
primarily from the tactical point of view. How 
different were the wars of the Burma jungle with 
small units filing through the brush and the great 
armored sweeps of the Afrika Korps and the 
opposing "Desert Rats" between El Alamein and 
Bizerte 
Hydrography 
Hydrography, and especially its subdivision, 
oceanography, is of particular naval concern when 
detailed information is required. Amphibious 
operations are especially affected by hydrographic 
considerations. Hydrography, of course, refers 
to the measurement and charting of all bodies of 
water; oceanography is concerned more specifi-
cally with phenomena of the oceans and seas, in-
cluding gulfs, bays, and estuaries. Naval con-
cern includes tides and currents, sea and swell, sea 
water characteristics of salinity and temperature, 
bottom topography, sediments, and marine life. 
Knowledge of ocean currents, tides, sea, and swell 
is important to all ships at sea, but particularly 
to craft engaged in amphibious operations. The 
significant and costly effect of a lack of such 
knowledge is illustrated by the unhappy position 
of landing craft stranded off Tarawa in the Pacific 
during World War II when a change in the wind 
varied the depth of water over offshore reefs and 
the Marines had to wade ashore in the face of 
withering enemy fire. The needs for detailed hy-
drographic data were again sharply demonstrated 
prior to the Inchon landing in Korea in 1951, 
when landing craft had to thread their way 
through restricted waters to land in a harbor 
where tides were all-important and the existence 
of extensive mud flats directly affected the types 
of landing equipment which could be used. 
125 
Studies of temperature, salinity, and density of 
sea water are especially important to the use of 
sonar in submarine and anti-submarine warfare. 
Again, in the broader sphere, warm and cold cur-
rents strongly affect the habitability of many re-
gions of the world. The Gulf Stream makes 
northwestern Europe important in one sense, 
while the Labrador current has quite different ef-
fects across the Atlantic. 
The configuration of the ocean bottom, depth 
of water, type and distribution of bottom sedi-
ments are important elements in navigation in-
structions and in the location of anchorages. 
These conditions together with information on 
reefs, shoals, and other obstructions, help to deter-
mine the location of naval bases, and the planning 
of naval and amphibious operations. Someday 
when the means are found to exploit the seas for 
more than fisheries and offshore oil wells, control 
of marine resources may become a compelling stra-
tegic issue. 
Even marine biology is of naval concern in a 
variety of ways. Whales or other sea creatures 
may be mistaken for submarines. Some forms of 
marine life create enough noise to obscure more 
significant sounds on the sensitive hydrophones 
used in submarine and antisubmarine warfare. In 
a number of parts of the world a ship or snorkel-
ing submarine may leave a tell-tale fiery wake be-
cause of the bioluminescence from the plankton 
growing in the water. All military personnel, 
whether sailing or flying over the seas, or wading 
ashore in a landing, need some knowledge of the 
habitat and habits of poisonous or savage marine 
life. This applies to TJDT's who work in the 
water and to those involuntarily brought into the 
water due to aircraft failure or ship sinking. 
There are stinging jellyfish and some nonedible 
fish that may poison the unwary, as well as the 
well-publicised sharks that infest many regions. 
Aerology 
Aerology or meteorology refers to the study of 
the atmosphere, especially its variations of heat 
and moisture, its winds, and so forth. Weather 
refers to the meteorological conditions such as 
wind, temperature, rain, snow, and cloud, that 
affect an area at a given time or for a short period 
of time. Climate, on the other hand, refers to the

average and range of meteorological conditions 
affecting an area over a long period of time. In 
a sense climate is strategic in nature since it af-
fects the basic planning of military operations 
and of course affects the economic and social life 
of an area through the crops that can be raised 
and the density of the population. Operations of 
a military nature frequently must be planned in 
the light of known seasonal changes of weather 
based on climate studies. It is impossible to read 
military history without an awareness of the im-
portance of weather to operations planning. The 
Japanese carriers that hit Pearl Harbor came in 
behind a cold front with heavy clouds and rain 
that shielded their approach. General Eisen-
hower's Crusade in Europe makes constant ref-
erence to aerology and hydrography : 
There was unusual operational hazard con-
nected with the Casablanca project. During 
the late fall and winter the northwest African 
coast is a forbidding one from the standpoint 
of small boat landings. The long Atlantic 
swells break up on the beaches in terrifying 
fashion and even in relatively good autumn 
weather this condition exists, on the average, 
four days out of five. . . . 
After the abandonment of the May target 
date, the next combination of moon, tide, and 
time of sunrise that we considered practicable 
for the attack (on Normandie) occurred 
June 5, 6, and 7. We wanted to cross the 
channel with our convoys at night so that 
darkness would conceal the strength and di-
rection of our several attacks. We wanted a 
moon for our airborne assaults. We needed 
approximately forty minutes of daylight pre-
ceding the ground assault to complete our 
bombing and preparatory bombardment. We 
had to attack on a relatively low tide because 
of beach obstacles which had to be removed 
while uncovered. These principal factors 
dictated the general period; but the selection 
of the actual day would depend upon weather 
forecasts. 
If none of the three days should prove sat-
isfactory from the standpoint of weather, con-
sequences would ensue that were almost terri-
fying to contemplate . . . 
When the commanders assembled on the 
morning of June 4 the report we received was 
discouraging. Low clouds, high winds, and 
formidable wave action were predicted to 
make landing a most hazardous affair. The 
meteorologists said that air support would 
be impossible, naval gunfire would be ineffi-

cient, and even the handling of small boats 
would be rendered difficult . . . 
When the conference started the first re-
ort given us by group Captain Staff and the 
Meteorological Staff was that the bad condi-
tions predicted the day before for the coast 
of France were actually prevailing then and 
that if we had persisted in the attempt to 
land on June 5 a major disaster would almost 
certainly have resulted. 
Aerology as a science is becoming much more 
complex because of the heavier demands upon it. 
Although a physical science, it has so many var-
iables that predictions on weather have some of 
the indeterminate character of the social sciences. 
We no longer are interested in the "weather" alone. 
We need to know what conditions are at many 
different altitudes. Close to the ground much 
more detail is needed in order to prepare defenses 
against use of toxic warfare. Aloft flying 
weather, headwinds, and tailwinds are quite dif-
ferent at various altitudes and such reports are 
routinely required for all flying operations. Now 
research into weather is extending into the upper 
atmosphere never before explored, in order to pre-
pare the way for turbojet and rocket flight of 
aircraft and missiles. 
Collection of weather data in war is so impor-
tant that very considerable efforts are made to 
obtain it. German weather stations were set up 
in Greenland to give advance warning of condi-
tions in the Atlantic and Europe, since weather 
moves generally eastward. To support our own 
carrier operations in the Pacific we had to estab-
lish stations in Siberia and also in China. Naval 
Group, China, operated literally hundreds of se-
cret weather stations deep behind the Japanese 
lines to report the weather that later would gov-
ern our carrier strikes in the Pacific. Today we 
would face some difficulties in weather data col-
lection from the vast Soviet territories if war were 
to come. One solution made public is a robot 
weather station that can be dropped from an air-
craft. On parachuting down, it would automati-
cally rise on extensible legs, push out an antenna, 
and broadcast coded radio signals on the weather 
in the same way as telemetering missiles. 
Weather reporting is now so technical that 
trained meteorologists must make detailed fore-
casts. But the intelligence officer, being responsi-

ble for reporting on the area of operations, must 
have some familiarity with the subject. He must 
at least be able to read weather maps, station 
models, sequence reports, and to interpret their 
meaning. 
Urban Geography 
A subdivision of military geography is con-
cerned with cities and other cultural factors. The 
applications of this information are numerous. 
Strategic targets of factories, transport, and hous-
ing need study. Tactics frequently involve seiz-
ure of a town, and require detailed information 
on construction of buildings, possible strong-
points, main thoroughfares, power, water, and 
communications facilities. Later there may be 
questions of billeting space in what is left. Cer-
tainly vulnerabilq. to fire, high xplosive, or

Descriptive Analysis of Military Regions 
In practically all nations except the very small-
est, sufficient variation in geographical character 
exists to make it impractical to confine a study 
to the geography of a nation as a whole. Conse-
quently, studies are often broken down into re-
gions having geographical characteristics which 
would exert a definite influence on military oper-
ations. By definition, a military region is a re-
gion of any size in which the combination of 
geographic conditions is relatively uniform, and, 
as a result, permits the use of the same types of 
equipment, organization, and mode of operations 
throughout the region. These may be areas where 
mountains, plains, river systems, deserts, indus-
trialized areas, or other factors are predominant 
and thereby establish the nature of the region. 
Local minor variations in geographical conditions 
are treated as subregions. In preparing the de-
scriptive analysis of a military region, the area 
is first considered from the over-all viewpoint and 
then is broken down into appropriate subregions 
for detailed consideration. This type of encyclo-
pedic information used for general military plan-
ning usually needs additional detailed analysis 
and current reporting to meet tactical needs. 
Preparing Geographic Intelligence 
The importance of peacetime efforts in acquir-
ing the data needed for strategic studies has been 
127 
emphasized, and this is certainly true of geo-
graphic intelligence. Compilation of good charts 
and maps, painstaking analysis of soil surveys and 
other data from a variety of sources, and the 
matching of aerial photographs with existing 
charts is time consuming work that should go on 
continuously. Inevitably in war there are new 
demands and many of these processes must be 
speeded up. As potential areas of operations be-
come actual areas, the emphasis shifts from stra-
tegic to operational intelligence. 
The strategic area studies and surveys prepared 
by United States Armed Forces in World War II 
merit special mention here. In ONI, in the Naval 
Districts and River Commands, and at intelligence 
centers and joint intelligence collection agencies 
in operational areas, whole sections of specialists 
devoted their entire time to the evaluation, com-
pilation, and distribution of reports. Often, like 
the Joint Army-Navy Intelligence Studies 
(JANIS) , these reports were the result of joint 
effort. 
The surveys drew upon many divergent sources 
for their material. They contained data collected 
by aerial photographs over enemy territory, often 
supplemented by information gained from inter-
viewing engineers who had built or managed the 
installations photographed. Beach gradients 
were calculated from photographs taken from 
warplanes and even from snapshots taken by tour-
ists and missionaries; these pictures were supple-
mented by the notes of American geologists, nat-
uralists, and conchologists who had worked in the 
area, and by the reports of friendly natives or 
guerrillas. 
New Horizons of Geographic Intelligence 
The horizons of geographic intelligence have 
been pushed farther in several directions as a re-
sult of technological progress and political change. 
This of course, as is amply demonstrated else-
where in this book, applies to all intelligence. 
These geographic changes are easily illustrated by 
reference both to the World Wars and to more re-
cent events. World War I was largely fought in 
traditionally strategic areas, but included opera-
tions in places as remote as the Falkland Islands, 
Tanganyika, the Hejaz, and Cocos Islands. Much 
more striking were the changes of World War II

that took hundreds of thousands of Americans to 
such unlikely spots as Ulithi Atoll, that make 
commonplace in American thought the Hump, 
Kasserine Pass, Eniwetok, and Coral Sea. Cur-
rently we have become vitally concerned with new 
names: Abadan's refineries, Shinkolobwe's pitch-
blende, and the oil of Leduc. The turn of events 
has given America and consequently her Armed 
Forces heavier responsibilities than ever before. 
The new technology demands much greater geo-
graphical detail and accuracy. The long range 
guided missile, when it acquires range, command, 
speed, destructive power and accuracy, must still 
find the right targets. Since existing charts and 
maps have errors of many miles in some parts of 
the world, finding the target becomes a major 
problem, and constitutes a challenge to the geo-
graphic intelligence of the future. 
Polar Intelligence 
One of the expanded horizons of geographic in-
telligence is in the north polar regions. The old 
Mercator view of the world of sailing ships has 
been amplified by polar projections and the realis-
tic views of Richard Edes Harrison, well-known 
cartographer. The fact that the United States 
and Canada are really polar neighbors of the So-
viet Union is a familiar theme both of the Sunday 
supplements and military strategic estimates. The 
implementing of plans to meet this new challenge 
of the air age is a greater task than the mere recog-
nition of new problems. An immediate require-
ment since World War II has been to collect new 
geographic intelligence and operational experi-
ence on cold weather operations to overcome the 
admitted Soviet lead in this field. Such opera-
tions as Muskox, Frostbite, Icebox, Frigid, and 
Williwaw in the Arctic, and Higkjump in the 
Antarctic, have been directed to that end, as have 
also the daily weather flights from Ladd Field to 
the North Pole. Our general strategy has been 
revised to strengthen Alaska, string radar barriers 
and weather stations in belts across Canada, and 
to rebuild base facilities in Greenland and Iceland. 
We have mapped the Arctic, learned to sail in the 
northern seas, to cross tundra and ice, and devel-
oped clothing, fuels, lubricants, housing, and elec-
tronic gear suitable to the extreme temperatures 
and raging storms that are common to the north. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
We have also found out with guidance from vet-
eran Arctic explorers that operations in extreme 
latitudes are entirely possible with proper prepa-
ration. Though the likelihood of large land cam-
paigns in the polar area is not great, the extension 
of aircraft range and the advent of guided missiles 
make it imperative that intelligence officers have 
an awareness of the new problems of Arctic war-
fare and their influence on strategy and tactics. 
The Arctic cannot be defined by merely drawing 
the Arctic circle around the globe at latitude 
66?30'. A more descriptive line is the northern 
limit of trees, above which there is only tundra 
or ice. Below this the subarctic begins, and in-
cludes the northern limit of cereals, the continental 
taiga of all but southern Canada, much of northern 
Russia, and certainly the eastern half of Siberia. 
The low latitude Tibetan plateau is Arctic-type 
tundra, and winter operations even in the conti-
nental forest areas such as the Great Lakes, St. 
Lawrence Valley, Hokkaido, the Baltic, and Cen-
tral Russia, involve "Arctic" problems for mili-
tary purposes. 
The topography of the Arctic varies from the 
broad plains in Russia, parts of Siberia, and 
around Hudson Bay to the high plateaus of Green-
land and Tibet, and towering mountain ranges. 
often poorly mapped, in the Yukon, Alaska, 
northeastern Siberia, Kamchatka, the Himalayas, 
Pamirs, Altai, and Hindu Kush. The Antarctic, 
largely ice covered like Greenland, includes high 
plateaus and towering mountain ranges in some 
areas. 
Drainage is a major geographical factor in the 
Arctic. Many of the greatest rivers of the world, 
such as the Mackenzie, Yukon, Ob, Yenesei, and 
Lena, are not only Arctic but flow in a generally 
northerly direction. Many major rivers of China, 
Southeast Asia, and India-Pakistan have their 
sources in Tibet. Overland travel in the Arctic 
is generally easier in winter than in summer, for 
tractor trains can travel on the frozen rivers. 
With the coming of summer the river mouths to 
the north are still frozen while the southerly 
reaches thaw and overrun the banks to form vast 
lakes in the valleys. Canoes with portage from 
one body of water to the next are a principal 
means of transport. The frozen surface of winter 
turns into an impassable bog for tracked vehicles

in the summer because the frozen subsoil prevents 
adequate drainage. Roads or railways built across 
such terrain need new ballast season after season 
and even so trains frequently are derailed. The 
epic struggle of the Canadian Government in 
building the Hudson Bay Railway to Port 
Churchill is an example of transport difficulties. 
Coasts and landing beaches in the Arctic vary 
from those which are eminently suitable in all re-
spects for amphibious landings to those which are 
impossible because of forbidding overhanging 
cliffs. Most are open and exposed, although 
Greenland, Iceland, and Norway have deep fjords. 
By our definition the true Arctic areas are de-
void of forest cover. Some are glacial like the 
interior of Greenland, northern Baffinland, North-
ern Novaya Zemlya, Ellesmere Land, and Ant-
arctica; more are tundra that offers no real cover, 
but in the summer may include edible berries and 
a profusion of wild flowers. The subarctic's 
forests are scrub growth and often extremely diffi-
cult of passage either for vehicles or men on foot. 
The hydrographic conditions of the Arctic are 
of special naval concern. In contrast to the con-
tinental land mass at the South Pole surrounded 
by shelf ice and stormy seas, the Arctic is a shal-
low sea basin surrounded by land with entrances 
at Bering Straits, through the northern Canadian 
archipelago or from the Atlantic approaches near 
Greenland, Spitzbergen, and Novaya Zemlya. 
The great ice pack is virtually impassable to ships. 
Those caught in it, if they escape destruction, over 
a period of many months may move hundreds 
of miles with the clockwise drift of the ice and 
emerge at another point. Due to the pressures of 
current and wind the ice piles in ridges and irregu-
lar masses. A few parts of the pack are flat and 
thick and the possibility of using them as floating 
air bases has been exploited by both the Russians 
and ourselves. Winter shore ice builds out from 
bays in virtually all of the Arctic Ocean to meet 
the permanent ice pack and also closes much of 
Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, Hudson Bay, the 
Baltic and even parts of the Caspian and Sea of 
Azov. Icebergs from Greenland's fjords move far 
south and constitute a hazard in the North At-
lantic shipping lanes. The classic example was 
the Titanic disaster. 
In the short summer season cracks open in the 
289196-54 ---10 
129 
ice pack near shore, and ships may be able to 
make their way through the northwest passage 
around North America and the northeast passage 
around Eurasia. Usually, such ships are specially 
strengthened, are of shallow draft to allow them 
to use the primitive ports, and are preceded by 
powerful icebreakers to clear the way. Aerial 
reconnaissance minimizes the chances of being 
caught and crushed, but a change in the wind may 
often bring that threat. Amphibious landings 
can be quite difficult if ice close to shore will not 
support heavy equipment, or if storms have blown 
up a great barrier of tumbled ice on the beach. 
A sudden storm may trap both big ships and 
landing craft by driving the ice pack toward shore 
and thus removing the frequently limited open 
water. 
The life forms found in the Arctic are of special 
interest to men awaiting rescue. In the extreme 
north there may be polar bears, walrus, and seals, 
but the interior of Antarctica offers little. Es-
kimos manage to live in good health on meat and 
blubber, and so can military personnel if it is 
necessary. Farther south there are many small 
animals, fish, and in summer birds that can be 
trapped or shot by the trained men. 
It is the weather of course, that offers the great-
est challenge to military operations and survival. 
The temperature range is from over 90? F. in the 
summer in the Yukon Valley to a winter ? 90? F. 
in northeastern Siberia. In the subarctic, summer 
is a time of torment because of flies and mosquitoes. 
Snow and fog may cut visibility for many days 
or weeks on end, affording cover but also limiting 
travel or navigation. The aurora borealis (or 
australis at the south pole) restricts radio recep-
tion. Compasses are unreliable and it is to be 
remembered that the magnetic poles neither coin-
cide with the geographic nor are they entirely 
fixed. Daylight and darkness conditions, reach-
ing the extreme of 6 months of day and 6 of dark 
have important implications both for observation 
and for morale. In winter cold, all human move-
ments are slowed by the protective clothing worn. 
Logistics needs are increased by the kind of hous-
ing required and the greater quantities of fuel and 
food consumed. 
Urban geography of the Arctic is largely Soviet, 
for the only cities of importance in the area are

Russian and Siberian. They have tried to develop 
mining, lumbering, and commerce along the north-
east passage as well as building military bases. 
Aside from some Alaskan and Canadian mining 
and trapping, and the new military bases, perhaps 
the most important economic development in the 
free world Arctic has been the uranium discoveries 
near Great Bear Lake. In the approaches of the 
Antarctic it is the international rivalries of the 
whaling industry that are of particular interest. 
In summary, the great circle routes across the 
Arctic represent the most direct flight lines for 
strategic bombers and guided missiles to reach the 
key populated and industrial regions on earth. 
The Arctic then is of great concern for aviators 
who must navigate across it and who may be forced 
down in it. It is of further concern as an area for 
detection and interception of such air strikes. It 
is also an area rich in mineral resources awaiting 
exploitation. Finally, it requires continued study 
as a route of travel and invasion by military forces. 
Its problems are being solved with growing skill, 
ingenuity, and confidence. The requirements of 
its climate have produced new developments in 
housing and weapons. 
TRANSPORTATION AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
INTELLIGENCE 
A second major component of intelligence 
knowledge is that of transportation and telecom-
munications. Information about these facilities 
in all parts of the world is needed for planning 
both our strategy at the highest echelons and tac-
tics at lower command levels. All forms of such 
intelligence are used on occasion by the Navy, even 
though other agencies collect and process much of 
the information. 
Ports and Harbors 
Port and harbor intelligence includes every con-
ceivable type of information on these facilities. 
Harbors refer to natural locations that may be used 
as anchorages by ships or as protection and setting 
for man-made port facilities. Harbors may be 
bays, rivers, or combinations of both. When a 
port completely lacks protection and shoreside 
berthing facilities, it is called a roadstead. Some 
ports have been created by means of artificial har-
bors. In the broad sense, a port includes not only 
CONFIDENTIAL 
130 
the piers and wharves used by shipping, but also 
all the transfer, storage, and land transportation 
facilities used in connection with shipping. In 
fact a port area includes frequently a considerable 
tributary area with manufacturing, fuel and water 
facilities, banking and customs houses; that is, the 
whole range of the appurtenances of modern 
commerce. 
Sources of information on ports are numerous. 
Naval observers, as described in chapter 9, can col-
lect some port information. Commercial steam-
ship companies collect much information, too, for 
their own operations. Individual masters and 
sometimes crew members make reports to their 
governments as needed to supplement collection. 
There are various chamber of commerce and port 
commission studies available for the asking, as well 
as tourist guides, foreign government maps, com-
mercial photographs, and data from business 
houses supplying foreign orders. All are useful 
sources of information. 
Port data are so complex and detailed that most 
naval powers prepare specific port studies on in-
dividual foreign ports. This is a Navy responsi-
bility in our country, but the Navy is not the sole 
user. The Army needs such data for establishing 
ports of embarkation. The Navy needs to know 
what servicing facilities would be available to the 
fleet. Some foreign ports are studied for their 
military or commercial importance and vulnerabil-
ity to attack. During wartime the individual uses 
of ports may give many clues to the enemy's 
activities. 
Shipping 
Ocean shipping is the principal means for the 
bulk movement of freight internationally. It is 
characterized by the large tonnage carried by in-
dividual ships at very low ton-mile costs, fre-
quently over very great distances. The routes 
most vital to this commerce of the world are: (1) 
the North Atlantic from Canada and the United 
States to the English Channel, North Sea or Medi-
terranean areas; (2) the Suez route through the 
Mediterranean to India, Australia or the Far 
East; (3) the South Atlantic route from Europe 
and North America to Argentina; (4) the South 
Africa run from Europe or North America to 
South and East Africa with extensions to Aus-

COMPONENTS OF INTELLIGENCE KNOWLEDGE CONFIDENTIAL 
tralia and Indian Ocean points; (5) the trans-
pacific routes from North America to Asia; (6) 
the Panama routes linking many continents and 
several coasts. 
A handful of countries build most ships and 
these same countries are the principal operators of 
substantial numbers of ships. The United States, 
Britain, and Norway are the three big operators, 
though in time Japan and Germany may regain 
their former positions. 
The Navy is concerned not only with the areas 
where ships operate and with the total carrying 
capacity of various merchant fleets, but also with 
the building capacity of various shipyards and the 
repair facilities. Because of its operational and 
strategic needs, it must also know the speed, age, 
tonnage, dimensions, appearance, fuel, draft, 
ownership, location, and use of every individual 
merchant ship in the world. 
Collection of most shipping information is 
largely a matter of organization and thoroughness, 
and most of it can be derived from regular com-
mercial information services. Lloyd's Register 
provides ship particulars and Lloyd's List gives 
vessel movements. A series of trade journals in 
Britain, the United States, France, Japan, and 
other countries report building, give vessel plans 
and pictures, discuss trends in chartering, marine 
insurance, rates, conference agreements, and so 
forth. It is only the Iron Curtain countries which 
hide or disguise their shipping information thus 
requiring other nations to take special measures 
in order to develop comprehensive worldwide re-
ports on merchant vessels. 
Shipping intelligence has many forms. It may 
be absorbed into other intelligence as a part of a 
larger subject. Summary statistics of all sorts are 
prepared, and card indexes of vessel activity and 
large wall plots showing estimated location of all 
vessels are used for operational purposes. 
The uses of shipping intelligence are many. 
Any blockade operations require detailed ship 
movement information together with manifest 
data. Protection of shipping against submarines 
and aircraft requires location data. When an H-
bomb hidden in a nondescript neutral freighter 
becomes a possibility, shipping intelligence needs 
will be further increased. 
Railways 
Since railways represent the principal arteries 
of land transport and have the greatest tonnage 
capacity for movement overland from place to 
place, they are of considerable military interest. 
The Transportation Corps of the Army is chiefly 
responsible for collection and processing of land 
transportation data. Essential informational 
needs include detailed maps of the lines, descrip-
tions of bridges and tunnels, a working timetable, 
a gradient profile chart, and lists of motive power 
and rolling stock. Even though a railway may 
seem relatively static, its capacity is affected by 
many factors: the maintenance and improvement 
of the right of way (including ballast, ties, rails), 
the addition of automatic block signals or train 
control, the realinement of track to ease ruling 
grades and reduce curvature, the strengthening of 
bridges, the switch to new motive power such as 
dieselization or electrification, and the traffic load 
with its seasonal and directional differences. 
Data may come from newspaper stories, the 
order books of equipment manufacturers, trade 
statistics, and trade journals such as the Railway 
Gazette published in London, which is the best for 
world coverage. Information from behind the 
Iron Curtain is harder to obtain, but there are 
publicly announced 5-year plans, radio broadcasts 
of new construction and attainment of traffic goals, 
and the reports of refugees. 
The use to which such information is put varies. 
It may contribute to a strategic estimate involving 
a country's capability to meet overall war require-
ments or provide specific data concerning the coun-
try's ability to move forces to a particular front. 
The Navy is interested in many details on rail-
ways, arising out of such matters as the movement 
of landing craft or submarine subassemblies over 
particular lines that may or may not have limited 
clearances. Preliminary to an amphibious land-
ing the Navy may have air support missions which 
will include selecting railway targets such as tun-
nels, bridges, and yards. For both amphibious 
and land operations, similar targets are sometimes 
involved in connection with naval gunfire support. 
The success of naval ships in providing gunfire 
support to land operations during the Korean War 
illustrates naval use of intelligence regarding both 
railway systems and roads.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Roads 
Roads generally serve as feeders to railway 
lines, although in a few parts of the world they 
constitute an independent, fairly usable network. 
They have the military advantages of reaching 
more places than railways and being more flexible 
in alternate routes. If trees block a road, vehicles 
occasionally can drive through fields around the 
obstacle. Most military transport organic to land 
units is intended for road use. In most foreign 
countries roads are typically poor by American 
standards, having a low tonnage capacity and a 
rapid deterioration rate. Maintenance thus be-
comes a problem when they are used for heavy 
military traffic. 
Road maps are available in most foreign coun-
tries, but they are frequently inaccurate, and their 
condition is subject to change with the seasons. 
Road reports should not only describe the seasonal 
condition of roads, bridges, and shoulders, but 
should also note the availability of surfacing mate-
rials, local labor, and repair machinery. Bridges, 
steep grades, and narrow single lanes are typical 
limiting factors to the usefulness of a road. 
Pipelines 
The bulk movement of petroleum, gas, and water 
is increasingly being accomplished by pipeline. 
Modern technology permits the dispatching of 
several different products in succession through a 
line with metering, sampling, and water plugs to 
keep each one separate. A recent development is 
the use of radioactive isotopes to identify particu-
lar shipments by Geiger counter. 
Pipelines represent a mass means of delivery 
relatively free from interference by weather. 
Underground lines are reasonably safe from at-
tack, but the pumping stations, storage tank farms, 
and other surface installations remain vulnerable 
points. 
Pipelines may have more than economic signifi-
cance. Some United States lines, for example, 
represented a countermove against German sub-
marine attacks. Others in Burma, France, and 
Alaska provided direct tactical support. Aerial 
reconnaissance will usually reveal the construction 
of new lines, but lacking that opportunity, infor-
mation on the manufacture and delivery of the 
necessary pipes and pumps will give many clues. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
132 
Inland Waterways 
Inland waterways in many foreign countries are 
a major element in the transportation system. 
Their usefulness depends upon their general loca-
tion and direction of flow. The current, control-
ling depth, turns, constancy of channel, subjec-
tivity to freezing, bridge clearances, and cargo 
transfer facilities are important details. Reports 
on foreign waterways are processed primarily by 
the Army Transportation Corps, and the sources 
of information are official documents of foreign 
governments and direct observation. From them 
are obtained answers to logistics questions. Aerial 
mining of waterways, and destruction of locks or 
dams by bombing can be made possible through 
adequate intelligence. 
Aviation 
Civil aviation rightly comes under the general 
cognizance of air intelligence. Although avia-
tion competes with railways only in countries 
where railways are lacking, it is important to know 
the role it plays in the rapid movement of critical 
freight and personnel. Today, airlines under 
many flags not only blanket their home countries, 
but extend internationally into far reaches of the 
earth. Thus they also provide a unique instrument 
for observation and collection of information. 
Our own widespread aviation interests are in a 
position to report on foreign aviation progress 
everywhere this side of the Iron Curtain. Trade 
journals in many languages are likewise extremely 
helpful. We are interested in new transport air-
craft performance and production, the frequency, 
reliability, and control of air lines, the provision 
of navigation aids and. airfields, and the training 
of personnel. In time of war or other emergencies, 
commercial aircraft and aviation facilities play 
important auxiliary roles. The degree of subsi-
dization of aviation may give clues to intended 
use. Deutsche Lufthansa went so far as to con-
vert "commercial" Ju-52's into bombers and para-

own large interests in aviation make all such in-
telligence of considerable interest. 
Telecommunications 
Telecommunications include telegraph, tele-
phone, radio, television, cable, and all related serv-
ices and equipment. Each type of signal has its 
own advantages and disadvantages of cost, avail-
ability, secrecy, range, number of channels, and 
so forth. While the National Security Agency 
is the agency with direct cognizance over intelli-
gence in this field, earlier references to the collec-
tion of intelligence from communication sources 
indicate the importance of such information to all 
branches of the military service. 
The interruption of communications in any mod-
ern state, especially a highly centralized one, can 
bring its national life to a standstill. Such sys-
tems thus become prime targets in war. Further, 
an understanding of the various channels of sig-
nal traffic is basic to maintaining the security of 
classified information. Therefore, knowledge of 
a nation's telecommunications is helpful for a 
variety of purposes. 
Information on world systems comes from such 
sources as trade journals, records of purchases of 
new equipment from leading manufacturers, and, 
of course, observation and the piecing together of 
many bits of information. 
SOCIOLOGICAL INTELLIGENCE 
Sociology is the study of man and his human 
environment. It deals with all the phenomena 
arising out of the group relations of human beings. 
There is still some disagreement whether sociology 
has reached a stage of development which would 
entitle it to rank as a science, but it is uniformly 
recognized that the methods used in sociological 
research and the conclusions reached may be 
strictly scientific when based on extensive observa-
tion and careful analysis. 
In the introduction to this chapter it was stated 
that no one of the eight components of strategic 
intelligence can be considered alone; they are all 
interdependent and closely interwoven. This is 
particularly true of the sociological component 
which is closely allied to the geographical, politi-
cal, and economic, and which strongly affects 
armed forces, particularly with relation to man-
1,33 
power. The cultural traditions of a people and 
their intellectual achievements based on a sound 
educational program, have tremendous effect on 
their scientific capabilities. Sociological assess-
ment of a nation also embraces anthropological 
and psychological factors. 
The aspects of sociological intelligence which 
are important to military planners are those which 
determine the military potential of a nation, but 
the analyst will soon find that his task is in no way 
restricted. True interpretation must weigh all 
facets of sociological significance, and it is im-
possible to ignore any of them. 
The importance of sociological intelligence has 
never been more clearly evident to Americans than 
in recent years, for the understanding of foreign 
peoples has become essential to the successful ad-
ministration of American aid programs all over 
the world, both civil and military. Throughout 
their service careers naval personnel visit many 
foreign ports, and those on special naval missions, 
stationed at bases abroad, and on attache duty are 
intimately associated in their daily life, profes-
sionally and socially, with people whose culture, 
customs, and traditions are different from their 
own. An appreciation of the forces and factors 
which govern the behavior of foreign peoples is 
therefore a prime objective of sociological intelli-
gence. All naval officers, and particularly those in 
intelligence activities, can with profit be avid stu-
dents of sociology as it applies to the assessment of 
the capabilities, vulnerabilities, and probable 
courses of action of a foreign country. 
The sociological component comprises the fol-
lowing major considerations: Population; charac-
teristics of the people; religion, education, and 
public information; morale and public opinion; 
health and public welfare. A brief examination 
will be made of the significance of these elements 
in sociological intelligence. 
Population 
Intelligence on the population of a country is 
much more than a mere numerical count. To be 
valuable it must provide data on density and 
geographical distribution; classification by age 
groups and sex; growth or decline; immigration 
and emigration; future trends and government 
policies which affect population problems. Sta-

tistics are given meaning through interpretation 
by averages and percentages, and by comparison 
with familiar standards. Populations in many 
countries of the world since World War II show 
marked departure from the patterns of past dec-
ades, and it has become increasingly important to 
obtain up-to-date information before coming to 
any conclusions. 
Lt. Col. Robert C. White makes some pertinent 
observations on population change in an article 
entitled "Sociological Factors in Strategic Intel-
ligence" published in the Military Review, No-
vember 1949: 
From an intelligence standpoint, it is the 
increase, stability, or decline in the size of a 
population upon which we first focus our in-
terest. The future size of the population of a 
foreign nation may be of more importance 
to us than its present size. Knowledge of 
future size will help us keep our estimate of 
a foreign power's war potential correct. 
Consider what has been happening to the 
world's population in the past 150 years. We 
are living in a period of unparalleled (but 
uneven) growth in the world's population. 
Since 1800, the population of the world as 
a whole has more than doubled. This rapid, 
almost explosive, growth first started in 
Europe, where the population since 1800 has 
trebled. The number of Chinese and Jap-
anese has increased greatly, also, but their 
increase did not commence until well after the 
middle of the nineteenth century. In other 
regions, the timing of rapid population 
growth has varied. 
The clue to rapid population growth is to 
be found in the changing relationship be-
tween birth rates and death rates. Before 
the Industrial Revolution, high birth rates al-
most negated high death rates, and there was 
little natural growth in population. The ef-
fects of the Industrial Revolution?in raising 
standards of living, sanitation, and health, 
and therefore in reducing infant mortality 
and in increasing life expectancy?were felt 
first in Western Europe, the United States, 
and Canada. Therefore, the populations of 
these areas increased rapidly during the nine-
teenth century. However, in more recent 
decades, because of cultural changes, such as 
the decline of the large family ideal, for ex-
ample, there has been a drop in the birth rate. 
Thus, the margin between birth and death 
rates has been narrowing. The tendencies in 
these areas, therefore, is for population to 
level off, even to decline. With the extension 
CONFIDENTIAL 
134 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
of modern industrialization, sanitation, and. 
medical care to other parts of the world, this 
same pattern of changing death and birth rate 
has appeared. Thus, China, India, the Soviet 
Union, and other areas more recently affected 
by industrialization are now in the stage of 
population growth that was characteristic of 
Western Europe several generations ago. It 
is likely that they, too, will in time pass into 
the stage of stable or even declining popu-
lation. 
The intelligence analyst is also concerned with 
a nation's labor force and available military man-
power. He must know the age-sex distribution of 
the population, the number of males and females 
of a given age or within a certain age group. The 
labor force is found between the ages of 15 and 
65, while military manpower can be derived from 
the number of males between the ages of 15 and 
45, with particular emphasis on the 18 to 35 group. 
There can be considerable margin of error in these 
statistics if account is not taken of those who may 
be disqualified for either labor or military service 
by reason of physical disability. 
The geographical distribution and density of 
population are further vital considerations in so-
ciological intelligence. The density of population 
per square mile of arable land has much more in-
telligence significance than the density per square 
mile of total land. The concentration of popula-
tion in certain areas of a country is likewise valu-
able knowledge. Since, for example, a sixth of 
the population of Argentina is located in Buenos 
Aires, destruction of her capital city would be a 
crippling blow to that country. 
Population analysis (demography) requires ex-
pert understanding of statistical terms and the 
methods employed in the compilation of data. 
Progressive countries of the world have govern-
ment sponsored census bureaus and keep popula-
tion registers, but less than a third of the world's 
population has ever been officially counted or reg-
istered. Some peoples of the world are just not 
age conscious. An American or European child 
when questioned will readily report his age to 
the fine degree of 61/4 or 13 years 5 months. In 
the villages of the Orient the same question will 
be greeted with either a blank stare or a smiling: 
"I don't know."

home front have placed new emphasis upon their 
contribution to the usable portion or manpower 
factor of a nation's total population. This brings 
us to a consideration of the entire situation with 
respect to labor in the country: wages, working 
conditions, organization, legislation, and control. 
The government policies on population control 
often are responsible in many countries for con-
siderable shifts in population. The development 
of new industries or the exploitation of newly 
discovered resources can also cause internal move-
ments of large numbers of people, and will require 
reassessment of population distribution. 
Characteristics of the People 
In studying a nation's people, the intelligence 
officer must identify and evaluate those racial, 
ethnic, and cultural characteristics which are 
sources of national strength or weakness. He must 
determine the sociological forces which cause dis-
sension among them, resentment against the gov-
ernment, or susceptibility to psychological in-
fluence from abroad. The latter will be discussed 
fully in the section of this text entitled Psycho-
logical Operations. 
Race and nationality are not synonymous terms. 
There is no German race or French race or Chinese 
race. The anthropological classification of race 
is in three main divisions: Caucasian, Mongolian, 
and Negro. These are further divided into sub-
races characterized by such physical characteristics 
as shape of skull, color of hair or complexion, stat-
ure, facial structure, and physical vigor. Few 
nations of the world have a population of only one 
race. Most are a mixture; for example, the white 
population of the United States and European 
nations comprises a mixture of three of the Cau-
casian subraces, and there are many Mongolian 
subraces in the Chinese nation. If a country's 
population is composed of more than one main 
race, there is always a possibility of internal strife 
and racial discrimination. Hitler, for example, 
effectively used the idea of an "Aryan" super-race 
to develop a feeling of racial superiority among 
the Germans. The tragic consequences of this 
doctrine are a blot on the history of Europe. 
Ethnic groups, another important consideration 
in sociological intelligence, are people bound to-
gether by ties and traits of both race and 
nationality. In the United States, for example, 
there are large communities in various sections of 
the country composed of such ethnic groups as 
Czechs, Poles, Irish, Swedes, and Finns. Ethnic 
groups often maintain, at least for two or three 
generations even in America, the customs, tradi-
tions, religion, and language of their forefathers, 
and assimilation into the nation to which they have 
migrated is completed only after several centuries. 
The countries of Europe provide similar examples: 
the Germans of Alsace-Lorraine, the Swedish eth-
nic group in Finland, and the Serbs of the old 
Austro-Hungarian Empire. In Asia the Parsees 
of India are a striking example of how a people, 
originally Persian, have become a force in the com-
mercial and industrial development of the country 
of their chosen residence. 
The presence of such groups in a nation may 
weaken national solidarity, or make a nation vul-
nerable to psychological warfare. It may also re-
sult in violent hatred and prejudice. During 
World War I, for example, German-Americans in 
many communities were the innocent victims of 
slander and even mob violence. 
The cultural characteristics of a people are those 
derived from language, social structure, social 
values and patterns of living, artistic and intel-
lectual expression. Differences in thinking and 
acting occur to the extent to which such forces 
control or influence collective behavior. The 
presence in appreciable numbers of aristocrat and 
peasant, clergy of strongly opposed religious sects, 
intellectuals, artists, and illiterates in a nation's 
population are significant subjects for sociological 
intelligence. Careful examination of these ele-
ments yields greater understanding of a people's 
history, customs, and traditions and is essential to 
evaluation of public opinion, attitudes toward 
foreigners, and national morale. 
Religion 
Religion has always been a potent force in the 
history of the world, and religious differences have 
caused much war and strife. "There is no God 
but Allah, and Mohammed is his prophet" became 
the war-cry of Moslem hosts, the bloody Thirty 
Years War between Catholic and Protestant arm-
ies in 17th century Europe, and in our own time 
the Moslem-Jewish struggle for the control of

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Palestine, as well as the Moslem-Hindu riots in 
India and the formation of Pakistan attest to the 
influence religion has upon the actions of men. 
In many countries the constitution establishes a 
state religion, and religious sects are powerful 
political parties. 
The intelligence researcher often finds the an-
swer to problems of national attitudes by analyz-
ing the tenets of the religion of dominant or 
minority groups. Religion can determine the 
moral fiber of a nation or it can produce social 
handicaps which become strategic vulnerabilities. 
Often a well organized church or religious group 
supports numerous schools at all educational levels, 
and makes a valuable contribution to the improve-
ment of social conditions and the rehabilitation of 
social unfortunates. 
Education 
Education has always been a measure of prog-
ress. The strategic significance of education has 
become even more pronounced in this modern age 
of scientific and technical achievement. A na-
tion's technical capabilities will be governed by 
the extent to which it can produce men and women 
with technical skill, and the cultural level of its 
people will be determined by the extent to which 
a spirit of scientific inquiry and academic freedom 
are fostered by its government and society. 
Intelligence on education must be specific in 
order to be usable: the number of schools at all 
levels of education; the number enrolled and the 
number graduated; the curricula and teaching 
methods; the qualifications of faculties; the con-
trolling and accrediting agencies; and in the field 
of higher education, the distribution of graduates 
by subject of specialization. It is important to 
know, for example, that a given country is produc-
ing engineers and physicists at an accelerated rate, 
or that there is a shortage of trained teachers in 
the secondary schools. Adult education by exten-
sion courses and evening trade schools must also 
be evaluated. 
The number of students engaged in graduate 
study at institutions in other countries and the 
use which is made of them upon their return may 
be of great significance in a sociological estimate 
of a nation. This is of special interest to America, 
CONFIDENTIAL 
136 
since we have increasing numbers of foreign stu-
dents attending our colleges and universities. The 
question is: What happens to them when they go 
home? Will their experience influence the thought 
of their fellow countrymen? 
Public Information and Opinion 
Intelligence interest here centers in the methods 
of disseminating news and the influence upon na-
tional attitudes exercised by newspapers, maga-
zines, radio programs, and motion pictures. Are 
the people left free to form their opinions on what 
they see, hear, and read or are true facts withheld 
through rigid government control of the press and 
other avenues of public information? Do foreign 
publications have a wide circulation and what is 
the extent of any foreign propaganda in the 
country? 
The answers to all these and similar questions 
are invaluable to the sociological analyst. Cer-
tainly in this field he must be constantly aware 
of current trends and possess sufficient background 
to assess them in the light of the people's history 
and traditions. 
Health 
Information for intelligence on health condi-
tions in a foreign country is concerned not only 
with the health of the indigenous population but 
also with the effect of health and sanitation con-
ditions upon foreign troops which may operate 
in the area. Environmental factors such as to-
pography and climate, nutrition and dietary hab-
its, plant and animal life, and the food supply 
situation all pose problems for the military 
analyst. Can an invading force live off the land? 
Is there an abundance of potable water? Will 
special installations be necessary for garbage and 
waste disposal or are existing utilities adaptable? 
Medical intelligence has an important role to 
play in determining the prevalence of disease, par-
ticularly those to which an invading army would 
be exposed. Will extensive malarial control be 
necessary? Are there certain health regulations, 
quarantine measures, or sanitary precautions to 
consider? The country's medical resources must 
be also evaluated in terms of the number of doc-
tors and nurses, the quantity of medical supplies,

hospitals, and medical training, research, and 
development. 
Public Welfare 
The status of public welfare in a country is an 
important element in sociological intelligence be-
cause it so directly affects the happiness and mental 
attitudes of the people. The standard of living, 
housing, and opportunities for gainful employ-
ment are factors which must be considered. 
Sweden, for example, has no slum areas in her 
large cities, and her government's achievement in 
providing clean and comfortable housing for the 
worker is notable. It has been attained, however/ 
only through high taxation, and many a Swede is 
unhappy because of the tax drain on his pocket-
book. As a result, it may be easy for him to forget 
the great benefits to himself and to the nation 
which accrue from high standards of public 
health and sanitation. 
The evaluation of a standard of living is no easy 
task for the analyst, for the peoples of different 
countries do not place the same value upon certain 
human comforts and possession of certain advan-
tages. The average American family needs an 
automobile; many Europeans consider the posses-
sion of one not only unnecessary, but even a great 
nuisance. We put ice in our drinking water and 
keep our beer in the refrigerator. The average 
Britisher does not like either water or beer that 
cold. Comparison of wages in different countries 
has meaning only when such wages are expressed 
in terms of their buying power within each coun-
try. A dozen eggs in one country may represent 
5 hours of work by a machinist, while in another 
country a machinist would have to work only 1 
hour to earn enough to buy 3 dozen eggs. Other 
commodities, however, may be so much more expen-
sive in the latter country that the machinist may 
not enjoy as high a standard of living as he would 
in the country where eggs are dear. Assessment 
of living standards, therefore, cannot be based on 
limited observations, but must be made from aver-
ages over periods of years, and evaluated in rela-
tion to the entire socio-economic situation of the 
nation. 
Unemployment will always create problems for 
a nation. Crime has a higher incidence, and dis-
satisfaction with the existing government grows 
with the misery of the unemployed. Communism 
feeds upon such conditions. Employment, of 
course, brings prosperity and its attendant com-
fort and happiness. 
The manner in which a foreign country has met 
its public welfare problems is an indication to 
the analyst of strength, vulnerability, and morale. 
A people who enjoy social security and a happy 
daily life are not good subjects for propaganda 
influence from without, and they will combat any 
effort to change their satisfactory status, even to 
the point of armed resistance. 
Sociological intelligence is a fascinating field, 
and deserves more than the summary treatment it 
has received above. The intelligence officer should 
consider the aspects so briefly discussed as an 
introduction and inspiration for more intensive 
reading and study. The philosopher's observation 
that "the most interesting thing to man is man" 
has real significance in intelligence, and the study 
of foreign peoples in relation to one's own socio-
logical heritage has its reward in furthering the 
cause of international understanding and peace. 
137 
POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE 
Political intelligence on a foreign country is an 
evaluation of the effectiveness of its government 
in achieving the national objectives of its people, 
both domestically and in foreign relations. It is 
an assessment of the political strength and inter-
national influence of the nation in respect to unity, 
stability, and efficiency, as well as the determina-
tion of the degree to which its government repre-
sents the will of the people. The political com-
ponent of strategic intelligence is closely associ-
ated with the sociological and economic, for 
government exercises a profound influence on the 
economic and social life of a people, and con-
versely its nature is to a large extent established 
by economic and social forces. 
The purpose of this section is to delineate the 
elements essential to a political estimate of any 
foreign country: the constitutional system, gov-
ernmental structure, political dynamics, national 
policies, and the way in which its government pro-
vides for public order, safety, and security, con-
trols subversive activity, obtains intelligence, and 
disseminates information.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
The Constitutional System 
Governments derive their powers from consti-
tutions or codes of laws which set up the basic 
framework and describe the rights and privileges 
of the individual citizen. A constitution is not 
necessarily a single written document. The Brit-
ish "constitution," for example, is largely an un-
written code built upon custom and usage. A 
consideration of the constitutional system of a 
country begins with a study of its origin and devel-
opment. What political, economic, or social 
groups dominated political thought at the time 
of its adoption? To what extent does it reflect 
the public opinion of that time? Oftentimes the 
circumstances under which a constitution was for-
mulated endow it with lasting respect and author-
ity. The principles of a constitution in theory 
are often quite different from its principles in 
practice. Attention must be given to its flexibility 
and the ease with which it can be amended. Have 
there been disagreements as to its interpretation? 
What economic and social provisions does it con-
tain? Are there any unusual provisions? The 
American Constitution, which establishes execu-
tive, legislative, and judicial branches of govern-
ment, has served as a model for constitutional 
systems of later origin in all parts of the world, 
but in various countries, the powers granted to the 
different branches and the rights of citizens will 
vary widely. In some republics the chief executive 
may be a mere figurehead; in others he may have 
dictatorial power. Prime ministers often exercise 
much more leadership and have greater responsi-
bilities than kings. The office of prime minister 
can be most precarious for it is usually dependent 
upon the support of a majority in the legislature 
and failure is followed by the resignation of the 
prime minister and his cabinet. 
Legislatures will vary in composition and effec-
tiveness. When two houses are provided for by 
the constitution, one may be more advisory than 
legislative in function, and it may have a history 
of gradual weakness, such as the House of Lords 
in Great Britain. The Senate of the United States, 
on the other hand, has always had more power 
and prestige than the House of Representatives, 
but the Speaker of the House can succeed to the 
Presidency. 
A strong judicial branch of an established gov-
CONFIDENTIAL 
138 
ernment will exercise tremendous influence in 
maintaining the spirit of the constitution, even 
though its interpretations will reflect the coun-
try's economic and social changes. The strength 
of the judiciary will usually be determined by its 
independence of thought and action insofar as it 
can resist political pressure and the lobbying of 
special interest groups. The confidence of the 
people in government is largely controlled by the 
judgments of the courts when their powers are 
exercised in a way that is an effective check on 
both executive and legislative branches. 
The civil and religious rights of citizens guaran-
teed by the constitution are important considera-
tions in a political estimate, not only in theory but 
in practice. Freedom of speech, press, religion, 
and the rights of assembly and trial by jury so dear 
to the American citizen do not find exact counter-
parts in the constitutions of all other countries. 
Important also are the rights and privileges ex-
tended to foreigners in the country. Can they 
move about freely, and engage in business enter-
prises with the same protection accorded to 
nationals? The Americans are very jealous of 
their "constitutional rights" and justly proud of 
their political heritage. The analyst must make an 
assessment of the presence or absence of similar 
feelings among foreign peoples and the extent to 
which they would tolerate any abrogation of par-
ticular political rights. 
Structure of the Government 
The consideration here is of organization and 
procedure in central, regional, and local govern-
ment. It is an evaluation of the government in 
operation. Are there any conditions or situations 
which have required special organizations or oper-
ations by the government and are practices at vari-
ance with the provisions of the constitution? 
What are the major agencies of each branch of the 
government and how do they operate? What are 
the significant features of regional and local gov-
ernment organization? Often an understanding 
of the political forces of local government is essen-
tial to the evaluation of the government as a whole. 
Many countries have colonies or dependencies 
which must also be examined in their relations to 
the mother country, including their own govern-
mental structure. International relationships

such as participation and membership in the 
United Nations Organization or any regional pacts 
may have important influences on a political sys-
tem through the creation of special commissions. 
The operations of such agencies can have a decided 
impact upon internal affairs as well as formulate 
national attitudes toward other countries and in-
crease support for cooperative endeavors. 
Political Dynamics 
The extent to which the people participate in 
political activity, their fitness for political respon-
sibility, the sources of political power, the electoral 
and political party systems are some of the main 
factors to assess in a political estimate of a foreign 
country. The major political parties must be eval-
uated, taking into consideration their membership, 
program or special interests, organization, and 
methods of propaganda. 
Throughout his study of these aspects of politi-
cal life, the analyst will find that comparisons 
with American counterparts will give meaning 
and perspective. He cannot merely ascertain the 
constitutional framework which sets up the party 
system, but must note actual practices, both his-
torical and current. Pressure groups within par-
ties, lobbying tactics, the amount of money avail-
able and expended for promotional purposes, and 
the manner in which the objectives of such pres-
sure groups affect American interests are essential 
considerations. 
The biographic component of strategic intelli-
gence is here effectively applied. The personali-
ties, qualities of leadership, and motivations of 
prominent politicians will provide the answer to 
many problems of changing political influence. 
National Policies 
The intelligence significance of knowledge of 
a country's domestic and foreign policies will be 
made apparent in succeeding chapters in their dis-
cussion of the economic, sociological, and political 
factors which determine a country's position in 
the community of nations. The interplay of these 
factors will be shown in the examination of United 
States foreign policy and the relationship of party 
and government in the U. S. S. R. Detailed treat-
ment of important elements of national policy is 
therefore superfluous here. 
139 
Suffice to say, military intelligence is particu-
larly concerned with those policies pertaining to 
national defense and their influence on domestic 
and foreign policies. Are the military establish-
ment and civilian lawmaking bodies in agreement 
on what defense policies should be? To what ex-
tent do the various branches of government in-
fluence or decide defense policies? What is the 
popular reaction to defense policies? Do the 
people accept rearmament programs, conscription, 
food rationing, and production controls with forti-
tude or do such defense measures result in much 
grumbling, support of black markets, or actual 
rebellion? 
Again the influence of individual leaders, both 
within their own party and on the populace as 
a whole, can be studied with profit. 
Public Order and Safety 
Within the scope of political intelligence are 
those organizations which maintain public order 
and safety, that is, the police and penal systems. 
Is the police system adequate in size, well-organ-
ized at all levels of government, and effective in 
protecting citizens against lawless elements of so.. 
ciety ? The strategic analyst would also be con-
cerned with the morale of the police force, the in-
tegrity of law-enforcement officers, and the extent 
to which the system is susceptible to political in-
fluence. If the police of a large city, for example, 
are controlled by a certain politician and used 
for furthering his political ambitions, the fact 
should be carefully noted. The attitude of the 
average citizen towards law enforcement is also 
significant. 
Consideration of the penal system would in-
clude not only its organization and operation, but 
also criminal codes, trial procedures, incidence of 
crime, conditions in prisons and reformatories, and 
the effort made by social forces in the country to 
rehabilitate felons and juvenile delinquents. In 
this respect there is considerable overlapping of 
the political and sociological components. 
Subversive Activity 
Active or latent subversive groups in a country 
are exceedingly important factors in the assess-
ment of weaknesses in its political system. The 
presence of subversive activity in political parties,

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
labor organizations, or government agencies can 
profoundly affect the operation of the political, 
economic, and social forces of the nation. In recent 
years we have seen the results achieved by Com-
munist subversive activity in Poland, Czechoslo-
vakia, Hungary, and Rumania. We have also seen 
in the case of Italy, how a people aroused to its 
menace can keep Communists from obtaining con-
trol by defeating them at the polls. The extent to 
which subversive elements have penetrated or in-
filtrated a country is thus the analyst's concern. 
He must identify the subversive groups and show 
how they operate. An innocuous appearing 
society for the improvement of cultural relations 
with the U. S. S. R., with a membership of several 
thousand students, may well be the front organi-
zation of a growing Communist Party, the ulti-
mate objective of which is the overthrow of the 
existing political system. 
The peoples' attitude, their traditions, and the 
economic and social conditions which foster sub-
versive groups must be taken into account. If, 
like the Gallic tribes of Julius Caesar's time, they 
are "conspiring among themselves and eager for 
revolution," intelligence upon the nature, poten-
tial strength, and leadership of such groups is es-
sential. Finally, an estimate must be made of how 
subversive activity of any kind may affect the 
policies of the United States and other world 
powers towards that country. 
Intelligence System 
The United States intelligence system and the 
development of intelligence activity in other coun-
tries of the world have been fully treated in pre-
ceding chapters of this text, and are indicative of 
the scope of the information required. What is 
the mission of each intelligence agency? Are 
funds available for effective operations? What is 
the public attitude towards intelligence activities? 
What is the relationship of the various agencies, 
their methods of operation, and who are the key 
figures in their personnel? 
Propaganda 
Political propaganda may be defined as the dis-
semination of information or ideas designed to in-
fluence the political behavior of the people of a 
country by affecting their beliefs or attitudes con-
CONFIDENTIAL 
140 
cerning facts or values. It may be either direct or 
indirect in approach. The source of control may 
be located in the country itself, such as at the 
permanent headquarters of a political party, or 
it may be directed from outside the country, as for 
example, in the case of Kremlin control of propa-
ganda in a satellite country. 
For strategic intelligence purposes the assess-
ment of political propaganda emphasizes an evalu-
ation of its effectiveness. How much distortion 
of fact will the people accept? It will depend, 
of course, on the degree to which they have op-
portunity for becoming aware of the true facts. 
In a country where the party in power maintains 
rigid control of press and radio the people may 
be kept completely in the dark. If freedom of 
speech is a jealously guarded national heritage, 
the people will be more enlightened and better 
educated politically. Propaganda may then be 
recognized for what it is and may have to be 
disseminated through more subtle media and by 
more indirect means. 
Political propaganda is never more clearly evi-
dent than in an election campaign. The analyst 
can learn much from a careful study of the cam-
paign speeches of leading candidates of opposing 
parties. Often a clever slogan or sobriquet has 
a tremendous psychological effect. 
The effectiveness of the propaganda factor in 
political intelligence can only be evaluated by 
consideration of certain sociological aspects of the 
nation, particularly those discussed in the preced-
ing section entitled "Characteristics of the People." 
Good propaganda will always exploit the racial, 
ethnic, and cultural elements of which national 
character is composed. 
The principles and techniques of propaganda 
will be treated more fully in a later section dealing 
with psychological warfare. 
Political Factors in Strategy 
The ultimate purpose of strategy is to make it 
possible for a nation to approximate its basic 
goals. Its intentions, which are derived from 
these goals, are influenced by a variety of political 
factors. Inevitably, therefore, strategy is affected 
by the same political considerations. Initially, 
of course, those responsible for formulating na-
tional strategy must choose objectives which are

COMPONENTS OF INTELLIGENCE KNOWLEDGE CONFIDENTIAL 
in accord with the basic goals of their own nation 
and with those of its allies. Thereafter, political 
factors must be considered in such matters as esti-
mating the dimensions and timing of war prepara-
tions by a nation and its allies, considering the 
extent of possible losses by the military forces 
which might be acceptable at any given time, and 
selecting instruments of war and the use to be 
made of them. Conversely, in connection with the 
capabilities of the enemy, consideration must be 
given to the effect of political factors on his own 
strategic planning and how these factors may 
cause him to react to a state of war or measures 
short of war. 
Mr. Chester Wilmot, eminent Australian jour-
nalist, has advanced the thesis that much of the 
tension following World War II might be at-
tributed to a failure to take political factors into 
account in strategic planning. He has suggested 
that military strategy is affected both by political 
factors as they develop and by long term political 
objectives. By way of illustrating the influence 
of political factors he has cited the Mediterranean 
campaign of 1943 and the strategic decision of the 
allies to invade Italy. A decision to land troops 
on the Italian coast appeared advantageous be-
cause of the enemy's inferior military strength. 
In addition, however, such a decision was made 
more attractive because Mussolini's political 
strength had become seriously impaired by 1943 
and represented a real weakness in the Axis 
partnership. Thus developing political factors, 
when combined with the military situation, mate-
rially supported the decision made. 
In illustrating the importance of considering 
long term political objectives in the planning of 
strategy, Mr. Wilmot has suggested that a great 
political advantage could have accrued to the 
western allies in the post-World War II period 
had they, rather than the Soviets, liberated Ber-
lin, Prague, and Vienna. A significant power ad-
vantage might have been retained in Germany, 
even if Berlin had been given up later as a result 
of zonal agreements. The effect in Czechoslovakia 
might have been even greater. The mere presence 
of the Red Army in Prague became a source of 
material strength to the Czech Communists and 
undoubtedly affected the negotiations conducted 
between the Benes government and the Soviet 
141 
leaders in Moscow in June 1945. Mr. Wilmot's 
point is that the decisions which resulted in the 
halting of the allied advance into Germany and 
Central Europe might well have taken into greater 
consideration the possible progress of events after 
the war was over. 
These illustrations suggest the importance of 
political intelligence and the variety of tasks 
which must be performed in connection with it. 
Since military strategy and politics are insepara-
ble, the naval intelligence officer must understand 
the significance of politics in military decision. 
ECONOMIC INTELLIGENCE 
Economics, simply defined, is the study of how 
people make their living and satisfy their mate-
rial wants. Economics thus represents a very 
sizable part of total activity, for most people are 
destined to spend the majority of their waking 
hours either earning their living or spending what 
they have received. Economics in practice is much 
broader in application than the definition first 
suggests because we live in organized societies, and 
therefore as a social science, economics is con-
cerned with group behavior. As a discipline, eco-
nomics attempts to explain and interpret this 
behavior and predict its consequences. Economic 
laws, like other social laws, are tendencies and 
trends, and thus the precise answers and controlled 
experiments common to the physical sciences are 
lacking in economics because of the difficulty in 
measuring all significant variables. The result is 
that the applications of economics in the field of 
intelligence may be ineffective or even dangerous 
in the hands of one who is not well grounded in 
its principles and who is unaware of the pitfalls 
in the use of data and concepts. 
Economic intelligence is concerned with the col-
lection and processing of information relating to 
the extent and utilization of natural and human 
resources and the industrial potential of nations. 
Economic military intelligence is not a delimited 
part of the larger field; rather it is a viewpoint 
that gives full regard to the military implications 
of economic events. Specifically, this means that 
we want to know how strong other countries are?
the limits to their economic capabilities for mak-
ing war; also whether they are preparing for war 
and the extent of such preparation; and, finally,

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
their economic vulnerabilities. When the need 
arises, such weaknesses may be attacked by mili-
tary means or by the techniques of economic 
warfare. 
Sources of Economic Intelligence 
The Department of Commerce, Office of Inter-
national Trade, receives reports from commercial 
attaches and consular agents all over the world. 
Its commodity and area specialists review large 
numbers of foreign periodicals and other reports 
in order that both private individuals or concerns 
and government agencies may have the best pos-
sible information on conditions abroad for con-
ducting business affairs. The State Department 
also has extensive interests in economic intelli-
gence since its consuls do so much of the collecting, 
but some of its direct collection responsibilities 
have been reassigned to other agencies, particu-
larly special types. The Tariff Commission is in-
terested in foreign costs of production, foreign 
tariffs, and trade restrictions. The Treasury and 
the Federal Reserve Board are concerned with 
monetary and fiscal developments. The Depart-
ments of Agriculture and Labor are active in their 
respective fields and have some representatives in 
our diplomatic missions overseas. Private agen-
cies also have specialized interests in particular 
fields of economic intelligence and prepare reports 
used by business men. For example, some are con-
cerned with petroleum, mining, construction, elec-
tric power, foreign trade, manufacturing and, of 
course, transportation and communications which 
have been treated separately. Some of these 
private concerns do a very thorough job within 
their own fields. Even such popular magazines 
as Fortune and the London Economist make nota,-
ble contributions in the reporting of foreign de-
velopments. 
The military services have the responsibility for 
filling any gaps in the economic intelligence they 
need for their own planning, and the task of tap-
ping what is already available in order to apply 
it to their own ends. 
Primary Military Interests in Economic Intelligence 
Military intelligence has the responsibility of 
keeping track of any change in economic factors 
that affect a country's ability to wage war. These 
CONFIDENTIAL 
142 
include new discoveries of mineral deposits, new 
crops and changing methods in agriculture, new 
industrial processes that affect the demands for 
labor and material and affect output and costs, 
changes in business, labor, and government that 
react on efficiency and allocation of resources, 
trends in capital investment, new depreciation 
and tax policies, trends in the price level, bank 
reserves, and inventory levels. 
Preparations for war become important to 
watch in an age when a sudden attack can be so 
crippling. Economic intelligence may well give 
warning of such action, for industry must also be 
mobilized for war. Clues may be provided by 
the stockpiling of critical materials, the develop-
ment of higher cost substitutes and synthetics for 
what normally is imported, and conversion of 
civilian industry to the production of war goods. 
Such clues need coordination with political in-
telligence to determine motivation. Since some 
economies are at all times regulated by the gov-
ernment and "mobilized," the detailed study of all 
changes in their regulations, priorities, and al-
locations may produce important leads in judging 
modifications of plans or timetables for military 
actions. 
Study of economic vulnerabilities is continuous 
also, for a dynamic economy is faced with chang-
ing pressures and shortages. Especially when a 
war becomes hot, and military action and economic 
warfare are modifying the enemy's economy, a 
close watch is essential so that counteractions will 
have maximum effect. Considering the wartime 
hazards to collection, such an assessment will be 
possible only if a prior basic analysis was prepared 
when there was time to gather and assess the origi-
nal set of facts. 
Analytical Criteria 
Assessment of economic data must include the 
application of many different criteria, all of which 
are important, such as the study of particular in-
dustries with their problems of production and 
pricing; the whole fiscal and monetary system with 
questions of the price level, savings, investment, 
and employment; the problems of ownership and 
income distribution; the problems of consumption 
and of institutions. Micro-economics with its 
attention to supply and demand of particular

commodities and its concern with competition, 
monopoly, and monopolistic or monoposonistic 
competition is best known to the beginning student. 
Macro-economics is more recent, but offers some 
singularly effective analytical tools for intelli-
gence purposes. The approach is in terms of the 
interactions of particular events on the economy as 
a whole. Some of the most useful results are ap-
parent in the national income accounting analysis 
done by the Department of Commerce. In effect 
it is the old "Tableau Economique" of Quesnay 
brought up to date to combine modern accounting 
procedures with present economic thinking into a 
large number of mutually supporting tables. The 
intelligence significance is that even if a foreign 
country tries to hide its activities almost anything 
that it does in the economic sphere will have reper-
cussions that will leave telltale signs. If it tries 
to hide much basic information, such data may be 
derived anyway by analytical techniques that have 
been developed so fully in the last decade or so in 
the United States. Some of them are highly com-
plex and lie beyond the scope of this study, but 
their importance is not to be minimized. This sug-
gests that the requests for certain types of eco-
nomic data which may mean little to the layman 
frequently include keys to very big secrets. There-
fore, the economic data collected by naval attach& 
or observers abroad may be ultimately as impor-
tant as information on strictly naval subjects. 
European Illustrations 
Hitler's Mein Kampf made clear his political 
views and intentions long before he came to power, 
although its significance was not seen by the public 
at large. Once the Nazis came to power, however, 
economic intelligence disclosed German prepara-
tions for war. Economic regimentation began as 
early as 1933, with many telltale signs. State-
directed planning was the rule, and heavy arms 
orders were fed to industry. Labor was mobilized 
through the Deutsche Arbeitsfront and the pro-
duction of civilian goods was progessively reduced. 
The conquest of Czechoslovakia was an important 
addition to German economic potential because of 
the acquisition of the Skoda works and an addi-
tional labor supply. German ingenuity went to 
work on developing substitute materials for those 
that would be cut off by war. All of these de-
143 
velopments pointed to a growing capability of 
carrying on a major war effort. The success of 
German preparations was indicated by the length 
of time they were able to fight against a coalition 
of nations numerically and industrially stronger. 
One of the most interesting exploits of economic 
intelligence involved the German oil industry. 
Especially after the dissolution of her friendship 
pact with the Soviet Union, Germany had only the 
Rumanian Ploesti fields and minor wells in Hun-
gary and Poland as sources of petroleum. To take 
the place of natural petroleum, German chemists 
had developed new processes for extracting oil and 
gasoline from coal, which brought costs down to 
a fairly reasonable level. It was natural that the 
strategic nature of these German automotive fuels 
prompted special attention by allied intelligence 
and target specialists and it became most impor-
tant that attacks be centered on all facilities of 
the industry to paralyze German transport and 
aviation. Planners remembered well that in 
World War I German transport came to a halt be-
cause of a shortage of lubricants. Some excellent 
intelligence on German oil facilities came from 
secret sources, but the most accurate and com-
plete was obtained from the Germans themselves. 
German rail tariffs, like our own, include not only 
class rates but specific commodity rates on a place 
to place basis. In order to subsidize the vitally 
needed synthetic oil industry, special commodity 
rates were set up for each oil refinery. Just as in 
America, German law required that these rates 
had to be published, and the Germans methodically 
printed such information in rate bulletins and in 
an obscure technical traffic magazine. Allied in-
telligence subscribed to this magazine through a 
Swiss address, and regularly found each new secret 
oil refinery listed with information as to the open-
ing date for the new rates,. It was then a simple 
matter to pinpoint the facility on the map and de-
stroy it by bombing. Before the war was over, 
German aircraft were grounded in considerable de-
gree by the shortage of fuel. 
Less successful were Allied attempts to cripple 
Germany's ball-bearing industry which was being 
augmented by supplies from neutral Sweden. 
The British, too, were getting considerable quan-
tities of Swedish ball bearings, but attempts to buy 
up the entire production were unsuccessful. The

Swedish SKF concern had expanded facilities, and 
deliveries were being made to Germany in return 
for safe conduct to Swedish ships bringing in es-
sential imports to the homeland. Some of the 
most spectacular and costly Allied air attacks deep 
in Germany were aimed at destroying ball-bearing 
plants, notably at Schweinfurt, but the chief ob-
jective was not gained. Germany restored pro-
duction much more rapidly than anticipated and 
redesigned her war equipment to require fewer 
bearings. The war was almost over before the 
Swedes were persuaded to cut off further ship-
ments, and by that time ball bearings were no 
longer a determining factor in the German war 
effort. The whole experience illustrated the im-
portance of correct assessment of economic intelli-
gence as well as its collection. 
German economic intelligence about the Allies 
was fairly good, notably in the data collected on 
Allied ocean convoys. Due to censorship leaks, 
secret radio broadcasts, and marine insurance re-
insured in neutral countries, German U-boats were 
frequently able to pick off the most critical ships in 
our convoys with disastrous results. It took con-
siderable effort to minimize these leaks. 
Pacific Illustrations 
Japan's military ambitions were made clear not 
only through the controversial "Tanaka Memo-
rial," the activities of the Black Dragon Society, 
and the attacks on China, but also from economic 
intelligence. Some fundamental changes in the 
Japanese economy were noted and set forth in a 
Harvard University study by Mrs. E. B. Schum-
peter (et al.), The Inclust2-ialization of Japan and 
Maneh,ukuo, that appeared just before the war. 
Although this was a study based on overt sources 
for public purposes, it revealed for the first time 
considerable detail on changes in the Japanese 
economy. In 1937, as a war measure, the Japa-
nese had banned the publication of all economic 
data; they were aware of its great significance. 
A great void developed in year books, trade re-
turns, periodicals, and industry publications. In 
fact, they were so successful in hiding informa-
tion that their own planning was hampered, and 
postwar search of Japanese government records 
indicates that many vital economic records were 
not even maintained, and thus represent gaps that 
CONFIDENTIAL 
144 
interfere with analyses of Japan's position. The 
Schumpeter study did reveal, despite the incom-
pleteness of data, that the Japanese economy was 
switching from primary dependence on export 
production of such items as textiles and ceramics to 
heavy industry, chemicals, and instruments, all 
needed for war purposes. Further, the study re-
vealed that Japan had been converted during the 
late 1930's from an island kingdom to a conti-
nental power, for much of the new industry was 
located in Korea and Manchuria. 
In passing, the pitfalls of jumping at too easy 
conclusions are evident in connection with postwar 
Japan. That defeated nation, hard hit by war 
and with shrunken boundaries, has faced major 
dilemmas. Some people have advocated concen-
tration on light industries that use labor rather 
than imported raw materials, and thus minimize 
balance of payment difficulties. Unfortunately, 
however, from the Japanese point of view, these 
are the very industries being developed by the 
nations which are the chief potential markets for 
Japanese goods, so a weakened Japan, unlikely 
to be a military threat, is developing heavy indus-
tries whose production will outstrip that achieved 
during the peak of her militaristic period. This 
has American encouragement. The military in-
telligence assessment cannot be based upon eco-
nomic data alone, as these economic facts of the 
new Japan must be linked to political and geo-
graphic changes both in Japan and in the world 
as a whole before they attain real meaning. 
Current Problems 
Some details of the Soviet economy will be pre-
sented later. Economic intelligence today from 
that area must be based on careful analysis of open 
Soviet broadcasts of information, statements in the 
Soviet press, study of Soviet foreign purchases, 
"Wringer" reports from all kinds of persons who 
have been behind the Iron Curtain, and such lim-
ited observations as diplomatic personnel are al-
lowed to make. What of Soviet activities here? 
We know that for a long time Soviet purchasing 
agents were able to tour our factories and buy our 
patents. The volume of economic data published 
by both government and private concerns is so 
tremendous that little is hidden, and that fact 
itself may give us partial protection because it

COMPONENTS OF INTELLIGENCE KNOWLEDGE CONFIDENTIAL 
places a heavy burden of analysis on the Russians. 
Could we hide information from them? Un-
doubtedly, there are many particulars easy for 
them to collect, but it should be emphasized that 
analytical techniques today are such that the hid-
ing of the broad facts of our economy from the 
enemy would require repressive measures incom-
patible with the efficient operation of a private 
enterprise economy. Hiding facts from ourselves 
could seriously cripple the planning and pricing 
activities of American businessmen. A competi-
tive system is presupposed in economic analysis to 
be one with freedom of information. In conclu-
sion, then, short of radical security measures, the 
United States must be reconciled to losing more 
information to totalitarian enemies than it gains, 
but much can be gained through intensive exploi-
tation of available sources and careful analysis. 
TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE 
The developments in military science which have 
been produced in recent years by science and tech-
nology constitute but one aspect of the profound 
change which the industrial revolution has caused 
in the environment of modern man. B. H. Lid-
dell-Hart, the British military expert, analyzes 
the subject in his book, The Revolution in 
Warfare: 
Science and technology have produced a 
greater transformation of the physical condi-
tions and apparatus of life in the past two 
hundred years than had taken place in the 
previous two thousand years. Yet when men 
turn these tremendous new powers to a war 
purpose, they employ them as recklessly as 
their ancestors employed the primitive means 
of the past, and they pursue the same tradi-
tional ends without regard to the difference of 
effect. Indeed, the governments of modern 
nations at war have largely ceased to think of 
the postwar effects which earlier statesmen 
were wise enough to bear in mind?a consid-
eration which led in the eighteenth century to 
a self-imposed limitation of methods. Mod-
ern nations have reverted to a more primitive 
extreme?akin to the practices of warfare be-
tween barbaric hordes that were armed with 
spear and sword?at the same time as they 
have become possessed of science-given in-
struments for multiple destruction at long 
range. 
The revolution in warfare has thus been 
two-sided?on the one side, in the instruments, 
145 
the technique of warfare; on the other side, in 
the character of warfare. 
Technical and scientific intelligence are directly 
concerned with the "instruments and techniques" 
in which so profound a change has taken place. 
Consideration of a new instrument, or weapon, is 
meaningless without taking into account the con-
ditions under which it is to be used and the method 
of its employment. 
To match the increased speed and scope of war, 
scientific research and development were, during 
World War II, expedited as never before, and in 
this postwar period of world tension they con-
tinue to be pressed with the greatest possible ur-
gency, particularly in the fields of atomic energy, 
jet propulsion, and guided missiles. Technical 
and scientific progress continue to force the revi-
sion of ancient and time-tested military concepts, 
and to dictate even more revolutionary changes in 
the design of ships, planes, and tanks which for-
merly embodied those concepts. Intelligence of a 
new weapon originated by an enemy perforce leads 
to feverish efforts to develop a counterweapon, 
in which the enemy in turn is vitally inter-
ested. Tactical surprise, which in earlier wars 
had been achieved by novel dispositions of armies 
and fleets, was in World War II gained also by the 
unleashing of new weapons such as the atomic 
bomb, and by improvisation, such as skip bomb-
ing, in the employment of weapons already de-
veloped. Never before have the twin qualities 
of flexibility of mind and the ability to gaze in-
telligently into the crystal ball of the future been 
so vital to military men and to the political leaders 
to whom the security of the nation is jointly 
entrusted. 
Science and technology were placed at the dis-
posal of the ground, sea, and air forces of the 
United States during World War II, and in many 
cases new weapons and items of equipment de-
signed for one specific branch of the armed forces 
were adopted by the others as well, or were fitted 
to the needs of more than one service. For ex-
ample, new aircraft went to both Army and Navy 
to be used for different tactical purposes, and the 
principle of rocket power was used by the infan-
try in the form of the bazooka, and by the Navy 
for antisubmarine warfare and for strafing enemy 
positions by LC (R) s; both Army and Navy em-

ployed rocket-equipped aircraft. The VT fuze 
was utilized as an antipersonnel weapon by the 
Army and as an antiaircraft weapon by the Navy. 
Therefore, it is advisable not to consider the tech-
nical and scientific category of strategic intelli-
gence from the specialized viewpoint of but one 
branch of the armed forces. Although we are 
concerned primarily with naval strategic intelli-
gence, the technical and scientific component em-
braces the contributions of research and develop-
ment to land, sea, and air power. 
Definitions 
The official Navy definition of the technical and 
scientific category of strategic intelligence is suffi-
ciently broad to permit a general discussion. In 
terms of Naval Intelligence, technical and scien-
tific intelligence is defined as: 
"Disclosing the development of new materials, 
techniques, and munitions of war." 
The words "technology," "science," "research," 
and "development" are too well known to require 
definition, as are the adjectives derived therefrom. 
However, it is advisable at this point to break 
down the term "scientific research" into three 
parts, and to define each of them. 'These three 
parts are: 
1. Pure research. 
2. Background research. 
3. Applied research and development. 
For definition of these phrases we turn to appen-
dix 3 of Science: The Endless Frontier, a report 
to the President, dated July 1945, by Vannevar 
Bush, wartime Director of the Office of Scientific 
Research and Development: 
1. Pure research,.?Pure research is re-
search without specific practical ends. It 
results in general knowledge and understand-
ing of nature and its laws. This general 
knowledge provides the means of answering 
a large number of important practical prob-
lems, though it may not give a specific solu-
tion to any one of them. * * * The unpre-
dictable nature of pure science makes 
desirable the provision of rather special cir-
cumstances for its pursuit. Pure research de-
mands from its followers the freedom of mind 
to look at familiar facts from unfamiliar 
points of view. It does not always lend itself 
to organized efforts and is refractory to direc-
tion from above, in fact, nowhere else is the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
146 
principle of freedom more important for sig-
nificant achievement. . . . 
2. Background research,.?The preparation 
of accurate topographic and geologic maps, 
the collection of meteorological data, the de-
termination of physical and chemical con-
stants, the description of species of animals, 
plants, and minerals, the establishment of 
standards for hormones, drugs, and X-ray 
therapy; these and similar types of scientific 
work are here grouped together under the 
term background. research. Such background 
knowledge provides essential data for ad-
vances in both pure and applied science. It 
is also widely used by the engineer, the physi-
cian, and the public at large. In contrast to 
pure science, the objectives of this type of re-
search and the methods to be used are reason-
ably clear before an investigation is under-
taken. Thus, comprehensive programs may 
be mapped out and the work carried on by 
relatively large numbers of trained personnel 
as a coordinated effort. . . . 
3. Applied research, and development.?
Applied research and development differs in 
several important respects from pure science. 
Since the objective can often be definitely 
mapped out beforehand, the work lends itself 
to organized effort. If successful, the results 
of applied research are of a definitely practi-
cal or commercial value. The very heavy ex-
penses of such work are, therefore, undertaken 
by private organizations only in the hope of 
ultimately recovering the funds invested. . . . 
The distinction between applied and pure re-
search is not a hard and fast one, and indus-
trial scientists may tackle specific problems 
from broad fundamental viewpoints. But it 
is important to emphasize that there is a per-
verse law governing research: Under the 
pressure for immediate results, and unless de-
liberate policies are set up to guard against 
this, applied research invariably drives out 
pure. The moral is clear: It is pure research 
which deserves and requires special protec-
tion and specially assured support. 
The Time Element in Research and Development 
The importance of scientific progress, which de-
pends on basic scientific research, to our Nation in 
time of peace and war is summed up by Dr. Bush 
in his report as follows: 
Progress in the war against disease depends 
upon a flow of new scientific knowledge. New 
products, new industries, and more jobs re-
quire continuous additions to knowledge of 
the laws of nature, and the application of that

COMPONENTS OF INTELLIGENCE KNOWLEDGE CONFIDENTIAL 
knowledge to practical purposes. Similarly, 
our defense against aggression demands new 
knowledge so that we can, develop new and 
improved weapons. This essential new 
knowledge can be obtained only through basic 
scientific research. 
Science can be effective in the national wel-
fare only as a member of a team, whether the 
condition be peace or war. But without sci-
entific progress no amount of achievement in 
other directions can insure our health, pros-
perity, and security as a nation in the modern 
world. 
Dr. Bush, in the above quotation, states that a 
form of warfare, war against disease, continues, 
in peacetime, and that our security against aggres-
sion by other powers is intimately bound up with 
our prosperity and our national health. Research 
specialists in the medical field may be said to be 
intelligence officers of a certain kind, to whom the 
qualities of alertness, thoroughness, patience, and 
imagination are as essential as they are to mili-
tary intelligence specialists. Now more than ever 
must scientific research specialists coordinate their 
effort with military intelligence specialists, in 
view, of the susceptibility of all nations to sudden 
attack directed against centers of population and 
industry. Developments in aircraft and guided 
missiles have increased the range and speed of de-
livery of atomic bombs and toxic warfare agents. 
Thus scientists as well as specialists in strategic 
intelligence may be said to be today in our first 
line of defense. 
Not only must the state of our own scientific 
research and development be of interest to us, but 
we must also disclose, as promptly and completely 
as possible, the trends and achievements of sci-
entific research and development in potential 
enemy nations. In his report, Dr. Bush empha-
sizes the time element in modern war, and the 
necessity for peacetime scientific preparedness: 
The bitter and dangerous battle against the 
U-boat was a battle of scientific techniques?
and our margin of success was dangerously 
small. The new eyes which radar has sup-
plied can sometimes be blinded by new sci-
entific developments. V-2 was countered only 
by capture of the launching sites. 
We cannot again rely on our Allies to hold 
off the enemy while we struggle to catch up. 
There must be more?and more adequate?
military research in peacetime. It is essen-
147 
tial that the civilian scientists continue in 
peacetime some portion of those contributions 
to national security which they have made so 
effectively during the war. This can best be 
done through a civilian controlled organiza-
tion with close liaison with the Army and 
Navy, but with funds direct from Congress, 
and the clear power to initiate military re-
search which will supplement and strengthen 
that carried on directly under the control of 
the Army and Navy. 
During peace, the time element in our own sci-
entific research and development is closely related 
to the time element in obtaining strategic intelli-
gence of scientific progress in other countries, in 
precisely the same way that the two were related 
during the war recently concluded. Furthermore, 
internal security and counterintelligence, as ap-
plied to technology and science, are of continued 
importance. 
In World War II the deliberate and planned 
violation of security which took place in connec-
tion with the atomic bomb was the disclosure to 
the world of the fact that it existed and that it 
worked. Security was also relaxed in connection 
with the VT fuze, one of the important new weap-
ons produced by the Office of Scientific Research 
and Development. As in the case of the atomic 
bomb, a significant factor was the time element. 
Originally, the VT fuze had been allocated only 
to the Navy because of the possibility that the 
enemy might learn the secret if VT fuzed shells 
were fired over land. However, in the autumn of 
1943, it became necessary to use VT fuzed shells 
for the protection of London and port areas in 
southern England which were eventually to serve 
as major staging areas for the Normandy invasion. 
The details of this situation are described by 
Dr. James P. Baxter III in his book, Scientists 
Against Time. Highly secret information re-
ceived by the Allies indicated that the Germans 
intended to employ robot bombs against England. 
Some months before any were used, however, a 
detailed description of the new buzz bomb became 
available to OSRD. With this information, it 
was possible to construct a duplicate of the new 
German bomb and to conduct intensive tests. 
These tests revealed that the buzz bombs would 
activate the VT fuzes and that certain models of 
these fuzes could be effectively employed against 
the bombs. As a result of this new information

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
developed by careful research, a high level deci-
sion was made to utilize VT fuzes as a means of 
aiding in the protection of the threatened areas of 
England. This emergency decision made available 
a helpful countermeasure which was ready for use 
in ample time. The urgency of the situation and 
the time element dictated the decision. 
The importance of the time element in the grand 
strategy of the Allied Nations in 1942, and the 
reasons for selecting Germany as the main target 
for attack instead of Japan, were explained by 
Secretary of War Patterson in an address before 
the American Chemical Society, 8 April 1946. In 
his speech the Secretary gave the following rea-
sons for assigning priority to the European War: 
One was to take advantage of the concen-
tration of forces. Russia was fighting Ger-
many, but not Japan. Another was the 
shorter distance to Germany; the shorter dis-
tance meant shorter time in getting into ac-
tion. But the reason that seemed to me as 
compelling as any was the danger of the Ger-
man scientists, the risk that they would come 
up with new weapons of devastating de-
structiveness. There was no time to lose in 
eliminating German science from the war. 
There was no comparable peril from Japanese 
science. 
The wisdom of this decision is seen now in 
retrospect when we ponder the remarkable ad-
vances made by German research and development 
in the latter half of World War II, particularly 
with respect to rockets, jet propulsion, and guided 
missiles. The race for new weapons and counter-
weapons was ultimately won by the Allies, largely 
because of better mobilization and organization of 
scientific brainpower and because of greater armed 
might and industrial capacity, but the margin was 
close. 
The secret of our success in developing many 
new and improved types of weapons and equip-
ment during World War II, and producing them 
in quantity and delivering them in time to be 
effectively employed against the enemy, lies in the 
coordination of our scientific and industrial po-
tential, in close cooperation with the armed serv-
ices. Our top strategic planners allocated mate-
rials, scientific brainpower, and industrial compe-
tence in accordance with priorities dictated by the 
overall grand strategy, and, by means of technical 
and scientific intelligence, kept abreast of scientific 
CONFIDENTIAL 
148 
research and development in enemy countries, and 
assessed the performance of our new weapons in 
action as they were developed. 
The Technical Intelligence Center and Missions 
The vital interest of the Office of Naval Intelli-
gence in technological and scientific fields led to 
the establishment of the Technical Intelligence 
Center to deal with foreign technical subjects, in-
cluding ordnance in all its phases, electronics, 
naval vessels and merchant ships and their char-
acteristics and equipment, chemicals, synthetics, 
medicines, and aircraft (in collaboration with the 
Technical Air Intelligence Center). 
During World War II the Technical Intelli-
gence Center had a dual purpose: 
1. To keep the strategic and operations planners 
and the Navy at sea and in forward areas 
informed at all times of such technical de-
velopments on the part of the enemy as might 
affect operations, tactics, or planning in any 
phase of the war. 
2. To make available to bureaus of the Navy 
and other interested technical and scientific 
activities any information on foreign tech-
nology which might lead to development of 
effective countermeasures on our part, the 
perfection of Allied weapons, or the evolu-
tion of new materials and techniques. 
The Technical Intelligence Center profited by 
constant use of all the normal sources of intelli-
gence within and outside the country. Of unusual 
significance was the detailed interrogation of cap-
tured personnel, particularly those with scientific 
or technical background, with the Center itself 
conducting an examination of some of the most 
important prisoners. 
In maintaining liaison with other technical ac-
tivities, the Technical Intelligence Center was 
responsible for directing the collection of specific 
items in fields of intelligence of extraordinary 
importance to American scientific research and 
development. To this end, the center coordinated 
the activities of our naval representatives abroad, 
particularly those of naval technical missions 
eventually established first in Europe and later 
in Japan. 
With the successful invasion of the European 
continent on 6 June 1944, and the advance of

COMPONENTS OF INTELLIGENCE KNOWLEDGE CONFIDENTIAL 
Allied forces into the German homeland, the ex-
ploitation of German technical developments for 
possible use against Japan became a project of 
urgent importance in the final phase of the Euro-
pean conflict. The determination of the nature 
and extent of German technical aid to Japan was 
in itself a project of vast significance. Strategic 
planners recognized that the rapid exploitation 
of this project, with correspondingly efficient 
development of countermeasures, might affect to 
a marked degree the duration of the war. There, 
the naval technical mission in Europe, working 
from lists of intelligence targets of prime impor-
tance, was assigned the job of investigating and 
reporting on German technology; the Technical 
Intelligence Center in Washington coordinated 
the activities of the mission and assured proper 
distribution of its discoveries and reports. The 
detailed operation of NavTecMisEu teams in the 
European theater was an interesting and exciting 
chapter in the history of Naval Intelligence. The 
successful examination of German industrial 
plants, the painstaking and difficult search for 
records and files which were often partially de-
stroyed or buried in cellars, and the continual and 
often dangerous hunt for key personnel by teams 
which travelled by air, train, jeep, and even on 
foot, resulted in an exceedingly valuable and com-
prehensive record of German technological efforts. 
While the Japanese war ended too quickly 
thereafter for the United States to put into effect 
the countermeasures which resulted from this 
thoroughgoing investigation, the advantages ac-
cruing to the American military and to private 
enterprise from a careful digest of German re-
search, developments, and techniques can hardly 
be overestimated. An organization similar to 
NavTeeMisEu was created under the title, Naval 
Technical Mission Japan, with much the same 
ends in view. A brief account of the establish-
ment, purpose and accomplishments of this group 
is contained in the following quotations from 
Summary Report, United States Naval Technical 
Mission to Japan: 
In the summer of 1945 . . . the United 
States Navy established a mission to deter-
mine the position of the Japanese in the field 
of naval technology. 
How did the design and construction of 
their warships compare with ours ? What 
149 
range and power had their guns? How heavy 
was their armor and what was its metallurgy ? 
Were they ahead of us in electronics develop-
ment ? The Navy wanted the answers to these 
and a thousand other technical questions. 
To obtain the desired information, investi-
gators had to enter Japan with the occupation 
forces, before manufacturing plants, equip-
ment, materials, and records could be de-
stroyed and experienced personnel dispersed. 
NavTechJap, which became the abbreviated 
designation for the United States Naval Tech-
nical Mission to Japan, was established on 14 
August 1945 by directive of Commander in 
Chief and the Chief of Naval Operations . . . 
The purpose of the Mission was to survey 
all Japanese scientific and technological de-
velopments of interest to the Navy and 
Marine Corps in the Japanese islands of 
Kyushu, Shikoku, Honshu, Hokkaido; in 
China; and in Korea south of latitude 38? N. 
This involved the seizure of intelligence mate-
rial, its examination and study, the interroga-
tion of personnel, and, finally, the preparation 
of reports which would appraise the techno-
logical status of the Japanese Navy and Japa-
nese industry. 
The mission remained in existence from 1 Sep-
tember 1945 until 1 November 1946; its accom-
plishments were stated to be as follows: 
A total of 185 separate reports comprising ap-
proximately 10,000 printed pages were prepared 
and 500 copies of each were printed. 
Approximately 3,500 documents were seized and 
shipped to the Washington Document Center and 
the technical bureaus of the Navy Department. 
Approximately 15,000 pieces of equipment were 
seized and shipped to the United States for labora-
tory investigation. The largest items were two 
18.1-inch guns shipped from Kure, each 75 feet 
long and weighing 180 tons. 
The shipment to the United States of the 15,000 
pieces of enemy equipment by the mission was but 
a continuation on a far larger scale of a pro-
cedure established during the war, under which 
items of equipment captured in the field were for-
warded to designated laboratories or test centers 
in the United States for detailed analysis and 
testing. In this phase of technical intelligence, 
the center served as a clearing house for items sent 
in, and for requests from Washington to forward 
areas for specific 'articles. By this means, the 
connection between reports of new weapons and

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
the pieces themselves was maintained, and ade-
quate exploitation of the information assured. 
Another responsibility assigned to the Techni-
cal Intelligence Center was that of evaluating and 
processing information on naval and merchant 
ships and their characteristics. All possible 
sources of information were continually scanned 
for data, comprehensive or fragmentary, on the 
existence or characteristics of new ships, or for 
alterations in existing vessels. The collation of 
this kind of intelligence with a detailed analysis 
of all types of photographs, including aerial and 
surface shots, during the war resulted in far 
greater knowledge of enemy ships than had ever 
been available before. The size, probable per-
formance, equipment, and appearance of the bat-
tleships Tomato and Musash,i, secrets so closely 
guarded in Japan that even men who had worked 
aboard the vessels knew little about them, were 
revealed with amazing accuracy by this method. 
Another instance of the detailed processing of 
ship data occurred in connection with the conver-
sion of the Japanese battleships Ise and Hyuga to 
carry aircraft on a "flight deck" abaft the main-
mast. Prisoner-of-war reports were carefully 
checked with the Preliminary Design Section of 
the Bureau of Ships, and, without benefit of photo-
graphs or sketches, a drawing was prepared of 
the possible appearance of the two vessels. The 
close similarity of the drawing to the ships them-
selves, as revealed in the second battle of the 
Philippine Sea, is testimony to both the possibili-
ties and value of expert processing of ship in-
formation. 
Throughout the war the Technical Intelligence 
Center made available to strategic planners and 
to the fleet the latest information on the enemy's 
naval vessels, including such important factors as 
the speed, armament, armor, and specialized equip-
ment of each enemy unit. 
As a means of assuring the distribution of in-
formation on naval and merchant vessels, the Tech-
nical Intelligence Center took over the basic work 
accomplished by the Identification and Charac-
teristics Section in the publication field, and pre-
pared standard reference manuals on the fleets of 
the world, together with a comprehensive volume 
on merchant vessels. The ONI 22 series on the 
naval vessels of Japan, Russia, Britain, and the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
150 
United States and other countries contains all 
available information on dimensions, armament, 
protection, and propulsion of each ship, as well 
as carefully prepared plan and profile drawings 
and detailed photographs. These publications 
serve innumerable uses as basic reference manuals 
and provide source material for recognition train-
ing, naval staff work, and study at the Naval War 
College. ONI 209, A Manual of Merchant Ships, 
includes statistical information on over 13,000 
vessels now afloat, in a convenient, readily avail-
able index, and profiles of approximately 8,000 of 
these ships. Included also is a section originally 
designed to assist in the recognition of German 
raiders and blockade runners in the Atlantic, 
South Pacific, and Indian Oceans. In addition 
to these standard works, the center distributed 
other information on weapons and equipment 
through the medium of special publications, and 
also in articles in The ONI -Weekly and its suc-
cessor, The ONI Review. 
As a result of the flood of information from the 
European theater subsequent to the Allied pene-
tration of Germany, an expeditious method had 
to be promulgated to assure adequate distribution 
of vital intelligence data to those technical activi-
ties best qualified to analyze the information and 
develop any latent value it might contain. At the 
same time it was apparent that much of the tech-
nical data from abroad was of interest and im-
portance concurrently to a number of widely 
scattered organizations, and, as mentioned above, 
to private industry. 
A technical library of all reports and related 
data was therefore established in the Technical In-
telligence Center which permitted immediate ref-
erence by subjects to all available information. A 
staff of experts was assigned the task of analyzing 
and briefing each incoming item of information. 
Members of the staff were required to know the 
needs of various technical organizations and to be 
familiar with projects being carried on by them, 
in order to make immediate distribution of needed 
data. At the same time accession lists were dis-
seminated, containing brief abstracts of the con-
tents of incoming documents, by means of which 
interested activities were apprised of the existence 
of these reports. Processing this type of informa-
tion, translating, duplicating, and disseminating

IGENCE KNOWLEDGE CONFIDENTIAL 
was a tremendous task, and one in which the entire 
Office of Naval Intelligence participated, and of 
which it can be justifiably proud. 
ARMED FORCES INTELLIGENCE 
Even though nonmilitary methods of warfare?
political, economic, and psychological ? have 
grown in use and importance, their ultimate suc-
cess will be largely conditioned by physical force 
or the threat of fts use. Military strength has his-
torically been the basis of national power, the hard 
core of all the elements through which a nation 
realizes its strategic objectives in peace and war. 
Armed forces intelligence is therefore derived 
from timely and accurate information of military 
strength, both in being and potential. It is an 
evaluation of the aggregate power of all the armed 
services, as well as a detailed analysis of each serv-
ice. As a component of intelligence knowledge 
it has a particularly strong relationship to the 
other components, for armed forces are definitely 
influenced by a nation's geographic position, the 
adequacy of its transport and communications 
systems, its sociological, political, and economic 
structure, its scientific capabilities, and the per-
sonalities of leaders in each arm of the military 
establishment. Because of these relationships; 
armed forces intelligence is most complex, and in 
order to make valid deductions the intelligence 
officer or strategic analyst must have not only pro-
fessional competence in military matters, but also 
a wealth of background knowledge in those aspects 
of national life which govern military affairs. 
In an age of amphibious landings, combined 
operations, and "tri-elemental" warfare, Naval In-
telligence is concerned with all the elements of land 
and air as well as sea power. Coastal zones may 
be dominated by either ground or naval forces, or 
by carrier-based or land-based air forces. Ex-
tensive sea areas may also be controlled from the 
adjacent land. World War II provided striking 
examples of the effectiveness of close coordination 
of armies, fleets, and aircraft in achieving victory. 
The naval intelligence officer will often be as-
signed to a joint or combined staff where he will 
be closely associated with his opposite numbers 
in the Army and Air Force. It is incumbent upon 
him, therefore, to become familiar with the mis-
sion, organization, and professional nomenclature 
151 
of the other services. He should be a keen ob-
server of their operations, learn the capabilities 
of their weapons, and appreciate their problems. 
The ensuing discussion of the armed forces will 
point out the various elements which must be con-
sidered in the development of this component of 
intelligence knowledge. 
THE ARMED FORCES IN GENERAL 
Control 
Political, administrative, and command control 
must be clearly distinguished. They may be 
vested in the same officials or be separated by an 
elaborate system of checks and balances. In most 
countries a semblance of civilian control of the 
armed forces is preserved, but actual control is not 
always the same as that prescribed by the consti-
tution. Usually in democracies a single cabinet 
member of the executive branch, a civilian, is in 
charge of all military affairs. In Latin American 
democracies, however, it is often true that civilian 
control over the army exists only in theory, for 
the military may have acquired control over the 
executive branch by force of arms. 
Civilian control of the military sometimes takes 
fantastic forms. During the past several years 
the Soviet Government has been trying to intro-
duce a certain amount of "culture" into the officer 
corps of its armed services. It appears that "cul-
ture" does not require an officer to become a con-
noisseur of the arts but relates to neatness in dress 
and better table manners. The official officers' 
guide contains the following directives: 
Don't comb your hair during meals; don't 
stretch your legs out; and don't open your col-
lar . . . The fork is held in the left hand, 
the knife in the right hand, and not vertically 
but horizontally . . . To eat with the knife 
alone is quite indecent. . . . Don't exhale into 
the faces of others. 
Any important change in the top control struc-
ture effected in time of war must be carefully 
noted. If such a change involves the formulation 
of a joint general staff or other unified control, its 
composition and the methods whereby coordina-
tion is achieved and differences resolved become 
significant.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Composition and Size 
The armed forces of a nation may include in 
addition to army, navy, and air, certain compo-
nents with police and border security functions, 
which are integrated into the armed forces in time 
of war or emergency. The United States Coast 
Guard, for example, under the Treasury Depart-
ment in peacetime becomes a part of the Navy in 
time of war. In East Germany the B ereit-
sehaf ten or "Alert Police" constitutes the nucleus 
for an army, and the "Sea Police" can become a 
navy. An estimate of the armed forces of the 
U. S. S. R. will include consideration of the se-
curity forces of the M. V. D. 
Data on the size of the armed forces consists of 
more than figures on the total personnel strength 
of each service. The relationship of the strength 
of the armed forces to total population must be 
shown, and significant trends in size and propor-
tion indicated. Comparative figures over a pe-
riod of years are essential. 
Position in the Nation 
The chief factors to consider in determining the 
position of the armed forces in the nation are the 
legal or constitutional basis for their existence and 
organization, the traditions responsible for popu-
lar attitudes toward them, their role in political 
life, and the fiscal support they receive. When-
ever the prestige and power of the armed forces 
appears to be due in part to foreign influences, 
the development of such influences should be care-
fully traced. Knowledge of these matters will 
provide the researcher with the proper perspective 
for detailed study of individual arms and services. 
In many countries the size of the armed forces 
and the proportion of the total military budget 
allotted to each arm are specifically restricted by 
law. An examination of such laws will help to 
ascertain whether the present government pre-
serves their letter and spirit or whether the armed 
forces have come to their present status without 
regard for legal basis. Public law may also pro-
vide for organizational structure; for example, in 
the United States, the National Security Act of 
1947 represented a fundamental change toward 
unification of the American military establish-
ment. An understanding of our present military 
structure can only be gained through familiarity 
CONFIDENTIAL 
152 
with the provisions of this law and its amend-
ments. 
The attitude of the people toward the armed 
forces is important in determining the position of 
the military as a whole or the prestige of an in-
dividual arm. In Great Britain, for example, the 
Royal Navy is the senior service, the result, of 
course, of the place of sea power in British history 
and traditions. In America, the Army has been 
the senior service since the time oithe Revolution-
ary War when national objectiv"& were achieved 
through effective use of ground forces. Reverence 
for military leaders and popular approval of stern 
military discipline have been important elements 
in the willingness of the German people to go to 
war. The victories or defeats of past wars may 
have contributed to the present attitude of the 
people of a nation toward war and military or 
naval affairs. National emergencies can likewise 
change the people's attitudes. In the United 
States, for example, popular enthusiasm for mili-
tary matters and the prestige of military men 
have always been greater in wartime than in pe-
riods between wars. In countries where conscrip-
tion is resented the armed forces will not enjoy 
popular esteem, civilian control is apt to be more 
firmly established, and the efficiency of national 
defense may even be impaired. The morale and 
accomplishments of the military establishment or 
of an individual service may instill admiration 
and respect in the popular mind, and become an 
incentive for the most capable citizens to seek 
military service. In countries where citizen 
soldiers far outnumber professionals, the public 
attitude will be conditioned by the treatment ac-
corded reservists while on active duty. 
The political influence of military men must also 
be assessed. Does the party in power take particu-
lar steps to keep popular military figures removed 
from the political scene? Do political leaders re-
quire military support to further their objectives? 
Associated with such considerations are the ex-
istence of political factions within the services 
and the extent of political intrigue. Measures 
taken to insure the loyalty of members of the mili-
tary establishment and the manner of dealing with 
subversive elements are important in respect to 
some countries. For example, in the U. S. S. R., 
political reliability is a requirement for promotion

in the officers corps, and a special organization 
within the military services is charged with the 
political indoctrination of enlisted personnel. 
In determining the national position of the 
armed forces the manner of allocation and control 
of appropriated funds are just as important as 
the amount of the appropriations themselves. 
What proportion of the total national budget is 
allotted to the armed services? Are any items for 
military purposes concealed in the budget figures 
as published? Often the executive branch of the 
government will have considerable funds available 
for expenditure without public accounting. The 
Manhattan project, for example, which developed 
the A-bomb during World War II, cost over two 
billion dollars, but the expenditures were never 
published as items in a military budget for secu-
rity reasons. 
The national objectives of a country will be re-
flected in its military budget. A striking example 
can be found in the present tremendous rise of 
United States military expenditures to meet the 
threat of aggression in Korea. It also reflects the 
growing realization that America can no longer 
rely on her ocean barriers. New problems of na-
tional security require extensive funds for research 
to improve existing weapons and equipment. 
Manpower 
Analysis of a nation's manpower was initially 
treated in the preceding discussion of the sociologi-
cal component. The same principles apply here, 
but more attention is given to manpower from 
the military point of view, differentiating between 
manpower as a whole and that section of it which 
is drawn upon for the armed forces. Statistics 
must be presented showing availability and quality 
of men fit for military service. How many young 
men annually reach military age, and what is the 
average number inducted? The basic military 
service laws and the general conscription system 
should be studied. What are the actual practices 
in granting deferments, and what proportion of 
the number available is affected by such reg-
ulations? 
In estimating the quality of military manpower, 
attention must be given to physique, intelligence, 
education, amenability to hardship, aptitude for 
handling and maintaining technical or complex 
269196-54--11 
153 
equipment, and general attitudes, such as accept-
ance of discipline, esprit de corps, and loyalty. 
The discussion to this point has concerned armed 
forces as a whole. The balance of this section will 
deal with ground, naval, and air forces separately, 
and the detailed information regarding each which 
is needed in the production of accurate armed 
forces intelligence. 
GROUND FORCES 
Administration of the Army 
The best way to present overall organization is 
by a chart showing the main subdivisions of the 
War Ministry, or the Department of the Army, 
and the chain of command to territorial headquar-
ters and field forces. The structure of the High 
Command should be included and comments made 
on the functions of main bureaus and staff divi-
sions. Maps showing the boundaries of military 
districts and the location of headquarters are 
essential. 
The various arms and services of the Army must 
be accurately described, using nomenclature in the 
language of the country. Any distinctive insig-
nia worn by certain troop units should be described 
or illustrated. 
Tactical Organization 
The overall organization of the Army into tacti-
cal commands can also be presented in chart form, 
supplemented by a description of basic tactical 
units and field staffs. If there are any differences 
between the tactical organization in time of war 
and that of the peacetime Army, note should be 
made of them. Additional charts can be prepared 
to show the detailed organization of divisions and 
smaller independent combat units, including 
strengths and allotment of weapons and vehicles. 
Comparison with similar organizations in the 
United States Army is always helpful. Descrip-
tions should be carried down to the smallest ele-
ments, such as rifle squad or tank platoon. 
The organization of service units, engineers, 
signal, transportation, etc., should be given in the 
same detail as that of combat units. Nomencla-
ture should be carefully recorded, for it varies 
considerably in armies of the world. American 
equivalents again serve as good standards of corn-

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
parison. Therefore, for background purposes, the 
following brief discussion of United States Army 
divisions is appropriate. 
The Infantry Division 
An infantry division is typically composed of 
three regiments of infantry, a medium tank bat-
talion, a combat engineer battalion, an antiaircraft 
artillery automatic weapons battalion, and four 
field artillery battalions. It is designed to hit 
hard, maneuver over any terrain, absorb reinforc-
ing units easily, and show considerable staying 
power. In specific situations it may require addi-
tional artillery, armor, engineers, or service units. 
It gives close support to armored units, seizes, 
holds, or envelops objectives, and engages in neces-
sary close combat. The ratio of combat to service 
troops is 1 to 1. In its present composition it is 
a more powerful striking force than its World 
War II counterpart, for each regiment also has a 
medium tank company. The combat engineers can 
build roads, bridges, ferries; lay mine fields and 
obstacles; build shelters, landing strips, water-
works; and in emergency fight as infantry. 
Infantry weapons include rifles, bayonets, auto-
matic rifles, machine guns, mortars, carbines, pis-
tols, grenades, light antitank weapons, recoilless 
rifles, flamethrowers, and tanks. Infantry has the 
advantage of being able to move inconspicuously 
in small groups, taking full advantage of terrain. 
Battle effectiveness over a period of time requires 
rotation of units, proper supply, and medical 
service. 
When Army infantry is used in amphibious 
operations, the battalion landing team is the basic 
organization. Necessary boats and amphibious 
vehicles take the place of much of the motor 
equipment. 
The Armored Division 
The armored division is the basic large armored 
unit, a balanced force of ground arms designed 
to be tactically and administratively self-sufficient 
for missions requiring great mobility and. fire-
power. 
Typically, it is composed of 15 battalions: 4 
tank, 4 armored infantry, 4 armored field artillery, 
1 antiaircraft automatic weapon, 1 reconnais-
sance, and 1 armored engineer. In addition, there 
are the necessary headquarters and service troops, 
including combat commands as required. It is 
very flexible in organization and employment. 
An armored division is especially suited for 
deep penetration and seizure operations, mobile 
defense, and destruction of hostile armor. If 
it cannot lead an assault, it can attack through an 
infantry division after obstacles have been 
breached or bridged. Maintaining its momentum 
is important to full effectiveness. 
CONFIDENTIAL 154 
The Airborne Division 
Just as amphibious operations require special 
techniques and equipment, so too do airborne as-
saults. All equipment must be transportable by 
air. The ground units depend upon the Air Force 
for airlift just as amphibious units depend on 
the Navy. Airborne divisions frequently are or-
ganized in three combat teams, each with an in-
fantry regiment, an artillery battalion, an engineer 
company, and a medical detachment. Other per-
sonnel include a parachute maintenance company, 
antitank and pathfinder platoons. 
The airborne division enters combat in three 
echelons: an assault group, either parachuted or 
landed from assault transports; a followup group, 
landed in the air head either by assault or regular 
transports; and a rear echelon of maintenance 
and administrative personnel. 
The division is no more mobile than any other 
without its airlift. Its radius of action is deter-
mined by the aircraft it uses. Typically, it re-
quires 751 Fairchild Packets (C-119), 161 Chase 
Avitrucks (C--123) , and 16 Douglas Globemasters 
(0-421). 
Because of dependence on airlift, which in turn 
depends on good weather, airborne operations are 
usually limited to short duration strikes against 
key targets in the enemy rear where opposing 
forces will be weak or scattered. Operations are 
usually intended for early joining with other 
ground forces, raid and withdrawal, or special aid 
to guerrillas. An independent operation, such as 
the seizure and expansion of an air head, is possi-
ble, but requires a major effort since medium tanks 
and heavy artillery are not available to an airborne 
unit. Sufficient air superiority must be main-
tained to prevent the enemy from taking effective 
counteraction over a period of time.

COMPONENTS OF INTELLIGENCE KNOWLEDGE 
The strategic mobility of airborne forces, sub-
ject to the command of the theater headquarters, 
is a threat to the enemy by its very presence in 
the theater of operations. At present the radius 
of action for large-scale airborne operations is 
about 730 miles; it could be extended to 1,000 miles 
with the aid of carrier-based aircraft. 
Order of Battle 
In time of war, a large part of the total military 
intelligence effort is devoted to enemy order of 
battle: specific information on the strength and 
disposition of opposing forces. Strength is meas-
ured in terms of personnel, units, and armament. 
Disposition refers to the locations of identified 
units, their headquarters, and movements. For 
the operational commander such information on 
the enemy is imperative, and he must also try to 
keep from the enemy corresponding information 
on his own forces. This denial to the enemy of 
order of battle intelligence was well illustrated 
early in the Korean War when General Douglas 
MacArthur's headquarters asked correspondents 
to refrain from identifying military units in the 
Korean operations and reporting the whereabouts 
of headquarters or troop movements. 
Order of battle intelligence is expanded to in-
clude tactical doctrines and methods, combat value 
of troops, records of performance of identified 
units, and personal data on unit commanders. If 
the information gathered by the intelligence re-
searcher in peacetime is painstaking in attention 
to details, the task of the combat intelligence offi-
cer in the field will be made easier. 
The need for including data on weapons and 
equipment in order of battle information is well 
illustrated by an experience of the United States 
Marines in Korea. The First Marine Division 
had made contact with an enemy unit. By inter-
rogating a prisoner, the Marine Intelligence officer 
learned that this unit was a full North Korean di-
vision. Consulting his order of battle file, he 
further learned that an artillery battalion is at-
tached to each North Korean division and that its 
armament consists of 18 76-mm. guns and 18 
122-mm. howitzers. Thus he was able to supply 
his commander with valuable combat intelligence 
on the firepower of the enemy. 
Order of battle data can be effectively recorded 
155 
CONFIDENTIAL 
on a situation plot for a given area of operations 
by pins and symbols as far as identifications and 
locations are concerned. A card file giving de-
tails on individual units is an indispensable 
reference. 
Strategy and Tactics 
Since the strategic military problems of a nation 
are influenced by such factors as geographical 
position, nature of terrain, economic capabilities, 
and political system, the analyst's task is to study 
the land fortifications and costal defenses in the 
light of the nation's strategic concepts. Detailed 
information must be gathered on the location, pur-
pose, characteristics, and manning of defense in-
stallations. Presentation on a map will give a 
good graphic picture. Whenever possible, sketches 
or ground plans of individual fortifications should 
be included. 
The basic tactical doctrines of the Army offen-
sively and defensively must be carefully studied 
in comparison with those of the United States 
Army. How is artillery used in support of ground 
forces? Cavalry? Tanks? Are there any pre-
ferred types of field fortifications or ground ob-
stacles? What use is made of reconnaissance? 
What tactics are employed in close combat? The 
doctrines established in special operations must 
also be included, such as amphibious landings, air-
borne operations, and guerrilla warfare. Opera-
tions in desert, jungle, or mountain terrain require 
special tactics. Similarities and differences with 
respect to United States doctrine should be pointed 
out. 
Personnel and Training 
The rank structure and system of pay and al-
lowances of a foreign army can be presented in 
tabular form, with the United States equivalent 
providing a basis for comparison. Any particu-
lar differences may require a descriptive explana-
tion. When pay is given in the terms of the 
country's monetary system, the equivalent in dol-
lars at a stated rate of exchange is necessary. 
Military pay should also be evaluated according to 
the standard of living in the country. 
Additional considerations with respect to per-
sonnel are the methods of procurement, terms of 
service, and any quality factors not covered under 
manpower. An assessment of military leadership

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
against a background of the military history and 
traditions of the nation is valuable in a strategic 
estimate. 
Details on the ground forces training program 
should include training of the individual soldier 
as well as that of all types of units. The army 
school system for officers and enlisted men, regular 
and reserve, the character of training maneuvers, 
and the overall effectiveness of instruction are 
pertinent considerations. 
Closely allied to training are the reserve and 
mobilization systems. The total number of 
trained reserves should be presented by age groups. 
In regard to mobilization plans an estimate should 
be made of the actual numbers which could be 
called up and ready for field service on M-day, M 
plus 30, M plus 60, etc. 
Logistics 
Logistics enters into every phase of military 
activity: production, procurement, storage and 
issue, transport of supplies, maintenance and re-
pair on the field, and evacuation of both equipment 
and personnel. Many a battle or war has been lost 
through logistics failures and contrariwise superb 
logistics support made victory possible for Ameri-
can armies in the farflung campaigns of World 
War II. More recently the failure of Chinese 
Communist Forces in Korea to sustain offensives 
for long periods of time has been due to their in-
ability to maintain the nesessary amount of ma-
teriel at the front to support their operations. 
The better logistics of the United Nations, on the 
other hand, has enabled a numerically smaller 
force to contain the enemy attacks. 
The analyst or researcher thus considers all 
the factors of logistics in preparing an estimate 
of a foreign army. He very quickly finds that he 
needs accurate knowledge of industrial production 
and economic affairs in order to make his analysis 
complete. 
Army logistics are of particular concern to the 
Navy because the transport of men and supplies 
for any overseas operation is a naval responsi-
bility. Logistic planning in the United States 
Army is based on the "division slice," that is, the 
total number of men in both combat and com-
munications zones. For example, a theater di-
vision slice totals 40,000 men: 30,000 in the combat 
CONFIDENTIAL 
156 
zone (20,000 in the division area, 10,000 in corps 
and army service areas) and 10,000 in the com-
munications zone. 
H. G. Martin in Brassey's Annual for 1951 
makes some interesting comparisons between the 
division slice of American and Soviet Armies: 
Within two months of the outbreak of war 
the Soviet Army could probably mobilize 
about 300 divisions; at the peak of its effort 
in the late war its total of divisions amounted 
to about 600. The Soviet Army achieves 
this multiplicity of divisions by a process of 
streamlining vigorously applied. Marshal 
Vasilevski believes that it is the men in the 
firing line who win battles. He sees to it, 
therefore, that in the Soviet Army there shall 
be as many men as possible in the firing line?
at the expense of the rearward services?and 
that the ratio of weapons to men shall be 
higher than in Western armies. He has be-
gun right down at rifle company level. 
Whereas in a rifle company in the United 
States Army there are thirty-seven men whose 
primary jobs are cooking, signalling, M. T. 
driving, or clerking, in a Soviet rifle company 
all but two are there for one purpose only?
to shoot at the enemy . . . 
Clearly the West has something here to 
learn from Marshal Vasilevski's methods. 
Russia, with a plethora of cheap manpower, 
has given us, with our manpower shortage, 
a striking lesson in economy of administra-
tive overheads. Clerical staffs, cooks, or-
derlies, M. T. drivers, signals, engineering 
and medical services?Marshal Vasilevski 
prunes the lot ruthlessly. 
Of course, his is a comparatively simple 
problem. He can afford to cut overheads 
because he is dealing with men accustomed 
to conditions that more civilized Westerners 
would find intolerable. For instance, in the 
Soviet Army there is no personal documen-
tation of soldiers below the rank of major; 
the medical battalion of a division is only 
eighty strong. 
Moreover, Vasirevski is faced by the fact 
that in Russia there is no educated class of 
minor technicians. Thus with the best will 
in the world he could not have provided the 
Soviet artillery with the men to do the sur-
vey, work out the computations, and man the 
? observation posts on a western scale. Per-
force, he must there cut overheads at the 
sacrifice of some flexibility of fire of his ar-
tillery. 
Finally, he has a comparatively small zone 
of communications to deal with. If war

should come, the Soviet Army would advance 
from its bases in Occupied Eastern Europe 
in an attempt to overrun the western fringe. 
Throughout, Vasilevski would be fighting al-
most on his own doorstep; but not so the 
United States or even the British armies?
theirs would be an overseas campaign, fought 
through a zone of communications that must 
add greatly to the magnitude of the divisional 
slice. Nonetheless, when we have made all 
these allowances we still are left with our 
lesson to learn. The West cannot afford to 
put so few of its soldiers into battle.?Bras-
my's Annual, The Armed Forces Yearbook, 
1951, pp. 261-2. 
Materiel 
Intelligence on ground forces materiel is gained 
through detailed information on ordnance, signal, 
and engineer equipment, quartermaster, chemical, 
and medical supplies. Tables of characteristics 
must be prepared for specific items in each cate-
gory of ordnance and quality as well as quantity 
described. Quartermaster supplies include uni-
form, insignia, decorations, individual and unit 
equipment. Any experimentation with new items 
of materiel should be noted. Often the Quarter-
master Corps is currently engaged in a number of 
research projects to determine the adaptability 
of such things as clothing for certain weather con-
ditions, and the Engineers may be testing a new 
type of portable bridge. Information on medical 
supplies, facilities, and equipment are important 
in evaluating the combat effectiveness of the army 
in the field. The existence, for example, of a 
national blood bank for military use should not 
escape the analyst's notice. 
Obviously every nut and bolt cannot be de-
scribed, and so the problem becomes one of se-
lection of significant items representative of type 
and class. Photographs or sketches are always 
helpful. It is in this subdivision of armed forces 
intelligence that technical intelligence makes its 
greatest contribution. Conclusions reached by 
the technical evaluator often have far wider im-
plications than those apparent from the examina-
tion of an individual piece of equipment. 
NAVAL FORCES 
To make an appraisal of the naval forces of a 
foreign country the factors considered are in prin-
ciple much the same as those for the ground forces. 
Organization, strength and disposition, strategic 
and tactical doctrine, personnel, training, logistics, 
and materiel have a similar bearing on the deter-
mination of strengths and weaknesses. Com-
parisons with the U. S. Navy and American 
equivalents of nomenclature will give proper per-
spective to the study of foreign navies. 
Organization 
In addition to diagrams showing the overall 
command and administration of the navy, maps 
outlining the naval districts, and discussion of the 
functions of the more important department and 
staff components of the naval establishment, spe-
cial attention should be given to naval communi-
cations. The organization of naval communica-
tions networks, and the various existing naval 
communications facilities can also be graphically 
presented on charts and maps. 
Tactical and administrative organization of the 
forces afloat should include shipboard organiza-
tion of typical units. Shore support activities, 
and their relation to the fleet should be described. 
If quasi-naval organizations, such as Coast 
Guard, Coast Artillery, Coast Watchers, and Ma-
rine Corps are not adequately covered in the pre-
ceding sections on the armed forces as a whole, 
these should be properly included here. 
Strength and Disposition 
The disposition of ships into fleets and forces, 
names, types, and status of individual units can 
be presented in tabular form. Such information 
is never static, so the analyst should keep a card 
file on each naval vessel on which entries can be 
made to keep location and status up-to-date. The 
number of vessels in "mothballs," those used for 
reserve training, and those undergoing extensive 
repairs or alterations in shipyards should be clearly 
indicated. 
The total number of naval personnel should be 
broken down according to rank and rate, regular 
and reserve. The proportion serving in ships and 
at the shore activities of the naval establishment 
should be shown.

sion with the forces available are fundamental con-

siderations in a strategic estimate. What factors 
influence naval thinking and strategic concepts? 
Are naval problems of real national concern, or 
must the navy wage annual battles with the legis-
lature to obtain an adequate operating budget? 
How is naval doctrine formulated? Is it in-
fluenced particularly by war experiences? Has 
the navy developed independent of foreign influ-
ences? What are the naval traditions of the 
country? 
Every country which has a navy will also have 
a naval construction and development program. 
The political and economic factors bearing upon 
such plans must be noted. The Scandinavian 
countries, for example, are developing navies suit-
able for coast defense and operation in restricted 
waters. The U. S. S. R. has been concentrating 
on submarines, destroyers, and light cruisers. Any 
foreign alliances the country may have will also 
influence naval policy and planning. 
Personnel 
The considerations which applied to army per-
sonnel can serve as a guide to examination of the 
personnel of the navy: corps and services, rank 
and rate structure, procurement, conditions of serv-
ice for both officers and enlisted men, uniforms 
and insignia. United States Navy equivalents of 
rank are important items of information in ob-
serving naval honors when United States naval 
vessels are visiting foreign ports or when a foreign 
naval vessel comes to our shores. 
Reserve, Mobilization, and Training 
The recommissioning of ships in time of war, 
the naval reserve organization, the extent to which 
the merchant marine can augment the navy, and 
the adequacy of the mobilization system are major 
considerations. The effectiveness of the training 
system for officers and men must be assessed, in 
basic and specialist schools ashore, on shipboard, 
and in maneuvers of fleets and forces. Any spe-
cial methods of instruction should be described; 
for example, the extent to which visual aids are 
employed, the realistic nature of exercises, or the 
use of educational facilities outside the navy. 
Logistics 
In addition to a description of the system of 
procurement and supply of naval materiel, the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
policy in the construction, repair, and maintenance 
of naval vessels should be noted. Are naval or 
private shipyards in the country capable of doing 
all kinds of such work? Must the navy rely on 
foreign sources for any essential items? Where 
are the main naval depots located? Does the navy 
have fuel supply problems? 
Ship Design and Characteristics 
Of interest for strategic intelligence purposes 
is the adequacy of ship design for operations in 
certain areas. A ship designed for use in the 
waters of the North Sea may be entirely unsuited 
for tropical waters due to lack of an air condition-
ing system. Arctic operations also require special 
ship design features. If amphibious operations 
are included in the navy's capabilities, careful at-
tention should be given to the charactertistics of 
landing ships and craft. If there are aircraft 
carriers in the fleet, their strategic characteristics 
must be assessed in relation to the capabilities or 
vulnerablities of naval air forces. 
158 
Materiel 
Tabular summaries of the characteristics of all 
types of naval materiel are required: guns and 
ammunition, torpedoes, mines, antisubmarine 
weapons, electronic and communications equip-
ment. Any deficiencies in quality or supply of 
particular items which affect the capabilities of 
certain ships, or of the navy as a whole, are 
significant considerations in strategic intelligence. 
AIR FORCE 
A strategic estimate of a nation's air forces 
must give consideration to the same factors as 
previously applied to the army and navy. The 
naval air arm, if such exists, can either be included 
with land-based air or discussed in connection 
with the navy. The analyst must take care to 
emphasize salient points of strength and weakness. 
In the light of the mission of the air forces, a 
careful study should be made of their capabilities, 
both as regards aircraft and personnel. Doctri-
nal concepts in the utilization of available aircraft 
in time of war must be studied. 
Tactical Air Support

general, must be considered. In close air sup-

port, air action is integrated with the fire and 
movement of friendly ground forces against hos-
tile targets or objectives. General air support 
comprises air operations against enemy air activi-
ties, ground elements, installations, and lines of 
communication which assist the supported ground 
forces but are not in such proximity that inte-
gration with their fire and movements is required. 
The capabilities of the air force in respect to both 
types of support, must be determined. The maxi-
mum number and types of aircraft that can be 
assigned to such missions initially and on a sus-
tained basis are important factors. Evaluation 
criteria will be performance in past wars and 
the emphasis given tactical air support in cur-
rent training programs. The air forces doctrine 
in tactical air operations must be compared to that 
of the USAF and the USMC. 
Strategic Air Capabilities 
Here the analyst is concerned with the maxi-
mum number and types of bombers available ini-
tially and on a sustained basis. Range, bomb-
load, maintenance of aircraft, availability of pilots 
and crews, location of bases, and many technical 
matters enter into such an estimate. 
The country's air defense system, that is, its 
ability to resist foreign air operations, is closely 
allied to offensive capabilities. Interest will cen-
ter on the air defense organization, warning and 
intercept systems, including electronic equipment, 
types and deployment of aircraft defense units, 
and the effectiveness of antiaircraft artillery. De-
tails will include types of radar, antiaircraft guns 
and fire control equipment, guided missiles, bal-
loon barrage, searchlights, airborne electronic 
equipment, and techniques in electronic counter-
measures. The average analysts will require a 
great deal of expert technical assistance in the 
compilation of such data. 
Another capability to which attention should be 
given is related to strategic air reconnaissance. 
With what types of planes is reconnaissance con-
ducted? What types of cameras are used? How 
skillful are the nation's photographic technicians 
and photo interpreters? 
Air Order of Battle 
Air Order of Battle, similar to that of the army, 
provides data on identification, strength, and gen-
159 
eral disposition of the units, personnel, and equip-
ment of the air forces. Units are described by 
types, mission, and location, with comments on ex-
tent of training, experience, and combat readiness. 
Aircraft and equipment are identified according 
to the numbering system, special markings, and 
insignia. Source and number of aircraft acqui-
sitions are included. 
The background for order of battle data is a 
thorough study of the organizational relationship 
of major and subordinate commands and units, 
general control, and administrative and staff func-
tions at all echelons. Again as a standard of com-
parison it is helpful to have an understanding of 
the organizational components of the United 
States Air Force, the types of aircraft included 
in the complement of each, how service and supply 
functions are administered, and what facilities are 
needed for effective operation. 
Training 
The training program of a nation's air force is 
most significant for the strategic analyst. He 
must evaluate its effectiveness in meeting the cur-
rent requirements of the air forces, its capability 
for wartime expansion, and the adequacy of train-
ing equipment and facilities. Primary, basic, and 
advanced flight training are each considered with 
respect to duration in months, location of schools, 
curriculum content, number of trainees admitted 
annually, types of aircraft used, special training 
aids, and quality of instruction. A consideration 
of operational training will include such aspects 
as gunnery, rocketry, bombing, navigation, instru-
ment training, night flying, and combat tactics for 
each type of aircraft. The training of ground offi-
cers and airmen in such key specialties as opera-
tions, weather, engineering, supply, communica-
tions, and radar must not be overlooked. 
Many foreign countries have sent air forces per-
sonnel to the United States for training or obser-
vation. The analyst should attempt to determine 
the effect this contact with American training 
methods has had upon training policy and doctrine 
in the country from which the visitors have come. 
Often their experiences have strongly influenced 
relations between the two nations in areas other 
than military.

Air Facilities 
INTELLIGENCE FOR 
Strategic intelligence regarding a foreign air 
force includes a complete description and assess-
ment of the air facilities of the nation. Each fa-
cility must be analyzed to determine its suitabil-
ity for combat air operations and capability for 
airlift activity in support of combat operations. 
Maps, diagrams, and photos are necessary ad-
juncts to a thorough appraisal. Current and pro-
jected construction should be included, and special 
attention given to possibilities for extension of 
runways and general expansion of installations. 
Climate and topography are often controlling fac-
tors in a nation's development of air facilities. 
Any limitations caused by these factors in certain 
areas should be ascertained. The meteorological 
services of the country and the use the air forces 
make of them are pertinent in this connection. 
Other Considerations 
The study and evaluation of personnel, reserve 
and mobilization systems, logistics, and materiel 
of foreign air forces will embody the same gen-
eral considerations as were previously outlined for 
the army and navy, with variations in details as 
applicable. 
BIOGRAPHICAL INTELLIGENCE 
Biographical intelligence has the important 
function of providing information on individual 
persons in foreign countries and, as has been pre-
viously suggested, this component of intelligence 
is essential to all of the others. Knowledge about 
leaders in government, politics, science, education, 
military services, and business will not only be 
helpful in evaluating aspects of these general 
fields, but also may provide valuable clues to prob-
able courses of action. The background, person-
ality, enthusiasms, and prejudices of such indi-
viduals constitute vital considerations in an eval-
uation of national strengths and weaknesses. In 
the sociological component the people are consid-
ered collectively and characteristics common to 
groups are ascertained; biographic intelligence re-
fines this study, centering interest on the dominant 
figures within the groups. 
Obviously the intelligence researcher cannot 
keep extensive data on all individuals. His pri-
CONFIDENTIAL 
160 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
mary task is therefore one of selection, but he can-
not be limited to only those prominent in the con-
temporary scene. He should always be conscious 
of the fact that leaders of tomorrow may now be 
in relative obscurity, but there may be signs point-
ing to rising eminence or power. 
The sources of biographical information are 
many. In a great number of countries volumes 
similar to the American "Who's Who" are pub-
lished at regular intervals, and official registers 
list persons in government service. The daily 
newspapers and a great variety of periodicals will 
always contain additional information. Most 
valuable of all are character and personality esti-
mates from those who know or have known the 
individual professionally and socially. 
The paragraphs below will serve as a guide to 
the content of the ideal biographical file. It will 
not always be possible to obtain all the data for 
every individual but the goal is defined. 
Vital Statistics 
The items to include are those usual for identi-
fication purposes: full name, nationality, reli-
gion, residence address, date and place of birth, 
general appearance, parents, etc. Uniformity in 
spelling geographical names and in trans-literat-
ing from foreign languages which do not use the 
Latin alphabet is essential to a good biographical 
file. Valuable aids in this respect are standard 
gazeteers such as that published by the Board of 
Geographic Names of the Department of the In-
terior, and the Style Manual of the United States 
Government Printing Office. 
Education 
The data here should include schools attended, 
degrees conferred, and academic honors. Extra-
curricular activities can also be significant. If 
the individual became the disciple of a certain 
professor at an early age it may be reflected in his 
later thought and attitudes. His foreign language 
proficiency is another important consideration. 
Personality 
Thus far the biographical file has merely com-
piled a vita for the selected individual. When 
we come to personality, intelligence begins to be 
produced. An evaluation must be made of the

uunnuENTIAL 
personality traits which govern his behavior: 
moral force and character, intelligence, personal 
characteristics, opinions, and loyalty. Does he 
have marked qualities of leadership? Is he a man 
of strong convictions or are his opinions easily 
changed by others? Are his ideas of right and 
wrong well defined? Is he honest? 
Those who have associated with the individual 
can supply the best answers to questions concern-
ing his mental abilities, but much can be derived 
also from any books or articles he has written or 
his published utterances. Does he quickly compre-
hend new ideas and can he rise to the occasion 
when he meets the unusual? Is he well educated 
in the sense that he has a broad understanding of 
local and international affairs? Has his perspec-
tive been enhanced by travel abroad and contacts 
with a great variety of people? Does he have cer-
tain distinct prejudices? Is he pro- or anti-
American? 
Personal characteristics comprise another con-
sideration. Is he energetic or lazy? What are his 
drinking and eating habits? What are his usual 
forms of recreation? In what social circles does 
he move? Is he bold or cautious? What is the 
state of his health and does it affect his activity? 
Is he loyal to his country and his superiors? 
Does he inspire loyalty in others? 
Family 
Family position or influence must not be over-
looked. Often an ambitious wife is "the power 
behind the throne." Family ties are important 
269196-54 12 
161 
influences in the lives of men, and are often mir-
rored in their careers. Is he a family man? Has 
he used family connections in any way to achieve 
certain goals or ambitions? Does he have children 
whom he is encouraging to follow in his footsteps? 
Relationship of Factors 
Only a final consideration of all the above fac-
tors in the aggregate will give a complete picture 
of the individual's administrative ability, profes-
sional competence, disposition, tact, sobriety, inter-
national sympathies and attitudes. Biographical 
intelligence thus can be used to great advantage in 
strategic estimates. It is intimately related to any 
field where names make news. 
The objective of the foregoing discussion has 
been to outline broadly the logical division of in-
telligence knowledge into component parts, and 
to indicate to a degree their nature, comprehen-
siveness, interrelationships, importance, uses, and 
sources. The applicability and utility of this great 
body of knowledge in relation to current world 
problems is suggested by the following three 
chapters which are, in effect, topical summaries 
in the field of international relations: elements of 
world power, factors in the foreign relationships 
of the United States, and salient features of World 
Communism and the U. S. S. R. These chapters 
will also contribute to the development of the 
naval officer's perspective in his approach to mat-
ters of intelligence concern.

CHAPTER 6 
ELEMENTS OF WORLD POWER 
In approaching a study of international rela-
tions a naval officer assigned to intelligence duties 
should keep in mind three basic points. First, a 
nation's power position in relation to other nations 
of the world is determined by its comparative 
strength in various of the categories described in 
the previous chapter as the components of intelli-
gence knowledge. Second, a nation's strategy to-
ward other nations is influenced directly or 
indirectly by its own relative standing in one or 
more of these categories. Third, in the exercise of 
national power there have developed in the course 
of modern history certain recognized procedural 
patterns which apply to relationships between 
nations. A valuable aid to such a study is an 
understanding of the elements of world power and 
their effect on the behavior of nations. 
For many years, problems of international 
power relations were viewed in a somewhat de-
tached manner by the United States, and its 
peoples tended to adopt an idealistic approach. 
World War II and subsequent events had a tre-
mendous impact on that point of view and ap-
proach; the United States found itself directly 
involved in problems of world dimension and its 
idealism attacked. However, as an aid to finding 
solutions, America's idealism is a vital factor, a 
very real force that must be preserved, for it repre-
sents the symbol of personal freedom and justice in 
a chaotic and frustrated world. But idealism is 
not to be confused with a denial of realities or of 
the basic facts relating to them. Perhaps for the 
first time in American and world history there is 
much more at stake than the survival of present 
political institutions. The very structure of our 
social life is threatened. Modern technology 
makes all parts of the world accessible to every 
other, and philosophies opposed to our own are for 
the first time organized and regimented on a world 
scale. Therefore, a sober concentration on solu-
tions to problems of international relations is 
essential, not only for our own survival, but also 
for the survival of those peoples with whom we 
have kinship of spirit and tradition. 
163 
STRATEGIC GEOGRAPHY AND RESOURCE 
POTENTIAL 
Consideration of a nation's total power potential 
involves all elements of its national power and 
especially those of geography, resources, industrial 
capacity, manpower, and technology. In study-
ing these elements separately, the intelligence offi-
cer, whatever his individual role, must have an 
appreciation of the whole, an understanding of 
how the particular facts he collects and assesses 
ultimately compose the total estimate of a nation's 
power. It will be helpful to discuss the elements 
of world power from the point of view of the 
United States. 
Geographical Environment 
Let us begin with a consideration of our geo-
graphical environment. In this world, man lives 
principally on the large scattered islands known 
as continents, and on lesser archipelagos. He has 
made his greatest progress and shows the greatest 
ambition in the temperate, lowland, regions. His 
growing numbers and changing technology have 
brought new stresses in the age-old fight for con-
trol of resources. In ancient times, the struggle 
was for hunting, grazing, and agricultural lands. 
Historically speaking, as a newcomer on the 
planet, man has only recently developed written 
languages and a real technology. The industrial 
revolution and modern economic society date only 
from the time of our most immediate ancestors, 
within the last two centuries. Snowballing prog-
ress and new ambitions have centered major rival-
ries on control of natural resources, manpower, 
transport routes, strategic positions, and mass 
markets. 
We in America find ourselves occupying a rich 
continent newly settled in large numbers, with a 
culture largely western European, which was 
earlier subject to the civilizing influenced of Rome, 
Greece and the Middle East. Our continent, 
North America, in one sense is isolated by two 
great oceans from the principal land mass of the

FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
world: Eurasia-Africa. In another sense, our iso-
lation is quite ephemeral when our map is not the 
traditional Mercator but a globe or polar projec-
tion. In an age when jet aircraft, even following 
the traditional routes, cross the ocean in a few 
hours, and guided missiles on the drawing boards 
will cross it in a few minutes, any vestigial ideas 
of geographic isolation must be discarded. 
Our technology is now so complex that what-
ever our military isolation or defenses at home 
may be, full exploitation of our industry and our 
acquired consumption habits require access to re-
sources far from our own frontiers. Possibly 
only the United States and the Soviet Union would 
be capable of maintaining their present living pat-
terns from the resources within their own bound-
aries. Even then our own high standard of living 
would definitely be cut, and higher production 
costs would be accompanied by plaguing short-
ages of key materials for which only inferior sub-
stitutes would be available. 
Economic isolation is only one aspect of the 
problem, for should we retreat within our own 
walls, the smaller nations of the world, if organ-
ized or dominated by an aggressive power, would 
in time far surpass even our own great industrial 
and military potential, and today's new weapons 
would banish any possibility of real defense in 
depth. War in devastating form would come to 
our own hearths. 
Geographical Patterns 
Let us then consider what are the geographic 
patterns that govern what we and other nations 
must defend for survival, and what are the routes 
of attack, for these patterns should be basic keys 
to conflict and strategy in the world, without re-
gard to political organization or to ideology so 
long as mankind wars with his own species. 
We are concerned with the position, the terrain, 
the climate, the vegetation, the shape and size of 
land, the resources, and the population of each 
area or sovereign state. The power position of 
each nation will be affected in some degree by 
each of those elements. Power depends on mate-
rial factors, such as resources, capital goods, tech-
nology, and manpower; it also depends on in-
tangible factors that are harder to measure objec-
tively, such as the energy and central driving pur-
CONFIDENTIAL 
164 
pose, the steadfastness and traditions of a nation. 
Some peoples, who by every objective test should 
have disappeared long ago from the earth, have a 
staying power that has helped them to survive oc-
cupation, dismemberment, and deportation. 
Our first concern is with the tangible factors, 
the physical patterns. The reader should refer to 
a globe, if possible, and also to a good atlas, in-
cluding maps of physical relief, climate, and re-
sources distribution. Space here will not permit 
particular study, region by region, but the ap-
proach and viewpoint can be delineated. Think-
ing of the military and political and economic 
aspects, study your maps to observe the land and 
the water pattern of the world. Where are the 
land bridges that armies use? Where are water 
trade routes channelized for contending naval 
powers to dispute control? The patterns of 
mountain ranges, and of deserts are important, as 
well as the vegetation lines that indicate the shifts 
from tropical rain forest to savannahs to desert 
to steppe to temperate forest, and so on until the 
tree line and the various crop lines mark the polar 
or high central Asian regions. These changes give 
clues to the significance of regions in their poten-
tial for supporting man and his crops and ani-
mals, and for their effects on military movement. 
Throughout history military barriers to traffic-
ability and movement have dominated campaigns 
and their outcome. Changing technology has 
modified this only in part, for as men have in-
vented devices to overcome these barriers, so have 
they frequently found other tools to neutralize 
these advances. Deserts are of prime importance 
as barriers, whether they be dry deserts of the 
temperate and tropic areas or the frozen wastes 
where survival is always a problem. Mountains 
serve as great defense lines against military move-
ment, though, of course, the test of the barrier 
lies in the passes through it, not in the individual 
peaks of the main ramparts. Even open plains 
are a major obstacle when by season they alter-
nate between soft mud and windswept snow or 
cold. In some degree, swamps and marshes, 
jungles and rain forests, oceans and rivers chan-
nelize and restrict military movement, unless the 
means to bridge them are at hand. Invading 
forces from the sea find that coasts are not uni-
form in nature, and that only a few beaches and

ELEMENTS OF WORLD POWER 
ports lend themselves to mass invasion. Of 
course, there are man-made obstacles to military 
movement, but in contrast with nature's, they de-
serve scant attention here. 
With these general clues to factors affecting 
military movement, both history and the contem-
porary scene can be viewed in a new light as one 
studies problems of military and naval campaigns. 
A good grasp of the general position of countries, 
the barriers of terrain, vegetation, und climate 
that aid or hinder them, is basic to an understand-
ing of their power position. Clear recognition of 
the difference between oceanic and continental 
climates may give clues to the success or failure 
of campaigns. As a further uid to full under-
standing, one should study maps from several 
approaches. The geographic position of coun-
tries takes on new meaning when maps are turned 
in unconventional directions. It is only custom 
and convenience that makes us consider north as 
"up.,, 
Controlling Resources 
Historians theorize that modern civilization be-
gan as the last ice age receded, allowing the two 
keys of geography and resources to open the door 
to progress. In the ancient world of Egypt and 
Mesopotamia in the west, and in the protected val-
leys of Sinkiang and Kokonor in the east, simple 
communal living rapidly blossomed into complex 
civilizations. In the Middle East, rich alluvial 
plains with wild rice in abundance led to settled 
farming and the further domestication of animals 
which had begun in nomadic days on the grass 
lands of Asia. Sedentary living led to building 
cities, codifying laws, and written communica-
tion. In time, smelting metals, farming, and 
trade became widespread. 
Today the controlling resources include more 
than plentiful food, for the age of reason, ex-
perimentation, and exploration brought mechani-
cal inventions that depend on a wide range of 
natural resources. The key to national power 
today is not alone food, but energy derived from 
coal, oil, and, to a lesser extent, water power, and 
iron, which is still the chief metal, since the bronze 
age was left behind thousands of years ago. These 
are then the major elements of real power, but 
there are a host of others, strategic in nature, 
165 
CONFIDENTIAL 
whose particular properties support the alloys 
and specialties of metallurgy, the growing chemi-
cal, plastics, and electronic industries, newly dis-
covered methods in agriculture, and, of course, 
that new key to power, the development of nuclear 
energy. 
Food patterns are still important, for indus-
trialization and modern transport have developed 
dense concentrations of population which depend 
for survival upon orderly flow of their sustenance. 
Wheat, rice, corn, barley, sugar, fats and oils, 
fruits, beans, fish, meat and dairy products fill 
thousands of ships on the ocean highways of the 
world, and load the great rail networks across the 
continents. Shipments of tea, coffee, tobacco, and 
chocolate may also be considered essential, for they 
contribute to morale, one of the intangibles in 
national power. 
Industrial Location 
Modern economics has given importance to the 
theory of location of industrial activity. In 
simple terms, it recognizes that locations of raw 
materials, power, labor supply, and markets all 
interact with transport costs and material char-
acteristics to determine where industry is to be 
found. Changing technology alters the force of 
the various elements in the equation, but generally 
speaking, industry is drawn to the source of the 
materials it uses (if they are weight-losing in 
processing) , to save transport costs. Thus the 
modern dependence on mechanical power derived 
from coal, oil, or hydro-electricity tends to draw 
industry to these materials. Pittsburgh, the 
Ruhr, Manchuria, the English Midlands all dem-
onstrate this tendency. 
Some countries by strenuous efforts have tried 
to overcome their natural deficiencies, but they 
face a losing battle. Italy's large industrial popu-
lation tries to earn enough through trade to pay 
for imported coal. Japan, now restricted to her 
home islands, also depends heavily on imported 
materials. Even the United States, though well 
supplied with fuel, must consider the full military 
implications of replacing the ore from the nearly 
exhausted Mesabi range with ores from abroad, 
thus losing the advantage of cheap haul through 
the Great Lakes.

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Coal is still the dominant fuel of the world 
and must be ranked highest among essential mate-
rials for economic, and consequently military, 
strength. It generates steam to provide electric-
ity, has a major role in metallurgy, and can be 
used to make a host of chemical products including 
gasoline. Oil is a second important source, as a 
principal source of fuel for millions of internal 
combustion engines, and also as a raw material 
for the chemical industry which, among other 
things, supplies rubber substitutes. 
Iron and steel follow closely after fuel as major 
essentials, but the dominance of these particular 
resources should not make us disregard the vital 
though smaller role of copper, lead, manganese, 
sulphur, zinc, aluminum, nickel, and tin. 
Modern industry is built upon a great number 
of major and minor materials. Salt, phosphate, 
potash, mica, asbestos, industrial diamonds, 
graphite, nitrates, mercury?all are essentials. 
The metals that alloy with iron must be available 
if tools are to keep their cutting edges, if armor 
plate is to stop projectiles, or if springs are to keep 
their resilience. Likewise tungsten, antimony, 
chromium, palladium, and molybdenum must be 
added to manganese and nickel to expand the list 
of essential alloys. 
From our fields and plantations, in addition to 
food, come cotton, flax, and other hard and bast 
fibres?jute, abaca, sisal, ramie, and hemp. We 
also depend on wool, leather, hides, and bone. 
Rubber, though increasingly available in syn-
thetic form, is provided from the tropics. Our 
temperate area forests, wastefully cut until re-
cently, provide us with principal building mate-
rials, with paper, a modern-day essential, with 
raw materials for plastics, with distillates, and 
naval stores. 
Even water is an important resource, not only 
to quench our thirst and to water- our crops, but 
also for industry which consumes it in enormous 
quantities. It provides transport routes and hy-
dro-electric power, the latter of which can create 
nitrates for fertilizer and explosives directly from 
the atmosphere. Our electric power system, draw-
ing upon the energy of water, coal, oil, and gas, is 
a prime target for any enemy, and its growing size 
is an index of our strength. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
166 
Our resources are of two types: replaceable and 
irreplaceable. To date, modern technology and 
field exploration have kept our standard of living 
rising despite a profligate waste of irreplaceable 
resources. Perhaps the sea can be made to yield 
what can no longer be found on dry land, but defi-
nite dangers to our economic and military strength 
loom not far ahead. 
Strategic Materials 
We define strategic materials as those critically 
short in relation to our need for them. One of the 
prices of World War II was that it greatly ex-
panded the list of strategic materials the United 
States should stockpile or protect overseas, if our 
security is to be maintained. The appearance of 
an item on the strategic list should immediately 
set in motion measures to offset the potential dan-
ger of shortage. What steps are taken depend 
upon circumstances at the time, but among the 
possibilities are new searches at home for these 
materials, production controls and consumption 
restrictions, measures to assure overseas supply 
sources, creation of import stimulants and export 
quotas, assignment of necessary manpower to ex-
ploit sources of these materials, initiation of con-
servation and recovery measures, the adoption of 
special measures to prevent crippling sabotage of 
our limited supply, and the development of sub-
stitutes. Actually, in the case of many materials 
which are running short in usable form, there 
may be marginal and submarginal deposits that 
can be exploited, but the cost may well be inordi-
nate in time, manpower, and capital equipment. 
Resources in the ground or in the forest do not 
of themselves make for strength. Many richly 
potential stores of materials lie in undeveloped 
and weak countries. It is only with capital ac-
cumulation, know-how, manpower, and transport, 
that these resources are translated into power 
through production and delivery for use. 
Capacity To Produce 
0 ur assessment of a country's power must there-
fore measure not only its stores of materials but 
also its actual capacity to produce. Quantitative 
data of major semimanufactures and finished 
products give a part of the answer. These data 
in turn must be linked to plant capacity indices.

ELEMENTS OF WORLD POWER 
Are all plants operating at full capacity ? Are 
trained manpower, raw materials, power, and 
transport available to work more shifts? Next, 
we ask, can any of these plants readily be converted 
to the production of war goods? Tractor plants 
may make tanks. Automobile plants may switch 
to aircraft engines or subassemblies, or it may be 
that plant expansion will provide the answer to 
real military strength. If the building materials 
and machine tools can be set aside for use in new 
factories, rather than go directly into war produc-
tion, the eventual output of war goods may be very 
high. All of these matters are interrelated and 
very complex. Knowledge is still too inadequate 
concerning the relative effectiveness of price and 
tax incentives, or of government orders and con-
trols, to give categorical answers in all situations. 
It should be stressed that military power is not 
measured alone by the production indices of out-
put, capacity, conversion, and expansion, for 
civilian consumption may compete with military 
requirements. Thirty million tons of steel in one 
country may count for more militarily than one 
hundred million in another, if the latter country 
uses virtually all of its steel for civilian consump-
tion, as against heavy military use in the first. On 
the other hand, given a big enough crisis, the rich 
consumer country has a bigger cushion that can be 
diverted to military ends, or may at least launch 
a great program of plant expansion. These are 
imponderables that are solved only by careful and 
qualified analysis, not by catch phrases and popu-
lar fancy. For the length of the war, the sud-
denness of its coming, the temper of the people, 
the dispersion of facilities as protection against 
surprise air attack, are all variables that affect the 
answer. There have been numerous examples of 
the complexity of a partial mobilization in the 
time since the Korean War began. How far can 
taxes be pushed to curb inflation without drying 
up needed capital for expansion or reducing tra-
ditional incentives? Will controls aid fair dis-
tribution at low prices, or will they create a huge 
bureaucracy and reduce total supply? Well-
informed and patriotic Americans find themselves 
arriving at different answers. 
A number of agencies and offices of the executive 
branch of the United States Government, assisted 
by private research groups and congressional staff 
167 
CONFIDENTIAL 
studies, are involved in guiding the planning for 
war mobilization. From their work come the 
plans that direct stockpiling of essential materials, 
the mobilization manufacturing and control plans, 
and the assessments of national strength. A com-
plete assessment of our power must be compared 
step by step with that of our allies and our rivals 
to draw up the balance sheet that will indicate 
where there is need to expand, to divert, and to 
contract for national security essential to survival, 
but at the same time saving the mainsprings of 
long-range progress and traditional patterns of 
living. These agencies study agriculture, giving 
consideration to the methods used, manpower and 
materials demands, regularity and quantity of 
various crops, and availability of additional lands 
for expansion. The extractive industries of min-
ing, forestry, and fisheries yield data on output per 
worker, capital requirements, availability of re-
serves, and new processes becoming available. The 
basic metallurgical and chemical industries have 
indices of production, changing methods, and 
varying efficiencies; for example, blast furnaces 
serve as an index of productive capacity, yet one 
country may run them harder and faster than 
another to increase current yield of pig iron even 
at the expense of destruction of capital equipment. 
Study of the permanent munitions industries is 
important to the total picture, too. The shipyards, 
the explosives manufacturers and arsenals, and 
the atomic plants, are typical cases. Certain civil-
ian goods industries are particularly susceptible 
to military conversion. The television industry of 
America may have given civilians home receivers 
instead of those same resources going into a com-
plete air defense radar net, but at the same time, 
the existence of a huge electronics industry will 
supply the conversion capacity in war for radar 
on an immense scale, and the coaxial cables and 
microwave relay networks may speed military 
communications. The engineering and machine 
tool industries are important, because their ability 
to produce will determine ability to turn out novel 
weapons of war in time to use on a mass basis. 
Economic Vulnerability

gence, of those of other countries, there are spe-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
cific studies and individual conclusions which 
must next be undertaken. One area of concern is 
that of vulnerabilities, both here and in foreign 
countries. Is the flow of raw material subject to 
interruption, as, for example, the Soo Locks or 
the TAP line? Are there technological bottle-
necks in such industries as ball bearings or avia-
tion gas? Is capacity limited by poor transport 
facilities; for example, the Baku oil fields and Ven-
ezuelan iron ore? Is a specialized labor force 
available? Can watchmakers work on precision 
instruments? Do we have sufficient oil well rig-
gers? In what degree are different industries in-
terdependent or are they competing for a common 
labor or power supply? Is steel available for final 
products or for steel plant expansion? 
National power, too, is linked with defenses, for 
a great industrial machine unguarded is an invi-
tation to attack. Defenses may be active, made up 
of radar nets, jet fighters, balloon barrages, and 
AA guns, or they may be passive and equally 
effective, such as duplication of facilities, region-
ally decentralized into far reaches of the country, 
or locally dispersed from the center of urban areas 
to offer targets of lower density and therefore less 
attractiveness. In some cases facilities may re-
treat to hilly country or even underground. 
Transport Assessment 
Increasingly, transport is being subjected to 
analysis and study, for it is a major factor in 
power. Britain's plan for agricultural develop-
ment in Tanganyika, many other "backward" area 
development plans, and Soviet strength all have 
suffered from poor transport. Even the United 
States must consider the repercussions in the long 
run of low railway earnings, and of inadequate 
highway modernization. Assessments must there-
fore be made of facilities, as to capacity, efficiency 
in ton-miles per day, and per worker, repair and 
fuel needs, the bottlenecks in marshalling yards, 
bridges, tunnels, and steep grades. 
It is difficult to measure foreign progress ade-
quately due to incomplete statistics. Figures are 
rarely comparable, frequently are withheld, and 
often lack meaning due to inadequate qualification 
and definition. If only a few figures are to be 
chosen, the key ones for national power should in-
clude electric energy production, steel production, 
CONFIDENTIAL 
168 
and transport data such as car loadings, and ton-
miles hauled. 
Manpower Assessment 
Manpower has already been mentioned; it rep-
resents a significant measure of power both for 
the present and for the future of a country, when 
coupled with information on geography, raw ma-
terials, and industry. Mere numbers alone, or 
even the military age numbers, are only the begin-
ning for a power analysis. The data on numbers 
must be supplemented by detailed breakdowns on 
distribution by geographical location, and by den-
sity in relation to developed resources. Trends 
are important. Is the population stationary, ris-
ing, or falling? If it is rising, what is the rate 
of increase? At what height and when will the 
population level off? The sex-age group distri-
bution or pyramid will tell what the labor force 
and the military supply will be now, 10 years from 
now, and even farther in the future. The supply 
of females of child-bearing age, related to other 
data, will forecast shifts in the population. Quali-
tative population analysis will help to assess some 
of the intangibles of national power. The break-
downs by education, cultural background, and 
technical skill are important. Tables on national 
origin, political parties, and religion may give 
important leads to questions of national cohe-
sion. Economic groupings, tied to national and 
personal income statistics or land holdings, may 
answer questions on the appeal of communism or 
land redistribution. Although social scientists 
may quarrel with the statistical validity of mass 
personality traits, from a purely pragmatic view 
there seems to be definite value in studying typical 
traits of national character, for they may give 
clues to determination, objectives, subjectivity to 
hysteria or impatience, and other elements that 
influence an assessment of foreign nations' 
behavior. 
In the long run, national population trends will 
have their effects on the power position and foreign 
policies of countries. Medical, economic, intel-
lectual, and religious environment factors affect 
birth rates and death rates as well. A shift in 
either rate will affect population growth. Al-
though we have come a long way from the pessi-
mism of Malthus, the growth of the total world

population can be a subject of grave concern. 
Density data as such are meaningless in isolation, 
for Australia will never catch up with the United 
States, despite her area, and China has nothing like 
the overall density of the Netherlands, yet is prob-
ably more "overcrowded." Net reproduction 
rates, adjusted for migration and possible life 
span changes, are key data to power calculations. 
Total Power Potential 
These elements reviewed in the foregoing sec-
tion, then, are the basis for estimating the total 
power potential of a nation. No one element is 
dominant, neither industry, nor resources, nor 
manpower, but all are considered jointly with 
questions of geographical location, climate, and 
topography. Also important are the questions of 
vulnerability, of trends as well as of present situa-
tion, or capacity to produce munitions as well as 
total industrial capacity. By no means can the 
intangibles of national spirit and determination be 
ignored, and in this day and age the ability to 
adapt national life to so-called "Cold War" may 
rival in importance the strictly conventional mo-
bilization of the nation. This brings us to the 
next topic, the bridge between the assessment of 
national resources, in the broad sense, and politi-
cal relations among nations, namely, geopolitics. 
GEOPOLITICS AND STRATEGY 
The formal study of all the aforementioned 
power factors in relation to geography and na-
tional strategy is called geopolitics, a term that 
has been made unsavory only because of its mis-
application by Nazi theorists. The scientific 
study of geopolitics is not only proper, but es-
sential to our national well-being. It is of par-
ticular interest to intelligence analysts because of 
its possible influence on the thinking of foreign 
political leaders and, hence, on the strategic plan-
ning of various nations. A knowledge of geo-
political concepts may give clues, therefore, to esti-
mates of national behavior. Treatment of this 
subject here can only be cursory. 
Mackinder and Mahan 
In 1904, an Englishman, Mackinder, introduced 
the concept of the world island with its heartland, 
safe from assault by seapower. The heartland is 
169 
described as the territory encompassing much of 
the Soviet Union and the suzerainties under nomi-
nal Chinese control, such as Sinkiang, Mongolia, 
and Tibet. The lands around the edge of the 
world island, which can be dominated by seapower, 
are referred to as the marginal crescent. The 
Americas are regarded as an outer island. Of 
course, such concepts are meaningful only in a 
limited sense, for new map projections, air travel 
and guided missiles rob the heartland concept of 
considerable meaning. The concepts are impor-
tant, however, because they have influenced the 
thinking and policies of many leaders since Mack-
inder's time. The idea "whoever controls the 
heartland controls the world island; whoever con-
trols the world island controls the world" is an 
oversimplification, and although it has an ele-
ment of truth, it is not a substitute for the careful 
and detailed analysis of national power previously 
recommended. 
Mahan of the United States Navy was the great 
exponent of sea power. His voluminous writings 
do not precisely delineate seapower, but general 
concepts can be derived from them. Seapower is 
related to the control of the commercial arteries of 
the world. It is the outgrowth of proper access to 
the sea coupled with the industry necessary to sup-
port merchant ships and navies. The right bal-
ance of fleets, control of strategic bases and fuel 
supplies, good training and morale, all combine to 
create sea power. Mahan felt that no nation has 
the ability and capital to be both a great sea power 
and a great land power, either one resulting in a 
serious drain on resources. Although in some 
way a comforting doctrine, it may not be com-
pletely valid. 
Other influential writers in this field were Ratzel 
in Germany, Semple in the United States, and 
Kjellen in Sweden. Ratzel believed that geog-
raphy dominated history, and he considered the 
state as a living organism. Coordinating his 
theories of selection and survival with those of 
Darwin, he attributed a spatial aggrandizement 
instinct to states? a theory somewhat difficult to 
support as a universal law. Semple was a disciple 
of Ratzel. Kjellen considered the state as not 
just a legal entity but as a living being. It was 
he who coined the expression "geopolitics," and in-
fluenced the pan-German movement, believing that

one German state should spread from Scandinavia 
to the Near East. 
The American, Spykman, instead of opposing 
seapower to land power, envisioned seapower as 
joining with land power in one part of the world 
to fight similar combinations elsewhere. Consid-
ering interior communications to be poor, he put 
stress on control of the rimland rather than the 
heartland and believed that the United States must 
oppose any attempt to dominate the rimland or 
crescent. 
German Interpretations 
Under the aegis of Hitler, Germany adapted 
Mahan's and Mackincler's doctrines to her own 
ends, with General Haushofer as the chief 
prophet. The Auslands organization and Geo-
politic Institute combined studies of geopolitics 
with an intelligence collection program for plan-
ning Germany's strategy. 
Haushofer considered that a Soviet-Japanese 
combination of land and sea power would be dan-
gerous. Because of improved land transport, he 
tended to discount seapower and thought that if 
Germany could move to dominate Eurasia, its 
position as world leader would be assured. Spe-
cifically, he favored a number of policies which 
markedly influenced Hitlerite Germany. These 
included autarchy, (national economic self-suffi-
ciency), "lebensraum" (enough space for a vigo-
rous, growing people), and a three-way split of 
the world, in which the United States would domi-
nate pan-America, Germany would dominate 
Europe including Russia, the Middle East, and 
Africa, and Japan would dominate Asia and the 
South Pacific. He saw German control of the 
marginal crescent as a means to add seapower to 
her land power. Also he believed that a nation's 
frontier should be along a natural boundary, for 
any other frontier represented no more than a 
temporary truce line in time of peace. Peacetime, 
further, was viewed just as a breathing spell be-
tween wars, a time to out-flank and encircle the 
enemy. International agreements were to build 
balance of power, not world security. 
All the great powers in considerable degree 
have operated geopolitically, whether they recog-
nized the fact or not. Their use of geopolitics may 
have been more or less benevolent, or it may have 
CONFIDENTIAL 
170 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
been aggressive. The Truman Plan of contain-
ment represents an application of Mackinder's 
theories. Although unable or unwilling to strike 
at the heartland, the United States has been de-
termined to prevent the heartland leaders from 
seizing all of the marginal crescent that might 
allow them to add seapower to their land power, 
and thus dominate the world. 
Many of these geopolitical concepts need re-
finement and modification in the light of the 
changing conditions. Atomic concepts of war-
fare and power may well modify accessibility in 
the military sense. The Arctic no longer repre-
sents a dead space, but rather a crucial direct air 
route between the power centers of the world. 
The concept of imperial domination has been re-
placed by that of consultation as a guiding rule 
in the relationships between many world states. 
Airpower Concepts 
To Mahan's doctrine of seapower and the Ger-
man-Soviet doctrines of land power have been 
added the doctrine of air power, first formulated 
by General Billy Mitchell and Douhet, and later 
vigorously presented to the public by Major de 
Seversky, an ardent enthusiast. While this doc-
trine has given rise to heated debates involving 
the concepts of a dominant arm versus balanced 
military forces of approximately equal strength, 
it may be concluded that sea power, land power, 
and air power each have their potentialities and 
limitations in the determination of national power. 
To summarize, it must be admitted that history 
has been strongly influenced by geography, that 
defense in depth is a valid and compelling mili-
tary doctrine. Though the heartland and rim-
land ideas have strong elements of truth, how-
ever, modern world power is based not only on 
location and size and shape, but also on resources, 
demography, technology, and transport. 
Power Politics 
The United States in its public conscience has 
disparaged power politics as an unworthy force, 
and as a poor approach to world relations. Yet 
the existence and use of power politics is ines-
capable, whatever this doctrine is called. We are 
concerned with power to control the minds and 
actions of men, particularly men organized to do 
jointly what individuals could not do. Power is

ELEMENTS 
OF WORLD POWER 
not force in its actual exercise, but it does imply 
fear of force. United States power has been in-
creased by possession of the A-Bomb, even though 
its use is potential. This power would be reduced 
if controls were placed on its use, such as prior 
approval by the United Nations or even by Con-
gress, since speed of reprisal may be the most 
potent deterrent to a would-be aggressor. Eco-
nomic power can also be used for national power 
purposes. Control over exports of finished goods 
and raw materials needed by other countries is an 
enormous source of power. There will be power 
politics so long as nations keep their sovereignty. 
If a few "enlightened" nations eschew its use, 
they will be destroyed by the unenlightened. 
Power politics may be used merely to hold exist-
ing positions, the status quo, to improve position 
through expansionism or imperialism, or to main-
tain prestige by demonstrating that power. 
INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL RELATIONS 
It is very hard to be entirely objective in dis-
cussing international political relations. Each 
nation tends to view its own conduct as above 
criticism and the conduct of others as frequently 
reprehensible. Even more, nations may often be 
unjustly charged with responsibility for an in-
ternational situation because of the great difficulty 
in accurately and correctly identifying the events 
which led to the particular situation. 
Any assessment for intelligence purposes must 
be impartial and analytical: motivations both of 
the nation and its leaders must be carefully stud-
ied. Certain general guides which may be help-
ful in making any evaluations involving interna-
tional relations are presented in this section. 
The "Status Quo" 
There is nothing especially sacrosanct about the 
status quo, though this is a pretension of those 
who are satisfied with it. The Congress of Vi-
enna, the Versailles Treaty, and the United Na-
tions have all had some part in maintaining things 
as they were. It should be pointed out that status 
quo does not refer to freezing of existing boun-
daries, though on occasion it may take that form, 
but rather to maintaining an existing balance of 
power. Those who maintain existing situations, 
even though unfair, may have the weight of inter-
CONFIDENTIAL 
national law behind them and be the upholders of 
"peace." All challengers, of course, are called 
"war mongers," regardless of the cause for which 
they struggle. Certainly, those who would resort 
to force carry the burden of justification for their 
acts, and their propaganda is rarely adequate, or 
accurate. 
Imperialism 
As opposed to the status quo, imperialism repre-
sents an attempt to bring about a favorable duinge 
in a current world power situation. It refers to 
a nation's policy aimed at an extension of power 
over another area with or without the approval of 
the peoples concerned. The motives, and the 
means, for gaining this additional power may be 
economic, political, military, or ideological, or a 
combination thereof. Any analysis of this phe-
nomenon of national behavior will result in the 
conclusion that it is exceedingly complex. 
For many years, the term imperialism has been 
in disrepute as the result, partly at least, of its 
association with the policies of colonialism and 
territorial aggrandizement carried on by various 
European nations during the latter nineteenth 
century at the expense of backward areas. Dur-
ing that time, a predominant motive was eco-
nomic competition, coupled with the search for 
larger markets and sources of food and raw ma-
terials. However, there were other motives, such 
as the desire for expanded political power and 
prestige which might exert a dominating influence 
in world affairs, the real or assumed need for pro-
viding greater guarantees for national security, 
and the search for sources of potential military 
manpower as well as areas of expansion for sur-
plus population. 
There are curious inconsistencies in the inter-
pretation of this term. Mussolini found it an 
expression of a nation's vitality. Marx and Lenin 
explained it as entirely a product of capitalism, a 
"dying" stage in which there was an inevitable 
struggle between national monopolies in the inter-
national arena. They reasoned that by definition 
communism could not be imperialistic because it 
did not have the same need for new markets and 
trade. In popular fancy, imperialism has been 
associated with the "machinations" of Wall Street 
and the munitions makers, the Japanese Zaibatsu

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
emperor-worship, or the exploitation of colonial 
subjects. But these interpretations are inade-
quate, since imperialism predates modern capital-
ism by thousands of years and, from the American 
viewpoint, communist and socialist states have 
demonstrated positive imperialistic tendencies, re-
gardless of the labels used. 
The policy of imperialism has been considered 
one of the causes of war. Wars actually arise for 
many reasons which are usually composite and 
complex in nature. There are so called "defen-
sive" wars, designed to keep the status quo, but 
which often seek a permanent change in power to 
prevent effective challenge to present positions. 
Other wars are deliberately designed to expand 
the power position of a country, even when it is 
not threatened. The power vacuum theory applies 
in some cases, too, when the strong powers, rush-
ing to dominate a newly weakened or discovered 
area, clash in their efforts for supremacy. This 
situation has been more recently demonstrated in 
Greece and Korea. A few aggressive nations, 
either for supposedly lofty or for very base rea-
sons, have also set out deliberately to conquer the 
world by one means or another. 
Can compromise be considered a solution to the 
ambitions of such aggressive states? Repeated 
examples from history, some quite recent, seem to 
suggest that, at best, compromise may only shift 
the time table for further aggression. This may 
not be wholly bad for the compromiser, providing 
he can use this time to good advantage. Rearm-
ing and defense pacts, important and inescapable 
as they may be, are not in themselves an absolute 
guarantee of peace, for they may create a vicious 
circle of counter moves by the opponents, with no 
solution short of military, economic, and psycho-
logical conflict. 
Many excuses have been given for imperialism?
the "white man's burden," a "sacred trust," "leb-
ensraum," "ethnic unity," "defense against en-
circlement," and others more idealistic, such as 
"liberty, equality, fraternity." We considered 
both world wars anti-imperialist, and of course 
for opposite reasons they were so regarded by 
many Germans and Japanese fighting against us. 
The Monroe Doctrine could be considered either 
status quo or imperialist, depending on the view-
point and circumstances of assessment. How-
CONFIDENTIAL 
172 
ever, from an objective point of view, it should be 
understood that these terms, the status quo and 
imperialism, are intrinsically and morally neither 
good nor bad. What these terms actually mean 
when applied in international relations depend 
upon the objectives, motivation, and circumstances 
of particular national policies. 
World Powers 
World powers today can be grouped into three 
general classes. The great powers are the United 
States and the Soviet Union. The United King-
dom may still be considered a great power, too, 
although now less able to stand alone in the world. 
The regional powers, which wield considerable 
influence in particular parts of the world, include 
such countries as France, Argentina, Brazil, 
China, and India. In a third category are the 
client powers, such independent states as Uruguay, 
Costa Rica, Luxembourg, and Egypt. Even 
though their independence may be important to 
their citizens and even to mankind, their continued 
independence is at the sufferance of the larger 
powers, and their conduct is largely conditioned 
by external events. Under international law each 
sovereign state is equal, and American policies in 
considerable measure have aimed toward support 
of this doctrine; however, law cannot hide the fact 
that states are not equal in power and never will 
be. A country like India, with hundreds of mil-
lions of people, cannot be equated in all circum-
stances with a state like Liechtenstein, even 
though each is sovereign. This has been recog-
nized by the United Nations by its system of per-
manent seats in the Security Council, and the veto 
system, which is not wrong in itself, but only in 
its abuse. The tests of a great power, behind all 
the polite words and agreements are (1) to be 
able to threaten force, (2) to have the ability to 
pay the price in a showdown of force against force, 
(3) to have the capacity to wage active, autono-
mous war with its own resources. 
This realistic approach to power is not meant to 
show cynicism for the efforts which certain coun-
tries, including our own, have made to achieve a 
better world for all on the basis of soverign 
equality; far from it. It is merely intended as an 
examination of the basic forces of existence and 
survival that lie behind our best efforts.

OF WORLD POWER wENTIAL 
Nationalism 
The armed forces of any nation, if they are to 
carry out their assigned missions, must have a 
sense of nationalism, to know why they are fight-
ing for their country. Extreme nationalism may 
be unworthy in a world that considers itself civil-
ized, when the brotherhood of man, in the best 
Christian sense, is a worthy goal. But national-
ism of itself is not bad. It may be the only means 
of attaining worthwhile goals. We love our rich 
and beautiful America; we want to raise our fam-
ilies in peace and happiness; we believe in the 
American heritage of freedom and individual 
dignity. The willingness of military men to 
sacrifice their lives for such goals is, in effect, an 
expression of nationalism. 
Nationalism has its basis in the demand of par-
ticular groups for complete sovereignty. Inter-
nationalism on the other hand admits the sur-
render of some aspects of sovereignty to a broader 
control. Each has its proper place, and the 
United States for valid reasons orients its policies 
both ways. No nation is willing to surrender all 
sovereignty until there are guarantees that what 
is held most sacred will not be harmed. But in 
countless fields, from the assignment of radio fre-
quencies to the control of drugs, we willingly sub-
ordinate our complete control in the interests of 
world order. 
Nationalism, in many ways an intangible force, 
grows out of race, religion, language, or historical 
and geographical circumstances. Small countries, 
lacking real power, sometimes substitute an exag-
gerated feeling of nationalism. In some ways 
nationalism, as we know it today, is a relatively 
new development. In both ancient and medieval 
times, loyalty was shared between local people and 
local rulers, as a matter of mutual protection in 
the unsettled times in which they lived. In the 
Western world, a broader spiritual and cultural 
community was effected through the Christian 
church in its struggle for survival and growth. 
The development of a money economy, the end of 
serfdom, and the Renaissance brought larger states 
and a gradual transfer of loyalties to the symbol 
of the monarch and the state. An expanding 
interest in philosophy and many other multiple 
forces combined to help the concepts of democracy 
and self-determination emerge. A new liberal 
173 
nationalism gave the chief loyalty to the state, and 
the ruler became at most a symbol. But some-
times the forces of nationalism, instead of leading 
to liberalism which recognizes the rights of minor-
ities, leads to totalitarianism and more strongly 
authoritarian states. Democracy, as we know it, 
is a very fragile thing, even though it has a con-
siderable will to live among those who understand 
it. Nationalism and individualism, therefore, are 
frequently in conflict, but nationalism per se is 
not to blame, but rather the use that is made of it, 
for nationalism may be the champion of freedom. 
The United States, therefore, needs nationalism, 
internationalism, and individualism; all three are 
inherent in its traditional political and social 
heritage. 
Some countries, including our own, also face the 
problem of national minorities. The major group, 
united by race, religion, or language, may not be 
the sole occupants of a political state. National 
minorities, people bonded together in varying de-
gree by different forces, may be no problem at all, 
or they may constitute a threat to the solidarity 
and power of the dominant group. In the United 
States, for example, there are a great many sec-
tional differences, social and political, -which 
appear more serious to foreign observers and 
critics, than they really are. India, for example, 
has religious minorities that continue to hamper 
complete national solidarity. 
Balance of Power 
So the world is organized into multitudinous 
groups, sometimes working together, sometimes at 
cross purposes, gathered politically into larger 
units known as sovereign states or dependencies. 
These units in turn settle their differences by war?
military, economic, and psychological, or by sub-
stitute devices which will be examined in the pages 
ahead. One means of avoiding war, or of jockey-
ing for position to be at the best advantage, is 
through power politics, as already mentioned. 
Another means is through balance of power ma-
neuvers, by which nations may achieve an equaliz-
ing of forces to avoid or postpone war. This 
equalization may be achieved without destroying 
the individuality of the separate states. However, 
balance of power entails many devices and, in some 
degree, each affects the policies of all states. One

device is the familiar "divide and rule ;" another 
is to prevent unions of competitive states. It is 
often stated that British policy in the past has 
been to seek a balance of power in Europe with 
Britain as the strategic key to the balance. When 
Napoleon was rampant in Europe, Britain was 
allied with other states against France. When the 
Kaiser and Hitler threatened, Britain was arrayed 
with the French and others opposed to German 
expansionism. In connection with the balance of 
power approach, it must be remembered that situa-
tions constantly arise requiring vigorous remedial 
steps which may or may not be successful. 
The National Interest 
What constitutes the "national interest" by 
which states always claim to be guided? Perhaps 
its origin was in the personal interest of the ruler, 
and with the change to nationalism, the idea of 
national honor developed. Some wars have been 
fought for reasons of national honor. Honor alone 
may be too idealistic or Quixotic for some; the 
jailing of a citizen for the pulling down of a flag 
may not be considered excuse enough to plunge 
nations into war with great cost in lives and 
resources. National interest, however, if accu-
rately assessed, is a realistic, practical considera-
tion of events from the viewpoint of national 
welfare, both present and future. American na-
tional policies in earlier years were largely inter-
nally oriented, due to the farm interests in domes-
tic land expansion. Industrial growth had its 
political and national consequences when a new 
interest in raw materials and markets dictated 
naval expansion. Tremendous responsibility for 
interpreting the national interest?economic, mili-
tary, and "war of life"?rests with the President, 
as well as the Congress. For example, U. S. par-
ticipation in the Korean War was interpreted as 
essential for reasons of national interest. 
It is because events in far away places like 
Korea and Iran and Germany are cumulative in 
their effects toward a buildup of destructive force 
that they cannot be ignored. America's national 
interest is and must be the determining factor in 
American reaction to any world events. 
National Character 
This discussion raises a related question, that of 
"national character." Is there such a thing? 
CONFIDENTIAL 
174 
America has attempted major reforms in Germany 
and Japan through political, economic, military, 
and educational changes. Will these changes be 
permanent? The answer is not simple. It may 
be that class characteristics are more valid in defi-
nition than net characteristics, and particu-
lar groups or classes may dominate policies and 
national viewpoint. Militarism, or communism, 
or idealism may dominate in different situations. 
Cultural patterns do affect the definition of "na-
tional character." It was suggested earlier that 
national character may be susceptible to analysis, 
but it is important to remember that it is com-
plex and not wholly predictable. 
Sovereignty 
Sovereignty has been referred to earlier as a 
characteristic of states. It grew out of a combi-
nation of two doctrines, that of the divine right 
of kings, and that of the free will. Combined 
and transferred to the state, it has been the out-
come of the necessity for an unchallengeable and 
supreme power to make and enforce the rules that 
bind society together. Such centralized power is 
the essence of government. Further, there can be 
no international law with real meaning unless 
there is sovereignty to consent to it. Perhaps the 
corollary doctrine is that one sovereign state 
should not interfere with another, though this is 
more difficult of accomplishment. Sovereignty 
does imply an equality among states, but only le-
gally speaking, since this is a practical impossi-
bility. A state can voluntarily accept restraints 
on its affairs without destroying sovereignty. 
Though states are legally equal, they may not have 
equal rights in all respects, and their independence 
of action may be more ephemeral than real. With 
the passage of time some states have lost their 
sovereignty and ceased to exist. This happens 
when, voluntarily or involuntarily, the final au-
thority over their actions passes to another state. 
International Law 
International law is subject to considerable 
abuse and even more misunderstanding, yet it 
holds together the fabric of international society. 
Its elements of administration, enforcement, and 
adjudication have come from many sources. Do-
mestic legal concepts throughout the world are 
not uniform enough for international law to be

FIDENTIAL 
complete. Some law is based on common law, on 
precedents; other law is administrative and ad 
hoc, with judicial decisions playing a smaller role. 
International law comprises both kinds, drawing 
on evidence in the form of direct treaties, confer-
ence agreements, treaties of third parties, deci-
sions of international and national courts, state 
papers, opinions of unofficial bodies and individual 
scholars, and even upon the "general principles of 
justice." 
Some of the earliest recognized international 
law relates to the sea, which is one reason why the 
Navy has always been so interested in this field. 
The commerce of the Hanseatic League led to the 
foundation of international rules of conduct, and 
Grotius is credited as the father of formal study of 
international law. At an early period inter-
national law also dealt with the rules of war. It 
deals with conduct both on public and private 
levels, and also becomes a part of the domestic law 
of most states. Its limitations are that it is appli-
cable only in certain situations, that it is some-
what uncertain and slow to develop, and that it 
cannot be legislated or executed in the ordinary 
sense. But it is developing and should grow in-
creasingly important. Now criminal law is being 
added to international law, and the theory of non-
intervention is undergoing change, while the 
rights of neutrals are being reduced. There is 
general condemnation of genocide, and support of 
a bill of rights for individuals. Even if these 
rights are not yet universally accepted, they are on 
their way to inclusion in the law. Genocide in-
cludes not only actual killing of ethnic groups, but 
also sterilization, breakup of families, or submer-
sion of culture. The international bill of rights 
includes the concept of due process of law, denies 
involuntary servitude except in wars or emergen-
cies, and allows no arbitrary restrictions on free-
dom of movement, public trial, religion and press, 
assembly, and similar elements familiar to Anglo-
Saxon jurisprudence. 
International law holds that jurisdiction over 
particular cases may hinge upon the territorial 
principle ( where the act occurred) , the nationality 
principle (that of the guilty party) , the protection 
principle (through national interest) , the princi-
ple of universality (as concerning pirates) , or the 
passive principle (that of the injured party). 
175 
The principle of territorial jurisdiction is most 
firmly established. Where individual parties sub-
ject to one jurisdiction are required to appear be-
fore another jurisdiction, their possible extradition 
is a matter of treaty. 
Recognition of one state by another under inter-
national law may be either de facto or de jure. De 
facto means that although no formal treaty is 
signed and representatives are not exchanged, for 
all practical purposes the one state admits to the 
sovereignty and authority of the other over a par-
ticular territory and people. This may have its 
naval application, when our government does not 
choose to recognize a foreign government. Naval 
commanders must be very careful that they take 
no action that could be interpreted as de facto 
recognition. De jure recognition, of course, is 
that granted by formal treaty and exchange of 
envoys. 
The Laws of War 
One of the chief concerns of international law is 
war, for in its modern form war invades every 
aspect of life. Early writers could not agree on a 
definition of war. It obviously refers to the use 
of force between states, but not all such cases con-
stitute war. War, from the point of view of in-
ternational law, is not per se bad, for the law deals 
only with its conduct, how it was begun, the be-
havior of neutrals and belligerents, and its ending. 
The legal recognition of a state of war affects mat-
ters of contraband, blockade, and censorship. 
Domestically it affects contracts and government 
controls. Such questions arise as to whether a 
state of war can only be declared by Congress, or 
whether a Presidential declaration of an "emer-
gency" which requires action by armed forces is 
legally war. Under international law, the formal 
declaration is not necessary. Only one of the par-
ties needs to intend war. However, police actions 
and armed intervention are not necessarily war. 
There is the presumption of intent to make war by 
certain overt acts, especially if so regarded by the 
victim, but even now there is no sharp definition. 
The question of defensive versus aggressive war 
also arises. These are equally difficult of defini-
tion; it is not so simple as who fired the first shot, 
for some self-defensive acts and proper exercise 
of sanctions would then be ruled out. In practice,

regretfully it must be said, the winner was the 
"defender," the loser the "aggressor." In sum-
mary, then, war, as such, is not illegal; it is the 
prerogative of the state. 
Causes of War 
Much has been written about the causes of war, 
and such studies should be of concern to the in-
telligence officer, because he has a continuing in-
terest in studying cause and effect patterns, par-
ticularly in the field of war. However, the causes 
of war are not easy to find, although many have 
been suggested. An "instinct of pugnacity" in 
man, hate, military general staffs, munitions mak-
ers, and many others that do not stand the tests 
of universality, have been suggested. War usu-
ally is not an end in itself, but serves as a final 
means of settling disputes, preserving rights, and 
remedying wrongs. Granted that it is a profligate 
means, increasingly so as it threatens the survival 
of the race, mere recognition of this fact does not 
solve the problem. Wars will continue to occur 
until a substitute is found, and other means to en-
sure security, defense, and justice must be pro-
vided before weapons will be surrendered. Dis-
armament, limitation of weapons, education, 
treaties outlawing war all have great merit, but 
they do not solve the basic problems of war, which 
are most complex. 
Psychologically, war springs out of fear, sus-
picion, greed, lust for power, hate, revenge, jeal-
ousy, and envy. When great tension has been 
built up, war represents a release from pressure. 
There are also economic causes: aggressive im-
perialism, both territorial and economic, and com-
petition for markets, energy sources, or essential 
raw materials. Wars may start from government 
protection of private interests abroad, without par-
ticular reference to the general welfare. On the 
other hand, failure to protect citizens and prop-
erty abroad with decisive action may also lead to 
war. Disregard for the rights of "backward peo-
ple" and population pressure, at least in its indi-
rect effects, are additional causes. Political 
causes include balance of power maneuvers, secret 
treaties, violations of unjust treaties, disregard for 
minority rights, deliberate organization for war, 
and even ineptness in government. There are 
many others: exaggerated nationalism, competi-
CONFIDENTIAL 
176 
tive armaments, religious and racial differences, 
general ignorance, and even war psychology, in-
duced by press, radio, motion pictures, text books, 
family influences, social inequalities, social sanc-
tions, and a lack of spiritual ideals. 
If all the above causes could be removed, would 
war then disappear? The possibilities are poor 
according to some theorists who believe that war 
is cyclical, that it is related to survival of the 
fittest, that heredity and environment cause it, 
that it is a culture trait, an instinct, an institution, 
and part of the stepladder of evolution. These 
theories are far from encouraging. Accordingly, 
preventive devices, such as a world state, have 
been suggested. Critics of this plan, however, 
have pointed out that super-sovereignty might 
largely result in a shift from international wars 
to "domestic rivalry" just as difficult of solution. 
It is obvious that great difficulties are involved in 
determining the causes for war and that there is 
as yet no general agreement as to either causes or 
effective solutions. Until such a time, the grim 
realities of modern total war must be faced. 
Prevention of War 
The prevention of war is a major task of the 
larger nations of the world, although it should 
be stressed that prevention is by no means their 
only task nor does the word imply a philosophy 
of "peace at any price." Since the prevention of 
war is aided by any limitation of warlike tenden-
cies, the means available to do so must be em-
ployed to the maximum degree. There are sev-
eral means. One is negotiation, the use of diplo-
macy and conferences. Actually hundreds of 
minor incidents are settled by diplomacy, and thus 
do not become causes for war. A third country 
frequently offers its "good offices" in a dispute, or 
even goes so far as to mediate the quarrel. Com-
missions of inquiry may be established to aid the 
settlement. Conciliation may move on to arbi-
tration, voluntary or compulsory, but even arbi-
tration does not necessarily force acceptance of 
decision. Such measures seem to work best on 
problems of private law and economic matters, 
rather than on strictly political matters. Concili-
ation is on the borderline between straight nego-
tiation and the compromise of arbitration. A

ELEMENTS OF WORLD POWER CONFIDENTIAL 
third general approach is through the use of judi-
cial means, but in the international sphere accept-
ance of a court decision is dependent on the will-
ingness of the parties. Major political issues, 
therefore, have seldom been solved in world courts. 
When diplomacy fails to solve problems of war, 
security measures may be of help. These take 
many forms. Disarmament and arms limitation 
have had United States support but with limited 
success, because few countries are willing to co-
operate whole-heartedly. Unilateral disarma-
ment coupled with neutrality laws has met with 
no more success. Ratios of limitation, or stand-
ards of allocation, are most difficult to establish. 
Security through education alone is illusory, for 
even if we are progressive and educate against 
war, will our enemies do the same? Passive re-
sistance has been proposed and even used, as by 
Gandhi's followers, but they were opposing the 
British who have a conscience and are responsive 
to public opinion. Aggressors generally do not 
have scruples, and then passivity only hastens 
slavery. The Kellogg-Briand pact made a novel 
approach to war: it outlawed "aggressive war," 
177 
but not "defensive war," and of course each sover-
eign state reserved to itself the decision as to the 
nature of the war it fought. The issues of iso-
lationism as an approach to peace have been de-
bated in the United States and elsewhere. Still 
another approach to peace is through collective 
security, which may mean alliances or even a world 
body and world police force. 
Peace between nations is a long-sought goal; 
the dimensions of the problems involved are best 
realized perhaps by those who first attempt to 
define war itself, isolate its causes, and find its 
cures. The purposes of this chapter have been 
much less ambitious, and limited to a considera-
tion of the basic elements of power and the general 
prerogatives and behavior of states in their power 
environment. However, since war is expressive 
of a particular power relationship between world 
states, a better understanding of the elements of 
world power should lead to a fuller appreciation 
of problems of war. Other power relationships 
between nations, such as those expressed in terms 
of foreign policies, are the general subject of the 
following chapter.

CHAPTER 7 
THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD 
While the preceding chapter on Elements of 
World Power dealt largely with concepts and 
principles, this chapter will review more specific 
developments in foreign policy, in international 
organization, and in economic relations that are 
of particular intelligence concern. All facets of 
the problems presented by the topics of this chap-
ter obviously cannot be discussed because of space 
limitations, but it is hoped that those mentioned 
will stimulate further thinking and study. It is 
also appropriate to suggest here that the solutions 
of problems arising out of relationships between 
states can seldom be considered in terms of ab-
solutes: good or bad, white or black. The com-
plexities of these relationships give rise to a va-
riety of alternative choices which often have rela-
tive values. It is for this reason that good in-
telligence must reflect shades of meaning in order 
that all potentialities may be fully recognized. 
AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY 
The creation of the foreign policy of the United 
States is the role of both the executive and legis-
lative branches of government. Indirectly, of 
course, it is affected by every kind of individual 
and group reaction. Its abstract nature makes it 
difficult of analysis, but it is the product of certain 
major fields of common concern. One is national 
security, which relates to our geographic loca-
tion, military strength, industrial power, and man-
power, as described earlier, and which is changing 
due to new forces at work in the world. A sec-
ond major concern is related to our economic situ-
ation, namely, the degree of industrialization we 
possess, our world trade interests, our raw ma-
terial needs, our problems of unemployment and 
price levels, the availability of funds for invest-
ment, and related phenomena. A third major con-
cern is peace, and all that it implies, for peace is 
a predominant desire of the American people. 
Formulation and Execution of Foreign Policy 
The constitution of the United States reserves 
matters of foreign policy to the Federal Govern-
ment, a concept which has been upheld in many 
court decisions. The Federal Government can 
negotiate treaties, legally "declare" war, receive 
foreign diplomats, appoint ambassadors, and regu-
late foreign commerce. States, of course, can 
make lesser arrangements with foreign countries, 
if Congress approves. The President, as head of 
the executive branch of the government, is chiefly 
responsible for foreign policy, for through the 
Secretary of State he handles official communica-
tions with other governments, decides upon their 
recognition, and determines states of belligerency 
and neutrality. The actual declaration of war is 
a congressional right, effected by the two houses 
meeting in joint session. Congress can strongly 
influence foreign policy through its legislative 
acts, such as the tariff, and the House of Repre-
sentatives has a special power through its initiation 
of appropriations. The President and the Senate 
share the right to make treaties and appoint en-
voys. Senate ratification of a treaty negotiated 
by the executive branch requires a two-thirds 
majority vote of those present. A device increas-
ingly popular is the "executive agreement in 
place of the treaty. Its ratification requires a 
simple majority of the members of both houses, 
which is often politically more expedient than the 
standard treaty. Congressional interest in for-
eign policy is illustrated by the large number of 
Congressmen traveling abroad to investigate a 
great variety of subjects and conditions. For-
eign policy usually cuts across political party lines, 
and the party platforms in recent years have not 
differed materially in this respect. In matters of 
foreign policy, while the American people re-
spond readily to moral and ethical principles, as 
mentioned previously, they, as any national group, 
react most rapidly to the needs of self-defense. 
A brief historical survey of the development and 
dominant features of American foreign policy will 
provide a useful background for the better under-
standing of its current operations in connection 
with other world governments.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Isolationism and Expansionism 
The exact meaning of George Washington's 
injunction against entangling foreign alliances 
has been long debated. It has been generally 
agreed, however, that his concern was in perma-
nent alliances with foreign nations, and that he 
did not mean to impose a ban on all close relations 
to meet temporary situations. If a recommended 
policy of isolationism is to be implied from his 
remarks, certainly at the time it was a suitable 
policy for a weak country far removed from the 
European scene and well occupied with an inland 
frontier. But even though in the past the United 
States has avoided close political contacts, its 
trade and economic relations have always been 
tied in with the rest of the world. While true 
that the Monroe Doctrine, for example, was iso-
lationist in one sense, in another it was interven-
tionist because it was unilaterally proclaimed by 
the United States in sympathy with the Spanish 
rebels in Latin America. Nor can it be forgotten 
also that this doctrine for many years relied for 
support on the strength of the British Royal Navy. 
Internal expansion across the North American 
continent was followed before the end of the nine-
teenth century by expansion into Alaska and over-
seas into the Caribbean and the far reaches of the 
Pacific. The reasons for expansion beyond the 
continental limits of the United States are many 
and certainly cannot be blamed on the economic 
lobbyists alone. For example, many sugar inter-
ests were actually opposed to intervention in Cuba 
and, in the Philippines, the United States might 
have withdrawn from there as readily as it did 
from Cuba had it not been for the postwar revolt. 
Our difficulties with Colombia over the Canal Zone 
were restricted to control over a narrow strip of 
land, coupled with handsome remuneration to the 
injured party, an unheard of act in that day. Our 
interests in Nicaragua, Haiti, Santo Domingo, and 
other nearby countries never led to actual coloniza-
tion, although a later approach to inter-American 
relations has been that of mutual consultation 
rather than unilateral action. 
The Open Door in China 
In China, United States policy was long that of 
the open door; self-interested, yes, but at the same 
time it may have saved China from being carved 
CONFIDENTIAL 
180 
up into colonies like most of the rest of Asia. 
America's interest in China dates back to the days 
when our clipper ships traded at Canton for tea 
and silks. In the middle of the nineteenth cen-
tury, China was forced to open additional treaty 
ports to foreign commerce, with concessions 
granted to a number of countries including our 
own. China had gradually lost many outlying 
territories and suzerainties. The French had 
taken Indo-China and dominated Yunnan, 
Kwangsi, and Kwantung together with the leased 
port of Kwangchowwan. Russia had taken the 
Amur Valley, had railway concessions in Man-
churia, and dominated Outer Mongolia. Ger-
many had Kiaochow and dominated Shangtung. 
The British held Hong Kong, Kowloon, and 
Weihaiwei, and controlled the Yangtze Valley. 
Earlier they had taken Burma, and had a degree 
of control over Tibet. Italy attempted to obtain 
Sanmen Bay in Chekiang, but was not successful. 
Japan, as is well known, persistently pressed for 
territory and privileges, acquiring the Ryukyus, 
Formosa, Korea, and later Manchuria. In 1899 
Secretary John Hay proclaimed our open door 
policy to put an end to further territorial seizures. 
We never really backed it with force until 1941, 
and since then the progress of events has swept 
away the opportunity for its application. It was 
a generally favorable factor in our relations with 
China for many years. 
The First World War and Its Aftermath 
First trying to be neutral, we finally entered 
World War I as a crusade for democracy, with 
the issue of freedom of the seas a major considera-
tion. After the war we found ourselves at odds 
with our allies and facing new and unfamiliar 
problems. Reparations, war debts, financial boom 
at home, then worldwide economic collapse were 
aftermaths of the war. Economic nationalism 
and autarchy, foreign aggression and dictatorships 
of right and left followed. The deterioration of 
world affairs in the 1930's brought us back to war 
again. 
The Second World War 
With much of the world in flames our neutrality 
acts were quickly shown to be no guarantee of 
peace. We transferred our ships to neutral flags 
to rush supplies to Europe. The sudden collapse

of western Europe under the German onslaught 
brought a vast rearmament program, and overage 
destroyers, preserved from the first war, were ex-
changed with Great Britain for bases. By the 
summer of 1941 the Navy was in effect at war to 
protect the western half of the Atlantic, despite 
the doubtful legal status of such protection. Our 
policy stiffened in the Far East as well, although 
we were woefully unprepared for major action. 
Many Americans had to revise their thinking dur-
ing that period, though the full shock of discover-
ing that we were arrayed against strong antago-
nists in a worldwide struggle was not felt until the 
attack on Pearl Harbor. 
Moves for Security 
Our international relations after 1940 under-
went successive policy changes as our leaders and 
people began to assess the meaning of events as 
they unfolded. Our primary concern was with 
our security. In the summer of 1941 off Argentia, 
Newfoundland, Churchill, and Roosevelt met to 
agree on common principles and war aims. We 
emphasized that we were not interested in terri-
torial gains, and recognized the right of people 
to choose their own form of government. We 
agreed upon a postwar cooperative order that 
called for free access to raw materials and mar-
kets, subject to existing commitments. We called 
for disarming aggressors, pending the arrange-
ment of a general security system. We cham-
pioned freedom of the seas, and expressed the 
famous four freedoms of the Atlantic Charter, 
freedom from want, freedom from fear, freedom 
of speech, and freedom of religion. 
Most of the successive important international 
conferences dealt largely with the prosecution of 
the war, but several important doctrines related 
to the present world order were enunciated and 
agreed upon during that period. At Casablanca, 
in 1943, Britain and the United States announced 
the "unconditional surrender" doctrine. 'Whether 
right or wrong, this stand may well have had a 
permanent effect on the war and its aftermath. 
Although Stalin was invited to attend the next 
meeting held in Quebec City, he failed to come. 
China participated in the negotiations of Novem-
ber 1943 at Cairo where the Atlantic Charter was 
reaffirmed, and where it was agreed to strip Japan 
181 
of all territories outside the four main islands, 
with minor exceptions. The Teheran meeting 
later that month? was the first time Roosevelt, 
Churchill, and Stalin actually met in person. Be-
cause of Soviet neutrality in the Pacific, Chiang 
Kai-shek was not invited. The broad strategy of 
the war in Europe was planned, and the demand 
for a "second front" was renewed. The Russians, 
of course, had a second front on the European 
continent in 1939-40, but at that time they chose 
to be neutral. Antagonisms and differences of 
opinion were evident even in this first meeting. 
Churchill favored an attack into the Balkans 
through the Vardar Valley, while Roosevelt called 
for a frontal assault on Western Europe because 
of military and political considerations including 
recognition of Soviet interests in a second front in 
Europe. While this may represent an over-sim-
plification of the strategic views held, it suggests 
the nature of the differences that developed. 
Idealism 
Meetings nearly a year later at Dumbarton Oaks 
considered proposals for the postwar international 
peace machinery. Continuing differences over 
policy caused President Roosevelt to agree to a 
trip to Yalta to try to reach a better understand-
ing with the Soviets, for as allies they were in no 
sense as reciprocal of plans, men, and supplies as 
were our British partners. The Yalta conferences 
dealt with the treatment to be accorded Germany, 
and the difficult task of forming a workable 
United Nations Organization. Representation in 
the organization was the first problem. The 
United States modestly requested only one vote, 
but since the independent members of the British 
Commonwealth wanted one vote each, the Russians 
demanded seventeen, one for each constituent re-
public. The U. S. S. R. finally settled for three, 
technically taking one for the Ukraine, and 
another for Byelo-Russia, in addition to one for 
the U. S. S. R. There was agreement that in the 
present state of the world the major powers should 
retain a veto over substantive decisions of the Se-
curity Council. We thought also that we had won 
the promise of free elections and independent 
states in eastern Europe. This proved illusory, 
to say the least. In an effort to shorten the Pa-
cific war and thus save American lives, we reacted

favorably to a Soviet promise to declare war on 
Japan, and tentatively accepted Russian domina-
tion of the Kuriles, Southern Sakhalin, Dairen, 
and the Manchurian railways. The assessments 
of this meeting, with its secret agreements, remain 
highly controversial. 
In the spring of 1945 the meetings in San Fran-
cisco established the United Nations Organization. 
President Roosevelt died in April and Germany's 
final collapse came in May. At the time of the 
Potsdam meeting in August, of the original Big 
Three only Stalin was still in office, for Attlee 
had replaced Churchill. The Soviets were ready 
to enter the war against Japan, and did so soon 
after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Naga-
saki. A completely demoralized Japan facing in-
vasion of her home islands, surrendered in re-
sponse to the Potsdam Declaration. At Potsdam, 
general plans for the former German satellite 
states were formulated and the zones of military 
occupation for Germany and Austria were estab-
lished. A Council of Foreign Ministers to repre-
sent the Big Three, plus France and China, was 
created. 
Realism 
In reviewing the record of these wartime con-
ferences, it is interesting to note the shifts of 
position that occurred. Our first concern was that 
of security, for we were engaged in a struggle for 
survival, but as the end of the war came in sight, 
we entered a phase of idealism. With the benefit 
of hindsight it is now easy to see that the Soviets 
carefully adhered to the long-term policies which 
have placed them in opposition to ourselves. Any 
lingering doubts about the Soviet's real intentions 
were quickly dispelled in the months following the 
war. Countless efforts to show good will and to 
go more than halfway were met with no response 
from the Soviet delegates, who continued an atti-
tude of suspicion and distrust. The record shows 
that we wanted peace and were willing to make 
any reasonable concessions, but no agreement 
proved better than the Soviet intentions of living 
up to it. 
New problems arose to plague the foreign min-
isters and their deputies faster than the old ones 
could be solved or shelved. Satellite treaties, in-
terference with elections, atomic energy, the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
182 
Italian treaty, and control of the Danube were 
debated at great length. Only the strongest of 
protests through the United Nations brought 
about the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran, 
thus averting what might have developed into a 
Soviet military penetration of the Middle East. 
The Morgenthau Plan for Germany and repara-
tions on the scale demanded by the Soviets were 
finally abandoned. The position of the United 
States toward Germany gradually shifted when 
it was realized that Germany's deficits would even-
tually be paid by the American taxpayer, and that 
a prostrate Germany meant an impoverished Eu-
rope. Gradually the United States passed beyond 
the idealism stage and began to see the shape of 
the Soviet menace. 
Cold War 
Various aspects of the cold war further accen-
tuated this menace. In a major test of strength 
the Soviets imposed a land blockade of Berlin in 
1948. Controversial issues leading to this action 
included the quantity and kind of West Zone rep-
arations to the Soviet Union, the currency reform 
which started West Germany toward economic re-
covery, and the action taken to unify the Ameri-
can, British, and French zones of occupation. 
Another factor was the Soviet desire to eliminate 
a Western Island in East Germany. The Soviet 
blockade was met with counter blockade action by 
the western allies and an arduous though success-
ful airlift. Although the blockade was finally 
lifted, a few false moves on either side might have 
led to war. 
Steps taken by the United States to strengthen 
the economies of western European countries and 
later their military forces, as mentioned previ-
ously, were all part of the cold war which in-
creased in intensity with the outbreak of armed 
conflict in Korea in 1950. Trouble spots in Indo-
China, Malaya, Iran, and the Arab world only 
served to accentuate the dimensions of this smol-
dering menace. 
Relations With Latin America

must include developing relationships with the 
Latin American countries to the south. Pan-
American relations have improved greatly since

THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD CONFIDENTIAL 
the time of the enunciation of the Monroe Doc-
trine, the end of our territorial expansion, and 
our difficulties with Spain over Cuba. The for-
mation of the Pan American Union in 1890 led 
the way to better relations with the Latin-Ameri-
can republics, culminating in the well-publicised 
"good neighbor" policy in 1933. We eschewed 
unilateral intervention among all the American 
states. Our policies have now centered on pre-
serving the independence of republican govern-
ments, recognizing the equality of each country, 
maintaining their territorial integrity, and urging 
the observance of existing treaties and the peace-
ful settlement of disputes. Continental solidarity 
has been the goal, coupled with nonintervention 
in internal affairs, but with extensive cooperation 
in all other matters. The degree of success has 
been fairly high. Eventually, all the American 
republics entered World War II and a number 
shared in lend-lease, and made available antisub-
marine air bases as required for convoy protec-
tion. The treaty of Chapultepec, ratified at Rio 
de Janeiro in 1947, binds all states on a two-thirds 
vote to come to the aid of any member state that 
is attacked. One of our more persistent remain-
ing problems has been sporadic disagreement with 
ambitious and energetic Argentina. 
Far Eastern Relations 
United States foreign policy in China since 
World War II has been more controversial and 
the facts involved may be slow to emerge with any 
clarity. It is clear, however, that the former 
"open door" policy of equal access by any nation 
to China has been swept away during the course 
of the twentieth century by world events. Chi-
nese nationalism flared up as early as the Boxer 
rebellion when there were demands for the expul-
sion of foreigners. In 1911 came the revolution 
headed by Sun Yat-sen that destroyed the Manchu 
Empire. His Kuomintang party has favored ex-
pulsion of foreigners and political tutelage of the 
people until a proper, constitutional government 
can ultimately function. Sun Yat-sen's revolu-
tionary techniques were studied and adapted by 
Lenin, for in the early 1920's Soviet and Kuomin-
tang relations were quite close. After Chiang 
Kai-shek made his successful march north from 
Canton in 1927, he tossed out his Russian advisers 
183 
and broke relations with Communist Chinese 
forces which withdrew into the interior, finally 
making Yenan their headquarters for many years. 
General Mao Tse-tung was the leader of this dis-
sident group. In 1931 the Japanese made new 
advances into Manchuria, establishing a puppet 
state; in 1937 the war moved south of the Great 
Wall to extend Japanese control to all the major 
rail arteries and port cities of northern and cen-
tral China. During World War II the Chinese 
fought a desultory war against the Japanese, for 
all their normal supply routes and most of their 
industry were in Japanese hands. Nationalist 
and Communist forces were united in an uneasy 
truce against a common enemy. 
At the end of the war the United States helped 
to ferry large numbers of Nationalist divisions to 
the coastal cities, north China, and Manchuria, 
together with supplying considerable amounts of 
war surplus equipment. The Communists were 
equally determined to control these territories, and 
swept out of the back country to lay waste the 
railways of the area. With Japanese equipment, 
probably turned over by the Soviets, they proved a 
strong opponent to the Nationalists. General 
Marshall's mission failed to find a solution to this 
problem acceptable to the parties concerned. 
Truce violations, attrition, inflation, and armies 
changing sides brought disaster. Before it was 
over, all China was Communist, aside from 
Formosa and mainland guerrilla forces of mixed 
allegiance. 
FOREIGN POLICIES OF OTHER NATIONS 
It is not possible here to discuss the guiding 
foreign policies of all other nations, but a few ab-
breviated examples will at least illustrate the com-
plex and shifting nature of policy manifestations, 
usually in support of some fairly persistent basic 
national drives. 
France 
France was long the problem child of Europe. 
Arrayed against the Hapsburgs and the Holy 
Roman Empire, she aimed at territorial expansion 
and predominant continental power which re-
quired conquest and the sponsoring of "independ-
ent" German states. Louis XIV also looked to 
French-Spanish union, and control of the Low-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR 
lands, but was opposed by the British. Napoleon, 
in the name of the French revolution, though with 
somewhat modified objectives, did sweep much of 
Europe. But after his defeat, French policy in 
Europe largely abandoned expansionism in favor 
of secure frontiers. French expansionism was 
later to be active again overseas. It as only at 
the turn of the nineteenth century, some years 
after Germany had united into a strong nation, 
that 400 years of British-French rivalry in Europe 
came to an end, and certain colonial difficulties 
were settled by giving Britain dominance over 
Egypt and France control in Morocco. Follow-
ing the second invasion of their homeland by the 
Germans in World War I, security became almost 
an obsession for the French. They favored a 
breakup of Germany, the demilitarization of the 
Rhine, and defense in depth. The withdrawal of 
the United States from European affairs may have 
been a factor in the French sponsoring of the 
"cordon sanitaire," consisting of alliances of the 
States bordering Germany to prevent any resur-
gence of military power. Italy, following World 
War I, felt that not all wartime promises had 
been kept and withdrew from her former allies. 
The French occupation of the Rhineland in 1923 
was- an attempt in part to force Britain into a 
position of greater support, but the British were 
not too amenable, and gave some support instead 
to the Germans. Government changes in France 
and Germany brought closer cooperation between 
the two countries temporarily, and the French 
withdrew from the Rhineland. 
Growing German nationalism was clearly re-
vealed by the 1936 remilitarization of the Rhine-
land in violation of the Versailles treaty, which 
collapsed much of the French defense plan. This 
change made it difficult for France to offer any real 
military support to Eastern and Central Europe 
in the event of German aggressions. While France 
worked harder to build up the Maginot defense 
tine, she left her frontiers with Belgium and 
Luxemburg unprotected. French and Italian re-
lationships were very confused: rivalry was strong 
in places like Tunisia, yet a partial understand-
ing gave Italy a free hand in Ethiopia. War 
came to Spain. It was a proving ground for Com-
munist and Fascist armies, with a few misguided 
liberals on the fringes, and the common people

were the victims. The Polish corridor question 
was boiling. Buying time, or doing wishful 
thinking, Britain and France, though rearming, 
watched Austria, Czechoslovakia and Memel go 
to Germany. The Low Countries still thought in 
terms of neutrality. The sudden shock of the 
German-Soviet agreement of 1939 was the last step 
before the partition of Poland and the beginning 
of World War II. France, still feeling the heavy 
cost of the first war, subjected to the divided pol-
icies of unstable governments and the weakening 
influence of the Front Populaire, was ill-equipped 
for war. What had been the greatest army in 
Europe fell before the Germans, destroyed partly 
by the politicians behind its back, partly by poor 
strategy, partly by fatalistic apathy. 
United Kingdom 
British policies are famous for their thorough 
relation to long-range British needs. Well-suited 
to an island people close offshore from a ferment-
ing Europe, they are naturally keyed to British 
self-interest and have opposed entanglements on 
the mainland. The British have aimed at a bal-
ance of power on the continent, to prevent its 
domination by any one group which could then 
threaten British security. For the last four cen-
turies the British have had no European terri-
torial ambitions, although they have been active 
overseas. They have taken what steps were neces-
sary to protect their islands, to keep world trade 
routes free, and to assure the security of their 
overseas holdings. These aims have naturally 
enough made seapower a prime weapon. The 
British usually make short-term alliances in Eu-
rope as required, though they have long continued 
close relations with Portugal, a remnant of earlier 
needs to counter Spain. Whenever the Rhine es-
tuary and the Scheldt River are threatened, the 
British always fight. They have long felt Russian 
rivalry overseas, since the Russians have long 
sought access to the Indian Ocean and the Medi-
terranean, both intimately related to Britain's im-
perial lifeline. 
Postwar concentration of power in the hands of 
the Soviet Union and the United States has re-
quired some British adjustments. As a result, 
Great Britain has associated closely with the 
United States in such common undertakings as the

United Nations and NATO. In areas such as the 
Middle East and the Far East, however, British 
and American interests have not always been co-
ordinated. In Europe the British have been con-
sistent with their basic policies in delaying on the 
Schuman steel plan. 
The purpose of this quick review of various for-
eign policies has been to emphasize that in the 
world, as it actually is, any nation that is to sur-
vive as a great power is motivated by self-interest 
and will do whatever is necessary for survival. 
Aware of these facts, the intelligence officer is 
better able to understand and interpret the foreign 
policies of nations. 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION 
From the philosophical and even the practical 
outlook, men have long recognized the existence of 
a world community. The western world, for ex-
ample, is joined in common spiritual values. 
Transport improvements and trade needs have 
also made materialistic interdependence very 
great, which in itself has demanded a degree of 
world organization. We have progressed from bi-
lateral treaties to the partial recognition of in-
ternational law, and increasing reliance is being 
placed on multilateral agreements and the creation 
of permanent international bodies with many 
powers. The achievements of international co-
operation have been many. Examples are the In-
ternational Red Cross, control of telecommunica-
tions, control of rivers for international use, 
standard weights and measures, weather report-
ing, hydrographic services, copyright rules, health 
regulations, and controls over slavery and nar-
cotics. The failure has been at the political level 
and as a result, when states go to war, many of 
these cooperative and successful economic or tech-
nical arrangements are jeopardized. 
The League of Nations 
There were many early attempts at multilateral 
international settlements, typified by the Congress 
of Vienna in 1815. At the end of the 19th century 
and in the years prior to World War I, the Hague 
Conferences attempted to set up an international 
order, but the first comprehensive attempt, spon-
269196-54----13 
185 
sored by President Wilson, was the creation of the 
League of Nations in conjunction with the Ver-
sailles Treaty. 
The League was effective in the economic and 
social fields. It failed on the key question of secu-
rity and power because of an unwillingness of its 
members to make it really work, to implement in 
full what it could do. The League could impose 
sanctions on aggressors, but being a pioneer effort, 
it was not designed to have unlimited power. Al-
though the Covenant established the League, the 
interpretation of responsibilities rested with the 
individual states. It was largely a body of war 
victors, their friends, and their self-governing 
former colonies. Later other powers joined, with 
the exception of the United States which alone of 
the major powers remained aloof. America's un-
willingness to participate directly in the League 
was based in part on its unfortunate experience in 
power politics and unpaid war debts. We did, 
however, remain interested in the League during 
the years it functioned, and always had an observer 
present at its meetings, occasionally considering 
the idea of entering, with reservations, to protect 
our position. When it finally suited their con-
venience, Germany, Italy, and Japan withdrew 
from the League to pursue their courses of con-
quest. The Soviets were expelled for their attack 
on Finland. 
The League was paralled by the World Court 
whose judges were able to settle many disputes in 
those cases where countries voluntarily submitted 
to its jurisdiction. The League was also closely 
allied to such bodies as the International Labor 
Organization, which in their specific field of con-
cern, were able to do good work. The importance 
and success of all of these supplementary activities 
were dwarfed, if not lost to the public eye, by the 
magnitude and seriousness of world security prob-
lems which the League failed to solve thereby 
dooming itself by inaction. Italy bombed Corfu 
in 1925, and the League failed to act decisively. 
The Lytton Commission did study the war in 
Manchuria in 1932, but had no way to enforce its 
recommendations. The Paraguay-Bolivia Gran 
Chaco War was not settled by the League. In the 
Ethiopian War sanctions were ordered against 
Italy, but not all members carried them out.

The United Nations Organization 
Some of the same basic elements which made up 
the League are to be found in the United Nations 
organization. It has a General Assembly of all 
member states, a Security Council with the big 
powers and regionally representative members, a 
Secretariat, an International Court of Justice, 
ECOSOC (the Economic and Social Council), 
and finally the Trusteeship Council. 
The ECOSOC is made up of a large group of 
activities including: ILO (International Labor 
Organization), FAO (Food and Agricultural Or-
ganization), UNESCO (United Nations Educa-
tional, Scientific, and Cultural Organization), 
ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organiza-
tion), the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development, the International Monetary 
Fund, WHO (World Health Organization), IRO 
(International Refugee Organization), ITO (In-
ternational Trade Organization) , UPU (Univer-
sal Postal Union) , ITU (International Telecom-
munications Union), WMO (World Meteorologi-
cal Organization) , and IMCO (Intergovernmental 
Maritime Consultative Organization). ECOSOC 
concerns itself with matters of economics and em-
ployment, transportation and communications. 
statistics, fiscal affairs, population, social prob-
lems, human rights, the status of women, and 
narcotic drugs. It has as suborganizations the 
Economic Council for Europe, the Economic 
Council for Latin America, and the Economic 
Council for Asia and the Far East. ECOSOC 
by its very nature does some of the less spectacular 
and more successful work of the UN. Officially 
it has 18 members, appointed to 3-year terms, but 
it operates with many ad hoc committees and 
nongovernmental organizations. It has no ex-
clusive jurisdiction, no permanent members, no 
veto problem, no coercive power; it is largely 
fact-finding and coordinating. Those recommen-
dations bordering on domestic matters require do-
mestic enactment to become effective. In a prac-
tical sense, it is at work on the causes of war 'aside 
from those which are political or military. Ac-
tually the ECOSOC fights communist objectives; 
while the communists are trying to destroy eco-
nomic order to hasten world revolution, ECOSOC 
is attempting to restore order. Despite this, the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Approved For Release 20 
Soviet Union has joined several of the ECOSOC 
activities when it has been advantageous to do so. 
The General Assembly represents all member 
nations, each with one vote, though any size of 
delegation may be sent. This body discusses any 
matter it chooses and may pass recommendations 
to the Security Council. A two-thirds vote of 
the General Assembly, plus the approval of the 
big five in the Security Council, can amend the 
charter of the organization. 
The Security Council has 11 members, includ-
ing the United States, the United Kingdom, the 
Soviet Union, China and France (all with the 
veto power) and 6 other members for 2-year 
terms "elected" by the General Assembly on a 
regional basis. For example, a typical distribu-
tion is 1 British Commonwealth member, 2 Latin 
American members including 1 from the ABC 
powers (Argentina, Brazil, Chile), and one mem-
ber each from a Soviet satellite, a West European 
state, and an Arab League state. The Security 
Council deals with major political disputes and 
can impose sanctions. It has a military staff to 
aid in this duty. It also has an armed forces 
committee and an atomic energy committee. 
The Secretariat, of course, provides administra-
tive and research services while the Trusteeship 
Council is responsible to the General Assembly 
for the mandates and trusts administered by mem-
bers. Some of these are former German colonies, 
others, the former Japanese holdings now under 
UN control. 
Regional Organizations 
The United Nations has attempted to avoid the 
failures of the League of Nations. Certainly it 
cannot be blamed for failure to end the cold war, 
because its success depends upon the honest in-
tentions of its more powerful members. Merely 
having the machinery for peace does not solve the 
problems of the world communist movement and 
Soviet ambitions; in fact, the UN organization 
was not originally designed to fight this kind of 
battle. For this reason many types of regional 
international organizations have been created with 
definite functions to perform. The development 
of some of these organizations, patterned after the 
relatively successful Pan American Union, was 
stimulated by such events as the fall of Czechoslo-

THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD CONFIDENTIAL 
vakia to "internal" forces. For example, Bel-
gium and Luxembourg have long had a customs 
union. With the addition of the Netherlands to 
this combination, and an extension of purposes, 
these countries established "Benelux," an economic 
union, sensibly designed to overcome some of the 
handicaps of small size. Such a merger is com-
plex, for it not only removes tariff walls, but re-
quires agreement on fiscal and monetary policies, 
the same regulation of prices and business, and a 
single legal code. Such changes do not come over-
night. Benelux attempts at economic unity were 
paralleled by the grouping of the Brussels Pow-
ers, namely, the Low Countries, Britain, and 
France, into a military alliance with increasing 
standardization of weapons and organization. In 
like manner the U. S. Marshall Plan on the eco-
nomic level was matched by NATO, wherein the 
United States joined with the Brussels Pact coun-
tries plus Canada, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, 
Iceland, Italy, Greece, and Turkey to form a mili-
tary alliance. This movement was given signifi-
cant support by the United States Military Aid 
Program and the assignment of General Eisen-
hower to the top command. The Schuman Plan, 
aimed at the integration of coal and steel industries 
in western Europe, has been a significant effort 
toward economic unification of the participating 
countries, notably France and Germany. 
Still another regional development has been the 
Council of Europe, not unlike a miniature Gen-
eral Assembly of the UN. It has only consulta-
tive powers, but conceivably could result in Euro-
pean federation. Although Winston Churchill 
was one of its early proponents, the British posi-
tion is affected by triple interests, European, 
British Commonwealth, and United States co-
operation. 
The growth of these various original organiza-
tions has been stimulated by the unwillingness of 
the Soviet Union to cooperate within the UN. 
Examples of this unwillingness are many. Prior 
to the outbreak of the Korean War the UN had 
tried for several years to solve the problem of 
this divided country, but the Soviets would not 
allow UN observers in North Korea. Even 
though the UN had demonstrated its ability to 
aid in the settlement of problems in such areas as 
Palestine and Indonesia, it could not even gain 
access to Czechoslovakia. Early attempts to 
create a permanent UN police force remained com-
pletely deadlocked. The United States offered 
to supply two divisions, ten to fifteen air groups, 
and two naval task groups; the United Kingdom 
was willing to commit half the Royal Air Force; 
all told, some two million men were offered. But 
the question of the veto power deadlocked fur-
ther discussion. The questions of disarmament 
and atomic energy met with similar difficulties, 
since both conventional and mass destruction 
weapons must be considered in any real disarma-
ment plan. 
The United States' position on atomic weapons 
was a generous offer to share its knowledge with 
the world, including world ownership of materials 
and facilities and complete inspection to prevent 
secret violation of rules. However, there could be 
no veto of swift punishment for all offenders. 
Even though such a plan is realistic if atomic con-
trols are to be workable, they strike at the heart 
of the Soviet system of secrecy and isolation. Ac-
cordingly, the Soviets, with a vast land power 
strength in conventional weapons, made the 
counterproposal that the United States destroy its 
atomic weapons, which constituted a vital source 
of military power, and that the veto power be 
retained by the five major powers. In the light 
of Soviet previous conduct such an arrangement 
did not seem to be consistent with survival. Of 
course, subsequent to the UN debates on the con-
t1-01 of atomic power, it was learned that the Soviet 
Union was making rapid atomic progress herself 
by combining espionage with the best scientific 
brains at her disposal. 
The issue of veto is one of the most crucial in 
the UN. The United States, like the Soviet 
Union, believes in the veto, but recognizes it must 
be used in moderation if the organization is to 
function at all. Actually, the charter of the UN 
does not discuss the veto. It calls for 7 of 11 votes 
affirmative to pass motions, except that motions 
which are substantive in nature, not just proce-
dural, require affirmative votes of the big 5 among 
the 7 or more votes. A state which is a member 
of the Security Council can be deprived of its 
vote when it is a party to a dispute, unless the issue 
involves a threat to the peace which is then called 
a "situation." Actually the veto power is abso-

lute, for the question of whether an issue is a 
"situation" or a "dispute" has been considered a 
substantive one, and no power will vote itself out 
of a veto on a crucial issue. By vetoing any at-
tempt to declare an issue to be procedural, a big 
nation never loses its decisive power. This is com-
monly referred to as the double veto. A state can 
veto a decision to make a question procedural, then 
veto it again as being a substantive matter. 
In exasperation many national leaders watching 
the record of mounting Soviet vetoes in the post-
war period have turned to regional plans, or have 
recommended expulsion of the Soviets, or have 
talked of a new UN designed to be a real world 
government. The UN obviously is not perfect, 
but many of its functions are very useful. 
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
As a basis for reviewing economic relations be-
tween world states it is well to remember, first, 
that states depend on various resources for their 
power, and second, that economic interdependence 
and political ambitions have brought them into 
continuous contact with each other. It has already 
been pointed out that the greatest progress in in-
ternational organization has been in the economic 
sphere. This is natural because economics, like 
intelligence, is largely a matter of hard-headed 
realism, and economic interdependence is fre-
quently dictated by compelling economic reasons. 
The United States and the Soviet Union continue 
to trade, even if on a reduced scale, because there 
are sound reasons for each to do so. In varying 
degree, trade is carried on indirectly even by bel-
ligerents in most wars. This is of itself neither 
good nor bad, and is hardly different from other 
measures dealing with the conduct of war, such 
as the Geneva Convention for the treatment of 
prisoners. However, from the viewpoint of the 
individual state, it is bad when individual citizens 
secretly trade with the enemy in contravention of 
national policy. 
Economic Systems 
Economic relations are, of course, directly af-
fected by some of the main forces at work in the 
economic world expressed in terms of economic 
systems. Perhaps the two extremes of these sys-
tems are "free enterprise," on the one hand, where 
CONFIDENTIAL 
economic decisions are made by individuals, and 
communism" on the other, where the state is the 
source of all decisions. There are other varia-
tions, of course, but these are the two major ex-
tremes of present-day concern. In between are 
state socialism, as practiced in Scandinavia, and 
systems which in general support free enterprise 
but impose certain controls. The British Labor 
Government, for example, attempted public owner-
ship of the basic industries, allowing "freedom" 
elsewhere. In general, the United States has kept 
private ownership, but has increasingly added cen-
tral controls. 
A brief summary of the historical development 
of this Anglo-American economic system is illus-
trative of the complex forces which shape such 
systems. The modern era of economics began 
when the rigidities of society inherent in a system 
of "status" gave way to business by "contract." 
The new money economies and trade were coupled 
with royal grants of monopolies of all possible va-
riety. The 18th century brought strong new phil-
osophies of individualism, and the beginnings of 
the industrial revolution. It was Adam Smith's 
Wealth, of Nation8 in 1776 that called for an eco-
nomic revolution that would match the political 
revolution in America. No simple pattern of 
orderly development followed, for many of the 
old restrictions were only partially removed, but 
in considerable degree free competition and au-
tomatic forces were the rule. The pressure of 
competition encouraged the exploitation of new 
inventions, and material progress was very real. 
The inefficient and obsolescent plants went bank-
rupt. New enterprises, or those able to adjust to 
changing conditions, reaped profits that were 
plowed back into new machinery and other capital 
equipment. The corporation, an artificial legal 
being, became dominant in many fields over the 
partnership or individual enterprise. 
Very early, however, the need for regulation of 
monopolies was recognized, not as a contradiction 
to free enterprise, but as a necessary policing step 
to maintain it. In the United States the Granger 
laws and the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 
were typical of these controls. The Sherman 
Antitrust Act was of broader applicability. In 
the years that have followed, the American system 
has become increasingly more hybrid, and govern-

ment has a voice in almost every phase of eco-
nomic life including labor laws, security regula-
tion, and agricultural supports. Increasingly, 
too, the power of government has been expanded 
by the emergency use of price controls and alloca-
tions, and taxing power and spending power have 
enormous indirect effect on the direction of eco-
nomic life. Social security and direct public in-
vestment in electric power and atomic energy rep-
resent further departures from abstract "free 
enterprise." 
Trade Relations 
The effect of economic systems on international 
relations is often to be found in the circumstances 
of trade between nations. Since current trade re-
lations reflect those of the past, a brief resume will 
be helpful to general understanding. 
The world of Adam Smith was dominated by 
mercantilist concepts. The preceding centuries 
had seen national states established and the switch 
from feudal barter to money economies. Spain 
had poured gold and silver from the New World 
into Europe, but for countries without a supply of 
gold and silver for their expanding economies, the 
only way it could be obtained was through priva-
teering ( a polite word for legalized piracy) or 
through the regulation of international trade to 
keep exports greater than imports in order that 
this difference could be received in bullion. This 
intense interest in the acquisition of gold and silver 
was a primary feature of mercantilism. There is 
not space here to expose all its economic fallacies, 
but any elementary text on the subject will make 
clear, as did Adam Smith, that real wealth lies in 
resources and labor, not in gold or silver, from 
the national point of view. It is no compliment 
to present-day thinking that most of the false 
concepts of the mercantilists are still with us in 
one form or another and still accepted by many 
people. 
The pressure of mercantilist theories had its 
effect in the struggle for colonies with supplies of 
precious metals, and in restrictive regulations to 
hamper freedom of shipping and of commerce, 
thus adding to the tensions and pressures that 
bring war. 
After Adam Smith, the following period of the 
classical economists was reflected in governmental 
189 
policies leading to a breakdown of many tariff 
barriers and trade restrictions. England in par-
ticular became the champion of free trade, though 
actually the greatest free-trade area in the world 
is the United States itself, where no real tariffs 
are in force among the 48 States. In no small 
sense, United States world leadership in economic 
progress can be attributed to its continent-wide 
free trade. 
Moderate tariffs during the 19th century were 
coupled with the use of the automatic gold stand-
ard for exchange. The gold content of the coinage 
of each country set the par of exchange, while free 
market fluctuations of the exchange rate were held 
to narrow limits by the ability of traders to ship 
gold to pay trade balances as an alternative to buy-
ing bills of exchange. A continued imbalance of 
imports against exports of a particular country, 
including "invisible" trade (such things as ship-
ping services and immigrant remittances), if not 
corrected rapidly by shipments of gold and ad-
justment of the price level, was caused by the 
processes of international investment. A coun-
try borrowing capital from abroad in effect re-
ceives that loan in goods, and this is reflected in a 
so-called "unfavorable" balance of trade; namely, 
more imports than exports. When the interest 
payments come due and when the principal is re-
paid, then exports exceed imports. The details of 
the mechanism are of no concern here, although it 
may be noted that the terms "favorable" and "un-
favorable" balance are in themselves rather mean-
ingless carry-overs from mercantilist days. 
World War I severely altered international 
economic relations. It had marked effects on the 
finances and money systems of the world, and new 
trade patterns developed. Impoverished by war, 
attacked by inflation at home, in heavy debt 
through reparations demands or borrowings, many 
countries sought to redress their position by ex-
change controls and tariff barriers. Many had 
abandoned the gold standard during the war 
period, and now were on paper standards. Post-
war unemployment was frequently countered by 
import restrictions and "buy at home" campaigns. 
Although intelligent people could see the ultimate 
damage to export sales of such restrictions, it was 
the easy course to take countermeasures and add 
more restrictions, even though the gains would be

temporary. Facing the political dangers of un-
employment, in some cases even revolutionary 
danger, it was easiest to sacrifice long-range stand-
ards of living in some degree in order to maintain 
employment through autarchy. This analysis, of 
course, is greatly oversimplified, but the facts of 
spiraling trade controls, quotas, and exchange 
manipulations are the important ones to remem-
ber. The dangers of war inherent in policies 
which deny some countries equal access to markets 
and resources have been expressly recognized by 
American leaders from the time of the Atlantic 
Charter. However, at subsequent similar meet-
ings, corrective action on an international scale has 
lagged behind recognition because of the many 
intricate problems involved. 
Attempts to free international trade have been 
vastly complicated by domestic economic controls 
in all parts of the world. State socialism is likely 
to lead to state buying in place of individual trade, 
as is the case in Britain's dealings with Argentina, 
and price supports at home mean drastic trade 
regulation, as is the case with agricultural imports 
in the United States. 
So-called normal trade patterns have also been 
strongly affected by world events since 1939. On 
a scale undreamed of before in world history the 
United States through lend-lease poured out a 
tremendous flow of munitions, foods, and indus-
trial materials to its allies, to save the world from 
German-Japanese fascism. As a practical meas-
ure it provided a means for arming the allies in a 
common cause and obviated many of the debt 
difficulties of World War I. It was based on the 
stated premise that free nations must stand to-
gether in the face of a great common danger. 
Trade Agreements 
The particulars of recent trade policy include 
names and doctrines with which the naval intelli-
gence officer should have at least a limited 
acquaintance. Although there are some multi-
lateral international trade agreements, especially 
on certain commodities, most trading arrange-
ments are bilateral in nature. The particular 
treaty devices adopted by the United States have 
led, however, to many multilateral effects. When 
CONFIDENTIAL 
190 
two countries sign a treaty of friendship and com-
merce, opening their ports to each other's ships, 
they frequently promise "national" treatment to 
each other's businessmen and citizens. This means 
they guarantee foreigners equal treatment before 
the courts, and usually the right to engage in busi-
ness on the same basis as nationals, though there 
may be a few exclusions. For example, we re-
serve coastwise shipping, domestic air service, and 
fishing in American coastal waters to our own 
nationals. 
Our treaties are also usually made on a bilateral 
"most-favored-nation" basis, which really means 
"equally favored." The net effect is that if new 
tariff concessions are extended by either party to 
a third country, the signatories agree to extend 
the same privilege to each other. There are minor 
exceptions, such as the British Commonwealth 
preference agreements, and special American con-
cessions to Cuba and, for a time, to the Philip-
pines. Furthermore, we usually extend "most-
favored-nation" treatment on an unconditional 
basis, which means that no new quid pro quo is 
required because agreement as to what constitutes 
equivalent concession is very hard to reach. Our 
aim is to minimize the restrictions on trade, al-
though some of the most ardent free-enterprise 
businessmen often favor high tariffs and small 
quotas. 
In 1934, the United States returned to a form 
of additional trade negotiation it had used in 
earlier years, the now well-known Reciprocal 
Trade Treaties. In exchange for additional con-
cessions on selected items that were most impor-
tant in trade with a particular country the United 
States, by executive agreement, lowered its im-
port tariffs (still on a "most-favored-nation" 
basis) even more. While these concessions are 
less subject to direct pressures by protectionist 
interests, the most elaborate safeguards are pro-
vided by means of public hearings to give full 
voice to affected American industries. We do not 
grant concessions on items we have in surplus 
We have special penalties on "dumping," and even 
we use the "quota," a weapon more powerful than 
the tariff. In addition, when changed conditions 
require new protection for an American industry, 
these agreements have escape clauses.

THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD utnInDENTIAL 
Multilateral Agreements 
Multilateral agreements in the control of trade 
are best exemplified by the activities of the Food 
and Agricultural Organization, which establishes 
international quotas and price controls on certain 
agricultural commodities. Further, the Interna-
tional Trade Organization of the United Nations 
establishes the fundamental machinery to collect 
trade data and takes corrective action to remove 
trade inequities that might lead to war. This or-
ganization, which the United States has cham-
pioned as a companion to the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund, is a beginning, but 
so far has demonstrated little concrete accom-
plishment, since the obstacles it must overcome are 
tremendous. Of course, so long as the world is 
fundamentally divided in objectives, most of these 
agreements can have only limited success. The 
present ITO agreements give lip service to free-
dom of trade and no discrimination, but are so 
hedged with escape clauses that their practical ef-
fect is very limited. The choice has been to have 
the machinery established, or to have nothing, 
since the policy of free trade has not as yet been 
made possible. 
The milieu in which our trade policy is applied 
is not entirely of our own making, but results from 
events in all parts of the world. When immedi-
ate post World War I restrictions had eased 
slightly, and several of the major powers returned 
to the gold standard in the late 1920's, the New 
York stock market collapsed and we stopped in-
vesting in Germany. Those investments had 
given Germany the apparent power to pay repara-
tions, and thus in turn enabled Britain and France 
to pay war debts. The collapse of the Kreditan-
stalt bank in Austria spread financial panic in 
Central Europe, and the flight of short-term capi-
tal began, eventually leading to a heavy gold in-
flow into the United States. This threatened. ex-
change stability abroad, and eventually forced 
most nations off the gold standard. In 1930 our 
passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, as an 
answer to mounting unemployment at home, was 
soon matched by British abandonment of their 
traditional free trade policies, which had already 
been weakened. "Buy British" and Empire pref-
erence became the rule. A special British trad-
ing arrangement was made with Argentina in 
191 
1933, the first of many, due to the close commercial 
relations between the two countries. The United 
States and Britain did not join in a reciprocal 
trade agreement until 1938. World War It 
brought virtual free trade between the two coun-
tries, for after the British exhausted most of their 
foreign investments paying for munitions during 
our "cash and carry neutrality" days, lend-lease 
and the postwar loans became major trade factors. 
Postwar Britain has been heavily engaged in state 
trading. 
The Soviets, since their seizure of power in 
1918, have used state trading exclusively, though 
during the temporary N. E. P. period they did 
grant some private licenses for trade. The Min-
istry of Foreign Trade controls all Soviet trade 
today, setting up foreign corporations abroad to 
do its buying. Special commodity trade combines 
under the Ministry set their quotas in accordance 
with an overall economic plan. In the United 
States, Antorg, a New York corporation, is the 
sole Soviet representative Amtorg's more sinis-
ter espionage activities have already been men-
tioned. 
Foreign Investment 
Many trade difficulties have been linked directly 
with problems of international investment or capi-
tal flows, both long-term and short-term, from one 
country to another. It should be pointed out that 
long term private investment takes two forms, di-
rect and portfolio. Direct investment is illus-
trated by the great activity of United States firms 
in establishing branch plants in the Western 
Hemisphere countries. Portfolio investment re-
fers to the purchase of securities in foreign con-
cerns without the direct responsibilities of con-
struction and management. The United States 
government has encouraged private investment 
abroad as a necessary measure to improve interna-
tional economic good health. One of the economic 
problems is that the heavy American export flow, 
which has materially aided many countries and 
also maintained high employment at home, must 
be paid for in one or more of several ways: (a) by 
taxpayers helping to pay the costs; (b) by govern-
ment or priVate citizens making investments 
abroad; (c) by an equal flow of imports. The 
fourth alternative, that of ending this export

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
trade, has not been seriously considered in the 
present world situation. Since imports either 
have not been available or have come in competi-
tion with domestic goods, they have not been of 
major assistance. According to various econo-
mists, the best answer is investment now, with two-
way trade as soon as possible. Our interest in 
private enterprise naturally favors private invest-
ment, even though the problem is political in many 
respects, because outward movements of capital 
cannot really be considered investments unless 
there is a strong possibility of later dividends and 
repayment. Private investors are more likely to be 
influenced by such factors, and to place their 
money soundly, since they have no reason to weigh 
political considerations. One great trouble has 
been that private investors have frequently lacked 
incentive for foreign investment. Political in-
stability and chaos, fluctuating exchanges, heavy 
taxes, and confiscation have all meant loss to previ-
ous investors. Consequently, the trickle of such 
private funds abroad since the world depression 
has been quite small, except in a few "safe" areas. 
Government loans have had to replace such private 
flows. 
War Debts 
Financial adjustments growing out of the two 
world wars, as has been indicated, have been dom-
inant forces in world economic relations. In the 
first war the United States loaned enormous sums 
which actually went abroad in the form of goods. 
There was not enough gold abroad to pay for them, 
yet we were unwilling to accept repayment in 
kind; namely, more goods. We felt that the con-
tractual obligation was separate and apart from 
the question of reparations receipts by our debtors. 
Consequently, there was extreme bitterness of both 
sides, and payments with minor exceptions were 
halted. 
Germany surrendered at the end of World War 
I on the condition that no punitive damages other 
than war losses, were to be collected. But the Al-
lied estimates of losses were astronomical. Of 
course, they were not completely paid, but in the 
process of trying, Germany experienced the com-
plete inflationary destruction of her money system, 
and the accompanying despair has been identified 
as a factor in the rise of Hitler. The policy after 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Approved For Release 20 
192 
World War II was quite different. The United 
States kept title to lend-lease goods. Perishables 
were written off as one of the costs of the war. 
Durables were either returned, or transferred after 
the war at the best figure we could negotiate. 
Some of these mark-downs were tremendous. Of 
course, the significance of the mark-down has 
meant little in most cases, since our policy has 
in considerable measure been one of underwriting 
the foreign exchange deficits of those countries 
important to our defense which followed prudent 
fiscal and monetary policies. 
Following World War II some war debt settle-
ments were made. In the case of a few countries, 
reverse lend-lease had been sufficiently great to 
cancel out direct lend-lease. Great Britain agreed 
to settle a lend-lease "debt" of $24 billion for $650 
million to be paid over a 52-year period at 2-percent 
interest. Also, in various countries some settle-
ment funds were made available under the Ful-
bright plan for the interchange of scholars, when 
such funds were otherwise blocked because of ex-
change difficulties. However, no agreements were 
ever reached with the Soviet Union which re-
ceived 500,000 vehicles, 14,000 planes, 7,000 tanks, 
2,000 locomotives, 11,000 freight cars, and 600,000 
tons of ships. 
Reparations 
The end of the war brought with it the problem 
of reparations. The Soviet Union had suggested 
that it should receiVe twenty billion dollars worth 
of German reparations, separate and apart from 
any "war booty," which was a flexible term that 
could well include any property in territories oc-
cupied by the Red Army. At the time, the United 
States was not demanding reparations but, under 
the influence of the Morgenthau Plan concept, was 
thinking in terms of converting Germany from 
an industrialized nation to an agricultural state 
which could never again threaten the world with 
serious aggression. There were many astute ob-
servers who had misgivings about such a plan 
because of its economic consequences, not only for 
Germany but for all of Europe. While we did 
recognize that Germany had no export surplus 
with which to pay reparations, we envisioned that 
the dismantling of German war and heavy indus-
tries could supply capital goods reparations re-

THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD ruENTIAL 
quired for the rebuilding of wrecked factories in 
a number of countries. 
By one way and another, several countries did 
collect some actual reparations. Poland was com-
pensated by receiving important German terri-
tories. The Soviet Union stripped much from 
the territories occupied by Russian troops, and 
appropriated German external assets in Eastern 
Europe even when they represented goods or se-
curities stolen by the Germans. At fictitious 
prices the Soviets also bought control of most 
industry within their zones. The United States 
picked up portfolio German assets in Switzerland 
and Latin America. Dismantled plants in West-
ern Germany were moved to Russia, partly as rep-
arations, partly to pay for food imports from 
Eastern Zone. 
Economic Recovery 
Within a short time, the United States finally 
recognized in official policy that German economic 
recovery was essential both to European economic 
recovery and to avert chaos and communism. 
However, this required such sizable money grants 
from the United States that any reparations passed 
to other countries became actually equivalent to 
grants in aid from the United States. Therefore, 
the first charge on German exports was considered 
payment for imports, which substantially ended 
any large shipments of goods to the East. Be-
cause of initial confusion, the three Western Zones 
ultimately set up unified economic controls, but 
some dismantling continued for a time, even after 
the official view had swung to the point where it 
was felt a halt should be called. The failure of 
the Soviets to receive all that they demanded be-
came an additional factor in East-West tension. 
In the case of Japan, the Potsdam Declaration 
set forth general conditions for postwar treat-
ment. War industries were to be destroyed, but 
a viable economy was to be left. External assets 
were taken over, and, for a period, considerable 
amounts of capital goods were shipped to the 
victims of Japanese aggression. The Soviet 
Union regarded its enormous prize of Manchuria, 
acquired in less an a week of war, as "booty," 
not a part of reparations. This was very costly to 
China, destroying for years to come any real hope 
of economic advance. In time the United States 
269196-54 14 193 
came to the position of making up Japanese trade 
deficits, first for relief purposes, then for economic 
recovery. This ended further reparations, and 
the Peace Treaty of 1952 fairly well closed the 
matter, despite the reservations held by the Philip-
pines, Indonesia, and a few others. 
In the interests of an economically and polit-
ically stable world, the United States felt obliged 
to extend economic aid not only to Germany and 
to Japan, but also to our allies, since they lacked 
the recuperative powers that we possessed. Their 
heavy purchases of food, industrial materials, and 
increasing amounts of capital goods in this coun-
try, caused the so-called "dollar shortage." 
Therefore, lend-lease military aid was followed 
first by UNRRA food and clothing, and then by a 
series of other measures. We sponsored the 
European Payments plan to try to restore multi-
lateral trade in Europe, and then the European 
Recovery Program, a combination of self-help, 
American technical guidance, and Marshall plan 
goods, with stress on permanent improvements 
of output rather than current consumables. The 
Economic Cooperation Agency was the American 
governmental body set up to administer these 
functions. 
The Marshall Plan and Military Aid 
The Marshall plan was an astute and states-
manlike offer to the world, although the Soviet 
Union condemned it as an effort on our part to 
achieve world economic domination. Because of 
the Soviet position, their satellites had to with-
draw acceptance of invitations to Paris to discuss 
the plan, and the further division of the world into 
East and West continued American aid and 
European response raised the physical indices of 
European production well above prewar levels, but 
still left Europe woefully weak militarily against 
the threat from the East. The Truman plan of 
containment with military aid for Greece and 
Turkey became necessary in order to save the 
West's strategic position in the Mediterranean. 
The Soviet answer to the Marshall plan was not 
only invective, but also the creation of the Molotov 
plan, which tied the satellites even closer to the 
U. S. S. R. The Cominform, the latest manifesta-
tion of the supposedly dead Comintern, was also 
brought into the open.

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Scarcely had the phenomenal and substantial 
economic recovery of a number of countries seemed 
to justify the Marshall plan and point toward its 
termination when new problems arose. The 
growth of the Soviet military menace to Western 
Europe, and indeed to the whole free world, indi-
cated a new and general need for accelerated re-
armament. However, military demands on the 
budget and material of the Marshall plan countries 
threatened to undo much of the progress that had 
been made. Vigorous measures by the countries 
concerned were hampered by both internal polit-
ical problems and public apathy toward defense. 
United States military aid was a response to the 
economic and political problems faced. Both 
Britain and France were experiencing particular 
economic difficulties because of additional burdens 
imposed by the wars in Malaya and Indo-China. 
In the opinion of many government leaders, the 
important economic fact of military aid was that 
the issue of arms shipments versus more economic 
aid was one of expediency, not of fundamentals. 
Economic aid, if reflected in arms manufacture in 
Europe, might be cheaper than arms shipments; 
but if the latter meant arms sooner, the higher 
cost might be justified. 
The Allies had recognized even before World 
War II ended that strong economic measures of 
international cooperation were needed to provide 
the basis for a working world community. The 
prewar arrangements for bringing stability to ex-
change rates were studied and strengthened at 
Bretton Woods in 1944. The International Mone-
tary Fund to stabilize exchanges (short-term capi-
tal movement) , and the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development to ease long-
term capital movement problems were created. 
However, these measures alone, important as they 
were, could not provide enough support to restore 
the world economy. That is why the European 
recovery plan and "Point Four," a world-wide 
plan for development of backward areas, came 
into being. The military aid program was harder

Without transport there would be neither in-
ternational relations of importance, nor modern 
war machines. Consequently, the intelligence of-
CONFIDENTIAL 
194 
ficer should know something of the workings of 
transport?the devices used, the control and man-
agement, and the regulation, both national and 
international. Some of the most complete inter-
national controls have developed in Europe, where 
modern technology with high speed and cheap 
movement contrasts most sharply with the small 
political units crowded into a compact geographic 
area. 
Modern economic life is closely linked with 
railways, the chief form of land transport 
throughout the world. They acquire significance 
because of their combination of a fixed right-of-
way and mechanical power, forming networks 
that allow the delivery of freight and passengers 
without transshipment and at low ton-mile costs 
anywhere in a, big territory. Such networks re-
quire a standardization of track gage, clearances, 
couplers, and brakes. We have developed a great 
North American net with a track gage of 4 feet 
81/2 inches, covering Canada, the United States, 
and Mexico. A second great network of the same 
gage covers most of Europe outside of the Soviet 
Union and Iberia, though there are many Euro-
pean local feeder lines of narrow gage. There 
are smaller networks in Manchuria-China, Argen-
tina, and India-Pakistan, though some of the 
latter systems are more handicapped by a variety 
of gages. The standard being developed in Africa 
is 3 feet 6 inches. Australia hopes to convert her 
state systems to the American-European stand-
ard. The Soviet standard on their extensive sys-
tem is 5 feet. Europe's railway controls include 
international agreements on technical standards, 
car interchange, rates, timetables, and accounts. 
Many of these arrangements go back to the last 
century. 
The commerce of international rivers and some 
connecting canals are also subject to joint regu-
lation. The Danube and the Rhine are outstand-
ing examples, although under German and then 
Soviet domination, international control of the 
Danube in particular is illusory. A more general-
ized type of treaty usually regulates the use of 
rivers flowing through or on the borders of more 
than one state in all parts of the world. 
Roads are more local in nature, although this 
characteristic is changing as long-distance truck-
ing develops abroad as it has in America. How ?

ever, there are agreements as to licensing, liability, 
and traffic signals. Roads still remain mostly 
feeders to railways in many foreign lands. 
Pipelines, except by bilateral treaty, have not 
figured as directly in international agreements, 
although a few, such as those from the Persian 
Gulf to the Mediterranean, are of very great politi-
cal and strategic concern. 
International regulation of ocean shipping has 
been somewhat different from that of land trans-
port, for international law has recognized the high 
seas as free to all users, with questions remaining 
only about the limits of territorial waters, use of 
oceanic canals and straits, and the rights of bellig-
erents and neutrals. Just as railways have been 
very important to economic advance, so too has 
cheap ocean transport been made reliable by large 
steel steam or diesel vessels. The role of the 
merchant marine and its problems should require 
no explanation for any naval officer. Only re-
cently has specific international regulation be-
come more extensive. Conferences on safety at 
sea and rules of the road are being supplemented 
by discussions of wage rates, subsidies, and work-
ing conditions. In the future, the regulations set 
by international agreement might increase. 
Regulations governing air transport among 
countries are very complex, an inevitable develop-
ment, since aircraft have such great military and 
political implications and, unlike ships, are not 
obliged to stop at the frontier of a country, but can 
fly to any place on the globe irrespective of bound-
aries. Early discussions of air law matured in 
1919 into the first detailed set of rules. Public and 
private air law were merged under a single body, 
195 
the International Civil Aviation Organization, 
after the Chicago meetings in 1944. Regulations 
govern the licensing, inspection, registration, and 
technical standards of aircraft, communications, 
statistics, routes, and rates are all controlled either 
through the ICAO, the International Air Trans-
port Association, or by bilateral agreements. 
Communications, too, bind together the whole 
world and consequently are internationally con-
trolled. These controls include not only the Uni-
versal Postal Union, but also the International 
Telecommunications Union, which assigns radio 
frequencies, establishes rules on telegraph and 
radio codes, and controls access to and use of these 
facilities. 
Within this chapter have been presented some 
of the major geographic, economic, and political 
forces that shape the environment of the world of 
which the United States is a part and in which the 
Navy must do its job?fields of concern which must 
inevitably affect the thinking and action of in-
telligence officers. Obviously this review is not a 
substitute for the years of background reading and 
study and the constant day by day interest in fol-
lowing current developments that are required for 
proper analytical assessment of events for in-
telligence purposes. The only aim has been to re-
fresh the thinking of the naval officer, to stimulate 
him to do further reading in areas beyond his ac-
quaintance, and thus to improve his intelligence 
perspective. The following chapter will outline 
the problem the United States and the free nations 
of the world face in the menace of communism and 
its chief exponent, Soviet Russia.

CHAPTER 8 
WORLD COMMUNISM AND THE U. S. S. R. 
The reality of the menace of communism as a 
militant political force is evidenced by the fact 
that Communist dictatorships now control one-
third of the population and almost one-quarter of 
the inhabited areas of the world. In many non-
Communist states, organized groups propound the 
doctrines of communism and exercise considerable 
political influence. But communism is not only a 
political force. Supported and directed by Soviet 
Russia, world communism has become the most 
extensive mass movement based on philosophical 
teachings since the advent of Christianity, and 
more disturbing, it is a tremendously powerful 
force subversive to the democratic way of life as 
enjoyed by the United States and other freedom-
loving peoples of the world. Thus it constitutes 
the greatest problem we face today. However, 
for the citizenry of the United States, and for the 
naval officer, this problem must not only be iden-
tified; it must also be understood if adequate so-
lutions are to be found. It is therefore appropri-
ate to review briefly the doctrines of communism, 
their historical development and utilization, and, 
finally, some of the elements of power of the So-
viet State which is the chief advocate of Com-
munist doctrine. 
THE BACKGROUND OF COMMUNISM 
Communism, in theory, is far from new. Ex-
pressions of it are found in Plato's writings and 
in literature even before his time. From time to 
time in various areas, efforts were made to put 
certain fragments of this theory into practice. 
Marxist "Scientific" Socialism, or modern com-
munism, as a social philosophy evolved out of 
conditions which existed in 19th century Europe 
and drew extensively upon the intellectual think-
ing of the 18th century philosophers. The Age 
of Reason in 18th century Europe brought an 
awakened interest in philosophy, economics, and 
politics, a questioning of old beliefs, and a search 
for new approaches to the problems caused by 
social and economic change. Although the indus-
197 
trial revolution eventually led to a higher standard 
of living, it also brought unusually harsh condi-
tions of labor for many people. The individual 
initiative and healthful environment of an agri-
cultural life and the simplicity of handicraft man-
ufacture were increasingly replaced by the regi-
mentation of the factory, the unhealthful 
conditions of the mine, and the complexity of 
highly organized industry. 
In trying to adjust to life in this new order, so-
cial philosophers of the period began to consider 
once again the age-old question of how the com-
mon man can improve his standard of living. At 
the same time, economic conditions were being 
analyzed and economic principles were being for-
mulated into a broad body of doctrine by the 
so-called classical economists. Some of their doc-
trines, with considerable elaboration, form the 
skeleton of modern economics, but many of their 
explanations of economic functions were based on 
very artificial or even false assumptions. Other 
writers not only tried to explain the world as it 
was, but sought solutions to some of the inequities 
of existence. Variant forms of cooperative life 
and socialism were suggested as replacements for 
the laissez-faire capitalism of the day. Some 
short-lived experiments in cooperative societies 
were made on a small scale, but most of these were 
abandoned when it was found that new problems 
replaced the ones they were trying to solve, or 
that all failings could not be attributed to capital-
ism alone. 
One of the intellectual theorists of this period, 
Karl Marx, was to exert an influence on Western 
civilization out of all proportion to the signifi-
cance of his teachings, which have been thoroughly 
discredited. Very much a product of his age, 
Marx conceived of himself as a prophet, a realist, 
a materialist, and a social scientist utilizing "scien-
tific" methods. This unique mixture of mis-
sionary fervor and spurious scientific theory was 
to be translated into action to an amazing degree 
by a small band of devoted followers.

INTELLIGENCE FOR 
THE THEORY OF COMMUNISM 
The Communists rely heavily on their body of 
theory. Since they regard Marxism as "scien-
tific," they derive from his theories both their 
long-range plans and day-to-day action, utilizing 
what they believe to be strictly logical deductive 
methods. Both Lenin and Stalin emphasized the 
importance of theory when they wrote, respec-
tively: "Without a revolutionary theory, there 
cannot be a revolutionary movement," and, "Only 
a party guided by an advanced theory can act as 
a vanguard in the fight." The Communists' pro-
grams of action are, in effect, applications of their 
theories. It is for this reason that an understand-
ing of the theory is essential. 
Communism presents an interpretation of man 
and his history, a reason for cause and effect, a 
guidepost for goals, and a justification for the 
means of attaining them. Its doctrines have been 
closely integrated to embrace all of man's activi-
ties: social, economic, political, and philosophical. 
For the confirmed Communist, they alone provide 
the satisfactory ? "scientific" ? explanation of 
man's being, the solution to his many puzzling 
and conflicting problems, and the opportunity for 
a realizable better life on earth. For the Com-
munist, the only alternatives are to accept his doc-
trines or to oppose them?a middle ground is 
impossible. 
Although rejecting all religions as "opiates" of 
the people, communism in the eyes of its adherents 
has become a substitute religion; even more, it has 
given them a sense of purpose, a symbol for per-
sonal dedication. While Communistic writings 
are voluminous and complex, they are all built 
upon a series of basic concepts which might be 
called the creed of communism. The first is the 
concept that all life is material in a state of con-
stant change; hence, there is no immortal soul and 
no God. The only moral code is that which serves 
the cause of communism. The second is the belief 
that all history is the result of the laws of economic 
determinism which were discovered by Marx; the 
basic conflict has always been and continues to be 
the struggle between social classes. The third 
concept is that capitalism is an instrument of op-
pression and the primary source of opposition 
which must be destroyed, together with the State 
which of necessity supports it. Destruction can

only be brought about by violent revolutionary 
methods because the ruling class will never relin-
quish its autocratic power voluntarily. There-
fore, such methods are essential and acceptable for 
the liberation of the oppressed classes by the van--
guard which is, of course, the Communist Party, 
considered in a collective sense. In the minds of 
the Communists it follows logically that true com-
munism can only be realized in the world when 
all opposition has been eliminated eveywhere. 
The Marxist Philosophy 
The theory of communism is built on the philo-
sophical teachings of Marx which have three pri-
mary features. The first is Dialectical Material-
ism which, simply stated, is a theory of reality, 
a philosophical explanation of the universe and 
man. While borrowing heavily from the thinking 
of the German philosopher Hegel, Marx substi-
tuted materialism for Hegel's idealism, and at-
tempted to demonstrate that the universe and man 
originated from material forces in a state of con-
stant motion. Therefore, to Marx, matter was 
all-important, mind was of secondary value, and 
consequently the soul, immortality, and God could 
not exist. He explained development as the re-
sult of the action of opposing forces. The first 
force was called the "thesis ;" the second force, the 
"antithesis;" and the result of their opposing ac-
tion, the "synthesis." The "synthesis" became a 
new "thesis" and the whole process repeated itself 
ad infinitum. The historical application of this 
theory of reality was most ingenious. For their 
"thesis," the Marxists took the point of view that 
primitive society was classless, with tribal owner-
ship of property. The "antithesis" was class so-
ciety, with capitalism as its most extreme form. 
The "synthesis," of course, was true communism 
which would combine all the advantages of man's 
progress with the idyllic simplicity of primitive 
society. 
In addition to his theories of reality and de-
velopment, Marx set forth three fundamental prin-
ciples which he called the "unity of opposites," 
the "negation of the negation," and the change of 
quantity into quality. While abstruse if not ab-
surd, these principles have been applied most in-
geniously. The first justifies the combination of 
oppression and freedom within a country in the

WORLD COMMUNISM AND THE U. S. S. R. ? CONFIDENTIAL 
sense that the enemies of communism are oppressed 
while its adherents are free to enjoy its benefits. 
The second justifies Communist warfare against 
the capitalistic state because it produces freedom 
for the masses. The third proposes that the trans-
formation of one thing into another is qualitative 
and extreme; therefore, a violent revolution is 
required to change society from capitalism to com-
munism. Reform is purely a quantitative matter 
and no fundamental change ever occurs. 
The historical application of Marxist dialectical 
materialism also involved the division of society 
into classes and an explanation of history on the 
basis of class struggle. By its very nature, this 
struggle was identified as the means for the even-
tual and inevitable transformation of society. In-
terestingly enough, Marx never took the trouble 
to define his term, "class." 
The second feature of the philosophy of Marx 
is his doctrine of the economic processes, includ-
ing production and distribution. Two aspects of 
this doctrine are his labor theory of value and 
his theory of surplus value. While not only in-
accurate but also false, his theory is that the 
value of commodities is a result solely of labor 
and, further, that profit represents nothing more 
than unpaid labor. In essence, this economic doc-
trine is a theory of increasing exploitation of labor 
with the lot of the workers becoming progressively 
worse until they inevitably rise in revolt. In ap-
plying this doctrine, the Communists regard the 
economic processes as the base for the entire so-
cial structure of capitalism, including government 
and law, science, religion, art, and philosophy. 
The arena of the class struggle is the economic 
base. Since the theory suggests that the economic 
processes of capitalism must inevitably be de-
stroyed, it follows logically, in the minds of the 
Communists, that the balance of the social struc-
ture must also be destroyed because it would no 
longer have a foundation upon which to rest. 
The third feature of Marx's teachings is his 
theory of the State and of the revolutionary proc-
ess. Since he believed the apparatus of the State 
to be nothing more than "a machine for the op-
pression of one class by another," he was convinced 
that it would "wither away" when the true Com-
munist society came into being. However, ac-
cording to his concept of the revolutionary process, 
this transformation of human society was not to 
be accomplished in one step, but rather in several. 
In the first, the bourgeoisie would assume power; 
in the second, the proletariat would take control. 
This second, transitionary period he labeled the 
"Dictatorship of the Proletariat," during which 
time the State would be continued, but as an arm 
of the masses. Only later, at some future time 
which was never defined, would all semblance of 
the State disappear and the true Communist 
society emerge based upon the philosophy: "from 
each according to his ability, to each according to 
his needs." It is this theory of the State and of 
the revolutionary process which has been particu-
larly subjected to interpretation and manipulation 
by Communist leaders who followed Marx. 
Communism and Socialism 
Any discussion of communism must also include 
socialism which was already a well-known term in 
the time of Marx. While space does not permit 
a detailed consideration of socialism as a system 
of thought and a course of social action, four 
points regarding it should be mentioned. First, 
socialism is revolutionary by its very nature be-
cause it seeks a basic change in social institutions 
by a number of methods. This question of method 
is one point of difference between present day 
Socialists and Communists. Second, there are 
many kinds of socialism, of which Marxist social-
ism or communism is only one. Third, as a social 
philosophy, socialism includes doctrines which are 
not only economic in nature but also political, edu-
cational, cultural, and sociological. Fourth, to 
the Communists, socialism is a means, not an end?
a tool with which to build a world Communist 
society. This Communist viewpoint that social-
ism is a lower phase of communism is one reason 
why some scholars conclude that any movement 
toward socialism will ultimately redound to the 
advantage of communism. 
The Development of the Theory

evolved during the past 100 years is the product of 
the thinking and the writings of 4 men: Karl

Joseph Stalin. Marx has been described as the 
"originator" of modern communism, contributing 
its basic concepts. Called the "collaborator," 
Engels worked closely with Marx to systematize 
these basic concepts; his contributions included 
organizational ability and aggressive leadership. 
Lenin and Stalin made practical application of the 
Marxist theories to the social conditions of their 
own times. 
Communist historians regard Lenin as the "de-
veloper." Enlarging upon the theory of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat, he was able to 
apply it successfully in Russia. Since he believed 
that the proletariat was not as yet capable of ad-
ministering the State, he advanced the theory of 
the Communist Party as the core and "the van-
guard of the proletariat, the general staff of the 
revolution." Interestingly enough, he did not con-
ceive of the party as proletarian by nature; in 
fact, many of its leaders have been and are intel-
lectuals and of middle-class origin. Nonetheless, 
the party "expresses the interests of the proletar-
iat." Lenin expanded upon the theory of im-
perialism as the final stage of capitalistic develop-
ment. He also enlarged upon the strategy and 
tactics of world revolution and played a major 
part in the organization of the Third Interna-
tional. In effect, he restated the Marxist philos-
ophy in order to apply it more effectively to the 
Russian State. 
Stalin's place in Communist history is that of 
the "continuer." His particular contribution to 
theory is the concept of consolidating socialism in 
one country first (Soviet Russia). He converted 
the party into a strong administrative bureaucracy 
and further defined its functions within the dicta-
torship of the proletariat. In rejecting the 
"withering of the state" theory, he modified the 
Marxist philosophy. At the same time, he ampli-
fied it by introducing the concept of State plan-
ning and emphasizing the industrialization of the 
country and the collectivizing of agriculture. 
Just as the theory of communism is the product 
of the work of these four men, so likewise is the 
growth and expansion of communism into its pres-
ent position as a world political force attributable 
to their influences.

THE GROWTH OF COMMUNISM 
Karl Marx 
A German philosopher and economic historian 
who had settled in London, Karl Marx was among 
the more unconventional writers of the mid-19th 
century period. His massive work entitled Daa 
Kapital includes some remarkably well docu-
mented and detailed descriptions of the objection--
able working conditions in the coal mines, the 
mills, and the factories, as they existed in his time. 
Radical as it was at the time, his analysis was an 
outgrowth and a perversion of some of the theories 
of the classical economists who are today often 
regarded as conservative. In the light of present 
day economics, many of his analytical conclusions 
are easily proven false. Marx is also well-knovvnL 
for his economic interpretation of history, even 
though he was not the sole originator of this con-
cept. While this concept becomes absurd by ex-
cessive application, it is important enough as an 
analytical approach to history to have made a 
contribution to the thinking of non-Marxist 
historians. 
Marx was definitely a materialist; for him all 
reality was autodynamic. He viewed life as a 
struggle for material goods, without a question of 
the hereafter. For Marx, there was nothing out-
side, above, or below nature. All was nature in a 
state of eternal, dialectical flux. From his ideas 
emerged the doctrine of the class struggle between 
the oppressed who were the workers and the op-
pressors who were the bourgeoisie. Because he 
believed the false doctrine of surplus value, Marx 
saw wealth being concentrated more and more in 
the hands of the few, with the wage earners unable 
to buy what they themselves produced. Such a 
situation, according to Marxist doctrine, leads to 
overproduction and unemployment, to imperial-
ism in finding new markets, and to war. On the 
basis of his economic interpretation of history, 
Marx also expected that in time the desperate 
proletariat would rise in violent revolution to de-
stroy the bourgeois oppressors and create a strong 
dictatorship which would exist only until the last 
traces of the old society had disappeared. In the 
new society, when the workers owned the means of 
production and no profits were paid, the need for 
a dominant organized State to regulate the work-

WORLD COMMUNISM AND THE U. S. S. R. CONFIDENTIAL 
ers would disappear, and a new classless, stateless, 
and happy society would result. 
To a degree, Marx was a frustrated personality 
rebelling against the social conditions of his age, 
and, originally at least, quite willing for violent 
death to be the fate of the "enemies" of the work-
ing class. But his false assumptions and incom-
plete analyses led him to false conclusions. His 
materialistic approach to life is rejected by all 
who recognize that life also has spiritual values 
which transcend its material benefits. Men live 
by bread, but not by bread alone. 
The Marxist doctrines had a curious appeal, at-
tracting a varied but limited group of followers 
in the beginning. Among these were some dis-
contented intellectuals who imagined themselves 
in the vanguard of bold new thought; those who 
philosophically favored the destruction of existing 
institutions and moral values; those just too gulli-
ble and ignorant to see the ultimate results of a 
social system that promised peace and plenty in 
exchange for a violent revolutionary struggle; 
and, finally, the unscrupulous opportunists who 
would support any movement that promised per-
sonal rewards at the expense of society. 
In connection with the "inevitable" aspect of the 
social and economic doctrines advanced by Marx, 
it should be noted that the American social struc-
ture has been a particular puzzle to the strictly 
Marxian analysts, because its development has con-
futed their basic assumptions. Despite the 
growth of capitalism in the United States and the 
appearance of huge corporations, the standard of 
living has steadily improved and the ownership 
base has remained very broad. Public acceptance 
of sound regulation has produced a pattern of life 
far different from the dire prophecies of the Marx-
ists, although many of the present-day adherents 
of Marxist philosophy refuse to recognize Ameri-
can accomplishments. 
The First International 
The age of Marx has been described as a time 
of tumult and trouble. In 1848 Marx and Engels 
published the Communist Manifesto, marking a 
true turning point from the many Utopian social-
ist plans to a world revolutionary movement. 
They called upon the workers of the world to arise, 
since they had "nothing to lose but their chains." 
201 
Revolution broke out in Paris just a few days after 
this document was printed, but it, as well as its 
counterparts all over Europe, was short-lived. 
Many of the German participants fled to America 
and England. In the years that followed, Eng-
lish, French, German, Italian, and other working-
men met, and eventually in 1864 formed the In-
ternational Workingmen's Association, commonly 
known as the First International. Marx was a 
leading figure in the organization. Its purpose 
was to unite and advance the workingmen's move-
ments in all European countries, but it eventually 
fell to pieces because, for one reason, many of the 
participants had paramount interest in their own 
national objectives. In the Franco-Prussian War, 
with the Germans at the gates of Paris, French 
workers rose to create the Paris Commune, whose 
bloody suppression was another factor in the de-
struction of the First International. In 1872 the 
headquarters were transferred to New York, but 
in a short time the organization dwindled away 
and was finally disbanded in 1876. 
The Second International 
Formed in 1889, on the 100th anniversary of the 
French Revolution by delegates from 17 countries 
meeting in Paris, the Second International existed 
until World War I as a rather loose federation of 
socialist parties and a society of professional revo-
lutionaries. It had liaison and information-
gathering functions and pressure was exerted to 
unite divisive socialist groups. The organization 
is difficult to describe in general terms because of 
its diverse elements, ranging from Marxists to 
those who favored gradual reform within the 
framework of existing institutions. The con-
servative elements largely supported the Allied 
war cause in World War I, while the Russian mem-
bers favored a policy of revolution. It was this 
split that led to the creation of the Third Inter-
national in 1919, often known as the Comintern 
or Communist International. 
Those parties who refused to affiliate with the 
Comintern, and who had left the Second Inter-
national, formed their own organization. In 1923 
they joined with the remnants of the Second In-
ternational to establish the Labor and Socialist 
International (LSI). The national character of 
the socialist movements affiliated in its large mem-

bership weakened its international effectiveness, 
and it finally ceased to exist. 
The Russian Revolution 
While the intellectuals debated and the revolu-
tionaries climbed soap boxes or plotted coups in 
cellars, events of significance were transpiring in 
the land of the tzars. This vast and predomi-
nantly agricultural nation had remained in rela-
tive isolation from the economic and political 
changes in Europe and America, and the despotic 
power of the tzars had preserved aspects of the 
feudal system long after they had been destroyed 
in the rest of Europe. Marx never went to Russia 
nor did he envision that his doctrines would be 
applied there. However, the combination of many 
circumstances in that ultraconservative empire was 
to bring about a violent change. 
Russia experienced an aborted revolution in 
1905. Some of the surviving revolutionary lead-
ers who were not exiled to Siberia escaped to Ger-
any, France, and Switzerland; others stayed 
"underground" in European Russia. Marxist 
philosophies were strongest among certain groups 
in Germany. When the intelectual theories of 
Marx were combined with the practical revolu-
tionary techniques of Lenin, in part influenced by 
Sun Yat-Sen, a potentially dangerous force had 
come into existence. 
The terrible attrition of World War I, the 
misery of the lower classes under the cumulative 
oppression of the Tzarist regime, and some German 
conniving brought civil war to Russia again. The 
overthrow of the Tzar was followed first by the 
relatively moderate socialistic government of 
Kerensky, and then by the skillful seizure of power 
by the Bolsheviki under Lenin. Their ruthless 
methods, and the dissension among opposing 
groups, led to eventual consolidation of power in 
the hands of the Communist Party. 
COMMUNIST RUSSIA 
It should be pointed out that the resulting gov-
ernment in Russia, for all its lip service to Marx, 
has yet to create a true Marxist state. The ideal 
of the classless society with its common ownership, 
no exploitation, no government, and "from each 
according to his ability to each according to his 
need" has not materialized, nor are there any signs 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Approved For Release 20 
that it will. From a detached intellectual point 
of view, true Marxism, shorn of revolution, might 
have a certain appeal to those who are willing to 
overlook practical problems of human behavior 
and who are unaware of the serious scientific and 
philosophic errors in the Marxist analysis. But 
Marxism in practice, as sponsored by the Soviet 
Union and its international following, is quite an-
other matter, which should be ample proof of the 
fallacies of its theory. Even the communists will 
admit that Soviet Russia is in the transitional 
stage of Socialism, or public ownership of the 
means of production. But what has developed is 
State Capitalism with a ruthless exercise of total 
power by a dictatorship. Thus a doctrine, orig-
inally philosophical, has developed into a force 
seeking world domination. 
Reshaping Society 
The Russian communist leaders have been emi-
nently practical men, willing to compromise or 
adapt their principles to accomplish their goal 
of consolidation of power. They have expertly 
carried out the techniques of revolution by seizure, 
of power following infiltration. They haw 
worked hard to reshape mankind to their type of 
society. Institutions and ideas that conflicted 
with their own have been ruthlessly destroyed. 
Religious activities, with their emphasis on moral 
values, have been stifled, except when for tactical 
reasons temporary concessions have seemed advis-
able. Those who had a stake in the older society, 
such as property owners, officials, and community 
leaders, have been liquidated or shipped to slave 
camps. The flexible doctrine that any means are 
justified by the end has opened the door to a 
complete new code of behavior in individual and 
collective life. The individual is no longer dig-
nified as such, but subordinate to the party goals. 
An important feature of the Soviet state is cen-
tral planning. Some may think that the differ-
ences in planning by Communist and non-Commu-
nist states are only differences of degree, but such 
a conclusion is not only an oversimplification, but 
precludes correct analysis of the problem. The 
Soviets plan production, confiscate resources with-
out compensation, and then exercise rigid control 
of practically all human activity to conform to 
the plan. Of course, a degree of central planning

WORLD COMMUNISM AND THE U. S. S. R. CONFIDENTIAL 
is essential for any State; for example, all coun-
tries collect data on price levels, credit needs, and 
similar items of national concern. A number of 
States have also created central banks to control 
money supply and price levels for the minimum 
purpose of stabilizing their economy. Some non-
Communist countries use degrees of planning and 
control to meet their own needs that are less gen-
erally accepted in the United States. However, 
there can be no question that what we know as 
democracy is not compatible with the Soviet pat-
tern of life. The Soviets have combined the doc-
trines of Marx, which embody Hegel's dialectics, 
Darwin's survival of the fittest, Ricardo's economic 
materialism, and the economic interpretation of 
history with the revolutionary techniques of 
Lenin and Stalin's Communist Party dictatorship. 
This is the antithesis of democracy. 
Forwarding the Revolution 
Lenin believed that the approach to revolution 
should vary with the type of country involved. 
In major nations it should begin with the ballot 
and then be followed by violent revolution. The 
client powers were to be oriented toward the Soviet 
Union and then finally absorbed. Dependent 
peoples could be taken over by directly sponsor-
ing revolution, while backward people could be 
absorbed when convenient. 
Once Russia had become a Soviet state, though 
still weak, there arose the question of what was 
to be the next step. This resulted in a struggle 
for power among the Bolshevist leaders. Trotsky 
was ready to go ahead with revolution on a world 
scale. On the other hand, having already experi-
enced foreign intervention in the invasion of Rus-
sia and Siberia by the Allies after World War I, 
other Soviet leaders thought that an issue should 
not be made of world communism until it was 
strong enough to be assured of success. Stalin, 
although no less interested than Trotsky in world 
revolution, wanted to attain undisputed leadership 
in Russia first. Also, he firmly believed that an 
adaptation of Marxism was necessary to permit 
the establishment of a party composed of workers 
and peasants. In a double maneuver to strengthen 
the party and increase agricultural output, he 
instituted the bloody and ruthless collectivization 
of farms. Less than a century before, the peas-
203 
ants had won their freedom from serfdom, and 
now they were deprived of their land again. In-
dustry was also nationalized. A succession of 
police organizations enforced compliance and 
stamped out opposition. 
Party Control 
Party members, as well as passively resisting 
Russian citizens have faced execution and Siberian 
exile, for successive power struggles within the 
party have tolerated no division of leadership or 
dissent. The principle of government is the "in-
terlocking directorate ;" that is, officials wear two 
hats, one as heads of government ministries re-
sponsible for management and administration, 
and the other as members of the Praesidium where 
policy is formulated and control exercised. For 
almost 30 years Stalin was the dominant figure 
in both government and party; he was chairman 
of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers, the 
executive organ of the Supreme Soviet, and also 
General Secretary of the Communist Party, in 
which role he presided over meetings of the Prae-
sidium, a powerful combination of the former 
Politburo and Orgburo effected by a party reor-
ganization in 1951. Thus party control was made 
absolute, and party loyalty became a paramount 
virtue, the stepping-stone to prestige and influence. 
Russian Traditionalism 
Stalin was not only an improviser and believer 
in expediency, but a natural product of his en-
vironment. Consequently, under him, many pol-
icies and views of tzarist times continued to shape 
the behavior of the U. S. S. R. The traditional 
Russian obsession with security has made "perni-
cious foreign influence" a major concern of both 
propaganda and actual policy. Many geopoliti-
cal ideas have found expression in Soviet Russia. 
The central cores of power are Moscow and the 
area east of the Urals, both of which are partly 
shielded by the Ukrainian food circle and by the 
Arctic wastes. The next lines of defense are the 
border S. S. R.'s : Karelo-Finnish, Byelo-Russian, 
Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Mol-
davian, the three Transcaucasian, the Kirghiz, 
Uzbek, Turkmen, Tadzikh, and Kazakh. Next

Austria, Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania, Outer Mon-
golia, Sinkiang, China, and North Korea. Rus-
sia has evidenced interest in adding Finland, 
Yugoslovia, Greece, Turkey, and Iran to the list. 
The Russian policies of imperialism have found 
new expression in many forms. By party activity 
and strikes, the Soviet Communists have engi-
neered trouble in France and Italy. By support-
ing Communist military forces they have 
attempted to further their designs in Korea, 
Indo-China, and Malaya. Through intrigue, espi-
onage, subversion, and sabotage their influence has 
been felt in every part of the world. 
While the young Bolshevik government was 
struggling to establish itself, it emphasized con-
solidation at home so long as separate Ukrainian, 
Byelo-Russian, Transcaucasian, and Central Asian 
governments followed parallel and friendly 
courses. However, as soon as the time was ripe, 
all these territories were reabsorbed into the new 
Soviet-pattern Russian empire. The Soviet 
Union has seemed quite intent on regaining all 
former tzarist territories. This it has largely ac-
complished, except for the Finnish defiance and 
the United States ownership of Alaska. 
Another feature of Soviet policy has been to 
make strategic moves to further traditional Rus-
sian objectives. Among these are domination of 
the Baltic and Black Seas, including eventual con-
trol of their entrances, the acquisition of warm 
water ports on the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian 
Oceans, sponsorship of the Pan-Slavic movement, 
and the attainment of economic self-sufficiency. 
To these have been added two special Soviet ideas: 
overcoming capitalist encirclement, and hastening 
the day of world revolution. 
Soviet World Objectives 
Soviet moves seem calculated to assure that the 
Soviet Union itself will survive, and beyond that 
point, will expand its territories as far as possible. 
This requires early consolidation of power in the 
countries of eastern Europe, leading to possible 
political merger into the U. S. S. R. Other pos-
sible objectives are to retard and weaken such 
blocks of power as may develop, particularly in 
western Europe and the Near East; to destroy 
Anglo-American friendship; to undermine French 
cooperation in the Anglo-American alliance; to 
CONFIDENTIAL 
204 
keep Japan, Red China, and Germany sufficiently 
weak until Soviet control is complete; to absorb 
Austria; and to establish a dominating influence 
over the Dardanelles, the Suez Canal, and the 
Middle East oil fields. Further objectives include 
stirring up trouble in colonies and former colonies, 
taking over or destroying the socialist movement, 
infiltrating trade unions especially in key indus-
tries, and using international organizations for 
propaganda purposes to strengthen the Soviet 
Union and its satellites. All of these plans are 
self-evident from the record of recent years. 
Building Power at Home 
Meanwhile at home the Soviet Communists are 
exerting strenuous efforts to industrialize the 
country, with heavy industry and armament com-
ing first, and consumer goods being produced only 
in the amount necessary to prevent uncontrollable 
unrest. To meet the production goals, labor is 
moved by the millions to new industrial sites, to 
mines, and to railway and road construction areas. 
This at the same time disposes of dissident groups 
or ethnic minorities and keeps costs low, since 
slaves under the bayonet and whip need only min-
imum material rewards. 
THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL 
From the apparent scope of Soviet activities it 
should be quite evident why they are of concern 
to the free countries of the world. As much as 
we may deplore the absence of all the democratic 
advantages in certain parts of the world, we be-
lieve that foreign peoples must live their own 
lives according to the pattern they choose. We 
have hoped that normal social evolution in time 
would correct and improve conditions abroad. 
But when a powerful State not only aggressively 
disseminates economic, political, and social doc-
trines diametrically opposed to our own, but also 
develops great military power in a determination 
to dominate an ever increasing part of the world, 
the problem becomes quite different. Peaceful co-
existence with a Communist Russia, just as with 
Nazi Germany, presupposes not only an isolation-
ist tendency on our part, but a basic change in 
Soviet objectives. Since the U. S. S. R. has openly 
and avowedly embarked on a course of world

WORLD COMMUNISM AND T . . . IIIONFiDENTIAL 
conquest, there is little to indicate such a while the war with Nazi Germany was in prog-
possibility. 
The issue is more complicated than simply one 
of imperialism versus the status quo. Some people 
mistakenly believe that our quarrel is not with 
communism but with Russian imperialism. The 
two are inseparable, for a basic aim of communism 
is world-wide destruction of noncommunistic in-
stitutions and society through violent revolution. 
Such an ideological struggle involves more than 
military forces; it affects every aspect of life. 
The Utilization of Theory 
The consummate skill and cunning with which 
the Communists translate theory into action has 
been demonstrated by the use made of the Third 
International, or Communist International (Corn-
intern) , as an instrument for world revolution and 
conquest. Unlike the earlier Internationals, this 
later world organization has emphasized rigid 
party discipline. National parties are not separate 
sections to be loosely federated, but rather tightly 
integrated units of one world movement. The ap-
plication of Communist principles in the Russian 
State has not only given reality to the theory 
but also has made available tremendous physical 
resources. With the Soviet Union as the "Father-
land," the Communist state in being, Communists 
the world over have had a tangible object to which 
to transfer their loyalties. At the same time, the 
Comintern has provided a means for close inter-
national ties. The resilient strength of this world-
wide organization has been indicated by its ready 
adaptability to the sudden shifts and changes in 
Soviet policy. On numerous occasions the various 
national Communists have revealed their point of 
view that what is advantageous for the Soviet 
Union is advantageous for them. Thus it has 
become exceedingly clear that international Com-
munism is an integral part of Soviet global 
strategy. 
In the period between World Wars I and II, 
the Comintern openly held a series of world con-
gresses to formulate Communist policy which was 
admittedly linked closely with the interests of the 
Soviet fatherland. However, in 1943, to allay the 
suspicions of the western powers, this organization 
was dissolved as a gesture to show that subversive 
activity in Capitalist countries had been suspended 
205 
ress?but not for long. In 1947, the Communist 
Information Bureau (Cominform) was created as 
a result of an international meeting of Communists 
held in Poland. It was not supposed to represent 
a revival of the Comintern, but to serve only as a 
European bureau for the exchange of ideas and in-
formation, and to bring a degree of coordination 
to "democratic" movements. These descriptions 
of the Comintern and Cominform are what the 
Communists themselves admit publicly. Actually, 
this is a small part of the story, for the evidence is 
overwhelming that the Comintern was almost ex-
clusively the instrument of the Soviet Union. Al-
though this organization was officially dissolved in 
1943, its principles were not: they merely assumed 
new modes. The Qominform, even more rigidly 
subservient to Moscow, appears to be an apparatus 
for world propaganda, subversion, and espionage. 
Subsidiary Applications of Theory 
As has been already indicated, communism in 
various countries is the tool of international com-
munism controlled from the Soviet Union. There-
fore it is a domestic enemy to be combatted. by the 
police, the courts, and the educational system, as 
well as the armed forces. Few can doubt that the 
United States itself is under attack by unorthodox 
weapons that cannot be challenged alone by the 
battleship, the tank, or the bomber. Required is 
a joint effort of all social forces in the nation. 
No Communist Party in any country should be 
confused with ordinary political parties, because it 
is essentially an underground movement. True, it 
may have a conventional organization which nomi-
nates candidates for political office, and many fel-
low travelers vote for these candidates and take 
part in the overt activities of the party. But it 
has been thoroughly documented in recent years, 
in the United States at least, that the core of the 
Communist Party is made up of disciplined people 
who operate at a conspiratorial level. 
As set forth in published evidence, the Com-
munist Party of the United States openly em-
braces the principles of Marxism-Leninism and 
advocates the overthrow and destruction of the 
United States Government by force and violence. 
Its pattern of action clearly indicates guidance and 
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENntroved For Releasq:ANyaa9gE: RitiorDA8L5?)911::?10E1000100210002-9 
direction of a foreign origin, as well as close as-
sociation with the international Communist move-
ment. Its methods also reflect its relationships 
with the Soviet Union and the Cominform. As do 
other Communists, those in the United States fol-
low the "hard core" principle, which discourages 
large numbers and favors fewer members who are 
active and intensely loyal. Such party members 
associate themselves with worthy public causes, 
adopt misleading party names and alliances, en-
courage labor strikes and disturbances, and at-
tempt to infiltrate into government, the armed 
forces, and police agencies. Espionage is a com-
mon feature, aimed at the transmission of vital 
information to the Soviet Union to serve Com-
munist aims and objectives. Likewise, in its 
fanatical loyalty to Communist principles, the 
American Communist Party has a sabotage poten-
tial which can be directed against the United 
States at any time. 
In depreciating the seriousness of the Commu-
nist menace, some Americans have expressed the 
opinion that Trotsky was a dangerous Bolshevist 
type because he wanted to hasten world revolu-
tion, but that Stalin was interested only in Rus-
sia's domestic progress, although he used drastic 
measures to save time. Others regard Trotsky as 
an idealist betrayed by the heartless tyrant Stalin. 
It seems clear that both of these men were dedi-
cated to the principle of world revolution. Stalin, 
supposedly concerned solely with internal develop-
ment, was just more patient and thorough in his 
plans. He built his world organization in dupli-
cating and parallel form. There are the overt 
organizations whose mission is to do as much as 
possible to create dissent, to recruit, to propa-
gandize. There are also the covert organizations 
for the collection of information, for sabotage, and 
for infiltration of every type of social group. All 
represent powerful weapons whose capabilities 
will not become apparent unless widespread mili-
tary war breaks out, and even then will be difficult 
of assessment. 
Obviously many of these organizations are par.. 
ticularly potent against a democracy such as the 
United States. Already the Bill of Rights has 
been used as a defense by those who seek to destroy 
its principles. Patriotic Americans sometimes 
propose measures to "smoke out subversives" that 
CONFIDENTIAL 
206 
as a cure may be as bad as the disease. Certainly 
the problem cannot be solved by strict censorship 
measures or disregard for the rights of citizenship 
or due process of law. Yet there are times when 
national survival may require stringent measures, 
applied with intelligence and discernment. 
Factors in the Growth of Communism 
The significant growth of world communism, 
especially in the post-World War II period, is the 
result of many factors, among them being: effec-
tive organization and organized deception, world 
conditions which favored the acceptance of Com-
munist theory, and the war prestige of the Soviet 
Union. 
As already shown, the Communists, even before 
the end of the war, had developed active organi-
zations which were both international and domes-
tic in nature. Armed with theory translated into 
organized action, they were prepared to move into 
national vacuums created by the disorganization 
of social structures in the aftermath of war and 
Nazi tyranny. The preparatory efforts of Lenin 
and Stalin, who had stressed the importance of 
organization, made possible the maximum utiliza-
tion of every opportunity which presented itself. 
The operations of the Communist Parties of Italy 
and France are notable examples of the Soviet 
effort to influence political activities within non-
Communist states. The underlying technique in 
all instances was carefully calculated organized 
deception. 
The terrible destruction of World War II, its 
dislocation of national economies and political 
structures, and its imposition of widespread hard-
ships and untold suffering on large segments of 
the world's population all combined to create re-
ceptive attention in many areas to the glittering 
Communist promises of security and a better life. 
The situation for many people was such that they 
felt they had nothing to lose, and everything to 
gain. As a result, some succumbed, unaware of 
the harsh, ugly realities of Communist rule. Not 
to be underestimated, therefore, is the appeal of 
theory as a factor in the rapid growth of the Com-
munist movement. 
Backing up the organizations and the theory 
have been the Soviet Armies which gained great 
prestige during the war. In the postwar period,

the threat of their power, to say nothing of their 
proximity, has introduced the factor of uncer-
tainty if not of intimidation, particularly for the 
nations of Europe. In addition, the wartime in-
trusion of Communists, openly devoted to their 
"cause," into places of leadership within under-
ground resistance movements in Europe and else-
where has proved to be an additional source of 
strength. 
Since the Soviet state is a motivating force for 
world communism, it is appropriate to consider 
certain of its elements of power. 
THE SOVIET STATE 
Historical Background 
As stated in chapter 5, the assessment of a state 
is more than a description of its strategic position, 
its resources, and its industry. It is also essential 
to study its people and their background. The 
historical beginnings of Russia are lost in vague 
antiquity. Geographically, Russia was considered 
the dividing line between the races and cultures of 
Europe and those of Asia. To the east in Asia 
were nomadic tribes of Mongolians, Tatars, and 
Turks. Perhaps by the sixth century A. D., 
Slavic tribes from northeast of the Carpathians 
began to move into the wooded areas of western 
Russia and to spread along the river valleys to 
the Baltic. In the ninth century the Vikings es-
tablished trading posts at Novgorod in the west, 
and also at Kiev in the east. Both became im-
portant centers of government and culture. Satel-
lite colonies and subject territories spread across 
much of European Russia. Novgorod became a 
merchant city in the Hanseatic League of the Mid-
dle Ages. Kiev established contact with the East-
ern Roman Church at Constantinople, and thus 
became Christian, also receiving the Cyrillic al-
phabet, and many features of art and architecture. 
The power of Kiev declined under increasing 
tribal attacks from the east, and Muscovy, because 
of its more sheltered position in the upper Volga 
basin, became the new center of power. 
During the 13th century all European 
Russia except Novgorod was conquered by the 
Mongols of Genghis Khan and his successors, who 
dominated the country for 21/2 centuries and em-
planted many of their own racial and cultural 
207 
characteristics. During the 13th century Russia 
was also invaded from the west by the Swedes, 
who conquered Finland and attacked Novgorod, 
and by the Teutonic Knights, who invaded the 
Baltic coast and established such cities as Riga. 
In the 14th century Lithuania and Poland, joined 
through royal marriage, dominated territories 
from the Baltic nearly to the Black Sea. The 
Lithuanian part is now Byelo-Russia, and the 
Polish part is now the Ukraine. The princes at 
Moscow gradually Odned power and finally won 
freedom from Tatar control. 
At this time the Ottoman Turks overran the 
Middle East and took Constantinople, forcing the 
Eastern church to move its headquarters to Mos-
cow. Ivan III assumed the title of Tzar (Caesar) 
when he married the niece of the last Byzantine 
emperor in 1472. Then began a period of expan-
sion of power. Traders and settlers pushed out-
ward all the way to the Arctic shores and in 1648 
reached the Pacific. During the following 200 
years there were recurrent conflicts with the Turks, 
Tatars, Poles, Swedes, Lithuanians, and the Teu-
tonic Knights. 
Peter the Great, in the late 17th and early 18th 
centuries, tried to westernize his country. Forcing 
out the Swedes, he moved into the Baltic states 
and established St. Petersburg as a great Russian 
seaport. Catherine the Great, 1762-96, won back 
the territories occupied by Poland, and her armies 
also pushed to the shores of the Black Sea. Later 
the Caucasus and Finland were conquered. Rus-
sian explorers pushed far afield, establishing set-
tlements not only in Pacific Siberia but along the 
Alaskan shores. By 1812 a colony was established 
just north of San Francisco at Fort Ross. To 
some degree Russia was involved in intrigue in 
California and Mexico even after the Fort Ross 
post was sold. The problem was finally eliminated 
by our purchase of Alaska in 1867. 
Meanwhile in Europe Russia had been at war 
with Napoleon, and after his famous winter re-
treat, the Russian armies marched across Europe 
to France, hailed as liberators from the tyrant. 
In the years that ensued, Russia held a dominant 
position in Central and Eastern Europe, helping 
to suppress revolts in Austria and Prussia, but 
aiding the Balkan states to win freedom from the 
Turks.

NCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
In the Crimean War of the 1850's the British 
and French joined with Turkey to block Russian 
expansion into the Mediterranean. Again in 
1877-8, Britain, Austria, and Germany aided 
Turkey to prevent Russian conquest of the Darda-
nelles. Thwarted in this direction, Russia wrested 
control of the lower Amur basin from China, and 
just before the end of the century laid railway 
lines through Manchuria and took Port Arthur. 
Rivalries with Japan in Korea brought a war that 
the new trans-Siberian railway could not sustain 
logistically. This led to Japanese domination in 
southern Manchuria, Korea, and south Sakhalin. 
Participation in the first world conflict came 
when Russia declared war in behalf of Serbia 
against Austria. Germany was able eventually to 
overrun much of White Russia, the Ukraine, and 
Finland; Rumania took Bessarabia; and the Turks 
entered the Caucasus. With internal revolution 
and chaos rife in Russia, the western Allies in-
vaded Murmansk, Archangel, Far Eastern Siberia, 
and Baku. At the end of the war, Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Finland, Poland, and Bessarabia were 
all separated from Russia, and the Ukraine gained 
autonomy. Revolt in Turkestan lasted until 1923. 
Marshal Pilsudski in 1920 mounted fresh attacks 
from Poland which led to the capture of Kiev, and 
his forces reached Odessa. Russian counter-
attacks would have destroyed Poland again but 
for British and French intervention. 
Russia made a few overt moves, aside from re-
absorbing the Ukraine, Turkestan, and Trans-
caucasia, until 1939 when her pact with Hilter led 
to the repartition of Poland, the absorption of the 
Baltic states, and war with Finland. German 
armies in 1941 began Operation Barbarosa that 
laid waste territories extending from the Arctic to 
the gates of Moscow and down to the Caucasus. 
An awakening patriotism and ruthless govern-
mental measures supported by American lend-lease 
aid, enabled the Russians to turn the tide after the 
defense of Stalingrad, and to sweep west into 
central and eastern Europe. In the Far East their 
last minute entry into the Pacific War gave them 
the Kuriles, the rest of Sakhalin, and, eventual 
domination of the Asiatic mainland, through the 
Chinese Reds, all the way to Southeast Asia. The 
wars, hot and cold, of recent years are all too 
CONFIDENTIAL 
208 
familiar for elaboration here. So much for the 
bare outlines of military and political change. 
Military .Geography 
Geographically the U. S. S. R. is a vast conti-
nental territory, sweeping some 6,000 miles east 
and west and 3,000 miles north and south. Much 
of it is a great plain that reaches from Poland 
across Eurasia to the Yenesei River, interrupted 
only by the moderate Ural Mountains. The mili-
tary approaches to this territory are few. The 
Arctic, frozen much of the year, has few transport 
routes across it, and the soil is swampy and the 
area insect-ridden during the brief season when it 
is not frozen and wind-swept. 
The Soviet Union is protected in most of its 
other approaches by high mountains and by great 
deserts. In the west, the Pripet Marshes are a 
barrier; the Balkan frontier has the Carpathians; 
the Caucasus ranges are very high. Formidable, 
too, are the great mountain belts near Iran, 
Afghanistan, Sinkiang, and Mongolia. The Pa-
cific flanks are also mountainous. Mongolia and 
much of the Turkestan area are deserts. The 
principal surface approaches are in the Mur-
mansk area, through the Baltic to Leningrad, from 
Germany on either side of the Pripet Marshes, or 
from the Black Sea. Entry is also possible, geo-
graphically speaking, along each shore of the 
Caspian from Iran, through the Dzungarian Gap 
from Sinkiang, or at the Pacific end of the country 
via Dairen, Vladivostok, or the Amur River. 
These military approaches, of course, are not 
wide open, since Soviet defenses are strong and 
the Red Army is likely to occupy most of them 
before any outside force could come near. Fur-
ther, mere entry into Soviet territory is not the 
same as occupying the seat of Soviet power. Key 
regions of greatest strategic significande include: 
(1) Moscow, (2) Leningrad, (3) the Donbas, (4) 
the Caucasus, (5) the Urals, (6) Tashkent, (7) the 
Kuzbas, (8) Lake Baikal, (9) Chita, and (10) 
Khabarovsk. These include the major industries 
and sources of raw materials. Two additional fuel 
sources that feed the industrial areas must be 
added : the Pechora and the Karaganda coal fields. 
The areas listed above are so widely distributed 
that the power of the Soviet Union, like that of a 
hydra-headed monster, cannot be destroyed by the 
occupation of any single one of them.

WORLD COMMUNISM AND THE U. S. S. R. CONFIDENTIAL 
What are some other strengths and weaknesses 
inherent in Russia's geographic position? It has 
already been pointed out that the country is vast, 
well protected on most frontiers, and with widely 
scattered centers of industry. The vastness is a 
defense, but it also poses grave problems of trans-
port. Given advance preparations, the Soviet 
Union from its interior position can strike out-
ward at adjacent Alaska and at Japan, strengthen 
its position in China, overrun the Middle East to 
reach the Indian Ocean and the Suez region, send 
forces throughout Scandinavia, and of course, re-
inforce the Balkans and move its heaviest forces 
westward beyond Poland to sweep Europe as far 
as the Pyrenees. It is hoped that NATO strength 
in time will minimize this likelihood. It may be 
that concentrated attacks upon the Soviet Union 
at unexpected points would create exceedingly dif-
ficult problems for the Russians in moving troops 
and supplies. This possibility has been antic-
ipated by the Russians, for large forces are main-
tained at all points where attack might come, a 
policy which only a country with a large man-
power pool can carry out. It has also been met by 
the virtually autonomous nature of many of the 
scattered industrial complexes. Munitions need 
not be moved from one end of the country to the 
other in all cases, for sources of supply are usually 
duplicated. 
Economic Development 
One of the significant features of economic de-
velopment has been the percentage shift of indus-
try to the area east of the Urals, although recon-
struction and even new construction in the area 
overrun by the Germans has also been very sub-
stantial. The major installations of the steel in-
dustry are in the Donbas of the Ukraine, in the 
Urals, and in the Far East. Iron ore is found in 
each of these regions. Coal is currently mined in 
large quantities in the Donbas, the Kuzbas, and 
in the Karaganda and Pechora regions. Iron ore 
and coal move in opposite directions between the 
Urals area and the Kuzbas, equalizing rail traffic, 
while Karaganda coal moves both to the Urals 
and to the Tashkent area. Pechora coal moves 
both to the Leningrad and Urals areas. These 
bulk movements will be vastly improved in the 
years ahead as lagging transport facilities, both 
209 
rail and water, are improved. Already double 
tracking and electrification are improving many 
of the railways. New short-cut routes will carry 
coal to Tashkent from Karaganda and to the Urals 
from the Pechora. New dams on rivers and canals 
will bring water transport to supplement the 
railways. 
The machinery and other complex industries 
have long been associated with western centers 
such as Moscow, Leningrad, and Gorky, but now 
new plants, plus plants moved in the face of Ger-
man invasion, turn out these products at widely 
scattered points all the way east to the Pacific. 
Tanks, aircraft, and railway equipment cannot 
be associated with a few areas alone. 
The Soviet Union is richly endowed with vir-
tually the whole range of materials needed for 
modern industry and war. Perhaps the major 
shortcomings are in molybdenum, and to some ex-
tent tungsten, though Communist China can sup-
ply the latter. Although they have enough to 
meet minimum war needs, they have need of more 
bauxite, bismuth, cadmium, zinc, uranium, abra-
sives, quartz, and talc. Petroleum shortages are 
frequently mentioned, but refining and transport 
capacity are probably more immediate problems 
than reserves. The country is also rich in other 
respects. It contains perhaps one-quarter of the 
timber stand of the world, enormous hydroelectric 
potentialities, and very considerable agricultural 
possibilities. 
Manpower 
The people themselves as a resource deserve 
mention. They are hardy and accustomed to 
Spartan living. Their numbers are not definitely 
known, but probably exceed 200 million. Al-
though divided into many races, they showed con-
siderable unity in the war against Germany before 
it was over. The population growth is such as to 
provide a high military manpower potential. 
Technology 
The Soviet Government has been very conscious 
of the need for catching up with the industrial 
development in Western Europe and America. 
Through 5-year plans, and frequently, ruthless 
measures, rapid progress has been made in heavy 
industry, the basis for both further expansion and

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
for munitions. Although their total capacity lags 
far below ours, direct statistical comparisons are 
dangerously misleading. Since consumer indus-
tries receive a very low priority, only enough to 
prevent overall lowered production or revolt, by 
far the greatest effort is in further expansion of 
heavy and munitions industries. In contrast, our 
own so-called minimum civilian needs even in war-
time swallow up very large quantities of labor and 
materials. 
The rugged simplicity of Soviet weapons is in 
striking contrast to the frequently indifferent re-
sults in consumer goods. Basic research and tech-
nical progress are given every encouragement, and 
have resulted in such outstanding achievements as 
some of the world's best tanks, artillery pieces, and 
jet fighter aircraft. Their emphasis on subma-
rines is of special interest to the United States 
Navy. Their achievement in atomic weapons has 
been reached by much more than highly skilled 
espionage; it represents technical skill and organ-
ized industrial effort. They have found a number 
of sources of uranium and are now carrying on a 
major atomic effort in several parts of their vast 
domain. 
Perhaps their two major industrial weaknesses 
are an inadequate transport system and the pres-
sure that would be felt in the oil industry during 
a sustained all-out war. 
Natural Resources 
Food supply has long been a matter of concern 
for the Soviet government. In the past the coun-
try was chiefly agricultural, and it still is in con-
siderable degree, despite the strenuous efforts to 
industralize. The key area agriculturally is a 
long belt of steppe land reaching across the 
Ukraine and out east of the Volga. Although 
much of it has the rich Chernozem type black soil, 
rainfall is scanty and uncertain. This limited 
and unreliable ability to produce food for a rap-
idly expanding population has serious implica-
tions. Even if new areas were brought under 
cultivation, less than 10 percent of the total land 
in Russia is arable, and much of this is marginal. 
Conquest of eastern Europe therefore represents 
an important strengthening of the food position. 
The Soviets have worked hard to develop new 
cold-resistant fast-maturing crops to expand pro-
CONFIDENTIAL 
210 
duction into the subarctic. The principal crops 
are wheat, rye, barley, potatoes, and sugar beets. 
Flax is raised in considerable quantities, and in-
creased production of cotton in Turkestan, and 
near the Black and Caspian Seas, is bringing self-
sufficiency. Meat has been in short supply for 
many years. 
The Soviet Union may well be the richest coun-
try in the world in mineral resources. Not; all 
of it has been thoroughly prospected, but vast 
resources of petroleum, coal, iron, manganese, 
chromium, magnesium, aluminum, gold, platinum, 
potash, and phosphate have already been found. 
There are very considerable amounts of copper, 
nickel, lead, zinc, graphite, mica, asbestos, fluor-
spar, quartz crystals, sulphur, and some titanium, 
tungsten, molybdenum, tin, and corundum. Co-
balt, cadmium, and vanadium may be available as 
byproducts from ores known to exist in Russia. 
Where a few of these materials are in short supply 
for industry, the satellites make up most defi-
ciencies. Molybdenum comes from East Germany, 
antimony from Czechoslovakia and China, tung-
sten from China, and mercury for a time came 
from Yugoslavia. It is harder to assess the actual 
position in uranium production, but in addition 
to the old pitchblende mines in the Czechoslovakia-
East Germany area, which have been thoroughly 
exploited, there are additional deposits in Poland 
and Bulgaria. More may be available in Man-
churia, and it is rumored in several public reports 
that vast amounts can be exploited in western 
Tibet. Within the Soviet Union there are known 
uranium deposits at Ukhta in northern Russia, 
in the Caucasus, southeastern Turkestan, the Altai 
Mountains, Tannu Tuva, and near Lake Baikal. 
Undoubtedly, exploration has revealed more. 
Their chief need for mineral exploitation is more 
engineers, more production and refining equip-
ment, and better railway transport. 
Soviet oil production has not kept pace fully 
with potential needs, but there are multiple sources 
under exploitation. The Caucasus area still leads 
in production, centering at Baku, Maikop, and 
Grosny. The trans-Volga and Emba River fields 
are being expanded. Other smaller fields are in 
the Gergana Valley of Turkestan, at Nebit Dag 
east of the Caspian, in the Kama River Valley, on 
Northern Sakhalin, and in Kamchatka. Still

WORLD COMMUNISM AND THE U. S. S. R. CONFIDENTIAL 
other newer fields are in the Pechora, the Yenesei, 
and Maya Valleys, and the Tamir Peninsula. The 
Lvov fields in former Poland are now within the 
Soviet Union. In addition, satellite Rumania has 
the Ploesti fields. Production is conceivably only 
one-tenth that of the United States, but consump-
tion by civilian motor vehicles and railways in the 
Soviet Union is negligible compared to ours. 
The Russians have made considerable improve-
ments in electric power production. The greatest 
dam in Europe before the war was the 900,000 
kilowatts-capacity Dnepr plant, comparable to 
Hoover Dam in power output. Since the war it 
has been restored, and a whole series of dams are 
either completed or projected along the Don and 
Volga. Potentially, there are large numbers of 
additional sites. Hydroelectric power is also de-
veloped in the Kola Peninsula, the Caucasus, and 
in southeastern Turkestan. Today output may be 
about one quarter that of the United States. 
Sociological Characteristics 
What manner of people have the Russians be-
come ? The question is difficult to answer in a few 
words. Representing a mixture of many cultures, 
they seem in many ways mystical, fond of phil-
osophizing, perhaps too willing to shrug off mis-
fortune, but able to endure discomfort and incon-
venience. Because of ignorance and poverty, only 
strong methods have been able to change the masses 
in their habitual ways. The people as a whole 
have never lived in a western democratic society, 
and their present government is certainly not con-
cerned with human rights or individual dignity. 
Although this is not meant to be an indictment of 
the Russian people, there is now a question of 
whether or not the people themselves, in their 
own society, may net be changing for the worse 
by our standards. The Russian nobility, prosper-
ous farmers, and business classes of the past were 
killed or driven from the country. The peasants, 
used to a simple and hardy life, bound by a love 
for their soil, have been uprooted by the millions 
to go into industry or to collective farms. The 
years of revolution, war, famine, and repression 
have affected family life and individual outlook. 
The present generation has known nothing else; 
only the old people remember an earlier life. The 
Soviet government has tried in this generation to 
211 
reshape attitudes and behavior, using any means 
regardless of the cost to individuals. It has 
speeded modern improvements and corrected some 
former shortcomings, but only at a terrible price 
in human suffering and damage to the finer sen-
sibilities of the people. The Soviet totalitarian 
state has not only brought planning to the econ-
omy, but police terror, spying, and regulation into 
every aspect of life. The social and political con-
sequences of communism are just as great and as 
serious as the economic. 
Communist minorities in the early days of revo-
lution manipulated themselves into power and in a 
conspiratorial manner have ruthlessly maintained 
their hold. Division of authority is not tolerated, 
and when rivals have appeared, they have been 
purged by standards so extreme that their fam-
ilies and associates, regardless of individual guilt, 
have also faced execution or imprisonment. Ter-
ror is the weapon used. There is no voice other 
than the voice of the Party, whether it be in the 
press, the school, or the political forum. The de-
tailed regulation of life with millions of informers 
makes anticommunist intrigue exceedingly diffi-
cult. Children are praised for testifying against 
their parents. Education and politics become the 
ritualistic repetition of Party dogmas, with devia-
tion a major sin. Yet despite a generation of re-
education and suppression, there are still stresses 
in Soviet society. Minorities to some degree still 
have Nationalist aspirations. Normal human 
feelings cannot be so suppressed that some do not 
rebel at cruelty. The years of sacrifice, always 
with the promise of a better future, have not 
brought an easier life to the masses, instead a new 
privileged class, the Party members, has arisen. 
Only a few others are also favored: scientists, 
artists, and military leaders. The top leaders 
seem to combine a very real devotion to the Party 
with an apparently considerable degree of cyni-
cism about some of the outward symbols used. In 
any event, extremes of privilege are very great, 
ranging according to rank within the Party, the 
military, and down through the intelligentsia to 
ordinary workers and peasants, finally reaching 
the "untouchables" of Soviet society, those out of 
favor with the Party and the slave laborers. No-
body knows how many laborers are in penal servi-
tude, but the number may be twenty or thirty mil-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
lion, representing ordinary criminals, political 
minorities, the indiscreet, kulaks and petty bour-
geoisie, or just people unfortunate enough to be 
within reach when more labor 'was required. 
The new generation takes this society for 
granted. Children old enough to go to school 
join the Young Pioneers, and if found worthy, are 
then graduated with suitable ritual to the Kom-
somols. In time, by rigid selection, a few join 
the elite Communist Party. Its numbers, kept to 
hard core strength by constant self-examination, 
are subjected to rigid tests and tasks in order to 
increase their usefulness to the Party. 
Political Institutions 
A facade of legal government, a written consti-
tution, and even elections exist, but it is the Party 
that rules through the Central Committee and 
the Party Presidium. It may be that there is 
freedom of expression and debate within the Party 
Presidium, but it is also likely that, in consider-
able degree, while Stalin was dictator, the mem-
bers waited for his nod. It is also possible that 
if some got illusions of grandeur, Stalin played 
them off against each other, or they suddenly died 
and enjoyed elaborate state funerals. 
The Party leaders live in country villas in the 
suburbs of Moscow, and ride to the Kremlin in 
limousines with police escort; but they also work 
very long hours. During Stalin's regime, late 
night conferences were customary. It is not yet 
possible to assess the consequences of the poli tical 
realignment which followed Stalin's death. How-
ever, there seems to be no reason for anticipating 
major changes in fundamental policy or in the 
basic organizational structure of the Party or the 
Government. 
Evolutionary Prospects 
As has been pointed out, a better standard of liv-
ing for the masses has been sacrificed to capital 
expansion and military strength. The Red Army, 
largest in the world, represents abstractly a counter 
force to the Communist Party. But precaution-
ary measures, undertaken to prevent this eventu-
ality, have been intensified, especially following 
the great purges of 1937 that uncovered treachery, 
imaginary or real, to Stalin. Every military unit 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Approved For Release 20 
nowl includes a political officer and, in addition, 
there are secret informers throughout the ranks 
that watch for any dissidence. Also the security 
forces, under the MVD, have their own elite mili-
tary units designed to deal with insurrection. 
It cannot be emphasized too strongly that those 
are most optimistic who hope for internal reform 
in the Soviet Union which will? change its world 
outlook. Although there may be some guerrilla 
bands, some dissident elements, and undoubtedly 
a host of unhappy citizens, the odds are against 
any upset short of major war and upheaval. Party 
control of all propaganda, education, and social 
activity, even including the Orthodox Church, 
makes the odds very great indeed. 
As has been suggested earlier, we do not have 
just a Soviet problem, one of ambitious State albeit 
with a different philosophy. We have a world 
Communist movement which draws men of many 
races and many classes into a world struggle for 
domination, and which receives strength and suc-
cor from the Soviet homeland. The people of 
some countries have been won over more easily, 
perhaps, because by comparison Soviet domination 
seemed to represent an improved way of life. The 
Communists have also learned to take the legiti-
mate grievance, set up a coalition or popular front, 
and then after infiltration of key posts to unmask 
their complete power and win control of the new 
government. 
Soviet Armed Forces 
The Red Army is the most powerful land force 
in the world. Its strength is usually quoted as 
175 divisions, not including powerful satellite and 
security forces. Increasingly, the heavy arms 
production of the Soviet Union is being reflected 
in higher firepower and more armor and vehicles 
for this army. Amenities for troops are kept at 
a minimum. Under combat conditions they 
largely live off the land, and advance in every kind 
of vehicle, mechanically and animal powered. The 
haphazard aspects of their military behavior are 
not necessarily weaknesses: some are strengths, for 
they are free from the high logistics costs that we 
bear. Their willingness to take casualties makes 
them formidable adversaries. If a minefield 
blocks the way, hostages, labor forces, or their 
own troops simply march through and detonate

WORLD COMMUNISM AND THE U. S. S. R. cunt. luENTIAL 
the mines to allow more combat troops to pass. 
Although large numbers defected or were demoral-
ized in the earlier stages of the German onslaught, 
extreme repressive measures, plus patriotism, plus 
personal indifference to death, created a powerful 
force that swept across Europe. 
The Red Air Force has specialized in tactical 
air support, and has long been known for its good 
quality fighters. The Korean War demonstrated 
that the MIG-15 jet fighter was one of the finest 
interceptors in the world. Creation of a strategic 
air force has been suggested by the copies of 
United States B-29's that have been seen in in-
creasing numbers by foreign observers. This 
development, which probably includes more 
modern types, takes time, but fits logically with 
their presumed atomic capabilities. 
The Red Navy in the past has been largely a 
coastal defense force scattered among the several 
widely separated coasts of the Soviet Union. 
However, it is no mean force, for its submarine 
strength is the greatest in the world, and although 
reports are scanty, the same German technical 
knowledge in this field has been available to them 
as to us. The Soviet Navy's performance is 
largely unknown, since its exploits in World War 
II were limited, but there have been frequently 
reported stories of new surface vessel construc-
tion that reflect Soviet interest in building an ef-
fective fleet. 
A chief difference between these Red forces and 
our own is their use of political officers and also of 
213 
large para-military security forces. Unlike our 
doctrine, every Soviet military unit not only has a 
military commander but a political officer who 
can influence a commander's decision by making 
him accountable to the Party. The political 
officer has additional duties in insuring loyalty 
and in carrying out an intensive indoctrination 
program at all levels. The security forces are so 
organized as virtually to guarantee that the Red 
Army itself cannot rise against the government. 
These security forces also have major responsi-
bilities for guarding the frontiers against any-
thing other than major attack, and also for ad-
ministering the slave labor camps with their 
estimated twenty million victims. 
In summation, the armed forces of the Soviet 
Union and the closely integrated satellite forces 
collectively represent the greatest military power 
in being in the world. They are famous for their 
artillery, their tanks, their rockets, and their 
fighter planes. They are politically oriented to a 
fanatical degree. They are hardened by their 
normal living conditions and by the most rigorous 
training. However, they are not invincible, nor 
is their political training a perfect shield, if the 
record of World War II gives any guide for the 
future. With full recognition of their strengths, 
the naval officer should study them with a view 
toward possible exploitation of their weaknesses, 
both in conventional military warfare and in those 
areas where intelligence can also aid so greatly: 
the economic, the political, and the psychological.

CHAPTER 9 
THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: COLLECTION 
Intelligence as activity is embodied in the steps 
or phases of a perpetual cycle consisting of collec-
tion, processing, and dissemination kept in motion 
and continually reactivated by use on the part of 
strategic planners and operational commanders. 
Any item of collected information becomes intel-
ligence through processing and reaches its poten-
tial consumer through dissemination. 
A cycle which comprises these functions is not 
peculiar to intelligence; the steps are common to 
any activity or industry which produces a finished 
product from raw materials. In the automotive 
industry, for example, the process of manufacture 
begins with the acquisition of raw materials, the 
ores from which the necessary metals are made. 
The metals are then fashioned into the component 
parts of engine, chassis, and body, which are as-
sembled into a finished product, an automobile. 
The next step puts the product in the hands of 
distributors or dealers who sell it to the ultimate 
user, the individual motorist. The phases of such 
an industrial cycle, procurement, manufacture, 
distribution and sales are analogous to those of all 
intelligence activity. First, information must be 
collected; second, this information must be sub-
jected to certain evaluative processes by which it 
becomes intelligence; and third, the intelligence 
must be put in the hands of potential users 
Finally, its use, either in planning or in operations, 
will uncover needs for additional information 
which will reactivate the cycle. 
Let us relate the operation of the intelligence 
cycle to the commander and his mission. In pre-
liminary staff planning, the commander's needs 
and responsibilities in respect to intelligence will 
require answers to the following questions: 
1. Is my information on the enemy and the area 
of operations complete, accurate, and timely? 
2. What collecting agencies or units do I have 
available for filling in the gaps in my infor-
mation? 
3. What is the correct interpretation of this 
information in the light of my mission? 
CONFIDENTIAL 
4. To which of my subordinates or superiors 
will certain items of intelligence be useful? 
In supplying the answers to the commander's 
questions, the supporting duties and functions of 
his intelligence officer are clearly prescribed as 
they relate to the three steps of the cycle, for collec-
tion, processing, and dissemination are indicated. 
The matter of use requires more explanation. 
It has been stated above that use reactivates the 
cycle. Returning to our industrial analogy, we 
find the user, the man who bought the car, in the 
same position as the commander who "bought" the 
intelligence. The owner of the car reports that 
its performance in general is quite satisfactory, 
but that improvement in driving comfort would 
be effected with the addition of foam rubber seat 
cushions. Satisfied owners are essential to sales, 
so the company acts on the complaint by procuring 
additional raw materials, in this case foam rubber, 
and later models of the car have better seat cush-
ions. Thus user experience results in a better 
product. 
Suppost now that the commander in the midst 
of his planning finds that his information on Blue 
Beach may not be completely up-to-date because 
of enemy activity in that particular area. Have 
beach defenses been improved? A collection task 
arises and his question can be answered best by 
amphibious reconnaissance of the beach. The re-
port of the amphibious patrol will then be evalu-
ated and the new intelligence considered in the 
commander's plan. The cycle was reactivated by 
the need for additional information in the plan-
ning stage of the operation. Likewise, the opera-
tion itself will cause the reactivation of the cycle 
when in retrospect it is realized that information 
was incomplete on the range of a certain type of 
mortar used by the enemy. The capabilities of 
this mortar must be reassessed in the light of com-
bat experience: a job for his intelligence officer. 
Again the experience of the user results in a better 
product, which in this case is intelligence of value 
to the commander in making sound military 
decisions.

CONFIDENTIAL 
INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
The steps of the intelligence cycle do not always 
follow in the logical sequence of collection, proc-
essing, and dissemination, although this order is 
normal procedure in the flow of raw information 
from producer to consumer. Circumstances may 
influence the sequence; certain information re-
quires no processing, since it is finished intelligence 
at the time of collection. This would be true in 
the case of a single indisputable fact required by 
a user. Information required by a user can be 
supplied on many occasions from the files of ONI 
without the need for the assignment of an ad-
ditional collection task to a field unit. 
The individual steps in the cycle likewise do 
not represent treatment by different intelligence 
activities at distinctly different times. The same 
activity may be collector, evaluator, and dissemi-
nator of a certain item of information. Collect-
ing agencies themselves normally subject the in-
formation collected to a certain degree of 
processing, and those who determine the final 
interpretation of an item of information are 
often best qualified to determine its potential user. 
The cycle is flexible, therefore, in its application 
to specific subjects and intelligence tasks. 
Collection, processing, and dissemination and 
the work of the intelligence officer in each will be 
discussed more fully in the three chapters which 
follow. 
REQUIREMENTS IN COLLECTION 
Information for intelligence comprises docu-
ments, facts, and observations which throw light 
on any of the varied aspects of a subject under 
study. In form, information may consist of 
written articles or reports, messages, oral presen-
tations or briefings, maps, photographs, graphic 
visual aids, and physical objects. In nature, in-
formation may be general or specific; detailed or 
fragmentary; true or false. Only when this raw 
undigested accumulation of material is subjected 
to the processes leading to final interpretation does 
it become intelligence to be disseminated to ap-
propriate users. 
There are four basic requirements in the collec-
tion of information for intelligence: (1) GUID-
ANCE, the direction of the collection effort by means 
of collection plans at all levels of command; (2) 
COVERAGE, the availability of suitable collecting 
CONFIDENTIAL 
activities to fulfill the tasks imposed by the col-
lection plan; (3) REPORTING, the form and means 
of forwarding information from the collecting 
activity to the processing agency; (4) RECORDING, 
making information readily available for present 
and future processing by proper cataloging, filing, 
and indexing, 
Guidance 
Collection requires specific guidance and control 
to make it efficient and valuable. Collectors must 
know what information is needed, and how soon 
it is needed, in order to expend their efforts effec-
tively. Since collection of information for intel-
ligence is a responsibility of a naval commander, 
it is from him that direction of the collection effort 
must come. The commander's function in this 
respect will be more fully discussed in chapter 12, 
? 
Intelligence Staff Procedures. The guidance of 
collection throughout the naval establishment is 
effected through certain basic requirements set 
forth at the highest command level by the Chief 
of Naval Operations. They are expressed in broad 
terms for the general guidance of all the Navy's 
collecting agencies and activities and constitute a 
basic collection plan from which are derived the 
collection plans of subordinate commands. The 
Director of Naval Intelligence, for example, as 
CNO's Intelligence Officer, bases his collection 
plan upon the requirements listed by CNO, but 
DNI expresses them in much more detail and as-
signs specific collection tasks to the agencies and 
activities which can best obtain the required in-
formation. The field activities, such as the Oper-
ating Forces, the Attache System, and the Naval 
District and River Commands, formulate their 
own collection plans, based in turn on the require-
ments of DNI, but again expressing in detail the 
specific items that can be obtained through the 
exploitation of sources peculiar or particularly 
available to each. Thus the general intelligence 
requirements become more itemized and specific 
as they are incorporated into the collection plans 
of lower echelons of command. Some intelligence 
tasks are long-range and continuing, others are 
initiated by immediate needs. The collector must 
be aware of the purpose, nature, and urgency of 
these tasks, and he must work within the frame-

work of an organized plan in accordance with 
local conditions. 
Collection directives are subject to such periodic 
revision as may be demanded by the world situa-
tion and the needs of the Navy. Emphasis will 
vary, interest will rise and wane, and objectives 
will differ in various parts of the world. Intel-
ligence producing units, such as a geographic desk 
in the Office of Naval Intelligence, should have 
the closest possible contact with the field activity 
which is best qualified to collect the particular 
kind of information required for sound estimates 
or careful planning. The relations between col-
lector and processor should always be as intimate 
as possible. Each report's value should be ap-
praised and the reporting officer notified. Much 
welcome guidance can be given by suggestions 
through personal conferences, official inspections 
at stated intervals, and official evaluations and 
commentaries of field reports. Praise for indus-
trious collection and good reporting are mutually 
rewarding for both collectors and processors. 
Coverage 
Coverage is achieved when the collecting agency, 
through conscientious exploitation of all sources 
of information, fulfils its assigned mission. Thor-
ough coverage depends upon a carefully formu-
lated collection plan, one which completely realizes 
the collecting potential of the area or target in 
question. Through the collection plan, potential 
sources for information of significance are most 
likely to be discovered and exploited; thus, it may 
be possible to anticipate and fulfil requirements 
for particular data. In connection with coverage, 
the utilization of operational collection units will 
be discussed in chapters 12 and 13. 
Collection Agencies 
As was noted in the previous sections on the 
organization of Naval Intelligence, the respon-
sibility for the collection of all types of informa-
tion for intelligence required within the Naval 
establishment rests with the Chief of Naval Op-
erations. Under him, the Director of Naval In-
telligence, as head of the Naval Intelligence organ-
ization, is responsible for the exploitation of all 
sources in the collection of information of naval 
interest, guided by such pertinent policies, pro-
269196-54-15 
217 
cedures, and objectives as are set forth by the 
National Security Council. The broad scope of 
naval interest has been presented in the first chap-
ter, and needs no further elaboration. Any infor-
mation or intelligence that might support the 
Navy in carrying out the missions assigned to it 
or to its component parts, including naval aviation, 
amphibious forces, and the Marine Corps, is con-
sidered to be of naval interest. 
The collecting activities available to the Director 
of Naval Intelligence are (1) the Office of Naval 
Intelligence, the "home office"; (2) the field activ-
ities consisting of the Operating Forces, the Naval 
Attach?ystem, Naval District and River Com-
mands, including Sea Frontiers; and (3) the naval 
sections of intelligence activities sponsored jointly 
by Navy with other military services. 
The Collector, Ashore and Afloat 
Every person in the Navy is a potential collec-
tor of information of value to intelligence. A 
seaman on liberty in foreign or United States 
ports, a lieutenant unexpectedly invited aboard a 
foreign naval vessel, a welder in a naval shipyard, 
or a clerk in the office of a District Intelligence 
Officer, may be in position to supply a missing bit 
of information. Just as the intelligence required 
by staff planners differs from that required by sub-
ordinate commanders only in scope, point of view, 
and level of employment, so do collectors of 
information differ only in the orbit of their move-
ment, their background of education and experi-
ence, and their position in the naval establish-
ment. The collector, like the newspaper reporter, 
is concerned with the five W's and the H: who, 
what, when, where, why, and how, but he is more 
than an inquiring reporter, for he must be city 
editor and editorial writer as well, combining the 
discrimination of a city editor in determining what 
is "fit to print" with the editorial writer's perspec-
tive in interpreting events of the contemporary 
scene. 
In collection activities, the intelligence officer 
must have the personal qualities possessed by the 
successful reporter. It is difficult to give a rela-
tive order of importance to these qualities, for 
their significance will be determined by the aspects 
of the collection task, and they will vary with 
assignments. Answers come from questions, so

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
first of all, the intelligence officer as a collector 
must have an inquiring mind, an insatiable intel-
lectual curiosity about the world in which he lives. 
In order to give direction to these qualities, he 
must have a thorough grasp of the object, nature, 
and scope of the intelligence operations in which 
he is engaged. In this respect intelligence is 
knowledge?knowledge gained by the intelligence 
officer through study and experience. The better 
his background of information is on a given sub-
ject, the more valuable and discriminating will be 
his effort in collecting additional information. He, 
must be thoroughly familiar with his agency's 
existing file of information so that he will not 
waste time in collecting what is already available. 
It is on the gaps of information that he should 
expend time and energy. He must ever be an 
avid student, with a discerning awareness of the 
significance of what he sees, hears, and reads. 
In addition to mental alertness, the intelligence 
officer must have physical energy. He cannot sit 
at a desk and expect information to come to him. 
Collecting normally requires a certain amount of 
"leg-work": things to see and people to interview. 
Here the qualities of initiative, tact, and resource-
fulness are paramount. If a source of information 
dries up, replacement must be found; if efforts in 
one direction are futile, leads must be discovered 
and pursued in other directions with perseverance 
and patience. 
Emotional stability is yet another quality de-
sirable in a good intelligence collector. The busi-
ness of tracking down information may be tedious 
and unexciting; the collector may meet with re-
buffs and closed doors. He must be able to cope 
with these frustrations and devise ways to over-
come them, subduing any momentary pique that 
initial difficulties might engender. Moreover, his 
ability to judge facts objectively must not be 
impaired by personal attitudes. 
Sometimes the collector in the field will receive 
spot requests for information which to him appear 
to be insignificant and purposeless, devoid of back-
ground and meaning. In such cases he must 
comply without questioning the reason for the re-
quest. Normally, the collector will be informed 
of the purpose, but sometimes urgency or com-
munications security will not permit thorough 
briefing, and message requests preclude lengthy 
CONFIDENTIAL 
218 
explanations. To someone in the intelligence 
organization, this bit of information is of vital 
importance, and the collector must seek to obtain 
it with the same zeal he would use in performing 
intelligence tasks which seem to have more 
meaning. 
Intelligence agencies do not wish to stifle indi-
vidual characteristics, for interplay of personali-
ties in an intelligence organization is highly de-
sirable, but the qualifications discussed above are 
basic. Some are innate, others can be acquired. 
It is the collector's responsibility to strive for the 
ideal through self-examination and improvement. 
The Office of Naval Intelligence 
The organizational structure of the Office of 
Naval Intelligence was presented in chapter 2. 
It is the "home office" into which all information 
reports flow and where they are processed and dis-
seminated for use. Here collection programs are 
established which are translated into positive col-
lection guidance for field activities. ONI also 
provides the liaison with other government de-
partments and agencies which insures a full fund 
of knowledge and eliminates duplication of col-
lection efforts. Although ONI fits into the intel-
ligence cycle most appropriately in the processing 
phase, it must not be overlooked that the research 
activity carried on by analysts is in a large sense a 
collection activity as well, for evaluation requires 
the patient gathering of a mass of related 
materials. 
OPERATIONAL COLLECTION OF INTELLIGENCE 
Articles 0504 and 0506 of Navy Regulations 
state that "a commander shall maintain an effec-
tive intelligence organization and keep himself 
informed of the political and military aspects of 
the national and international situation" and that 
CCa commander shall keep his immediate supe-
rior appropriately informed of intelligence in-
formation that may be of value." 
These two articles make each commander re-
sponsible for the collection, processing, and dis-
semination of intelligence within his own com-
mand and the dissemination of intelligence to 
higher echelons. Without good intelligence it 
would be impossible to conduct a successful naval 
operation, unless there was an overwhelming supe-

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE : COLLECTION CONFIDENTIAL 
riority of forces, and even then much time, money, 
and many lives would be wasted unnecessarily. 
The commander must be assured of continuing 
reliable intelligence as to the disposition, strength, 
composition, and movement of enemy forces, as 
well as intelligence on the weather and other 
factors of the area of operations. He must use 
every means at his disposal to gain information 
of the enemy forces opposing him, and of enemy 
forces in other areas, which may affect the prepara-
tion and execution of his plans. A failure to ex-
ploit every source of information may deny 
important information of enemy dispositions, 
movements and operations, and consequently make 
impossible a decisive exploitation of enemy 
weaknesses. 
The difficulties involved in obtaining adequate 
information and in arriving at reliable conclusions 
are many. These difficulties are due principally 
to the enemy's efforts to foil attempts made to gain 
information. In concealing his movements he will 
make use of camouflage, darkness, and weather. 
He will resort to any tactical measures that offer 
a reasonable chance of obtaining secrecy or sur-
prise. He will enforce both strict censorship and 
communication security measures to prevent leaks 
of information. He may distribute false informa-
tion and institute other measures to deceive the 
collecting agencies of the opposition. He will 
sometimes adopt a course of action that may ap-
pear illogical. Thus in planning and operations, 
the designs of the enemy are more or less unknown 
factors. 
Combat operations during wartime constitute 
one of the primary sources of information about 
the enemy. The observations and experience of 
personnel involved, when properly evaluated, are 
immensely valuable in furnishing intelligence con-
cerning enemy strength, disposition, materiel, tac-
tics and capabilities, to say nothing of valuable 
target information and geographical detail. 
Collection by the Fleet 
The Fleet has at its disposal certain units that 
are ideally constituted to provide the means of 
collecting certain types of information. It is im-
possible to list them in order of importance, for 
in certain conditions and at a particular time each 
may be of prime importance in a vital collection 
219 
task. The discussion here will be of a more gen-
eral nature, since details of such employment of 
operational units will be presented in chapter 13 
against a background of certain naval operations 
of World War II. 
Collection by Surface Vessels 
In both peace and war the surface vessels of 
the Navy are collectors of intelligence. Most na-
tions send their vessels on cruises in peacetime, not 
only for training personnel and testing equipment, 
but also to collect a great variety of intelligence. 
Reports can be made on such subjects as weather 
observations, channel soundings, sonar conditions, 
port and harbor installations, radio and radar 
transmissions, and many items of political, eco-
nomic, and sociological interest. It will also be 
possible to enhance the value of these reports with 
appropriate photographs. Collection by ship's 
personnel underway or in foreign ports requires 
vision in guidance and diligence on the part of 
the collectors. 
In actual war conditions, the emphasis in col-
lection may shift to more current information of 
a tactical nature for which there is immediate 
need. There will always be gaps in our basic 
encyclopedic intelligence which must be filled as 
opportunity presents itself. For example, naval 
operations in World War II took place in parts of 
the world far from the beaten track, and the oper-
ating forces not only had to find the enemy and 
observe the weather, but also had to take many 
soundings and do other jobs that unfortunately 
had not been done before the war. Even so, op-
erations could not be wholly successful without the 
encyclopedic type of information as a frame of 
reference within which to study current enemy 
behavior. 
One of the tasks performed by surface vessels 
in collection is hydrographic survey. This infor-
mation is needed by the Hydrographic Office to 
revise and improve the navigation charts used by 
merchant and naval ships alike. In many parts 
of the world navigation charts date back into the 
last century, and only the most obvious corrections 
have been made since. Subsequently, islands have 
been found to be mislocated and soundings in-
adequate over reefs and other obstructions. There 
are geological changes, sometimes of great vio-
lence, that require resurvey.

INTELLIGENCE FOR 
In World War II, existing charts were found 
to be so inadequate that additional survey ships 
were commissioned and given elaborate photo-
graphic and printing equipment to prepare new 
charts in the field for direct dissemination to the 
operating forces. The nature of hydrographic 
needs has changed with naval warfare itself, put-
ting new demands on collectors. For example, 
amphibious intelligence poses information require-
ments in surf and swell conditions, tides and cur-
rents. Successful submarine operations require 
not only data on depths and currents, but also on 
temperature and salinity. 
Electronic Reconnaissance 
The appearance of radar in World War II and 
the subsequent advancement in the development of 
electronic devices have provided our fleets and 
forces with a new and important capability in the 
collection of information by means of electronic 
reconnaissance. Much of this capability rests with 
communications intelligence which will be dis-
cussed in a later section, but reconnaissance by des-
ignated ships and aircraft of the Fleet, within 
range of enemy radar or radio installations, pro-
vides a means for the collection of data concerning 
their identification and location, as well as trans-
mission frequencies, characteristics, and employ-
ment. 
The devices and techniques of such collection 
require technical explanations beyond the scope of, 
this volume. Obviously, this is a job for elec-
tronics experts, but the intelligence officer who 
finds himself associated with electronic collection 
activities can be of great assistance in on the spot 
guidance and preliminary interpretation of the 
collection effort. In an age when science and 
technology are constantly changing concepts of 
warfare, electronics represents a field of which the 
intelligence officer can ill afford to be ignorant. 
Collection by Submarines 
Submarines are especially suited for collection 
of information through reconnaissance because 
they can remain concealed and unsupported for 
long periods in enemy waters. Thus they can 
reconnoiter successfully and return safely and 
secretly in situations where other collection agen-
cies could either not obtain the desired information 
CONFIDENTIAL 
220 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
at all, or could only do so at great cost and with 
the risk of giving the enemy an indication of 
intentions. 
One limitation of the submarine in reconnais-
sance work is the necessity of relatively deep water. 
In order to remain submerged, and therefore con-
cealed, the submarine must confine its movements 
to waters of ten or preferably twenty fathoms. 
Close approach to the area to be reconnoitered may 
thus be limited by bottom topography. In plan-
ning any submarine reconnaissance, the depth of 
water must be given special consideration. 
Submarines are capable of several different 
types of reconnaissance: 
1. Periscope reconnaissance. 
( a) Visual. Best results are obtained from 
the shortest possible range. Binocular viewing 
by two or more observers at a time is recom-
mended; for this purpose, an auxiliary viewer 
may be used, which projects the periscope field 
on a ground-glass screen. It is also advisable to 
use a voice recorder at the time of observations, 
and to make sketches of significant details. 
(b) Photographic. Makes a complete record 
of observations; allows photo-interpretation if 
a photo-reconnaissance strip can be made. All 
major amphibious operations in the Pacific dur-
ing World War II were preceded by submarine 
photographic reconnaissance. 
2. Radar or radio reconnaissance. Obtains in-
formation of the locations and characteristics of 
enemy transmitters on shore, ships or aircraft. 
Special search receivers and associated equipment 
are required. The intelligence officer should brief 
submarine personnel in advance on the known loca-
tions and characteristics of all enemy transmitters 
in the reconnaissance area. 
3. Sonar reconnaissance. 
(a) Listening. With the use of special equip-
ment, this type of reconnaissance can provide 
sonar information, similar to that of radar and 
radio. It not only contributes to scientific and 
technical intelligence, but may be of value in 
future undersea operations against the enemy. 
(b) Echo-ranging. Obtains information of 
the locations of minefields and other underwater 
obstacles. Special sonar equipment is required. 
The intelligence officer should provide charts of 
known or suspected mines and other obstacles

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: COLLECTION CONFIDENTIAL 
and should recommend search tracks, course 
lines, and radar contact points. Minefield re-
connaissance by submarine is hazardous, and re-
quires a high degree of training. 
4. Meteorological reconnaissance. With spe-
cialized personnel and equipment, submarines can 
gather weather data in enemy waters. They may, 
for example, remain on station for long periods as 
mobile weather stations. 
5. Hydrographie reconnaissance. Submarines 
are excellent collectors of data on thermal gradi-
ents and landmarks such as fixes, profiles, and 
orientation points. They are also able to deter-
mine current and tide conditions and verify depths 
through soundings. 
Periscope photography, discussed above, is par-
ticularly promising as a reconnaissance technique. 
Its chief advantage is that it supplies a complete 
and permanent record, which in certain cases lends 
itself admirably to photo-interpretation. 
The subjects of periscope observation, both vis-
ual and photographic, are mainly enemy shipping, 
harbors, coastal areas, and beaches. Periscope 
photography of such subjects is preferable to aerial 
photography, especially for the production of am-
phibious intelligence. It often reveals areas and 
details, such as profiles and orientation points, not 
normally obtained from aerial views. It is able 
to penetrate camouflage, which is usually designed 
to give protection from aerial observation. The 
side view which it affords is better for certain 
purposes than a vertical view, for example, in 
determining the gradient of a beach. Further-
more, certain objects notably offshore obstacles, 
boat lanes, beach exits, and natural or man-made 
means of cover and concealment, are more readily 
and plainly visible to submarines than from the 
air. Periscope photography can also be useful for 
verifying the results of aerial photography. 
A disadvantage of individual periscope photo-
graphs is their narrow angle of view?only eight 
degrees at high power, which is generally used. 
Because of the scale desired?not less than 1: 5000, 
preferably 1: 2500?the range cannot exceed a 
mile or two with certain types of cameras. For 
various reasons, including bottom topography, so 
close an approach is not always possible. Cameras 
of greater focal length would of course permit 
221 
photographs of suitable scale to be taken at longer 
range. 
In spite of these disadvantages, individual peri-
scope photographs can provide information of 
great intelligence value. Those of the following 
types present data of particular intelligence value: 
1. Broadside shots of naval and merchant ships, 
including the ship's entire length, supple-
mented by close-ups showing the names, num-
bers, and unusual features. In wartime, pre-
attack and post-attack photographs of enemy 
shipping are useful for damage assessment 
and verification of sinkings. 
2. Port and harbor facilities, such as docks, 
cranes, warehouses, and shipways. 
3. Landmarks and orientation points. 
By taking a series of overlapping photographs, 
a submarine can make a so.-called "strip" or "pano-
rama". If the true bearing of the periscope is 
changed between photographs, the result is a 
sweep panorama, which cannot be used for photo-
interpretation but can be grouped to make com-
posites for general information. Sweep pano-
ramas can be taken in a short time, in areas of 
limited sea-room, and without much preparation. 
Thus they are often used, especially for coverage 
of harbors, coastal areas and beaches, when condi-
tions are not favorable for stereo-photography. 
Photo-reconnaissance strips, also called "under-
way panoramas", are made by taking a series of 
overlapping photographs (the extent of overlap 
being approximately 60 percent), with the peri-
scope trained to the same true bearing while the 
submarine holds a constant course. Objects ap-
pearing in two successive photographs can be 
viewed and interpreted in stereo. 
This is the most useful type of submarine pho-
tography for intelligence purposes. However, it 
requires planning and preparation, takes time 
( which may expose the submarine to discovery by 
the enemy) , and requires sufficient sea-room for 
the submarine to follow a continuous track while 
making photographs. 
Amphibious Patrols

or it becomes necessary to confirm and amplify 
information received from other sources, amphib-
ious patrons can be employed to gather hydro-

FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
graphic data, report meteorological conditions, ex-
amine beaches and terrain, locate enemy installa-
tions, determine enemy strength, capture enemy 
prisoners, and make demonstrations to effect de-
ceptions. As a general rule, amphibious patrols 
confine their activities to the covert acquisition of 
information and fight only in self-defense. 
Amphibious patrol personnel must be specially 
selected and trained to do their job in all types of 
terrain, such as mountain, jungle, and arctic. The 
elements and principles of scouting and patrolling 
must be sufficiently instilled in them to become 
instinctive. The aggressive type of action in-
volved, combined with the strain of maintaining a 
high degree of security, necessitates exceptional 
physical condition and agility. All individuals 
must have confidence in their ability to handle 
themselves with ease in water. 
Additional training is required in the technique 
of entering hostile territory from the sea, in rec-
ognizing unusual characteristics of terrain and 
hydrography, and in special communications 
methods and procedures. All patrol personnel 
must be able to handle small boats on the sea at 
night and to estimate such factors as current, wind, 
speed, and direction without difficulty. Accurate 
recognition, sketching, map and aerial photograph 
reading, and the ability to write objective factual 
reports are also essential in the successful opera-
tions of an amphibious patrol. 
Underwater Demolition Teams 
During World War II one of the most useful 
sources of information in the hours just prior to 
amphibious landings was the result of the labors 
of the underwater demolition teams (UDT's). In 
early Pacific operations they proved their effective-
ness in carrying out their assigned mission of beach 
clearance and they were able to operate success-
fully even in daylight provided there was adequate 
fire support. 
After the Marianas operation, when an intel-
ligence section was added to the staff of ComUDTs-
Pac, the mission of the UDTs was enlarged to 
include reconnaissance as well as demolition. Two 
intelligence officers were assigned by ComPhibPac 
to the staff of ComUDTsPac and close liaison was 
established. This activity expanded considerably 
as operations grew larger and more complex, and 
CONFIDENTIAL 
by the end of the war, several intelligence officers 
were on duty with ComUDTsPac. All were given 
special instructions to prepare them for UDT in-
telligence work, and some were assigned to teams 
for specific operations. 
UDTs can obtain detailed beach information on 
topography, soils and trafficability, location and 
nature of obstacles, hydrographic data, location 
and type of mines in beach approaches, the nature 
of the shore line, defenses, visible exits, and prom-
inent landmarks along the beaches that can be used 
for guiding in landing craft. If the teams are 
launched in rubber boats from submarines at night, 
they may be able to obtain considerable hydro-
graphic data without disclosing their presence. If 
launched from submarine or surface vessels in day-
light, fire support may be necessary. 
Reconnoitering enemy shores, along with demo-
lition of underwater obstacles, are important con-
tributions of the Navy's underwater demolition 
teams, and the success of any amphibious opera-
tion may well hinge upon them. 
222 
THE NAVAL ATTACHE SYSTEM 
Naval officers on duty in foreign posts provide 
a large part of the information needed by the Navy 
for planning purposes in war and peace. There-
fore it is desirable to deal in some detail with the 
organization and function of the Naval Attach?
system. 
The paramount duty of Naval Attaches is that 
of intelligence collection, in the performance of 
which they are an integral part of Naval Intel-
ligence and are under the cognizance of the Direc-
tor of Naval Intelligence. At the same time, they 
are under the military command of the minister 
or ambassador who heads the diplomatic mission 
to which they are assigned. Although the attache 
is not recognized under the law as a Foreign Serv-
ice Officer, he carries a diplomatic passport and 
has diplomatic immunity. Thus, he is a member 
of the official staff of the diplomatic mission of the 
United States in the country to which that mission 
is accredited and is the direct representative of 
the Navy Department in that mission. 
The naval attache in general defers to the wishes 
of the ambassador or minister. Normally the 
chief of the mission will not be concerned with 
the attach? reports of classified technical and

THE INTEL 
tactical naval information, particularly if they are 
of no international political significance. The 
attach? reports are forwarded directly to CNO 
(DNI) , and if desired, copies are furnished to 
the chief of mission. 
The controlling factor in the assignment of at-
taches is the procurement of information of in-
terest to the Navy Department. The assignment, 
as assistant attaches, of officers who have special-
ized in various technical or professional subjects 
is usually limited to those stations which oiler 
special opportunities to procure technical infor-
mation. Consultation with the State Department 
in the assignment of attaches is limited, in general, 
to assuring that the officer selected for the post is 
persona grata to the State Department, which then 
takes the necessary steps to ascertain that the selec-
tion is acceptable to the country to which the 
diplomatic mission is accredited. When attaches 
and assistant attaches are accredited to more than 
one country, only countries whose mutual political 
relationships are good are included in the same 
group. 
The number and stations of naval attaches vary 
according to current requirements. In the cap-
itals of major powers, such as London and Paris, 
a large complement is usually maintained, while 
in Latin America, a single attache may be accred-
ited to several adjoining countries. Primary re-
sponsibility is usually the country of the attach? 
residence; he will have secondary responsibilities 
as required by naval interest or the current 
situation. 
The duties of the naval attache may be described 
only in general terms, for the methods and tech-
niques to be followed depend almost entirely on 
the good judgment and tactful discretion of the 
attache himself. The opportunities and situations 
which confront an attache vary so greatly in dif-
ferent parts of the world that uniform procedures 
cannot be prescribed. He must be constantly on 
the alert for every kind of information of possible 
naval interest, using all his imagination, ingenuity, 
and resourcefulness to uncover it and all his knowl-
edge of the country and of general naval subjects 
to interpret it. He cannot neglect an item simply 
because he has not received a specific request for it 
and has no labeled folder for it in his file. 
Naval attaches deal directly with the Admiralty 
or Ministry of Marine, and, where the military, 
naval, and air departments are combined, with the 
Ministry of Defense. Official dealings with any 
other ministry must be conducted through the chief 
of the diplomatic mission to which the attache is 
assigned. Ordinarily, naval matters will be re-
ferred to the attache by the chief of mission. 
The attache can expect little official information 
from a government on the real spirit which per-
vades its Navy, its concepts of strategy and tactics, 
the extent and results of maneuvers, the charac-
teristics of its naval commanders, or the efficiency 
of personnel and materiel. This information can 
be obtained only through intimate personal and 
social relationships with foreign nationals, par-
ticularly foreign naval and army officers. 
Outside the Iron Curtain, the attache often has 
many semi and unofficial sources of information 
available to him. They include the naval and air 
departments to which he has official access; visits 
to ships, dockyards, and port installations; wit-
nessing maneuvers and demonstrations as an offi-
cial guest; association with industrialists, politi-
cians, and the man in the street; the press, official 
publications, correspondents, and our own State 
Department officers. The attaches of other gov-
ernments accredited to the same country are like-
wise valuable sources of information, and the 
naval attache is at liberty to discuss with them 
matters of interest which he has discovered for 
himself. He should not, however, discuss or ex-
change information which has been given to him 
directly by the government to which he is 
accredited. 
The attache can often save himself much time 
and effort if he is aware of the collection activities 
of other United States government agencies. Con-
sular reports, for example, contain carefully com-
piled data concerning shipping which clears for 
United States ports. Regular consular officers, 
commercial and agricultural attaches, and trade 
commissioners assigned to missions can provide 
well-documented information of importance to the 
naval attache. However, when such information 
is reported by the naval attache, the source should 
be carefully identified in order to avoid problems 
which arise from duplicate reporting.

Private American commercial interests abroad 
are always well supplied with material of value, 
particularly with regard to the movements and 
transfers of vessels, and unusual developments in 
the field in which they specialize. Representatives 
of such interest are to be found in nearly every 
major port in the world, and often have extensive 
and intimate knowledge of local conditions. In 
connection with their work, they observe and re-
port on the activity of competing firms, both 
American and foreign, keep in touch with current 
political and economic trends, and maintain close 
and amicable relationships with official govern-
ment sources. The naval attache can profit from 
cordial relations with them. Although the report-
ing of economic intelligence is the primary mission 
of other United States intelligence agencies, much 
information of naval interest has its source in com-
mercial and economic affairs. 
A word of caution is necessary regarding direct 
requests made by an attache to foreign govern-
ments for specific information. By custom, such 
a request carries with it the implication that cor-
responding data of our own will be given in ex-
change. The Office of Naval Intelligence, there-
fore, definitely prefers to acquire information on 
an unofficial basis, unless it specifically authorizes 
a direct official request. The same rules apply 
when the attache requests permission to attend, or 
accepts invitations to witness, confidential trials 
and experiments. It is quite likely that the gov-
ernment to which the attach?s accredited will 
expect reciprocal privileges in return. The at-
tache should know, and advise the officials of the 
foreign power, what the attitude of the United 
States is with regard to the exchange of informa-
tion or the extension of reciprocal privileges. 
The collection activities of Naval Intelligence 
abroad are overt in nature. The attache must 
never jeopardize his position as a member of a 
diplomatic mission by indiscreet activities which 
may bring discredit upon himself, the embassy or 
legation, or the reputation of his fellow country-
men resident abroad. Discretion is the key to 
success. The creation of good will should always 
be his aim. A sincere effort to become proficient 
in the language of the country, and constant study 
of the nature and customs of the people will do 
much to win loyal friends and expand the social 
CONFIDENTIAL 
224 
and professional circles in which he moves. If he 
is fortunate enough to have his family with him, 
he will be able to participate in community life 
to an even greater degree. A good attache works 
at his job with unfailing courtesy, tolerance, and 
cooperation. He can reflect great credit upon the 
United States Navy, leave a lasting impression of 
admiration and respect, and make the work of his 
successor easier. 
Covert Collection 
The demands of security naturally give a covert 
flavor to intelligence collection, but by far the 
greater part of information can be obtained openly 
by the thorough exploitation of available sources. 
In other words, an intelligence officer rarely has 
to depend on people who put a price on what they 
know. Few such sources are very valuable, and 
the disadvantages of their use and the risks in-
volved are great. The shadow world of the pro-
fessional informer is beset with pitfalls for the 
novice, and dealing with mercenary characters 
even on the fringe is a dangerous practice for 
anyone who desires to maintain a persona grata 
status in a foreign country. Covert collection, 
therefore, is not within the province of officers 
assigned to attache billets. 
NAVAL DISTRICTS AND RIVER COMMANDS 
Under the District Commandant, the District 
Intelligence Officer (DIO) is responsible for the 
collection of such information as is required for 
the security of naval activities within the District, 
as well as that which is needed by the Commander 
of the Sea Frontier in which the District is located. 
The DIO's collection tasks, therefore, are prima-
rily concerned with counterintelligence problems 
involving the security of the Naval Establishment 
and the National Security, and with operational 
intelligence in support of the sea Frontier Com-
mander. However, in consonance with existing 
directives and agreements among the various in-
telligence agencies, the district intelligence organi-
zation engages in some exploitation of selected 
sources of intelligence. 
The collection of intelligence by Sea Frontiers 
in wartime is largely of an operational character. 
Operational needs frequently cut across arbitrary 
district lines extended out to sea, thus making the

plots and logs kept by the Sea Frontier vital to 
effective action. 
JOINT INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES 
Collection activities can often be most efficiently 
carried out by the closely coordinated effort of a 
collection team composed of representatives of all 
the armed services. The Joint Intelligence Col-
lection Agencies (JICA) groups which operated 
in overseas theaters during World War II were 
designed for this purpose. As noted in chapter 3, 
naval officers also serve with the intelligence com-
mittees and groups of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
where they have unusual opportunities for collec-
tion guidance. The coordination of intelligence 
reporting by service attach6s is exemplified in the 
Joint Weeka reports from State Department mis-
sions all over the world which contain brief sum-
maries on matters of interest to many government 
agencies. 
OTHER SOURCES AND METHODS OF COLLECTION 
The foregoing activities in the collecting of in-
formation are directly guided and controlled by 
the Navy's intelligence organization. They by 
no means comprise all sources available to the 
Navy. Data collected by other government de-
partments or agencies is often valuable for the 
Navy as well. The resourceful intelligence officer 
has sources well-nigh inexhaustible. They await 
his exploitation. 
The courses, methods, and techniques of the col-
lection of information are as varied as the subjects, 
operating areas, and personal qualifications of the 
collectors. It is impossible to describe them all, 
but a few have been selected for special discussion 
as illustrative of basic principles applicable in the 
work of the intelligence officer as researcher, psy-
chologist, and technician. Information gained 
from enemy personnel, documents, and materiel 
can be of special value because of its potential 
qualities of accuracy and timeliness. These cap-
tured sources are, of course, normally available 
only in time of war. 
Prisoners of War 
In a tactical situation, prisoner of war inter-
rogation, better described perhaps as "examina-
tion," has as its purpose the obtaining of informa-
269196-54-16 
225 
tion of immediate value which enemy personnel 
may have. The advantages of such information 
are conditioned by the nature of the theater of 
operations, the availability of other sources, and 
the skill with which it is developed and exploited. 
The essential activities involved in the exploita-
tion of prisoners of war as sources of information 
are: capture, screening, conditioning, and interro-
gating. The preliminary evaluation and dissem-
ination of this information by the interrogator are, 
of course, necessary. 
The capture of enemy personnel is a function of 
combat forces whose personnel must be carefully 
persuaded it is to their advantage to capture 
prisoners and keep them alive. Specific instruc-
tions for handling prisoners should include: pre-
vention of cruelty, prevention of excessive kind-
ness, and prevention of unauthorized contact with 
higher ranking prisoners of war; their expeditious 
transport to designated interrogation specialists, 
with adequate advance notice; and the simultane-
ous delivery of personal papers and effects, which 
are to be taken immediately from prisoners, clearly 
marked as to original ownership. Any plan for 
the procurement of prisoners should be prescribed 
by the careful indoctrination of operational units 
and advance planning for the handling of captured 
enemy personnel. 
In screening, each prisoner of war is given a 
preliminary examination in order to determine 
whether he is likely to have any useful informa-
tion, how readily he may yield it, and which agency 
is most appropriate for his further processing. 
The selection of the appropriate agency is gov-
erned by the nature of the information possessed 
and the military service to which the prisoner be-
longs. The screening officer should, in general, 
avoid any discussion of subjects which are not of 
immediate tactical interest. When it appears that 
a prisoner may have information of more strategic 
value, special arrangements for handling are made. 
The activities of conditioning and interrogating 
are complementary and often carried on simultane-
ously. The prisoner must not be permitted to 
become too contented with his status and he should 
remain fully aware, by subtle suggestion, that any 
favors he receives come solely from the interroga-
tor. At all times, the normal military rank re-
lationship should be maintained between the pris-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
oner and his captors. So-called "third-degree" 
methods are not only forbidden by international 
agreement but also are ineffective and often result 
in a complete failure of the interrogating process. 
Interrogation is the function of trained spe-
cialists whose primary objective is to ascertain 
whether or not the prisoner actually possesses in-
formation of value and, if he does, to obtain it. 
Interrogation is an excellent means of corroborat-
ing information received from other sources. For 
many prisoners, a short interrogation is sufficient. 
The interrogating process has several prerequi-
sites. There should be no conversation with the 
prisoner either before or between interrogations, 
except in accordance with the pre-determined 
plans of the interrogator. A secluded place is 
essential, with no audience present. No effort 
should be made to interfere with the work of the 
interrogator: he alone is best qualified to determine 
what the prisoner knows, how it may be obtained, 
and when to stop. The interrogator must be fully 
informed of all collateral information relevant to 
the prisoner and the information he is believed to 
have. The interrogator should promptly receive 
any new facts or data which may assist in the 
acquiring of the needed information. He should 
also be advised of the relative importance of items 
of required information and any changes in their 
importance. In this manner, his efforts may be 
better concentrated. Demonstrated confidence in 
the interrogator and his work can increase his ef-
fectiveness in dealing with prisoners. 
The interrogator's preliminary evaluation of in-
formation provided by the prisoner of war is al-
most always inevitable and exceedingly helpful. 
The very nature of interrogation involves some 
determination of the correctness and accuracy of 
the information gained. In addition, personal 
impressions and reactions gained by the interroga-
tor in his associations with a prisoner are of con-
siderable value to subsequent processors of the 
information. Prior to disseminating his informa-
tion, the interrogator should be satisfied that he 
has correctly understood the prisoner's statement 
and that this statement is as accurate and complete 
as he can get. In transmitting information, the 
interrogator should include, in addition to the 
information itself, an estimate of the extent of the 
prisoner's knowledge, a statement of the facility 
CONFIDENTIAL 
226 
with which it was obtained, and notification of 
availability for evacuation. 
The ideal interrogator is both a linguist and an 
intelligence officer, since his activity is basically 
an intelligence function. Not only must he have 
a fluent knowledge of the prisoner's language, he 
must also be familiar both with the customs and 
background of the enemy and with the intelligence 
requirements of his own command. In an opera-
tional situation, especially during early stages of 
hostilities, this combination of attributes is always 
not readily obtainable. As a result, intelligence 
officers may be required to work closely with lin-
guists in developing information from prisoners 
of war. The objective may well be to train a 
linguist to be an interrogator, in order that he 
may carry on his activities in a more independent 
manner. However, even when this becomes pos-
sible, there must be the closest coordination of 
efforts and interests, and the interrogator must be 
guided at all times by knowledge of what infor-
mation is most urgently needed and its significance 
to the command. No attempt should ever be made 
to obtain information through an interrogator 
without his complete understanding of the nature, 
scope, and significance of the information desired. 
On his part, the interrogator must cooperate fully 
with the intelligence officer and endeavor to fur-
nish obtained information in a form which can 
be most readily used. 
Documents 
When examined systematically by competent 
personnel, captured documents reveal information 
about an enemy. An enemy document may be any 
form of recorded information regarding enemy 
forces or areas. Enemy documents are both per-
sonal, found on prisoners or enemy dead, and 
official. 
As sources of information, enemy documents 
have one unique feature?they are prepared by the 
enemy for his own information and guidance and 
are, therefore, just as clear, concise, and accurate 
as he can make them. He does not intend that we 
will ever see them. In effect, then, when we get 
an enemy document, the enemy voluntarily tells 
us all he knows about a particular subject; he will 
tell it again and again in the same way as often as 
we wish to study the subject. Information from

CLE : COLLECTION CONFIDENTIAL 
documents is more authentic and reliable than 
that from prisoners of war because it is less biased 
and less representative of personal opinion. 
During World War II documents were cata-
logued, examined, and handled so as to disclose 
maximum information of obvious and immediate 
significance to the command and to its subordinate 
forces for use in combat operations at hand. Fur-
ther processing by rear echelons produced intel-
ligence valuable to all commands engaged in 
planning future operations. 
Collection by Examination of Materiel 
All types of enemy equipment are studied on 
the battlefield as well as behind the lines by tech-
nical intelligence personnel?cannons, tanks, mor-
tars, mines, radios, and so forth. The Navy raises 
sunken submarines, and refloats beached landing 
craft. Such ground and naval equipment some-
times may be repaired to test against our own, and 
thus determine its performance characteristics. 
The components may be examined for clues as to 
assembly techniques, quality of alloys, and short-
ages of materials. During World War II, German 
Tiger tanks were brought to the United States to 
race against our own tanks and to test-fire their 
guns; Soviet T34's from Korea have likewise been 
evaluated. 
Air Technical Intelligence is chosen for discus-
sion here as typical of the broader field. Technical 
and scientific intelligence dealing with new weap-
ons is covered in chapter 14. A favorite story of 
Air Technical Intelligence concerns the loss of an 
experimental Vickers Wellesley British bomber 
while on trials prior to World War II. Appar-
ently German Intelligence wanted this plane badly 
enough to risk war, for it was shot down by a 
German submarine off the British coast and sal-
vaged for later study in Germany. The British 
chose an extraordinary way to let the Germans 
know that the fate of the plane had been dis-
covered. They made a motion picture based on the 
incident called "Clouds Over Europe" and released 
it for showing on the continent. 
The primary mission of Air Technical Intel-
ligence is the collection of information about 
actual, potential, or possible enemy aircraft and 
related equipment. Information at first may con-
sist of crude sketches or inferior photographs of 
227 
new planes, or reports of aircraft or components 
from escapees. All of this data is then related 
to known design trends of the aircraft of that 
particular foreign country. Eventually the time 
may come when actual components, or even a 
whole aircraft, are salvaged on the ground for 
analysis in detail. The uses of such information 
are both strategic and tactical. New and better 
performance may mean a new strategic situation 
in many parts of the world. Detailed analysis 
of turning ability, speed at different altitudes, 
vulnerability to damage, and weapons employed, 
may require modification of United States tactics. 
Improved foreign capabilities require counter-
action by the United States armed forces both in 
long range plans and immediate steps. 
We made constant efforts in World War II to 
keep abreast of technical developments in Japanese 
and German aircraft. In the early days of the 
war, the Japanese Zero and Zeke fighters proved 
to be maneuverable and dangerous, although they 
lacked protective armor. Readers of Recognition 
magazine during the war will recall the publica-
tion first of provisional silhouettes and tentative 
performance data, then subsequent revisions as 
reports improved, and finally views of captured 
and rebuilt planes with American markings, under 
test at Wright-Patterson Field. Through adroit 
collection, we often had photographs of proto-
types considerably in advance of the time that 
operational models appeared in quantity. Ger-
man jets, both turbine and rocket, near the end of 
the war represented extremely significant develop-
ments due to their high speed, and consequently 
they were a prime technical intelligence target. 
Chapter 14 describes our interest in the Peene-
miinde guided missiles center in Germany. 
We lost aircraft to the enemy as well, and one 
of the stranger episodes of the war was what hap-
pened to the American B-29's that had been forced 
to land in Soviet territory. The fact that the 
Soviets could copy those "interned" aircraft and 
produce the type in quantity for a strategic air 
force was a good indication of the level of their 
technical intelligence and engineering achieve-
ment. 
Long-range development of an air force re-
quires consideration of many technical features

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
abroad. For example, our strategic bombers must 
not only have the range and carrying power we 
decide are necessary, but must be designed to cope 
with enemy interceptors, guided missiles, and anti-
aircraft guns during the expected operational 
life of the planes. These questions of enemy de-
fenses require detailed answers. For example, 
with regard to enemy interceptors, their future 
performance, armament, and armor must be esti-
mated by extrapolating trends from the present. 
Performance includes service ceiling, rate of climb, 
combat radius, ability to turn, to dive, and so forth. 
Sometimes direct evidence on all of these matters 
is not available. However, it is possible to obtain 
much information of an indirect nature, but none-
theless useful. For example, a report of no 
boosters on flight controls of a particular plane 
implies some lack of maneuverability at speeds 
near Mach one, and also consequent added pilot 
fatigue from battling the controls. On the other 
hand, lack of such equipment might also mean 
simpler maintenance and greater availability. 
PHOTOGRAPHIC INTELLIGENCE 
The purpose of the following discussion is to 
introduce naval officers to the field of photographic 
intelligence, and to point out some of its inherent 
capabilities, limitations, and techniques. Efficient 
staff planning and operational estimates require 
close cooperation between photo-interpreters and 
intelligence officers, and each should be cognizant 
of mutually supporting collection services. 
Photographic interpretation has been defined as 
the examination of photographic images of objects 
for the purpose of identifying the objects and de-
ducing their significance. Photographic intelli-
gence is the evaluated and analyzed information 
obtained through photographic interpretation. 
History and Development 
The United States Navy's photographic intelli-
gence organization received its initial stimulus and 
help from the British, who, upon being pushed 
off the European continent and largely separated 
from ordinary information and intelligence chan-
nels, had hurriedly improvised a system of extract-
ing desired military information from factual evi-
dence contained in photographs taken over enemy-
held territory. 'While photographic intelligence 
CONFIDENTIAL 
had been used by both sides with some effect dur-
ing World War I, it had in the interval before 
World War TI become a lost technique. Despite 
the improvisation, the British soon achieved re-
sults that were spectacularly successful, and Amer-
ican observers were sent to England to study the 
techniques of the new system. Their enthusiastic 
reports caused the Chief of Naval Operations, in 
September 1941, to recommend the establishment 
of the Photographic Interpretation School. Per-
haps the greatest initial stumbling block for the 
School was the inability to anticipate requirements 
in the new field. There were no established billets 
for the graduates of the School, and many com-
manders were inexperienced both in the employ-
ment of photo-interpreters and in recognizing the 
capabilities and limitations of photographic inter-
pretation. As the value of photographic intelli-
gence was realized and more photo-interpreters 
became available, photographic interpretation 
units were formed, either as a part of a photo 
group or intelligence center assigned to an area 
commander. By the end of World War II, grad-
uates of the Photographic Interpretation School 
were operating in all theaters of war, contributing 
significantly to all operations. 
Today the center of photographic interpretation 
activity for the Navy is the United States Naval 
Photographic Interpretation Center which func-
tions under the Bureau of Aeronautics. This Cen-
ter prepares photographic interpretation reports 
and studies for the Office of Naval Intelligence and 
for the Fleet, performs research and development 
work in the fields of photographic interpretation 
and photogrammetry, and trains photographic in-
terpreters. Its activities include the preparation 
and maintenance of reference manuals, and other 
documents, the preparation of terrain models, and 
the maintenance of a library of photographic in-
terpretation material and other pertinent data. 
Capabilities of Photographic Intelligence 
The extraction of useful intelligence from pho-
tographs is not a simple matter. The photo-
graphic interpreter must first know the conditions 
under which a photograph was taken. This in-
formation is normally recorded on aerial photo-
graphs, and includes the focal length of the cam-
era, altitude of the plane, exposure and run

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: COLLECTION 
number, mission number, organization number, 
date, time and zone, place, and classification. Gen-
erally, the first print of a flight shows the basic 
information which concerns the whole flight, and 
each subsequent photograph shows only informa-
tion to identify the individual print within the 
flight. A photo-interpreter should know the capa-
bilities of each type of aerial camera, as well as 
the type of photograph from which he can obtain 
the information desired. For this reason the pho-
tographic interpreter should be directly involved 
in preflight planning of an aerial reconnaissance 
mission. 
Photographs as a source of information possess 
many advantages when compared to other intelli-
gence sources. Some of the more important ad-
vantages are as follows: 
1. Aerial photography can be used to collect in-
formation over areas inaccessible to ground 
observers. 
2. The photograph represents an accurate per-
manent record, instantaneously made, of all 
the detail within the field of view of the 
camera. 
3. The photograph is a means of transmitting 
an unbiased, first-hand impression to the ex-
pert most qualified to interpret it, although 
he may be many miles from the scene. 
4. The photograph can be studied with earlier 
and later coverage of the same area to pro-
duce comparative intelligence. 
5. Accurate dimensions of objects may be de-
termined from photographs. 
6. As a rule, photographs need not be evaluated 
as to course and reliability, but only as to 
content and significance. 
Other advantages of aerial photographs are 
comprehensive coverage, made possible through 
the use of modern equipment and techniques, and 
the ability to provide current and timely informa-
tion. Under certain conditions, it is possible to 
determine ship speeds, surf conditions, water 
depths, the nature of beach obstacles, and to make 
industrial analyses. Water depths, surf condi-
tions, and beach obstacles are particularly impor-
tant during the planning of amphibious operations. 
Another important use of aerial photographs is 
in the construction or correction of charts, maps, 
and terrain models. Aerial mapping makes it 
229 
CONFIDENTIAL 
possible to produce accurate maps in a minimum 
length of time. 
Aerial photography as a source of intelligence 
has a number of limitations which should be 
clearly understood. Some of these are: 
1. Effective aerial photographic coverage can-
not normally be accomplished during periods 
of bad flying weather. It is also limited by 
the ranges of photographic aircraft, the pres-
ence of ground mist, or cloud cover, and avail-
able light conditions. 
2. Since an aerial photograph represents con-
ditions at one particular instant of time, sub-
sequent photos of the same area must be 
obtained for analysis of significant changes. 
This is particularly important in considering 
enemy build-ups of equipment and personnel, 
increase in defensive positions, and air 
capabilities. 
3. The aerial photographic interpreter cannot 
always see the fine details of a target. For 
example, while the size, extent, and height of 
a wall may be determined from the photo-
graph much more accurately than from 
ground reconnaissance, the information as to 
whether its stones are loose or mortared must 
usually rest with the ground observer. How-
ever, detail, such as grain size of beach sand, 
may sometimes be inferred from features visi-
ble in aerial photos. 
4. The observations of the photographic inter-
preter are necessarily limited to areas shown 
on the photograph. It is quite possible that 
an item most important from an intelligence 
standpoint may occur just off the edge of 
available photo cover or under a patch of 
cloud. 
Teamwork of the Intelligence Officer and the 
Photographic Interpreter 
The Intelligence Officer and the Photographic 
Interpreter have mutually supporting contribu-
tions to make in the production of intelligence. 
While their relationships will vary from station 
to station, a few general principles can be estab-
lished. For any target or area of intelligence 
interest, there usually exists a body of background 
intelligence, from many sources, such as docu-
ments, maps, and charts. Photographic intelli-

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
gence can often confirm or deny the accuracy of 
such data or can amplify it whenever it relates to 
the physical nature of items viewed on the aerial 
photography. It may help to confirm the relia-
bility of the source from which a report comes. 
In addition to providing verification, the aerial 
photographs can serve as a base on which various 
ground observation reports can be plotted and re-
lated to each other. Generally speaking, the photo 
interpreter will be able to provide precise loca-
tional data and state with reasonable assurance the 
presence or absence of specific features and their 
dimensions. He can also relate widely separated 
features beyond the view of any single ground 
observer. On the other hand, ground observation 
reports can provide much more detailed data for 
the immediate area in question. 
Just as the photographic interpreter can par-
ticipate in the evaluation of information from 
other sources, so the intelligence officer can often 
aid in the analysis of data derived from aerial 
photography. Frequently, because of his greater 
familiarity with all of the available intelligence 
regarding an area, the intelligence officer may have 
a more complete grasp of the significance of data 
derived from aerial photography as it affects 
existing intelligence and relates to other informa-
tion. Further, data from other sources, as com-
piled and evaluated by the intelligence officer, 
may provide the photographic interpreter with 
clues which will lead him to a more complete 
analysis of the photos. By working together as 
a team, the intelligence officer and the photo-
graphic interpreter represent a combination of 
great value in intelligence activity. 
Types of Aerial Photographs 
Many kinds of photographs are used by the 
photo-interpreter in assembling intelligence data, 
including aerial verticals, obliques, composites, 
continuous strip, gun camera, and ground. Each 
has a specific usefulness in fulfilling the intelli-
gence needs of various strategic and tactical or-
ganizations. In addition to recommending vari-
ous types of cameras and photographic techniques, 
the photo-interpreter advises as to the use of spe-
cial film and filter combinations under varying 
altitudes and light conditions. For instance, in-
frared film records unusual qualities of colors. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
230 
Vegetation registers a light tone in sharp contrast 
to non-infrared reflective objects, such as water, 
roads, and buildings, that record dark on the print. 
This aids in the detection of artificial camouflage 
in areas of vegetation. 
Verticals 
Vertical photographs are the most valuable for 
general use lby the intelligence officer. They are 
taken with the optical axis of the camera in a 
vertical or in a near-vertical position. The scale 
of the photograph is equal to the quotient of focal 
length (in inches) over the altitude of the aircraft 
above the ground (in inches). It is apparent 
that the desired scale may be obtained by changing 
the focal length of the camera used or the alti-
tude at which the pictures are taken. Errors of 
scale and azimuth resulting from tip and tilt, vari-
ation in relief, and optical distortions are inherent 
in vertical photographs; however, these errors are 
relatively small and can be compensated when 
necessary. 
Obliques 
Oblique aerial photographs are obtained by in-
tentionally tilting the optical axis of the camera 
from the vertical. A high-oblique aerial photo-
graph includes the horizon; a low-oblique does not. 
Oblique photographs are of value to photo-inter-
preters for such details as gun emplacements, 
camouflage positions, and underwater and beach 
obstacles. Annotated obliques are used effectively 
in briefing pilots and coxswains in order to ap-
proximate the views of the beach and inland land-
marks as realistically as possible. 
Simulated oblique photographs may be obtained 
by photographing terrain models and relief maps 
from various directions and heights. 
Composites 
An aerial photograph made with one camera 
directed vertically, and two or more cameras 
mounted on an angle from horizontal, is a com-
posite. Trimetrogon photography, a form of 
composite, has one camera directed vertically 
downward and two cameras mounted at an angle 
of 300 from horizontal and perpendicular to the 
line of flight. All cameras are operated simulta-
neously, so that the area from horizon to horizon,

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE : COLLECTION CONFIDENTIAL 
perpendicular to the line of flight, is covered by 
three photographs. 
Composite photographs are used principally for 
mapping large areas on small scale. Less ground 
control is required and the flight lines need not 
be flown as accurately as when a single lens is 
used. This will be more fully discussed later. 
The distance between flight lines can be much 
greater with trimetrogon photography, since a 
greater area is covered with each click of the 
shutter. 
Continuous Strip Photography 
Continuous strip cameras photograph a contin-
uous strip of terrain by allowing the negative to 
move continuously over a fixed slit at the focal 
plane of the camera. The film speed is adjusted 
to the height and speed of the aircraft. The Sonne 
continuous strip camera has been modified to per-
mit stereo coverage by using two lenses and parti-
tioning the camera cone so that two strips are 
photographed side by side on the 914-inch nega-
tive. Parallax effects are obtained by causing the 
lens assembly to be rotated on a horizontal plane 
so that one lens is in advance of the other. Con-
tinuous strip photography is usually taken ver-
tically although successful obliques have been 
taken. 
Continuous strip photography is especially 
adapted to low altitude (approximately 200 feet) 
and high speed flying (300 up to 1,000 miles per 
hour) and permits an accurate determination of 
height and depth. It is well suited for detailed 
beach work; the scale (1 : 400 to 1:1,000) is such 
that all visible forms of minor defenses may be 
located and accurate data on gradient, spot depths, 
and heights may be calculated. Strip photogra-
phy has the great advantage of "freezing" the 
surface of water areas, so that the bottom may be 
seen stereoscopically while the sea remains trans-
parent. Photographic interpreters, with special-
ized training, have obtained remarkable results 
with strip photography in depth determination 
studies. 
Gun Camera Photographs 
Gun camera photos are? widely used to record 
hits in aerial gunnery. In such employment they 
have also often proved valuable in recording new 
231 
types of aircraft, ground equipment, modifications 
in structure or design of aircraft, and other similar 
information which is extremely useful to air in-
telligence officers as well as to photographic in-
terpreters. Satisfactory measurements cannot 
normally be made on gun cameras' photos. In-
terpreters use them qualitatively where possible 
for new leads and as supplementary aids in iden-
tification of enemy equipment. 
Ground Photographs 
Ground photos are commonly used by the photo-
graphic interpreter as supplementary aids in most 
types of interpretation. Where photos have been 
captured or derived in other ways, important use 
for them is found in identifying or analyzing 
structures and evaluating local terrain. Ground 
photos taken by our own forces after occupation 
of enemy territory are commonly used in compara-
tive studies. Ground shots, when set side by side 
with vertical stereopairs, offer valuable cross-
references and materially increase the chances of 
recognizing similar installations observed else-
where on aerial photographs. Following the oc-
cupation of Japan, Kiska, Attu, and other Pacific 
Islands, comparative studies were made by Navy 
photographic interpreters and other members of 
the United States Strategic Bombing Survey 
Teams with the air or ground photographs and 
measurements of important installations. 
Stereoscopy 
One of the greatest benefits of photographic in-
terpretation is derived from stereoscopic analysis 
of aerial photographs. Stereoscopy may be de-
fined as "The science which deals with three dimen-
sional effects and the methods by which these 
effects are produced." In the case of photography, 
three dimensional affect, or stereo-vision, is ob-
tained by viewing two pictures of the same object 
or area taken from different points, the photo-
graphs being so oriented that each eye views a 
different picture. Aerial photographs for stereo-
vision are obtained by making successive overlap-
ping exposures. The overlapping parts of the 
prints may be viewed stereoscopically; two such 
prints are called a stereopair. Terrain features 
and objects which indicate vertical delineation 
appear in exaggerated relief when viewed stereo-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
scopically. This enables the photo-interpreter to 
detect camouflage, to note details of terrain, to 
identify and study the characteristics of aircraft, 
ships, and military installations, and finally, to 
determine the results of military action through 
damage assessment. 
A stereopair is any two photographs or dia-
grams showing a common field or view, which have 
been taken, or represent a perspective, at approxi-
mately the same distance from the field but from 
slightly different positions. To see photographs 
stereoscopically they must be placed in the same 
relative positions as when they were taken. Any 
pair of overlapping vertical photographs taken at 
approximately the same elevation, and with the 
same focal length camera, can be viewed stereo-
scopically if arranged properly. Duplicate photo-
graphs cannot be viewed stereoscopically, since the 
objects on the photographs must have been viewed 
by the camera from different angles. 
Vectographs and Anaglyphs 
A vectograph is a print or slide in which the 
two images of the stereopair are superimposed 
with slight offset, and each image transmits light, 
polarized in a plane perpendicular to that of the 
other. The print or projection must be viewed 
with polarized glasses so that the plane of polar-
ization in each corresponds to that of the image 
each eye is required to see. 
Vectographs are difficult to prepare, hence their 
use in presentation of information is limited. 
Once prepared, however, they constitute a rapid 
means of presenting aerial photographs in three 
dimensions to persons unaccustomed to using a 
stereoscope or to a group of persons simultane-
ously. This is useful during planning in familiar-
izing staff officers with an unknown area and in 
briefing pilots, coxswains, and subordinate com-
manders in the field. A vectograph eliminates 
the need for stereopairs and stereoscopes in brief-
ing sessions. 
The polarized light principle can also be used 
whenever appropriate equipment is available, by 
projecting positive transparencies of a stereopair 
through a twin-barrel projector. The beams of 
projected light are polarized by passing through 
properly oriented polaroid plates, and the result-
CONFIDENTIAL 
232 
ant composite image on the screen is used with 
polaroid glasses. 
Anaglyphs in similar fashion present a 3-dimen-
sional effect by overprinting 2 films, 1 red, the 
other blue. When viewed with special glasses or 
cellophane eyepieces, also 1 red and 1 blue, the 
resulting image appears to be 3 dimensional. 
Flight Lines and Indices 
A flight line is a course laid out on a map to be 
followed by a plane. Principal and alternate 
flight lines should be prepared whenever possible 
for each photographic mission. The final plan-
ning of the flight lines and the method of execution 
of the mission is the responsibility of the photo-
graphic squadron commander. Photographic in-
terpreters are trained to perform flight planning 
for photo reconnaissance missions in conjunction 
with the squadron commander. Intelligence offi-
cers should also understand this important process, 
since it effects the quality and quantity of aerial 
photographic coverage. 
There are many factors to be considered in flight 
planning, details of which may be found in such 
specialized publications as the Photographic In-
terpretation Handbook and NTVP W. 
Whenever possible the locations of photos are 
plotted on a map or overlay before photographic 
interpretation. The usual procedure is to use an 
adjustable plastic template, included in the photo-
graphic interpreter's kit, which can be set to a 
size which represents the area covered by a photo-
graph on the map or chart used as a base. By 
inspecting photo detail, a series of rectangles are 
drawn on the map, chart, or overlay to show the 
coverage of each photograph in the sortie. 
When a sortie plot has not been made, the 
"pilot's trace" a rough plot of the flight line fol-
lowed by the plane, is often valuable as an aid in 
locating the photographs. Detailed discussion of 
plotting techniques will also be found in the refer-
ence manuals cited above. 
Sometimes all photos taken on a given mission 
are taped down hastily without trimming to form 
a very rough mosaic which is then photographed. 
This is called a photo index. In this case, photo-
graphs are usually laid so that the sortie and the 
number of each photograph can be easily read 
from the resultant mosaic.

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: COLLECTION CONFIDENTIAL 
Scale Determination 
Scale may be defined as the relation between the 
distance on the photograph and the actual distance 
on the ground. As in map reading, scale may be 
expressed as a representative fraction (1: 10,000 
where 1 inch on the photo equals 10,000 inches on 
ground), words, and figures (3 inches equal 1 
mile) , or by means of a graphic scale. The scale 
of an aerial photograph can be determined in the 
following ways: (1) Focal length and lens height; 
(2) by comparison with a map; (3) by comparison 
with the ground. The formulas and procedures 
used in each method are described in detail in the 
Photographic Interpreter's Handbook. 
Mosaics 
A mosaic is an assembly of several aerial pho-
tographs into one composite picture. There are 
two general types of mosaics, controlled and un-
controlled. 
Controlled mosaics are prepared by adjusting 
vertical aerial photographs to the plotted posi-
tions of ground control points. Ground control 
points are the result of earlier surveys or are es-
tablished by one of several methods from controls 
already in existence. These ground control 
points are identified on photographs and plotted 
on a mounting board to the desired scale of the 
final mosaic. The photographs to be used are then 
enlarged or reduced to this scale by means of pre-
cise rectifying projectors which are also adjusted 
to correct as much as possible for the existing tip 
and tilt in the photographs. When these control 
points on the photographs are placed directly over 
the corresponding points on the mounting board, 
the photographs are in true relation to each other. 
The controlled mosaic is accurate enough in scale 
and direction for most practical purposes. An 
annotated controlled mosaic may be useful as a 
replacement for maps of an area. 
Uncontrolled mosaics include all of those not 
prepared to the rather rigid specifications indi-
cated above. The simplest form of uncontrolled 
mosaic is that produced by merely putting photo-
graphs together by matching detail along their 
borders. More carefully prepared uncontrolled 
mosaics are cut and fitted to get the best match of 
detail, using only the center section of each photo-
graph. Sometimes a measure of control is intro-
233 
duced by plotting in advance certain widely spaced 
control points and making an attempt to meet this 
control by stretching and adjusting the photo-
graphs. Uncontrolled mosaics give a good pic-
torial representation of the ground and may be 
used for rough measurements. However, they 
will contain distortion and errors in scale. Un-
controlled mosaics cannot usually be gridded for 
military purposes. 
A special type of uncontrolled mosaic is the 
"strip mosaic" which consists of a single run of 
aerial photographs matched and mounted to show 
the flight path. 
Terrain Models and Relief Maps 
Terrain models and relief maps are three-di-
mensional representations of a portion of the 
earth's surface in miniature. Terrain models re-
fer to plaster, rubber, or papier mache topographic 
models, which show relief but do not show detailed 
map information. Relief maps, on the other hand, 
are basically maps which show relief in third di-
mension. The primary purpose of three-dimen-
sional terrain models and relief maps is the visual 
presentation of available information on terrain 
in a simple and easily understood form. Terrain 
models and relief maps afford military personnel 
an opportunity for prolonged and intensive study 
from any height or direction thereby permitting 
the observer to recognize terrain and beach fea-
tures more readily. 
During World War II, plaster and rubber ter-
rain models were prepared for almost all major 
offensive operations, some being made in limited 
quantities in forward areas, others being produced 
in small quantities in this country and flown to 
task forces prior to the assault. There were six 
general categories of models according to their 
use: strategic planning, tactical planning, assault 
landing, assault, airborne landing, and aerial 
target. The scale of the models, of course, varies 
with the extent of the area depicted and the needs 
of the users. 
The demand for topographic models frequently 
exceeded production capacity, since laborious pro-
cedures were employed and most finishing opera-
tions were accomplished by tedious handwork. 
Furthermore, the quality of early models was gen-
erally poor, because basic map information was

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
inaccurate or incomplete and in many instances 
model production equipment did not permit ac-
curate editing. Model media also left much to 
be desired. Plaster and papier macho were com-
monly used in forward areas throughout most of 
the war. Sponge-rubber models were not devel-
oped until 1944 and these had to be hand-painted 
and could only be manufactured succesfully in rear 
echelon locations. 
The elimination of hand painting was first made 
possible through the development of plastic re-
lief maps, a process invented by John J. Braund 
of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. 
This technique made use of normal printing proc-
esses to print standard flat map information onto 
thermoplastic sheets for subsequent forming by 
heat and vacuum into a negative mold. The 
Braund Process marked the first major step to-
ward quantity reproduction of models and, with 
certain refinements and modifications, it is the 
most advanced today. 
In Korea, plastic relief maps were effectively 
used for operational planning, briefing and as a 
map supplement for all commands. (For detailed 
information concerning the construction of plastic 
relief maps and plastic photomaps refer to Army 
Map Service Bulletin No. 29, dated April 1950). 
COMMUNICATIONS INTELLIGENCE 
Just as photographic intelligence represents the 
operations of collection, processing, and dissem-
ination in a technical field, the steps of the intelli-
gence cycle are similarly applicable to the 
operations of communications intelligence. It too, 
is a cycle within a cycle. 
Only the most cursory treatment of communi-
cations intelligence can be given here, for though 
it is known that major powers engage in this 
activity, information as to how much or how little 
our country learns through these methods and the 
exact details of how we do our work might involve 
a serious breach of security. There are, however, 
several techniques that are generally in use and 
which can be described. These are grouped under 
cryptanalysis and traffic analysis. 
Cryptanalysis 
Cryptanalysis refers to the breaking of the 
ciphers or codes used by other countries. A cipher 
CONFIDENTIAL 234 
is a rearrangement and/or a substitution of in-
dividual letters in a message. A code uses special 
words or numbers to represent other words or even 
whole sentences. Ciphers are frequently prepared 
by machines and translated back into clear lan-
guage by the same means. 
American accomplishments in cryptanalysis 
during World War I were made public knowledge 
in 1931 in a book by Herbert 0. Yardley, The 
American Black Chamber. During World War 
I, Yardley was the head of the MI-8 in the War 
Department, which was composed of five subsec-
tions; code and cipher compilation, communica-
tions, shorthand, secret ink laboratory, and code 
? and cipher solution. He soon found out that all 
the great powers had well established bureaus of a 
similar nature staffed by competent professionals. 
Successes in this field certainly rank far above the 
exploits of Mata Hari for effectiveness if not for 
romantic interest. Fletcher Pratt in his book 
Secret and Urgent describes several notable cryp-
tographic triumphs during World War I. 
The German cruiser, Magdeburg, raiding along 
the Russian coast one night early in the war, ran 
hard aground in a fog. When the mists cleared 
the following morning, the Russian Fleet was 
standing toward the helpless vessel. In this emer-
gency the commander of the Magdeburg ordered 
one of his officers to take the code books in a small 
boat as far from the stranded ship as possible and 
throw them into deep water. In the resultant con-
fusion the officer was pitched over the side by a 
large swell, faithfully clutching the lead-bound 
code books in his arms. A Russian order for de-
cent burial of all German dead was rewarded with 
one of the most important finds of the war, for a 
dredge drew up the officer's body with the code 
books still in his arms. The books were promptly 
forwarded to London where they provided the 
solution for all German naval codes. 
This discovery had most important effects on 
the German naval effort and the course of the war. 
German raiding forces were intercepted and de-
stroyed, and traps set by the German Navy for 
British forces boomeranged. In the Battle of Jut-
land the German Fleet escaped annihilation only 
because the British Admiralty was unable to con-
tact Admiral Jellicoe due to excess volume of radio 
traffic.

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: COLLECTION CONFIDENTIAL 
Another notable British cipher coup began by 
chance aboard a small monitor in the Mediter-
ranean. It had been noted that the German radio 
station at Nauen followed its regular evening 
broadcast of the daily communique with a series 
of signals sent so rapidly that separate sounds 
could not even be distinguished. It resembled 
static more than anything else. Allied code offi-
cers had reached the conclusion that these signals 
were merely a method of testing the apparatus. 
One very hot and quiet day wardroom officers 
aboard the British monitor ran out of musical se-
lections for their portable phonograph. They de-
cided to play a record of Nauen's lightning gib-
berish for amusement. The officer who put the 
record on forgot to rewind the phonograph, and 
as the instrument slowed to a stop, the high-
pitched screech became a rational series of code 
groups. They were a series of messages from the 
German High Command to General Von Lettow-
Vorbeck, commanding in German East Africa, and 
most interesting of all they were in an old German 
Army cipher which the British had long held. In 
East Africa the Germans had been unable to ob-
tain the new cipher, so messages to them were con-
cealed by transmission at 5 or 6 times normal speed. 
As Fletcher Pratt points out, the Germans were 
not without their own intelligence successes in 
World War I. They are credited with working a 
resounding military hoax on the Russians in the 
Black Sea as a sequel to their success in solving 
Russian naval ciphers. The German cruisers, 
Goben and Breslau, based at Constantinople, 
waited until the Russian Black Sea fleet put to 
sea, then slipped in between the Russians and their 
base. In naval code, as though coming from home, 
they wirelessed orders to the Russian admiral to 
proceed with all speed to Trebizond at the far 
eastern end of the Black Sea. When the duped 
Russians returned from their fruitless chase, they 
found that the two lone German ships had raided 
their shore establishments and broken up their 
coastal merchant shipping. 
Yardley's book describes the great effectiveness 
of our cryptanalysis in reading Japanese messages 
at the time of the Washington armament confer-
ence. His office turned out over 5,000 decipher-
ments and translations during those meetings. 
Some writers believe that the Japanese denounce-
ment of the naval treaties was directly linked with 
Yardley's disclosures years later. 
How and to what extent any American agency 
reentered cryptanalysis after Yardley's work was 
discontinued in 1929, has not been disclosed. The 
public knows that something was done prior to 
Pearl Harbor because of the references made on 
4 November 1945, by Representative Gearhart 
(Congressional Record, November 6, 1945, pp. 
10606-11). On 15 November 1945, came the full 
disclosure to the joint congressional committee of 
some 700 messages dating back to 2 December 
1940. One of the most controversial features of 
the Pearl Harbor investigation involved the pur-
ported "winds messages" which were said to con-
tain the signals for war. 
These references to cryptanalysis, though brief, 
should suggest the sensitive nature of the subject 
and the need for the intelligence officer wherever 
stationed to be aware of the implications of activ-
ities which concern codes and ciphers. 
235 
Traffic Analysis 
Traffic analysis is a second major type of activity 
related to communications that does not even re-
quire chyptanalysis to be useful, although code 
breaking eases this work. It requires a knowledge 
of how messages are put together, how they are 
routed, and what kinds of organizations use radio 
communications. The task is to reconstruct the 
radio networks of the enemy, and to determine the 
features of their operations. It includes the solu-
tion of call sign and routing systems, analysis of 
the components of message externals, interpreta-
tion of radio procedure, and the use of the various 
cryptographic systems passed; that is, everything 
about communications except the cryptanalysis it-
self, although the two activities are mutually 
supporting. 
When traffic analysis is systematically devel-
oped, it may be possible to learn the call signals 
of enemy stations, the frequencies and times of 
transmissions, the physical location of stations, 
routing codes, and so forth. From this informa-
tion a principal end product is order of battle data. 
Radio networks have definite and detailed patterns 
that give clues to the organizations they serve. 
They may include individual links between two 
points, groups working as an entity under a single

control, or nets with common operating character-
istics and overall direction. Stations may use a 
single frequency or a range to fit atmospheric 
conditions. They may switch for security reasons 
or when regular frequencies have been jammed. 
Call signs may be fixed or be changed on some sec-
ret basis. Times of transmission may also be 
varied on some irregular, secret basis. 
Clues to messages and operations may come from 
procedure signals and miscellaneous chatter among 
operators. Such chatter may give information on 
cryptographic systems used. Japanese stations in 
World War II received advance notice of some of 
our carrier strikes when our pilots turned on trans-
mitters to test them prior to take off. Occasion-
ally, due to unusual atmospheric conditions, mes-
sages on frequencies not intended to go very far 
are bounced great distances and received by enemy 
ears. Sometimes encrypted messages are refused 
by an addressee, and the same message is repeated 
under another system giving many important 
leads. Messages have certain externals that can 
convey much valuable information. These may 
include serial numbers, group counts, date time 
markings, routing to action and information ad-
dresses, and precedence indicators. 
The location of transmitters, if not otherwise 
known, may be determined by direction finding, 
using several receivers and triangulation. Re-
constructing a net may come from the call signals, 
the schedules, the frequencies, the routings and 
routines, the cryptographic system used, the chat-
ter and names of operators. The information 
obtained is plotted in diagramatic form and in 
tables until meaningful patterns emerge. 
Volume of traffic and direction of flow may in-
dicate what stations represent higher headquarters 
or certain command relationships. Changes in 
volume of messages may show that military opera-
tions are underway or about to begin. For exam-
ple, it appears that before the Pearl Harbor attack, 
important Japanese fleet units kept radio silence, 
an immediate clue that they did not want their 
activities identified. Since changes in volume of 
traffic can disclose so much, nearly all countries 
now pad their traffic to maintain an even volume 
and hide this kind of vital information. Dummy 
nets may continue to operate to hide the moves of 
real forces under radio silence. Consequently the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
236 
intelligence officer must always be on guard lest the 
obvious not be the real. 
Thus it is apparent that the value of traffic 
analysis is great, for it not only can be a source 
of much information to us, but also points out the 
need for protective measures to insure our own 
communications security. 
REPORTING 
Thus far in our discussion of collection we have 
described guidance, the direction of the collection 
effort, and coverage, the fulfillment of missions by 
collecting agencies or units. Now we come to 
reporting, the means by which information reaches 
its consumer. Without prompt and accurate re-
porting a collection effort is without value. 
Graphically, the reporting by an intelligence 
officer can be re presented thus: 
See 
HearEvaluate Report 
In writing 
Organize 
Read  Orally 
We have here in essence a reporting cycle which 
embraces all phases of the Intelligence Cycle: 
collection through the eye and ear; processing by 
a preliminary interpretation of the information 
and its organization into logical presentation; and 
dissemination through the act of reporting, either 
written or oral. The intelligence officer must 
therefore be able to present the information col-
lected in the manner that will best serve the user. 
Words, written or spoken, are weapons to be used 
with skill. 
Written Reports 
Written reports can be classified into three types: 
(1) periodic, those required at regular intervals or 
on designated dates on a continuing basis; (2) 
spot, those made in reply to a specific request; and 
(3) voluntary, those submitted through the collec-
tor's initiative. 
Typical of periodic reports is the joint 
WEEKA, prepared at virtually all United States 
foreign posts by the representatives of the Depart-
ments of State, Army, Navy, and Air Force. It is 
an analysis of the significant local events of the 
week under review. The naval attach?s prima-
rily responsible for items of naval interest which 
are briefly presented with appropriate comment.

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: COLLECTION CONFIDENTIAL 
The intelligence officers of many operational 
commands prepare succinct summaries of items of 
interest for periodic dissemination to all units 
within that command. The items may be evalua-
tions or interpretations of current events or merely 
accurate information to correct ill-founded 
scuttle-butt. 
Spot reports are direct answers to specific ques-
tions. What is the depth of water alongside Pier 
5 in Atlantis Harbor? What are the political 
sympathies of Admiral Ivanovitch ? Has the re-
pair of the damaged crane in the Gesundheit Ship-
yard been completed? Specific requests usually 
have a "due date" and replies by messages are often 
requested. 
Voluntary reports should make up the bulk of 
a collector's reporting. We have shown in previ-
ous chapters the broad scope of subjects of naval 
interest. An alert collector's reporting respon-
sibilities never cease, and conscientious effort in 
insuring completeness of information will often 
eliminate the necessity for specific requests to sup-
ply the missing data. 
Form and Speed 
The primary considerations in the reporting of 
information are form and speed. The Navy has 
adopted a standard information report form which 
insures completeness and provides uniformity for 
rapid and efficient processing. The nature and 
urgency of the information will determine in what 
form it should be forwarded and the means to be 
used. Particularly vital information should be 
submitted by telecommunications, while matters 
of less immediate concern are forwarded by mail 
in accordance with security regulations affecting 
their transmission. Lacking specific directives, 
the intelligence officer must use his best judgment. 
Report Writing 
The ABC's of good report writing are accuracy, 
brevity, and clarity. Precision in the use of words 
is essential for accuracy. To write: The vehicle 
went into the water would be a most inaccurate 
description if the true circumstance was: The jeep 
slid into the Danube. Brevity is perhaps the most 
difficult to achieve, for it is always a problem to 
decide what is essential or nonessential for the 
237 
consumer's needs. However, one should not write: 
"The be-ribboned sea-dog mounted the gangway 
of the famous fighting ship and partook of a noon-
day repast together with the efficient officers who 
control the intricate operations of this modern 
masterpiece of naval engineering" when the sit-
uation can be simply described by: "Admiral 
Burke lunched with the ship's officers on board 
the Forrestal." 
Clarity is achieved by a simple, direct writing 
style, and a logical organization of report content. 
The standard Navy information report format 
consists of: (1) a succinct summary of the infor-
mation; (2) the main body of the report; (3) the 
comments of the originator. 
A summary or brief is required for all reports 
of more than one page. Normally, it should not 
be longer than a few sentences or one-fourth page. 
Its purpose is to enable all who read it to determine 
its significance at first glance. Therefore it should 
be more than a mere outline of the paragraph titles 
of the report. It should contain the main facts, 
a succinct epitome or abstract of the report's con-
tents. Thus a carefully written brief serves as a 
timesaver for those who initiate the processing 
of the report's information. It is an essential aid 
to proper dissemination, for its potential users will 
be clearly indicated. 
The main body of the report should be presented 
with section or paragraph titles and subtitles. The 
material should be factual and the writer must 
strive for complete objectivity. Here again brev-
ity is desirable but never at the expense of neces-
sary detail. 
At the close of the report, on a separate page, 
the reporting officer should present his personal 
comments. It may sometimes be advisable to elabo-
rate on the reliability of the source or to submit a 
brief discussion of the pertinence of certain facts as 
seen by the collector in the field. Such comment 
will be most helpful to subsequent evaluators of 
the information. Here the reporting officer can be 
subjective and editorialize to his heart's content. 
However, he should still be concise. Often the 
forwarding officer in a chain of command will also 
desire to add comment. 
We can summarize our discussion of reporting 
by setting forth a few guiding principles: 
Each report should be on a single subject.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Give careful attention to the introductory sum-
mary. 
Organize facts and figures in logical sequence. 
Photographs, sketches, and appropriate graphics 
will always save words and enhance the value 
of the report. 
Be objective in the main body; be subjective in 
comment. 
Never include questions or requests. Such mat-
ters are subjects for separate letters. 
Edit the report before submission; reread, reor-
ganize, rewrite. 
Make every report represent a best effort. 
Oral Reporting 
Intelligence officers in operational billets will be 
frequently called upon for oral presentations or 
briefings to commanders, staffs, and personnel of 
operating units. The effectiveness of such brief-
ings depends on the officer's ability as a speaker 
and his ingenuity in the use of visual aids. Care-
ful organization is again the key to success. A 
good briefing has an adequate introduction, smooth 
transition in moving from point to point, and a 
clear, forceful conclusion. Naturalness of de-
livery, unity, coherence, and emphasis will achieve 
the desired result. Ability will come with prac-
tice, and the intelligence officer should constantly 
strive for self-improvement in this important 
function. 
Observation and Reporting in the Field 
The intelligence officer serving as an attach?r 
in other billets abroad will frequently be in posi-
tion to observe things of inestimable value. The 
full significance of many observations will, of 
course, be apparent only to the highly trained 
technician. A good intelligence officer must be 
quick to realize his own observation and reporting 
shortcomings in technical fields and request ex-
pert assistance whenever possible. There are, 
however, certain fields in which he must acquire 
observation techniques in the interests of accurate 
reporting. We shall discuss two of them here: 
ships and aircraft, both of which are of prime in-
telligence significance all over the world. 
Reporting on Merchant Ships 
Although thousands of merchant ships ply the 
oceans, far outnumbering naval vessels, the aver-
CONFIDENTIAL 
238 
age naval officer is seldom equipped to recognize, 
identify, and accurately describe them. Yet their 
recognition is of key importance not only in dis-
tinguishing between friend and foe but also in ac-
curate assessment of the enemy's logistic capa-
bility. 
Typical among current merchant ships recogni-
tion manuals is CINCPAC RIG-1, which is an 
outgrowth of JMST used in World War II. Now 
out of print though still frequently available is 
ONI 209. Very useful, too, is Talbot-Booth's 
Merchant Ships annual. 
Recognition is of two types. The first is a gen-
eral overall impression, used primarily in quick 
operational identification. The second is a more 
detailed analysis, feature by feature, made possible 
only by opportunity for prolonged observation. 
The latter is the most desirable, since ships present 
a great variety of characteristics and are therefore 
hard to identify quickly. 
There are several stages of ship recognition. As 
ships come over the horizon, their sequence of 
masts, kingposts, cranes, and funnels can be noted 
from bow to stern. Next can be noted the general 
hull form, whether flush-deck or in various com-
binations with and without raised forecastle, 
bridge, and poop sections. At medium range more 
detail can be noted: the shape of the bow and 
stern, the funnel size and shape, position of masts 
and kingposts, and often clues to length and ton-
nage. At close range the length of forecastle, 
bridge, and poop can be ascertained and also the 
position of deckhouses, winchhouses, ventilating 
cowls, lifeboats, and many other details. The par-
ticulars of Navy merchant ship coding, largely 
adapted from Talbot-Booth, are covered in official 
manuals. 
How is the size of a ship to be judged? Apart 
from checking in a reference manual, there is no 
absolute measure, for visual impressions are af-
fected by the color of sky, the kind of weather, and 
the altitude of the observer. However, an estima-
tion of length may be possible from the number of 
lifeboats or the ratio of length to the height of 
the navigation bridge above the waterline. 
Whether the ship is light or laden will possibly 
influence identification of the shape of bow and 
stern. Speed estimates are also important. They 
depend upon a knowledge of the shapes and posi-

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: COLLECTION uu  
tions of waves made by different kinds of bows 
and familiarity with varieties of ships' wakes. 
The kind and continuity of smoke will give clues 
to the type of fuel burned by a ship. Mistakes 
are easy to make. A three-island ship may look 
like a flush decker if the well decks are loaded 
with lumber, and masts may be lowered on some 
ships so that they look like kingposts. 
An estimate of the age of a ship will often 
provide important clues to performance and iden-
tification. Age is frequently revealed by such 
characteristics as shape of bow, stern, superstruc-
ture, and funnels, and ratios of length to other 
dimensions, the amount of superstructure that is 
glass enclosed, the type of ventilation, and the 
type of lifeboat davits. 
In peacetime, an aid for identification is the 
coloring of such features as the hull, superstruc-
ture, booting, stripes, masts and kingposts, cowls 
inside and out, and, of course, the funnel and house 
flag. In wartime the task is more difficult not 
only because of gray and dazzle paint, but because 
of deck cargo, armament, false work of canvas and 
sheet metal, and removal of dummy funnels. 
In recent years there has been one development 
that simplified recognition of types but not of 
ownership: the building of ships to standard pat-
terns. In World War I the Hog Islander was 
typical of freighters designed for mass production 
to meet wartime needs. The President liners, both 
535's and 502's, were cargo-passenger ships of 
standard design. In the late 1930's the United 
States Maritime Commission began a new program 
of permanent standardized types to bring our 
merchant fleet out of the doldrums, beginning with 
the Cl, C2, C3 cargo types. At the outset of 
World War II the British began an emergency 
building program to replace submarine losses, or-
dering a very simple reciprocating engine ship 
with split superstructure, the Ocean class, from 
United States yards. At home and in Canada 
they built similar Fort and Park class freighters 
and later some better turbine and diesel ships, all 
with the prefix Empire. The British Ocean de-
sign was modified in this country to a composite 
superstructure type, the Liberty ship, designated 
the EC2. Later in the war, the faster turbine 
Victory ships (VC-2) were built in considerable 
numbers. The regular peacetime program of C1, 
239 
C2, C3 types was enlarged, and joined by C4, C5, 
P1, P2, Ti, T2, T3 oceangoing types of cargo, 
passenger, and tanker designs. The C1MAV1 
coastal cargo ship, an even smaller N3 type, and 
many standardized tugs, barges, and lake ships 
were also built. The Japanese, too, had to resort 
to mass production of ships to meet emergency 
needs, producing a whole series of ships with 
simplified lines. 
After the war, these mass-produced vessels, 
American, British, and to some extent Japanese, 
accounted for a very considerable proportion of 
all shipping afloat. Because of surplus sales, and 
lend-lease transfers not returned, a number of 
American designs, especially Liberty, Victory, and 
T2 tanker, are now found under many flags. These 
standard types make recognition training easier, 
but a positive identification of nationality often 
requires more than visual observation. 
Our country has led the way since the war in 
building or ordering abroad so-called "supertank-
ers," grossing about 17,000 tons and carrying about 
28,000 deadweight tons. These vessels are operat-
ing under a number of flags including Pana-
manian, Honduran, and Liberian, as well as the 
better known United States shipping companies. 
The new Mariner class vessels represent a sig-
nificant change in cargo ship design, and though 
they are few in numbers now, they may be very 
important in any future war. 
In summary it can be pointed out that accurate 
ship recognition and reporting offers considerable 
opportunity to develop skill. Individual nation-
alities and shipyards have their own characteristic 
building habits in design and auxiliary equipment. 
Close attention and constant study will pay divi-
dends in many types of intelligence billets. 
Reporting on Naval Ships 
All known naval vessels are much more com-
pletely covered in official manuals than are mer-
chant ships. Additional unofficial sources that are 
very helpful are Jane's Fighting Ships and 
Fahey's Ships and Aircraft of the United States 
Fleet. Many of the recognition problems are 
somewhat similar to those of merchant ships, but 
the details to be reported on each vessel are more 
complicated and more urgently needed for naval 
purposes. In addition to simple recognition and

CONFIDENTEAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
description, it is essential to obtain specific data on 
performance, armament, armor, fire control, and 
the efficiency of crews. Opportunities for obser-
vation may be more limited, since many countries 
do not expose their naval vessels needlessly. Even 
though an obscure aerial photograph may reveal 
no details, the hull proportions of length to beam 
may disclose the type. Generally, observation 
should include noting deck lines and superstruc-
ture, the types of gun mounts and the disposition 
of batteries, the peculiarities of masts and funnels, 
and the shape of bow and stern. 
Observation of naval vessels is frequently com-
plicated by their neutral color and complexity of 
gear. Frequent refits may modify appearance so 
that the vessel cannot be recognized from earlier 
drawings. It is incumbent upon the intelligence 
officer to be familiar with all the major vessel 
types: capital ships, cruisers, carriers, destroyers, 
submarines, minecraft, patrol craft, amphibious, 
all auxiliaries, and yardcraft, noting that there 
are many subtypes, each with a specialized and 
significant use. He should also note pendant or 
bow numbers, and, of course, names whenever 
possible. 
Attention to armament should include various 
types of guns, torpedoes, guided missiles, mines, 
antiaircraft weapons, rockets, directors, and radar. 
The armor protection of side, deck, turret, and 
tower are important, together with compartmen-
tation and damage control measures. Mobility?
speed and maneuverability?and sea-keeping 
qualities in various kinds of weather must also be 
ascertained. These are but the bare essentials, and 
the individual officer should continue his studies 
of naval vessels constantly in order to make the 
most of reporting opportunities. 
Reporting on Aircraft 
As in the case of ships, there are two principal 
approaches to aircraft recognition. One is in com-
bat operations, when rapid identification is re-
quired. The best results in this type of recognition 
have been achieved by use of the American Ren-
shaw system, which consists of constant drill on 
total form. The other approach is more produc-
tive of information of intelligence interest, the 
British WEFT system: Wings?Engines?Fuse-
lage?Tail. It comprises a systematic detailed 
CONFIDENTIAL 
description. The observer, of course, must have 
a photograph to study or actually see the plane in 
a slow fly past. 
Wings are described according to their position 
on the fuselage, their size and shape: whether they 
are dihedral, if swept back and to what degree, 
gull or inverted gull, square or tapered, with 
rounded or square tips. Engines are noted as to 
number, whether in-line or radial reciprocating, 
turbo-jet, pulse-jet, ram-jet, or turbo-prop, and in 
respect to propellers the number of blades and 
whether they are coaxial contrarotating. In re-
spect to the fuselage, general proportions, shape, 
and position of protuberances such as cockpit, gun 
turrets, radomes, and air intakes are important. 
Reporting on the tail must include shape, number 
of vertical stabilizers, position of the horizontal 
stabilizer, and the extent to which the tail fairs 
into the fuselage. 
Aircraft structural terminology is part of the 
intelligence officer's professional equipment. He 
must also seek data on range, speed, maneuver-
ability, lifting capacity, performance at usual op-
erational and highest possible altitudes, vulner-
abilities, tactics employed, maintenance, and so 
forth. The appearance of a particular aircraft at 
a certain location may give clues as to unsuspected 
longer range. Air technical intelligence, as noted 
earlier, will supply detailed answers to many ques-
tions of production rate, metallurgy, and equip-
ment when opportunity is afforded to examine 
captured planes or their component parts. 
The signifiance of aircraft observation thus goes 
far beyond a mere determination of friend or foe. 
The appearance of German jets and rocket planes 
in World War II represented an outstanding ex-
ample of how prompt recognition resulted in sig-
nificant intelligence. We were able to assess their 
performance and take the proper countermeasures 
to save our bombing program on the continent and 
to avert defeat in the air. 
Reporting on Air Facilities 
Just as the proper use of the standard informa-
tion report form insures completeness of reporting 
on items of general naval interest, the use of a 
standard form for describing foreign air facilities 
(NME-193) serves as a guide to the intelligence 
officer reporting on airfields and seaplane stations.

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: COLLECTION CONFIDENTIAL 
It systematically provides spaces for entering de-
tailed information on location, runways, communi-
cation facilities, installations, transportation, 
meteorological conditions, and servicing facilities. 
Such reports are augmented by enclosures which 
furnish additional data through maps, photo-
graphs, approach procedures, operation regula-
tions, and other pertinent facts. 
A separate report is required for each facility, 
and the information thus obtained is used in the 
compilation of foreign airfield lists published 
jointly by the Air Force and ONI, and in the 
compilation of aeronautical charts and related 
publications published by the Aeronautical Chart 
Service and the Navy Hydrographic Office. 
Other Subjects of Reporting 
The fact that ships and aircraft have been sin-
gled out for special treatment above is in no way 
intended to minimize the importance of many 
other items of naval interest. Ports and harbors, 
of course, are to ships what air facilities are to 
aircraft, and information on ports and harbors 
represents a continuing requirement on naval in-
telligence. A special guide published for the col-
lector outlines the types of information desired in 
considerable detail. They include complete as-
sessment of the harbor and its approaches, the 
docking, cargo transfer, and storage facilities, 
inland clearance, repair and servicing, and a host 
of other items. A complete port study is not pos-
sible through a casual visit. It requires days and 
sometimes months of the keenest observation and 
most careful evaluation. 
Land transportation facilities, including rail-
ways, roads, bridges, tunnels, urban transit sys-
tems, inland waterways, and so forth, are 
primarily under the cognizance of the Army 
Transportation Corps, yet a naval observer may 
on occasion be in the best position to observe and 
report on them. Irrespective of source, such in-
formation is of vital importance to Navy plan-
ning. Even the seagoing naval officer when in 
port can note railway gage, number of tracks, con-
dition of rails, ties, and ballast, signaling system 
used, gradient and curvature markers, location of 
passing tracks, branch lines, bridges, culverts, tun-
nels, stations, repair, fuel and storage facilities, 
241 
size of marshalling yards, locomotive and car 
wheel arrangements, fuel used, freight observed in 
movement, types of couplers and brakes, and many 
similar items. It is all needed for accurate assess-
ment of railway capacity and vulnerability. 
Roads and highways should likewise be observed 
for location and mileages, branches, number of 
lanes, width of lanes and shoulders, surface mate-
rial, present condition, bridge construction and 
clearance. Reports on waterways should include 
information on the depths of water by seasons, 
degree of maintenance required, facilities for 
cargo transfer, and all dimensions of canal locks. 
Telecommunications facilities, though of a tech-
nical nature, also provide material for useful re-
porting even by the amateur. Noting the efficiency 
and extensiveness of the telephone and telegraph 
networks, the frequencies and locations of radio 
stations, and the shapes and positions of antennas 
will always yield valuable data. 
Power facilities are frequently keys to the capa-
bilities and vulnerabilities of an area. Noting 
power lines, substations, hydroelectric and thermo-
electric plants, the voltage and frequency of con-
sumer electric power, and the availability of power 
fuels, such as coal and oil, will provide material 
for many reports. 
Industrial reporting is complex and varied, and 
accurate identification by mere observation from 
the outside is often difficult. A collector going to 
a foreign port should make a careful study of the 
types of industrial installations he is apt to en-
counter in order to recognize them readily for what 
they are: steel mills, processing plants, construc-
tion works, and so forth, and whether they func-
tion in heavy, light, or agricultural industries. 
Estimations on production volume may be related 
to observed flows of raw materials, and numbers of 
workers. Labels on crates may give clues to ori-
gins and destinations. Pacing off or using an 
automobile speedometer may give plant dimen-
sions. Good opportunities for accurate reporting 
should not go begging for lack of ingenuity. 
Such observations should be considered a matter 
of collection and reporting routine. In this coun-
try such information is readily available to all 
foreign nations from libraries, newspapers, and 
brochures published by local chambers of corn-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
merce. Collection abroad is often not so easy, so 
a greater burden of observation rests on the col-
lecting agency. If opportunities for observation 
are fleeting, and the information is critical, the 
observer must concentrate on essential elements, 
and memorize them until he has an opportunity 
for recording without risk of compromise. Tak-
ing pictures is subject to the same qualifications: 
they are invaluable, but unless the need is very 
great they should not be taken in a manner open 
to easy compromise or diplomatic censure. 
The Intelligence Sketch 
Sketching is one of the old forms of reporting 
information. Whether a sketch is simple and 
rough or elaborate and artistic, it affords a graphic 
means of communication which in many cases is 
much more effective than a written description. In 
circumstances where photography is impossible or 
inadvisable the sketch is the solution, and a maxim 
for the collector is: "If you can't photograph it, 
sketch it!" 
Some typical instances when sketching would 
be most valuable and appropriate are given below: 
A naval attache has been granted permission to 
travel into the interior of the country in which he 
is stationed and to visit certain military and indus-
trial installations. Photography has been forbid-
den, and well aware that he cannot rely on his 
memory for all details, he plans certain memory 
aids which will help him sketch the locations, 
structures, and plant layouts when he returns to 
his office. 
A prisoner of war, when being interrogated, re-
vealed that he had recently been assigned to guard 
duty in a restricted harbor area. Although he is 
unable to describe verbally all that he saw, he can 
produce a rough sketch of certain port installa-
tions and identify buildings. This information 
later proves to supply missing information on 
that particular harbor. 
In the course of a mission, a pilot observes a 
type of aircraft unknown to him. The air intelli-
gence officer, debriefing the pilot, translates a de-
scription of the new plane into a sketh. (See fig. 
10.) Analysis of the sketch reveals technical de-
velopments hitherto unususpected, thus resulting 
in a reassessment of the enemy's air capabilities. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
An intelligence officer, put ashore with an am-
phibious reconnaissance patrol, is able to sketch 
the locations and relative bearings of a series of 
beach defenses. This sketch information, when 
delivered to the commander of the support group, 
makes it possible for naval gunfire support to be 
directed with greater accuracy. 
The most elementary kind of sketching is a. two 
dimensional drawing representing total form. 
(See fig. 11.) To achieve proper proportions the 
use of graph paper is recommended, particularly 
by the intelligence officer new to his job, but expe-
rience and constant practice will soon eliminate the 
need for graph paper assistance. 
Problems often arise in sketching such things 
as general terrain, waterfront areas, and buildings. 
A plane view would meet the minimum require-
ments, but by employing a simple sighting device, 
often used by landscape artists, it is possible to 
include perspective while retaining approximate 
scale. All that is needed is a pencil or ruler. Sup-
pose the subject is a building. Sighting the build-
ing over a pencil held vertically at arm's length 
it is found that the building's height is equal to 
about 2 inches of the pencils length. A 2 inch 
vertical line transcribed on paper is the first step 
in sketching the building. Its length is determined 
in the same manner by sighting with the pencil 
held horizontally. Height and length are thus 
transcribed in correct proportion. 
Beach sketching from seaward, invaluable in 
amphibious operations, can be mastered by any 
intelligence officer with the help of H. 0. Publica-
tion No. 227, The Amphibious Sketch. For self-
instruction in general sketching the following 
books are recommended: Arthur L. Guptill, Free-

Adequate sketching requires no special equip-
ment other than a pencil, soft eraser, and paper. 
For general purposes, a 2?H (medium) pencil is 
best because it is soft enough to produce a firm 
mark with minimum pressure and yet does not 
smear readily. The type of drawing paper used 
will naturally influence the result obtained, so for 
general purposes paper of soft texture, not glossy, 
is best.

RECORDING 
INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
A discussion of collection will not be complete 
without mention of a final requirement: the proper 
filing and recording of the results of the collection 
effort. Information must be labeled for ready 
reference. Such cataloging and indexing should 
begin when the collector in the field gathers his 
material for a report. The efficient collector 
should keep a personal file of facts and notes on 
people, places, and events. In form these may be 
card files, annotated clippings from newspapers 
and magazines, or penciled memoranda. Some or-
derly arrangement of this material will pay off 
when information is needed for reference or sug-
gestion for leads. Just as a good reporter the 
intelligence officer should write down observations 
and impressions while they are fresh in his mind. 
Memory can play strange tricks, and in intelli-
gence activity there is no place for hazy recollec-
tion. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
246 
A standard Intelligence File Index, used by 
United States intelligence agencies, assures uni-
form filing of information reports by all processing 
units. Thus a report or dispatch received by the 
Navy from Army or Air Force sources bears the 
same file number as it would if it had originated 
from a Navy collecting unit. Cross-indexing pro-
vides for further efficiency. 
Further consideration to the principles of filing 
will be given in the following chapter on process-
ing, for it is in the second step in the cycle that 
orderly arrangement of data becomes even more 
essential to the intelligence function in any mili-
tary establishment. 
This chapter is not an exhaustive treatment of 
collection. Aspects and applications of this first 
step in the intelligence cycle will appear again and 
again in succeeding chapters, for collection is basic 
to intelligence activity; it sets the wheels in motion; on its efficient operation the remaining steps 
of the cycle depend.

CHAPTER 10 
THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: PROCESSING 
In the continuous operation of the intelligence 
cycle, Collection provides the essential raw mate-
rial and processing acts in the manner of a cata-
lytic agent, transforming pertinent parts of the 
material into a meaningful product ready for dis-
semination and eventual use by appropriate action 
agencies. During this second phase of the cycle, 
the trained intelligence officer and the skilled 
analyst work with quantities of raw information 
collected from a great variety of sources, selecting, 
verifying, comparing, and interpreting items of 
value, and acting upon the results to produce usa-
ble intelligence. The basic problem is one of de-
termining the significance of information in the 
light of past experience, present circumstances, 
and possible future developments. To be utilized 
by the analyst in solving this problem are the prin-
ciples of logic, reasoning, and exhaustive research. 
As is true of the social sciences, intelligence is 
based on observed phenomena or facts from which 
generalized conclusions are drawn. Therefore, 
processing is much more than the orderly assem-
bling of related facts and the determining of their 
significance; it involves the deriving of total mean-
ing from these facts when related to other intelli-
gence already available. 
As distinguished from the other phases of the 
cycle, processing is fundamentally a mental oper-
ation, carried out primarily at higher echelons by 
specifically assigned analysts who are carefully 
selected and intensively trained for specalized 
activities. However, limited processing may be 
performed by any part of the intelligence organ-
ization, particularly at the lower echelons where 
all phases of the cycle are often the responsibility 
of a single unit or perhaps one intelligence officer. 
This is true because information for intelligence 
is never static, but in continual motion. It is 
gathered, and processed to a degree, by the collec-
tor who disseminates it upward to higher echelons, 
laterally to other echelons on the same level, or 
downward to lower echelons where it may be sub-
jected again and again to processing by different 
individuals and from different viewpoints. 
247 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Even when processed information, which is in-
telligence, has been placed in filing cabinets, it is 
only in suspended animation. It may already have 
set in motion a chain of events, or it may be drawn 
from the files at any time for use in conjunction 
with later information or intelligence to activate 
further events. 
Processing is a continuous operation because in-
formation of intelligence interest is constantly 
being collected and because each item of processed 
intelligence will open new areas of collection. It 
is a vital operation because collected facts and data 
have intelligence value only as the result of proc-
essing; failure to process represents a costly waste 
of the collection effort. Even processed informa-
tion requires frequent re-evaluation in order that 
it may have current utility. Processing functions 
are also activated when requests are received for 
intelligence on a given topic and when solutions 
are required for problems arising out of planning 
for strategic, operational, or countering purposes. 
In the processing phase of the cycle, three gen-
eral factors must always be kept in mind: the 
completeness of the basic data, the accuracy of the 
operation by which information is converted into 
intelligence, and the element of time. In order 
that the conclusions may be truly comprehensive 
and not partial, the basic facts and data used must 
be as inclusive as possible. In order to avoid 
errors which would render conclusions not only 
meaningless but also highly dangerous, the various 
processing functions must be expertly performed. 
Finally, because intelligence must be produced in 
sufficient time to be of value to those who need it, 
all information received by the processing unit 
must be handled expeditiously. 
The time-span of the processing phase is con-
ditioned both by the nature of the information re-
ceived and the urgency of the need for it. For 
example, a flash report from a subordinate com-
mander of an impending enemy air attack on a car-
rier would be disseminated immediately and the 
processing phase would be eliminated. Informa-
tion suggesting an imminent military attack on an

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
ally of the United States might force the concen-
tration of all processing activity into a matter of 
hours. On the other hand, a report including con-
flicting implications of an anticipated change of 
government in a country of minor world impor-
tance might require a longer period for thorough 
processing. At all times, however, speed in proc-
essing is important because of the constant possi-
bility that the final interpretation of the informa-
tion may have meaning of vital and immediate 
concern to a potential user. 
Because of its abstract nature, the diverse cir-
cumstances affecting it, and the varied application 
of its general principles, processing cannot be re-
duced to a series of mechanical operations. It 
includes a number of mental functions which are 
intricately interwoven and often overlapping as 
they continue toward the goal of correct conclu-
sions. At times several of these functions are per-
formed simultaneously and they do not necessarily 
follow one another in fixed sequence. As a result, 
there will seldom be complete detailed agreement 
as to the particular functions encompassed by proc-
essing or the terms to be used in describing them. 
However, the integral functions may be identified, 
for all practical purposes, as selection, evaluation, 
analysis, interpretation, and action. For the pur-
poses of discussion only can they be considered 
separately. 
There are certain techniques and aids or devices 
generally used in processing, such as labeling, in-
dexing, and filing. However, they are not ends 
in themselves and must never obscure the ultimate 
objective of processing which is the production of 
intelligence. 
SELECTION 
Volumes of information are received continu-
ously by processing units in the form of reports, 
messages, charts, photographs, journals, and 
printed material of all types. Diverse topics of 
potential intelligence value may be included within 
a single report or bits of information regarding 
one topic of interest may be scattered among many. 
Since no item may be disregarded and many may 
be obscured by the very bulk of the reports in 
which they are contained, there must be a careful 
sifting of all information received on the basis of 
interests and specific pending requests to extract 
CONFIDENTIAL 
248 
data of value. Selection, then, is the preliminary 
examination of information to determine the need 
for it, the degree of interest it holds, its possible 
use, and its meaning. If meaning is readily ap-
parent, the information will be disseminated 
promptly, even at this early stage of consideration. 
Selection, however, is much more than the ex-
tracting of pertinent data. It is the first step of 
processing whereby controls are established over 
all extracted material in order to make it available 
in usable form to the appropriate intelligence 
analysts. Depending upon the particular require-
ments of the analyst, the material received may be 
best controlled by subdividing it under general 
headings such as persons, places, organizations, 
situations, and trends. The sorting and grouping 
of information under headings such as these facili-
tate the current and future use of all extracted 
material; they are also of immediate value to the 
other functions of processing. 
Related to the establishment of controls are two 
additional activities by analysts which are part of 
the function of selection. The first is the prompt 
distribution of incoming material within the proc-
essing unit in order to maintain the rapid flow of 
information to all analysts who need it. How to 
minimize the circulation to analysts of informa-
tion in which they have no interest is one problem 
of distribution. The second activity is that of 
labelling material for later filing and indexing in 
the reference files. The objective of this activity, 
of course, is to insure ready availability to the 
analyst of any material he has reviewed or proc-
essed, regardless of the means he may use to iden-
tify it at the time. The participation of the an-
alyst in this preliminary phase of indexing and 
filing increases the probability that each item will 
be identifiable under the widest variety of head-
ings by reference file personnel. 
EVALUATION 
Evaluation is a continuing function of process-
ing. In fact, it is perpetual within the intelligence 
cycle, beginning when the collector considers cer-
tain information worthy of reporting, and con-
tinning thereafter as this information is passed 
from person to person. Within a processing unit, 
which has received information from many 
sources, evaluation is the competent consideration

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: PROCESSING CONFIDENTIAL 
of each item of information, the study of its rela-
tionships with other pertinent information, and 
the determination of its accuracy, completeness, 
and inherent meaning. A basic problem in evalu-
ation is the fact that the very nature of informa-
tion collected for intelligence purposes usually 
precludes assigning it an absolute value, either 
true or false. Of necessity, therefore, this infor-
mation must be evaluated on the basis of its rela-
tionship to known fact and the degree to which it 
is in agreement with the known fact. 
Nonevaluated information is not intelligence 
and has little value for intelligence purposes. In 
fact, it can be potentially dangerous if dissemi-
nated without being clearly identified as such. 
Generally, every effort should be made to evaluate 
information properly prior to its dissemination. 
Basic considerations in the function of evaluating 
information are the reliability of its source and 
the accuracy of its content. 
The Standard Evaluation Code 
As a means of rating the reliability of the source 
and the probability of the information itself, a 
standard letter-figure code system is widely used 
by United States intelligence agencies and should, 
therefore, be thoroughly understood by all intelli-
gence personnel. As indicated below, the source 
is given a letter rating of from A to F and the 
content a figure rating of from 1 to 6. 
Reliabflity of Source Probabiiitio of Information 
A?Completely reliable 1?Confirmed by other 
B?tsually reliable sources 
C?Fairly reliable 2?Probably true 
D?Not usually reliable 3?Possibly true 
E?Unreliable 4?Doubtfully true 
F?Reliability cannot be 5?Improbable report 
judged 6?Truth cannot be judged 
In general, collectors in the field apply this code 
system to reports which they submit. Initially, 
the writer of the report is the most competent 
judge of the reliability of his source. Reports 
based on personal observation are normally rated 
"A," while those obtained from informants whose 
reliability can be judged in the light of past ex-
perience are rated "B," "C," or "D." An "F" 
rating simply means that the reporting officer has 
nothing upon which to estimate the source's reli-
ability. It may be the first time the source has 
supplied any information and the reporting officer 
269196-54------17 
249 
cannot assess him by association, by the valued 
opinion of colleagues, or by recommendation of 
other trusted informants. The "E" rating is 
rarely used by originators of reports, except per-
haps when distortion or falseness may provide 
useful background information. However, it may 
be used by subsequent processors when additional 
information not available to the collector indicates 
that the source is completely unreliable, as far as 
the information supplied in a particular instance 
is concerned. 
The ratings assigned by field agencies are not 
automatically accepted by the intelligence proces-
sing units; rather, they are used as guides. Since 
the processing units sometimes have more infor-
mation on an original source than the collector, 
field ratings are subject to change. Even the 
direct observation of the originator, which has 
been rated by him as "A," may be downgraded 
by the analyst on the basis of previous experience 
with the originator's accuracy of observation and 
reporting. It is also possible that a source of the 
originator may be rated as "F" by the analyst if 
no information is available to substantiate the 
assigned rating. 
There is no firm relationship between the letters 
and figures of the rating code. An "A" source 
will not always produce information of "1" or 
"2" rating, for mistakes can be made by the most 
reliable sources. On the other hand, an "E" 
source may supply information that is probably 
true or confirmed by other sources. Usually, 
however, the most accurate information will come 
from the most reliable source; hence the source 
does tend to influence the rating of the content. 
Ideally, source and content should always be con-
sidered entirely separately. However, there are 
instances when the reliability of the source has a 
direct bearing on content, especially when there 
is no other means for judging the material under 
consideration. As a result, cumulative records of 
the reliability and accuracy of repetitive sources 
can be particularly helpful. When the originator 
asigns a low rating to information there is a 
tendency on the part of the analyst to accept it. 
To be re-emphasized is the fact that the Stand-
ard Evaluation Code is to be used only as a guide 
and not taken too literally. As is often true of 
standardized rating systems, assigned values tend

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
to be arbitrary and subject to diverse interpreta-
tion by its users who have varied backgrounds 
of experience and training. The rating of the 
content of the information is particularly difficult 
since degrees of accuracy and probability are 
involved. Information may be only partially cor-
rect, or, though correct in itself, may convey false 
implications. It is equally the case that the reli-
ability of a source may change, so that its ratings 
may vary over a period of time. Giving due con-
sideration to the ratings assigned by the origina-
tor, the analyst carefully examines the source and 
content of the information received on the basis 
of the total related information and intelligence 
available to him. 
Testing the Source 
In determining the reliability of the source, the 
analyst must distinguish between the actual source 
and the transmitting agency. When the action 
source is not revealed, however, the reliability of 
the transmitter, and his evaluation of the source, 
assumes primary importance. Theoretically, the 
only absolute sources for the analyst are his own 
direct observation and proven documentary evi-
dence. The first is seldom possible and even the 
second must be verified. In testing for reliability, 
the first question is that of authenticity. Is the 
source from which the report ostensibly comes the 
true source? Or has false information been 
released for purposes of deception? 
An example of the dangers of incorrect evalua-
tion of the authenticity of a source is described by 
Hector C. Bywater in Their Secret Purposes: 
Dramas and Mysteries of the Naval War. During 
World War I, a German warrant officer discovered 
charts of Russian mine fields and coast defenses 
in a brief case which the beautiful Anna of Libau 
claimed had been left behind by a former lover. 
Much excited by his discovery, the German officer 
obtained an audience with German naval author-
ities who acted on his information. Minesweepers 
were sent out at night, and it was found that the 
indicated clear channel was actually free of mines. 
Gun flashes were observed at the shore defense 
positions marked on the charts, and the Germans 
worked out their gunfire problems accordingly. 
The next day, a strong force of German ships 
moved in, not to victory, but to disaster. The 
CONFIDENTIAL 
250 
Russians had sown mines in the clear channel after 
the minesweepers' investigation of the night be-
fore, and the gun positions proved to be dummies, 
located far from the site of the actual coast defense 
batteries. The warrant officer was a reliable 
source, but the papers found were false, and Anna 
of Libau was subsequently identified as a long-
term Russian agent. 
The second question which arises in testing a 
source for reliability is that of trustworthiness, 
which includes the factors of loyalty, motive, and 
objectivity. Trustworthiness may change with 
the passage of time. A source may have divided 
and conflicting loyalties, and the evaluator should 
anticipate circumstances under which that per-
son's loyalty might be weakened or turned to active 
hostility in the future. Loyalty of a source may 
be determined to some extent by background, past 
performance, and present position. For example, 
an officer or enlisted man in the United States 
armed forces would be given a higher loyalty 
rating, and hence considered more trustworthy, 
than a citizen of a neutral country or a prisoner of 
war. The motive of a source in giving informa-
tion must be carefully considered. Perhaps he 
acted under the stimulus of strong emotion, such 
as jealousy, revenge, patriotism, or fanaticism. 
Motives are sometimes revealed by the manner in 
which the information is made available, or by a 
study of the source's background and personality. 
Objectivity is even more difficult to determine than 
loyalty and motive. Every individual has certain 
prejudices and no one is a completely objective 
witness, so that the analyst must try to determine 
whether or not the report is biased or objective. 
What a collector sees and reports may be colored 
by subconscious reactions to certain things or little 
idiosyncrasies of which even he may be quite un-
aware. Few people have photographic memories 
or the ability to reproduce at a later time all of the 
significant points of a lengthy conversation. Per-
sonal interpretation is a common failing. Because 
of these various hindrances to objectivity on the 
part of the observer, the analyst should know as 
much as possible about the reporter and be con-
tinually on guard against personality factors 
which can impair objectivity. 
The third question regarding reliability relates 
to the competency of the source. What have been

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: PROCESSING CONFIDENTIAL 
his training, experience, and opportunity for 
judging what he has seen? An observer who is 
known to be an expert in a given field of knowl-
edge may usually be presumed to be competent in 
related fields. If in the past he has been a close 
and accurate observer, whether or not he is aware 
of the full implications of what he reports, the 
chances are that his information has value. The 
reporter who has lived in a foreign country for 
several years will usually supply more discerning 
comment than will the reporter who has newly 
arrived on the scene. Competency also involves 
the ability of the observer to gain the informa-
tion in question. What would have been his means 
of access, or would he have been in a position to 
observe what he has reported? 
Testing the Information 
As already indicated, the evaluation of the con-
tent of information is a matter of judging the 
degree of probability and accuracy. To what ex-
tent is it true or possible? Three helpful criteria 
at this point are: coherence, credibility, and con-
firmation. The use of these criteria depends, of 
course, upon the quantity of similar information 
received and the nature of the information itself. 
If, for example, no similar information has been 
received, the use of the criterion of confirmation 
may not be possible. 
On the average, it is to be expected that new 
information of value will have coherence, that is, 
it will be consistent within itself and its ideas will 
be related to each other in a logical manner. If it 
is self-contradictory, its probability is immediately 
subject to question. Relevant details add to the 
coherence of information by amplifying general 
statements which might otherwise be vague and 
of little value. As a criterion, however, coherence 
is only preliminary and by no means conclusive. 
Completely inaccurate information may appear to 
be logical and consistent, while sound information 
may seem to contain some inconsistencies. Nor do 
details in and of themselves insure correctness; yet 
they do provide additional means of verification. 
Credibility is determined by the way the infor-
mation fits into the general pattern of activity of 
which it is a part. It is worthy of belief if con-
sistent with the accumulated body of intelligence. 
Startling information which is completely con-
251 
trary to the general progress of events or the be-
havior trends of individuals or groups becomes 
suspect to the analyst. The analyst's own experi-
ence in processing and general background knowl-
edge are particularly useful here. He must be 
alert to the subtleties of behavior patterns which 
on the surface appear to vary and change. This 
alertness should prevent him from discarding in-
formation just because it does not at first appear 
to be consistent with his general knowledge. How-
ever, it is more often the case that a report which 
is consistent with available intelligence is worthy 
of credence. A report which is at variance with 
the intelligence at hand should be subject to fur-
ther study, even though it has met the criteria of 
coherence and confirmation. 
The confirmation of the content of information 
by other specific information on the same or related 
subjects greatly increases its degree of probability 
and accuracy. By means of this criteria, new in-
formation may be confirmed, not confirmed, or 
contradicted. Two reports containing similar 
data, but originating from different sources, must 
be closely compared down to the smallest details, 
if the information contained therein is to be con-
firmed. Minute differences do not as a rule destroy 
the value of those portions of the two reports 
which can be reconciled. The compatability of 
new information with known facts may aid in its 
confirmation. For example, an operational report 
may give a new location for certain enemy fleet 
units. If these units have the capability of reach-
ing the new location from their last known posi-
tion, and if this new disposition is in agreement 
with the current operational situation, then the 
report assumes greater degree of accuracy. 
To be emphasized is the fact that the degree of 
accuracy of new information cannot be established 
by satisfying only one of these three criteria. 
Coherence, credibility, and confirmation are inter-
related, so that an item must be judged accurate in 
proportion to the degree it satisfies all three. The 
reliability of the source is another factor which 
may be considered. 
Problems of Evaluation 
The evaluation of new information is often diffi-
cult and complicated by a number of problems, 
some of which can be minimized by the collector.

Such problems include improper identification, in-
accurate or incomplete reporting, duplicate report-
ing, contradiction, and determination of inherent 
meaning. 
If the new information concerns persons or 
places, the greatest care must be taken to identify 
them completely. Surnames must be combined 
with complete given names to avoid mistaken iden-
tity. If the surname is a common one, it may be 
necessary to include birthdate and physical de-
scription to make sure that there can be no mis-
understanding as to the particular individual in 
question. Variations in spelling and aliases must 
be noted. In the case of places, the use of geo-
graphical coordinates, reference points, and phys-
ical relationships to known positions can be ex-
tremely important. This is especially true of 
places in areas which are little known, have not 
been completely mapped, or where local names are 
the colloquialisms of indigenous groups. 
Inaccurate, careless reporting can and does re-
sult in inconsistencies and incoherent logic. Ex-
cessive wordage and long, involved comments can 
obscure the facts of the case, complicating the work 
of accurate evaluation. Poor editing itself may 
result in failure to note typographical errors and 
incorrect inferences which, in turn, can cause 
faulty reasoning based on false premises. Ten-
dencies to insert personal opinions and wishful 
thinking in reports make it difficult, if not impos-
sible, for the analyst to separate fact from fancy. 
Incomplete reporting results from failure to in-
clude all pertinent details in a report. For exam-
ple, care should always be taken to identify the 
source of the information, if at all possible. When 
this is impossible or inadvisable, some evaluation 
should be given of the source as well as the content. 
One of the most serious problems faced by the 
analyst is that of duplicate reporting. Informa-
tion regarding the same topic may be received 
from different transmitting agencies so that one 
report tends to confirm the other, even though both 
agencies have received their information from the 
same source. The dangers of this situation are 
well illustrated by reports which reached Wash-
ington during World War II from two different 
collecting agencies regarding the identification of 
Nazi military units in an occupied country of Eu-
rope. Although the information of both reports 
CONFIDENTIAL 
252 
was the same in every detail, the sources appeared 
to the intelligence processing units to be quite dif-
ferent, apparently providing mutual confirmation. 
It later developed, however, when the two collect-
ing agencies in the field compared notes, that the 
source of both reports was identical, and hence 
there was no real confirmation. Great care must 
be taken to avoid false confirmation. 
In attempting to evaluate new information, the 
analyst may find two or more reports on the same 
topic which are completely contradictory and im-
possible to reconcile. The only action possible 
may be to summarize both reports, with no con-
clusion, and wait for further information which 
will permit accurate evaluation. At all times, 
evaluation can only be made on the basis of infor-
mation actually available to the analyst, even 
though the existence of additional information is 
suspected or known. In such cases, the analyst 
must exercise the greatest caution and discretion, 
keeping in mind that well-founded doubts must 
be resolved in favor of the Navy. 
Determination of Inherent Meaning 
Testing for the degree of reliability and ac-
curacy of new information does not complete the 
function of evaluation. It is still necessary to 
determine what this information actually means 
and thus how it may affect the total body of knowl-
edge relating to the subject. Sometimes a report 
may have no significance, or its significance is 
obvious; sometimes parts of it make good sense, 
but other parts are still obscure and questionable. 
A detected flight of enemy bombers may on one oc-
casion indicate a strike at only one target, but in 
other situations the attack may be directed against 
one or all of several possible targets. The move-
ment of enemy barges may mean the reinforce-
ment of a particular advance base or the staging 
of an amphibious operation according to the at-
tendant circumstances. When the significance is 
obvious, dissemination of the information should 
be immediate. When the significance remains in 
doubt, further processing is necessary. 
This early determination of meaning in the 
total processing operation does not necessarily in-
volve immediately the later function of interpre-
tation, although the nature of the information 
may permit interpretation to develop rapidly from

its accurate evaluation. In many cases, this de-
termination of meaning concerns only the direct 
implications of the information to a particular 
subject or situation. Therefore, further process-
ing is required in order to place this new informa-
tion in its proper perspective and to relate its 
significance to the total body of knowledge. Often 
confirmation of the content of information will 
merge into the processing function of analysis. 
ANALYSIS 
Various explanations may be given of the mental 
activity which takes place in many instances from 
the time new information is being evaluated until 
the time it is interpreted and transformed into in-
telligence. Some of these concern themselves with 
features of inductive and deductive reasoning and 
make use of such descriptive terms as analysis, col-
lation, and synthesis or integration. These ex-
planations can be helpful; they can also be con-
fusing. Since it is extremely difficult to isolate 
or distinguish between some of these mental activ-
ities, they may all be included, from a practical 
point of view, in the general function of analysis. 
An essential factor in processing, analysis is the 
comparison of information with known facts and 
previously evaluated data in order to determine 
relationships which may lead to pertinent infer-
ences or conclusions. These relationships, in ef-
fect, become new, more comprehensive facts. 
During analysis, a study is made of the compo-
nent parts of evaluated and related facts, their 
inter-relationships, and their effect on established 
patterns of activity. After the careful weighing 
of these parts and reaching of a composite judg-
ment regarding them, they are then fitted together 
into a meaningful, coherent whole. The process of 
analysis is one of distilling and refining, of sepa-
rating and re-combining. Sensitivity on the part 
of the analyst is required to catch all implications 
of the facts under consideration and to visualize 
every possible combination which will lead to 
fuller understanding and meaning. Analysis 
often aids in resolving contradictions and reveal-
ing the need for, if not the existence of, missing 
information. It frequently leads to the re-evalua-
tion of the information being studied. 
For the intelligence officer and the analyst, the 
function of analysis requires a fund of accumu-
253 
lated knowledge, personal liaison with those who 
are authorities in the particular subject field under 
consideration, and intensive research. The re-
quired fund of knowledge is more than personal 
training and years of experience; it involves the 
ready availability of pertinent material which has 
been indexed and filed, together with the utiliza-
tion of devices whereby this material can be con-
sidered in an orderly, logical manner. Effective 
personal liaison is also a practical means of fur-
ther expanding the fund of knowledge, as required, 
to meet the needs of the analyst. It brings to bear 
on the problem additional points of view. 
Research Methods 
Research means careful searching, studious in-
quiry, and exhaustive investigation. It is an in-
valuable aid in helping to fill in some of the gaps 
of missing information. It provides important 
factual background, contributes to the verification 
of new information, and assists in the identifica-
tion of material. It also contributes to the dis-
covery of relationships which give meaning and 
significance to what might otherwise be discon-
nected facts and data. 
The materials for research include written rec-
ords, files, reference books, newspaper clippings, 
encyclopedias, and libraries, both general and spe-
cial. Careful documentation of facts is, of course, 
essential to good research. In the compilation of 
data, working bibliographies should be prepared 
from card-index files, periodical guides, newspaper 
indices, and other reference guides. Each refer-
ence should be entered on a separate card. Indi-
vidual cards should then be grouped according to 
major items of interest. 
From the study of evaluated information and 
additional data gathered by research methods 
arises one or more tentative explanations or the-
ories. As additional material is accumulated, the 
tentative explanation or theory is strengthened or 
weakened, or one or more appear to approach more 
nearly to the truth. Logical reasoning and sound 
judgment play an important part in this mental 
process which results in the drawing of pertinent 
inferences and the reaching of meaningful conclu-
sions. To be avoided is the ready acceptance of 
the first reasonable explanation and conclusion 
derived from an analytical study. Thorough re-

search will tend to insure greater accuracy of the 
function of analysis. 
INTERPRETATION 
Interpretation is the determining of the fullest 
possible meaning of partially processed informa-
tion, considered in relation to all other pertinent 
knowledge and in the perspective of current plan-
ning. Depending upon its source and content, 
information can be, and sometimes is, given in-
terpretation almost immediately after receipt. In 
some cases, its meaning is obvious. More often, 
new information must be subjected to the process-
ing functions of selection, evaluation, and anal-
ysis before the most accurate interpretation can 
be made. 
The full meaning of information inevitably re-
lates to its effect on an existing condition or situa-
tion. Does this new information alter or add 
significance to what is already known? Does it 
tend to confirm or disprove what is now believed 
to be true ? What are its implications? Correct 
interpretation completes the final transformation 
of information into intelligence ready for use. 
When strategic uses are involved, interpretation 
must take into consideration all relevant compo-
nents of intelligence knowledge: military geogra-
phy, transportation and telecommunications, 
sociological, political, economic, scientific and tech-
nical, armed forces, and biographical. It must be 
comprehensive if it is to give accurate indication 
of a foreign nation's capabilities or intentions. As 
new information is processed, the interpretations 
made will affect in some manner the current intel-
ligence estimates of that nation. New capabilities 
may be discovered, and old ones discarded. 
When operational uses are being considered, in-
terpretation can supply the commander with in-
telligence vital to his estimate of the situation and 
his selection of the course of action which will 
most nearly permit the fulfillment of his assigned 
mission. For example, knowledge of the disposi-
tion of opposing enemy forces is not completely 
processed intelligence. Such knowledge is finally 
processed only when it has been interpreted in con-
junction with such factors as terrain, weather, log-
istics, and morale. Full meaning will relate to the 
capabilities of the enemy forces to initiate or resist 
an attack. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
The intelligence officer and the analyst can best 
perform their function of interpretation only 
when fully aware of the direction of current plan-
ning. They must also make full use of their own 
knowledge and experience. Other factors in in-
terpretation are logical reasoning and conscien-
tious consultation with associates in order that an 
accurate and valid interpretation can be most 
nearly assured. Acuteness and ingenuity are req-
uisites for the interpretation of all implications 
which may arise out of processed information. 
ACTION IN PROCESSING 
As used in processing, the term "action" refers 
to requests for further collection, the preparation 
of reports and studies, and the initiation of rec-
ommendations regarding policies and planning. 
At any point in the processing phase of the 
cycle, the analyst may require additional informa-
tion or amplification of information being proc-
essed. Accordingly, specific requests for collection 
are addressed to available agencies. Such requests 
should include detailed requirements and time lim-
itations. Close coordination of the efforts of col-
lecting and processing units can greatly increase 
the overall efficiency of intelligence production. 
Processing units should fully understand the lim-
itations and capabilities of the various collection 
agencies; at the same time, the collection agencies 
should endeavor to anticipate the requirements of 
processing and transmit information in lucid and 
usable form. 
The preparation of the first draft of reports and 
studies begins with the review and grouping of 
the analyst's reference cards. The objective is to 
present ideas in clear and simple language, so that 
the completed study may be clear, logical, and 
complete. Critical, objective review is necessary 
to make certain that no false implications and er-
roneous inferences can be drawn from the state-
ments made. Any excursions from the central 
theme should be rigorously excluded or, if there 
is a need for such observations, they should be 
relegated to a separate appendix rather than per-
mitted in the main text. At times, the interpreta-
tion of new information may suggest the need for 
changes in or modification of current policies and 
planning. Completely new policies and major re-
visions in planning may appear to be urgently

required. In such cases, appropriate recommenda-
tions, carefully documented and substantiated, 
should be prepared for forwarding to the action 
agencies concerned. The decision as to the proper 
action agency and other interested agencies which 
should receive the intelligence product leads to 
dissemination, the third phase of the cycle. 
AN ILLUSTRATION OF PROCESSING 
Some of the functions of processing and prob-
lems faced by intelligence personnel may be better 
understood when applied to a specific intelligence 
situation. For purposes of simplification, the sit-
uation selected for discussion is one which con-
fronted a Norwegian intelligence activity located 
in neutral Sweden during World War II. 
Through close liaison with the underground 
organization in occupied Norway, a wealth of in-
formation was received concerning the activities 
of German submarines operating out of the huge 
concrete pens at Bergen and Trondheim. The 
underground found it extremely difficult to over-
come the stringent security measures effected at 
these installations and only on rare occasions did 
opportunity arise for close observation. The Ger-
mans, however, sometimes employed Norwegian 
laborers to carry supplies on board U-boats out-
fitting in "Dora," the pens at Trondheim. One of 
these laborers was a loyal patriot who faithfully 
reported his observations to representatives of the 
underground. No loitering was allowed any of 
the workers around the pens, and certainly a man 
bent over with a heavy sack on his back is not in 
the best position for observation. Besides, he had 
no knowledge of submarines and was unable to 
identify technical equipment. Nevertheless, his 
reports were carefully scrutinized when they 
reached Sweden. One of them contained a 
puzzling bit of information. In the course of a 
rather garrulous account of his movements while 
carrying boxes and sacks of supplies from the 
warehouse to the U-boat, the observer mentioned 
that he had to step over a "riir" lying on the deck. 
What was this "riir" ? The Norwegian word 
means "pipe" and is used to describe many kinds 
of structural tubes. What was its diameter, 
length, of what material was it made? Was it a 
water pipe, a wire conduit, a new periscope? 
Could a sketch of it be supplied? Back to Trond-
255 
heim went a request for more information. In 
about a week a reply was received, accompanied 
by a very crude sketch. The sketch was of little 
value; it revealed no detail and was not drawn to 
scale. The supplementary information was some-
what more helpful, although the observer did not 
really get a good look at the pipe because there 
were too many German sailors standing around it. 
As he recalled, the part of the pipe he stepped 
over was about two feet in diameter. No, he didn't 
think it was a periscope. He couldn't tell what 
material it was made from since it was painted 
the same color as the rest of the U-boat. It was 
lying just forward of the conning tower. That 
was about all he could remember. 
How could these meager facts be evaluated and 
interpreted? The source was certainly authentic. 
Trustworthy? Yes, that too, for he was motivated 
by patriotic desire to aid his country's cause, and 
was completely vouched for by the underground. 
Competent? Unfortunately not. He was one of 
the unusual Norwegians who had never been to 
sea, nor had he ever worked as a stevedore or any-
where around a dock area. He had worked all his 
life with his hands, but had never operated ma-
chinery of any kind. He also doubted that he 
would get another work assignment in "Dora," 
since his gang had been transferred to another 
part of the city for road repair. 
To what further tests could the information 
be subjected. There was no possibility of con-
firmation by other sources available to the under-
ground. Was it coherent, or credible in the light 
of existing information? The U-boat had been 
positively identified by coast-watchers, and the 
names of the commander and many of the crew 
were known. It had been in the pen twenty days, 
long enough for minor repairs and installation of 
new equipment. Were the pens capable of making 
new equipment? No, everything came from Ger-
many, but installation could be made either by 
the U-boat's crew or by certain German tech-
nicians employed at the pen. Consultation with 
a refugee Norwegian naval officer, who had once 
been a submariner, brought no new leads or 
suggestions. 
At this point there was not much to analyze, or 
interpret. Yet anything new on U-boats and their 
operations had a high intelligence priority and

was eagerly scrutinized by the Allied intelligence 
agencies in London. Perhaps the pipe would 
mean something to a staff expert on submarines. 
Accordingly the information was sent to London. 
An immediate reply was received, directing that 
every effort should be made to continue the obser-
vations at "Dora," and to note especially the pres-
ence of similar "pipes" on other U-boats. 
The Norwegian underground renewed attempts 
to penetrate the pens at both Trondheim and Ber-
gen, but several weeks passed without result. Ger-
man vigilance had not been relaxed. 
Then came a report from the Admiralty that a 
damaged U-boat had been captured in the North 
Sea. It was equipped with snorkel. The mystery 
of the "r6r" was solved. It was a logical inference 
that U-boats were being equipped with snorkels at 
bases in Norway. Full description and accurate 
drawings were now available and coast-watchers 
henceforth could identify snorkel on U-boats pass-
ing through Norwegian fjords. Strategic and 
tactical planners had to cope with a new U-boat 
capability. 
The incident was certainly not a triumph for 
intelligence, as far as its forewarning function is 
concerned. It could have been if the "rOr" had 
been seen by a competent observer. It does illus-
trate, however, typical frustrations in the collect-
ing and processing of information. Little things 
have significance only when they are correctly 
interpreted. 
PERSONNEL FOR PROCESSING 
Any discussion of the functions of processing 
quickly reveals the requirements for a highly com-
petent and skilled staff of personnel, both military 
and civilian. The experiences of intelligence 
agencies during World War II emphasized above 
all the need for personnel possessed of the peculiar 
talents required in processing information into a 
product of real value and use. It must be re-em-
phasized that not just any officer can be assigned 
to an intelligence processing billet and expected to 
produce satisfactorily. In an age of specializa-
tion in so many fields of endeavor, Intelligence 
has of necessity also become a specialized activity. 
However, particular training is not alone suffici-
ent; selected personnel must have capability and 
adaptability for this particular activity. This is 
CONFIDENTIAL 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
equally true for civilian personnel, so that their 
selection involves much more than a consideration 
of paper qualifications. Since mental capabilities 
must be demonstrated, flexibility in the assignment 
of personnel is essential. 
Acquirable qualifications for analysis include a 
college education, preferably with experience in 
research methodology; demonstrated ability to 
write; experience in intelligence activity, includ-
ing knowledge of intelligence functions and re-
sponsibilities; and, whenever possible, a working 
knowledge of the particular language of the area 
of interest to which assigned, as well as travel or 
residence withi:n that area. 
In addition to training and experience, the qual-
ities of the analytical mind are indispensable. 
These qualities include objectivity of approach, 
an enthusiasm in the painstaking search for perti-
nent data, and a capacity for developing relation-
ships between facts. Imagination, a sensitivity 
to implications, and a positive reaction to subtle 
changes are mental qualities which must be applied 
to the problems of processing. Common sense and 
a practical realization of the pressing requirements 
of intelligence production are significant temper-
ing factors. 
Analysts can seldom live in worlds of their own. 
As integral personalities of the processing unit 
they must work in the full spirit of cooperation so 
that the intelligence product can be the result of 
the integration of varied points of view. Over-
all harmony cif effort can come only out of indi-
vidual adaptability to and consideration of the 
interests of coworkers. Self-restraint in spite of 
tension and stress can do much to assure orderly 
and effective activity when the time element im-
poses heavy pressures. Above all, the analyst 
must have a balanced point of view and a well-
grounded sense of values; the processing unit is no 
place for the extremist. Finally, he must be con-
vinced of the importance of intelligence produc-
tion and clearly appreciate the relative significance 
of his own contribution. 
The answer, then, to good processing is not 
merely organizational structure, important as 
organization and sound administration are for any 
group; rather, it is the quality of personnel who 
make up the structure. The simple fact is that 
the quality of intelligence produced is directly 
256

Approved For Reilplista9MM: gimp@?gagglgR0001002100086NFIDENTIAL 
proportionate to the quality of the individuals who 
produce it. 
TECHNIQUES AND AIDS 
In connection with processing, two points should 
be re-emphasized. First, the transforming of in-
formation into intelligence requires a high degree 
of professional competency, judgment, and ex-
perience if the results are to be consistently worth-
while. Second, the functions of processing can-
not be systematized into a series of assembly-line 
procedures. However, because of the quantities 
of information involved, various techniques and 
aids are commonly used by means of which infor-
mation can be acquired, extracted, indexed, and 
compiled on a logical, systematic basis. These 
techniques and aids are of material assistance to 
the various functions of processing in more nearly 
assuring their completeness, accuracy, and time-
liness. 
The following techniques and aids can be help-
ful, although their utilization will vary according 
to the requirements of a particular analyst: liaison 
with sources, including records of performance; 
files and file controls; situation maps, charts, 
graphs, and statistical tables; and periodic digests. 
The sources of an analyst's information are vital 
in connection with evaluation and further collec-
tion as required. Liaison with these sources may 
be accomplished by personal interview and by the 
written exchange of comments, suggestions, and 
analyses regarding information which has been 
transmitted. Any means by which the most cor-
dial and sympathetic relationships can be estab-
lished and maintained with the sources of informa-
tion and with transmitting agencies will prove 
valuable. As has already been suggested, source 
identification and performance records, when it is 
possible to keep them, can be helpful both to the 
processor and to the collector. 
Files 
Card files are generally used by analysts for 
day-to-day working purposes. They are a prac-
tical means of recording extracted pertinent data 
from lengthy reports or more bulky written mat-
ter and for the easy assembling and arranging of 
relevant facts in whatever logical manner the topic 
under consideration suggests. On one card may 
269196-54 18 
257 
be listed the chronological developments of a par-
ticular topic, so that a current situation can be 
noted almost at a glance. A separate card for 
each source may be used for the recording of in-
formation received on the same topic, so that ready 
comparison can be made at any time. Card files 
permit the subdividing of subject matter into its 
smallest possible elements thus facilitating a num-
ber of the processing functions. 
Reference files contain the correspondence, 
reports, and more bulky written matter from 
which card files are prepared. In the use of ref-
erence files, selectivity and good judgment on the 
part of the analyst are required. While the loca-
tion of these files is not of major importance, it is 
imperative that their contents be readily available. 
Availability necessitates rigid controls. 
Control of Files 
The control system for any files depends in large 
part on their size; if small, they are usually 
organized on the basis of subject; if large, on the 
basis of numerical designations, supported by a 
card catalogue guide. When files are organized 
by subject, particularly in the case of intelligence 
card files, they are often subdivided according to 
names of individuals, organizations, places, situ-
ations, and trends. 
Controls are greatly strengthened by the cen-
tralization of files and the most exacting cross-
ref erencing of subject matter. When several 
separate units retain reference material indefi-
nitely, the very fact of its existence may not re-
main known to all who have an interest in it, and 
its transfer from one unit to another may become 
haphazard or result in loss or at least uncertainty 
of location. Centralized control increases avail-
ability as well as security. Cross-referencing is 
a means of increasing the possibility of locating 
reference material, regardless of the way in which 
it is requested. For example, information about 
a person will logically be filed under his name. 
In addition, cross-reference cards or forms may 
be filed under his country of residence, occupation, 
military unit, or the incident or incidents in which 
he has been involved. In this manner, the analyst 
is likely to obtain all relevant information con-
cerning the topic with which he is working. Also, 
pertinent data is less likely to be overlooked.

Filing systems are established for purposes of 
uniformity. They must meet the needs of the 
units they are designed to serve. For United 
States intelligence agencies, the Intelligence File 
Index, called IFI, has been created and is in use. 
It is a decimal filing system which includes a four-
digit number for each basic element of subject 
matter and uses up to four decimal places for the 
additional subdivision of each element. For 
example, the 4000's are set aside for economic 
matters; within the 4000 block, the 4200's are used 
for fuels, metals and minerals; 4203 is petroleum; 
and 4203-0408 refers to the production of syn-
thetic oil. When reports are received, the 
analyst is expected to attach a sheet on which he 
enters the appropriate IFI numbers. The report 
and attached sheet then go to the filing unit where 
all reports pertaining to the same subject are listed 
on a master control sheet, according to the 
assigned numbers. 
Maintaining Files 
Obviously, the maintaining of files will vary 
according to the size and location of an intelli-
gence processing unit. Needs, working habits, 
and physical facilities are not uniform. A unit 
consisting of one officer and an enlisted man will 
of necessity vary its procedures from one which 
includes a larger group at the theater or depart-
mental level. However, a carefully planned file 
system to meet the needs of the particular situa-
tion is required if intelligence production is to be 
carried out efficiently and effectively. The follow-
ing practical suggestions will apply to a variety 
of conditions. 
The basic purpose of files is the full utilization 
of available data. Reference files should group 
individual pieces of information under general 
topic headings. This may seem too obvious to 
require elaboration, but the fact remains that the 
average person does not know how to develop good 
files with adequate cross referencing, and every 
intelligence activity acquires extensive collections 
of facts and data. The intelligence officer must 
be able to locate precise information when it is 
needed. One requirement is the orderly arrange-
ment of books in a reference library. 
A logical way to proceed is to survey the physi-
cal facilities available in the form of file cabinets, 
CONFIDENTIAL 
258 
card files, map and chart cabinets, and safes in 
which to stow classified reports. Within the prac-
tical limits of time and space available, the intelli-
gence officer should review the missions of his 
commander, particularly with respect to the geo-
graphical areas in which he is likely to operate, 
and then plan hs files to meet his needs in a simple 
and logical manner. In order to be prepared for 
the great variety of requests for information that 
will be directed to him, he must review his filing 
needs with some imagination and insight. 
Mere filing of information by an intelligence 
officer is not enough. He must be familiar with 
the contents of the file, and this can be attained 
only by occasional review. He should not put too 
much reliance on his ability to remember details 
with unfailing accuracy. The best of cross refer-
ence systems have their limitations. Either they 
tend to be incomplete or it takes too much time to 
compile them. Finding the right balance between 
cross indexing and an actual review of the whole 
file from time to time is a matter of experience. 
The clerical chore of filing may be left to office 
assistants to a certain extent, but no intelligence 
officer can afford to develop such an executive com-
plex that he is not intimately familiar not only 
with the filing plan he creates, but also with the 
actual filing that is done. An office that collapses 
in the absence of the filing yeoman has no place in 
intelligence activity. 
The mechanics of filing also merit attention. 
Manila folders or large envelopes with clearly 
printed labels will prove most satisfactory. 
Dividers separating groups of folders or envelopes 
under more general topics are also helpful. When 
special logs, card files, or charts are compiled, they 
should be designed with real forethought to com-
bine logical entry of information from source with 
maximum convenience in later use. Kardex files 
are frequently a help, and in large archives micro-
films and film readers are a definite advantage. 
Incoming publications and, reports should be 
handled by a routine entry in a log with appro-
priate notation to indicate routing and final dis-
position. If a general subject index is maintained, 
the new card should be made out promptly and 
the file number marked on the material. 
When material is loaned for outside use, normal 
military practice, in accordance with security reg-

ulations, requires custody cards and receipts. It 
is suggested, however, that a card or note inserted 
in the file itself will be an additional reminder of 
missing material to the individual using the files. 
The intelligence officer should use his imagina-
tion and good sense in planning his files, remem-
bering that orderliness and system pay very real 
dividends. In operational intelligence the use of 
special recording forms has been found to be ad-
visable. These will be discussed in the chapter on 
Intelligence Staff Procedures. 
Other Aids 
Visual aids such as situation maps, charts, 
graphs, and statistical tables often provide the 
best means for comparing and interpreting cer-
tain types of information. Situation maps are 
adapted to the study of relationships between ship 
and troop location and movement, attacks, logistics 
supply, production facilities, and population dis-
tribution. The influence of geographic and time 
and space factors on a current situation may be-
come more apparent as the result of the use of 
area maps on which appropriate information has 
been plotted. By such methods, enemy capabili-
ties and limitations may be further clarified. 
Charts, graphs, and tables are of assistance in 
the compiling and comparing of information re-
lating to economic and sociological intelligence. 
Periodic digests may be prepared in order to 
summarize information for which the chronologi-
cal sequence of events is important. They are also 
helpful in considering subject matter, such as 
political events, which requires more detailed data 
than could be easily included within a manageable 
series of cards. 
Mechanical Brains and Punch Cards 
New technological developments are effecting 
every type of warfare and even the processing of 
intelligence. Some involve the techniques of 
cybernetics, the use of so-called "mechanical 
brains." In simple forms, electric calculating ma-
chines are standard in most offices, and punch card 
tabulating and printing machines are used wher-
ever statistical needs develop on a large scale. 
They produce raw census data, trade statistics, and 
many industrial records. In the military field they 
259 
are used for personnel records, accounting, inven-
tory, and procurement purposes. 
Since intelligence processing may involve the 
combination, matching, and tabulation of literally 
millions of quantitative facts, the punch card and 
the machines which use it are familiar to central 
offices such as ONI or large theater intelligence 
centers. 
More recent is the rapid development of elec-
tronic machines of both analogue and digital types 
for solving involved problems. They are playing 
an important role in military research in ballistics, 
aerodynamics, and related fields, and operationally 
they do the computing required by modern guns in 
tracking targets and controlling fire. As these 
machines become physically smaller, additional 
uses will be found for them in the field. On an 
experimental basis they are already being used in 
solving problems of strategy. Intelligence agen-
cies will have the responsibility of supplying quan-
titative data in the tremendous detail needed for 
meaningful results. The "mechanical brains" can 
take raw information on enemy capabilities and 
vulnerabilities, compare it with similar data on 
our own forces, and statistically produce the 
answers that will determine the best courses of 
action to pursue. They can measure in concrete 
terms whether we should concentrate on strategic 
air attacks on the enemy's basic industry, or 
whether our targets should be military installa-
tions, harbors, or merchant shipping. The ma-
chines can accomplish in minutes what men could 
do only in months, but the machine cannot give 
an answer better than the quality of the raw data 
fed into it. Therefore, the successful application 
of these advanced techniques will be in no small 
measure due to good information. An increasing 
number of intelligence officers must become aware 
of the potential services the "mechanical brains" 
can render. 
OPERATIONS RESEARCH 
A particular application of intelligence is in 
operations research which represents a blending of 
intelligence processing and intelligence use. The 
mechanical brains and punch cards, briefly de-
scribed above, need a guiding set of principles if 
maximum results are to be obtained from them. 
Some of these principles are discussed in a work

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, 
Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, first 
published in 1944. The theory of games has led 
to the development of mathematical theories of 
strategy under the exploitation of the three mili-
tary services. This is not as strange as it seems, 
for the relationships in playing games, in business, 
and in war have certain similarities. The intel-
ligence significance of these studies is apparent in 
the quotation: "Von Neumann's theory suggests 
that the seeking of information is central to the 
nature of strategy." (Fortune "A Theory of 
Strategy," June 1949 p. 104.) Military applica-
tions of these principles were begun by ASWORG 
(Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research 
Group) and have continued to be used in other 
problems. Some of the first naval applications 
involved the problems of the pilot of an ASW 
aircraft in choosing a tracking and search pattern 
to maximize the likelihood of locating the 
submarine. 
Among the several agencies engaged in oper-
ations research, the most unique is the Rand Cor-
poration. The story of its creation and function 
has been admirably told in an article by John 
McDonald entitled "The War of Wits", published 
in Fortune magazine, March 1951, portions of 
which are quoted below: 
Rand is a creation of the United States Air 
Force. It is not, however, a government 
agency. It is an independent, non-profit or-
ganization, similar in some respects to a 
foundation but without exact precedent; and 
it has numerous consultants and subcontrac-
tors in universities and industries. Its prin-
cipal business is long-range, scientific, mili-
tary research, designed to aid Air Force 
decisions. Modern science and modern mili-
tary art are joined here in a program of brain-
work that may have considerable bearing on 
the security of the United States. 
Mr. McDonald continues with an indication of 
the wide range of the Air Force problems being 
considered by the Rand Corporation: A-bomb de-
fense, A-bomb delivery, tactical operations, and 
logistics. Many of these studies are significant 
not only to the Air Force, but also have the most 
vital implications for the entire defense establish-
ment and the nation, since they have as a govern-
ing concept the preservation of national wealth 
and resources. Rand's view is that "the cheapest 
CONFIDENTIAL 260 
way to win a war is not to have to fight one." 
The staff of this remarkable organization is as 
varied as the tasks they undertake. It is com-
posed of nuclear physicists, electronic experts, air-
craft and guided missile experts, students of lo-
gistics, political scientists, economists, sociologists, 
psychologists, astronomers, and mathematicians. 
Further quotations from the article cited above 
are equally informative: 
Rand's social scientists are making a study 
of, among other things, Soviet Russia's in-
terests, aims, and values, her -political and 
social structure, and her proba-Ole scientific, 
technical, and industrial capabilities at vari-
ous future dates; in sum, her total war poten-
tial?for the purpose in part of comparing 
these observations with the character and 
capabilities of the United States and its allies. 
But the era has passed when the techno-
logical improvements of gadgets is the only 
scientific problem of warfare. Science and 
technology are continuously coming up with 
so many and such complicated military de-
vices that even a nation as rich and advanced 
as the United States cannot afford, in terms 
of money, manpower, or available engineering 
effort, to develop all of them to their technical 
limits and produce them in significant num-
bers (this goes for the enemy too). 
Given a budget the Air Force allocates its 
resources among various activities (offense, 
defense, tactical air, etc.) to perform its over-
all mission in the best possible way. But in 
the pursuit of this mission it does not choose 
the grand strategy; its own Strategic Air 
Command is responsible directly to the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, and the button is on the desk 
of the Commander-in-Chief in Blair House. 
(This was written during renovation of the 
White House.) It cannot always choose its 
targets (as between, say, military installa-
tions, industry, and cities) ; nor its weapons, 
for weapons, too, are political. This was true 
even before the decision to drop the first A-
bomb, and has been even more decisively the 
case since then. Similarly the Air Force has 
to consider the intentions as well as the capa-
bilities of an enemy, since intentions affect 
the determination of when he will use what, 
and the question whether he will use certain 
capabilities at all. 
Rand, therefore, studies the social and po-
litical framework in which the big strategical 
decisions are made, along with the more 
strictly scientific agenda. The bulk of its 
work, however, is concerned with the alloca-
tion of resources. . . .

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: PROCESSING CONFIDENTIAL 
In the Rand analysis the target's resistance 
is defined by bracketing the enemy's expected 
capabilities at a specific time era in the future. 
The order of attack is set up against the ene-
my's assumed order of battle. The enemy's 
deployment is an intelligence problem. The 
enemy is assumed to be rational, with no holes 
left uncovered in his apportionment of de-
fenses to targets?the "no soft spot" theory, 
which is derived from the von Neumann-
Morgenstern theory of games. Rand math-
ematicians have extended the development of 
game theory as a new and challenging doc-
trine of military decision. From the solution 
of this first relatively simple bomber problem 
emerged Rand's principal research technique 
known in the shop as "systems analysis." 
There is more to offense and defense sys-
tems, however, than allocation of resources 
and specifications of weapons. The payoff of 
a strategic bombing force is what the bombs 
do to an enemy?particularly the will and 
ability to wage war, through physical, eco-
nomic, political, and psychological effects. 
Strategic bombing, for example, has a strong 
influence on the attitude of enemy popula-
tions?equal perhaps to the impact of our war 
aims. What then should be our policy on 
enemy people and their leaders? Should we 
undertake a warning system for enemy popu-
lations? What does a 90 percent target 
knockout mean in terms of productivity? 
Facts gathered by intelligence agencies are 
not of much use without a guiding concept 
with which to separate the relevant from the 
irrelevant. Designers of bombing systems 
thus have to take into account social problems 
along with the physical problems presented 
by nature. 
With such broad and varied questions in 
mind, Rand studies Soviet Russia, her inten-
tions and capabilities. It is common knowl-
edge that the United States industrial and 
general war potential is superior to Soviet 
Russia's at this time. But are they catching 
up? Does the Politburo have freedom of 
choice, flexibility, random behavior? What 
is its pattern of political behavior? How 
does the ordinary Communist have to think to 
translate doctrine into action? When attack? 
When retreat? When sound hostile? When 
friendly ? One of Rand's contributions is a 
codification of principles of action underly-
ing the Politburo's calculations, made as a step 
toward predicting what it is likely to do. 
This type of operations research, then, is just a 
variation on intelligence processing in general, 
261 
though brought to a high level of achievement for 
the specialized tasks assigned to the Corporation. 
CONTRACT STUDIES: THE FLYING SAUCER 
Rand Corporation is only one of many private 
agencies that perform specialized studies for the 
armed forces. Large contracts in many fields of 
investigation have been made by all three services, 
though by no means do all relate so directly to 
intelligence matters. One particular project 
which illustrates many of the problems of process-
ing, and which also involved contracts for anal-
ysis by a number of outside agencies, was the well 
publicized flying saucer mystery. Kenneth Ar-
nold on 24 June 1947, claimed to have seen some 
mysterious disks cavorting over the Cascade 
Mountains. Within a few days saucer reports 
poured over the news wires from all parts of the 
country. Witnesses in time included military 
pilots, weather observers, police, astronomers, and 
many ordinary citizens. That summer there were 
many wild rumors and quite contradictory reports 
on the saucers. Despite all official denials the be-
lief persisted that the saucers were real, whoever 
controlled them. 
On 7 January 1948, at Godman Field, Ky., a 
mysterious object was sighted in the sky by control 
tower personnel. Captain Thomas Mantell who 
was in the air in an F-51 gave chase, and the re-
mains of his plane were found crashed to earth. 
On 22 January 1948, the Air Force set up a re-
search project on these sightings at the Air 
Materiel Command, Wright Field. Astrophys-
icist Joseph Hynek, and the Rand Corporation 
among others, went to work to study the reports. 
Eastern Air Lines pilots, Clarence S. Chiles and 
John B. Whitted, flying a DC3 on 23 July 1948, 
west of Montgomery, Alabama, had a brief look 
at a mysterious wingless, cigar-shaped craft which 
had two rows of blue glowing ports and an orange-
red flame projecting from the tail. 
On 1 October 1948, Lieut. George Gorman at 
Fargo, N. Dak., chased a mysterious maneuverable 
light in his F-51. These gyrations of plane and 
light were watched from the ground. 
Another of the more interesting cases was that 
made public on his own responsibility by Comdr. 
R. B. McLaughlin of the White Sands Proving

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Ground. His report of a sighting on 6 April 1948, 
claimed a saucer 105 feet in diameter some 56 miles 
up had been tracked by theodolites at 18,000 miles 
per hour. There were also 2 smaller objects about 
20 inches in diameter that maneuvered around a 
fast-moving Navy missile, then passed it and 
disappeared. 
In 1950, 1951, and 1952, there were additional 
flurries of reports. \ An Air Force release in 1949 
admitted that 375 sightings had been investigated 
up to that time. The count by more recent esti-
mates is not available. 
What evaluation can be made of all these re-
ports? The first step was to interview those who 
thought they had observed saucers in order to sort 
the first hand reports from rumors and distorted 
accounts. The observations were then analyzed 
to discover any patterns of similarity. Agencies 
responsible for operations that might be confused 
with saucers reviewed all cases to eliminate easily 
accounted for phenomena. The contract groups 
and other agencies reviewed all remaining cases 
to see whether natural phenomena, astronomical 
or meteorological, or subjective reporting could 
account for what was seen. 
Large numbers of sightings could be explained 
as weather balloons, Navy cosmic ray research bal-
loons, meteors and fireballs, lightning, light re-
flected from distant aircraft, and occasionally as 
the planet Venus. Some cases were a result of 
hallucination, hoax, or hysteria. To some analysts 
there seemed to remain a hard core for which no 
CONFIDENTIAL 
262 
definite cause could be assigned positively, al-
though plausible explanations could be offered. 
Certain deductions could also be offered. If there 
were real saucers and they represented a secret 
weapon of either the United States or Russia, they 
were exposed to possible compromise by appearing 
in so many parts of the world with reckless dis-
regard for safety of cities, normal air traffic, or 
security measures. Further, their reported speeds 
and turning ability would indicate new propul-
sion and guidance systems far superior to those 
all world powers are spending billions to develop. 
Could they be from outer space? Although that 
possibility does exist, certain probabilities must 
be considered. Only Mars offers prospects of life 
similar to that on Earth and its rarified atmos-
phere and extremes of temperature would seem to 
militate against an environment that allows the 
development of higher life forms. Other stars 
may be postulated to have planets, but the im-
mense distances would reduce statistically the 
chance of our being visited. If a superior civili-
zation were spying out the earth, it would be odd 
that it would disclose its presence so many times 
without making contact. 
The flying saucer mystery must be left for the 
present as one of those tantalizing enigmas of life 
that will be discussed for a long time to come. 
This brief account by no means answers the many 
questions about the saucers, but it does illustrate 
the many possibilities for evaluation and analysis 
of this type of information.

uNFENTIAL 
CHAPTER 11 
THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: DISSEMINATION 
Dissemination is an essential phase of intelli-
gence activity. Every officer who receives intel-
ligence matter and passes it on, either for further 
processing or for the immediate use of strategic 
planners and operational commanders, partici-
pates in its operation. It is continuous through-
out the life of any essential element of information, 
beginning when the collector forwards his report, 
moving up, down, and laterally in a chain of com-
mand or processing agency, and coming to rest 
only after use by each recipient for whom it has 
value. 
Two critical factors in the dissemination phase 
of the cycle are: First, the selection of the appro-
priate action agency and other interested agencies 
which should receive the intelligence product; and 
second, the speed with which the product is trans-
mitted, as conditioned by requirements of urgency 
and security. 
There is no greater handicap to the intelligence 
function than inadequate dissemination. Intelli-
gence material should never be relegated to an 
inactive file until it has been seen by all to whom 
it may be of conceivable interest. The officer re-
sponsible for routing has the initial responsibility 
of designating action, information, and retention 
addressees, but as the material passes from person 
to person, in accordance with the security regula-
tions governing its distribution, the responsibility 
is shared by each recipient. 
The time interval between the interpretation of 
information and its receipt by the potential user 
may, in itself, determine the worthwhileness of 
the total effort of intelligence production. Even 
more, this factor of time may have a direct and 
vital bearing on matters affecting the security and 
welfare of the United States. 
The dissemination responsibilities of the intelli-
gence officer are therefore concentrated in the exer-
cise of judgment in determining who needs to 
know, how soon he should know, and by what 
means and in what form it should reach him in 
order to be most usable. These questions consti-
tute the problems of dissemination. 
DETERMINATION OF RECIPIENT 
Effective dissemination requires not only a com-
plete awareness of the significance of the informa-
tion or intelligence, but also a knowledge of the 
specific mission of organizational units. On a 
small staff the intelligence officer is well aware of 
the commander's mission and the plan of opera-
tions, and is also cognizant of incoming informa-
tion, the processing required to convert it to usable 
intelligence, and the particular needs of each staff 
planner and unit commander. Dissemination in 
such a situation is much easier than on larger 
staffs, such as that of a theater command, an in-
telligence center, or in the Office of Naval Intel-
ligence. In large organizations the responsibility 
for dissemination should rest with the officer 
supervising evaluation and interpretation, for he 
first becomes aware of the finished product. 
Check Lists 
Check lists of commands normally receiving 
each type of intelligence are indispensable aids in 
effecting complete dissemination. The lists should 
be flexible; that is, by frequent revision they should 
be expanded or reduced as changes in situation 
demand. Thus they are always kept up to date, 
and commands will not continue to receive intelli-
gence for which they no longer have need or on 
subjects in which they have no further interest. 
Operational Dissemination 
The tremendous dissemination task of an intelli-
gence unit preceding an amphibious operation is 
well illustrated by the activities of the intelligence 
officers attached to CornPhibsPac, Commander of 
the Joint Expeditionary Force which was to land 
on Okinawa in April 1945. 
A preliminary distribution of basic information, 
consisting of terrain studies, maps, charts, beach 
sketches, identification sheets, and miscellaneous 
bulletins, was made to all staffs and ships involved 
in the operation 4 months before it was to take 
place. This material, the product of months of

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
research and additional collection, contained most 
of the accumulated strategic intelligence received 
up to that time, and was intended to assist the in-
telligence officers of the various staffs and ships 
in preparing their individual intelligence esti-
mates, and to be used for background information 
in the acquiring of additional intelligence. 
The final distribution of intelligence material 
from the ComPhibsPac Intelligence Section was 
forwarded from Pearl Harbor on 23 February 
1945, and included all intelligence developed from 
the sources described previously. This distribu-
tion was a difficult problem. It was essential 
that every vessel engaged in the Okinawa opera-
tion, and those that might possibly become in-
volved, receive an adequate supply of maps, charts, 
photos, and all other prepared written matter. 
These included not only the strictly amphibious 
vessels but all the gunfire support ships, the com-
ponents of the carrier task forces, and other ves-
sels that might be designated to assist in bombard-
ment or transport of troops as reinforcements. 
The assigned vessels were staged at seven different 
bases throughout the Western Pacific and some 
were almost constantly at sea. Experience had 
clearly demonstrated that distribution by the 
echelon system was unsatisfactory, for many ships 
had complained of not receiving packages or of 
having received them months after they were 
mailed. Therefore, arrangements were made to 
fly the material by special R5D planes to the vari-
ous staging areas. One intelligence officer from 
the ComPhibsPac personally made the distribu-
tion at each staging area. He had complete lists 
of the ships and staffs involved, was in constant 
touch with ComPhibsPac, and thus was able to 
make corrections as changes took place. The 
officer was also supplied with a number of addi-
tional packages for distribution to ships which 
might be assigned at a later date. This system 
operated satisfactorily, although there were ap-
proximately 1,340 vessels and staffs engaged in the 
operation. All commands received an adequate 
supply of intelligence material. 
With proper security provisions and detailed 
instructions, copies were forwarded to port direc-
tors, island commanders, and a few other impor-
tant commands for possible later distribution to 
reserve units and ships assigned at the last moment 
CONFIDENTIAL 264 
because of unforeseen emergencies. A large sup-
ply of extra copies was furnished to the amphib-
ious group intelligence officers for emergency dis-
tribution. Previous experience had indicated that 
there always were unforeseen requests for intelli-
gence material, and these emergency measures 
enabled all participating units to obtain the needed 
intelligence regardless of the date or location when 
they received orders to proceed to the objective. 
TIMELINESS 
Timeliness in distribution of information and 
intelligence is vital to the efficient functioning of 
every intelligence agency. Its attainment, of 
course, will be controlled to a certain degree by 
the means of dissemination available and the secu-
rity classification of the subject matter. Naval 
Regulations stipulate that telecommunications 
should never be used when mail and messenger 
services will serve the purpose. The spirit of this 
general rule can be followed in the dissemination 
of intelligence, for certainly all intelligence mate-
rial is not of sufficient urgency to require trans--
mission by radio, and often its length or bulk pre-
eludes the use of sitch means. Discrimination and 
judgment must therefore be applied by the intelli-
gence officer in all matters affecting the speed of 
dissemination. He needs a working knowledge of 
the naval communications system. 
Often the collector in both foreign and domestic 
fields will not have United States naval commu-
nication facilities available. In such circum-
stances his knowledge of other means available 
should be equally thorough. An attache, for 
example, should know the best procedures for for-
warding all types of reports, including commer-
cial radio and telegraph, postal services, and the 
schedules of State Department couriers. Classi-
fied information, of course, is never entrusted to 
foreign mail systems, but commercial radio in 
foreign countries may be used for the transmis-
tion of encrypted messages. 
Naval Telecommunications for Dissemination 
An intelligence officer with the Fleet will receive 
and disseminate a great portion of his intelligence 
material by radio. He must understand the de-
livery characteristics of each type of communica-
tions and the effect of the various degrees of pre-

cedence. The communications channel used must 
be suitable for reaching the addressees within the 
time required and in accordance with security 
regulations governing the handling of the subject 
matter of the message. In all such matters, of 
course, the expert advice of the communications 
officer should be solicited and his recommendations 
followed. 
For any given operation, the Communications 
Plan, usually an annex to the Operation Plan or 
Order, allocates radio frequencies in accordance 
with fleet frequency plans. Frequencies are allo-
cated for particular uses; for example, there will 
be one or more for reporting enemy contacts, for 
shore fire-control parties, for CAP aircraft, etc. 
The Communications Plan also prescribes control-
ling publications, effective date and time zones, 
crypto-systems to be used, and the procedures for 
radio telephone messages, visual communications, 
recognition, identification and authenticity, radio 
and radar countermeasures and deception, and the 
conditions of radio and radar silence. 
Message Precedence 
Once the intelligence officer is convinced that a 
particular item of intelligence must be transmitted 
by radio message, he must also decide which degree 
of precedence is required. Precedence establishes 
the order for the handling and delivery of mes-
sages. It should be determined by the subject 
matter and the time factor involved. There are 
currently six degrees of precedence: 
(1) FLASH is reserved for enemy contact reports 
or reports designed to prevent imminent 
conflict between friendly forces. 
(2) EMERGENCY is used for amplifying reports 
and operational messages of high priority; 
e. g., attack orders, warnings of enemy 
attack. 
OPERATIONAL IMMEDIATE is used for opera-
tional messages, i. e., those that will or may 
affect movements of ships, aircraft or 
ground forces within 48 hours, except ordi-
nary movement reports which cannot be 
classified as urgent; e. g., Operation Orders, 
aircraft movement reports, changes in 
tactical disposition. 
PRIORITY is the highest precedence that can 
be given to administrative (non-opera-

DEFERRED means that delivery can be de-
layed until the beginning of office hours 
following the day when filed. 
To specify high precedence when a lower degree 
is sufficient destroys the value of precedence, tends 
to demoralize communications, and frequently 
delays messages of great urgency. In one case 
during World War II an operational priority 
message from COMINCH to the commander of a 
task force in the Atlantic was delayed 61/2 hours 
and finally was received too late to serve its pur-
pose. Investigation revealed that there had been 
110 other operational priority messages waiting 
to be transmitted on the Fox schedule that after-
noon. Scarcely a dozen were of sufficient urgency 
to justify the precedence which they carried. 
An Army experience further illustrates the ex-
tremes to which misuse of precedence can go. A 
staff headquarters received a priority message 
addressed to two officers who could not be located, 
so a message was sent to the originator requesting 
instructions for delivery. The reply explained: 
"The two officers are on their way and will arrive 
in a couple of days." 
High precedence is not necessarily the best way 
to get prompt action. Precedence is a guide for 
communications personnel, not for addressees. It 
is better to ask in the text for prompt action rather 
than to use precedence in such a way as to delay 
messages of greater urgency. 
Reproduction 
The timely dissemination of certain types of in-
telligence material to multiple addresses will often 
depend on the facilities an intelligence agency has 
available for reproducing it in quantity. Such 
requirements should be anticipated, and the 
agency should provide itself with the necessary 
reproduction machines together with personnel 
trained in their operation. Mimeographs, multi-
liths, or contact printers are indispensable aids 
in intelligence centers, and even small units in the 
field will find frequent use of portable machines 
of this type.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
CLASSIFICATION 
A discussion of adequate and timely dissemina-
tion cannot proceed very far before meeting the 
problem of classification. Although marking 
classified information and material Top Secret, 
Secret, or Confidential, will insure safeguarding 
consistent with its content, the misapplication 
of classification can also be a definite handicap to 
proper dissemination. It will be well here to 
review the principles of classification as set forth 
in the United States Navy Security Manual for 
Classified Matter particularly in respect to their 
application in intelligence activity. 
Top Secret 
In the Top Secret category, the security aspect 
is paramount, and unauthorized disclosure could 
cause exceptionally grave damage to the nation, 
such as initiation of war against the United States 
by a foreign government, defeat of planned war 
operations, and loss of a scientific or technical 
advantage which would materially affect the 
course or outcome of a war. 
The following items of military information are 
hence graded Top Secret: 
1. War plans and plans or particulars of future 
major or special war operations, and related 
dispositions of our forces. 
2. Intelligence documents (and information 
therein) which reveal a major intelligence 
effort on the part of the United States and 
from which unauthorized recipients would 
be able to evaluate the capabilities of our 
intelligence services. 
3. Critical information of radically new and 
extremely important equipment or other mu-
nitions of war. 
4. Information primarily political or economic 
which contains implications comparable to 
items 1, 2, and 3. 
Secret 
Classified as Secret are information and mate-
rial whose unauthorized disclosure could result in 
serious damage to the nation, injure national inter-
ests or prestige, or would be of great advantage 
to a foreign nation. 
The following items are examples: 
1. Particulars of operations in progress or 
planned. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
266 
2. Instructions regarding the employment of 
important new munitions of war, including 
scientific and technical developments. 
3. Important improvements to existing muni-
tions of war under development. 
4. Information of enemy or potential enemy 
material or other material, procedure, dis-
positions, and activities, whose value de-
pends upon concealing the fact that we pos-
sess it. 
5. Reports of operations containing informa-
tion of vital interest to the enemy. 
6. Vital military information on important 
defenses. 
7. Adverse reports on general morale affecting 
major operations. 
8. Communications intelligence information, 
including security devices. 
9. Certain new or specialized techniques or 
methods to be used in future operations, and 
the identity and composition of units which 
will employ them. 
10. Information concerning strength of troops, 
air and naval forces, identity and composi-
tion of units, or quantity of specific items 
of equipment in active theaters of operation. 
11. Photographs, negatives, photostats, dia-
grams, or models of Secret matter. 
12. Certain compilations of data or items which 
in the aggregate warrant the higher classi-
fication, although individual items may be 
classified Confidential or lower. 
Confidential 
The Confidential category is used for informa-
tion or material the unauthorized disclosure of 
which could be prejudicial to the defense interests 
of the nation. 
Examples include: 
1. Matters, investigations, and documents of a 
counterintelligence nature, or matters whose 
disclosure would adversely affect morale. 
2. Routine operational and battle reports 
which contain information of value to the 
enemy but are not of vital interest to him. 
3. Routine intelligence reports. 
4. Military radio frequency allocations of spe-
cial significance, or those which are fre-
quently changed for security reasons.

CYCLE: DISSEMINATION CONFIDENTIAL 
mating the threat to national security if the in-
formation should reach an enemy. Erring on the 
safe side is out of the question, because neither 
side is perfectly safe. Overclassification is one of 
the surest ways to undermine security, as was well 
illustrated in the Pacific during World War II. 
At one time 90 percent of message traffic was 
marked Secret. It was impossible to observe the 
precautions required for its handling, since so 
many people had to work with Secret messages. 
The number of copies exceeded all reasonable lim-
its, and subject content was widely discussed. The 
inevitable result was that Confidential and Re-
stricted messages were treated almost as if they 
were unclassified. 
A second result of overclassification is that the 
key setup used for Secret messages becomes over-
loaded, thus endangering the security of both the 
key and the system. A third consequence is the 
delay in dissemination caused by the time required 
for encryption, decryption, and maintenance of the 
receipt system. 
Among the kinds of information commonly 
overclassified during the war were intelligence 
summaries of past action and messages about ship 
movements in nonoperational theaters. Confiden-
tial, as noted in the definition above, is sufficient 
for routine intelligence reports. No gain in 
crypto-security is achieved by using a higher clas-
sification than the content of the message warrants. 
The prime purpose of high classification is to limit 
the number of persons who may see the messages 
or reports and to increase the physical safeguards 
with which they are surrounded. The dissemina-
tor must determine the number of persons who 
must have the information. 
Underclassification, of course, endangers secu-
rity. During the war, messages which identified 
fleet commands or shore-based activities were 
sometimes delivered unclassified to the communi-
cation office. Unclassified reports and requisitions 
sent to navy yards by ships of the fleet at times dis-
closed their location and prospective movements. 
In combat situations emergencies arise when 
speed of dissemination requires plain language. 
Such a situation occurred during the North Afri-
can campaign, as recounted in the battle report 
of the U. S. S. assachusetts. One of the spotting 
planes from the flagship off Casablanca encoun-
tered "bandits" and signalled over voice radio: 
267 CONFIDENTIAL

5. Information which indicates strength, iden-
tity, composition, or quantity of equipment 
of troops, air and naval forces in areas ad-
jacent to active theaters of operations. 
6. Technical documents and manuals used for 
training, maintenance, and inspection of im-
portant new munitions of war, and the gen-
eral tactical lessons learned in operations 
which should be withheld from any foreign 
nation. 
7. Information relating to the design and de-
velopment of new material, research or 
processes of manufacture of military sig-
nificance which are not generally known. 
8. Department of Defense information and 
records concerning industrial mobilization 
for war, including specific quantities of war 
reserves. 
9. Photographs, negatives, photostats, dia-
grams, or models of Confidential matter. 
10. Certain compilations of data or items which 
in the aggregate warrant the higher clas-
sification, although individually of lower 
classification. 
Restricted Category Abolished 
In accordance with the directives set forth in 
Executive Order No. 10501 effective 15 Dec 1953 
the category "Restricted Security Information" 
and the phrase "Security Information" previously 
required in connection with the categories listed 
above were eliminated. This order further pro-
vided that all Department of Defense information 
designated "Restricted Security Information" 
would be automatically declassified except in cer-
tain instances where it was felt necessary to up-
grade to Confidential. For example information 
from foreign friendly governments and classified 
Restricted by those governments is now upgraded 
to Confidential. The same is true of material 
related to Crypto systems. 
"Restricted Data" as used by the Atomic Energy 
Commission was not affected by Executive Order 
#10501.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
"Am coming in on the starboard bow with couple 
hostile aircraft on my tail. Pick 'em off?I am the 
one in front !" 
DISSEMINATION MEDIA 
Thus far the only dissemination medium dis-
cussed has been telecommunications. A number 
of others are equally common to intelligence activ-
ity, such as oral briefings, graphics, films, books 
and. periodic publications, not to mention the in-
formal conferences that are daily occurrences in 
any intelligence agency. Each has its particular 
advantages and disadvantages in special circum-
stances. 
Oral Dissemination 
Intelligence is disseminated orally by means 
of lectures, briefings, conferences, and ship's tele-
phone or radio conversations. Public telephones 
ashore, of course, are never used for intelligence 
communication. Except in a formalized situation 
or classroom, lectures are not ideal means of dis-
seminating intelligence. Retention of subject 
matter, presented in lecture form, is difficult with-
out reference to comprehensive notes, and the lack 
of a lecture room and difficulties of assembling all 
who need to know combine to make the lecture 
method unsuitable in commands afloat. 
Briefing, a specialized form of lecture, is one 
of the most common types of oral dissemination of 
intelligence. It will be discussed in detail below. 
The staff conference, in which the intelligence 
officer participates, provides an excellent means 
of disseminating intelligence. If conducted in a 
spirit of open-mindedness, free from petty prej-
udice, bias, or predetermined conclusion, the con-
ference discussion results in resolution of conflict-
ing bits and fragments of information. Panel dis-
cussions, followed by open forum question periods, 
are also effective methods of dissemination. 
Under actual combat conditions, or in maneu-
vers and training exercises, communication by 
voice, radio, or telephone is used. For quick dis-
semination of intelligence to pilots awaiting final 
instructions from an Air Intelligence Officer, com-
munication by a telephone system from intelli-
gence control to ready room, is often more expedi-
ent than the personal appearance of the briefing 
officer. The principles and practices that have 
CONFIDENTIAL 
268 
been developed in ships' battle phone systems fur-
nish a good background for intelligence dissemi-
nation by telephone. 
Whatever form oral dissemination takes, it is 
essentially a more or less prepared speech deliv-
ered to an audience, and it is subject to the general 
rules for effective public speaking. 
Briefing for Dissemination 
An officer planning an oral briefing is under the 
same obligation to organize his material logically, 
present it coherently and fluently, and emphasize 
his main points unmistakably, as the preacher, 
the politician, the professor, or the salesman. 
The sages of old said that man's greatest enemy 
is time. A pertinent paraphrase would be: time 
is the briefing officer's greatest enemy. We have 
all been irritated by the speaker who begins by 
deploring the fact that so little time is available 
for an adequate presentation of his subject and 
then proceeds to use 90% of what time is available 
in undue attention to unnecessary and often ir-
relevant details. The intelligence officer will 
always face a time limitation on his briefing. It 
is his greatest challenge. Careful organization 
is the key to success. In an 8-minute briefing, the 
time allocation for a well organized presentation 
should be about as follows: 
Introduction: 2 minutes. 
Rapport is established with the audience, the 
purpose is clearly stated, and necessary back-
ground information is given. 
Main Body: 5 minutes. 
The fewer main points the better. Certainly in 
5 minutes no more than 3 can be adequately cov-
ered. Transition from one to another should be 
smooth and logical. This is the portion of the 
briefing in which graphics are effective time savers. 
Organization is the watch-word. 
Conclusion: 1 minute. 
Every briefing should close with a succinct sum-
mary or interpretation of the points in the main 
body, thus leaving the audience with the definite 
impression that the speaker's purpose has been 
achieved. 
A colored preacher when queried as to the reason 
for his effective sermons summed all this up very 
neatly: "First I tells 'ern what I's gonna tell 'em, 
den I tells 'em, den I tells 'em what I told 'ern."

THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: DISSEMINATION CONFIDENTIAL 
Practice and receptivity to criticism are the best 
aids to effective speaking. The avoidance of dis-
tracting mannerisms, and the cultivation of an 
easy, simple, straightforward, and confident style 
are essential. Every naval officer ought to be able 
to speak well. To the intelligence officer it is a 
functional asset. 
Graphics for Dissemination 
Dissemination through the use of graphic illus-
tration achieves its purposes by the precept of the 
old adage: "A good picture is worth a thousand 
words." Although illustrations have been used 
for centuries, and maps and charts are as old as the 
art of warfare, new impetus was given to the use 
of graphic aids during World War II. In addi-
tion to printed and written representations, the 
term "graphics" has come to include three dimen-
sional figures such as models of ships, aircraft, 
terrain, cutaway sections, animated figures, and 
life-size mock-ups. Plots, photographs, motion 
pictures, maps, charts, sketches, drawings, posters, 
statistical graphs, and numerical tables are ad-
ditional standard military applications of graphic 
dissemination media. Their success results from 
the fact that each is adapted to a particular 
situation. 
Clarity in graphic presentation will be achieved 
if it is unified in purpose, consistent and unmis-
takable in use of symbols, and legible in details. 
Its force and attractiveness will depend, like its 
clarity, on adherence to fundamental principles 
of effective design. 
Nothing contributes more to the clarity of any 
graphic presentation than unity of purpose. In-
telligence charts should be prepared for a specific 
purpose; every item of information useful for this 
purpose should appear, and all other items should 
be suppressed. A chart that shows harbor in-
stallations should not be unnecessarily cluttered 
with notations of irrelevant buildings and topo-
graphic details; a target folder designed for use 
by bombing squadrons is not usually improved by 
including elaborate hydrographic data. 
In military graphic presentation, symbols are 
of the utmost importance. The intelligence offi-
cer spends considerable time working with plots 
and maps and charts; he should be thoroughly fa-
miliar with the technical vocabulary of this kind 
269 
of graphic expression, and should be careful 
always to employ the accepted military and naval 
symbols so that any trained person can read his 
plot or overlay at a glance. Every chart for dis-
semination should have a key to the symbols em-
ployed, readily legible in the margin. Naval offi-
cers should familiarize themselves with the sym-
bol manuals: FM 21-30 and AFM 55-3. 
Graphics, like any other form of dissemination, 
should be convincing and attractive as well as 
clear. Emphasis is achieved by bold lettering, 
strong, solid outlines, and by the use of simple 
and strongly contrasted colors for the different 
items of information plotted. Attractiveness is 
increased by varigated and properly proportioned 
lettering and by the choice of harmonious colors. 
A common fault is trying to put too much on a 
single graphic; it is usually better to use several, 
rather than to clutter up one. 
When the graphic is to be projected on a screen 
as a "slide," the added factors of legibility at a 
distance and the adequacy of available equipment 
must be considered. The intelligence officer can-
not usually control the conditions under which 
motion pictures are made, but he can control the 
conditions under which they are shown, and he 
should make these conditions as favorable as 
possible. 
Preparation for Graphics 
It is not practical here to discuss all the possible 
methods of preparing graphics in intelligence 
work, but a few suggestions regarding certain 
materials that have proved effective can well be 
made. Common tools are pictorial symbols made 
by colored pencils, colored pins, colored string, 
colored scotch tape, and various types of trans-
parent materials. 
Cellulose "Scotch" tape, both the transparent 
type and the colored, is very useful in graphic 
presentations. The colored type can be employed 
for border and area demarcations on a map or 
overlay, for bar graphs, and for artistic line bor-
ders of the entire graphic. The tape is manufac-
tured in a great variety of colors, blue, red, black, 
green, orange, yellow, purple, silver, and brown. 
The rolls come in several widths, but experience 
has shown the most practical for graphic purposes 
to be 1/2",34" and 11/2".

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
"Scotch" double-coated tissue tape, being adhe-
sive on both sides, facilitates the use of movable 
symbols on a changing situation plot. Masking 
tape can be used in the construction of portable 
(folding) plots, or for joining together several 
graphics into a composite whole. 
In order to avoid markings on the face of maps 
and charts that are being used for either briefings 
or graphic displays, clear transparent cellulose 
acetate overlays may be used. Usually, such ace-
tate film comes in rolls 40" wide, and 100' long. 
China-marking (grease) pencils, in a variety of 
colors, are particularly appropriate for graphics, 
especially when used on a cellulose acetate overlay 
for depicting changing situations. The tracings 
can be easily removed with a dry cloth if made on 
the glossy side of the sheet. 
Illustration boards, both of heavy paper and 
light cardboard, have many uses, such as making 
formal graphics requiring good white background, 
or for map or chart backing. The "boards" are 
3/4" thick and usually come in two sizes, 30" x 40" 
and 38" x 60". 
Such items as thumb tacks, a pencil compass, 
erasers, photointerpretation scales, a protractor, 
speedball lettering pens, a knife or a pair of scis-
sors, and various colored inks are additional items 
of equipment for the preparation of good graphics. 
Most of these are readily available at Navy supply 
centers or depots. 
If graphic production is very extensive, time 
will be saved by employing a Leroy lettering set. 
With such a set it is possible to give graphics a 
professional appearance. 
Inasmuch as requirements differ, it is difficult to 
make recommendations as to the quantities of ma-
terials or equipment needed. Operational staffs 
will need a lot; attaches will need very little. The 
intelligence officer must try to anticipate his needs, 
and particularly if afloat, should procure a good 
supply of basic materials from any supply depot 
where they are available. 
FORM OF DISSEMINATION 
Disseminated intelligence should always reach 
its potential consumer in usable form. There 
should be no doubt as to its meaning. The pre-
vious discussion of reporting showed that the 
format and guiding principles of accuracy, brev-
CONFIDENTIAL 
ity, and clarity in the preparation of the standard 
Information Report are designed for the user's 
benefit. Let us extend that discussion here by 
considering the drafting of messages. The prin-
ciples set forth are again those of unity, complete-
ness, coherence, and emphasis with special 
attention to economy in the use of words. 
Unity and Completeness 
Intelligence messages, just as information re-
ports, are most easily handled by the recipient if 
they deal with single rather than multiple sub-
jects. Filing is facilitated if all pertinent intelli-
gence on a certain matter is included in one 
message. A message which does not give all the 
necessary facts may be little better than no mes-
sage at all, especially in a combat situation. A 
contact report which omits the number, types, 
position, course, or time of sighting (the time 
group of the message) is better than no report, but 
each of these facts is needed to carry out an attack. 
During 1943 an enemy submarine was able to 
sink one of our ships and escape from American 
waters because of incomplete messages and failure 
to send messages. The submarine might have 
been destroyed before it could do damage had any 
one of the following errors not occurred: 
1. A plane reported rescue of survivors, but 
failed to give time of attack, position of the attack, 
the course of the sub, or its condition. 
2. Another plane neglected to make an amplify-
ing report, and wasted time asking a question to 
which it should have known the answer. 
3. A third plane failed to give the sub's position 
and did not communicate with a plane which was 
in a position to assist. It also failed to make 
amplifying reports promptly, in sufficient detail, 
and in plain language instead of code. Speed was 
vital, and the information was of little value to 
the enemy. 
270 
Coherence 
Ambiguity of expression in a message is not only 
valueless but dangerous. Misunderstood intelli-
gence can lead to catastrophe. During the final 
month of the war in the Pacific, a task group made 
radar contact with an unidentified submarine. 
All efforts at recognition failed for visibility was 
poor, but the submarine gave indications of being 
hostile. At this point one of the destroyers in

bunnDENTIAL 
THE INTELLIGENCE CYCLE: DISSEMINATION 
the task group received a message from the task 
group commander which was understood to state: 
CLOSE TARGET EVALUATION IS ENEMY 
ATTACK AND DESTROY. The destroyer at-
tacked and the target disappeared. Later it was 
discovered that the sub was one of our own. What 
the message actually said was: CLOSE TARGET 
AND IF EVALUATION IS ENEMY DE-
STROY IT. 
Brevity 
Both the speed and security of naval communi-
cations are in the hands of originators to a far 
greater extent than many realize. The originator 
who uses 50 words to express what could be clearly 
stated in 25 causes, in the aggregate, not hours but 
days of unnecessary work along the entire route 
of an encrypted message. He also damages secu-
rity, for the amount of material available to enemy 
crypto-analysts is doubled. 
There are several ways to reduce the length of a 
message: 
1. Eliminate nonessential details. 
2. Remove superfluous words, such as "number," 
"following," and "dated," for example, in-
stead of "FOLLOWING ITEMS NEEDED 
COLON" say "NEED," which represents an 
85% word saving. A submarine on patrol in 
the eastern Mediterranean transmitted a ra-
dio message in which the words "north" and 
"east" were used 18 times in giving positions. 
All 18 words could have been omitted, for 
there is no south latitude in the Mediter-
ranean, and west longitude is confined, to a 
far western portion. 
3. Use briefer words and phrases. The length 
of many messages can be reduced as much as 
40-50% by consistently using the simpler and 
briefer of two expressions that are equally 
clear. The following are typical: 
Instead of Use Save 
attempt  try  57% 
immediately  at once  45% 
approximately twenty  about twenty  42% 
immediate future  soon  73% 
A simple way of saving words in a message is 
by putting verbs in the active rather than the pas-
sive voice. Prepositions can often be eliminated 
with no sacrifice of meaning. 
271 
4. Use authorized abbreviations to a greater ex-
tent and avoid excessive use of phonetic spell-
ing. 
5. Delete unnecessary punctuation. The use of 
the simple "X" will normally be equally 
clear. 
Message Drafting in Practice 
Let us now apply some of the above principles 
in an imaginary situation and follow the proce-
dures of an intelligence officer in his role of dis-
seminator. 
The setting is Calcutta, India, early in World 
War II. An allied intelligence activity of the 
CBI theater has a competent Burmese undercover 
agent in Japanese occupied Rangoon who reports 
twice a week on enemy activities on the waterfront. 
The information thus obtained is promptly for-
warded by encrypted message to the A-2 of the 
10th Air Force at a base in Chabua, Assam, for 
possible use in selecting targets for strategic bomb-
ing missions. In a report dated 18 March, the 
Rangoon agent states that 2 days ago he saw a 
large number of vehicles and great quantities of 
supplies for the Japanese forces in Burma un-
loaded from ships and stored in warehouses along 
the Irrawaddy River. This is interesting to be 
sure, but in its present form it does not constitute 
valuable target information because of its lack of 
detail. Supplies are continually arriving in Ran-
goon and are normally stored in warehouses along 
the Irrawaddy at a great number of widely scat-
tered locations. So first of all the Calcutta intelli-
gence unit requests the Rangoon agent to obtain 
more specific data. In a few days an amplifying 
report is received, and on the basis of this addi-
tional information the officer responsible for dis-
semination of target intelligence writes the first 
draft of a message to A-2, Chabua 
"Following information received from usually 
reliable agent resident Rangoon: Japanese war 
materials stored in warehouses adjoining former 
docks of Burma Shell Oil Co. include 80-85 heavy 
trucks, 23 sedans, 3,000 tons shells and cartridges, 
and approximately 10,000 tons of food and cloth-
ing for Japanese troops." 
The report now contains detailed target infor-
mation. He proceeds to examine his first draft 
with a view to condensation. A-2, Chabua, has

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFIC ERS 
prepared a large scale gridded map of Rangoon 
and has provided the Calcutta unit with a copy 
for use in target designation. Therefore the spe-
cific location can be given by map reference as 
had been done in similar messages in the past. 
Consulting the map, the Calcutta officer finds that 
he can pinpoint the Burma Shell warehouses at 
8237N4. So he makes further improvements: 
"Usually reliable agent Rangoon reports ware-
houses located eighty two thirty seven Nan four 
contain colon three thousand tons ammunition 
comma ten thousand tons quartermaster supplies 
comma approximately one hundred vehicles pe-
riod" 
Once again he studies the text for possible fur-
ther economy of words. His colleagues in the 
code-room are always complaining about the chore 
of encrypting messages which are unnecessarily 
long, so he makes every effort to satisfy them. 
All Allied intelligence activities have been 
using the standard letter-number evaluation code, 
and A-2, Chabua, knows from past experience 
that Calcutta receives reports from agents in Ran-
goon whose reliability and reporting accuracy 
have been well established by past performance. 
A-2 will, however, want to know the date the 
information was collected, in order to check it 
with other information he may have, or it may 
well be that, unknown to Calcutta, bombers of the 
10th Air Force hit the same dock area on a mission 
within the last 24 hours. Furthermore, A-2 will 
consult his map and note that the grid location is 
that of warehouses. So after some more amend-
ing, abbreviating, and deleting the final draft of 
the message text reads: 
RANGOON ONE SIX MAR BAKER TWO 
X EIGHT TWO THREE SEVEN NAN 
FOUR X THREE THOU TONS AMMO X 
TEN THOU TONS QM SUPPLIES X 
ABOUT ONE HUN VEHICLES. 
He takes it to the code-room. "Here, Joe, is 
one that will please you. Make it 'Operational 
Immediate.'" 
Thus by careful drafting the disseminator sends 
a message that is complete, accurate, coherent, 
and economical in words and encryption time. 
A-2, Chabua, has usable intelligence for the com-
mander of his B-24 squadron.

USE OF INTELLIGENCE 
The example above is illustrative of more than 
message drafting. It also follows an item of in-
formation through the steps of the Intelligence 
Cycle. Collection was not complete until ade-
quate coverage was attained, and some of the 
mental gymnastics of processing were apparent 
as the officer kept reworking his draft into proper 
form for dissemination. 
The use of the finished product is, of course, the 
responsibility of the squadron commander in 
Chabua. The decision to make a strike against 
the Rangoon warehouses rests with him alone. 
Therefore, it would seem that the intelligence offi-
cer's functions stop with dissemination. In a 
larger sense, however, this is not true. Certainly 
A-2 does not make the command decision, but he 
plays a most important role in influencing the 
decision through the quality of the intelligence he 
provides. The very form in which it reaches the 
potential user, and the timeliness achieved 
through proper designation of precedence are 
vital factors in use. 
Intelligence officers do not perform their duties 
in support of command by sitting aloof in their 
own little worlds. They are on a staff team, and 
operational commanders as well as strategic plan-
ners make their decisions during or after confer-
ences with staff officers who are experts on the 
various aspects of the tasks under consideration. 
This puts the intelligence officer very much in the 
picture when decisions are made, and working 
intimately with his staff colleagues, he contributes 
support in his particular sphere of responsibility: 
knowledge of the enemy and the characteristics 
of the area of operations. His responsibilities 
do not cease even when the intelligence he dis-
seminates has been used, for the use itself will pose 
new problems in collection and evaluation, and 
post-action reports must be compiled. 
In the three following chapters the role of in-
telligence in support of planning and operational 
activities will be considered. The discussion? 
however, will not be limited to use alone. Any 
review of the use of intelligence will involve its 
production to a greater or lesser degree, since use 
activates and reactivates production.

CHAPTER 12 
INTELLIGENCE STAFF PROCEDURES 
INTRODUCTION: INTELLIGENCE-A STAFF FUNCTION 
Having made a general examination of intelli-
gence as knowledge, organization, and activity, 
it will be well now to consider the specific ways in 
which intelligence makes its contributions to the 
planning and execution of military operations. 
By what formal procedures is intelligence sup-
plied in an actual operational situation ? What 
specific techniques do intelligence officers use in 
order to make their services of value to operational 
commanders? 
The Commander and His Staff 
Traditionally, the key to all military operations 
is the authority of command personified in the 
military commander. He bears the full responsi-
bility for the success or failure of all operations 
entrusted to him, and because of that responsibil-
ity, he also possesses full authority to plan those 
operations and, supervise their execution. 
Manifestly, it would be impossible for a single 
individual, however well endowed, personally to 
perform all of the tasks involved in a typical mod-
ern military operation. Consequently a com-
mander has under him other individuals to whom 
he delegates one or more of the component parts 
of the broader task originally assigned to him. 
These individuals in turn may have subordinates 
to whom they will delegate certain portions of 
their own assigned tasks. Thus a structure is built 
up which we term the military chain of command, 
a device that provides a commander with the 
assistance he needs. After delegating appropriate 
areas of responsibility to each of his subordinates, 
the commander must plan, coordinate, and super-
vise their execution of these responsibilities. 
Even this supervisory role, however, except at 
the lowest echelons of command, is more than any 
one individual can carry out alone. There are 
273 
just too many things to inspect, too many orders 
to issue, and too many subjects on which to be kept 
informed. And so, in addition to his subordinates 
in the chain of command, the commander also has 
the assistance of certain individuals who help him 
to coordinate and supervise the actions of his sub-
ordinates. These personal assistants are known 
as the commander's staff. In contrast to the sub-
ordinates in the chain of command, the members 
of the commander's staff do not possess any dele-
gated authority or responsibility of their own. 
Their only purpose is to serve the commander per-
sonally and directly, and to assist him, as he may 
choose, in exercising the various supervisory 
responsibilities which his command entails. 
The number of these staff assistants, and to some 
extent their organization and individual duties, 
ordinarily varies in proportion to the size of the 
commander's forces. But over the years a fairly 
standard staff organization has been evolved with-
in the military profession which breaks down the 
duties performed by a commander's staff into sev-
eral customary and well-recognized categories. 
Traditionally there are four principal staff func-
tions: personnel and administration, intelligence, 
plans and operations, and supply. On an Army 
staff, for example, these four functions are per-
formed by what are called the "general" (in con-
trast to the "special") staff officers, who are desig-
nated G-1 (Personnel and Administration), G-2 
(Intelligence), G-3 (Operations), and G-1 (Sup-
ply). Naval commanders also have staffs which 
correspond roughly to these same designations, 
though with some changes. On some naval staffs, 
for example, intelligence may not be a separate 
staff division, but only a subordinate section under 
operations. On naval staffs communications is 
ordinarily an additional "general" staff function, 
on a par with operations, supply, and personnel.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
But whatever the precise organization of the naval 
commander's staff may be, all staffs perform the 
same basic duties, and all exist to help the com-
mander discharge his supervisory responsibility. 
Besides these staff assistants who help the com-
mander in his operational functions, he usually 
has one or more personal aides, depending on his 
rank. On a naval staff these are the /lag lieuten-
ant and the flag secretary. Depending upon the 
size of the staff they may also have other opera-
tional staff duties, with the flag lieutenant perhaps 
serving as communicator, and the flag secretary 
as personnel and administrative officer. The struc-
ture of a typical naval staff is shown in figure 12.

Figure 12.?Organization Chart?Typical Naval Operating Staff 
Each individual staff officer is highly qualified 
in some specialized field relating to military oper-
ai ions. The personnel officer, for example, is an 
expert on such matters as military strengths, re-
inforcements, replacements, etc.; the operations 
officer is a specialist in the strategy and tactics 
involved in planning and conducting military op-
erations; and the supply officer is an expert on 
matters of equipment and material needed to sup-
port operations. Within the field of his own 
specialty each staff officer is expected to keep his 
commander fully informed on all developments 
relating to the operations in question, to do what-
ever detailed thinking and planning are required, 
and to make sound recommendations for action by 
the commander himself. Within the area of his 
specialty the staff officer should put himself men-
tally in the place of his commander and ask him-
self, "what would you do if you were the com-
mander?", and then come up with the best possi-
ble answer. 
Yet the final decision can only be made by the 
commander himself. The staff assistant proposes, 
CONFIDENTIAL 
274 
the commander disposes. However, the staff offi-
cer should have familiarized himself so thoroughly 
with his own field, and should have anticipated 
and discussed all the implications involved in the 
recommendation he makes so completely, that the 
commander is able to make the actual decision with 
a minimum of further effort. This is what is 
known professionally as completed staff work; that 
is, presenting a military proposal to a commander 
in such a way that he needs only to signify his 
approval to put the proposal into full effect. To 
a considerable extent the success of any military 
commander will be in direct ratio to the thorough-
ness and accuracy of the work of his staff. 
The Intelligence Officer on the Staff 
The intelligence officer's field of specialty is a 
dual one?the enemy and the area of operations. 
No military operation can be successfully planned 
or carried out unless a commander is as fully aware 
as possible of what he is up against. The enemy's 
strength, his dispositions, his capabilities, his fire-
power, his reserves?all of these are factors that 
are bound to affect the course of action a military 
commander will adopt. Without such information 
he is literally fighting in the dark. It is the job 
of the intelligence officer then to inform the com-
mander of what the enemy has and what the enemy 
can do, in order that the commander can make the 
soundest and wisest decision as to how to accom-
plish his own mission. Similarly, the nature of 
the terrain in which an operation is to be con-
ducted?the beach conditions, the weather, the 
location of high ground?will have an important 
bearing on the final decision, and information on 
those matters must also be furnished to the com-
mander well in advance. This is also the job of 
the intelligence officer. 
While the military staff is thus a collection of 
experts, each man dealing principally in his own 
specialty, it does not follow that the actual exer-
cise of military command can be compartmental-
ized in any such precise fashion. After all, every 
one of the separate factors which bears on a mili-
tary decision must ultimately be brought together 
in the mind of the commander before any final 
decision can be made, and the end product is thus

INTELLIGENCE STAFF PROCEDURES CONFIDENTIAL 
bound to be the result of the combination, com-
parison, interaction and mutual adjustment of all 
of them. Consequently, although a military staff 
is functionally broken down into specialized units, 
none of these units can really function at top effi-
ciency without the fullest cooperation and mutual 
understanding of the others. The intelligence of-
ficer, for instance, must keep constantly abreast 
of the planning and thinking that is being done by 
the operations, supply, and personnel officers if his 
own work is to be entirely relevant to theirs; they, 
in turn, cannot make adequate plans as to what 
special equipment may be needed in an operation, 
or what types of attack can succeed, without hear-
ing and understanding what the intelligence officer 
has to say about the enemy situation and the 
peculiar characteristics of the area of operations. 
Between operations and intelligence this mutual 
dependence is especially close, a fact that is borne 
out in the case of those naval staffs where the 
intelligence officer is a direct subordinate of the 
operations officer. 
Organization of an Intelligence Division 
The work for which the intelligence officer is 
personally responsible is actually performed, of 
course, with the help of such subordinates and 
assistants as may be assigned to him, organized 
into what is called an intelligence "division." The 
size of the intelligence division as well as its pre-
cise structure will vary a good deal, depending on 
the size of the command and the nature of its 
assignment. On an operational staff the intelli-
gence division may include specialists trained in 
the particular types of operations being con-
ducted; a naval district intelligence office, on the 
other hand, will be likely to have a preponderance 
of counterintelligence personnel. Ideally, the in-
telligence division of an operational staff ought to 
include some one in charge of administration and 
personnel, some one in charge of security and 
counterintelligence, and a number of specialists 
in such fields as amphibious warfare, communica-
tions, air operations, photointerpretation, transla-
tion and interpretation, and technical intelligence. 
In practice, since all but the very largest com-
mands may have at most only three or four officers 
275 
in the whole division, especially in peacetime, one 
officer may find himself charged with several of 
these duties, whether he happens to be a specialist 
in them or not. In such an event, when he meets 
a problem which he is not personally equipped to 
solve, he should consult those who may be, or in 
technical matters, request expert assistance. 
THE PROCESS OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND 
As a staff assistant, the intelligence officer exists 
entirely to serve his commander in the execution 
of operational command duties. To do a full and 
effective job, therefore, the intelligence officer must 
understand first of all precisely what these com-
mand duties entail. 
Two major functions are involved in military 
command: (1) planning the operation desired, and 
(2) supervising the execution of those plans. 
These two functions, in turn, may be broken down 
into four specific jobs which a commander per-
forms in the process of exercising his command: 
(a) make the decision on what is to be done, (b) 
develop the plan for carrying out that decision, 
(c) issue the directive or order putting the plan 
into effect, and ( d) supervise the execution of the 
directive by subordinates in the "chain of com-
mand." These four jobs embrace the four major 
steps in the process of operational command plan-
ning. At each stage the responsibility of the com-
mander is clear and well-defined. 
Estimate of the Situation 
The first and perhaps most important job of a 
military commander is to make decisions?in fact, 
not only to make decisions but to make correct 
decisions. Because making decisions is essentially 
a mental process, the quality of a commander's 
decisions will naturally depend to a considerable 
extent on his own sagacity. For this reason no 
precise mathematical formula can ever supply the 
key to making correct military decisions in all 
possible circumstances. Nevertheless, over the 
years the military profession has developed the 
following standard Estimate of the Situation form 
for use in connection with these decisions which 
every commander is expected to understand and, 
more or less, to follow.

a. What the force is going to do 
b. Why this is to be done 
This estimate form, which grew originally out 
of a process first employed by the German general 
staff in the latter part of the 19th century, has now 
been officially adopted by the Joint Chiefs of _Staff 
for use by all military services, and can be found 
in detail in the Naval Manual of Operational 
Planning. By itself, .of course, the Estimate of 
the Situation form does not insure that any com-
mander who faithfully follows it in every detail 
will automatically come up with right decisions 
in any and every situation. Rather the form 
serves as a kind of check-off list, to guarantee only 
that before a commander arrives at any important 
decision he will have first considered every relevant 
factor. Although it may seem somewhat stylized 
and artificial, the procedure involved in this Esti-
mate of the Situation actually is not too much 
different from that employed by any rational indi-
vidual in arriving at an important decision in 
everyday life. 
As will be seen from the above form, the initial 
step in the estimate procedure is to state the mis-
sion assigned to the commander by higher head-
quarters. Ordinarily this amounts to nothing 
more than copying the commander's original in-
structions; but at least the statement of the mis-
sion should include both the specific task assigned 
to the commander by his superiors, and the pur-
CONFIDENTIAL 
276 
pose (which may either have been stated or can 
be inferred) for which that task was assigned. It 
is important that a military commander under-
stand both of these points clearly at the very out-
set. Otherwise, in the process of carrying out 
his assigned task, he might conceivably do some-
thing that would jeopardize its broader purpose. 
The next step is to compile all the relevant in-
formation which might bear on the accomplish-
ment of this assigned mission, including, specifi-
cally, (a) a resum6 of the general situation out 
of which the specific assignment has evolved, (b) 
a summary of all the facts about the area in which 
the operations are to be conducted, and (c) a sum-
mary of the military strength of both our own 
forces and those of the enemy, together with a 
tabulation of the principal elements of strength 
and weakness on both sides which emerge from this 
information. 
Following this general summary, the commander 
next makes a list of all those things which the 
enemy can be considered to be physically "capable" 
of doing, given the forces at his disposal and the 
particular area in which he is to operate. These 
are what are known in the military profession as 
enemy capabilities, and in the commander's Esti-
mate of the Situation they are customarily ex-
pressed as specific objectives which the enemy will

WITTAAGENUE STAFF PROCEDURES CONFIDENTIAL 
try to accomplish, without reference to whatever 
opposition our own forces might interpose to their 
accomplishment. 
Once the enemy's capabilities have been listed 
in this way, the commander next puts down in 
equally general terms the various broad courses 
of action which his own forces might undertake 
to accomplish the assigned mission. The whole 
point of the estimate form, in fact, is to arrive 
finally at a decision as to which of these several 
possible courses of action open to the commander 
is the best one; but at this stage all that is required 
is to survey and set down in concise form each of 
the alternatives from which a final choice will 
later be made. 
After this the form moves on to a kind of mental 
"war-game" between each enemy capability on 
the one hand, and each course of action open to 
our own forces on the other. In this way it be-
comes possible for a commander to visualize ex-
actly what would happen in each combination of 
circumstances. No prudent commander certainly 
would want to make a decision on a course of ac-
tion for the forces under him until he had tried 
to foresee as fully as possible all of the implica-
tions and consequences of that decision. The best 
way to do this, of course, is to visualize what would 
happen if first one course of action and then an-
other were adopted. And that is precisely what 
the "war-gaming" procedure involves. Each 
friendly course of action is pitted in turn against 
each separate enemy capability. If the original 
selection of enemy capabilities and of own courses 
of action was carefully and thoroughly done, all 
of the possibilities which should be considered by 
a prudent commander before a decision is reached 
will have been covered in the process. 
Next are tabulated the respective advantages 
and disadvantages which this "war-gaming" has 
shown accrue to each of the alternatives open to 
the commander. For example, it may have been 
shown that one course of action would be highly 
successful if the enemy adopted a particular one 
of its capabilities, but most disastrous if the enemy 
were to adopt any other capability. On the other 
hand, a second course of action might be visualized 
as relatively successful no matter which capability 
the enemy adopted. This is just the sort of corn-
277 
parison which should help in making a final deci-
sion. By setting these comparative advantages 
and disadvantages down in tabular form, the best 
course of action may become directly apparent. 
At any rate, the commander's final decision could 
then be made in the light of a full understanding 
of just what he stands to gain or lose. 
The commander is now ready to take his final 
step, the decision itself. On the basis of the anal-
ysis just completed, he must select the one course 
of action?or in some cases the combination of 
several?which strikes him as being the best from 
all points of view to accomplish his mission. The 
statement of this course of action is itself the 
decision, and as such is listed in the fifth and final 
paragraph of the Estimate of the Situation form. 
In the standard form, the decision, like the mis-
sion, must be expressed in two parts. The first 
part is the course of action decided on, for exam-
ple, "to seize X-ray Island." Following this 
should come the words "in order to" plus a restate-
ment of the original mission set down at the start 
of the estimate. Thus a typical decision might 
read as follows: "To seize X-ray Island, in order 
to establish a base for further operations against 
Japan." In this way the final paragraph of the 
estimate form is tied in directly with the opening 
paragraph, and illustrates how, as a result of the 
thought processes involved in the body of the esti-
mate itself, the commander has moved from an 
assigned mission to a specific decision as to how 
that mission is to be accomplished. That, of 
course, was the initial purpose in undertaking the 
estimate procedure. 
There is really nothing mysterious or particu-
larly strange about this Estimate of the Situation. 
It is no substitute, of course, for mental activity 
or alert thinking. It cannot transform a man into 
a military genius simply by virtue of being prop-
erly applied. But its careful use by a naval com-
mander will assist him to avoid either overlooking 
or underestimating any significant bit of informa-
tion that might conceivably bear on the soundness 
of his ultimate decision. That in itself is enough 
to recommend it in any complicated or crucial 
military operation. 
In some cases experienced commanding officers 
may not actually write out a full formal estimate

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
in the manner just described before arriving at a 
decision. For these officers the estimating process 
may involve simply an oral discussion between 
themselves and the members of their staffs, out of 
which, after due deliberation, the final decision 
emerges. But the important point is that even in 
oral discussions of this kind the prudent com-
mander must see that each of the significant fac-
tors listed in the standard estimate form is actu-
ally covered either by his staff in their own pres-
entations or, at least to his own satisfaction, by 
his own personal thinking. 
At any rate, whether the estimate is developed 
in written or in oral form, the responsibility of 
the commander and his staff officers is the same. 
Each staff officer must supply certain parts of the 
information called for by the estimate. The in-
telligence officer, for example, must supply the 
information about the enemy's strength, his capa-
bilities, and the area of operations. The opera-
tions and logistics officers must supply informa-
tion about the strength of the commander's own 
forces, and recommend suitable courses of action 
to accomplish the assigned mission. When it 
comes to the "war-gaming" portion, the pitting of 
own courses of action against enemy capabilities, 
all of the staff officers will probably participate in 
the discussion. To that extent, then, the final 
decision, although still the immediate responsi-
bility of the commander alone, is actually a group 
product of the commander and his staff, working 
harmoniously as a single military "mind." 
Development of the Plan 
With the broad decision out of the way, the next 
job of a military commander is to draw up detailed 
plans for putting that decision into practical 
effect. The plans are developed as follows:

INTELLIGENCE STAFF PROCEDURES 
Logically, the first thing to do is to determine 
what specific component operations must be per-
formed to achieve the broad, generalized goal 
stated in the decision. A decision to capture a 
particular island, for example, would involve such 
component operations as preattack reconnaissance, 
combat loading, movement to the objective area, 
air and surface screening of the movement, and 
gunfire support of assault troops. Whatever the 
overall objective, its accomplishment will always 
involve a number of smaller, more specific tasks 
which the successful commander must thoroughly 
canvass in advance. After that he should organize 
the forces at his disposal in such a way as to per-
form these operations most effectively, and then 
assign appropriate tasks to the various subdivi-
sions of this organization. 
Besides the combat operations themselves a com-
mander will at this stage also want to anticipate 
the various supporting details involved, such as 
what supplies he will need, and when and how he 
must get them; how and where he will exercise his 
command; what communications procedures will 
be most suitable for the operation; what addi-
tional intelligence is needed for more effective 
planning; and what information is to be distrib-
uted to his subordinates to insure their intelligent 
execution of their assignments. All of these de-
tails should be foreseen at this early stage, because 
the more detailed the advance planning, the more 
smoothly the operation will be executed. Indeed 
this particular phase of the command process is 
especially designed to provide a smooth transition 
from the generalities of the command decision to 
the concise details of the operational directive 
which will eventually implement it. In some cases 
this planning will be written out along the lines 
indicated in the format. In other cases it may con-
sist simply of rough notes in the possession of the 
commander or various members of his staff. But 
unless the planning has been actually done in one 
way or another, the directive that sets the opera-
tion in motion will certainly suffer. 
Issuing the Directive 
After the preliminary planning comes the prep-
aration and issuance of the directive. Here the 
commander usually has no option; the directive

any assumptions involved) 
2. General Plan paragraph (state what is to be accomplished by the inte-
grated efforts of the command as a whole and why?in other words, 
restate the commander's original decision) 
3. Task paragraph (assign individual tasks to each subdivision listed in 
the task organization above, plus such other tasks as may be common to 
all subdivisions) 
4. Logistics paragraph (indicate the availability of supplies and services, 
and the general plan for logistic support of the operation)

the exercise of command during the operation, such as, location of the 
commander and the second in command, communications procedures, 
zone time to be employed, etc.)

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
The directive creates the task organization, for-
mally assigns component tasks to the various sub-
divisions of this organization, makes provision 
for the performance of all necessary support func-
tions, establishes times and schedules, and supplies 
subordinate commanders with such supplementary 
information as they may need to perform their 
jobs properly. Incidentally, this supplementary 
information is usually not set forth in the body of 
the directive itself, but is included in a series of 
annexes attached to the directive. These annexes 
may include details on any aspect of the directive 
which needs elaboration; for example, the task 
organization, movement plan, battle plan, com-
munications plan, the logistics plan; or, as in the 
case of the intelligence annex, they may supply 
subordinate commanders with pertinent informa-
tion about the enemy and the area of operations, 
plus appropriate instructions for collecting during 
the operation itself such additional information 
as may be desired. 
In the operational planning that leads up to 
the issuance of a directive of this kind, there is 
often a persistent element of uncertainty regard-
ing one or another point that bears closely on 
the success of the plans being formulated. In 
developing defensive plans, for example, there 
may be doubt as to the direction from which the 
enemy will be likely to strike, or, in the case of 
offensive plans, it may not be known whether 
certain necessary reinforcements will actually be 
available in time to take part in the offensive. In 
cases such as these it is often the practice for a 
commander and his staff to do their preliminary 
planning, including even the issuance of the ap-
propriate directive, on the basis of certain assump-
tions with regard to these missing details. (See 
"Development of the Plan," item 2.) When this 
is done, the assumptions made must be clearly 
indicated as such. As its name implies, an as-
sumption in military planning refers to a certain 
condition or situation, either unknown or cur-
rently contrary to actual fact, which for the pur-
poses of planning is assumed to be true. Thus 
in the case of an unknown quantity, like the di-
rection of an impending enemy attack, one plan 
CONFIDENTIAL 
280 
might be drawn up on the basis of the specific 
assumption that the enemy will attack from the 
south, while an alternative plan might be devel-
oped on the basis of the contrary assumption that 
he will attack from the north. Then as events 
disclose which of these two assumptions is true, 
the commander can also determine which of his 
alternative plans should govern his actual opera-
tions. Or, to take the case of an assumption pres-
ently contrary to fact, that reinforcements not 
now on hand will become available, the com-
mander might elect to put his plan into effect as 
soon as the assumption becomes true, or to discard 
it if circumstances show that the assumption will 
not become true. 
Naturally, a prudent commander will want his 
plans to be broad and flexible enough to cover as 
many contingencies as possible. This operational 
directive, then, will be issued with the understand-
ing that it is to be carried out?unless expressly 
rescinded?no matter what subsequently develops. 
The commander will hope that his thinking and 
planning have been thorough and extensive 
enough to encompass all reasonable developments. 
In that case the commander makes no assumptions 
in his planning, because every assumption limits 
the flexibility of his plan and to that extent weak-
ens it. This kind of directive becomes effective 
upon receipt, and is known as an operation order. 
On the other hand, the commander may prefer 
to draw up his directive in tentative form, involv-
ing one or another assumption, and issue it with 
the understanding that it will become effective 
only on later notification, usually after the matter 
covered by the assumption has been clarified by 
subsequent events. In that case the directive will 
be called an operation plan. The only difference 
between an operation order and an operation plan 
is that the latter includes one or more assumptions 
(specifically mentioned in the general situation 
paragraph) and is effective only on later signal, 
while the former contains no assumptions and is 
usually effective on receipt. Once an operation 
plan is put into effect it functions in exactly the 
same way as an operation order, and therefore, on 
all other points, the operation plan should follow

the same format as the order, and should convey

direction of the commander's subordinates. 
vising the Planned Action 
Finally, the operational commander must super-
vise the execution of the action which he has pre-
viously decided on, planned, and ordered into exe-
cution. Even the best-laid plans, however, can 
go awry, and uncertainty and contingency are 
rarely more in evidence than in the conduct of 
military operations. A combat commander, there-
fore, must keep a careful eye on the actual progress 
of his operation so as to be ready to alter his 
original order whenever circumstances dictate. 
There are four main developments, all of which 
can occur on any battlefield, that justify a change 
in the original order. There may have been some 
error or misunderstanding; there may be a change 
in the enemy's situation, or at least in what is 
known about it; there may be a change in our 
situation, some ship may have run into unexpected 
difficulties, or some reinforcements may have failed 
to show up; or, finally, there may be a change in 
the mission assigned by higher headquarters, per-
haps as a result of a new situation confronting the 
superior. In each of these cases, the commander 
must make a decision on the spot as to how to 
change his original order to meet the altered cir-
cumstances. In the heat of battle, of course, there 
is rarely time for lengthy reflection or elaborate 
checking and rechecking. Presumably, in such 
circumstances, a commander will automatically 
make a mental estimate of the situation and then 
issue his revised orders. Still, the degree to which 
even these spot decisions made under difficult com-
bat conditions are successful will be determined by 
the extent to which the commander, in more 
leisurely circumstances, has already mastered the 
various planning procedures outline here and 
made them a part of his normal mental habits. 
INTELLIGENCE IN THE BASIC DECISION 
In the light of these four steps which an oper-
ational commander must go through in carrying 
2619-54-19 
281 
out his command responsibilities, just where do 
intelligence and the intelligence staff officer fit in? 
Actually intelligence has a specific job to perform 
for the commander at each of these stages, and 
each one of these specific jobs involves a standard 
formal pattern which corresponds to a step in the 
command process itself. These four jobs, and their 
relationships to the stages of the command process, 
are shown in the following table: 
Commander 
1. Estimate of the situation. 
2. Development of the plan. 
3. Preparation of the directive. 
4. Supervision of the action. 
Intelligence Officer 
1. Intelligence estimate. 
2. Intelligence collection plan. 
3. Intelligence annex. 
4. Running intelligence estimate. 
Just as the four stages of the command process 
form a special kind of cyclical procedure which 
is repeated in the case of every new decision that 
comes up as an operation progresses, so the four 
steps outlined for the intelligence officer also con-
stitute a pattern which include within it the phases 
of the familiar intelligence cycle applied to the 
planning and execution of actual operations. 
Intelligence Estimate 
In connection with the commander's estimate of 
the situation the intelligence officer's job is to sup-
ply all of the information concerning the enemy 
and the area of operations. This information is 
submitted by the intelligence officer on a form 
called an intelligence estimate. In practice the 
intelligence estimate, like the commander's esti-
mate, may under certain circumstances comprise 
only an oral summary. But the following stand-
ard form for it has been established and is usually 
followed in assembling the pertinent information, 
regardless of whether it may eventually be pre-
sented orally or on paper.

Also like the commander's estimate, the intelli-
gence estimate begins with a statement of the com-
mander's basic mission?which, of course, governs 
all pertinent planning?together with a statement 
of the general situation to which that mission ap-
plies. Both items are essential guideposts in se-
lecting what information should go into the 
estimate under its various headings.

Thus in compiling information concerning the 
enemy's situation and the area of operations, it 
is important to remember that an estimate is not 
an encyclopedia; coverage must be adequate, but 
it must also be distinctly limited to the specific 
mission at hand. In addition, each item of in-
formation dealing with the area of operations 
should be followed by some brief statement or

conclusion indicating succinctly the practie 
effect of that information on any military o, _ a-
tions that might be conducted in the area. As far 
as possible the same should be done in the case of 
data relating to the enemy's situation. This sec-
tion should include a complete order of battle of 
enemy forces involved, and special attention should 
also be given to time and space factors, that 
is, to careful estimates of where the enemy can 
move in what particular period of time. These 
factors, if worked out with care, will prove ex-
tremely helpful later on in determining enemy 
capabilities. 
Under "strength and weakness factors" the net 
effect of all the information thus far developed is 
summarized insofar as it bears on the strength or 
weakness of the enemy to conduct military opera-
tions in the area involved. It is sometimes helpful 
in discussing enemy weaknesses to mention also 
any specific vulnerabilities that may have ap-
peared. The statement of an enemy "vulnerabil-
ity" differs, incidentally, from the statement of a 
"weakness" in that it should be phrased in terms of 
the military action which might take advantage 
of the specific weakness in question. For example, 
an enemy weakness might be listed as a long and 
overextended supply line. One way to take ad-
vantage of such a weakness, of course, would be to 
direct heavy air strikes against these lines. 
Therefore, the enemy would be said to be "vulner-
able" in this respect. In other words, while weak-
ness and vulnerability are closely related as 
concepts, in expressing "vulnerabilities" the in-
telligence officer has carried his thinking one step 
further in the direction of facilitating his com-
mander's eventual decision. 
Enemy Capabilities 
The intelligence estimate culminates in its third 
paragraph with a statement of "enemy capabili-
ties." Like the enemy capabilities which appear 
in the commander's estimate of the situation, these 
capabilities represent all of the courses of action 
which the enemy is "capable" of undertaking in 
the future, and which, if undertaken, would affect 
in one way or another the successful accomplish-
ment of our own mission. 
From the point of view of planning these capa-
bilities are the central core of the intelligence 
283 
estimate. They are dealt with in considerable 
more detail than in the commander's estimate, and 
their formulation is the most exacting task the 
intelligence officer has. For here he is not merely 
collecting and cataloguing bits and pieces of in-
formation, but must pull the bits and pieces to-
gether, along with whatever preliminary conclu-
sions or inferences may already have been made, 
into some meaningful and coherent prediction of 
future enemy activity, on the basis of which his 
commander can then make a sound operational 
decision. Since capabilities are so important to 
the whole process of command planning, it is 
absolutely essential that the intelligence officer 
understand clearly what they involve. 
Ideally, a military commander can make a 
sound military decision only if he first knows 
exactly what the enemy forces opposing him are 
going to do. Armed with such foreknowledge, 
he could then dispose his own forces in such a 
way as to achieve maximum effect; without that 
knowledge he runs a greater or lesser risk of 
failure. Unfortunately, this brand of prophetic 
foreknowledge is rarely available to real (as dis-
tinct from ideal) human beings, and even more 
rarely is it available to those engaged in military 
operations. For even more than most types of 
human endeavor, military operations are shrouded 
in a cloud of uncertainty or inadequate informa-
tion, not merely about the enemy, but about our 
own forces as well, a situation which the famous 
military philosopher Clausewitz termed "the fog 
of war." 
It is the intelligence officer's responsibility to 
dispel this fog insofar as it concerns the enemy, 
and, traditionally, the notion of "capabilities" has 
been the device by which he has attempted to do 
so. Briefly, here is how it works. Since he can-
not say with certainty what the enemy is going 
to do, at least he can determine all of the things 
which the enemy is capable of doing. Then, if 
his calculations have been careful and thorough, 
the course which the enemy actually does select 
will be among those considered. If, in addition, 
the intelligence officer can also determine the de-
gree of probability that the enemy will adopt one 
rather than another of these capabilities, or, in 
other words, their order of relative probability, 
he will actually have gone a good way towards

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
reducing the area of uncertainty about the future 
that attends any command decision, even if he has 
not been able to predict with absolute certainty. 
Capabilities vs Intentions 
At first it might appear that a somewhat less 
complicated solution to this problem of predicting 
an enemy's future actions is available simply by 
pinpointing the enemy's intentions. It might be 
argued, for example (and with some merit), that 
although a myriad of courses are theoretically 
open to the enemy, only one can actually be se-
lected. To take all of these theoretical possibili-
ties into account before a command decision is 
made, therefore, is wasteful both of time and sub-
stance. Hence why not concentrate instead on 
what the enemy intends or wants to do rather than 
on what he is capable of doing? 
This concentration on intentions does have a 
certain plausibility, but on closer inspection it 
turns out to be deceptive. In the first place, in-
formation about enemy intentions, since it neces-
sarily involves the mind of the enemy's high com-
mand, is the most difficult of all to obtain; hence 
the likelihood of a deduction based on solid evi-
dence rather than on some "hunch" is compara-
tively slight. Secondly, intentions, even when 
accurately known, are by nature always subject 
to change. Even when the commander is so for-
tunate as to have accurate word of the enemy's 
intentions as of a certain moment in time, there is 
always the possibility that some later development 
may force the enemy to alter his plans and con-
centrate instead on some other course of which he 
was equally capable but which, until then, he had 
not been disposed to favor. Thus by focusing his 
attention exclusively on the single course of action 
which the commander is convinced that the enemy 
intends to follow, and as a result disregarding 
other courses of which the enemy was also entirely 
capable, any slightest error in the commander's 
information or any last-minute change in the 
enemy's plans would prove completely disastrous. 
From the vantage point of hindsight some com-
mentators have even suggested that the defeat at 
Pearl Harbor was the result in part of this kind 
of preoccupation with enemy intentions instead 
of capabilities: convinced that any Japanese strike 
would be directed to the south, we did not pay 
CONFIDENTIAL 
284 
adequate attention to their alternative capability 
of striking eastward. 
In some exceptional cases it is possible for a 
commander to get good information about enemy 
intentions, and in such cases he would be making 
a grave error not to act on it. A classic example 
is the Battle of Midway, in World War IL Tipped 
off from secret sources as to Japanese intentions 
to strike at Midway, Admiral Nimitz deliberately 
ignored a continuing Japanese capability to strike 
once again towards Australia, and shifted all of 
his limited carrier forces north to the Midway 
area. That decision, of course, paid off heavily, 
but even so it involved a calculated risk, not only 
that the information was reliable and had been 
properly translated and evaluated, but also that 
the information was not deliberately leaked out 
as part of a planned deception effort. 
Similarly, Stalin is reported to have made the 
fateful decision in November 1941 to reinforce 
his Moscow defenses at the expense of his Man-
churian border positions mainly on the strength 
of inside information from the Sorge espionage 
ring that the impending Japanese move would be 
south against the Americans and the British rather 
than north against the U. S. S. R. 
Indeed, on the highest level of military planning 
a concern with intentions as well as capabilities 
is probably inevitable, partly because it is unlikely 
that a potential enemy will make any last-minute 
change in basic national policy, and partly because 
at the topmost level any comprehensive survey of 
capabilities is likely to cover so wide an area that 
it becomes almost meaningless without some addi-
tional information as to the specific direction (or 
in other words, the "intent") of the enemy's cur-
rent planning. In terms of capabilities alone, for 
example, the Soviet Union and her satellites could 
be said to be capable of striking against the free 
world at almost any of a great number of points 
along a vast perimeter. Since it would be mani-
festly impossible for us to fortify all of these spots 
equally well, we must therefore have some addi-
tional information as to whether the Soviets actu-
ally intend at the moment to exercise these capa-
bilities, and if so, precisely where.

officer with enemy intentions in place of capabili-

INTELLIGENCE STAFF PROCEDURES CONFIDENTIAL 
ties is a risky business, it is equally true that a 
mere listing of capabilities will usually make the 
picture of the enemy situation too broad and gen-
eral to be of any real help in operational planning. 
There is a solution to this dilemma. It lies in 
supplementing the bare listing of capabilities the-
oretically open to the enemy with an appraisal of 
their relative probability of adoption. In this 
way the intelligence officer and his commander 
can focus more of their energy and attention in 
some specific direction without at the same time 
entirely disregarding all other alternatives. 
The evidence that can be used to determine these 
relative probabilities need not be as specialized as 
that which is necessary to pinpoint a clear enemy 
intention. Any direct "pipeline" to the enemy's 
high command would, of course, supply substan-
tial objective evidence pointing to an increased 
probability for one rather than another capability. 
But so too would any number of other types of 
circumstantial evidence, such as troop movements, 
or the construction of defense fortifications. The 
only restriction here is that arranging theoretical 
capabilities in some specific order of probability 
demands more than just a hunch; some real, ob-
jective evidence must be available, and the char-
acter of that evidence should be clearly described 
in the paragraph of the intelligence estimate which 
deals with capabilities. Without such evidence, 
the intelligence officer can only report that no 
evidence is available to indicate the relative prob-
ability of one capability over another. 
"Adoption" vs "Accomplishment" 
How is the statement of any enemy capability 
actually phrased in the intelligence estimate? 
What are the terms used to express it? To an-
swer these questions, it is necessary to review 
briefly the basic purposes which this notion of 
"capabilities" serves in the military planning 
process. 
An enemy capability has already been defined 
above as a course of action which the enemy is 
physically capable, with the forces at his disposal, 
of undertaking (irrespective of whether he will 
or will not undertake it) , and which, if under-
taken, would affect?either favorably or unfavor-
ably?the accomplishment of a commander's own 
mission. In formulating these capabilities no 
consideration is given to any opposition by our 
own forces. They are entirely "unopposed" capa-
- bilities. 
It is important for a commander to understand 
the enemy's capabilities in order to make his own 
decision accordingly. It is equally important for, 
them to be known to the commander's subordi-
nates, so that they may be prepared for whatever 
actions may be taken against their own particular 
forces during the course of the actual operation. 
In either case, it would seem only common sense 
to express these capabilities as specifically and 
exactly as possible. Ordinarily, careful answers 
are required to the following four questions : what? 
where? when? and in what strength? It is not 
enough to say simply that the enemy is capable of 
launching an attack with motor torpedo boats; if 
possible, that statement should also include some 
indication of where the attack can take place, 
when or after what time it can occur, and in what 
strength the enemy can launch it. Thus a capa-
bility might more helpfully be stated: "Attack 
with up to 40 motor torpedo boats at any point 
north of Cape Henry at any time after 1600 on 27 
June." Whenever the pertinent information to 
answer one or another of these specific questions 
is not available, that fact should simply be noted 
in the statement of the capability itself. Thus, 
for example, without specific information on num-
bers, the capability above would be stated as fol-
lows: "Attack with an unknown number of motor 
torpedo boats at Cape Henry at any time after 
1600 on 27 June." 
The chief responsibility of the intelligence 
officer here is to reduce the broad area of uncer-
tainty_as much as possible. Even if exact infor-
mation as to how many boats are likely to 
participate in such an attack is missing, it may 
still be possible to indicate at least some broad out-
side limits, with the use of such terms as "with at 
least" so many boats, or "with up to" so many. 
Even when the limits are broad, the planners are 
still better off than they would be without any 
information at all. 
Incidentally, in connection with air operations 
there is a somewhat specialized procedure for ex-
pressing these specific details. Air capabilities, 
whether offensive or defensive, are of two kinds: 
maximum strength and sustained effort. The 
285

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
maximum strength, as might be supposed, is ex-
pressed in terms of the total number of aircraft of 
certain types which are capable of operating over 
the area in question. Sustained effort capability, 
on the other hand, is measured in terms of the fre-
quency with which the aircraft available to the 
enemy can attack on a continuing basis. It is cal-
culated, according to a carefully devised formula, 
in terms of "sorties," or in other words, the num-
ber of flights which the enemy can make over the 
target and return within some fixed period of time, 
usually 24 hours. In calculating the sortie factor, 
distances of different aircraft from the target, 
cruising speeds, turn-around times on the ground, 
and normal rates of attrition for aircraft in sus-
tained operations must all be taken into account. 
No such preciseness as this is required when it 
comes to incorporating these statements of enemy 
capabilities in the commander's own estimate of 
the situation. His problem, after all, is to decide 
on some broad general course of action for his own 
forces, leaving specific details to the plan and the 
directive. Since the commander's decision must 
be a general one, the several "own courses of 
action" theoretically available to him to accom-
plish his mission, from which he must select the 
best, must themselves be expressed in general 
terms. This means that the enemy capabilities, 
which have to be pitted or "war-gamed" against 
these "own courses of action" in the commander's 
estimate of the situation, must also be equally 
broad and general in their formulation, if the 
"war-gaming" process is to be meaningful at all. 
Yet, as has just been seen, enemy capabilities as 
formulated in the intelligence estimate are highly 
specific and precise. Some device, then, is needed 
to bridge the gap between the statement of enemy 
capabilities in the intelligence estimate, and the 
statement of enemy capabilities as they subse-
quently appear in the commander's estimate. 
This is achieved by expressing enemy capabil-
ities in the commander's estimate in what are 
called "terms of accomplishment ;" that is, in 
words that designate the broad general result or 
objective which the enemy will be trying to accom-
plish,' while in the intelligence estimate, on the 
other hand, enemy capabilities are expressed in 
terms of adoption, that is, in words designating 
specific and individual courses of action which the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
286 
enemy is capable of initiating or adopting, without 
regard for the broad objective he may be trying to 
accomplish. 
Such words as "destroy," "interrupt," "sink," 
for example, are words which designate a com-
pleted result or accomplishment, while such words 
as "attack" and "strike" designate an action that 
is adopted without implying the results it may or 
may not accomplish. By employing this "accom-
plishment" phraseology it becomes possible to boil 
down a sizeable number of "adoption" capabilities 
from the intelligence estimate into a single one 
for use in the commander's estimate and that 
means, of course, that the job of "war-gaming" 
enemy capabilities against own courses of action 
becomes a much simpler matter than it would 
otherwise be. For example, an intelligence esti-
mate might list a motor torpedo boat capability, 
an air attack capability, a submarine capability, 
a coastal defense gun capability, etc., each with 
different specific components of when, where, and 
in what strength. Yet all of these individual 
"adoption" capabilities might conceivably be di-
rected toward the same broad result, for example, 
to "destroy our amphibious force prior to the 
ship-to-shore movement." In that case, the latter 
would amount to a single "accomplishment" capa-
bility of the enemy, which could then be used by 
the commander in his own estimate of the situa? 
-
tion for determining his ultimate decision. 
This distinction between "adoption" and "ac-
complishment" capabilities often confronts stu-
dents with one of their greatest difficulties in un-
derstanding the estimate form. Actually, most 
of the difficulty is probably semantic, with words 
suggesting a greater distinction than actually ex-
ists. As long as the intelligence officer under-
stands the necessity for "boiling down" the half 
dozen or so specific capabilities that he has come 
up with in his own estimate into two or three more 
general capabilities for use in the commander's 
estimate, he should find no practical difficulty in 
this distinction. The boiling-down job may be 
done by the intelligence officer himself after the 
intelligence estimate has been submitted, or it may 
emerge out of informal discussions which the 
whole staff conducts on the individual capabilities 
originally worked up by the intelligence officer. 
In either case the enemy's situation is the only

proper guide. Both types of capabilities are "un-
opposed," that is to say, they are formulated 
without regard for whatever opposing effect our 
own forces may be able to offer, which is some-
thing that is considered, of course, at a later point 
in the commander's estimate. 
The discussion of enemy capabilities in the in-
telligence estimate involves three distinct stages. 
First, the various "adoption" capabilities are 
identified and listed, as specifically as the available 
information warrants. In the second stage each 
individual capability is discussed, a process that 
normally covers three things: (1) the effect of the 
capability, should it be adopted by the enemy, 
on the accomplishment of our own mission; (2) 
the relation of the capability to other enemy capa-
bilities; that is, whether it can be adopted along 
with certain other capabilities, or whether its 
adoption precludes the adoption of others; and, 
(3) what objective evidence is available to indicate 
the relative probability of adoption. In the third 
stage the capabilities previously identified are re-
listed in the order of the relative probability thus 
deduced. Any boiling down of these various 
"adoption" capabilities into "accomplishment" 
capabilities for insertion directly into the com-
mander's estimate of the situation is not a job 
that is normally done within the conventional 
framework of the intelligence estimate itself. 
Strategic Intelligence Estimates 
Before leaving the subject of intelligence esti-
mates generally and the contribution they make 
towards basic military decisions, a brief additional 
word is in order with regard to the form which 
these estimates should take in the case of strategic 
situations. 
In the foregoing discussion the intelligence esti-
mate has been described as it applies to a typical 
operational situation, where some specific opera-
tional mission has been assigned to a naval com-
mander. Many times, however, important deci-
sions of a military nature must be taken in times of 
peace, when no actual operations against an 
"enemy" are involved, such as those relating to the 
deployment of defensive forces, or the rate of mili-
tary production, or the type of recruitment pro-
gram to be instituted. Circumstances which pro-
voke decisions of this type are customarily referred 
to in military parlance as "strategic" situations. 
The former chapter on the components of intelli-
gence knowledge indicated the tremendous variety 
of strategic problems. 
In strategic situations no less than in opera-
tional ones, however, it is imperative that com-
mand decisions be made on the basis of the best 
information available concerning the potential 
enemy and the potential area of operations. And. 
so there is a need for strategic intelligence esti-
mates. At the same time the somewhat specialized 
character of strategic situations dictates certain 
differences in the format of strategic estimates 
from that already prescribed for operational 
estimates. 
For one thing, since no hostilities are involved, 
there can be no "mission" to govern the prepara-
tion of the estimate and determine what material 
should or should not be included. Instead the 
strategic intelligence estimate customarily opens 
with a statement of the specific problem or question 
posed by the strategic planner or other authority 
which requests the preparation of the estimate. 
Ordinarily this will have something to do with the 
military capacity or potential of some foreign 
country; for example, its capacity to oppose oper-
ations from some outside quarter. Or it may deal 
with the probable future course of foreign mili-
tary operations already in progress. In each case 
the nature of the estimate is determined by the 
specific information which the strategic planners 
are interested in getting, and the final conclusions 
of the estimate should answer the specific question 
posed at the outset. This means that the conclu-
sions of a strategic estimate may differ somewhat 
from the rather formal statement of capabilities 
and relative probabilities which has been pre-
scribed above for the standard operational 
estimate. 
The second major difference between strategic 
and operational intelligence estimates is that in 
the former more than one foreign military force 
may be involved. While it is not the prime respon-
sibility of the intelligence officer to deal with the 
strength or capabilities of his own forces, all for-
eign forces not under the direct control of his 
commander do concern him, either as potential en-
emies or simply as elements which have to be 
analyzed and appraised in order to understand

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
some particular area of the world in which the 
strategic planners may be interested. In fact, in 
areas where foreign military forces may be actu-
ally fighting one another the intelligence officer 
must not only survey the strength of each of these 
separate forces in the strategic estimate, but must 
also attempt to visualize the probable future course 
of that conflict. This means that he will actually 
have to conduct almost the same kind of mental 
"war game" between opposing forces (though in 
this case, none of them our own) which a com-
mander performs in his Estimate of the Situation. 
It also means that the conclusions of a strategic 
intelligence estimate of this kind would certainly 
go well beyond the mere statement of "adoption" 
capabilities in the customary operational intelli-
gence estimate to a fuller consideration of prob-
able results and developments. 
Because of these differences, no standard format 
for the strategic intelligence estimate has been 
developed. In practice, the form which estimates 
of this type take is determined by the particular 
government agency which may be involved, as well 
as by the type of information desired. Neverthe-
less, with the differences mentioned above, all esti-
mates follow the same general principles, and suc-
cess depends first on the careful collection and 
marshalling of relevant facts, and then on the 
careful analysis of all the possibilities and impli-
cations that logically follow. 
INTELLIGENCE IN THE PLANNING PROCESS 
Preliminary Procedures 
Once the commander's decision has been made, 
the staff turns to the task of working up detailed 
plans to implement that decision. First of all, 
the intelligence officer will probably want to block 
out some kind of tentative planning schedule for 
the guidance of his own division, so as to provide 
enough time to do all the many detailed jobs that 
have to be clone prior to the actual target date. 
As planning progresses, of course, some changes 
in the target date or in other details may be made 
which will dictate corresponding changes in the 
intelligence planning schedule, and to this extent 
no schedule can be entirely hard and fast. But 
at least a careful intelligence planning schedule 
can serve as a reminder to all hands of what re-
CONFIDENTIAL 
288 
mains to be done and the time available for doing 
it. 
At this preliminary stage the intelligence divi-
sion should also adopt, if it has not already done 
so, some kind of standard operating procedure 
(SOP), both for itself and for the various other 
intelligence activities in the forces under the com-
mander. This SOP should be issued to all sub-
ordinate units over the signature of the com-
mander, and should cover most of the intelligence 
matters that are normally germane to any opera-
tion, such as counterintelligence, the handling of 
captured documents and prisoners of war, the 
filing of periodic reports, etc. Like the planning 
schedule the standard operating procedure is in-
tended chiefly as a guide and may be modified later 
as circumstances require. 
Essential Elements of Information 
The first substantive job which an intelligence 
officer must do in the planning stage is to make 
provision for the collection of whatever additional 
information is needed to insure the success of the 
forthcoming operation. As was pointed out 
earlier in connection with the development of the 
commander's plan, the collection of necessary in-
telligence is usually one of the component opera-
tions involved in the execution of any decision, and, 
unlike some of the others, one that has to be 
started well in advance of the actual target date. 
The pertinent information on hand has already 
been briefed and interpreted in the intelligence 
estimate. After the decision has been made a care-
ful study of this estimate will usually show that 
many items of information about the enemy or the 
area of operations, which should be known to in-
sure a successful operation, are missing. Before 
planning can proceed properly this missing in-
formation must be obtained. Questions like these 
may have to be answered: is the soil of the beaches 
firm enough to support our combat vehicles? 
Will the enemy defend his beaches or counterat-
tack instead from inland positions after our troops 
are ashore? Is there enough water in the area to 
sustain our troops without additional supplies of 
our own? Such questions are termed "essential 
elements of information," often abbreviated as 
"EEI."

Approved For Release 2003/12/09 : CIA-RDP85G00105R000100210002-9 
INTELLIGENCE STAFF PROCEDURES 
In practice, of course, not every missing item of 
information a commander thinks he ought to know 
will turn up before the operation actually gets 
under way. Yet the commander may decide to go 
ahead anyway. To that extent, therefore, some of 
the essential elements of information are not, 
strictly speaking, "essential" to the success of the 
operation. 
The Collection Plan 
Having decided what information is needed, 
how does the intelligence officer go about collect-
ing it? The first step is to determine specifically 
what concrete evidence might answer the questions 
posed by the essential elements of information. 
For example, if one of the EEIs is: "Will the 
enemy defend his beaches or counterattack instead 
from inland positions ?" then evidence such as the 
location of fixed defenses or established fields of 
fire would tend to answer the question. Specific 
bits of evidence of this kind which can answer the 
EEIs are called indications, and the first step in 
collecting information is to outline the indications 
that apply to each individual EEI. 
Now if information is to be collected, it must, of 
course, be collected by somebody. The next step, 
then, is to determine which units or individuals are 
available, and which are best qualified, for the 
collection task. In the case of beach defenses, for 
example, an underwater demolition team or a 
photo reconnaissance unit might be best equipped 
to spot the pertinent indications. 
Roughly, there are four broad categories of 
potential intelligence collectors: (a) nonintelli-
gence units and personnel within our own com-
mand, such as ground troops, aircraft, submarines, 
etc.; (b) personnel of the intelligence division, 
such as technical intelligence teams, translator and 
interpreter units, scouts, etc.; (c) military per-
sonnel not tinder our command, such as ONI, other 
governmental intelligence agencies, other military 
services, and friendly foreign military personnel 
and agencies; and (d) nonmilitary personnel, such 
as civilian informants. Personnel of the intelli-
gence division can of course be used for such col-
lection tasks as the intelligence officer himself may 
determine, while the services of military personnel 
not under our command would be available only 
269196-53-20 
CONFIDENTIAL 
on request through proper channels. The use of 
civilian personnel would depend on the nature of 
the desired information, and the competency of 
the individual. Nonintelligence personnel within 
the command can be used only with the coopera-
tion and approval of other staff officers, so that 
the assignment of collection duties to operational 
units will not conflict with other operation duty. 
Indeed it is chiefly for this reason that the com-
mander himself is always considered as officially 
determining the EEIs, for he alone can judge 
whether some missing item of information is w 
important to him that its collection becomes a 
priority assignment for his own operational forces. 
After collection duties have been allotted to the 
units available, the next job is to draw up a sched-
ule for getting that information back to the in-
telligence division in time to use it. Some infor-
mation, for instance, will be needed almost imme-
diately or at least prior to some fixed deadline. 
Other items, like the condition of beach obstacles, 
for example, should be reported in terms of the 
current situation. Still other information, such 
as order of battle data, should be reported on a 
regular and continuing basis. These differing re-
quirements dictate the need of a careful reporting 
schedule, so that units doing the actual collecting 
will submit reports in time to be of use. 
In instructing collection personnel not trained 
in intelligence work, the intelligence officer should 
avoid using the broad and general terminology of 
the essential elements of information or even of 
the indications. Rather be should clearly describe 
exactly what he wants them to look for and report. 
Otherwise the collection effort may become a com-
plete waste of time. In the case of information 
on beach defenses, it probably would not be enough 
to tell an air reconnaissance group simply to 
check and report on "beach defenses." The intel-
ligence officer should state the precise kind of 
defenses he has in mind: pill boxes, trenches, 
barbed wire, underwater obstacles, or coastal de-
fense guns. It is always much easier to see some-
thing when you know exactly what you are looking 
for; and the intelligence officer will get better re-
sults from collection assignments if he takes noth-
ing for granted. These details, therefore, should 
serve as the basis for specific orders to collectors, 
and the intelligence officer's responsibility is to see

that they are developed with enough care to pro-

Taken together these five steps: determining 
the EEI, listing the indications, designating the 
collection agencies, scheduling reporting dead-
lines, and issuing specific orders to collection per-
sonnel comprise what is known as the collection 
plan. The collection plan may be drawn up in a 
variety of forms, but experience has proved that 
one similar to the tabular format shown in figure 
13 is most useful. The important thing is not 
what form is used but whether all of the essential 
steps have been taken. 
Collecting information is not a job which ends 
when the formal directive has been issued or even 
when the operation has started. It continues 
throughout the life of the operation, and so pro-
vision must also be made within the text of the 
operation order itself for the rules and techniques 
that should govern additional collection. That is 
one of the main purposes for the next major intel-
ligence job, the preparation of the intelligence 
annex.

The Intelligence Annex 
It has been previously shown how at each suc-
cessive stage in the command process the intelli-
gence staff assistant performs some specific job 
designed to aid the commander in the successful 
execution of that particular stage. After the com-
mander's decision has been made and his basic 
plan developed, the next command step is to issue 
the formal directive, the operation plan or opera-
tion order. Intelligence has two legitimate inter-
ests in the text of this directive. One is to see that 
it includes all information about the enemy and 
area of operations which subordinate commanders 
need to know to carry out their own parts of the 
operation successfully. The other is to dissem-
inate to all subordinate headquarters such instruc-
tions as may be required to insure the full and 
proper functioning of the intelligence aspects of 
the operation. 
In small operations, both purposes can ade-
quately be served simply by incorporating the

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
In the first part the information about the 
enemy and area of operations is summarized. In 
the second, intelligence collection tasks for sub-
ordinate units of the command to perform during 
the course of the operation are assigned. In the 
third all general procedures for handling and co-
ordinating all other intelligence matters within 
the command as a whole are promulgated. 
Generally speaking, the information in Part I 
of the annex is the same information about the 
enemy and area of operations which appeared pre-
viously in the intelligence estimate, except, of 
course, that it has been revised, expanded, and 
brought up to date by any information collected 
since then. As in the estimate, this summary of 
information, especially that dealing with the area, 
should include brief conclusions as to its signifi-
cance for combat operations. 
Occasionally an intelligence annex may be fur-
ther broken down into supporting appendices and 
tabs whenever information of an elaborate or de-
tailed sort can be better presented outside the body 
of the annex proper. Tide and sunrise tables, for 
example, might well be included in a separate 
appendix or tab and merely referenced in the body 
of the annex itself. There is no set pattern to 
follow; it all depends on the specific circumstances 
and volume of information at hand. 
The real meat of this first part of the annex is 
the section dealing with enemy capabilities. This, 
too, generally resembles the corresponding section 
in the intelligence estimate, except that it must be 
revised and brought up to date in line with what-
ever new intelligence may have been developed 
since the estimate originally appeared. Here, in-
cidentally, the value of expressing enemy capabil-
ities in specific terms of what, when, where, and 
in what strength becomes clear, for the annex is 
designed primarily to guide and assist subordi-
nate commanders. From their point of view the 
most important information about the enemy is 
what he can throw against their own particular 
force or vessels?plus when, where, and to what 
extent he can do so. As in the estimate, enemy 
capabilities should be not merely listed, but should 
also be discussed in terms both of their effect on 
the accomplishment of our own mission and their 
relative probability of adoption, although both 
CONFIDENTIAL 
292 
discussions may be more condensed than they were 
in the intelligence estimate. 
Part II of the annex comprises the latest intelli-
gence mission and collection plan. Since many 
of the tasks provided for in the collection plan 
which was drawn up at the outset of the planning 
stage will by this time have been successfully com-
pleted, the collection plan reproduced in the in-
telligence annex will not be an exact duplicate. 
Only missing information is handled in any col-
lection plan. 
The collection plan of the annex will therefore 
list only the current essential elements of informa-
tion and their indications. The balance of the col-
lection plan will outline the arrangements that 
have been made to get that information. 
Normally, these arrangements will fall into two 
divisions. The first includes the collection tasks 
assigned directly to subordinate units of the com-
mander's own forces, listed in the order in which 
the units appear in the task organization para-
graph of the operation order. All of the details 
that may be needed to insure adequate collection 
should also be included here, because this listing of 
intelligence collection assignments in the annex 
amounts to a specific order to the subordinate units 
involved to perform the collection task. In fact 
from this point of view the intelligence annex is 
actually an integral part of the order itself, and 
must be carefully perused by all subordinates for 
possible assignments. For example, the "scouting 
unit," in addition to its other assignments, may 
be instructed to report all sightings of ships, air-
craft, and small coastal craft, and the "air support 
unit" may be instructed to make specific photo-
graphic reconnaissance flights. 
The second division of collection arrangements 
lists the requests for information that have been 
made to other headquarters. Here, for example, 
might be recorded the fact that certain informa-
tion about guerrilla activities has been requested 
of Army headquarters, and will be delivered by 
special messenger prior to a certain hour. The 
collection assignments to units of the command 
and the requests made to outside agencies together 
will give subordinate commanders an adequate 
picture of all cuirrent plans for getting the infor-
mation they need in time for them to use it. 
Part III of the annex is a compendium of gen-
eral instructions for the guidance of subordinate

units in carrying out all other normal intelligence 
duties and responsibilities in the course of the 
operation. These include such subjects as the han-
dling of prisoners of war, captured documents and 
materiel, the security and counterintelligence 
measures to be taken, instructions relating to maps, 
charts, photographs, and the preparation of pe-
riodic reports?in a word, all of the matters which 
are normally covered in the intelligence standard 
operating procedure of the command. While this 
procedure is already presumably in effect within 
the command, the annex covers these matters in 
specific relation to the current operation, and 
therefore may involve certain changes in the exist-
ing SOP that are required by the particular cir-
cumstances of this specific operation. For exam-
ple, the type of prisoners captured in certain 
operations may be unusual, or there may be special 
counterintelligence measures required. The pro-
cedures outlined in this final section of the annex, 
therefore, must anticipate all of these special sit-
uations and provide adequate guidance to all sub-
ordinate intelligence sections in dealing with them. 
Without the direction thereby provided the intel-
ligence work of the whole command may suffer 
from improper coordination and integration. 
INTELLIGENCE IN THE RUNNING ACTION 
Just as combat is the "pay-off" for the com-
mander, so too is it the "pay-off" for his intelli-
gence officer. Once an operation is underway the 
commander's duty is to supervise it closely and be 
ready to make whatever changes in his original 
orders may be dictated by differences that develop 
between the actual combat situation and the sit-
uation that was originally 'visualized by his staff 
planners in drawing up the operation order. 
These differences are of two principal kinds: dif-
ferences in the position of our own forces or their 
rate of progress in executing the plans laid down 
for them, and differences in the enemy's situation 
or the character of the area of operations as the 
action moves forward. Differences of the second 
category, of course, will be the concern of the in-
telligence officer. 
As was the case at Tarawa, it may develop that 
actual underwater conditions are vastly different 
from those anticipated in the original order; or, 
as at Biak, it may turn out that what was regarded 
in the original planning as a gentle, rolling hill is 
in reality a sharp coral escarpment, filled with a 
myriad of limestone caves. New weapons may be 
encountered, as they were at Okinawa, or new and 
unexpected concentrations of troops, as was the 
case at Leyte. All of this new information, col-
lected as an operation progresses by means of the 
very collection procedures which were set up ear-
lier in the intelligence annex, must be evaluated 
and interpreted by the intelligence officer for any 
possible affect it may have on his current estimate 
of enemy capabilities. Any new conclusions that 
emerge must be passed along very quickly to the 
commander himself for use in his own reestimate 
and in any revision of his orders. 
The intelligence cycle is in high gear. New 
information is collected as a byproduct of the 
fighting, processed by the intelligence staff divi-
sion, and disseminated to the commander for his 
consideration and possible use in supervising the 
progress of the action. The tempo is rapid, for 
unless information is collected, processed, dis-
seminated, and used in time it is completely worth-
less. So intelligence officers in combat have a re-
sponsibility not merely for accuracy but also for 
speed. While success may to some extent depend 
on individual qualities of alertness and decisive-
ness of mind, it can also be greatly facilitated by 
the understanding and use of proper techniques 
on the part of the intelligence division as a whole. 
293 
Plots 
One of these techniques is the prompt and care-
ful recording of all new information about the 
enemy and the area of operations that is received 
during an operation. The methods of recording 
may vary somewhat from command to command 
and from operation to operation, but in general 
all of them should prove helpful. 
A plot of enemy positions and current opera-
tions is perhaps the simplest and most effective 
way of recording operational data. Such plots 
may be kept directly on a map or chart, or, per-
haps more readily, on an overlay, and they may 
be of several kinds, depending on the specific op-
erations at hand. One plot, for example, might

sition of enemy surface forces, and still another 
that of enemy merchant ships. In an amphibious 
operation some kind of plot of enemy ground posi-
tions, enemy gun batteries, and possible enemy 
targets ashore would almost certainly have to be 
maintained. An air plot, with arcs indicating 
maximum combat radii for the various enemy 
aircraft involved, is also a must if the enemy pos-
sesses any air strength at all. Order of battle 
information on these plots may he shown directly 
on the overlay, or on a small sheet or card posted 
to one side and referenced directly to the plot 
itself. 
In some cases the intelligence division may also 
be required to maintain a plot of friendly posi-
tions, although usually this is a job for operations 
not intelligence. The intelligence plot, however, 
will have to include enough information about 
friendly positions so that the data about the enemy 
can be properly understood. 
The chief value of operational plots of this sort 
is that they make it possible for an intelligence 
division to record information in a form that 
enables the significance of that information to be 
recognized by the commander or any of his staff 
officers almost at a glance. Thus it must be as 
complete and current as possible. Not all of the 
information which comes in during an operation, 
however, can be recorded graphically, and the 
nature of any plot imposes certain limitations on 
the extent of the data that can be included on it. 
Other techniques are therefore needed if the in-
telligence division is to do a thorough recording 
job. 
Journals and Worksheets 
Normally the first step in recording information 
is its entry in the intelligence log or journal. The 
journal is nothing more than a chronological list-
ing of all incoming dispatches and other items of 
intelligence value. It insures that nothing is 
overlooked, and that all incoming items are 
promptly referred to the appropriate part of the 
division for further recording, analysis, and dis-
semination. A journal usually consists of a num-
ber assigned to each new item, a listing of the 
point of its origin and time of receipt, a brief 
description of the item itself, and finally a nota-
CONFIDENTIAL 
294 
tion as to its disposition within the division, 
whether to plot, worksheets, file, or elsewhere. 
(See fig. 14.) 
Once new information has been properly logged 
in, it is further recorded on the appropriate work-
sheet. Worksheets separate information into the 
major categories that are of interest to the intelli-
gence division at the time. These categories will, 
of course, be dictated by the character of the oper-
ations currently in progress. Separate work-
sheets, for example, might be kept for enemy sub-
marines, enemy ground forces, enemy aircraft, 
enemy morale, or enemy guerrilla activity. Each 
worksheet entry should include its journal number, 
a risum4 of the information it contains with the 
letter-number code as to source and accuracy, and 
such conclusions or deductions as may properly 
be drawn from it. As each new item is added on 
individual worksheets, it becomes possible for an. 
intelligence officer to grasp rather easily the owns-
tative effect of new information and to recognize 
at any early moment any significant trends or 
developments that may be taking place to alter 
one or another of the enemy's capabilities. (See 
fig. 15.) 
Files for Operational Intelligence 
The importance of an adequate filing system in 
any intelligence activity has been discussed pre-
viously in the sections on collection and process-
ing. Since operational intelligence files invoice 
a much more detailed job of cataloguing than do 
worksheets, they cannot have top priority in the 
early stages of a combat operation. Nevertheless, 
an intelligence officer with a combat unit cannot 
neglect the maintenance of good files as a con-
tinuing responsibility, and it is perhaps only a 
mild exaggeration to say that in the long run an 
intelligence division will prove to be no better 
than its files. 
The organization of operational intelligence 
files is likewise a prime consideration. In general 
the main subject headings should correspond to 
the principal categories of enemy activity that 
are likely to be of continuing interest to the intel-
ligence division, and these should then be further 
cross-referenced with as much care and detail as 
time permits.

INTELLIGENCE STAFF PROCEDURES 
Running Intelligence Estimate 
From the commander's point of view what is 
needed most in supervising the execution of a 
planned action is word of any significant changes 
in enemy capabilities. To meet this requirement 
the intelligence officer must maintain a running 
intelligence estimate, an accurate, up-to-the-
minute assessment of enemy capabilities based on 
the latest available information. 
If all the information coming into the intelli-
gence division in the course of an operation has 
been properly recorded along the lines indicated 
above, the spadework for such a running estimate 
will have been done. In most cases an up-to-the-
minute estimate can then be made simply by in-
specting the various plots and worksheets to see 
where enemy capabilities may have changed. 
There is no standard technique for interpreting 
the effect of new information, but some intelli-
gence officers have found it helpful to maintain a 
special notebook or clipboard for this purpose. 
To a certain extent the conclusions and deductions 
column of the worksheets themselves will serve as 
a running estimate, provided the breakdown of 
the individual worksheets has been made to con-
form with the principal enemy capabilities, and 
provided also that the conclusions in the work-
sheets have been drawn up with care and imagina-
tion. 
But whatever technique is used, it is important 
to remember that the maintenance of a running 
intelligence estimate, like the drafting of an orig-
inal estimate, is not just an automatic procedure. 
In intelligence it is always possible to fail to see 
the forest because of the trees; the failure can lead 
to disaster. Ultimately, a sound running estimate 
depends on the perception and imagination of the 
intelligence officer himself. Hundreds of bits of 
information can conceivably come in and be re-
corded without making a single significant change 
in enemy capabilities, while one small item might 
well change a whole picture. The intelligence 
officer must be constantly alert to recognize that 
single item in time, and no system of automatic 
techniques under the sun can do the job for him. 
All that the use of proper recording and cata-
loguing techniques can do is to cut down the like-
lihood of error. That alone is ample justification 
for their employment. 
Intelligence Periodic Reports and Summaries 
The responsibilities of the operational intelli-
gence officer are not discharged when he has re-
corded new information, or cataloged it properly, 
or even interpreted it correctly. That informa-
tion must get to the man who can use it?in most 
cases the commander?and get there in time. In 
military operations, an astute and discerning anal-
ysis that is locked up in somebody's files or on 
somebody's clipboard is completely worthless. To 
be any good analyses must be disseminated. 
The responsibility for timely dissemination is 
also the intelligence officer's. Ile must not wait 
to be asked about changes in enemy capabilities; 
he must see that any new word is passed along to 
his commander as soon as it is available. In spite 
of all the emphasis which has been placed in these 
pages on formal procedures of one sort or another, 
the intelligence officer must never forget that at 
best these are only means to an end, never ends in 
themselves. 
In an actual operation dissemination to the 
commander himself should be on a direct, per-
sonal, and usually informal basis. But when it 
comes to disseminating new information to the 
commander's superiors or his subordinates, this 
is usually done more formally in one or another 
of the reports and summaries which have been 
prescribed by the intelligence SOP. 
One such periodic report, the intelligence sum-
mary, is usually prepared and submitted in mes-
sage form every 21 hours. This summary, which 
may be distributed both up and down in the chain 
of command, should be as brief as possible, and 
generally should include a resume of enemy opera-
tions, a brief of any significant new intelligence 
developed during the period, current weather in-
formation, estimated enemy casualties for the 
period, and any significant changes in enemy 
capabilities. 
Depending on the desires of the particular com-
mander and the circumstances of the operation, 
other more extensive intelligence reports may be 
issued on a less frequent basis. Once a week, for 
example, is typical for a periodic report, which 
would summarize enemy operations during the 
preceding week in much more detail than is pos-
sible in an intelligence summary, and which would 
also include more extensive discussions of any new

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
items of possible interest. As reproduction fa-
cilities permit, photographs may also be included, 
and theoretically there is no limit to the elaborate-
ness of intelligence reports of this kind. The in-
telligence publications of such agencies as 
JICPOA and SEFIC during World War II are 
typical of the sort of thing that can be done. The 
graphic attractiveness of these publications is not 
just a matter of aesthetic delight for those re-
sponsible for getting them out. It serves a func-
tional purpose in encouraging the reading and 
study of the report by more individuals who might 
profit by the information it contains. Often an 
intelligence officer has a real selling job to do with 
the information he has amassed, and it can fre-
quently be facilitated by the attractiveness of the 
particular package in which it is presented. 
Still another kind of formal dissemination of 
operational intelligence is the special report, or-
dinarily submitted directly to a superior whenever 
certain information of unusual significance has 
been received. In cases of considerable urgency 
such a report would be transmitted by radio mes-
sage, in which case it would be know as a flash 
report. There is no set schedule for filing such 
reports, of course, since they are submitted as 
circumstances dictate. 
Like all other divisions of an operational head-
quarters, intelligence will also be expected to pre-
pare a post-action report, summarizing the func-
tioning of the intelligence division during the 
operation, discussing intelligence successes or 
failures, and outlining any recommendations for 
future operations. Reports of this kind are 
usually widely circulated, and will eventually be-
come a basis for training activities, for guidance 
in connection with future operations, and for writ-
ing the official history of the operation at a later 
date. 
CONCLUSION 
This chapter has outlined the principal tech-
niques and procedures by means of which the 
unique service that intelligence is qualified to per-
form is actually made available to naval corn-
CONFIDENTIAL 
298 
manders in the planning and execution of opera-
tions entrusted to them. Each of the forms 
described here is appropriate to some particular 
stage of military command. The closeness of that 
relationship can readily be seen from the compos-
ite chart shown in figure 16. 
Complicated as some of these intelligence pro-
cedures may appear to be, especially on first ac-
quaintance, the experienced officer knows how 
readily they are mastered by practice and how 
quickly they become an almost unconscious part 
of his daily routine. Important as techniques and 
procedures themselves are, they are overshadowed 
by certain other considerations. The form which 
an intelligence estimate or an intelligence annex 
takes, after all, is not nearly so important in the 
ultimate success of an operation as the extent and 
accuracy of the information it contains, or the 
soundness and imagination of the deductions and 
inferences drawn from it. On the basis of either 
of these an operational commander may well be 
obliged to make a decision affecting the lives of 
thousands of persons, and perhaps the security 
of the Nation as a whole. 
No form or technique alone can guarantee sound 
decision. At best intelligence procedures are like 
windows, most effective when virtually invisible, 
and when the attention of their user is allowed to 
focus almost exclusively on what is being pre-
sented rather than on how it is being presented. 
Every intelligence officer must remember that 
the ultimate purpose of intelligence, and hence the 
overriding test of every bit of activity within the 
intelligence division, is the extent of service which 
can be performed in support of strategic or tac-
tical military operations. To be sure the forms 
and techniques outlined in this chapter represent 
those which have well served the intelligence needs 
of operational commanders in the past. Still this 
does not mean that they must remain forever in-
violate, or that future operations and changing 
circumstances will not dictate certain revisions and 
improvements. The wise intelligence officer should 
constantly be on the lookout for such changes and 
be ready to adjust himself accordingly.

CHAPTER 13 
INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND 
Throughout the preceding chapter on Intelli-
gence Staff Procedures we saw the cycle in action 
during the planning and execution of naval opera-
tions. The procedures followed and the techniques 
employed are in general common to all types of 
operations. This chapter will continue the dis-
cussion of intelligence in support of command, 
but will be concerned more specifically with its 
operational environment. Special attention will 
be given to the responsibilities and duties of the 
intelligence officer in operational billets to which 
he may be assigned. 
In order to understand the increased importance 
of intelligence in a great variety of operational 
commands, it is helpful to review the development 
of the types of warfare in which the Navy partici-
pates, both at sea and on shore. The experiences 
of World War II afford the background. Intelli-
gence can prepare itself for continued service only 
by a careful study of its past performance, and 
the lessons learned in former operations will point 
the way to future improvements. 
INTELLIGENCE CENTERS 
In a global war, the intelligence needs of one 
theater will differ widely from the requirements of 
another. The problem of dissemination alone 
makes it desirable to establish intelligence organi-
zations under the area commanders to assume re-
sponsibility for the expeditious distribution of in-
telligence material to the forces that can use it. 
This need was recognized at an early date in 
World War II, and steps were taken to provide 
for the establishment of intelligence centers at 
important bases close to the areas of operations. 
Over a period of time, area commanders were fur-
nished the necessary personnel and equipment to 
maintain centers which would meet their partic-
ular requirements. The Office of Naval Intelli-
gence in Washington gave technical assistance to 
the activities of these centers and provided spe-
cially trained personnel for them. This guidance 
301 
and support was, of course, vital to the production 
of intelligence. The mission of these centers was: 
1. To collect, evaluate and process intelligence 
required by the command; 
2. To disseminate pertinent intelligence to 
higher, subordinate, and parallel commands; 
3. To provide long range intelligence coverage 
required for national planning; and 
4. To provide counterintelligence support. 
Centers in the European-Mediterranean Theaters 
In late 1942, the decision was made to create 
a cooperative Army-Navy intelligence organiza-
tion, which was called the Joint Intelligence Col-
lection Agency (JICA) . When established, this 
organization was located at Algiers under the As-
sistant Chief of Staff, G-2, Allied Forces Head-
quarters. Subsidiary units were placed at Oran 
and Casablanca. The mission of JICA was to 
meet certain long-range intelligence requirements 
of the Army and the Navy which could not be real-
istically imposed upon the staffs of operational 
forces. 
The Navy assigned to the Algiers headquarters 
a selected team of officers and enlisted personnel 
which included specialists in the fields of investi-
gation, research, language, document analysis, air 
intelligence and communications. It was the de-
cision of the Army that its responsibilities to the 
new organization could be met by specialists at-
tached to the G-2s of various Army commands in 
the area and by personnel of its Counter Intelli-
gence Corps. During the early period of its exist-
ence, JICA became little more than a mail and 
dispatch unit. Its effectiveness was greatly dimin-
ished when some of its functions, including all 
counterintelligence activities, were eliminated and 
when no opportunity was found for cooperative 
assistance by Army intelligence units. After a 
time, most of its naval personnel were transferred 
to the staff of the Commander, 8th Fleet (Com-
mander, North African Waters). However, small 
JICA units remained active in North Africa.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Eventually, British representatives were attached 
to the Algiers headquarters and additional offices 
were established in Egypt and Burma. As a fur-
ther development of JICA, there was organized 
in Washington a joint Army-Navy agency known 
as the Joint Intelligence Agency Research Center 
(JIARC). 
When assigned to the 8th Fleet, the former 
JICA personnel were organized into a Naval Intel-
ligence Unit under the staff N-2 and rapidly ex-
panded their activities. The air intelligence per-
sonnel participated with a combined British and 
American staff in photo interpretation projects 
and field operations, collecting data required for 
the planning of amphibious and ASW operations. 
Specialists in prisoner of war interrogation and 
document analysis worked with the Combined 
Services Detailed Interrogation Center (CSDIC), 
Allied Forces Headquarters, Algiers, to exploit 
sources of naval interest for both long-term and 
short-range purposes. Additional personnel en-
gaged in liaison activities with intelligence collec-
tion units of both national and combined military 
services in the Mediterranean, as well as with 
covert organizations maintained by OSS and the 
British Secret Intelligence Services. The NIU 
also formed teams from its personnel which were 
assigned to designated combat forces after special 
training with the Army Counter Intelligence 
Corps. Included in the functions of the NIU was 
the preparation of cooperative studies and reports, 
similar to the present national intelligence esti-
mates and national intelligence surveys. 
The field units of NIU, 8th Fleet, made effective 
contributions. At the time of the invasion of 
Sicily, a team went ashore before the tac-
tical situation had been secured. Through its 
efforts, targets of counterintelligence value were 
captured and exploited and certain threats to the 
success of the landings were thus neutralized. For 
example, this team acquired Italian charts 
showing the swept channels in the Tyrrhenian Sea. 
In addition, it gained control of key communica-
tions facilities, thus preventing the Italians from 
alerting their German allies as to the size of the 
amphibious assault against Sicily. Captured doc-
uments also provided valuable technical informa-
tion. The success of NIU, 8th Fleet, in its counter-
intelligence activities was such that British and 
CONFIDENTIAL 
302 
French liaison officers were assigned to it, and the 
Army recommended that future similar activities 
be carried out by combined teams. These teams, 
eventually known as "T" or Target-Forces, became 
the pattern for NIU-type counterintelligence oper-
ations during later phases of the war in the 
European theater, including the assault on south-
ern France. 
As the Allies advanced into Italy, the NIU, 8th 
Fleet, established offices in Naples and Rome, 
eventually operating as far north as Genoa. It 
made available its files on Italian organizations, 
situations, and trends to the Allied Control Coun-
cil for Italy and to the Allied Military Govern-
ment Organization, further assisting the latter 
agency by briefing assigned naval personnel. A 
continuing responsibility of NIU personnel was 
the exploitation of the archives of the Italian Navy 
and advice to Allied Forces regarding the disposi-
tion of captured enemy material. Throughout the 
period of its operation the relatively small NIU, 
8th Fleet, was most effective in its intelligence 
support of military command. 
The 8th Fleet NIU cooperated with a similar 
unit which had been established under the N-2 on 
the staff of the Commander, 12th Fleet, who was 
also Commander Naval Forces, Europe, located in 
London. While the NIU, 12th Fleet, was sub-
stantially larger and its operations more extensive, 
its activities were similar. Its personnel carried 
out intelligence missions during and after the 
Normandy invasion, operated with naval com-
mands in France and Germany, and participated 
in some of the intelligence work of the combined 
military staffs in Europe. As part of its function, 
the NIU, 12th Fleet, aided in setting up intelli-
gence and counterintelligence targets and exploit-
ing them both in the field and at headquarters in 
London. Exploitation of these targets was pri-
marily accomplished through interrogation and 
document analysis. Eventually, the various T-
forces were combined in Germany under one or-
ganization. NI U personnel also participated with 
a combined Japanese counterintelligence team 
which operated on the continent. Its members 
were drawn from the various military services of 
the United States, Great Britain, and France, and 
were attached to the G-2 Division of the Supreme 
Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force,

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND CONFIDENTIAL 
(SHAEF). The results of the work of this team 
were made available to the Supreme Allied Com-
mander in the Far East. This team was assisted 
by other allied T-forces and by the United States 
Naval Technical Mission in Europe. A consid-
erable volume of information of intelligence value 
to the Navy was developed by the NIU teams which 
operated in Germany. 
Location of Centers 
Centers were established in forward areas of 
the Pacific Theater soon after the outbreak of 
hostilities and continued to function as long as 
they were of value. At first, they were located 
at Pearl Harbor for CinCPac, at Noumea for 
ComSoPac, at Kodiak for ComNorPac, at Bris-
bane for Com7th Fleet under ComSoWesPac, and 
at Norfolk for CinCLant. As conditions changed, 
the organization and locations of the centers were 
adjusted accordingly. When the South Pacific 
area ceased to be an active theater of operations 
after the collapse of Japanese resistance in the 
Solomons, the center at Noumea was closed. As 
operations in the North Pacific moved forward, 
the headquarters of the advance intelligence cen-
ter moved down the Aleutian chain to Adak; 
similarly, the SoWesPac centers moved up the line 
from Brisbane to Hollandia, Leyte, and finally to 
Manila. One of the largest and most valuable in-
telligence centers for the fleets which operated in 
Central Pacific waters was the Joint Intelligence 
Center, Pacific Ocean Areas (JICPOA) at Pearl 
Harbor which was staffed by United States and 
Allied personnel of all ser vice s. Under 
JICP0A's direction offices were later opened at 
Guam when the fleet admiral moved forward, and 
distribution centers were also established at Leyte, 
Ulithi, and Eniwetok. 
Area Responsibilities 
The activities of each center, while basically 
similar, were of course influenced by the nature of 
the warfare in the area. The center at Norfolk, 
under Commander Air Force, Atlantic Fleet, 
naturally concentrated on problems of antisub-
marine warfare for the operating squadrons in 
that command and problems of training for 
recently formed air groups which were destined 
for duty in the Pacific. At Adak, the center was 
303 
forced to make a thorough study of the peculiar 
aerological conditions prevailing in the Aleutians, 
the Kuriles, and Kamchatka, since the unpre-
dictable weather distinctly limited operations in 
that theater of war. In the Central Pacific area, 
JICPOA and related centers concentrated on the 
specialized intelligence required for carrier war-
fare and for fleet and air support of amphibious 
landings. In the Southwest Pacific the short 
overwater jumps preliminary to the Philippine 
invasion were supported by land-based aircraft 
and did not require, for the most part, large naval 
supporting forces. Consequently, one of the chief 
responsibilities of the Seventh Fleet Intelligence 
Center (SEFIC) was to keep the Army theater 
commander informed on all naval matters. Prior 
to the Philippine landings, the center was con-
cerned with the development of the guerrilla or-
ganization in the Philippines, including training 
of personnel, establishment of communications, 
and the organization of submarine missions to 
supply the guerrillas with arms, equipment, and 
supplies. 
Collection and Processing 
As stated above, one of the missions of the in-
telligence center was to process intelligence for 
the command. In most centers this mission was 
carried out at two levels: First, certain officers 
functioned as staff officers, furnishing information 
to the commander himself and to his operational 
staff; and second, a larger group of officers (fre-
quently including some of the first group) were 
assigned to the various branches, divisions, or sec-
tions within the center, and were engaged in col-
lecting and processing information for the sub-
ordinate, parallel, and higher commands. The 
duties of the first group have been described in 
the preceding chapter; the duties of the second 
were multitudinous, covering a wide variety of 
subjects under the purview of various sections of 
the center. 
The term "objective data," as used in intelligence 
centers, generally applied to factual studies, prin-
cipally of geographical nature. Some of these 
studies were comprehensive, such as the Joint 
Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS) , ONI 
monographs, and G-2 interim reports; others 
treated more restricted areas, such as objective

folders, air target folders, and information bulle-
tins; still others covered special fields, such as the 
joint target group series on Japanese industrial 
systems, translations of captured documents on 
enemy airfields, and terrain intelligence. 
The chief responsibility of the officers working 
in the objective data section of a center was to 
insure that information on all areas under their 
cognizance was being made available to the plan-
ning and operating forces that required it. Pre-
liminary surveys were published, and as more in-
formation was received and processed, the studies 
were revised and amended to incorporate the new 
data. 
An important part of the analysis of strategic 
intelligence undertaken by intelligence centers in 
active theaters was the thorough examination of 
all available data pertaining to potential targets, 
including photographs, captured documents, pris-
oner-of-war interrogations, and the reports of 
technical intelligence teams with the object of rec-
ommending priorities and tactics for bombing mis-
sions and other combat operations. This became 
a highly valuable service of the JICPOA target 
analysis section, especially for carrier forces. 
The cartography section of the center had cog-
nizance over the map production for the area. 
Although the Hydrographic Office and the Army 
Map Service provided much of this material, maps, 
charts, and models for special purposes, such as 
air support or bombardment, were planned at the 
center servicing the area and frequently were pro-
duced there as well. 
A special section of the center was responsible 
for maintaining complete centralized files of in-
telligence materials, adequately indexed and cross 
indexed. Accession lists were published daily, and 
cumulative lists at longer intervals. These proved 
invaluable in informing interested commands of 
available information. 
The obvious need for order of battle data on all 
enemy forces required that a section of the center 
record all available information on the organiza-
tion, characteristics, and numbers of the enemy 
naval, air, and ground forces. The basic knowl-
edge acquired prior to the opening of hostilities 
was augmented by the reports of prisoners of war, 
and captured materiel also frequently yielded 
valuable information. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
304 
The intelligence center was the appropriate 
place for the compilation of data on enemy mer-
chant shipping and the maintenance of special 
studies and statistics on this subject. 
The valuable intelligence obtained from pris-
oners of war, captured documents, and captured 
materiel made it imperative for centers to include 
an adequate number of language experts. When 
large-scale operations were in progress, the quanti-
ties of documents and materiel and the large num-
bers of prisoners of war made it essential that 
trained officers be on the spot to supervise the 
efficient collection of intelligence from such 
sources. Consequently, intelligence teams were 
organized and sent out from the centers to follow 
up all landings and major operations. In addition 
to translators and interpreters, teams normally in-
eluded specialists in naval aviation materiel and 
bomb and mine disposal. Saipan alone produced 
27 tons of Japanese documents. The crash intelli-
gence section of the Saipan team found 23 Jap-
anese fighter planes on Aslito airfield, most of 
them in flying condition, as well as 30 aircraft 
engines and 300 boxes of spare parts. 
Photo-Interpretation 
The photographic section of JICPOA printed 
and disseminated to interested commands thou-
sands of photos per day. Photographic inter-
preters identified. and filed negatives and prints 
and prepared photo interpretation reports, mo-
saics, and overlays. In those instances where an 
objective had not been recently photographed and 
the information was needed immediately, a "first 
phase" report of available data was speedily dis-
tributed. As soon as complete photo coverage had 
been made, a "second phase" report was issued. 
Special reports such as shipping, aircraft sum-
maries, beach studies, and photogrammetric 
studies were issued as requested or deemed worth-
while. As in other sections of JICPOA, photo 
interpreters concentrating on specific areas or sub-
jects were available and employed for conferences 
and briefing sessions. The section also had a pool 
of photo-interpreters undergoing indoctrination 
for later assignment to combat units. 
In addition to extensive photo reproduction fa-
cilities, the photographic section had ozalid, blue-
print, photostat, multilith, and mimeograph

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT 
equipment, all of which was extensively used. 
The reproduction of great quantities of aerial 
photographs for the cartographic section was a 
very important part of the photo section's re-
sponsibilities. Especially in the Pacific, where 
maps, charts, and background intelligence were 
either inadequate or did not exist, the photographs 
and interpretation reports furnished much, if not 
most, of the vital information needed by the objec-
tive data section for the preparation of the Infor-
mation Bulletins, Target Analysis Bulletins, and 
Air Information Summaries. 
Other Responsibilities 
The technical section of the center analyzed the 
information collected by representatives in the 
field and converted it into usable intelligence both 
for the strategists and the operational forces. 
Thus, information gleaned from the serial num-
bers on crashed enemy aircraft often established 
rates of production, and tests of aircraft captured 
in good condition revealed the plane's capabilities 
in combat. 
The psychological warfare section maintained 
liaison with other agencies interested in attacks on 
enemy morale. At JICPOA during the war, a 
vast amount of psychological warfare material 
keyed to the exigencies of the current situation 
was prepared and distributed directly from the 
center, and the operating forces were indoctri-
nated by the center in the employment of this 
material. 
The chief responsibilities of a section devoted 
to survival intelligence were the production of all 
intelligence and equipment for air-sea rescue, eva-
sion and escape, and in general everything con-
cerned with problems of survival in friendly or 
enemy areas. Experts reviewed all experiences 
of personnel who had returned and disseminated 
intelligence accordingly, either in f or m ally 
through memoranda and articles in current pub-
lications, or officially through directives, such as 
those issued by CinCPac on the standard operating 
procedure for air-sea rescue in combat and non-
? combat areas in the Pacific Ocean areas. In such 
fashion, distress communications procedures, 
emergency flight controls, survival methods and 
equipment, and indoctrination of personnel in 
these matters were standardized, and prompt 
OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND CONFIDENTIAL 
305 
emergency assistance to aircraft and surface ves-
sels in distress and the rescue of survivors were 
made possible. Centers also produced evasion and 
escape manuals containing the latest information 
available on the locations of enemy forces, guer-
rilla forces, Allied troops, and friendly or un-
friendly natives. Special sections were prepared 
for each part of enemy controlled territory in 
which linguistic or other differences in the native 
population or terrain required special evasion pro-
cedures, and large-scale briefing maps for these 
areas were included. This information was kept 
current for the operating forces by supplementary 
messages. 
The size and complexity of operations in the 
Pacific made the assembly, evaluation, and dissem-
ination of operational intelligence increasingly 
difficult. Comprehensive studies were required to 
determine what lessons could be learned from past 
actions, and new estimates were made of the ene-
my's capabilities, tactics, and order of battle, as 
well as evaluations of our own capabilities and the 
effectiveness of our tactics and ordnance. 
Some of the information gained from such study 
was of interest principally to higher commands, 
but much battle experience was also useful to 
subordinate commands and to individual personnel 
for general information and morale purposes as 
well as an aid to tactical training. Experience 
demonstrated the desirability of combining in one 
intelligence center all the functions of processing 
and dissemination of combat and operational ex-
perience, including statistical analysis, so that in 
one coordinated operation appropriate material 
might be extracted for command statistical and 
analytical purposes and for dissemination to vari-
ous levels. 
Detailed statistical analysis of operations was 
largely the responsibility of ONI and other offices 
in Washington. Nevertheless, it was found nec-
essary, in order to avoid delay in furnishing data 
to combat commands and units and to secure ap-
propriate concentration on matters of local impor-
tance and interest, to initiate a large volume of 
analytical and basic statistical studies in intelli-
gence centers. An example was the operational 
intelligence center of ComAirPac, which pro-
duced the periodical Analysis of Pacific Air Op-
erations, Air Operations Memorandum, and briefs

INTELLIGENCE FOR 
of both reports for distribution to commands of 
fleet units, and also special statistical data and 
operational reports for ComAirPac and CinCPac. 
By virtue of conducting these studies in conjunc-
tion with a general intelligence center it was pos-
sible to produce reports that presented operational 
intelligence in practical relationship to objective 
and order of battle intelligence. 
The principal duties of flak intelligence officers 
assigned to intelligence centers were: the develop-
ment of methods of analyzing enemy AA, such as 
the flak computer; the investigation of the char-
acteristics of enemy AA materiel to determine its 
capabilities and limitations; the observation of all 
tactical tests of flak intelligence; the statistical 
analysis of AA damage to naval aircraft to deter-
mine the circumstances under which it was ef-
fected; the training of flak intelligence officers for 
service with the fleet; and the dissemination of all 
useful flak intelligence. 
Aside from the publications of a specialized 
nature which were issued by the sections described 
above, it was customary for intelligence centers 
to prepare a periodical of a general nature to keep 
the command informed of the most significant de-
velopments in all categories. Such publications 
were daily, biweekly, weekly, or monthly, the regu-
larity being determined by the amount of intelli-
gence to be disseminated and the speed required. 
Some commands published more than one of these, 
though the most common practice was to issue a 
weekly intelligence bulletin. 
Although the specialists concerned with the 
identification and characteristics of own and enemy 
aircraft, fleet and merchant shipping, and mobile 
land equipment were at times separate units at-
tached to administrative commands, such as the 
ComAirPac recognition unit during the last war, 
it was nonetheless essential for intelligence centers 
to insure that all such information was given ade-
quate dissemination. Furthermore, for its own 
work, it was necessary to include in its organiza-
tion a sufficient number of officers to supply the 
necessary data on recognition whenever required. 
It was general practice to include information 
which could be furnished by the recognition officer 
of the center, such as photographs and statistics on 
aircraft, ships, and ground vehicles. 
All centers assigned to certain officers, either as 
CONFIDENTIAL

a full-time or part-time duty, the task of maintain-
ing liaison with other services, agencies, or any 
unit which required the information available in 
the center. In turn, representatives of other units 
were at times stationed in a center as permanent 
liaison officers to act for their commands whenever 
desirable. This was especially true at JICP0A 
where, in addition to the representatives of United 
States organizations directly involved, there were 
also liaison officers from Allied services, such as 
the British Army and Navy and the Australian 
forces. 
ADVANCE BASES 
The intelligence duties at advance bases during 
World War II varied according to the geograph-
ical location, local command organization, and 
general importance. The base intelligence officer 
had to be intimately acquainted with the exact 
nature and limits of the mission of his command-
ing officer in order to perform his duties efficiently. 
The commander of an advance base usually had 
duties relating to the repair and supply of an op-
erating fleet and to the routing and control of 
shipping. His intelligence officers, therefore, had 
to be familiar with basic operation plans in effect 
in order to keep the commander informed of all 
changes as operations in the area progressed. 
This was accomplished by means of comprehensive 
plots on convoys and routing, friendly and enemy 
submarine and surface forces, and the air activi-
ties, such as area searches and barrier patrols. 
Responsibilities of the intelligence officer also 
included the briefing of naval and merchant ship 
captains on intelligence matters relating to their 
missions. Often he was of service to them in con-
ducting investigations relating to security matters 
and to counterintelligence problems. In the course 
of this work, and in his general contact with naval 
and merchant marine personnel, he would collect 
much valuable intelligence information. 
Often his duties included administration of cen-
sorship regulations, public information and liaison 
with news correspondents, ship boarding, liaison 
with friendly forces in the area, formulation of 
regulations governing relationships with local 
natives and liaison with them. Finally, he was 
responsible for the collection, processing, and dis-
semination of intelligence regarding enemy forces 
in the area.

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND CONFIDENTIAL 
SEA FRONTIERS AND DISTRICTS 
A consideration of the duties of an operational 
intelligence officer assigned to a naval district or 
a sea frontier is important for two reasons; first, 
because it was the experience and knowledge 
gained from those operations which formed the 
foundation for the development of operational in-
telligence in the combat areas in World War II; 
and second, because in future wars we can no 
longer rely on the vast expanse of ocean which 
separates us from Europe and Asia to protect our 
coasts from continuous and devastating attack. 
The German U-boat campaign from 1942 to 1945 
demonstrated the need for a complete coastal in-
telligence network. The present development of 
the submarine, the aircraft, the rocket, and the 
guided missile are all further arguments in sup-
port of the continuance of such activity. 
On 14 April 1942, the first victory over a Ger-
man submarine in Fifth Naval District waters took 
place. The terse announcement merely stated 
"U. S. S. Roper sank sub at 35-55N, 75-15W, at 
0069. 29 bodies recovered." The Roper did not 
stumble on the U-85 by chance, but was directed 
to first contact by the accurate intelligence of Fifth 
Naval District operations. District and sea fron-
tier intelligence organizations accordingly dis-
charged such responsibilities, as well as furnishing 
operating units with information concerning 
friendly forces and the characteristics of coastal 
waters. 
During World War II, the basic mission and 
responsibility of all operational intelligence 
branches in naval districts and sea frontiers was 
to collect, from all sources, combat and operational 
intelligence and information useful to the Naval 
Establishment, and after coordination and evalua-
tion, to disseminate it to the action agencies of all 
Naval Districts, Sea Frontiers, the Office of Naval 
Intelligence, and to other appropriate government 
agencies and commands. Such a program entailed 
the establishment of intelligence rooms and plots 
in joint operation centers and of intelligence units 
at all outlying section bases, airfields, harbor en-
trance control posts, and other naval shore stations. 
It involved the supervision of mine watch organi-
zations, the handling of wreck information, the 
organization of a fishing vessel control plan, and 
other similar activities. Coastal information sec-
307 
tions of the naval districts, given the job of per-
forming operational intelligence, broadened in 
scope and came to be known by the latter name. 
In the various sea frontiers and naval districts, 
the mission of performing operational intelligence 
was accomplished by similar if not identical meth-
ods. While operational intelligence in sea fron-
tiers collected, processed, and disseminated infor-
mation and intelligence furnished by the districts 
within the frontiers, districts performed the same 
functions for, intelligence furnished them by their 
joint operations centers, section bases, and air-
fields. In other words, the district organization 
functioned operationally as a task group under the 
sea frontier task force command. Physical ar-
rangements and internal organizations varied, but 
in most instances accomplishments were the same. 
Operational Intelligence Duties With Battleships 
and Cruisers 
Because operational intelligence billets afloat 
were a product of World War II and because the 
demands of commanding officers differed, estab-
lished doctrine for intelligence officers reporting 
to single ships awaited experience, trial and error, 
and zealous attention to the task by a growing 
number of such officers, who ultimately were as-
signed to half the battleships, a score of cruisers, 
and to numerous other units. Standard proce-
dures were forthcoming, however, and the intelli-
gence officer's value was recognized. One com-
manding officer of a battleship, in commenting on 
the duties of his operational intelligence officer, 
stated, "He devised means, procedures, and devel-
oped systems of intelligence reporting of such 
value that he made himself of inestimable value to 
his commanding officer during combat and cruising 
operations." 
The intelligence officer assigned to a single ship 
was at all times responsible to the captain of the 
ship who also defined his duties. He was, in effect, 
a member of the captain's staff and he had the 
same relationship to the captain as did the flag 
intelligence officer to his admiral. 
Since most ships during the war were in con-
tinuous operation, the intelligence system finally 
employed relieved the ship's intelligence officer 
of much of the responsibility for developing 
sources of information aside from the battle expe-

rience of his own ship. Instead, task force and 
fleet intelligence officers and, above all, the area 
intelligence center, were given the primary respon-
sibility for furnishing intelligence for use by com-
batant units. The process was never perfect, how-
ever, and the ship's officer owed. to his captain the 
duty of making sure that the ship was included in 
all distribution lists governing the dissemination 
of intelligence publications useful to the ship. 
Adequate familiarity with the intelligence center, 
frequent liaison with group, force, and fleet in-
telligence officers, and extensive visiting with 
shore-based commands as opportunity permitted 
proved effective in making the officer aware of 
the intelligence available. Intelligence while at 
sea was for the most part obtained from telecom-
munications. The intelligence officer could insure 
his receipt of all pertinent messages by explaining 
his needs and problems to the Communications 
Department. 
The volume of intelligence received by an alert 
ship's intelligence officer, although not so great as 
that of higher echelons, required extensive study 
if it was to be thoroughly mastered and necessi-
tated the employment of files useful for quick and 
ready reference. A universal means employed to 
evaluate and disseminate information was the 
plot, for much of the intelligence concerning the 
enemy situation, the theater of action, and friendly 
forces lent itself to graphic presentation. The in-
formation best handled in this manner included 
surface, air, and submarine contacts, sightings, 
and fixes; known and probable enemy air searches; 
friendly submarine operating areas, positions, and 
tracks; friendly air searches; the shipping routes 
and positions of friendly convoys, as well as estab-
lished fueling areas and reference points; own 
ship's track in relation to that of other combat 
units; minefields, whether laid by the enemy or 
by friendly forces; and uncharted navigational 
hazards. 
In most instances, all information suggested 
above could be kept on one strategic plotting chart. 
The more or less permanent items could be laid 
off directly on the chart, whereas information of 
temporary value could be plotted on an acetate 
or tracing paper overlay, which could be changed 
as conditions warranted. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
308 
Since this situation chart or plot was for the 
primary use of the captain, executive officer, navi-
gator, CIC officer, and 00D, it was maintained 
near the bridge, in CIC, or at both locations as 
space and requirements dictated. 
A function of battleships and cruisers, when 
attached to a gunfire support group in an amphib-
ious operation, was bombardment of targets on 
land. Fire support charts of suitable scale and 
accuracy were usually furnished by higher eche-
lons and showed all known information on enemy 
targets useful to bombarding units. However, as 
an operation progressed, further intelligence had 
to be supplied to the CIC, the gunnery officer, and 
other interested personnel. Attention was paid 
to prospective as well as to assigned target areas. 
Of interest were gun emplacements, supplies, air 
fields, radar, roads, harbors, defenses, bases, and 
hideouts for small craft. 
Another medium which was employed by the 
ship's intelligence officer to convey current infor-
mation to officers needing it was the daily intelli-
gence report or summary. Its purpose was to col-
lect and assess the most important items of in-
formation received during the past 24 hours. 
The activities of specialized departments dic-
tated more detailed attention by the intelligence 
officer. Thus the development of CIC in World 
War II as the operational nerve center of the ship 
concurrently called for special service from the 
intelligence officer, whose information from a 
multitude of sources was of great value to the 
evaluations and operational decisions undertaken 
by radar and plotting personnel in CIC. The 
CIC officer, by means of the daily summary, by 
having access to the strategic and tactical plots, 
and by being furnished with pertinent informa-
tion from all sources was kept well informed. It 
proved desirable for the intelligence officer to 
spend considerable time in CIC during sur face 
engagement, air attack, or bombardment in order 
to lend every aid possible to the executive officer 
and CIC officers faced with weighty problems of 
evaluation. 
The seaplanes carried by cruisers and battle-
ships had important patrol, search, and spotting 
functions and, what was probably of the greatest 
value in World War II, performed difficult rescue

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND CONFIDENTIAL 
missions. Briefing of seaplane pilots naturally 
depended on their specific assignments, but in most 
cases required information beyond the routine 
needs of the ship itself. 
Most major units had recognition officers as-
signed to instruct ship's personnel in identification 
of friendly and enemy aircraft and ships. New 
enemy aircraft and ships frequently first appeared 
in publications, bulletins, or summaries received 
by the intelligence officer. The disposition of such 
material was obvious. 
In practice, the responsibility of the intelligence 
officer in keeping ship personnel informed of cur-
rent information was necessarily limited to notify-
ing key individuals. It was futile to attempt to 
contact personally all ship's officers and men. Yet 
all needed an adequate general idea of the overall 
situation and successive events. During the past 
war, one captain arrived at a satisfactory solution 
by requiring all of his department heads, plus 
certain designated key officers, to read the daily 
intelligence summary and to see the situation plot. 
Supplementing these regular information serv-
ices, other graphic displays such as maps and 
frontline plots were maintained in the wardroom 
for officers and in a readily accessible place for the 
crew. Lectures on special subjects concerning the 
enemy, the objective, or especially instructive bat-
tle experiences were likewise valuable to all hands, 
not only to keep them informed but to maintain 
their morale, their interest, and their desire to 
fight. 
The intelligence officer realized that operational 
experience was a primary source of information. 
Without his own efforts and those of many others 
in similar jobs, first-hand information on enemy 
tactics, materiel, strength, and capabilities would 
have been lost. His own notes and observations 
were supplemented by the reports of other officers 
and men previously indoctrinated with the value 
of accurate recorded observations. 
Post battle duties of the ship's intelligence offi-
cer, as is true of officers in most intelligence billets, 
included contributing to the ship's action report. 
Intelligence officers with higher echelons depended 
heavily on full and accurate detail in these reports 
for vital information. 
309 
INTELLIGENCE FOR SUBMARINES 
Submarine operations during the war with 
Japan resulted in the sinking of 5,000,000 tons of 
Japanese merchant shipping and the destruction 
of such a large number of warships that the Jap-
anese Fleet was very seriously crippled. An im-
portant supporting aid to the submarine com-
manders in achieving this brilliant record was the 
intelligence data furnished them by the intelli-
gence centers of the fleet in the Pacific areas. The 
data furnished the submarine command at various 
centers were basically the same, but the method of 
operation varied at each center. For example, 
JICP0A assigned no personnel to the submarine 
command but worked through a liaison officer sta-
tioned at the center. 
The intelligence support of submarine opera-
tions was largely supplied by intelligence centers 
which prepared and carried on specialized pro-
grams designed to assist the submarine commands 
in destroying the greatest possible number of Jap-
anese ships and likewise in reducing the hazards 
inherent in submarine operations. An examina-
tion of the methods employed by the Seventh Fleet 
Intelligence Center will illustrate the general 
methods employed by all centers in performing 
this function. 
In connection with locating enemy shipping 
targets, SEFIC undertook numerous studies re-
lating to enemy merchant vessels and warships, 
their movements and equipment, and disseminated 
the findings to the submarine command. Charts 
were prepared showing individual and convoy 
shipping routes, points of convergence, overnight 
anchorages, and hiding points. These charts 
were kept current and changes in routes based on 
a compilation of new sightings of enemy shipping 
by aircraft, coastwatchers, and submarines were 
indicated. Statistical data, including damage 
and sinkings, new construction, new armament, 
radar, and special equipment on Japanese mer-
chant vessels and warships, were also disseminated 
by the center. SEFIC prepared data, charts, and 
drawings showing the estimated position of enemy 
minefields, the estimated search sectors and patrol 
doctrine of enemy patrol planes, the antisubma-
rine practices of enemy surface ships, and the use 
by the enemy of picket boats.

the center indicating, for example, that an impor-
tant ship target had moved into an area patrolled 
by a submarine of the Seventh Fleet. The center 
would then communicate this information di-

further relay to the submarine itself. 
The need for keeping the intelligence organiza-
tion in constant contact with the submarine com-
mand resulted in the establishment of an intelli-
gence unit subordinate to SEFIC and attached to 
Commander, Submarines Seventh Fleet. In the 
plot room of this unit situation charts, special 
charts of patrol areas, minefields, and similar 
items were kept, showing the current picture. 
Here the intelligence officers stood a continuous 
watch and performed operations duties including 
the processing of operational messages to and from 
submarines on patrol. 
An intelligence annex to each operation order 
for submarines going on patrol was prepared by 
the unit. It contained all data pertaining to the 
enemy of value to the submarine commanders and 
included routes taken by convoys and by indi-
vidual ships, cargoes carried, ship position, type 
and number of escort vessels, method of convoy, 
antisubmarine measures, sonic devices, radar 
shore installations, enemy bases and airfields, 
radio shipping frequencies of major ports, enemy 
merchant ships and fleet units estimated to be in 
the operating area, and estimates of future enemy 
movements. In addition to the annex, charts an-
notated with such of this information as would. 
likely be needed in the operation area were pre-
pared for each patrol or special mission. 
Other duties included briefing the commanding 
officer of each submarine prior to his departure 
for a war patrol or special mission and interview-
ing him upon return. 
Additional duties were the preparation of war 
patrol summaries and the compilation of digests 
so that later patrols might have first-hand knowl-
edge of operating conditions. Of particular in-
terest to submarine commanders was the informa-
tion gained from such summaries on water salinity 
and temperature and the force and direction of 
currents. 
Each day the officer in charge of the unit briefed 
the admiral and his staff on the situation as it 
pertained to each submarine on patrol.

INTELLIGENCE DUTIES WITH TORPEDO BOATS 
The employment of torpedo boats in World 
War II included moving selected squadrons for-
ward with amphibious forces and establishing 
them in bases from which they could defend the 
newly won beaches against attack from the sea 
and strike enemy supply lines. The functions of 
the intelligence officer, whether he was assigned 
to an operating squadron or to the commander of 
an advance base, were in general determined by 
these missions. In Pacific operations, the activi-
ties of the intelligence officer with torpedo boats 
were influenced by several additional factors 
which were highly significant both before and 
after moving up to the advance base. 
The primary mission of the boats, to attack 
enemy warships and supply vessels with torpedoes, 
was steadily expanded to include the destruction 
of enemy waterborne supplies. This meant com-
bating the extensive and effective Japanese system 
of night traffic by barges and other small craft 
with shallow draft. They hugged coastlines to 
avoid detection, utilized shallow water, took full 
advantage of coastal defenses, and employed care-
fully selected bases and staging points. To be 
effective against such targets, torpedo boats needed 
more than altered armament. Accurate hydro-
graphic information was essential to enable them 
to operate with safety in the poorly charted coastal 
waters of the Solomons, New Guinea, and the 
Philippines. 
Therefore, when preparing to move up to an 
advance base, the intelligence officer concerned 
himself to a great extent with a study of the waters 
and coastlines of the patrol areas newly assigned. 
Intelligence publications containing objective data 
were collected, full use was made of reconnaissance 
photographs, any available representatives of the 
coastwatchers or guerrilla organizations were 
consulted, and all Allied personnel with peace-
time experience in the area were interviewed. The 
location of reefs, the depths of water just offshore, 
and the contour of the coastline in the area to be 
patrolled were matters fully as urgent to torpedo-
boat captains as the position and capabilities of 
enemy coastal defenses. 
After the move to an advance base was com-
pleted and the boats began their patrols in strange 
waters, the emphasis on obtaining hydrographic

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND CONFIDENTIAL 
and coastal information was continued. Boat cap-
tains were expected to note, plot, or otherwise 
record such information during patrols. Reefs 
and other hazards in patrol areas were surveyed 
and charts corrected as quickly as possible. The 
contour and radar characteristics of islands and 
coastlines had to be ascertained. The questioning 
of boat personnel by intelligence officers yielded 
valuable information for future patrols. In addi-
tion to operational patrol experience, arrange-
ments were made to obtain current aerial photo 
interpretation reports and to perfect liaison with 
the coastwatcher organization. New objective 
data, publications of the theater intelligence cen-
ter, current translations of captured documents, 
and reports of prisoner of war interrogations were 
examined carefully. Unquestionably, then, the 
needs of the torpedo boats for hydrographic and 
other coastal information determined to a great 
extent the direction and emphasis of the intelli-
gence officer's activities. 
A second major influence on his functions was 
the lack of communication facilities at the advance 
base with which to handle the radio messages con-
taining information on the rapidly changing 
enemy situation. The staff officer on higher eche-
lons could depend on such messages as the main 
source of information regarding the progress of 
an operation, but the torpedo boat officer was 
forced to substitute extensive and continuous liai-
son with local command to obtain needed informa-
tion on the enemy. The naval base commander 
was usually cooperative and gave the intelligence 
officer access to the base message files. The results 
of friendly air reconnaissance and strikes as they 
affected the enemy shipping situation and coastal 
defenses could be obtained from the local air com-
mand. Army and Marine intelligence officers will-
ingly furnished facts concerning the progress of 
friendly ground forces and the disposition and 
movements of the enemy on land, all of which 
influenced enemy employment of surface craft for 
supply, evacuation, reinforcement, or redeploy-
ment of local forces. The local coastwatcher rep-
resentative was an excellent source of information 
on conditions in enemy held territory, barge and 
small craft movements, routes and staging points, 
supply dumps, coastal defense, and enemy inten-
tions for employment of surface craft. 
311 
Liaison with these and other organizations in 
the vicinity of the torpedo boat base was a daily 
matter. The information collected was used by 
the base commander in determining the best time 
and place for the operations of his command. 
Furthermore, the basis for the intelligence officer's 
briefing of boat captains prior to patrol was in 
large part furnished by the information gathered 
by liaison activities. 
ASW AND ANTISUBMARINE INTELLIGENCE 
Sea power is the ability of a nation to control 
transportation over the seas. Its only purpose 
and justification is its effect on the movements of 
the transports, freighters, tankers, and amphibious 
craft which carry nearly all the men and supplies 
that cross the seas. To gain and maintain com-
mand of the seas is thus the primary naval 
responsibility. 
It will at once be obvious that antisubmarine 
warfare (ASW) is essential to the success of this 
mission. It is a first objective upon which we must 
concentrate our efforts. If it fails, our whole 
naval enterprise will fail; if it succeeds, we shall 
have reason to hope for victory. Without ef-
fective ASW, we cannot wage a major war over-
seas, for the sea lanes must be kept open. 
It is common to think of ASW in its tactical 
aspect only, that is, the location and destruction 
of enemy submarines at sea. Such a view is too 
narrow. ASW may be conducted by strategic as 
well as tactical means. As here used, therefore, 
the term "ASW" will comprehend all efforts to 
deprive the enemy of the effective use of its sub-
marines. There are many ways of effecting this 
mission other than finding and destroying enemy 
submarines at sea. We can, for example, prevent 
enemy submarines from being built or serviced by 
strategic bombing of bases and building yards, 
from reaching the open sea by strategic mining 
of restricted waters, from penetrating geographic 
areas by passive harbor defense and escort of con-
voys, and from making contact with our shipping 
by the convoy system. We can also simply keep 
enemy submarines submerged most of the time by 
assiduous searches and patrols whether or not any 
submarines are actually found and destroyed. 
Neither tactical ASW nor any of the several forms

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
of strategic ASW can succeed without adequate 
intelligence. 
Capabilities and Limitations of Submarines 
The advantages of submarines over other combat 
craft are, briefly: (1) invisibility and secrecy, 
providing the opportunity for surprise; and (2) 
endurance and long range. 
For example, a submarine is capable of operat-
ing for long periods in enemy waters, unsupported 
and undetected. While there, it can perform any 
of a great variety of missions. Suppose that the 
mission is minelaying. In many situations, sur-
face ships or aircraft would not be physically ca-
pable of reaching the designated area or of remain-
ing long enough to lay mines, or would be capable 
of laying the mines only at the cost of their own 
destruction; and in any event, would reveal to the 
enemy by their movements where the mines were 
laid. Submarines also have a most important 
capability, serving as radar pickets for early 
warning of air attacks. 
On the other hand, submarines have suffered 
from characteristic limitations on their powers of 
(1) perception, (2) communication, and (3) mo-
tion. All these limitations have been intensified 
when the submarine was wholly or partly sub-
merged. Even with the use of its periscope and 
accompanying radar its horizon has been very 
close and its field of view very narrow. Its com-
munication facilities have been deficient. As for 
motion, a submerged submarine has had very lim-
ited speed, and range, and its ability to maneuver 
has been subject to sufficient water depths. 
In order to overcome these limitations, subma-
rines have been forced to run on the surface a large 
part of the time, and when doing so, have lost their 
mantle of invisibility and have been exposed to 
their enemies. This, then, has been the subma-
rine's dilemma : to be ineffective or to be vulnerable. 
ASW in the Two World Wars 
The Atlantic operations of German U-boats in 
two world wars exemplify the ability of the sub-
marine to achieve disproportionate results in rela-
tion to the cost and effort expended. 
At the height of U-boat warfare in 1915 and 
1916, the Germans had an average of only 15 sub-
marines at sea at any given time. This was a third 
CONFIDENTIAL 
312 
or less of their total strength, the other U-boats 
being in transit or training or in port. With only 
15 U-boats at sea, they were sinking, on the aver-
age, about 200,000 tons of Allied shipping every 
month. The price they paid was the loss, on the 
average of 11/2 U-boats a month?a profitable ex-
change. The final score for World War I was 11 
million tons of shipping at the price of 178 U-
boats. Each U-boat, therefore, accounted for 
nearly 62,000 tons of shipping. Thus they made 
an impressive showing, especially since the U-boat 
campaign in World War I was somewhat 
impromptu. 
In the early years of its history, the submarine 
was not very seriously regarded as an attack ves-
sel, being used chiefly for reconnaissance and 
patrol. Then, one afternoon in September, 1914, 
the U-9, engaged in a routine scouting mission, 
came by chance upon a British cruiser in the North 
Sea and sank it with a torpedo. Another cruiser, 
traveling in company with the first, came to pick 
up survivors and was also sunk with a torpedo. 
The third and last cruiser of the force, hurrying 
up to investigate, met a similar fate. In less than 
an hour, a single submarine had sunk three 
cruisers. Struck by this proof of offensive power, 
the Germans soon initiated undersea warfare on 
a large scale. 
At first the U-boat skippers were chivalrous 
towards their victims, giving warning before they 
sank merchant ships. The advent of the Q-boats 
however, brought on unrestricted submarine war-
fare, in which merchant ships were sunk without 
warning, and submarine attacks, mounting in 
numbers and ferocity, threatened to overwhelm the 
Allied cause, until they were at last turned back 
by the system of convoy and escort. 
In World War II the U-boat campaign had been 
planned and prepared long in advance. The U-
boats themselves were much improved, being 
larger and faster, with greater endurance and 
using wakeless torpedoes. They soon secured 
bases on the French coast from which they could 
operate more effectively. Furthermore, they 
learned new tactics, such as working in wolf packs 
and coming through a screen of ASW ships at 
night on the surface at high speed. 
It may seem surprising, therefore, that the U-
boats achieved less relative success in World War

II than in World. War I. The final score for 
World War II was 13 millions tons of shipping 
sunk, at the price of 751 U-boats. Each U-boat 
accounted on the average for a little more than 
17,000 tons of allied shipping, as compared with 
nearly 62,000 tons in World War I. 
This comparison reveals a striking historical 
process. It is obvious to hindsight, though per-
haps it was not fully apparent at the time, that 
from April, 1917, when the convoy system was in-
troduced, until the middle 1940's, the ascendance 
of the submarine over its adversaries?its com-
petitive position?was slowly declining. The de-
cline was due to the system of convoy and escort, 
to certain less important procedures, such as zig-
zagging, and. to the World War II innovation of 
Air ASW and the hunter-killer system. It was 
also the cumulative effect of many technical im-
provements in the means of detecting and attack-
ing submarines. All naval intelligence officers 
should understand the methods and devices by 
which, during this period, the submarine was kept 
within bounds. 
It will be appropriate to start with the convoy 
system because of its importance and priority in 
time. It curtails losses by reducing the number 
of contacts that enemy submarines make, but it 
is costly as well, for it reduces the effective ton-
nage of our ships nearly a third by loading port 
facilities intermittently and by holding down the 
faster ships to the speed of the slower ones. Hence 
enemy submarines partly achieved their mission 
merely by forcing us to send our ships in convoy, 
since they thereby decrease our command of the 
seas. 
Escort is the system of screening convoys or 
single ships with fighting ships or aircraft. Its 
effect is to reduce the number of successful sub-
marine attacks for a given number of contacts. 
Like the convoy system, it exacts a heavy outlay 
of money, time, and labor. 
In addition to the convoy and escort systems, a 
number of ASW devices were developed during 
World War I. The most important were listening 
and echo-ranging equipment and hydrostatic 
depth charges. These devices are familiar to all 
naval personnel. Listening devices or "hydro-
phones" are directional underwater microphones 
which detect and locate underwater sound sources. 
269190-54----21 
313 
Echo-ranging equipment (United States "sonar," 
British "ASDIC") is a device which propagates 
sound in water in order to detect and locate under-
water objects by means of the echoes reflected from 
them. Bearing is determined by the train of the 
sound projector ("transducer"), and range by the 
time elapsed before the echo returns. Hydrostatic 
depth charges are explosive charges in canlike con-
tainers, equipped with fuzes which are fired by 
hydrostatic pressure and can be set for any depth 
(i. e., pressure) up to a maximum. 
During World War II, the technical advances 
made in ASW were spectacular. Search radar 
was the most important. When carried in air-
craft, it enormously extended the area of ASW 
search. It kept enemy submarines submerged, and 
when they surfaced, as they often had to do for 
air or for observation, it could detect them at great 
distances. Hydrophones evolved into sonobuoys 
equipped with radio transmitters which relayed 
the signals picked up by their listening devices to 
patrolling aircraft. MAD (magnetic airborne de-
tection) equipment, responding to the magnetic 
field created by the Submarine, made it possible 
for aircraft to pinpoint submarines underwater. 
An extensive direction-finder (HF-DF) system 
exploited the German lack of radio and radar 
discipline and provided us with a running master 
plot of submarine positions. In addition, depth 
charges developed into far more effective weapons: 
projectile charges and faster-sinking charges, 
equipped with contact or influence firing mech-
anisms. 
The major ASW innovation of World War II, 
corresponding to the convoy and escort systems 
introduced in World War I, was the hunter-killer 
system. Actually, this was merely the most con-
spicuous form of a general trend away from at-
tacks by individual ships or aircraft to coordinated 
ASW attacks. Postwar analysis has shown that 
coordinated ship attacks were more than three 
times as effective in World War II as single ship 
attacks. They have proved their usefulness, as 
have coordinated air and coordinated air-surface 
(CAS) attacks. III the hunter-killer system, the 
coordinated attacks were made by teams composed 
of one or more carriers, several ASW vessels, 
search planes (hunters) and attack planes 
(killers).

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
By the middle 1940's, it seemed that the cumula-
tive effect of all these ASW advances had proved 
too much for the submarine. To many observers, 
it looked as if the submarine might become obso-
lete as a weapon of war. Then the trend was 
checked and reversed. Technological changes took 
place which promised to restore the old ascendancy 
of the submarine. Fortunately, they came too late 
to have any effect on the outcome of World War II. 
Submarine Development During and After World 
War II 
By the end of World War II, the so-called "Type 
XXI" submarine, though not yet operational, had 
been perfected by the Germans. This was the 
prototype of present submarines. In essence it 
was simply a streamlined submarine equipped 
with high-capacity batteries and snorkel (from 
the German word "Schnorkel") , a stack extension 
which enables the submarine to breathe while sub-
merged to periscope depth. Because of its stream-
lining and more powerful batteries, the Type XXI 
was capable of an underwater speed of 18 or 19 
knots, as compared with 8 or 10 knots for its World 
War II counterparts- It had to use its batteries 
for motive power only when fully submerged. At 
periscope depth, it could run on its diesels, re-
plenishing its air supply, at about 11 knots, and 
even if it slowed to 7 or 8 knots, simultaneously 
charge its batteries. Its underwater cruising 
radius was about 850 miles, or roughly five times 
that of ocean-going submarines in World War II. 
Lastly, it made use of various technical changes 
which resulted in much quieter operation. The 
changes exemplified by the Type XXI submarine 
have greatly magnified the effectiveness of sub-
marines in attack, and then at the same time have 
greatly reduced their vulnerability. 
Vulnerability is lower for several reasons. A 
submarine equipped with snorkel is extremely hard 
to detect; in fact, practically undetectible by radar 
and visual search. In the first place, it never has 
to surface at sea, and it has to snorkel only about 
one fourth of the time that a World War II sub-
marine had to surface. In the second place, a 
snorkel head is a very much smaller object of 
search than a fully surfaced submarine. Because 
of its low noise level, the Type XXI and its suc-
cessor submarines are also very hard to detect with 
CONFIDENTIAL 
314 
listening devices, including sonobuoys. Even if 
detected and attacked, because of their greater 
speed, these submarines have 8 times as much es-
cape volume as World War II submarines avail-
able to them in a given time; and because of their 
greater underwater endurance, 25 times as much 
escape area, about 400,000 square miles, before they 
must again expose their snorkels. 
Effectiveness in attack is increased, because the 
submarine can now approach its targets from a 
direction much broader on the bow or even come in 
directly astern of a slow convoy. It is easy to see 
how this capability will complicate the problem 
of escort. Screens will have to be larger, perhaps 
completely circular, perhaps multiple, and in any 
case will require a much larger number of ships 
and aircraft. 
Of course, submarine development did not cease 
with the Type XXL Subsequent improvements 
have been continual. Most have been in the direc-
tion of still greater underwater speed and endur-
ance, and some have had to do with detection or 
communication equipment. Our own Navy has 
experimented with various specialized submarine 
types: the antisubmarine "Killer" (SSK) ; the 
submarine oiler (ASSO) ; the guided-missile sub-
marine (SSG) ; the radar picket submarine 
(SSR) ; the cargo submarine, amphibious 
(ASSA) ; the transport submarine, amphibious 
(ASSP) ; and the atomic or nuclear-powered sub-
marine (SSN). 
The last of these, the atomic or nuclear-powered 
submarine, when operational, should prove to be 
at least as radical an innovation as the Type XXI. 
It would be the fastest of all ships. If produced 
in numbers, it will present new problems in the 
employment of surface vessels. 
ASW Since World War II 
Since World War II there have been many im-
provements in ASW detection devices and weap-
ons, but no major innovations. Shipboard sonar 
has been much improved by the introduction of 
the integrated sonar system. In this system, a 
"scanning sonar" provides simultaneous all-round 
search, which is presented on a cathode-ray screen. 
The ASW officer is directly given all the informa-
tion he needs for conning an attack: bearing, hori-
zontal range ( from his ship to a point on the

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND CONFIDENTIAL 
surface directly above the submarine), target 
depth, and time to fire. In computing horizontal 
range, the integrated sonar system automatically 
corrects slant range, measured along the sonar 
beam, for refraction caused by certain temperature 
differences in the water. There is no doubt that 
this equipment represents a solid ASW achieve-
ment; if introduced during World War II, it 
might have proved decisive. 
Sonar has also been adapted for use by blimps 
and helicopters. Although such use is drastically 
limited by wind and sea conditions, air-borne 
sonar is inherently superior to shipboard sonar 
because it is free from interference caused by 
reverberation and hull echoes. When carried by 
aircraft, sonar may be towed through the water, or 
it may be "dipped," that is, lowered into the water, 
used for search, raised, and moved to another 
search point. It seems quite probable that sonar-
equipped helicopters, in particular, will be widely 
used for ASW escort. In addition to greater 
sonar ranges, they offer the advantages over con-
ventional escort ships of economy of means and 
relative invulnerability to submarine attack. Di-
rectional as well as nondirectional sonobuoys are 
now available. Sonobuoy information is pre-
sented on cathode-ray screens for ready use. 
Since World War II, search radar has under-
gone steady improvement. Assiduous radar and 
visual search, especially from the air, continues 
to be one of the chief means of detecting subma-
rines and keeping them submerged. In practice, 
however, it fails to attain its theoretical effective-
ness, owing to limitations of equipment and per-
sonnel, and above all to adverse atmospheric and 
sea conditions. In sea states of 3 and above, the 
probability of detecting a snorkel by visual or 
radar search, whether from shipboard or from 
the air, is extremely small. 
The detection range of MAD has been increased 
almost to its expectable limit. This type of equip-
ment, however, is susceptible to magnetic inter-
ference and to countermeasures. Furthermore, its 
horizontal range is rather narrow. Hence, though 
MAD has proved to be good follow-up equipment, 
it is not efficient for primary search. It has been 
successfully used: (1) for barrier patrols in re-
stricted waters; (2) to investigate suspected sub-
marine locations; (3) to regain contact; and (4) 
315 
for deliberate attacks, after contact has been made 
by other means. 
RCM/ECM equipment is essentially a radar or 
radio receiver used to detect transmitting enemy 
radars or radios. It is capable of great range, 
assuming that an enemy is in the vicinity and is 
transmitting. Even when no contact is made, the 
continuous use of RCM/ECM produces useful re-
sults by curtailing enemy radar search and limit-
ing the length and frequency of enemy radio 
transmissions. Post-war improvements in this 
field appear to have been minor. Refinements in 
the types of equipment described above, and other 
detection methods exploiting similar principles, 
are undergoing more or less continual research, 
development, and test. 
The development of ASW weapons has contin-
ued, as during World War II, in the direction of 
fast-sinking charges, which may have magnetic or 
acoustic influence or contact as well as hydrostatic 
firing mechanisms and may be thrown in patterns 
or in rapid succession. Antisubmarine homing 
torpedoes have also been developed. They have 
"listening" or "pinging" heads and can search for 
submarines along a curved or zigzag path of vari-
able depth. 
Lastly, it should be mentioned that all these 
ASW detection and attack devices have given 
rise to countermeasures. Some countermeasures 
merely involve appropriate action, such as going 
deep, assuming an East-West heading and in-
creasing speed to avoid detection by MAD, or 
running silently and deep to avoid detection by 
sonobuoys. Others consist in using evasion de-
vices, such as towed noisemakers and sonar decoys. 
In the future, submarines can be expected to have 
and use evasion measures of many kinds, each de-
signed to baffle one or more specific ASW detection 
or attack devices. 
The ASW Problem 
Owing to the higher speed and longer under-
water range of which submarines are now capable, 
tactical ASW, that is, the location and destruction 
of submarines at sea, must receive special attention. 
In order to be effective it will certainly require a 
vigorous effort on a vast scale. 
There is little doubt that the latest submarines 
are beyond the reach of the ASW methods used

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
in World War II. Furthermore, such success as 
we did achieve with those methods was due in 
large part to German deficiencies. Notably, the 
Germans permitted their submarines to transmit 
excessively by radio and failed to support them 
adequately with air or surface forces. It is not 
safe to assume that a future enemy will oblige us 
by committing the same errors. The tasks that 
ASW must perform are locating enemy subma-
rines, attacking them successfully, and protecting 
our shipping. 
The major present weakness of ASW is the ini-
tial detection and pinpoint location of submarines 
underwater. Unless its approximate location 
is known or suspected, a submerged submarine, or 
even a snorkeling submarine in a high sea, is 
practically undetectible. Furthermore, subma-
rines will no longer need to expose even their peri-
scopes and snorkels except for very short and 
infrequent intervals. 
The average range at which a submarine can 
be detected underwater, about 1 mile, is far 
shorter than either the range at which a subma-
rine can plot and track a convoy, about 6 miles, 
or the range of submarine torpedoes, up to 7 miles. 
By hypothesis, location is an intelligence prob-
lem. Failing the development of longer-range 
methods for initial pinpoint detection, it seems cer-
tain that we will have to rely very largely on in-
telligence of the approximate locations and move-
ments of enemy submarines at sea, using every 
possible means to keep track of every enemy sub-
marine from the time it is built or launched. 
It seems equally certain that ASW screens must 
be extended farther away from the convoys they 
protect and will for this reason among others re-
quire a larger number of screening ships. The 
magnitude of this requirement may be seen from 
the fact that even in World War II more than 1,000 
escort ships and 1,000 ASW aircraft were needed 
to cope with about 100 U-boats. 
Another major ASW weakness arises from the 
increased space available to submarines for eva-
sion, because of their higher speed and longer 
underwater range, after the attacking ship has 
lost contact or has committed itself by firing its 
attack weapons. This problem may be met, in 
part, by coordinated operations in which one ship 
or surface craft continues to hold contact while 
CONFIDENTIAL

the other attacks. Such operations depend for 
their success on good communications and intelli-
gence. The problem may also be partly solved by 
the development of attack weapons which in effect 
shorten the evasion time or otherwise reduce the 
ev a si on space. Thus, faster-sinking depth-
charges and projectiles or self-propelled missiles 
shorten the evasion time; homing torpedoes re-
duce the evasion space by enlarging the target to 
the size of the actuation (i. e., homing) space; and 
larger depth-charge patterns or more powerful 
(e. g., atomic) depth-charges or underwater bombs 
reduce the evasion space by increasing the effec-
tive radius of the blast. 
The most extensive change resulting from the 
greater difficulty and reduced effectiveness of 
tactical ASW may well be the shift of a large part 
of our antisubmarine effort to strategic ASW. 
The forms which this shift is likely to take have 
already been described. Even more pertinent to 
this discussion, however, is the coming emphasis 
and dependence on antisubmarine intelligence. 
MINE WARFARE 
Mine warfare has been defined as "the strategic 
and tactical use of mines and mine countermeas-
ures in the conduct of war." The subject includes 
offensive and defensive minelaying, the measures 
for mine clearance ( of one's own or the enemy's 
mines) , and protection against mines. No amount 
of wishful thinking has succeeded in preventing 
the use of mines in war when they will serve a 
needed purpose. One of the belligerents may 
forego use of them to his own disadvantage, but 
he cannot control the enemy's actions sufficiently 
to ensure that mines will not be used against him. 
Under proper conditions mining can be very effec-
tive as a brief review of its history will reveal. 
The advent of aerial mining has greatly increased 
the effectiveness of offensive mining. Mining 
capabilities made great progress in the past war, 
but their limit was by no means reached. 
Historical Development 
Mine warfare has affected the outcome of wars 
since the days of the American Revolution. Mines 
were referred to as torpedoes until shortly after 
the Civil War. The results obtained from their 
use is of interest. During the Revolutionary War,

David Bushnell attempted to explode charges 
under enemy ships at New London and Phila-
delphia. Although the actual attempts were not 
successful, they did alarm the British captains to 
such an extent that they left with their ships. 
Again in the Civil War, Farragut actually was 
damning mines, when he said "Damn the tor-
pedoes." It is also interesting to note that during 
the Civil War 27 Union ships were sunk by mines, 
whereas only 9 were sunk by gunfire. 
However, it remained for the Russo-Japanese 
War to show the first great promise of mines as 
an offensive weapon. Both the Japanese and the 
Russians mined extensively in areas under the 
other's control, resulting in heavy losses to both 
sides and leaving both countries very mine-con-
scious. There are indications that the Russians 
still are. 
World War I brought the first large scale use 
of mines. During that war the Allies undertook 
extensive mining activities including the famous 
North Sea barrage of about 73,000 mines, but the 
really significant mining was carried out by the 
Germans. They laid about 45,000 mines offen-
sively in and around Allied harbors and other 
focal points of Allied shipping. The results were 
spectacular: 586 Allied merchant vessels totaling 
1,000,000 tons, and 41 British war vessels to-
gether with 225 naval auxiliaries were lost in the 
minefields. 
In spite of this experience there remained in 
most countries a tendency to regard the mine only 
as a defensive weapon. Some ventured to con-
sider the possibilites of a drifting mine as a tacti-
cal weapon, but generally speaking, not much 
thought was given to using the mine offensively. 
When World War II broke out, Great Britain 
immediately, commenced a defensive mining cam-
paign. She laid two important defensive fields. 
The first was an antisubmarine barrier along her 
East Coast. German submarines abandoned the 
area shortly after the minefield was announced 
and before any appreciable number of mines were 
over laid in it. 
It had been planned to lay another field between 
Scotland and Norway, but the German occupation 
of Norway prevented that. So instead, a large 
mine barrage was extended northwest of Scotland 
toward Iceland and Greenland. The intent of 
317 
these fields was much the same as the old North 
Sea barrage. The result has been difficult to de-
termine but their presence was of serious concern 
to German submarines and aided considerably in 
the antisubmarine campaign. 
The United States defensive minelaying effort 
in World War II is outlined in the 26 September 
1945 issue of the "ONI Weekly" as follows: 
Ten thousand moored contact mines were 
laid by the Navy during the early days of the 
war to prevent the enemy submarines menac-
ing our coast from penetrating important 
anchorages, convoy assembly points, and ref-
uge areas. . . . 
Operations began on the East Coast in Jan-
uary 1942 when a field of 365 mines was laid 
at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay. . . . 
At Key West, 3,460 mines were laid in April 
and May 1942 to form a protected convoy as-
sembly area. . . 
In May 1942, 2,635 mines were laid near 
Cape Hatteras to form a protected refuge and 
convoy area. . . . 
At Trinidad, 991 mines were laid in April 
1942. In June 1943 an additional 400 mines 
reinforced the field. . . . 
In July 1942, 575 mines were laid at Kodiak 
to protect a naval operating base and between 
September and November 1942, several fields 
totaling 1,532 mines were laid at Adak to pre-
vent a Japanese invasion of the island. . . . 
Those minefields were excellent examples of de-
fensive mining. But it remained for Hitler to 
open the world's eyes to offensive mining. At the 
beginning of the war the Nazi dictator had 
bragged of a secret weapon which he said would 
win the war for him. Everyone wondered what 
the weapon would be: the British soon found out. 
One day in September 1939 a British ship was 
sunk while steaming through what was thought to 
be a swept channel. More sinkings followed and 
the British became alarmed. The cause was finally 
found to be magnetic mines, dropped by German 
aircraft, of a new type which sank to the bottom 
and exploded only when the magnetic field of a 
steel ship passed over them. The story of the 
recovery and analysis of these mines and the de-
velopment of the necessary sweeping gear is a 
heroic tale. Fortunately, the Germans did not lay 
many of the mines until the spring of 1940, and 
by that time the sweeping problem had been solved. 
It has been estimated that if the Germans had de-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
layed introduction of their magnetic mines until 
they could lay them in large numbers, the effect 
on the British would have been disastrous. Their 
premature introduction is considered to have been 
one of the major German mistakes in the early 
period of the war. 
When the Germans found the British sweeping 
their magnetic mines, they devised new complica-
tions. They introduced a ship count device which 
prevented the mine from firing the first time a 
sweep went over it. It could be set to fire upon 
1 of 6 actuations. The effect of this was obvious. 
The mine figuratively thumbed its nose at ships or 
sweepers until it was ready to fire. It meant that 
sweepers had to cover an area at least six times to 
make certain that it was mine free. Next, a delay 
arming mechanism was introduced. This would 
allow the mine to become active at any time up to 
6 days. It necessitated continuous sweeping for 
6 days after a minelaying raid and then six com-
plete sweeps after that. The effort required to 
combat all these new devices was enormous, and 
minesweeping turned out to be one of the major 
British naval activities of the war. 
The trouble caused by German mines was 
enough to convince the British of the value of 
offensive mining and they undertook an extensive 
campaign of their own. Their fast cruiser mine-
layers regularly laid minefields off German occu-
pied ports in France, and their submarines laid 
mines off the coast of Norway. But the really 
effective minelaying was done with aircraft. More 
than 42,000 were aerially laid in German waters 
with the result that more than 1,500 German ships 
were sunk or damaged. Of significance was the 
fact that the Germans were forced to employ 2,500 
ships and 42,000 personnel in the minesweeping 
effort. 
In the Pacific, a well organized mining cam-
paign was executed against the Japanese outer 
zone. It commenced early in the war and con-
tinued to the end. Allied aircraft, submarines, 
and surface layers participated. Submarines laid 
mines throughout the central and southwest 
Pacific. Surface layer DMs did most of their 
mining in the Solomons' area, and aerial mining 
campaigns were conducted from China, Southeast 
Asia, and the Central, South, and Southwest 
Pacific theaters. None of these campaigns in the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
318 
outer zone was large scale, but they were persist-
ent and widespread, and when considered with 
submarine torpedo attacks and aircraft bombing, 
they formed a well-balanced attack on Japanese 
shipping. lt is interesting to note that the subma-
rine mining campaign netted 27 ships sunk and 27 
damaged, a combined total of over 150,000 tons. 
The Japanese laid a vast minefield in the East 
China Sea, west of the Nansei Shoto, and through-
out the war this field protected their shipping in 
that area. Japanese mines were also scattered in 
the Yellow Sea and minefields effectively guarded 
the entrances to the Sea of Japan until the closing 
months of the war. The loss of 3 American sub-
marines was almost certainly caused by mines, and 
5 others that failed to return from patrol may have 
met a similar fate. 
Allied minesweepers performed ably in the 
Pacific, and in shallow waters where the YlVIS 
(motor minesweeper) could not safely work, un-
derwater demolition teams operated with the am-
phibious forces. Special mine disposal units 
joined in the clearance tasks, and shallow-draft 
landing craft were fitted with light emergency 
sweeping gear to assist in these operations. 
In March 1945 the 20th Air Force began a mine 
campaign designed to end shipping in Japanese 
coastal waters, the major target being Shimono-
seki Straits. Eventually all important Japanese 
and Korean seaports were mined by the B-29's and 
over 670,000 tons of shipping were sunk or dis-
abled by this tremendous barrage. The Japanese 
were unable to clear the clogged channels. 
Acoustic, pressure, and magnetic mines, and their 
type variations, were not easily swept up and the 
Japanese lacked equipment for the task. 
In conjunction with this offensive mining cam-
paign, United States submarines entered the Sea 
of Japan with a new mine-detecting device that 
neutralized the Japanese minefields defending that 
body of water. With her defensive fields impo-
tent and her ports blockaded by submarines and 
mines, Japan found herself in a vise. 
In the United States Strategic Bombing Sur-
vey's "Interrogations of Japanese Officials, volume 
I," a Japanese naval officer has this to say in re-
gard to the American mine attack on Japan: 
From the standpoint of the blockade of our 
bases of operations, the isolation of chief re-

sources supplying areas, the interception of 
supply routes and the blockade of important 
points on lines of communication, the mine 
attacks were quite effective?it cannot be de-
nied that they were one of the main causes of 
our defeat. 
The use of mines by the Communist forces in 
the Korean conflict again demonstrated the im-
portance of mine warfare. The Reds proved that 
a few innocent-looking sampans and fishing junks 
employed to lay mines are capable of disrupting 
the operations of mighty armadas of modern war-
ships. In October 1950 a minefield off the port 
of Wonsan, North Korea, delayed for 8 days the 
scheduled invasion of that port by a large United 
Nations amphibious force. 
Types of Mines 
In order to appreciate the complexities of mine 
warfare it may be appropriate to consider briefly 
the types of mines employed in World War II. 
There are three general types of naval mines: the 
ground mine which rests on the sea bottom, the 
drifting mine which floats at or near the surface, 
and the moored mine which consists of a buoyant 
case moored to the bottom by an anchor and cable. 
The firing or actuating mechanism for mines may 
be one of three general types: controlled, which is 
fired by an observer in a remote control station; 
contact, which is fired by direct contact with the 
mines themselves; and influence, which is actuated 
by some change in the physical surroundings of 
the mine. 
Three basic types of influence firing mechanisms 
came into use during World War II; magnetic, 
actuated by the magnetic field which surrounds a 
steel ship; acoustic, actuated by the underwater 
sound from a ship; and pressure, fired by the 
change of pressure which results from the flow of 
water around a moving ship in shallow water. 
Combination type mines may be made by combin-
ing any two or three of these separate types of 
firing mechanisms. Such a mine has the advan-
tage of greatly complicating the sweeping prob-
lem of the enemy. This is attested to by the 
comments of a Japanese naval officer contained in 
the USSBS volume cited above: 
One thing that caused us much trouble was 
the combination of two types of mines, combi-
nation of magnetic-acoustic and the magnetic-
319 
pressure mine. By the end of the war we 
were left with a lot of research being done 
but no real effective countermeasure being 
produced in quantity. 
Intelligence in Mine Warfare 
As in all phases of naval warfare, the intelli-
gence officer has a contribution to make to mine 
warfare. First and foremost, he must keep his 
commander informed as to the enemy's mine war-
fare capabilities. He must know the types of 
mines which may be employed, the extent to which 
they may be employed, and if possible, the areas 
which may have been mined by the enemy. The 
analysis of late model enemy mines by technical 
intelligence personnel may lead to improvement 
or modification of our own mines or mine counter-
measures. 
A great amount of detailed intelligence concern-
ing the area of operations, such as depth, tem-
perature, and salinity of water, tides and currents, 
and coastal topographic data, must be furnished 
to the forces engaged in offensive minelaying. 
The mine forces in turn may in many instances 
be able to collect valuable information concerning 
the enemy and the area of operations. They 
should not be ignored as a vital collection agency, 
for in many amphibious operations they are the 
first naval forces to enter the objective area and 
may be able to furnish the latest information on 
enemy activity, location of enemy defenses and 
beach obstacles, and inshore hydrographic data. 
At present, indications point to an increased 
effectiveness of offensive mine warfare. In a little 
less than a century the mine has developed into 
a potent undersea weapon. Employed offensively 
and defensively it has turned the tide of battles, 
frustrated invading forces, and destroyed naval 
vessels of the largest class. In all probability 
minefields will continue to guard important har-
bors and channels against invasion and will con-
stitute a threat to wartime shipping. No modern 
naval commander would dare to defy the menace 
with a mere, "Damn the torpedoes, full speed 
ahead!" 
AIR INTELLIGENCE 
Air intelligence has been defined as "intelligence 
pertaining to the offensive and defensive capabili-
ties of foreign countries and their vulnerability to

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
air attack which is required by commanders to 
plan, train for, and execute operations involving 
or affected by air power." Thus air intelligence 
finds its needs and applications in all types of 
operations that either directly or indirectly in-
volve the use of air power. 
Air Power 
The air power of a sovereign state is determined 
by the compilation and analysis of several sets of 
figures and facts. It becomes meaningful when 
presented in terms of numbers of aircraft and the 
static ability to utilize and to replace them. Num-
bers of aircraft in themselves are not particularly 
significant, but when collated with such other 
considerations as types, performance character-
istics, availability, and operating personnel, the 
relative importance of a given nation's air power 
is established. 
Air power is therefore dependent on the capa-
bilities of the following elements: 
1. The air force in being, which consists of 
military aircraft, personnel, and establish-
ments. 
2. Air transport, which is composed of civilian 
air transport, personnel, and establishments. 
3. The aircraft industry, which comprises the 
manufacturers of aircraft, aircraft parts, and 
accessories. It is devoted primarily to air 
transport production in peacetime. In time 
of war, it is concentrated on the manufacture 
of military aircraft. 
Air Force Basic Tasks 
The basic tasks for which the United States Air 
Force must be prepared constantly are: 
1. Destroy hostile air forces, which includes air 
defense of the United States. 
2. Deny the establishment of and/or destroy ex-
isting hostile bases from which an enemy can 
conduct operations on land, sea, or in the air. 
3. Operate against hostile land or sea forces, 
the location and strength of which are a 
threat to the vital interest of the United 
States and her allies. 
4. Wage offensive air warfare against the source 
of strength (military and economic) of the 
enemies of the United States and her allies 
in the furtherance of approved war policies. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
320 
5. Operate as a part of the task force in the 
conduct of military operations. 
Mission of Air Intelligence 
The mission of operational air intelligence is 
threefold: 
1. To procure, process, and disseminate infor-
mation of the actual or potential hostile 
forces, the area of air operations, and any 
other usable information which Could assist 
the commander in arriving at timely and 
sound decisions. 
2. To brief aviation personnel. prior to all 
flights on the type of flight, operating area, 
targets, flak, flight routes, expected air oppo-
sition, types of hostile aircraft, communica-
tion procedures and call signs, own and hos-
tile ships and aircraft in the area, search and 
rescue procedures, evasion and escape infor-
mation, navigation, aerology, and any other 
information pertinent to that flight. 
3. To debrief returned aviation personnel on 
all aspects of the completed flight, such as 
hostile ships and/or aircraft in the area, 
results of air-to-air and air-to-surface com-
bat, ground installations, troop movements, 
etc. 
In principle, air intelligence has the same char-
acteristics and properties as any other type of 
intelligence, and the intelligence cycle is equally 
applicable to its activity. Its subject matter, 
however, comprises a special field and deals with 
special items of information, which in many cases 
require special handling and dissemination in 
forms which are not necessary for other types of 
intelligence. A basic knowledge of air intelli-
gence is essential to the professional competence 
of all naval officers. 
Air Operations 
An examination of some of the aspects of air 
operations will help in understanding the func-
tions of air intelligence. 
Air operations encompass a tremendous subject. 
When one considers the fact that large task forces 
are composed for air operations alone, the term 
assumes its true meaning and scope. Probably no 
type of warfare has made more rapid progress 
than air warfare, and as a result air operations

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND CONFIDENTIAL 
have similarly been extended to include a great 
number of tactical and strategic missions from 
both fixed and mobile bases. 
Carrier Air Operations 
At the present time the primary offensive 
weapon of the United States Navy is the carrier 
task force. Such forces are organized to accom-
plish a specific mission, being highly mobile and 
able to change their composition and disposition 
in a short period of time. They are capable of 
conducting modern warfare in accordance with 
the highest attainable standards utilizing the 
latest aircraft, ships, and special weapons. They 
can strike at the heart of hostile forces and can 
cruise close to hostile shores and launch devastat-
ing offensive air strikes against inland .as well as 
coastal targets. 
Carrier-based aircraft are divided into several 
categories depending upon their primary mission 
and comprise such varied types as fast fighters, 
attack aircraft, antisubmarine aircraft, semirigid 
airships (blimps), and helicopters. The intelli-
gence officer must be familiar with the types of 
friendly aircraft operating in his area, their flight 
characteristics, and performance in order to uti-
lize the aircraft either directly or indirectly avail-
able to him for the collection of information about 
the enemy and the area of operation. Through 
proper employment of available personnel and 
aircraft in collection and on-the-spot evaluation 
of information, tactical operational intelligence 
is obtained during engagement with enemy forces. 
The information collected by carrier-based avi-
ation personnel through observation and photog-
raphy covers many components of both operational 
and strategic intelligence, such as: 
1. Enemy aircraft in the area: numbers, types, 
performance data. 
2. Air installations: location, size and capacity, 
facilities and possibility of expansion. 
3. Ports and port facilities. 
4. Troop movements and ground installations. 
5. Ships and ship movements, both naval and 
merchant. 
Land Based and Patrol Air Operations 
Land based air operations differ greatly from 
carrier air operations for a number of reasons. 
269196-54 -22 
321 
They place the greatest emphasis on search, pa-
trol, logistic support, and the delivery of special 
weapons too bulky or heavy to be adequately 
handled aboard carriers. Land-based and patrol 
aircraft are usually larger, slower, and have a 
greater combat radius than those flown from car-
riers. However, with the introduction of the 
new flush-deck carrier, aircraft which thus far 
have operated only from stationary, distant air-
fields will transfer to the highly mobile deck of the 
carrier. The information available to the intel-
ligence officer from Land-based and patrol air-
craft is similar to that available from those which 
are carrier-based. 
Air Intelligence Production Divisions 
Air Combat Intelligence (ACI) was established 
by the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics early 
in 1942. Prior to that date the Navy had no 
specialists in this field. Since the application of 
intelligence to war in the air was more clearly a 
function of aeronautics than of the Office of Naval 
Intelligence as it was organized at the time, ACI 
was established in the Bureau of Aeronautics. 
Subsequent developments during World War II 
modified these earlier concepts to such an extent 
that ACI has now been transformed into the Air 
Section, Intelligence Branch, of ONI. 
Because the work of this section is so closely 
related to that of the Air Force's Intelligence 
Directorate, former joint committees have been re-
placed by a single integrated activity, for both 
services known as the Air Intelligence Production 
Divisions, staffed by both Navy and Air Force 
personnel. 
Responsibilities of the Divisions include all the 
phases of the intelligence cycle as they apply to 
air, as well as foreign liaison and planning. They 
are the nerve centers of United States air power 
to which all information flows, where research is 
conducted, and from which estimates emanate. 
Air Intelligence Officer Program 
Since the development of air intelligence billets 
in World War II, the Navy has felt that air in-
telligence officers should be specially equipped for 
their duties. During World War II, officers were 
trained at Quonset Point, R. I., for assignments to 
air combat intelligence billets. These officers

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR 
served with all types of operational squadrons as 
well as with staffs located both ashore and afloat. 
The significance of their contribution has been at-
tested by all who had occasion either to work with 
them or to review the results of their work. 
At the end of World War II, the school at Quon-
set Point was discontinued and most of the air 
combat intelligence officers were released from 
active duty, since the majority were reservists. 
There was actually little need for such specialists 
during the interim period between the close of 
World War II and the outbreak of the Korean 
conflict. 
The war in Korea and subsequent international 
developments again created a need for specially 
trained air intelligence officers. Profiting from 
World War II experiences, but well aware of 
changes dictated by current needs, the Navy re-
established a school designed for their training. 
The older designation, air combat intelligence of-
ficer, was changed to air intelligence officer, which 
is more descriptive of the present broad scope of 
their responsibilities and the services they render. 
As a rule, air intelligence officers are selected on 
the basis of aviation experience, either as pilots or 
in activities closely related to naval air operations. 
In time of ostensible peace, some of these officers 
are assigned to Naval Reserve organizations to 
help train Reserve air intelligence personnel. 
Air Intelligence Officer Duties 
In actual practice, probably no two air intelli-
gence officers perform identical functions either 
qualitatively or quantitatively. This is due to dif-
ferences both in command missions and individ-
ually assigned tasks. In general, the duties of an 
ATO fall within the steps of the intelligence cycle: 
collection, processing, and dissemination of intel-
ligence in support of the commander, and a fur-
ther discharge of the same responsibilities in rela-
tion to ONI. 
These duties, when stated more specifically for 
the air intelligence officer, include the maintenance 
of air intelligence files, the establishment of a ref-
erence library, the collection and dissemination 
of target information concerning areas of opera-
tion, the maintenance of situation plots, briefing 
the commander and other authorized aviation per-
CONFIDENTIAL

NAVAL OFFICERS 
sonnel, the debriefing of aviation personnel, the 
preparation of action reports, assistance in oper-
ational planning, and miscellaneous collateral 
duties such as the preparation of squadron war 
diaries, recommendations for awards, and such 
other duties as may be assigned from time to time. 
The foregoing list is in no way complete, for the 
duties will vary depending on the relative com-
mand position of the unit the ATO serves. At 
higher levels, most of his efforts will be directed 
toward planning. At lower echelons, he will prob-
ably concentrate on preparing his unit to execute 
the plans received. 
At the squadron level, the primary duty of the 
ATO is to brief and debrief aviation personnel. 
At the staff levels, he will be primarily concerned 
with planning functions, such as the preparation 
of intelligence estimates, command briefing, the 
writing of intelligence annexes to operation orders, 
and the supervision of photographic reconnais-
sance. AIO's attached to intelligence centers 
process intelligence reports and disseminate them 
to all echelons of command. 
One of the most important duties of any air 
intelligence officer is the direction of the air intel-
ligence effort. This involves both comprehensive 
planning and effective administration. 
Sources of Information 
Just as pilots and aircrewmen are dependent on 
the information and materials made available by 
the AIO, he in turn relies on them for augmenting 
the basic information prepared and disseminated 
by AFOIN and ONI. In time of war, theater 
intelligence centers provide the operating AIO's 
with additional intelligence pertinent to current 
operations. The products of such centers might 
include current situation plots, photo interpreta-
tion reports, special objective studies, enemy order

It is significant to note that as aircraft capabili-

AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE 
The following news item from the Washington 
Star of 3 November 1951 serves as a summary of 
the vital role of air technical intelligence: 
RUSSIAN WEAPONS CAREFULLY 
STUDIED IN U. S. LABORATORY (AP) 
Dayton Ohio Nov. 3, 1951. . . . 
The Air Force is peeking over Russia's 
shoulder?in a laboratory. 
The laboratory is the United States Air 
Force Technical Intelligence Center at nearby 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. What 
goes on there is so secret even workers them-
selves cannot get in the restricted area "with-
out special code numbers on their passes." 
An electric "code verifier" flashes like a 
metal detector in a prison when each of the 
workers check in or out. Armed guards will 
stop you if you walk 10 feet inside the area 
without an escort. 
A carefully screened, select group of officers 
and civilians work at the center. Engineers, 
photointerpreters, metallurgists, scientists, 
and specially trained evaluation experts of 
all kinds are putting the enemy under the 
microscope 24 hours a day, studying North 
Korean Communist equipment as well as 
Russian equipment. 
Findings Kept Secret 
What these technicians do, the technique 
they employ and how much they learn is a 
secret locked behind the laboratory fences. 
But, their prime job is to get every bit of tech-
nical information about the enemy, evaluate 
it, and make the information available to our 
fliers in combat. 
More than 100 tons of captured North 
Korea, Chinese Red, and Russian equipment 
have been shipped thousands of miles from 
the fighting zone to the Ohio intelligence cen-
ter. Some was flown here. More came by 
ship. 
One big item is a MIG-15 jet fighter taken 
by an air intelligence team shortly after it 
was shot down in Korea. 
"It was fairly intact," an officer said, "but 
there wasn't enough to warrant reconstruct-
ing it and flying the machine." 
The officer explained, however, the Air 
Force could build a MIG-15 and fly it, if it 
wanted to. There's another MIG-15 at the 
323 
base these days. But it's a pile of junk now. 
A mass of turbine engine cowlings, wires, 
seats, tailpipe from a jet engine, rudder fin 
and elevators stacked in a storeroom. It was 
more complete when they got it, but they took 
it apart and studied it, piece by piece. 
Much Is Learned 
Col. Harold E. Watson pointed to the pile 
of junk: 
Sure, we learned a lot of things about it. 
But we're only telling our own interested 
agencies. That's what makes our work so 
tough. It isn't that we're afraid to tell the 
Russians about the MIG. They know all 
about it. But they don't know how much we 
know. 
The warehouse looks like a Russian junk-
pile, with here and there supplies of intact 
equipment. There are racks of clothing worn 
by North Korean Navy, Air, and Army offi-
cers. 
There are oxygen masks, gloves, flying 
jackets, boots, helmets, new engines of a recip-
rocating type used by Russians in transport 
planes. 
In a warehouse cubbyhole is a partly intact 
Russian IL-11 two-seater trainer. The wing 
is in good condition. The fuselage, however, 
is partly shot up. 
IG Guns Checked 
Just a junk heap? Yes, but it told United 
States experts many things. For instance, 
theTlane was armed. Allied trainers are not. 
What kind of things do the experts learn 
when they peer over the shoulder of the Rus-
sian bear? 
Well, the warehouse has some machineguns 
taken from the Russian MIGs. They are 
larger and heavier caliber than the guns in 
our F-86 Sabre jets. But they fire less rapidly 
and the Sabre has more guns. 
Maybe that is one reason American jets are 
shooting down MIGs in Korea today. 
INTELLIGENCE IN AMPHIBIOUS OPERATIONS 
During World War I, naval operations for the 
most part involved antisubmarine warfare, escort 
of convoy, and fleet actions. The intelligence offi-
cer aboard ship was usually an assistant operations 
officer on a staff or the head of a department of 
the ship itself, and his intelligence work became 
merely a collateral duty as the need arose. He 
was to keep his flag or commanding officer advised 
on enemy locations and movements, and his infor-

INTELLIGENCE FOR 
mation was for the most part received from scout-
ing units and intelligence sources ashore. Air 
reconnaissance was in its infancy, and amphibious 
operations, as distinguished from raids, were not 
contemplated. It was not necessary to storm the 
beaches of Europe, inasmuch as France was then 
an active ally and transports could land their 
troops at her ports. 
During the amphibious operations training con-
ducted by the Marine Corps between World War I 
and the beginning of World War II, it became 
evident that the sources and collection agencies of 
intelligence, normally used by ground forces, 
would have to be improved upon and expanded 
in order to meet requirements peculiar to an am-
phibious operation. It was found that although 
the principles of intelligence remained the same, 
new methods and techniques for the collection and 
dissemination of enemy information would have to 
be developed and perfected before an amphibious 
operation could be put into effect with any reason-
able expectation of success. Continuous experi-
mental work, diligent training, and combat expe-
rience resulted in the present concept of intelli-
gence in amphibious operations. Lessons learned 
early in World War II, beginning with Guadal-
canal in August 1942 and extending through the 
landings in North Africa and Sicily, were invalu-
able for the planning and conduct of the amphibi-
ous landings in Normandy in June 1944. 
It was realized during these early phases of 
World War II that the amphibious operation was 
complex, involving air, sea, and ground units, and 
that intelligence officers had to be trained for these 
special activities and rushed to the fleet as quickly 
as possible. By the conclusion of World War II, 
the succession of landings in the Philippines, on 
Iwo Jima, and on Okinawa pointed conclusively 
to the fact that all previous experiences had been 
carefully studied and utilized advantageously. 
Since World War II, developments in elec-
tronics, aerial reconnaissance and photography, 
underwater demolition techniques, surface and 
underwater craft, and improved maps and charts 
have resulted in a more thorough, accurate, and 
timely system of collecting and disseminating 
enemy information and intelligence during the 
planning and execution of an amphibious opera-
tion. The continuous research and training has 
CONFIDENTIAL 
324 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
eliminated a great number of the uncertainties 
that endangered success in the past. However, 
there still exists the need for more accurate infor-
mation about the hydrography, trafficability of 
the beach, and other pertinent information of an 
objective area, as was shown in Korea during the 
planning for the Inchon landings in September 
1950. Despite the fact that United States Occu-
pation Forces had at one time been located in the 
proposed objective area, there was a definite lack 
of information on which to base the planning. It 
has become evident that the time to obtain most 
of the necessary information is during peacetime 
or other periods when areas are accessible. 
Intelligence Planning for Amphibious Operations 
Since an amphibious operation is joint by na-
ture, all intelligence material of common interest 
must be procured jointly. All echelons have a 
common interest in matters such as landing 
beaches and their approaches, defensive beach in-
stallations, enemy coast defense and antiaircraft 
guns, air fields and their defenses, weather condi-
tions, visibility, natural and artificial obstacles, 
currents, tides, surf, and other hazards to landing. 
Unified action eliminates costly duplication of 
effort and effectively utilizes the combined collect-
ing facilities of the land, sea, and air components. 
In preparation for joint operations, the produc-
tion of intelligence from all sources must first be 
carefully planned and integrated at theater level 
to prevent incomplete coverage, needless duplica-
tion, and leaks in security. The search for infor-
mation must be continuous, and the production 
and dissemination of intelligence must be expe-
dited to insure the factor of timeliness. 
The greatest problems in intelligence for am-
phibious operations arise during the planning 
phase. A great distance often separates the 
mounting and the objective areas, the landing 
forces are not in contact with the enemy, the 
majority of the available collecting agencies are 
not organic to the landing force, and a relatively 
long period of time is required for planning prior 
to the execution of the landing during which the 
enemy situation may undergo many changes. 
Sources of Amphibious Intelligence 
The available information upon which planning 
will be initiated is obtained from departmental or

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND coNFIDENTIAL 
theater intelligence agencies and research sources. 
The publications of a number of governmental 
agencies provide intelligence of a background 
nature for planning an amphibious operation: 
1. Central Intelligence Agency: Comprehensive 
surveys and studies. 
2. State Department: Information of political, 
economic, and sociological nature. 
3. ONI, G-2, and AFOIN : Information of for-
eign military forces. 
4. Army Map Service: Maps for the Armed 
Forces. 
5. Army Corps of Engineers: Strategic engi-
neering studies. 
6. Navy Hydrographic Office: Hydrographic 
charts and studies. 
7. Photographic Interpretation Center: Photo-
graphic intelligence studies and operational 
aids. 
8. Aeronautical Chart Service: Aeronautical 
charts. 
As planning progresses, more dependence will 
be placed upon theater, fleet, and organic landing 
force agencies for further information. Specialist 
teams may be available from the theater intelli-
gence agencies for assignment to the landing 
forces, such as translation and interpretation, 
technical intelligence, and counterintelligence. 
For the Inchon landings in Korea, the 1st Marine 
Division used the 163d Military Intelligence Serv-
ice Detachment and the 441st Counterintelligence 
Corps Team. Both of these specialist teams were 
furnished by the Far East Command and were 
composed of United States Army commissioned 
and enlisted personnel with such Korean nationals 
as were required for liaison interpretation and 
translation purposes. 
The intelligence sections of the amphibious 
forces and group staffs of the fleet also produce 
and disseminate intelligence necessary for the suc-
cess of an amphibious operation. These agencies 
normally are based aboard amphibious force flag-
ships (AGCs) equipped with complete reproduc-
tion facilities for printing maps and charts, devel-
oping negatives, printing ground or aerial photo-
graphs, and processing motion picture film. In 
addition, the intelligence sections of the amphib-
ious staffs include language and photographic in-
terpretation personnel and other intelligence 
325 
specialists who can render considerable assistance 
to the landing force units in acquiring and process-
ing information. An intelligence officer may be 
assigned the responsibility of target location, tar-
get identification, and damage assessment. The 
Target Information Center, operated by the staff 
intelligence section, is the repository for all perti-
nent known information on targets of interest to 
naval gunfire and air support. During operations 
target information is kept current by recording 
results of naval gunfire and air strikes. New tar-
gets, reported by aerial reconnaissance or photo-
graphic interpretation, are immediately referred 
to fire support ships and supporting aircraft. A 
card index of all known targets is maintained by 
the Target Information Center. Targets are num-
bered and listed according to areas of responsibil-
ity. As information on specific targets is reported 
by support ships and aircraft, the results are re-
corded on the cards and also plotted on a target 
map for immediate visual reference. TIC gen-
erally prepares daily for transmission to the ships 
a list of those targets destroyed or remaining in 
each area of responsibility. 
Aerial Reconnaissance 
Aerial reconnaissance is a primary source of 
information for the planning of an amphibious 
operation and often may be the only means of aug-
menting background information furnished by 
departmental or theater agencies. Requests for 
aerial reconnaissance should be exact and detailed 
and submitted as early as possible to enable aerial 
reconnaissance missions to be coordinated with 
other missions. Aerial reconnaissance can be used 
to obtain valuable information of the enemy and 
the objective area. However, there are certain re-
strictions imposed by inclement weather, darkness, 
antiaircraft artillery fire, hostile combat aircraft, 
concealed terrain, and inexperienced observers. 
Aerial reconnaissance may be divided into 
visual, electronic, or photographic; of these, pho-
tographic reconnaissance is more widely used for 
planning purposes. It is highly desirable that 
aerial photographs of landing beaches and adja-
cent areas be available early in the planning phase. 
The procedures and techniques of photointerpre-
tation have been previously described.

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Cruisers, destroyers, motor torpedo boats, land-
ing craft, rubber boats, and submarines may be 
used to reconnoiter areas selected for operations 
and such additional areas as may be desirable for 
deceptive purposes. This may be executed by the 
naval units alone or in conjunction with amphib-
ious reconnaissance patrols and underwater demo-
lition teams furnished by the landing force. The 
collection capabilities of various types of ships 
have also been discussed in chapter 9 and need not 
be repeated here. However, some additional com-
ments on amphibious patrols and underwater de-
molition teams will be given because of their inti-
mate association with the subject at hand. 
Amphibious Reconnaissance Patrols 
In the early history of amphibious warfare, the 
amphibious patrol as an aid to tactical planning 
for a contested landing was not widely employed. 
In his invasion of Britain, Julius Caesar sent offi-
cers of his staff to observe prospective landing 
beaches from seaward, but they did not actually 
land. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, 
if any information was gathered, it was by secret 
agents and espionage. 
Amphibious patrols reappeared during the Na-
poleonic Wars. Prior to the British expedition 
against the French in Egypt in 1801, a patrol of 
officers was sent ashore at Aboukir Bay to recon-
noiter for the projected landing. In the Russo-
Japanese War of 1904, the landing beaches at 
Port Arthur were not scouted by the Japanese 
on the pessimistic premise that to do so would 
divulge the location of the proposed landing; the 
possibility of an undetected reconnaissance was 
apparently not considered. In the only major 
amphibious operation of World War I, the Gal-
lipoli Campaign, no effort was made to reconnoiter 
the beaches physically prior to landing, although 
two amphibious patrols were used later in the 
operation for the purpose of gathering informa-
tion along the flanks of the Anzao beachhead. 
One of these patrols accomplished its mission with 
no casualties, while the other was detected during 
landing and destroyed by rifle fire. 
The extensive use of the amphibious reconnais-
sance patrol during World War II was mainly 
the result of modern theory and technique, stem-
CONFIDENTIAL 
326 
ming largely from recent developments such as the 
inflatable rubber boat, radio communication, and 
radar. These developments, together with high-
speed naval transports capable of covering con-
siderable distance during hours of darkness, made 
the physical reconnaissance of a defended shore 
a practical and necessary source of information 
for the amphibious operation. One of the first 
examples of a modern patrol was conducted by 
the Marine Corps in February 1940 during the 
Fleet Marine Force maneuvers. In this exercise, 
the force designated to land on the defended island 
sent a patrol ashore prior to the landing which 
successfully located the defenses of the landing 
area without being detected by the defending 
force. The patrol consisted of a Battalion S-2 and 
three scouts. It was transported into the area by 
submarine and went ashore and returned under 
cover of darkness in one rubber boat. 
In January 1942, the Observer Group, Amphib-
ious Corps, Atlantic Fleet, was organized. In 
September 1942, this group was transferred to the 
west coast where it became an organic part of the 
Pacific Fleet and was organized into a company 
of three reconnaissance platoons. It was soon 
discovered that the usefulness of this type of re-
connaissance was such as to make almost con-
tinual employment of the unit desirable. Since 
this was beyond the capabilities of so small a 
force, natural expansion followed and at the end 
of the war the Marine Corps was using a complete 
series of highly trained units for this specialized 
duty. Each of the two amphibious corps in the 
Pacific initially contained organic amphibious re-
connaissance units, enabling each to collect infor-
mation for forthcoming landings with its own 
agencies. In addition, each Marine division had 
its organic reconnaissance company, particularly 
trained for amphibious patrolling as well as for 
normal land warfare missions. 
Experience has shown that the patrolling of 
small heavily garrisoned areas does not as a rule 
warrant the risk involved. Large land masses, 
on the other hand, offer excellent patrolling op-
portunities. Well-planned, aggressive patrolling 
was found to be feasible, and patrols secured valu-
able detailed information. Patrols were success-
ful on New Georgia Island, Treasury Island, and 
Bougainville, returning without a single casualty.

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONAL COMmAN 
The patrols used by the 1st Marine Division on 
Cape Gloucester and those on Tinian by the V 
Amphibious Corps proved conclusively that, when 
properly employed, the amphibious patrol can 
secure information of the enemy and terrain not 
otherwise available. 
In planning employment for amphibious pa-
trols careful consideration must be given to the 
following basic principles: 
1. A patrol must be so constituted, both as to 
size and equipment, that it can operate in 
its assigned area with minimum danger of 
detection. 
2. Personnel assigned must be well trained in 
amphibious patrolling and be in good phys-
ical condition. 
3. Patrols must be given simple missions capable 
of accomplishment and of sufficient impor-
tance to warrant sending out a patrol. 
4. Patrols must be allowed sufficient time to ac-
complish missions assigned. 
5. Patrol leaders must be chosen for their known 
ability and intrepidity. 
6. Before departing from base, patrols and the 
commander of the transporting craft must be 
carefully briefed as to where and how they 
will be landed and where and how they will 
be removed. 
The size of an amphibious patrol is limited to 
the minimum number of men and boats capable of 
accomplishing the assigned mission. Therefore, 
the size of patrols which are to land will vary from 
2 or 3 men to a reconnaissance company, depending 
upon the nature of the mission, known enemy dis-
positions, and the configuration of the terrain. 
The smaller the patrol and the fewer the boats, the 
greater will be the chances of escaping detection. 
Personnel assigned to amphibious reconnais-
sance patrols are normally selected from recon-
naissance battalions or companies organic to a 
Marine Division. At the close of World War II, 
the Division Reconnaissance Company consisted 
of 5 officers and 104 enlisted men, plus 4 naval per-
sonnel. The present Division Reconnaissance 
Company consists of 6 officers and 121 enlisted 
men and no naval personnel. The Amphibious 
Reconnaissance Battalion of the Fleet Marine 
Force consists of 23 officers, 291 enlisted marines 
and 7 enlisted naval personnel. 
327 
Underwater Demolition Teams 
Underwater demolition teams are the principal 
Attack Force agency which can be used to recon-
noiter the objective area prior to D-day to gain 
information of hydrographic conditions and 
enemy beach defenses, and to destroy or remove 
natural and artificial obstacles existing on the 
beach or in the approaches. Frequently person-
nel of the Landing Force accompany underwater 
demolition teams to obtain information of par-
ticular interest to the assault forces and to ensure 
that such information is immediately made avail-
able to landing force units. 
During the landings at Lingayen on Luzon, in 
January 1945, ComUDTsPac requested that Army 
liaison personnel from higher echelons of the as-
sault units be assigned to UDT as observers. 
Rough UDT charts, showing the results of the 
teams' reconnaissance, were prepared and repro-
duced on gelatin "Ditto" pads, and a limited dis-
tribution was made on D-day to some of the 
command ships of the assault forces. As a result 
of these experiences, it was perceived that UDTs 
could in the future perform valuable work of a 
reconnaissance and intelligence nature. The 
teams participating in this work at Lingayen 
Gulf had had no training in hydrographic recon-
naissance as distinct from the demolition function, 
and consequently the information contained on 
their charts, although valuable, was not complete. 
Furthermore, distribution of this information was 
not effected until one hour before the assault on 
D-day. 
For adequate underwater intelligence, it was 
established that the officers participating should 
have a thorough knowledge of hydrography, in 
addition to an understanding of the maps, beach 
diagrams, and the methods of speedy reproduction 
under combat conditions. Ozalid machines, in-
stalled on the fast transports (APDs) on which 
the teams were embarked, were used extensively in 
the preparation of the reconnaissance charts which 
were distributed immediately after the informa-
tion was brought back. Staff members and under-
water demolition team captains were briefed by 
the rear intelligence section in the early stages of 
planning an operation, and later the intelligence 
officers assigned to TJDTs briefed all personnel 
whose duties necessitated the collection of detailed

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
information. All available pertinent data was 
issued to them, and particular effort was made to 
supply blow-ups of all the best available photo-
graphs of the beaches and reefs to be reconnoitered. 
The effectiveness of careful advance planning is 
well illustrated by the Iwo Jima operations. Re-
connaissance was made on D-2 day, and several 
hours afterward a message summarizing the uar 
information was sent to the flagship of the am-
phibious forces for relay to the attack forces 
approaching the target. 
On the night of D-2 day, the landing force 
liaison personnel, which consisted of Marines, two 
members of the UDT staff, and men from the 
teams, were sent back to rendezvous with the at-
tack and support forces, bearing copies of the 
messages and the UDT charts. Reports were sent 
by message upon the completion of each recon-
naissance operation; briefing personnel with re-
ports and charts were put aboard APDs to 
rendezvous with attack forces on D-1 day, and 
were also transferred to the flagships of all Trans-
Ron, TransDiv, attack force, and two tractor corn-
in ands. The Army liaison personnel were assigned 
to their respective battalions, regiments, divisions, 
and corps. At dawn on the morning of D-day, 
with the arrival of the attack forces in the area, 
further transfers of staff personnel with the nec-
essary charts were made to command ships. Each 
team furnished guides to the first landing wavesf 
and the staff personnel reported to the Force 
B ea chmaster. 
No demolition was necessary at Iwo Jima, but 
the necessity, feasibility, and importance of wide 
and early distribution of UDT intelligence were 
demonstrated. 
Prior to the invasion of Okinawa, the UDTs had 
been briefed at Leyte on all available intelligence, 
and the latest photographs had been delivered to 
them there. After making a reconnaissance of 
Kerma Retto, which was then occupied a week 
before the main assault, they proceeded to Oki-
nawa and reconnoitered the beaches 2 days before 
the assault. Here they were accompanied by rep-
resentatives of the various troop commands as-
signed to the selected areas. Their reconnaissance 
produced a detailed written report, including 
large-scale Ozalid prints of beach and reef 
sketches, which proved to be accurate and com-
CONFIDENTIAL 
prehensive. The day before the invasion, repre-
sentatives of the various troop commands were 
taken by destroyer to the flagships and vessels on 
which troop commanders were embarked. UDT 
representatives then briefed the assembled com-
manders and furnished them with the written 
report. 
During the UDT reconnaissance, 3,500 obstacles 
in the form of wooden posts set on the reef edges 
were discovered. As most of these constituted a 
barrier to LVTs, it was deemed necessary to blow 
them out of the beach approaches. This was ac-
complished by the UDTs without incident. In 
addition, these incredibly courageous men later 
reconnoitered for more suitable unloading beaches 
in the northern part of the island. 
Amphibious Intelligence Forms 
The form used for intelligence estimates in 
amphibious operations conforms to the standard 
form for estimates (see chapter 12), although 
certain information must be stated in greater 
detail. Analysis of hydrography must include the 
following factors: nature of coastline and con-
tiguous islands; the general location and extent of 
usable beaches and exits therefrom; the nature of 
offshore approaches, including the condition of 
the bottom, natural obstacles, surf conditions, 
tides, and currents. From the analysis of the 
hydrographic conditions, conclusions are reached 
as to the effect of these conditions on the enemy's 
ability to defend the objective area and on the 
execution of our mission. 
The intelligence annex for an amphibious op-
eration follows in general the standard form 
described in chapter 12. It differs, however, in 
that many additional appendices are required be-
cause of the vast amount of detail which must be 
promulgated during the planning phase of an 
amphibious operation. In order to expedite plan-
ning between subordinate and higher units, the 
appendices and early drafts of the intelligence 
annex may be distributed as soon as prepared and 
in advance of the final draft of the operation plan. 
Other appendices may be issued later than the 
operation plan in order to permit inclusion of late 
information. 
Beach studies are paramount in the work of the 
intelligence officer in amphibious operations.

They may be prepared for a single beach or for a 
series of beaches in the same area. Information 
can be presented in tabular form under the follow-
ing headings: (1) Location; (2) Length and 
width in yards; (3) Composition and trafficability 
of the soil; (4) Surf, current, and tidal condi-
tions; (5) Characteristics of the bottom, including 
gradient; (6) Depth of water offshore and on-
shore; (7) Terrain behind beach and routes of 
egress; (8) Natural and artificial beach obstacles; 
(9) Enemy beach defenses; (10) Other pertinent 
beach information. 
The collection plan for an amphibious opera-
tion embodies the same considerations as those 
previously discussed in chapter 12. Essential 
elements of information and their indications will 
determine the collection assignments. 
Dissemination 
The task of disseminating intelligence in the 
amphibious landings on Okinawa was described 
in chapter 11. It is typical of all such operations, 
for dissemination is complicated by the distance 
which often separates participating units. Once 
the amphibious forces depart for the objective 
area, dissemination becomes increasingly difficult, 
and therefore it is important that all available in-
telligence necessary for briefing of troops aboard 
ship be disseminated prior to embarkation. 
In certain instances, intelligence produced by 
specialist teams may be of value to the entire 
command. It can be most expeditiously dissemi-
nated in the form of special studies or reports, 
such as weather surveys, technical intelligence 
monographs, translations of enemy documents, 
and comprehensive reports on enemy tactical doc-
trine, order of battle, photographic interpretation, 
and terrain. The value of such reports is of 
course enhanced when they are accompanied by 
appropriate graphics. 
The intelligence officer must use the dissemina-
tion method best suited to the time, place, situation, 
and nature of the intelligence. For example, radio 
silence normally is in effect aboard ship until the 
beginning of the landing and assault phase. 
Therefore, the intelligence officer must rely on vis-
ual signals, aircraft drop, helicopter, ship's boats, 
or dispatch vessels for dissemination. To assist 
in the rapid dissemination of intelligence ashore, 
329 
an intelligence radio net is established among the 
intelligence sections within the landing force. 
Amphibious Intelligence in Action: Okinawa 
In the Okinawa Operation, Naval Intelligence 
made perhaps its most successful operational effort 
in amphibious warfare, utilizing both past experi-
ence and training. Some mistakes were made, but 
the intelligence activities in this operation serve to 
illustrate both the problems and the complexities 
of intelligence requirements in amphibious war-
fare. 
In August 1944, the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
reached their decision to occupy certain portions of 
the Nansei Shot? for the development of bases 
from which to conduct further operations against 
Japan. ComPhibsPac was designated the Com-
mander of the Joint Expeditionary Force, which 
meant that his Intelligence Section became the 
highest echelon of intelligence for this operation. 
Before the actual landings took place, first on 24 
March 1945 at Kerama Retto, and second on 
April at Okinawa, the facilities and personnel of 
Naval Intelligence were heavily taxed to provide 
the military forces involved with all of the infor-
mation they required. 
The overall planning and preparation phase 
consumed almost 7 months. During the first part 
of this period a major task was the consolidation 
of all accumulated information available on the 
area to be attacked, and the preparation of co-
ordinated plans and schedules for collecting new 
information. The bulk of accumulated informa-
tion was supplied by the Office of Naval Intelli-
gence, with additional information from such 
sources as JICPOA, the District Intelligence Offi-
cer, Fourteenth Naval District, the Office of Stra-
tegic Services, the Bishop Museum, the United 
States Geological Survey, the Hawaiian Pine-
apple Co., Pan-American Airways, and the Com-
mercial Pacific Cable Co. 
For the collection of new information the In-
telligence Section of ComPhibsPac enlisted the aid 
and support of some of the same sources plus the 
intelligence officers of the Fifth Fleet, Tenth 
Army, Fleet Marine Forces (Pacific), XXIV 
Corps, XXX Amphibious Corps, ComAirPac, 
Fast Carrier Force, and all amphibious groups.

with 0-2 was essential at all times. Prisoners of 
war were carefully interrogated, a conchologist 
from Arizona was employed; personnel of the 
United States Geological Survey Office in Hono-
lulu were interviewed; continuing aerial recon-
naissance of the area was scheduled and carried 
out; submarine reconnaissance was also conducted. 
The reproduction and distribution of adequate 
maps, charts, and printed material were tremend-
ous jobs. In addition to hydrographic charts of 
the area, Okinawa approach charts, bombardment 
charts, briefing charts, and anchorage charts of 
the staging areas were prepared. There were 
many essential maps, including road maps of 
Okinawa; air and gunnery maps, scale 1/25,000, 
from which gridded air support charts were pre-
pared; plotting maps of Okinawa, scale 1/100,000; 
special intelligence maps, scale 1/36,000 to show 
all defense installations; and rubber relief maps 
of the southern part of Okinawa, scale 1/10,000 
and 1/25,000. Printed material included a gen-
eral Information Bulletin on the area; a target 
analysis bulletin; graphic and tabular studies of 
the hydrography, reef, and beach conditions; a 
graphic terrain study; detailed studies of reefs, 
beaches, unloading conditions, surf and swell, 
weather, tide tables, and daylight-dark tables. 
Preliminary beach sketches showed the assault 
beaches and perspective, with salient features of 
each area. Controlled mosaics were prepared. 
By January 1945, the Intelligence Annex for the 
ComPhibsPac Operation Plan was completed, and 
annexes for the operation plans of subordinate 
units were underway. 
The distribution of all materials was begun in 
January and completed in February. It was, of 
course, necessary for every ship engaged in the 
operation, including those which might become 
involved, to receive an adequate supply of maps, 
charts, photographs, and all other prepared writ-
ten material. The size of the distribution problem 
is indicated by the fact that the approximately 
1,340 vessels involved in the operation were staged 
at seven different bases in the Western Pacific, and 
some were at sea most of the time. Special planes 
and officers were detailed for this particular job. 
The planning phase of this operation was ended 
when the Commander of the Joint Expeditionary 
Force departed from Iwo Jima on 9 March 1945 
CONFIDENTIAL 
330 
to embark the commanding general of the Tenth 
Army at Leyte. During the period en route to the 
objective area, the work of his Intelligence Sec-
tion increased. The coordination and dissemina-
tion of late information received from a variety 
of sources was most pressing. Up-to-the-minute 
photography was a particularly important item. 
The following plots were maintained: a strategic 
plot of enemy forces, including sea, land, sub-
marine, and air; a plot covering the movement of 
all allied task forces; a mine field plot; and a 
running intelligence plot of the objective area. 
Additional maps were prepared for the fire sup-
port ships. At the last minute, UDT reports and 
CVE photography were received. The briefing 
of all personnel, including coxswains, boat crews, 
shore and beach parties was undertaken by lower 
echelon intelligence officers. 
With the arrival of the invasion forces at Oki-
nawa, the last phase of the operation began. 
Speed now became a paramount consideration in 
the collection and dissemination of information 
during actual combat. ComPhibsPac assumed 
control of all photographic reconnaissance air-
craft, with the result that the Intelligence Section 
was required to furnish the pilots with all infor-
mation necessary to the efficient accomplishment 
of their various missions. The briefing of these 
photo aircraft by intelligence officers produced ex-
cellent coverage of designated areas. Photo-
graphic interpreters then worked closely with the 
Target Information Center to assist in locating 
targets and making damage assessments. Hydro-
graphic survey units, placed under the jurisdic-
tion of Intelligence, carried out extensive opera-
tions in laying buoys, setting up navigational aids, 
observing tides and currents, and making special 
studies of beaches and anchorages. Weather fore-
casts were issued twice daily. 
Captured materiel, documents, and prisoners 
were given a preliminary screening for informa-
tion of immediate value. Situation plots and the 
intelligence maps were constantly maintained, and 
briefing, especially of newly arrived commanders, 
was a continuing responsibility. Daily situation 
estimates were prepared. The problem of ade-
quate reproduction of photographs and maps re-
quired continuing attention. Finally, liaison 
between the various commands, particularly when

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND CONFIDENTIAL 
Army and Marine units moved ashore, was main-
tained to the extent physically possible. 
For the intelligence officers of subordinate com-
mands, the major problems were those of dissemi-
nation of information and liaison with other com-
mands engaged in this operation. Their partic-
ular responsibilities and effort dealt with their 
own immediate objectives, the beaches on which 
their respective forces were to land and the land-
ing approaches. On a smaller scale, their work 
was similar to that of the Intelligence System of 
ComPhibsPac. A most important task was the 
briefing of the lower echelons down to the person-
nel of the individual ships in order that everyone 
would be familiar with the general situation and 
the part each was to play. 
The Okinawa invasion provided a practical 
demonstration of the vital operational role played 
by Intelligence. Its collection, processing, and 
dissemination of information produced the knowl-
edge which made possible the Most effective and 
successful use of a vast, complex military machine 
geared to the requirements of amphibious warfare. 
MAPS AND CHARTS 
A thorough understanding of maps and charts 
as sources of information for intelligence is essen-
tial in intelligence activity, especially in connec-
tion with amphibious operations. In addition to 
familiarity with the types and scales of maps suit-
able for specific operations, the intelligence officer 
must be skilled in the principles of map reference 
systems to enable him to read all systems quickly 
and easily. This subject is completely covered in 
Field Manuals 21-25 and 21-26, which should be 
studied by every intelligence officer; a working 
knowledge of grid systems can be obtained from 
AMS Technical Manual No. 36 and AFR No. 96-5. 
The three types of maps and charts with which 
the intelligence officer is primarily concerned are: 
military maps, hydrographic charts, and aeronau-
tical charts. 
Military Maps 
In general, military maps may be classified by 
scale, use, or description. Scale is the criterion 
as to the amount of detail shown. Small scale 
maps are 1: 600,000 and smaller; medium scale 
331 
are larger than 1: 600,000, but smaller than 
1: 75,000; large scale are 1. : 75,000 and larger. 
A standard classification of military maps has 
been adopted by the armed forces of the United 
States, the United Kingdom, and Canada: 
1. General: Maps smaller than 1: 1,000,000?
utilized for general planning purposes. 
2. Strategic: 1: 1,000,000?utilized for strategic 
planning purposes. 
3. Strategic-Tactical: 1: 250,000 (1: 500,000 al-
ternate)?for use when other scales are un-
suitable or unavailable. 
4. Road: 1 : 250,000?for tactical and adminis-
trative troop movements. 
5. Tactical: 1: 50,000, and 1: 25,000 (1: 100,000 
alternate). 
6. Fire Control: 1: 25,000?fire control for artil-
lery, naval gunfire, and air. 
7. Photomap: 1: 25,000 (1: 12,500 alternate)?
for tactical and administrative purposes. 
8. Town Plans: 1: 12,500. 
9. Beach Maps: 1: 2,000?for tactical use by 
assault units during an amphibious opera-
tion. 
Hydrographic Charts 
Hydrographic charts are published primarily 
for navigational use and so are not designed as 
topographic maps. Generally, they include the 
outline of the adjacent land, together with the 
surface forms and artificial features that are use-
ful as aids to navigation. For certain special op-
erations, large scale hydrographic charts contain-
ing both topographic and hydrographic data may 
be prepared. Hydrographic charts show depths 
of water, nature of bottom, contours of bottom, 
and tides and currents in a given sea or sea and 
land area. The standard projection for hydro-
graphic charts is the Universal Transverse Mer-
cator Projection on different scales, depending on 
the use of the chart. Small-scale charts include 
large areas suitable for ocean navigation; large 
scale charts cover small areas suitable for coastal 
and harbor navigation. 
Aeronautical Charts 
An aeronautical chart is a specialized repre-
sentation of mapped features of the earth, or some 
part of it, produced to show selected terrain, cul-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
tural and hydrographic features, and supple-
mental information required for air navigation, 
pilotage, or for planning air operations. The 
World Geographic Reference System (short title: 
Georef ) is used on all aeronautical charts for ref-
erencing purposes in the control and direction of 
air forces engaged in large-area operations or 
those of global nature. This includes the control 
and direction of forces engaged in air defense, 
strategic air operations, air-sea rescue operations, 
and tactical air operations other than air support 
or amphibious operations, in which case the co-
operating air forces will employ the grid referenc-
ing system specified by the commander of the 
operations. 
LOGISTICS PLANNING 
A full treatment of logistics planning lies 
beyond the scope of this text, but the important 
relationship of intelligence to logistics merits 
consideration. 
Logistics relates to the procurement (design, 
manufacture, training), shipment and storage (or 
billeting) of materiel and personnel for military 
use. In the Navy this represents in a sense a com-
bination of the greater part of the efforts of the 
Supply Corps and of operations officers through-
out the service. The complexity of modern war 
and its enormous demands in men and materiel 
have been documented earlier in this volume. 
Successful campaigns do not depend on valor or 
will-to-win alone, but also on having the necessary 
tools and men delivered in sufficient concentra-
tions at the right places and times. This requires 
minute planning and considerable experience. 
Minute planning of a particular operation re-
quires a thorough knowledge of the area of opera-
tions and the capabilities of the enemy. 
Reference Tables 
The logistics officer on a naval staff is closely 
allied with the intelligence officer, for the latter in 
effect is the enemy logistics officer, and his knowl-
edge of the area of operations not only helps to 
assess enemy capabilities but is an essential ele-
ment in our own logistics planning. 
Our logistics experience not only helps to plan 
future operations, but in the absence of concrete 
CONFIDENTIAL 
332 
intelligence gives many clues to enemy capabili-
ties. We now have many volumes of basic data 
needed for logistics planning, such as the supply 
requirements, the man-hour costs, and the transit 
times over different kinds of terrain by various 
transport means. These data can serve as a gen-
eral guide to the intelligence officer in assessing 
both the overall strategic abilities and the tactical 
behavior of the enemy. His goal should be to 
develop detailed parallel tables on enemy logistics 
as rapidly as the information can be collected. 
His collection of intelligence on size of the divi-
sion slice, on speed of movement, on tons required 
to supply initially and to replenish given enemy 
units will ultimately lead to action by our own 
logistics planners to match or counter that of the 
enemy. 
There now are reference tables published in con-
venient form (see FM 101-10, and the Navy 
Logistics Handbook) that are equally useful to 
the logistics officer and the intelligence officer in 
their respective jobs. The intelligence officer can-
not hope to assess the enemy accurately unless he 
is first thoroughly familiar with the types of data 
we need to know for logistics planning for our 
own forces and until familiarity with our own 
needs can serve as a yardstick for assessing the 
enemy. 
Standard Components 
The logistics planning of the Navy is well illus-
trated in the standard ACORNs, ClUBs, LIONs 
and other types of advance bases developed in the 
last war. Our early war experience, sometimes 
accompanied by confusion, led to the development 
of standard components of men and materials 
that could be planned well in advance of actual 
campaigns. Based upon the missions assigned a 
future advance base and the intelligence on the 
area where it was to be located, a large base could 
be ordered from a catalogue of standard compo-
nent units. These units were assembled at interior 
supply depots or at coastal centers and packed for 
overseas shipment, often with unit markings al-
ready on the boxes. When the decision was made 
to establish a base at a particular location the clas-
sified code word (shipping designator) was

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND CONFluENTIAL 
printed on the boxes, and they were ready to move 
out in echelons to the forward area. Any combi-
nation of components these bases would need were 
thus readily available. 
Planning of bases extended beyond choosing 
of components. A shipping priority system as-
signed booking numbers to all cargo, both initial 
and replenishment. These were then linked di-
rectly to the number of ships assigned to the lift, 
which in turn were scheduled to match the best 
intelligence assessments of initial unloading ca-
pacity at the destination plus logistic assessment 
of expected increase in discharge capacity. 
A very large operation involves most detailed 
planning not only of the gunfire support, landing 
beaches, and air support targets, but also the cor-
rect scheduling of each combat loaded assault 
wave and each resupply echelon to get the right 
material to the right place at the time it is needed. 
The degree of success will be related to the team-
work demonstrated by operations, intelligence, and 
logistics on the staff concerned.

CHAPTER 14 
INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES 
The responsibility of intelligence to the com-
mander is never greater than when a new arm or 
tactic suddenly appears in the enemy's arsenal. 
Then intelligence must discover the capabilities 
and limitations of the new weapon or tactic and 
what countermeasures might be instituted. Such 
new developments that appeared in World War II 
were the V-1 and V-2 guided missiles, the Kami-
kaze tactic, and, on the Allied side, the atomic 
bomb. It is the purpose of this chapter to discuss 
some of the special activities that have gained 
prominence as techniques of war, namely, atomic 
warfare, guided missiles, biological and chemical 
warfare, guerrilla and partisan operations, eco-
nomic warfare, and psychological warfare. 
For the purposes of this discussion, the role of 
intelligence in support of these special activities 
is stressed. Here again, the intelligence cycle is 
in operation, and the intelligence officer is func-
tioning to assist strategic planners and field com-
manders. Collection, processing, and dissemina-
tion are the intelligence officer's special responsi-
bilities. In this respect, this chapter is merely an 
extension of those which have preceded it. 
ATOMIC WARFARE 
The advent of atomic weapons in the science of 
war has brought to the intelligence officer his 
greatest challenge in modern times. Not only 
must he have a basic understanding of the nuclear 
physics which creates atomic explosions, but he 
must also acquire a keen appreciation of the in-
telligence targets and problems presented by the 
different aspects of a vast new field of scientific 
research and development. His first responsibility 
thus becomes the one which is always of prime 
importance to his work: the maintenance of a full 
fund of knowledge. It is by no means an impos-
sible task, nor does he have to have professional 
scientific or engineering knowledge to comprehend 
it, for a tremendous amount of material is avail-
able in books, magazines, and newspapers which 
335 
can be understood by the average layman. For 
more technical treatment he can turn to the Atomic 
Energy Commission's semiannual reports to Con-
gress and the wealth of scientific reports continu-
ally flowing from the research centers and labora-
tories under the Commission's control. Further, 
he should read all the classified information 
available to his organization or activity. As 
developments in the atomic energy and nuclear 
power fields progress, more and more information 
is disseminated to all who need to know. 
It is to our credit as a nation that we offered to 
share our atomic secrets with the world in one of 
the most humane and generous gestures in re-
corded history. Soviet Russia, however, was not 
ready to accept this offer with all the free exchange 
of scientific information and open inspection of 
existing installations which were requisite to its 
successful operation; hence the world is engaged 
in a race for military supremacy in the use of a 
discovery which should be one of mankind's great-
est blessings. Since atomic weapons and nuclear 
power are new factors in current strategic esti-
mates of the situation, the intelligence officer must 
consider the capabilities of potential enemies in 
these fields and the nature of the essential elements 
of information required in a collection plan for 
atomic information. 
Indications of Atomic Research 
Here he meets a real problem in determining in-
dicators of atomic research and development. 
There is no single process for making an atomic 
bomb. There are at least two kinds of A-bombs, 
one made from uranium 235 and the other from 
plutonium, but both do have in common ultimate 
production from uranium. However, each kind 
can be made by three different separation processes, 
which means that there are six different ap-
proaches to A-bomb production, each of which 
allows considerable latitude in design of installa-
tions. Furthermore, when the processes of atomic 
CONFIDENTIAL

Approved For Release 2003/12/09 : CIA-RDP85G00105R000100210002-9 
CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
bomb production are broken down into their com-
ponent parts, the materials, apparatus, and proc-
esses are similar to those employed in familiar 
industrial enterprises. So our intelligence targets 
begin with the raw materials rather than with 
processing installations. Of these, uranium can 
be singled out as of prime interest. Other mate-
rials which are possible indicators of processes 
involved in atomic research and development in-
clude thorium, lithium, beryllium, graphite, deu-
terium (heavy water) , inorganic chemical reagents 
of high purity, and non-corrosive construction 
materials such as monel metal, nickel, and stainless 
steel. The essential elements of information for 
intelligence would be generally concerned with ore 
deposits, mining statistics, exports and imports, 
rates of production, and ultimate use of such 
materials. 
Our second atomic intelligence interest is di-
rected towards plants and equipment. Proximity 
of plants to water is a first indicator, for a nuclear 
reactor requires an elaborate water cooling sys-
tem. When the water is returned to the river or 
lake of its origin, it may still be hot enough to 
cause a rise in the temperature above normal. The 
building housing a reactor will be of considerable 
size, and electronic equipment will be required for 
remote-control handling of the product. Separa-
tion plants in plutonium extraction require under-
ground tanks for the disposal of radioactive waste. 
From the ventilating stacks of these tanks radio-
active dust may be widely scattered, not in suffi-
cient quantities to constitute a health hazard, but 
enough to make detection possible in the surround-
ing vegetation and water supply. 
Laboratory and engineering equipment of many 
kinds should be cause for investigation, although 
most of it is not used exclusively in nuclear energy 
development. Cyclotrons, electromagnets, com-
pressors, vacuum pumps, and ultra-high voltage 
generators, for example, have potential employ-
ment in atomic processes, and elaborate instru-
ments such as a mass spectrometer are essential to 
nuclear research. 
Third, we have an admirable indicator of atomic 
activity in the person of the nuclear scientist and 
his colleagues in atomic research and development, 
the engineers, chemists, geologists, physicists, met-
allurgists, and others of allied professions. The 
CONFIDENTIAL 
336 
activities of such people become essential elements 
of information in assessing any nation's atomic 
capability. The training of students in the nu-
clear sciences, the projects of university labora-
tories and research centers, and the security 
measures under which their work is carried on 
will all have meaning to the intelligence officer. 
The manufacture of an atomic weapon is an 
immense and difficult problem involving scientific 
and engineering ability of the highest order and 
the utilization of skilled manpower to such a 
degree that, in the present economic state of the 
world, very few nations could accomplish it, even 
though desirable. 
Nuclear Research Throughout the World 
We know of course that the United States, Can-
ada, and Great Britain originally pooled scientific 
knowledge of atomic energy in the common inter-
est. The French program is on a relatively small 
scale compared with that of the United States 
or even Britain. Belgium's contribution is of first-
class importance because of the uranium deposits 
in the Belgian Congo, which is the largest supplier 
of these ores to the United States. The Philips 
Company in Holland has an international repu-
tation as designers and manufacturers of particle 
accelerators for atomic research. Denmark is sec-
ond to none in fundamental research (Profs. Bohr 
and Ilevesy) but lacks the industrial potential for 
practical applications. Norway's atomic energy 
research and installations are particularly con-
cerned with the use of heavy water. Sweden has 
built a reactor and has the necessary high indus-
trial potential. Switzerland has the engineering 
techniques and physicists of international reputa-
tion (Dr. Paul Scherer). Nuclear research and 
discoveries of the greatest importance, led by 
Fermi and Anialdi, are Italian contributions. In-
dia has an Atomic Energy Commission and her 
scientists are famed for their genius in advanced 
mathematical research, which is of special value 
in nucleonics and the quantum mechanics asso-
ciated with it. India also has vast quantities of 
monozite sands, and Ceylon is potentially the 
world's richest source of thorium. South Africa 
and Australia have extensive programs of geologi-
cal exploration. It is probable that other nations 
have found sources of uranium or thorium ores in 
Approved For Release 2003/12/09 : CIA-RDP85G00105R000100210002-9 
Approved For Release 2003/12/09: 
INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT 
significant quantities, but are not publishing their 
presence to the world. 
As to the U. S. S. R. and Eastern Europe the 
unclassified information published represents only 
educated guesses. We do know that the infamous 
Klaus Fuchs gave the Russians not only the inti-
mate details of the A-bomb, but something of the 
potentialities of the H-bomb as well. He made it 
possible for Russian scientists to attain their goal 
at? least three and possibly as much as ten years 
sooner than they could have done it on their own. 
Russia exploded her A-bomb much sooner than 
we expected, and we can believe that she has been 
working on the H-bomb since 1045. Our own 
progress on the H-bomb continues to be highly 
classified information, although again reputable 
scientific reporters have made educated guesses. 
Thus far we have been dealing with atomic in-
telligence of a strategic nature. Let us proceed 
to consider the operational employment of atomic 
weapons and the responsibilities of an intelligence 
officer on the staff of a commander who must make 
decisions as to their use and also solve the prob-
lems of radiological defense. Such problems of 
command become the concern of the commander's 
staff. 
A-Weapons in Operational Command 
The introduction of new weapons of a nonper-
ceptible insidious character in warfare does not 
require a revamping of our organization in order 
to cope with it. It is quite evident, however, that 
it will demand wisdom, tact, and ingenuity on the 
part of the commander and his staff. A proven, 
easily demonstrated weapon is quickly countered 
by the optimum defense attainable. For the de-
fense against a weapon whose effects are either 
shrouded in secrecy or not easily observed, how-
ever, implicit faith in technical staff advisers will 
be necessary. 
Command problems in radiological defense may 
arise as a direct result of several factors. Lack 
of prior planning, for instance, will require quick 
decisions and improvised plans, some of which 
may easily prove to be disastrous. Lack of quali-
fied and trained personnel will cause serious de-
lays. Lack of equipment of rigorous and proved 
design can cause limitations in time of need. The 
absence of a well-trained and well-organized radio-
337 
CIA-RDP85G00105R000100210002-9 
OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES CONFIDENTIAL 
logical defense team can impose unnecessary time 
delays. Command problems directly attributable 
to these factors can be reduced. Other command 
problems arising out of unexpected employment 
of atomic weapons with regard to method, place, 
or timing can be minimized by thorough intelli-
gence and counterintelligence. In the final anal-
ysis, command problems can be solved by the 
adequate combination of the following:

Methods of Atomic Attack 
The extent of damage caused by the various 
types of atomic bursts and the characteristics of 
the explosions have been thoroughly studied. 
With proper protective measures and a radiologi-
cal defense plan the chances for survival under 
atomic attack have become very much increased, 
and many groundless fears have been dissipated 
by accurate knowledge gained from field tests. 
In an air burst of an atomic weapon, the pre-
dominant effects are blast, radiant heat, instant 
nuclear radiation, and secondary fires; the second-
ary effect is radioactive contamination which is 
relatively small. In the downwind direction, 
areas may be found contaminated by fall-out of 
radioactive material, although the degree of con-
tamination may not be a primary hazard. 
In an underwater burst, the predominant effects 
are radioactive fall-out contamination and water-
propagated blast which constitute an extremely 
serious threat. The water absorbs, shields, or 
minimizes the effects of instant nuclear radiation, 
air blast, radiant heat, and secondary fires. In 
order to obtain an extremely large volume of 
highly radioactive material on a target, the effect 
of blast and heat is reduced. 
The probable results of a subsurface ground 
burst are purely speculative, but some broad con-
clusions can be drawn by analogy with the under-
water burst. Predominant effects would be ra-
dioactive contamination (from the fall-out of 
soil-trapped fission products and from neutron-
induced reactions in the elements of the soil) and,

to a less extent, air and ground shock wave. Sec-
ondary effects would be instant nuclear radiation, 
radiant heat, and fires. Since the dissipation of 
the heat generated in a subsurface ground burst 
could be expected to be slower than in an under-
water burst, the cloud would rise higher and would 
be influenced more by wind conditions. 
Considering each of the effects of the various 
probable methods of employing an atomic weapon, 
it is seen that they impose large problems on the 
military commander. In addition, the civilian de-
fense organization will no doubt rely strongly on 
the zone of interior commander for advice, co-
ordination, and assistance, make his task even 
greater. The commander outside the zone of in-
terior may have to combine his efforts with those 
of a friendly power. This would further add to 
the responsibilities of that commander. 
Information From Tests 
Much profitable information and guidance can 
be extracted from experiences in operations involv-
ing large-area radiation contamination. A corn-
mand problem which was potentially very serious 
arose at the Baker test of Operation Crossroads. 
The Baker test explosion was different from those 
at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for there was an 
added hazard from the radioactive materials 
trapped in the water and rained on the target ves-
sels. Men walked through radioactive material 
scattered over the decks of the ships, tracked it 
around, and got it on their clothing and exposed 
parts of their bodies. Since they could not see, 
feel, nor smell it, they did not respect it, but they 
could eat it and they could inhale it. 
At Bikini, operations could be interrupted any 
time plans, group training, or operational tech-
niques became inadequate to assure complete pro-
tection to personnel. During combat, however, 
plans and training must be such that an organiza-
tion can continue to function. 
After the Bikini tests were completed, the target 
vessels were towed to Kwajalein and anchored in 
the lagoon for long-term storage. The need for 
further examination of the vessels was apparent, 
and it was also evident that a complete quarantine 
of the ships would not be practical. The ships 
contained large amounts of high explosives, in-
cluding some experimental ammunition and some 
CONFIDENTIAL 
338 
obtained from foreign navies. Removal of this 
ammunition was necessary, and the longer opera-
tions were deferred the more dangerous the work 
would become. 
Frequent briefings of the men were held by the 
officers to impress the need for caution, not only 
against the dangers from radioactivity, but also 
against the dangers of handling explosive mate-
rials and working in poorly ventilated spaces. 
The protective restrictions which were estab-
lished were more severe than those used at Bikini. 
Every tendency to relax precautions had to be 
countered by a psychological campaign on the part 
of the officers to insure compliance. This is typical 
of what may be expected in the future. If the 
nature of the danger is not directly observable, the 
control of the troops will present a complex prob-
lem. There is a vast difference between impressing 
a man with the fear of observable physical injury 
and impressing him with respect for invisible 
radioactivity. If there is careful indoctrination 
regarding radioactivity, the effect of atomic weap-
ons should be decreased. If proper respect is 
not instilled, the toll of lives will be increased. 
It seems that the command difficulties to be 
countered and the lessons to be learned in atomic 
warfare will include a repetition of some of the 
difficult experiences at Kwajalein. There will be 
others that are more complex. 
The value of any objective should be weighed 
against the cost of achieving it. The costs of 
achieving radiological objectives are not readily 
observable. When a man has been subjected to 
some cumulative absorption, which will be re-
ferred to as military tolerance, his usefulness for 
radiological defense (or attack) is impaired. Fur-
ther exposure will increase the liability of his be-
coming a casualty. When a commander has held 
his troops in an area of high radioactivity until he 
can observe the physical effects upon them, he has 
held them too long. 
The commander of the future must understand 
the nonperceptible hazards of atomic warfare and 
know how to evaluate them accurately. He must 
also know how to weigh the normal, calculated 
risks against the value of his military objective. 
He must understand the nature of radioactivity 
and the slowness with which it acts and makes 
itself evident. He must be willing to accept the

advice of a technical staff on such matters just as 
certainly as, under other circumstances, he would 
accept the information of troop losses. He can-
not shift to technical personnel the responsibility 
for failing to drive on to his military objectives, 
but he must give proper weight to their advice. 
Military command remains in his hands and can-
not be usurped by the adviser or the radiological 
monitors, but the commander cannot act efficiently 
if he ignores the advice of such technical person-
nel, who in such instances would actually give far 
more than advice. They would tell the commander 
the absolute facts and impress them upon him so 
that later substantiation by troop casualty lists 
and demoralization reports would be avoided. 
The United States has conducted many tests 
since Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the purpose of 
obtaining data which will enable the development 
of an efficient, adequate, and commendable radio-
logical defense operation. From each succeeding 
test come additional valuable lessons pertaining 
to radiation, lessons that will improve and perfect 
the overall concept of radiological defense. 
Captain Frank I. Winant, Jr., USN, Chief of 
the Radiological Defense Division, Armed Forces 
Special Weapons Project, concluded a lecture at 
the Army Medical Center in 1949 with the follow-
ing observation: 
We must not leave our problems of opera-
tional development unsolved awaiting a hur-
ried solution under conditions of actual war-
fare. Future atomic tests should be very 
useful for developing our standard opera-
tional procedures and organizations, and 
military personnel should be employed in 
radiological defense work in these tests to in-
crease our service experience. These tests are 
few and far between and are sometimes lim-
ited to specialized objectives. Since they fall 
short of the disaster conditions toward which 
our planning must be pointed, it seems vital 
that there be operational development within 
the services. We have a great deal to do in 
properly evaluating the air reconnaissance of 
radiological areas, in determining the value 
of helicopters for radiological survey, in per-
fecting remote and projectable telemetering 
instruments and techniques, and in complet-
ing time studies and work planning and on-
the-spot orientation methods for such condi-
tions. We have a great deal more planning to 
do in the matter of provision of adequate and 
339 
timely personnel replacements in radiologi-
cally hazardous areas. 
Operational development work will provide 
a continuous testing of textbook training and 
prevent stagnation of training doctrine. 
Without it our training in theoretical aspects 
can advance only to the limit of the most re-
cent physics text and in its practical aspects 
to the limits of the last information which has 
emanated from atomic tests. 
No discussion of this nature could be com-
plete without some reference to civil defense. 
Since most of us have families, we are natur-
ally interested in this problem. The armed 
services are responsible for effecting their pri-
mary military missions in wartime and will, 
in general, be unable to effect civil defense. 
Recognizing this condition, it is proper that 
the military should keep out of civil defense 
as much as possible. This will confront the 
Civil Defense Organization with the responsi-
bility of growing up to meet its own problems. 
It would be sheer folly, however, to overlook 
the fact that civil defense will have a great 
influence on our capabilities to wage war. 
The next war may very well be won or lost 
on the home front. Recognizing this, we are 
trying to do what we can in support of civil 
defense without complicating it. Our re-
search programs are pointed toward develop-
ing equipment which will be as useful to the 
civil defenders as to the military. The field 
of radiological defense, from its inception, 
has been a universal field with universal lan-
guage, equipment, techniques, and training. 
It is a military goal to increase our readiness 
in equipment and trained personnel so near 
to the service requirements that if called upon 
in emergency we can dispatch radiological 
defense personnel to any point necessary. To 
this end we have initiated a truly joint train-
ing program with the Army, Navy, and Air 
Force turning out of their own schools joint 
student groups who have been trained in joint 
curricula under joint staffs so that in emer-
gency they can be banded together quickly 
and work together with intelligence and pre-
cision as they did in Operation Sandstone. 
Nuclear Power 
When in August 1951, the Navy announced that 
a contract had been let to the Electric Boat Co. 
of Groton, Conn., for construction of an atomic 
powered submarine, a new era in naval warfare 
was born. The implications of this new develop-
ment are obvious, for such an undersea craft may 
well revolutionize modern concepts of naval

power. Tactical employment of submarines which 
approach a Jules Verne ideal conjures up a host 
of speculation upon the future of the surface ships 
which are the submarines' common target. 
We can only conjecture what further develop-
ments in nuclear power will mean on the sea and 
in the air. One thing is certain: the intelligence 
officer will have to meet their challenge with flexi-
bility of mind, ready to cast off obsolete ideas, and 
concentrate all his powers of imagination, resource-
fulness, and initiative upon the new problems they 
pose. Once again the maintenance of a full fund 
of knowledge is paramount. He must study the 
capabilities of various aircraft as potential de-
liverers of atomic weapons and think of what they 
can do if controlled and operated by the enemy. 
With such knowledge he will more capably sup-
port his commander. 
GUIDED MISSILES 
A "Guided Missile" is defined by the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff as "an unmanned vehicle moving 
about the earth's surface whose trajectory or flight 
path is capable of being altered by a mechanism 
within the vehicle." In other words, it is a pilot-
less aircraft with built-in intelligence. The basic 
components of any, guided missile are: an air-
frame; a propulsion unit; a guidance system; and 
a warhead. The laws of subsonic and supersonic 
flight determine the design of the airframe. As 
for the propulsion unit, the jet engine is the only 
existing motive system capable of economically 
producing the tremendous power necessary to 
launch guided missiles and propel them to super-
sonic speeds. The two main types of jet engines 
are the atmospheric jet and the rocket jet. The 
former may be subdivided into Pulse jets, Ram 
jets and Turbo jets (for use in the atmosphere) ; 
the latter into Liquid fuel rockets and Solid fuel 
rockets (for use in and beyond the atmosphere). 
Guidance systems under development today in-
clude radio or radar command, terrestial naviga-
tion, automatic celestial navigation, three-dimen-
sional "dead-reckoner" called the inertial sys-
tem, a preset course computer, and various types 
of homing devices which respond variously to 
light, radio, sound or infrared emissions, radar 
reflectivity, or magnetic features of the target. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
340 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
The warhead may be of the high explosive, frag-
mentary, or special weapons categories. Or, in 
the case of reconnaissance missiles, the warhead 
may be replaced by a series of still, movie, or tele-
vision cameras. 
Their greatest advantage is that they do not 
subject the lives of trained personnel to enemy fire. 
Therefore, the weight normally occupied by a 
pilot, guns, protective armament, landing gear, 
and survival gear, can be devoted to make the pilot-
less aircraft fly higher, faster, and farther. 
The future potentialities of guided missiles are 
so great that they may one day comprise one of the 
major components of armed forces intelligence. 
Therefore, any reported foreign development is 
of tremendous technical and scientific interest. 
Early Progress 
The Russians pioneered in the military applica-
tion of rockets, while the Germans led the world 
in the development of effective guidance systems. 
In Germany, a large group of rocket enthusiasts 
was at work in the early 1920's striving to break 
the barriers to travel beyond the earth. At several 
periods between the wars the German Army took a 
direct interest in rockets, foreseeing military ap-
plications, and by the middle 1930's specific mili-
tary experimentation was underway, well guarded 
from public knowledge, at the Baltic Coast sta-
tion of Peenemiinde. Several teams of engineers 
were at work. One group produced a robot air-
plane powered with a pulse-jet engine, the V--/. 
It carried almost one ton of explosives, had a range 
of about 125 miles, and a speed of about 425 miles 
per hour. It was launched from a ramp by a 
booster, then leveled out on a preset course from 
which it dived either on command of a cock mecha-
nism or when the fuel gave out. It was simple in 
construction, requiring only 500 man-hours, and its 
pulse-jet engine termed "flying stove pipe" had no 
moving parts other than a flap valve at the air 
intake. Approximately 10,000 were shot toward 
Britain beginning a few days after D-day in 
Normandy. Of these the British spotted 8,081, 
and managed to shoot down 3,765 with fighter 
aircraft or ant Laircraft guns. Some 2,340 are 
known to have reached London, destroying or 
damaging one million homes, killing 6,000 persons, 
and wounding 37,000 more. It should be noted

that the V-1 was neither a rocket nor was it com-
pletely guided, except by clockwork. 
The main group of engineers at Peenemfinde 
was at work on a technically more significant, 
though at the time less successful, military 
weapon: the long range rocket with supersonic 
speed. The one pushed to completion for opera-
tional use was the A-4, popularly known as the 
V?s. With a range of about 200 miles, a speed 
of 3,500 miles per hour, and a 2,150 pound war-
head, it was launched vertically from any level 
hard surface to arch through the stratosphere and 
then drop without warning on its target. Inter-
ception was impossible because it travelled at 
nearly five times the speed of sound. Pin-point 
accuracy was not required, since it was directed 
at concentrated urban areas. It represented a 
great technological achievement, although less 
effective than the V-1. Its cost was very high, 
about 5,000 man-hours. 
The German experimenters also made progress 
with much more fearsome weapons. The A-4b, 
later improved to the A-9, was an A-4 with wings 
to increase its gliding range. Not tested was a 
two-stage rocket, the A9/A10 which was to speed 
an A-9 across the Atlantic to fall on New York 
30 minutes after launching in Europe. A still 
larger, three stage A9/A10/A14 combination was 
to throw the A9 into space in a permanent orbit 
around the earth serving as a weapon to be 
dropped by radio command on any target in the 
world, or as an observation station and radio relay 
point, and later as the start of a manned station 
in space. 
The Germans also developed whole families of 
other special purpose missiles. They were de-
signed for launching either from ground sites, air-
craft, or surfaced submarines, and could be em-
ployed against surface targets or aircraft. The 
most advanced surface-launched antiaircraft mis-
siles were the Schmetterling and the Wasserfall, 
both of which were tracked optically and con-
trolled by radio or radar. The air-to-air missiles 
included the .1-4 and the HS-298. The latter was 
tracked optically through a pair of binoculars 
from the launching plane, and course corrections 
were cranked in by radio. To overcome Allied 
attempts at jamming, controls were sent to the 
1-4 through a fine, flexible wire training back to 
341 
the launching plane. The Germans also had two 
air-to-surface missiles, which proved quite effec-
tive. The Fritz-X, a 3,000 pound radio-con-
trolled bomb, was used to sink the modern Italian 
battleship Roma when she was fleeing to join the 
Allies. And the HS-293, an 1,100 pound radio-
controlled missile, made successful attacks on 
Allied merchant ships, and also sank 7 destroyers 
in the Dodecanese. 
At the end of the war, German scientists, blue-
prints, test models, and partially completed mis-
siles fell into the hands of all principal victors. 
They have since provided the basis for postwar 
developments in both the United States and the 
U. S. S. B. 
Recent Developments 
The years since World War II have been devoted 
both to basic research and to developing interim 
tactical models. The United States used its stock 
of V?.'s as one phase of its upper atmosphere re-
search program, in one case throwing a second 
stage rocket, WAG-Corporal, into space a distance 
of 250 miles. The effort has involved metallurgy 
and ceramics to find materials that would with-
stand the terrific heat of rocket motors; chemistry 
to find dependable fuels delivering higher exhaust 
velocities; wind tunnels and mechanical brains to 
determine aerodynamic behavior; and especially, 
guidance systems to improve the long range ac-
curacy of such weapons. 
Guided missiles in this country have become a 
major item in the military budget, with a special 
office to coordinate the independent research of 
Army, Navy, and Air Force. 
Space Travel 
As early as December 1948, it was announced 
that the efforts of the individual services to de-
velop satellite vehicles were to be combined. Satel-
lite vehicles, already within present day technical 
capabilities, could well be followed by manned sta-
tions in space. The Air Force has underway long-
range development programs that include studies 
of space medicine to anticipate the effects of lack 
of gravity, acceleration, cosmic radiation, and 
meteor incidence on the human organism. In pub-
lic information releases, the Air Force has already 
spoken of travel not only within the Solar System

but eventually many light years away to other 
stars, suggesting that Wolf 359, some 8 light years 
away may be an early goal. Today's chemical 
fuels probably can give us a space station, though 
at considerable cost. A workable atomic drive, 
already blue-printed in several public proposals, 
or some entirely new propulsion system will be 
needed for further exploration. Even if the new 
fuels do not appear, by the costly stockpiling of 
material at a space station we can not only reach 
the moon but penetrate to Mars as well. 
Therefore, interplanetary travel is essentially 
an extension of intercontinental missile activity. 
The reason for dwelling at such length on these 
rather fantastic topics is their intelligence impli-
cations. In World War II, Allied intelligence 
began to get strange reports about German activi-
ties at Peenemiinde, and pinpointed air attacks on 
this center were important in disrupting activities 
there. Runaway rockets which crashed on Swed-
ish soil were recovered and subjected to careful 
analysis so that their nature and capabilities could 
be determined. Aerial photographs and reports 
from agents told about the preparation of launch-
ing sites. The invasion of Normandy came none 
too soon to save considerable destruction by Ger-
man V weapons. Because of their potentialities, 
prompt technical intelligence steps were required 
to capture personnel and data on German experi-
ments. 
Thus some acquaintance with the field of guided 
missiles is a new requirement in the intelligence 
officer's full fund of knowledge. Ile should read 
all available literature and seek opportunities to 
learn all he can from those who are engaged in this 
special branch of warfare. 
BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL WARFARE 
Biological warfare (BW) is warfare waged by 
means of biological agents to produce death or dis-
ease in men, animals, and plants. Chemical war-
fare (CW) employs nonexplosive chemicals (es-
pecially war gases, smokes, and incendiaries) for 
the same purpose. 
Biological and Chemical warfare intelligence 
are concerned with the research and the prepara-
tions for operations by foreign nations in these 
forms of toxic warfare. Targets of this intelli-
gence interest are the materials and techniques 
CONFIDENTIAL 
342 
employed, and the toxic warfare characteristics of 
all possible theaters of operations, including 
weather, hyd.rography, and terrain. 
The subject material of the following pages will 
introduce the intelligence officer to biological and 
chemical warfare, and outline the additional re-
sponsibilities that become his in fields where sci-
ence is making a deep impact upon modern 
military strategy and tactics. It becomes even 
more significant when we consider the fact that 
our enemies are very much interested in its 
development. 
Biological Warfare 
Biological warfare is old in the history of the 
human race, having been waged against man by 
man at least since Old Testament times and against 
man for many thousands of years by nature. As 
a technique, it has been described as "preventive 
medicine in reverse" and demands little more of 
our industry and science than a change in point 
of view. 
Biological warfare is defined as warfare waged 
by the use of organisms or their toxic products to 
cause disease in man, animals or plants. It is 
distinguished from other methods of warfare by 
three striking characteristics: (1) Its action is 
wholesale and indiscriminate. It is a method of 
mass killing, and as such may be extremely dc-
moralizing; (2) Its action is diffusive and tends 
to spread rapidly in all directions. In this respect 
it is unique. It has been compared to the spread-
ing of flames from an incendiary bomb and to an 
atomic chain reaction; (3) It is not destructive of 
property. Un like conventional or atomic shelling 
or bombing, it never destroys buildings, machines, 
or other dead matter, and can accomplish its pur-
pose by affecting plants or domestic animals rather 
than human beings. 
At its present stage, biological warfare is by no 
means comparable to atomic warfare in destructive 
power. This is partly due to the problems of 
producing and preserving sufficient amounts of 
BW agents but even more to the difficulty of dis-
seminating them widely enough to have a mili-
tarily significant effect. Biological warfare is, 
however, far cheaper than atomic warfare. It is 
also more insidious and better suited to sabotage, 
especially in a time of ostensible peace.

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES CONFIDENTIAL 
There are four types of disease-producing or-
ganisms, or pathogens: bacteria, fungi, viruses, 
and rickettsias. (Certain specimens of these types 
are harmless or otherwise not suitable for BW.) 
It should be noted that "bacteriological warfare," 
once a common term, is too narrow in its denota-
tion. Typhus, for example, is a rickettsial dis-
ease; and so the use of typhus culture as a BW 
agent would, for consistency, have to be called 
"rickettsial warfare." For this reason the term 
"biological warfare" is now general. 
Suitability of Diseases for BW 
To be suitable for BW, a disease must have cer-
tain characteristics. It should be highly. commu-
nicable, infectious, i. e., able to breakdown the de-
fensive mechanism of the host, and virulent, i. e., 
deadly or disabling. These criteria are self-
evident. Unless a disease can spread rapidly, take 
hold and run its course, and cripple or enfeeble 
its victims, it cannot seriously affect morale or 
capacity to resist. 
It must be borne in mind, however, that the 
characteristics of a disease depend in part on the 
conditions under which it is used. Thus measles, 
a single attack of which ordinarily confers life-
long immunity, would probably not be very infec-
tious in most countries except among small 
children. Any disease chosen for BW will likely 
be one to which the population attacked is sus-
ceptible, due regard being given to acquired 
immunity. 
Methods of Dissemination 
BW agents may be disseminated: (1) by air, in 
the form of aerosols (suspensions of solid or liquid 
particles in air) , as occurs with common colds, 
influenza, diphtheria, and measles; (2) by contam-
ination of food or water, as occurs with typhoid 
and cholera; (3) by contact or contagion; (4) by 
carrier, such as a rodent or insect "vector," as 
occurs with typhus, malaria, Rocky Mountain 
spotted fever, and plague. 
A given disease may be transmitted by more 
than one of the above methods, and also by others, 
such as inoculation. It need not be transmitted 
in the way that is usual in nature; certain vector 
diseases can be effectively disseminated by air. 
Aerosol diseases are easily spread, and the result-
343 
ing epidemics are hard to control. They are thus 
especially suitable for BW. The other types are 
not easy to introduce on a large scale and, except 
for vector diseases, are fairly easy to control by 
ordinary sanitation and case isolation. Accord-
ingly, overt BW could be waged by means of filled 
missiles and munitions, projected or airborne, to 
create BW clouds (aerosols). Covert BW can also 
be effected with aerosols, although the possibility 
of contamination or the use of vectors cannot be 
ignored. 
Weather and terrain factors may favor or im-
pede dissemination by the aerosol method. The 
best conditions for spreading aerosols are high 
humidity, low temperature, moderate wind, and 
dim light. The direction of the wind is important, 
since naturally the BW cloud must be released to 
windward of its objective. Personnel on high 
ground may be unaffected by a BW cloud. Heavy 
vegetation diminishes initial concentration and 
persistence, and buildings or dugouts tend to 
screen out the BW agent. 
Production and Use 
In addition to being able to cause a "suitable" 
disease under given circumstances and being sus-
ceptible to dissemination in a given environment, a 
BW agent must be adaptable to large-scale produc-
tion. Such production depends chiefly on the 
medical and biological sciences and industries and 
does not presuppose great resources, a vast and 
varied industrial plant, or the other components of 
national power in conventional or atomic warfare. 
BW is especially suitable for clandestine use, 
since preparations for it are easy to conceal. Con-
spicuous plants and equipment, such as must be 
used in producing conventional or atomic weapons, 
are not needed. Furthermore, a relatively small 
supply of a BW agent is sufficient to infect even a 
large population. 
Intelligence Problems 
The identification of a BW attack and the deter-
mination of its source may prove to be an intelli-
gence enigma. The attack may first become evi-
dent through such indications as an outbreak of

such as disease and death among animals, the un-

The following factors provide an index of a 
Nation's BW capabilities and vulnerabilities: (1) 
the level of medical and biological science; (2) the 
technological level, size, and flexibility of the bio-
logical and pharmaceutical industry and in par-
ticular, its capacity to produce cultures, antibi-
otics and immunizing agents on a large scale; (3) 
the adequacy of medical personnel and facilities; 
(4) the system of communications and transpor-
tation for evacuating afflicted areas, bringing them 
help, etc.; (5) the target population, particularly 
with respect to whether it is steadfast and well-
informed and equipped in matters of sanitation; 
(6) BW research and training; (7) internal secu-
rity to prevent sabotage; (8) intelligence of BW 
scientific and technical developments, the BW 
capabilities, vulnerabilities, and probable courses 
of action of all Nations, and the BW character-
istics of strategic areas. 
Chemical Warfare 
Chemical warfare is defined as warfare waged 
by the use of smokes, incendiaries, and poison 
gases. 
In some respects it is unlike BW. It is not so 
indiscriminate, its action can be localized fairly 
well, and, of course, it does not have the same 
diffusive or "chain reaction" effect. On the other 
hand, like BW it can produce casualties without 
damaging installations and serves its purpose if 
it merely disables or demoralizes without killing 
personnel. The methods of dissemination are sim-
ilar. For toxic CW agents, the most useful appear 
to be the aerosol method, such as spraying from 
aircraft, and the filled-munitions methods by us-
ing bombs, shells, or grenades. 
History of CW 
CW has an extensive history. The Germans 
initiated it in World War I by launching a large-
scale chlorine attack at Ypres on 22 April 1915. 
Though almost totally unprepared, the Allies soon 
CONFIDENTIAL 
344 
began to retaliate. By the time of the Armistice, 
chemical shells constituted the following percent-
ages of all ammunition being expended: United 
States 15 percent, British 25 percent, French 35 
percent, German 50 percent. About 39 different 
CW agents were developed during World War I, 
the best known being mustard and lewisite gases 
(vesicants) , phosgene and chlorine (choking 
gases) , and hydrogen cyanide (a "nerve" or 
"blood" gas). -Various irritant smokes, tear gases, 
incendiaries, and screening smokes were also 
developed. 
In World War II, for practical purposes, poison 
gas was not used at all, the deterrent being fear 
of retaliation. The Allies were known to be well 
prepared for CW counterattack, and it is also 
quite possible that Hitler, who was gassed as a 
corporal in World War I, abhorred poison gases 
and opposed their use. Other CW agents, how-
ever, such as incendiary bombs, flamethrowers, 
screening smokes, and "napalm," were used and 
new ones were developed. 
Though they abstained from using poison gas, 
the Germans developed a new class of "nerve 
gases," called "G" (for "German") gases, which 
belong to a class of organic compounds called 
"Trilons." Their properties make them deadly 
war gases. One of them, "GD," for example, is 
100 times as toxic as mustard gas. They are mod-
erately persistent to persistent, colorless, odorless, 
tasteless, and otherwise difficult to detect, and 
their physiological action is very rapid. These 
gases exist in both the liquid and the vapor states. 
As liquids, they are absorbed into the bloodstream 
through the skin and may cause death within a 
few minutes. Known antidotes or decontamina-
tion agents are effective only if used immediately. 
As gases, they are absorbed into the bloodstream 
through the lungs, when inhaled, and in this form 
they present little serious threat to anyone pro-
tected by a standard United States protective 
mask, since no significant amount of the vapor is 
absorbed through unbroken skin. If absorbed 
through broken skin, however, or inhaled without 
a protective mask, the vapor in low concentratiOns 
produces headache, nausea, retching, and pupil-
lary contraction so great that it may cause blind-
ness, and in high concentrations, paralysis of the 
respiratory muscles.

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES CONFIDENTIAL 
GUERRILLA AND PARTISAN OPERATIONS 
Intelligence has a two-fold concern with guer-
rilla warfare. One is the production of intelli-
gence suited to the special requirements of guer-
rilla and partisan operations, and the other results 
from the fact that intelligence officers are fre-
quently assigned to such groups for liaison pur-
poses in an advisory capacity, or to participate in 
the execution of their missions. Guerrilla war-
fare depends more on accurate intelligence than 
on mass force for successful operations, and its 
varied activities provide certain collection oppor-
tunities not afforded by more conventional opera-
tions. 
Missions of Guerrilla Forces 
Guerrillas are usually assigned missions which 
include the following: (1) Destruction of trans-
portation and telecommunications facilities; (2) 
Destruction of crops, stored supplies, and fac-
tories; (3) Harassment of isolated troops, supply 
convoys, unit command posts, and air installa-
tions; (4) ColleCtion and transmission of intelli-
gence?including the taking of prisoners for in-
formation; (5) Political attack by assassinating 
enemy leaders, spreading propaganda, and ter-
rorizing civilians; and (6) Combined operations, 
both offensive and defensive, with regular forces. 
It is easy to see that intelligence can play a most 
important role in the fulfillment of any one of 
these missions. Assignment to duty with guer-
rillas is by no means limited to Army intelligence 
personnel; in World War II, naval intelligence 
officers served with such forces in Europe, Asia, 
and the islands of the Pacific. 
Strength and Composition 
Guerrilla units, although generally thought of 
as small, may vary considerably in size, depending 
on terrain, environment, and enemy activity. 
Examples exist of successful guerrilla forces of 
as many as 30,000 men. The significant organiza-
tional characteristic of guerrilla operations is not 
that the forces are small but that the separate tac-
tical entities are often small in comparison, with 
conventional units and their armament is gen-
erally light, consisting of small arms, demolition 
materials and perhaps mortars. 
209196-54---23 
Ideally, every guerrilla unit has at least one 
radio operator, one explosives expert, and a person 
with medical knowledge. Military experience is 
of course desirable but not absolutely necessary, 
for the operations of guerrilla warfare have pecu-
liar requirements and a variety of talents can be 
used to advantage. Marksmen from gun clubs, 
expert horsemen, hunters and trackers, miners 
who can handle dynamite, loggers who know how 
to control the fall of a tree, construction men, 
chemists to make explosives, mechanics to repair 
and operate captured vehicles or tanks?all are 
welcome in guerrilla ranks. Above all, an able 
leader is required, one who possesses the ability 
to inspire his men and who sets an example by 
his own daring and ingenuity. He must be able 
to control his men, for without a certain amount 
of discipline a guerrilla detachment becomes 
merely a group of individual bandits with no com-
mon goal or method. 
Knowledge of Operating Area 
Guerrillas should operate in areas thoroughly 
familiar to themselves if they are to capitalize on 
their limited strength. Knowledge of the area 
of operations in the intelligence sense then be-
comes of the utmost importance. There are hide-
outs and caches to be prepared and escape routes 
to be planned. Terrain and cover must be studied 
to determine what areas can be traversed without 
detection from ground or air. Camouflage re-
quirements need advance study and planning. 
The territory must be equally well known in the 
dark. The guerrilla does not try to hold ground. 
He uses his exact knowledge of the area to out-
distance the enemy, to avoid his attention, to plan 
and carry out attacks. He must always be on the 
alert, since he lives by his wits. 
Support Requirements 
Major success by irregular troops or guerrillas 
require considerable support and sympathy of 
the resident population, logistics support from 
the outside, and coordinated action with other 
guerrilla units and also with any friendly forces 
in the area. Sympathetic inhabitants will furnish 
them with food, provide necessary information 
about the enemy, and protect them from betrayal.

tion from friendly territory, continued operations 
against modern armies are arduous and often 
futile. Coordinated efforts in irregular attacks 
are necesary even if the only goal is harassment. 
When guerrillas are in close proximity to friendly 
military forces, their operations can be of im-
measurable aid if controlled by the theater 
commanders. 
ECONOMIC WARFARE 
In chapter 5 the scope of economic intelligence 
was outlined, and its importance in the strategic 
assessment of military power was emphasized. In 
succeeding chapters economic resources were shown 
to be basic elements of power among nations, and 
some of the problems of international economic 
relations and trade were discussed. This section 
will illustrate how economic intelligence can be 
directly used as the basis for the form of uncon-
ventional warfare called economic, which can sup-
port military aims in war and if the need arises 
also be effectively used in times of peace. 
The Concept of Economic Warfare 
Economic warfare has many weapons and pur-
poses, but fundamentally it deals with the fact 
that a strong and healthy economy is important 
to long-range success in both military and political 
spheres. The disruption of normal economic 
processes or interference with economic planning 
will upset the time tables of military or political 
programs. 
Modern war is a burden no nation can "afford" 
to carry, but it continues to be practiced because 
the alternatives seem even less desirable. Since 
the economic cost of war in resources, man-hours, 
capital investment, population shifts, financial 
debt, redistributed income, and inflation is so 
great, properly planned economic warfare meas-
ures can make the burden intolerable and bring 
the war to an end. 
Economic warfare alone is seldom successful; it 
usually requires military strength to enforce its 
measures. Since ancient times, wars have been 
fought for economic gain, but even for the victors 
there was always been economic loss to a greater 
or lesser degree. 
. Let us consider some of the specific devices used 
as economic warfare measures: blockade, navicerts, 
CONFIDENTIAL 
A 
346 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
black lists, embargos, exchange controls, preemp-
tive buying, rationing of neutrals, and strategic 
attack. 
Blockade 
Blockade is one of the oldest military tactics. 
Laying siege to a fortress until its food or water 
supply was exhausted brought surrender without 
heavy casualties to the attackers. On a larger 
scale, much of the history of sea warfare has in-
volved interference with the commerce of the en-
emy. By the time of World War I, the application 
of this measure through blockade had developed 
to the point where it resulted in starvation in Ger-
many and an accompanying deterioration of mo-
rale and will to resist. The German countermeas-
ure was unrestricted submarine attack on ships 
going to the British Isles. Insofar as it made an 
issue of freedom of the seas and brought the United 
States into the war on the British side, it was a 
grievous error, but economically and militarily it 
was a logical and nearly successful step toward 
German victory. 
The Germans repeated these tactics in World 
War II not only to prevent the delivery of war 
weapons and materiel, but also to deplete the stocks 
of essential war materials. Their attacks against 
lend-lease shipments destroyed not only guns, 
tanks, and planes in transit to our allies, but also 
hundreds of thousands of tons of oil, foodstuffs, 
lumber, chemicals, and textiles. 
Our war against Japan from the Navy point of 
view included an economic attack through block-
ade operations. Our "silent service," the sub-
marine of the Fleet, can take much credit for the 
ultimate victory. Japan was an ideal target for 
such a program because its crowded home islands 
depended on imported food and raw materials 
both to fight and to live. It would be an over-
simplification of the facts to say the war could 
have been won by submarines alone, for the lives 
of many brave men on ships, on land, and in air-
craft were sacrificed to make victory possible, but 
the potentialities of submarine warfare in block-
ade measures to weaken an enemy are very great 
indeed. 
Economic war fare through blockade is not con-
fined to actual combat operations. It can be 
equally effective in times of ostensible peace. Eco-

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES CONFIDENTIAL 
nomic sanctions were used by certain nations 
against Italy at the time of the attack on Ethiopia. 
Their failure to influence Italian policy by cutting 
off vital imports can only be attributed to the 
fact that the sanctions were not imposed by all 
nations trading with Italy. 
Blockadge has also been used since World War 
II for economic warfare purposes. The Soviets 
tried it in Berlin in 1948. The successful counter-
measure, the costly airlift, was an added burden on 
our military budget, but its salutary effects on the 
free world were well worth the economic cost. 
We have also attempted a partial blockade of 
the Iron Curtain countries, because we have not 
wanted to supply the metals and machinery which 
would hasten the attainment of Soviet goals for 
military expansion. This has not been entirely 
successful, because the economic characteristics of 
the large Iron Curtain block are such that blockade 
alone cannot solve the problem. 
Navicerts 
A navicert (navigation certificate) is a device 
for controlling the activities of neutral vessels. 
The British have pioneered in this form of block-
ade and have used it successfully in two world 
wars. It is simply a certificate issued by author-
ized British officials, such as consuls, exempting 
a non-contraband cargo from seizure or search by 
patrol vessels maintaining a blockade. Thus ship-
ping to neutral ports and the type of cargo carried 
by neutral vessels to enemy ports can be rigidly 
controlled. Cargoes not correctly manifested and 
covered by navicert are promptly confiscated. 
Black Lists 
In attempting to eliminate German influence in 
Latin America and to end neutral interference 
with blockade measures during World War II, 
the Allies effectively used the black list method. 
Economic intelligence uncovered the irregular ac-
tivities of firms and individuals trading with the 
enemy, and a business house whose activities were 
discovered to be inimical to Allied interests was 
blacklisted. Even firms in a neutral country were 
threatened with reprisals for doing business with 
those on the black list. 
Embargoes 
Embargoes are simply prohibitions imposed by 
law upon commerce, such as government edicts 
prohibiting the departure or entry of ships at 
certain ports. They may be used to correct mar-
ket supply and demand problems, to protect health, 
and to relieve traffic congestion. The embargo 
can also be used in economic warfare, but to be 
an effective weapon it has to be applied to com-
modities for which no substitutes are available or 
which cannot be supplied from alternative sources. 
The identification of such commodities is a job for 
economic intelligence. 
The U. S. placed embargoes on oil and scrap 
metal exports to Japan in 1941 in the hope of 
stopping her production in preparation for war. 
They were not successful, for factions in Japan 
were determined on war, and the embargoes may 
even have hastened the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
As a policy, however, it was a logical measure at 
the time. 
Exchange Control 
The usual purpose of exchange control is to 
conserve limited supplies of foreign exchange to 
insure essential imports, to stabilize exchange 
rates and domestic prices, to control flights of 
capital, or to prevent black market activities. Ex-
change control, however, like all other economic 
devices, can be subverted to economic warfare ends. 
For example, espionage and propaganda on a large 
scale are expensive; if exchange controls can limit 
the availability of funds for these purposes, the 
enemy effort can be crippled. Likewise, if control 
over use of exchange is tight, and dollar currency 
is in great international demand, then it will be 
exceedingly difficult for the enemy to buy essential 
goods in world markets. If exchange control can 
manipulate exchange rates, it can make purchases 
very costly for the enemy even where trade con-
tinues. In support of national policy, many coun-
tries in recent years have used multiple exchange 
rates which enable the offering of favorable rates 
to encourage desired activities without damage to 
the overall exchange and trade patterns. The 
mechanics used are beyond the scope of this study. 
Really effective exchange controls require a con-
siderable amount of economic intelligence, for not 
only are licenses and inspection of particular ship-

ments necessary, but investigation must also be 
made of costs of production and market prices 
both at home and abroad to prevent getting around 
controls through fictitious prices. Additional re-
quirements are search of foreign asset holdings by 
individuals and banks, study of free or black mar-
kets in our exchange abroad, and prohibiting 
transfers of exchange from legitimate holders to 
those who are denied such facilities. 
Writers have suggested other economic warfare 
possibilities related to currencies. One is the 
printing of high grade counterfeit money to be 
introduced into the enemy's currency circulation 
to break down price controls and spread inflation 
or lack of confidence. Similarly, it may be pos-
sible to drop counterfeit ration books in a highly 
controlled state to break down these regulations. 
It should be noted that the Soviets have already 
demonstrated on occasion their expertness in 
counterfeiting, and potential attack by these 
means is not to be disregarded. 
Preemptive Buying 
Preemptive buying is closely related to block-
ade measures. During World War II, the Allies 
not only bought strategic materials in neutral 
countries for our own war purposes, but also tried 
to buy up those materials of which the enemy had 
a shortage. Such measures were generally very 
effective, but it was also possible for them to stimu-
late production to the point where new problems 
were created. For example, tungsten was sorely 
needed by Germany, so the United States offered 
to buy the total production of neutral Spain. A 
characteristic of many of the extractive industries 
is that production can be expanded when prices 
make the exploitation of submarginal ore deposits 
profitable. Under the stimulus of preemptive 
buying, the digging of Iberian wolframite ex-
panded to the point where we could not buy all 
of it, but at least Germany had to pay high prices 
for the ore she purchased. Even less successful 
were our attempts to buy up all the rabbit skins 
that the Germans used for lining aviation cloth-
ing. Preemptive buying of rabbit skins soon 
showed the superiority of biological multiplica-
tion over economic addition. 
Preemptive buying, however, can be a powerful 
economic warfare weapon. Through its use the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
348 
nations of the West are effectively retaining con-
trol of all uranium ores this side of the Iron Cur-
tain, and the entire output of other types of goods 
has also been preempted by long-term contracts. 
Rationing of Neutrals 
Blockade of the enemy and other control meas-
ures become meaningless if adjacent neutrals are 
able to expand their purchases of strategic ma-
terials on the world market and thus make avail-
able to the enemy either their own former supplies 
or even transship what they buy abroad. The 
steps required to counteract such trade policies 
help to illustrate how meaningless the concepts of 
neutrality in a world war have become. Our eco-
nomic warfare specialists have no choice but to 
make detailed economic studies of imports, pro-
duction, exports, and stockpiling of all essential 
materials in neutral countries. Having deter-
mined the normal needs for imports and the 
amount of stockpiling necessary to meet war con-
ditions, the economic warfare authorities then 
control all neutral trade to keep it within reason-
able limits. If current intelligence shows that we 
underestimated the ability of the neutral to export 
to the enemy, the controls are tightened. The 
controls are applied in the form of export em-
bargoes, ship seizures, and exchange restrictions. 
Strategic Attack 
Strategic attack makes even heavier demands 
upon economic intelligence than does general 
blockade. Blockade merely requires assessment 
of overall economic dependence on trade. Stra-
tegic attack aims to destroy the key facilities in 
the enemy's economic system and thus paralyze 
his war effort on the home front. Successful stra-
tegic attack thus requires economic intelligence 
of the most exact nature to identify what is truly 
strategic in the enemy nation, where the bottle-
necks of production, transport, supply or storage 
are located, and how they are to be attacked. 
Consistent policies of strategic attack can be 
highly decisive in war, although it has not been 
proved that they alone can win wars. The Ger-
mans, for example, managed to keep production 
going under repeated strategic bombings, the im-
mediate result being only temporary curtailment.

bombing is, of course, futile. The psychological 
effects of strategic bombings are a different story, 
which will be told in the following section. 
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE 
This section will consider the conduct of inter-
national relations and the implementation of na-
tional policies through the planned, deliberate 
communication of ideas for the purpose of in-
fluencing the opinions, attitudes, and actions of 
the people to whom the communication is directed. 
Of particular interest are the opportunities which 
may be presented to naval forces and naval com-
manders to utilize the planned communication of 
ideas in naval operations and the contributions 
the intelligence officer can make in the formulation 
of such plans. 
An examination will also be made of the sub-
structure which supports and makes possible the 
use of ideological weapons. The bricks and mor-
tar of this foundation are bodies of knowledge?
intelligence?and many people of diverse skills 
who participate in the intelligence support of 
psychological operations. At the national level, 
the intelligence support for such operations is 
provided by the Central Intelligence Agency, 
which can draw upon the data produced by the 
intelligence organizations of the armed forces. 
National Organization 
On 4 April 1951, the President issued a direc-
tive establishing the Psychological Strategy 
Board (PSB) to serve the National Security 
Council by providing "more effective planning, 
coordination and conduct of psychological opera-
tions within the framework of approved national 
policies." Representatives of the Department of 
State, the Department of Defense, and the Central 
Intelligence Agency were members of that board. 
The Joint Chiefs of Staff provided a Military Ad-
visor. The Board was responsible for the "formu-
lation and promulgation of overall national psy-
chological objectives, policies and programs, for 
the coordination and evaluation of the national 
psychological effort." 
Guidance came from the Psychological Strat-
egy Board through the Department of Defense to 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Joint Subsidiary 
Plans Division (JSPD) of the JCS coordinated 
349 
the activities of the armed forces in this field 
through liaison with the Psychological Warfare 
Divisions of the respective services. The Joint 
Subsidiary Plans Division also provided informa-
tion to other subdivisions of the Joint Staff en-
gaged in strategic planning. 
The National Security Council assigned to the 
Department of State the responsibility for the 
conduct of overt psychological operations during 
time of peace and the initial stages of war. The 
Department of State, furthermore, was directed 
by Congress to set up a program to promote the 
better understanding of the United States among 
the peoples of the world. 
By Executive Order of 3 September 1953 the 
President abolished the Psychological Strategy 
Board and established the Operations Coordi-
nating Board, an interagency group directly re-
sponsible to the National Security Council. The 
purpose of this new board was "to provide for the 
integrated implementation of national security 
policies by the several agencies" of the Federal 
government. An underlying objective was to tie 
together more closely the planning and action 
phases of the nation's grand strategy. Specifically 
exempted from the authority of this board were 
any functions relating to internal security. 
The regular membership of the board included: 
(1) the Undersecretary of State, chairman; (2) 
the Deputy Director of Defense; (3) the Director 
of the Foreign Operations Administration; (4) 
the Director of Central Intelligence; and (5) a 
designated representative of the President. In 
addition, provision was made for official repre-
sentation on the board of any other government 
agency whenever matters directly related to its 
responsibilities were under consideration. 
As a component of military planning, psycho-
logical operations represent a legitimate subject - 
for investigation and consideration by the armed 
services during a time of ostensible peace or "cold 
war." For the Navy, it is not a simple matter to 
determine the extent or geographical location of 
its potential operational responsibilities or the cir-
cumstances under which naval power may be 
brought to bear. The role may be that of chief 
actor, or it may be that of providing logistic sup-
port to another branch of the services or the De-
partment of State, or to an American mission over-

seas, or to allied or neutral governments. What-
ever the circumstances, the Navy must be prepared 
to plan and conduct psychological operations in 
support of both its own military activities and the 
actions of other government agencies. The Office 
of the Chief of Naval Operations, through OP-38, 
the Psychological Warfare Programs Division, 
directs this activity for the Navy. It is the respon-
sibility of the Office of Naval Intelligence to sup-
port such activities by providing suitable intelli-
gence data and other services. 
The Concept and Name 
Military understanding of the concept and find-
ing a suitable name for its military applications 
have evolved rather slowly during the period from 
the start of the First World War to the present 
day. The psychologists, sociologists and allied 
specialists who became interested in the potential-
ities of "psychological warfare," aware as they 
should have been of the proper use of Communi-
cations, did not do a thorough job of communicat-
ing their ideas to the military leaders whose inter-
est they were attempting to arouse. It should have 
been foreseeable that military men, customarily 
educated more intensively in the physical than in 
the social sciences, would display some skepticism 
and uneasiness when called upon to wage war on 
emotions, attitudes, and behaviors rather than on 
physical bodies and material fortifications. Yet 
the very language employed by the theoreticians 
and scholars was enough to discourage many a 
busy soldier. Working vocabularies with such 
terms as "privatization tendencies," "unstructured 
situations" and "audience predispositions," not to 
mention the far more technical vocabularies of 
Freud and Korzibski, were hardly suitable verbal 
symbols to capture the attention of the practition-
ers of "hardware" warfare. Over the course of 
some 30 to 40 years from the World War I period 
to the present time, the process has gone on of 
working out a concept for the mission and func-
tions of "psychological warfare" in relation to the 
traditional forms of military warfare and of de-
termining the general perimeters of this evolving 
implement of national policy. 
Granted that there are ideological or psycho-
logical side-reactions which accompany economic, 
CONFIDENTIAL 
350 
political, and military operations; granted that in 
some situations these may overshadow all other 
reactions in terms of contributing toward the 
achievement of objectives; nevertheless, the gener-
ating of such results is not well-described by the 
term "psychological warfare." This is testified to 
by Hans Speier, who commences his article, 
Psychological Warfare Reconsidered, as follows: 
The term psychological warfare has gained 
wide currency in popular and scientific dis-
cussions, but its meaning is not clear. For 
three reasons the term is debated among those 
who use it freely. 
First, warfare cannot readily be expected 
to be waged in times of peace or, for that 
matter, against the populations of neutral or 
allied countries in wartime, unless it is felt 
that by virtue of being "psychological" this 
kind of warfare is not "real" warfare. Dur-
ing the Second World War, psychological 
warfare was indeed regarded primarily as 
a responsibility of the military who fought 
the enemy, whereas the civilian Office of War 
Information never officially professed before 
the Congress and the public its concern with 
it. Soon a fter the end of the war the rela-
tionship between the Soviet Union and the 
Western powers began to be characterized as 
a state of cold war?incidentally no less am-
biguous a term than "psychological war-
fare"?but while according to many observers 
of the international scene the traditional dis-
tinction bet ween war and peace cannot be ap-
plied in the postwar period, no government 
involved in the cold war has as yet stated that 
it is engaged in psychological warfare against 
other nations. Rather, there is talk of "in-
ternational information," and, reluctantly, 
of propaganda. 
Second, the terms "psychological warfare" 
and "political warfare" (as the British prefer 
to call their activities in this field) are mis-
leading if they designate exclusively propa-
ganda to enemy countries in time of war. 
Wars are waged against enemies in order to 
defeat them; yet during a war, psychological 
warfare comprises not only ancillary activi-
ties to the same end by certain nonlethal 
means but also actions which attempt to reach 
and make f riends in the enemy camp. 
For yet a third reason, the term psychologi-
cal warfare is easily misunderstood. When 
it is used as a synonym for combat propa-
ganda and related activities in wartime, it 
seems to be implied that other forms of war-
fare have no psychological effects; but only 
physical consequences, and are conducted

without regard for the mind of the enemy and 
the moral forces at his command. . . . 
The ambiguities of meaning from which 
the term psychological warfare suffers stems 
(sic) from the lack of a more basic agree-
ment on the nature of war. . . . 
Is there available a more satisfactory title to 
describe this complex of activities, sometimes mili-
tary, sometimes political, sometimes economic, all 
of which have psychological ramifications, which 
will take place in peaceful and warlike contexts, 
and which may be directed toward target groups 
of varying nationalities and living under widely 
differing circumstances? 
The term which not infrequently is employed 
unofficially is "Psychological Operations." This 
name is an improvement in that it avoids creating 
the erroneous impression that psychological activ-
ities are a part only of warfare when they are in 
fact just as necessary in time of peace. However, 
the phrase "Psychological Warfare" continues to 
be used frequently as a general title for all kinds 
of psychological operations. There is evident 
also in some quarters an uneasy and uncertain dis-
satisfaction about perpetuating the word "psycho-
logical." The average American, not being de-
vious by nature, and respecting a tradition of fair 
play, too often has associated psychological activi-
ties with the perverted use to which they have 
been put by totalitarian regimes, not recognizing 
that such instrumentalities also may worthily 
serve in more just causes. However, the word 
"psychological" appears to be too deeply embedded 
in the common, working vocabulary of the modern 
world to be uprooted at this late date. 
Military Applications 
The clarification of the ambiguities of the term 
"psychological warfare" and a definition of the 
place and role of the psychological-ideological 
component of military operations require careful 
consideration of the diversity of responsibilities 
imposed upon the military organization of modern 
nations. 
Harold D. Lasswell's article, Political and Psy-
chological Warfare, is helpful in the search for 
clarification. A portion of it is quoted below 
(italics are his) :

OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES CONFIDENTIAL 
The most distinctive act of Psychological 
Warfare is this: it uses the means of mass 
communication in order to destroy the enemy's 
will to fight. 
Mass communication, it should be stressed, 
is not exclusively a matter of the word, spoken 
or printed, or picture. It uses other media 
also, such as physical acts and material de-
vices. This is notably true of assassination. 
While the act of killing cannot be considered 
a conventional method of communication, yet 
it has been used often to affect political atti-
tudes. The act of assassination was expected 
to have an impact upon the intention of the 
enemy to fight that would be far out of pro-
portion to the physical damage done to his 
capacity, or to the physical capacity made use 
of in the killing. We are looking at the con-
duct of war in the perspective of psychology 
when we are seeking to widen the gap between 
the physical destruction of capabilities on 
both sides and the magnitude of the impact 
upon the enemy's intention to resist 
As concerns the military, here is evidence that 
"psychological warfare" is not something apart, 
competing with traditional warfare. It is but 
another perspective for viewing the conduct of 
familiar military operations, another factor which 
must be considered when planning future cam-
paigns, and on occasion another type of operation 
to be undertaken for principally psychological 
ends. 
The factor to be considered is "psychological 
suitability," which becomes a subject for investi-
gation by the military commander and his staff as 
part of their estimate of the situation. It will in-
clude study and analysis of what psychological-
ideological results are desired in fulfilling their 
current mission, through what kind of operations 
the forces of the command can achieve these re-
sults, and finally, what kind of operations or 
actions should be avoided because of their possible 
adverse effects. 
Psychological result g may be produced by the 
employment of conventional military weapons as 
well as by propaganda leaflets and tactical loud-
speaker teams. The screaming, divebombing 
Stukas, supporting the Nazi ground forces in their 
breakthrough of the Maginot Line, were as much 
a weapon for achieving the psychological results 
of terror and panic as they were for killing Allied 
soldiers. The commander and his staff are directly 
concerned with psychological results that will

support specific operations at a particular time 
and place. The support rendered may be through 
demoralization of enemy troops; it may be through 
encouragement of and instructions to about-to-be-
liberated friendly civilian populations; it may be 
through the creation of appropriate expectations 
or reactions among neutral groups who come in 
contact with our military operations and our per-
sonnel. Whether the means used are psychological 
or conventional, if properly selected they are capa-
ble of providing cooperating support for any mili-
tary operation. Neutralizing the enemy or de-
stroying his will to fight through psychological 
pressures are results no different from those to be 
achieved through the application of nonpsycho-
logical force. Here then is merely another family 
of weapons stored and awaiting selection by the 
field commander who needs only to become accus-
tomed to drawing on the psychological instru-
ments at his command as readily and confidently 
as he selects his operating "hardware." 
In scope Psychological Operations encompass 
alike conditions of peaceful cooperation among 
nations, of uneasy tension, and of outright war; 
in influence they may extend to friends and allies, 
to neutrals, and to hostile target groups. More 
specifically, within each of the foregoing groups, 
appeals may be directed to individual leaders or to 
various religious, economic, social, or political sub-
groups that in one way or another are significant 
in the life of the target society. The modus oper-
andi is the use of every medium of communication 
which produces psychological results through the 
employment of visual symbols, through the writ-
ten and the spoken word, and through conduct 
and actions. 
The results sought to be achieved may be con-
sidered in terms of effects upon the mental states 
of the targets. States of mind which it is desired 
to produce may range from that in which the 
target feels reassured, comforted or encouraged to 
the other extreme in which the target feels per-
suaded or compelled to take specific, immediate 
action along lines desired and predetermined by 
the communicator. 
Strategic Bombing in Psychological Operations 
It was mentioned in the previous discussion of 
economic warfare that strategic bombing may be 
CONFIDENTIAL

NAVAL OFFICERS 
a more important psychological weapon than a 
means of the physical destruction of enemy econ-
omy. Destruction of morale has an immediate 
effect upon will to resist and will to work, hence 
it directly affects civilian production. The United 
States Strategic Bombing Survey studies the ef-
fects of strategic bombing on German and Japa-
nese morale. The following are excerpts from the 
German study: 
Strategic bombing was the major means by 
which the Allies were able to strike a direct 
blow at the morale of German civilians. Al-
most one-third of the Germans were subjected 
to it and all lived in the shadow of its threat. 
One-half of one percent were killed by bomb-
ing and one percent injured. One-fifth of all 
civilians were deprived of water, gas, or 
electricity, many of them for long periods. 
One of every 15 civilians was evacuated to 
another area. Every German, whether or not 
he experienced these direct effects of bombing, 
suffered such indirect results as shortages of 
food and supplies, and the disruption of 
transportation. There was no German civil-
ian who did not experience hardship or suf-
fering as a result of bombino. . . . 
A major factor in the final breakdown of 
German civilian morale was strategic bomb-
ing. . . . Morale was not an easy target to 
knock out. It was never completely destroyed 
by strategic bombing, although its structure 
was seriously damaged. But during the 
closing months of the war, the cumulative 
effects of strategic bombin,or definitely began to 
outweigh the powerful Nazi forces which 
above all else had held the German people to 
the war-industry grindstone during the two 
preceding years. Poor morale did ultimately 
break out into widespread popular behavior 
imperiling. the German war effort. But the 
actual outbreak was the result of several mo-
mentous and coinciding Gentian catastrophes, 
the approaching loss of the war, the loss of 
German lands to the enemy, the cumulative 
devastation and disruption of the German 
home front by bombing, the military, politi-
cal, and economic chaos which prevailed in the 
wake of disastrous setbacks. It was in this 
combination of circumstances that strategic 
bombing was able to achieve its maximum 
morale effect. 
The general deterioration of morale due to 
bombings of Germany made itself evident in var-
ious ways. There was increasing war weariness, 
and skepticism of Germany's ultimate victory.

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF SPECIAL AUTIVIII.Lb ana'AvvrinDENTIAL 
The Survey reports that "by the beginning of 1941 
three-fourths of all Germans regarded the war 
as lost." Civilians in bombed areas lost confi-
dence in their leaders, and because of their loss of 
homes and property thought that they were bear-
ing the brunt of personal sacrifice. There was a 
strong fear and shock reaction produced by the 
bombings, which made people nervously upset by 
subsequent lesser alarms. The survey also dis-
covered that the government was held responsible 
for the bombings and blamed for the failure to 
provide adequate defense. Resentments were di-
rected against the Nazi regime more than against 
the Allies. Disruption of public utilities and es-
pecially of local transportation services had an 
important effect in depressing the German people. 
A widespread evacuation program had to be un-
dertaken, and it in itself produced dissatisfaction 
and confusion. Industrial productivity was di-
minished somewhat, although the organized sys-
tem of controls was fairly successful in keeping 
the traditionally obedient and industrious workers 
at a routine level of performance. Apathy, how-
ever, was widespread. 
In Japan many of the same reactions to the 
bombings were reported. The Survey for Japan 
reported: 
The importance of the air attacks in de-
pressing morale is indicated by the fact that 
Japanese said they were: 
The most important single factor in caus-
ing them to have doubts of victory. 
The most important single factor in caus-
ing them to feel certain of defeat. 
The most important single factor in mak-
ing them unwilling to continue the war. 
Their greatest worry during the war, and 
the thing which made most of them happy 
that the war was over. . . . 
The primary emotional response to the 
bombings was fright and terror. Many peo-
ple abandoned their "battle stations" as fire 
fighters and fled to shelters when the raids 
overwhelmed defenses. 
Night bombing was feared more than day-
light bombing, and high explosives were 
feared more than incendiaries . . . 
Air attacks were cited as an important 
reason for absenteeism and lowered morale, 
but the chief effect of bombing appears to 
have been on the capacity of the people to 
work. The workers would still go to work or 
could still be forced to go, but they could

neither be utilized nor driven to produce as 
in previous years. 
The Japanese tactics in the South Pacific fur-
nish an interesting illustration of warfare psycho-
logically waged. Infantry and air strafing attacks 
were made against American troops, planned and 
timed to disrupt normal eating and sleeping hours. 
As Prof. James N. Mosel of George Washington 
University has pointed out in analyzing these in-
cidents, the prolonged disruption of basic habits, 
particularly habits associated with the satisfac-
tion of fundamental drives and wants, can cause 
severe frustration and anxiety and can even lead 
to neurosis. It was reported that at times it be-
came impossible for American troops to maintain 
routine in even the most trivial activities. The 
same psychologist has called attention also to the 
fact that such a situation, if sufficiently pro-
tracted, can generate emotional instability, in-
creased excitability, break down the unity of the 
group, and sensitize individuals to a variety of 
irrational fears and negative attitudes. Such dis-
turbances as digestive disorders, heightened blood 
pressure, muscular tremors, and bodily aches and 
pains may follow from such stimuli. 
Political Warfare 
Political warfare has been developed to its 
greatest extent in the totalitarian countries rather 
than in the democracies, for it violates much of 
what constitutes democratic morality and political 
conscience. 
Prof. Mosel makes some illuminating comments 
on its methods and techniques: 
A basic technique of political warfare as 
used by the Germans and Russians is to create 
ambiguity and confusion. One way of doing 
this is to assume a line of action which has 
multiple interpretations?one which points 
in several directions and suggests a number of 
different motives. Thus the enemy country 
is "kept guessing". Propaganda warfare is 
frequently used to accelerate the desired 
effects. 
This technique requires no overt consist-
ency; its object is to mislead and complicate. 
The enemy country which is attempting to 
interpret these actions becomes anxious and 
disturbed by their inability to understand 
what they see. Many different interpretations

spring up, bringing bickering and internal 
dissension which, in turn, adds further anxi-
ety and confusion. 
In their vain attempts to extract some ra-
tional meaning from the opposing country's 
actions, the observing country's leaders and 
experts develop one plan or policy after an-
other, each proving unsuccessful. The cleav-
ages occurring among the leaders themselves 
are then further amplified by the population's 
loss of confidence in its leaders' ability to deal 
with the situation. 
This technique requires a thorough analysis 
of what constitutes "ambiguity' from the 
viewpoint of the enemy country, and a com-
prehensive understanding of that country's 
current political problems, its role in the bal-
ance of power, its international objectives and 
the circumstances which it considers as threats 
to its national well-being. 
When the general populace has been suffi-
ciently undermined in its internal cohesion, 
the enemy country can then step in and climax 
its program with hard-hitting propaganda 
warfare. The psychological factors operative 
at this juncture are subtle but powerful. It 
is a psychological fact when confronted with 
an ambiguous, contradictory situation, we ex-
perience a strong need for meaningful clarifi-
cation. The clarification that is accepted is 
in general one that (1) is presented first, (2) 
when the need for clarification is strongest, 
and (3) which is most satisfying. By utiliz-
ing these principles, the enemy country can  
inject at just the right moment a carefully 
designed interpretation" which will gain ac-
ceptance. Needless to say, this maneuver re-
quires accurate assessment of the situation, 
careful timing, comprehensive political in-
telligence, and psychological knowledge of 
the country's national character structure (its 
symbols, loyalties, hopes, fears, personality 
traits, etc.). 
To investigate in detail how the Communists 
carry on political warfare, utilizing ideas, words, 
symbols and communication media, would require 
an extensive examination of the overall method of 
conduct of the international relations of the Com-
munist Party and the Soviet government. Such 
an investigation would make it clear that the psy-
chological pressures and reactions produced 
through political maneuvers are but one of the 
interacting weapons of warfare as waged in the 
Communist style. The effects attributed to this 
type of weapon cannot be isolated, but they can 
be studied in the context of any given campaign 
CONFIDENTIAL 354 
A 
of the Communist-instigated war against the non-
Communist wo rld. 
Communist political warfare is accompanied by 
a campaign of propaganda worldwide which is of 
great magnitude. It has been reported that the 
Soviet Union spent close to one billion dollars on 
various forms of propaganda during 1950, with 
another half billion dollars spent by Communist 
satellite states. 
The Soviets' principal themes for external con-
sumption have been those that depict the Soviet 
Union as the chief proponent of world peace and 
the United States as the chief aggressive and war-
like nation threatening such peace, and the "Hate 
America" campaign conducted within the Soviet 
Union. The vehicle for the former theme has 
been principally the Stockholm peace appeal, the 
Communist-sponsored, phoney but rather success-
ful attempt to convince the peoples of many coun-
tries that the source of belligerency in the world 
was the United States. The "Hate America" 
campaign has been carried on in the postwar 
period in the Soviet Union with an intensity and 
continuity that is beyond the comprehension of 
United States citizens. Emphasis has been placed 
on phoney charges that the United States engaged 
in bacteriological warfare in Korea and North 
China and treated prisoners of war with excessive 
cruelty. 
American correspondents in Moscow have re-
ported that, as a result, the Soviet citizen believes 
Americans to be people without principle, bar-
barous and hostilely aggressive. The feeling 
against the United States is reputed to be one of 
indignation, resentment, and anger. 
INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL 
OPERATIONS 
In his book Sykewar, describing and analyzing 
PW activities in World War II, Daniel Lerner 
aptly illustrated the responsibility of intelligence 
in psychological operations as follows: 
Although (our highest-level policies) made 
few overt references to intelligence, they 
rested clearly on certain intelligence assump-
tions concerning the audiences to which they 
were directed. The policy of Unconditional 
Surrender, for example, made sense only on 
the assumption that the enemy forces could 
and would surrender in the face of certain

INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES CONFIDENTIAL 
defeat. That such an assumption involved 
an important intelligence estimate (even if 
the estimate was never clarified on a more 
explicit level than "intuition"), will be better 
understood if one recalls the enormous pub-
licity in America during the first year of the 
war, given to the view that Japanese soldiers 
never surrender. . . . 
If the view that German soldiers would not 
surrender had been taken literally, a policy 
of Unconditional Surrender could have led to 
nothing short of the extermination of every 
last member of the Wehrmacht. This was 
clearly not the intention of the Allied high 
command, whose evaluation of available 
information on surrender led to the conclu-
sion that the German armies would surren-
der. . . . 
Similarly the announcement of peace aims 
such as the Four Freedoms and the Atlantic 
Charter was based on the intelligence assump-
tion that their contents correspond to 
the desires of the peoples of the Allied na-
tions. . . . 
This need for accurate intelligence re-
mained constant. Broad estimates of Ger-
man attitudes served a useful purpose in 
framing high policies, but a continuous and 
detailed flow of accurate information, prop-
erly evaluated, was required to keep these 
high policies applicable to the dozens of deci-
sions which Sykewar had to make from day 
to day. 
Having recognized that there is a requirement 
for the intelligence support of psychological oper-
ations, it is necessary to consider the nature of the 
supporting activity. The problem may be ap-
proached by way of a comparison between the 
intelligence work produced in normal military 
operations and that required for conducting psy-
chological operations. 
Earlier portions of this book have shown that 
the end product of intelligence collection and 
processing is frequently an intelligence estimate, 
report, study or annex to a military directive. 
The essence of the intelligence estimate is an ap-
praisal of enemy capabilities and their relative 
order of probable adoption, formulated so as to 
assist the military commander in reaching a sound 
decision for the employment of forces. In psy-
chological operations, however, military concern 
is to influence target attitudes and to control target 
behaviour, usually through means short of the use 
of overwhelming physical strength. That is, in 
355 
psychological operations it is vulnerabilities rather 
than capabilities that are of principal military 
interest. 
Current textual material prepared by the Psy-
chological Warfare School of the Army discusses 
this concern with vulnerabilities: 
Use of the term "enemy vulnerabilities" in 
military intelligence for combat operations 
ordinarily is related to the physical weak-
nesses which make the enemy susceptible to 
injury or defeat. Such vulnerabilities in-
clude lack of defensive terrain, shortages of 
important materials and equipment, transpor-
tation bottlenecks, and concentration of de-
fense industries in overcrowded places which 
can be bombed or isolated. 
In psychological warfare intelligence the 
term enemy vulnerabilities" is related to so-
ciological and psychological matters rather 
than to physical weaknesses. Vulnerabilities 
from the psychological warfare point of view 
are situations or conditions which can be ex-
ploited by the propagandist. 
Sociological vulnerabilities, for example, 
may grow out of conflicts of interest between 
racial, religious, social, economic and politi-
cal groups. They may result from the condi-
tions in which people find themselves and be 
manifest in dissatisfaction with government 
policies, social conditions, or economic condi-
tions or relationships. 
Psychological vulnerabilities, on the other 
hand, are attitudes, aspirations and person-
ality traits which when manifested in par-
ticular situations and circumstances indicate 
susceptibility to propaganda persuasion. 
Although vulnerabilities are the matter of pri-
mary concern with respect to hostile target groups, 
their identification is not the sole requirement of 
the users of psychological warfare intelligence. 
The scope of psychological operations has been 
broadly defined to encompass neutral, allied, liber-
ated, and analogous nonhostile audiences and to 
include conditions of peace and uneasy peace as 
well as conditions of war. Intelligence estimates 
on such target groups seek to present conclusions 
that will inform the operating agency how to gain 
an openminded and receptive audience, how to 
stimulate and encourage it, and how to create in 
it sentiments of agreement, sympathy, and under-
standing. 
In these cases, the estimate must supply answers 
to such questions as: How can this policy of the

United States be best explained to this audience? 
How can this obliqueness or apparent inconsist-
ency in United States' actions be presented in the 
least unfavorable light? What values does Amer-
ican life have in common with this foreign society? 
How can a particular point of contact between 
Americans and a foreign group be directed so as 
to create mutual good will and cooperation? 
Lerner's illustration, above, of the Four Freedoms 
and the Atlantic Charter is a case in point when 
considering such varied nonhostile audiences. 
To produce conclusions of the kind discussed 
above and to present them in a psychological war-
fare intelligence estimate, report, or study is a 
task easily recognized as one similar to that per-
formed in the preparation of other intelligence 
estimates. The subject matters may differ, but 
the basic estimative process?proceeding from a 
mission stated or a problem identified for solution, 
through an analysis of factual elements, to con-
clusions that will be meaningful and useful to 
operations agencies?is analogous to the process 
illustrated in chapter 12. 
A World War II illustration of a military use 
of psych-warfare intelligence is to be found in the 
case of the "Commander Norden" broadcasts to 
German submariners, a program directed by the 
United States Navy Department. "Commander 
Norden" was an intelligence officer in ONI, who 
possessed both fluency in the German language 
and comprehension of the German character. He 
had available such reliable information about cur-
rent U-boat operations, conditions inside Ger-
many, and even personal news of the families of 
some U-boat personnel that his broadcasts became 
very popular with U-boat crews. A byproduct of 
his psychological warfare operation developed in 
connection with general intelligence collection: 
"Commander Norden" became so well known and 
accepted by German submariners that captured 
personnel on more than one occasion declared that 
they would speak only to him about their experi-
ences, for they believed that he could understand 
better than anyone else what they had undergone 
during their war patrols. 
Peacetime Support 
A peacetime naval operation in which psych-
war intelligence can render service is that involv-
CONFIDENTIAL 
ing the visit of United States Navy ships to foreign 
ports. Here is an occasion calling for the paying 
of mutual respects between governments and be-
tween navies. The opportunity may arise for 
naval commanders to establish personal relation-
ships with their opposite numbers and to cultivate 
good will between professional equals. Here, too, 
is an opportunity for creating favorable impres 
sions of "the Americans" as a result of orderly, 
friendly, and informed conduct and manners of 
naval personnel visiting ashore. 
On the other hand, there is also a substantial 
possibility that inadequately informed Americans 
representing their naval service may create ill will 
and generate unpopularity. Visitors abroad who 
are not sensitive, understanding, and respectful 
of the customs a:ad the ways of life, as well as the 
hopes, fears and daily problems of a foreign soci-
ety, may through their ignorance make poor rep-
resentatives of their country. To foreign eyes the 
conduct of such visitors typifies "America," its 
manner of life and its pattern of societl behavior. 
In carrying out the general purposes of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, military 
missions representing the United States and its 
armed services are located in many countries 
throughout the world. In Europe, particularly, 
plans exist for the expenditure of large sums to 
build and maintain military facilities as part of 
the defense of that continent. Thousands of 
Americans in the armed services are living abroad, 
many with their dependents who too are represent-
atives of the United States, in close daily contact 
with many other nationalities participating in the 
work of NATO. How well these Americans ad-
just themselves to their physical and cultural sur-
roundings is a factor of considerable influence in 
the obtaining and retaining of national allies. 
Illustrative of this complex of problems in day-
-to-day living is the following report in The New 
York Times describing relationships between 
American military personnel and the native popu-
lation at logistic bases in France: 
Meanwhile, the presence of some 12,000 to 
15,000 soldiers and airmen in sixteen camps 
scattered through the Bordeaux and La-
Rochelle areas produces a daily crop of minor 
irritations and misunderstandings, based 
principally on differences of language, eco-
nomic status and social custom.

are high prices demanded by French land-
lords for housing that is judged to be totally 
inadequate by United States standards, the 
failure of the French to manifest the same 
sense of urgency about the defense task that 
the Americans feel, annoyance with tech-
niques and procedures that Americans find 
archaic, and the infinite number of ways in 
which the social, cultural and hygienic pat-
terns of Bordeaux, LaRochelle and Angouleme 
vary from those of New York, Minneapolis 
and Dallas. 
To many Americans and many Frenchmen, 
a difference from their own standards is a 
defect. 
In a situation such as the foregoing there is 
manifest the necessity for a continued information 
and education program to explain foreign sur-
roundings and foreign peoples to our own mili-
tary personnel, a program which is a companion 
piece to the psychological operation of explaining 
the American visitors to their native hosts. Both 
of these programs can be founded only on the 
material provided in intelligence studies that 
examine and analyze the characteristics of various 
foreign societies and that identify in particular 
those aspects of the foreign way of life that are 
peculiarly sensitive to the native of that culture. 
Psychological operations are coordinated at the 
level of the theater command. At this echelon it 
is possible to plan and carry out a psychological 
campaign coordinated to support military opera-
tions within the theater and one in which the 
themes and appeals employed are consistent 
throughout the entire area of operations. Pro-
viding intelligence support at this level of com-
mand imposes a diversity of requirements, many 
of which already have been illustrated. It is 
likely that the theater of operations will include 
several countries and target groups that are both 
hostile and friendly, whose patterns of life may be 
those of fishermen, farmers, villagers, city labor-
ers, and displaced war refugees. 
A commander whose theater includes maritime 
areas may encounter further specialized psycho-
logical operations problems which intelligence 
must help resolve. For example, if he is required 
CONFIDENTIAL 
to perform military government functions, he may 
become involved in the control of several maritime 
activities. It may be that the local fishing indus-
try should be re-equipped and restored to produc-
tion as promptly as possible to relieve food short-
ages in the occupation area and to provide employ-
ment for local residents. Fishing vessels and their 
crews provide a potential medium of external com-
munication and so could represent a possible threat 
to military security and a channel for saboteurs 
and hostile agents. On the other hand, they may 
be able to give valuable support to our own mari-
time control measures and be capable of combat-
ting hostile resistance and obtaining useful opera-
tional information. Intelligence may ease the task 
of reconstruction and control by informing mili-
tary government officials of the ways in which 
local cooperation can be obtained most effectively. 
What is true of the fishing industry is equally true 
in other situations in which naval commanders 
may be required to control, reorganize, and direct 
indigenous affairs in ways best calculated to obtain 
local cooperation. For instance, either under or 
apart from military government, naval personnel 
may become engaged in the rehabilitation of for-
eign ports so that they may be made available for 
logistic support of further military operations. 
Other situations in which the naval commander 
may find a need for intelligence about one or an-
other foreign area in the world may be visualized 
as a result of the Navy's characteristic capability 
of providing mobile logistic support to many kinds 
of operations in areas distant from fixed bases. 
Naval forces may expect to play a role in emer-
gency evacuations of civilians and military per-
sonnel from danger areas, and the rescue and 
transportation of displaced persons or escapees 
from enemy areas.

Collection and Processing 
The collection and the processing of information 
for psychological operations are the two activities 
of the Intelligence Cycle that best reveal the actual 
nature of the work. A partial description of these 
two activities has already been presented in fore-
going discussions and illustrations. The chief 
subject for investigation is man in his social set-
ting, a topic of concern to a number of branches 
of learning, particularly the fields of psychology,

sociology, and cultural anthropology, but also to 
political science, economics, history, biology, and 
psychiatry. In the field of psychological opera-
tions the dependence of the military upon the 
academic is particularly evident, for psychological 
warfare still belongs as much to the scholar as to 
the professional soldier. 
This dependence upon academic support is no-
where better illustrated than in the collection ef-
fort which is carried on in two distinct milieus, 
along two mutually-supporting but independent 
lines. One of these is basic research, the realm of 
the academician; the other may be called current 
psychological intelligence, the realm of the field 
observer and collector. Both functions are in 
reality specific illustrations of the fundamental 
collection process, first obtaining a mass of basic 
data and evaluating it through scholarly research, 
and thereafter augmenting it by specific pertinent 
items currently collected in. the field. 
In the collection effort, no component of intelli-
gence knowledge, geographical, political, sociolog-
ical, economic, military, scientific, or biographical 
can be ignored, for man, individually and collec-
tively, may be influenced by any one of them. 
What is distinctive about intelligence for psycho-
logical operations is the particular point of view 
it maintains while performing its collection and 
processing tasks. The all-inclusive essential ele-
ment of information is: What use can be made of 
specific facts of geography, economic, religion, or 
social customs in suggesting ways of affecting the 
opinions, attitudes, and actions of those groups of 
people whom it is desired to influence? 
The following quotation from Ellsworth Hunt-
ington's book, Mainsprings of Civilization, illus-
trates the interdependence of the various compo-
nents of intelligence knowledge as they explain the 
mode of life of man in the totality of his environ-
ment. 
The seclusion of women in Moslem countries 
furnishes a good illustration of the way in 
which climate cooperates with other condi-
tions in encouraging social customs which in 
due time become religious practices. The se-
clusion of women arises from the same human 
impulse as the private ownership of property. 
The possessor of something valuable wants to 
keep it for his own benefit. So far as women 
are concerned, this desire is more or less effec-
tive in most parts of the world, but rarely, if 
CONFIDENTIAL 
358 
ever, is it more highly specialized than in the 
harems of the Arabs, the zenana of the Hin-
dus. The seclusion of women is most fully 
developed in the deserts and semi-arid regions 
from northwestern India across Persia, 
Iraq, Arabia, and Syria to Egypt and 
Morocco. . . . 
The seclusion of women seems to have de-
veloped most fully in the oases of Arabia 
where it is appropriate to the geographical 
environment. So long as man is a mere hunter 
and gatherer of wild products, he cannot se-
clude his women, for the women must wander 
around searching for edible roots and grubs. 
Among pastoral nomads a similar situation 
prevails. . . . 
Only after agriculture was instituted did 
the effectiv seclusion of women become feas-
ible, but not in warm, moist countries with 
plenty of rain. There the normal material 
for huts is rough, crooked branches with a 
thatch of leaves or grass. It is difficult to 
make such huts so tight that people cannot 
peer in, and it is uncomfortable to cook or do 
other work inside them in hot, damp weather. 
Then, too, from time immemorial, the acre of 
the weedy crops around tropical dwellings 
has been woman's work. . . . 
In a desert oases the situation is different. 
The most available building material is dry 
mud (adobe). Large, sun-dried bricks can 
easily be piled up to form walls. In the hot, 
dry air, the most comfortable place during the 
heat of the day is inside a thick-walled adobe 
house with a stout roof of the same material. 
Hence the women prefer to stay indoors many 
hours of the day. In such oases, agriculture 
can be carried on only by irrigation. An ir-
rigated patch affords much temptation to 
thieves. Inasmuch as adobe walls can be 
built easily and last a long time, the common 
practice is to surround each "garden" with a 
thick wall seven or eight feet high. Thus, in 
the cooler parts of the day, when the women 
work outside the house, they are still sheltered 
from passers-by. . . . 
A veil over the face is little hardship in such 
a climate. Both sexes crave heavy clothing in 
the heat of noon and again in the sudden cool-
ness after sunset. . . . In the hot deserts then, 
such as those of the lower Indus Valley, 
Arabia, and the Sahara, the oases offer physi-
cal conditions which play directly into the 
hands of the jealous male who wants to seclude 
his women from other men. . . . 
Another factor may enter the picture. The 
men of the hot desert may have unusual cause 
for jealousy. In extremely hot weather peo-
ple's ability to resist emotional impulses, in-

eluding those of sex, appears to be weakened. 
Sexual extravagance and prostitution seem to 
reach a maximum in the hottest parts of the 
world, that is, the dry parts of a belt located 
ten to thirty degrees from the equator. 
Animists, who usually live in moist, forested 
regions which do not have such extreme heat 
as the monsoon regions and deserts, appear to 
be sexually less excitable than Hindus, Arabs 
and other Moslems. . . . 
Now let us see what happened when Islam, 
in its great wave of conquest, imposed its cus-
toms on conquered nations. If the conquered 
countries were so dry and warm that irriga-
tion and mud-walled houses and gardens were 
normal, the seclusion of women could readily 
be introduced and would do relatively little 
harm to health . . . As (Islam) spread east-
ward in the Indo-Gangetic Valley the custom 
became less and less appropriate to the climate 
and hence more and more harmful. The In-
dian province of Bengal, near the mouth of 
the Ganges, was conquered by Islam more 
than seven hundred years ago. It now con-
tains about thirty million Moslems. . . . 
From May to September . . . the tempera-
ture averages from 82? to 86? . . . the air is 
constantly humid . . . Under such condi-
tions, even though one perspires freely most 
of the time one is not thereby cooled because 
there is such great humidity. A stay in the 
stagnant air indoors is a kind of martyrdom 
but the outdoor air is not much better; there 
are no mud walls for shelter, and a cotton 
sheet that swathes the head and covers the 
face is most uncomfortable. Nevertheless, 
the Moslem women, especially those of the 
upper classes, are counted as grossly irreli-
gious if they fail to keep themselves well cov-
ered, face and all. Thus, by being converted 
into a religious requirement and then being 
transported to a new physical environment, 
a relatively harmless social custom has be-
come a great detriment to health as well as 
comfort. . . . 
'What are some of the principal lines of investi-
gation in basic intelligence research for psycho-
logical operations, and how are investigations in 
these areas undertaken by the armed services of 
the United States? Such studies are carried on by 
analysts, civilian and uniformed, in the research 
and intelligence agencies of the respective armed 
services, and also by private educational institu-
tions and civilian scholars whose research is spe-
cifically sponsored and financed through contracts 
with one or another of the armed services. 
Research 
For the Navy, the Office of Naval Research 
through its Psychological Sciences Division, and 
in particular through the Human Relations 
Branch of that division, is the contracting agency 
that sponsors private researchers. The Army con-
ducts research through the medium of two agen-
cies, Human Resources Research Office and Oper-
ations Research Office, each of which is under the 
supervision of a leading American university. 
The Air Force has organized a Human Relations 
Research Institute as a part of the Air University 
at Maxwell Field, Ala. The Air Force also uses 
the Rand Corp., whose research activities have 
been described previously in this volume. 
The specific subjects for potential investigation 
within such general fields as anthropology,. psy-
chology, sociology, history, economics, political 
science, psychiatry, and biology are, of course, 
practically without number. Some of the areas 
for study which have self-evident relationships to 
ultimate military applications are described below. 
The most pressing task of basic research is to pro-
vide data on those peoples and societies whose na-
tional strategies are a threat to the United States 
and to a peaceful and stable world order. How-
ever, in view of the Communist tactic of foment-
ing economic, social and political unrest in what-
ever part of the world it may be latent, it is neces-
sary as a second priority to study almost every 
national society having a potential role in the con-
flict between the free and slave worlds. 
Typical examples of research on the U. S. S. R. 
and its leaders are two publications of the Rand 
Corp. entitled The Operational Code of the Polit-
buro and The Organizational Weapon: A Study of 
Bolshevik Strategy and Tactics. A series of 
studies on other aspects of Soviet life have been 
undertaken by the Russian Research Center estab-
lished at Harvard University in 1949 with the aid 
of a grant from the Carnegie Corporation. The 
first of these, Public Opinion in Soviet Russia, by 
Alex Inkeles has as its purpose: 
. . . to explain how Soviet mass communi-
cation works, and why it has the particular 
characteristics it possesses. But it is by no 
means intended primarily as a technical dis-
cussion of the Soviet press, radio and film. 
' On the contrary, I hope that this work will

promote a more adequate evaluation of the 
implications of the Soviet system. Since ex-
posure to a steady flow of propaganda and 
agitation is a major facet of the daily life of 
every Soviet citizen, no assessment of his life 
situation can be complete if it does not take 
account of that fact. Furthermore, Soviet 
philosophy and practice in the realm of public 
opinion are important indexes to the nature of 
the regime. 
Other publications of the Research Center include 
Justice in Russia: An Interpretation of Soviet 
Law by Harold J. Berman and Soviet Ideology 
and Power Politics: A Study of the Role of Ideas 
in Social Change by Barrington Moore, Jr. 
Independent scholars have likewise made some 
important contributions. In the field of eco-
nomics, Solomon M. Schwartz in Labor in the 
Soviet Union describes the workingman in the 
U. S. S. R. not as docile and enslaved, but still 
struggling to be free. The evidence is provided 
by reports of dissatisfaction and individual con-
flict filtering from behind the Iron Curtain, a vul-
nerability of interest to planners of psychological 
operations. 
Thus research contributes to knowledge of the 
nature of man, how he is motivated, how he exists 
in his particular culture, and what the character-
istics are of that culture: its folkways and insti-
tutions, its system of rewards and punishments, 
its capability or its brittle inflexibility toward self-
adjustment when externally stimulated. These 
are the avenues along which research proceeds 
always seeking to provide fundamental data in 
answer to the questions Operations asks of Intel-
ligence: How can we cause this particular society 
to run like an improperly adjusted engine, to over-
strain, to slow down, to fly apart, or alternatively 
to gain new strength, further hope, fresh deter-
mination and a revived will to achieve? 
Further Collection and Processing 
The second major subdivision of collection and 
processing may be labeled "Current." It consists 
of adding fresh individual items to basic knowl-
edge concerning target societies. Its activity is 
typified by the work of collectors in the field such 
as naval attaches, and information obtained from 
travelers, defectors, and prisoner of war interro-
gators. All of these must be made aware of poten-
tial sources of information of value to psycho-
CONFIDENTIAL 
logical operations. Collection may proceed also 
through the media of technological devices, such 
as aerial cameras and radio monitoring equipment, 
or through the application of scientific knowledge 
and techniques of analysis, as in the case of the 
examination of captured equipment and material. 
Any of these instrumentalities may provide fur-
ther insight into one or another aspect of the 
conditions of life within a target society. _ 
One particular task of processing deserves spe-
cial mention: the necessity for translating the data 
comiDiled by basic research into terminology and 
specific conclusions (hypotheses) that will assist 
concrete operational planning. A military com-
mander will not appreciate being handed a schol-
arly text and being told by his intelligence officer: 
"Sir, here is all the information we need about 
the oppressive economic conditions in Lower Slo-
bovia." The argument and analysis of the profes-
sional researcher must be reduced to terms that 
suit the immediate requirements of the profes-
sional soldier. 
In processing information for potential use in 
psychological operations, it is essential constantly 
to keep in mind the possible specific operational 
applications of the data under analysis. An article 
entitled Effective Propaganda: Conditions and 
Evaluation, which appears in a volume, Propa-
ganda in War and Crisis, edited by Daniel Lerner, 
sets forth the "conditions of effective propaganda" 
that may help to synthesize research and orient it 
and the researcher himself to operational appli-
cations: 
The manipulation of expectations is an in-
strument with powerful uses, but also with 
definite limits. The uses will be better served 
if the limits are clearly understood. The 
fundamental limitation is inherent in the in-
strument: its strategy is persuasion and its 
vehicle is symbols. Propaganda does not 
change conditions but only beliefs about con-
ditions; it cannot force people to change 
their beliefs but can only persuade them to 
do so. 
Under what conditions are people most 
likely to be persuaded by Symbols to modify 
their expectations of the future, and conse-
quently their behaviour in the present? . . . 
Several main points are clear, however, from 
recent experience. We may summarize these 
lessons by stating four essential conditions of 
effective propaganda: 
360

Approved For Release 2003/12/09 : CIA-RDP85G00105R00010021000 
INTELLIGENCE IN SUPPORT OF SPECIAL ACTIVITIES uoNFIDENTIAL 
(1) The attention of the audience must be 
secured. 
(2) The credence of the audience must be 
secured. 
(3) The predispositions of the audience 
must include the modifications sought 
by propaganda as plausible alterna-
tives to present expectations. 
(4) The environment of the audience must 
permit the course of action prescribed 
by the modified structure of expecta-
tions. 
These conditions seem obvious upon state-
ment. To persuade a man to do what you 
tell him, you must first get him to listen to 
you. Once you have his attention, you must 
get him to believe what you say if he is to 
take your message seriously. His credence 
gained, what you tell him to believe must be 
within the realm of his existing predisposi-
tional structure of expectations and aspira-
tions. It is a waste of words to try to 
persuade a loyal citizen that he would rather 
see his nation lose a war than win it; no such 
alternative preference is possible within his 
predispositional set. But it may be quite pos-
sible to persuade the same man, once you have 
gained his attention and credence, to believe 
that the nation is going to lose a war. . . . 
A fourth condition of effective propaganda 
is that the actions required of the audience 
by their modified expectations should be feasi-
ble in the environing circumstances which de-
fine for them the limits of meaningful 
behaviour. It would make no sense, for ex-
ample, to call on Soviet citizens in Vladivos-
tok . . . to assassinate Stalin or imprison the 
Politburo. . . . Indeed, the impracticability 
of such action might lead to the utter rejec-
tion of our statements, otherwise plausible, 
because they impose obligations impossible to 
fulfill. 
The extent and emphasis of processing will de-
pend, of course, on the subject matter. For ex-
ample, the analysis of enemy radio propaganda is 
valuable intelligence, for it provides data on the 
particular themes that the enemy desires to em-
phasize to particular audiences at specific periods 
of time. This is sometimes labelled "content anal-
ysis" or "propanal" (propaganda analysis) which 
was used with some success in World War II to 
predict future enemy military operations. Such 
a processing task differs greatly from that of "pre-
testing" possible propaganda themes by trying 
them out on a cooperative group of enemy prison-
361 
ers of war in order to determine thematic effec-
tiveness and authenticity. 
Another specialized collection and processing 
task is to obtain and evaluate data for evidence of 
the effectiveness of previous and current psycho-
logical operations. This is a correctional func-
tion, a validation test, carried out so that future 
undertakings may benefit from past experience. 
It may consist of conducting a public opinion poll 
in a friendly foreign country for the purpose of 
ascertaining listener reactions to the programs of 
the Voice of America. 
In addition to theme-analysis, another variety 
of processing must be carried out for the purpose 
of determining what words, expressions and sym-
bols will most forcefully drive the message home 
to a given target group. Lerner, in Sykewar, 
illustrates this point: 
For example, an effective linguistic device 
for Sykewar was the use of the enemy's own 
words and phrases, within a context supplied 
by one's own propagandists. This was par-
ticularly useful on the radio, where it gave 
some Germans the feeling that their enemy 
was omniscient. . . . There is evidence that 
some Germans were amused, bewildered, and 
sometimes even frightened by the rapidity 
with which Allied radio retold anti-Nazi jokes 
as they became current in some part of Ger-
many. For this sort of operation, Sykewar 
required intelligence reports that Rhineland 
Germans had taken to calling Nazi party func-
tionaries goldene F asanen (in addition to the 
older term Bonzen) ; or that in Berlin, Goeb-
bels was commonly known as Jappch,en; or 
that, on a more serious level, the pervasive 
counterargument that Germans were develop-
ing against Allied charges of German guilt 
was expressed in the phrase that they had been 
belogen und betrogen. 
Intelligence, as an aid to Sykewar opera-
tions . . . brought in both the German sto-
ries and the very words in which they were 
told. The value which output personnel put 
upon this type of intelligence is indicated by 
David Hertz, who was in charge of radio 
Sykewar against the besieged German garri-
son at Lorient: "Our existence as a function-
ing tactical weapon depended on intelligence 
from prisoners. We ate, slept, and drank 
with prisoners. Many nights I was awak-
ened by members of our crew dragging in 
deserters, who sat on my bedroll, dropping the 
waters of the river Scorff as they told us the

latest Winchell dope on what went on inside 
the fortress." 
The collection and processing of information 
useful for psychological operations are not, how-
ever, limited to intelligence specialists and schol-
ars. In present-day circumstances, where such a 
variety of potential uses for psychological activi-
ties exists, possible vulnerabilities may be no trade 
secret of intelligence analysts, but rather may be 
susceptible of identification by any perceptive 
reader of the daily newspapers and current peri-
odicals or by any observer of international affairs. 
What can be read and observed comprises the 
raw material that is grist for the mill of current 
psych-warfare intelligence. An awareness of the 
wealth of raw material that can be gathered by 
the nonspecialist is perhaps as cogent a reason as 
CONFIDENTIAL 
362 
could be cited for naval officers without extensive 
specialized training in this area to become and 
remain sensitive to potential exploitable oppor-
tunities in the realm of psychological operations. 
It is important that those whose travels, duty 
assignments, or other contacts afford opportuni-
ties to observe foreign social orders in operation 
be constantly alert to observe and report on situ-
ations and events that may be capitalized on by 
planners of psychological operations. It has 
proved unsatisfactory in practice to attempt to 
specify to a new naval attache, for example, just 
exactly what to look for to aid psychological oper-
ations. It has proved far more suitable to explain 
to him what it is and what its requirements are--
which is precisely what this discussion has 
attempted to do.

CHAPTER 15 
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
From the definitions of chapter 1, it was learned 
that counterintelligence, just as intelligence, is 
knowledge, organization, and activity, but that 
these elements are applied to the specific mission 
of opposing the enemy's intelligence effort, both 
defensively and offensively. Counterintelligence 
contributes to and draws from the whole body of 
intelligence knowledge. Its organizations are not 
only a part of Intelligence, but often are one ahd 
the same. Its activities can be identified with the 
steps of the intelligence cycle. It is equally im-
portant in peace and war. The differences are 
in purposes, points of view, methods and tech-
nique. To be a good counterintelligence officer 
one first must be a good intelligence officer. 
Because of the diversity and covert aspects of 
counterintelligence activities, and because these 
activities are not restricted to the intelligence or-
ganizations of the armed services but are asso-
ciated with all agencies which contribute to na-
tional security, centralization of control is essen-
tial to effective counterintelligence operations. 
Nowhere is this requirement more evident than in 
time of war when our own counterintelligence 
efforts in widely separated parts of the world must 
be coordinated with those of our allies. For ex-
ample, during World War II, Naval Intelligence 
received information from a naval source in South 
America that an individual in Europe, about to 
embark on a Spanish ship for Argentina, was an 
important German espionage agent. Although 
given a low evaluation, this information was 
promptly relayed to British Intelligence whose 
agents removed the suspect from the ship at Gi-
braltar and determined that he was in fact en-
trusted with a highly important mission by the 
Germans. 
The Armed Forces Staff College manual, Coun-
terintelligenee?Theater of Operations and Joint 
Overseas Operation, makes this pertinent comment 
on the need for coordinated control: 
There is no significant difference in the mis-
sion of counterintelligence in the ground, 
363 
naval, and air forces and all Services share in 
the responsibility of carrying out this mission 
by both active and passive measures. How-
ever, the relative number of personnel devoted 
to counterintelligence is greater in the ground 
force than in the other two because of the bet-
ter opportunity afforded the enemy to pene-
trate our counterintelligence screen by con-
stant contact of opposing ground forces and 
the presence of indigenous or dis-Aaced pop-
ulations in the combat or occupiej areas . . . 
Counterintelligence means available to all 
forces are extensive, and to secure their effec-
tive employment requires close coordination 
by theater headquarters. 
During World War II, the Army Counter Intelli-
gence Corps had a major responsibility for coun-
terintelligence in overseas theaters. While the 
Navy's counterintelligence efforts were more con-
centrated within the domestic theater, its interests 
were equally, and of necessity, worldwide. Prac-
tically speaking, counterintelligence interests can-
not be arbitrarily separated according to areas, 
because foreign intelligence organizations usually 
operate on a broad front without regard to areas 
of special cognizance; hence, all counterintelli-
gence agencies must be concerned with the totality 
of counterintelligence knowledge. 
In the successful achievement of its mission, 
counterintelligence has three objectives: first, to 
locate and identify the aggressive efforts of hostile 
intelligence organizations; second, to deny correct 
information or access to vital areas to an actual or 
potential enemy; and third, to deceive and mislead 
him. This chapter will discuss the nature of hos-
tile intelligence activities, measures and tech-
niques to counter them, and organizations most 
directly concerned. The subject is difficult to dis-
cuss because of its sensitive nature and the com-
plexities of the areas of human behaviour with 
which it is concerned. Post-World War II devel-
opments have magnified the responsibilities of 
counterintelligence and have led to new problems 
in their interpretation. 
Before proceeding to a discussion of counter-

helpful to consider first the need for counterintel-
ligence and the nature of the organizations and 
activities which must be countered. 
THE NEED FOR COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
The current compelling need for counterintelli-
gence was created by the purposes and methods 
of the Soviet Union in the years following World 
War II. This need was accentuated by the oper-
ations of the Soviet Intelligence System, reviewed 
in an earlier chapter, as well as by the tremendous 
growth of organized intelligence activity all over 
the world. 
Attempts to calculate the size of current world 
intelligence operations in terms of personnel and 
expenditures are, of course, speculative. However, 
as of 1949, the United Nations World estimated 
that the United States, Great Britain, and the 
U. S. S. R. were employing approximately 24,000 
operatives, while smaller nations were utilizing 
another 15,000-20,000. The estimated total cost 
annually was set at $248,000,000. No attempt was 
made to estimate the additional part-time person-
nel, whose total number might be astounding. In 
the same year, an estimate prepared for Great 
Britain's Ministry of Defense indicated a world 
total of intelligence operatives in excess of 250,000, 
actual or potential. By contrast, in 1938, a year 
of particular tension, the total number was esti-
mated at no more than 12,000, of whom about 5,500 
were employed by Nazi Germany. Irrespective of 
accurate figures, it may be assumed that the extent 
of intelligence activities in the world today is 
greater than ever before. One indication of this 
possibility is the increased number of operatives 
who have been apprehended since World War II 
in widely separated areas of the world. 
The challenge to all counterintelligence organi-
zations comes not only from the dimensions of this 
world-wide intelligence activity, but even more 
from changes in methods. The case of the British 
scientist, Klaus Fuchs, for example, can scarcely 
be viewed as an isolated example. When placed 
in context and related to personalities and events 
in Canada and the United States, it indicates a 
dangerous trend toward the use of citizens to work 
against their own country. As a result foreign 
intelligence activity has become related to treach-
ery and interwoven with political propaganda. 
CONFIDENTIAL

Whereas, in the past, speech accent and physical 
characteristics might have provided leads for 
counterintelligence operatives, at present the only 
clues may be the expression of thoughts and ideas. 
Nor can counteri:ntelligence problems be easily iso-
lated to relatively few areas or nations. Active 
Soviet confederates are to be found in practically 
every country of the the world; the world oppo-
nent of the United States, therefore, is two-headed, 
consisting not only of the U. S. S. R. but also of 
the militant organization of world communism. 
As a consequence, counterintelligence is confronted 
with a task involving unfriendly, neutral, and 
friendly nations of all continents of the world. 
The very nature of the cold war, with concepts 
and methods so alien to those Of other wars in mod-
ern times, poses new problems for military and 
political leaders, the solutions of which become 
in turn new problems for counterintelligence. For 
example, the voluntary prisoner repatriation issue 
in the drawn-out truce negotiations of the Korean 
War brought new tensions to the United Nations 
Organization arid to relationships of the United 
States with other nations, including Great Britain 
and India. Riots and bloodshed in prisoner com-
pounds on Koje Island were made a subject of 
vicious Communist propaganda directed against 
the United States. In January 1953 evidence pro-
duced by the United Nations Headquarters of 
Gen. Mark Clark in Tokyo indicated that the 
communist delegates conducting the truce negotia-
tions had simultaneously planned and organized 
these riots, through a "guidance bureau" which 
had trained special units for camp riots and su-
pervised their infiltration into prison compounds. 
Here was a new task for counterintelligence with 
widespread political and military implications. 
Principal among the hostile foreign intelligence 
activities to be countered, which may or may not 
stem directly from foreign intelligence organiza-
tions, are espionage, sabotage, and subversion. An 
understanding of each is necessary to fully appre-
ciate counterintelligence measures. 
ESPIONAGE 
In earlier times, the term "espionage," or "spy-
ing," was practically synonymous with the word 
"intelligence." In modern usage, it is broadly 
defined as the activity of spying on others, the

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
employment of spies or covert agents, or the sys-
tematic secret collection of information regarding 
potential or actual enemies or potential or actual 
theaters of military operations, including terrain 
and weather. Its purpose is to gather in advance 
such complete and detailed data, normally pro-
tected from exposure by a nation, as will assist in 
planning for defense or attack, or by which influ-
ence, power, or control over other nations can be 
gained. No item or fact is too fragmentary or 
unimportant for collection and reporting. 
Generally speaking, the two types of espionage 
methods are designation, and saturation. Numer-
ous examples of both types are presented in chap-
ter 2: The Soviet spy system organized to gain in-
formation about the atomic bomb is illustrative of 
the first, while the mass utilization of Japanese 
citizens abroad prior to World War II is an exam-
ple of the second. Espionage by designation re-
fers to the assignment of particular agents, many 
of whom are carefully trained, to specific targets 
or to the collection of certain highly significant 
"missing" items of information. Such agents 
usually seek to gain access to key individuals in 
governmental, military, or business affairs and to 
develop a network of exclusive informers. Es-
pionage by saturation is a large-scale operation by 
many hundreds of individuals few if any of whom 
are trained for their assignments. It is a buck-
shot method of hitting a target, involving the col-
lection of volumes of information much of which 
may be neither pertinent nor useful. Quality of 
personnel and material is sacrificed for quantity on 
the assumption that a careful processing of the 
results will produce much that is usable and im-
portant to the total intelligence effort. 
The popular conception of espionage activity is 
that it is exciting and glamorous, with a back-
ground of luxury hotels, exotic foreign capitals, 
beautiful women, and hot pursuits in fast, sleek 
cars. There are, of course, moments of excitement, 
but it has been said by confessed agents that the 
time of greatest emotional excitement and stimu-
lation for the spy comes when he is caught. Ac-
tually, the life of an espionage agent is often quite 
dull and commonplace, for just as the sailor in a 
ship, he experiences long periods of tedious routine 
and monotonous waiting, relieved only occasion-
ally by danger and suspense. Work hours may be 
365 
long and tiring and not as filled with hairbreadth 
escapes and quick journeys as in fictional accounts. 
The typical agent is inconspicuous and impos-
sible to identify from appearances because he may 
be recruited from any social group, upper, middle, 
or lower classes. Espionage agents come from all 
walks of life, with different habits, varying char-
acteristics and capabilities, and individual pat-
terns of behavior. Indeed, on occasion, some 
rather ineffective people have been employed as 
agents in order to conceal the activities of those 
more capable and expert. Age, physical and 
mental characteristics, and social or economic 
status are no criterion for identification. An 
agent will often be a native of the country, in 
which he is to work or will have lived there for a 
long period of time; the most dangerous is the 
ordinary citizen who, for one reason or another, 
has decided to release important classified infor-
mation to an enemy. 
While no identifying characteristics of the in-
dividual agent can be pointed out, there are four 
general classifications based on mode of operation 
and assigned mission: diplomatic, fixed, special, 
and roving. 
Depending upon the particular country, diplo-
matic agents may be consuls, diplomats, military 
and naval attaches, observers, members of special 
missions, or other quasi-official representatives, 
any of whom may aid or direct espionage activi-
ties. As has already been indicated, the practice 
of individual nations varies considerably in the 
use of their diplomatic personnel for such pur-
poses, although the governments of Russia have 
been notorious in so doing. 
The fixed agent often poses the greatest threat 
to a nation's security because he is assigned to a 
given area on a more or less permanent basis. His 
objective is to become an established, respected citi-
zen of his community, of unquestioned loyalty 
and reputation, and with a profitable business or 
comfortably retired. His "cover" may be that of 
a doctor, storekeeper, farmer, or retired business-
man?preferably any occupation which will per-
mit the greatest possible activity at the least risk. 
Because of the importance of this type of agent, 
he may reside in a locality for years without re-
ceiving any assignments or being contacted by any 
of his superiors. His objectives may be the in-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
filtration of military installations, close associa-
tion with military personnel for the purpose of 
gleaning information, or the covert observation of 
military establishments and activities. He may 
have responsibilities for establishing, training, 
and directing networks or cells of agents in his 
area or acting as a point for transmittal of infor-
mation, or "letter drop," for other agents. 
The special agent is handpicked to obtain spe-
cific information because he is well-versed and 
highly trained in a particular field or in the pro-
cedure by which the information is to be gained. 
Usually the special agent has been thoroughly in-
doctrinated at an espionage school so that he is 
prepared to assume any disguise, to enter a coun-
try legally or illegally, and to carry out his work 
for as long as necessary with plausible reasons 
and legitimate proof to back them up. Officially 
denied, these agents sometimes work under the 
supervision of diplomatic or fixed agents or di-
rectly under the instructions of the intelligence 
service by which they are employed. In addition 
to collecting specific information they may serve 
as special organizers, inspectors, supervisors, or 
couriers. 
As his designation implies, the roving agent is 
not confined to a particular area, but may cover 
many, collecting general information in various 
categories or specific information in one. His 
problem, of course, is to have a credible reason 
for extensive travel. In the course of his work 
he may conduct personal observation and investi-
gation of intelligence targets, penetrate installa-
tions for short periods, and make brief contacts 
with other agents. Related to this class are part-
time agents or informers, usually employed for a 
particular mission because they have or can obtain 
information of special value. Once committed to 
such work, and hence subject to blackmail, they 
are usually available for further employment as 
required and necessary. 
The motives which impel men and women to 
enter espionage service are many and varied, from 
fear, greed, or love of adventure to idealism or 
patriotism, particularly if the individual is im-
bued with love of a country or a cause. Often a 
combination of reasons provides the motivation, 
although money is one of the more common. The 
ideological motive usually produces the most 
CONFIDENTIAL 
faithful and reliable agents from among the intel-
lectual and professional groups who are stimu-
lated by the vision of a new world order. Some 
may not actually realize the implications of their 
position as enemy agents or, if they do have an 
uneasy conscience about their activities, may ra-
tionalize them as consistent with an inevitable 
course of events. These sympathizers provide an 
excellent means of penetration into government 
agencies and are most difficult to discover because 
their records are good, they have no obvious con-
nections with intelligence organizations, and are 
often subjected to open attack by front organiza-
tions. Financial rewards are of little consequence 
to the ideologically inspired. 
Many of the best agents are members of the 
military, naval, or diplomatic services who are 
professionally motivated and trained to carry out 
their assigned missions in a most competent man-
ner. The desire to be on the winning side strongly 
motivates certain potential agents. They must 
be particularly watched during periods when an 
enemy has won the temporary advantage. Pres-
tige and love of adventure also have a strong ap-
peal, particularly for young people. Illusory 
though they may be, these motives have proved 
influential, as for example, among members of the 
Hitler Youth Organizations during World War 
II. In enemy-occupied areas some individuals 
under pressure will become intelligence agents to 
avoid other forms of service, such as in labor 
camps, or those involving transfer to foreign 
areas. An overwhelming urge to return home 
may make a person a willing "line-crosser." Un-
der pressure, however, they often will abandon 
their mission or volunteer the information they 
have gathered. Criminals may become agents as 
an alternative to imprisonment; apprehended 
agents may be spared on condition that they work 
for an enemy. The latter become "double-
agents," working for both sides. Dr. Richard 
Sorge, whose case was mentioned in chapter 2, is 
a good example of the double-agent. 
During World War II, many of the German 
agents who came to the United States were moti-
vated by both greed and fear, especially fear of 
reprisal against their families left behind in 
Europe. In the case of Soviet agents, patriotism 
has seldom been a factor since many nationalities

have often been involved in the same network. 
In his book, Handbook for Spies, Alexander Foote 
has given an interesting fictional account of his 
recruitment as a Soviet spy during World War II. 
He suggests that the motivation of spies is often 
difficult to determine and that, in his own case, 
he was for some time unaware of the objectives 
and general purposes of the organization he 
served. 
The native attributes of any individual selected 
for full-time work in espionage most certainly in-
clude common sense, good judgment, the ability 
to size up a situation correctly, and adaptability 
in learning and using necessary arts and sciences. 
Personal courage, alertness, and complete self-
control are also essential. Bravery in company is 
one thing, but bravery alone is another matter, 
especially when the threat to exposure is constant. 
Mental and emotional stability, physical vigor, 
and stamina are prime requirements. Intoxi-
cants must be used with great discretion, and 
romance has often been fatal. Therefore, it must 
be assumed that nations employing covert agents 
apply the most exacting standards in their selec-
tion. 
Mental, emotional, and physical qualifications 
are only the foundation for the most intensive 
training which must develop others more special-
ized, such as knowledge of foreign languages and 
skills in microphotography and means of commu-
nications including wireless telegraphy, and secret 
inks. The curriculum of the Leningrad Espionage 
School as reported by the International News 
Service from Athens, Greece, in April 1952 is in-
dicative of the range of subject matter. During 
the course, which lasts for about 1 year, students 
are instructed in chemistry (atomic science) , 
mechanics, drawing and sketching, fortifications 
and geography, sources of raw material and indus-
trial output, and details of industrial production 
in the United States, Canada, and South America. 
Political studies cover the history of communism 
abroad as well as in the U. S. S. R., and students 
must become proficient in either English or Span-
ish. Other subjects studied are the organization 
of foreign armies and their weapons, topography, 
photography, radio operating, and deciphering. 
Each individual must learn how to conduct him-
self if captured, in prison or during trial, and he 
must know how to plan an escape and return to 
the U. S. S. R. either through legal, diplomatic 
channels or illegal routes, making use of false 
passports and disguises. Finally, instruction is 
given in the transmission of secret messages and 
the use of agitators and dissident groups. All 
students at the Leningrad School are, of course, 
politically reliable. In addition to Russians and 
satellite nationals, some foreigners are accepted 
as students, although fictitious names are the rule 
and correct identity is concealed. 
It must not be assumed that such a curriculum 
is necessarily exhaustive of the possibilities. 
Others might include safe-cracking, counterfeit-
ing, and a detailed study of the local customs, man-
nerisms, and peculiarities of the particular area 
to which the agent is to be assigned. The perfec-
tion of cover stories, concealment of all identify-
ing clues, evasion of surveillance, and clever altera-
tions in identity all have a place in specialized 
training. Regardless of the specific subject matter, 
most espionage organizations have their own train-
ing schools which usually have instruction in the 
following five areas : Types of information sought, 
techniques for obtaining it, selection and perfec-
tion of a cover, means of transmission of informa-
tion, and methods of entering the target area. 
Means of gaining access to a general area are, 
of course, varied and depend upon the circum-
stances. During wartime, typical means include 
line-crossing, sea-coast landing, parachuting, and 
remaining behind as the enemy withdraws. 
Orientation within an area may be difficult because 
the agent often lands at some distance from his 
intended destination and must avoid carrying 
maps or inquiring directions. Other problems 
may include obtaining proper identification papers 
and documents. Obviously, the names and ad-
dresses of the agent's contacts will be memorized 
and he will carry only such papers as are cus-
tomary for his particular cover. 
The large-scale movement of immigrants, ref-
ugees, and displaced persons since World War II 
has provided agents with an excellent means of 
entry into their target areas. Simulating the piti-
ful circumstances of refugees escaping from per-
secution, they have been able to reach their desti-
nations in sizable numbers with marked success. 
For example, it has been reported in the public

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
press that Americans with friends or relatives in 
Communist-dominated countries have become vic-
tims of blackmail and forced to sponsor the entry 
into the United States of trained agents posing as 
refugees from Communist oppression. Lists of 
such potential sponsors have sometimes been com-
piled from parcels sent through the mails. Ex-
change students also provide excellent cover for 
espionage activities, as do businessmen, merchant 
seamen, and tourists who have legitimate reasons 
for entering a country. 
Once within a target area the agent must adopt 
some disguise or "cover" which is suitable and 
logical to justify his presence. The cover adopted 
is normally an activity in which the agent is pro-
ficient through previous employment; engaging in 
unfamiliar work will more readily lead to even-
tual discovery. The cover of a servant is a good 
one for both men and women, especially those with 
traces of foreign extraction. Maids, cooks, butlers, 
and chauffeurs become intimates of households, 
and can logically obtain information in a variety 
of situations. For example, an agent posing as a 
chauffeur installed a recording device in the auto-
mobile of a high government official, and thus 
obtained valuable information for a number of 
years. 
Hotel employees often have served as contacts 
between agents and as letterdrops. Bellhops, desk 
clerks, and maids can easily overhear conversa-
tions and, in wartime, have gathered vital infor-
mation from military personnel. The transient 
nature of such work and the minimum qualifica-
tions are of considerable advantage. The enter-
tainment profession provides a highly desirable 
cover because it is international in nature and 
brings together widely varied groups, the size and 
diversity depending, of course, upon the popular-
ity of the individual entertainer. Frequent travel 
lends legitimacy to wartime movement into many 
areas, including military installations. The travel 
factor combined with the ability to make friends 
quickly and easily in the right circles, makes this 
cover particularly effective. 
Trades and industry have also been used for 
cover purposes, especially importers and publish-
ers whose business involves foreign transactions 
in peacetime and the maintenance of connections 
with neutral countries in time of war. Communi-
CONFIDENTIAL 
cations workers, contractors, and engineers are 
good covers for obtaining vital military and eco-
nomic information. Diplomatic cover, of course, 
has the added advantage of security through diplo-
matic immunity. The agent cannot be arrested 
but only requested to leave the country; hence some 
diplomatic missions have been established only for 
intelligence purposes. It is apparent that the 
types of cover are many and varied; those men-
tioned only indicate the tremendous range of possi-
bilities. 
Techniques 
The techniques of espionage are almost as di-
verse as the types of cover; the particular one 
selected will depend upon the area involved, the 
information desired, and the degree of difficulty 
anticipated or encountered. Some of the more 
common can be listed, although it must be empha-
sized that there are many other possibilities; they 
are often used in combination, and are not the 
exclusive province of the espionage agent. Pene-
tration, the physical entry of an agent by normal 
procedures into an organization or installation for 
an indefinite period, is an ideal method for per-
sonal observation and reporting. Targets for this 
technique are industrial plants, military installa-
tions, laboratories, newspapers, radio stations, 
government statistical and intelligence agencies, 
political parties, labor unions, and any other 
agency or organization which may be concerned 
with information of intelligence value. Military 
services and government offices are particularly 
important targets and agents may enlist or start 
work in the lower echelons, gradually rising to 
positions where classified information becomes 
available. Direct observation, without actual 
penetration, is usually a more hazardous and less 
profitable technique, for it depends entirely upon 
the available means of cover, especially if cameras 
and binoculars are required. 
EmploYment agencies, language schools, and 
training schools are sometimes organized specifi-
cally to facilitate penetration. Fire inspection 
surveys by agents supposedly representating in-
surance companies, or actually operating out of 
such companies, have been a good approach. 
Bribery, theft, and purchase of documents, plans, 
and information have taken advantage of men's

weakness in every generation. The development 
of friendships with individuals possessing impor-
tant data, and their subsequent subtle interroga-
tion making full use of flattery and conviviality 
have been effective. Where this method has 
failed, and under certain circumstances, outright 
abduction of specialists and important personages 
has been practiced, especially by the Soviet Union 
in modern times. Search of the personal effects 
of those believed to have vital information is some-
times facilitated by employees who have ready 
access to such effects. 
Reproduction by copying or photographing 
models or documents which are only temporarily 
available can be secretly accomplished so that no 
suspicion is aroused. The actual appropriation 
of materials, where such are desired, is often aided 
by clerks, janitors, and other regular employees, 
either knowingly or unwittingly. The adroit use 
of informers is a common espionage technique. 
Many intelligence services maintain lists of such 
persons in every country for appropriate use by 
agents. 
Although the first major task of the espionage 
agent is to collect information, the second, that of 
transmitting it to his superiors, is of equal im-
portance, for only when they have received it is 
the process of espionage complete. For this 
reason, successful methods of communication are 
vital and advance preparations for them are given 
the most careful attention. In modern times, the 
predominant method is the use of concealed radio 
transmitters and receivers of suitable size and 
power. In addition to range, other factors for 
consideration include source of power, operational 
wave length, antenna length, and atmospheric con-
ditions. During World War II a number of ex-
cellent radio sets for espionage use were developed, 
especially by the Germans, some of which were 
about the size of a shoebox. More recent electronic 
developments have reduced the size even more and 
made the problem of concealment easier. The 
necessity for an adequate antenna creates special 
problems in the location of a transmitting set, 
so that night is the usual time for operations. 
Since height is a factor, preferable transmission 
sites are hilltops or high buildings except when 
communications are directed toward aircraft in 
the vicinity. The advantages of radio for trans-
369 
mission are speed and comparative reliability; 
some of its disadvantages are the equipment re-
quired, training in its use, and the risk of dis-
covery. Anyone with a receiver covering the 
proper wave length can receive the transmitted 
signal, and the agent never knows when his ac-
tivity has been detected by radio security units. 
As a result, his transmissions must be brief and 
infrequent and his location must be changed often 
or subject to change on the shortest notice. 
In spite of the risks of interception, public mail 
service is often used to transmit information. 
During peacetime, the risks in many countries are 
reduced and mail is sent direct to commercial or 
private addresses used as covers; in wartime, cover 
addresses will be located in neutral countries. 
Under either condition, letters, newspapers or 
periodicals, ships' mail, and microphotographs 
may be the means for utilizing mail service, and 
such means may employ codes or secret inks or 
both. The potentialities of microphotography are 
particularly amazing, since a sheet of paper may 
be photographed and reduced in size to a pin-
point of gelatin which may be hidden in the 
gummed sections of an envelope or used as a punc-
tuation mark in a letter. 
There are many other methods for transmitting 
information for intelligence purposes, including 
couriers, pigeons and dogs, heliographs, light sig-
nals, infrared rays, supersonic waves, clearing-
houses in neutral countries, secret letterdrops, 
persons, even children acting as fronts, and coded 
messages ingeniously placed to be visible to the 
intended recipient. Because of the possibilities of 
interception, couriers are seldom used except when 
the transmittal of maps, objects, and photographs 
becomes vital; the diplomatic courier has the ob-
vious advantage of customary freedom from search 
or censorship. Pigeons and dogs have been em-
ployed for centuries, although the risk of inter-
ception is great and the amount of material which 
can be transmitted is limited. Infrared-ray equip-
ment has special advantages and scientific develop-
ments in the field of secret communications con-
tinue to provide other devices of high potential 
value. 
While the activities and techniques of espionage 
have a range which almost defies the imagination, 
it should be recognized that they are the cumula-

tive result of brilliant, if sometimes almost per-
verse, imaginative genius that knows no limits. 
No possibility, therefore, can be brushed aside as 
too impractical or improbable. Even more, mod-
ern espionage is a comprehensive, skillfully organ-
ized business with a major objective of collecting 
all possible information about planning, policy, 
and military secrets. Published reports by such 
prominent and informed persons as the Director 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation suggest 
that this activity in the United States is organized 
on a scale incomprehensible to the average Amer-
ican citizen, more pervasive than ever before, and 
potentially more dangerous. Literally thousands 
of people, many of whom are American citizens, 
are reported to be associated with espionage, at-
tempting to transmit to the Soviet Union informa-
tion which might aid that country in the cold war 
or in open conflict. The possibility exists that 
such persons may be located in government agen-
cies, labor unions, key industries, and scientific 
organizations. The realities of espionage in the 
United States should be seriously regarded. 
SABOTAGE 
For the purposes of discussion, the subjects of 
espionage and sabotage will be considered sepa-
rately, but it should be kept in mind that their 
activities are often interrelated, the personnel may 
be one and the same, and methods may be comple-
mentary if not identical. Espionage is damage to 
national security by the acquisition of vital infor-
mational items; sabotage is damage by injury or 
destruction of important physical items. The 
word "sabotage" originated in the industrial revo-
lution of the 19th century when hand weavers of 
northern France and the Low Countries fearing 
loss of their jobs, often kicked their sabots into 
the new textile weaving machines in an effort to 
destroy them. In modern usage, sabotage is more 
broadly defined as "the malicious disruption or 
attempted disruption of the normal functions of a 
nation in any manner which intends or apparently 
intends to injure, interfere with, or obstruct the 
national defense or war potential of that nation." 
The term is sometimes applied to certain activities 
of a secretive nature, such as some aspects of 
psychological and economic warfare and projects 
CONFIDENTIAL 370 
of subversive political groups which do not result 
in obvious physical damage. 
Three general purposes of sabotage are to 
weaken the war potential or war effort of a nation, 
to impair its internal strength and external influ-
ence, and to dislocate its economic system. Dam-
age to a nation's productive industrial facilities 
can directly affect its fighting capabilities on dis-
tant fronts, while sabotage in the area of opera-
tions can cause a breakdown in lines of commu-
nications and prevent a commander from accom-
plishing his mission. Internal weakening of a 
nation may disrupt its economic and political 
structure so that it not only cannot meet its inter-
national commitments but also may be faced with 
social strife leading to revolutionary activities. 
The complexities, interrelationships, and concen-
tration of modern industrial plants magnify the 
potential effectiveness of sabotage, for the de-
struction of a few vital machines and damage to 
a few vulnerable plants can, like a chain reaction, 
immobilize thousands of others. 
Sabotage need not be direct damage or destruc-
tion: it may be much more subtle, such as the 
undetected substitution of destination tags on 
shipments of important supplies. Nor can it be 
assumed that every act or attempted act of sabo-
tage is the result of the directed effort of an em-
ployee of a foreign service. Sabotage may be 
closely related to international developments, but 
it may also coincide with domestic labor disputes 
or extreme dissension among industrial personnel. 
Acts of violence and destruction can and have been 
traced to malicious and dissatisfied individuals 
who have no other motive than revenge or jeal-
ousy. In any event, it may be assumed that sabo-
tage will be directed against points of greatest 
vulnerability. 
Types of Saboteurs 
The German Nazis, the Italian Fascists, and the 
Russian Communists have all advanced the doc-
trine that service to the state justifies any act 
which will aid its cause, with the result that injury 
and destruction of property evokes no personal 
sense of wrongdoing. The two basic types of 
saboteurs are the trained agent operating under 
the instructions of a foreign intelligence service, 
and the independent, usually untrained, malcon-

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
tent acting for personal reasons with no foreign 
connections. 
According to the time element of their assign-
mems, saboteurs may also be typed as long-range 
and short-range agents. The long-range agent, 
who usually enters a country at some time prior 
to an outbreak of hostilities, is similar to the fixed 
espionage agent, while the short-range saboteur 
ordinarily operates during wartime within an 
area of military operations. The means of entry 
into a country or a particular installation em-
ployed by a saboteur are similar to those used by 
espionage agents. To be remembered is the fact 
that anyone can be a saboteur, of any age, from 
any social group, or ar y profession or occupation. 
While the activities the trained saboteur may 
conform to a pattern, those of the independent 
saboteur seldom do. This latter type may be un-
expectedly motivated by diverse causes: he may 
commit sabotage in an effort to embarrass or dis-
credit a fellowworker, and by blaming his act on 
another seek to gain personal recognition, ad-
vancement, or reward. 
Methods and Targets of Sabotage 
The method employed by a saboteur will de-
pend upon the nature and construction of the as-
signed target, its vulnerability, security measures 
in force in the area, the effect desired, the time 
available, and the material necessary to cause the 
planned damage. While the range of possible 
methods is great, some are more commonly used 
because of their simplicity and convenience and 
may be divided into four groups: incendiary, ex-
plosive, mechanical, and biological. The common 
characteristic of each is damage or destruction to 
life or property, except in the case of the latter 
which may have more indirect results. These 
methods may have a primary phase, which involves 
the actual act, such as arson or bombing, and a sec-
ondary phase, consisting of acts which increase the 
effectiveness of the primary, such as disconnecting 
fire alarms and immobilizing fire-fighting equip-
mer it. 
One of the most effective methods of sabotage is 
the use of fire because of complete destruction, 
concealment of evidence, and availability of means. 
Taking advantage of ordinary fire hazards, such as 
371 
CONFIDENTIAL 
the improper stowage of combustibles or faulty 
electric wiring, the saboteur can achieve his objec-
tive with a minimum risk of detection and a, maxi-
mum degree of disguise. For example, during 
World War II, a German sabotage group in Great 
Britain, directed by an electrical engineer, made 
use of apparent accidents to damage various elec-
trical installations. The close relationship be-
tween arson and sabotage, which differ only in 
objectives, often make it unnecessary for the sabo-
teur to camouflage his incendiarism. 
Rapid spread and complete destruction is most 
accurately achieved when the saboteur personally 
ignites combustible materials, known as acceler-
ants. Should he require time for escape or a bet-
ter alibi, he may make use of a variety of delay 
mechanisms which are either improvised or manu-
factured. These mechanisms are usually chemi-
cal, electrical, or mechanical. A very simple de-
vice is a lighted cigarette and a match folder 
which provides a delay of about 15 to 18 minutes. 
Typical chemical mechanisms include pencil-like 
incendiaries and sabotage bombs which have as 
their components a delay device, an initiator, and a 
main charge. Electrical and mechanical mecha-
nisms are frequently used in combination with 
chemicals and adapt for their purposes ordinary 
alarm clocks, mouse traps, doorbells, and tele-
phones. 
The use of explosives poses a number of prob-
lems and requirements: storage, introduction into 
the target area, technical skill in preparation, the 
difficulties of making the explosion seem acci-
dental, and the possibilities of public indignation 
resulting in intensive investigation and increased 
security measures. However, explosives become 
an acceptable method under certain circumstances: 
when the target is such that a cutting or shattering 
force is necessary for its destruction, when destruc-
tion must be immediate and total, and when no 
other method will accomplish the objective. Ex-
plosives are particularly effective in destroying 
cast iron forgings, reinforced concrete and stone 
structures. 
Usual explosive devices are bombs which may or 
may not be disguised. If disguised or concealed 
they may be set to explode at a predetermined time 
or so arranged as to explode by means of a trigger 
device activated by movement. The common ex-

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
plosive materials used include black powder, 
smokeless powder, nitroglycerin, and TNT. 
Mechanical sabotage is by far the easiest method 
to employ as well as one of the most difficult to 
detect. Its most logical targets are industry and 
transport, although military equipment has some 
vulnerabilities. This method is accomplished by 
breakage, the use of abrasives, acts of omission, 
substitutions, and contamination. A wrench, 
hammer, or other similar tool can easily destroy 
delicate instruments, gears, pumps, and other vital 
moving parts of machinery. Abrasives, placed in 
lubricants and fuels, will cause excessive wear and 
eventual breakdown of machines, engines, and 
generators. Mere neglect to perform some im-
portant, though simple, function, such as lubrica-
tion of equipment or turning on oil feed lines, will 
accomplish a saboteur's purpose. The substitu-
tion of faulty or foreign materials can materially 
affect an industrial plant and the alteration of 
blueprints can have equally destructive results. 
The contamination of fuels and lubricants is a 
procedure similar to those already mentioned. 
There are many advantages of mechanical sabo-
tage: little equipment or training is needed; de-
tection is exceedingly difficult; and it can often 
be continued in the same area over a considerable 
period of time. For example, industrial produc-
tion may be retarded to a low level but not com-
pletely stopped. During World War I it was 
4 years before damage to the propeller shaft of 
an American merchant ship was discovered. In 
World War II, German agents had as one of their 
targets the transport system of the Allied armies 
moving through northern Italy and across France; 
their purpose was to slow down progress, to dis-
tract transport personnel, and to detract investi-
gative agencies from more important tasks. 
Biological sabotage is aimed at the home front, 
especially the labor force and seeks to cause sick-
ness and absenteeism by introducing various toxins 
in sources of food and water. 
Three major categories of sabotage targets are 
transportation, industries, and natural resources. 
The importance of transportation to industries and 
to the movement of materials makes it a primary 
target, with railroads, water shipping, and air 
transport having priority in that order. Indus-
trial targets might specifically be, in order of im-
CONFIDENTIAL 
372 
portance : power plants, assembly lines, raw mate-
rials, individual machines, lubricants, and fuels. 
The category of natural resources includes mines, 
farm produce, forests, and waterways, together 
with dams, breakwaters, flood-control systems, and 
reservoirs. The disruption of the telecommunica-
tions facilities of a nation such as the United 
States, with its complex telephone, telegraph, 
cable, and radio networks, could quickly dislocate 
its economic, political, and social structure; while 
damage to public utilities, warehouses and supply 
depots, and military installations could have seri-
ous consequences. A successful attack in any of 
these categories might have a progressively serious 
effect on the labor force which is always a vital 
target. 
In a theater of operations, and particularly in an 
area formerly held by an enemy, sabotage may be 
especially advantageous against such targets as 
ships, port and dock installations, railroad junc-
tions, bridges, tunnels, switches, airports, radio 
transmitters, landing-control equipment, impor-
tant public buildings, motor pools, and ammuni-
tion, fuel and food dumps. The list of targets of 
special naval interest is extensive and includes: 
naval factories of all types, shipyards, piers and 
terminals, drydocks, loading and unloading equip-
ment, depots and storage areas, central power sta-
tions, transmission lines, transformers, water-
works, transportation facilities, communications, 
ships of all types, and labor force. 
The organized, large-scale sabotage group, care-
fully coordinated with other weapons and meas-
ures, constitutes a danger and threat in both war-
time and peacetime. In many instances these 
groups are an integral part of foreign intelligence 
services; in fact, some countries have maintained 
sabotage units for many years. In World War I, 
for example, the Germans operated an initially 
successful sabotage campaign against Allied ship-
ping; in the United States this campaign was 
directed by Franz von Rintelin who has described 
his activities in an interesting book, The Dark 
Inivader. Prior to World War II, the Nazis ini-
tiated sabotage operations in France in an effort 
to impair her industrial production and so to aid 
the activities of subversive groups. There are 
indications that these operations were successful at 
least in part.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
Nonphysical sabotage, which relates to the sys-
tematic undermining of morale and public opinion 
and makes use of false propaganda and insidious 
rumor, is a form of subversion which is a major 
type of foreign directed activity of concern to 
counterintelligence. 
SUBVERSION 
The dictionary definition of the word "subvert" 
is "to overturn, overthrow, ruin utterly; to under-
mine the morals, allegiance or faith of, corrupt." 
In its broadest sense, therefore, subversion in-
cludes both espionage and sabotage, and their con-
crete targets of information collection and phys-
ical destruction. In order to focus attention on 
the mental targets of subversion, this discussion 
will deal with activities relating to the corruption 
of the minds of men. 
A comprehensive definition of subversion is dif-
ficult to phrase because of its intermingled ab-
stract and concrete aspects. Most of its effects, 
however, are political, and it thus includes any 
activity carried on by an individual or group 
which seeks to alter the form of Government of 
the United States by unconstitutional means or 
which serves the interest of a foreign government 
in a way inimical to the United States. The edu-
cation law and the civil service law of the State 
of New York is more specific and detailed as 
quoted in the Regents' Rules on Subversive Activ-
ities: 
. . . a teacher or other employee who "wil-
fully and deliberately advocates, advises or 
teaches the doctrine that the government of 
the United States or of any state or of any 
political subdivision thereof should be over-
thrown or overturned by force, violence or 
any unlawful means," or who participates in 
the preparation, publication or distribution 
of written or printed matter advocating such 
a doctrine or advising its adoption, or who 
"organizes or helps to organize or becomes a 
member of any society or group of persons" 
which teaches or advocates such a doctrine, or 
who utters "any treasonable or seditious act 
or acts," is engaging in subversive ac-
tivity . . . 
Legally, subversion is the committing of a willful 
act inimical to the interests of the United States. 
From the intelligence point of view, subversion is 
also a specialized method of political warfare 
373 
which demands the most astute and painstaking 
counteraction. 
The term subversion, often popularly described 
as fifth column activity, is applied to a variety of 
manifestations, from an expressed attitude to a 
series of acts or statements which reveal disloyalty 
and endanger the constitutional government of 
the United States. Subversion, therefore, is a 
matter of degree and the naval officer must be 
carefully trained to recognize it in its many as-
pects. Some characteristics of subversion include 
its conspiratorial nature, the secrecy surrounding 
its efforts, and the devious, inconsistent, and some-
times seemingly conflicting means of approaching 
and attaining its eventual objectives. Perhaps the 
most serious problem is the resemblance of some 
phases of subversion to legitimate activities of a 
democratic citizenry, and differentiation must be 
made between the loyal American who exercises 
his right of criticism and the enemy who conceals 
his subversive activity by making use of the same 
right. The solution of this problem constitutes a 
heavy responsibility for counterintelligence and 
security agencies which have sometimes found 
themselves dealing with cases involving inference 
and personal judgment. For example, when a 
case against an individual lies within the area of 
ideas, even expert analyses of that case may vary 
in their conclusions as to what the individual is 
and what he actually represents. 
Shortly after World War I this problem was 
faced by Justices Holmes and Brandeis of the 
Supreme Court at which time Holmes brought 
forth the doctrine, as a standard, of "clear and 
present danger." In the case of Schenck v. United 
States, he said: "The question in every case is 
whether the words used are used in such circum-
stances and are of such a nature as to create a 
clear and present danger that they will bring about 
the substantive evils that Congress has a right to 
prevent. It is a question of proximity and de-
gree." Justice Brandeis, in the case Whitney v. 
California, further amplified this doctrine when 
he said: "No danger flowing from speech can be 
deemed clear and present, unless the incidence of 
the evil apprehended is so imminent that it may 
befall before there is an opportunity for full dis-
cussion. If there be time to expose through dis-
cussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
evil by the processes of education, the remedy to 
be applied is more speech, not enforced silence." 
Nathaniel Weyl, a former Communist Party mem-
ber, commenting on this statement in his book, 
The Battle Against Disloyalty, makes the point 
that "the purpose of the Communist movement was 
to deprive the people of the United States of any 
possibility of a 'free and open encounter' between 
truth and falsehood" and "is not a battle of ideas 
in the arena of honest discourse. The purpose is 
not to convince the majority, nor is there any will-
ingness to abide by the majority's verdict." 
This fundamental problem is summarized by 
Philip Selznick in The Organizational 'Weapon: 
A Study of Bolshevik Strategy and Tactics, pub-
lished by the Rand Corporation: 
The problem of subversion has two aspects 
which are often confused. On the one hand, a 
group is considered subversive when it seeks 
to overthrow established authority by forcible 
means. It is here that the doctrine of "clear 
and present danger" most readily applies, the 
assumption being that governments ought to 
punish acts and not thoughts, and that meas-
ures of restraint ought to be consistent with 
the seriousness of the acts committed. How-
ever, the problem is complicated when, as in 
the case of communism, subversion refers not 
only to a revolutionary program, but also to 
the manipulation of social institutions for 
alien ends, this manipulation being conducted 
covertly in the name of the institution's own 
values. 
Mr. Selznick goes on to say that confusion in 
identifying subversion can and does arise from the 
fact that new social forces develop from time to 
time in a community, which may be considered 
subversive because their motives and objectives 
are not generally understood or appreciated. The 
criterion in such instances will be the limits of the 
objectives sought and their realization within the 
established and regulated processes of constitu-
tional government. 
A study and understanding of communism can 
lead only to the conclusion that it is subversive, 
because its goal is unlimited power and its methods 
utterly disregard and directly oppose customary 
constitutional processes and restraints. Power is 
sought through the insurrectionary activities of 
a pivotally placed minority assisted by a foreign 
power.

374 
Aspects of Subversion 
Disaffection, a first step toward subversion, is a 
state of mind in which there is a basic lack of 
loyalty or regard for any constitutional form of 
government and particularly for the Government 
and Constitution of the United States. It may 
be indicated by disloyal comments, not necessarily 
designed to influence others, or by sympathetic 
association with persons or groups who have posi-
tive subversive tendencies. In and of itself, as a 
state of mind, it constitutes no criminal offense 
since no act has been committed. It is particu-
larly important to distinguish between the discon-
tented and the disaffected, as well as between 
disaffection and subversion. The step between 
disaffection and subversion is taken when the act 
is committed. Disaffection is of direct interest to 
counterintelligence because of its potential danger 
and easy conversion to subversive purposes. A 
foreign national residing within the limits of the 
United States cannot be guilty of disaffection, 
since he owes no loyalty to the United States. 
Sedition is described as acts, or words written 
or spoken, which tend to incite the citizens of a 
country to revolt or rebel against constituted 
authority. While sedition involves questions of 
constitutional law, the Congress has the implied 
right to protect the Federal Government against 
injury and the authority to punish incitements to 
violate or interfere with the execution of Federal 
laws. Sedition, therefore, involves any advice 
urging illegal resistance to the law, any attempt 
to change by illegal means the existing form of 
government, and any illegal interference with the 
execution of its policies. The key words in the 
various sedition laws are: Insubordination, dis-
loyalty, mutiny, refusal to duty, injury to the 
United States, force, and violence. In 1940, the 
sedition laws were broadened to include "any per-
sons who knowingly or wilfully advocate, abet, 
seek, advise the necessity, desirability, or propriety 
of overthrowing or destroying any government in 
the United States by force or violence." More 
recent laws, still under consideration, tend to be 
even more explicit. 
Treason, the most serious offense that can be 
committed against the Government of the United 
Approved For Release 2003/12/09 : CIA-RDP85G00105R000100210002-9

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
States, is specifically defined in the Constitution 
as follows: "Treason against the United States 
shall consist only in levying war against them, or 
in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and 
comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason, 
unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the 
same overt act, or on confession in open court." 
The basic difference between treason and sedition 
is that treason means the committing of an overt 
physical act, whereas in a case of sedition, words 
alone can constitute the offense. Treason is a 
breach of allegiance. "Levying war" has been in-
terpreted by the courts to include furnishing to an 
enemy arms, troops, supplies, information, or 
means of transportation. "Adhering to their 
enemies" is an offense which includes the trans-
mission of intelligence of military value to an 
enemy, all acts which in any way tend to obstruct 
or weaken the military operations of the United 
States, and the inciting of others to aid an enemy. 
It should be apparent that many legalities can 
arise in connection with cases of treason and 
sedition. 
Nathaniel Weyl, in the book cited above, states 
that "the United States has been extraordinarily 
tolerant of both sedition and disloyalty. No mod-
ern state has ever defined the crime of treason so 
narrowly. No nation has ever surrounded the man 
accused of betraying his country with such a for-
midable barrier of constitutional protection or 
been so reluctant to punish conspiracies directed 
at its very existence." Since World War II, how-
ever, more vigorous measures have been taken, not 
only against the underground forces of commu-
nism but also against the American Communist 
Party which has waged an unceasing campaign 
for revolution. One of the most important was the 
indictment in 1948 of 12 men charged with con-
spiracy to organize the Communist Party of the 
United States as an association of people "who 
teach and advocate the overthrow and destruction 
of the Government of the United States by force 
and violence." This organization is characterized 
by deceit, conspiratorial activity, secrecy, viru-
lence and hatred, subservience to instructions from 
the Soviet Union, and a fanaticism on the part of 
its members which is a way of life engulfing their 
entire personalities. 
375 
Methods of Subversion 
A study of the American Communist Party and 
its activities will provide a detailed illustration of 
subversion and its methods. As a part of the party 
discipline each member is carefully instructed in 
the basic principles of organization, propaganda, 
and agitation through the doctrinal teachings of 
Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin by which the 
party directs the struggles of the working class in 
gaining victories while avoiding unnecessary sac-
rifices. These teachings also show the party the 
best methods of overthrowing capitalism, which 
will lead to the establishment of a Socialist Soviet 
Republic in the United States. A clue to the ad-
vantages of subversion from the Communist point 
of view are the words, "unnecessary sacrifices;" 
at the same time its principal methods, or tech-
niques, are identified by the terms, organization, 
propaganda, and agitation, which will be discussed 
in turn. 
Organizational Methods 
In order to understand the organizational 
method of subversion it is necessary first to appre-
ciate the power generated not only by one organ-
ized group but also by an entire organized politi-
cal community. The recognized constitutional 
order of a democratic state imposes positive re-
sponsibilities on group or political party power 
and enforces regulations governing the use of or 
accession to that power. The regulations of the 
constitutional system are continually being ex-
tended into new areas where group power is being 
developed and won. For example, political parties, 
pressure groups, unions, and various other agencies 
attaining power adapt themselves to the constitu-
tional order and so contribute to the continued 
stability of the state. For this reason subversion 
is not involved. 
Communist political doctrine, fully recognizing 
the potential of group power, seeks to exploit it in 
all social institutions regardless of whether or not 
they are normally political in nature, and to 
achieve the consolidation of total group power by 
one ruling group. Hiding behind the customary 
and accepted rules of constitutional procedure, 
the Communists achieve power by the manipula-
tion of minority units, thus actually circumventing 
these rules. Their search for power does not stop

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
short of total absolute control. For these reasons, 
communistic organizational methods are subver-
sive and can be characterized as total subversion. 
The implications of these methods in their totality 
are indeed staggering and represent a challenge to 
democratic society that is perhaps unparalleled. 
The importance of ideology to communism is 
well known; the almost equal importance of organ-
izational control was emphasized by Lenin when 
he said: "The proletariat has no other weapon in 
the fight for power except organization . . . the 
proletariat can become and inevitably will become 
a dominant force only because its intellectual unity 
created by the principles of Marxism is fortified 
by the material unity of organization which welds 
millions of toilers into an army of the working 
class." For the Communists, therefore, ideology 
is only a beginning; the ultimate goal is the con-
solidation of total power in a select group within 
organizations which can force a final and irrevo-
cable decision on society. 
One method is the creation of acknowledged 
political organizations, such as the American Com-
munist Party, legally constituted and openly de-
voted to the expansion of membership and the 
enlistment of popular support for political control 
through recognized constitutional procedures. 
A second method is the development of "front 
organizations" in any area of social activity, po-
litical, professional, cultural, or economic. Com-
munist-controlled from their inception, these or-
ganizations have innocent-appearing and seem-
ingly commendable objectives designed to appeal 
to specific groups and individuals who may be 
dominated and exploited for subversive purposes. 
By such means, propaganda is disseminated 
through apparently acceptable channels, informa-
tion is obtained fox further organizational activi-
ties, such as names and addresses, and subversive 
groups gain at least partial control over those 
which are nonsubversive. 
Front organizations have the mutual character-
istics of common origin, idealistic sounding title, 
rigid conformity to the Communist "line," and 
deception; they are either mass, membership, or 
paper organizations, and solicit and make use of 
the names of prominent persons. The same party 
members may belong to several front organiza-
tions. In recent years, hundreds of such organ-
CONFIDENTIAL 
376 
izations have sprung up, but have quickly ceased 
to exist when exposed. In some of his writings, 
Stalin has stressed the importance of these groups, 
describing them as "transmission belts" and quot-
ing Lenin to support his point of view: 
The dictatorship (of the proletariat) can-
not be effectively realized without "belts" to 
transmit power from the vanguard (the Com-
munist Party) to the mass of the advanced 
class, and from this to the mass of those who 
labor. 
The membership ordinarily includes four cate-
gories of individuals: (1) Admitted Communist 
Party members; (2) Party members whose true 
status is concealed; (3) Consistent accepters of 
the party discipline although they are not party 
members; (4) Those attracted by the announced 
objectives of the group, the prominence of its spon-
sors, and general sociability. The means by which 
these organizations are established and controlled 
have been described by a former high official of 
the American Communist Party in his testimony 
before the Special Committee on Un-American 
Activities, House of Representatives: 
A front organization is organized by the 
Communist Party in the following fashion: 
First, a number of sympathizers who are close 
to the party and whom the party knows can 
be depended upon to carry out party orders, 
are gotten together and formed into a nucleus 
which issues a call for the organization of a 
particular front organization which the party 
wants to establish. And generally after that 
is done a program is drawn up by the party, 
which this provisional committee adopts. 
Then, on the basis of this provisional pro-
gram, all kinds of individuals are canvassed 
to become sponsors of the organization, which 
is to be launched in the very near future. A 
provisional secretary is appointed before the 
organization is launched and in every instance 
in our day the secretary who was appointed 
was a member of the Communist Party . . . 
And as president of the organization we would 
put up some prominent public figure who was 
willing to accept the presidency . . ., gen-

carry out party orders, was included, and out 
of this number a small executive committee 
was organized . . . which carried on the af-
fairs of the organization, so-called, and this 
small executive committee, with the secretary, 
really ran the organization . . . when mani-
festos or decisions are made, those campaigns 
are ordered by the Communist Party. 
The purpose of all of these new organizations 
is, of course, to produce new sources of political 
power at the same time subtracting power from 
established institutions. However, new effective 
groupings may not be possible or desirable, so 
that a third and particularly insidious method is 
adopted, that of capturing established institutions, 
completely or in part. While the framework and 
facade are retained, the body and working mech-
anism are replaced or reoriented so that these or-
ganizations have new, though concealed, loyalties 
and purposes and are no longer a normal part of 
the constitutional order but instrumentalities pre-
pared for revolution. In connection with this 
method two points should be noted: first, vital 
nerve centers and key institutions are primary 
targets so that controlling power may be achieved 
with a minimum of mass support; and second, 
within a target group the replacement of top lead-
ership is followed by a remolding of the entire 
control system which will ensure uniformity of 
opinion, complete conformity, and the greatest 
possible favorable influence within the broad base 
of the membership. Even if that favorable in-
fluence is not gained, the organizational mech-
anism will maintain control, so that here again 
minimum support makes maximum power possi-
ble. For example, in a Communist-controlled 
union, headquarters officials, organizers, and shop 
stewards all become part of an integrated appara-
tus leaving the base membership with no formal-
ized, and frequently no effective, means of expres-
sion. The total impact of this organizational 
method was vividly and startlingly demonstrated 
in the case of Czechoslovakia where the Commu-
nists seized power in February 1948. As noted in 
The Organizational Weapon: 
It was not an insurrection, involving at-
tacks upon a ruling group, but a seizure of 
total power by those who already held domi-
nant influence in the government. It was a 
revolution nonetheless, for it resulted in a 
fundamental shift in the locus of sovereignty 
269196-54-25 
from constitutionally restrained parliamen-
tarism to a totalitarian state. What was 
overturned in Prague was an institutional 
system, not a regime. 
Striving to seize the power potential of any 
attractive formalized group enterprise, the Com-
munists take advantage of inherent weaknesses 
which can be readily manipulated to their own 
purposes. Within any organization a small in-
formal group with special cohesive interests can 
become a dominating force. Once an official posi-
tion has been captured, it can be used to influence 
decisions and to direct the distribution of internal 
and external power. Through the informal 
group and the official position, steps can be taken 
to reorganize the formal group, ostensibly to per-
mit greater internal efficiency or better coopera-
tion with external groups, but actually to consoli-
date the influence and controls of the informal 
group. In many, if not most organizations, the 
membership is loosely joined together and mobil-
ized for concentrated action only on special occa-
sions and for particular short-term reasons or 
goals. The ability of the informal group to inte-
grate the membership closely and continuously 
activate it provides a new source of power which 
can be directed in many ways. Most organiza-
tions also have limited objectives within their par-
ticular fields of interest. However, once internal 
strength is concentrated, the limited objectives 
can be expanded as desired. It is apparent that 
ideology becomes an important means for inte-
grating mass membership and in developing or-
ganizational power. 
In selecting an established institution for cap-
ture, the Communists consider most carefully its 
relative importance in the social structure, the 
breadth of its base, the composition of its member-
ship, its acceptability within the community, and 
the potential of its power. Their ingenuity of 
analysis leads them into unexpected areas and 
their systematic procedures accomplish amazing 
results. Infiltration and penetration are followed 
by mass political education or indoctrination. 
Emphasis is placed on the importance of organ-
ized and combined positive action, an aggressive 
hatred against so-called "evil forces" such as 
capitalism, intense loyalty, and continuous self-
sacrifice. The membership must acquire a sense

of mission and dedication, their lives must be cen-
tered around the group, and they must be per-
sonally committed to the principle of mutual 
support. 
There are many types of institutions selected 
for Communist capture. Typical are the youth 
groups which have been primary targets all over 
the world because they are often effective breeding 
grounds for social strife and unrest and for the 
recruitment of new communist members. Many 
of the leaders in the American Communist Party 
began their work in their youth and it has been 
estimated by the FBI that the average age at 
which men and women join the party or its youth 
branch is 22.2 years, with ages ranging from 14 
to 35. The approach to young people at the begin-
ning is often indirect and may be only a matter of 
parties, dances, and socials; once recruited, how-
ever, the individual becomes a virtual prisoner. 
Of interest is the fact that many of these youthful 
recruits have a high native intelligence and much 
natural ability. 
In addition to labor unions which have already 
been mentioned, minority groups are excellent 
areas for Communist exploitation. Differences 
in language or race, suspicions, and misunder-
standings are magnified into open discontent and 
disaffection which are subverted as sources of 
power. For example, the Communists have en-
deavored to appear as champions of the American 
Negro, promising much, and concealing their true 
objectives under high-sounding words. In addi-
tion, they have attempted to undermine worthy 
negro organizations. Refugee groups, often dis-
contented, have similar potentialities. The 
Armed Forces and principal veterans' organiza-
tions are composite social groups of great impor-
tance. According to the FBI, Communist policy 
in respect to the Armed Forces in the postwar 
period has been to discourage the enlistment of 
non-Communist youths; for party members to 
create confusion and dissension if drafted; for 
members not subject to draft to obtain work in 
defense plants in order to promote dissension. 
The overall purpose is to reduce the effectiveness 
of the Armed Forces. In the case of the veterans, 
some of their objectives have been espoused by the 
Communists in an effort to win support. The 
CONFIDENTIAL 
378 
control of civil police is a means of preventing 
action against subversive enterprise. 
For their purposes the Communists do not find 
it essential to establish complete control over all 
organizations, for in order to influence policy deci-
sions infiltration is often sufficient. The organi-
zational method, therefore, includes gaining access 
to non-Communist groups in order to guide un-
suspecting loyal citizens into supporting policies 
of the party. All types of groups, from women's 
clubs to government agencies, are potential targets. 
Peace petitions support the Communist world 
strategy, and even the control of routine decisions 
at lower levels in government can have important 
cumulative results. 
Leadership 
It is a fundamental Communist principle that 
the durability of a movement depends upon stable 
leadership to insure continuity. An elite group 
of directors, called the vanguard, is therefore es-
sential to maneuver the masses into the desired 
position. The entire party structure is based on 
strict administrative accountability and a clear-
cut chain of command. The highest loyalty and. 
obedience are demanded from every party member 
and those who deviate are summarily subjected to 
harsh treatment. 
The development of adamant leaders begins 
with a psychological process of re-shaping person-
ality, which from the point of view of American 
values includes the destruction of all independence 
of judgment and the erasing of environmental and 
educational influences. Then follows a gradual 
remolding into the professional revolutionist, a 
person who is totally and pitifully dependent on 
the party, completely obedient to instructions, 
zealously fanatic, and merciless to those who falter 
or fail. This complete transformation of the 
inner man is subversion of the most heartless type. 
According to Nathaniel Weyl, a number of clan-
destine party schools have this as their mission, 
with students carefully selected for their qualities 
of intelligence, loyalty, and demonstrated courage. 
Closely guarded, these students take assumed 
names and are not permitted to leave the school 
or to communicate with anyone outside its walls 
during their training period of from 6 to 10 weeks. 
The new leader emerges in the mold of the party,

warped by revolutionary desires, filled with hate 
for any society which opposes the goals he had 
been taught to attain, and ignorant of all values 
which give life meaning for normal people. In-
tolerant of any differences of opinion, he will fight 
by the foulest means to attain his objectives; com-
munism is the only truth he knows. 
Propaganda 
Although the training of active or potential 
party members is not intended to be as complete or 
intensive as that of party leaders, they too must 
be properly oriented and indoctrinated. This is 
accomplished largely by propaganda, which from 
the Communist point of view is indoctrination 
through the dissemination of ideas to small groups 
of society. Books, pamphlets, magazines, news-
papers, bulletins, letters and postcards, lectures, 
movies, radio broadcasts and various kinds of 
group entertainment are effective media for pre-
senting doctrine and spreading rumors. 
The insidiousness of propaganda for subversion 
makes it extremely difficult to identify and evalu-
ate; its specific purposes may be completely con-
cealed at the outset. Seldom will it encourage 
open revolt, but will have an emotional rather than 
an intellectual appeal aimed at lowering morale 
and stimulating discontent. Sometimes it will 
be directed solely toward effecting certain organi-
zational changes so that, of itself, it has no ap-
parent propaganda characteristics. Failure to 
recognize this type of propaganda obviously leads 
to errors in correctly evaluating Communist ac-
tivity. In many respects, Communist propaganda 
in America appears to have concentrated on mid-
dle class groups because their vulnerability tends 
to be more psychological than organizational. 
Since the organizations of the middle class are 
more diverse and less centralized than those of the 
laboring class, organizational subversion methods 
cannot have as great a power impact; the middle 
class, however, is often more receptive to ideologi-
cal exploitation. 
Louis Budenz in his revealing book, Men,With-
out Faces, emphasizes the effectiveness of Com-
munist propaganda in molding American thought, 
and comments "we are likely to forget that it is 
the Communists' hidden influence on American 
opinion that has been most devastating." He 
points out that one purpose of this attack on men's 
minds has been to convince Americans that the 
Soviet fifth column does not really exist and that 
revelations of Soviet espionage activity are nothing 
but the result of hysteria. He adds that the Com-
munists "have done a fairly adequate job of mak-
ing America ashamed of defending its own free-
doms." The lengthy trial of the 12 Communist 
Party leaders in 1949-50 afforded an opportunity 
to attack American courts in the person of Judge 
Harold R. Medina who was compared to Hitler, 
accused of pro-Fascist tendencies and prejudices, 
described as a wealthy corporation lawyer, and 
labelled as a discriminator against Jews and 
Negroes. The purpose of this vicious campaign 
may have been to implant the heinous suggestion 
that the American legal system is no more than a 
sham and a mere pretence of real justice for all. 
In The Red Decade, Eugene Lyons sums up one 
pattern of Communist propaganda activities in his 
discussion of the American League for Peace and 
Democracy: 
In eight years of existence under changing 
names this League probably reached more 
Americans with its propaganda than any other 
foreign agency in the whole history of our 
country. By a generous definition of the "de-
mocracy" it ostensibly defended, the organi-
zation worked busily with all other Commu-
nist stooge groups. This process of mutual 
help expanded the clamor and impressiveness 
of the incredible revolution immensely?a sort 
of multiple-mirror trick. The League pub-
lished a monthly magazine, distributed mil-
lions of pieces of literature, staged scores of 
parades and mass meetings, lobbied for legis-
lation, sent its speakers into hundreds of 
clubs and churches, promoted plays and mo-
tion pictures in line with its policies, and de-
veloped hundreds of contact points in our 
Federal and local government. 
A further pattern of Communist activity is a 
vigorous counterpropaganda effort designed to 
nullify or reduce the effects of informational and 
educational programs conducted by legally con-
stituted American groups. Smear campaigns, as 
well as infiltrated organizations or front groups 
which protest and decry governmental and pri-
vate information programs, are commonly used. 
Of particular interest is the fact that the Com-
munists not only employ propaganda for the pur-
poses of furthering their ideological program, but

also attempt to maximize the possibilities of its 
favorable results by gaining some control of the 
group at which it is directed. In this manner, its 
acceptance may be facilitated. This strategy in-
dicates the very close relationships of the organi-
zational and propaganda methods of subversion. 
Agitation 
Certain variations in the propaganda method 
of subversion as applied to different social groups 
justify the identification of a third method, namely 
agitation. In fact Lenin made such a distinction, 
considering propaganda as an output of many 
ideas to small groups and agitation as the broad-
casting of a few ideas, or only one, to a mass of 
people. This distinction coincides with that made 
between the vanguard which is to be pursuaded 
and the masses which are to be led. 
Agitation has more of an action connotation 
than does propaganda in that its appeal to large 
groups is in the nature of an immediate solution 
of current problems and the active improvement 
of unfavorable situations which may have been 
magnified into impending crises. One objective 
of Communist agitation is the fomenting of strikes 
and disorder. Before going further, however, it 
should be pointed out that there is grave difficulty 
in distinguishing between strikes which are Com-
munist-inspired and those which arise out of the 
orderly legal processes followed by responsible 
labor unions. To brand every labor strike as 
Communist-led is as dangerous to the welfare of 
the democratic state as to scoff at the possibilities 
that they are communist inspired. It is for this 
reason, among others, that the Communists find 
the area of labor relations such a fertile field for 
activity, and concentrate so much energy on strike 
tactics. Whether or not a strike results in specific 
benefits to the workers means little or nothing to 
the Communist leaders. Of far greater impor-
tance is the opportunity provided to test Com-
munist strength and control over the groups 
concerned, to determine the weaknesses of their 
opposition, to channel the loyalties of the strikers 
toward communist leadership, and to give them 
experience and training in mass action. Mass 
picketing which will include all the workers, their 
wives, children, and sympathizers is especially 
sought as a method of magnifying the impact of 
CONFIDENTIAL 
380 
a strike. The Communists' own strike objective, 
of course, is to solidify their controls and create a 
total political power that can be decisive in the 
larger struggle. They obtain a unique advantage 
whenever they can force the legally constituted 
government into the position of being a strike-
breaker. Lenin has described the ultimate use of 
the mass strike in words of significant import: 
Prior to January . . . 1905, the revolution-
ary party of Russia consisted of a small hand-
ful of people, and the reformists of those days 
. . . derisively called us a "sect" . . . Within 
a few months, however, the picture completely 
changed. The hundreds of revolutionary So-
cial-Democrats "suddenly" grew into thou-
sands; the thousands became leaders of 
between two and three million proletarians 
. . . The principal means by which this trans-
formation was brought about was the mass 
strike. The peculiar feature of the Russian 
revolution is that in its social content it was a 
bourgeois-democratic revolution, but in its 
methods of struggle it was a proletarian revo-
lution. It was a bourgeois-democratic revo-
lution since the aim toward which it strove 
directly and which it could reach directly with 
the aid of its own forces was a democratic 
republic, an eight-hour day and the confisca-
tion of the immense estates of nobility . . . 
At the same time the Russian revolution was 
also a proletarian revolution, not only in the 
sense that the proletariat was the leading 
force, the vanguard of the movement, but also 
in the sense that the specifically proletarian 
means of struggle?namely the strike?was 
the principal instrument employed for rous-
ing the masses and the most characteristic 
phenomenon in the wave-like rise of decisive 
events. 
COUNTERESPIONAGE 
A highly specialized activity to be undertaken 
only by trained and skilled personnel, counter-
espionage is directed against enemy spies and 
secret agents in order to forestall, neutralize, or 
confuse their activities. Since a primary purpose 
is to apprehend spies and agents before they have 
accomplished their mission, counterespionage 
must establish an advance warning system, block 
access to potential targets, and render ineffective 
all efforts to locate, collect, and communicate in-
formation. Counterespionage activity takes place 
both in the United States and abroad; its intensity 
is proportionate to the tensions of the existing

international situation. In time of peace particu-
lar problems are involved in applying its tech-
niques in such a way that they will not unjustifiably 
restrain the rights and freedom of the individual 
citizen. 
The disclosure of foreign espionage services is a 
most difficult and exacting assignment, first, be-
cause customary police procedures and routine 
criminal detection methods are inappropriate and 
generally futile, and second, because spies and 
agents usually are persons with outstanding native 
abilities, unusual talents, and intensive training. 
Intensive study of known past activities must be 
made in an effort to determine any possible weak-
nesses. Most of the spies mentioned in chapter II 
were apprehended by skillful exploitation of their 
weaknesses. Undoubtedly, there have been many 
more who escaped detection, so it is much wiser to 
overestimate rather than underestimate the abili-
ties of agents and spies and the extent of their 
activities. Prior to World War I the Germans 
were particularly effective in counterespionage, 
apprehending 411 spies as compared to the 20 
caught by the British and some 40 by the French. 
Personnel Attributes 
Spies and agents must be opposed by counter-
espionage personnel who likewise possess special 
attributes. In his intriguing book, Spy-Catcher, 
Oreste Pinto, a former counterintelligence officer 
attached to Allied forces in Europe during World 
War II, prescribes 10 qualities, of which only the 
last 3 can be acquired by study and training. The 
first is an ex,ceptional memory, not only the ability 
to remember events, faces, and places for indefinite 
periods of time, but also the capacity to interview 
and interrogate without written notes. Infinite 
patience and attention to detail may be the most 
important factors in the eventual apprehension 
of an agent whose cover story is air-tight except 
for one trivial fact. A facile gift for languages 
can be helpful in a variety of situations, from 
conversing with suspects to determine their true 
place of origin and to sense overtones or implica-
tions in their remarks to checking thoroughly on 
letters, documents, or any written matter in their 
belongings or on their person. An agent, for 
example, may pose as a Spanish exporter when 
881 
actually he is a Pole with an excellent knowledge 
of Spanish. 
A working knowledge of practical psychology is 
indispensable in selecting the proper approach to 
different types of people, and in stimulating in-
voluntary actions on their part to prearranged 
situations. The counterespionage operator must 
possess courage of a high moral order, which in-
cludes an unwavering belief in the fundamental 
rightness of his cause. He must be a born actor 
capable of maintaining the most rigid controls 
over his emotions and sentiments. This quality 
is associated with knowledge of practical psychol-
ogy in that it comes into action after the counter-
espionage operator has assessed his opponent or 
suspect and determined the particular approach 
he will make. Successful acting also requires the 
quality of patience, because a part may have to be 
played for days on end and impatience or bore-
dom will betray it. Skill in the mechanics of dis-
guise must be matched by lifelike consistency in 
its portrayal. 
It is evident that thus far the qualities of the 
counterespionage operator match those of the 
espionage agent, which gives pertinency to the 
saying "it takes a spy to catch a spy." There is 
a difference, however; the counterspy must possess 
these qualities to a higher degree and, in addition, 
the mental capacity to outwit his opponent. This 
involves a sense of logic which is associated with 
a gift of detection. The explanations of innocent 
suspects are usually more confused, incoherent, 
and illogical than those of actual agents, and an 
innocent man may occasionally have much more 
difficulty in accounting for his presence at a par-
ticular time and place than the agent whose cover 
story has been carefully prepared. For this rea-
son, counterespionage personnel must be able to 
analyze available evidence logically, testing each 
item, understanding the relationships of cause and 
effect and distinguishing clearly between the true 
and the false. Something of a sixth sense is neces-
sary to stimulate a further search for an obscure 
hidden bit of information which may provide the 
only clue. An unexplainable sense of impending 
danger may also come from this mental attribute. 
These inborn qualities can be fortified and 
strengthened by others that are acquired, the first 
of which, related to the capacity for detection, is

CONFIDENTIAL 
INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
practical knowledge of the techniques of espionage. 
In the course of its long and tortuous history, 
espionage has developed and made common use 
of a variety of techniques, including methods of 
secret writing and of communicating information. 
In addition, some intelligence services, having 
adopted particular methods, continue to use them 
as a matter of routine and with little imagination, 
one notable example being the Germans who 
seemed incapable of change even after their meth-
ods had been discovered. During World War II, 
they made use of microcameras resembling pocket 
fountain pens to photograph documents and pro-
duce negatives which could be transmitted under 
a postage stamp. Even after this clever device 
was discovered, the Germans continued to use it 
for mail whose addresses were suspect. Knowl-
edge of various techniques, therefore, can be of 
tremendous assistance in unmasking espionage 
agents. A precise knowledge of geography, with 
an emphasis on cities and towns, serves as a means 
of substantiating or refuting cover stories and of 
facilitating movement in particular areas of ac-
tivity. To be of the greatest value, this knowledge 
must be specific, as to streets, important buildings, 
restaurants, hotels, and peculiar local characteris-
tics. Finally, a usable knowledge of international 
law is helpful in securing certain individual rights 
and privileges and in knowing when these rights 
are improperly claimed. 
Apprehension of Espionage Agents 
Three ways to prevent agents and spies from 
accomplishing their mission are: (1) to apprehend 
them at the point of entry into the target country, 
combat zone, or specific area of interest; (2) to 
disclose their particular cover or disguise; and (3) 
to intercept their communications. The last is 
the most critical stage of their activities. 
While security controls will be considered more 
fully in a later section, it is appropriate here to 
mention that in peacetime the United States is 
protected against illegal entry by the Border Pa-
trol, Customs and Immigration authorities, and 
other civilian law enforcement agencies. Because 
of our extensive coastline, however, complete 
border control is impracticable. The Soviet 
Union, on the other hand, maintains a much more 
elaborate system which includes extensive border 
CONFIDENTIAL 
382 
patrols, barbed wire, electrified fences, and 
cleared, plowed strips of land. In a combat area 
during wartime, or in a military zone, additional 
travel controls are enforced, such as travel per-
mits, check points, both stationary and moving, 
curfew hours, and questioning of civilians. Other 
controls in a military zone are provided by defin-
ing restricted areas to divert civilian traffic, pub-
lishing lists of occupations available only to cer-
tain individuals, and supervising civilian labor 
groups by military personnel. In wartime, the 
control of civilian signal communications and 
postal service is often productive. 
For a number of reasons, the detection of an 
enemy agent should not always be followed imme-
diately by taking him into custody. In the first 
place, he will quite probably be replaced by an-
other agent whose identity is not known; or 
already detected by another intelligence agency, 
he may be under its surveillance or being supplied 
with false information. By leaving him at large 
under constant surveillance it may be possible to 
locate his associates and superiors, to determine 
the true nature of his mission, which will reveal 
the type of information required by an enemy, 
and to discover his methods of communication. 
He may also become a means for undermining the 
enemy espionage system. Even if the enemy 
quickly realizes that he is supplying them with 
false information, it will lead to distrust of other 
agents because of the same possibility in their case, 
thus creating general uncertainty. 
Techniques and Procedures 
Advance warning of attempts at espionage can 
be gained in a number of ways. One approach is 
to select probable targets of a foreign intelligence 
service and to determine points of greatest vulner-
ability. At these targets covert agents can be 
placed and/or a friendly informant network can 
be organized; in the case of the latter, it should be 
extended to include likely cover firms and enter-
prises as well as places of possible communications. 
In areas where espionage activities are suspected, 
curtailment of the customary channels of informa-
tion may force the enemy agent to take greater 
risks, thus increasing possibilities of detection.

posedly classified information may have similar

results. The surveillance of suspects, identifica-
tion requirements, traffic controls, and checks on 
communications methods, including signalling, 
may be productive. The penetration of foreign 
intelligence services is, of course, an ultimate in 
providing advance warning and positive clues to 
covert activities. 
The disclosure of an enemy agent's cover can be 
a long, painstaking, and sometimes frustrating 
process. In addition to stringent security controls, 
appropriate techniques may include investigation 
and interrogation, name checks, and question-
naires. A. sense of discrimination must be devel-
oped in order to avoid wasting time on investiga-
tions of amateur or unimportant agents. Foreign 
intelligence services often flood a target country 
with large numbers of relatively ainateur agents 
in an attempt to overburden its counterespionage 
service and to divert attention from the profes-
sional, specialist agents. Routine background in-
vestigations and the screening of refugees and 
displaced persons must be conscientiously handled. 
A close inspection of bank accounts, financial 
transactions, and credit company records is often 
productive, and, while excellent cover methods 
have been perfected, as long as agents are paid or 
receive funds for their operations some traces can 
usually be found. Prompt reporting of all infor-
mation and evidence is essential to successful 
investigation. 
In interrogating espionage agents, it should be 
remembered that they are consummate actors, of 
whom it is dangerous to form snap judgments on 
first encounter. Articles found on the suspect's 
person or in his quarters often provide the basis 
for initial interrogation leading to disclosure. 
While lists of contacts are undoubtedly committed 
to memory, there is always the possibility that the 
agent will have in his possession an address on a 
scrap of paper, photographic equipment of some 
type, some means of secret writing, or radio or 
electronic equipment. The case of Alphons 
Eugene Timmermans during World War II is 
illustrative. A young Belgian merchant seaman, 
he had reached England by devious means and 
won the confidence of the Belgian government-in-
exile with a most convincing cover story. As a 
result, he obtained and transmitted information to 
the Nazis regarding American troop movements 
383 
and locations of British ammunition dumps, air-
fields, and naval installations, among other items 
of interest. Eventual search of his person led to 
the discovery in his wallet of an envelope contain-
ing pyramidon powder, some orange sticks nor-
mally used in manicuring fingernails, and a piece 
of cotton?all essential for invisible writing. At 
his apartment was found a transportable radio 
which could be strapped around the waist as a 
belt. 
Interception of an agent's communications may 
be achieved by monitoring the air waves for sig-
nals from wireless transmitters, mail inspection, 
checks on telephones and the telegraph, surveil-
lance of possible couriers such as merchant seamen, 
raids and searches of suspected areas, and censor-
ship. Many of these methods are, of course, lim-
ited to times of war. 
The specific techniques of counterespionage, just 
as those of espionage, are closely guarded secrets. 
It is obvious that economy in this aspect of counter-
intelligence can be dangerous, if not fatal, consid-
ering the potential damage a single enemy agent 
can do and the relatively small additional effort 
and cost which might have defeated him. 
COUNTERSABOTAGE 
Initially at least the activities of counterespio-
nage and countersabotage are similar, if not iden-
tical. The mission of the enemy agent may be the 
collection of information or the physical destruc-
tion of particular targets or both; and most fre-
quently the collection of some information is 
necessarily preliminary to an act of sabotage. The 
trained saboteur, like the espionage agent, must 
gain entry to his target country and/or to a specific 
area for operations; he will employ suitable cover 
and disguise; and he has the responsibility of 
reporting back to his "home office" the results of 
his efforts. In the case of sabotage, however, the 
critical point is access to the specific target. While 
counterespionage, to all practical purposes, oper-
ates to gain advance warning of proposed sabotage, 
to prevent the obtaining of information for sab-
otage activities, and to discover potential sabo-
teurs, countersabotage takes over those activities 
designed to impede or prevent the act, to reduce 
its total effectiveness, and through study, to 
strengthen preventive and security measures.

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
CONFIDENEL 
While acts of sabotage usually take place only 
in time of war or immediately prior to an out-
break of hostilities, their planning and prepara-
tion are undoubtedly begun in time of peace. In 
previous wars, the United States, fortunately, has 
been relatively free of any widespread sabotage 
problems; however, in the event of any future war, 
it is logical to assume that aggressive sabotage will 
be attempted on a broad scale in view of the ulti-
mate decisive effects of American industrial pro-
duction. Countersabotage, therefore, has assumed 
a greater significance than ever before, and it be-
hooves the intelligence officer to be thoroughly 
familiar with its problems and procedures. 
A first step in approaching the problem of sab-
otage is to determine the most likely and most 
vulnerable targets, such as transportation systems, 
industrial plants, and military installations. A 
second step is to select, by process of elimination, 
the points within particular installations or facili-
ties which are most vulnerable to sabotage. For 
example, in an industrial plant, its source of elec-
trical power and its assembly lines could be pri-
mary, ultimate targets; however, if they are well 
protected and relatively inaccessible, the most vul-
nerable secondary target, called the immediate 
target, might be the power lines from their source. 
The destruction of these lines might well neutral-
ize the primary target, even though it is inaccessi-
ble. A third step is to survey the potential target 
area to insure that the necessary physical security 
measures have been established and are being 
maintained. Careful attention must be given to 
eliminating any natural hazards which may be 
present, such as those arising from the improper 
stowage of combustibles, chemicals, and explosives, 
defective mechanical equipment, and poor sanitary 
conditions, in short, general plant protection. 
The prevention of sabotage requires security 
controls over information, communications, per-
sonnel, critical materials, and potential saboteurs 
operating from within or without. General se-
curity controls over information will be discussed 
in a later section. Since the techniques for de-
tecting and apprehending saboteurs and espionage 
agents are similarf emphasis in this section will 
be on physical security measures, the application 
of counterintelligence techniques to cases of 
CONFIDENTIAL 
384 
sabotage, and procedures to limit damage from 
sabotage. 
Physical Security Controls and Measures 
The most common preventive measures for 
physical security are physical equipment, guards, 
identification systems, and the establishment of 
restricted areas. Physical equipment includes 
fencing, barbed wire, walls, alarm systems, special 
electronic devices, and other mechanical means. 
Protective screening should be placed over all 
vulnerable windows, ventilators, drains, or other 
small openings; and appropriate barriers should 
be constructed to prevent access from adjacent 
buildings, overpasses, and similarly located struc-
tures. Entrances should be kept at a minimum 
and locked or guarded at all times. Within a 
target area special protection should be given to 
machines and equipment vital to total operation 
and difficult to replace, such as switch boards, pre-
cision tools, transformers, regulator stations, and 
power terminals. Exterior lighting systems 
should be so designed that movement of personnel 
can be readily observed. 
In studying problems of physical security and 
the use of preventive equipment, it should be 
remembered that certain factors favor the accom-
plishment of sabotage. No unprotected fence or 
barrier will completely prohibit entry to an area. 
Under cover of darkness, a saboteur who is thor-
oughly familiar with his target area can move 
with ease, unseen and unheard, to within reach 
of almost any guard. Finally, with the inde-
pendent choice of time and place, the saboteur has 
a great advantage in the element of surprise. On 
the other hand, he can be impeded, if not stopped, 
by such factors as adequate lighting, delays cre-
ated by physical barriers, noise inadvertently 
made by him, and his own errors arising out of 
the emotional excitement of the moment. 
Guards are a supplement to physical equipment 
and the means of enforcing general security meas-
ures. They should be well-trained, efficient, vig-
orous, well-informed, and self-reliant. Patrols 
at irregular intervals, close attention to most vul-
nerable points, and alert checking on any dis-
turbances within assigned areas of responsibility 
are matters of efficient organization and training. 
Guards should not permit themselves to be drawn

uunFIDENTIAL 
away from their own areas or posts by commotion 
at another, and under no circumstances are in-
dividuals without proper credentials to be ad-
mitted. Materials in transit and receiving and 
shipping platforms must be continually guarded. 
The establishment of special restrictions for vital 
areas within an installation strengthens security 
controls for such vulnerable targets as power 
plants, experimental laboratories, transformer 
rooms, and arms and ammunition storage. Ade-
quate fire protection, including both equipment 
and trained personnel, is essential to physical 
security. 
Particularly in time of war, concealment and 
camouflage are helpful measures. In some in-
stances, vital installations are constructed under-
ground to minimize the possibilities of detection; 
in others, camouflage is used to make important 
targets look like something else, or nothing at all. 
Various illusions are created by means of nets, 
paint, and the planting of trees and bushes on 
roofs of buildings. 
Techniques and Procedures 
Countersabotage personnel, like all others en-
gaged in the intelligence activity, make use of com-
prehensive files regarding incidents of sabotage, 
including the types of targets attacked, the equip-
ment and materials used, the methods of attack, 
and the particular individuals apprehended. 
These files can be supplemented by information 
from fire reports of insurance companies, fire de-
partments, underwriters' laboratories, and special 
police department files. One of the first items of 
interest is to determine whether or not the sabotage 
act is an isolated case, perpetrated by the independ-
ent saboteur, or part of an organized effort directed 
from foreign sources. Spot reports submitted to 
intelligence headquarters are of material assist-
ance for evaluative purposes, and up-to-date files 
can provide important and significant clues. 
Informants among civilian and military per-
sonnel and friendly associations with plant super-
visors and security guards can do much to 
strengthen all security measures. In apprehend-
ing saboteurs common use is made of interrogation 
and investigation. 
The investigation of sabotage will often uncover 
the motive behind it. For example, a fire in a 
269196-54----28 
385 
blueprint room may be designed to tie up produc-
tion or to conceal the theft of certain prints. If 
the prints concern new aircraft design and pro-
duction, the motive assumes greater meaning. 
Although the methods and the means are often 
readily determined, the detection of the individual 
is much more difficult. There is a close relation-
ship between the degree of efficiency of the secu-
rity measures in force at the time and the facility 
with which an investigation can be made. In 
conducting an investigation of sabotage, a common 
procedure is to pursue answers to the questions, 
What? When? How? Where? Why? and Who? 
While each method of sabotage requires some 
specialized knowledge on the part of the investi-
gator, there are certain general procedures appli-
cable to each. In order to establish a case of 
incendiary sabotage, it is necessary to know: first, 
the exact point of origin of the fire; second, the 
exact time the fire started; and third, the criminal 
intent to destroy. Arrival, if possible, at the scene 
while the fire is still burning will permit observa-
tion of its extent, its intensity, characteristics of 
smoke, and other features which may establish 
point of origin and the possible use of accelerants. 
Maliciously damaged fire equipment and alarm 
systems, propped open door and windows, the out-
break of fire simultaneously at several points, 
odors, weather conditions, and individuals at the 
scene may provide clues. The pyromaniac, for 
example, will often remain in the immediate area 
as a matter of personal satisfaction and evidence 
varying degrees of emotional excitement. How-
ever, the detection of the perpetrator and the iden-
tification of the case as arson or sabotage may take 
a considerable period of time; it is seldom that the 
saboteur is caught on the spot. 
In the event of explosive sabotage, two primary 
considerations are the preservation of evidence 
and the protection of life and equipment from 
further immediate damage. If a suspected bomb 
has been reported, or even if it has exploded, the 
area should be cleared of all personnel to eliminate 
damage from further possible explosions. In 
addition, all endangered utilities should be cut 
off, portable equipment should be moved, and 
guards posted around the area to prevent access 
by unwary persons and to deny exit to undetected 
and possibly suspect personnel. If an explosion

Approved For Release 2003/12/09 : CIA-RDP85G00105R000100210002-9 
CONFIDENTAProved For ReleapNeT328M91:,Ali-TNE8N,99Ap5 
R000100210002-9 
has occurred, an examination of the area should 
begin at the center of the explosion and move 
outward in enlarging circles in an effort to locate 
fragments or traces of devices which might have 
been used, such as pieces of pipe, portions of tin 
cans, wrappings of cloth, electricians' tape, rope, 
wire, fragments of burned fuse, pieces of detona-
tors, batteries, or clock mechanism. Evidence of 
the type of explosive used may be drawn from the 
condition of objects at the scene, which in turn 
may establish the saboteur's source of supply. 
The placement of the explosive may indicate the 
experience of the saboteur as well as the materials 
and methods used. For these investigations the 
services of an experienced demolitions or explo-
sives expert is e8sential, especially if an unex-
ploded bomb is involved. 
Technical assistance is also required in any in-
vestigation of mechanical sabotage because the 
tools used are usually common to the target area, 
there may be little physical evidence which can 
be studied, and the effects of its repetition on 
production over varying periods of time may not 
be readily apparent. Ascertaining the intent of 
a suspect may be most difficult if the damage is a 
result of mere failure to perform certain necessary 
duties. 
The fact that damage and destruction may be 
caused by the independent saboteur who has no 
connection with a foreign service poses extremely 
difficult problems since such acts will be disorgan-
ized and unrelated. However, as a general rule, 
this type of sabotage is less effective and less dan-
gerous to national security than that which is 
conducted by organized, large scale operating 
groups. Certain weaknesses of such groups com-
bine to assist countersabotage personnel in their 
work and should be considered as important 
guides in tracking down saboteurs. Their opera-
tional program, for example, tends to fall into 
definite patterns. Previous success with partic-
ular methods will usually result in their repetition 
and reduces any initiative to utilize new methods. 
As in the case of espionage agents, communica-
tions between sabotage groups and their superiors 
are a continuing source of weakness, saboteurs may 
become double agents for personal motives, and 
accidental exposure may result from personal 
indiscretions. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
386 
Reduction of Sabotage and Its Effects 
From the countersabotage point of view the 
apprehension and conviction of one saboteur is 
less important than the discovery and destruction 
of the organization of which he is a part. Since 
a study of sabotage incidents usually reveals weak-
nesses in security controls, an important objective 
is the strengthening of those controls and the de-
velopment of new countermeasures to prevent the 
repetition of similar incidents. Those engaged 
in countersabotage activities should ask themselves 
these questions: At what point would a single act 
of sabotage most seriously affect the operations 
of this installation? If I had the mission, as a 
saboteur, to knock out this area what would I con-
sider to be the points of greatest vulnerability? 
The explicit answers to these questions will go far 
toward the reduction of acts of sabotage and their 
total effectiveness. 
C:OUNTERSUBVERSION 
Difficult as are the problems of countering espi-
onage and sabotage, they can be related to specific 
areas of information or to physical targets both 
of which are tangible and capable of identification 
and protection. In countering subversion, how-
ever, Intellige ace is dealing with the intangible 
attempts to capture and manipulate men's minds, 
and there may be no obvious critical point at which 
subversion becomes a clear and present danger. 
Countersubversion, therefore, becomes a study of 
symptoms of subversive thought and action and a 
development of aggressive countermeasures on a 
broad front which must be prosecuted by many 
social, military, and political agencies whose activ-
ities are not always closely coordinated. The suc-
cessful application of countermeasures depends 
in large part on the ability of countersubversion 
personnel to identify accurately preliminary sub-
critical points such as the consolidation of Com-
munist power in various organizations, increasing 
influence over leadership, the tempo and direction 
of propaganda efforts, and the effectiveness of 
agitation as demonstrated by strikes and coordi-
nated group attack on the constitutional order. 
Any discussion of countersubversion must rec-
ognize at the outset the substantive nature of the 
basic problem as well as the fact that its current 
activities are in a period of definition and develop-

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE uO  
ment, as explained in the section on psychological 
operations in the preceding chapter. Countersub-
version must begin with an analytical study of 
Communist activities in every form, and particu-
larly of reputable disclosures of their aims and 
methods of operation. A clear understanding of 
the nature of Communist subversion is also essen-
tial to the development of appropriate counter-
measures which will accomplish their intended 
purpose without becoming repressive and de-
structive of the institutions they are designed to 
protect. This problem was clearly stated by 
former President Truman in a message to the 
Congress in August 1950: 
We face today, as we have always faced in 
time of international tension, the question of 
how to keep our freedom secure against in-
ternal as well as external attack, without at 
the same time unduly limiting individual 
rights and liberties. 
Mr. Truman continued by pointing out that the 
best deterrent to subversion is: 
A vigorous, functioning democracy which 
succeeds in meeting the needs of its people. 
A vigilant people, who exercise their demo-
cratic rights to keep their government active 
in the interests of all, can defeat the efforts of 
Communists to attain electoral power. 
Measures to Counter Subversive Activity 
Measures for countering purposes require: first, 
an identification of specific aims and methods of 
the subversive effort; and second, procedures aimed 
directly at countering them. One double-edged 
Communist objective is to become identified with 
democratic idealism, liberal and reform groups, 
and any dissident elements desiring change, and 
thus to undermine, corrupt, confuse, and destroy 
public confidence in the established constitutional 
order. Once this procedure has been discovered 
and localized, a series of related countermeasures 
must be undertaken to expose this objective and 
destroy it by means of full and accurate informa-
tion disseminated to the particular groups affected. 
The general measure is a program of information 
and education, implemented by other related spe-
cific measures. Truth has always been the surest 
weapon in the long run to defeat secrecy, deceit, 
and evasion, and the practices of communism can-
not withstand the clear view of public observation. 
387 
Indeed, it would appear that the staunchest sup-
porters of the philosophy of communism are those 
who have never lived under its rigid political sys-
tem. This countermeasure of information and 
education might well be implemented by exposure 
of Communist double-talk, specifically Communist 
connotations of democratic terminology to mean 
something entirely different, and the positive iden-
tification of Communists within an infiltrated 
group. 
In employing their organizational method of 
subversion, the Communists of necessity endeavor 
to conceal their bid for power. A countering meas-
ure to this method is the identification and isola-
tion of the organizational targets involved, coupled 
with a mobilization of anti-Communist groups 
within it to expel the subversives. In the case of 
Communist front organizations, means of iden-
tification were suggested by J. Edgar Hoover, 
Director of the FBI, in his testimony before the 
Committee on Un-American Activities in March 
1947: 
There are easy tests to establish the real 
character of such organizations: 
1. Does the group espouse the cause of 
Americanism or the cause of Soviet 
Russia? 
2. Does the organization feature as speakers 
at its meetings known Communists, sym-
pathizers, or fellow travelers? 
3. Does the organization shift when the 
party line shifts? 
4. Does the organization sponsor causes, 
campaigns, literature, petitions, or other 
activities sponsored by the party or other 
front organizations? 
5. Is the organization used as a sounding 
board by or is it endorsed by Communist-
controlled labor unions? 
6. Does the organization receive consistent 
favorable mention in Communist publi-
cations? 
7. Does its literature follow the Commu-
nist line or is it printed by the Commu-
nist press? 
8. Does the organization present itself to be 
nonpartisan yet engage in political ac-
tivities and consistently .advocate causes 
favored by the Communists? 
9. Does the organization denounce Ameri-
can and British foreign policy while al-
ways lauding Soviet policy? 
10. Does the organization utilize Communist 
"double talk" by referring to Soviet-

dominated countries as democracies, 
complaining that the United States is 
imperialistic and constantly denouncing 
monopoly capital? 
11. Have outstanding leaders in public life 
openly renounced affiliation with the or-
ganization? 
12. Does the organization, if espousing lib-
eral progressive causes, attract well-
known honest patriotic liberals or does it 
denounce well-known liberals? 
13. Does the organization have a consistent 
record of supporting the American view-
point over the years? 
14. Does the organization consider matters 
not directly related to its avowed pur-
poses and objectives? 
Supplementary countering measures to further 
isolate the target and to motivate appropriate in-
ternal forces will vary according to the nature of 
the target itself, just as do the methods applied 
by the Communists. Whatever the particular ap-
proach, on the basis of evidence gathered, the basic 
loyalties of reliable members must be stimulated 
into action to set their own house in order and to 
administer their own countersubversion activities. 
Depending upon the seriousness of the circum-
stances, they may find it necessary to resign, or 
possibly to fight to regain control. The impor-
tance of an internal attack on subversive influences 
cannot be overemphasized; countermeasures by 
formal opposition external to the target may result 
in strengthening rather than destroying the power 
of the subversive elements. 
Since an organization's leaders, whether at the 
top or on lower echelons, are expected to maintain 
the established order and to protect the status and 
integrity of the associated membership, their ag-
gregate and individual influence is tremendous. 
In commenting on Communist use of such influ-
ence, J. Edgar Hoover, in his article, How, To 
Fight Communism, written for Newsweek in June 
1947, said: 
. . . in one union with nearly 100,000 mem-
bers, 500 party members were able to control 
the union. Another union with 8,500 mem-
bers sought to free itself from Communist 
control but failed despite the fact that there 
were less than 200 party members in the union. 
In one instance a single Communist by 
clever manipulation at a union convention 
was able to dictate resolutions adopted by 
the convention. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
388 
The radicalism or persistence of leadership will 
sometimes give evidence of its subversive and in-
dicate the degree of crisis within the controlled 
group. Where Communist trained leadership is 
involved, the countermeasures of identification, 
isolation, and in formation may assist in uncover-
ing its deception and deceit. Outright replace-
ment then becomes a countermeasure to be adopted 
internally. In the case of group leaders who have 
become sympathizers and collaborators, guidance 
and reorientation may be a useful countermeasure. 
Appropriate guidance must encourage a self-
clarification by these group leaders of their own 
position and responsibilities and point out actual 
Communist methods used to manipulate other 
leaders for Communist objectives. Supplementary 
countermeasures to strengthen leadership before 
it has been attacked are important from a protec-
tive security point of view. In the modern war 
of subversion there may well be a subtle competi-
tion for power through an unsuspecting leader-
ship; countersubversive measures must be aimed 
toward winning that competition by encouraging 
and strengthening leadership. 
An intermediate subversive method of the Com-
munists is to infiltrate organizations, not for the 
purposes of domination and control, but rather to 
use non-Communist groups as the means for ac-
complishing either general or limited purposes 
external to these groups. Success in this method 
is achieved when Communist aims become iden-
tified and unified with those of non-Communists; 
and the problem becomes one of collaboration. 
Countermeasures for this subversive effort must 
begin with a program of education and informa-
tion, but must be further refined and directed to-
ward the affected group, reorienting some and iso-
lating others. The primary effort, of course, 
should be directed toward the collaborators rather 
than the infiltrators. 
According to Mr. Philip Selznick in his book, 
The Organizational Weapon, an examination of 
Communist strategy in subversive activities will 
reveal that two sources of strengths are, first, the 
historic credibility of Communist doctrines and 
objectives, particularly when associated with the 
growth of the Soviet Union, and second, the estab-
lished constitutional processes of democratic so-
ciety which protect and encourage the rights,

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
privileges, and freedoms of the individual both 
singly and in organized groups. The inevitable 
imperfections of the democratic society are seized 
upon by the Communists who offer in their place 
glittering promises and happy easy solutions. 
Therefore, above and beyond the successful coun-
tering of the specifics of Communist subversion 
there must be a continuing conscientious effort to 
find solutions to troublesome social issues of mod-
ern times. Such solutions can come from the active 
consecrated devotion of a united, informed cit-
izenry to the American way of life. Drawing upon 
their own moral and spiritual strength, Americans 
can, in the words of J. Edgar Hoover, "make our 
democracy so strong and so workable that the 
Communists can never compete with its reality." 
He goes on to say that this can be done without 
any "abridgement of civil liberties." 
This discussion of measures to countersubver-
sion is based in part on and considerably amplified 
by a chapter entitled "Problems of Counter-
offense," in Philip Selznick's The Organizational 
Weapon. 
Techniques in Countersubversion 
All of the techniques already mentioned have 
utility in the field of countersubversion. From 
the naval point of view the orderly processes of 
analysis and recommendations for action are im-
measurably aided by means of comprehensive files, 
special studies, and effective liaison with appro-
priate governmental agencies. Suspect and sum-
mary cards, topical cards, all carefully and 
completely cross indexed, permit the accumulation 
of information and ready reference to any item 
of possible interest. Reference and background 
material on organizations, groups, trends, and 
situations which may have no immediate use often 
provides important clues and gives fuller meaning 
to later developments. Periodic and special 
studies of subversive trends can give warning of 
specific dangers and suggest the use of effective 
techniques and measures. Liaison between the 
various agencies engaging in countersubversion 
activities is extremely valuable in assuring co-
ordination of effort and in pooling information of 
common interest. 
The intricate, diverse, and delicate problems of 
subversion require a full arsenal of countering 
389 
CONFIDENTIAL 
techniques. In considering these problems, to-
gether with those of espionage and sabotage and 
the techniques and measures of countering them, 
it is not inappropriate to suggest that a good coun-
terespionage operator must first be a good spy, 
a good countersabotage agent must first be a good 
saboteur, and good countersubversion personnel 
must first be skilled in the arts of subversion. 
GENERAL SECURITY CONTROL MEASURES 
From the preceding discussion it has become 
increasingly apparent that protective measures 
and devices for classified information, vital equip-
ment, installations, and personnel are essential 
aids for detecting, deterring, or preventing for-
eign-sponsored activities inimical to the best in-
terests of the United States. Such measures and 
devices are called security control measures and 
may be either physical or procedural. Physical 
security control measures have already been enu-
merated; procedural measures include secrecy 
discipline, document security, communications se-
curity, censorship, and personnel security pro-
grams. Just as physical measures are effective 
only when backed up by alert, well-trained guards, 
procedural measures are effective only when en-
forced by all personnel associated with the agencies 
involved, whether military or civilian. There-
fore, while counterintelligence prepares recom-
mended procedures and specific groups are 
assigned to direct their enforcement, the purposes 
of security control measures and the consequences 
of their failure must be completely understood by 
all individuals concerned. This, of course, is a 
matter of specific training and realistic education; 
it is by no means a mere formality. 
Secrecy Discipline is the training of individuals 
to safeguard rigidly and consistently any and all 
classified information or material known to them 
or in their custody; it relates to the dissemination 
of that information or material only to authorized 
persons. The human hazard to security is uni-
versal and perhaps the greatest single vulner-
ability with which counterintelligence must con-
tend. The ignorance, conceit, pride, faith, and 
enthusiasm of individuals become tools in the

INTELLIGENCE FOR 
less boasting arising out of conceit can become an 
excellent source of information through which 
almost any known facts can be gained by the 
patient, encouraging listener. Ignorance either 
of the potential value of specific information or of 
the subtle methods employed by a skilled enemy 
can be highly damaging; while faith and confi-
dence in family or friends have often resulted in 
the ultimate transmission of vital facts. There-
fore, training must both identify and stress the 
importance of classified information and those 
who have need to talk about it must use the utmost 
discretion. The human hazard necessitates strict 
measures in the dissemination of classified infor-
mation: only those who require it should have full 
knowledge; others should be given only limited 
access to the extent needed in their work. The 
basic problem is not one of loyalty so much as the 
hazard inherent to any conversation. 
As an aid to the recognition of important items 
of information or material, appropriate classifica-
tion is assigned to each in the manner described in 
chapter 11 and the procedural methods for han-
dling are indicated by the classification. This 
measure is known as Document Security and 
covers such items as correspondence, reports, 
studies, blueprints, photographs, publications, 
specialized equipment and other significant ma-
terials. The problem is the assignment of a clas-
sification which is appropriate to the items con-
cerned, and the greatest care must be exercised 
to achieve the proper degree of classification. 
Overclassification can become a danger and a haz-
ard in itself, weakening procedures for enforce-
ment as well as the respect of individuals who are 
responsible. Those concerned with document se-
curity may find it helpful to ask themselves the 
question, "Will this information or material be of 
value to an enemy and how valuable may it be ?" 
The importance of effective document security can 
perhaps be more fully appreciated when it is 
remembered that high value is placed on captured 
enemy documents as a source of information. 
Just as the transmission of information by an 
espionage agent represents a point of critical 
vulnerability for him, so likewise it is a vulner-
ability for any military or civilian agency. Signal 
Communications Security, therefore, covering all 
types of electrical transmission, is a vital control

measure for the safeguarding of information by 
means of codes and ciphers and the protection of 
the cryptographic devices or systems employed in 
connection with them. Increasing dependence on 
radio to transmit information between far-flung 
units and their headquarters has increased the pos-
sibilities of interception and hence the importance 
of message security. The encoding of classified 
messages has become customary, with a possible 
exception in time of war when the urgency of the 
information and the fact that an enemy would not 
have time to act upon it permits transmission in 
plain language. 
Censorship, both civil and military, is normally 
a wartime control measure applied to the trans-
mission of information or material by unofficial 
means such as letters, photographs, packages, 
news releases, cable, and radio. From past expe-
rience it has been found that personal correspond-
ence and diaries can be rich sources of information 
to an enemy regarding such matters as the location 
and strength of military units, troop, and ship 
movements, morale, weather conditions, opera-
tional planning, and new weapons, equipment, and 
procedures. From the point of view of military 
censorship, unauthorized disclosures can be re-
duced if not eliminated by successful secrecy dis-
cipline and a clear understanding by all personnel 
of the reasons why censorship is necessary. In this 
way many innocent subterfuges to evade the regu-
lations can be forestalled and the workload light-
ened for those who must enforce them. Censor-
ship not only operates to deny classified informa-
tion to an enemy but also to collect information of 
intelligence value and to detect illegal covert 
enemy operations; therefore, as a source of new 
information it is more than a protective and pre-
ventive measure of security. It is also a valuable 
counterintelligence device for making spot checks 
on suspect individuals and groups and it provides 
a means for intercepting their communications 
and examining them for secret inks or writings. 
It follows, therefore, that censorship personnel 
must be trained and. highly endowed with the qual-
ities of good judgment, discrimination, and 
perspicacity. 
Since the success of all security control meas-
ures, whether physical or procedural, is dependent 
upon the people 'Involved, it follows that Personnel

Secwrity control measures are basic and funda-
mental, for the best training and the most impene-
trable barriers will have little effect if disloyal, 
indiscreet, or emotionally unstable persons hold 
positions where vital material is available. Per-
sonnel security, therefore, must be a comprehensive 
and pervasive measure applied with equal effec-
tiveness from the various levels of government, 
through the military forces, to industry and its 
related services, wherever classified information 
and material are involved. This measure in-
cludes investigation of all individuals holding 
sensitive positions or having access to vital infor-
mation and the issuance of official security clear-
ances, but it should be emphasized that counterin-
telligence is responsible only for the investigative 
aspect. Official clearance is the responsibility of 
the military commander or the head of the Gov-
ernment agency, as the case may be. In reaching 
a decision for security clearance the responsible 
authority must carefully weigh the security risks 
inherent to the position, his own knowledge of the 
applicant, and the facts presented by the investi-
gation. In addition to military personnel and 
employees of various governmental agencies, clear-
ances are required for individuals employed by 
contractors bidding for and carrying out military 
and Government contracts which relate to classi-
fied material. 
The magnitude of the task of agencies responsi-
ble for personnel security is indicated by a report 
of the FBI published in 1952 that over 31/2 million 
loyalty forms were completed in the 5-year period 
following 1947 when the loyalty program of the 
United States Government was undertaken. Dur-
ing the fiscal year 1951-52, the report continues, 
more than 800,000 investigations into the loyalty 
of Government job applicants or employees were 
made. While decisions to issue clearances some-
times present difficult problems requiring the most 
careful judgment, it may be accepted that they 
will not be granted by a military commander to 
individuals whose background investigations re-
veal certain unfavorable facts. Such facts would 
include seditious or treasonable public statements, 
association with foreign agents or acts related to 
sabotage or espionage, affiliation or sympathetic 
association with subversive organizations, a record 
of security violations, an established history of 
391 
serious mental or emotional instability, or positive 
indications of basic weaknesses of character or 
substantial and continued lack of good judgment. 
A successful personnel security program will in-
sure that loyal and discreet people have been em-
ployed to fill all positions related to or concerned 
with classified material; on this basis the possi-
bilities for the success of other security control 
measures will be tremendously increased. 
THE INVESTIGATIVE FUNCTION 
A general discussion of the important function 
of investigation which relates to many types of 
countermeasures involves consideration of the in-
vestigator and the techniques he may use or have 
at his disposal. A number of the special personnel 
attributes already mentioned are applicable of 
course to the general investigator. Others of his 
professional requirements are gained through re-
search, study, and practical experience. Apart 
from specialized forms of interrogation such as 
used in collecting information from prisoners of 
war, most of the counterintelligence techniques 
are related or subordinate to that of investigation. 
The Investigator, His Sources, and Personal 
Qualities 
In their book, Specific Procedures for Investi-
gations in General, Frary and Sullivan summarize 
the qualities of an investigator as follows: 
. . . the foundation upon which a successful 
career in investigation is based comprises com-
mon sense, good judgment, good health, aver-
age mentality, accurate observation, the 
ability to factually report one's observations, 
and the attribute of a well-developed fund 
of general information. If the above are 
present and coupled with the basic qualities 
of any normal, good-living individual such 
as honesty, sincerity, integrity, discretion, 
etc., then the foundation for his training is 
adequate. 
He is neat and well groomed but not conspicuous, 
blending into whatever group he joins. He is 
pleasant, polite but not ingratiating, poised but 
not overbearing. Placing a high value on his 
reputation, he is discreet, avoids gossip, and care-
fully protects the identities of his confidential 
sources. With supple skill, he adjusts his train

and pace of thought to that of the person with 
whom he is dealing, drawing out critical facts 
with apparent casualness and sorting the signifi-
cant from the incidental as he goes. He makes 
certain that he is properly equipped to carry out 
his assignment, including possession of appropri-
ate credentials. 
Before starting a case, the investigator makes a 
thorough analysis of it and all pertinent material 
already assembled; he plans his approach in order 
that his time may be employed to maximum effec-
tiveness. Methodically building his case, he is 
objective in his approach, follows wherever the 
facts lead, and never tries to fit the facts into 
preconceived conclusions. He keeps a careful 
record of progress, aware that the use of a note-
book is his best assurance that all leads have been 
covered, that it will serve to refresh his memory 
if called upon as a witness at a trial, and that it 
may prevent him from falling victim to an un-
scrupulous opponent. In successfully handling 
his assignment, he is materially aided by his accu-
mulated knowledge, by his exploitation of po-
tential sources of information, by his practical 
understanding of human behavior, and by his ca-
pacity for accurate observation and reporting. 
The most easily accessible sources of informa-
tion on individuals, organizations, or incidents 
under investigation are records and files which 
provide original information as well as corrobora-
tion for or explanations of facts already known. 
Public records are available at the local Bureau 
of Vital Statistics, the Registry of Motor Vehicles, 
the Selective Service headquarters, the Police and 
Post Office Departments, public welfare and social 
agencies, Registries of Deeds and of Probate, offices 
of Clerks of Courts, the Veterans' Administration, 
the United States Employment Service, and the 
local offices of the Treasury Department: Customs, 
Immigration, and Naturalization. Public librar-
ies are excellent sources for both general matters 
and specific items of fact such as may be found in 
business and city directories and statistical studies. 
Records of private organizations may also be made 
available on a confidential basis to representatives 
of governmental agencies for official purposes. 
Such records are those of banks, bonding com-
panies, credit investigation agencies, fraternal 
CONFIDENTIAL 
392 
organizations, educational institutions, hotel asso-
ciations, labor unions, hospitals, manufacturing 
and business enterprises, newspapers, telephone 
and t elegr a p h offices, and transportation 
companies. 
People are also valuable sources of information 
about subjects under investigation. In cases in-
volving persons, for example, there are those with 
whom the individual has been associated: club 
members, neighbors, employers, friends, each of 
whom has formed impressions from a variety of 
connections. The investigator will make a particu-
lar effort to cultivate and develop a wide range of 
personal acquaintances who, on the basis of 
f riendly cooperation, will be glad to furnish any 
pertinent available information either voluntarily 
or when asked. Such acquaintances, known as 
contacts or informants, are likely to be most help-
ful and productive of important leads in a case. 
It has been estimated that about 95 percent of all 
crimes are solved by informants?someone who 
saw something, heard something, or experienced 
something he was able and willing to report. Such 
persons are not necessarily in important positions; 
rather they are 'Individuals who for one reason or 
another have opportunities for observing signifi-
cant incidents in ordinary daily life. The news-
dealer and cigar-store proprietor on a busy down-
town intersection meet hundreds of passersby 
daily, become acquainted with many of them, and, 
during the regular course of business, are present 
where happenings of potential interest may tran-
spire. The milkman and the postman in suburban 
areas have excellent opportunities to observe the 
daily lives of those in the communities they serve, 
as do the filling station operator, the barber, the 
hotel waiter, the bellboy, and the bus or trolley 
operator. Secretaries for executives and clerical 
supervisors can also be of invaluable assistance. 
Recognizing the importance of people as sources 
of information, the experienced investigator will 
have a ready knack for making friends and a 
genuine interest in people as individuals. 
The full utilization of personal contacts or in-
formants, as well as the intelligent analysis of the 
individual under investigation, logically requires 
a practical understanding of psychology and hu-
man behavior Such understanding is useful in

forming hypotheses to explain certain actions of 
individuals, in interviewing contacts or interro-
gating suspects, and in drawing out information 
from those who possess knowledge of certain facts. 
Abnormal psychology is a subject of practical 
study. According to Dr. Harry SOderman, one of 
the authors of the authoritative text, Modern 
Criminal Investigation: 
Every good detective should have a general 
knowledge of mental illnesses and constitu-
tional abnormalities of the mind. In the 
course of his investigations he will often meet 
persons whose actions and motives may seem 
puzzling to him if he is not equipped with 
some knowledge of psychiatry . . . 
A knowledge of the signs and symptoms 
tending to prove mental illnesses is, of course, 
necessary. Familiarity with the personality 
make-up of neurotic persons, of epileptics and 
hysterics, should be of particular interest to 
the interrogator, as these conditions often 
affect suspects as well as witnesses. 
An individual who is not insane in. the true 
sense of the word, but who nevertheless shows 
great divergence in character and emotional 
reactions from those of a normal person, may 
be classified as a 'psychopathological person. 
The intelligence of such a person is often quite 
satisfactory and at times highly developed. 
However, it exercises entirely too little control 
over his actions, which, instead, are gener-
ally influenced by compulsive emotional reac-
tions . . . Among these persons we encounter 
many criminals. 
Of the many other practical items of knowl-
edge about human behavior, two merit special men-
tion. The first is the surprising degree of uni-
formity in thoughts and reactions to a common 
situation, in spite of the numberless differences in 
human personality. In The Art of Detection, 
Jacob Fisher points out the source of strength 
which the predictable sameness of human behavior 
represents for the investigator. By way of illus-
tration, he cites the multiple-husband racket car-
ried on by a large number of women during World 
War II in order to obtain dependency allotments 
from their husbands whom they met and married 
just prior to the latters' movement overseas. 
This wartime activity was new to the women 
involved . . . Nevertheless each of thousands 
of women in every part of the United States 
thought up a scheme for some easy money, 
never dreaming that it paralleled almost 
393 
exactly the illegal schemes of thousands of 
other women. 
The second is the wide divergence in the capac-
ities of human beings to observe and report accu-
rately what they see, hear, smell, feel, and taste. 
All knowledge and experience come to the indi-
vidual, of course, through the various sensory 
organs. Since sensory perception is not uniform 
among human beings, it may be expected that sev-
eral reports of a single factual situation will dis-
agree. Furthermore, physical objects and specific 
situations may evoke a variety of responses because 
of past experiences which result in a perceiving 
of things not as they are but as the individual 
thinks they ought to be or in a form in which he 
perceived them on prior occasions. 
This problem of accurate perception is one 
which the investigator must solve in his own case. 
He himself must be able to observe and report 
accurately and be prepared to interpret the factual 
significance of reports received from others. 
Frary and Sullivan, in their book already quoted, 
have this to say: 
. . . there is no phase of investigative work 
which is not dependent completely upon an in-
dividual's ability to observe and describe. 
For example, when an investigator is interro-
gating a subject, interviewing a witness, or 
evaluating an informant's information, he is 
constantly observing that person for the pur-
pose of detecting any indication of falsehood 
or any error in observation; when an investi-
gator is conducting a surveillance it is obvious 
that his powers of observation must be com-
pletely and constantly employed, for it is im-
possible to "shadow" a man and not closely 
observe him. 
Realizing that inaccurate reporting can arise also 
from forgetfulness or an inability to describe what 
has been perceived, the investigator must take 
steps to correct any such personal deficiencies. 
The latter difficulty necessitates careful study in 
order that he may correctly interpret the meaning 
of what he observes. Frequently he is called upon 
to describe individuals, their characteristics, or 
peculiarities in their methods of operations. He 
is expected to reconstruct in detail the physical 
scene of an incident. No less important is his 
ability to recognize when he himself is under 
observation.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Determination of Techniques in Investigation 
The particular techniques employed will depend 
upon the nature of the investigator's case, and his 
plan of attack will he derived from a careful anal-
ysis of the problem. Security investigations, in 
general, concern individuals or situations. The 
former are investigated to determine suitability 
for a security clearance. The latter concerns a 
specific, suspected threat to security or the viola-
tion of a federal law by a person under naval 
jurisdiction. 
A personnel security type investigation is ap-
proached as a general inquiry into an individual's 
background. Ordinarily, at the outset there is no 
suspicion that the subject is a wrongdoer. A per-
sonal history statement provides the starting point 
for an independent inquiry, including checks of 
the various record and file sources already men-
tioned. The collection of data and the scope of 
the investigation depend upon the sensitivity of 
the work to which the individual may be assigned, 
and the investigation is conducted to provide in-
formation for some naval commander for whom 
the individual will be working. 
An investigation into a situation believed to be 
a threat to security is undertaken to develop in-
formation for use by a naval commander in safe-
guarding his command. Usually a particular in-
cident has occurred and is the impetus for the start 
of the investigation which proceeds to collect evi-
dence that will prove or disprove the existence of 
a threat to security. For this type of case, and 
also for the case where the investigator is gather-
ing facts concerning the possible violation of a 
Federal statute, there is an eventual possibility 
that the investigation may result in a legal pro-
ceeding either under the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice or under rules of a civil Federal court. 
Therefore, the investigator not only has the task 
of assembling data for the naval commander con-
cerned, but also he must collect and preserve data 
in accordance with the special requirements posed 
by the rules of legal evidence in order that the 
facts ascertained may be admissible in a formal 
court proceeding. 
Technical Aids and Equipment 
When determining suitable techniques, the in-
vestigator also should be aware of the technical 
CONFIDENTIAL 
394 
equipment and scientific aids available for his use 
or assistance in the development or confirmation 
of information. Electronic equipment, much of 
it portable and easily concealed, permits hearing 
and recording conversations without detection. 
For example, specially designed microphones 
placed against a common wall will amplify con-
versations in an adjoining room sufficiently to be 
heard plainly; such conversations can also be re-
corded. Other equipment will facilitate the survey 
of offices and conference rooms to determine 
whether or not enemy agents have installed de-
vices for broadcasting or recording purposes. 
While equipment has also been perfected for tap-
ping telephone lines, the Federal courts have ruled 
that conversations recorded by such means may 
not be received as evidence. 
In connection with scientific aids, the investi-
gator's responsibility is to understand their capa-
bilities, to be able to explain to the technician the 
information desired, and to know where such aids 
can be obtained to assist him. Because of their 
specialized nature, the general naval investigator 
should rarely attempt to use them himself; rather 
he should make use of equipment and trained per-
sonnel available at the Office of Naval Intelligence 
in Washington, at the District Intelligence Offices, 
and at other specified locations in the field. The 
Physical Security Equipment Agency located in 
Washington maintains equipment for investiga-
tive work and loans it to the Armed Forces. Also, 
through established channels, the technical serv-
ices of the FBI and State police organizations may 
be utilized. While scientific techniques and lab-
oratory examination can provide invaluable as-
sistance in the development of information, it must 
be remembered that they can never replace the 
trained investigator or his personal efforts in lo-
cating and interviewing witnesses, evaluating, and. 
integrating factual evidence. 
Some of the more important forms of scientific 
analysis are microscopy, spectrography, firearm 
identification and ballistics, fingerprint identifi-
cation, document examination, and specialized 
photography. Microscopy, called the bulwark of 
scientific investigations, involves the examination 
of minute particles of physical evidence such as 
paint, dust, soils and minerals, human hair, blood 
and other stains, coal dust, and ashes. Spectrog-

raph,y is the science of measuring the wave length 
of a substance. Every substance has a character-
istic wavelength, which, to a laboratory technician, 
is the equivalent of a fingerprint of that substance. 
Firearm identification and ballistics, utilizing 
comparison miscroscopes and helixometers, pro-
vide a scientific means for determining that a par-
ticular weapon fired a particular missile. Bullets 
and fired cartridge cases are therefore important 
bits of evidence for scientific investigation. 
Exhaustive research has led to the conclusion 
that no two persons have identical fingerprints. 
Therefore, identification by a qualified fingerprint 
examiner is generally accepted as conclusive proof 
of the identity of an individual. The FBI main-
tains an ever-expanding master file of millions of 
sets of fingerprints which it will search upon re-
quest by any proper law-enforcement agency. To 
satisfy the requirements of the FBI for positive 
identification, additional fingerprint cards sub-
mitted for filing are accepted only if there is 
furnished a complete set of suitable impressions 
of all fingers and thumbs. Nevertheless, some-
times single fingerprints may serve as important 
clues in the solution of a crime and the investigator 
should have a general understanding of finger-
print characteristics and procedures for locating 
and preserving them. Subjects analogous to fin-
gerprints include the identification of footprints 
and tire tracks, all of which require special study 
and training on the part of the investigator. 
Document examination is a technical specialty 
in scientific analysis which involves the identifica-
tion of handwriting and typewriting, the use of 
inks, and the analysis of the characteristics and 
age of paper and other writing materials. Pho-
tography has many specialized applications in the 
field of investigation both as to types of equipment 
used and as to the use of photographs as evidence. 
The investigator must be familiar with the capa-
bilities of ultraviolet and infrared photography, 
for example, and understand that to be admissible 
in court, photographs must be inherently truthful 
in what they portray. 
Surveillance 
An important and productive technique in in-
vestigation is surveillance. This consists of ob-
serving a person, a place, or a vehicle for a given 
395 
period of time in order to obtain specific informa-
tion. Illustrative purposes of this technique are: 
to maintain a continuous watch on a particular 
person; to identify all individuals associated with 
the enterprise or activity under investigation; to 
prevent an illegal act or to apprehend the indi-
vidual attempting it; to locate the headquarters 
and meeting places of suspect organizations; to 
determine means of communication employed by 
subversive groups; to obtain factual data about a 
person for later use in interrogation; to check the 
accuracy of reports submitted by informants; to 
locate the hiding places of stolen property or 
contraband. 
Although often producing valuable results, sur-
veillance may be expensive in time, money, man-
power, and equipment required; hence, careful ad-
vance planning is required after a decision has 
been made that the probable results justify the 
effort. Because surveillance can seldom be suc-
cessfully conducted by a single investigator, the 
ABC, or three man team, method is often utilized. 
The basic team positioning is for A to follow 
behind the suspect individual, with B behind A, 
and C abreast and across the street from the sub-
ject. C is thus in a position to signal the subject's 
movements if the latter is lost to the view of A 
and B. This team method permits the frequent 
exchange of positions to minimize risks of detec-
tion and makes possible a continuity of the sur-
veillance even when one of the team is required to 
drop out for any reason. 
This technique has many exacting requirements. 
Each member of a team must have an appropriate 
convincing cover story should he be challenged. 
Signals must be prearranged, together with special 
means of communication with the home office. If 
vehicles are required, it may be desirable to use 
rented cars, changing them as necessary, or to pro-
cure license plates which cannot be traced. Care-
ful study must be made of the geographic area to 
facilitate easy and unobtrusive movement. The 
subject himself must be intensively studied both 
as to his physical characteristics and as to his 
normal daily routine and habits. Depending 
upon the time element, a relief team must be made 
available, capable of taking over smoothly and 
inconspicuously.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
There are an infinite number of problems which 
can develop during a surveillance and only train-
ing and experience can assist in their solution. 
Indicative of the problems are the movements of 
a suspect into buildings, elevators, telephone 
booths, theaters, and buses, trains, or subways. It 
is possible that the suspect will sense the fact that 
he is being followed and deliberately attempt to 
escape, or he may have a second party specifically 
employed to watch for and identify surveillants. 
He may confront the investigator and demand an 
explanation. These hazards may be overcome by 
avoiding direct eye contact with the subject, by 
eliminating signs of recognition between investi-
gators, by training the investigator to be com-
pletely casual and natural. Patience is an out-
standing requirement; the investigator must be 
prepared to walk and to wait for long periods of 
time, sometimes in physical discomforts, always 
observing carefully and taking notes wherever 
possible. The activity of surveillance is both a 
severe physical strain and a stern test of the 
ability to concentrate. 
This technique, however, is only a means to 
an end. Consequently, its results must be evalu-
ated progressively in order to determine its con-
tinuing value or the advisability of shifting to 
another technique which may be more productive 
in the time available. 
The Interview 
The Interview, an indispensable technique 
which plays some part in almost all investiga-
tive work, is a direct method of obtaining infor-
mation. Its rules are based on the assumption that 
the environment is voluntary and that the conver-
sation with the person being interviewed has as its 
purpose the providing of helpful information on 
a particular subject. Whenever possible, the in-
vestigator should plan his approach in advance as 
a time-saving device and to keep control of the 
discussion. However, he should never attempt to 
force the conversation and so prevent the person 
being interviewed from relating in his own way 
all that he knows; nor should be suggest possible 
answers to questions asked. Of importance is an 
accurate appraisal of the person interviewed in 
order to establish a pleasant open atmosphere. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
396 
Courtesy and tact are invaluable attributes. 
Above all, the investigator should suppress per-
sonal feelings of bias or prejudice and maintain an 
objective point of view. It is here that a practical 
knowledge of psychology and a facility for 
friendly directed conversation have special value. 
Interrogation 
The distinction between an interview and an 
interrogation is an important one to make. The 
former involves the questioning of a person who 
is either willing to provide information or at least 
passively neutral in his attitude; the latter con-
cerns a person who is either suspected of an offense 
or unjustifiably is holding information in his pos-
session. The difference becomes a matter of de-
gree, depending upon the intensity of the conver-
sations and the attitude of the subject toward 
providing the desired information. A distinction 
also exists between interrogation of prisoners of 
war and interrogation of persons involved in 
security and criminal investigations. 
Usually, the technique of interrogation is one 
of the last to be used in connection with investi-
gation because its effectiveness often depends upon 
the prior collection, by other techniques, of suffi-
cient data to give the interrogator leads for ques-
tions and facts to verify statements made. Inter-
rogation also may result in admissions by the sus-
pect, followed by a full confession first given 
orally and then reduced to writing. 
Criminal interrogation calls for a high degree 
of skill, a wide experience, and a keen insight into 
human personality. Well done, the interrogation 
often can provide a solution to the investigation; 
prematurely attempted or ineptly handled, it can 
result only in the recalcitrance of the subject and 
a dissipation of the strength of psychological fac-
tors involved. Interrogation is a technique which 
requires detailed study and should be undertaken 
only by specially trained personnel when its 
employment seems justified. 
In his practical book, Lie Detection and Crim-
inal Interrogation, Fred E. Inbau stresses the im-
portance of the environment for the interrogation 
and the approach of the interrogator who must 
make proper utilization of principles of psychol-
ogy. A suitable and strictly private room for

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE uuNrIDENTIAL 
interrogation with no more than one or two inter-
rogators present is essential because of the fact 
that people instinctively are sensitive about speak-
ing frankly of their actions and motivations in the 
presence of a, group of observers. The room itself 
should contain no distracting features such as 
pictures or wall decorations; however, it should be 
equipped with concealed recording equipment and 
a one-way mirror through which an observer can 
follow the proceedings and corroborate them if 
required. An interrogation should never be con-
ducted in a location where the subject feels confi-
dent or superior, such as his own home. 
The particular approach of the interrogator 
will, of course, depend upon the data he already 
has assembled and the personality of the suspect. 
In general, according to Inbau, the suspect must 
be convinced that the interrogator is merely seek-
ing the truth and in no way relentlessly attempt-
ing to force a confession. Based on this objective, 
the language used should be easily understand-
able; harsh, uncompromising words should be 
avoided. For example, "kill," "steal," and "con-
fess" should be replaced by "shoot," "take," and 
"tell the truth." At the outset, it is often desir-
able to ask non-sensitive, routine questions as a 
means of conditioning the subject to answering 
and to his surroundings This procedure also en-
ables the interrogator to size up the suspect and 
to determine the best approach to the critical 
phase of the interrogation. 
When the guilt of the person involved is rea-
sonably certain and the primary purpose of the 
interrogation is to obtain an incriminating admis-
sion or a full confession, the interrogator may 
adopt an attitude of sympathetic understanding 
if the suspect shows feelings of genuine remorse 
or mental anguish. On the other hand, for those 
who have no such feelings, the practical, cards-
on-the-table approach may be more suitable in 
order to show the subject that other evidence of 
guilt exists. If guilt is doubtful or uncertain, the 
interrogator must, in the words of Inbau, "feel 
his way around," seeking to detect deception and 
searching for positive clues of guilt or innocence. 
Such clues may be derived from inconsistent state-
ments, signs of physical uneasiness, inadequate 
explanations, and attempts to lie. 
397 
The Polygraph 
Properly associated with the topic of technical 
equipment, the polygraph or lie detector is men-
tioned at this point because of its frequent use in 
connection with interrogation as a means of dis-
covering deception. This instrument records and 
measures the physiological changes induced in an 
individual by his emotional response, usually in-
voluntary, to questions addressed to him. Rela-
tive changes in blood pressure, rapidity and ampli-
tude of pulse, variations of the respiratory pat-
tern, and minute changes in the conductivity of 
the skin are detected and recorded on graphs. 
While the operation of the physical equipment is 
relatively simple, the interpretation of the result-
ing charts is highly technical, requiring not only 
specialized training and extensive experience, but 
also complete integrity on the part of the tech-
nician. The Careless, over-anxious operator who 
attempts to prove more than the equipment is 
capable of proving can produce interpretations 
and reach conclusions which are completely un-
warranted. 
The investigator, therefore, must be aware of 
the capabilities and limitations of the polygraph 
and recognize that its results are dependent upon 
the skill and ability of the operator. Based upon 
the experience of the scientific crime detection 
laboratory at Northwestern University, it has been 
estimated that out of every 100 subjects tested, a 
competent polygraph examiner can make an accu-
rate and definite diagnosis for about 75 to 80. The 
chief source of error is a failure to detect decep-
tion by a guilty person rather than the misinter-
pretation of the record of one who is innocent. 
Properly used, the polygraph makes possible 
greater accuracy in the detection of deception and 
has a decided psychological effect in inducing 
guilty persons to confess. At times this equip-
ment can be employed as an initial technique in 
investigations involving several suspects. By such 
means it is often possible to eliminate the inno-
cent, with a considerable saving in total time in-
volved in the solution of a case. 
Legal Evidence 
In any investigation which may result in court 
action, the investigator is responsible for obtain-
ing and protecting available physical evidence,

INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
and for demonstrating a continuous chain of pos-
session through the hands of any and all of its 
custodians. Knowledge relating to the admissi-
bility or inadmissibility of data as legal evidence 
is also essential to avoid the dismissal of a case 
on technical grounds. While a detailed discussion 
of this subject is beyond the scope of this chapter, 
it should be pointed out that the Manual for 
Courts-Martial United States 1951, its Naval Sup-
plement, and the Uniform Code of Military Jus-
tice are basic materials with which the investi-
gator in the armed services must be familiar. 
One procedural requirement which these publi-
cations impose upon the conduct of interviews and 
interrogations is initial advice to the individual 
of his legal rights. Article 31 of the Code provides 
against compulsory self-incrimination and also 
states: 
No persons subject to this code shall inter-
rogate, or request any statement from, an 
accused or a person suspected of an offense 
without first informing him of the nature of 
the accusation and advising him that he does 
not have to make any statement regarding the 
offense of which he is accused or suspected 
and that any statement made by him may be 
used as evidence against him in a trial by 
court-martial. 
On this basis, the Office of Naval Intelligence re-
quires that a written confession include the state-
ment that the signer was initially informed of his 
rights, wherever he will agree to do so. 
Formal Report 
An accurate, objective formal report is the con-
cluding phase of the investigator's field work on 
a particular case. In the armed services this report 
is particularly important because the military 
commander as the action officer responsible for 
the security of his command must rely upon the 
investigation report as his primary source of in-
formation upon which to predicate his action. For 
this reason, the qualities of clarity, completeness, 
and impartiality in presentation are essential. 
The reporting responsibility of the investigator is 
exacting and challenging. 
In many instances the formal report will involve 
the careful coordination of preliminary investiga-
tive reports prepared by a number of contributing 
naval agencies, particularly the District Intelli-
CONFIDENTIAL 
398 
gence Offices, for investigative leads may be de-
veloped in several geographic areas. 
Investigations of all varieties absorb much of 
the time and energies of the counterintelligence 
organization. Their problems will often challenge 
the ingenuity of the investigator, but most of the 
work is routine, requiring careful attention to. 
minute detail. However, for the investigator there 
is a reward in the form of deep personal satisfac-
tion when the "tough case" is broken through his 
skill, imagination, and industry. 
NAVAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION 
While the Security Branch of the Office of Naval 
Intelligence is the center of counterintelligence 
activity within the Department of the Navy, a 
number of other offices and agencies of necessity 
play a significant part in the total effort. For 
example, in the collection of information the Se-
curity Branch relies heavily upon the District 
Intelligence Offices, naval attaches, fleet units, and 
other governmental intelligence producing agen-
cies, both foreign and domestic. Likewise, in con-
nection with security control measures, its function 
is that of disseminating intelligence since correc-
tive action to be taken is a responsibility of com-
mand. Communications security is a primary 
responsibility of the Director of Naval Communi-
cations although there is close mutual support in 
activities of common interest. Similar cooperation 
takes place in connection with national internal 
security which is a responsibility of the Depart-
ment of Justice and in contractor personnel secu-
rity which involves a number of departments of 
the executive branch of the Federal government. 
Thus it can be seen that collaboration, coordina-
tion, and liaison are essential to the successful 
operation of the Security Branch. 
From the counterintelligence point of view, the 
functions of the Security Branch include: 
1. The production for appropriate dissemina-
tion of intelligence to warn of and to aid in 
countering threats of espionage, sabotage, 
and subversion, particularly as they may af-
fect the Naval Establishment. 
2. The administration and utilization of coun-
terintelligence techniques, particularly in-
vestigation.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
3. The formulation of policy concerning secu-
rity control measures, including the clear-
ance of classified information to foreign 
agencies and participation in the application 
of censorship and commerce and travel con-
trol. 
4. The coordination of the naval effort with 
that of other counterintelligence agencies. 
The importance of the coordinating function 
has been emphasized by the subversive character-
istics of the cold war and the worldwide locations 
of naval units and activities which have tremen-
dously expanded the scope of the interests of the 
Security Branch. The functions of the Branch 
are delegated and distributed among the follow-
ing sections: S. E. C. (Sabotage, Espionage, and 
Countersubversion) , Investigations, Security Pol-
icy, Security Control, Censorship, and Commerce 
and Travel, the latter two being fully acti-
vated only in time of war. It should be noted 
that a number of these sections have functions and 
responsibilities which are not directly related to 
counterintelligence. In considering the matter of 
organization, it should further be remembered 
that changes occur from time to time as needs 
and emphasis shift, so that the important con-
siderations are the functions performed in sup-
porting the broad mission of producing intelli-
gence for the protection and security of the Naval 
Establishment. In any event, the activities of 
the various sections are closely related and con-
tinuing mutual assistance insures integration of 
effort. 
The S. E. C. Section is a research and evalua-
tion unit, responsible for the analysis of informa-
tion and the dissemination of the resultant intelli-
gence to appropriate naval authorities for use in 
planning and executing effective counter and pro-
tective measures. Because of the pervasive nature 
of counterintelligence itself, this dissemination 
may include not only naval activities but also other 
government agencies. The section's interests are 
worldwide. Like a headquarters staff, it corre-
lates information received from a wide variety of 
sources, and while it must call upon other activi-
ties for the collection of specific information de-
sired, it is not limited geographically in its col-
lection effort. From a mass of raw material, it 
must extract significant items, evaluate them, and 
399 
disseminate them in usable form. Its research 
subjects include personnel, techniques, finances, 
communications, situations, trends, and objectives 
of subversive and covert foreign and domestic or-
ganizations. While much of this research is of a 
long-term nature, designed to produce detailed 
studies of value to many branches of the Depart-
ment of the Navy and other government agencies, 
the section must remain alert for any significant 
single items which, when interpreted, indicate 
some new threat or trend, or possibly a new ap-
proach by a subversive activity, requiring prompt 
dissemination to the appropriate action agency. 
Close liaison with Army and Air Force Intelli-
gence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the 
Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of 
State, the Treasury Department, and other agen-
cies of the government permits a, valuable inter-
change of information of mutual interest and 
benefit. Other sources of information include do-
mestic and foreign newspapers and periodicals and 
transcripts of foreign radio news broadcasts. 
During World War IT the various intelligence and 
interrogation reports from United States and Al-
lied forces abroad were useful sources. With the 
approval of competent authority, information is 
also exchanged with agencies of friendly foreign 
governments. In its collection and evaluation 
effort, the section is materially aided by the In-
telligence Branch of ONI and the District Intelli-
gence Offices. Internally, it is organized on the 
basis of major topical interests. 
Illustrative of the inter-relations within the 
Security Branch, the S. E. C. section receives much 
routine information regarding individuals and sit-
uations from other sections; on the other hand, in 
connection with security matters, it may provide 
the investigations section with an evaluation of 
information developed in the course of an investi-
gation of a suspect or prospective employee. In 
addition, it may be able to advise the Security 
Control Section that one of the members of an 
official foreign mission requesting clearance for 
an official inspection is a known or suspected enemy 
agent. In time of war, the closest relationships 
are maintained with the Censorship section in or-
der to identify foreign agents, their contacts, and 
their means of finance and communications.

CONFIDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NAVAL OFFICERS 
Closely associated with S. E. C. is the Investiga-
tions Section which provides the Navy with per-
sonnel trained in specialized counterintelligence 
techniques. The counterintelligence function of 
this section is to develop information regarding al-
leged or suspected espionage, sabotage, and sub-
versive activities on the part of naval personnel, 
uniformed or civilian. In addition, it is the offi-
cially designated investigative service for the Na-
val Establishment and makes investigations not 
immediately related to counterintelligence. These 
are conducted when specifically requested by com-
petent naval authority. Such investigations in-
clude matters involving naval contractors, war 
frauds, and personnel misconduct or disciplinary 
cases. 
Contractors' investigations may be required be-
fore the material bureaus of the Navy Department 
enter into contractual relationships with private 
concerns. When, in the interest of the security 
of classified naval equipment or information, the 
Chief of a Bureau deems it necessary to have facts 
about the general corporate structure of a con-
tractor, its financial responsibility, ability to pro-
duce, integrity of management, and especially any 
possible foreign affiliations, ONI is requested to 
obtain the essential information. Based on the 
facts developed, the responsible bureau authority 
can then make his decision regarding the placing 
of the contract. These facts also contribute to 
decisions concerning appropriate security controls 
that should apply to classified work in progress. 
Requests for war fraud investigations arise out 
of the belief of a commanding officer that naval 
personnel, military or civilian, are involved in 
defrauding the government in connection with a 
naval contract or by the unauthorized use or dis-
position of naval supplies or equipment. If evi-
dence of fraud is developed, the case is referred to 
the Department of Justice and, at the same time, 
the commanding officer is advised of the facts so 
that he can take such action as he desires to protect 
the Navy from further harm. Since the Investi-
gations Section provides the designated investiga-
tive service for the Navy, its trained agents are 
called upon to determine the facts pertaining to 
misconduct and breaches of discipline so that com-
manding officers can fix responsibility and better 
determine appropriate punishment. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Because of the diversity of its activities, this 
section is closely associated with most phases of 
intelligence operations as well as with a large 
number of the naval commands and other offices 
and bureaus of the Navy Department. While some 
of its work is not immediately of a counterintelli-
gence nature, the greater part has some bearing on 
security measures, and sometimes seemingly un-
related cases are productive of information of 
direct counterintelligence value. 
It must be kept in mind that this section, in 
gathering data on an investigation, is serving only 
as a fact-finding agency. Completed investiga-
tions are referred to the requesting authority for 
such administrative action as he, in his best judg-
ment, believes to be necessary on the basis of the 
facts presented. In order to protect sources of 
information from compromise or disclosure, all 
investigative reports are classified Confidential or 
higher; recipients, therefore, must safeguard them 
carefully and not disclose sources therein. In no 
case is the subject of a report to be advised of its 
existence or permitted to see it. 
The Security Branch has Navy-wide responsi-
bility for originating or approving the promulga-
tion of all policies relating to the safeguarding of 
classified naval information, as well as administer-
ing such policies. The Assistant to the Branch 
Head (Security Policy) originates, approves, and 
reviews policy and prepares for promulgation by 
the Chief of Naval Operations specific directives 
on such subjects as classification and security meas-
ures, the disclosure of naval information, the tak-
ing of photographs, the release of information on 
new ship construction or conversion, and visits 
to naval activities and installations. While direc-
tives on physical security are prepared by the Base 
Maintenance Division, Office of the Chief of Naval 
Operations, the branch functions in an advisory 
and consultative capacity. 
The Security Control Section administers and 
executes various security policies and programs. 
This involves a wide range of activity, a diversity 
of responsibilities, and the exercise of the most 
discriminating judgment. In its work this section 
is assisted by qualified representatives from the 
various technical bureaus and offices, the State 
Department, and Army and Air Force Intelli-
gence. Included in its responsibilities is the re-

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
lease of classified information to individuals and 
organizations for private use, to industry manu-
facturing items of naval interest for foreign gov-
ernments, and to official representatives of foreign 
governments. Generally speaking, classified in-
formation is not released for private use except 
when so doing serves the interests of the Navy. 
For example, it may be necessary, on occasion, to 
provide merchant vessels or civilian aircraft with 
classified Hydrographic Office information. 
Releases to foreign governments are usually gov-
erned by high level policy decisions and by special 
circumstances within the purview of the Navy's 
technical bureaus and the Intelligence Branch of 
ONI. Visits of foreigners to naval activities, 
commercial plants and private institutions en-
gaged in classified work for the Navy require 
clearance and the issue of proper credentials. 
Security liaison with the Office of Public Informa-
tion of the Navy Department entails review of 
articles, reports, and pictures to determine whether 
or not the subject matter may be released in con-
formance with established policy. Another task 
is that of the prevention and correction of security 
violations by naval personnel which sometimes 
occur in the preparations, handling, and marking 
of correspondence. Much more serious is the loss 
or compromise of classified matter. In such cases, 
as required by Navy Regulations, a local investiga-
tion of the circumstances is made and a report for-
warded to CNO. Each report is reviewed to de-
termine whether the investigation has been ade-
quate, and it is then transmitted to the interested 
offices of the Navy Department for information 
and, when disciplinary action is indicated, to the 
Bureau of Naval Personnel. 
Since classified information is originated and 
handled by all naval activities, an important func-
tion of the Security Branch is the integration of 
procedures, the coordination of assignment of 
classifications, and timely declassification. Ad-
vice to naval commands regarding security consid-
erations and coordination with other agencies is a 
continuing responsibility. 
When activated in time of war, the Censorship 
Section is responsible for preparing basic regu-
lations for naval censors, maintaining liaison with 
all other censorship organizations, and acting as a 
clearing house for such administrative matters 
401 
as violations, proposed changes in regulations, 
and general inquiries. Since naval censorship is 
a function of command, officers are designated to 
serve as censors for every naval vessel, base, and 
activity, and special instructions in addition to 
basic regulations may be prepared with the ap-
proval of ONI. As appropriate, special reports 
are submitted by individual censors through the 
chain of command to the Censorship section. 
Such reports may be summaries of information of 
a subversive nature, indications of leaks, or evi-
dence of an unusual interest in classified naval in-
formation. The questionable correspondence may 
be forwarded with the report. A basic problem of 
censorship is the exercise of good judgment and 
common sense in the treatment of private cor-
respondence, the forwarding of photographs, the 
transfer of personal funds, and the clearance 
through customs of officers (not official couriers) 
carrying official Navy documents. 
Associated with this section in wartime is the 
Telecommunications Unit which provides trained 
officers for cable and radio censorship. The Navy, 
with its responsibility for the safe overseas move-
ment of merchant ships and strategic materials, 
is vitally interested in safeguarding movement in-
formation transmitted over commercial or private 
circuits. Personnel selected for this work usually 
possess a background of experience in trade, 
finance, industry, and communications. The de-
fensive function of this activity is to prevent the 
transmittal of information of military, economic, 
or political value to an enemy, such as production 
data, new devices, general shipping information, 
and movements of materials, supplies, or person-
nel. Offensively, this activity can detect enemy 
covert operations by intercepting agent reports, 
transmittal of funds, propaganda, and requests 
for special information; even more, it can assist 
in thwarting espionage, sabotage, and subversive 
operations. In this area, the coordination of naval 
security interests with those of other agencies is 
most important. During World War II this unit 
and its personnel were transferred to the Cable 
and Radio Division of National Censorship. 
Also active in wartime, the Commerce and 
Travel Section functions to prevent the unau-
thorized transmission of classified information 
through merchant shipping, crews, travelers, over-

seas commercial aircraft, and maritime personnel; 
it assists in the control of persons attempting to 
enter or leave United States controlled areas whose 
activities might constitute a danger to the security 
of the Naval Establishment. Worldwide in 
scope, the responsibilities of this section are cen-
tered around the boarding of merchant ships, the 
preparing of advisory information for individual 
travel authorizations and inspection of travelers, 
the making of special studies, and cooperative 
liaison with other agencies engaged in the con-
trol of travel and commerce. While this section 
operates primarily to establish and maintain 
security barriers against the illegal movement of 
classified information and personnel engaged in 
espionage, sabotage, or subversive activities, it also 
collects a large volume of information for a variety 
of intelligence purposes. During peacetime, the 
functions of this section are performed by estab-
lished civil federal agencies; even in wartime, 
these civil agencies retain primary responsibility 
and the Security Branch of ONI acts in a sup-
plementary and advisory capacity in areas of par-
ticular concern to the Navy. When active, the 
Commerce and Travel Control Section initiates 
policies and supervises the field work performed 
by the District Intelligence Offices and related to 
its mission. 
The primary counterintelligence purpose for 
boarding ships and aircraft entering or leaving 
United States controlled ports is to ascertain that 
no classified information is hidden in the ship, 
cargo, or on the persons of travelers and crew 
members and to insure that proper security meas-
ures are maintained in the handling of shipping 
information and classified cargo assigned to over-
seas areas. Leakage of important information 
can occur from the careless use of bills of lading, 
marine insurance policies, and cargo manifests; 
likewise, merchant seamen and waterfront work-
ers can make valuable observations of merchant 
ships and cargoes. A second purpose is to obtain 
by means of interview any pertinent information 
possessed by merchant marine officers, crew mem-
bers, travelers, and Armed Guard personnel. Sur-
vivors of enemy attacks on shipping are sources 
of information not only of immediate operational 
value but also of salient details regarding the 
attack: the circumstances, enemy units involved, 
CONFIDENTIAL 
402 
names of other survivors or known dead or miss-
ing, and the status of classified publications 
aboard. 
Travel authorization is basically a responsibility 
of the State Department, while travel inspection 
rests with agencies of the Treasury and Justice 
Departments: United States Customs and the Im-
migration and Naturalization Service. The ONI 
Commerce and Travel Section works with these 
agencies in a cooperative and advisory capacity 
in matters relating to naval security. The check-
ing of passenger and crew lists in advance of the 
arrival or departure of a merchant ship or com-
mercial plane is a valuable means for enforcing 
security control measures, and promptness in 
processing and dissemination of resulting infor-
mation is imperative. The preparation of special 
studies of trends and situations by this section 
serves to guide and stimulate the activities of the 
field units. The closest liaison, effective at all 
levels of operation, must be maintained with other 
military agencies, the Passport and Visa divisions 
of the State Department, the Bureau of Customs 
and Internal Revenue of the Treasury Depart-
ment, the FBI and the Immigration and Naturali-
zation Service of the Justice Department, the 
Office of International Trade of the Commerce 
Department, the Civil Aeronautics Administra-
tion, the Maritime Commission, and other federal 
and state agencies, not to mention a variety of 
private agencies and companies. Particularly 
close relationships exist with the Coast Guard 
which has primary responsibilities for port se-
curity and the clearance of merchant seamen. 
As already indicated in this review of the Navy's 
counterintelligence organization, the sections of 
the Security Branch both support and are sup-
ported by field activities, notably the District In-
telligence Offices. While the responsibilities of 
these offices are localized within their districts, 
they are no less important and usually are inter-
related not only from district to district and to the 
Security Branch, but also to the field activities 
of other governmental agencies. It is imperative, 
therefore, that all current information regarding 
counterintelligence matters be available in the 
DIO's and that these offices be manned by person-
nel trained in the various security techniques and 
procedures. The requirements and capabilities of

these offices will naturally vary according to their 
geographical area of responsibility; in any event, 
they must be prepared to support effectively all 
pertinent countermeasures if the Naval Establish-
ment and the nation are to be protected success-
fully against espionage, sabotage, and subversive 
activities. 
In chapter 3 the counterintelligence organiza-
tions of the Army and the Air Force were identi-
fied; it is sufficient to indicate here that their 
functions and responsibilities within their respec-
tive services are similar to those of the Security 
Branch of ONI. The counterintelligence activ-
ities and responsibilities of all the military serv-
ices are carefully defined by the Delimitation 
Agreement and integrated with those of the FBI 
which has primary responsibility for the internal 
security of the United States. 
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE IN A THEATER OF 
MILITARY OPERATIONS 
While basic counterintelligence problems and 
objectives in a theater of operations are not essen-
tially different from those already discussed, the 
urgency of operating conditions gives special em-
phasis to the time element and the nature of mili-
tary combat both requires and permits the use of 
special countermeasures and techniques in addi-
tion to those already described. The extent and 
character of counterintelligence activities are 
conditioned by the particular theater of operations 
and such factors as population density, composi-
tion and cultural characteristics of the people, 
their attitude toward friendly and enemy forces, 
their susceptibility to enemy penetration and 
propaganda, and the stability of local govern-
ments. 
In a theater of operations the information tar-
gets of enemy intelligence are concentrated within 
the field of armed forces intelligence knowledge 
described in chapter 5, with emphasis on capabil-
ities and vulnerabilities. Recognizing these prob-
able targets, the intelligence officer has a number 
of counterintelligence responsibilities, such as the 
planning of effective protective countermeasures 
and the neutralization of hostile intelligence oper-
ations. In coordination with other staff sections, 
he will plan measures and procedures for deceiving 
the enemy. Counter propaganda may be his 
403 
sphere of responsibility, as well as censorship and 
the initiation of investigations as required. In 
general, counterintelligence operations in the thea-
ter are grouped into five categories: military secu-
rity; civil security; port, frontier, and travel 
security; censorship; and special operations. 
Special operations may include problems of 
camouflage and concealment of installations, 
either to mask their true identity or to conceal 
them from observation completely. The intelli-
gence officer may also supply valuable knowledge 
in the planning of deceptive measures such as 
feints, secondary landings, demonstrations, and 
false concentrations. The success of deception 
depends upon a maximum of realism in execution 
and complete security of information. 
In combat areas, counterintelligence personnel 
are responsible for or assist in locating evacuated 
enemy headquarters, billeting areas, supply depots 
and similar installations and searching them for 
documents and other material of possible interest. 
Other sources of potential value are offices for-
merly occupied by enemy intelligence services, 
enemy police organizations, local semimilitary 
organizations, civil government centers, signal 
communications and broadcasting centers, and 
known collaboration groups. Mail at enemy post-
offices should be impounded pending the arrival 
of designated censors. Important personnel tar-
gets are known or suspected enemy agents, col-
laborators, and sympathizers, whose identity and 
location may be facilitated by contact with local 
officials and other persons known to be friendly 
to our forces. On the other hand, installations 
evacuated by our own forces must be inspected 
to ensure that no material of intelligence value to 
the enemy has been left behind. 
Prior to the establishment of Controls by Civil 
Affairs or Military Government units in areas re-
covered from an enemy, counterintelligence per-
sonnel cooperate with military commanders and 
police units in preparing security regulations, pro-
mulgating instructions, and restoring law and 
order. Frequent checks must be made to ascertain 
the effectiveness of measures taken, and informant 
networks must be established. Since security con-
trols over a civil population become the responsi-
bility of Civil Affairs-Military Government units, 
the closest relationships must be maintained with

them for they normally serve as the channel for 
dealings with civilians in a military zone. Coun-
terintelligence personnel often continue to assist 
in such matters as locating and confiscating hidden 
arms and the conduct of security investigations. 
As a general principle in the wake of battle, the 
security of military interests has priority over the 
welfare and convenience of the civilian population 
in a theater of operations. 
Counterintelligence Estimates and Plans 
From the foregoing it is apparent that advance 
planning is essential, in order that the intelligence 
officer may carry out his counterintelligence re-
sponsibilities successfully. An early requirement 
is an estimate of enemy intelligence capabilities, 
based upon available knowledge of the enemy's 
overt and covert intelligence agencies, including 
organization, training, equipment, doctrine, tech-
niques, and disposition. Such an estimate should 
include a critical analysis of our own counter-
intelligence deficiencies. This careful study will 
indicate additional knowledge required, improve-
ments to effect, and the measures which will be 
most advantageous in countering the enemy's in-
telligence effort. This estimative process for 
counterintelligence is only a subsidiary phase of 
the total process involved in preparing the In-
telligence Estimate discussed in chapter 12. 
However, the Intelligence Estimate form itself 
can be utilized as a general guide for the intelli-
gence officer as he analyzes his counterintelligence 
problems and considers appropriate countermeas-
ures. The Department of the Army Field Manual 
30-5, entitled Combat Intelligence, recommends 
the revision of the estimate form to include the 
following topics as appropriate: 
a. Collection of Information. 
1. Overt methods. 
(a) Reconnaissance, ground and air, 
including photo. 
(b) Communication intelligence. 
(c) Prisoners of war, deserters, and 
refugees. 
(d) Captured documents, including 
maps, orders, and letters. 
(e) Interception of radio and tele-
vision broadcasts. 
(f) Interrogation of captured secret 
agents. 
2. Covert methods. Espionage, all types. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
404 
NAVAL OFFICERS 
b. Sabotage. 
1. Military. 
2. Political. 
3. Economic and industrial. 
c. Guerrilla Warfare. 
1. Semimilitary operations. 
2. Minor armed uprisings. 
d. Underground. 
1. Political and refugee. 
2. Escape and Evasion. 
3. Criminal. 
e. Assassination and Abduction. 
1. Military and political leaders. 
2. Personnel performing critical duties. 
f. Unfriendly Nations. Miscellaneous activi-
ties. 
g. Analysis of our own and allied counter-
intelligence deficiencies. 
The particular form used is not important. 
What is essential is that appropriate measures to 
counter each enemy capability be devised and as-
signed to various units of the command. 
The intelligence officer should maintain for his 
own use a composite record in order to make cer-
tain that he has considered all possible enemy in-
telligence operations, planned for the necessary 
countermeasures, and recommended execution by 
the appropriate agencies. This record may also 
contain notations amplifying the planned counter-
measures for further dissemination to the action 
agencies; it may indicate additional information 
to be collected and reported according to a time 
schedule. The results of this study and planning 
are incorporated into the intelligence annex to 
an operation order, described in chapter 12. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
It is hoped that this study has served to give 
greater understanding of intelligence work and 
the milieu in which it operates in war and peace. 
This text is not intended to be complete in its 
coverage of the subject matter but rather only 
introductory. Of necessity intelligence impinges 
on many aspects of human life. It deals with the 
realities of existence and the interrelationships of 
groups of people who have formed themselves into 
powerful states. Inevitably, any study of intelli-
gence becomes historically dated, and while this 
text has endeavored to project ideas beyond the 
present, the viewpoint is that of early 1953.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CONFIDENTIAL 
Intelligence has been described as organization, 
as knowledge, and as a producing activity. Only 
by the coordinated effort of many contributing 
agencies and personnel at all echelons can intelli-
gence be produced to meet the needs of a nation 
and its armed forces. By tracing the historical 
development of intelligence, valuable lessons have 
been pointed out as guides for the present and the 
future. In considering functions of intelligence 
in the formulation of the strategy and tactics of 
world states, a proper perspective for intelligence 
personnel has been suggested. 
As an area of human knowledge, intelligence 
specifically deals with foreign nations and geo-
graphic areas of potential operations. It helps 
to answer questions of both a strategic and opera-
tional nature. Its component parts have been de-
scribed as geographic, transportation and telecom-
munications, sociological, political, economic, 
armed forces, scientific and technical, and bio-
graphical. Because of their current interest to 
the United States, World Communism and the 
U. S. S. R. have been given more detailed 
consideration. 
The processes whereby information is converted 
into intelligence have been shown as an unending 
cycle within which is collection, processing, and 
dissemination. Use by planners and operational 
commanders sparks new requests for collection, 
while throughout the cycle, guidance controls and 
channels the various phases of activity. The in-
telligence cycle is practically applied by the in-
telligence section of a naval staff in its support of 
the naval commander as he makes his decisions 
and supervises his planned action. It has con-
tinuing practical application in the support given 
by intelligence to all types of naval operations in-
cluding air, surface forces, submarines, and joint 
and combined operations including amphibious. 
It is at work in the intelligence support of special 
activities such as atomic warfare, economic war-
fare, psychological warfare, and guerrilla and 
partisan operations. 
All of these aspects of intelligence?organiza-
tion, knowledge, and activity?find special and 
concentrated application in counterintelligence 
which is directed against hostile intelligence or-
ganizations and their activities threatening the 
welfare and security of the nation. 
405 
While Naval Intelligence is the primary consid-
eration of this text, it has been necessary to deal 
with the general field of intelligence, because only 
by so doing can the purposes, responsibilities, re-
lationships, and contributions of Naval Intelli-
gence have real meaning. 
THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE 
Those assigned to intelligence duties can some-
times become overenthusiastic as they consider 
the potentialities of their activities. On the other 
hand, those unacquainted with the capabilities of 
intelligence, or familiar only with its limitations, 
can find few values comparable to the hardware 
of war. There is, of course, a middle ground 
where realistic appraisal and appreciation meet. 
Knowledge and understanding will lead to the 
recognition that intelligence can make very real 
contributions, but that it can predict the future 
only within the limits of the social sciences which 
aid in its production. Insofar as facts can be 
collected, intelligence can at least produce reason-
ably accurate estimates of capabilities and, at cer-
tain levels, give sufficient indications of intentions 
to alert action agencies to possible dangers and 
threats. 
Intelligence is not an end in itself, but only a 
means to an end which can be constantly used to 
effective advantage by both civilian and military 
leaders as they formulate and implement the grand 
strategy of the nation. As a staff function intelli-
gence is an integral part of command and never 
an independent activity. 
Intelligence activities, carefully planned and 
wisely guided, have been demonstrated histori-
cally to be a profitable investment that will more 
than repay the cost in manpower and resources. 
However, its benefits cannot be obtained by hasty 
improvisation. A working organization is much 
more than the creation of units and lines of control 
on a paper chart, and its product can have full 
meaning only when developed over many years. 
The exploitation of sources of information is grad-
ual and painstaking, while improvements in the 
techniques of processing come only from long ex-
perience. Dissemination is also a matter of train-
ing and experience in making certain that the

right knowledge reaches the right people at the 
right time. 
The experiences of World War II and the post-
war years have awakened and sharpened general 
interest in and knowledge of intelligence needs. 
The development of a United States Intelligence 
organization with an emphasis on coordination 
and guidance starting at the highest national level 
gives promise that the nation will be better 
guarded and better guided than it has in the past. 
With full and continued public support, United 
States Intelligence must continue to merit the 
trust of those it serves. 
COMMENTS ON STUDY 
The readers of this text will be primarily naval 
military personnel in many types of assignments. 
Some, having nonintelligence duties, will be inter-
ested only in a general understanding of intelli-
gence; it is hoped that such has been gained. 
Others, assigned to intelligence duties, will recog-
nize that this book is not a detailed working man-
ual. Many of its sections can be considerably 
expanded. Individual tasks must be learned 
either on the job or at such special training schools 
as may be organized for that purpose. However, 
for intelligence personnel, this book will have 
served its purpose if it has given a fuller insight 
CONFIDENTIAL 
406 
into the totality of intelligence activity and pro-
vided direction to further study. 
The ingenuity and interest of the individual will 
be required to expand his own sources from books, 
periodicals, newspapers, naval operational experi-
ence, foreign travel, and acquaintance with people 
everywhere. Equally as important as the study 
of books is learning more about people and why 
they react as they do. A characteristic of the 
good intelligence officer must be a genuine interest 
in people and places, an awareness of the world 
about him, and the ability to view it with objective 
detachment. 
The cursory inspection of this text for the sole 
purpose of locating facts to copy into written as-
signments will have limited and incidental value. 
The hasty formulation of answers to essay-type 
questions will be equally unrewarding. Clear 
thinking and real understanding are goals the 
reader should set for himself. He should particu-
larly derive from essay questions the experience 
of analyzing and interpreting topical material, to-
gether with that of the preparation of intelligence 
reports which have the qualities of clarity, con-
ciseness, and completeness. For the naval officer 
with much more than an idle curiosity and passing 
interest in intelligence this text will provide a 
good beginning to his own development as an 
intelligence officer of real value to the Navy.
