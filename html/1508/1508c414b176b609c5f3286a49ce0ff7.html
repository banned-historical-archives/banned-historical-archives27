CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
THE WEEK IN BRIEF 
PART I 
OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST  
KHRUSHCHEV'S FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH   Page 1 
In his speech to the closing session of the Supreme 
Soviet on 31 October, Khrushchev reviewed the principal 
themes of his "peaceful coexistence" policy. Taking 
a moderate line, he observed that there had been a "notice-
able improvement in the international situation" and reaf-
firmed his desire for an early summit meeting which, he 
said, should give top priority to disarmament. The speech 
provided further evidence that the Soviet premier is en-
countering difficulty in obtaining unqualified support 
from some bloc leaders, especially the Chinese, for his 
present foreign policy course. He sought to overcome 
reservations and doubts regarding the possible long-term 
effects of his peaceful coexistence line and issued a 
warning against "adventurism in politics." 
MIDDLE EAST HIGHLIGHTS   
The Iraqi Government is expected to begin this month 
the trial of several Baathists and other pro-UAR national-
ists for involvement in the attempt to assassinate Qasim. 
Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion has publicly warned the 
UAR that any attempt to stage an uprising in Iraq would 
compel Israel to reserve "freedom of action." Considera-
tion of possible contingency action in connection with the 
Iraqi situation presumably also has high priority in cur-
rent meetings between the Shah of Iran and King Husayn in 
Jordan. The UAR and the Sudan have reached an accord on 
sharing the Nile waters which may pave the way for the 
granting of a World Bank loan to the Sudan for initiation 
of its Roseires Dam project; construction of the Soviet-
engineered Aswan High Dam in Egypt is scheduled to begin 
next month. 
SINO-INDIAN BORDER DISPUTE   
Peiping has informed the Indian ambassador that there 
can be no question of Chinese withdrawal from disputed 
border posts, thus rejecting Nehru's condition for negotia-
tions'. The Chinese leaders probably feel a withdrawal 
would be interpreted as bowing to Indian pressure and 
would weaken their negotiating position. New Delhi, esti-
mating that the Chinese will try to expand their occupation 
of the territory in dispute before agreeing to negotiations, 
apparently has decided to counter with the swiftest possi-
ble expansion of "Indian presence" in frontier areas.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
ANTI-US RIOTS IN PANAMA 
5 November 1959 
PART I (continued) 
Panamanian politicians seeking to exploit public hos-
tility toward US administration of the Canal Zone were 
responsible for the violent anti-US rioting in Panama on 
3 November, the 56th anniversary of Panamanian independ-
ence. Further disorders may result from the wounding of 
several Panamanian citizens by American troops defending 
Zone entrances. The intensification of political maneu-
vering in anticipation of next May's presidential election 
is expected to provoke new expressions  of resentment 
against the United States. 
SITUATION IN LAOS 
PART II 
NOTES AND COMMENTS 
Only minor skirmishes have been reported in Laos 
recently. The Communists continue their efforts to pro-
mote antigovernment sentiment through propaganda and 
terrorist attacks on government supporters. The trial 
of Prince Souphannouvong and 13 other pro-Communist 
leaders has again been postponed. The USSR has brought 
into the open its opposition, previously expressed only 
in private, to the establishment of a permanent UN mis-
sion in Laos. Secretary General Hammarskjold still be-
lieves, however, that he can find a formula for appointing 
a "Personal" representative despite Soviet objections. 
THAI - NORTH VIETNAMESE REPATRIATION AGREEMENT   
Thailand and North Vietnam are preparing to repatri-
ate, starting in January 1960, those Vietnamese refugees 
in Thailand who wish to go to North Vietnam. Most of 
the 40,000 to 50,000 Vietnamese in Thailand favor the 
Hanoi regime, but it is not known how many will agree 
to be repatriated. The Communists may try to prolong 
the repatriation process in order to extend the life and 
expand the role of their repatriation mission in Thailand. 
Bangkok has looked upon the presence of Vietnamese along 
its frontier adjoining Laos as a serious security problem.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
PART II (continued) 
INDONESIA DISTURBED OVER ITS RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST 
CHINA   Page 4 
The treatment received by Indonesian Foreign Minister 
Subandrio during his recent visit to Peiping apparently 
left him angered and frightened by Communist China's 
aggressiveness and power. Subandrio has told the American 
ambassador in Djakarta that while there could be no dras-
tic change in Indonesia's policy of nonalignment there 
would probably be some "adjustments." These might include 
cautious moves to increase Indonesia's solidarity with its 
Southeast Asian neighbors as a means of standing up to 
Communist China. 
PEIPING AGAIN OPTIMISTIC OVER ECONOMIC PROSPECTS 
The Chinese Communist leaders seem to have regained 
some of the exuberance they lost during the spring and 
summer months. They now predict that the 1959 economic 
goals, as revised last August, will be met ahead of sched-
ule. This is possible insofar as industry is concerned, 
since the August targets were set deliberately low and 
since there has been improvement in the output of key 
items in the past two months. The predictions are unreal-
istic for agriculture, however. The extensive summer 
drought makes it extremely unlikely that the country can 
exceed last year's crops, let alone achieve the scheduled 
10-percent increase in grain and cotton. 
JAPANESE - NORTH KOREAN REPATRIATION   
Preparations for the repatriation of Korean residents 
in Japan to North Korea, scheduled to begin in early 
December, are under way following approval by Chosen Soren, 
the pro-Communist Korean residents' organization, of modi-
fications in procedures proposed by Tokyo. The lifting 
of Chosen Soren's boycott does not ensure smooth operation 
of the program, however, as the departure of a disappoint-
ingly small number of repatriates could result in renewed 
Communist obstruction. Implementation of the program will 
further strain relations between South Korea and Japan and 
may influence Rhee to suspend the negotiations for a set-
tlement of outstanding differences--talks which were re-
sumed in Tokyo last August.

loss of power in Kerala State has widened the rift between

extremist factions and brought the party to the point 
of an open break. The present leadership, which has the 
support of Moscow in its moderate position on internal 
and external issues, probably will be able to contain 
the dir 'idents by making some concessions. 
CEYLON 
Ceylon's Dahanayake government remains in a vulner-
able position despite its survival of a no-confidence 
motion in Parliament on 30 October. Cabinet dissension, 
the ruling group's dangerously slim parliamentary major-
ity, and charges implicating leading government officials 
in the assassination of Bandaranaike make for instability. 
Prime Minister Dahanayake's concern over these factors 
probably was responsible for the adjournment of Parlia-
ment until 24 November, after only three days in session. 
UNREST INCREASING IN BELGIAN CONGO 
Severe rioting in the Belgian Congo interior near 
Stanleyville, which cost the lives of about 70 Africans 
during the week end of 31 October, marked the first 
spread of serious nationalist disorders outside the lower 
Congo. The clashes between natives and Belgian troops 
followed in the wake of attacks on Belgian policy by sev-
eral nationalist groups. In Brussels the government has 
accepted opposition Socialist proposals for round-table 
conferences with Congolese leaders in November in an 
effort to ensure the holding of the communal and terri-
torial elections in the Congo in December. (b)(3)

FRENCH ALGERIAN PROGRAM 
In view of the broad public support De Gaulle has 
won for his Algerian program, announced on 16 September, 
his current "information" campaign appears primarily 
designed to overcome army dissatisfaction. He has felt 
it necessary to call for "absolute loyalty and discipline" 
in carrying out his policies, and the emphasis being placed 
by top military and civilian officials on France's long-
term presence in Algeria seems aimed at army extremists 
who fear De Gaulle may "abandon" Algeria. This apparent 
hardening of the French position has distressed moderates 
who had hoped to see early and  fruitful negotiations 
between Paris and the rebels. 
ITALY MAY GRANT TRADE CONCESSIONS TO USSR 
Pressure by Italian industrialists may lead the Segni 
government to grant the USSR substantial additional credits 
following the forthcoming Italian-Soviet trade talks in 
Rome.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
PART II (continued) 
RUMANIA ATTEMPTS TO STEP UP ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH 
WEST   Page 11 
For the past several months Rumania has been striving 
to expand its economic relations with the West and, with a 
view to obtaining further Western credits, to build Western 
confidence in its financial soundness and international 
responsibility. To this end, the Rumanians have indicated 
a readiness to discuss settlement of nationalization claims 
and to explore possibilities for expanded cultural rela-
tions. 
CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S THIRD FIVE-YEAR PLAN 
Party instructions for the Czechoslovak Third Five-
Year Plan (1961-65), which in tone and spirit recall 
Soviet economic policies of the Stalin era, stipulate a 
60-percent rise in output for heavy industry, a 30-per-
cent rise for light industry, and a 21-percent increase 
in agricultural production. The new program implies 
added strains on investment resources and only marginal 
improvements in the consumer's lot. Any serious public 
discontent as a result of slowness in improving the 
standard of living would probably be met with economic 
concessions, however, even if these involved som 
ne in the rate of industrial growth. 
EAST GERMAN CHURCH-STATE STRUGGLE INTENSIFIES   Page 14 
(b)(3) 
Page 12 
The Ulbricht regime is preparing to sever the East 
German Evangelical Church from its leadership in West 
Berlin, and there is some evidence that it is winning the 
cooperation of some high-ranking clergy in East Germany. 
In the event the Communists meet with further success 
among the clergy, the regime will probably move to set 
up a separate church and thus split one of the few remain-
ing all-German organizations. 
THE SITUATION IN CUBA 
In line with its drastic approach to economic reforms, 
many of which are badly needed, the Castro government has 
passed a new mining law severely restricting private mining 
enterprises and has seized the files of foreign oil com-
panies. Castro's erratic conduct, as well as the revival 
of the revolutionary tribunals, has led to criticism in 
other Latin American countries. Havana may be planning 
to resume diplomatic relations with  the USSR and open 
trade relations with East Germany.

Page 15 
The presidential ambitions of two leading personali-
ties in Bolivia's ruling party, the MNR, are causing 
serious unrest and outbreaks of armed violence. MNR leader 
and former President Paz, who apparently has President Biles' 
support, and Walter Guevara, leader of the party's right 
wing, are mustering armed militia units for a possible 
showdown. 
BRITAIN'S RELATIONS WITH WESTERN EUROPE 
Since re-election the Macmillan government has given 
priority to improving Britain's relations with the six 
European Economic Community (EEC) members. By hinting 
at greater willingness to participate in regional projects, 
London seeks to avert rapid extension of EEC activities 
which might further reduce British influence on the conti-
nent. Foreign Secretary Lloyd will promote his plans in 
a visit to Paris on 11 and 12 November, and Chancellor 
Adenauer and Premier Segni will soon visit London in an 
endeavor to strengthen ties.

each other and with outside blocs. Some North African 
leaders have been seeking to bring about a united "Maghreb 
federation" in northwest Africa. Some go further and 
envisage an alliance of North African states with France 
or association with a European community. Intra-Maghreb 
frictions seem to rule out a closely knit federation, but 
some form of loose union which would extend North Africa's 
traditional ties with Western Europe might be possible 
and would provide the diversification of contacts North 
Africans seek. 
FRENCH COMMUNITY IN EVOLUTION 
(b)(3) 
Page 11 
President de Gaulle is guiding the development of 
the French Community toward a more flexible structure 
providing for varying degrees of autonomy in an effort 
to make the Community acceptable to African nationalism 
and possibly to attract new members. Negotiations for 
a looser relationship between Paris and the Federation 
of Mali--comprising the republics of Soudan and Senegal--
are likely to begin after the next meeting of the Commu-
nity Executive Council, scheduled for December. French 
officials may also see the concept of an evolutionary 
Community as providing the legal framework for a solution 
of the Algerian problem. In view of increasing nation-
alist aspirations throughout France's present and former 
possessions, however, it appears doubtful that any French-
proposed association, however liberal, can be attractive 
for long. (b)(3) 
SOVIET REACTION TO THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION IN MOSCOW . . . Page 14 
Despite strenuous efforts by the Soviet regime to 
undermine the impact of the American exhibition in Moscow, 
the fair was the object of intense popular curiosity. Well 
over 2,000,000 Soviet citizens attended, which was some-
what more than the number specified in the US-Soviet 
exhibition agreement. Their reaction appears to have been 
one of general approval, although there was some adverse 
comment on certain of the exhibits and on the organization 
of the fair. The impact of the fair has apparently been 
felt in the highest party circles and may have contributed 
to the recent government announcement of a slight increase 
in consumer goods production.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
PART I 
OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST 
KHRUSHCHEV'S FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH 
Khrushchev's speech to the 
closing session of the Supreme 
Soviet on 31 October was the 
most comprehensive exposition 
to date of his policy of "peace-
ful coexistence." Indicating 
satisfaction with the "notice-
able improvement in the inter-
national situation," he said 
the prospects for strengthen-
ing peace "have become more fa-
vorable." 
In his notably moderate 
and restrained speech, the Soviet 
premier claimed a major shift 
had occurred in Western pol-
icy and attitudes toward 
the USSR. He attributed this 
to a "more sober evaluation" 
and "sensible understanding" in 
the West of the "position of 
forces in the international 
area," "Even some of the ac-
tive conductors of the 'posi-
tions of strength' policy see 
its futility," he said, and 
predicted that this more "sen-
sible understanding" will lead 
to the abandonment of "calcu-
lations of using military 
forces against the socialist 
world." 
Khrushchev's discussion 
contained no indication of any 
important changes in the Soviet 
position. He repeated his fa-
vorable assessment of his US 
visit and talks with President 
Eisenhower and attempted to 
convey the impression that he 
had reached "mutual understand-
ing" with both the President 
and Prime Minister Macmillan on 
a summit meeting. 
While he avoided direct 
criticism of De Gaulle's posi-
tion on the timing of a meeting, 
he rejected the view of "some

reaffirmed his preference for 
an early summit meeting and pro-
posed an agenda which gave top 
priority to disarmament, fol-
lowed by a German peace treaty, 
Berlin, and "other internation-
al questions of general inter-
est." 
Khrushchev expressed appre-
ciation of the statements by De 
Gaulle and Premier Debra on the 
"inviolability" of the Oder-
Neisse frontier. He gave a 
cautious endorsement to De 
Gaulle's recent statement on 
Algeria, probably to appear re-
sponsive to the French cabinet's 
communiqu�f 21 October which 
stressed the importance an 
improvement in the "world 
climate" would play in jus-
tifying French participation 
in a summit conference. 
At the same time, however, 
Khrushchev repeated the 
standard expression of Soviet 
sympathy for peoples who are 
"struggling for independence and 
national liberty."

attack against the Soviet Union" 
and accused the US of trying to 
distort the character of Sino-
Soviet relations and cast doubt 
on Peiping's sovereignty. 
He repeated Moscow's view 
that the Taiwan question is a 
"purely internal affair of 
China" and expressed confidence 
that "Taiwan and the other is-
lands will be reunited with the 
rest of China." Although he 
made no mention of the use of 
force, Khrushchev renewed So-
viet pledges to support Peiping 
"until it has achieved settle-
ment of this question because 
the legal and moral right is on 
its side." 
Kh.eushchev carefully ad-
hered to his neutral position 
on the Sino-Indian border dis-
pute, expressing hope for a 
peaceful settlement satisfac-
tory to both sides. 
The speech provided further 
evidence that Khrushchev is en-
countering difficulties in ob-
taining unqualified support 
from some bloc leaders, espec-
ially the Chinese, for his pres-
ent foreign policy course. Ap-
parently in an effort to meet 
reservations and doubts about 
the long-range effects of his 
peaceful coexistence policy, 
Khrushchev gave a lengthy ex-
position of the nature and 
limits of this concept and 
stoutly defended the need for 
"flexibility" in foreign policy 
without abandoning "principles:' 
He cited Lenin's teaching that 
the "working class, before as 
well as after it has gained pow-
er, must be able to pursue a 
flexible policy, compromise, 
and come to agreement whenever 
life and the interests of the 
cause demand it." 
He contended that "mutual 
concessions" are necessary in 
the present state of East-West 
relations, but added that "one 
must not confuse mutual conces-
sions in the interest of peace-
ful coexistence" with ideologi-
cal concessions. Presumably 
in response to unnamed critics, 
Khrushchev emphasized "there 
cannot be any question of con-
cessions or adaptation" in 
matters of ideology. 
The gravity of the prob-
lem which apparently has been 
created by Peiping's coolness 
toward Khrushchev's present 
policy was underscored by his 
resort to the extraordinary 
device of resurrecting the 
episode of Trotsky's opposi-
tion to Lenin's decision to 
make peace with Germany in 
1918 "to ensure for the young 
Soviet state the possibility 
of peaceful construction of 
socialism." Except for passing 
references in Khrushchev's 
secret speech at the 20th par-
ty congress, this is the first 
mention of Trotsky by a 
top Soviet leader in many 
years. 
Khrushchev's denunciation 
of Trotsky's "adventurist pol-
icy" of "neither peace nor war" 
almost certainly was aimed di-
rectly at the Chinese Commu-
nist leaders. He remarked 
pointedly that Trotsky's posi-
tion had "played into the 
hands of the German im-
perialists," recalled the dif-
ficulties his policy had 
created for the "young so-
cialist state," and conclud-
ed with the observation that 
"such were the fruits  of  
adventurism  n politics!' (b)(3)

5 November 1959 
MIDDLE EAST 
Iraq 
Although the situation in 
Iraq remains calm outwardly, an 
underlying feeling of tension 
permeates the country. Nation-
alists and Communists are ap-
parently awaiting the opening 
of the trials of those charged 
with the assassination attempt 
on Premier Qasim--and the pre-
mier's release from the hos-
pital--before making new moves. 
Security authorities remain 
apprehensive about demonstra-
tions tentatively scheduled 
for the day of Qasim's release. 
These are likely to lead to 
clashes between nationalists 
and Communists. The military 
governor, General Abdi, is 
said to be contemplating the 
cancellation of parades on 
that day. 
� Qasim appears to be slow-
ly recovering from his wounds. 
He carries on state business 
from his hospital room and re-
ceives visitors every day--in-
cluding the Soviet and Turkish 
ambassadors on 1.November. His 
full recovery may take several 
more weeks, and he has stated 
that he does not wish to leave 
the hospital until he is a 
"whole man" unencumbered by 
the cast on his left arm. 
The expulsion of the sec-
ond secretary of the UAR Em-
bassy in Baghdad on 1 November 
for subversive activities was 
a further blow to pro-UAR na-
tionalists in Iraq. Mandawi 
is likely to use this incident 
to build his charges of UAR im-
plication in the Qasim assas-
sination attempt.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
The Shah has stated he 
will not insist at this time 
that ships destined for Ira-
nianparts use Iranian pilots 
and fly the Iranian flag. Iran, 
however, intends to continue 
to provide naval escorts for 
ships using Khosroabad to en-
sure against interference by 
the Iraqis. The Shah has in-
dicated that he is ready at 
any time to begin negotiations 
with Iraq over questions of 
sovereignty and navigation on 
the Shatt al Arab. 
fEDITERRANEAN SEA 
The Shah's visit to Jor-
dan from 2 to 6 November prob-
ably is causing additional con-
cern in Iraq. The Shah, how-
ever, while discussing contin-
gency plans regarding Iraq 
with Jordanian King Husayn, is 
probably cautioning him against 
intervention at this time in 
Iraqi affairs. 
The clandestine Soviet 
radio "The National Voice of 
Iran," located in the Caucasus, 
has warned meanwhile that the 
Shah's trip--which will be fol-
lowed by visits to Tehran by 
Pakistani President Ayub and 
Turkish Premier Menderes--in-
dicates that a plot "primarily 
directed against Iraq" is being 
hatched. The broadcast ad-
vised Iranian Army officers to 
show that they will not be used 
in the "execution of the Shah's 
fabrications." 
Sudan -UAR 
The main issues in the 
long-standing Nile waters dis-
pute between the Sudan and the 
�UAR have been resolved, accord-
ing to unofficial announcements, 
and the negotiators now are 
drafting a formal agreement. 
President Nasir personally set 
the tone for the talks, which 
have been under way in Cairo 
more than three weeks, and the 
UAR made concessions to meet 
most of the Sudanese demands. 
Egypt is to receive about 75 
percent of the usable Nile 
flow, and the Sudan about 25 
percent. 
A difficult issue was the 
amount of compensation the UAR 
is to pay for Sudanese lands

Aswan High Dam. There may be 
further wrangling on this 
point, but signature of a com-
prehensive agreement is expect-
ed within the next few days. 
This will pave the way for the 
grant of a $50,000,000=$60,-
000,000 World Bank loan to the 
Sudan for its Roseires Dam 
project. Construction of the 
first stage of the Soviet-engi-
neered Aswan High Dam in Egypt 
is scheduled to begin next 
month. 
The UAR-Sudanese agreement 
may cause friction with Ethi-
opia and with the United King-
dom, speaking for Kenya, Uganda, 
and Tanganyika. These riparian 
states insisted on a voice in any final 
allocation of the Nile waters. 
The unstable and unpopu-
lar Abboud military government 
is gaining new public support 
in the Sudan by emphasizing 
the favorable terms of the ac-
cord, even though many Sudan-
ese remain suspicious that 
somehow the UAR will get the 
best of the deal. The govern-
ment urgently needs such sup-
port to contend with coup plot-
ting by disgruntled junior army 
officers and with pressures by 
political and religious lead-
ers for an early return to ci-
vilian government. 
Israel 
The Israeli elections on 
3 November increased the par-
liamentary strength of David 
Ben-Gurion's Mapai party, but 
the increase was not sufficient 
for a majority of the 120 seats 
in the Knesset. Another coa-
lition accordingly will be 
required to form a government, 
and Ben-Gurion, who has long 
chafed under coalition re-
strictions, is expected to lead 
it again as prime minister. 
Mapai apparently will have 
47 seats compared with 40 in 
the previous Knesset. Its most 
serious challenger, the ultra-
nationalist Herut party, also 
obtained an increased percent-
age of the total vote which, 
in Israel's involved system of 
proportional representation, 
will go from 15 to 17 seats. 
The conservative General Zion-
ists, the left-wing socialist 
Achdut Haavoda party, and the 
Communists all received small-
er percentages of the vote. 
The votes obtained by the 
other established parties were 
about equal to their previous 
percentages. A plethora of new 
parties, five of which hoped to 
exploit the grievances of "ori-
ental" Jews, failed to attract 
any significant voting support.

The Israelis apparently be-
lieve that UAR intervention in 
Iraq would result in widespread 
chaos in the area, which could 
lead to Nasir's domination of 
Jordgin..

Israel. In a pre-election

THE SINO -INDIAN 
The Chinese Communists 
have recently indicated that 
the major stumbling block 
to the start of negotiations 
with New Delhi on the border 
dispute is Nehru's insistence 
that Chinese troops must first 
be withdrawn from border out-
posts in Indian-claimed terri-
tory. Peiping's Foreign Min-
istry officials told the In-
dian ambassador in late October 
that these troops are occupying 
China's own territory and there 
could be no question of with-
drawing before negotiations. 
 _1 Mao Tse-tung and Liu 
Shao-chi had stressed the Chi-
nese view that there should 
be "no prior conditions" for 
negotiations. 
that "we want" the border 
problem to be solved and "we 
are ready to solve it at any 
moment as soon as possible." 
The Chinese leaders will 
probably stand firm on this po-
sition. They apparently believe 
that acceptance of Nehru's re-
and that in the ensuing battle 
one Israeli plane was hit. 
One or both of the forma-
tions probably engaged in a 
reconnaissance of the border  
areas.

quest for withdrawals would 
be interpreted as bowing to 
Indian pressure. Peiping seems 
particularly concerned that 
withdrawal of its forces from 
the Ladakh area would preju-
dice its claims to this area 
in future newitiations with 
New Delhi. 
Despite their firmness 
on the issue of troop with-
drawals, the Chinese apparent-
ly do not wish to appear ob-
structionist in the matter of

New Delhi's increasingly

its strongly worded reply on

ANTI-US RIOTS IN PANAMA 
The violent demonstrations 
of 3 November against the Canal 
Zone and other US installations 
in Panama were touched off by 
nationalistic politicians seek-
ing to exploit.Panamanian re-
sentment of US policies in the 
Zone. The wounding of several 
demonstrators by US forces de-
fending entrances to the Zone 
may provide extremists with a 
popular cause that could re-
sult in fresh disorders. The 
Panamanian National Guard did 
little to prevent or control 
rioting and incursions into the 
Zone. 
Former Foreign Minister 
Aquilino Boyd, a presidential 
hopeful and an opposition dep-
uty in the legislature, issued 
a call in July for the "peaceful 
occupation" of the Canal Zone 
by Panamanians bearing flags on 
3 November, the 56th anniversary 
of Panamanian independence. He 
was supported by rabidly anti-
US university professor Ernesto 
Castillero, who urged massive 
participation in a Gandhi-type 
civil resistance march into the 
Zone. 
Boyd and Castillero re-
mained adamant in spite of pres-
sure from government officials 
urging that the scheme be aban-
doned or its scope reduced to 
that of a symbolic gesture.

proposal because it was viewed 
as a political maneuver de-
signed to win support for Boyd 
in his presidential campaign. 
Panamanians have continual-
ly demanded their country re-
ceive a greater share of canal 
revenues and be recognized as 
retaining sovereignty over the 
territory of the Canal Zone. 
They also charge that the US 
has failed to live up to its 
commitments under the 1955 
treaty governing the adminis-
tration of the Zone. Specific 
Panamanian complaints are that 
Panamanian workers in the Zone 
receive lower wages than Amer-
icans performing identical tasks 
there and that US agencies in 
the Zone purchase products from 
foreign countries which, under 
terms of the treaty, should be 
purchased from Panama. 
Foreign Minister Miguel 
Moreno won enthusiastic Pana-
manian approval when he un-
expectedly voiced these complaints 
at the August foreign ministers' 
meeting in Santiago and again 
at the opening session of the 
UN General Assembly in September. 
He repeated his accusations in 
a speech last week in Bogota. 
Elements of the corrupt 
ruling oligarchy find it con-
venient to use anti-US senti-
ments to distract popular at-
tention from deep-seated eco-
nomic and social discontent 
among Panama's lower income 
groups. An intensification of 
pre-election political ac-
tivity prior to the national 
presidential election in May 
1960 is expected to result 
in a more emphatic campaign 
for added canal benefits. 
Further, political exploitation 
of emotionally charged canal 
issues may lead to additional 
disorders similar se 
of 3 November. 1 (b)(3)

NOTES AND COMMENTS 
SITUATION IN LAOS 
Only minor skirmishing has 
been reported in Laos in the 
last few days, but the Communist 
dissidents continue their ef-
forts to promote antigovernment 
sentiment through a combination 
of propaganda and terrorist at-
tacks on supporters of the Phoui 
regime. Laotian Army elements 
advancing in the Ma River area 
of northeastern Sam Neua 
Province are encountering lit-
tle resistance, but this lack 
of opposition probably re-
flects a deliberate attempt by 
the dissidents to save their 
strength and is not due to any 
diminution of their capa-
bilities in this area. 
The death of King Sisavong 
Vong caused Phoui and his par-
ty to cut short their visit to 
Washington and New York and pre-
vented the premier from keep-
ing a previously arranged ap-
pointment with UN Secretary Gen-
eral Hammarskj old. Prince Re-
gent Savang, who was proclaimed 
the new King on 1 November, is 
likely to play a more active 
role in government affairs than 
his father. Savang is strongly 
anti-Communist and a supporter 
of the Committee for the Defense 
of National Interests (CDNI), 
which is in an uneasy coalition 
with Phoui's Rally of the Lao 
People (RLP). 
The government has again 
postponed the trial of Prince 
Souphannouvong and 13 other 
pro-Communist leaders of the 
Neo Lao Hak Zat (NLHZ), this 
time until after 13 November; 
inadequacy of security arrange-
ments was the reason given. 
Hanoi, and to a lesser de-
gree Peiping and Moscow, con-
tinue to protest againsta trial. 
On 31 October and 2 Novem(b)(1) 
respectively, the foreign min-
isters of North Vietnam and Com-
munist China addressed formal 
protests to the British foreign 
secretary and to the Soviet for-
eign minister as cochairmen of

for "urgent measures" to prevent 
the trial on the ground that it 
would violate the Geneva agree-
ments of 1954 and the Vientiane 
agreements of 1957.ind block a 
peaceful solution. The Chinese 
letter reiterated Peiping's 
view that the dispute should be 
settled through broad negotia-

pro-Communists, but who had 
been released recently so that 
they might dispose of their 
property. The first refugees 
are to be returned by ship in 
January 1960. 
Most of these refugees 
fled to Thailand when the French 
resumed control of Indochina 
after World War II, and an es-
timated 90 percent of them fa-
vor North Vietnam. The Thai 
Government has long sought to 
effect at least a partial solu-
tion to the serious internal 
security problem posed by their 
presence along the strategic 
northeast frontier adjoining 
Laos. Recent reports indicate 
that several hundred may have 
crossed the border to join 
rebel forces in southern Laos. 
North Vietnam has estab-
lished an Overseas Vietnamese 
service to study repatriation 
policies, and the minister of 
interior recently led a two-day 
conference to discuss resettle-
ment measures. These measures 
are intended to provide for re-
patriates from New Caledonia 
and French Guiana, as well as 
those from Thailand. There 
are about 5,000 Vietnamese con-
tract laborers in New Caledonia 
and 300 Vietnamese in French 
Guiana who were formerly politi-
cal prisoners. 
The two North Vietnamese 
Red Cross representatives who 
will serve as "advisers" to the 
Thai Red Cross in connection 
with the repatriation sought 
but were refused permission to 
set up their mission in Bangkok 
in October, instead of early No-
vember as scheduled. They left 
Hanoi on 24 October, however, 
and proceeded to Rangoon, where 
they remained until admitted to 
Thailand on 2 November. Hanoi 
will probably attempt to magni-
fy the importance of the mission, 
in line with North Vietnam's 
policy of promoting official 
% 
and semiofficial contacts with 
nonbloc nations. 
Although Hanoi is active-
ly publicizing preparations to 
receive repatriates, it is un-
certain how many of the 40,000

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
INDONESIA DISTURBED OVER ITS RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST CHINA 
The experience of Indone-
sian Foreign Minister Subandrio 
during his recent four-day 
visit to Peiping apparently left 
him angered and terrified by the 
revelation of Communist China's 
aggressiveness and power. In a 
conversation with the American 
ambassador in Djakarta, Suband-
rio stated that his eyes had 
been opened to China's expan-
sionist aims and that,while 
there could be no d:astic change 
in Indonesia's independent for-
eign policy, "adjustments in 
degree and attitude" would cer-
tainly take place. 
Subandrio's visit was 
prompted by strong Chinese Com-
munist protests over an Indo-
nesian Government decree re-
quiring the withdrawal of alien 
retail merchants from rural 
areas by the beginning of 1960. 
Most of these merchants are 
Overseas Chinese. He reported 
that Chinese officials in dis-
cussions with the Indonesians 
were arrogant, patronizing, and 
abusive. They charged that 
harassment of the Overseas Chi-
nese was American inspired, and, 
in an effort to force repeal or 
substantial modification of the 
ban, threatened economic retali-
ation and other unspecified 
measu 
(b)(1) 
Subandrio, who has long 
been a supporter of Indonesia's 
policy of nonalignment, told 
Ambassador Jones he would like 
to review Indonesia's policy, 
but that there could be no dras-
tic change because Communist 
China is a close and powerful 
neighbor. He further implied 
that Indonesia could not afford 
to alienate Sino-Soviet bloc 
support for its claim to West 
Irian (Netherlands New Guinea). 
He asserted, however, that the 
Indonesian Government would not 
back down in implementing the 
ban on alien retailers and that 
his position had the full sup-
port of President Sukarno. He 
pleaded for continued American 
support in the face of expected 
further Chinese pressures.

his visit, Subandrio has main-
tained a cautious appearance of 
friendly relations with Communist 
China. During a Manila  stonove

China, and he may hope to move 
cautiously in this direction 
within the framework of Indo-
nesia's "nonalignment" policy.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
PEIPING AGAIN OPTIMISTIC OVER ECONOMIC PROSPECTS 
In the past few months the 
Chinese Communist leaders seem 
to have recovered some of the 
exuberance which had earlier 
characterized their approach to 
the "great leap forward." Party 
and government spokesmen are 
painting a picture of China's 
economic prospects for this 
year and next, which is brighter 
than that presented to the pub-
lic last August, when sharp cuts 
had to be made in the targets 
for 1959. 
These spokesmen say that 
the party-initiated work drive 
led to a marked upswing in pro-
duction during September and 
October, at least in industrial 
production and construction ac-
tivity. Steel production, for 
example, is said to have jumped 
20 percent in September and 
another 14 percent in October. 
Heartened by figures such 
as these, the leaders now con-
fidently predict that most in-
dustries will fulfill their re-
vised 1959 goals some 10-15 
days ahead of schedule, thus 
opening the way for a further 
"leap forward" during 1960. 
While fluctuations in the 
tone of public discussion of 
economic matters in Communist 
China have typically been great-
er than the fluctuations in 
actual performance, an improve-
ment does indeed appear to have 
taken place. This has been due 
only partly to the party's drive 
to revitalize the "leap." Sea-
sonal and long-term factors--
including the normal increase 
in production which takes place 
in the second half of the year 
and the coming into production 
of new plant capacity--also con-
tributed to the stepped up pace. 
The suspicion is strong, how-
ever, that the Chinese leaders 
chose to ignore these factors 
so as to make the response to 
their call for harder work ap-
pear more impressive. 
Peiping has in fact been 
using the recent upswing as ev-
idence of the indispensability 
of the mass campaign to bring 
about such upsurges in produc-
tion. It has engaged in a truc-
ulent defense of this mechanism 
for extracting more work from 
the Chinese people in the face 
of attacks by critics who have 
labeled certain past campaigns 
"horrible disasters." The party 
is readying a massive rural work 
campaign for the coming winter 
which may approach in intensity 
the massive drive in the winter 
of 1957-58 which kicked off the 
"leap forward." 
The improvement in outlook 
thus far is largely confined to 
industry and does not extend to 
agriculture, although the re-
gime's farm procurement programs 
show some improvement over last 
year. There is good reason to 
regard with considerable reserve 
the regime's professed belief 
that a 10-percent increase will 
be achieved in this year's out-
put of grain and cotton. This 
claim is being advanced in the 
teeth of what one agricultural 
leader in Peiping has described 
as the worst natural calamities 
since the regime came to power 
ten years ago. 
Information from independent 
sources on weather in China con-
firms there was a serious drought 
in key farm areas and suggests 
it covered a sufficiently large 
area and lasted long enough to 
make it doubtful that China can 
equal last year's actual pro-
duction. In any case, the 
revised goals of 275,000,000 
tons of grain and 2,300,000 
tons of cotton remain well 
out of Peiping's reach, al-
though the leaders will 
probably end by claiming 
that the proals were met.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
JAPANESE - NORTH KOREAN REPATRIATION 
Preparations for the re-
patriation to North Korea of 
Korean residents in Japan sched-
uled to begin early in December 
are under way following approval 
by Chosen Soren, the pro-Commu-
nist Korean residents' organi-
zation, of modifications in 
procedures proposed by Tokyo. 
The lifting of Chosen Soren's 
boycott does not ensure smooth 
operation of the program, how-
ever, as the departure of a dis-
appointingly small number of 
repatriates could result in 
renewed Communist obstruction. 
Implementation of the program 
will further strain relations 
between South Korea and Japan. 
The revised procedures will 
permit limited, controlled con-
tacts between the repatriates 
and their relatives at railroad 
stations and at Niigata, the 
port of embarkation. Final 
interviews at Niigata to estab-
lish the voluntary intentions 
of the repatriates will be con-
ducted with families, rather 
than with individuals, in the 
presence of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross' 
(ICRC) representative. 
Although these procedures 
would seem to give Chosen Soren 
additional opportunities to 
exert pressure on unwilling or 
wavering individuals, Tokyo 
claims they do not substantively 
INDIAN COMMUNIST PARTY FACES 
The Indian Communist party, 
facing its most serious internal 
crisis in ten years, is sched-
uled to convene its national 
council on 10 November for a 
showdown on policy and leader(-
ship. The damage to Communist 
unity and prestige in India re-
sulting from recent Sino-Indian 
affect the repatriates' "free-
dom of choice." The ICRC 
probably will cooperate in the 
program, unless Chosen Soren 
creates an incident which 
flagrantly violates the prin-
ciples the international body 
has established for guarantee-
ing the Koreans voluntary 
choice of residence. 
The registration of pro-
spective repatriates between 
4 and 6 November should indi-
cate roughly how many of the 
approximately 700,000 Korean 
residents in Japan desire to  
go to North Korea. 
ChoqbX1y,oren 
will select the repatriates and 
screen them for political re-
liability, presumably to satisfy 
North Korean requirements. While 
Pyongyang apparently wants re-
patriation to proceed, it is 
likely to continue harassment, 
of the Japanese by charging in-
fractions of the agreement. 
Although announcement of 
the agreement with Chosen Soren 
prompted South Korean threats 
to break off talks now under way 
in Tokyo for a settlement of 
outstanding problems, this has 
not yet occurred and some re-
sponsible officials hope the 
discussions will continue. The 
negotiations have made little 
substantive progress to date, 
largely because Seoul has not 
developed any positive policies.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
Chinese Communist action 
along the Tibetan frontier has 
highlighted divisions in the 
Indian party along "nationalist" 
and "internationalist" lines, 
while the failure of the "Kerala 
experiment" emphasized the con-
flict between proponents of a 
"peaceful, parliamentary" ap-, 
proach to power and those advo-
cating more aggressive tactics. 
Party Secretary Ajoy Ghosh, 
caught in the middle, leads a 
faction favoring a policy which 
in effect compromises differences 
between the extreme positions 
on both internal and external 
questions. 
The increasing isolation 
of the Communist party in In-
dia, due to its inability to 
take an unequivocal stand for 
or against Peiping's actions, 
has caused a greater upheaval 
in Communist ranks than any 
previous issue. Alarmed over 
the prospect of losing much 
popular support, certain "na-
tionalist" Communists, notably 
parliamentary party leader ' 
S. A. Dange, were impelled to 
side with the general Indian 
reaction against China and pub-
licly air their disagreement 
with the official party position. 
The moderate leadership 
probably will manage to contain 
the extremists by making some 
concessions to their demands. 
The recent renewal of Sino-
Indian border clashes in Ladakh 
has left the moderates with no 
alternative but to take a more 
critical stand against Peiping, 
thus narrowing the gap between 
them and the "nationalists." 
On internal policy, the moderate 
leadership probably will appease 
the proponents of aggressive 
tactics by allowing them to or-
ganize a more extensive under-
ground apparatus in case of future 
need, while outwardly the party 
maintains the parliamentary ap-
proach. 
The present leadership will 
be aided in its efforts to keep 
the party on a moderate course 
by the numerous expressions of 
support Ghosh has recently re-
ceived from top Soviet party lead-
ers. Moscow apparently feels 
that Communist interests in In-
dia--at least while Nehru is in 
power--will be best served by 
avoiding either the "nationalist" 
or 'internationalist" extremes.

CEYLON 
The Ceylonese Government 
is in a vulnerable position de-
spite the defeat on 30 October 
of a no-confidence motion by 
48 to 43 votes. Serious cabinet 
dissension, the ruling party's 
dangerously slim parliamentary 
majority, and rumors implicating 
leading government officials in 
the assassination of Prime Min-
ister Bandaranaike cast doubt on 
Dahanayake's Ability to maintain

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
During the vote the gov-
ernment rallied its maximum 
strength, which had been re-
duced shortly beforehand by 
the dismissal of a cabihet'min-
ister indirectly implicated 
in the assassination ,and by 
the resignation of .a gov-
ernment Worker. Two oppOsition 
members were absent, and two 
abstained. The ruling group's 
success thus depended on the 
continued reluctance of a few 
opposition elements td force 
early elections and--for the 
first time since the present 
government was elected under 
Bandaranaike in April 1956--
on the votes of six nonelected 
appointees. 
Public awareness of 
charges implicating top govern-
ment officials in Bandaranaike's 
assassination probably has in-
creased considerably since the 
relaxation of press censorship 
on 20 October. The press has 
heaped ridicule and criticism 
on Dahanayake and the cabinet, 
and has supported opposition 
demands that Finance Minister 
De Zoysa resign because of his 
association with one of several 
UNREST INCREASING 
Severe rioting in the in-
terior of the Belgian Congo 
near Stanleyville, which cost 
the lives of about 70 Africans 
during the week end of 31 Oc-
tober, marked the first spread 
of serious nationalist dis-
orders outside the lower Con-
go. The clashes between na-
tives and Belgian troops, in 
the wake of attacks on Belgian 
policy by several nationalist 
groups, suggest that nation-
suspects and the rumored in-
volvement of his two brothers. 
One government member during 
the no-confidence debate advo-
cated De Zoysa's expulsion. At 
least six cabinet members also 
favor such a move, and it seems 
unlikely that the government 
can avoid dismissing or at least 
suspending him pending the out-
come of the investigations. 
Dahanayake's concern over 
his government's position prob-
ably was responsible for the 
adjournment of Parliament un-
til 24 November, after only a 
three-day session. In the in-
terim, Dahanayake presumably 
will try to consolidate his 
position as leader of the rul-
ing party, to mend or at least 
suppress the government's rifts, 
and possibly to increase his 
parliamentary majority, by bar-
gaining with moderate opposi-
tion elements. To accomplish 
this he would have to prove as 
able a tactician as Bandara-
naike and possibly to improve 
on Bandaranaiker's efforts to 
cope with the island's long-
standing economic and comm1 nal 
problems.

sels' program for Congolese in-
dependence in about four years. 
In rejecting the Belgian plan, 
the MNC followed the example 
of the Abako, the leading na-
tionalist organization in the 
politically volatile lower 
Congo. The American Embassy 
in Brussels reports that the 
Abako's rejection of Congo Min-
ister de Schrijver's four-year 
program was received with "gen-
uine surprise" by Belgian offi-
cials. 
In the absence of respon-
sible nationalist leadership 
in the Congo, Brussels has 
sought to develop political 
stability through the support 
of certain tribal leaders. 
Prospects for such stability, 
however, have diminished late-
ly as a result of a sharpening 
of tribal rivalries in several 
areas. In Elisabethville, con-
cern over a possible national-
ist boycott of European goods 
has been heightened by instances 
of increased friction among lo-
cal African groups, and the 
American consul believes tension 
In the area to be higher than at 
any time since the Leopoldville 
riots of last January. 
Prior to the Stanleyville 
disturbances, Lumumba reported-
ly demanded immediate Congolese 
independence, or his group 
would "face Belgium with a fait 
accompli." On 3 November, 
Brussels announced that a round-
table conference would be held 
with Congo leaders in late No-
vember, presumably to clarify 
Brussels' program for gradual 
independence. Such a conference 
may serve to mollify some Congo 
leaders, several of whom have 
complained that the De Schrij-
ver program was adopted without 
consultation with the Congolese. 
The seriousness of the cur-
rent situation has apparently 
caused the Belgian Government 
and the opposition Socialists 
to close ranks in an attempt 
to re-establish a common front 
on Congo policy. The scheduled 
round-table conference is in 
accordance with Socialist de-
mands that Belgian officials 
negotiate directly with the 
Congolese leaders in an effort 
to assure that the December 
elections will be held. 
The government and the So-
cialists also agree on the ne-
cessity of extensive Belgian eco-
nomic aid to the Congo, and 
plans call for the creation of 
a "development company" and 
for Belgian support of the Con-
golese franc. The Socialists, 
however, differ with the gov-
ernment on how to finance the 
additional costs involved, be-
lieving that the large Congo 
companies should be made to as-
sume a greater responsibility. 
It is not yet clear whether the 
Liberals in the government, who 
are always difficult on finan-
cial questions, are in complete 
agreement with their cabi-
net colleagues on these 
latest proposals. (b)(3)

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
FRENCH ALGERIAN PROGRAM 
In view of the broad pub-
lic support De Gaulle has won 
for his Algerian program an-
nouncedon 16 September, his 
current "information" campaign 
appears primarily designed to 
overcome army dissatisfaction. 
He has felt obliged to call for 
"absolute loyalty and disci-
pline" in carrying out his 
policies, and the emphasis being 
placed by top military and ci-
vilian officials on France's 
long-term presence in Algeria 
seems aimed at army extremists 
who fear De Gaulle may "abandon" 
Algeria. This apparent harden-
ing of the French position has 
distressed moderates who had 
hoped to see early and fruit-
ful negotiations between Paris 
and the rebels. 
Delegate General in Algeria 
Delouvrier's public explanation 
of the terms of the proposed 
two-stage referendum on Alge-
ria's future has disturbed many 
Frenchmen and such interested 
foreigners as Tunisian Presi-
dent Bourguiba, who had been 
hopeful of an early liberal 
solution. With army dissatis-
faction increasingly apparent, 
Delouvrier's assurance that an 
initial vote will be--as in 
1958--on whether any tie should 
be maintained with France seems 
aimed at appeasing De Gaulle's 
rightist critics rather than 
merely elaborating on the de-
tails of a referendum which 
will probably not take place 
for several years. The second 
stage would permit a choice 
between autonomy and integra-
tion with France. 
(b)(3) 
  Military uneasiness ap-
pears focused on whether the 
army will continue to play a 
major role in the administration 
of Algeria, whether the rebels 
will be granted a cease-fire 
on terms short of surrender, and 
whether the army will "lose face" 
with the Moslems because of the 
government's "soft" program. 
On 28 October 
 (b)(3) 
De Gaulle 
declared that France's policy 
is to pacify Algeria "completely 
and humanely," to assure its 
development, and to give the 
Algerians every reason to de-
sire unity with France. 
Official concern over the 
army attitude is apparent in the 
manner in which Marshal Juin, 
France's highest military of-
ficer, was censured by the 
minister. of the army for pub-
licly charging on 26 October 
that De Gaulle's Algerian pol-
icy would encourage the rebels. 
He was told that "it is the 
desire of the government that 
military chiefs remain entirely 
aside from political discus-
sion." 
The French Communist party 
now has come out in favor of 
De Gaulle's Algerian program. 
This about-face probably re-
flects Moscow's current inter-
est in a French-Soviet detente, 
but it also gives the party a 
chance to avoid isolation from 
the center-left in case of a 
rightist rebe  lion on the Al-(b)(3) 
gerian issue. (b)(3)

5 November 1959 
ITALY MAY GRANT TRADE CONCESSIONS TO USSR 
The forthcoming Italian-
Soviet trade talks in Rome will 
provide an opportunity for the 
USSR to secure additional cred-
its in Western Europe. 
On 9 November, an Italian-
Soviet commission is to meet in 
Rome to draw up commodity lists 
for 1960 under the four-year 
trade agreement of December 
1957. According to press re-
ports, the new protocol will 
set a goal of $192,000,000 for 
total trade next year, as com-
pared with a 1959 target of 
$160,000,000, which is not 
likely to be reached. 
The commission is also 
scheduled to examine the possi-
bility of allowing the USSR to 
benefit more extensively under 
existing legislation, which 
permits four-year state guar-
antees of up to 85 percent of 
the credit extended by Italian 
exporters. 
During the past year at 
least $35,000,000 worth of 
private short-term credits, some 
guaranteed by the Italian Gov-
ernment, were extended. A high 
official in the Italian Foreign 
Ministry told the American Em-
bassy late in October that Italian 
press reports that $100,000,000 
had been requested were com-
pletely without foundation. 
Since last spring, Soviet trade 
officials have asked Italian 
firms for substantial credits 
for purchases of chemical plants 
and equipment, threatening, if 
refused, to give the orders to 
other Western European firms. 
Italian Government offi-
cials allege they are opposed 
to guaranteeing deals of private 
firms with the USSR and prefer 
to utilize the government's 
limited export credit resources 
to finance projects in under-
developed areas. They fear, 
however, that domestic firms 
will overextend themselves in 
granting credits to the USSR, 
since other European traders 
continue to grant credits, fre-
quently with government guaran-
tees. Italian legislation is 
still pending to raise the 
ceiling on state guarantees 
for export credits on the 
grounds that Italian exporters 
must be aided to compete with 
more extensive export credit 
systems existing in other West-
ern countries. (b)(3)

Bucharest. A mixed Greek-Ruman-

agreed to a claims settlement 
on 9 February; this was followed 
by an expansion of cultural and 
economic relations. 
Pointing to the French set-

is pushing for expanded trade 
with Sweden, Greece, Britain, 
Italy, and the US. Sweden 
signed a trade agreement with 
Rumania in August cm the assur-

would be completed within a

By holding out the pros-

complete factories, machine 
tools, and other technical 
equipment needed to help meet

The Rumanian policy of 
detente toward Western nations 
has so far had little substance 
outside the economic sphere. 
The possibility of increased 
cultural relations is held out 
by Bucharest as a consequence 
of the new "thaw" in East-West 
relations, but French, Swedish, 
and American experiences strong-
ly suggest that cultural rela-
tions will be stepped up only 
after trade has been substan-
tially expanded. 
Surveillance and strict 
controls continue to be 
maintained over Western diplo-
matic personnel stationed in 
Bucharest. The suddenly friend-
ly official attitude toward 
American representatives in 
the Rumanian capital contrasts 
sharply with Bucharest's propa-
ganda attacks on the US and its 
allies--attacks which follow 
the Soviet lead in every case.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S THIRD FIVE-YEAR PLAN 
As recently outlined by 
planning chief Simunek, direc-
tives for drafting the Czecho-
slovak Third Five-Year Plan 
(1961-65) express President 
Novotny's determination to con-
tinue the rapid build-up of 
heavy industry, recalling in 
many respects Soviet plans of 
the Stalin era. Rapid increas-
es in industrial growth during 
the last three years have prompt-
ed the regime to revise upward 
the preliminary estimate of 
over-all industrial possibili-
ties made public at last year's 
11th party congress. 
Under the new directives, 
industrial production in 1965 
is to double the 1957 level. 
Czechoslovakia's advanced en-
gineering industry is to expand 
twice as fast as originally con-
templated, and higher targets 
are specified for commodities 
basic to industry: steels, fuels, 
electric power, and building 
materials. While output of 
producer goods is to rise 60 
percent between 1961 and 1965, 
that of consumer goods will in-
crease only 30 percent. 
The annual rate of indus-
trial growth during the five-
year plan period will be 8.5 
percent, compared with 10.2 
percent during 1958-60, because 
of more extensive investment in

large-scale, long-term proj-
ects whose full effect on pro-
duction levels will not be felt 
until after 1965. Investment 
will continue to account for a 
high share in the distribution 
of national income, while in-
dustry's portion of total in-
vestment will grow considerably. 
Great capital outlays will 
be tied up in vast new construc-
tion projects for the metallur� 
-
gWiland chemical industries, 
most notably in a giant metal-
lurgical combine near Kosice in 
eastern Slovakia. This combine 
replaces the former "Huko" proj-
ect initiated in 1950 and a-
bandoned two years later as 
economically unsound. 
Planned industrial expan-
sion relies not only on this 
greater investment, but also 
on even larger mcreases in 
labor productivity than sched-
uled under previous plans and 
seldom attained. Yet if labor 
productivity develops unsatis-
factorily, as seems likely, the 
regime could resort, as in the 
past, to above-plan allocations 
of manpower to industry. These 
could, in turn, be damaging to 
the agricultural sector, which 
will probably need more labor 
and capital than the plan now 
provides in order to meet its 
production target of a 40-percent 
increase over 1957. 
Although the plan stipu-
lates a 5.3-percent annual in-
crease in personal consumption 
during 1961-65, it is doubtful 
the regime can fulfill this 
promise because it depends on 
success in the agricultural pro-
gram. The determination with 
which the regime enforces heavy 
industrial priorities may lead 
to further stinting on invest-
ment allocations for consumer-
oriented sectors--including 
housing, where plans vastly 
more ambitious than in the past 
require large investment. The 
outlook for the consumer is 
now one of harder work and slow 
gains in real wages. 
Czechoslovak economic pol--
icy, perhaps the Soviet bloc's 
most "orthodox" and hard-line, 
may promote industrial growth 
at the price of increasing 
consumer dissatisfaction. Any 
serious public discontent as a 
result of slowness in improving 
the level of living would prob-
ably be met with economic con-
cessions, however, even if these 
involved some temporary decline 
in the  rate of industrial 
growth. (Pre-(b)(3)

5 November 1959 
EAST GERMAN CHURCH-STATE STRUGGLE INTENSIFIES 
The Ulbricht regime is pre-
paring to sever the East Ger-
man church from its leadership 
in West Berlin. 
Bishop Dibelius, 79-year-
old president of the Council 
of the Evangelical Church in 
Germany and head of the Ber-
lin-Brandenburg Diocese in East 
Germany, recently asserted in 
an open letter that a Chris-
tian is not obliged to obey any 
laws of a totalitarian state--
including even such ordinances 
as traffic regulations on the 
Berlin autobahn, since they 
might be intended for evil pur-
poses such as starving out West 
Berlin. 
In consequence, he was 
summoned from his residence in 
West Berlin to an interview on 
28 October with the acting may-
or of East Berlin, Waldemar 
Schmidt. According to East 
Berlin newspapers, Schmidt 
charged Dibelius with seeking 
to undermine the legal order 
in East Berlin and stated that 
the bishop had "deprived him-
self of grounds for further 
activity" in the Soviet sector 
of Berlin. 
The Evangelical Church 
leadership in Berlin-Brandenburg 
now is under heavy pressure to 
condemn Dibelius, and an East 
German broadcast of 23 October 
construed an equivocal state-
ment by this group to mean that 
East German churchmen have pub-
licly dissociated themselves 
from their bishop. In an effort 
to enlist sympathy from believ-
ers in East Germany, the Commu-
nists are accenting the tra-
ditional Lutheran view that 
the "state is an expression of 
the will of God" and thus must 
not be resisted. 
The regime has also in-
tensified its efforts to cut 
off travel by East German Prot-
estants to West German church 
functions. It allowed only 
2,000 persons to attend the Evan-
gelical conference (Kirchentag) 
held in Munich in August, in 
contrast with the many thousands 
who were permitted to go in 
past years. The Communists are 
DIBELIUS 
also promoting closer ties be-
tween certain selected East Ger-
man Protestant church leaders--
notably Bishop Moritz Mitzenheim 
of Thuringia--and Orthodox Church 
leaders in the USSR. Mitzenheim 
and other high churchmen visited 
Moscow in September, and Patri-
arch Aleksey of Moscow is slated 
to come to East Berlin next East-
er. 
In expectation of continued 
Communist efforts to divide the 
church, the Berlin-Brandenburg 
Synod last spring--with Dibelius' 
acquiescence--adopted an "empow-
ering clause" designed to enable 
the church leadership in East 
Germany to issue emergency de-
crees if its communications with 
Bishop Dibelius' office in West 
Berlin were cut off. The East German 
press hailed the move as recog-
nition of East German sovereignty; 
West Berlin church officials said

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
many synod members opposed the 
step because it served to under-
mine one of the few remaining 
vestiges of German unity. 
Under steady regime pres-
sure, East German Christians are 
having difficulty maintaining 
their opposition to the Com-
munists. Enrollment for the 
Jugendweihe--the regime's athe-
ist youth indoctrination pro-
gram--has grown to include a 
large proportion of teen-age 
youth. Commenting on declining 
church membership, an East Ger-
man attending the recent Kirch-
entag in Munich declared: "Peo-
ple are falling away like with-
ered leaves." 
In the event the regime 
meets with further significant 
success in gaining the coopera-
tion of the local clergy, it can 
be expected to take steps to 
establish a separate church in 
East Germany. 
THE SITUATION IN CUBA 
The Castro government's 
new mining law and its seizure 
of oil companies' files are 
additional evidence of its dras-
tic approach to economic reforms, 
many of which are badly needed. 
Most of the large and un-
exploited petroleum and miner-
al concessions, as well as the 
mining industry in general, are 
controlled by American interests 
which Cubans feel have not de-
veloped their holdings rapidly 
enough to benefit the economy. 
Alienation of these private 
investors who have been consid-
ered the only source of suffi-
cient capital for developing 
the subsoil resources, and in-
creased government control over 
the economy will probably be 
accompanied by an intensified 
search for European--and pos-
sibly Soviet bloc--technical 
and financial assistance. 
Cuba may be planning to 
resume diplomatic relations with 
the USSR and open trade rela-
(b)(3) 
tions with East Germany. On 
3 November the semiofficial 
daily Revolucion urged that 
Soviet First Deputy Premier 
Mikoyan, who will inaugurate 
the Soviet exhibition in Mexico 
On 22 November, be invited to 
visit Cuba as the first step 
toward renewed relations and 
further trade with the USSR. 
Ambassador Bonsai_ in Havana 
has reported that East German 
economic officials are expected 
in Cuba soon, and he considers 
it quite likely that some rap-
prochement may be contemplated. 
Castro's revival on 29 
October of the revolutionary 
tribunals and the reintroduction 
of the death penalty are again 
arousing unfavorable comment 
In Latin America. Hemisphere 
leaders and newspapers sympa-
thetic to Castro's planned re-
forms and aspirations for Cuba 
have been increasingly critical 
of his excessive and irrational 
actions. 
BOLIVIA 
The conflicting presiden-
tial ambitions of former Presi-
dent Victor Paz Estenssoro and 
Walter Guevara Arze, right-wing 
leader of the ruling Nationalist 
Revolutionary Movement (MNR), 
are causing serious unrest in 
Bolivia. Moderate President 
Siles has apparently swung his 
support from Guevara to Paz; 
(b)(3) 
this is likely to give the 
June 1960 presidential election 
to Paz and the left wing. Left-
wing leaders are frequently 
critical of the United States, 
although a recent oil discovery 
by a US-financed company in Bo-
livia has apparently moderated 
some of their anti-US atti-
tudes.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
Paz has hinted 
that he will choose 
leftist labor lead-
er Juan Lechin--key 
opponent of the US-
backed economic sta-
bilization program--
as his running mate 
at the presidential 
nominating convention 
of the government 
party scheduled to 
open in late December 
or early January. 
Right-wing elements 
probably feel that 
a Paz-Lechin ticket 
will imply a more 
leftist administra-
tion than Bolivia has ever had. 
Right-wingers in desperation 
could resort to an abortive 
coup attempt. Moreover, armed 
violence may break out because 
the police and the civilian 
militia are divided in loyalty. 
In an apparent move to 
placate right-wing elements, 
Siles in late October demanded 
that leftist Jose Rojas, a 
principal leader of the rural 
militia, resign from the cabi-
net. The threatened dismissal 
of Rojas has provoked outbreaks 
of militia violence. Certain 
BRITAIN'S RELATIONS 
Since re-election the Mac-
millan government has given 
priority to improving Britain's 
relations with the six European 
Economic Community (EEC) members. 
Foreign Secretary Lloyd will try 
to promote his plans in a visit 
to Paris on 11-12 November. 
Visits to London are planned by 
West German Chancellor Adenauer 
on 17-18 November and Italian 
Premier Segni on 1-3 December. 
London is apprehensive lest 
the continued strengthening of 
Rojas units have been surrounded 
by opposing forces under a right-
wing rural leader. Each leader 
has the loyalty of 3,000 men. 
The basic militia unit consists 
of a company of about 100 men 
armed with rifles, submachine 
guns, a mortar, and a heavy-
machine-gun section. 
Bolivian Army strength varies 
seasonally between 7,000 and 
12,000. The army tends to be 
loyal to the Sile3 ,overnment 
but would be unable to quell 
widespread of militia 
violence. (b)(3) 
WITH WESTERN EUROPE 
the EEC group further reduces 
British influence on the con-
tinent. Lloyd wants to try to 
"bridge the gap" between the EEC 
and the proposed little free-
trade area (Outer Seven) which 
the UK promotes, rather than 
wait several years as many ob-
servers, including some of his 
own advisers, believe necessary.

consultations on a six-nation 
basis carries the threat to 
British interests one step fur-
ther. Lloyd has suggested _sev-
eral projects which would tend,, 
to increase British partici-
pation in European endeavors 
short of making supranational 
commitments. His expressed de-
sire for closer political coor-
dination and for improved coor-
dination of weapons development 
suggests that he may try to re-
vive the Western European Union, 
the only European organization 
composed of the six EEC coun-
tries plus Britain. 
Lloyd also advocates con-
centrating European institutions 
in one city, but this suggestion 
will be no more welcome now than 
SE 
it was three years ago when 
Europeans suspected that it cloaked 
a scheme to disrupt progress 
on integration. 
The atmosphere for the 
coming visits nevertheless seems 
improved. In a recent Parlia-
mentary debate Lloyd went out 
of his way to kill one source 
of French and German suspicions 
by heaping scorn upon European 
"disengagement." Macmillan's 
cordial response to Adenauer's 
message of congratulations on 
the Conservatives' election 
victory greatly pleased the 
chancellor. De Gaulle, for his 
part, has agreed to pay a state 
visit to the United Kingdom in 
early April. (b)(3)

FACTORS IN THE PROBLEM 
The independence secured 
in 1956 by Morocco and Tunisia 
and the struggle for independ-
ence under way in Algeria are 
leading to serious considera-
tion of the nature of the re-
lations of North African polit-
ical entities with each other 
and with outside blocs. Some 
North African leaders, recall-
ing the medieval Maghreb em-
pires--the Arab "western land" 
consisting of the larger part 
of northwest Africa--have been 
seeking to create a united and 
powerful "Maghreb federation." 
Some of these North Africans 
go further. Recognizing the 
dependence of North Africa on 
France, they envisage an al-
liance between a confederation 
of North African states and 
France, or association with a 
Western European community. 
North Africans planning 
for a Maghreb federation must 
consider a variety of forces, 
attitudes,and traditions which, 
while partially favorable to 
unity, contain elements making 
for disunion. The major inter-
national forces influencing 
such a development would seem 
to be the heritage of French 
control and the continuing 
French economic dominance

Within the Maghreb coun-
tries, the principal currents 
affecting unity seem to stem 
from the appeal of the idea of 
"the Maghreb" as against dis-
parate policies of the individ-
ual North African governments, 
each of which is developing its 
own view of what its relations 
with other states ought to be. 
The French Influence 
France--whose military con-
quest of the Maghreb began in 
Algeria in 1830 and was not con-
cluded until a century later in 
Morocco--imposed its language 
and to some extent its culture 
along the coastal areas. The 
French administrators who fol-
lowed the army and colonists 
superimposed a Western veneer 
on the local subsistence econ-
omies, built European cities 
outside the native quarters,and 
developed the whole area primar-
ily as a source of raw materials 
and markets for France's industries.

1,500,000 in early 1956--con-
trolled the most fertile land 
and held all but the lowliest 
government jobs. While excel-
lent educational facilities 
were developed for Europeans, 
only a relatively few Moslems 
had access to such facilities. 
Although some North Afri-
can Moslems adopted European 
customs, the mode of living of 
the average North African re-
mained largely untouched by 
Western customs or thought un-
til World War I, when North 
African recruits mingled with 
Western soldiers on European 
battlefields. About the same 
time, a few North African na-
tionalists gained hope from 
the concept of self-determina-
tion embodied in President 
Wilson's Fourteen Points. There-
after, the concept of self-
rule and independence snowball-94 
particularly in the early 1930s 
among the handful of North Af-
rican students in Paris. 
These former students are 
today the governmental and po-
litical leaders in Morocco and 
Tunisia and to a lesser extent 
are influential in the Algerian 
National Liberation Front. More-
over, the military leaders of 
the Algerian rebellion are large-
ly former noncommissioned offi-
cers of the French Army, battle 
trained in Europe and Indo-
china. 
The North African govern-
ments retain strong ties to 
France in that their administra-
tive structures are modeled af-
ter that of France and to a 
large extent are staffed by 
French nationals. Their armies 
have been organized, officered, 
and trained by the French. 
French financial and technical 
investment still dominates the 
local economies. North African 
leaders, with few exceptions, 
conduct their business in French 
and wear Western dress. Their 
wives are fast becoming emanci-
pated and are participating in 
public life, even in politics. 
By preference, Western modes 
of life--including television--
are becoming the norm, at least 
for the educated North African 
elite. 
Middle Eastern Influence 
The Arab invaders who over-
ran the area in the seventh and 
eighth centuries quickly imposed 
their language and religion on 
the urbanized residents of the 
Maghreb. The common bond of 
blood, religion, and language 
between Maghrebian and Middle 
Eastern Arabs, however, now 
appears more imaginary than 
real. A North African Arab con-
siders himself essentially a 
Moroccan, Algerian, or Tunisian 
and usually adopts a supercil-
ious attitude toward an eastern 
Arab. Tunisians in particular 
consider themselves superior to 
all other Arabs.

and Kairouan higher than Al-
Azhar in Cairo. 
The North African version 
of spoken Arabic is virtually 
unintelligible to a Middle 
Eastern Arab, but classical 
Arabic is taught in the sbhools 
and is the language of govern-
mental documents in independent 
Tunisia and Morocco and of the 
Arabic language press. Only a 
handful of the present Maghreb-
ian leaders were educated in 
the Middle East. Many of this 
group may maintain ties and 
some degree of affinity toward 
their seat of learning, but 
others--notably Morocco's Allal 
El-Fassi--hawe broken with Cairo. 
A greater number of North Afri-
can youths may now be enrolled 
in Middle East universities 
than heretofore, but the Paris-
or Western-trained youth still 
is the preferred employee. 
The young liberals in Mo-
rocco and Tunisia are pushing 
their governments for closer 
relations with the Arab states. 
These efforts seem designed to 
broaden their countries' con-
tacts and may also stem from 
their intense interest in Mid-
dle Eastern socialistic experi-
ments. One result of these ef-
forts--and those of then Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Jamali.--was 
that in 1958 both Morocco and 
Tunisia joined the Arab League. 
Since then Morocco has 
participated in most league ac-
tivities and, in fact,was host 
to the league's most recent 
regular meeting early in Sep-
tember. Morocco may also be 
taking the lead in an effort 
to increase the influence of 
non-UAR states in the league. 
Nevertheless, Moroccan leaders 
remain principally preoccupied 
with local problems. 
Tunisian President Bour-
guiba apparently joined the 
league mainly as a gesture of 
solidarity with Morocco. He 
immediately challenged Nasir's 
dominance over the league, how-
ever, and when his maneuver was 
censured by the organization, 
used his long-standing quarrel 
with Nasir as an excuse to walk 
out. Bourguiba shows no indi-
cations either of desiring to 
cooperate closely with other 
Arab states or of improving re-
lations with Cairo. 
HABIB BOURGHIBA 
The Algerian rebels, mean-
while, have depended largely on 
the eastern Arab states for fi-
nancial and material support in 
their struggle for independence. 
Like the Moroccans and Tunisians, 
however, the Algerians look a-
skance at what they consider the 
more backward Arabs and espouse 
Western concepts and admire West-
ern techniques. 
Maghrebian Neutralism  
The Moroccan and Tunisian 
governments and the Algerian 
rebels have adopted neutralist 
foreign policies. Morocco, 
taking the lead in establishing 
diplomatic relations with the 
Sino-Soviet bloc last fall,says 
it has a policy of nondependence 
or nonalignment. It recently 
confirmed the imminent exchange 
of ambassadors with Hungary, 
Poland, and Czechoslovakia, 
raising the number of bloc es-
tablishments in Rabat to five.

visits with the bloc and a fas-
cination with economic developments

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
in Communist China, which many 
Moroccans seek to emulate, Mo-
rocco's contacts are still pre-
dominantly with the West. 
Tunisia, on the other 
hand, adopted a policy of non-
engagement after President 
Bourguiba had repeatedly de-
clared himself on the side of 
the West. Bourguiba persisted 
in this policy long after the 
"young Turks" in his entourage 
had pointed out the advantages 
of playing East against West 
to gain essential economic de-
velopment assistance. He di-
rectly tied his policy shift 
to prolonged difficulties with 
France, most of which evolved 
from Tunisia's support of the 
Algerian rebellion. 
Thus far Tunisia has per-
mitted only the establishment 
of a Czech Embassy, with a non-
resident ambassador. There are 
indications, however, that it 
may soon accept a Soviet ambas-
sador. Earlier this year two 
Tunisian secretaries of state 
visited the Soviet Union. Bour-
guiba considers these moves 
merely demonstrations of his 
independence from Western con-
trols, however, and he probably 
will continue to go slow in 
contacts with the bloc. 
Both Morocco and Tunisia 
have substantially increased 
their foreign trade with the 
bloc. Nonetheless, this ex-
panded exchange of commodities 
still remains a small fraction 
of the countries' foreign trade. 
The Algerian rebels, whose 
provisional government has been 
recognized by Communist China 
and the Asian satellites but not 
by the Soviet bloc, maintain 
contacts with the bloc. The 
present moderate rebel leaders 
justify their acceptance of bloc 
training, relief supplies, and 
possibly some materiel as es-
sentiarto continuing their 
struggle, in view of the lack 
of Western support. 
Prospects for Federation  
Common bonds of geographic 
proximity, language, religion, 
and experience as French col-
lonial areas have been forces 
for cohesion in the Maghreb. 
The leaders, who initially 
shared classrooms and dormi-
tories in Paris, have long 
plotted together to achieve 
their objectives. 
In 1958, two years after 
Morocco land Tunisia achieved 
independence, a conference of 
North African political lead-
ers at Tangier created an em-
bryo Maghreb federation and 
established a permanent secre-
tariat in an effort to lay the 
foundations for intra-Maghre-
bian collaboration. Although 
the unity given expression at 
Tangier has not been maintained, 
and although serious rivalries 
and dissensions have developed 
which impede the development of 
a strong and unified Maghreb 
federation, North African poli-
ticians not infrequently extol 
Maghreb solidarity. 
The King and those who 
seek to develop a constitution-
al monarchy in Morocco fear 
that antimonarchist forces in 
Morocco were encouraged by the 
abolition of the Tunisian mon-
archy in 1957. They regard 
with suspicion all efforts by 
Bourguiba to expand his influ-
ence within the Maghreb or to 
pose as the principal North 
African spokesman. The Tuni-
sians, on the other hand, re-
gard with dismay the disunity 
among Moroccan political groups. 
The Tunisians see the forces 
for instability in Morocco as 
an invitation for the extension 
of Communist influence. 
Both governments are also 
jealously watchful of each 
other's relations with France. 
Mohamed V, maintaining a more 
harmonious relationship with 
Paris than the outspoken Bour-
guiba, was notably piqued last 
year when Tunisia obtained a 
commitment from France to evacu-
ate all its bases in Tunisia 
save Bizerte. French troops 
remain scattered throughout 
Morocco, and Rabat still 
presses for total evacua-
tion.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
The Moroccans and partic-
ularly the Tunisians--despite 
massive assistance to the Al-
gerian rebels--fear the crea-
tion of a powerful, indepen-
dent Algeria which might seek 
to dominate its neighbors. 
For that reason Bourguiba has 
pressed the rebels to follow 
his example in accepting less 
than total independence and in 
keeping close ties with France. 
The Algerians, for their 
part, are irritated by Bour-
guiba's pressures, his unso-
licited advice, and the fact 
that he has occasionally been 
swayed by Tunisia's national 
interests to take steps con-
trary to their interests. They 
have not forgiven his agree-
ment giving a French company 
transit rights for a pipeline 
transporting Saharan oil, and 
they resent Tunisian and Mo-
roccan pretensions to portions 
of the Sahara. 
In light of these consid-
erations, therefore, the fed-
eration set up 18 months ago 
in Tangier seems unlikely to 
Covelop soon into a meaningful 
boiiy. Its existence, however, 
has a symbolic utility which 
may on occasion be exploited 
by Maghreb politicians. 
Alliance With the West 
A united Maghreb, closely 
tied to Paris, has a certain 
appeal to French officials 
groping for a solution to the 
Algerian problem and desiring 
to retain France's dominant 
role in Morocco and Tunisia. 
A union would also complete 
the north-south axis between 
the African members of the 
French Community and continent-
al France and would round out a 
large sphere of French culture 
and economic leadership. Regard-
less of these potential bene-
fits, Paris does not appear. to 
be pushing for a united Maghreb. 
French relations with Morocco 
and Tunisia have improved some-
what from their recent low 
points, but mutual distrust is 
still strong. 
Before he came to power, 
De Gaulle was believed to fa-
vor the establishment of a 
North African federation linked 
to France in a manner that 
would permit French control of 
the federation's military and 
foreign policies. He has not 
pushed this idea, and his pro-
gram of 16 September for Al-
geria seems to point toward a 
separate identity outside the 
Maghreb for the Algerian de-
partments--possibly in associa-
tion with the French Community 
or conceivably even as an in-
dependent state. The possi-
bility remains, however, that 
the question of Maghreb soli-
darity may be reconsidered by 
the French after the promised 
Algerian referendum. 
North African leaders, 
recognizing their indebtness 
to and dependence on France, 
have also envisioned a loose 
union with France. President 
Bourguiba, with doubtful sin-
cerity, has even gone one step 
further and offered to relin-
quish some of Tunisia's sover-
eignty if France would recog-
nize an independent Algeria 
within a Maghreb federation 
allied with France. 
The North Africans' sensi-
tivities to anything remotely 
resembling a negation of their 
sovereignty and independence, 
however, probably would inhibit 
an alliance with France alone. 
The Moroccans and Tunisians, 
in applying for affiliation 
with the Organization for Euro-
pean Economic Cooperation and 
the Common Market, have indi-
cated a desire to diversify 
their contacts by dealing with 
all the West. Both Morocco and 
Tunisia have strongly resented 
French financial and military 
pressures and seek to thwart 
the continuance of France's 
strangle over their economies and 
armies by diversification of 
their independence among, main-
ly, all Western sources. Any 
new kind of relationship would 
seem to be for the more distant 
rather than the immediate fu-
ture. (b)(3)

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
THE FRENCH COMMUNITY IN EVOLUTION 
The French Community, just 
over a year old, seems about 
to undergo far-reaching struc-
tural changes which the French 
hope will encourage present 
members to remain and perhaps 
will even attract new ones. In 
the face of rising African 
nationalism, Paris has recent-
ly officially accepted the con-
cept of an evolving Community 
in which powers now exercised 
by France through the Community 
machinery will eventually be 
turned over to the individual 
member states, 
A Community of 
states with varying 
degrees of autonomy 
but oriented toward 
France and the West 
may ultimately pro-
vide a legal frame-
work for solving the 
problem of Algeria 
if De Gaulle's pre-
ference for a loose 
French-Algerian as-
sociation is real-
ized. Prospects 
for lasting politi-
cal ties in the Com-
munity are not good 
however. 
Paris' Position 
Even before 
coming to power, 
De Gaulle charac-
terized his colonial 
views as "midway 
between those who want to change 
nothing and thosewho want to 
abandon everything," and his 
original concept of the French 
Community--which has replaced 
the old French Union--was de-
signed to embody this. Never-
theless, De Gaulle's initial 
preoccupation with Community 
institutions and his reportedly 
highhanded brushing aside of 
African nationalist leaders 
who publicly advocated a more 
flexible organization seemed 
designed to freeze the Commu-
nity's original structure for 
an indefinite period. 
In the official communiqu�
following the last Community 
Executive Council meeting on 10 
and 11 September, however, 
De Gaulle underlined the "evo-
lutionary character" of the Com-
munity, noting that the develop-
ment of the structure of the 
states would determine the evo-
lution. This publicly confirmed 
a new tack in French official 
thinking since the previous 
council meeting in July, when 
leaders of the Mali Federa-
tion--comprising the republics 
of Senegal and Soudan--began

found De Gaulle unwilling even

The fact that the sharp 
cleavages among West-African 
Community leaders earlier in the 
summer now have been smoothed 
over is the best evidence that 
a top-level decision has been 
made in Paris on the evolution 
of the Community. Senegal Pre-
nier Mamadou Dia set the new 
tone in an article in the in-

ably not yet receiv-

the broad lines of development

to their own powers and those--

in practice exercised by 
Paris. 
The French apparently 
envisage granting certain of 
the Community powers to the 
member states on an individ-
ual basis under Article 78 of 
the French Constitution, which 
provides that "special agree-
ments may create other common 
jurisdictions or regulate any 
transfer of jurisdiction from 
the Community to one of its 
members."

the Mali Federation. Other 
Community members, particularly 
the more developed states of 
West Africa, will probably 
soon be under native national-

accommodations with France.

The constitution also 
provides for new Community

prospects would be the French

to gain their independence in 
1960. There is also evidence 
that France may hope ultimately 
to attract Morocco and Tunisia. 
In these cases, however, the 
ties would probably amount 
to little more than economic

agreements or a more formal-
ized membership in the franc 
zone. 
A Place for Algeria  
The concept of a 0:immuni-
ty embodying a variety of re-
lationships appeals to some 
Frenchmen as a possible way 
out of the increasingly harsh 
dilemma posed by the Algerian 
situation. Having previously 
promised Algeria a "choice 
place" in the Community, De 
Gaulle in his 16 September 
proposal of three possible 
alternatives included inde-
pendence and integration among 
them but laid special emphasis 
on a form of French-Algerian 
association which could be 
adapted to the Community. He 
envisaged "a government of Al-
geria by Algerians, bolstered 
with French aid and in close 
union with France for economic, 
educational, defense, and for-
eign affairs." 
Under this alternative, 
De Gaulle also noted the "ne-
cessity of organizing Algeria 
internally along federal lines 
"so that the various communi-
ties can have a framework for 
cooperation." Such a federal 
state within a multirelation-
ship Community would maintain 
Algeria as a political entity 
while simultaneously providing 
the legal framework for firm 
French control of certain parts 
--e.g., the coastal cities and 
the oil-rich Sahara. 
If, however, De Gaulle 
moves too rapidly to tie his 
preferred Algerian solution to 
the Community,it would exacer-
bate long-standing disagree-
ments among the French on the 
extent to which native nation-
alist aspirations can be satis-
fied without losing effective 
control over the African areas. 
Proponents of a place for 
Algeria in the Community'would 
probably feel this problem ob-
liged them to wove slowly in 
implementing the planned trans-
fer of Community powers to the 
individual states. Prolonging 
this process, however, would 
run the risk of irritating the 
African member states to the 
point that some would decide 
on complete withdrawal from the 
Community. Furthermore, only a 
relatively solid Community,with 
safeguards on continued French 
control of key areas of Algeria 
should it become a member,would 
have a chance of gaining accept-
ance of French rightists. 
Prospects  
Even the French leaders 
who favor a loose Community of 
varying relationships as the 
only means of retaining French 
influence in Africa may not be 
as sanguine about its dura-
bility as they profess. They 
are apparently gambling, how-
ever, that native nationalist 
forces will be satisfied with 
the new arrangements long 
enough to allow the economic 
benefits of Community member-
ship to become apparent and 
thus engender continued and 
willing native participation. 
There may also be the hope 
that if such future states 
as Togo and Cameroun choose 
to associate with the French 
Community, this will counter-
act some of the other external 
African nationalist influences 
on the Community states. 
Nevertheless, it appears 
unlikely that African nation-
alist fervor can be dampened 
more than temporarily by any 
French-proposed association, 
however liberal. Furthermore, 
the cost of an economic aid 
program sufficient to en-
courage continued membership 
in the Community would be 
prohibitive for France alone. 
With the French budget already 
strained to meet present 
commitments, Paris can be ex-
pected to look for outside 
contributions that would be 
channeled through expanded--
and French-controlled--pro-
grams such as the Constan-
tine Plan and the other 
Afriean investmpnt programs.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
SOVIET REACTION TO THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION IN MOSCOW 
The American exhibition. 
which concluded its six-week 
showing in Moscow's Sokolniki 
Park on 4 September, was the 
object of continuous intense 
interest and curiosity, despite 
strenuous Soviet efforts to 
undermine its impact. Well 
over two million Soviet citizens 
attended. Their reaction ap-
pears to have been one of 
general approval, although 
there was some disappointment 
about the organization of the 
fair and the type and quality 
of some of the goods displayed. 
Those who came, whether or 
not they liked all they saw, 
by and large went away with a 
greater understanding of the 
United States. The fair's 
success in this respect appears 
to have been due as much to the 
contacts between American 
guides and Soviet visitors as 
to the exhibits themselves. 
The exhibition was the 
most exciting and talked-about 
event in Moscow during the sum-
mer. There was an intense de-
sire among all levels of Soviet 
society to attend. The people 
were proud of having seen it 
themselves or of knowing some-
one who had. The US exhibition

a prestige symbol and are still 
frequently worn in public. 
Many people were exposed 
for the first time to something 
other than the propaganda mono-
logue of their own regime. Re-
gardless of whether reactions 
were negative or positive, each 
visitor carried away an impres-
sion of a different type of 
society from his own. Given the 
Russians' limitless curiosity 
about all things American, it 
can be assumed that the fair 
whetted their craving for more 
information about the United 
States and closer contacts with 
Americans. 
The impact of the fair 
was felt throughout the Soviet 
Union. Exhibition pins have 
been seen in such distant 
places as eastern Siberia, 
Estonia, and Armenia. There 
are also numerous reports that 
exhibition pamphlets, frayed 
and dog-eared, are being cir-
culated in widely scattered 
areas. 
The exhibition unquestion-
ably added impetus to the gen-
eral desire of the Soviet public 
for more and better consumer 
goods. It is widely rumored in 
Moscow that the American exhibi-
tion was responsible 
for the recent introduc-
tion of installment 
buying in Moscow. It 
is said that after the 
exhibition opened, 
thousands of letters 
poured into municipal 
offices demanding that 
installment buying be 
introduced. There is 
no basis to this rumor, 
since credit buying has 
been on its way--by ex-
perimental stages--since 
last February; it is in-
teresting, however, that 
so many Muscovites are 
associating the innova-
tion with the fair.

Demonstrations of Ready Mixes and Frozen Foods. 
Official recognition of 
the demand for consumer goods 
has already been evident in 
the sudden, increased attention 
given to Western display tech-
niques and American-style ap-
pliances. The recent govern-
ment decree calling for the 
improvement and increased pro-
duction of certain consumer 
goods seems clearly to carry 
the stamp of the fair's influ-
ence. 
Efforts to Discredit Fair  
The regime's attitude 
toward the fair remained of-
fically correct throughout, 
but unofficially every effort 
was made to discredit it and 
divert public atten-
tion. The main at-
tack--waged in the 
Soviet press--got 
under way well be-
fore the exhibition 
opened. Day after 
day the press hammered 
away at unemployment 
and at job, educa-
tion, and race dis-
crimination in the 
United States. The 
carping tone contin-
ued into the opening 
weeks of the fair, 
as the press endeav-
ored to "correct" 
the "false" picture 
presented of life in 
the United States. 
SE 
The announcement 
on 3 August of the im-
pending exchange of 
visits between Premier 
Khrushchev and Presi-
dent Eisenhower marked 
a turning point. The 
disparagement campaign 
slackened in the face 
of the effort to em-
phasize the prospects 
for improved US-Soviet 
relations. Press 
criticism continued but 
usually was placed in 
a setting which stressed 
the advantage of in-
creased exchanges. 
Criticism of the fair 
and harassment of its officials 
was carried on inside the fair-
grounds by thousands of party 
and Komsomol members who served 
as agitators. Apparently they 
were instructed to criticize 
specific aspects of the exhibi-
tion, express their disappoint-
ment over the lack of technolog-
ical displays, and laugh at the 
modern art. More serious, how-
ever, were their efforts to 
neutralize the effectiveness 
of the Russian-speaking guides 
by bombarding them with 
provocative questions, tying 
them up in involved technical 
discussions, and generally con-
founding their work.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY 'SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
During the first few days, 
over half of the visitors ap-
peared to be agitators. They 
were quickly spotted, however, 
and the reaction of the other 
Soviet visitors more often 
than not was hostile toward 
them. The number of agitators 
soon decreased markedly, prob-
ably due as much to the realiza-
tion that their efforts were 
backfiring as to the improved 
climate of US-Soviet relations. 
Competitive Attractions  
With the opening of the 
exhibition, Moscow blossomed 
with new attractions of its 
own, designed to distract the 
public from the fair. The 
Soviet Government apparently 
felt it necessary to show that 
it could do as well as the 
Americans. 
A Soviet consumer goods 
display was opened in an 
adjacent section of Sokolniki 
Park the day before the US 
exhibition opened. The Soviet 
counterpart was an obvious and 
almost ludicrous copy, complete 
with its own aluminum roof and 
smiling girls demonstrating 
electric stoves and shining 
cars. It was so located as 
to catch the attention of those 
waiting in line to get tickets 
to the US exhibition. A giant 
bazaar, where scarce consumer 
goods were offered for sale, 
was opened in another part of 
Moscow at about the same time. 
Control of Soviet Visitors  
Distribution of tickets 
to the fair was tightly con-
trolled by the regime. Initial-
ly, all tickets were distributed 
to district party committees, 
which in turn allotted them to 
the factories and offices under 
their jurisdiction. Numerous 
reports indicate that the pulk 
of tickets went to party mem-
bers and various other favored 
groups. The demand for tickets 
far surpassed the supply, and 
the discriminatory distribution 
policy was a source of frustra-
tion and bitterness to many 
Russians. 
Some tickets were eventually 
put on "public" sale each day 
at Sokolniki Park. A person 
trying to avail himself to this 
service, however, had to line 
up for a screening check before 
proceeding to the ticket office. 
This procedure could take as 
long as five hours, and there 
was no guarantee that tickets 
would still be available. 
Inside the fair a careful 
watch was maintained over 
the citizenry. Security of-
ficials circulated among the 
crowd, and it was not unusual 
to see someone who had been 
"indiscreet" tapped on the 
shoulder and called aside for 
a little "chat." 
One of the methods the 
regime used to harass visitors 
was to prohibit the installation 
of any toilet facilities in the 
exhibition building. 
Effects of These Measures  
The opinions of many 
visitors were molded by the 
line taken in the press, but 
there is strong evidence that 
the belittling propaganda and 
control measures were in many 
important respects backfiring. 
One Soviet citizen remarked ' 
that here wag an example of a 
high-level decision overzeal-
ously carried out by second-
level officials. 
The campaign helped hold 
the ideological line, but it 
was not successful in imposing" 
a negative image of the United 
States upon the Soviet public 
at large. There appears to 
have been in some instances a 
direct correlation between 
press criticism of certain 
displays and public interest 
in them. The popularity of the 
Family of Man photographic dis-
play was assured after Izvestia  
ran an article objecting to some 
of the photographs.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
The constant harping in the 
Soviet press on such American 
problems as unemployment 
prompted Soviet visitors to ask 
questions which enabled the 
American guides to reply with 
the American side of the ques-
tion. An explanation of un-
employment insurance, for in-
stance, took most people by 
surprise and probably shook a 
few misconceptions. 
Popular Reactions  
Popular reactions to the 
fair varied widely, depending 
Shoe Display. 
on prior expectations and the 
level of education and degree 
of knowledge of the West. In 
general, the people were im-
pressed but not ecstatic over 
what they saw. While numerous 
individuals were obviously de-
lighted and amazed, there is 
also good evidence that in many 
others appreciation was mixed 
with disappointment. 
Many people had developed 
such extravagant expectations 
of what the Americans would 
show them that the real thing 
was bound to fall short. There 
was apparently a widespread 
craving to see the full panoply 
of American luxuries--an element 
which was deliberately muted. 
Many visitors were heard to com-
plain, "Why haven't you shown 
us your best?" 
While the constant criticism 
of the lack of examples of Ameri-
can technology was in large meas-
ure officially inspired, there 
appears to have been some genuine 
disappointment. Most visitors 
were well aware of American 
technological achievements and 
had expected to be impressed. 
Many visitors were bewildered 
by what seemed to be the fair's 
lack of direction, focus, and ex-
planation. The Soviet people 
are accustomed to hard selling 
and heavy-banded exhibitions 
where visitors are carefully 
herded, told what they are 
looking at, why they are looking 
at it, and what they should 
think about it. Many members 
of the Soviet intelligentsia, 
however, found the light holiday 
mood and freedom to wander and 
discover for themselves refresh-
ing and the feature which im-
pressed them most. 
Reaction to Specific Displays  
The most popular displays 
were the automobile, Circarama 
--the 360-degree screen tour 
of the US, and color television 
and the Family of Man. By all 
accounts, however, the American 
guides ranked as high or even 
higher than the exhibits. The 
craving of Soviet citizens.for 
contact with Americans made the 
guides focal points of interest. 
Their ability to speak Russian, 
their candor and general knowledge 
won them unstinting praise. 
"Wonderful lads are your guides," 
reads one entry in the remark 
book. 
There is no question about 
the appeal of the American auto-
mobiles. Individuals who could 
otherwise find nothing

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY 
5 November 1959 
complimentary to say about the 
fair made an exception in this 
case. Among the "technical 
marvels" which the average vis-
itor had so hoped to see, Cir-
carama impressed almost every-
one with both its mechanical 
perfection and its content, and 
color television was a smash hit. 
The Family of Man exhibi-
tion may have had the greatest 
impact, particularly with the 
better educated. Nearly every-
one was moved by the human 
appeal of the photographs, 
and there is reason to believe 
that this exhibit's message 
became associated with US pol-
icy as a whole. Other well-
received exhibits were the mod-
el house, demonstration kitchen, 
and book corner. (b)(3)
