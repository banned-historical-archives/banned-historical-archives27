 The Politics of Agriculture
 The Chinese, who have not boon insisting on
 rigid formulas in the face of diminishing agricultural
 returns, have recently been paying unusual attention
 to farm production.  The note of concern and practi-
 cality  that  runs through articles and broadcasts pre-
 ceding the spring planting can be attributed to last
 year's disappointing harvest.  Much of the problem
 was simply the natural calamities that hit most of
 Asia, but the Chinese are also hinting that misman-
 agemont and inefficiency wore partially at fault.
 Still, no scapegoats have been singled out, and
 cadres have been warned not to blame agricultural
 shortcomings on the "swindlers" who got blamed for
 most other problems.
 A report on agriculture given to the Iiupeh Pro-
 vincial Party Committee by its first secretary typi-
 fies the increased emphasis on agriculture.   In the
 past, the provinces have been content to rely on
 verbal exhortation.  This year, Hupen not only plans
 to send an unusually high-level group of cadres to
 rural areas to ensure vigorous spring farming efforts,
 but also calls for the reduction of study meetings,
 increased technological training, and the rehabilita-
 tion of veteran cadre.
 It is inconceivable that Hupeh would dare to
 espouse such sensitive policies without the prior
 approval of Peking.  Other provinces have made similar
 statements, although not in such detail or at such
 length.  The February issue of Red Flag, the frequently
 pedantic party theoretical journal, weighed in with an
 article on the subject.  Unlike most Red Flag articles,
 which are graced with seemingly endless paragraphs
 of esoteric ideological argument, this piece was con-
 spicuous for its straightforward, practical approach
 to farming.  The article carries weight because its
 author is the party secretary of Tachai production
 brigade, the national agricultural model.

 A number of factors will, of course, influence
 the harvest.  Chinese investment in agriculture ap-
 parently is increasing, but its affect will not be
 very noti.oablo thin year.  More important for a good
 harvest will be the successful implementation of the
 more moderate approach to agriculture.  Those policies
 have been popular with the peasants, but occasionally
 have boon politically dangerous for the cadre who
 must enforce them.   Poking broadcasts indicate that
 the central leadership is making some attempt to calm
 the justifiably nervous officials and assure them
 that they run no risk by pushing current policies.
 Still, the most important influence on the likely to be Mother Nature.

 Ho Tam' n Travels
 After having spent the 9-14 February period in
 Peking, North Korean Foreign Minister l1o Tam stopped
 there again on 20-21 February on route home from
 Pakistan.  While he only stayed overnight, he was
 troatod very warmly and was again received by Chou
 En-lass this despite the fact that he had seen Chou
 only the week before and Ghat a reception by Foreign
 Minister Chi Pang-fei would have mot all protocol
 requirements.
 There is little doubt that Chou Is gesture was
 made in the hope of assuaging to some extent Ho Tam's
 ruffled feelings.  He had come to Peking in an effort
 to obtain stronger backing for North Korea's inten-
 sified propaganda effort to label the presence of US
 forces in South Korea the "sole" obstacle to Korean
 unification.   He received nothing of the kind.   In
 fact, the joint communique issued at the conclusion
 of his initial visit was extremely bland and contained
 only the most pro forma demands for US withdrawal.
 Moreover, after the initial visit NCNA singled out
 Seoul rather than Washington as the root cause of
 blocked progress.  NCNA went So far as to paraphrase
 Pyongyang's harsh anti-US statements, but substituted
 "South Korea" for "US."
 Since the Tam trips were just prior to and during
 the visit of Dr. Kissinger to Peking, Peking's be-
 havior toward the North Korean foreign minister was
 a not too subtle reminder of how highly the Chinese
 value their developing relationship with the US.   In-
 deed, the Chinese are probably counseling the North
 Koreans to pursue with patience a policy of moderation,
 while improving Sino-US relations and the winding down
 of the US military involvement in Indochina contribute

 to a decrease in tension throughout Asia.  As this oc-
 curs, the Chinese probably argue, a decrease in US
 forces in the area will follow.  Until such time the
 Chinese are taking a vary relaxed attitude toward the
 presence of US forces in Korea, to the apparent
 chagrin of Pyongyang.
 The Chinese can also argue that US troops in
 South Korea are there as part of a "containment"
 of China that might be considered irrelevant in
 Washington in the current context.  Peking's diplomacy,
 the argument runs, may be able to got the troops re-
 moved; Moscow does not have this card to play.  So
 long an this remains so, China can afford to snub the
 Koreans occasionally.   Such discord between the Chinese
 and North Koreans is at most relatively minor in a
 relationshi  that has in fact become closer over the
 past year.

 Who Commands t he PLA?
 A contradiction has developed in Chinese domes-
 tic propaganda over the question of who is to be
 portrayed as the head of the Peoples Liberation Army.
 One version describes the PLA as "founded and led by
 our great loader Chairman Moo," while the second
 adds to that "and the Chinese Communist Party."
 The evolution of the who-conunands-the-army quest on
 strongly suggests that those phrases reflect a sen-
 sitive political issue.
 Before the purge of former defense minister Lin
 Piao, the PLA was routinely described as founded and
 led by Mao and, directly commanded by Lin.  After
 Lin's removal, the PLA was "founded and commanded" by
 Mao.   This formulation prevailed until Army Day 1972,
 when the joint editorial and do facto defense minister
 Yeh Chien-ying's speech both added the phrase "and
 the CCP."   This usage has been generally applied
 ever since.  A number of provinces have, on occasion,
 fallen back to describing the PLA as commanded by
 Mao alone, but most follow the "Mao and the CCP"
 model.
 This formulation appears to be part of a de-
 liberate diminution of the Chairman's public eminence.
 In the ideological sphere, the phrase "Mao Tse-tung
 Thought" is frequently replaced by "Marxist-Leninism-
 Mao Tse-tung Thought."  Likewise, once singular ref-
 erences to Mao now often take the form of "Mao and
 the CCP," or "Mao and the Party Center."
 While the shift is in keeping with an emphasis
 on collective leadership and serves to prepare the
 way for a China after Mao, it may also be a manifes-
 tation of the behind-the-scenes political struggle
 in Peking.  Official documents detailing Lin Piao's
 alleged crimes make the point that the old formula-
 tion describing the PLA as led by Mao but directly

 commanded by Lin was a weapon in the former defense
 minister's effort to consolidate his power; indeed,
 Mao himself, in the  course of one of his speeches in
 the summer of 1971, refers to this phrase as a Lin
 maneuvor.  Thus, while it is unlikely that anyone
 would be foolhardy enough to attack the Chairman
 directly, the addition of the clause "and the CC1?"
 could mean that some leaders at the center may be
 using a similar tack to deflate Mao's public image
 as a means of reducing his still considerable polit-
 ical authority.

 The "Year of Europe"
 China's strong interest in Western European
 affairs was again demonstrated last week.  NCNA en-
 thusiastically praised President Nixon's statement
 that 1973 will be the "year of Europe" for US policy,
 noting the President had also said that Washington
 would continue to place "enormous emphasis" on Asian
 affairs, including the dialogue with China.
 Peking continued its efforts to expand trade
 ties with Western Europe.  Three fertilizer plants
 with a total value of over $30 million were purchased
 by the Chinese from a Dutch-based engineering firr,,

 Over the past year the Chinese have devoted an
 increasing amount of their diplomatic energies to
 West European affairs.  Not only are they seeking to
 re-establish normal relations there, but they are
 also alarmed at the trend toward further detente in
 Europe, especially by the prospects for the confer-
 ence on European security which Peking sees as a
 Soviet plot.  The Chinese believe that any further
 relaxation of West Europe's guard against Moscow
 will give the Soviets a freer hand on the Eastern
 front.   In this context, Peking would like to see
 Washington place renewed emphasis on the US role in
 Europe, particularly its role as the dominant power
 in NATO,  and the NCNA headlines on a "Year of Europe"
 are clearly a reflection of this desire.

 Lin with being an ultra-leftist.
 A flurry of provincial broadcasts, probably
 guidance from Peking, says it iswrong to regard Lin's
 crimes as ultra-leftist.  The broadcasts confess that
 Lin not only appeared to be an ultra-leftist" on
 some issues and at some times," but occasionally did
 carry out an ultra-leftist line.  A recent broadcase
 from Szechwan explained that "the true nature of this
 line is ultra-rightist, not ultra-leftist."  The
 basic reason for this confusion is that official
 charges against Lin cover the entire political spec-
 trum, linking him with the rightist "revisionist"
 policies of Liu Shao-chi (many of which are back in
 vogue today), as well as blaming him for the radical
 excesses of the Cultural Revolution.
 Official charges aside, Lin's record put him
 solidly in the leftist camp.   The denials in the
 media of his ultra-leftism and the emphasis on his
 so-called "rightist" crimes seem designed to take
 the heat off the leftists.  While this could be a
 conciliatory gesture by the moderates, the new line
 is more likely the work of those closely associated
 with the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, possibly
 under the direction of party propagandist Yao Wrn-yuan.
 The campaign against ultra-rightists  is accompanied
 by a new, more defensive line on the Cultural Revo-
 lution.   Several radio broadcasts have called for

 When Left is Right and Right is Wrong
 More confusion has been added to the protracted
 campaign to criticize Lin Piao.  After denouncing him
 for over a year as an ultra-leftist, the party now
 claims that Lin was not an ultra-leftist but an
 "ultra-rightist."  The term first appeared around
 the end of the year, but                                      25X1

 ring.  Thu present propaganda initiative seems to be
 a rear-guard action on the part of those who may be
 afraid they will be tarred w4.th the same bru.ih Lin

 Zayyat'n Coming
 The Chinese will play host to Egyptian Foreign
 Minister Zayyat starting March 11.  The visit is the
 first by a high-ranking Egyptian official since Presi-
 dent Sadat's ouster of the Soviet military mission
 last July.  The Chinese, who welcomed Sadat's move,
 have proceeded cautiously since than in exploiting
 Moscow's loss.   In largo part this caution probably
 reflects Peking's realization that it is incapable
 of replacing the USSR as Egypt's benefactor.  Chinese
 leaders quickly congratulated Sadat on his defense of
 Egyptian national sovereignty, but by just as quickly
 bemoaning China's own economic underdevelopment, Poking
 officials from Chou En-lai on down impressed upon the
 Egyptians that Peking's ability to aid them materially
 is very limited.  An exchange of visits by Chinese and
 Egyptian industrial experts in August and December 1972
 suggests that at most some of the $65 million in
 credits left over from earlier loans may be released
 to help the Egyptians develop light industry.  II
 Nevertheless, the Chinese are interested in
 maintaining a dialogue t,!ith Cairo as part of their
 effort to combat Soviet influence.  As reported in
 the Cairo press, Chou's remarks to Cairo journalist
 Muhammad Heykal last month added up to a severe
 critique of Soviet policy in the Middle East.   For
 example, Chou told Heykal that on Middle Eastern
 matters, Brezhnev was even weaker than Khrushchev
 had been in 1967.  Brezhnev, Chou said, faces the
 US as a mouse faces a cat.
 Chou also dropped several remarks on the general
 Middle East situation.  Reiterating China's support

 for the Arabs, Chou agreed with Heykal that a politi-
 cal solution would involve the element of force.
 Chou's remarks were matter of fact, however, rind did
 not appear to encourage Arab bellicosity.  Rather,
 his heavy stress on the necessity for a strong,
 united home front in Egypt carried with it the im-
 plication that, before embarking on further efforts
 against Israel, Egypt must put its own house in order
 and work for Arab unity.  This advice, which would
 preclude Arab military action for the time being,
 echoes counsel of vice Foreign Minister Ho Ying in
 December 1972 that Egypt should accompany its prepara-
 tion for battle "by serious action in the political
 and diplomatic fields."   In fact, the Chinese, who
 can rend a travel itinerary an wall an the next man,
 recognize that the recent trips of prominent Arabs
 to Moscow and Washington--not to mention Mrs. Moir's
 visit last week--may presage a new diplomatic attempt

 New L?"mphanin on T:xportine
 The recent broadcast of two V op t r: 'a  i'a # l2g
 articles  by Radio Poking indicates that the Chinese
 are contemplating a return to factory management
 techniques used before the Cultural Revolution. The
 articles convey this idea by praising management
 practices initiated by the party committee of Talion
 Stool Mill--a model unit whose name lands authority
 to the changes.  According to 1'aopia'a Ur'-,;.1y, the
 reduction wan accomplished by sending ordinary
 workers back to production tasks while retaining
 "indispensable specialist management personnel."
 Moreover, the paper attributed the mill's increased
 production to appointing people with "higher con-
 sciousness, greater dynamism, and richer experience...
 to leading and directing posts."  By and large, those
 persons seem to be the once-disgraced veteran man-
 agers.
 Over-reliance on expertise was severely criti-
 cized during the Cultural Revolution.  The economic
 planners in Poking may view a return to skilled man-
 agement as a moans of overcoming inefficiency.  The
 planners may be only partially correct in their be-
 lief that by enhancing the authority of management
 specialists most of the bottlenecks can be removed,
 but the increased emphasis on skills and experienced
 personnel will make possible a freer, loss dogmatic
 approach to management.
 It is unlikely, however, that the now freedom
 will be fully exercised as long an the average of-
 ficial remains uncertain about the life of the policy.
 Ila knows too well its past history, and as long an
 the pol1.tical situation in Poking remains unsettled,
 the central government will have difficulty getting
 him to implement  urge-prone programs with vigor.

 ANNEX
 A Succession Preview: Who's Who
 The downfall of Mao's chosen heir Lin Piao in
 September 1971 reopened the succession question.
 Since that time, the leadership has boon pondering
 the transfer of authority upon the death of China's
 aging leaders---particularly party Chairman Mao Tso-
 tung, 79, and Premier Chou En-lei, 74--and has shown
 interest in bringing younger party members into the
 leadership.  The succession question has become a
 favorite topic of conversation among Chinese at every
 level and is oven raised with foreign visitors.
 As matters stand now, the sudden departure of
 either Mao or Chou would probably not cause wide-
 spread or prolonged turmoil.  Mao's death could
 actually smooth the way for an easy transition
 Before the Cultural Revolution, there were four
 vice chairman, but at the Ninth Party Congress in 1969,
 Lin was named the sole vice chairman.  As a result the
 party is now without a vice chairman.  The selection
 of a vice chairman will be one of the first orders
 of business at the Tenth Party Congress.  Unless the
 congress opts for a "collective leadership"--much dis-
 cussed since Lin's departure--the person chosen will
 replace Mao as head of the party.   In the meantime,
 Mao still must approve all major personnel appoint-
 ments, and getting his agreement on a slate of can-
 didates, particularly on possible vice-chairmen, is
 probably one of the problems holding up the party
 congress.
 If Mao should die before a tenth congress is
 convened, the whole process of personnel election

 Approved
 could wall be greatly facilitated.  The congrana prob-
 ably would be called soon after his death.  The leader-
 ship might choose to elevate one of the non-controversial
 honorary alders on the currant Politburo, possibly
 old marshal Chu Toh, to act as temporary chairman.
 Something similar was done a year ago when the 87-
 yoar-old Tung Pi-wu was named acting head of state.
 With Chu in the chair, the day-to-day affairs of the
 party would probably be overseen by a group including
 Chou En-lai and possibly Shanghai party boss Chang
 Chun-chiao and the do facto defense minister, Yoh
 Chian-ying.
 If Mao Dies First
 If Premier Chou were to outlive Mao, it would
 probably make little difference, over the short run
 at least, who succeeds Mao as party chairman.  The
 major burden of running the country has been on Chou's
 shoulders since, and oven during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion.  After Mao's death, China would continue along
 the course Chou has sot, and it might well move faster.
 Chou himself is likely to shun the party chair-
 manship, although presumbably he could have it, if
 he so desired.  The Premier is an administrator, not
 a theoretician, and is perfectly suited to keep the
 machinery of government running smoothly.  He has an
 almost endless capacity for work, carrying a load
 which would stagger many a younger man.  Chou has
 never shown any particular interest in being party
 chairman, and t'-:alt is probably one reason he con-
 tinues to be trusted by Mao, who has disposed of
 many other comrades.  After Mao is gone, Chou might
 well prefer to be the power behind the throne than
 to occupy it himself.
 If he does not take the job, Chou certainly will
 have a large say in the selection of the man who does.
 The name that crops up most often is Chang Chun-chiao.
 Given the current make-up of the Politburo, Chang is

 a logical choice.  Apart from Mao and Chou, most of
 the ton members are either "honorary elders" or mili-
 tary man.  Li llsion-nion is a government. specialist
 whose forte in administration rather than politics.
 The remaining throe are Chang, Chiang Ching  (Mao's
 wife), and the young Shanghai radical, Yao Won-yuan.
 Of those, Chang is clearly the best candidate on the
 basis of experience and probable acceptability to the
 other members.  This process of elimination among
 lower ranking cadres may account for the number of
 reports about Chang's favorable prospects.
 Chang, a loading radical during the Cultural
 Revolution, owes his position to the support of Mao
 and Chiang Ching.   Nevertheless, he is astuto enough
 to compromise when he has to, and with an eye toward
 his post-Mao future, it is possible he has taken
 stops to make himself acceptable to moderates like
 Chou.  It is doubtful that he is one of Chou's "trusted
 lieutenants," F__                                I     25X1
 but Chang seems certain to figure prominently in the
 post-Mao party.  The radical wing of the party will
 continue to exist long after Mao's death, its views
 will have to be represented, and Chang is the least
 controversial of those Politburo members closely as-
 sociated with the excesses of the Cultural Revolution--
 more acceptable by far than either Chiang Ching or
 Yao Wen-yuan.
 Although Chiang Ching's role has h..sen largely
 restricted to cultural affairs, a move seems to be
 under way to pre-empt her leadership in that polit-
 ically sensitive field.  This has probably been
 motivated by a desire to minimize her potential as
 a political force when Mao passes from the scene.
 As Mao's wife, she can not be removed until after
 his death.                                                she      25X1
 is offensive to the leadership in the provinces; this
 distaste probably applies to Yao Wen-yuan as well.
 Yao's blistering attacks during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion did not endear him to the moderates.  Although

 25X1
 he in currently in charge of party propaganda work,
 Yao owes his Politburo position solely to his close
 association with Moo and Chiana China.
 Candidates for the chairmanship will not be
 limited to the current Politburo.   The Tenth. Party
 Congress, whether it occurs before or after Mao's
 death, will bring some nee; faces onto that under-
 strength body.  Even if Chou should choose to act
 as a regent to the new chairman, he would probably
 wish to call on experienced party officials to re-
 build the party, because he has not in th9 past
 devoted as much attention to party affairs as to gov-
 ernment matters.
 MI
 From Chou's point of view the reinstatement of
 some pre-Cultural Revolution party leaders to their
 former Politburo rank probably is highly desirable.
 (He has done much the same in the government
 racy.)            25X1
 HOW
 many and who should be reinstated may well be sub-
 jects of fierce debate; in addition, there are those
 within the leadership who oppose any move along these
 lines.
 Over the short term, the new party chairman
 could find himself in a weak position.  Wholesale
 damage was done to the party during the Cultural
 Revolution, and it has yet to regain its pre-eminence.
 Mao's still-considerable influence derives not from
 his position as head of the party, but from his great
 prestige and popular appeal.  The next chairman will
 not enjoy the latter advantages and will find, as
 has Mao, that the only institution left with the
 strength and authority to get things done is the mili-
 tary.  While many military leaders in the provinces

 double as provincial party chiefs,  their influence
 derives from the troops they command.  The military
 is the largest and most important interest group in
 the party.  As such, it cannot easily be divested of
 its party role.  Military men will remain a significant
 political force well after Mao's de4th, and any party
 leader with political ambitions would be well advised
 to court them.
 A strong voice will be that of Li Te-sheng, an
 alternate member of the Politburo,  who holds a key
 post in the central military hierarchy as director
 of the army's General Political Department.  He may
 be in line for the job of chief of staff, which has
 been vacant since the Lin affair, and he seems al-
 most certain of promotion to full membership on the
 Politburo at the Tenth Party Congress.
 The new party chairman will also have to estab-
 lish a sound working relationship with the provincial
 military leaders.  Chou apparently enjoys the support,
 if not the full trust and confidence, of the moderate
 military leaders, but the military establishment is
 uneasy about the drive to reassert the primacy of
 the party.  On the one hand, Chou has gone out of
 his way to calm their fears and has spoken on their
 behalf in Peking.  On the other hand, he is sensitive
 to criticism of the military's dominant role in the
 regime and would like to re-establish some measure of
 party control over the army.  Military leaders prob-
 ably recognize that they need Chou as much as he needs
 them.  They have worked well with him since the Cul-
 tural Revolution and would probably transfer their
 cooperation to a party chairman endorsed by Chou.
 To the masses, Mao's death would probably not
 be as traumatic today as at the height of his per-
 sonality cult.  The cult has been diminishing in
 recent years, and Mao's image was badly tarnished in
 the Lin Piao affair.  While he is still loved by many,
 there are probably more people than ever before who

 look at Mao critically.  Chou Command! wide respect
 throughout the country, and no long an the country
 hen such a leader to turn to, Mao's death will prob-
 ably not be especially disruptive.
 Mao's death would leave Chou the single most
 important figure in the country.  With no vtsiblo
 challangern to his authority and relieved of the
 need to secure Mao's approval, Chou would have a
 freer hand to direct party and government affairs.
 fie would still have to accommodate a variety of in-
 terests, but his powers of persuasion and his con-
 siderable prestige would enable him to forge a work-
 able coalition out of the disparate groups at the top,
 much as he frequently did at lower levels during the
 Cultural Revolution.
 If Chou Dias First
 Should Chou die first, the situation would be
 much less clear.  Mao has associated himself with
 many of the current moderate Chinese policies, par-
 ticularly in the field of foreign affairs, that are
 identified with Chou.  Without Chou, a turn to the
 loft could wall occur.  For example, Chiang Ching
 and Yao Won-yuan might be given added responsibilities,
 and plans to reinstate former party leaders  (many of
 them the very people Mao removed during the Cultural
 Revolution) might be halted.  The Chairman is on rec-
 ord as saying that the country ought to have a new
 Cultural Revolution every few years, but he probably
 would not launch another one like the last.   Even if
 he should want to, it is unlikely that he could call
 out either youth or the army as he did in the 1960s,
 and the party as it is now constituted would be an
 even less reliable instrument of his will.
 The most immediate problem posed by Chou's death
 would be the selection of a new premier.  The nod al-
 mcst certainly would go to Li Hsien-nien, the only
 active vice premier and the only government official

 Chou and Li appear to be grooming a number of
 younger government offieialn for high posts.  Vice
 Foreign Minister Chiao Xuan-hua in certainly among
 them, an in Pai faiang-kuo, a military man until 1970,
 who has turned in an outstanding performance an min-
 inter of foreign trade.  Mont of those nocond-echelon
 government buroaucratr are not even members of the
 party Central Committee, however, and unless they
 attain that status, they will find it difficult to
 roach the first echelon. Chou presumably will sponsor
 some of those people for membership on the Central
 Committee, if not the Politburo, at the Tenth Party
 Congress, but if he should die before the congress,
 their promotions would be in doubt.
 Chang Chun-chino has frequently boon mentioned
 in speculation about future premiers, but his future
 is likely to be much brighter within the party hier-
 archy than in the government.  Although theoretically
 he is in charge of China's largest city, Shanghai--a

 in 13 provinces; the campaign was a flop.

 forties, appears to handle agricultural ;utters for

 It will be more difficult to replace Chou ae
 the chief spokesman for the moderates, than an premier.
 Moderate members of the leadership would be hard
 preened to find another champion who carrion as much
 weight with Mao.  Initially, because no many of them
 are military men, they would probably turn to Yeh
 Chien-ying.  Yeh, too, in in his neventien and would
 be no more than a temporary successor.  Either of the
 two regional military commanders now on the Politburo
 conceivably could load the moderate cause, but both
 of them seem content to remain in their home provinces
 away from the political fray in Poking.
 Chou's death would cause considerable anxiety,
 both within the leadership and among the people,
 since he in considered by many an virtually indispensable.
