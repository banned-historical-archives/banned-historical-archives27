 North Korea:
 A Sociological Perspective
 Introduction        For over three decades the United- States has maintained forces on the
 Information available Korean peninsula to defend the Republic of Korea against military
 as of 24 September 1982 aggression from the regime in the North.
 we have pieced together a picture of North Korean society that
 provides some insight into the regime's ability to sustain the discipline
 necessary for this nation of 20 million people to support the sixth-largest
 army in the world.
 What emerges is a depressing picture of a highly regimented, colorless
 society revolving around the central figure of Kim 11-song. In over 35 years
 at the top, he has removed any potential threats to his dominance and
 reordered society more thoroughly than any of his Communist counterparts
 in Europe and Asia. Adapting Korea's rigid class structure and long
 tradition of authoritarian rule, Kim has created a society where political
 loyalty to the "Great Leader" is the sole criteria for advancement.
 The mechanisms for maintaining control have been effective. Frustration
 and dissatisfaction exist, to be sure, but we have been able to turn up only
 the most limited evidence of overt displays of dissidence. Kim's carefully
 laid plans to turn power over to his son, however, are testimony to his worry
 that his legacy and place in history will eventually suffer a fate similar to
 Mao's or Stalin's.

 Secret
 North Korea:
 A Sociological Perspective
 Tradition Versus Reform-The New Social Order
 Capitalizing on the traditional stratification of
 society, the North Korean Communists have aggres-
 sively reclassified a whole society according to their
 own criteria. Just as traditional Korean society was
 broken into four main classes (nobility, privileged,
 peasantry, and slave or outcast), contemporary Com-
 munist society has developed along similar lines. The
 difference is that Kim stood the traditional order on
 its head.
 Songbun
 Two criteria determine status in North Korean soci-
 ety: songbun or class background and, within the
 songbun category, loyalty to the cult of Kim 11-song.
 An individual's songbun is either good or bad, with
 various gradations within the two.
 In the Communist view the only "good" people in
 Korea in 1945 were factory workers, laborers, poor
 farmers, and those engaged in revolutionary struggle
 against the Japanese: these people and their descend-
 ants are the privileged class of today. Highest distinc-
 tion goes to the anti-Japanese guerrillas who fought
 with Kim 11-song. Next are the veterans of the Korean
 war and finally the descendants of the pre-
 revolutionary workers and the poor small farmers.
 Together, these favored groups constitute some 30
 percent of the population; the uppermost level, the
 ruling elite, is no more than 1 percent of the popula-
 tion. Ranked below them in descending order-in
 what must be the most class-differentiated society in
 the world today-are some 47 distinct groups general-
 ly divided into those with acceptable songbun and
 those without.'
 ' Perhaps the only touch of humor in this otherwise deadly business
 of ranking people according to songbun is the party's terminology
 for the chosen versus the unchosen-the "tomatoes" versus the
 "grapes." "Tomatoes," which are completely red to the core, are
 considered worthy Communists; "apples," which are red only on
 the surface, are considered to need ideological improvement; and
 the "grapes" are considered hopeless.
 Generally, North Korea's population can be broken
 down into three main groups. The preferred class
 (elite and privileged) is given every advantage, and
 with hard work its members can rise to the top. The
 middle 40 percent of the population-the ordinary
 people-hope for a lucky break, such as a good
 assignment in the military, that will bring them to the
 attention of party cadre and get them a better job;
 they have no hope of a college education or a profes-
 sional career, although membership in the party is
 still possible. The bottom 30 percent of the popula-
 tion-the "undesirables"-are treated like pariahs;
 all doors to advancement-the Army and higher
 education-are closed to them. They can expect little
 except assignment to a collective farm, a factory, a
 mine, or doing menial labor in a city other than
 P'yongyang.
 Party cadre and security officials keep detailed rec-
 ords on everyone, documenting the degree of goodness
 and badness.                     in the late 1940s
 and during the period immediately after the Korean
 war songbun records were rather spotty and people
 were able to conceal the fact that their father or uncle
 or grandfather had been a landowner, doctor, Chris-
 tian minister, merchant, or lawyer. In the late 1960s,
 however, the regime began a series of exhaustive
 secret investigations. Since then the public security
 apparatus has periodically conducted additional inves-
 tigations to the point where everyone now has been
 repeatedly checked.
 records today are extremely accurate and compete.
 Living With Songbun
 Everyone in North Korea seems to have a fairly good
 idea of what their songbun is, although official notice
 is never given. At every important juncture in life its
 effects are obvious: admission or nonadmission to high
 school or college, entry or nonentry into the Army,

 admission or nonadmission to the party, approval or
 nonapproval for marriage, assignment to a job, or
 transfer into or out of the city or a collective farm.
 Just how good or how bad a person is viewed becomes
 clearer over time, with the more subtle changes in a
 career.
 who had lived privleged lives in
 yongyang had been disturbed by the system's injus-
 tices. They resented those with better songbun being
 excused from volunteer labor on collective farms
 while they had to work 18-hour days, seven days a
 week, for three or four weeks during the rice trans-
 planting season; they resented others being able to
 vacation at government rest homes while they had not
 had a vacation in years; they resented those with
 superior songbun being given the honor of graduating
 first in their class, although others might have had
 better grades; and they resented those with good
 songbun being given choice assignments over better
 qualified candidates.
 Besides fostering resentments of this type, the song-
 bun system has crippled incentive, ambition, and hard
 work. The privileged have a feeling of guaranteed
 success in life, whether they work hard or not; the
 nonprivileged have a sense of futility that eventually
 kills any incentive to work hard and do well..
 If the songbun system is as important to upward
 mobility as current information suggests, it will be a
 major impediment to economic progress. The govern-
 ment seems to have begun to recognize this problem
 in recent years, particularly in trying to motivate that
 middle 40 percent of the population from which the
 regime draws most of the working force and the
 majority of the armed forces. While offering no hope
 for change in social status, it has begun to offer some
 monetary and other material incentives to increase
 productivity and to sustain a higher level of worker
 commitment and output.
 The regime has done little, if anything, to motivate
 the bottom third of the population. Lacking any hope
 of significant advancement, people with bad songbun
 tend to act the way the party describes them-lazy,
 mistrustful, and sometimes obstructionist-in a kind
 of self-fulfilling prophecy; many have been relocated
 to remote areas.
 In denying social advancement to such a large seg-
 ment of the population, the regime has created a
 situation in which people have good reason to be
 dissatisfied with their lot in life. They can hope for
 nothing more for their children than what they have
 received; and, although there is some chance for
 improving their material standard of living, there is no
 way for them or their children to move up the social
 ladder, to obtain a higher education, to choose their
 own job or place of residence, or even to marry outside
 their class.
 The potential for opposition from those so openly
 discriminated against is difficult to assess, but it
 clearly has been one of the reasons for the regime's
 preoccupation with "antirevolutionary sentiments."
 Propaganda constantly decries elements hostile to the
 regime's programs and projects a level of security
 consciousness excessive even in such a controlled
 environment. Reports of antiregime activity that occa-
 sionally reach the outside world suggest the regime's
 concern is warranted.
 recounted myriad stories illustrating
 the importance of being a "Kim II-song man"-loyal
 to Kim's thinking and teaching. They do not, however,
 always recognize the interplay between songbun and
 political loyalty-and the two are inseparable. Politi-
 cal loyalty is the key to career advancement; however,
 it operates only within the constraints already dictat-
 ed by songbun.
 Dedication to Kim I1-song cannot erase bad songbun,
 but it can improve a person's lot in life-within the
 limits established for his class. The son of a former
 landowner will not get into college or the Army, but
 proven dedication to Kim is likely to get him a low-
 ranking job in a factory rather than on a cooperative
 farm. Dedication to Kim's teachings might give some-
 one in the middle social bracket a chance to live and
 work in the city as a lower level bureaucrat rather
 than as a factory worker. And among the privileged
 class it determines who rises to the top in government,
 education, management, and medicine.

 Secret
 Less-than-zealous devotion to Kim is grounds for
 demotion, but again within established limits. People
 with good songbun are not likely to be sent to a
 collective farm or a coal mine except for the most
 serious offense, such as the defection of a close family
 member or some other treasonable act. Normally,
 they will be dropped several notches within the range
 of occupations reserved for their social class; for
 example, a top party official might be demoted to
 some lower level party position on a collective farm, a
 high-level factory manager reassigned to office work,
 or a middle school teacher demoted to a factory
 worker.
 Ambitious people in North Korea are forever trying to
 outdo one another in their show of loyalty to Kim.E
 rnce observed a North Korean diplomat
 aww c upon arriving at P'yongyang Airport from an
 assignment overseas, immediately began to bow osten-
 tatiously to a photograph of Kim he had pulled from
 his wallet.           thought the diplomat was
 acting for the benefit of the foreigners present, but,
 he would have done it if no
 foreigners had been there. His extravagant show of
 fealty is likely to have won him more status than a job
 well done.
 No one  except Kim and his immediate family--is
 immune from such political displays of loyalty. For all
 their special privileges, the elite are just as obligated
 as any other North Korean in this regard. Indeed, as a
 person rises through the ranks to the top, more is
 expected in terms of political loyalty. Thus, the most
 exaggerated worship of the cult occurs at the upper
 levels of government. From all reports, in an embassy
 the ambassador is invariably the most fanatical. He
 got where he is that way; it may not be a measure of
 his true feelings, but it is the price of success, if not
 political survival.
 The adulation of Kim and the central role he is given
 in almost every aspect of daily life in North Korea
 exceeds that of any other modern personality cult. In
 part, this is possible because of North Korea's rela-
 tively small size and its homogenous population. Kim
 is also a man of considerable charisma; he has taken
 special pains to cultivate a close relationship with the
 people. His unusually long tenure and penchant for
 making on-the-spot inspections have allowed him to
 become personally familiar with virtually every town,
 village, factory, and farm in North Korea. Most
 North Koreans have seen him at close hand on one or
 another of his routine visits to their province. Think-
 ing of North Korea as about the size of Pennsylvania,
 it is easy to imagine the relationship that a charismat-
 ic governor of such a state might develop with his
 people over a period of 40 years, if he spent 150 to 200
 days on the road each year, as Kim II-song has.
 The meticulous study of Kim's writings at every level
 of society, excessive displays of loyalty to him (partic-
 ularly on special occasions such as his birthday), and
 the mass mobilization to construct national develop-
 ment projects or monuments for his personal glorifica-
 tion reinforce the mystique of his leadership.
 The higher a person's education, the more hours spent
 studying the life and thought of Kim. University
 students in the social sciences spend no less than 40
 percent of their time studying Kim. Students in the
 science departments are reported to devote about 20
 percent of their time to political study.

 Seeing Kim Through the Cult
 While the cult to a degree reflects genuine popular
 support for Kim, it has become exaggerated to the
 point that it is also a major irritant. Many Koreans
 have long since passed the tolerance point for learning
 more minutiae about Kim's life-when he visited a
 certain factory, exactly what he said, or what the
 weather was like that day. This does not diminish
 their affection for him, and they consider him worthy
 of respect, but it does make them critical of party
 officials who carry the national religion to absurd
 proportions.
 From all reports, the cult's most onerous aspect is the
 forced display of emotion. It is not uncommon for
 North Koreans to cry when speaking to foreigners
 about the "Great Leader's unbounded goodness."
 Visitors to North Korea have so many encounters of
 this kind they are convinced these "spontaneous"
 expressions are carefully rehearsed.
 confirms this beyond any doubt.
 On the occasion of Kim's 65th birthday in April 1977,
 all diplomatic personnel abroad received watches as a
 special commemorative gift, presented at formal cere-
 monies in the embassies. The diplomats were instruct-
 ed to "show their love and gratitude to Kim with tears
 of joy." Movies recorded the event for later showing
 in the Foreign Ministry.
 With support for Kim so broadly based, the regime
 must calculate that it can afford this kind of non-
 threatening dissatisfaction. It may also be unable to
 stop the momentum it put in motion when it orga-
 nized society on the basis of political loyalty to Kim.
 Other Communist societies, never as thoroughly polit-
 icized as North Korea, have not faced the problems
 that result from making loyalty to a particular leader,
 rather than the system, the sole basis for advancement
 in society.
 In our view, the regime has let things get out of
 control. Dissatisfaction with the cult's excesses among
 the regime's supporters is likely to be a more serious
 threat to "Kim Il-songism" over the long run than any
 problem posed by the politically disenchanted, partic-
 ularly because the cult seems to offend the educated
 and privileged more than it does the ordinary North
 Korean. The less privileged do not seem as deeply
 affected by the cult's excesses because they have other
 sources of dissatisfaction-the denial of a higher
 education or a better job with a higher income. The
 better educated, however, who are more easily bored
 with the emotionalism and trivia of the cult, must
 suffer greater exposure to it. Just as Deng Xiaoping
 and other Chinese leaders now admit they were
 repulsed by the excesses of the Mao cult (though they
 gave no indication of it at the time), some of North
 Korea's leaders must be similarly repelled by many
 aspects of the Kim cult.
 The Social Setting
 The life of an average North Korean family is still
 spartan, although there has been some gradual im-
 provement. The average working-class family (all but
 the most privileged and the elite) still needs two wage
 earners to meet basic needs. Even with two salaries,
 the average family income of 120 to 180 won per
 month barely covers the costs of food and clothing.
 Most people cannot afford to have more than two
 children, even though the government-in an effort to
 ease the labor shortage-offers limited incentives to
 families to have more children.
 Most women-whether married or single-must work
 out of economic necessity. They make up just over
 half of the work force, dominating such areas as
 teaching, medicine, and textile manufacturing. Wom-
 en are predominant in the party and government at
 the middle level and below, but there is only token
 representation at the higher levels in both organiza-
 tions. Women are also well represented in higher
 education but are generally restricted to those profes-
 sions they dominate.

 The basic social grouping is the work unit. Every
 North Korean belongs to one. A unit can be a school,
 factory, collective farm, government office, or mili-
 tary unit. It is the vehicle for political development,
 observation, and social control. The unit provides
 housing as well as employment. It gives permission to
 marry and distributes rations of clothing and shoes. It
 authorizes travel, out-of-town accommodations, and
 even a dinner at a public restaurant. It approves
 vacation time and arranges for a stay at a government
 rest home. A person must have the unit's permission
 to see a doctor, have an operation, or buy a watch or a
 bicycle. Finally, it is with members of the unit that
 North Koreans attend all party meetings, militia
 training, self-criticism sessions, morning and evening
 study sessions, and cultural or social events.
 Because of military service, marriage is forbidden
 until a man is 30; a woman is discouraged by the state
 from marrying before age 24. Divorce is difficult to
 obtain and harmful politically. Children are quickly
 introduced to state-sponsored group activity. Most of
 the family's limited leisure time will be spent with the
 work unit rather than together. All children join the
 Young Pioneers at age 9 or 10 and the Socialist
 Working League between 14 and 16. The latter
 introduces the child to basic political indoctrinations,
 self-criticism sessions, and volunteer labor. Student
 schedules for vacations, political study, and volunteer
 labor will differ from those of their parents. Still,
 family ties appear to remain strong and stable.
 State-directed activities consume a major part of an
 individual's daily existence. Political study may take
 up as much as three hours a day during the six-day
 workweek. Add to this several hours of weekly self-
 criticism sessions and volunteer labor after work, on
 weekends, and during "free time" and some North
 Koreans will have spent the equivalent of 145 work
 days each year on these activities.
 This leaves little time for recreation in any form.
 What evidence there is suggests that leisure time is
 concentrated on Sundays and limited vacation peri-
 ods. It usually means going to a park, sporting event,
 or simply relaxing at home. The media-radio, televi-
 sion, and the press-offer only limited recreational
 opportunities. All printed material is designed to
 glorify the regime and stress its political message. The
 same is basically true for radio and television, al-
 though they carry some sporting events and local
 news.
 The high moral standard the regime claims for its
 people stems in part from the fact that most people
 have little time or energy for getting into trouble.
 Reports of juvenile delinquency almost always involve
 the children of the elite or privileged.
 Elitism and Equalitarianism
 In keeping with the regime's priorities, the system has
 produced an elite group-perhaps 1 percent of the
 population-that meets the twin criteria of excellent
 songbun and proven loyalty to Kim. As in other
 Communist countries, members of this group enjoy
 privileges, tangible and intangible, that make their
 lives vastly different from those of ordinary North
 Koreans. The price, however, is high: close and con-
 stant monitoring of all but the most senior party and
 government officials.
 At the same time, the system has produced a basic
 egalitarianism in the lifestyles of most other North
 Koreans-more noticeably so than in other Commu-
 nist countries. In addition the regime's emphasis on
 political loyalty and constant observation prevents
 even those with privilege from flaunting their status.
 The regime's claims that there is no great income gap
 in North Korea are not true, just misleading. Exclud-
 ing Kim 11-song, the highest paid government officials
 earn only about three or four times the wage of the
 average North Korean worker. In a system, however,
 that makes only the most limited use of the open
 market to distribute goods and services, wages are
 irrelevant. They are little more than an allowance
 given to a child in the West for expenditures above
 and beyond the housing, food, clothing, education,
 and medical care provided by parents. In North
 Korea, as in the USSR, privilege operates outside the
 system of wages, rations, and the normal distribution
 of goods and savings.
 Most consumer goods are not purchased, but distrib-
 uted through individual work units. The food ration-
 ing system allocates foodgrains and other staples on
 Approved For Release 2007/12/06: CIA-RDP84SO0553R000100010001-7
 Approved For Release 2007/12/06: CIA-RDP84SO0553R000100010001-7
 the basis of the physical energy required on the job.
 Thus, higher level officials get smaller rations than
 fishermen, coal miners, and workers in heavy indus-
 try. And prized woolen clothing goes only to the
 military, coal miners, fishermen, and others exposed
 to harsh working conditions.
 Moreover, except for the very top leaders who live in
 exclusive executive apartments, housing for the privi-
 leged is much the same as for the lower classes. Most
 people live in a housing unit comprising a living-
 dining room, one bedroom, a kitchen, and a bathroom
 that is usually shared by several families. The elite
 may have private baths and sometimes two bedrooms
 instead of one. Education and medical care are free to
 all, suggesting equality in the area of so-called social
 consumption as well as personal consumption.
 With the state providing most basic commodities,
 including housing, wages go for extra food and cloth-
 ing, cigarettes, entertainment, and sundries. A high
 wage can mean a more varied diet, one or two extra
 suits or dresses, occasional movies or dinners at a
 restaurant, travel to visit relatives, or the purchase of
 a major item such as a wristwatch or bicycle.
 Food
 P'yongyang uses an extensive, complex, and rigorous
 rationing system, ostensibly to ensure equitable distri-
 bution. Its novel features seem in many respects to
 favor the less privileged over the more privileged, but
 in actuality it reinforces the inequities in the system.
 To a North Korean the amount of rice in the grain
 ration is as important as the total grain allotment.
 Preferring rice to any other foodgrain, North Koreans
 would choose a smaller grain allotment composed
 exclusively of rice over a larger grain ration with a
 mixture of less rice and other grains. Only the elite,
 laborers with very hazardous jobs, some military
 officers on special assignment, and seriously ill pa-
 tients in hospitals receive their full grain ration in
 rice.
 Over the years the share of rice in ordinary grain
 rations has been cut from 70 percent in the late 1960s
 to 50 percent in 1970 to 30 percent in 1973.2 This
 forced decline in rice consumption was the result of
 the need to expand exports to repay overdue interna-
 tional debts.                        the substi-
 tution of other foodgrains has been very unpopular
 and is a source of growing dissatisfaction. Nonethe-
 less, the people have no choice but to accept the
 regime's explanation that it is stockpiling rice to "feed
 the starving South Korean masses'on the happy day of
 reunification."
 The elite, however, have countinued to enjoy their full
 grain allotments in polished rice, a form of rice
 unavailable to most North Koreans for years. Thus, a
 cabinet minister receiving 700 grams of polished rice
 a day is being treated much better than a blast
 furnace operator receiving 900 grams of grain per
 day, 30 percent in unpolished rice, 50 percent in corn,
 and 20 percent in wheat flour. The equality of giving
 larger rations to those who do heavy work and need
 more food is counterbalanced by the elitism of saving
 the finest for the privileged.
 The average basic diet is not a healthy, balanced one.
 It is heavy on carbohydrates and low in fats, proteins,
 vitamins, and minerals. Whether living in the city or a
 rural area, the average Korean eats almost no meat,
 limited amounts of fish or poultry, and very little
 fruit. There has been less improvement in food than in
 any other consumer area.
 Clothes and Consumer Goods
 No formal rationing system exists for clothing as it
 does for food. However, since clothes are distributed
 through schools, factories, offices, or cooperative
 farms, the regime has almost total control over the
 process. Everyone is issued two winter outfits and one
 summer outfit, but the higher quality designs and
 fabrics go to those in the privileged occupations and
 schools. The nominal cost of state-supplied clothes has
 no relation to the price of clothes in the stores. The
 latter are for sale to those who can afford extra
 clothing not deemed essential by the state.
 Compared with other items sold on the open market,
 clothing is reasonably priced, except for quality wool-
 en and leather goods. This reflects a price structure in

 secret
 which goods that the regime deems essential (unra-
 tioned foods, simple clothing, cosmetics) are subsi-
 dized while nonessential items (above-average cloth-
 ing, electric appliances) are sold at inflated prices.
 The profit the state makes on the latter compensates
 for the losses on the former.
 An ordinary North Korean could never save enough
 money to buy a refrigerator or a black and white
 television. Imported color televisions and Swiss and
 Japanese wristwatches cost more than an average
 worker earns in an entire year. Consumption is con-
 trolled by price alone, without resorting to rationing.
 Such items do become available to members of the
 middle class and the privileged on special occasions,
 such as Kim's birthday. They are distributed as
 "personal gifts" from Kim.
 Relative to wages, all prices are high-reflecting the
 limited role of money in the economy and the minor
 role of the open market in the distribution of goods
 and services. A nylon sweater and two pairs of nylon
 socks cost the ordinary worker a month's wages. The
 average daily wage of 2.5 won can buy either 1 meter
 of cotton cloth (not nylon, silk, or wool), a toothbrush
 and toothpaste, one private bath in a bathhouse and a
 cake of soap, or a set of ping-pong paddles and a ball.
 in
 addition to the direct distribution of goods through
 work units, there is a network of "special stores" that
 most North Koreans never hear about. Some are open
 only to foreigners and charge exorbitant prices to earn
 much-needed foreign exchange. Others, modeled after
 those in the Soviet Union and operating independently
 of the open market, are available only to privileged
 North Koreans and sell prestige items at discount
 prices. Not only are prices lower than in regular
 government-operated stores, but goods (mostly im-
 ported) not otherwise available are for sale: leather
 shoes, wool suits, beef, pork, fresh fish, caviar, wine,
 liquor, and high-quality cigarettes. Except for some
 shoes imported from Japan, no foreign-made clothing
 is available to ordinary North Koreans. Beef and pork
 are almost never available, and wine and liquor only
 on national holidays and special occasions such as
 weddings.
 The elite, however, have ready access to these goods,
 at discount prices, all year

 Housing
 Housing is another area in which elitism flourishes
 alongside a basic egalitarianism. Of all consumer
 areas, housing has consistently received top priority,
 second only to investment in heavy industry and
 surpassing transportation, agriculture, and light in-
 dustry. Although the share of state capital allocated
 to housing has gradually declined in recent years, the
 absolute amount has grown steadily. Since the Korean
 war, the regime has constructed new housing for more
 than three-fourths of its population, urban and rural.
 Visitors to North Korea are inevitably impressed with
 the modern high rise apartments (many of them 12 to
 20 stories high) in P'yongyang and other cities and the
 cement-tiled cottages of rural North Korea. Both
 bespeak a higher standard of living than in neighbor-
 ing China. North Koreans take pride in the significant
 improvement in housing since the war and the basic
 equality of the system.
 Even though the people are more impressed with the
 improvements in housing than in any other area,
 complained of cramped housing more
 than the shortage of meat and the lack of variety in
 the diet, the cost of warm clothes, the poor quality of
 other clothes, the scarcity of medicines, or the limited
 opportunities for higher education. Although city
 dwellers believe their one-bedroom apartment is an
 improvement over the past, they look forward to the
 regime's promise of a two-bedroom apartment for
 every family of five or more.
 Housing construction, whatever its record, simply has
 not kept pace with demand. Families are assigned
 housing associated with the factory, cooperative farm,

 or government ministry where the father works. Even
 if they had the money, people could not choose to
 spend more on better housing or housing in a different
 location at the sacrifice of other consumer wants.
 No other consumer area seems to have presented the
 same challenge to the regime. Rural housing still
 consists primarily of single-story dwellings with two
 basic rooms plus a kitchen shared with another fam-
 ily. All homes have electricity but few have inside
 plumbing.
 Despite significant improvements in the quality of
 construction, it would be wrong to leave the impres-
 sion that North Korean apartments-even the newer
 ones-are of superior construction.
 observed: "None o the walls are free
 rom cracks. Most electric switches and outlets are
 defective. The wooden floors are not properly laid.
 Rain soaks through many of the roofs, the doors are
 narrow, and there are no screens on the windows."
 Housing for the Elite. People do not cite discrimina-
 tion in housing as a major complaint, largely because
 of the regime's success in concealing the special
 housing available to the elite. The inequalities, how-
 ever, are every bit as striking as in other consumer
 areas. In urban areas at least, the level of privilege is
 also disguised by placing special housing units in
 sections of the city where ordinary citizens have no
 reason to visit. Thus, the single-unit homes of the
 most privileged or the three- and four-bedroom execu-
 tive apartments are visible only to those who live
 there.
 Basic furnishings-a dining room table, one or two
 wooden wardrobe chests, a wooden desk, and pantry
 cabinet for kitchenware-come with every apartment.
 Furnishings for higher class apartments-sewing ma-
 chines, fans, televisions, and small refrigerators-
 represent a substantially higher standard of living and
 are beyond the hope of most North Koreans. Most
 would have access to a black and white television and
 sewing machine only through their apartment build-
 ings or collective farms, much as US students have
 access to a television and laundry facilities in their
 dormitories. Thus, when the regime boasts that all
 North Koreans have television, it means that all
 citizens have access to television. Small villages typi-
 cally have one to three televisions that villagers can
 gather around to watch sporting events, the evening
 news, or movies.
 While ordinary North Koreans typically share com-
 munal bathrooms with other families on the same
 corridor of their apartment building or in their com-
 plex of rural homes, residents of the elite apartments
 have private bathrooms-some with running water
 and flush toilets. The apartments of the privileged
 usually have other conveniences, such as elevators,
 central heating, and sometimes air conditioning and
 private telephones.                have spoken of
 the disadvantages of living on the upper floors of a
 high rise apartment building with no elevator or
 running water.                North Koreans
 much prefer individual housing units in rural areas to
 apartment living in the cities because "they so dislike
 carrying trash, water, coal, and groceries up and down
 so many flights of stairs." One of the luxuries of the
 executive apartments is that they are only two or
 three stories high.
 The North Koreans have devised a novel system for
 ensuring that the privileged always enjoy the latest in
 modern housing. As new apartment buildings with the
 most up-to-date conveniences are constructed, privi-
 leged families are moved out of their old apartments
 into these new ones. The people who rank just below
 them move into the old apartments, and on down the
 line. People are constantly moving in and out of
 apartments, in a slow but steady improvement in their
 standard of living. The family of a senior military
 officer is known to have moved nine times in 16 years,
 all within the P'yongyang vicinity. Since apartment
 buildings are occupied by people working in the same
 government ministry or factory, the residents are
 moved as a group, with no disruption of their social
 ties.
 In addition to their own special housing, the elite have
 access to luxurious vacation homes along the beach on
 the east coast, in mountain areas near P'yongyang,
 and as far away as the northwestern border with
 China. The North Koreans have created artificial

 between medical services for the elite and that avail-

 section of P'yongyang for high-ranking party and
 government officials only. Most North Koreans do not
 even know of the existence of the Ponghwa Clinic, just

 as most Soviet citizens apparently do not know of the
 Kremlin Clinic in Moscow. Both leaderships make
 every effort to keep such prestige facilities secret.
 North Korea's almost irrepressible desire to show off
 its prestige facilities, including its premier medical
 facilities, we know of no foreign visitor who has ever
 been taken to the Ponghwa Clinic.
 Although the three central hospitals in P'yongyang
 are reasonably good by world standards, they are not
 typical of the 6,700 hospitals, clinics, and rural health
 centers outside the capital. These three are the only
 ones in the country with central heating, air condi-
 tioning, private rooms, and comfortable beds with
 mattresses.                    most hospitals are
 poorly equipped, overcrowded, badly heated, and no-
 torious for their poor food, uncomfortable wooden
 beds, and inadquate supplies of medicines.

 South after the war, the regime was faced with the
 immediate need to develop a new class of skilled
 technicians "to accelerate the revolution and promote
 national construction." P'yongyang claims that the
 educational system has produced an unprecedented
 number of "new intellectuals." In the Communist
 sense of the word, "intellectual" is often interchanged
 with "technician." The North's basic concept of edu-
 cation is to link study with work, a kind of on-the-job

 University is intense. As of late 1980, only one of
 every five or six applicants was accepted and in some
 departments only one of 10.
 Thirty-five years after its founding, Kim 11-song
 University with 12,000 students is still the only four-
 year university in the country; 200,000 to 300,000
 students attend specialized two-year colleges. Each
 year the regime allocates substantial resources to
 improve the facilities of the university-reserved for
 the chosen elite-but gives no consideration to estab-
 lishing other four-year universities in the country.
 Imbalances in the curriculum reflect the skewed
 nature of the educational system, which is structured
 to provide the necessary training for productive labor.

 visiting social scientists to meet with their North

 overworked. Teachers of primary grades in rural areas
 are usually new graduates of middle school, barely 17
 years old. Other than paper and pencils, teachers and
 students must make most classroom equipment-all
 maps, charts, pictures, chemicals, and other experi-
 mental materials.
 Despite these weaknesses, the regime has succeeded in
 many areas. When the Communists came to power in
 1946, illiteracy was widespread and less than 20
 percent of all Korean youth had gone beyond elemen-
 tary schooling (taught in Japanese). The Korean lan-
 guage was immediately introduced at all levels. From
 the outset, the regime put a premium on the rapid
 training of technically oriented personnel who could
 aid the one-generation industrial revolution being
 planned.
 Since the early 1970s, the increase in school enroll-
 ments at all levels has been phenomenal. Education
 seems to have been one of the few areas unaffected by
 government cutbacks resulting from the economy's
 disappointing performance during the mid-1970s.
 By 1980 the number of colleges had grown to 170, of
 which 25 were in P'yongyang. According to North
 Korean statistics, school enrollment jumped from 2.6
 million students in 1968 to 8.6 million in 1980. Some
 6 million students were reported to be in primary,
 middle, and high school. Enrollment in colleges had
 increased substantially, from a low of 200,000 in 1970
 to 350,000 in 1980. Attendance at factory colleges,
 night schools, and correspondence courses was aboat
 2.3 million.
 The relatively high enrollment in these factory col-
 leges suggests no less emphasis on adult education
 even though the government was expanding its efforts
 in other areas. The regime claims the number of
 factory colleges increased from 20 in 1960 to 85 in
 1981.                             some 15
 percent of the country's workers and peasants had
 studied in adult education programs by the end of
 1981.
 The results of these tremendous efforts in education
 have been impressive in many regards. Over 600,000
 technicians and specialists were reportedly trained
 during 1970-76, bringing the total number of trained
 technicians in North Korea to more than 1 million, up
 from 22,000 in 1953 and 497,000 in 1970. As a share
 of the estimated total work force, this is an increase
 from under 1 percent in 1953 to over 8 percent in
 1970 and up to 15 percent in 1980. About 10 percent
 of the labor force are graduates of college and higher
 technical institutes, and the average worker has seven
 to eight years of education, compared to four to five
 years in the 1970s.
 Education for the Privileged. Perhaps the greatest
 privilege of the elite is access to the finest education.
 Although all children go to nursery school from the
 age of three months, the children of the privileged
 attend the celebrated 18 September Nursery, a show-
 case school featuring a heated swimming pool, mod-
 ern playgrounds, spacious classrooms, and a well-
 trained staff. None of the other 60,000 nursery
 schools or kindergartens, which accommodate some
 3.5 million children up to the age of 6, have similar
 facilities.
 Privileged children living in P'yongyang have the
 opportunity to pursue extracurricular activities at the
 plush Children's Palace, a huge complex of some 500
 rooms offering courses in music, dancing, embroidery,
 the martial arts, science, mechanics, painting and
 sculpture, gymnastics, swimming, boxing, soccer, bas-
 ketball, volleyball, weight lifting, and ping-pong.
 as many as 10,000
 of North Korea's most privileged children, ages 8 to
 16, use the Children's Palace daily. A staff of 500
 full-time teachers plus another 1,000 part-time teach-
 ers direct their activities.

 people who get ahead by going to the best schools are
 those who have grown up amidst relative privilege.
 Members of the second-generation leadership-typi-
 fied by Kim Chong-il-who have gone to North
 Korea's most prestigious schools, who have avoided
 spending eight to 10 years in the military, who have
 lived in comfortable homes, played tennis, driven cars,
 and vacationed at beach resorts while others have
 been doing volunteer labor on the farms are somewhat
 out of touch with the mass of people who lead very
 different lives. Certainly, they are a different breed
 from the first-generation leaders-self-styled guer-
 rilla fighters with little formal education, devoted to
 the cause of Korean independence and reunification,
 and much more egalitarian in their thinking.
 Second-generation leaders cannot claim to have
 known hard times or to have lived as the ordinary
 North Korean lives, as Kim Il-song can. As members
 of the new aristocracy, they will probably claim
 leadership on the basis of birth and rank. And that is
 precisely what we are seeing in Kim Chong-il's ef-
 forts, with his father's blessing, to establish the first
 "Communist monarchal succession" in history. Com-
 pared with its predecessor, this generation is likely to
 be much more elitist in its thinking and more con-
 cerned with preserving the system that protects its
 privileged position.
 Educational Weaknesses. An educational system that
 puts a premium on political skills naturally motivates
 the bright and ambitious to cultivate their political
 rather than academic skills. Guaranteed as they are of
 a successful professional career in the future, privi-
 leged students at the best schools feel relatively little
 need to do well. Even in technical fields the regime
 has remained relatively unsophisticated. Political dis-
 tortion is even more noticeable in the social sciences.
 North Koreans know nothing of'US involvement in
 World War II or much else of world history, focusing
 instead on Korean history and the study of Marxism-
 Leninism.
 The regime has begun to feel some of the inadequa-
 cies of the educational system. The lack of English
 linguists, in particular, has inhibited P'yongyang in
 advancing its diplomatic objectives. English is now
 compulsory in the school curriculum, and the govern-
 ment is sending a relatively large number of students
 abroad for English-language training.
 In short, the educational system at any level provides
 little in the way of a truly intellectual experience.
 North Koreans are technically trained and thoroughly
 imbued with Kim's teachings-and not used to think-
 ing for themselves.
 Life in Pyongyang
 So great is the difference between living in P'yong-
 yang and living elsewhere in the country that some
 feeling for P'yongyang is necessary for an apprecia-
 tion of privilege in North Korea. P'yongyang is the
 center of everything-the government, the arts, sci-
 ence, and technology.
 Kim 11-song has built a showcase city in P'yongyang
 that is atypical of the rest of the country. There is
 great natural beauty in its parks and rivers and
 grandeur in its public buildings and wide, tree-lined
 avenues. Added to this is the city's extraordinary
 cleanliness, some even say sterility.
 Part of Kim's design in creating his "dream city," as
 he calls P'yongyang, has obviously been to limit the
 size of the population-which now stands at about 1
 million.                      more North Koreans
 want to live in P'yongyang and many people would
 migrate to the city were it not for the tight controls
 exercised by the government. North Koreans cannot
 move into or out of P'yongyang without official
 approval.
 Bicycles are forbidden in the city, and trucks are
 restricted to certain sections to maintain its orderly,
 uncluttered appearance. Since there are no privately
 owned automobiles, the only cars evident are those
 owned by the government and used to transport high-
 level party and government officials, university pro-
 fessors, and distinguished artists and athletes. Other
 people travel by bus, trolley, or subway. The lack of

 traffic, along with the absence of industry within the
 city, has kept it free of air pollution, a troubling
 problem in most other areas of North Korea.
 Unlike most cities, which grow helter-skelter, P'yong-
 yang was carefully planned. Reduced to rubble in the
 Korean war, it was rebuilt on the drawing boards. The
 streets, laid out in a north-south, east-west grid, give
 it a well-ordered appearance. Its public buildings-
 built on a grand scale-make it a monumental city.
 The city's showcase quality, however, may be best
 illustrated by the extensive P'yongyang subway. The
 mere existence of a subway in P'yongyang seems
 unreal, given the state of transportation in the rest of
 the country. It is hardly typical of a country where
 most of the people walk to and from work and only the
 lucky are bused to their factories. Built deep under-
 ground to also serve as an air-raid shelter, the subway
 stations have marble floors and sculptured ceilings,
 exquisite chandelier lighting, and beautiful mosaics.
 For North Koreans the rebuilding has been dramatic.
 The whole country takes genuine pride in the city.
 This pride is reflected in the question North Koreans
 often ask foreigners: "Do you like our city? Is it

 pleasing? Tell us how to make it even better."
 believe that    som t
 people think that the improvements justify their hard
 work." They are particularly proud of the cleanliness
 of the city.
 Summary
 This description of life in North Korea presents to any
 Western observer a depressing picture of a highly
 regimented, disciplined, colorless, and tense society, in
 which life is hard, improving only at a glacial pace,
 and any fires of hope and ambition have been all but
 snuffed out. This is not necessarily the way people in
 North Korea see their lot, although there is ample
 evidence of frustration and unhappiness. The vast
 majority of citizens have known only authoritarian
 governments, first under the Japanese, briefly under
 Soviet occupation during 1945-48, and since then
 under Kim I1-song.
 At a minimum, Kim has established a government
 free of foreign domination, one that took the lead in
 rebuilding the country after the war, and now pro-
 vides jobs, housing, and security. Because of the
 isolation in which North Koreans have lived through-
 out this period and the constant drumbeat of propa-
 ganda that has compared their relative well-being
 with the "misery" of South Korea or other states, they
 have no basis for comparing their standard of living
 with that elsewhere.

 A key element in sustaining the regime's control and
 the essential docility and cooperation of the people has
 been the figure and personality of Kim I1-song. The
 careful and deliberate manner he has taken to groom
 his son to succeed him and to perpetuate his type of
 leadership reflects the difficulties he foresees once he
 is no longer on the scene. Kim probably is not so much
 worried about a sharp growth of dissidence or a
 breakdown in public discipline as he is in a slower
 unraveling of the control mechanisms that depend, to
 a large extent, on his unique personality as the
 unrivaled leader of North Korea for over 35 years.
