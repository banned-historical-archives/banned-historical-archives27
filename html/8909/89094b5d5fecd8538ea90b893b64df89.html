 LEBANON: Situation Report
 Christian and Lebanese leftist leaders, who were not
 represented at the Riyadh mini-summit, have reacted with pre-
 dictable skepticism to the agreement concluded there by Arab
 leaders on Monday. All sides are likely to play a waiting game
 until they have consulted with their allies.
 //Camille Shamun, the most intransigent of
 Christian leaders,      former Lebanese president Sulayman Franjiyah,
 and Phalanges military leader Bashir Jumayyil all have expressed
 strong doubts that the Riyadh accords can be implemented,I
 I       iPhalanges head Pierre Jumayyil, however, publicly
 welcome the agreement as a hopeful first step toward solving
 the crisis.
 Lebanese leftist leader Kamal Jumblatt has reacted
 with simi ar coolness to the Riyadh accords. Jumblatt said yes-
 terday, that the agreement cannot succeed unless Syrian troops
 withdraw from Lebanon and are replaced by security forces drawn
 from Egypt, Algeria,  Iraq, and other Arab League states.
 Military activity tapered off yesterday,  following
 the announcement at Riyadh that a general cease-fire is sched-
 uled to go into effect on Thursday. There were only sporadic
 artillery exchanges along Beirut's confrontation line in con-
 trast to the heavy and often random shelling in the capital
 over the weekend. Press reports indicate that Christian units
 exchanged artillery fire with Palestinian and Lebanese leftist
 forces in the Ala h area.

 Egyptian Foreign Minister Fahmi may be planning a
 trip to Moscow soon, possibly as early as next week.
 Although Fahmi's deputy denied to the US embassy on
 Monday any knowledge of a visit, an American journalist claims
 to have learned from another "high official" that the visit is
 in the offing and will be announced tomorrow.
 //President Sadat has been under occasional
 pressure from Fahmi and other advisers to improve ties with the
 Soviets in order both to counter the impression that Egypt is
 wholly dependent on the US and to induce Moscow to resume de-
 liveries of military equipment.//
 //Fahmi personally made a concerted effort
 early this summer to impress on Soviet and East European diplo-
 mats in Cairo that Egypt wants better ties with Moscow. Neither
 the Soviets nor the Egyptians pursued the initiative.//
 Throughout the summer, Sadat repeatedly attacked the
 Soviets in public statements, often linking them to Libya's
 subversive actions in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world.
 Cairo may now feel it advisable to reopen the channel to Mos-
 cow in the period before the US presidential election.
 II The Egyptians are counting on the US to resume nego-
 tiations with Israel next year on a Middle East settlement and
 to consider substantial military aid for Egypt, but they prob-
 ably hope to restore a degree of amicability in their relations
 with the USSR lest the diplomatic and military assistance from
 the US not materialize.

 RHODESIA:  Nationalist Unity
 //The "front line" African presidents apparently
 are determined to keep disputes among the Rhodesian national-
 ists from threatening the success of the Geneva conference. At
 a meeting in Lusaka on Sunday,  Zambian President Kaunda, Tan-
 zanian President Nyerere, Mozambican President Machel, and Bot-
 swanan President Khama reportedly informed leaders of all of
 the major nationalist groups that dissension among them at

 IRAN:   Krupp Purchase
 Iran has purchased a 25-percent interest in the hold-
 ing company that controls the Krupp conglomerate, a manufacturer
 of ships, steel, machinery, and electronics equipment. The firm
 also provides a broad range of trade and service activities.
 The purchase will guarantee Krupp's long-term involvement in
 Iran's economic development program.
 Iran purchased a 25-percent share in the Krupp iron
 and steel enterprise in 1974 and a 40-percent interest in two
 Brazilian subsidiaries of the conglomerate earlier this year.
 The joint announcement avoided any mention of the
 value ~he transaction.  It made clear, however, that Iran's
 25-percent interest would entitle it to exercise a managerial
 role in the corporation. Krupp enterprises suffered substan-
 tial losses last year; even greater losses have been forecast
 for 1976.
 II The Iranian infusion will provide Krupp with much
 needed operating capital.  Iran for its part, probably was mo-
 tivated by a desire to expand its access to Krupp's technology.

 EC: Negotiations
 //The EC made major progress in its efforts to ex-
 pand trade and improve political relations with the Arab states
 of the eastern Mediterranean last week with the initialing of
 an expanded preferential trade and aid agreement with Egypt.//

 //The Community is scheduled to si
 n simil
 g
 ar ac-
 cords with Jordan and Syria following talks later this month.
 Egypt already has a preferential trade agreement with the EC,
 but Jordan and Syria do not. The Nine had earlier anticipated
 that an agreement with Lebanon could be concluded as well, but
 the political situation in that country forced a halt in bi-
 lateral talks.//
 //EC foreign ministers are expected to
 approve all
 three agreements when they meet in Brussels in mid-November,
 thus paving the way for final signature in the Arab capitals
 later next month. This would be the final step toward attain-
 ing the EC's goal of a comprehensive Mediterranean policy,
 first suggested by France in 1972.//
 //The agreements--modeled on accords th
 e Community
 signed with Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia earlier this year--
 provide for preferential tariff reductions on minerals, indus-
 trial goods, and certain agricultural products. They also in-
 clude protocols on technical,  financial, economic, and environ-
 mental cooperation and establish joint committees to implement
 the agreements.//
 Q //The EC agreed to provide about $190 million in
 financial assistance to Egypt over five years. These funds, how-
 ever, would not be made available until all EC members have rat-
 ified the agreement. This process could take up to two years and
 the Egyptians--who initially asked for more than twice as much
 aid--are expected to push for much quicker access. Approximately
 $70,  $50, and $35 million in financial aid has been earmarked
 for Syria, Jordan,  and Lebanon respectively.//
 //Agreement on the financial assistance provisions
 for these eastern Mediterranean states has opened the way for
 a similar accord with Israel. Although the EC signed a prefer-
 ential trade agreement with Israel last year, it insisted, on
 political grounds, that negotiations for a supplementary finan-
 cial protocol proceed in parallel with the Arab talks. The Com-
 munity plans to loan the Israelis up to $35 million at market
 rates.//

 //Israel yesterday labeled the EC offer a symbolic
 gesture, and insisted that more aid is required to help narrow
 its huge trade gap with the EC, which amounted to $1.2 billion
 dollars last year.//
 //The EC foreign ministers will probably also ap-
 prove a major increase in Community food aid to Egypt at their
 Council in November. The Commission has proposed that the
 amount of wheat the EC provides Egypt be more than doubled, al-
 though vegetable oil and skim milk shipments would be maintained
 at the same levels.
 CIEC: Working Sessions Resume
 //The issue of'how to deal with developing country
 debt problems will highlight the meeting of the Conference on
 International Economic Cooperation that opens in Paris today.
 Most other issues are either close to being resolved or are
 being discussed in other forums. The developing countries at
 CIEC will also continue to demand protection for their earn-
 ings from exports of raw materials.//
 //Hanging over the week-long CIEC meeting will. be
 the oil price increase expected when the OPEC ministers meet
 in December. Most of the EC states are aware that if the devel-
 oping country demands are not satisfied at CIEC, the OPEC states
 will be able to cite this as an excuse on which to base the
 price increase.//
 //At the same time, some of the developing states
 may believe that the concessions they are seeking from the in-
 dustrialized states at CIEC would be jeopardized by an oil price
 increase. This could lead to pressure on OPEC to exercise re-
 straint in boosting oil prices. The CIEC ministerial review
 conference will take place in mid-December.//
 //A compromise on the debt issue during this CIEC
 meeting is unlikely. Nevertheless, delegates from the develop-
 ing and oil-producing states will probably not try to break
 off the talks as they did in July. Without concessions by the
 industrialized states at this session, however, the chances of
 the developing states forcing a clash next month or at the De-
 cember ministerial are considerably higher.//

 //The developing states have shown little willing-
 ness to compromise on the debt question. Virtually all of them
 have steadfastly endorsed the original demands, laid out last
 February, which call for immediate generalized debt relief and
 a refinancing of commercial debts. The proposals also specify
 individual country rescheduling according to relatively auto-
 matic procedures well in advance of crisis situations.//
 //The EC and the US proposed at the meetings last
 month that a differentiation be made between acute debt crises
 and longer term situations where the unavailability or poor
 management of financial resources hampers economic development.
 In the former case, the proposal focuses on a case-by-case ap-
 proach that recognizes responsibilities of both debtors and
 creditors.  In the less acute situations, the proposal suggests
 case-by-case examination of individual countries by an inter-
 national organization, such as the World Bank, leading to ne-
 gotiations between creditors and debtors.//
 //The EC Commission and most of the EC members--
 including, although to a limited degree, the West Germans
 whose position has been most similar to that of the US--now
 feel that they will have to be more forthcoming in December to   25X1
 avoid a breakdown of the talks.//
 .UN: Secretary General Candidates
 Mexican President Echeverria is unlikely to develop
 much support for his candidacy as UN Secretary General, but his
 announcement that he is available to run may reopen a question
 which appeared to have been settled.

 Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, who last week an-
 nounce                        is readiness to serve another five-year term--his cur-
 rent term expires on December 31--has been regarded as a shoo-
 in by most UN members. He has strong support from most of the
 regional groupings in the UN.
 Echeverria has been privately promoting his own can-
 didacy for some time, but with little success. His implicit at-
 tempt to gain third-world endorsement by playing host to the
 meeting last month on economic cooperation among developing
 countries was regarded by most participants as a failure. Even
 the majority of states from Latin America are not behind his
 candidacy, and the Organization of African Unity has formally
 endorsed Waldheim's re-election.
 The Africans, moreover, may prefer not to support a
 third-world candidate until one of their own is in a better po-
 sition to win the job in five years. The Senegalese head of the
 UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization--who is
 both black and a Muslim--would appear to have an excellent
 chance of gaining the nomination at that time. The Asians also
 are not strongly for Echeverria.
 I      IShould the contest be thrown open as a result of
 Echeverria's efforts, the Asians would be likely to support
 their own dark-horse candidate, Hamilton Amerasinghe, Sri
 Lanka's permanent UN representative and president of the current
 General Assembly.
 Crucial to Echeverria's candidacy is the support of
 China, a permanent member of the Security Council, whose posi-
 tion on the issue is not yet known. Some UN delegates attribute
 a reported earlier request by Peking for a delay in the elec-
 tion timetable to its anticipation of a formal announcement by
 Echeverria of his candidacy. Even if China should support
 Echeverria, he would probably be unable to swing enough third-
 world votes behind his candidacy to challenge Waldheim seriously.
 The election of the Secretary General--the timing of
 whit    as not been set--requires the support of the 15 Security
 Council members, including the five permanent members. The Coun-
 cil's choice is subsequently ratified by the full General As-
 sembly.

 INTERNATIONAL: European Joint Float
 //The readjustment last weekend in the pari-
 ties at which the currencies of the members of the European
 joint float are officially maintained against one another, was
 probably a compromise solution. The West German mark was re-
 valued 2 percent against the Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder,
 3 percent against the Swedish and the Norwegian crowns, and 6
 percent against the Danish crown.//
 //The other members had unanimously rejected
 West Germany's proposal in late September of an across-the-board
 5-percent revaluation of the mark. West Germany reportedly next
 planned to propose a temporary suspension of joint float pari-
 ties to allow the foreign exchange markets to establish a new
 set of equilibrium rates. The move on Sunday was apparently
 taken to stave off what West German Finance Minister Hans Apel
 described as a total collapse of the joint float.//
 //By minimizing parity changes within the snake,
 Belgium and the other smaller members are trying to avoid some
 of the costs of their more expansionary domestic policies. West
 Germany is in essence forced to pick up part of the bill for
 these policies in the form of higher import costs and support
 of the other members'  currencies in the exchange market.  In re-
 turn for agreeing to small rate changes, West Germany probably
 exacted promises of closer economic policy coordination from
 its snake partners.//
 //Although the mark revaluation may have a psycho-
 logical impact, its lasting economic effects are in doubt. Since
 the last mark revaluation in June 1973,  the economic performances
 of the snake members have diverged more than the 2 to 6 percent
 of the latest exchange rate realignment.//
 //The new realignment made up less than one third
 of the difference in price increases between West Germany and
 the other joint float members since mid-1973. Moreover, infla-
 tionary pressures still diverge widely. For example, wages are
 increasing three times as fast, on an average, in the five
 smaller joint float members than in West Germany.//

 The exchange markets are pessimistic about the realign-
 ment. Bankers and currency traders seem to feel that a change
 of two to three times the magnitude of the one made would be
 necessary to reflect economic reality.
 //The parity realignment is unlikely to stem specu-
 lation against the float currencies for more than a few months
 at best. West Germany, loathe to abandon Bundesbank monetary
 targets in order to intervene in the exchange market, will prob-
 ably demand additional action.  If the smaller members refuse
 realistic parity changes in the future, the Germans may decide
 that the cost of continuing the snake outweighs the benefits.//
 FRANCE - WEST GERMANY: NATO Troop Withdrawal
 I            //The French and West German defense ministers
 will meet this weekend to discuss the political and military
 implications of France's recently announced decision to withdraw
 14,000 troops from West Germany over the next two years,  leaving
 some 46,000 troops there.  French officials have told the Germans
 that the withdrawal is merely one aspect of an overall reorgan-
 ization of the French army.//
 //Under the reorganization plan,  about 5,000 men
 in three artillery regiments will be withdrawn this year. Two
 of these regiments will be equipped with Pluton tactical nuclear
 missiles and reassigned to units in northeastern France.//
 //The remaining 9,000 men will be returned gradu-
 ally to France in line with France's program to reorganize its
 six active divisions into 16 smaller divisions equipped with
 additional medium tanks and armored vehicles. The program, an-
 nounced this spring, calls for a slight reduction in the army's
 size and the elimination of certain intermediate levels of
 command.//
 I            //The reorganization is designed to facilitate
 command and control of the military forces.//

 //It is unclear what effect the reductions will
 have on the combat capability of the three smaller French divi-
 sions to be kept in West Germany. French officials claim that
 the overall military capability of these troops will be improved
 because a smaller, more mobile force will be better able to
 respond to a conventional military threat.//
 //The Germans, who requested the meeting this week-
 end, may be seeking a fuller explanation from the French of
 their motives in making the withdrawals.//
 //Although the Germans were informed of the with-
 drawals well in advance, they say that until the public announce-
 ment they were not aware that the withdrawals of the 9,000 troops
 were connected with the French army reorganization. The 9,000
 troops represent a reduction in the strength of French forces
 in West Germany of about 14 percent, more than double the per-
 centage of the reductions associated with reorganization of the
 French army. The reduction will occur at a much faster rate--two
 years as opposed to six for the reductions in France.
