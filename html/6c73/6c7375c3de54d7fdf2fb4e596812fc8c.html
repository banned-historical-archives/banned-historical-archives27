 Summary        This paper examines the problems of the Chinese Communist Party and
 Information available the remedies Beijing proposes to set its house in order. It provides a
 as of 28 August 1983 benchmark for later assessments of China's progress in making the party a

 more effective instrument of leadership. How Beijing handles its party
 problems will to an important extent determine China's prospects for
 leadership-and foreign and domestic policy-continuity during this
 decade.
 This winter the Chinese Communist Party begins a three-year rectification
 campaign that will pass judgment on each of the party's 40 million
 members. Deng Xiaoping sees the campaign as a way to purge opponents
 of his program, help party General Secretary Hu Yaobang (his chosen
 successor) consolidate his power, instill an ideological unity conducive to
 Deng's program, and refurbish the party's tarnished image. Hu will oversee
 the drive, and an orderly, successful campaign would help establish his
 leadership credentials in the public mind.
 Specifically targeted for removal are party members who participated in
 the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, who are corrupt, or who have
 consistently resisted Deng's political and economic reforms.
 estimates of the number to be expelled, ranging
 from 2 to 15 percent of the party membership. We estimate that the figure
 will fall in the middle ranges, between 2 million and 4 million.
 Deng has made extensive preparations for the campaign, creating special
 organs to run it and staffing them with close associates. The leadership,
 moreover, is determined that this campaign will not interfere with priority
 economic tasks as past ones have. As a result, we believe this campaign will
 be orderly and that excesses and violence will be rare.
 Despite Deng's preparations, we believe the rectification will encounter
 major problems that will complicate its implementation and limit its
 effectiveness. In particular, entrenched provincial factions will compete to
 control the campaign in their area, seeking to purge rivals and protect
 members without regard to Beijing's guidelines. Independent of formal
 factions is the tendency of officials at all levels to form patron-client
 relationships with the people above and below them. This guarantees that
 any cadre targeted by the campaign has a network of associates to turn to
 for help in slowing, if not defeating, the process.

 Beijing must also contend with officials who seek to push the campaign be-
 yond the limits set by Beijing. Many individuals will have private agendas
 and will see the rectification as an opportunity to settle old scores from the
 Cultural Revolution. They may also be inclined to use methods Beijing has
 outlawed-physical or mental abuse and public humiliation-that could
 spark incidents and disrupt production. In addition, the sheer magnitude of
 the campaign will severely task Beijing's ability to monitor and direct it.
 In this respect, the rectification will do little to improve the party's
 standing in the eyes of the people. Articles in the Chinese media and
 conversations with the Chinese themselves indicate that most see the party
 as a benevolent association interested only in preserving the privileges of its
 members. Nor do we expect the rectification to reform measurably the
 workstyle of party officials. Imperious behavior, abuse of position, and the
 importance of patron-client relationships will be as prevalent as ever.
 We do not believe that these probable failings of the campaign will pose
 grave problems for the regime. Some party elders have warned of a "Polish
 situation" in China unless the party is cleansed, but, in our opinion, the lev-
 el of popular disenchantment is not nearly that serious.
 Preoccupation with the purity of the party and revolutionary ideals may in
 fact be a declining concern, because the party is in transition from older
 revolutionaries, who seem to care most about these issues, to post-1949
 bureaucrats. In any case, we believe the rectification will advance Deng's
 most important aims-removing footdraggers and leftist opponents of
 Deng's line, improving Hu's succession prospects, and imposing an ideolog-
 ical uniformity based on Deng's ideas. To the degree the rectification
 achieves these ends, it will advance the transition to a new generation that
 has different priorities.

 China: Cleansing the Party-
 Rectification and Reform
 in the 1980s
 Introduction
 In its fourth decade of rule, the Chinese Communist
 Party has declared itself to be in a state of crisis.' The
 party's difficulties do not directly threaten its exist-
 ence or challenge its thorough penetration of Chinese
 society. In our view, however, the party does face an
 accumulation of interrelated problems in personnel,
 motivation, and public confidence that, taken togeth-
 er, impair its ability to direct China's modernization
 effortl
 The party has traditionally responded to internal
 troubles through what it terms "rectification," a
 process that in the broadest sense embraces reindoc-
 trination, disciplinary sanctions, and organizational
 measures-structural reform, recruitment, and purge
 of the membership.' During the long years of his rule,
 Mao initiated frequent rectification drives to rid the
 party of attitudes and behavior that fell short of his
 visionary standards. The first and perhaps most suc-
 cessful, the Yanan Rectification Movement of 1942-
 44, has set the standard for subsequent campaigns.
 Mao, who exercised almost total control over the
 Yanan rectification, used it to promote his own ideas
 against those of rival factions and to consolidate his
 power within the party. "Mao Zedong Thought"
 assumed an unchallengeable authority and was used
 to indoctrinate the thousands of new members who
 joined the party in the late 1930s and early 1940s but
 who had not been truly assimilated into its ranks.
 ' Allowing for the hyperbole that often marks propaganda, the
 imagery of crisis has characterized media discussions of the party
 since Deng's ascendancy in 1978. For example, Politburo Standing
 Committee member Chen Yun, second only to Deng Xiaoping in
 prestige, has called the correction of party shortcomings "a matter
 of life or death" for the party. See appendix A for a sampling of
 leaders' statements on the party crisis.
 Although this paper draws on the full ran a of intelligence
 it primarily relies on
 analysis of Chinese propaganda. Except where expressly stated, our
 attribution of attitudes to the Chinese leadership is based on our
 reading of important speeches, editorials, and press commentary.
 Rectification" -z engdun ("to correct" or "put in order")
 zuofeng ("workstyle"), but more commonly contracted simply to
 zhengfeng-is a usage uniquely Chinese. Mao apparently coined
 the term in his speech of February 1942 that inaugurated the
 Careful recruitment, disciplinary measures, and purge
 of unreliable members helped the party attain the
 organizational cohesiveness that contributed to vic-
 tory over the Nationalists.
 Deng Xiaoping and his reformist allies believe the
 party now requires similar medicine. Since the Third
 Plenum of the 11th Central Committee in December
 1978, the reformers have repeatedly attempted to
 organize their own systematic test of loyalty and
 ideological rectitude. After repeated delays, their
 rectification drive will begin later this year. Harking
 back to Yanan, Deng and company expect a
 partywide rectification to produce for them the same
 payoff as the Yanan movement yielded for Mao:
 political and ideological uniformity beneath a single
 standard.
 Motivations and Goals
 The State of the Party ... Deng and his reform allies
 consistently tout the party as indispensable to China's
 modernization. Yet the clear impression left by their
 statements is that, in their judgment, the party does
 not measure up to the task. In speeches and private
 statements, Deng and others have-correctly, in our
 view-pinpointed the party's major problems:
 ? It is dominated by elderly, increasingly inactive
 men-the average age on the Politburo is 73-of
 relatively unsophisticated, mostly peasant, origins.'
 Despite bureaucratic streamlining last year and the
 lure of lucrative pensions, many have resisted pres-
 sure to retire voluntarily and instead are preoccu-
 pied with preserving their positions and perquisites.
 This situation exists at every administrative level.
 ' The 12th Party Congress substantially lowered the average age of
 the Central Committee, but largely by adding a contingent of 25X1
 relatively younger members to the list of alternate, nonvoting       2:)A I
 members. The average age of full Central Committee members           LOA-1

 ? Training and ideological indoctrination under Mao
 inculcated a world view that in many ways is at
 variance with the modernization plans of the leader-
 ship. Half or more of the party's 40 million mem-
 bers were admitted during the Cultural Revolution
 era when requirements were slackened and virtually
 the sole criterion for membership was commitment
 to Mao's radically egalitarian ideas.
 ? The "leadership workstyle" of senior cadres is fre-
 quently out of step with current requirements for
 collegiality and consultation and is ill suited to the
 needs of the modernization program. Party officials,
 while not required to master technical information,
 must now demonstrate a sensitivity to technical
 problems and a willingness to defer to professional
 opinion. Longtime administrators habitually lead in
 an imperious manner, seem suspicious of expertise,
 and often place political or personal considerations
 ahead of the goals of their organizations.
 ? China's opening to the world has spurred a dramatic
 rise in the incidence of corruption by officias.
 party members
 ave een invo ve in more than 40 percent of all
 cases uncovered. In our judgment, this may be a
 conservative estimate; although party members rep-
 resent only 4 percent of China's population, they
 have far greater opportunities to manipulate the
 system and better means to avoid incrimination.
 ... and Its Consequences. The sad state of the party's
 membership-too often aged, inflexible, imperious,
 and corrupt-has aggravated other problems that
 together seriously impair the party's ability to provide
 the leadership Deng's goals require. Authoritative
 statements by party leaders and commentary in the
 official media leave the impression, which is re-
 inforced by conversations with the Chinese, that there
 are two related areas of concern.
 A Crisis of Confidence. Beijing recognizes that the
 wild swings of policy under Mao that culminated in
 the Cultural Revolution have cost it the support of
 broad segments of Chinese society. The purge of Hua
 Guofeng, Deng's preoccupation with the succession,
 and continued vacillation on fundamental issues re-
 inforce the impression that little has actually changed
 with the reformers in charge. Many Chinese believe
 that the party no longer has the vision, intelligence,
 and honesty needed to govern 1 billion people. Al-
 though it is difficult to measure the disaffection, its
 prominence as a propaganda theme and the reports of
 knowledgeable observers suggests that it is a signifi-
 cant problem within and outside of the party.
 We believe expanded economic relations with Japan,
 Hong Kong, and the West have added to the problem.
 Some Chinese are surprised by the wealth of the
 capitalist economies and have come to view Commu-
 nism as a system that has many of the disadvantages
 and few of the advantages of capitalism. This is
 compounded by the heightened sensitivity among
 Chinese to the privileged lives of party officials and
 their families and to abuses of their advantages.
 Recognizing the situation, Beijing lectures incessantly
 on the "superiority of the socialist system" and the
 indispensability of the Communist Party. In his ad-
 dress to the 12th Party Congress, for example, Gener-
 al Secretary Hu Yaobang devoted a long passage to
 contesting the view of some Chinese that Communism
 is but "a dim illusion" that had not been tested in
 practice. He maintained that "there is Communism
 everywhere in our daily life" and warned critics that
 failure to affirm the party's contributions amounted
 to "a grave error.'
 Ideological Drift. The death of Mao Zedong-howev-
 er inconsistent and mercurial were his proclamations
 near the end-created uncertainty about what consti-
 tutes dogma and what is heresy. Although the "Reso-
 lution of Questions of Party History" approved by the
 Sixth Plenum of the 11th Congress in June 1981
 attempted to make Mao's ideas fit China's reform
 program, Mao's intellectual legacy has become in-
 creasingly irrelevant to present concerns.
 Since initiation of the reform program at the Third
 Plenum, the official media have featured a running
 affirmation that Deng's policies are indeed socialist in

 nature. The continuing stream of pronouncements-
 each purportedly authoritative-indicate to us, how-
 ever, widespread skepticism and a concern by the
 reformers that their pragmatically framed policies
 still lack a sufficient ideological basis.
 Four Goals. This assessment of the party has shaped
 Deng's stated goals for the rectification:
 ? Inculcate thoroughly in the minds of party members
 the thinking underlying China's reform policies,
 thereby filling the ideological void left by Mao's
 death and reevaluation.
 ? Promote reform goals by finally purging or cowing
 "leftists" who rose to power during the Cultural
 Revolution era.
 ? Repair the party's image by promoting the achieve-
 ments of Chinese Communism and rejuvenating its
 membership-adding younger, better educated peo-
 ple and eliminating the more corrupt and incompe-
 tent.
 Deng has a fourth goal of equal or greater impor-
 tance-advancing the succession prospects of his pro-
 tege, Hu Yaobang. Hu has made great strides in
 building a power base in the party and government,
 but, if Deng died today, we believe Hu could still face
 a challenge from other members of the leadership."
 The rectification provides Hu and Deng with an
 opportunity to strengthen their grip on the party
 bureaucracy, particularly at the lowest levels where
 their influence is weakest. Organs charged with over-
 seeing the campaign are led by officials who have
 close ties to Hu.
 A successful campaign is important to Hu in another
 sense. He has labored in Deng's shadow and many
 Chinese do not see him as a leader in his own right.
 Moreover, some of the policies Hu has been associated

 Framework for Rectification
 In a sense, China has experienced an ongoing rectifi-
 cation since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central
 Committee in 1978.5 Beijing at one time or another
 has chastised "leftists," "bourgeois liberals," crimi-
 nals among officialdom, and ideologically slack party
 members. None of these efforts, however, has been
 integrated, systematic, or pursued with much vigor.
 The rectification campaign formally endorsed at the
 12th Party Congress in September 1982 is meant to
 be just that: comprehensive and vigorous. Hu an-
 nounced that it will last three years and involve a
 thorough, systematic review of all 40 million party
 ' Often the term "rectification" is not used to refer to a given
 campaign, but the effect remains the same. The "Three Anti,"
 "Five Anti," and "Anti-Rightist" campaigns of the 1950s, the
 Socialist Education Campaign and the Great Proletarian Cultural
 Revolution of the 1960s, and the "Criticize Lin Biao, Criticize
 Confucius" campaign and the purge of Gang of Four supporters in
 the 1970s were all rectification drives. Some were repeatedly
 identified as such, others were not.

 Preparations. Beijing has been laying the groundwork
 since the Third Plenum. Preparations include:
 ? Reestablishment at the plenum of a party Discipline
 Inspection Commission, which will play a major role
 in the rectification drive.
 ? Approval at the Fifth Plenum in February 1980 of
 "Guiding Principles of Inner Party Life," which
 establish standards of behavior for party members.6
 ? Publication, following the Sixth Plenum in June
 1981, of a "Resolution on Questions of Party Histo-
 ry" that officially criticized Mao and his policies
 and established an authoritative interpretation of
 the party's actions since 1949.
 ? Initiation of a nationwide campaign against eco-
 nomic crimes in 1982-identified as one of two
 priorities for the year-that targeted corrupt
 officials.
 ? A massive bureaucratic reorganization begun in
 1982 of China's three major institutions-party,
 state, and military-to improve their efficiency and
 install new leadership teams committed to the re-
 form agenda and to rectification goals.
 ? Promulgation at the 12th Party Congress of a new
 party constitution containing explicit passages on
 the duties of members and on disciplinary
 procedures.6
 ? Establishment following the panty congress of pilot
 rectification projects in selected organizations and
 localities in each of China's provincial level
 administrations.
 ? Publication and intensive propagandization of
 "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the writ-
 ings of Chen Yun, who is closely associated with the
 drive to reform party workstyle.

 ment, Beijing will follow the practice of some provin-
 cial trial rectification projects and establish an ad hoc
 "rectification office" at the outset of the campaign.
 Hu Qili may well direct its activities.
 Other major bureaucratic participants will be:
 ? The Discipline Inspection Commission and its sub-
 ordinates in every locality, which at the recent party
 congress were granted expanded investigatory
 powers.
 ? The Organization Department, which is the party's
 central personnel office.
 ? The Propaganda Department, which will have spe-
 cial responsibilities for preparing study materials
 and framing explanations of policy.
 Close associates of Deng or Hu direct each of these
 organs, with the possible exception of the Organiza-
 tion Department. Its director seems to be a career
 bureaucrat, but two of his deputies are associates of
 Hu.
 In addition, the investigatory organs of the Ministry
 of Public Security and the new Ministry of State
 Security will become involved if criminal misconduct
 is discovered. The rectification will also extend to the
 People's Liberation Army, with the prominent partici-
 pation of its General Political Department and its
 Discipline Inspection Commission.
 Guidelines. The final guidelines for the national
 rectification will be promulgated at the Second Ple-
 num of the 12th Congress, which is scheduled to
 convene in October 1983. The basic contours of the
 campaign, however, are already clear from the state-
 ments of leaders, media commentary on pilot projects,
 and the extensive propaganda on the rectification.
 Beijing has taken great care to distinguish the coming
 campaign from its antecedents conducted under Mao,
 which featured public humiliation and physical and
 mental abuse of the targets. Hu Yaobang especially
 will want to eschew the use of terror-never as central
 and systematic in China as in the Stalinist purges of
 the 1930s-because it would be reminiscent of the
 violent periods under Mao and would alienate many
 moderate party members who are his principal base of
 support.
 In media discussions of experimental projects, Beijing
 has sought to assure anxious party members that this
 rectification will be tightly controlled and will avoid
 the mass mobilization tactics that in the past fre-
 quently got out of hand. Beijing has repeatedly
 stressed the novelty-the "pioneering" aspect-of the
 coming campaign, arguing that trial runs would be
 unnecessary if Beijing merely intended to duplicate
 past campaigns. The media have also emphasized that
 the object is not to punish errant cadre but to educate
 them to Deng's point of view. Mao's old precept from

 the Yanan rectification, "curing the sickness to save
 the patient," is frequently invoked to characterize the
 favored approach. Leniency will be the rule in han-

 the media that it is not too late to confess and be

 suggested that   to 15 percent of the       2f-   ,

 will reduce the effectiveness of the campaign (dis-
 cussed elsewhere), we believe the total number re-
 moved from the party will probably fall into the 5- to
 10-percent range, approximately 2-4 million. The net
 reduction in the size of the party will be smaller,
 of course, because recruitment will accompany dis-

 saved.
 Assurances of leniency notwithstanding, the most
 important targets of rectification are already well
 marked and are those who, for a variety of reasons,
 are counted among the opponents of Deng's reforms.
 Beijing has especially singled out the Cultural Revo-
 lution activists-"beaters, smashers, and looters; fac-
 tionalists; and those who rose through rebellion"-
 whose past actions warrant severe treatment: purge
 and perhaps imprisonment. Two other special targets
 were named at the 12th Party Congress-people who
 are guilty of corruption and those who, after years of
 Beijing's efforts, persistently refuse to accept Deng's
 reform policies.
 Scope. All party members will submit to rectification
 but relatively few will face disciplinary measures. Not
 all who are found guilty of one or another deviation
 will lose their party membership. Some will receive
 reprimands, "reeducation," and another chance.' F_
 We have only a thin basis from which to judge the
 numbers of those to be purged from the party rolls.
 Late last year a frequently reliable Hong Kong
 publication quoted a leading discipline inspection
 figure, who said that rectification would eliminate
 some 2 million party members.
 2 to 3 percent of the membership would
 go, e tween-800,000 and 1 million. According to the
 Chinese media, of 14,000 party members in Liaoning
 Province's trial points, some 14 percent failed to
 qualify after their initial review. After rectification-
 including study, self-examination and criticism, and
 testimonials of changed outlooks-that percentage
 was reduced to 3.9.
 'Reeducation in China generally involves rotation to a party-run
 school for several months where the students read approved
 works-in this case, the rectification syllabus including the works
 of Deng, Chen Yun, and select party documents-and criticize
 missals
 Mechanics of Rectification
 A Third Plenum of the 12th Central Committee, now
 slated for December 1983, will mark the formal
 opening of rectification activities. Although the party
 has thus far sought to allow for slippage in starting-
 the formal codification of rectification guidelines, for    25X1
 example, is almost certainly a contentious process-
 Hu Yaobang's mention of October and December
 party plenums
 indicates that the initial deadlines have been met. We
 have no information on the timetable of the campaign,
 other than it is to last three years and that its           25X1
 conclusion will, according to Hu, coincide with the
 party's 13th national congress.
 We expect this campaign to unfold as similar large,
 time-consuming campaigns have. At the outset, all
 the major Chinese publications will run editorials,
 news reports, and analytical commentary that discuss
 the rectification in its various dimensions. Party
 groups will be spurred to conscientious fulfillment of
 the requirements levied by higher levels, typical
 results at different administrative levels will be dis-
 cussed, and almost certainly a particularly unrepen-
 tant few will be held up publicly as negative examples.
 By allowing three years for rectification work, Beijing
 presumably hopes to integrate the campaign into the
 normal rhythm of Chinese life and minimize the
 disruptions it will cause in work units. There will

 Scenes from the Cultural Revo-

 "dragging out" officials for
 public humiliation, characteris-

 coming campaign, those who

 scores they may try to settle.

 Secret
 We expect those units that have completed the process
 of bureaucratic reorganization-scheduled for com-
 pletion at all levels next year-to take the lead in
 rectification. Chinese media indicate that cadres will
 be rotated into classes, where they will receive special
 instruction on the texts that form the core curriculum
 on the rectification syllabus: such items as the
 "works" of Deng and Chen Yun, the documents of the
 various plenary sessions, and the party constitution.
 The campaign will probably begin simultaneously at
 all levels; in our judgment, rectification of the higher
 levels will not necessarily be a prerequisite for com-
 mencement of activities at lower levels.
 75 to 80 percent of all party members will
 require "reeducation," and we believe study will
 indeed be the main focus of the activities. As media
 commentary suggests, at each level and in every
 organization the contingent of party members will be
 divided into groups that will be rotated into rectifica-
 tion sessions. Most of the practical work-study, self-
 criticism, criticism of one's peers-will be guided by
 the grass-roots leadership in small party groups of 15
 or so members.
 Media commentary on the pilot rectification projects
 indicates how the process is supposed to unfold within
 the small groups. An April 1983 People's Daily piece
 that commended the experience of a county in Anhui
 stated local cadres responsible for the rectification
 evaluated each party member according to the party
 constitution and "six checks."' Afterward, written
 self-appraisals by each party member formed the
 basis for group discussion, criticism, and self-
 criticism, which sought to reconcile the member's
 initial evaluation with his self-appraisal. The mem-
 ber's party branch then made a final appraisal to
 determine whether the member qualified for recertifi-
 cation or if additional remedial measures were
 required.
 "Check to see whether one's belief in Communism is firm,
 whether one is maintaining political consistency with the Central
 Committee, whether one is serving the people wholeheartedly,
 whether one is taking the lead in completing the tasks handed down
 from higher authorities, whether law and discipline are observed,
 and whether one dares to struggle against unhealthy tendencies."
 Disciplinary problems uncovered during the course of
 the investigations will generally be disposed of by the
 immediate party branch or the next higher level.
 Severe cases-those involving possible expulsion from
 the party-generally will be referred to the local
 Discipline Inspection Commission at or above the
 county level and may entail the weighing of criminal
 charges. Moreover, Beijing is prepared to intervene
 directly in particularly tough cases, as it did earlier
 this year during the implementation of provincial
 party and state reorganization.
 Although Beijing seeks to create the impression that a
 high level of impartiality will be observed with no
 cases decided beforehand,
 the process of labeling targets began
 shortly after the 12th Party Congress. In one prov-
 ince, for example, party organs were instructed to sort
 members into three categories: those who should be
 reregistered, those who should be encouraged not to
 reregister, and those who would not be permitted to.
 25X1
 Problems Ahead
 Beijing's extensive preparations notwithstanding, the 25X1
 planned rectification remains a task of staggering
 magnitude. The Chinese Communist Party has 40
 million members organized into more than 2 million
 primary party organizations, each anxious to protect
 his job and perquisites." Party membership is the
 indispensable entree to the best China has to offer.
 Loss of membership affects occupational prospects
 and salary, living quarters, access to small luxuries,
 educational opportunities for family members-in
 short, virtually every important aspect of material life.
 Party members facing rectification-and especially
 those anticipating the ultimate sanction, dismissal-
 can be expected to do everything within their power to
 protect their "rice bowls."                         25X1

 As the campaign unfolds, we believe Beijing will
 encounter serious problems that will complicate im-
 plementation of its guidelines and limit the effective-
 ness of the rectification. We expect at least three
 kinds of difficulties: local conditions that restrict
 Beijing's reach, movement of the campaign in unin-
 tended directions, and limits on the resources Beijing
 -can expend on rectification goals
 Constraints. Political factions constitute one of two
 major obstacles to achieving rectification goals. Gen-
 erally formed during the political warfare of the
 Cultural Revolution, factions remain powerful in
 some provinces-Guangxi and Fujian are two promi-
 nent examples-and resist efforts to disrupt estab-
 lished local patterns of political behavior.
 We believe local factions will compete for control over
 the rectification process and will seek to protect their
 own members while directing criticism at rivals,
 regardless of Beijing's guidelines. During the recent
 government reorganization-another livelihood issue
 inciting keen factional concern-entrenched factions
 responded in typically protective fashion, attempting
 to win places within the new government teams and
 thereby protect their local standing.
 The central leadership recognizes this danger and is
 attempting to cope with it. The national press in
 recent months has railed against factionalism, and
 some of the more blatant factional leaders will be
 prominent targets of the rectification drive. The
 ongoing government reorganization at all levels has
 changed the top leadership in most provinces, partly
 to ensure that key leaders are in step with Beijing's
 plans for party reform. As outsiders recently assigned,
 however, the new leaders are at a disadvantage in
 dealing with these strongly entrenched groups.
 We believe that Beijing will have only limited success
 in reducing the influence of local factions. We suspect
 that in many cases Beijing will ultimately be forced to
 resort to the time-tested practice of choosing among
 local factions, co-opting the one group most in tune
 with the reform program. The price will be some
 watering down of campaign standards, and the time-
 consuming process of forging the new local coalitions
 will almost certainly delay other political initiatives-
 Guanxi, or simple patron-client protectionism, is the
 other great challenge to the campaign. Although
 guanxi is the basic building block of factions, it more
 routinely operates as the mundane exchange of per-
 sonal favors on a 1-to-1 basis. Use of guanxi relations
 to gain preferential treatment, whether for the pur-
 chase of a special holiday food or for securing the
 admission of a child to a prestigious university, is a
 basic feature of both official and nonofficial Chinese
 life. Local officials generally have reciprocal personal
 relationships with senior cadre, and those who become
 targets of the campaign will appeal to their mentors
 for support.10
 Official press commentary on the trial projects indi-
 cates that Beijing recognizes the threat posed by
 personal relationships among officials, and we believe
 Beijing will have greater success here, where individ-
 uals do not enjoy the thick cover of an entrenched
 faction. Patrons will be hard pressed to protect client
 officials who are clearly marked targets of rectifica-
 tion, but they can slow the process and make things
 difficult for campaign administrators.
 Fear of retaliation often has a dampening effect on
 enthusiasm for campaigns that call for officials to
 candidly evaluate junior and senior associates by
 political criteria, and, given the stakes in this one, we
 believe officials may be more cautious than usual.
 Cadre caution is a direct legacy of the Mao era, when
 policies changed on a year-to-year basis, and those
 who faithfully implemented one year's policies found
 themselves accused of political crimes the next. We
 believe that the experience of the Cultural Revolution
 was so traumatic that rectification leaders can do
 little to dispel the inherent paranoia of officials "twice
 burned."
 Vague guidelines or virtually any sign of political
 disunity in Beijing will provide a pretext for lower
 jurisdictions to slow the campaign and await direct
 instructions from higher levels. Central directives are

 characteristically written in general terms to permit
 some flexibility for dealing with local peculiarities.
 We expect local cadres to seize on this customary
 imprecision-as they often have in the past-to put
 off hard decisions.
 Zealots. While cadres attempting to slow the rectifi-
 cation will be Beijing's main concern, it must also
 control the overenthusiasm of those who would push
 the drive beyond its intended limits. The party leader-
 ship wants to prevent the rectification from interfer-
 ing with priority tasks in the economy, research, and
 other key areas. Previous campaigns under Mao
 disrupted all aspects of Chinese life, causing enor-
 mous economic losses and social tensions. Officials
 will have to balance economic requirements with
 conflicting political demands while maintaining work
 force morale under stressful conditions.
 Although the problem of excessive enthusiasm was
 greater under Mao than under Deng, Beijing has
 nevertheless felt compelled to repeatedly affirm the
 requirement to run a "gentle and mild" rectification.
 Important People's Daily commentary as well as trial
 project reports prohibit rectification administrators
 from working within "`leftist' conventions" estab-
 lished under Mao. These involved such practices as
 long and violent "struggle" sessions, physically abu-
 sive public pillorying of errant individuals, and pun-
 ishing entire families for the errors of a single
 member
 There is little doubt, however, that some officials have
 private agendas and will attempt to use the rectifica-
 tion to settle old political scores. This will raise the
 stakes and the temperature of the campaign in some
 areas and introduce more desperate methods on the
 part of both accused and accusers. We do not expect,
 however, the rioting and upheaval associated with the
 Cultural Revolution, in part because the central lead-
 ership is more unified now and there is no authorita-
 tive voice-such as Mao's-willing to sanction such
 behavior
 Central Overload. The addition of rectification, with
 its attendant problems and demands, to the already-
 crowded agenda for 1983 may greatly increase the
 workload for hard-pressed central organizations,
 themselves under mandate to streamline. Because of
 local resistance, we believe Beijing will be forced to
 rely heavily on central work teams to accomplish its
 goals. As happened when provincial governments and
 party committees were reorganized earlier this year,
 Beijing may not allow local officials to make major
 decisions in any case. Central administrators may
 insist that most difficult cases be referred to Beijing
 for review and final disposition. Appeals from lower
 levels will also clutter the process. Under these cir-
 cumstances, rectification will be a serious drain on
 central resources and energy, and Beijing's efforts to
 control each aspect seems to us certain to decrease
 efficiency and slow the process.
 Prospects
 Personnel. The problems Beijing will encounter en-
 sure that the rectification will not be as thorough as
 Deng might hope, but, in our judgment, Beijing will
 succeed in removing the most blatant opponents of
 Deng's program and in upgrading party ranks some-
 what by removing some of the more corrupt and
 incompetent cadres. Deng and his allies will thus
 accomplish what they regard as the most important
 goal of the campaign, the purge of the party's least
 trustworthy members. We also believe the structures
 and guidelines established by Beijing are sufficiently
 strong to prevent the campaign from sparking social
 disorder.
 These personnel successes will assist Hu Yaobang in
 imposing his own stamp on the party and will improve
 his odds for inheriting Deng's place as first among
 equals within the Chinese leadership. We believe
 Deng and his allies will also make strides toward
 cementing a new ideological orthodoxy based on ideas
 of Deng and other party elders.
 Ideological unity beneath a new standard may be
 superficial, however. Party pronouncements on ideo-
 logical issues indicate that Mao's egalitarian vision
 still appeals to many Chinese and that the ideas of
 Deng and his reformist associates remain controver-
 sial. We believe the rectification is more likely to
 silence ideological critics than eradicate them

 The Party's Standing. We do not believe that the
 rectification alone will produce a substantial improve-
 ment in the public image of the party. The party can
 justifiably claim-without having had a rectifica-
 tion-that life is now more agreeable for the vast
 majority of Chinese than it was under Mao Zedong.
 Yet, except for the more settled political climate in
 China-which admittedly is a basic background con-
 dition for all undertakings-Beijing has difficulty
 convincing its populace of the party's indispensable
 role in recent Chinese successes. Many of these
 achievements-in agriculture, foreign trade, and edu-
 cation, for example-are in areas where the party has
 generally withdrawn its hand or has merely reversed
 bankrupt and irrational policies it once endorsed. It is
 difficult, for example, for the party to take credit for
 the successive years of relatively good weather or for
 the native industry of the average Chinese peasant-
 key factors in recent economic growth.
 These favorable developments, moreover, do little to
 shake the basic impression of the party that, in our
 judgment, is widely held among the populace. Articles
 in the Chinese media and conversations with the
 Chinese themselves indicate that many-and perhaps
 most-Chinese tend to see the party as a benevolent
 association interested only in preserving the privileges
 and perquisites of its members and their friends. We
 believe problems such as abuse of privilege, individual
 corruption, and imperious leadership are seen by
 many influential Chinese-and especially intellectu-
 als and students-as ingrained and endemic to the
 system.
 By reducing some of the more egregious occurrences
 of cadre malfeasance, bringing in some new blood and
 fresh ideas, and obtaining a degree of ideological
 consistency, the party may be able to convince the
 Chinese of its determination to make a new start.
 However, we judge a return to the pervasive sense of
 trust and sacrifice that characterized the Chinese
 mentality in the early 1950s is virtually impossible in
 these more cynical times.

 effectively through guanxi. Although "democratic
 centralism" and collegial rule are fashionable terms in
 the official media, the rectification will do little to
 circumscribe the vast authority and influence of indi-
 vidual party leaders. Abuse of power, imperiousness,
 and the continued indispensability to the system of a
 single authoritative leader-Deng, for now-are be-
 A Declining Concern? The shortcomings of the cam-
 paign are not serious failings, in our judgment, and do
 not pose grave problems for the regime, at least in the
 short run. Some party elders, most notably Chen Yun,
 have warned repeatedly that unless the party is
 cleansed a "Polish situation" could eventually develop
 in China. There is always a strong element of hyper-
 bole in such pronouncements, and, in our opinion, the
 level of popular disenchantment is not nearly that
 serious. Traditional cultural constraints, the generally
 passive tenor of popular disenchantment with the
 party, and the efficiency of the Chinese security
 system together argue against the Polish scenario. An
 inability to refurbish the party's image and to create a
 more energetic and selfless cadre may slow the mod-
 ernization effort but, in our view, will not derail it.
 The party's concern about its image and revolutionary
 heritage may be a declining one, for the regime is in a
 period of transition. The days of the old revolu-
 tionaries-Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, and their
 kind-who earlier were driven by their ideals to join
 the revolution and who recall and seek a return to
 "the Yanan spirit" are fast fading. They will eventu-
 ally be replaced by the products of the system they
 helped create, men and women born since 1949 who,
 if current trends proceed unhindered, will be more in
 the current Soviet and East European mold, gradu-
 ates of the polytechnical institutes, and more con-
 cerned with securing the perks of the present society
 than advancing the revolution. These are the people to
 whom the party is now most favorably disposed. To
 the degree the rectification removes the leftists and
 consolidates the influence of Hu, the campaign will
 enhance their numbers and advance this transition.
 Workstyle. We also expect the rectification to leave
 the basic style of Chinese politics unchanged. Despite
 reforms that ostensibly enlarge the authority of orga-
 nizations, men remain more important than institu-
 tions, and things will continue to get done more

 Leadership Comments on China's
 Party Problem
 "The decade of domestic turmoil (1966-76: the Cul-
 tural Revolution) confounded the criteria of right and
 wrong, good and evil, beauty and ugliness. It is much
 more difficult to undo its grave spiritual consequences
 than its material ones. For this and other reasons,
 many serious problems concerning standards of social
 conduct now exist in our country. The Central Com-
 mittee of the party is determined to effect a funda-
 mental turn for the better in standards of social
 conduct in the next five years....
 "The view that Communism is but a `dim illusion' and
 that it `has not been tested in practice' is utterly
 wrong. There is Communism everywhere in our daily
 life, of which it forms an inseparable part....
 "All the splendid successes of the party and the people
 have been achieved precisely through the inspiring
 example given by such a fine core of members of the
 party. This is the principal aspect of our party, and
 whoever fails to see it, or deliberately denies it, is
 committing a grave error....
 "(If we believe otherwise) we will not be able to
 safeguard the socialist orientation of China's modern-
 ization, and our socialist society will lose its ideals and
 objectives, its spiritual motivation and fighting will,
 lose the ability to resist the inroads of corrupt influ-
 ences and even develop distortedly and degenerate.
 Comrades, this is not just alarmist talk but a conclu-
 sion drawn from present realities at home and
 abroad."

 "Our party actually needs rectification at present.
 This matter was put forth seven years ago and it has
 not yet been settled. Quite a number of the 38 million
 party members are not up to the mark."
 Deng Xiaoping
 February 1980
 "The pressing issue before us is to restore the party's
 fighting capabilities. The party should be a combat
 force, the vanguard of the proletariat.... At present,
 some of our party members are not qualified. Some of
 the new members who joined our ranks when the
 ultraleftist line held sway have never received any
 party education. They cannot set an example for the
 masses and are therefore not qualified. Some of our
 old party members have measured up to the require-
 ments for a long time. However, they cannot set an
 example for the masses now and are therefore not so
 qualified. We advocate the party spirit and oppose
 factionalism. Some people desperately cling to their
 faction. There are many people whose factional spirit
 is higher than their party spirit, and among them are
 some of our old party members."

 necessary first of all to improve the party's work-

 Appendix B
 Documents
 Extracts from Guiding Principles for Inner-Party
 Political Life (adopted by the Fifth Plenary Session of
 the 11th Central Committee, February 1980):
 After nationwide liberation (in October 1949) the
 masses of party members in the main upheld the
 party's fine traditions and workstyle.... However,
 because some comrades became arrogant and compla-
 cent as a result of the victory of the revolutionary
 struggle and the position gained by the party as the
 ruling party for the entire country, because of the
 imperfect system of democratic centralism in the
 party and state and because of the influence of the
 ideology of the feudal and capitalist classes, such
 unhealthy tendencies as being divorced from reality
 and the masses, subjectivism, bureaucracy, making
 arbitrary decisions, taking peremptory actions and
 seeking privileges had developed. At the same time,
 there were some shortcomings and mistakes in guid-
 ing the inner-party struggle (between "correct" and
 "incorrect" viewpoints), and normal inner-party polit-
 ical life was impaired to a certain extent ...
 (especially) during the Great Cultural Revolution....
 In order to achieve the all-round revival and further
 development of the party's fine traditions and work-
 style, strengthen the party's democratic life, safe-
 guard the party as a centralized and unified one,
 strengthen party unity, consolidate party organization
 and discipline, and enhance the party's fighting ca-
 pacity, the Central Committee, in view of the present
 condition of the party, hereby reiterates the following
 guidelines for inner-party political life to the whole
 party:
 1. Adhere to the party's political and ideological
 line.... (This is) the most fundamental guiding
 principle.... In order to adhere to the correct politi-
 cal and ideological lines, it is necessary to oppose
 erroneous ideological tendencies. First, it is necessary
 to oppose ossification of the mind and proceeding by
 the book in everything we do (references to Mao)....
 Second, it is essential to oppose and repudiate the
 erroneous view and revisionist ideological trend of
 negating the socialist road, the dictatorship of
 the proletariat, party leadership, and Marxism-
 Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought (the "Four Funda-
 mental Principles")....
 2. Uphold collective leadership and oppose arbitrary
 decisionmaking by a single person.... In deciding
 matters within a party committee, it is essential to act
 in strict accordance with the principle that the minor-
 ity is subordinate to the majority.... The secretary or
 the first secretary ... is not allowed to practice "what
 I say goes" or a patriarchal system....
 3. Safeguard the party's unity and centralized leader-
 ship and strictly abide by party discipline.... It is
 necessary to solemnly reiterate that "the individual is
 subordinate to the organization, the minority to the
 majority, the lower level to the higher level, and the
 entire party to the Central Committee." ... Differing
 views ... may be discussed within the party on proper
 occasions. As for when and in what manner they
 should be discussed in the press, this should be
 decided by the party Central Committee (or, more
 accurately, the Politburo or Secretariat).... But
 under no circumstances must anyone be allowed to
 express in the press or on the radio any views contrary
 to the Central Committee's decisions, nor must any-
 one be allowed to spread among the masses any views
 contrary to the party's line, principles, policies, and
 decisions....
 4. Uphold party spirit and root out factionalism....
 Organizing secret groups within the party is the crime
 of splitting and subverting the party.... Although
 there are now no overt factions within the party, some
 cadres and party members ... still harbor factional-
 ism and are even still carrying out factional
 activities.... The "specter" of factionalism is still
 there, and factionalists often resist implementation of
 the party's principles and policies and higher level
 decisions.... A Communist must play an exemplary
 role among the masses, be the first to bear hardships
 and the last to enjoy comforts....

 5. Speak the truth and match words with deeds.... A
 Communist must be faithful and candid and never
 hide his own mistakes and his own thinking and views
 from the party organization....
 6. Promote inner party democracy and take a correct
 attitude toward dissenting views.... Say all you
 know and say it without reserve. Those who made
 wrong remarks or wrote erroneous articles owing to
 their wrong understanding should not be regarded as
 having violated party discipline, and disciplinary ac-
 tions should not be taken against them as long as they
 do not oppose the party's basic political stand, intrigue
 and conspire, carry out factionalist and splittist activi-
 ties among the masses, spread fallacies that run
 counter to the party line, or betray the secrets of the
 party and the state. It is necessary to strictly uphold
 the principle of "three nots"-not seizing on others'
 faults, not putting labels on people, and not using the
 big stick (practices that characterized the Mao
 era).... To oppose the opinion of a certain comrade is
 not the same as opposing the comrade himself....
 7. Protect the rights of party members against any
 encroachment.... Party members have the right ...
 at party meetings to criticize any party organization
 or any individual.... Party organizations should wel-
 come criticism and suggestions from the masses of
 party members.... Party members have the right to
 present-at party meetings or to higher organizations
 up to the Central Committee-their statements, ap-
 peals, accusations, and defense regarding the party
 organizations' manner of handling them or other
 persons.... Retaliation against the appealing party
 and the accusers is not allowed....
 8. Elections should fully embody the electors'
 wishes.... The number of candidates shall be greater
 than the number of delegates to be elected.... All
 elections shall be held by secret ballot....
 9. Struggle against erroneous tendencies, bad people,
 and bad actions.... If Communist Party members
 assume a liberal attitude of being worldly and playing
 safe toward erroneous tendencies, bad people, and bad
 actions and avoid them instead of stopping, contest-
 ing, or denouncing them, then they have shirked their
 fighting responsibility and have demonstrated a lack
 of party spirit....
 10. Treat correctly comrades who have made
 mistakes.... In carrying out inner-party struggle our
 party's fine tradition is to follow the principle of
 "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones and
 curing the sickness to save the patient." . . . As for
 those comrades who have erred, we must historically
 and comprehensively evaluate their contributions,
 mistakes, rights and wrongs, and must not totally
 repudiate their contributions just because of a mis-
 take; nor should we continue to quibble over old
 problems and mistakes that have already been investi-
 gated and corrected.... It is impermissible to engage
 in ruthless struggle or to deal merciless blows.... The
 so-called drag out and struggle against is strictly
 forbidden, as is physical humiliation and persecution
 and inducing and coercing a person to make a confes-
 sion....
 11. Accept supervision by the party and the masses-
 no one is allowed to seek privileges.... Leading
 cadres at all levels are public servants.... Although it
 is necessary to provide leaders with certain rational
 conveniences and ensure their security according to
 the necessity of work, violating the system to seek
 special privileges is by no means permissible....
 Everyone stands equal. before party discipline and
 state laws.... Leading personnel are prohibited ...
 from using their position and power to seek preference
 for their family or relatives in such matters as enroll-
 ment in schools, transferring from one school to
 another, promotions, employment, and going
 abroad....
 12. Study hard and strive to be both Red and
 Expert.... "Red" means possession of a firm, correct
 political orientation and the upholding of the four
 fundamental principles. "Expert" means to learn and
 master a professional understanding of modernization
 and to become a professional and good at one's work.
 To become Expert does not necessarily mean one has
 become Red, but to become Red one must be
 Expert.... To be content with exercising vague lead-
 ership in general terms, to be satisfied with being
 laymen indefinitely, to be ignorant and incompetent,
 to act in contradiction to objective laws or to give
 arbitrary and impracticable direction will undoubted-
 ly seriously harm modernization. Persons who act like
 this should be removed from leading posts if they
 cannot correct themselves through criticism and
 education.

 Party Discipline
 Article 38. A Communist Party member must consci-
 entiously act within the bounds of party discipline.
 Party organizations shall criticize, educate, or take
 disciplinary measures against members who violate
 party discipline....
 Party members who violate the law and administra-
 tive discipline shall be subject to administrative disci-
 plinary action or legal action instituted by administra-
 tive or judicial organs. Those who have seriously
 violated criminal law shall be expelled from the party.
 Article 39. There are five measures of party disci-
 pline: warning, serious warning, removal from party
 posts and proposals for removal from nonparty posts
 to the organizations concerned, placing on probation
 within the party, and expulsion from the party....
 Disciplinary Procedures
 Article 40. Any disciplinary measure against a party
 member must be discussed and decided on at a
 general membership meeting of the party branch
 concerned, and reported to the primary party commit-
 tee concerned for approval. If the case is relatively
 important or complicated, or involves the expulsion of
 a member, it shall be reported, on the merit of that
 case, to a party commission for discipline inspection at
 or above the county level for examination and approv-
 al. Under special circumstances, a party committee or
 a commission for discipline inspection at or above the
 county level has the authority to decide directly on
 disciplinary measures against a party member.
 Any decision to remove a member or alternate mem-
 ber of the Central Committee or a local committee at
 any level from posts within the party, to place such a
 person on probation within the party or to expel him
 from the party must be taken by a two-thirds majority
 vote at a plenary meeting of the party committee to
 which he belongs. Such a disciplinary measure against
 a member or alternate member of a local party
 committee is subject to approval by the higher party
 committees.
 Members and alternate members of the Central Com-
 mittee who have seriously violated criminal law shall
 be expelled from the party on decision by the Political
 Bureau (Politburo) of the Central Committee; mem-
 bers and alternate members of local party committees
 who have seriously violated criminal law shall be
 expelled from the party on decisions by the standing
 committees of the party committees at the corre-
 sponding levels.
 Article 41. When a party organization decides on a
 disciplinary measure against a party member, it
 should investigate and verify the facts in an objective
 way. The party member in question must be informed
 of the decision to be made and of the facts on which it
 is based. He must be given a chance to account for
 himself and speak in his own defense. If the member
 does not accept the decision, he can appeal, and the
 party organization concerned must promptly deal
 with or forward his appeal, and must not withhold or
 suppress it. Those who cling to erroneous views and
 unjustifiable demands shall be educated by
 criticism....
 Discipline Inspection Organization
 Article 43. The party Central Commission for Disci-
 pline Inspection functions under the leadership of the
 Central Committee of the party. Local commissions
 for discipline inspection at all levels function under
 the dual leadership of the party committees at the
 corresponding levels and the next higher commissions
 for discipline inspection.
 ... The question of whether a primary party commit-
 tee should set up a commission for discipline inspec-
 tion or simply appoint a discipline inspection commis-
 sioner shall be determined by the next higher party
 organization in the light of specific circumstances....
 The party's Central Commission for Discipline In-
 spection shall, when its work so requires, accredit
 discipline inspection groups or commissioners to party
 or state organs at the central level....

 Secret
 Article 44. The main tasks of the central and local
 commissions for discipline inspection are as follows: to
 uphold the Constitution and the other important rules
 and regulations of the party, to assist the respective
 party committees in rectifying party style, and to
 check up on the implementation of the line, principles,
 policies, and decisions of the party.
 The central and local commissions for discipline
 inspection shall carry out constant education among
 party members on their duty to observe party disci-
 pline; they shall adopt decisions for the upholding of
 party discipline, examine and deal with relatively
 important or complicated cases of violation of the
 Constitution and discipline of the party or laws and
 decrees of the state by party organizations or party
 members; decide on or cancel disciplinary measures
 against party member involved in such cases; and deal
 with complaints and appeals made by party members.
 The central and local commissions for discipline
 inspection should report to the party committees at
 the corresponding levels on the results of their han-
 dling of cases of special importance or complexity, as
 well as on the problems encountered. Local commis-
 sions for discipline inspection should also present such
 reports to the higher commissions.
 If the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection
 discovers any violation of party discipline by a mem-
 ber of the Central Committee, it may report such an
 offense to the Central Committee, and the Central
 Committee must deal with the case promptly.
 Article 45. Higher commissions for discipline inspec-
 tion have the power to check up on the work of the
 lower commissions and to approve or modify their
 decisions on any case. If decisions so modified have
 already been ratified by the party committees at the
 corresponding level, the modification must be ap-
 proved by the next higher party committee.
 If a local commission for discipline inspection does not
 agree with a decision made by the party committee at
 the corresponding level in dealing with a case, it may
 request the commission at the next higher level to
 reexamine the case; if a local commission discovers
 cases of violation of party discipline or the laws and
 decrees of the state by the party committee at the
 corresponding level or by its members, and if that
 party committee fails to deal with them properly or at
 all, the local commission has the right to appeal to the
 higher commissions for assistance in dealing with
 such cases.
