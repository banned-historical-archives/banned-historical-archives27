 201.  President Eise-'tower's Trip to Latin Am
 erica
 February 22   esident' :.senhowe       will begie- s ten-day trip to the four
 southern Latin American republics of Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay,
 returning approximately 4 March to the US after a brief stop in Puerto Rico.
 Current plans indicate he will tae in Brazil 23-26 February, Argentina 26-29
 February, Chile 29 February-2 March, Uruguay 2-3 March. He will be accom-
 panied by Secretary of State Herter, Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom and
 other officials concerned with Latin American affairs. The trip is essentially a
 good will mission with discussion of substantive issues to be kept to a minimum.
 Reasons for the trip at this time are to reassure Latin America of our concern
 for her problems, to demonstrate US good intentions toward helping to build a
 stable, economically sound Latin America, and to strengthen inter-American
 political and economic solidarity. The selection of Brazil, Argentina, Chile and
 Uruguay for the visit indicate the importance of these countries as leaders on the
 continent. Relations with Brazil which were decidedly cool during 1959 as a result
 of US unwillingness to provide large-scale economic aid have improved and should
 be given a boost by this visit. The President's visit may have the effect of increas-
 ing the waning prestige of the Argentine Government which is in a precarious
 position politically and economically. The President is visiting Chile because it is
 considered to be a political and cultural leader in Latin America, and Uruguay
 because it is an example of democratic stability. It does not appear likely that the
 visit will meet with any large-scale, organized opposition or will be subject  to
 deliberate planned attacks by the Communists as in the case of Vice President
 Nixon's tour. However, in some of the countries to be visited, situations exist
 or may develop which may give rise to "anti-Ike" demonstrations. In Argentina,
 Brazil and Uruguay there are labor, leftist, government-opposition and other
 dissident groups not under the direct control of the Communist party who may take
 this opportunity to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with government policies.
 Student groups, a most vocal and unpredictable element in Latin America, may
 demonstrate against the visit. There also exists a danger that demonstrations may
 occur as a result of a sudden turn of events in Cuba, real or contrived. Recently
 Radio Moscow in Spanish to Latin America and NCNA in English radio-teletype
 to Europe and Asia have broadcast false charges of US Marine Intervention in the
 Dominican Republic.

 202.  Communist T1ry on the Breakdown of Capitalgm
 Erik Molnar, an eminent Hungarian Communist historian who has occupied
 the posts of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice in the Hungarian
 Communist Government, has challenged the Marxist law of the inevitable break-
 down of capitalism. Molnar's views are set forth in his latest book entitled Some
 Economic Problems of Contemporary Capitalism. His theory can be summarized
 as follows: (a) The laws which govern the development and decline of capitalism
 can be invalidated by conscious action of the people or of the various classes in a
 capitalist society. (b) Marxss laws concerning class struggle and the growing
 misery of the people are no longer valid. (c) The law of the general crisis of the
 capitalist system, as redefined by Stalin, cannot be considered valid since World
 War II. (d) Defense expenditures In a capitalist society do not have the economic
 importance attributed to them by Communist theoreticians. Defending his thesis
 against the attacks of the orthodox Communist economists, Mr. Molnar stated
 ".... We Marxists must face the facts without allowing old theories to blur our
 vision. I do not agree with tendencies which seek to switch the struggle against
 revisionism from politics to science. Dogmatism is the principal danger in our
 science - economics". Although Mr. Molnar may have exceeded the limits of
 currently acceptable revision of Marrs economic theories, his views are
 consonant with those of Khrushchev, who has written: "If Marx, Engels and Lenin
 could arise now, they would laugh at those bookworms and quoters who instead
 of studying the life of contemporary society and developing theory creatively turn
 to the classics for a quotation about how to act in connection with a machine
 tractor station.... One can even meet such economists who, in speaking of wages
 In contemporary circumstances, use examples given almost a hundred years ago
 by Marx in his famous Capital." (Kommunist No. 12, 1957). The compelling need
 to utilize scientifically sound meth'ods' n economic planning, even when such
 methods are at variance with Marxist ideological tenets, may gradually lead to an
 adjustment of what George Kennan has termed their "Byzantine dogmatism of
 political thought and utterance".

 203.  The Trial Begins...
 In recent months a remarkable work, a novella, or long short story, by a
 young Soviet author has appeared in various West European publications including
 Encounter and Kultura. Entitled The Trial Begins..., it is a profoundly grim satirt
 on the lives of members of the Soviet "elite" in Moscow ("The Great City") prior
 to and on the occasion of the death of Stalin ("The Master"). The authenticity of
 the book as the work of one brought up in modern Russia has been attested to by
 some Soviet experts. Whether it was in fact written in the Soviet Union and
 spirited out for publication is less clear due to the secrecy surrounding the
 channels through which it was acquired. Doubt on this latter question, however, in
 no way detracts from the significance or usefulness of The Trial Begins, for it
 clearly represents one of the most direct, damning, and effective criticisms of
 life in the Soviet Union yet to appear in the West. Granting its authenticity, one of
 the most encouraging features of this manuscript is its style. Completely devoid
 of the crushing stereotype of "socialist realism" and reflecting a kinship with the
 most modern western literary argot, it provides refreshing proof of the stubborn
 survival of the tradition of Europeanization in Russian culture despite four decades
 of ruthless Communist suppression. But most significant in The Trial Begins are
 its mood and themes. Abram Tertz's portrait of present and, more importantly,
 future Soviet life is one of "various shades of black", unrelieved, permanent and
 hopeless. The regime and the life it dictates is corrupt, deceitful, and cruel, but
 no one is shocked or even indignant, only profoundly and cynically resigned. The
 "ideals" of communism have long been forgotten by both the regime and the people.
 By mutual understanding the great "Aim" now is solely and precisely what the
 latest regime order dictates. Symbolically, Tertz presents one "resistance group"
 in his book, made up solely of a naively idealistic youth and his recruit, a female
 student, who attempt to erase the contradictions of the communism of his day by
 citing classical Marxist-Leninist theory. For this he is sent to a work camp and
 diligently undertakes his own political re-education. Tertz's pessimism toward
 the Soviet future is perhaps most emphatically portrayed in a scene in a Moscow
 square after the death of Stalin when the people, bewildered and afraid, wait
 longingly for a new leader and, like dogs, reflect: "I don't want freedom, I want a
 master."

 204,  Soviet Propagawda
 The Central Committee of the CPSU, In January 1960, passed a resolution
 on "The tasks of party propaganda in contemporary conditions". In the introduction
 to this propaganda directive the need for a new type of propaganda is related to the
 transition from socialism to communism - the necessity of "fashioning the new
 man with Communists' traits of character" - and to the beginning of the era of
 "coexistence's during which, however, the Ideological struggle must be continued
 relentlessly. The highlights of the directive can be summarized as follows.
 Persuasion of the masses must increasingly be used to replace the former
 coercion. In examining the contemporary scene, the directive notes the great
 economic and technological achievements of the USSR and the fact that "the
 material basis for party propaganda has become much stronger", I. e., that the
 gap between future promises and present achievements has been narrowed. At the
 same time party propaganda is still "focused mainly on the past", on the works
 of Marx and Lenin, without sufficient attention to the resolutions of the 20th and
 21st CPSU Congresses (the latter, in February 1959, served to launch the Seven-
 Year Plan). Propagandists have so far been unable to "overcome dogmatism and
 uncritical adherence to the letter". In oral and printed propaganda they have a
 "'mania for quoting" (tsitatnichestvo). They often adopt "passive and defensive
 positions regarding idealistic and revisionist ideologiest . Too much propaganda
 is directed at party members, while large segments of the population are
 altogether beyond the influence of propaganda efforts. Frequently the propaganda
 has been so dry and drab that it has not succeeded in attracting the interest of the
 audience. These shortcomings must be overcome by livelier presentation, by
 more emphasis on practical achievements, by greater reliance on "the heroic
 deeds of the present" and concentration on party activities "especially after the
 20th Party Congress".

 205,  Further Indo--akistan Accord
 The government of India and-Pakistan on 11 January announced that they
 had reached agreement on all but one of their remaining border delineation
 disputes. The remaining area is the Rann of Cutch, "a large salt waste by the
 Arabian Sea on the western Indian coast; both sides wanted time to digest
 voluminous data on the matter and agreed to meet "later" on this issue. Areas
 at present in "adverse possession" of either party are to be vacated by the
 adverse possessor by October 15, 1960. The East Pakistan-India boundary
 differences had been settled some months before. The recent step settles all
 important issues between the two governments except those of Kashmir and the
 canal waters of the Indus River basin. The two sides are still discussing the
 exceedingly complex canal waters dispute with progress continuing. The
 International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has worked out a "package'
 which should serve as a catalyst for the settlement of this dispute, sometime s
 regarded as a more basic issue than the emotionally bitter Kashmir question.
 Indeed, much of Kashmir' s importance lies in the fact that it controls the head-
 waters of several of the significant tributaries of the Indus. The total cost of the
 Bank's "package" proposal, which envisages Important irrigation, hydroelectric,
 flood control, and land rehabilitation elements of benefit to both countries, is
 about $1, 000, 000, 000. About $200, 000, 000 will be contributed by India and
 Pakistan. Foreign aid would provide the remainder and is to be contributed by the
 United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and West Germany as well as
 by the United States and the International Bank. The big aid operation will begin
 only when India and Pakistan sign a treaty on Indus. waters rights and related
 matters. Undoubtedly, a factor in driving the two sides closer to agreement has
 been and no doubt still is the Chicom threat from the north. Both sides have
 already reached agreement in principle, but two or three knotty problems remain
 unresolved. Basically those revolve around the division of the waters during the
 construction phase of the huge project and India's uses upstream of the rivers
 earmarked for Pakistan. If, as may now be hoped, agreement is reached on this
 question, it may help toward an eventual resolution of the Kashmir issue.

 206,  De Gaulle and    Army                              Nwv
 The Fifth Republic has undergone its first major crisis. Faced with an
 uprising in Algeria, de Gaulle threw the full force of his influence and prestige
 against the insurgents. The critical group during the revolt and for France's
 immediate future is the army. Among the officer corps of the army there is a
 group whose loyalty to the regime is in doubt. The army, since World War I, has
 suffered increasing alienation from both the French people and the political leader-
 ship. The Fourth Republic's political sterility and successive military defeats
 contributed to the development of a state of mind within the army which has blinded
 them to political reality. Since Indo-China, the French army has. studied intensive-
 ly the doctrines of revolutionary warfare developed by Mao Tse-tung and used so
 effectively in Asia. The army concluded that to fight a revolutionary war the
 defender must also have in his arsenal the spectrum of tactics used by the
 revolutionaries. In particular, subversion, clandestine action groups, propaganda,
 front organizations, and terror must be employed. This theory was applied to the
 Algerian war with the consequence that the purpose of the war became a central
 point of concern to the officer corps. This deliberately cultivated concern was an
 important factor in the inability of the government to moderate the political aims
 of the war, which remained, for the army, the total extinction of the ALN and its
 political body - the FLN. The army's programs in Algeria were largely self-
 generated and independent of the metropole government's policies. When the
 political aims of the army were, de jure, revised by de Gaulle on the 16th of
 September, the inevitable counter-reactions brought into question the validity of
 de Gaulle's position on Algeria, and hence his leadership of the nation. On 29
 January de Gaulle reaffirmed the principles of his 16 September speech and
 ordered the army to break the insurgents' threat to the state. The force of de
 Gaulle's personality and the nation-wide support he engendered swung the army
 onto his side and, stripped of army support, the colon's uprising collapsed. De
 Gaulle has immediately moved to purge from positions of power those individuals
 who were associated with the uprising. There remains the constant threat of
 another uprising. Indubitably the army will again remain the key factor in the even:
 of renewed disturbances.

 guest of the French nation. His primary objectives in such a visit are to continue
 his courtship of de Gaulle which has so far manifested itself in the USSR I s
 moderate support for de Gaulle on the Algerian question, in the recent activities
 of the French Communist Party which has been quite pro-de Gaulle, in the
 roderate posture that the USSR has taken towards the French A-bomb, and in the
 ready acceptance of de Gaulle as a great leader of a world power. He will
 undoubtedly seek to exploit the "peaceful coexilbtenee" campaign in furthering the
 eventual development of a united front in France. He will probably hope to sound
 out de Gaulle on the forthcoming Summit conference and if possible to moderate
 his position on Berlin. The continuing objective of Soviet policy towards France is
 to utilize French nationalism, manifesting itself in de Gaulle's desire to create a
 "third force", to break up both the NATO alliance and the European Economic

 208.  Self-Determination for Tibet
 In the near future, the United States Government will make public its
 support of the principle of self-determination for Tibet, through publication of an
 exchange of letters between the Dalai Lama and Secretary of State Herter. The
 Dalai Lama's letter will express his gratitude to the US for its active support
 during the UNGA debate on Tibet, which helped them in their ''effort to determine
 for themselves their own political destiny." The Secretary of State will reply to
 the effect that it has been the historical position of the United States to consider
 Tibet as an autonomous country under the suzerainty of China, and that the
 American people have also traditionally stood for the principle of self-determina-
 tion - a principle which should apply to the people of Tibet, who should have the
 determining voice in their own political destiny. This position is consistent with
 that of the United Nations as stated in its charter, which is to "develop friendly
 relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and
 self-determination of peoples." At the Bandung Conference of 1955 the Chicoms
 signed the communique which supported the "principles of self-determination of
 peoples and nations as set forth in the charter of the United Nations. to They avoid
 applying this principle to Tibet, however, by maintaining that Tibet is part of
 China and that the Tibetan problem is an internal affair of China. In contrast to
 this position, the Dalai Lama, who is the recognized spiritual leader and temporal
 ruler of Tibet, has said that before 1950 Tibet was a sovereign state.

 A major theeaww of the peaceful coexistence ca   aign of Khrushchev is
 the identification of expanded trade with the US as a method of lessening East-
 West tensions. The campaign developing the trade issue began in June, 1958,
 with a letter from Khrushchev to President Eisenhower pointing to the desirability
 of increased trade and suggesting various commodities which might be traded.
 The subject has been vigorously prosecuted as a major theme through the US
 visits of Mikoyan, Kozlov, and Khrushchev. Khrushchev agreed to resume
 negotiations on the outstanding lend-lease claims after US Insistence that settle-
 ment was legally necessary to allow private credit grants.* Recently the Soviet
 campaign has abated. If trade should not develop we may anticipate the USSR will
 attempt to pin a charge of intransigence on the US. We have pointed out that a
 certain measure of trade could begin any time that the USSR so desired since US
 businessmen are free to trade in non-strategic goods. Legislative restraints,
 however, prevent the extension of private long-term credits. Such credits are
 barred by the Johnson Act (1934) which prohibits the extension of private credits
 of more than 180 days' duration to any country in default on an obligation to the
 US Government. The US considers the USSR in default both on debts of the Russian
 government before the October revolution and on the World War II Lend-Lease
 agreements. The availability of long-term credit is the real key to a major
 expansion of trade with the Soviet Union, since she is presently unable to sell
 sufficient goods in the US to support expanded trade. Further blocks result from
 US export controls, although only about 10% of the goods available for international
 trade are banned from export because of strategic considerations. The import
 of Soviet goods by the US is currently restricted by several laws and executive
 regulations. Most significant of these are the denial of most favored nation
 treatment, which raises US tariffs considerably, and a ban on several types of
 furs. Aside from all this, the refusal of the USSR to abide by internation copy-
 right and patent agreements has created doubt as to the motivation behind the
 trade offensive.

 196.  The Revolt of the  ind
 w February 1960
 Early in January, Frederic A. Praeger, Inc. , 64 Univ. Place,
 New York 3.,  N. Y. announced publication of a new book, jointly authored by
 Tawas Aczel and Tibor Meray, dealing with the Hungarian revolt of 1956, entitled
 The Revolt of the Mind, which represents a significant and unique contribution
 to the literature on that historic event. Aczel and Meray, both members in good
 standing of the intellectual elite of the Communist regime which has dominated
 Hungary since June 1947, have chronicled the atmosphere of the revolution and
 its causal circumstances through a series of concise, documentary personal
 histories or thumbnail portraits of the most prominent personalities of the period
 in the fields of culture and politics. In this fashion The Revolt of the Mind relates
 the history of physical and intellectual suppression, progressive denial of
 individual freedom, cumulative economic blundering, ignorance of the aspirations
 of the people, and slavish response to  Moscow directives which ignited the
 abortive October revolt. More important, The Revolt of the Mind provides a rare
 glimpse into the beliefs and motivations of the key figures of the Hungarian regime
 and, like Czeslaw Miloz' The Captive Mind or the early writing of Arthur Koestler
 offers a valuable revelation of the spiritual and intellectual gymnastics demanded
 and practiced by any functionary of a Communist government if he is to survive.
 The value of this document is supplemented by the fact that the authors were not
 minor, dissatisfied careerists in the Hungarian Communist machine, but
 successful, ideologically-committed members of its elite. Thus, the biographies
 they present exude an unquestionable authenticity and reveal the authors'
 disillusionment with and eventual rejection of communism. The compilation is an
 impressive variation on the familiar but by no means trite theme, "The God that
 Failed". The Revolt of the Mind will probably not achieve a large audience
 because of the considerable material relating to the Hungarian revolt which has
 preceded it. Nevertheless, it is the most effective portrayal of the worst aspects
 of communism (both in theory and practice) recently available and an indispensabl,
 adjunct to the research of any student of communism in general or as applied to
 one of its darkest hours - the Hungarian Revolution.

 197.  The Khrushchev N   t to Asia
 Soviet Premier Khrushchev, concerned by the deterioration in the
 strength and acceptability of communism in Asia (resulting primarily from the
 belligerent activities of Communist China during the past year), will leave soon on
 a tour of selected Asian countries. His current itinerary calls for visits to India
 (1217 Feb.) and Indonesia (for ten days beginning 18 Feb. ), as well as unscheduled
 stops in Burma and Afghanistan. This itinerary leaves no doubt as to the
 motivation for his trip. The visit to Indonesia, which capitalizes on a long-standing
 invitation from President Sukarno, was the first to be announced, on 1 January.
 Indonesia is the most recent Asian country to run afoul of Chicom muscle-.flexing,
 and has experienced an intemperate propaganda and action campaign directed from
 Peking against the Indonesian government's decision to break the hold of aliens,
 mostly Chinese, on the retail trade of the countryside. The situation has resulted
 in a severe strain in Sino-Indonesian relations. Khrushchev next proceeded to
 arrange "invitations" from the Indian and Burmese governments, both of which
 have been involved in bitter frontier disputes with Communist China. We anticipate
 that the Soviets will attempt to cast Khrushchev in the role of "great peacemaker",
 while attempting to take credit for any real or postulated concessions which the
 Chicoms have already made or may make in the future in their disputes with
 India, Burma and Indonesia. The popular belief in a split between the USSR and
 Communist China should augment considerably the ability of Khrushchev to build
 credibility for his pose as "friend" of fre. A2

 198.  Elections in Ceylon
 I February 1960
 On March 19, 1960, a national election is due to be held in Ceylon
 following the resignation of Prime Minister Wijayananda Dahanayake's cabinet in
 early December 1959. Dahanayake has held the office for only a few months,
 having succeeded the late Mr. S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike after the latter's
 assassination in September 1959. He is heading the current caretaker cabinet until
 the elections. Dudley Senanayake, leader of the rightist, somewhat pro-West
 United National Party (U. N. P. ), is hopeful of receiving a majority in parliament.
 In order to avoid losing votes to splinter groups and independents politically close
 to the position of the U. N. P., he says he will not form a government if his party
 does not gain more than a plurality. This party, under the leadership of the late
 D. S. Senanayake, father of the current leader, and of Sir John Kotelawala, who
 is now retiring from politics, had governed Ceylon since independence in 1947 but
 was overwhelmingly defeated in 1956 by Bandaranaike, leader of the left of center
 coalition Mahana Eksath Peramuna (M. E. P. ). It is ironic, in view of the political
 support given him by large numbers of the island's 20, 000 Buddhist monks, that
 it was one such monk who assassinated Bandaranaike. The elections present an
 exceedingly complex picture. Altogether there are 23 parties contesting for the
 151 seats. The principal left-wing groups, such as the M.E.P., which designation
 was recently adopted by Philip Gunawardena, leader of the Viplavakart Lanka
 Sama Samaja Party (V. L. S. S. P, ), have considered joining forces but they have
 not done so as yet. Also on the left are the Trotskyite Lanka Sama Party (L. S. S. P
 led by Dr. N. M. Perera, and the Ceylon Communist Party. The people of Ceylon
 are made up of different races and religions: there are two major races, the
 Sinhalese, who have lived in Ceylon for a very long time, and the Tamils, many of
 whom are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants from southern India. Ther
 are also several minorities such as Moors, Malays, Eurasians, and Europeans.
 The religious structure of the electorate is also complex: Buddhist, Hindu,
 Christian, and Muslim. There is some question about how much Buddhism is going
 to influence the voting at this election. (Before the 1956 elections it was greatly
 underestimated.) However, it might be considered to have lessened for the
 moment because of the shock that struck the nation when the bullet shot by a

 199.  The Role of State Security in the USSR
 On 13 January 1960, TASS announced "the Presidium of the Supreme
 Soviet, on the recommendation of the USSR Council of Ministers, has abolished
 the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and shifted its responsibilities
 to the Ministries of Internal Affairs of the Union Republics. " The functions of
 the MVD had not included state security duties since the 1954 administrative
 reorganizations.  The civil police duties have now been transferred to the
 republic ministries.  Thus, the abolition of the central MVD organization Is
 the final step in a process, initiated even before Stalin's death, in which the
 important security functions of the MVD were gradually transferred to the state
 security organs (MGB).  The process was briefly interrupted and the two services
 (MGB and MVD) merged in 1953 at the time of Beria's ill fated attempt to seize
 power.  At present the KGB is responsible for the following major fields of
 intelligence activity: foreign intelligence, internal and external counterintelligenc
 armed forces counterintelligence, and border security.  In theory, the Soviet
 intelligence services are regarded as the "unsheathed sword of the dictatorship
 of the proletariat".  The purpose is to protect the party from all enemies,
 domestic and foreign.  The Soviet intelligence services have many times been
 reorganized.  There have been numerous changes in nomenclature, such as
 Cheka, OGPU, NKVD, but the role of the organization responsible for "state
 security", the repressive mechanism for perpetuating the regime, has remained
 the one constant factor.  Soviet propaganda has represented the demise of the
 MVD as additional evidence of the "withering away of the state", and further
 liberalization of the regime and a major step in the construction of a Communist
 society.  In his January 14, 1960 speech to the Supreme Soviet, Khrushchev said
 that the MVD was abolished "not only to reduce the size and expense of the
 apparatus, but mainly in the interests of the further development of Socialist
 democracy, the enhancement of the role of the community in the struggle against
 violations of the law, in the interest of granting powers to local authorities. "
 Actually, the MVD was abolished because it had become an economic and
 political liability.  Under Stalin, it was regarded by the Soviet people as the
 hated symbol of oppression and terror.  Beria, who combined under his authority
 the police and state security functions, became a rival to the power of the Party.
 Unquestionably, since the death of Stalin there has been an effort to submit the
 powers of the security police to responsible judicial control.  We see this in the
 changes of the penal code, particularly those sections dealing with civil crimes
 and prison camps; the new emphasis on rehabilitation as opposed to punishment;
 and the evidence that the traditional methods of the state security organ have
 become subject to increasing scrutiny.  However, it is still too early to
 determine the significance of these modifications or their effect upon the central
 security organ as opposed to the civil police.  It is safe to predict that the state
 security forces will continue to play an important role during the period of the
 "construction of a Communist society. " Their activities will be justified as
 the "need for constant vigilance against foreign enemies working inside Soviet
 society"; the resurgence of "local nationalism" (a natural consequence of

 ZOO.  Yugoslav Role inure Detente
 In recent months, as an imminent Summit meeting holds at least seeming
 prospects that the tensions and conflicts between the Western and Soviet blocs
 may ease, speculation has grown over the future role of Yugoslavia in international
 affairs. In a mid-December speech to the Zagreb Town Committee Marshal Tito
 attempted to put to rest the potentially damaging effect of this speculation on
 Yugoslav internal and external policies and objectives. Noting his support for
 Moscow's initiatives in the fields of disarmament and the relaxation of tensions,
 Tito nevertheless reasserted Yugoslav independence from the Soviet bloc: "What
 is all the fuss about? We are an independent country. We have our own interests.
 We cannot all blow the same trumpet. " He added that it was "wrong" to reproach
 Yugoslavia for not joining a "camp". "Blocs are not a happy solution when it come:
 to insuring coexistence and peace", he stated. "Some say that Yugoslavia has
 finished playing its role since tension is relaxing. However, Yugoslavia never had
 any understudy.... Yugoslavia has not changed its foreign policy". Quite recently
 the US Government has demonstrated the continuity of its policy, which recognizes
 the significance of the Yugoslav role in international affairs, with the announceme.
 on 17 December of an additional Development Loan Fund grant to Yugoslavia of
 15, 000, 000 dollars to assist in the construction of a hydroelectric plant on the
 Trebisnjica River near Dubrovnik. It is anticipated that Yugoslavia will continue
 to pursue her aim of leadership of, or major influence in, an informal grouping
 of underdeveloped nations pursuing genuine non-bloc status: militarily, politically,
 and economically.
