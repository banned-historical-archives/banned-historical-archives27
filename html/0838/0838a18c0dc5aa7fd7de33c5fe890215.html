 Discussions under way in South Vietnam between Con-
 stituent Assembly leaders and members of the ruling
 Directorate are aimed at avoiding a confrontation
 over controversial constitutional issues.   Communist
 military forces displayed increased aggressiveness
 this week,  although they continued to avoid major
 contact with such large allied search-and-destroy
 operations as CEDAR FALLS northwest of Saigon.   North
 Vietnam, meanwhile, has replaced the MIG-21s lost in
 recent combat.   Hanoi's leaders are preparing the
 North Vietnamese people for increased difficulties in
 the coming year.

 FAR EAST
 Despite propaganda claims from Peking that Mao Tse-
 tung's opponents are on the verge of collapse, there are
 growing indications that the struggle is becoming more
 intense and that Mao's drive to destroy the opposition
 has run into serious difficulty.   Authoritative journals
 under Maoist control now acknowledge that the struggle
 against entrenched enemies is  "acute,  complicated, and
 tortuous."   Assertions that the army is  "infinitely loyal"
 to Mao are contradicted by an admission in the leading
 army journal that an acute struggle is being waged
 against "bourgeois reactionaries" within the army.   Deep
 divisions among military leaders were also reflected in
 Red Guard attacks on prestigious commanders and in charges
 that key military and party leaders plotted a coup against
 Mao and Lin Piao last February.
 Regional opposition to Mao apparently is growing and
 clashes between pro-Mao "rebels" and local party forces
 continue to be reported from Tibet to Shanghai.   Peking
 has responded to this growing resistance by ordering the
 "rebels" to intensify their efforts to seize enemy strong-
 holds.   The prospect is for even greater violence and
 chaos.
 There is no evidence thus far that the upheaval in
 China has affected rail shipments to North Vietnam.   Com-
 munist forces in South Vietnam continue to avoid large-
 scale engagements with the major allied force sweeping
 the Iron Triangle north of Saigon.   The Constituent As-
 sembly in Saigon has opened debate on the draft constitu-
 tion as assembly and Directorate representatives seek to
 resolve points of contention.
 The Chinese Communists have renewed pressure on Ma-
 cao authorities because of Lisbon's equivocation in ne-
 gotiations over a Portuguese statement accepting respon-
 sibility for the December riots.   Macao authorities have
 taken the precaution of evacuating some Portuguese depend-

 VIETNAM
 Members of South Vietnam's      j on 10 January assembly leaders
 ruling Directorate and Constituent
 Assembly leaders are currently
 seeking to resolve differences
 over the draft constitution.
 An assembly debate on the
 initial draft constitution sched-
 uled to begin on 16 January was
 postponed for two days to allow
 further informal talks.   The Di-
 rectorate's major objections to
 the current draft involve the
 relatively large degree of power
 vested in the legislature,  the
 popular election of province
 chiefs, and the authorization for
 the Constituent Assembly to act
 as an interim legislature pending
 formation of a permanent govern-
 ment.
 Constituent Assembly leaders were
 amenable to most of the Directo-
 rate's suggested changes.   There
 were also some indications of a
 possible compromise which would
 allow the assembly a supervisory
 role in the initial electoral
 process, but not a complete leg-
 islative function.   Meetings be-
 tween assembly and Directorate
 members are scheduled to continue
 while the assembly debates the
 draft constitution.
 The trend toward closer
 relations between assembly and
 government leaders began to emerge
 last week.   At a press conference
 Page  3
 argued that there were no dif-
 ferences between them and the
 military government.   It appears
 that the earlier efforts by both
 Chief of State Thieu and Premier
 Ky to cultivate various groups
 of delegates were fruitful and
 probably figured significantly
 in the assembly's conciliatory
 attitude.
 Such efforts by the mili-
 tary leaders have probably been
 prompted by their apparent desire
 to avoid a confrontation with
 the assembly.   This attitude may
 also reflect the potential presi-
 dential ambitions of both Ky and
 Thieu, and their belief they may
 need some civilian support.
 No insoluable constitutional
 issue seems to remain, providing
 that the Directorate concedes
 some sort of transitional role
 to the assembly after the consti-
 tution is accepted.   Even if all
 the differences cannot be ironed
 out and the government finally
 deems it necessary to veto con-
 stitutional provisions after they
 have been approved by the assem-
 bly,  the limited cooperation
 demonstrated between the two
 groups should help to lessen
 civilian reaction to a veto.

 aggressiveness against South
 Vietnamese and allied defensive
 positions in the  northern coastal
 provinces and in  `he Mekong Delta.
 The majority of t.aese actions
 were conducted by enemy units of
 company size or smaller, and of-
 ten at a high casialty cost to
 the attacking force.   Viet Cong/
 D;orth Vietnamese  \rmy (NVA)  main
 force units generally continued
 io avoid major co.itact with wide-
 ranging allied search-and-destroy
 operations.
 In one of th,  enemy's most
 successful actions of the week,
 cn 15 January a Communist force
 estimated at company strength
 launched a mortar and ground pene--
 t:ration assault against a South
 Vietnamese Army  (ARVN)  district
 headquarters near Quang Tri city,
 the capital of South Vietnam's
 rorthernmost province.   Government
 defenders sustained 127 casualties
 and lost 88 weapo7s,  in contrast
 to known enemy losses of 47
 killed.
 On the same day,  elements of
 the ARVN 21st Division were heav-
 ily engaged by the Viet Cong
 during the conduc: of search-and-
 destroy Operation DAN CHI 275 in
 Chuo:ng Thien Province,,  south of
 Saigon.   Twenty-two government
 troops were killed and 44 wounded,
 compared with enemy losses of 96
 killed.   The Viet Cong massacred
 41 of 48 South Vi,=_tnamese military
 and civilian personnel incarcer-
 ated in a POW cam!  before it was
 cver:run by the 21st Division sweep
 force.
 Two days later Viet Cong
 forces overran a town 140 miles
 southwest of Saigon,  in the same
 creneral area as DAN CHI 275,  in-
 flicting 80 casualties on the
 garrison's paramilitary defenders.
 The Viet Cong sustained
 sharp reverses, however,  in a
 series of abortive attacks against
 US Marine positions  in Quang Nam
 Province and against ARVN infan-
 try and ranger elements in the
 c'elta provinces of Vinh Binh and
 Kien Hoa.   On 13 and 14 January,
 US Marines killed 120 members of
 a. company-sized or larger enemy
 force which was massing for at-
 tacks near Da Nang.   In the delta,
 three ARVN battalions reacting
 to a. 15 January Viet Cong attack
 on an ARVN outpost in Vinh Binh
 Province inflicted losses of 63
 killed on the attacking force.
 7n adjacent Kien Hoa Province,
 the Viet Cong lost 57 killed dur-
 ing a 17 January attack against
 an ARVN ranger battalion.
 Operation CEDAR FALLS
 Allied forces continue to
 press the largest offensive of
 the Vietnam war--Operation CEDAR
 FALLS--against a major Communist
 base area north of Saigon in Binh
 Duong Province.   The operation
 is aimed at the systematic de-
 struction of a 60-square-mile
 Viet Cong jungle preserve known
 as the Iron Triangle, through
 a combination of ground and air
 action, and evacuation of the
 population.

 Battalion-sized or larger
 enemy main force units known to
 be operating in the area have
 offered little resistance to the
 20 US Army and five ARVN battal-
 ions thus far committed, although
 small-unit enemy contacts have
 been numerous.
 As of 19 January,  the 12-
 day allied drive had resulted in
 Viet Cong losses of 524 killed
 and 85 captured.   Some 460 weap-
 ons, more than 45,000 rounds of
 ammunition and nearly 3,000 tons
 of rice, had been captured or
 destroyed.    A large number of
 enemy documents were also re-
 covered.
 US casualties to date stand
 at 53 killed and 282 wounded.
 North Vietnamese internal
 propaganda continues to emphasize
 the possibility of increased
 difficulties for the regime and
 its people during 1967.   A recent
 article in the party theoretical
 journal admitted that US air
 strikes had created "certain dif-
 ficulties" in both production
 and transportation.   A series of
 year-end statements by top lead-
 ers hit hard on the theme that
 the North Vietnamese people will
 be called upon for greater sacri-
 fices to support the war in 1967.
 This campaign appears to be
 precautionary rather than re-
 medial.   There is no indication
 that it reflects any sudden or
 drastic deterioration of morale
 or economic conditions in the
 DRV.

 lieutenants.                            behind-the-scenes plotters and

 poster signed by Red            uards from (Shanghai radio stations initiated
 four high schools appeared on 18

 criticizing Madaiie Mao and purge
 official Chen Po?-ta as "opportun--

 Conflict between pro-Mao
 forces and the local authorities
 apparently continues in Shanghai,
 which has been in the throes of
 a political struggle for weeks.
 Pro-Mao forces had appeared to
 gain the upper hand in early Jan--
 nary but on 15 January Shanghai
 radio announced  :he abolition of
 a "rebel liaison station," set up
 with much fanfare three days
 earlier, because it had been dis-
 covered to be "c Ompletely" con-
 trolled by local party forces
 opposed to Mao.   This body, which
 supposedly represented 32  "rebel"
 organizations, was said to have .
 been supplanted  3y a new group--
 a "rebel liaison department" serv-
 ing only 15 organizations.
 a "blackout" on reporting of
 local news, and carried only pro-
 grams originated by Peking.
 This phenomenon has now
 been noted in about half of
 China's regional broadcast sta-
 tions and is taken to be a sign
 of local resistance.
 Local news has not been
 broadcast in Nanking, apparently
 a stronghold of anti-Mao forces,
 since about 7 January.   The
 blackout spread to other cities
 after Peking made a strong ap-
 peal--rebroadcast repeatedly by
 nearly all regional stations
 on 12 and 13 January--to rally
 behind Mao against his enemies.
 The rail line between Nan-
 king and the capital, which was
 cut late last month,  apparently
 .remains out.   A Peking broadcast
 on 15 January admitted that a
 serious breakdown had occurred
 at  Pang-fou,  between Nanking and
 Peking, because railroad workers
 had walked off the job.

 The situation is also unclear
 in Canton.   On 16 January the
 local radio station broadcast an
 "'urgent notice" attributed to 28
 "rebel" organizaticns making
 routine professions of loyalty
 to Mac, and denouncing unnamed
 bourgeois reactionaries in the
 local party apparatus.   The mes-
 sage lacked the vitriolic tone of
 .imilar pronouncements issued
 by groups in cities where gen-
 uinely pro-Mao "rebels" appear to
 have taken over propaganda media
 and may have been issued by
 local leaders seeking to give
 themselves a Maoist coloration.
 The Canton notice denied
 '"curious rumors" that leading
 figures of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion Group in Peking were com-
 incg to Canton.
 e city was plastered wit
 posters stating that Madame Mao
 was coming to preside over a
 rally to denounce Teo Chu.
 These rumors may reflect plans
 to attack Tao in his own politi-
 cal. stronghold where he ruled
 for many years as party boss of
 the Central South Region.
 It is possible that Tao,
 who ranked fourth ii the new
 hierarchy until aroind the turn
 of the year when he was denounced
 by Madame Mao and other leaders,
 has fled to Canton and is organiz-
 ing a redoubt.   A Red Guard
 leaflet in Canton on 14 January
 complained that the "rebel"
 forces who had attempted to take
 over the South China Daily on 10
 January were actualLy controlled
 by Tao Chu.
 Tao has not appeared in public
 since 29 December, and, according
 to one unconfirmed poster report,
 he flew south to Nanking on 1 Jan-
 uary following a showdown several
 days earlier with Lin Piao, who
 wanted to arrest regional chiefs
 from the Northeast, Northwest,
 and Southwest Regional Bureaus
 who had come to Peking in mid-De-
 cember for parleys under a safe-
 conduct issued by Tao.
 New trouble is reported else-
 where in China.   An "open letter"
 from a "rebel" organization in the
 army, broadcast by the Sian radio
 in western China on 18 January,
 claims success in the battle
 against local party enemies
 but admits that resistance is
 still stubborn and calls for
 stronger efforts to strike them
 down.   Curiously, the chief vil-
 lain mentioned by name is not a
 party official but the "political
 commissar of a certain unit."F-
 These developments took
 place against a backdrop of new
 attacks on military leaders which
 strengthen the supposition that
 the armed forces are divided and
 perhaps in part disaffected. Two
 members just named to the Cul-
 tural Revolution Group for the

 armed forces--reorganized on 11
 January--were denounced in appar-
 ently authentic posters put up in
 Peking on 17 and 18 January.
 They are Hu Chih and Tang
 Ping-chu,  editors of the Libera-
 tion Army Journal, who have oc-
 cupied top propaganda posts in
 the regime since last summer.
 New charges brought against
 Ho Lung--the most senior military
 leader to be attacked thus far--
 assert that he was a leader in a
 group of important political and
 military figures alleged to have
 plotted a coup in February 1966.
 The posters claim that "many" mil-
 itary leaders from the army general
 staff, air force,  navy,  and the
 Peking and Cheng-tu Military Dis-
 tricts were involved. Other former
 leaders implicated by the charges
 are Peng Chen, Lo Jui-ching, Lu
 Ting-i, and Yang Shang-kun, one-
 time aide to Mao now revealed to
 be Ho Lung's nephew.   A news-
 paper distributed in Peking on 19
 January accused Yang of being an
 "important spy" for the USSR.
 Even Mao's old long-march
 comrade Chu Teh has not escaped.
 Numerous posters since 15 January
 charge that he opposed Mao in the
 early 1930s,  supported the traitor
 Kao Kang in 1953, backed Peng Te-

 huai in 1959, and was a member of
 the February 1966 coup group.
 Through all this Lin Pia

 Lin has not made a s

 not depict him as playing a sig-
 nificant role in the latest de-

 forces, and attention to his po-

 two months.
 Chou En-lai, by contrast,
 has been playing a prominent role
 and continues to take a somewhat
 different tack than Madame Mao
 and Chen Po-ta.   He has recently
 defended three proteg6s who have
 been under attack and, according
 to a poster seen on 11 January,
 Chou has defended several mem-

 PEKING RENEWING PRESSURE ON MACAO
 The Chinese Communists have
 renewed pressure on Macao.   Their
 aim is to end Lisbon's foot-
 dragging in curreni: negotiations
 over the wording o::= the Portuguese
 statement accepting responsibility
 for the December rots.   Lisbon
 is attempting to substitute less
 offensive language than the Chi-
 nese demand.
 In an attempt to intimidate
 the Portuguese, Communist news-
 papers  in Hong Konq and Macao
 this week carried ::-eports that
 the mainland autho::-ities had de-
 cided to cut by haLf the water
 supply to Macao, w'iich is com-
 pletely dependent on China for its
 water. Other press reports quoted
 the Macao Trade UnLon Federation
 as declaring that  Lf the governor
 continued to procrastinate, Macao
 Chinese should refuse to sell
 gcods to the Portuguese officials,
 cut off electricity and water to
 their offices and quarters, deny
 them transportation, and demand
 that the governor leave.
 On 17 January, the Macao
 authorities began evacuating
 some Portuguese dependents to
 Hong Kong,  although the situa-
 tion in Macao has remained quiet.
 There is no indication that
 the Chinese are prepared sub-
 stantially to reduce their de-
 mands on the Portuguese for a
 full and abject apology.   Un-
 confirmed press reports from Hong
 Kong that the Chinese have ac-
 cepted a revised Portuguese text
 may indicate that a compromise
 solution is in prospect.   How-
 ever, any further Portuguese ef-
 fort to procrastinate in imple-
 menting the settlement will re-
 sult in renewed Chinese pressure.

 CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT SHOWING INDEPENDENCE OF SIHANOUK
 The government of Prime
 Minister Lon Nol  Ls taking an
 increasingly actiie role in the
 c;ay-to-nay conduc: of Cambodian
 affairs.
 Such a .tion by a Cam-
 Lodian prime mini3ter is vir-
 tually                         without precedent during
 the past several 'Tears.
 yihanouk, whop has hereto-
 fore made  decisions  on even triv-
 ial foreign police matters,  is
 said to have been particularly
 disturbed in late December when
 the Lon Nol government issued a
 communique on an alleged US at-
 tack against the Cambodian vil-
 lage of Bathu without first con-
 sulting him.   He also character-
 ized the tone of the communiqu?
 as too mild and e;:cessively "dip-
 lomatic. "
 The government's desire to
 assume greater responsibility
 in part reflects the personali-
 ties and broad experience of Lon
 Nol and the cabinet.  It may also
 be symptomatic of a general re-
 luctance on the part of the
 Phnom Penh elite to be bound by
 Sihanouk's leftist policies,
 with which they have long been
 unsympathetic, or to accept unques-
 tioningly some of the excesses
 of Sihanouk's autocratic rule.
 Except for some discredited
 leftist elements,  there is gen-
 eral agreement in Phnom Penh
 that Cambodia's neutrality has
 leaned too far to the left in
 recent years and that a new
 balance should be struck.
 Sihanouk is now in France
 on an oft-postponed rest cure.
 His abrupt departure on 6 Jan-
 uary has prompted rumors in Phnom
 Penh that he may have left under
 duress, but these appear to be
 without foundation.   Before his
 departure, Sihanouk indicated
 that the Lon Nol government would
 be held responsible for solving
 long-standing domestic problems.
 In the past,  such statements by
 Sihanouk usually indicated that
 he was considering a change in
 personnel.   A shuffle in cabinet
 posts might occur following Si-
 hanouk's return, although Si-
 hanouk has also stated that the
 Lon Nol government would con-
 tinue at least through 1967.

 EUROPE
 The USSR's top-ranking leaders now have briefed
 party stalwarts in more than 60 cities in what has be-
 come the most far-flung and intensive explication of
 policy ever undertaken in that country.   Party organi-
 zations in major military units are also receiving the
 briefings which   appear to emphasize developments in
 China and the deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations.
 The meetings are probably intended to impress on party
 members the seriousness with which the leadership views
 events in China and to prepare the party rank-and-file
 for any developments which may stem from the upheaval in
 China.
 The first meeting between Kiesinger and De Gaulle
 took some of the recent chill out of Franco-German re-
 lations but left major political problems unresolved.
 For the Germans, the most significant result of the
 talks was French agreement to assist them in their ef-
 forts to normalize relations with East Europe.   The
 French,  in turn, welcome the renewed emphasis on bi-
 lateral ties in hopes of eventually enlisting German
 support for De Gaulle's concept of East-West detente.

 The modus operandi between
 France and the other fourteen
 members of the Atlantic Alliance
 which emerged from the December
 NATO ministerial meeting may be

 French now have expressed a
 priority interest in participat-

 France has withdrawn--the French
 say they "hope" satisfactory
 liaison arrangements will be
 worked out between French and
 NATO commanders.   The other Al-
 lies suspect that Paris is pri-
 marily motivated by a desire to
 retain access to US technology.
 They also fear that if the
 French retain a large role in
 CNAD activities, the US may re-
 duce its input of technical in-
 formation.
 In   clarifying their posi-
 tion on "nuclear consultation,"
 the French say they are talking
 about "crisis consultation" lead-
 ing to a final decision on
 whether to use nuclear weapons.
 The other NATO countries have
 Page  19
 already agreed to consider ar-
 rangements for "crisis consulta-
 tion" separately from the recently
 instituted arrangements for deal-
 ing with nuclear strategy and de-
 ployment.   The French, therefore,
 view their participation in that
 consultative process as not in-
 consistent with their refusal to
 participate in NATO nuclear plan-
 ning.   They allegedly foresee,
 moreover, a possible need for
 consultation in the North At-
 lantic Council--NATO's political
 arm in which Paris retains its
 membership--during the late
 stages of a crisis requiring a
 decision on the use of nuclear
 weapons.
 However, participation by
 the French in crisis consulta-
 tion and related nuclear affairs
 could place them in a position
 to interfere with the work of the
 new Nuclear Defense Affairs Com-
 mittee and Nuclear Planning Group
 and to reinject themselves into
 Alliance discussion of strategic
 military issues.
 The fourteen have other
 problems.   Their five-year  (1968-
 1972)  force planning exercise,
 for example,  is moving against
 a tight schedule and needs pre-
 liminary guidance papers before
 the opening of the spring minis-
 terial meeting.   However, the

 issues involved depend on deci-

 Also the proposed reorgani-

 shat the present plan,  if imple-

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Tension in the Middle East continues to mount.   This
 is the season for plowing and sowing in the contentious
 area of the demilitarized zones--a time of hazard even
 when terrorist activities are at a lull.   Now, however
 the recent terrorist operations against Israel have,
 in the words of Prime Minister Eshkol, brought Tel Aviv
 perilously close to retaliatory action aaainsi-  Gw?-in
 The thorny question of Cyprus rocks along.  The dia-
 logue between Greece and Turkey over the fate of the is-
 land has ceased with the installation of the new Greek
 Government.   Both countries, however,  say they would like
 to reinstitute the talks if a way can be found to do so.
 There is some doubt in Athens, however, whether Greece's
 admittedly interim government should take any initiative
 on this problem.
 Rumbles of coup plotting--punctuated by the recent
 "second stage" coup in Togo--dominated the week's activi-
 ties in Africa.   The upheaval in Togo, where the first of
 many military coups in tropical Africa occurred in 1963,
 brought to the fore leftist intellectuals who are less
 pro-French and inclined toward Marxist solutions for
 their country's problems.   Such elements are likely to
 be heard from increasingly in the former French African
 colonies.
 In the Congo, the dispute between Mobutu and Union
 Miniere has been somewhat eased by a new proposal by the
 mining company to act as sales agent and by Mobutu's con-
 ciliatory public response.   One of the most difficult
 problems may be whether the vital European labor force
 will remain under Congolese management to keep the cop-
 per moving.

 ISRAELI-SYRIAN HOSTILITIES REACH CRITICAL STAGE
 Israel and Syria, with UN
 prodding, have agreed to discuss
 the issue that has been a major
 cause of the recent clashes
 along their border--farming ac-
 tivities in the demilitarized
 zones.   However,  even before
 their concurrence on this point
 was achieved,   tension between
 the two countries had reached
 an especially critical stage
 following a terrorist mine ex-
 plosion on 14 January which
 caused the first Israeli fatal-
 ity in the current series of in-
 cidents.   These operations by
 Palestinian infiltrators--who
 now appear to be entering Israel
 from Lebanon--are more likely
 than the border clashes to lead
 Israel to retaliate against Syria.
 Foreign Minister Eban has
 publicly blamed Syria for the
 mine incident which killed the
 Israeli  (a civilian in the town
 of Dishon near the Lebanese
 border)  and for other recent
 sabotage incidents in the same
 area.   "Fatah," the principal
 Palestinian terrorist organiza-
 tion, had claimed responsibility
 for these incidents in a communi-
 que published in the government-
 controlled newspaper in Damascus.
 Eban said that the success of
 any Israeli-Syrian meeting on
 activity within the demilitarized
 zone would depend on cessation
 of "shots and explosions."
 Israel and Syria agreed to
 discuss the situation in the de-
 militarized zones in response
 to a 15 January appeal from U
 Thant.   A date for the meeting,
 which will be arranged by local
 UN officials, has not been set.
 Israel has specified that it
 will discuss only the issue of
 farming in these disputed areas
 and will not tolerate any Syrian
 attempt to bring up the broader
 question of their political
 status which has paralyzed the
 UN's armistice commission for
 several years.
 Prime Minister Eshkol told
 Israel's parliament on 17 Jan-
 uary that Israel had refrained
 from immediate retaliation
 against Syria because his gov-
 ernment wanted to exhaust politi-
 cal and diplomatic efforts to
 "restrain" Syria.   He added
 that Israel would reply "to con-
 tinued Syrian aggression accord-
 ing to circumstances and neces-
 sity."
 Israel strengthened its
 forces near the border last week
 and,   in the opinion of the US
 defense attache in Tel Aviv,
 now has sufficient equipment in
 position to launch either a
 limited ground attack or a joint
 Syria
 also has moved "much new armor"
 into forward areas.

 NEW GRI=EK GOVERNMENT GAINS PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL
 The "interim" Paraskevopoulos
 cabinet--the latest step toward
 patching up the Greek political
 fabric--easily won a parliamen-
 tary vote of confidence last
 week with the support of the Na-
 tional Radical Union  (ERE)  and
 ex-premier George Papandreou's
 Center Union  (EK)  party.   The
 crypto-Communist United Demo-
 cratic Left,                       the small Progres?-
 sive Party, and the "apostate"
 Liberal Democratic Center party
 of former premier Stephanopoulos
 voted against the new government.
 Following the vote parlia-
 ment adjourned until 31 January,
 when it is scheduled to begin
 debate on a new electoral bill
 to administer general elections,
 now slated to be held in late
 May.   The electoral bill is ex-
 pected to be the only parliamen-
 tary business for the new govern-
 ment.   Apparently all parties
 have agreed to support a simple
 proportional system, although
 FIRE leader Kanellopoulos has
 been opposed to such a system
 in the past.
 Andreas Papandreou,  the
 EK's leading maverick, submit-
 ted to his father's demand to
 toe the party line and voted
 for Paraskevopoulos.   However,
 in a stormy pre-vote parliamen-
 tary session marked by sharp ex-
 changes between the opposing
 factions, Andreas returned to
 his hard line and bitterly at-
 tacked the palace,  the new
 "palace government," and his
 fellow politicos. This prob-
 ably sets the tone for the
 coming election campaign.
 In spite of the vote of
 confidence, many observers fear
 that the government may not have
 an unruffled trip to the ballot
 box.   The press is devoting
 considerable coverage to the
 pros and cons of convening a
 crown council to deal with
 Cyprus, Greek foreign policy's
 thorniest problem.   Argument
 centers on whether an interim
 government like the present one
 can or should make any signifi-
 cant moves.
 TENSION EASES IN CONGO'S DISPUTE WITH UNION MINIERE
 The confrontation between
 the Congolese Government and
 Union Miniere appears to have
 lost. much of its crisis aspect
 in the wake of a new company
 proposal and conciliatory ges-
 tures from Kinshasa.
 Late last week Union Miniere
 offered the Congolese a contract
 under which the company would
 supervise copper production and
 act as sales agent.   Among other
 -things, the company demanded a
 five-percent management fee,

 insisted on broad autonomy in
 its operations, and stipulated
 that the contract must run for
 five years.   Moreover,  the com-
 pany reserved its position on
 several key issues, notably the
 question of payment for the ex-
 tensive unsold stocks of Con-
 golese copper outside the Congo.
 It is doubtful whether Union
 Miniere would even be willing
 to submit this  "pipeline" issue
 to arbitration.
 Although it was politically
 impossible for President Mobutu
 to accept such proposals out-
 right,  the company's offer did
 give him a chance to make a move
 which, although aggressive in
 appearance, was conciliatory in
 substance.   On 15 January his gov-
 ernment issued ordinances imple-
 menting the 1 January   seizure
 of Union Miniere's Congolese op-
 erations and of the company's
 various Congolese subsidiaries--
 an action with considerable propa-
 ganda resonance but little prac-
 tical effect.   At the same time
 it announced that the vast Con-
 golese assets of Societe Gen-
 erale,  Union Miniere's largest
 stockholder, would not be seized
 as Mobutu had threatened.   The
 Congolese also praised the Bel-
 gian Government's mediation ef-
 forts and announced that they
 had presented counterproposals
 to Union Miniere.
 With these moves the dialogue
 has been reopened.   The negotia-
 tions promise to be long and dif-
 ficult, but the two sides seem
 likely eventually to work out some
 arrangement for Union Miniere to
 mine and market the Congo's cop-
 per under contract.   Such an ar-
 rangement would give Mobutu the
 political benefits of having as-
 serted Congolese dominance over
 Belgian "high finance" and would
 give the company a fair return
 at relatively little risk.
 If some agreement is not
 reached soon, there may be trouble
 in the Katanga mining region.   Un-
 ion Miniere operating officials in
 Lubumbashi  (formerly Elisabeth-
 ville)  say that some company in-
 stallations will have to cease op-
 erations within two weeks because
 spare parts are not available.
 They also assert that European
 workers, who are essential to cop-
 per production, have shown no in-
 terest in working for Union Mi-
 niere's Congolese successor, and
 that some of them are leaving be-
 fore their contracts expire.
 These officials may be exag-
 gerating the gravity of the situ-
 ation in order to bring further
 pressure on Mobutu.   Even a rela-
 tively minor cutback in the com-
 pany's activities in Katanga, how-
 ever, would exacerbate the already
 tense situation in the region.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Forthcoming elections in Nicaragua and El Salvador
 shared the spotlight this past week along with the after-
 math of those in the Bahamas.
 Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza has his political ma-
 chine in high gear to assure that his family and cronies
 will still control the country by electing him president
 on 5 February.   Anti-Somoza elements may be able to stir
 up enough trouble to cause some violence, but government
 forces are capable of using whatever rough tactics are
 necessary to stay on top.
 The leading contender in El Salvador's presidential
 election on 5 March is Colonel Fidel Sanchez, favored by
 the incumbent President who is also a military man.
 As a result of the 10 January election in the Baha-
 mas, Premier Lynden Pindling has formed the first all-
 Negro government in the island chain.   Elsewhere in the
 Caribbean,  the British are going ahead with plans to de-
 crease their involvement by letting Antigua, Dominica,  St.
 Kitts - Nevis and Anguilla, Grenada, and St. Lucia form
 a group of "Associated States" next month with control
 of their own internal affairs.   Conflicts following
 elections last August in St. Vincent may cause postpone-
 ment of the same status for that island.
 Legislative elections are slated in Haiti on 22
 January and President-for-Life Duvalier has already se-
 lected the winners,  including a lot of new faces.
 Brazil's President-elect Costa e Silva is in the
 United States on the last leg of a world tour preceding
 his inauguration on 15 March.

 NEW GOVERNMENT IN BAHAMAS
 The first Ne;ro leader of
 the Bahamas, L. O. Pindling, has
 rushed to give public assurance
 of his government's dedication
 to free enterprise,  fostering
 of foreign investment,  and con-
 tinuance of the rDle of the Ba-
 hamas in the defense pattern of
 t:he Western world.
 After his inauguration,
 Premier Pindling told US Consul
 General Shelton in Nassau that
 he was most anxious for the US
 Government to know that it had
 nothing to fear relative to his
 {:tovernment.   He has also at-
 tempted,  following reports of a
 considerable flight of capital
 from. the Bahamas during the past
 several days, to calm the fears
 of investors and tourists by
 stating that tourism, upon which
 the Bahamian economy depends,
 should be increased,  and that the
 tlaha.mas' doors will be open to
 legitimate English and American
 Industry.   Pindling himself has
 assumed the major cabinet post
 of Tourism and Development.
 The new all-Negro cabinet
 has been characterized by Shelton
 as young,  inexperienced,  aggres-
 sive, and probably left of
 center.   Although its members
 are not considered likely to pur-
 sue extreme left-wing policies
 _tor ideological reasons,  there
 may be follies and errors from
 inexperience and vindictiveness.
 The British governor believes
 the main questior will be whether
 '3indling can control his less
 conservative associates.
 One of the new premier's
 principal stated aims is to
 make it possible "for more Ba-
 hamians--black as well as white--
 to obtain a more equal share of
 the country's wealth than in the
 past."   Over 80 percent of the
 some 150,000 Bahamians are
 Negro.   Roughly half live on
 New Providence Island where the
 capital is located.  Although
 Nassau has a growing colored
 middle class of doctors, law-
 yers, and small businessmen,
 most of the colored population
 live "over the hill" in virtual
 slum conditions.
 During the election cam-
 paign PLP leaders had accused
 members of the white-led United
 Bahamian Party of involvement
 with American gangsters and of
 graft and corruption.   On this
 point,  the British governor
 notes that the PLP itself al-
 most certainly incurred obliga-
 tions in the election campaign
 that may have to be paid off by
 concessions to foreign interests,
 and that the police and he will
 have to be increasingly watch-
 ful lest "alleged gangster in-
 fluence in gambling turn to
 reality."
 The British have two ships,
 one destroyer and one frigate,
 which patrol the Caribbean and
 could be called on in the event
 of internal difficulties.

 SLUGGISF ECONOMY REMAINS A MAJOR DOMINICAN PROBLEM
 Stimulation of the Dominican
 economy remains a major problem
 for the Balaguer regime.   The US
 Embassy expects that this year
 the economy will ::_mprove over
 1966 but not enough to regain
 the :Level it had  :-eached before
 the April 1965 rerrolt.  Since
 then, taking into account a pop-
 ulation increase of about 3.5 per--
 cent a year,  there has been a
 significant drop :_n per capita
 income.
 The depressed economic sit-
 uation is particu:_arly trouble-
 some in Santo Dom:.ngo, where op-
 position strength is greatest.
 The capital has borne the brunt
 of. Balaguer's ausi:erity program,
 and the US-financed emergency in-
 vestment program has mainly bene-
 fited rural areas where President
 Balaguer's suppor-: lies.   Unem-
 ployment and unde::employment, es-
 timated at 30 perr:ent of the cap-
 ital's labor fcrce, provide a
 ready reservoir o:: discontent
 for the apparentl,7 mounting oppo-
 sition to Balague:-.
 Balaguer's ei:onomic policies
 thus far have bee:a generally re-
 sponsible and sound.   The deficit--
 ridden sugar industry is operating
 more efficiently and development
 efforts are being concentrated on
 agriculture..
 economy, has increased only mod-
 erately, however, and the massive
 repatriation of private captial
 he expected has not materialized.
 Balaguer recognized this situa-
 tion in his 1967 budget message
 and made clear that the govern-
 ment must expand its own invest-
 ment activities.
 The President's operating
 style, moreover,  appears to be
 adversely affecting his economic
 programs.  He has shown a predi-
 lection for off-the-cuff invest-
 ments from a special presidential
 fund that has resulted in financ-
 ing projects of questionable pri-
 ority.   He is distrustful of tech-
 nicians in the government, many
 of whom are sympathetic to the
 left, and has removed some of
 them at the cost of slowing im-
 plementation of development plans.
 His insistence on centralized con-
 trol,  as demonstrated in his own
 overinvolvement in the expenditure
 process, has curtailed corruption
 somewhat, but has stifled initia-
 tive on the working level.
 It is apparent that sizable
 sums of foreign financial assist-
 a.nce--as much as $75 million--will
 continue to be needed if the econ-
 omy is not to founder.   The Domin-
 icans also are counting on retain-   25X1
 :Private investment, which
 Balaguer in:itiall'j hoped would
 provide a major bDost for the
 ing the substantially augmented
 share of the US sugar quota they
 had this past year.

 NICARAGUAN ELECTION CAMPAIGN HEATS UP
 With general elections to
 be held on 5 February, the atmos-
 phere in Nicaragua is one of un-
 easy calm that could erupt into
 violence.
 Charges of fraud in the voter
 registration have already been
 made, and there is good reason
 to believe that the rolls have
 been padded with somewhere between
 10,000 and 100,000 names.
 The leading presidential
 candidate is General Anastasio
 Somoza Debayle, backed by the
 well-organized and well-financed
 Nationalist Liberal Party  (PLN),
 the tool of the Somoza family
 that has governed the country for
 more than 30 years.   His major
 opponent,  Traditionalist Conserv-
 ative   Fernando Aguero Rocha,  is
 supported by a loose coalition
 of most of the opposition parties
 whose platform is essentially
 negative--"no more Somoza."
 The PLN seems capable of
 winning a free election, but there
 are indications that Somoza will
 not be content with a close win.
 In addition to padding the voter
 rolls,  his brother,  former presi-
 dent Luis Somoza, has been en-
 couraging voters not to vote se-
 cretly, asserting that those in
 favor of Somoza should be proud
 to make their choice public--
 an obvious attempt at electoral
 coercion.
 The more dangerous periods
 will probably be the last two
 Sundays in January when major

 REACTION TO ARGENTINE RAILROAD REFORM LIMITED
 Argentine labor has been sur-
 prisingly quiet regarding the
 government's implementation of
 new work rules for the nation's
 railroad workers.   The 24-hour
 railway strike last week received
 little support among other groups.
 Only the sugar workers in Tucuman
 Province, who struck at the same
 time to protest the closing of
 seven unproductive sugar mills,
 created disturbances that re-
 quired police action.
 Labor may be adopting a
 "wait-and-see" attitude toward
 the Ongania regime because of the
 recent cabinet reorganization
 that installed tough-minded An-
 tonio Lanusse as minister of de-
 fense and put an army general in
 charge of railroads.   Government
 officials have apparently made
 it clear to labor leaders that
 they intend to proceed with the
 revamping of the railroads,
 whose inefficient operations and

 redundant personni?l caused a $400
 million operating deficit in 1966?
 Although some labor leaders have
 called for a tougher stand against
 the government,  including the use
 of sabotage and terrorism,  the union
 officials who con-:rol the railroad
 workers and the major unions in the
 General Confedera-:ion of Labor seem
 to be continuing -:heir- policy of
 avoiding a major confrontation. How-
 ever, they have been unable to pre-
 vent outbreaks of violence in Tucu-
 man, where sugar workers have been
 struggling against government au-
 thority for almost two years.
 Success in instituting rail-
 road reform would be the govern-
 ment's greatest accomplishment
 since coming to power last year and
 might convince its many detractors
 that it will take steps necessary
 to improve the nation's economy.
 CHILL-AN SENATE REJECTS PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO THE US
 The Chilean Senate's rejection
 of President Frei s request for per-
 mission to visit the US in February
 is certain to have widespread reper-
 cussions on Chilean foreign policy
 as well as on domestic politics.
 The vote aga__nst Frei appears
 to be primarily one more demonstra-
 tion of the Senate's general hosti.l-
 ity to the President and its eager-
 ness to embarrass him.   It was car-
 ried by the swing vote exercised by
 the centrist Radical Party, which
 frequently votes with Frei's leftist
 opposition.   The Communists and So-
 cialists mouthed the usual anti-US
 diatribes in their speeches.
 Unless Frei': parliamentary
 maneuvering persuE.des the Senate to
 reverse itself, which at least some
 Chilean officials doubt, the effect
 of the vote will lie to limit his
 freedom to visit z.ny other country.
 This might prevent. his attendance
 at the inter-American summit meeting
 scheduled to be hE,ld in April, and.
 it would certainly hamper his ef-
 forts on behalf of Latin American
 integration.   If Frei leaves the
 country without Congressional ap-
 proval, he will open himself to
 charges of unconstitutional, dicta-
 torial action.
 Frei's Christian Democratic
 Party  (PDC)  is certain to exploit
 this issue during the municipal
 election campaign in the spring.
 It can claim that an irresponsible
 political opposition has put do-
 mestic concerns ahead of Chile's
 international responsibilities.
 The lack of widespread public
 reaction to the Senate's vote will
 limit the pressure that Frei can
 exert on the Senate.   The PDC has
 attempted to organize demonstra-
 tions, and in fact scattered vio-
 lence has been directed at the
 headquarters of the Radical Party
 (PR).   This has only hardened Rad-
 ical opposition to the government.
 Frei is unlikely to make the legis-
 lative concessions that the PR is
 demanding for a reversal of its
 position.
