 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                      4805
 THE CONSEQUENCES
 The important thing for investors to re-
 member is that running into a regulatory
 ceiling need not mean catastrophe.  Any in-
 telligent regulatory commission will prob-
 ably allow a certain premium for good man-
 agement.  Thus it might view more sym-
 pathetically a company that has out its rates
 over the years than one that has raised them.
 And it would likely look with more kind-
 ness on a company with the lowest rates in
 the State than on the one with the highest.
 Further, if a company is ordered to hold
 down or even reduce its 'total return on in-
 vestment, this may not be reflected in the
 trend of earnings per share.  The industry
 is generating some 62 percent of its capital
 needs internally versus only 32 percent 5
 years ago.  Thus net per share can continue
 growing on the basis of reinvested earnings.
 For it is no longer necessary for utilities to
 finance their expansion by issuing the new
 common that so regularly diluted earnings
 in years past.
 THE COMMUNICATORS
 By  contrast  with  the  electric  utilities,
 rate cutting by the big communications com-
 panies-American  Telephone  &                                         Telegraph
 Co., General Telephone & Electronics Corp.,
 and Western Union Telegraph Co.-has never
 been particularly popular. But there were
 regulatory problems of a different sort.  The
 FCC last year rejected A.T. & T.'s proposed
 rate structure for its wide area data service,
 but A.T. & T. had not given up hope that
 the Commission would accept its wide area
 telephone rate proposals.  Main fly in the
 ointment: opposition from A.T. & T.'s prime
 competitor, Western Union.
 A.T. & T. competition had already forced
 Western Union to cut rates on its private
 wire   service-reductions  that   Western
 Union's slender margins could ill withstand,
 especially when Western Union desperately
 sought more revenues.   To get them, last
 year it posted another increase on its public
 message  (i.e., regular telegram) business,
 which will doubtless decline even faster as
 a result.   But Western Union needed the
 added revenues to complete its $100 million
 transcontinental microwave network, which
 will  help  it  compete  more  directly with
 AT. & T. in several telecommunications areas.
 Though sti 1 paying out most of its earn-
 ings in dividynds, Western Union was penny-
 pinching in some areas by cutting executive
 salaries 10 percent and eliminating most of
 its advertising.  The effort seemed to be pay-
 ing off at the 9-month mark, when WU re-
 ported earnings nearly doubled on a 7-per-
 cent rise in revenues.  But some of the gain
 stemmed from tax credits, while WU still
 had some heavy payments to make to its
 pension fund.  And even with the comple-
 tion of its microwave system, it was uncer-
 tain whether WU could generate the reve-
 nues to offset its higher costs, and whether
 it has the financial muscle to stand up to
 one of the world's largest and richest com-
 panies.
 BETTER MIX
 If  Western                 Union  was  no  match  for
 A.T. & T., General Telephone & Electronics
 was doing fine.             In the last 5 years, GenTel's
 telephone revenues and profits have grown
 much faster than A.T. & T.'s, but its total
 profits have not.  Reason: GenTel's net from
 manufacturing peaked out at $37 million in
 1959 when Sylvania was bought, then de-
 clined so fast (to $24 million in 2 years)
 that  rising  telephone  earnings could not
 plug the gap.
 Since  then  GenTel's  Chairman  Donald
 Power has tidied up the Sylvania operation
 by selling the camera division, strengthen-
 ing the dealer network and upgrading the
 semiconductor operation.  Hence manufac-
 turing profits last year were back to a more
 satisfactory $33 million, and GenTel had the
 biggest and best year in its history.
 So, for that matter, did AT. & T., which
 completed a $47 million addition to its over-
 sea cable network, orbited a second Telstar
 satellite, introduced a new touch tone tele-
 phone, and out its night rates on long-
 distance telephone service.   But the real
 measure of A.T. & T.'s management was that
 no one was surprised at the record results.
 Like the man who did the difficult at once
 and took only a little longer for the im-
 possible, A.T. & T. seems to have turned rec-
 ordbreaking into a routine performance.
 FBI DIRECTOR STAYS ON
 Mr. HRUSKA.  Mr. President, Lyle
 C. Wilson, the able syndicated columnist
 and vice president of United Press Inter-
 national, in a recent column takes note
 of the fact that President Johnson in-
 tends to waive the requirement that Fed-
 eral Bureau of Investigation employees
 must retire at age 70 in order that the
 FBI's distinguished Director, Mr. J. Ed-
 gar Hoover, be allowed to serve past
 January 1, 1965.
 President Johnson thus reflects the
 great trust and confidence the American
 public has in Mr. Hoover.
 I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Presi-
 dent, that Mr. Wilson's column, entitled,
 "FBI Director Stays On," be printed in
 the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the column
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Washington  (D.C.)  Daily News,
 Mar. 9, 1964]
 FBI DIRECTOR STAYS ON
 (By Lyle C. Wilson)
 President Johnson has told White House
 callers he hopes J. Edgar Hoover will con-
 tinue as Director of the Federal Bureau of
 Investigation.    Mr. Johnson has said that he
 wants Mr. Hoover to direct the FBI at least
 as long as he remains in the White House.
 That pleases Mr. Hoover who enjoys vigor-
 ous good health.  He has no desire to retire
 so long as he can be of service to his country.
 Sometime before January 1, 1965, therefore,
 the President will sign an Executive order
 waiving with respect to Mr. Hoover the re-
 quirement that FBI employees retire at age
 70.  Next New Year's Day will be the Direc-
 tor's 70th birthday.
 Mr. Hoover's age and the Federal retire-
 ment law had combined to arouse some spec-
 ulation  that  the  Director's  distinguished
 career would end with this year.  There was
 a bit of wishful thinking in the speculation,
 no doubt, because left wingers of American
 politics declared open season on Mr. Hoover
 long ago.
 American  Communists  constantly  have
 campaigned to retire Mr. Hoover.  They had
 ample cause for their anti-Hoover crusades.
 Under his direction the FBI became an effec-
 tive and genuinely feared opponent of Com-
 munist subversion.                                                                                   But Mr. Hoover's ene-
 mies  were  not                                                                                limited  to  the  American
 Commies.
 The non-Communist left wing of American
 politics is a much more dangerous enemy of
 Mr. Hoover and of the FBI than are the Com-
 munists.  The commies cannot do much be-
 yond yapping their resentment each time the
 FBI turns over a Red rock to examine the
 insect life beneath.
 The non-Communist lefties, however, often
 have connections in high places, sometime
 including the White House.  They often hold
 high political positions themselves.  From
 such power points in Washington the Hoover
 hunt has been directed for years.  Lefties in
 and out of the Truman administration made
 a big hidden play against Mr. Hoover.
 They hoped to persuade Mr. Truman to
 impose certain rules and regulations on the
 FBI, the idea being that Mr. Hoover would
 resign rather than preside over the destruc-
 tion of the Bureau by Executive order.  HST
 was too smart for his lefty friends who sought
 to enlist him in the anti-Hoover movement.
 Mr. Hoover probably is the best known
 American  civil  servant.  Many persons
 familiar with Government rate him the ablest
 administrator in public office.   No public
 servant rates higher with Congress than does
 Mr. Hoover.
 His direction of the FBI has not been
 openly challenged since the early New Deal
 years when the Democrats were back in power
 clamoring for jobs after many lean years.
 Chairman Kenneth McKellar, Democrat, of
 Tennessee, of the powerful Senate Appropria-
 tions Committee demanded FBI jobs for de-
 serving Tennessee Democrats.  Mr. Hoover
 balked, enraging Senator McKellar.
 The Senator undertook to discipline the
 Director, bawling threats in a series of Senate
 speeches.  Few men, including presidents,
 could cross McKellar and get away with it.
 Mr. Hoover could and did.  The word that
 Mr. Hoover will stay on the job will get no
 cheers from the American lefties.  All other
 Americans are likely to applaud.
 VIETNAM: COMPLEX AND DIICULT
 Mr. BARTLETT.  Mr. President, on
 another subject-a subject in which the
 Senator from Louisiana [Mr. ELLENDER]
 expressed great interest on the floor the
 other day during the course of a discus-
 sion on this subject-I desire to say
 that last Saturday, March 7, it was my
 pleasure to address a conference on Viet-
 nam at Wingspread, Racine, Wis.  This
 meeting was sponsored by the Univer-
 sity of Wisconsin in cooperation with the
 Johnson Foundation. Present were dis-
 tinguished scholars and public servants.
 Dr. Wesley R. Fishel, professor of po-
 litical science at Michigan State Univer-
 sity and one of the country's few recog-
 nized experts on South Vietnam, spoke
 on the U.S. role in that country. Speak-
 ing on strategic problems in southeast
 Asia was Col. Donald S. Bussey, a man
 with a scholastic record as extensive as
 his combat record.  Richard Dudman,
 a St. Louis Post-Dispatch correspondent,
 who last year was denied reentry into
 Vietnam because of the Diem regime's
 displeasure with his reports, gave an ob-
 servation on the present scene. Partic-
 ularly illuminating was a round table
 discussion on alternate policies with
 Congressman HENRY S. REUSS, from Wis-
 consin, Benjamin V. Cohen, attorney and
 diplomat? who served in many positions
 under the Roosevelt and Truman ad-
 ministrations, and Dr. Fishel.
 In my own speech I tried to emphasize
 the complexity of Vietnam.
 There are no easy answers.
 We cannot, we should not accept de-
 feat.
 The military situation must be im
 proved before there can be hope for a
 satisfactory negotiated settlement.
 This does not mean we should close
 our ears to talk of such a settlement. We
 should not scorn the efforts of our allies
 to find solutions other than military in
 Southeast Asia.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                  March YI
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that my speech be made a part of
 the RECORD at this point.
 There being no objection, the address
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD.
 as follows:
 VIETNAM
 (Address of Senator E. L.  "BOB"  BARTLEiT
 at Johnson Foundation Education Confer-
 ence Center, Racine, Wis.)
 I ehould start by explaining why I am
 here.  I am here because recently I gave a
 speech on the Senate floor discussing Amer-
 ica's  role In South Vietnam.   My speech,
 and one given on the same day by Senator
 MANSFIELD. have caused a good deal of heat-
 ed controversy.  This controversy has been
 not a little aided by the fact that most of
 those engaging in It have not had the time
 nor the opportunity to read what actually
 we said.
 The policy that Senator MANSFIELD and
 I advocated on that Wednesday 2 weeks ago
 has been called a policy of passive surren-
 der.   It is  neither passive nor surrender.
 It is more an attempt to combine active hope
 with cool realism.
 I  cannot, of course,  speak  for  Senator
 MANSFIELD. I would, however, like to take
 this opportunity to clarify, if possible, my
 purpose in speaking out.  If I do succeed
 in such clarification, it will be a remarkable
 achievement, for the situation In Vietnam
 Is anything but clear.  Misinformation, con-
 fusion, contradictions, and doubts abound.
 It is, alas, sadly true that the only way to
 he really clear on Vietnam is to speak In
 such general terms as to render the points
 made practically useless In  application to
 what is actually happening in Vietnam.  The
 alternate approach is equally unhappy, for
 if I were to speak In detail, using only that
 detail of which I am absolutely sure and
 qualifying each point on which I am not
 completely certain, my talk would be tedious.
 hesitant, and largely irrelevant.
 Let me start with a principle:  for  the
 foreseeable future we must stay in South
 Vietnam; we cannot pull out.  As a nation
 we are committed to assisting South Viet-
 nam in the preservation of its integrity and
 independence.
 There is little doubt the recent succession
 of coup upon coup has weakened the morale
 of the army and that the military situation
 has   deteriorated.  Secretary   McNamara's
 visit to Vietnam is testimony of this.  The
 number of guerrilla raids-incidents as they
 are  called-has  increased  markedly.   The
 Vietcong has begun  daylight forays.    The
 number of desertions from the South Viet-
 nam Army has Increased; and, as one cor-
 respondent put it, only 3 percent of the
 South Vietnam Army's attacks over the last
 week actually made contact with the Com-
 munists.
 Some  have  suggested  that  to save  the
 situation we must take the war to North
 Vietnam.  I fail to see that our national
 security Is endangered enough by happen-
 ings In South Vietnam to warrant the risk
 of a major war.  For, count on it: selective
 bombings of North Vietnam could be but
 the beginning of a very grave and hazardous
 game, a game which would give us little were
 we to win and which would cost us dearly
 were we to lose.
 Perhaps  there is an alternate policy, a
 policy leading to settlement of the Vietnam
 struggle.  If there Is, our position in seek-
 ing for it will not be improved by bombing
 Hanoi or even Shanghai.
 The war in South Vietnam. although In
 many ways supported by the North Viet-
 namese, and for all practical purposes di-
 rected by the North Vietnamese, remains a
 South Vietnam war.  The guerrilla fighters
 for the Vietcong are recruited from South
 Vietnam.  Most of the equipment used by
 the Vietcong Is American. stolen in raids.
 It is my understanding that what ammu-
 nition is not stolen from us is purchased
 across the border in Cambodia.
 Recently   Defense  Department   officials
 have said that they have captured sophisti-
 cated weapons of Chinese origin from Viet-
 cong strongholds.  However, the State De-
 partment has Informed me that the prin-
 cipal means of bringing equipment from the
 north Into the south is by way of the so-
 called Ho Chi Minh trail which is nothing
 more than a series of jungle paths.  Only
 material which can be carried on the back
 of a man can be carried on this trail. There
 Is a limit, obviously, to what can be carried
 In this way.
 Even if we were to close the Ho Chi Minh
 trail and to blockade North Vietnam, and
 even If this did not cause further retaliation
 In kind from North Vietnam  and  China,
 what would we gain?   The rebels are in
 South Vietnam now; they would still be there
 even then.
 This guerrilla war In this little country is
 surely,  as Secretary Rusk said  this week,
 "mean,   difficult,  and  frustrating."   Guer-
 rilla warfare is as different from conventional
 warfare as is night from day.  Mao Tse-tung
 has said that the strength of his guerrilla
 fighters during the overthrow of China was
 that they were fish who could swim in the
 sea of the people.  When guerrillas are not
 fighting, they fade into the landscape. They
 live on the land and among the people.
 A   guerrilla-type   Insurgent   movement
 which has the support of the people has
 yet to be beaten.   Such a movement which
 has succeeded in terrorizing the people Into
 silence is extremely difficult to beat.
 If guerrilla outbreaks are to be defeated
 by a central government, that government
 must have the confidence of Its people.  It
 must be able to protect them when they as-
 sist in tracking down the outlaws.
 It  Is  precisely  this point  which  makes
 American participation In South Vietnam so
 difficult.   Americans  are not South Viet-
 namese.                                                                               Americans cannot lose themselves
 in the people.     They cannot swim in the
 sea of the people.
 We can arm and train and equip the South
 Vietnamese troops but we cannot fight for
 them.  The people of Vietnam fought the
 French from 1940 through 1954 to achieve
 their Independence.
 We must at all costs avoid being cast In
 the role of an imperialistic. colonist power.
 If. through misadventure or folly, we should
 allow the struggle in Vietnam to become one   that we may. at some time in the future,
 of Asian versus white Intruders, we have lost go to the conference table in crder to achieve
 a good deal more than South Vietnam.          something like a settlement in the Indo-
 The war in South Vietnam Is a South Viet-                                                                          Chinese Peninsula.  We cannot go to the

 ish In Malaya, although the British had an
 easier task because they we:-e the legal gov-
 ernment.  After an area Is cleared, it must
 be held.  This Is hard dirty work but it must
 be done and we must insist the Vietnamese
 Army do it.
 Battles are demoralizing.  Repeated bat-
 tles over the same land lead not only to de-
 moralization but to passiveness among the
 people.  And this Is what Is happening now
 to the Vietnam peasants. Too many no long-
 er care who wins: they just want the fight-
 ing to go somewhere else.
 2.  There   must  be  a really  visible  and
 serious effort to end the corruption and steal-
 ing with which the central government has
 preyed upon the people.  Soldiers should be
 paid; a peasant should have the benefit of
 his crops.  Of course corruption is hard to
 stamp out.  This does not mean, however,
 that a try should not be mrde.  While it Is
 important that corruption be eliminated, it
 is even more Important now, at this stage,
 that the people see that someone is trying to
 eliminate it.
 3. A really serious effort must be made
 to insure the continuing operation of local
 government functions.
 A government, If it is to maintain the
 respect of Its people, must provide schools.
 hospitals, and the safety of the streets.  In
 guerrilla warfare, far more than in conven-
 tional warfare, it is vital tha': the basic gov-
 ernmental functions which touch each and
 every person must be sustai zed as strongly
 and as long as possible.  This has not al-
 ways everywhere been done in South Viet-
 nam.
 4. Lastly, real, and again visible, efforts
 must be made to find employment for the
 more than 40 percent of South Vietnamese
 men who are currently out of work; to es-
 tablish a real land reform program in this
 agricultural  country  where  2  percent  of
 the landowners hold close to one-half of the
 land, and most of them are absentee land-
 lords.
 All of this and the many more reforms
 that are needed as well, constitute a most
 difficult program  to carry out at a  time
 when the country Is wracked by civil war.
 It must be done, for unless the Vietnamese
 people have something worth fighting for,
 they won't continue to fight, and they are
 the only ones who can win this war.
 In talking about winning r,nd victory, we
 must be quite clear about what sort of vic-
 tory we can expect.  I foresee the probability

 THE AUTOMATION PROBLEM
 Mr. BOGGS.  Mr. President. it is en-
 couraging that the President has decided
 to make a study of the impact of auto-
 mation.
 While I am sure the study he proposes
 willbe worthwhile, I would be happier if
 he were following the approach I have
 proposed in my bill, S. 185, which pro-
 vides for a White House conference on
 the impact of automation.
 Besides combing the country for in-
 formation and recommendations on au-
 tomation, the White House conference
 method assures widespread kindling of
 interest in the problem itself.  Since au-
 tomation is a recent and generally mis-
 understood problem, the public needs to
 know more about it, and this is accom-
 plished in the White House conference
 process which builds up from community
 to area to State levels.  The data and
 recommendations finally considered in
 Washington are the end result of thou-
 sands of meetings In every section of the
 country.  In this way the Nation speaks
 to Washington.
 If the White House conference plan
 is well carried out, it is the best way I
 can think of for arriving at a national
 consensus on a problem of vital interest
 to us all.  The problem is serious enough,
 and immediate enough, to require such
 a thorough study and then concerted
 action.
 The  Christian  Science  Monitor  for
 March 11, 1964, carries a penetrating edi-
 torial entitled "The Priority Is People"
 which underlines importance of dealing
 with the automation problem and I ask
 unanimous consent that this editorial be
 printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the edito-
 rial was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 THE PRIORYIY IS PEOPLE
 President Johnson's message on manpower
 defined the problem. suggested what should
 be done, and  announced  "two new major
 administration  actions" that  have  been
 taken.    One of the latter is the establish-
 ment of it Committee on Manpower to study
 the broad Issues.   Such study Is obviously
 necessary.  But no less urgent Is the other
 more specific. and perhaps therefore more
 promising, administration action: a study of
 the Impact of automation.
 The whole message should serve as a warn-
 ing. a spur to wise legislative action. and an
 encouragement  to  public discussion.   But
 when the President says that his programs
 will succeed "only when we become deter-
 mined that nothing is to take priority over
 people," the question of automation comes
 to mind with special force.  Probably civil
 rights is the only Issue that might outrank
 the  automation  employment  equation  as
 "the major domestic challenge, really, of the
 sixties," to use the Kennedy phrase. Even
 in civil rights the particular effect of auto-
 mation on the employment of unskilled non-
 white workers heightens the problem.
 Last year In the United States Secretary
 of Labor Wirtz said that "automation is ab-
 solutely essential to the preservation of the
 productive  advantage  which  this  country
 has always had."  The solution then Is not
 to stop the march of the machine, as attrac-
 tive as this may sometimes seen.,. but to use
 It to the best human advantage.
 Because of the speed of this march, plan-
 ning-by labor,  management.  and                                                                              govern-
 ment-is more essential than In previous ages
 of technological advance.  Automation is not
 lust a better mousetrap: it make., the mouse-
 trap obsolete.
 It also makes some workers obsolete.  Not
 only the factory workers, 'who are estimated
 to be lasing 200,000 jobs a year to automa-
 tion,  but  the  white-collar  workers-even
 junior  executives-who are confronted  by
 computerization of their jobs.
 At one extreme Is the point of view that it
 Is not automation  that causes unemploy-
 ment,  but  the minimum wage law which
 prevents the hiring of workers not consid-
 ered  worth the minimum  wage.   Another
 view Is  that of Henry Ford  II, who said
 earlier this year that any loss of jobs was
 due not to too much technological progress
 "but ton little."
 Things have changed since the first Henry
 Ford brought more pay and more jobs to
 workers through a degree of mechanization.
 There was then  a  huge  untapped market
 ready for the Increased production.
 The new situation requires new thinking
 The International  Labor  Organization  Is
 planning a conference representing 12 coun-
 tries this month.                                                                            There have been others.
 Before the Senate Is a proposal for a legis-
 lative "Hoover-type" commission on                                                                              auto-
 mation.
 Meanwhile the administration study would
 seem to be the least that can be done. Labor
 has called for such study while expressing
 doubts about mere study.
 Certainly the study must lead to action.
 It could decide, for example. that the pres-
 ent  Manpower  Development  and                                                                           Training
 Act, helpful as it Is. should be made less

 question not only of displaced workers but
 the "silent firings" of workers never hired
 for jobs no longer necessary. There Is the
 question of Identifying which industries will
 be hit with automation next. so plans for
 change can be made.
 " We can no longer value a man by the
 jobs he does: We've got to value him as a
 man," says Norbert Wiener from his long
 experience with cybernetics.
 This does not mean a return to 19th cen-
 tury "Taylorism,"  with  Its  intricate plans
 for paying a man not according to the posi-
 tion be held but to the skill and devotion
 with which he filled it.  But as jobs change
 overnight, the individual  ability  to adapt
 will probably be at a premium.
 When  the  statistics     are reeled  off--- the
 comparisons between it dwindling      increase
 in  jobs and  a  growing  increase  in  labor
 force, for example-it becomes terribly clear
 that many people could get lost in the shuffle.
 We hope the problem will be seriously con-
 sidered at the forthcoming United Nations
 Conference   on  world  trade.  We  are  glad
 the U.S. administration i; taking steps row.
 MANNED   AIR            AND     AEROSPACIE
 CRAFT AND NATIONAL SECURITY
 Mr. SIMPSON.            Mr. President, with
 the trained Air Force flying officer rapid-
 ly being replaced by   system of com-
 puters and missiles, I -;pink it behooves
 us to reflect briefly upon the wisdom of
 the metamorphosis and also the efficacy
 of it.  An article by retired Army Col. D.
 P. Yeuell in the National Security Coun-
 cil's Washington Report, issue of Febru-
 ary 24, questions very seriously the de-
 pendability of our Nat_on's missile sys-
 tem and the defense philosophy which
 places total reliance on missiles as a
 strategic panacea.
 The Yeuell article is an excellent corol-
 lary to a Washington Report on the same
 subject authored last May 6 by Dr. James
 D.  Atkinson   associate  professor  at
 Georgetown University.
 The article written by Colonel Yeuell,
 who since 1960 has been in advanced pro-
 gram planning in the aerospace industry
 and a consultant on military technologi-
 cal problems, was the subject of an edi-
 torial February 28 by James Flinchum,
 editor of the Cheyenne, Wyo., State
 Tribune.
 Editor Flinchum notes, "The debate
 over missile reliability has been raging
 for  several  years,"  c ven  while  the
 United States has made great strides in
 weaponry.
 Colonel Yeuell cautions, however:
 The blunt fact is that no operational mis-
 sile or any prototype thereof has ever been
 married to a nuclear warhead for the com-
 plete test firing cycle from launch to tar-
 Re t.
 Editor Flinchum continues by under-
 scoring this statement:
 Because of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,
 we cannot now or in the future completely
 test the ability of our present missile sys-
 tem to fire, deliver, and explode a nuclear
 weapon on target.  We can only guess and
 hope they will do so.  This is one of the
 severely limiting factors of the Nuclear Test
 Ban Treaty.
 The frightening thou;ht is that the
 Soviets have actually tested missiles with
 nuclear warheads from launch to target
 and we have not.
 Mr. President, on March 6 I placed in
 the  RECORD  several lines of testimony
 given by Secretary of Defense McNa-
 mara  during  hearings  of  the  Armed
 Services Committee, February 20, 1963.
 In that testimony, Seere,ary McNamara
 stated:
 I do not believe any of them (our missiles)
 are  proven In the  sense  you (Senator
 STENAn9 r are using the word. For statistical
 reasons based on the law cf probability, we
 must carry out -a specific number of launch-
