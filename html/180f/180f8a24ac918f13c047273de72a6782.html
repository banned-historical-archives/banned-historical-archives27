 FAR EAST
 Indochina
 North Vietnam: Disquiet in Hanoi
 Although the Chinese are making special ef-
 forts to mollify Hanoi in the wake of the an-
 nouncement about President Nixon's proposed
 visit to Peking, the treatment has not taken.
 Neither the special VIP attention given to Le Duc
 Tho on his way home from Paris nor the People's
 Daily article disclaiming any Chinese interest in a
 new Geneva conference appears to have allayed
 fears in Hanoi that North Vietnamese interests
 would be endangered by a Sino-US detente. Shrill
 propaganda lecturing continues in the North Viet-
 namese press and the same points are being made,
 albeit in lower key, in statements by high offi-
 cials. Le Duc Tho took note of the "unchanging
 nature of US imperialism" in a joint communique
 with the Soviets as he passed through Moscow,
 and Defense Minister Giap took some deliberate
 swipes at the Chinese in his remarks at a reception
 in Hanoi celebrating Chinese Army day and in his
 official letter of congratulations to Lin Piao.
 that the larger issue of US-China relations has
 upstaged Hanoi's own seven points, there may be
 more specific differences between Peking and
 Hanoi over the terms for settling the war. China's
 newly found enthusiasm for Hanoi's negotiating
 posture, in addition to being belated, is am-
 biguous. Even Peking's insistence on 3 August
 that it does not favor a new Geneva conference is
 hedged by qualifications-such a conference is not
 appropriate "today," say the Chinese. In almost
 all of its commentary endorsing the seven points,
 Peking has managed to leave the impression that
 troop withdrawal is by far the most important
 Communist demand-indeed, almost the only de-
 mand. Hanoi, however, gives equal weight to its
 demand that the US must also make changes in
 the Saigon government. In their own discussions
 of the seven points, the North Vietnamese have
 acknowledged that it is possible for the. US to
 concern itself with withdrawal only and leave the
 Vietnamese to work out a political solution, but
 the  whole  thrust  of  Communist  negotiating
 strategy is to force the US to make concessions
 on continued support for the Thieu government.
 Hanoi's highly unusual resort to polemics in
 a disagreement with a Communist ally reflects
 extreme concern. Although the memory of the
 1954 Geneva conference is always with them, the
 Vietnamese know that much has changed since
 then and that the Sino-Soviet split gives them
 much more freedom of maneuver than they had
 in the 1950s. Hanoi is well aware that China and
 the Soviet Union are unlikely to act in concert
 and that a reduction in support from one will
 probably result in an increase in support by the
 other. Nevertheless, fear of pressure from Peking
 seems to be at the heart of Hanoi's distress. The
 North Vietnamese probably have already sought
 to hedge their bets with Moscow, or will soon do
 so.
 In addition to North Vietnam's general sus-
 picion of a sellout by China and very real concern
 By emphasizing only US withdrawal,, Peking
 may be reinforcing skepticism in Hanoi that all
 the Chinese really want is to force the US out of
 Indochina, and that in a bilateral deal with Wash-
 ington, Peking would undercut Hanoi's other de-
 mands for political concessions. By itself, this is
 not the kind of sellout that the Vietnamese ex-
 perienced at Geneva, but it may be one' of the
 factors triggering the outbursts from Hanoi these
 past two weeks.
 A new call for stepped-up mobilization was
 issued in North Vietnam on 29 July. The pre-
 mier's office put all civilian agencies on notice to
 upgrade their military reserve units and signifi-
 cantly increase both the theoretical and practical
 aspects of military training. The publicity and

 authority of the notice suggested that the leader-
 ship  was                making an effort to keep popular
 energies focused on the war effort and related
 domestic issues. An accompanying editorial was
 fairly honest in acknowledging that improvements
 in military training were needed to meet "front-
 line" requirements-a euphemism for the battle-
 fields in Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam.
 South Vietnam: Ky Out, Minh Still In
 Vice President Ky's failure to qualify for the
 presidential race by the filing deadline on 4 Au-
 gust, came as no surprise to his own campaign
 staff.
 Ky's appeal to the Supreme Court may spar
 additional adverse publicity for President Thieu,
 especially overseas, but it seems unlikely to get
 him on the ballot with Thieu and Big Minh on 3
 October.
 Ky is bitter at Thieu
 Being frus-
 trated  y   ieu s maneuvers o reeze him out of
 the action is not a new experience for Ky, and in
 the past he has often responded with a spurt of
 activity followed by a longer period of sulking in
 seclusion. It is possible, therefore, that Ky will
 not sustain his present rate of invective for the
 whole campaign.

 Security in the three southern provinces of
 Military Region (MR) 1-Quang Nam, Quang Tin
 and Quang Ngai-continues to deteriorate
 cials in these three heavily populated provinces
 are no longer willing to stay the night in their
 hamlets and villages, and each day they return to
 the more secure district and province capitals.
 Many irregular military units charged with
 protecting rural areas reportedly refuse to patrol
 them at night, and lately have not even patrolled
 during daylight hours. Some security troops have
 been selling their weapons and other equipment
 to help pay for their transportation each day to
 and from more secure areas. Some of this gear
 probably has fallen into enemy hands. Discipline
 among the security troops is poor and morale is
 low, and many recruits join local units in name
 only, statistically inflating the size of these units
 but producing no corresponding increase in secu-
 rity.
 US advisers say that security is worse in
 ese areas than at any time since 1968. Some of
 this decline can be attributed to US troop with-
 drawals and to increased enemy activity since the
 first of the year, but timid performances by many
 South Vietnamese commanders and troops in this
 area seem to be the chief causes of poor local
 security. So far, the government has done little to
 toughen its demoralized civilian and military

 Laos: Slow Going in the South
 Government forces attempting to recapture
 Paksong on the Bolovens Plateau have been en-
 gaged in some hard fighting. A task force that had
 been moving on Paksong from the northwest was
 forced to halt after two of its three battalions
 were dispersed by an enemy attack. Other regular
 units are moving slowly eastward toward the
 town along Route 23. Their progress has been
 slowed by enemy troops dug in along the road,
 but lead elements have moved to about nine, miles
 of Paksong.
 North of the Bolovens, government forces
 still hold Saravane. The irregulars as yet have
 found no major enemy supply caches. Several
 -kirmishes have occurred as government patrols
 have ranged around the town and more serious
 clashes may soon occur.

 Vang Pao's forces have pushed farther to the
 southeast of the Plaine des Jarres. Elements of
 three irregular battalions have taken up positions
 about six miles from Xieng Khouangville and are
 now in position to take the town if so ordered.
 Other irregular units are pushing slowly to the
 north from Phou San, north of the Plaine. The
 Communists have continued to shell and probe
 government positions, but have not gained any
 new ground.

 As Sirik Matak makes preparations for a trip
 to the United States and a meeting with President
 Nixon, the political waters in Phnom Penh have
 once again become turbulent. The cause lies not
 in any one single precipitating factor, but in the
 accumulated weight of the seemingly chronic
 problems-the deteriorating economy, corruption
 in high and low places, rowdyism in the army,
 absence of dramatic or convincing military vic-
 tories, and the growing perception that no early
 end to the war is in prospect. The natural inclina-
 tion to blame the men in power for these assorted
 woes is aggravated because of the evident divi-
 sions and lack of powerful leadership at the top.
 Who is running Cambodia, Sirik Matak or Lon
 Nol? It is a question that is increasingly being
 asked in politically aware circles in Phnom Penh.
 The government has moved quickly to ease
 the agitated political scene. Thanh was appointed
 head of a new government committee charged
 with combating inflation and recommending eco-
 nomic policy guidelines. Prime Minister Lon Nol
 apparently hopes to trade on Thanh's reputation
 for incorruptibility and his high standing with
 much of the National Assembly, the source of
 considerable antigovernment carping recently. At
 the same time, he has saddled a potential rival
 with one of the country's thorniest problems,
 although an improvement in the economic picture
 could rebound to Thanh's advantage.
 In another move, the politically ambitious
 First Deputy Prime Minister In Tam was given
 authority over the military police, apparently in
 an effort to keep him in the cabinet. Tam has
 been insisting that he needed a paramilitary force
 to implement his pacification program and had
 threatened to resign unless he was provided with
 such personnel, a tactic he has employed success-
 fully in the past.
 Discontent over corruption and leadership
 aggrandizement has had a negative effect on mo-
 rale within the National Police.
 The dissatisfaction of these officials may
 also reflect their awareness that the National
 Police have been the stepchild in the Cambodian
 security structure. In many cases National Police
 responsibilities have been either restricted or   25X1
 assumed by the military police, and they have     25X1
 been relegated to a low priority in the allocation
 of  money  and  materiel.

 Communist China: Purge Confirmed
 The purge of ultraleftist politburo member
 Chen Po-ta
 West-
 ern press reports of Chen's rumored purge were
 correct                  Mao Tse-tung had been
 alluding to Chen's failings in his interview with
 American journalist Edgar Snow last December
 when Mao condemned "hypocrites" who lied dur-
 ing the Cultural Revolution.
 Although Chinese media have yet to de-
 nounce Chen officially, there have been ample
 indications in recent months that Peking is seek-
 ing            to  persuade  both  domestic  and  foreign
 audiences that the influence of the leftist forces
 represented by Chen is on the wane. These signs
 include the increasing publicity accorded the
 year-old campaign against reputed followers of
 the extremist "May 16 Corps"-which Chen al-
 legedly  organized-and  repeated  apologies to
 Western diplomats in Peking for excesses per-
 petrated against foreign missions in the summer
 of 1967, the period when the May 16 group was
 riding high.
 It is still uncertain whether Peking intends to
 make Chen a public scapegoat for the May 16
 group's extremism. Because other ultraleftist
 politburo members, including Madame Mao and

 Kang Sheng, also were involved with the group,
 Peking may be reluctant to risk exposure of the
 full extent of leadership disunity through an open
 pillorying of Chen. The case against Chen Po-ta
 and the May 16 Corps appears to have been
 accompanied by a corresponding strengthening of
 Chou En-lai's personal position, and the political
 demise of Chen apparently symbolizes Peking's
 repudiation of extremist policies in foreign as well
 as domestic affairs. Nevertheless, the ranking of
 Madame Mao just behind Chou and ahead of
 Chief of Staff Huang Yung-sheng at the Army
 Day celebrations last weekend suggests that the
 jockeying between leftist and moderate elements
 within the regime has not ceased.
 A Japanese Paradox: Rapid Wage Hikes With Improved Competitiveness Abroad
 Japanese trade unions have been able to ob-
 tain significant increases in wages during the past
 two years, largely because of the country's highly
 favorable economic situation. The raises averaged
 14 percent in 1969 and 18 percent in 1970. This
 year Japanese trade unions during the "spring
 wage offensive" hoped for increases of more than
 20 percent, but the workers received only 16
 percent as a result of the current economic slow-
 down plaguing Japan. Furthermore, increases in
 total income in 1971 are likely to be even less
 than the wage increase suggests. Japanese workers
 receive bonuses that account for roughly one
 third of their cash income. In the last two years
 bonuses  increased  at about the same rate as
 wages, but this year they are unlikely to rise at all
 with the result that the wage gain will raise annual
 income by only 11 to 13 percent. On an hourly
 rate basis this annual income would amount to an
 average of $1.15 compared with $3.60 in the US
 and $2.05 in West Germany.
 Japan has done better than its major inter-
 national competitors, the US and West Germany,
 in   maintaining the relationship between wage
 rates and increases in productivity. Between 1963
 and 1970 prices on Japanese exports rose ten
 percent compared with 21 percent for the US.
 Japan also has a small edge over Western Euro-
 pean countries. West Germany is the only other
 major country that did as well as Japan in avoid-
 ing sharp increases in wages relative to produc-
 tivity. The German revaluation in 1969 and the
 subsequent floating of the mark since May 1971,
 however, raised Germany's export prices substan-
 tially. These factors accentuate Japan's trading
 advantage over the major industrial countries al-
 though Japan is losing its competitive edge on
 some labor-intensive products such as textiles to
 the low-wage, less developed countries.
 The ability of Japanese trade unions to ob-
 tain wage increases in excess of productivity gains
 during the last three years has aggravated the
 problem of domestic inflation. Tokyo, however,
 is now more worried about resuming its rapid
 economic growth of recent years than in fighting
 inflation. Once the economy is booming the gov-
 ernment will probably place greater stress on
 combating inflation and may promote a policy
 that limits pay increases to productivity gains.
 The unions, however, would oppose any such
 plan, whether inspired by government or manage-
 ment. Similarity of statements released by the
 unions on this point indicates a coordinated ap-
 proach to the problem. The unions' long-range
 wage policy is aimed at boosting Japanese wages
 to "high" Western European levels by 1975.
 Although Japan may catch up to European
 workers' wages by the mid-1970s it is highly
 doubtful Japanese wages will match those of the

 and Japanese wages will likely remain the same.
 Japan's competitive edge over Europe will depend
 on its more efficient plants and equipment and
 the excellent marketing organizations that have
 been developed.

 EU ROPE
 Soviet Economy Maintains Momentum
 Moscow's midyear report on the economy
 indicates that the momentum generated in com-
 pleting the eighth five-year plan in 1970 has car-
 ried over into the first half of 1971. Calculations
 based on the report show an increase of about
 seven percent in civilian industrial output over the
 comparable period of 1970. Although the rise is
 below the 7.5 percent posted during the first half
 of 1970, last year's rate contains a large element
 of rebound from the poor performance of 1969.
 Although the midyear growth is in line with
 planned goals for 1971, in three of the past four
 years growth in the second half was significantly
 below that recorded in the first half.
 Growth of civilian machinery production is
 calculated to have declined by about one percent
 from the comparable period last year. In contrast,
 Moscow reported no change in the output of total
 machinery, suggesting that production of mili-
 tary-space hardware increased at a somewhat
 accelerated pace over 1970. Moreover, in the
 civilian machinery sector, output of most con-
 sumer durables continued to stagnate. For the
 fourth consecutive quarter, production of TV sets
 fell below the corresponding period of a year
 earlier. A notable exception was passenger cars,
 whose production increased by 44 percent as the
 long-awaited Fiat-Zhiguli started rolling off the
 assembly line.
 At first glance the consumer nondurable
 sector recorded a moderately disappointing per-
 formance as rates of growth of soft goods and
 industrially processed foods were below those of
 a year ago. Production levels for some items have
 satisfied current consumer demand, causing, in
 part, lower growth rates. The results for items still
 in short supply were mixed. Sewn goods produc-
 tion grew seven percent compared with 11 per-
 cent for the same period last year, but industrially
 processed meat increased by 16 percent, twice the
 rate achieved during the first six months of 1970.
 Gross fixed capital investments by the state
 rose eight percent over the first half of 1970, or
 above the 1971 plan projection of 6.5 percent. A
 ten-percent growth  in construction work was
 primarily responsible for boosting the average
 over-all investment growth rate, so investment in
 equipment (about one third of the total) prob-
 ably grew by considerably less than eight percent.
 Agricultural prospects at midyear appear to
 match last year's record results. Spring sowing
 plans were overfulfilled, and harvesting of winter
 crops is progressing satisfactorily. Cattle, hog, and
 poultry numbers reached record totals on state
 and  collective  farms.  The  recent  policy  of
 encouraging private agriculture also appears to be
 having some positive effect. The number of pigs
 was up by ten percent and private holdings of
 cattle, sheep, and goats remained at the level of a
 year ago, arresting the decline of recent years.
 Consumer  welfare scored  a modest gain
 during the first half of 1971 to continue the
 long-run pattern of gradual improvement. The
 volume of retail sales was up by seven percent,
 approximately the same as for the comparable
 period in 1970. The Soviets reported a twofold
 growth  in automobile sales to the public, al-
 though the totals are still minuscule by US stand-
 ards. Further brightening the consumer picture,

 Crimea Meeting: Where Was Ceausescuu'
 Romania's absence from a conclave of top
 Soviet, East European, and Mongolian leaders in
 the Crimea on 2 August has further underscored
 its isolation within the Soviet bloc. Apparently
 the  meeting with  Brezhnev,  Podgorny.  and
 Shelest was called quite abruptly; several of the
 non-Soviet leaders seem to have arrived on short
 notice. Two days later the participants, minus
 Kadar, who had returned home, visited the Soviet
 Black Sea fleet. The Soviet announcement of the
 excursion pointedly noted the fleet's responsi-
 bility to safeguard the "countries of the socialist
 community" as well as the USSR.
 The communique issued after the meeting
 mentions that a variety of topics were discussed-
 European security proposals, Vietnam, the Middle
 East, the Sudan and CEMA. In its treatment of
 these problems the communique uses the most
 routine formulations, suggesting that a major
 purpose of the conference was to flaunt its "com-
 plete unanimity,"  a phrase employed several
 times. It lends a formal character to the allegedly
 informal  vacation  meeting  and  underscores
 Romania's deviant status.
 Although China and Romania are not men-
 tioned by name in the communique and no
 threats are directed at either, both are implicitly
 criticized and probably received the closest atten-
 tion. By stressing their "deep satisfaction" that
 the recently concluded 25th CEMA session agreed
 on closer economic integration, the participants
 focused critical attention on Romania's obstruc-
 tion of this goal. Similarly, by reiterating their
 approval of the conclusions of the anti-Peking
 1969 World Communist Conference, the par-
 ticipants pointed an accusing finger at China and,
 indirectly, at Romania.
 The two troublesome countries are by now
 closely  associated  in  Soviet  minds.  The  in-
 creasingly close cooperation between China and
 Romania serves important interests of each.
 Romania gains support for its independent poli-
 cies, while the Chinese, by gaining a foothold in
 the Balkans, hope to relieve Soviet pressure on
 themselves. Ceausescu's long process of culti-
 vating the Chinese was climaxed during his recent
 Asian trip when he signed a joint communique in
 Peking whose anti-Soviet overtones particularly
 irked Moscow. The announcement of the presi-
 dential trip to China has undoubtedly deepened
 Moscow's irritation, since the Soviets suspect that
 Romania has facilitated the contacts between Pe-
 king and Washin ton.
 The Crimea meeting thus seems intended as
 a warning to Romania to refrain from further
 ostentatious displays of independence, although
 Moscow apparently has not embarked on an open
 campaign to bring Bucharest into line. If the
 Soviets intend to step up the pressure, the Warsaw
 Pact exercise reportedly scheduled to be held in
 Bulgaria later this month offers an opportunity.
 In the past the Romanians have refused both to
 participate in such exercises and to allow Soviet
 troops to transit their country.
 Meanwhile, the Romanians appear to have
 anticipated increased friction with Moscow., They
 launched a campaign for ideological purity in
 early July that was probably designed both to
 forestall Soviet criticism of their domestic policy
 and to prepare the Romanian party and people
 for the likelihood of increased pressure. Since the
 Crimea meeting, an article in the Romanian: party
 daily on 4 August has reaffirmed the independent
 attitude Ceausescu took in a blunt s eech on the
 eve of the CEMA meetin .

 France: Words and Action on International Narcotics
 Reacting to pressure from US diplomats and
 to a round of recent biting press criticism de-
 manding more action, French officials are now
 taking the problem of drug abuse more seriously
 than at any time in the past.
 Late last month in radio and TV appearances
 Interior Minister Raymond Marcellin announced
 rewards for information on suspected drug push-
 ers reported through special new telephone num-
 bers in Paris and Marseilles. Citing statistics on
 increased arrests and convictions for drug traf-
 fickers                   since  1  January,  Marcellin  took  the
 extremely hard line that the death penalty might
 have to be applied if present penalties do not
 discourage pushers.
 Although applauding the government's pub-
 licly expressed concern over drug abuse, which
 was seen as responsive to earlier press demands
 for action, most papers nonetheless felt that
 Marcellin took too harsh a stand. The unusually
 wide  press coverage-reflecting  a  new public
 awareness of the drug question-was for the most
 part opposed to the means propounded by Mar-
 cellin for solving the problem. Le Figaro called
 the phone system "an invitation to denunciation
 [with] a danger of error and [of creating] an
 atmosphere of suspicion." Le Monde and several
 other papers doubted both the wisdom and effec-
 tiveness of instituting the death penalty,
 Probably more important than Marcellin's
 strong words are recent less publicized actions. In
 an effort to improve over-all narcotics enforce-
 ment in France and to strike more effectively at
 clandestine heroin laboratories in the Marseilles
 area, Marcellin has appointed a number of dy-
 namic police officers to the Central Narcotics
 Office, one of whom will go to the Marseilles
 station of the service. The attention paid to
 Marseilles is especially important because most of
 the heroin seized by US officials is apparently
 processed in Marseilles laboratories after being
 imported  in raw form
 from  Turkey.  US  of-
 ficials estimate that the
 Marseilles  component
 processes 80 percent of
 the heroin bound for the
 US although the French
 deny that the figure is
 this high.
 IJS efforts to con-
 vince France to take the
 drug problem seriously
 begai  in  mid-1969.
 Since  that  time  the
 French have gradually
 . Strong words on drugs
 increased the number of officers assigned to
 cotics enforcement, and have signed an agree-
 ment-negotiated                                                                                     between  Attorney  General
 Mitchell and Marcellin-permitting more US nar-
 cotics personnel to operate in France.
 Much of France's resistance to pressure from
 the US has been a result of the fact that the
 French do not perceive their drug problem as
 being as serious as that in the US. Although the
 use of cannabis has increased sharply since 1965,
 it is still not nearly as widespread as in the United
 States. Though the number is probably very low,
 the French estimate that they have less than
 1,000 hard drug addicts, most of whom are over
 35, while US officials put known American ad-
 dicts at over 300,000.
 France's stepped-up attention to the prob-
 lem has been paralleled to some extent elsewhere
 in Western Europe. In Spain, the government has
 increased fines for possession of drugs. In Italy, a
 major crackdown on the Mafia is under way
 In West
 Germany, a drug abuse program has been in effect
 for about a year.

 Superpower Problems at UN Maritime Meeting
 Midway through the present meeting of the
 UN  General Assembly's seabeds committee at
 Geneva, the United States and the USSR are
 facing serious opposition in their chief area of
 concern, the  right  of  passage through  inter-
 national straits. Both Moscow and Washington
 have made proposals designed to win them greater
 support, but the current of opposition on this and
 some other subjects runs strong.
 Earlier this week the US formally presented
 to the 86-member committee three draft articles
 intended to resolve at the 1973 Law of the Sea
 conference the present disagreement over the
 weak and ambiguous international maritime laws.
 The first would set a 12-mile limit to territorial
 waters but guarantee a right of free passage
 through the approximately 100 straits that are
 less  than  24  miles wide. The second would
 attempt to    balance the interests of advanced
 states that fish in distant seas with those of de-
 veloping countries that rely on the marine re-
 sources off their coasts. The third would set the
 limit of national jurisdiction over the ocean floor
 at a water depth of 200 meters and provide inter-
 national  machinery  to govern exploitation of
 potential mineral wealth on and below the deeper
 seabeds. On only the last proposal has the US
 fared particularly well to date.
 The Soviets have long been troubled by the
 seabeds regime concept-they traditionally op-
 pose  limitations by international organizations
 ICELAND: Icelandic  officials  seem somewhat
 chastened by the foreign reaction to their new
 government's policy proposal for an evacuation of
 the US/NATO base at Keflavik. The Norwegians
 in particular, who as fellow Nordics carry special
 weight, have stressed the importance of the base
 in view of the increasing capabilities of the Soviet
 Northern Fleet.
 over national sovereignty. Last week, however,
 they appeared to have been won over in part to
 the US view that a more forthcoming superpower
 position on ocean floor exploitation would en-
 hance prospects for agreement on the straits issue.
 The USSR offered a draft treaty setting up an
 authority for the seabeds, but did not propose
 that the international community be a beneficiary
 of seabed mineral wealth, a proposition the US
 favors.
 Spain has launched a frontal attack on the
 superpowers'  interest  in free passage through
 straits. Madrid seeks to retain the "innocent pas-
 sage" reference in present international law and
 to designate nuclear vessels as noninnocent and
 therefore subject to regulation by the coastal
 state. Three NATO allies-Italy, Denmark, and
 Greece-are also most unhappy with the US
 straits proposal. Rome is concerned lest interna-
 tional rights through Messina loosen mainland ties
 with Sicily; Athens and Copenhagen oppose any
 agreement that could permit increased Soviet na-
 val activity in their territorial waters.
 The Latin American states that claim a
 200-mile limit for their territorial waters have so
 far not been especially vehement in debate at the
 committee meeting. Some of the 200-milers may
 be willing to accept a 12-mile limit if 4 more
 extensive  coastal  state  "economic  zone"  to
 protect fishing areas can be obtained.r-
 The prime minister has now revived qld sug-
 gestions that the base might be manned by Ice-
 landers. In addition, leaders of two of the three
 coalition parties have indicated that no action can
 be taken with respect to the base until the more
 urgent question of Icelandic fishing limits is set-
 tled; this issue, however, will lead to sharp differ-
 ences with Britain and West German.

 Yugoslavia: New Government and New Reforms
 Tito's governmental reform came one step
 closer to realization last week with the staffing of
 offices in the new federal structure. The new
 government, with a few prominent exceptions,
 should be ready to begin daily operations soon.
 At the same time, preparations have begun on
 further constitutional changes and a reorganiza-
 tion of the party, two moves which are central to
 Tito's plans for orderly development of a decen-
 tralized but cohesive federation.
 On 30 July, the Yugoslav National Assembly
 Krste Crvenkovski
 Vice President of the
 Collective Presidency and
 Number Two Man in the
 Government
 gave  final  approval to
 the   new  government.

 presidency, the supreme

 Tito was of course re-

 republic  but surprised
 the National Assembly by
 refusing re-election "for
 life." He noted that the
 constitution did not
 mention life tenure and
 he said  that  he  only

 As a corollary to the installation of the new

 the creation of a new commission whose task will

 leading  ideologue,  Edvard  Kardelj,  the  com-

 "second round" of the reforms is better organized
 and less chaotic than the first. No timetable was
 announced.
 All the action last week was not confined to
 the government scene. A session of the party
 presidium kicked off a reform drive on 28 July by
 scheduling discussions for a party conference in
 November. Unabashed by the weighty task of
 remolding the party into a more influential force,
 Tito also directed that the nation's unhealthy
 economic situation be added to the agenda of the
 EASTERN EUROPE: Budapest has concluded its
 first agreement to grant equity to a foreign com-
 pany in a cooperative venture located in Hungary.
 This may presage similar arrangements by other
 East European countries. Romania also passed
 legislation last year to permit foreign ownership
 up to 49 percent and is negotiating joint ventures
 with a number of US companies.
 The authority to permit foreign ownership
 in Hungary derives from a decree promulgated in
 August 1970, but investment is allowed in prac-
 tice only where Hungary stands to acquire new
 technology.  The agreement between the Hun-
 garian Infolar Systems Engineering Institute and
 the US firm, Control Data Corporation (CDC),
 grants CDC a 49-percent interest in a data proc-
 essing center. CDC has already applied for a US
 export license for the 3500 computer that it is to
 provide for the data center. The center will solicit
 Hungarian customers for data processing and
 engineering services.
 Although no joint ventures have yet been
 concluded under the new Romanian investment
 law passed in March 1971, a number of US com-
 panies have expressed interest. US Steel Corpora-
 tion reportedly is working on a proposal to build
 a cold rolling mill and sell some of the output in

 Sudan:  New Directions in Foreign Policy
 Sudan's relations with the USSR and Eastern
 Europe, already under a severe strain since the
 Numayri countercoup, deteriorated sharply dur-
 ing the last week. The Sudanese have recalled
 their ambassador in Moscow, who was also ac-
 credited to Sofia, and have asked the counselor in
 the Soviet Embassy in Khartoum and the Bul-
 garian ambassador to leave.
 Numayri had at first absolved the Soviets
 from any role in the coup attempt, but then
 reacted to Soviet press criticism of his purge of
 local Communists. The Sudanese leader charged
 that the only explanation for the harshness of the
 Soviet press attack was that the Soviet Embassy
 was an "accomplice of the coup leaders and the
 Sudanese [Communist I party." The choice of the
 Bulgarians as a particular target for Sudanese ire
 may be a delayed reaction to an earlier story in
 Cairo's al-Ahram that charged Sudan Communist
 Party Secretary General Mahjub with planning the
 coup from the safety of the Bulgarian Embassy.

 For its part, Moscow has continued its at-
 tacks on Sudan in the same vein as before and has
 had additional workers' protests delivered to the

 against Jordan that Qadhafi had urged. The Arab
 leaders did endorse the old Cairo and Amman
 agreements with the fedayeen, and warned that if
 Jordan flouted them other countries would have
 to take "appropriate measures."
 Qadhafi has made a heroic effort to convey
 the impression that the meeting accomplished a
 good deal. At a press conference on 1 August, he
 hinted darkly of "secret decisions" to be imple-
 mented in due course, depending on develop-
 ments in Jordan. He also claimed the meeting had
 given the Palestinians all they wanted, although
 fedayeen radios were quick to blast the outcome
 of the conference. The Syrians, too, attempted to
 mask the hollowness of the communique by hail-
 ing it as a comprehensive, historic document, fit
 to stand beside the Cairo and Amman agreements.

 Tunisian Foreign Minister Masmoudi, mean-

 Amman and the fedayeen. According to press
 reports, his plan calls for unification of the feda-

 likely eventuality. The Tunisian initiative would,
 however, provide the Arabs with a convenient

 dominantly Arab to a predominantly Jewish city,
 and has been consulting with the US on a draft

 Jordan now finds itself unable to count on the

 New Trouble May Lie Ahead for Cyprus
 Rising tensions on Cyprus could develop
 into a new crisis. President Makarios, fearful that
 a projected meeting between Greece and Turkey
 will undercut his position, may be trying to pro-
 voke an intercommunal clash.
 The  talks  between  Greek  and  Turkish
 Cypriot elements on the island, which have served
 as a safety valve over the past four years, have
 become deadlocked on the question of the degree
 of local autonomy to be granted the Turkish
 Cypriot community. In the past few weeks, sev-
 eral shooting incidents have kept the two com-
 munities on  edge.  Makarios  remains  openly
 critical of the Turkish Cypriots and has been
 publicly encouraging Greek Cypriots to protect
 their  "rights." In these circumstances, even a
 slight incident could lead to significant fighting,
 which in turn could spill over to embroil Athens
 and Ankara directly.
 The Turks took a firmer line last March after
 the Erim government came to power and now
 insist that if the intercommunal talks do not show
 progress soon, other alternatives must be sought.
 The Erim government discussed the deadlocked
 talks with Athens last June and will do so again in
 September.  The  Turkish  leaders  believe  the
 Greeks should take a more active role in settling
 the problem, but will probably initiate no mili-
 tary action as long as there is no real danger of
 enosis-union of Cyprus with Greece-or a major
 outbreak of violence on the island. Nevertheless,
 the Turkish military, which put Erim in power
 and now has an influential voice in the govern-
 ment, does not intend to allow the status quo on
 the island to remain indefinitely.
 For their part, the Greeks are fearful of
 Makarios' ability to stir up trouble. Athens be-
 lieves that Turkey does not fully appreciate the
 limits of Greek influence on Makarios, but it is
 hoping that the Athens-Ankara talks will prevent
 any unilateral Turkish military move on Cyprus.
 Athens' major concern is to avoid a confrontation
 with Turkey. At the meeting in September, the
 Greeks probably will seek to convince the Turks
 that the intercommunal talks offer the best route
 to a solution.
 If the Greek-Turkish meetings in September
 do not square with Makarios' ideas, however, he
 remains  capable  of  frustrating  Greek-Turkish
 diplomacy by creating a new crisis on the is-

 Guinea: The Purge Continues in Conakry
 The latest paroxysm  in Guinea's eight-
 month-old political purge has included major new
 arrests, a second round of "popular trials," and
 mounting allegations of US involvement in the
 regime's current troubles. Domestic tensions were
 also heightened by renewed charges that cross-
 border attacks by Portuguese-backed mercenaries
 were planned for this week.
 The cyclical process of arrests and confes-
 sions-leading to more arrests-has become in-
 creasingly frenzied, suggesting deepening insecu-
 rity on the part of Guinea's leaders. The current
 wave of arrests has so far netted over one fourth
 of the cabinet, several ranking military officers,
 and numerous lower level officials. The total
 number in custody is not known, even by Presi-
 dent Toure, but it may exceed the 150 sentenced
 last January by a "revolutionary" court for their
 alleged complicity in the Portuguese-led com-
 mando raid on Conakry in November 1970.
 Those arrested span the entire political spectrum,
 although individuals having foreign educations or
 close contacts with Westerners are especially
 vulnerable. Only members of the seven-man Polit-
 buro seem relatively safe, although there are un-
 confirmed rumors that at least two of them have
 been questioned in connection with the purge.
 A second round of "popular trials" began on
 29 July with the broadcast over Radio Conakry
 of numerous "confessions." Party militants
 listen to these statements,
 weigh the "evidence," and recommend sentences.
 The emphasis in these latest "trials" has been on
 alleged "economic" crimes and participation in
 "foreign spy networks." The population has be-
 come increasingly apathetic and skeptical of the
 charges, but there is no sign that any group is
 planning to move against Toure.
 There are tentative indications that Toure
 would like to wind down the purge this month.
 The process may have acquired a momentum of
 its own, however, because each new wave of ar-
 rests  requires  further justifications.  External
 factors also may prevent an early end to the
 current tensions. Portugal, for instance, probably
 would like to provoke Toure to new domestic
 excesses, and may deliberately encourage his fears
 of new cross-border attacks.
 To date, Toure has singled out Portugal and
 West Germany as the main foreign culprits in-
 volved  with domestic traitors.  References in
 recent confessions to an "American network"
 may foreshadow further attempts to implicate the
 US, however.
 \Toure mayT
 under pressure from party leftists to direct more
 fire at the US, which so far has only been
 obliquely accused of plotting against his govern-
 ment.
 Meanwhile, the UN Security Council met in
 "urgent" session on 3 August at Guinea's request
 to consider charges by Toure that Portuguese-
 backed mercenaries were poised to attack his
 country. Toure later claimed that the council's
 resolution to send a fact-finding mission had "de-
 terred the aggression," and he asked that the
 mission not be sent. Toure has periodically pre-
 dicted the imminence of such attacks since the
 Portuguese-directed raid last November, but there
 is no independent evidence to support his charges

 South Asian Crisis: A ContinuingProblern for the UN
 Since the onset of the civil war in East
 Pakistan last March and the subsequent flight of
 7.1 million refugees into India the UN has been
 trying  to  prevent the  regional  crisis  from
 increasing its disturbing effect on the interna-
 tional scene. Secretary General Thant has been
 unusually energetic in dealing with this situation,
 but various constraints have hindered the interna-
 tional                    community's efforts    to  resolve  the
 imbroglio.
 The initial impulse, and one which remains
 very important, was humanitarian in origin and
 directed toward meeting the immense need for
 food and health supplies in the refugee areas of
 both India and East Bengal. The Pakistani offi-
 cials,            at first unwilling to accept relief, soon
 changed their minds but only recently accepted
 the UN staffing arrangements made by the secre-
 tariat to assist in delivery to refugees. Compound-
 ing the problem, the secessionist Bangla Desh
 radio in Calcutta is broadcasting threats against
 UN  personnel-particularly  US  nationals-who
 participate in any relief effort in East Pakistan.
 India, though accepting the influx of assist-
 ance to the refugees, regards the international
 community's response as inadequate. Moreover,
 New Delhi has been troubled by the presence of
 three Moslems in high-ranking positions in the
 UN's aid effort. Recently, India strongly rejected
 Thant's suggestion that UN observers be placed
 on each side of the Indo-Pakistani frontier and
 requested that foreign personnel withdraw from
 refugee camps in West Bengal. Such personnel,
 they may fear, could inhibit Indian support for
 East Bengali guerrillas.
 In the international political arena, Indian
 and Pakistani diplomats have filed charges and
 countercharges in a number of UN and specialized
 agency forums, and the end of that activity'is not
 yet in sight. India initially seemed inclined toward
 a Security Council session on the conflict, which
 Islamabad maintained was an internal matter and
 thus not within the UN's purview. As the weeks
 passed and the major powers generally remained
 chary of airing in the Council what was surely
 becoming an international dispute, Thant opted
 last month to invoke his powers under Article 99
 of the UN Charter and sent a secret report to the
 parties and the Council members conveying his
 views on the situation in South Asia. His message
 implied that the Council should be convened.
 Council members responded negatively to
 the idea of a meeting on the crisis, and leeks of
 the report-apparently by the disputants seeking
 to present only those elements tending to support
 their case-forced the secretariat to make the text
 public this week. The Pakistanis fear Indian mili-
 tary intervention and now take the line that a
 Council session mi ht be useful.
 The Indians now are strongly opposed to a Coun-
 cil session.
 Meanwhile, accusations of bad faith and hos-
 tile actions continue to be exchanged between
 Islamabad and New Delhi, and the two nations
 appear to be drifting somewhat closer to open
 warfare. The armed forces of both countries re-
 portedly are on alert, and there is considerable
 high-level pessimism that a major clash can be
 prevented.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Cuba: Isolation Diminishes
 The massive delegation that Havana has sent
 to Colombia for the Sixth Pan-American Games is
 one of a series of recent indications of Fidel
 Castro's intense interest in maximum exploitation
 of contacts with other countries in Latin America
 and the Caribbean. This policy, adopted after the
 failure of Che Guevara's guerrilla expedition in
 Bolivia in 1967, has met with far more success
 than has the more aggressive tactic of "exporting
 the revolution." Although Castro can be expected
 to continue to supply training, money, and even
 personnel, where appropriate, to revolutionary
 groups such as the Rebel Armed Forces in Guate-
 mala, he now seems more willing to accept the
 thesis that Cuba's foreign policy goals in Latin
 America  can  be achieved in many countries
 through peaceful means. He believes that events
 in Latin America are developing in his favor, and
 he has sought to take advantage of the situation
 through cautious diplomacy and a more prag-
 matic approach. Castro has had considerable suc-
 cess so far and is likely to continue making
 inroads on the OAS sanctions, which are con-
 sidered by many Latin American political leaders
 as having outlived their usefulness.
 Until  diplomatic  relations  were renewed
 with Chile last November, Cuba had formal ties
 only with Mexico. Now, the governments of Peru
 and Bolivia have indicated that they are studying
 the re-establishment of relations, and Castro has
 already indicated that Havana would consider
 such moves favorably. Should relations be re-
 newed with these countries, others in the hemi-
 sphere would probably take steps to follow suit,
 partly because of a genuine desire to restore ties
 and partly to avoid being the last to climb on the
 bandwagon.
 Except for modest exchanges with Mexico,
 trade with Cuba was formerly conducted by a few
 Latin American countries only in limited amounts
 and in clandestine fashion through an expensive
 and circuitous third-country subterfuge. Now,
 Chile trades openly with Cuba, and the Peruvian
 Government has given official approval of the sale
 to Cuba of more than 100,000 tons of fishmeal to
 be transported in Cuban ships.
 The national airlines in both Cuba and Chile
 fly regularly  scheduled  flights  between their
 respective capitals, facilitating considerably the
 travel of Latin Americans to and from Havana. As
 a result of papering over its differences with
 Mexico, Havana also now has expanded an air
 agreement  that  will  permit each country to

 ment, signed on 31 July, will be in effect for
 three years. There are also persistent rumors that
 the Netherlands Antilles is interested in re-estab-
 lishing an air link between Curacao and Cuba, but
 nothing concrete has developed yet.
 Cultural contacts are also expanding, and
 Cuban film showings and book displays havebeen
 held recently in Chile, Peru, and Colombia. Dur-
 ing Chilean Foreign Minister Almeyda's visit to
 Havana for the celebration on 26 July, a five-year
 cultural,  scientific,  and technical cooperation
 agreement was signed between the two govern-
 ments. Sports delegations from several countries,
 Chile: Recent Del'elojnnents
 including Panama and Colombia, have visited
 Cuba, and large Cuban delegations take part in
 such international events as the Central American
 and  Caribbean  Games and the Pan-American
 Games. Considerable effort is currently being ex-
 pended in Havana to enlarge the local stadium so
 that Cuba can host a regional baseball competi-
 tion                                                                      later this year. The official Cuban press
 agency, which is an arm of the Cuban intelligence
 service, has played an important part in expanded
 contacts. Although its office in Uruguay was re-
 cently closed, since 1968 it has opened new of-
 fices in Lima, La Paz. Quito, and Caracas to
 supplement  the  already-established  offices  in
 Mexico City and Santiago.
 The Christian Left grouping within the PDC
 developed during the PDC-inspired "revolution in
 liberty" of former President Eduardo Frei's ad-
 ministration. It was a factor in the formation of
 the Unitary Popular Action Movement (MAPU),
 which broke away from the PDC two years ago
 and now is a member of Allende's UP coalition.
 The MIC and some dissatisfied MAPU founders
 reportedly will join forces. The formalization of
 the MIC as an independent organization is, at the
 least, a propaganda boon for Allende. Although
 the MIC leadership includes some imaginative and
 energetic workers, many of its members have long
 been considered troublemakers and will not be
 missed by the parent party. The leverage that the
 group may try to exert in the congressional elec-
 tion of 1973 is likely to be slight as the members
 of the MIC are generally poor vote-getters.
 The  Christian  Democratic  Party  (PDC),
 Chile's largest political group and principal voice
 of opposition  to President Allende's Popular
 Unity (UP) coalition, underwent a serious division
 this week. A left-wing group, accusing the party
 leadership of collaborating with conservative ele-
 ments, broke away from the main body of the
 PDC, taking with it at least eight members of the
 Chamber of Deputies. The PDC's representation
 in that chamber is now reduced by about 13
 percent, but opposition forces still make up the
 majority in congress. Another PDC deputy has
 threatened to join the group, which calls itself the
 Movement of the Christian Left (MIC).
 The splinter group's first formal meeting was
 dominated by the former leadership of the PDC's
 youth organization. At that meeting it was an-
 nounced that the MIC would not join the UP
 coalition but would be in close "fraternal con-
 tact" with it. An organizational meeting is sched-
 uled to be held on 15 August, at which time a
 network of cells to be known as "communities
 for socialism" will be set up.
 As Allende moved to capitalize on the PDC's
 problems, all was not well in his own camp. The
 Radical Party (PR), the only non-Marxist member
 of the UP coalition and the self-proclaimed voice
 of democracy within the government, also under-
 went a split this week. Following the PR's na-
 tional  convention,  during  which  one of the
 party's three factions was frozen out of the

 balloting for party president, five senators and
 seven deputies representing that faction bolted
 and said they would form the Independent Radi-
 cal Party (PRI). The leader of the dissidents,
 long-time PR official and left-wing ideologue Luis
 Bossay, pointedly distinguished the new group's
 "proletarian" character from the PR's traditional
 middle-class  orientation.  At an organizational
 meeting, the group created a cellular structure of
 "committees of radical action," to take full effect
 in February. The division of Radical strength into
 two separate groups, although another indication
 of the decline of the Radical Party, is a significant
 complication in Allende's effort to build support
 for a unicameral legislative body.
 The recent partial devaluation of the escudo
 should help to cut foreign exchange losses and
 may also increase Allende's control over business.
 The measure, effective on 27 July, was billed
 mainly as a move to cut tourist expenditures
 abroad and follows closely the imposition of sev-
 eral new foreign exchange taxes that in effect had
 already partially devalued the escudo.
 Chile has traditionally maintained two ex-
 change rates: a "bankers rate" for commodity
 trade and a "brokers rate" for all other transac-
 tions. When Allende took office, the rates were
 12.2 and 14.3 escudos per US dollar, respectively.
 Allende has pledged not to raise the cost of im-
 ports by devaluing, and all of these moves, plus
 recent quantity restrictions on tourist expendi-
 tures, have concentrated on nontrade transac-
 tions. As a result, however, Chile now has a full-
 fledged multiple exchange rate system.
 There are presently three selling rates and
 two buying rates for foreign exchange. Chileans
 purchasing foreign exchange from the Central
 Bank now pay 12.2 escudos per dollar for ap-
 proved imports, 38 escudos for payments to for-
 eign creditors, and 43 escudos per dollar for funds
 for foreign travel or payment of royalty or li-
 censing fees. Exporters receive only 12.2 escudos
 for dollars sold to the Central Bank, and foreign
 tourists  receive 28.  None of these rates ap-
 proaches the current black market rate of about
 65 escudos per dollar.
 The devaluation will have a severe impact on
 travelers and private firms committed to foreign
 payments. The Chilean National Manufacturers'
 Association  (SOFOFA)  estimates that private
 firms owe about $300 million  in short- and
 medium-term debts abroad-largely to US banks
 and companies. About $50-70 million of this to-
 tal is clue this year, as are large royalty and license
 payments. SOFOFA has warned the administra-
 tion that the new rates may bankrupt many firms
 and increase unemployment. Responding to the
 complaints of businessmen the minister of econ-
 omy advised them "not to pay and see what
 happens."
 The new rates, combined with complete gov-
 ernment control of the banking system, will give
 President Allende strong leverage over the remain-
 ing private firms, as they will be hard-pressed to
 come up with enough escudos to meet their for-
 eign obligation s and will need additional bank
 loans.
 The Guatemalization of Uruguay
 The  counterterrorist effort  against  the
 Tupamaros intensified last week. As the presiden-
 tial election campaign unfolds it is increasingly
 clear that the unchecked urban guerrilla activity
 and resulting political repercussions are distinct
 liabilities for the Pacheco administration, the gov-
 ernment appears to be looking with increasing
 favor upon counterviolence as a remedy.
 The discovery of a policeman's body in a
 park in the capital last Friday was balanced off 24
 hours later when the corpse of a Tupamaro was

 found.  The  apparent  torture-murder of  the
 Tupamaro is the first known instance of a killing
 by an Uruguayan counterterrorist organization.
 Pamphlets near the body identified the group
 only as the "Tupamaros Hunt Command," but it
 may be a government-sponsored operation./
 Page  23
 The incipient counterterror movement has
 yet to slow the pace of terrorist activities, how-
 ever. Last week the Tupamaros embarrassed the
 government with another spectacular operation
 when they engineered a mass escape of 37 female
 terrorists from prison. The escape was carried off
 despite open speculation about a pending Tupa-
 maro mass jailbreak attempt, as police acciden-
 tally discovered a half-completed tunnel' to the
 men's prison in February. To add to the govern-
 ment's chagrin, responsibility for prison adminis-
 tration had been transferred earlier this year from
 the Ministry of Culture to that of Interior to
 improve security. The terrorists also recently
 made public a ransom demand of one hundred
 million pesos ($US 400,000) in exchange for a
 prominent Uruguayan businessman, one of five
 hostages they presently hold.
 Although the latest government gaffe, unlike
 previous incidents, has produced no immediate
 resignations, the Congress will probably seek to
 interpellate one or more of the cabinet ministers.
 Congressional-executive  relations  are already
 badly strained; the senate is still considering an
 impeachment move against the President for over-
 stepping his constitutional authority in lighting
 the terrorists. Enthusiasm for the politically in-
 spired move appears on the wane, however. The
 government has used the mass escape to highlight
 its contention that the Congress has not delegated
 sufficient power to allow it to deal effectively
 with the subversive threat.                        25X1
