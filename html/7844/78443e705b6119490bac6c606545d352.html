 Address to the Y Group
 0730, Wednesday, 14 Feb 1979
 Watergate Hotel, Washington,DC
 You're probably about as up to speed on Iran as I am, because part of
 the problem last night was this attack on our embassy.  And in accordance
 with that as you would appreciate, one of the things which we lose is
 communications and so we're really working on the press this morning.  It
 does appear that just before I came here that things are quiet now.  Very
 unfortunately it was apparently confirmed that one American marine has been
 killed in the activities around the  embassy.  Also, a second person has
 been killed.  We are not sure if it was another marine or an Iranian
 employee.  But it appears that pro Khomeini have retaken charge of the
 embassy against whatever this insurgent group was that seized our embassy.
 I think about 70 embassy personnel are holed up on the 3rd floor and have
 managed to survive fortunately, at least at this point.  I think the
 significance of this over and above it being a very unpleasant-affair,
 is that as I see Iran today, we are at a stage of will a Khomeini government
 be able to take charge.  They have got this authority, they have the
 power.  Bhaktiar had the authority and power and he could not do anything
 with it, he could not make the mechanism of government work.  Clearly, I
 think yesterday or this mornings incidents in the embassy reflect the
 struggle that will go on between the leftists element, some of the tudah
 parties, some of the marxist terrorist groups called the Chenks, and the
 people Khoemini has designated to lead this government.  I don't know how
 to predict for you whether who will prevail in this but it is a very
 worrisome situation.  I think many of us are reasonably optimistic that if

 Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP80BO1554R002900230001-9
 the Khoemini forces prevail reason will have out.  I mean the Khoemini's
 dictums of--let's have a banking system but no interest rate, let's have a
 government but bottle it up--probably won't have tremendous impact.  We
 would expect that the key element would be Bazargan with his western
 educated--basically a slant to the West--and whom we think will try to set
 up a democracy with a an Atlantic tint.  One doesn't know what that truly
 means.  We would suspect that Khoemini would go back home and sit and
 provide religious guidance, and that trying to translate that guidance into
 practical, everyday running of the government would be somebody like
 Bazargan's responsibility, done with a little more realism than you could
 do with a 78 year old Ayatollah.
 Clearly it is not a pleasant situation and there is just going to be
 tremendous uncertainty for what I would think would be weeks to come before
 we see how this struggle between the left and the Khomeini forces is worked
 out.  As you know there was also an incident in Afghanistan last night, I
 have very little information on that.  Apparently four terrorists captured
 our ambassador and held him hostage to get weapons.  An anti-regime group.
 I have no idea how they thought they were going to do something with this
 when they got the weapons.  The only report I have is that the Afghan
 police stormed the place of Beige and in the process the ambassador was
 killed by the people holding him hostage.  It sounded to me like an immature
 nation not knowing how to handle something like this and taking a brute
 force approach.

 There is a troubled area of the world ranging all the way across
 Dr. Brzezinski's arch of instability to Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula,
 Iran, Afghanistan.  Turkey is a problem of local instability at the moment,
 not the same stage of development as these others, but one that we have to
 be very concerned with and of course even in Pakistan there is a foundation
 of instability there.  President Zia has got to make up his mind whether
 Bhutto is going to live or die and on that no win question, from his
 point-of-view, a lot is going to hinge there.  If he lets him off and turns
 him out in the street, the odds against Zia suriving in the long run are
 slim.  If he commutes his sentence and leaves him in jail, he may have the
 worst of both worlds.  He has Bhutto to put up with, and he has the military
 and others who want Bhutto dead, on his back.  If he kills Bhutto, who is
 undoubtedly the most popular politician in the country, he may have rioting
 and serious disorder.
 I wouldn't want to say that there weren't any bright spots on the
 scene.  If you look at the fringes of the arch we just described, clearly
 in the last six months or so the Iraqi's have become very concerned and
 cautious about their long term relationship with the Soviet Union.  The
 Saudi Arabians are in a very tenuous and difficult position.  It is hard to
 tell where they are going to go, but clearly all these events have alerted
 them to the problem around them.  The special relationship that traditionally
 existed between them and the United States is up for question at the
 moment.  It is something that Harold Brown is out there right now talking
 to the people in the area about.  India has in the last two years, we
 think, moved a fair distance from its traditional warm relationship with

 Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP80BO1554R002900230001-9
 the Soviet Union.  India is very wary of the Afghan situation as of course
 is Pakistan which is right next door and was the Shah.  In short, I don't
 see a lot of bright signs, but I am saying that the Soviets are finding
 themselves in a position today where some of these inroads they are making
 are alarming people on the fringes and where the Soviets find themselves
 more and more in a position of having to take sides in some of these local
 disputes where they have tried to play both horses before.  So, we have got
 this complicated matrix in South Asia.  The Soviets traditionally supporting
 India, India now opening sides to the United States and China, China
 having been the protector of Pakistan and around we go in a very confused
 circle here.
 It is causing me in my present job some interesting challenges that
 I want to talk to you about very briefly and mainly respond to your questions
 this morning, because these are short term issues that we are grappling
 with day-by-day, but what I wanted to mention very quickly was that we are
 in a period of considerable transition and change in the American intelligence
 community and in the Central Intelligence Agency in particular in our
 country.  Change has come about for a number of reasons, change is taking
 enough shape so it can tell where it is going, but we are not there yet.
 One of the changes is reflected in the fact that you can sit down
 with a group like this and talk without any hesitation about these far
 away countries and their economic and political problems.  I imagine many
 others here have had operations in Iran or elsewhere and are more conversant
 with the problems there than are we in the government.

 Intelligence over the last 30 years in this country has spread out
 from being a largely military oriented operation to one very much involved
 in economics, politics, terrorism, narcotics and has separated from the
 primary focus on the Soviet Union to a focus on all kinds of countries many
 of which we never heard or thought about and whose names didn't even exist
 5 or 10 years ago.  A number of times I deal with Zimbabwe every week--its
 a name I still can't pronounce because its so new.  It has caused us a real
 challenge because we have had to now spread our skills from, again, a lot
 of technical military orientation to just almost every academic discipline
 in the book.  We have had to spread our ability to collect data and find
 ways which, clearly, we didn't find adequately in Iran to sample the
 culture, the religion, the trends, the thinking in the society and so on in
 these countries.  It is an exciting, difficult challenge.  Our resources
 are not all that much greater and I need not belabor the fact that the
 Soviet military is still a very considerable problem and we can't really
 afford to diminish our attention to it in any particular area.  So, we are
 working to do more with less and to be sure that we find the right balance
 of effort.
 I happen to be very persuaded personally, in addition, that we
 ought to be doing more for you, the business community of our country.
 I feel bad not only that we did not give good warning to the government
 on Iran, we didn't give it to business.  We didn't help people like Dan,
 and others of you who had operations out there.  Even if we were prescient
 and knew all those things, there is another problem of how do we get to you
 what we know and what would be helpful to you.  How do we know what you

 Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP80BO1554R002900230001-9
 want to know about what is going on in other parts of the world.  I am not
 advocating a Japanese arrangement where the government and business are
 sort of in bed together, but I think that there is something to be said
 that an interchange here could be very helpful.  We benefit tremendously by
 inputs from you and many of our companies on a very above board, non-clandestine
 way.  It is a shame for us to go out and spy to get information that your
 managers in various countries have because of their contacts and if there
 is a shortcoming in what we did in Iran I think it would be that with
 40,000 Americans there, we didn't tap this pool to get the sense of what
 was going on in that country, as well as we would like to have.  I don't
 know any journalists, or academics or anybody else who tapped it and
 predicted it, or corporations that thought it was going to lead to tension.
 Maybe many corporations were taking proper defensive measures here, but
 somehow as a nation we didn't bring it all together and yet we have a
 tremendous intelligence pool, if you want to call it that of knowledgeable
 Americans on the scene.
 I don't understand frankly how much the business community that was
 operating out there did understand in forecasting the problem or how
 much a business community in a country like that separates itself from the
 cocktail circuit in which our diplomats and military people tend to stay
 and really understand what is going on at the grassroots.  But somehow in
 the country, one of these days, have got to bring that together better.  I
 look forward to working with the American business community more.  One of
 the ways I have tried to do that in a small bit in the last two years is
 reflective of another major trend or change in the intelligence community

 Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP80BO1554R002900230001-9
 of our country and that is being more open.  We are more open today than
 ever before.    I am here with you, for instance, which probably would not
 have been the case five or ten years ago, in part because of a personal
 conviction that we must have the support of the American people. We had
 that support for most of our 30-some years of existence simply on faith, on
 the understanding that you needed to do some secret things, you needed to
 get some information in the kind of world we live in.  After all the
 scandals and disclosures, some true some alleged, I think that faith has
 eroded.  The American public deserves and needs a basis for understanding
 and supporting our intelligence activities, so we have tried to be more
 open in explaining what we do and why we do it, and in particular with
 respect to American business we have tried to publish more of our product.
 I happen to be particularly proud of the fact that we warned all of you in
 March of 1977 that there was going to be an energy crunch coming for the
 world.  Not as it was sometimes misinterpreted, that the world would run out
 of energy or oil energy.  But what we said back then was that in 1981,
 1982, 1983, the world wasn't going to be able to get as much oil out of the
 ground as it was going to want to consume on the surface and I predict to
 you in the next few weeks that message will be re-emphasized in this
 country, accented by the loss of a few million barrels a day of Iranian oil
 which has really focused attention on it but hasn't done much except
 accelerate our prediction a couple of years.  It makes the problem worse,
 it is not generically different than we said it was almost two years ago.
 Part of that prediction was based on our feeling that the Soviet Union
 would be having oil problems, would peak-out in its production about 1980.

 That was looked on with considerable skepticism by the American public, oil
 companies and others.  When we dug into it we found that there aren't many
 oil companies or others in the United States who really study the Soviet
 oil situation, didn't have much business back and forth.  People have made
 assumptions on what their status was and didn't have a lot of facts to back
 it up.  We were able to go back to some of my comments on cooperation
 between industry and intelligence; we were able to take information that
 corporations in this country were willing to share with us as to what they
 were selling to the Soviet Union.  When you pieced all the things together
 you came up with a little picture and you said, hey, that makes you want to
 look into the very classified, highly secret information and tie that
 together and out of this we came to this understanding that the Soviet
 oil production is on a down flow.  Every fact since then has confirmed that
 and most of the oil people then came along and agreed with us since then.
 You've got Soviet oil production going down, now you have got problems
 of a very special type in Iran, no way to predict whether they will try
 to get back to production in a hurry.  We don't think they will be able
 to get back to their 5 1/2 to 6 million barrels a day, even if they
 make a tremendous effort.  There has been damage to the fields, the
 expatriat workers have left, we suspect they won't want to go back to
 that, maybe 3 million or 4 million, something like this with a net deficit
 to the world.  On top of that we think there are technical problems in many
 of the other fields around the world and there is also a much more conserva-
 tionist trend in other oil producing countries around the world.  Why
 should they be pumping that out of the ground when it is going to be more

 valuable to them in the ground in order for the American public to drive
 his car at 70 miles per hour instead of 55 and all the other things we do
 that are (in the world's view) at least a profligate use of this international
 resource.  The trends are all against us in terms of continuing the way we
 are in the use of energy.  The answer is twofold:  there is going to be an
 increase in prices, and constriction in availability which will mean
 economic restraints.  You know more than I what that will mean to you and
 to the rest of the world's economy, but it is not, in my view, a promising
 outlook.
 Here I am, a simple sailor trying to turn from just looking at
 military matters, military intelligence to becoming an economist, an
 international politician of sorts.  That is the kind of challenge we are
 facing.  It is a very exciting one.  We are doing it in a completely new
 atmosphere today than 5 or 10 years ago.  Not only are we more open with
 the public, we are under a degree of oversight and control today that is
 unprecedented in the annals of international intelligence activity.
 This has all come out of a period of intense criticism and investigation
 of the intelligence community.  The Church Committee, the Rockefeller
 Report, the White Committee and so on.  Out of it today, not only am I
 accountable to the President as the Director of Central Intelligence has
 always been, but we have a very specific Presidential written directive on
 how that relationship will exist and what the reporting will be.  We have
 an Intelligence Oversight Board, appointed by the President to check on the
 propriety, the legality of what I am doing, and all the rest of the intelligence
 community.  And, instead if reporting to one or two senior southern

 senators, we report to two very active committees of the Congress who
 are probing us, checking on us all the time.  Let alone, much more visibility
 in the appropriations process of the Congress today.  This is good and it
 is bad.
 It's good in that, you know best than anyone, accountability is what
 makes you hold your feet to the fire and be judicious in your decision
 making.  You have an accountability to come to the bottom line.  You don't
 have that in the government and when the intelligence community really
 didn't have what accountability can exist in the government there was more
 opportunity for abuse, for mistakes, for not judging the risks as carefully
 as you should.  We have that accountability today, and I assure you we are
 being judicious.  There is a danger that you will lean overboard in that
 direction and you won't take risks that you need to take.  There is clearly
 the danger of too many leaks and not being willing and able to do things.
 We were talking about this at breakfast--on the alacrity with which informa-
 tion gets out is very, very inhibiting to our government in so many respects.
 Take for instance the situation in Iran.  We were discussing the helicopters,
 the marines and so on.  I can assure you that it is actually inhibiting to
 the interest of this country when you can't afford in a closed council
 like I am going to at nine o'clock, down the street, to sit there and in
 all candor discuss what are all the actions we will take to protect the
 Americans in Iran, for fear that it will leak out tomorrow and the Turks or
 somebody will be on your back and will not let you do what you need to do.
 It isn't just that it is going to be embarrassing.  On the one hand you
 want to be sure you are ready to help the Americans, on the other hand,

 being ready and talking about it and leaking it may prevent your doing
 that.  It is a very frustrating thing and it has been frustrating particularly
 in the intelligence world that has come from this culture of total secrecy
 and is now cast into a need to be more open with the public.  A very
 suspicious, inquiring media in this country that still has a Watergate
 psychology that says anybody working for the government must be doing
 something wrong -- and this leak phenomenon.  I can assure you that the
 combination of the unwanted attention of publicity and the necessary
 attention of publicity has shaken the intelligence structure of our country
 because the people who have been raised in it all these years have not
 understood the need for some of that and the frustration of having to put
 up with the rest of it.  It has taken us through a trough of morale problems,
 a trough of adjustment to these kinds of changes I have been trying to
 describe to you.
 I think we are snapping out of it and snapping out of it frankly, in
 part because we are also in the midst of a generational change.  If you
 look on a working generation of perhaps 30 years, we have been in business
 in the Central Intelligence Agency 32 years, we are beginning to see the
 old guard pass and a new guard come.  That transition, that change from a
 totally secretive, quiet clandestine operation to one that has got to be
 done under some public scrutiny, under considerable Congressional and
 Executive oversight is a really rather different thing.  Adjusting at the
 same time, what I would call our product line, away from just military to
 all these other areas is an added challenge, an added sense of adjustment.
 I believe we are in a very healthy state nonetheless, I believe that

 the model of intelligence we are evolving here is a going to find the right
 balance it hasn't yet, between the oversight and public attention and the
 necessary secrecy which must go on.  And I find a much greater receptivity
 in the American public, even in the media occasionally, to an understanding
 that we must have some secret activities in our government and that we
 can't go on without being informed in this kind of a world we live in.  If
 there is a silver lining in the cloud of all the criticism of intelligence
 in Iran, it's that people care.  At least there is an understanding that we
 have to know these things.  I find that heartening in many regards.
 I want to stop and take your questions, but just leave you with the
 thought that we have been and still are going through some difficult
 periods of adjustment and transition, but I have tremendous confidence in
 the quality of the people we have , particularly the new young ones coming
 up into the system and I believe we have a very healthy and capable intelligence
 capability in our country today.  It's one that does serve us well and is
 being geared to serve us even better in the year ahead.  Sorry, to have
 gone on as long as I have.

 Y Group Question & Answers
 Q.  One of the foundations of a sound intelligence network is the ability
 to work closely with other countries and rely on what they find out
 and talk back and forth in areas that complement each other.  Have
 we maintained that ability given the varied problems you cited of open
 exposure and open intelligence work that has been so characteristic of
 the last few years and which has been seriously questioned by a number
 of our allies who wonder as to whether we are trustworthy in our
 intelligence work.
 A.    There's no question that is a problem.  I don't think the greater openness
 in itself scares them off, but the unwanted openness does.  When
 the Agee's print books which disclose our operations--and we don't and
 can't do anything about it--that really hurts, because people in
 many other countries don't understand that a former employee can go
 out and violate his secrecy agreement and publish things inimical
 to the best interests of our country and just get away with it
 scott free.  It makes them wonder if we are serious.  Now, at the
 same time I would have to say, an interesting facet of intelligence
 today that is different, I think more than ever before just after
 World War II, is that there are really only two countries in the
 world capable of having a full intelligence capability.  It is so
 expensive to have a satellite as a listening post and all these
 other things, that not even our closest allies like the French and
 the British can afford to have the full panoply.  That gives us a
 lot of leverage in the kind of thing you are talking about.  In short,
 there is a limit to how much they can, if they want, cut us off
 because we have a lot of things to offer to them.  I, haven't had
 to exercise that leverage too much to begin with, but we don't think
 that at this stage they are holding out on us in other liaison activities
 to any substantial extent.  I will say that if we can't curb things
 in the way of Agee type releases in the next year or two, it could
 get worse.
 Q.   There was a story in the New York Times the other day that the Israeli's
 in 1977 saw the beginning of the Shah's decline and began to
 position themselves to get oil from other sources.   Query:  did the
 Israeli's share that with us and if they did, did we listen?
 A.   No, they didn't share it with us.  They may have done this on their
 own.  We have very close liaison with them--I don't really think they
 did predict it myself.  An Israeli general came here and was telling
 people they had and I called him up on it and said if you've been telling
 us this, he was claiming he was telling us this, I said I want to know
 who you told it to and I got a letter of apology back.

 Q.    Could you tell us a little bit about Khomeini and his background
 and his connections with the Russians?
 A.    We may be taken in, but we don't feel that he has a Russian or
 communist leaning.  There is nothing in his background that would
 point that way.  His whole tenet in life is religion, he knows
 the Russians are an atheistic state; he sees the
 antipathy between his land and communism and he, as most
 Iranians, I think, is very well aware of the problems of the
 big bear on the northern border and one that has two problems
 with Iran: One, a large muslim population that can be infected
 by the activities of the south and therefore wants to control
 those activities, and particularly wants to control an islamic
 resurgent leader like Khomeini.  Secondly, what I described
 before with the Russian oil problem they clearly have their eyes on
 that part of the world.  That does not mean of course, that part of
 Khomeini's entourage may not have been affected in these years of
 attempting to undercut the Shah by support from the Tudah people
 or support directly from the Soviets.  We do not have close identi-
 fication; we suspicion that some of those who may have more leftist
 leanings than...... (Tape end)
 Beginning Side B
 Q.    Has any attention been paid...... inaudible.
 A.    We try to follow that kind of activity in any country and one
 as close to us as Canada, we watch with particular care.
 Now, this comes to a very fundamental and.touchy problem.
 The relationship is such that you go and ask Mr. Trudeau what
 is going on and he is pretty forthright with you.
 The extreme is, there is very little old, other than the risk
 of getting caught, of spying on the Soviet Union and nobody
 is going to be too upset if we get in trouble there.  Now
 in between the Canadas and the Soviets, there are the Irans and the
 Pakistans all these other people that you want to know something
 about what is going on, and the degree of risk you will take
 in order to get that information varies with what you judge
 to be the importance of it versus the damage to our country
 if you get caught.  So, we follow Canada in a very benign way
 and we follow the Soviet Union in a very intrusive way.  Each
 country in between we find a different kind of mix according to
 the risks.  The risks in Iran were high.  Savak is a very pervasive
 organization.  The risks were high in that a man like the Shah never
 would understand why you were trucking with the opposition, he would
 assume you were trying to undercut him not maybe to help him by letting
 him know what the opposition were doing whereas his own service would not.
 So, yes we are very interested in what is going on in Quebec and
 we think the domestic political scene up there such that there
 is a reasonable probability that a referendum for a more autonomous
 situation will pass.  It's probably not going to be held this year, so
 I am not going to make a prediction at this stage.  It certainly
 has some political momentum and appeal and that movement could cause
 real problems again for us.

 Q.    Two questions about Iran.  First, some of us have been told that the
 radical movement in the oil fields is not necessarily subject to
 Khomeini's leadership and it could be dangerous if it remains out of
 control.   Second, how concerned should we be about the degree of
 electronic capacity of a sensitive nature to us, if left in Iran
 beyond our control to destroy or get out.
 A.    Back in December Khomeini sent the now prime minister Bazargan down to
 try to get the oil fields back into at least enough production to keep
 the country running.  Bazargan was surprised, we think, when he got
 there and found out his negotitors couldn't get results because the
 strikers were not willing to do things just because Khomeini said to
 do them.  That is part of the struggle which I think we are going to
 see devolve in the weeks just ahead.  There is no evidence that I have
 of Russian inspiration of that.  I am always in a difficult spot
 answering this one because I don't want to appear naive.  One assumes
 they are trying to do this and one assumes that one of the reasons
 these strikers have been resistant to Khomeini is simply that they
 have been indoctrinated by the Tudah.  We do know that over the past
 decade the Tudah party has done more proselytesizing more recruiting
 in the oil field worker area than elsewhere.  Yes, there is some
 communist/Russian influence here, no doubt about it.  I don't have a
 lot of hard evidence, however, particularly of current activity,
 financing or so on.  That is very difficult to pin down.  Most of the
 electronic equipment, F-14 aircraft, missiles, missiles on Iranian
 navy ships was all sold. presumably with the thought that there was a
 reasonable balance between  risks of ..(inaudible)., and the value of
 having them there.  None of us would be happy if these airplanes or
 missiles fell directly in the hands of the Soviet Union, clearly.  I
 suspect, however, that much of the technology that is known, if not
 through Aviation Week, is through previous spying that has gone on.
 In short, it would not be a particularly happy scene to have it fall
 directly in these people's hands to pick up an F-14 and fly it and so
 on.  But, I don't think it is going to be a major breakthrough for the
 Soviets.  There are others more qualified than I on weapons, and they
 would know better how long it would take the Soviets to replicate
 anything that we had in there and I don't think it would help them,
 but it would make that instaneous carbon copy transfer sort of thing.
 The other, of course is the countermeasure they may be able to take if
 they understand the kind of electronic system better; that clearly is
 a problem.
 Q.   Admiral are you satisfied with the ability of the intelligence
 agencies today to recruit able young men and women so that you
 have a good pool handy?

 Approved For Release 2001/08/07 : CIA-RDP80BO1554R002900230001-9
 A.   Yes.  We are lucky.  I think the young people of this country are just
 super and they have seen through a lot of this and even in the types
 of criticism, 3 or 4 years ago, recruiting didn't drop off.  Our
 numbers are up this year from last and last spring we put an ad in the
 New York Times and holy mackerel we had two and a half times more
 applicants that month. If I say that in some public forum, the telephone
 goes off the hook.  I was in Boston a few months ago, on a morning tv
 talk show and somehow this question came up and I said we were looking
 for more women to join our clandestine service.  Later in the afternoon,
 Charlie Battaglia over here called up our recruiting office up there
 and they said  the phone has been buzzing ever since the Admiral got
 off the tube this morning.  The quality is the same, we think
 it is pretty close.  I would be interested in your reflections on
 this, to those of you in the overseas business.  We are having more
 trouble getting people who want to join the overseas element of the
 agency.  The military can often send a wife and a husband team to the
 same place together, but they've a big operation.  My activities
 overseas are measured in much smaller numbers in the Central Intelligence
 Agency than maybe the Army or something, so it is hard to find a
 place where in the same locale you can locate a wife and a husband
 who have different skills, different grade levels and get a meaningful
 job for these each.  We are having problems in taking the recruits and
 finding enough of them who will say yes, I would like to sign up for
 life of largely overseas living.  It is a different culture today and
 I don't know how we're going to attack that one.  We are trying to
 change the emoluments, we are trying to change the privileges and so
 on. There are limits to what I can get the government to let me
 pay the people who go overseas and how much that will really attract
 people.  The wife is not very happy sitting in some country twiddling
 her thumbs.
 Q.   Would you comment briefly on the situation in Southeast
 Asia as it pertains to the Soviet Union and China?
 A.   That is a very touchy one. I think the irony of it is that
 the best guerilla warfare people have got themselves mired down in
 a guerrilla warfare problem.  We think the Vietnamese
 kicked that thing off either on the assumption that the
 Cambodians would hate Pol Pot more than they would hate
 the Vietnamese, and therefore it would rally to the Vietnamese
 to accept them and that didn't prove to be true.  Or,
 because in November they had a battle in Northeast
 Cambodia and wiped out a Cambodian division and maybe thought
 that Cambodia was going to fight main force battle fights.and that
 they could go in there and clean it up quickly.  Well they went in
 and the Cambodians disappeared into the bush just like the
 Vietnamese had done to us and others. So, there is a very substantial
 resistance movement going on.  Clearly, the Russians are supporting

 the Vietnamese in this.  I think in large measure they already have
 their position in Vietnam, but because they are smarting from the
 Japanese/US overtures to China which has North Korea more in China's
 camp than Russia's, so north and east Asia is anti-Soviet from a
 Soviet point-of-view and they are saying we are going to show those
 people by consolidating our position and expanding it and showing our
 strength in Southeast Asia.  You heard Deng Xiaoping; he said we
 are going to teach them a lesson.  He's very concerned of the impact
 of the other lesson, i.e., we, the Soviets, can back our forces down
 here on  Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.  Whether Deng
 Xiaoping will be as bold in fact, now that he has been home almost a
 week, and launch that attack, I don't know.  But there are sizeable
 Chinese forces available in that area to do it, larger forces than
 just a threat.  It remains a danger, a real possibility. Success for
 the Cambodians may in fact make it less necessary for China to do
 that. Of course, then the 64 dollar question is if China feels it
 has to teach a lesson and how.  How bad will it be.  Will they try to
 go all the way to Hanoi and try to topple the government
 there or do something like that, or just  and demonstrate they are
 tough guys and, depending on how tough they are, what will be the
 Soviet reaction be.  More aid for Vietnam, would there be the establish-
 ment of Soviet bases in Vietnam, would there be a corresponding raid
 or incursion on the Chinese border to the north.  It is a very touchy
 and dangerous situation now.  There is a lot of pride hanging on the
 line, a lot of thinking towards the long term and what this portends
 for the attitudes of the other countries in the area.  We hope it
 can be contained and not get out of control, but we don't know how to
 predict it.
