By Stanley Karnow 
As he walks his poodle along 
the shaded street near his split-
level Alexandria home, Maj. Gen. 
Edward Geary Lansdale resembles 
any number of retired officers 
pasturing in the Washington sub-
urbs. He is still lean and erect de-
spite his 64 years, and, like so 
many military, pensioners, he 
finds life somewhat tame after his 
adventurous career. 
But in contrast to the superan-
nuated colonels who reconstruct 
battles at the dinner table, Lans-
dale's experiences were of a high 
order. For he \ vas in times past a 
dynamic, influential and often 
controversial figure who single-
handedly managed foreign gov-
ernments and Whose behind-
the-scenes counsel helped to 
shape U.S. policy and practice at 
critical junctures in recent his-
tory. 
In the Philippines during the 
early 1950s, for example, Lansdale 
Virtually directed the campaign 
against the Communist-led Huks 
in his capacity as special adviser 
to Ramon Magsaysay, then that 
country's defense secretary. In 
Saigon not long after, he effec-
tively kept South Vietnamese 
President Ngo Dinh Diem in of-
fice by conspiring to crush his do-
mestic foes while . persuading 
Washington to support him. 
Later, as the Vietnam war esca-
lated,Lansdale was instrumental in 
Convincing President Eisenhower 
and Kennedy that the United 
States and its Vietnamese clients 
could defeat the Vietcong by rely-
ing on counterinsurgency techni-
ques. Some of these techniques, 
as disclosed in the secret Penta-
gon Papers, have revealed him to 
be considerably less savory than 
the public image of him as an ide-
alist. 
Little of the exotic drama that 
characterized Lansdale's career is 
apparent in hiORPERVO rFeAFIR 
iS a' gray, unass'uming man whose 
subdued style borders on self-
effacement. Some of his friends 
suggest that he has lost, much of 
his verve since his wife's death 
last spring, and he himself con-
cedes that her passing has left 
him lonely and dispirited. Except 
for occasional evenings with old 
cronies, many of them Asia veter-
ans like himself, he leads a rather 
secluded existence. 
Other friends point out that he 
is weary after years of baffling 
bureaucrats who oppose his un-
conventional ideas, and Lansdale 
himself substantiates that view 
with bitter humor when he says 
that "the knives going in don't 
seem to hurt anymore." Yet, as he 
Speaks, it is clear that he still 
burns with a hard flame that is 
nearly religious in fervor. His reli-
gion, he explains, is not formal. It 
is his faith that the United States 
could have successfully played 
world policeman by propagating 
its political philosophy. 
At the core of Lansdale's doc-
trine is the conviction that Com-
munist guerrillas can be defeated 
in brushfire wars by "winning the 
hearts and minds" of people. In 
Vietnam, according to this thesis, 
the United States should have 
exported American democratic 
principles along with guns, mon-
ey, machinery and food. "We 
couldn't afford to be just against 
the Communists," Lansdale has 
written. "We had to be for some-
thing." 
Lansdale's proposals often pro-
voked the fury of Establishment 
strategists, some powerful 
enough to block his advance-
ment. He has also been derided 
as a dreamer whose perception of 
reality was, at best, blurred. At 
the same time, though, he in-
spired a coterie of disciples who 
regarded him as nearly infallible. 
The debate over him polarized 
I /)f0t0I4 :trig-1. 
trialOnPM tiiat, whatever the 
validity of their arguments, at 
least endowed him with a meas-
ure of literary immortality. Wil-
liam J. Lederer and Eugene Bur-
dick portrayed him in The Ugly 
American as Col. Edwin Barnum 
Hil.lendale, whose sweet harmon-
ica purportedly stimulated rural 
Filipinos to oppose Communism. 
Graham Greene, on the other 
hand, depicted him in The Quiet 
American as-Alden Pyle, the naive 
U.S. official who believed that he 
could mobilize Vietnamese peas-
ants to resist the Communists by 
instilling them with the precepts 
of Town Hall democracy. 
Although the old soldier has 
faded away, the debate lingers 
on. Just as Lederer and Burdick 
approvingly quote their hero as 
saying that "if you use the right 
key, you can maneuver any per-
son or nation any way you want," 
so Lansdale's disciples still con-
tend that the United States could 
have attained its objectives in Vi-
etnam by developing psychologi-
cal warfare methods more effica-
cious than those employed by the 
Communists. This view, which 
became popular during the Ken-
nedy Administration, is best artic-
ulated in the articles of Lansdale's 
close friend, Robert Shaplen, the 
New Yorker correspondent in Sai-
gon, who has long asserted that 
the United States and its South Vi-
etnamese proteges could have 
beat the Communists by 
preempting the revolution. And 
just as Graham Greene indirectly 
reproved Lansdale by declaring 
that Vietnamese "don't want our 
white skins around telling them 
what they want," so his present-
day critics claim that he never ac-

The Washington Merry-Go-litound 
Coiunatists 
By Jack Andcrson 
The Greek dictatorship has 
sponsored a luxury tour for 
some of America's best-read 
conservative columnists. In 
some cases, their wives also 
made the trip. 
Not surprisingly, the red-
carpet trip produced a gush of 
pro-junta columns in the na-
tion's press. Readers, however, 
didn't know that the tour was 
financed, at $2,000 a head, by 
t h e government-controlled 
Hellenic Industrial Develop-
ment Bank, whose urbane gov-
ernor, P a ti I Totomis, once 
rounded up thousands of inno-
cent Greeks in concentration 
camps. 
Totomis was the Junta's 
Minister of Public Order for 
six months after the 1967 
coup. This charming Athenian 
man-about-town put up the 
columnists at the plush King 
George Hotel, arranged for 
their first class travel and 
picked up their bills for fine 
wines and Greek foods. 
The suave Totomis and his 
bosses would have gotten their 
money's worth out of the jun-
ket if the only man on it had 
been Ralph de Toledano, who 
distributes his conservative 
views to 100 papers. "For the 
first time in its 150 years -of in-
dependence," wrote de 
Toledano, "Greece is prosper-
ing and the people satisfied." 
But de Toledano had another 
gift for the Greeks. When To-
tomis' bank sponsored a pavil-
_lion at the Greek-American 
.Ar

deToledano wrote Vice Presi-

Greek's good works. 
In a personal letter, Agnew 
? without ever seeing ' the 
bank's pavillion ? lauded To-
tomis' contribution to Greek-
American amity. The letter 
has been proudly publicized 
by Totomis. 
The dictatorship reaped fur-
ther benefits from columnist

of Commerce economic writer. 
While most of the copy writ-

candidly: "The fact is that the

of dictatorship which exer-

Kremlin exploits anti-CIA charges

Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
? Washington 
For weeks now the Russians have been 
,shrilly playing up India:'s charges that the 
VCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA) is med-
dling in its internal affairs. 
Sensitive about their own relationship with 
New Delhi, the Soviets appear to be trying to 
drive an even deeper wedge between India 
and the United States and to prevent the two 
from moving toward any healing dialogue. 
If the Kremlin's vociferous anti-CIA cam-
paign points up anything, say U.S. officials, it 
Is that the detente between the Soviet Union 
and the United States does not put an end to 
the political or ideological rivalry of the two 
powers. Moscow continues to pursue its own 
national interests and in the given case that 
interest lies in expanding its own influence in 
southern Asia and removing that of the 
Americans. 
The Russians also are trying to discredit 
U.S. relations with the Philippines. On Oct. 25

Asia, said that Washington is irritated by the

the CIA, working through such philanthropic 
organizations as ? Asia Fund, was inciting 
separatist sentiments in Nagaland and trying 
to sour relations between India and Bangla-
desh as well as between India and the Soviet 
Union. It described these alleged activities in 
minute detail. 
As U.S. officials assess it, the Soviet 
campaign must be viewed against the back-
drop of Moscow's own position in India. That, 
despite the treaty of friendship, has never 
been as firm as the Russians would like and 
they apparently want to shore it up. 
Economic relations with New Delhi, for 
instance, have been complicated over the 
past few years. The Indians, for one, have not 
been willing to give the Soviets the desired 
credits. 
A coolish Kremlin view of the Indian 
economy is reflected in a recent commentary 
in the Soviet monthly Peoples of Asia and 
Africa on the 25th anniversary of India's 
independence. The article points out that

urging Philippines President 
.:Ferdinand Marcos to release 
imprisoned newsmen was 
;called for last week by the 
--,:t7e.Rev. Eddie Karnes on his re-
turn from that embattled na-
e:tion. ? 
Karnes, director of the Ta-

the most stunning things he 
? ever experienced.

? ONLY PAPER 
A 
? T h e following day the 
Daily Express, a pro-govern-
ment paper believed owned 
by Marcos, appeared as the 
only newspaper , published. It 
listed the name; of persons 
arrested, and anneenced re-
f or ms Marcos planned to 
bring about. 
At this time more than 200 
persons :lave been arrested 
and "the country is in a ter-
rible turmoil, on the verge of 
out and out general insur-
rection. Tins is a country of 
youth, one out of three per-
sons is under 17. Marcos has 
alienated many of them by 
bypassing the Constitution," 
said Karnes. 
"Ironically," Karnes said, 
"Manila is to,lay one of the 
safest of Asan cities to visit. 
Crime is down to zero, prices 
are low, strikei that threat-
ened before have been elimi-
nated." 
Longhairs are forced to get 
haircuts. And with a mid-
night curfew, "people are 
getting more sleep and the 
cabarets are going out of 
business," said Karnes, add-
ing, "I want to present a 
balanced picture. Not every-
thing is bad." 
APPALLED 
But he said he is appalled 
at the elimination of civil lib-
erties?parlicelarly freedom 
of the press, by Marcos. 
He described his two most 
fearsome realizations in Ma-
nila as finding there were no 
newspapers one morning and 
hearing a rumbling sound on 
a subsequent night and look-
ing out to see tanks, followed 
by a thousand men, rolling 
through the streets. 
Karnes says the problems 
of the Philippines are deep 
but basically stein from the 
monopoly of power and 
wealth held by the Catholic 
Church and a tiny minority 
of private citizens and the 
economic interests of the 
United States. 
, America is still loved by 
'the people, much as nearly 
30 years ago when Karnes 
was among the late Gen. 
McArthur's returning forces, 
he says. 
RIPE FOR REVOLT 
"The Philippines nonethe-
less remain the ripest coun-
try in the world for Com-
munist revolution, with mas-
ses of poor and many unem-
ployed," says Karnes. 
He says to prevent a revo-
lution, Marcos must impose 
immediate and far-reaching 
reforms and to restore civil 
liberties. 
"Once the students of the 
Philippines realize Marcos 
has in fact instituted a mili-
tary takeover, they will rise 
up by the thousands. In the 
midst of the revolution Red 
China may be tempted to in-
tervene to protect the inter-
ests of Philippine Chinese 
who hold the reins to much 
economic power. 
CIA CHARGES 
"There are charges that 
the CIA is involved (in Mar-
cos' actions). If so, there is 
no question in toy mind but 
that the CIA led us into the 
Vietnam situation," said Kar-
nes, a regular visitor to 
southeast Asia as part of his 
religious activities. 
"More than ever, I appre-
ciate the free press we have 
in this country. The morning 
no papers arrived in Manila, 
it struck fear into the heart 
of the country and resulted 
in great anxiety. 
Karnes, a one-time Re-
publican candidate for Con-
gress, said he has written to 
President Nixon and other 
leaders and plans to write 
Marcos, ureing the release of 
the newsmen. 
"I urge you and the others 
concerned newsmen to do the 
same," he concluded.

The stoly below, though written prior to 
the declaration of martial law by President 
Marcos of the Philippines, adds a reveal-
ing dimension to Marcos' cct. His aim is to 
dear the path of mounting opposition 
based on the rnony economic and social 
problems in the Philippines, and to swing 
the country to the right. The "statehood" 
movement, reported on here, serves the 
same purpose. 
Utilizing the time-worn cry of "the fled 
'menace," Moircos, as of this writing, has 
'ailed 96 persons of note, including Con-
gressmen, ccvernors and journalists. The 
list is topped by Senator Benign() S. Aquino, 
Jr., leader of the opposition Liberal Party, 
who was to have cpposed Marcos for the 
presidency next year. Marcos has also 
dosed down six newspapers. 
Although he ha: promised steps to-
ward nationalization and land reform, he 
has also assured U.S. investors there would 
be no change in "relations established by 
previous contrccts."

LONDON 
Amonstrous con game, promoted 
with U.S. backing, has been built 
up for the past year or more in the Philip-
pines. A fraudulent scheme proclaimed 
as a campaign to win U.S. statehood for 
the Philippines. it is aimed at stifling 
Filipino nationalism and anti-imperial-
ism and at creating a firmer nco-coloniai 
base for big U.S. corporations in Asia. 
Calling itself "Philippine Statehood, 
USA,- the campaign was launched in mid-
1971 with expensive full-page advertise-
ments in the Manila newspapers. By 
June 1972 its organizers announced that it 
had enrolled 5,700.000 member-supporters 
out of the Philippine population of 38 mil-
lion. 
7 Investigation of the campaign has 
revealed that it was initially set up with a 
U.S. CIA agent named West as the chief 
adviser. Its national chairman is an ex-
Congressman. real-estate tycoon and im-
porter of Japanese Suzuki motorcycles,

was the biggest single financial contribu-
tor to. the World Anti-Communist League 
Conference held in Manila. 
The movement has brought a large 
number of ranking military men into its 
leadership, giving a suspiciously mili-
tary, cast to its organization. Among these 
are Col. Jose Maristela, a vice-chairman 
for Luzon; Cots. Concepcion Cardenas, 
Enrique Perez and Jose Elasigui, direc-
tors-general for military affairs; Col. 
Flaviano Ramirez and Lt. Fidencio Mon-
tero, directors-general for intelligence 
and security,: and Cols. Francisco Offe-
maria and Justiniano Mendoza, directors-
general for veterans' organizations. The 
presence of these elements in a set-up 
with such military overtones has been 
pointed to by Filipino progressives as 
laying the basis for a Rightist coup. 
In its propaganda, Philippine State-
hood, USA, plays up the United States as 
a land of milk and honey in which Fili-
pinos would have all their burdens of 
unemployment, poverty, corruption and 
general underd eV elopment magically 
removed. Unemployment affects nearly 
20'-c of the Philippine labor force today, 
and serious partial employment anotIcer

ment figures, are desperately poor, a con-
dition that Antonio. Cabangbang and their 
crew fail to mention is directly due to 
U.S. neo-colonial domination. 
Nevertheless. Antonio claims that as

soar to prosperity as the base for huge 
distribution of U.S. commodities in Asia, 
With "billions of dollars" of U.S. capital 
flowing in to create an industrial Philip-
pine paradise. Since 1946 the Philippines 
has been precisely such a base, with U.S. 
corporations enjoying equal rights with 
Filipinos in a shameless neo-colonial ar-
rangement. According to the statehood 
schemers, if Filipinos change their inde-
pendence to become Americans they will 
automatically become rich under the 
same arrangement that has made them 
poor. 
Asked by an interviewer how brown 
Filipinos could expect equality when 
Black Americans in the United States 
suffer racial discrimination, Antonio re-
plied: "The Negros should be forever 
thankful to the Americans. Never in their 
dreams did they think that they would 
be enjoying the same rights and privi-
leges enjoyed by their white American 
m.nsters." ; 
The huge membership claims made 
by Philippine Statehood, USA, are de-
rived from trips to the rural areas by 
slick organizers. Here, where literacy is 
slight, impoverished peasants are asked 
to sign papers written in English that few 
can read and are made to think that they 
are petitioning for jobs and government 
handouts at U.S. income levels. 
What is most suspicious and unsavory 
about this campaign is the fact that, al-
though it is loudly publicized and has be-
come a major issue in the Philippines,

of neo-colonialism. ? 
When the Philippines obtained 
its independence on July 4, 1916, 
it was a war-ruined country, on 
which the U.S. imposed an array 
of treaties that placed its econo-
my. armed forces, foreign affairs 
and other aspects of life under 
the domination of U.S. interests 
and aggressive policies. . 
One of the agreements was the

rican "parity" rights to all sec-

The "parity" arrangement was 
linked to "a ? neo-colonial trade

28 years and to terminate in 1974. 
For the past decade and a half, 
American investment.interests in 
the Philippines have been maneu-
vering to retain their "parity 
rights" after 1974. Amounting to 
less than $250 million at the time 
of independence, those investments 
now total around $1.2 billion (ex-
cluding loans and portfolio hold-
ings). ? 
Test case 
One of the maneuvers, begun 
over a decade ago, is the case 
just ruled upon by the Philippine 
Supreme Court. An American 
businessmen, William Quasha, ini-
tiated a test case, claiming the 
right to continue owning a plot 
of land after "parity" ends. This 
claim for "vested rights" in per- . 
petuity for property acquired by 
Americans under "parity" was 
backed by the entire American 
business community in the Phi-
lippines. If they won it, well and 
good, but it was not the only egg 
in the neo-colonial basket. ' 
A Philippine Constitutional Con-
vention has been sitting since June, 
1971, and will probably last until'. 
the end of this year. A central 
theme has been that of "special 
rights" for American interests. 
A policy-making committee-of the 
convention has already adopted a 
proposal permitting Americans to 
own land after 1974. 
In this convention, dominated by 
delegates closely associated with 
American investment interests, the 
pet proposal of these interests is 
for Constitutional guarantees of 
"national treatment" for U.S. in-
vestmentS. This would merely be 
"pa'rity" in another, form, grant-
ing American interests the same' 
treatment that Filipinos enjoy. 
Furthermore, in 1969 the pre-

which permits Americans to have 
100 percent ownership of busi-

is allegedly insufficient Filipino 
capital. Under this law, Ford, 
General Motors, Caltex and other 
U.S. monopolies moved recently

Beginning of a Fishy Tale 
? The WM Karagatan, a modest fishing vessel 
. of 91 gross tons and fewer than 90 feet from 
how to-stern, turned up in Manila anchorage 
last May 15. The newly acquired property of a 
newly formed company called Karagatan Fish-
ing Corp., it was purchased from a Japanese 
ship broker for $45,000. Karagatan Fishing 
Cop. was incorporated last spring by five 
young Filipinos at a paper value of 199,000 
pesos (about $30,0.00). The five young men 
aren't believed to have any substantial per-
sonal income, or assets. Their registered ad-
dresses were found to be fictitious. All five 
.-have disappeared without a trace. 
? 'While-in Manila anchorage, the original 
crew of he Karagatan was dismissed,- and a 
new crew, largely comprising young men with-
out formal marine training, took over the boat. 
The Karagatan was duly registered as a Philip-
pine fishing vessel and Vas granted a clear-
? ance to fish in waters off Palawan on the south: 
ern -coast of Limon. On June 3 the Karagatan 
Chugged out of Manila Bay. 
the following few days and to what extent sto-
ries of the battle have escalated in the- folrow-
ing weeks arc subject to .some dispute. The 
Philippine armed forces speak of a major en-
gagement "with a large armed group with 
seemingly unlimited supplies of ammunition." 
Naval vessels were summoned to Digoyo Bay 
to shell the coastline, and air . strikes were 
called in on "enemy" positions. 
Some sources remain a hit Skeptical of the. 
combat reports. Was there really a lot of fight-

"Well, I hear there was a.lot of shooting," he 
replies. What were the naval and air barrages

Maoist Disruption in the Philippines* 
The Communist Party of the Philippines (Partido Komunista ng 
Pilipinas, or PKP), conducting a difficult struggle under harsh con-
ditions of illegality against the neo-colonial domination of American 
imperialism, has been compelled for some time to contend with an 
equally vicious assault upon itself from the ultra-Left. This comes 
from an unscrupulous Maoist splinter group that is openly backed 
and encouraged in its anti-Party excesses by the Peking leadership, 
the attitude of which makes it difficult not to conclude that its aim 
is to destroy the PIG', the tested vanguard of the Philippine working 
class, as part of a policy of establishing control over the liberation 
movements of Asia, as the cornerstone of a similar world drive. 
Besides being nurtured and supported by Peking, the Maoist phen-
omenon in the Philippines has been given the maximum leeway and 
encouragement by American imperialism. The CIA and its Philippine 
counterparts and neo-colonialist groupings have in a variety of ways 
fostered and made use of the adventurist, splittist activities of the 
Maoists, who are significantly well-financed to a degree never experi-
enced, now or in the past, by the PKP and the movements it has led. 
This convergence of Peking and American imperialist intrigues is one 
of the most marked features of the Philippine situation. 
A Considerable amount of confusion and misunderstanding has been 
created abroad about events and Movements in the Philippines be-
cause of the Maoists' arbitrary and shameless usurpation of the name 
' of the Communist Party and because their activities are widely and 
deliberately publicized by the imperialist press as if they were those 
of the genuine Communist Party of the Philippines, reports that have 
been readily picked up and enlarged upon in the radical and ultra-
Left press in the United States and elsewhere. 
Imperialist Splitting Tactics 
One of the chief tactical aims of American imperialism in trying to 
cope with the Philippine revolutionary movement has been to attempt 
to split its vanguard party and the organized masses under the party's 
influence. American imperialism has had to contend with the fact that, 
from its foundation in 1930 and through the armed struggle of the 
Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan (HNIB) or Army of the National 
Liberation in the 1950s, the Communist Party of the Philippines 
(PKP) was the undisputed ideological leader of the Filipino left. No 
Social-Democratic, Trotskyite, anarchist or other deviationist groups 
had existed up to that time in the Philippines revolutionary move-
ment. The PKP had unrivalled prestige especially among the peasant-
ry and urban working class in which it had sunk deep roots during 
decades of dedicated and uncompromising struggle. 
The first serious splitting effort by American imperialism occurred 
in the latter stage of the Huk armed struggle, and emanated from 
the" intelligence agencies connected with the Philippine Depai Unent 
.of National Defense, then headed by the CIA stooge, Ramon Mag-
saysay, and directed by the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group sta-
tioned in the Philippines. It was an operation to play upon the 
grievances and to obtain the surrender of Luis Taruc, then with the 
HMB guerrilla forces as the Organizational Secretary of the PKP. 
Taruc, who had careerist ambitions within the PKP but due to per-
sonal and ideological deficiencies had been unable to reali7e these, 
responded to _contacts made. with him. In 1953 he was expelled from

Affairs, December 1967.) Following the CIA-managed election lof 
Ramon Magsaysay to the Philippine presidency, Taruc surrendered 
to him in 1954. The surrender was negotiated by Benig-no Aquino, a 
young Filipino landlord with eyes on a political career, who was 
acting for the masterminders, the CIA. 
As soon as Taruc surrendered, Magsaysay and his mentors broached 
to him the idea of organizing a Socialist Party to try to split the PKP-
led masses. This scheme sought to capitalize on the fact that Taruc 
had been a member of the old Socialist Party founded by Pedro Abad 
Santos in Pampanga province in the early 1930s; it had merged com-
pletely with the Communist Party in 1938. The CIA scheme had 
several flaws. For one thing, the Socialist Party had borne no relation 
to social-democracy and its anti-Communist manifestations as known 
in Europe or the United States, and whatever organizational or ideo-
logical shortcomings it had had were overcome when it had merged 
with PKP. For another thing, Taruc was wholly discredited because 
of his surrender and renegadism and could carry virtually no cadres 
from the PKP with him. The Socialist Party idea subsided. 
Other splitting attempts were made among the large numbers of 
PKP and IIMB political prisoners who were confined in Philippine 
prisons and army compounds with very long sentences from 1950 
onwards. This operation was coordinated by the CIA and Philippine 
intelligence agencies with Catholic Church circles, particularly the 
Jesuits, who have mainly American direction in the Philippines. Cath-
olic priests worked to exploit every possible difference and weakness 
among the political prisoners. The cadres could be counted on one 
hand who were affected by these intrigues, which involved not the 
swaying of ideological conviction so much as the making available of 
an instrument (particularly to get out of prison) on which a prisoner 
with petty grievances against leaders could lean (petty grievances 
become greatly magnified in the narrow world of confinement). Luis 
Taruc, however, readily became a Catholic and was made a leading 
member of the Jesuit- and CIA-created Christian Social Movement, 
set up in 1967 with reformist slogans to endeavor to channel mass 
unrest away from PKP influence. 
None of these splitting schemes and intrigues made any significant 
headway in offsetting the vanguard leadership and prestige of the 
PKP. American imperialism and its neo-colonial allies have had to 
think in other terms in regard to coping with a revolutionary move-
ment that they could not physically destroy. These reactionary forces 
have seen fresh and more interesting opportunities to divide the Left 
arising out of the new tide of militant and revolutionary struggles 
that has developed in the Philippines over the past decade. 
Resurgence of Revolutionary Struggle 
A period of demoralization among the masses and to some extent 
in Party ranks followed the defeat of the Huk armed struggle in the 
1950s. This, however, was of comparatively brief duration in Com-
munist ranks or among the peasant and worker masses that had borne 
the brunt of bloody military suppression and terror. By the early 
1960s a resurgence was well under way. In addition to the rapid re-
vival of mass organizations and struggles, new sections of the popula-
tion, previously not engaged in sharp battles of an anti-imperialist or 
class character, have come to the fore in militant confrontation with 
the neo-colonial system. It is in the non-proletarian, petty-bourgeois 
sectors that have been involved, without past experience of organiza-
tion or struggle but extremely impatient for their demands to be 
satisfied quickly, that imperialism and Peking have found ingredients 
of trou ble-making.

App rove clpfshcpje?ARe2A/Psi404/94 ;IghlikRERRAMOilpi9M0010001 -5 
that had precipitated the Hulc struggle. Neo-colonialism has confined 
the Philippines to a backward, mainly agricultural producing and 
exporting economy under the ever-widening domination of foreign 
monopolies, and has had a disastrous effect on living conditions of the 
people. 
In particular the peasant masses, denied desperately-needed land 
reform, have been increasingly impoverished. Between 1948 and 1965 
the rate of farm tenancy rose from 38 to 52 per cent, while disposses-
sion of peasant cultivators, both owners and tenants, has forced 60 
per cent of the peasantry into the status of agricultural laborers. 
For urban workers, a retarding of industrialization and the growth 
of American-owned industry that is capital-intensive rather than labor-
intensive, as needed, has meant rising unemployment and declining 
real wages. Between 1955 and 1967 soaring prices and living costs 
caused a fall of 22.4 per cent in real wages for skilled and 14.S per 
scent for unskilled labor. Government figures, which seek to minimize 
the phenomenon, showed 1,067,000 unemployed in 1963, or 8.7 per 
cent of the labor force, but nationalist economists have contended 
that true unemployment is around 2,500,000 or 19 per cent of the labor 
force, while 2,200,000 in addition are idle for 23 to 51 weeks out of 
the year. 
Consequently, the Filipino working classes in general have been 
prepared for a new stage of struggles. Strikes of increasing frequency 
have occurred among broad sectors, including those not previously 
affected by strike action, such as teachers and other government 
employees, bus drivers, and workers on American military bases, while 
in the countryside the incidence of armed struggle, which never fully 
subsided as a result of suppression, has begun to appear again. 
Among the most dramatic features of the new period has been the 
stepping forward into sharp and bitter struggle of middle-class ele-
ments, badly hit by high prices, lack of opportunities, professional 
unemployment and foreign cultural domination. Students and intellec-
tuals in particular have reacted. 
It was not until after the defeat of the Huk struggle that Filip-ino 
petty-bourgeois elements in significant numbers began to develop an 
anti-imperialist attitude. An attempt to start a nationalist alternative 
political party, the Nationalist-Citizens Party, established by Senator 
Claro M. Recto in 1956, aroused nationalist sentiments among these 
groups, but the Nationalist-Citizens Party was stifled by imperialist 
pressures and disappeared after the death of Recto in 1960. The set-
back in this venture left a residue of frustrated anti-imperialist feeling 
among intellectuals and students, and helped to cause many of them 
to turn to the illegal PKP for solutions. 
Student youth and those graduating into the professions have en-
countered the blind alleys of neo-colonial underdevelopment. Of the 
growing army of unemployed, 25 per cent come from those who have 
completed the fourth year of secondary school and beyond, half of 
these being university graduates without jobs of any kind. The impact 
of this may be gauged from the huge increase in university students 
in the Philippines (600,000 in 1969, or nearly 20 per cent of those in 
the 20-24 age group). The explosive effect of this phenomenon of the 
"educated unemployed" in underdeveloped countries has been plain 
in a number of such countries, as in the extreme case of the youthful 
uprising against the progressive Bandaranaike government in Ceylon. 
An upheaval among Filipino student youth began at the start of 
the 1960s, with demonstrations of defiance against harassing investi-
gations in universities by the Congressional Committee on Un-Filipino 
Activities (CUFA), a ?uppet carbon-copy of the HUAC in the United

Youth), was established as a rallying center t_lat drew tusanes o 
peasant and worker as well as student youth into its ranks. It played 
a leading role in stimulating the revival of the general mass movement. 
At this time there was admirable unity and solidarity on the Philip-
pine Left, which drew its greatest inspiration from the Huk struggle 
that had preceded the new movement and from the dedication of the 
PKP members who had led that struggle and were still in prison. 
PKP members, both old and new, gave indispensable support to the 
Kabataang Makabayan and to other new mass organizations that came 
into being along with it. 
The Beginnings of Disruption 
One of the figures who became prominent in the popular resurgence 
was Jose Maria Sison, a young Filipino student who studied for a 
time in Indonesia in the early 1960s, where he came in contact with 
Maoist-inclined members of the Communist Party of Indonesia and 
of the Chinese community in that country. On his return to the 
Philippines he became a member of the underground PKP, which 
guided his activities in the youth movement, particularly in the Kaba-
taang Makabayan, which he headed. 
? Sison, the son of a large landowner in the Ilocos region of northern 
Luzon, proved to be inordinately self-centered, with an overweening 
desire to be the leader of everything on the Left. He became simul-
taneously the chief editor of Progressive Review, the head of the 
Kabataang Makabayan, the general secretary of the Movement for 
the Advancement of Nationalism (a broad movement with support of 
intellectuals, middle-class groups and nationalist businessmen), a 
vice-chairman of a small Socialist Party started in 1967 by trade union-
ists, and strove hard to win command of the PKP itself. More perti-
nently, he had been imbued with a Maoist outlook from his contacts 
abroad, and the deliberation with which he worked toward swinging 
the PKP to a Maoist position eventually aroused suspicion that he 
had received his directives from outside the Philippines. 
This effort on the part of Sison became greatly intensified in 1966, 
coinciding with the outbreak of the "proletarian cultural revolution" 
in China. Sison, with a small faction of student Party members in the 
Kabataang Makabayan, conspired to pack a 1967 Party plenum with 
delegates under his influence so as to capture the central committee 
for a Maoist orientation. He made his main bid among peasant cadres 
in Central Luzon, the long-standing mass base area of the movement, 
.confident that he could win over peasants with the Maoist line of 
'surrounding the cities from the countryside" and similar emphasis on 
the role of the peasantry. Attempting also to promote a "youth versus 
the old" split in the Party, he insisted that old cadres should step 
aside for the young, i.e., Sison's faction in the KM. However, he suffer-
ed a profound shock when his .efforts were overwhelmingly repudiated. 
His isolation would have been so complete in the plenum that he an-
nounced his resignation from the Party before it met. The Party plen-
um denounced him for careerism, factionalism and intrigue, and 
expelled him from the PKP. 
Sison then attempted to use his leading posts to seize control of 
mass organizations. The Movement for the Advancement of National-
ism, of which he had become general secretary, swept him and his 
entire faction from leadiug positions. When, rebuffed as well by the 
large peasant union, Malayang Samahang Magsasaka (MASAKA.), he 
attempted to set up his own "MASAKA," angry peasants drove his 
henchmen out of the "founding convention" and dissolved it on the 
spot with a unanimously-supported resolution. 
In the case of another organization, the Bertrand Russell Peace

Foundation (which in the Philippines is a serious anti-imperialist

methods; he contacted a 'Filipino student friend in Belgium to cross 
to London and send a telegram falsely signed with the name of Bert-
rand Russel's secretary claiming that one of Sison's henchmen was 
the authorized BRPF head. This fradulept effort at forgery and de-
ception, comparable to CIA methods, was of course quickly exposed 
and Sison's Maoists were ousted from the organization. 
A Maoist attempt was made to gain a trade union base for itself, 
particularly by contacts with leaders of the National Association of 
Trade Unions, headed by Ignacio Lacsina, who is also chairman of the 
small Socialist Party, Sison hoping to exploit his link with that body. 
In due course, the National Association of Trade Unions and the 
-Socialist Party also repudiated and denounced Sison. 
In other words, the main significant mass organizations in the 
Philippines, representing in particular the advanced organized peas-
ants and workers, decisively rejected the Maoist line and its advocates. 
The only foothold left to Sison was in the Kabataang Makabayan, 
which he had always tried to use as his personal property instead of 
as the collective movement built by many hands that it was. How-
ever, the continuous statements made in the KM's name by Sison had 
caused it to become identified with an irresponsible ultra-Leftist line. 
Consequently', responsible youth of the Left established a new youth 
movement, the Malayang Pagkakaisa ng Kabataan Pilipino, or MPKP 
(Free Union of Filipino Youth). The great majority of members and 
chapters of the old KM (including all those in Central Luzon, its main 
base), left that organization and joined the MPKP, which had its 
launching on November 30, 1967. 
A number of student KM chapters remained under Sison's control, 
but these, too, split in 1968, those who departed forming a new group, 
the Samahang Demokratikong Kabataan, or SDK (League of Demo-
cratic Youth). Its leaders issued a statement attacking the one-man 
rule of Sison, his careerism, his cowardice for running away from 
demonstrations attacked by police, and his plagiarism of writings of 
others, passed off as his own. In 1969 the KM and the SDK patched 
up their differences to the extent of agreeing on a Maoist outlook and 
on joint actions, but the SDK, distrustful of Sison, retains its own 
identity. 
The nature of the split engendered by Sison in the Philippine Left 
is best illustrated by the contrasting composition of the MPKP and 
the KM. At the second National Congress of the MPKP, held on 
January 25, 1970, there were 800 delegates, 80 per cent of whom were 
workers and peasants, the rest being students, professionals and un-
employed. At the third congress of the KM, December 12-13, 1970, 
in contrast, there were 300 delegates, 90 per cent of whom were 
students. 
The Maoists, Peking, and the CIA 
Following his expulsion from the PKP, Sison went to China for a 
prolonged stay, during which he was received by Mao Tse-tung. On 
his return, with the obvious encouragement of his erstwhile hosts, he 
undertook strenuous efforts to set up his own party. At first he at-
tempted to bring together former PKP members expelled for Right 
opportunism in the past, but they would not accept his demand that 
they be organized under his sole leadership. Finally, he had to fall 
back on his group of students, less than a dozen of whom had follow-
ed him out of the PKP, and whom he appointed as a "central corn-

and reestablished" Communist Party of the Philippines, N ao se-tung 
Thought, setting -himself up as its chairman under the name of 
"Arnado Guerrero." The manifestos and statements of the "CPP-Mao 
Thought" promptly were published and circulated by the Peking 
Hsinhua News. 
In March 1969 the Sison group took the further step of announcing 
the formation of a "New People's Army," to serve as the military arm 
of the "CPP-Mao Thought," and proclaimed the beginnings of "armed 
revolution," for the seizure of power. 
Both before and after setting up the "CPP-Mao Thought," Sison-
"Amado Guerrero" has carried on the most vicious campaign of slan-
der against the PKP and those he associates with it. In doing so, he 
and his petty-bourgeois clique have violated in an informer-provoca-
teur manner all the principles of an underground movement, bringing 
out into the open policies, activities and personalities, asserted by 
the Sison group to be identified with the PKP. This has been done in 
public leaflets, public statements sent to the press, articles published 
in the bourgeois press, and speeches to mass meetings, all of which 
have provided the imperialist intelligence agencies with a wealth of 
information about the underground. Together with this has been the 
publication and circulation of the foulest lies concerning the morals 
and the integrity of those who refused to come under the Maoist 
thumb. 
In its attacks on the PKP the Sison group has resorted not to serious 
polemics but to the most brazen and irresponsible use of name-calling 
and of inflammatory phrases, the whole gamut of malicious invective 
that the Maoists have invented in place of rational argument: "re-
visionist renegade," "imperialist tools," "black bourgeois gang," "count-
er-revolutionary lickspittle," "running dogs,' "subservient capitalist 
lackey," none of which is defined, explained or linked with specific 
acts. KM students use these and other derogatory epithets, Red Guard 
style, in juvenile chants during demonstrations. Sison chose to focus 
his- attacks on the past leaders of the PKP, Jose and Jesiis Lava, whom 
the imperialists and neo-colonialists had imprisoned with life sentences 
for their dedication to the cause of the Philippine revolution, and all 
PKP members and supporters or sympathizers thus were branded 
"Lava revisionists." (One of the main CIA-Philippine Army tactics 
among political prisoners was to try to split rank-and-file members 
from the Lavas.) Grossly lying accounts of the PKP's history, of its 
leadership of the HMR, and of its present position have been ped-
dled, giving the most grotesque and untruthful versions of its 
struggles. 
The confusion created by this type of disruption, particularly 
among young Filipinos without previous experience of organization 
and struggle, has been much augmented by two factors: 1) the bour-
geois press has eagerly printed every statement, document or article 
produced by the Maoists, who have been afforded the maximum 
'means of publicizing their line and their attacks on the PKP; and 
2) the PKP, seeking to promote unity of the Left and to minimize 
harmful polemics, while correctly preserving proper security safe-
guards of an illegal organization, tried for as long as possible not to 
be drawn into retaliatory replies. 
In observing the freedom given to Maoist activity and propaganda 
by the Philippine government and its imperialist mentors, the re-
minder must be made that the PKP and "all similar organizations" 
are outlawed under the 1957 Anti-Subversion Law that provides up 
to the death penalty for leading cadres. Yet the Maoist KM and SDK, 
advocating the line of Sison's "party" for immediate armed struggle,

have been allowed to have a -radio _program on a Maniln station 
AP Provulvfsreg$L44?gd2Oplig3A4_iiiciAaapoofcmciptiqoacmoi 0001-5 
to have control of the student paper and to use it constantly as a 
Maoist platform, have their spokesmen on the editorial board of one 
of the leading bourgeois magazines which regularly projects and 
adulates the Maoist groups, and have been helped through reprinting 
to gain the widest audience for the "CPP-Mao Thought" organ, Ang 
Bayan. 
American news services, following the established policy of giving 
the maximum attention to "New Left" radicalism, have continually 
played up the KM, the Sison "reorganized party" and its "New 
People's Army" as if they constitute the only Left and revolutionary 
movement in the Philippines. (On the other hand, demonstrations by 
the MPKP, the MASAKA and other organizations, even when many 
times larger than those called by the KM, as well as their statements, 
are most often deliberately ignored or given scant attention in the 
press.) 
Significantly, this treatment is paralleled by the constant publicity 
given the Maoist group by the New China News Agency (Minima 
News). Hsinhua News hailed the creation of the "rebuilt Communist 
Party of the Philippines" and its "New People's Army," continually 
prints highly exaggerated reports of their activities and of the "raging 
flames of armed struggle" in which "with guns in hand, the Philippine 
people led by the party have brought about an excellent revolutionary 
situation," a statement so far from fact as to be absurd. From China, 
radio broadcasts of this type, and denunciations of the 'revisionist 
renegades," are constantly beamed into the Philippines in the Philip-
-pine languages. By both the Filipino Maoists and their Peking backers 
it is underscored that the Sison "party" has the support of the Mao-
Tse-tung grouping. This interference in the internal affairs of the 
Philippine people and of their revolutionary movement stands in 
contrast to the pious efforts of the Peking leadership to pose as the 
protector of small countries against "superpowers." 
In 1971 the Chinese Maoist publishing house in Hong Kong, Ta 
Kung Pao, published and has sought to give distribution interna-
tionally as well as in the Philippines to a book ostensibly by "Amado 
Guerrero" (Sison), Philippine Society and Revolution, which pro-
claims the author as "chairman of the central committee of the Corn-
munit Party of the Philippines," and which grossly distorts the his-
tory, the composition, and the strategy and tactics of the revolutionary 
movement in the Philippines. 
Philippine Society and Revolution is a crudely mechanical appli-
cation of Maoist doctrine to the Philippine situation. Proclaiming 
that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," it advocates 
immediate and protracted armed struggle based on the strategy of 
surrounding the cities from the countryside, gives the main emphasis 
to the peasantry as the point of concentration for the revolution, as-
serts that the petty bourgeoisie is "a reliable ally of the working 
class" and that the middle peasants are "a reliable ally of the prole-
tariat," and assigns to petty-bourgeois student youth a special role 
"to link the masses throughout the archipelago." It directs the most 
virulent slander against the PKP which it calls "revisionist renegades" 
who allegedly collaborate with imperialism and neo-colonialism and 
"insist that the struggle be limited to parliamentary struggle." It 
attacks the Soviet Union and other socialist countries as "social-im-
perialists" with which the Philippines should have no relations ("it is 
all a lie that Soviet social-imperialism can extend support to the 
nation"). It urges relations only with "fraternal parties, with revolu-
tionary movements and with socialist countries like the People's Re-
public of China and the People's Republic of Albania." t

and enabled to circulate such ideas by such varied channels of east-
west publicity reveals some curious features. An astonishing number 
of KM-SDK leaders, including chairmen and top council members, 
are the sons and daughters of well-to-do families. One of them is the 
son of an executive of the American oil company, Caltex. Far more 
.interesting is the number with close relatives in Philippine intelli-
gence agencies. The chairman of the KM in 1970-71 has an uncle in 
the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA), the Philip-
pine equivalent of the CIA that has four CIA liaison officers of its 
staff; this uncle's son is also a KM member. The chairman of the 
SDK is the son of the head of the Philippine Army's Judge Advocate 
General's Office (JAGO) in the 1950s, who prosecuted innumerable 
I-1MB and PKP members. The father of another KM leader was the 
chief of the 'Military Intelligence Service (MIS) in the 1950s, the 
most ruthless enemy of the Huk movement. Another top KM leader's 
father is an agent of the National Bureau of Investigation, Philippine 
equivalent of the FBI, and his uncle is a presidential agent of Presi-
dent Marcos. Sison's own brother is an NBI agent. (The organ of 
the Free Union of Filipino Youth (the N1PKP) Struggle, Vol. III, 
No. 1, January 1971, gives the names of these and other Maoists with 
such family associations.) 
In 1970 a woman member of the Kabataang Makabayan's national 
council, appointed by Sison, revealed herself as a member of the 
women's unit in the Philippine Army, assigned .to the KM as an infil-
trator; she testified in court against arrested youth militants. In mid-
1971 the second in command of the "New People's Army," a Com-
mander Melody (Benjamin Bie), one of those appointed by Sison to 
be a member of the "central committee" of his "party," turned out 
to be an agent of the Philippine Army intelligence. He was used as 
a witness to expose the Sison?"New People's Army" link with land-
lord-politicians and other wealthy anti-Marcos figures, and to prose-
cute peasants recruited into the NPA and captured by the army. In 
August 1971 President Marcos publicly boasted that the Maoist 
movement had been infiltrated at all levels by government agents: 
Ignacio Lacsina, president of the National 'Association of Trade 
Unions, who was courted by the Maoists and then attacked by them 
as a "traitor" and a "renegade" when be attended conferences of the 
World Federation of Trade Unions, had this to say in a speech on 
Labor Day (May 1) 1971: 
When we were still in constant company with activists, we used 
to be dragged about by the KM to join forces with them in their 
use of violence and provocations in demonstrations. They also 
would enjoin us to shout with them revolutionary slogans. But we 
know that if we shout even half of what is expected by the CIA 
agents that have infiltrated KM, these elements would destroy in 
one day the whole NATU. When we could not be intimidated by 
the KM, we suddenly became ourselves the target of their attack. 
They called us a fake federation and me a fake labor leader, a 
revisionist reactionary, and similar names. What the CIA would 
like to do now, having been frustrated in their first plan, is to 
destroy us in the eyes of the working class and .in so doing they 
expect us to be deserted by our comrades and members.

dent Magsaysay (serving as Presi-
dential Complaints and Action 
Commissioner directly .under the 
President)" San Juan went on to 
a political career and is how 'a 
congressman-from Rizal province. 
Lansdale praised the almost un-
tapped potential of Eastern Con-
struction for unconventional war-
fare "which was its original mis-
sion.". He wrote that "this cadre 
can be expanded into a wide 
range cf. counter-Communist acti-
vities. having sufficient stature 
in the Philippines to be -able to 
draw on a very large segment of 
jts trained, experienced and well-
motive ted manpower pool." After 
a few years, "It now furnishes 
about 500 'trained, experienced 
Filipino technicians to the Gov-
ernments of Vietnam and Laos, 
under the auspices of MAAG 
(MAP) and US0?,1 (ICA) activi-
ties." 
MAAG are the iaitials for Mili-
tary Assistance Advisory Group, 
and MAP for Military Assistance 
Program in Vietnam; USOM 
stands for United States Opera-
tion Mission, and ICA for Interna-
tional Cooperation Administration. 
The Freedom-Eastern Construe-
lion outfit was also assigned- the 
? task of running a- training camp 
for anti-Communist Vietnamese 
para-military units in a hidden 
valley on the Clark Air Base re-
servation in the Philippines. 
In addition the Magsaysay gov-
ernment agreed to operate. a psy-
chological warfare counter-guer-
rilla school called the Security 
Training Center, located at Fort 
McKinley pa the rim of Manila. 
This, as the Pentagon Papers 
mentions, was secretly sponsored 
and financed by the CIA. This 
trained "anti-subversion" person-
nel for all of Southeast Asia. 
Another Filipino-linked scheme 
One of the main reports in the 
Papers is that by Brig. Gen. Ed-
ward G. Lansdale, in which he 
discusses in detail the actions 
taken by the CIA from before the 
Geneva Agreement of 1954 on-
ward to promote suppressive 
ounter-guerrilla warfare in Viet-
nam and Laos and to build up 
Ngo Dinh Diem as the American 
instrument to frustrate the Agree-
.ment. Lansdale was well-known 
before that in the Philippines, 
since he was the ,CIA agent who 
masterminded many aspects of the 
anti- Iluk suppression campaign in 
ti, country and who groomed 
Ramon Magsaysay for the presi-
dency- and ran his election cam-
paign. ? 
In a number of the actions de-
-tailed by Lansdale in his report 
F'illipinos Who were -part of the 
Magsaysay -apparatus and with 
whom Lansdale had worked in 
the Philippines played a leading 
part. Magsaysay himself as hoaor-
ary president,. backed the setting 
up of an outfit initially called 
the Freedom Company, "a non-
profit Philippine corporation," 
which had the assignment of re-
cruiting Filipinos who had parti-
cipated in the anti-Huk suppres-
sion for similar set-Vice in Viet: 
Dam and Laos. ? 
After Freedom Company was or-
ganized in November 1954, it was 
apparently felt that its -name did 
not sufficiently disguise its oper-
-ations, so it was changed to East-
ern Construclipn Company. (The 
CIA has created a maze of such 
"corporations" around the world, 
:through which its espionage and 
subversive activities are carried 
on.)

tion is Frisco 'Johnny' San Juan,

aa?

administration in aiding the 
was the so-called Operation Bro-
therhood, which came about fol-
lowing a visit in W54 tosee Lans-
dale in Saigon by Oscar Arellano, 
a Filipino close to Magsaysay who 
was then vice president for Asia 
of the International Junior Cham-
ber of Commerce (Jaycees). Arel-
lano came away from this visit 
to advocate the setting up of Opea 
ratioa. Brotherhood, which was 
played up in the Philippines at 
the time as a semi-religious al-
truistic medical mission. ? 
However, as Lansdale explains 
it, it was "capable of consider-
able eXpansion in socio-economic 
medical operations' to support 
counter-guerrilla actions," and he 
says that. "Washington responded 
warmly to the idea." According 
to Lansdale, the Saigon Military 
Mission that he then headed 
would "monitor the operation 
quietly in the background" and 
that "it has a measure of CIA 
control." ? . 
Oscar Arellano,. following the 
publication of the Pentagon Paprs 
issued a defensive statement 
claiming that "OB has always 
been a presidential program since 
the administration of President 
Magsaysay. OB's mission is the 
propagation of the conviction that 
all men are brothers, created by 
a Supreme 'Divinity to whom He 
gave His image and likeness and 
imbued with His spirit." 
A third Filipino operation was 
headed by Col. Napoleon Valeria-
no, who was given the job of 
training - a Presidential Guard 
Battalion for- Ngo Dinh. Diem, 
after having done the same for 
Magsaysay. Valerian? was select-
'ed, says Lansdale., for his "fine 
record against the Communist 
Huks." In the Philippines, Vale-
rian? had commanded the most 
brutal and notorious of all anti-
Huk units, called the "Skull Unit."

ttempt Even more serious danger is 
radual Viet,Cong extension of control

innist progress continues, would mean

'hese two dangers are related because

, Despite the evident exaggeration in Marcos' de-

pluralism within the ruling groups, such that no faction 
(army, sugar bloc, etc.) has been able thus far to monop-
olize effective political power. The two. parties, the ruling 
Nacionalistas and the opposition Liberals, are loose coali-

He is Len Yarborough, who 
has been accused of being a

is Philippine Secretary of Labor 
Bias F. Ople, described as a.

Yarborough run out of the

"WE HAVE given about 700

Ople of seeking to corrupt labor 
department officials and cause

Ople sought to shut down the 
8427,000 program operated by' 
Yarborough. 
THE LABOR secretary went 
further by demanding that Pres-

persona non grata, which would 
have resulted in his expulsion 
from the islands: 
But at least one Filipino took 
a dim view of Ople and his ac-
tions against the AAFLI by 
writing in the Philippine Her-
ald, a prominent newspaper, 
"that the labor secretary was 
not exactly telling the truth." 
"The fact is," Emil Jurado
