 THE SOVIET WORLD
 In the first Soviet reaction to the recent Western foreign
 ministers' communique, Pravda on 25 October ignored the specif-
 ic points, on the German austrian treaties and Trieste,
 Except for the Korean political conference, recent Soviet prop-
 aganda has been notably reticent on issues subject to negotia-
 tions, has ridiculed the idea of a European security system,
 and has de-emphasized its theme of "peace through negotiation."
 Thus, the recent attacks on Churchill's Margate speech con-
 trast with the favorable comment following his 11 May address
 and suggest a Soviet desire to discourage an invitation for
 top-level talks.
 The slogans for the November anniversary of the Bolshevik
 revolution are for the most part similar to those issued for
 the last May Day celebration.   In line with internal policy,
 both agriculture and consumer goods received increased emphasis.
 The omission of a slogan on the inviolability of the people's
 rights, which appeared last May Day,  is perhaps significant
 This theme was first mentioned by Beria in his speech at
 Stalin's funeral and its general disappearance from Soviet
 propaganda since his fall suggests the Kremlin may not under-
 take its promised revision of the criminal code.
 The unusually intensive propaganda coverage of the Third
 Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, concluded in
 Vienna on 21 October, emphasizes the important current role
 of the Communist trade unions,.   A plan for low-level "action
 unity" tactics with non-Communist labor, coupled with an econom-
 ic program of a noncontroversial nature, was presented to the
 congress as the best way of becoming "politically popular and
 nationally unassailable."  The gathering echoed'the 19th Moscow
 Party Congress directive to take a patriotic position, but
 ordered that local labor struggles be given an international
 twist at the appropriate time,
 Avnrehension over the isolated position of Communist labor
 was evident in the unprecedented efforts to attract non-Communist
 delerates and in the urgent appeals for unity.   On the other
 hand, WFTU leadership optimistically anticipated an economic
 crisis in the West, and hopefully envisaged a "wave of strikes"
 in capitalist countries following the French and Italian pattern.
 While the large delegations from colonial and under-
 developed countries reflected the growing importance of trade
 union activity in these areas,  the top WFTU executive posts re-
 mained under the firm control of Western Europeans.   In the
 closing resolutions of the congress, the European problem of
 EDC and a resurgent Germany received the greatest attention,

 PROBABLE IMPACT OF THE CONSUMER GOODS
 PROGRAM ON THE SOVIET ECONOMY
 The new Soviet program to benefit the consumer and the
 farmer will temporarily aggravate the problem of suppressed
 inflation in the Soviet economy and,  if fully implemented,
 will necessitate selective reductions in the production of
 some types of defense and heavy industrial equipment through
 1955.   According to present indications, however, the maximum
 effort to expand the output of consumer goods will be limited
 to the next two years with a reduction in emphasis on consumer
 goods in 1956.
 In the past, although proclaiming their interest in the
 welfare of the consumer, Soviet leaders had neither sacrificed
 the rapid growth of heavy industry nor amended Five-Year Plans
 in order to improve the living standards.   The present regime,
 however, has already taken steps requiring modifications in
 the plan for'1953.   In his 8 August speech to the Supreme Soviet
 Malenkov announced a supplement of 32 billion rubles to the
 original plan for consumer goods turnover, and on 17 October
 Mikoyan announced a further five billion ruble increase,
 These figures would require an expansion of turnover by about
 20 percent above the estimated 1952 level as compared to the
 11 percent annual expansion called for in the current Five-
 Year Plan,
 Although the supply of consumer goods may be increased
 through imports and withdrawals from reserves, most of the
 additional goods must be produced within the Soviet Union.
 Production can be expanded by creating new capacity for
 light industry, by diverting existing heavy industrial cap-
 acity to the production of consumer goods, or by utilizing,
 more effectively the existing capacity of light industry.
 None of these courses of action can, be expected to yield
 results this year in the form of large quantities of finished
 products, but the first two will require resources previously
 earmarked for defense and heavy industry.

 The government has increased significantly the amount of
 disposable income in the hands of the consumer.  Measures
 already taken will result in an increase over the preceding
 year of 75 to 80 billion rubles of consumer buying power in
 the last three quarters of 1953 and the first quarter of 19540
 These have included reductions in the state loan and in taxes
 on the population, raising the disposable income of consumers
 by approximately 21 billion rubles, increased payments to
 farmers of approximately seven billion rubles, and price re-
 ductions calculated to save the consumer a total of 46 billion
 rubles. Roughly, four.billion rubles in additional incomes will
 also be generated from the growth of the labor force during
 this period.
 The originally scheduled increase in the output of con-
 sumer goods will probably increase the supply of goods by
 35 to 40 billion rubles.   Therefore,  in order to satisfy fully
 the increase in consumer demand of 75 to 80 billion rubles, the
 increase of 37 billion rubles in consumer goods turnover above
 the level of the plan must be completely fulfilled.  Mikoyan
 has already stated, however,  that the original 1953 plan is
 behind schedule.   Thus, the economy's problem of suppressed
 inflation will be aggravated.  Anticipating increased consumer
 goods production in 1954 and 1955, however, the government will
 probably choose to tolerate this limited rise in inflationary
 pressure.
 If the agriculture program is also accelerated in 1954 and
 1955, as officially stated, the impact on defense and heavy
 industry will be even more pronounced.  Khrushchev has promised
 that the government in 1954 will spend 35 billion rubles more
 than the amount provided in the Five-Year Plan for agriculture,
 compared to above-plan expenditures of 15 billion rubles this
 year.   According to his figures,  the allowance for mechaniza-
 tion in the above-plan expenditures; on agriculture will be more
 than seven times greater in 1954 than in 1953.   To meet the
 1953 targets, the machine building, chemical, electric power,
 transport, and construction industries have all been directed
 to step up sharply their support for agriculture.  Resources
 from 12 ministries in all have been earmarked on an emergency
 basis for the agricultural program.
 As indicated in the decree of 23 October concerning the
 expansion of retail sales,  light industry's demands on Soviet
 industrial resources will also be intensified.   The Council of
 Ministers has instructed eight heavy industrial ministries,
 including the defense and aircraft industries,  to establish
 independent departments for the production of consumer items.

 25X1
 The new goals for the turnover of             consumer goods require that
 the Five-Year Plan be surpassed in 1954 and that the pace of
 expansion be sustained through 1955 and cut back in 1956.
 In implementing the new consumer goods program, Soviet
 planners have outlined a four-fold task for the economy of
 the USSR: expansion of investment in agriculture, expansion
 of investment in light industry, a reallocation of heavy
 industrial capacity to support both agriculture and light
 industry, and a considerable expansion of the distribution and
 merchandizing systems.
 Not only are the resources required for the fulfillment
 of these tasks in excess of those normally made available from
 the growth of the national income, but these new demands are
 being placed on the national economy at a time when its growth
 is likely to proceed at a slower rate,  The Soviet planners
 have already expressed concern over falling productivity in the
 first half of 1953.   Moreover, they government has announced its
 intention to check the  usual' migr,~tion.: of labor from
 agriculture to industry which in the past has accounted for a,.
 large portion of the growth of industrial output.
 Although the normal growth of the economy could provide
 resources for one of the newly assigned tasks, the accomplish-
 ment of all four simultaneously will require selective reduction
 in the output of heavy industrial and defense equipment,

 IRANIAN PRIME MINISTER FACES INCREASING OPPOSITION
 25X1
 After two months in office,  Prime Minister Zahedi is meeting
 more active and better-organized opposition, but there is still
 no evidence of a concerted drive to overthrow him.   The failure
 of the government to implement its announced program contributes
 to the popular discontent.
 The Tudeh, although crippled by Zahedi's drive against it,
 is attempting to rally those groups which want to return former   25X1
 prime minister Mossadeq to power.   Sabotage in the air force a
 th
 e nav  are credited to the party,                               25X1
 The   u e   asserts that o er     -Rios s a eq
 are ready  o   in it in a united f:r?ont, and limited cooperation
 probably takes place for specific operations.
 The 8 October strike which closed the bazaar for the day was
 probably a joint operation of the '.Tudeh and the non-Communist
 Bazaar Committee.  The latter,  composed of prominent pro-Mossadeq
 merchants, is continuing its agitation which reportedly is to in-
 clude strikes, distribution of hand bills, bribery, and even
 assassination of Zahedi supporters.
 Other groups participate from time to time in joint activi-
 ties in support of Mossadeq.   The National Restoration Movement,
 composed of former Majlis deputies who supported him,  is alleged-
 ly interested solely in saving the former prime minister's life.
 The small right-wing Pan-Iran Party has also come out in support
 of Mossadeq and apparently can supply street gangs for strong-
 arm tactics.
 Most of these groups have in common only the desire to see
 Mossadeq restored to power.   Cooperation between them has so far
 been temporary and opportunistic.
 Zahedi's main opposition from non-Mossadeq sources appears
 to come from the politically ambitious Dr. Mozaffar Baghai,
 Majlis deputy and leader of the inactive Workers Party.   Iranian
 army chief of staff Batmangelitch and his two deputy chiefs are
 Baghai supporters and are allegedly involved in intrigues aimed
 at discrediting the Tehran military governor, the police chief,
 and the gendarmerie commandant, all of whom are loyal to Zahedi.
 Batmangelitch has expressed the opinion that Iran's real
 hope lies in a coalition of Zahedi and Baghai.   Baghai has not
 yet publicly opposed Zahedi,  although he is reported to be seri-
 ously thinking of an open break.   He has sharply criticized many
 of Zahedi's policies and warned that any oil settlement with the

 25X1
 British must adhere strictly to the 1951 nine-point nationaliza-
 tion law.   Zahedi believes himself competent to control any        25X1
 threat from this quarter.
 The prime minister, aware of his opposition, is hampered by
 the lack of an effective political organization.   The Tehran mili-
 tary governor, leading an attempt to organize pro-Zahedi forces,
 has reportedly received the support: of a large group of second-
 rank bazaar leaders who are organized as the Bazaar Club.
 Zahedi also is handicapped by the support which the shah
 gives Batmangelitch.   The monarch, assuming control of army
 appointments and promotions, has resisted attempts by Zahedi to
 get rid of the chief of staff.   Future attempts along this line
 will probably also be opposed by the shah and will further strain
 relations between the two men, though a complete break is unlikely.
 Zahedi's political position is weakened by delay in carrying
 out his announced program.   The frequent postponement of Mossa-
 deq's trial has brought criticism from many quarters and Zahedi
 has charged angrily that Batmangelitch is deliberately delaying
 the trial to discredit the government.
 Iran's serious currency shortage and its slowness in plan-
 ning the effective utilization of the $45,000,000 emergency aid
 from the United States has made it impossible to implement the
 job-creating construction programs which the prime minister had
 promised.   Similarly,  Zahedi's lack of progress in settling the
 oil problem has produced increasing criticism.   He is also handi-
 capped by a lack of knowledge of the oil problem and by a reali-
 zation that any negotiations with the British will lay him open
 to attack by ultranationalists.
 The absence of a legal Majlis further obstructs the govern-
 ment.   Zahedi has delayed dissolving the rump Majlis, apparently
 because the action will be opposed by the deputies still in
 office, although they do not constitute a quorum.
 Although there is as yet no one sufficiently strong to try
 to replace Zahedi,  his weakness makes it progressively more
 difficult to accomplish any of the reforms which are necessary
 if he is to stay in power and is an :invitation to aspirants for
 his post.   The collapse of his government would probably bring
 into power a regime which,  if not pro-Communist, would be likely
 to try to follow a policy of anti-Western neutrality.

 RECENT AGREEMENTS ENHANCE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S POSITION
 The recent conclusion of defense agreements with the
 United States, coming shortly after the signing of a concordat
 with the Vatican, has helped to advance Spain's position
 abroad and has strengthened the Franco regime at home.
 Franco's proclamation of the agreements with the United States
 as "the greatest triumph of our contemporary foreign policy"
 leaves no doubt of the high importance which he attaches to
 them.
 In so far as the pact will modernize and improve the
 Spanish armed forces,-it will help strengthen still further
 Franco's hold on the country.   The economic aid, which is
 scheduled to reach $465 million, in addition to military
 construction projects presently estimated at $400 million, is
 expected to have a similar political effect.  Signature of
 the agreements dealt   a demoralizing blow to the opposition,
 which had constantly maintained that the regime's authori-
 tarian nature was preventing Spain from being accepted inter-
 nationally and from obtaining military and economic aid.
 Internationally, Spain's prestige has been enhanced by
 the favorable reception of the agreements, particularly in
 Portugal and Latin America. Franco is exploiting them widely
 for propaganda    purposes, carefully pointing out, however,
 that they in no way compromise Spain's integrity, sovereignty,
 and national independence.
 In the Western European democracies there are still
 political objections to the American-Spanish agreements,
 particularly in left-wing circles.   Franco now seems little
 concerned, however, by Western European opposition, evidently
 preferring his bilateral arrangements with the United States
 and Portugal, for the time being, to NATO membership.
 Second only to the pacts with the United States in
 strengthening Franco's position is the concordat with the
 Vatican which formally came into effect on 27 October.   This
 essentially formalizes and regularizes previous agreements
 and confirms de facto church-state relations and the con-
 cessions  gained by the church under the present regime.

 Liberal Catholic elements had contended that past Vatican
 reluctance to negotiate a concordat reflected the Holy See's
 displeasure at the excesses of the regime, while anti-Franco
 monarchists had maintained that the Vatican regarded the
 Franco government as a provisional one and would sign no
 concordat until the monarchy was restored.   Internationally,
 as well, the concordat will serve to raise the government's
 prestige, particularly among Latin American and other strongly
 Catholic nations.
 Strengthened by these two international achievements,
 Franco is now exerting pressure for concessions from France.
 He reportedly has postponed recognition of the new sultan of
 Morocco in order to obtain territorial compensation in the
 form of an enlargement of the Spanish Moroccan protectorate.
 At the same time he is increasing his efforts to solidify
 relations with the Arab world and to realize the long-coveted
 aim to establish Spain as the link between the Arab and the
 Latin American world.   In mid-October, for  example, Spanish
 foreign minister Artajo entertained the assistant secretary
 general of the Arab League in Madrid for a week, during which
 the latter urged Spain to issue a strong note condemning
 Israel's recent actions and to join with the Latin American
 nations in economic sanctions which might be undertaken.

 PROSPECTS FOR A PURGE OF THE CHINESE
 COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP
 There are fragmentary indications that the current purge of
 the Chinese Communist Party may be extending into its high com-
 mand.   Several central committee members may be out of favor with
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung and may be removed from power.   Mao's past
 practice suggests that he is more 'Likely to remove such persons
 quietly than he is to stage a public spectacle.
 In mid-1951 the Chinese Communist Party publicly launched a
 "reorganization," scheduled to end in 1954, which has led to the
 expulsion of about ten percent of the members thus far examined.
 The stature of several members of the party's central committee
 below the politburo level also appeared to decline, particularly
 in 1953.   This has been suggested by official denunciation of
 their onetime policies,  their loss of important positions,  their
 repeated absences from functions they would normally be expected
 to attend, and a prolonged lack of references to them in the
 official press.
 Among the various plausible reasons for a decline of these
 persons are past or current opposition to Mao Tse-tung's policies,
 personality clashes,  incompetence and illness.   There is no good
 evidence to support speculation that they have fallen from favor
 as a result of either excessive Soviet support of or opposition
 to them.
 Although Mao was ruthless in eliminating opposition during
 his rise to power, he has shown no taste in recent years for the
 violent public purges which have characterized other Communist
 parties.  Since 1935 when by official account his "leading
 position" was established, he has expelled only one top-ranking
 party leader.   He has chosen instead to deal with opposition
 elements and other leaders in his disfavor by reducing them in
 stature within the party structure.
 The Chinese Communist Party's central committee is elected
 by the party's national congress, which is supposed to meet
 every three years but in fact has not met since 1945.   The
 completion next summer of the "reorganization" among the party
 rank and file may seem to Mao a good occasion for convening it.
 Although he might take public action against central committee
 members before that time, a new election would provide Mao with
 the means of formalizing their quiet removal from positions of
 power.

 SPECIAL ARTICLE
 SOVIET SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MANPOWER
 The USSR is training a body of scientists and technicians
 which is increasing in size and quality and approaching com-
 parability with that of the United States.   If present trends
 continue, the total capabilities of Soviet scientific and
 technical manpower may exceed those of the United States in the
 near future.
 The Soviet leaders have consistently regarded science
 .and technology as the key to the attainment of their national
 economic and military goals and have developed nationwide
 programs for scientific and cultural education which have
 mobilized large human and material resources.
 The vitality of the Soviet program of higher education
 is apparent in the growth in the number of institutions and
 students.   Since the revolution, -these have grown from 91
 higher educational institutions with 112,000 students in 1918
 to about 900 institutions with some 1,100,000 full-time and
 400,000 extension-course students at present.   During this same
 period, the United States doubled the number of its institutions
 to 1,800, and increased the students fivefold to about 2,300,000.
 The proportion of Soviet graduates in scientific fields
 over the past 20 years has varied between 70 percent of total
 graduates each year and the current figure of about 44 percent,
 while the proportion for the United States has remained close
 to 30 percent.   (See chart #1, p.  17)
 Quantitative measures of Soviet scientific and technical
 manpower are provided by comparing the numbers in the USSR
 and the United States in the following two groups:
 a.           Graduates of higher educational institutions
 (colleges and universities) in scientific
 and technical fields.   This includes persons
 with "first professional" degrees such as the
 M.D. and the D.D.S.
 b.           Persons holding advanced degrees in scientific
 and technical fields: the Soviet Kandidat and the
 American Ph.D.   (including the Sc.  .  .   In terms
 of formal requirements the Kandidat is the near
 equivalent of the Ph.D.

 Approved For Release 2003/02/27 :      bIF79-00927A0   00220001'-8
 Both of these groups have been broken down into three major
 subject categories -- physical sciences, agricultural sciences,
 and health sciences,   (Chart #2 shows the'fields which these
 categories include.)*
 The comparisons in charts #3 and #4 indicate that, in
 general size and composition,  Soviet scientific. and technical
 manpower is basically similar to that of the United States.
 The USSR has comparable numbers of graduates of higher ed-
 ucational institutions and holders of advanced degrees in each
 of the three major subject. categories,
 In chart #5 a comparison of the number of persons grad-
 uating annually in scientific and technical fields in the USSR
 and the United States is made.   The number of Soviet graduates
 fell off in 1'933 due to a lengthening of the courses of study,
 and the rapid rise around 1935 was the consequence of expanded
 enrollments from 1930-32.   Both the Soviet and US curves show
 wartime losses and rapid postwar :increases, which reached a
 peak in the United States in 1950 because of the "GI Bill."
 Since that time, the trend has favored the Soviet Union, and
 present Soviet plans call for continuing increases in the
 number of graduates.
 The quality of Soviet scientific and technical manpower
 has been quite uneven.   The first decade and a half of the
 Soviet period saw a general decline in the quality of scien-
 tific education until by the early thirties, after the rapid
 expansion of the First Five-Year Plan, standards of research
 and education had fallen to low levels.   Beginning in 1933,
 however, Soviet leaders slowed the rate of increase in numbers
 of students entering scientific fields and enforced higher
 standards of work.
 Present indications are that improving educational stand-
 ards and increasing experience have raised the quality of Soviet
 scientific and technical personnel in most major fields to
 approach that of the United States,   Recent Soviet efforts in
 the theory and application of science demonstrate a high degree
 of competence.   Current graduates in science from higher ed-
 ucational institutions have completed about 15 years of in-
 tensive study with a generally far greater and more consistent
 emphasis on scientific subjects in secondary schools than is
 found in the United States.   In general, only more-gifted and
 industrious students have survived the stiff competition to
 enter higher schools, although nepotism and political activity
 can be important considerations.
 Unless other-wise apparent, the comparisons are for mid-1953.
 The estimates for the Soviet Union are believed accurate to
 within 10 percent.
