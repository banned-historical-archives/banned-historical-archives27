 China's New Group Armies:
 Adopting a Concept of
 Modern Warfare
 Key Judgments  Over the past decade, Beijing has moved decisively to prepare the People's
 Information available Liberation Army (PLA) for modern combat, acquiring selected advanced
 as of 1 June 1987 weapons technology, trimming the armed forces by at least 2 million, and
 was used in this report.
 promoting younger, combat-experienced officers to prominent positions in
 regional and national commands. Although modernization has touched all
 arms of the military, China's ground forces are undergoing the most
 sweeping reforms. China's 35 field armies have been consolidated into 24
 more powerful "group armies," creating the framework for a modern
 Army with greater mobility, firepower, and combined-arms integration.
 The amalgamation of firstline ground forces into group armies has not
 fundamentally altered the distribution of military strength along sensitive
 borders:
 ? Along the Sino-Soviet border, most combat troops from the four
 disbanded field armies were absorbed into 13 new, larger group armies.
 The group armies are still far from equal in fighting power to their Soviet
 counterparts, and we expect that group armies opposite the USSR will
 continue to have priority in receiving China's limited supply of modern
 weapons.
 ? Opposite Vietnam, seven field armies were reduced to four larger group
 armies. However, this reduction of some 40,000 combat troops is more
 than offset by the semiannual rotation to the Malipo battlefield of as
 many as 70,000 troops from other regions.
 ? Despite the elimination of one field army opposite Taiwan, China's
 combat capability has probably been only slightly reduced. One of the
 three remaining armies is the best equipped force in southern China, and
 now includes a fourth infantry division and new air defense, artillery, and
 tank brigades
 As a result of resource constraints and long-term defense priorities, we
 believe that China's military modernization program may result in the
 emergence of two distinct types of group armies in the next decade. Group
 armies deployed against Vietnam and Taiwan will probably remain
 infantry-heavy forces, and primary equipment improvements will probably

 consist of weapons best suited to supporting infantry operations. In
 contrast, group armies arrayed against the Soviet Union will become
 mechanized formations, and potentially offer a capability to project
 military power
 The amount of combat equipment and combined-arms integration of
 Chinese frontline units has improved, but even the most advanced group
 armies remain markedly inferior to their Soviet adversaries:
 ? For example, the Soviet 35th Army-deployed against China's Shenyang
 Military Region-has almost three times as many tanks, four times as
 many armored fighting vehicles, and almost twice as many artillery
 pieces as one of China's best equipped group armies.
 ? Soviet group armies in the Far East have an entire range of weapons un-
 available to Chinese units, including short-range FROG and medium-
 range Scud-B tactical missiles, mobile surface-to-air-missile batteries,
 and combat helicopters.
 Indeed, as its military strength grows, Beijing will need to avoid unduly in-
 creasing friction with Moscow that could lead to an arms race that China
 cannot win.
 Beijing's recognition of these equipment deficiencies, however, does not
 mean that China is ready to buy large quantities of military hardware from
 the West. Rather, Beijing is more likely for the next few years to seek criti-
 cal technologies from the West to "leapfrog" the weapons of the 1970s and
 1980s and to revamp its defense industries to build the "smart" weapons
 capable of meeting the anticipated Soviet threat of the 21st century. The
 Chinese have already proposed joint US-China development of a sophisti-
 cated antitank missile, and they have investigated coproducing the US
 Patriot advanced air defense system and relatively low-cost means of
 countering Soviet armor, such as the US Copperhead laser-guided artillery
 projectile
 Beijing is looking for assistance in developing its operations research
 capabilities, and it is currently as interested in the US management
 approach to military research and development as in hardware. Beijing's

 record on producing the appropriate weapon, in the right decade to meet
 the threat, is abysmal, and China's defense industry leaders are intent on
 correcting this shortcoming.
 To overcome the shortage of funds for weapons research and development,
 Beijing has increasingly sought "creative financing" arrangements in the
 West.
 the shorter term, the Chinese will increasingly seek Western assistance in
 areas that can make significant improvements to their group armies
 without substantial expenditures:
 ? Combat Doctrine and Operational Concepts. We believe Beijing intends
 to take full advantage of US and NATO experience in combined-arms
 operations and knowledge                      tics. Chinese military
 leaders have asked                            o lecture at the newly
 formed National De ense  rover-s y, an    inese strategic and doctrinal
 planners hosted a conference in Beijing with US Army combat operations
 experts in February.
 ? Combined-Armed Tactics. Beijing clearly recognizes the value of West-
 ern combined-arms experience, and greater exposure to Western war-
 fighting doctrine would probably improve Chinese combined-arms
 operations.
 ? Force Management. As its appreciation for the cost and complexity of
 ground force equipment grows, China will probably focus on Western
 logistics management techniques. Although Beijing probably does not
 perceive a need to copy Western force-sustainment methods, the PLA
 may adopt a more centralized, demand-driven logistics system to manage
 its most expensive weapon components.
 In some cases-to explore concepts requiring modern equipment-the
 Chinese General Staff will buy a few items of military hardware from the
 West. For example, in late March Beijing purchased eight French light
 attack helicopters to form an experimental Army aviation corps subordi-
 nate to a group army. This small purchase, however, will probably be the
 extent of light attack helicopter acquisitions from the West at least through
 the end of 1990.

 As expected in such a fundamental reorganization of military forces,
 Beijing's short-term problems are substantial. Nonetheless
 although difficulties are recognized, few PLA officers are
 questioning the efficacy of the reorganization. Emphasis in the near term
 will be on low-cost areas of force restructuring, training, development of
 operational art, and experimentation. Beijing's formation of the group
 armies is only the first step in a long process to produce a truly modern
 force capable of meeting any adversary, even the Soviet Union, in the 21st
 century.

 China's New Group Armies:
 Adopting a Conc
 Modern Warfar
 Stimulated by the markedly improved Soviet military
 threat opposite its northern border and by the prob-
 lems in coordination and communication that oc-
 curred during its 1979 war with Vietnam, Beijing
 during this past decade has moved decisively to
 prepare the People's Liberation Army (PLA) for
 modern combat. Military leaders have acquired se-
 lected advanced weapons and foreign weapons tech-
 nology, trimmed the armed forces by at least 2 million
 to the current level of 4-5 million, and promoted
 younger officers with combat experience to prominent
 positions in regional and national commands.__~
 Although modernization has touched all arms of the
 military, China's ground forces are undergoing the
 most sweeping reforms-structural changes that have
 eliminated field armies in favor of more powerful
 combined-arms armies. The transition to these group
 armies culminates a decadelong drive to break with
 the central tenet of the Maoist People's War strate-
 gy-trading land for time to mobilize China's huge
 population for guerrilla assaults on overextended ene-
 my forces
 Origins of the current reforms date from the Korean
 war, where massed Chinese infantry formations were
 often decimated by the overwhelming firepower of UN
 forces, and US air superiority wreaked havoc with
 tenuous Chinese supply lines. The organizational
 structure that had served the PLA well during its
 guerrilla and civil wars was not readily adaptable to
 the modern battlefield and conditions outside the
 Chinese mainland: foreign "masses" could not be
 mobilized to provide supplies or intelligence to Chi-
 nese combatants, and lightly armed infantry units
 ultimately could not beat artillery- and armor-heavy
 opponents.                                   25X1
 Realization of Beijing's inability to protect regional
 interests crystallized following the Vietnamese inva-
 sion of Cambodia in 1978, when the threat of China's
 military power was not sufficient to deter Hanoi from
 attacking a Chinese ally. China's invasion of northern
 Vietnam in 1979 failed to force Hanoi to withdraw
 from Cambodia and accomplished only limited mili-
 tary objectives at considerable economic and human
 cost. The invasion illustrated the inadequacies of
 PLA doctrine-Chinese field commanders failed to    25X1
 adequately synchronize the actions of combat ele-
 ments, and tactical flexibility was further constrained
 by a cumbersome command and control system.
 Combined-arms integration has become a central
 goal of the current reform movement.            25X1

 In May 1985, Central Military Commission Chair-
 man Deng Xiaoping announced the consolidation of
 all remaining field armies to combined-arms group
 armies.
 Transitional Problems
 As expected in such a fundamental reorganization of
 military forces, Beijing's short-term problems are
 substantial. The simple act of streamlining the force,
 for example, has led to severe problems in placing the
 several hundred thousand demobilized PLA officers
 in equivalent civilian posts and disgruntlement among
 many who believed that they were guaranteed lifelong
 careers in the armed forces.

 nized, few PLA officers are questioning the efficacy
 of the reorganization. Public speeches by China's
 highest military officials underscore that they believe
 the problems are solvable and that, in the long run,
 China's defense interests will be far better served by
 The most serious problem facing the group armies is
 that they lack sufficient quantities of modern military
 hardware:
 ? Only a few group armies have mechanized infantry
 formations, and many still lack sufficient trucks to
 move and support their soldiers on the battlefield.
 ? Group armies have only limited quantities of the
 shoulder-fired HN-5 (SA-7) air defense missile. The
 HN-5 provides only a close-in defense of four
 kilometers or less, and the organic air defense needs
 are still largely provided by visually aimed, towed
 antiaircraft pieces of World War II vintage.
 and has an obsolete warhead un-
 able to penetrate the armor of any tank more
 modern than the Soviet T-62.

 These and other equipment shortfalls, particularly in
 the combat support area, are unlikely to be remedied
 soon, for China's military budget is severely restricted

 Moreover, the restructuring has been tremendously
 disruptive-Chinese military publications indicate
 that some infantry divisions were converted en masse
 to artillery and antiaircraft brigades-forcing the
 retraining of large numbers of officers and senior
 enlisted personnel. The massive reorganization has
 also disrupted traditional command relationships-
 Two other notable problems are the result of a
 tradition of regional orientation. Although nominally
 national forces, China's group armies remain closely
 associated with individual military regions,
 Officers, for example, are trained at mili-
 25X1          tary region academies and usually spend entire ca-
 reers serving in a single group army or military
 China's traditional emphasis on regional defenses and
 self-reliant combat troops has produced a logistic
 system poorly suited for movement of forces national-
 ly. The PLA logistic system is designed to ensure that
 ground forces can operate independently even if cut
 off from Beijing, and to minimize the burden on the
 civilian economy by making the PLA as self-sufficient
 as possible. The result is a highly decentralized supply
 system, best suited to su  ortin defensive infantr
 operations in place

 peacetime forces with low ammunition consumption
 rates-most PLA artillery batteries, for example, fire
 only a handful of shells a year-but would probably
 be overwhelmed by the wartime requirements of a
 more modern ground force. Much of China's basic
 military equipment-spare parts, calibration, and di-
 agnostic equipment-is produced and managed by
 military regions, using different administrative proce-
 dures. Moreover, among China's weapons and ammu-
 nition factories-many of which produce identical
 items-there is little standardization in such basic
 areas as spare parts numbering systems or shipping
 container designs. These characteristics severely con-
 But Long-Term Gains
 Despite the problems, the combined-arms army is the
 foundation upon which Beijing can build a modern
 ground army. Already, the changing structure has
 revitalized the discussion of strategy and tactics and
 forced officers in the various service arms of the PLA
 to think far more realistically about war on the
 modern battlefield. Numerous articles in China's
 premier military newspaper, the Liberation Army
 Daily, indicate that a lively discussion of combined-
 arms operations is under way.
 Compared with field armies and the 1982 version of
 the combined-arms armies, the new table of organiza-
 tion offers greater mobility, firepower, and combined-
 arms integration (see table 1). In the past year,
 entirely new combat organizations have appeared
 throughout the PLA, and previously independent
 tank, artillery, engineer, air defense, and chemical
 defense units have been subordinated to group armies.
 Although equipment levels and readiness postures
 continue to depend on mission and location, Chinese
 main force units are probably more standardized
 under the group army structure than at any previous
 'Unlike Western and Soviet armies, PLA units do not customarily
 requisition supplies from logistics centers, but instead receive

 Acquiring New Weapons
 China has made considerable progress toward devel-
 oping some of the new weapons and equipment needed
 to give offensive punch to group armies. In the past
 three years, Beijing has unveiled an impressive variety
 of weapons, including an improved main battle tank,
 new armored personnel carriers, self-propelled and
 towed artillery, and lightweight surface-to-air mis-
 siles                              China's
 most elite group armies in the northeast are receiving
 China's newest ground weapons
 The new systems are being provided in small quanti-
 ties, however, and China would be unlikely to fully
 equip its forces opposite the USSR for at least 10
 years. Moreover, the Soviets almost certainly would
 continue upgrading their forces during this period. As
 these new weapons are deployed, however, and until
 the Soviets add new weapon systems to their forces
 along the border, the Chinese systems will begin to fill
 some glaring gaps in Beijing's defenses:
 ? New, extended-range artillery systems provide im-
 pressive fire support, equaling or exceeding the
 range of the Soviet guns facing them.
 ? The new Chinese tank is superior in range, accura-
 cy, and mobility to standard T-54/55 and T-62
 tanks, which make up 90 percent of Soviet tanks
 currently facing China.
 ? The new infantry fighting vehicles offer a challenge
 to the BMP-1, the backbone of Soviet mechanized
 infantry forces in Asia; the automatic cannon of
 Chinese infantry fighting vehicles demonstrated at
 an arms show in Beijing late last year could destroy
 BMPs at ranges up to 3,000 meters. However, if the
 Soviets fit BMPs in the Far East with additional
 armor-as they have in Eastern Europe and Af-
 ghanistan-this range would be considerably
 reduced.
 ? Deployment of self-propelled antiaircraft artillery
 (AAA) and infantry fighting vehicles with automat-
 ic cannons would provide Chinese mechanized
 forces with improved defense against Soviet attack
 helicopters (see figure 10, foldout)
 undergoing a transformation.
 Training the Modern Soldier
 The composition of the Chinese officer corps is also
 Chinese officers are no longer promoted
 directly from the enlisted ranks; all new officers must
 at least be senior middle school (high school) gradu-
 ates and complete a two-year officer training course
 at a military academy. Furthermore, to attract
 China's most educated youth to the military, college
 graduates can receive commissions after completing a
 one-year officer training course, or completing mili-
 tary training courses now mandatory at some civilian
 universities.

 Equally profound changes are under way in China's
 enlisted ranks, aimed at increasing the number of
 technically trained soldiers by creating a career non-
 commissioned officer (NCO) corps. The first NCO
 training academy was opened last year to retain
 technically skilled enlisted men who can no longer
 expect to advance to officer ranks. An NCO career
 system also provides a base for training conscripts and
 wartime mobilization of a ready reserve. Within
 group armies, a skilled NCO corps will free junior
 officers from technical and administrative tasks
 and-like most Western armies-will allow officers
 to focus on improving leadership and command.

 assignment for new officers, who can test their com-

 Vietnamese troops. Beijing is more fully exploiting the
 training opportunity provided by the Malipo cam-

 Over the past three years, two highly specialized
 means have been used to provide very different types
 of training experiences for China's ground forces. The
 most dramatic of these is the battlefield south of the
 town of Malipo on the Vietnamese border where,
 since April 1984, more than 200,000 troops from

 Although combat at Malipo provides battle-hardening
 for China's rejuvenated officer corps, it offers little in
 terms of combined-arms experience. Beijing has limit-
 ed the battlefield to a series of hilltops just inside
 Vietnam in an area some 15 kilometers wide and 3
 kilometers deep, in part because penetrations farther
 into Vietnam would overtax China's logistics and
 communications capabilities. Moreover, the fighting
 at Malipo has provided no opportunities to improve
 the PLA's most pressing deficiencies: close air support
 and integrated armor and infantry operations. Nei-
 ther side has used aircraft to support infantry opera-
 tions on the battlefield, and armored vehicles are
 unsuited to the mountainous terrain of MalipoF__
 China has turned to the West for advanced training
 techniques. Chinese military visitors to the National
 Training Center at Fort Irwin, California,

 areas that cover approximately 300 square kilometers,
 consisting of infantry assault courses, impact areas for
 artillery and ground attack aircraft live-fire exercises,

 these troops will probably use tactics designed to
 simulate those that China's ground forces would face
 against a Soviet attack.
 According to press reports, eventually every group
 army will travel to the National Training Center for
 combat evaluation. However, intensive combined-
 arms training at a single national facility for China's
 77 infantry divisions would require more than five
 years, and we believe instead that the Nanjing facility
 will serve as a model for the development of other
 combined-arms training centers throughout China.
 We believe that reorganization and consolidation of
 the armed forces have not significantly reduced
 China's fighting strength (see appendix). In the past
 two years, we estimate that as many as 400,000 troops
 have been trimmed from China's ground combat
 forces (excluding cuts in the General Logistics De-
 partment and the General Political Department).
 in PLA fighting strength have probably been limited
 to 100,000 troops-roughly 3 percent of PLA ground
 forces-composed largely of China's oldest, least edu-

 research and development, Beijing has increasingly
 sought "creative financing" arrangements in the
 As a result of resource constraints and long-term
 defense priorities, we believe that China's military
 modernization program may result in the emergence
 of two distinct types of group armies in the next
 decade. Group armies deployed against Vietnam and
 Taiwan will probably remain infantry-heavy forces
 because their opponents are less mechanized than the
 Soviets. Primary improvements will probably consist
 of weapons best suited to supporting infantry opera-
 tions-towed artillery, mortars, small arms, tactical
 radios, and artillery fire-control systems-and inte-
 grated close air support coordination. In contrast,
 group armies arrayed against the Soviet Union will
 probably become highly mechanized formations with
 weapons comparable to Soviet and Western 1980s-
 vintage designs, and potentially offer a major capabil-
 ity to project military power.
 Implications for the United States and the West
 Beijing's recognition of the equipment deficiencies
 apparent in the group armies does not mean that
 China is ready to buy outright large quantities of
 military hardware from the West. China's priority, as
 reflected in the state budget, is not major defense
 spending but building China's civilian economy.
 Equipping the group armies soon to meet the idealized
 weapon holdings would be prohibitively expensive-
 for example, China would have to build over 10,000
 In some cases, to explore concepts requiring modern
 equipment, the Chinese General Staff will buy a few
 samples of selected military hardware. The Chinese,
 for example, are planning to form an army aviation/
 army air corps structure with light attack helicopters
 subordinate to the group army
 Rather than buying equipment, Beijing is more likely
 for the next few years to seek critical technologies
 from the West to "leapfrog" the weapons of the 1970s
 and 1980s and to revamp its defense industries to
 build weapons capable of meeting the anticipated
 Soviet threat of the 21st century (see inset). Using the
 slogan "win the 21st century," an article in the
 authoritative Liberation Army Daily in October 1985,
 authored by members of the General Staff Depart-
 ment, strongly urged that the PLA should build for

 Beijing believes the Soviet
 Union is concentrating on rebuilding its economy and
 defending the gains it made in the 1970s before
 resuming the offensive early in the next century. At
 that time, Moscow will increase the military pressure
 on China to bend Beijing's policy to Moscow's will.
 This Chinese judgment is reflected in Beijing's con-
 tinuing and determined military modernization pro-

 century.

 We believe that Beijing's strategy requires a low level
 of tensions with Moscow if its reform program, which
 includes the ambitious military modernization drive,
 is to succeed. This strategy will probably become
 more difficult-and more crucial-over the next
 decade. Indeed, as its military strength grows, Beijing
 will be compelled to pursue a dialogue with the
 Soviet Union to avoid unduly increasing friction with
 a powerful adversary, creating an arms race that
 China is not able to win. Beijing realizes that no
 military strategy it might choose would allow it to
 fully meet the Soviet threat. Accordingly, the Chinese
 continue to see talks as the key to controlling ten-
 sions. To this end, we expect Beijing to continue to
 exchange visits and to sign economic and technical
 agreements with Moscow-without fundamentally
 altering its assessment of the Soviet threat.

 that China was no longer interested in buying the I-

 massed armor formations-that can be delivered by
 aircraft, artillery, and multiple-rocket launchers.
 ? Advanced Western air defense systems could pro-
 vide a quantum improvement in the battlefield
 survivability of China's group armies
 In addition to seeking the advanced technologies,
 Beijing is looking for assistance in learning systems

 development projects. Beijing's track record on pro-

 and fires a projectile at the heat signature of vehicle engines.

 In the shorter term, the Chinese will increasingly seek

 ? Combat Doctrine and Operational Concepts. We
 believe Beijing intends to take advantage of US and
 NATO experience in combined-arms operations and
 knowledge of Soviet doctrine and tactics. During
 US Army Chief of Staff Wickham's visit to China
 in November 1986,
 ? Combined-Arms Tactics. Beijing has made an ex-
 tensive effort to study US and NATO modern
 combat tactics. Greater exposure to Western war-
 fighting doctrine-and the PLA's growing emphasis
 to lecture
 on a variety of topics at the newly formed National
 Defense University including army aviation doc-
 trine, command and control, and air defense proce-
 dures for US ground forces. During meetings in
 Beijing with US Army combat operations experts in
 February, Chinese strategists demonstrated a strong
 focus on US operational art and doctrine for com-
 bating massed Soviet armor.
 on realistic combined-arms training-should result
 in improved Chinese combined-arms operations,
 especially as more modern weapons become avail-
 able and younger, better educated officers move
 into command positions.
 ? Force-Management Techniques. Beijing's interest in
 Western force-management techniques will proba-
 bly grow with the increasing complexity of group
 army equipment. Especially in the northern military
 regions, the focus of wartime logistics management
 is shifting to providing spare parts for laser range-
 finders, battlefield computers, and large-caliber am-
 munition. China will probably focus on the tools
 used to manage logistics-quality-assurance tech-
 nology, large-scale automated logistics management
 systems-and probably does not perceive a need to
 copy Western force sustainment methods or signifi-
 cantly modify the PLA's decentralized force man-
 agement practices. However, as its appreciation for
 the cost and complexity of modern ground force
 equipment grows, the PLA may adopt a more
 centralized, demand-driven logistic system to man-
 age its most expensive weapon components.
 Beijing's formation of the group armies, therefore, is
 the first step in a long process-one that spans
 decades-of force modernization. Emphasis in the
 near term will be on those low-cost areas of force
 restructuring, training, the development of the opera-
 tional art, and experimentation. But the new forma-
 tions are designed to carry the Chinese Army into the
 21st century with the hope that, once the funding is
 available and defense industries become sufficiently
 modernized, Beijing can field a truly modern force
 capable of meeting any adversary, even the Soviet
 Union.
