u Fo it MORE than a year the national 
8 press has carefully been unrolling revela-
tions about the Watergate incident. Day 
a) 
> after day, on the front pages, we read 
about the latest carefully timed develop-
ments. And witness after witness speaks 
his conflicting piece before the Senate 
Watergate Committee. We can remember 
no continuing story which has been on 
the front pages for so long since the 
Second World War. 
Americans have been wondering what 
Watergate is really all about. It is obvious-
ly not a basic conflict between "Liberals" 
and Conservatives; between totalitarians 
ar ''bertarians; between those who. are 
try to enslave us and those who are 
trying to keep us free. No basic issues are 
discussed, or even mentioned. Both 
Nixon and his enemies are committed 
colleeivists, and neither side mentions 
such things as the inherent fascism of his 
Phased takeover of the American econ-
omy. The conflict simply seems to be 
about which gang of collectivists, which 
ment; about whether or not Richard 
Nixon will resign and be replaced. 
It has been apparent from the begin-
ning that the real meaning of Watergate 
lies as usual below the surface; that 
Watergate is either a part of something 
else; or a prelude to, or a diversion from, 
something else. And now at last it is 
becoming clear what the secret purpose 
is. The real purpose of Watergate is so to 
discredit the people running our gov-
ernment that Americans of all political 
beliefs will become disillusioned with our 
system of government itself � thereby 
providing the acquiescence the conspira-
tors behind Watergate need to change our 
government into the total collectivism of 
dictatorship. 
Totalitarians have long complained 
about our constitutional system of checks 
and balances, because it divides the politi-
cal power and makes a dictatorship im-
possible. To make it possible, the dicta-
tors know they must destroy that system. 
And it is interesting to note thaf revo-
lutionaries on all sides have begun using 
Watergate as the excuse to suggest 
changes. Leading Democrats have sug-
gested that Richard Nixon resign and be 
replaced by a committee. Nixon himself 
said recently in a radio speech that 
perhaps our government should be reor-
ganized, by limiting the Presidency to a 
single six-year term, and extending a 
Congressman's term to four years instead 
of two � which of course would make 
the Congressmen exactly half as respon-
sive to our wishes as they are now, 
because they would have to stand for 
re-election half as often. This is also what 
Approved for Release: 2017/01/18 C01482376 
Approved for Release: 2017/01/18 C01482376 
institutions suggests in its proposed new 
constitution. The Center is a revolution-
ary "think tank." 
Indeed, there are many reasons to 
believe that the real purpose of the June 
17, 1972, Watergate raid was not at all to 
collect �incriminating information about 
the Democrats � but simply to arrange 
for the arrests of the raiders, so as to 
arrange the necessary scandal. 
About The Raid 
The official story of the Watergate 
fiasco is of course that the raiders went 
there to get proof, for instance, that the 
Democrats are behind the riots America 
has been suffering. If such proof had been 
found, we are supposed to believe, the 
Republicans would have used it against 
the Democrats in the Presidential cam-
paign. But there was no need at all for the 
Republicans to raid the Watergate to find 
Jut who is behind the riots � because the 
Republican bosses already knew. The 
guilty parties are the Republican bosses 
themselves, as my colleagues and I have 
been pointing out for some time. 
The Republican bosses have continued 
intact the policy of the Democrat bosses, 
in which the revolutionaries who run the 
riots are financed with your tax money, 
by means of such phony programs as the 
"War on Poverty." It was the Nixon 
Administration which gave a tax-exempt 
foundation to Communist terrorist Jerry 
Rubin, so that the bearded freak would 
not need to pay income tax on all the 
money he is making. Indeed, subsequent 
revelations show that the Nixon Adminis-
'ration's "department of dirty tricks" 
,oncocted wild schemes involving bomb-
ings, burglaries, and kidnappings, and the 
infiltration of student groups in order to 
cause violence, so as to produce the kind 
of reaction that would make the Adminis-
tration look good. And this of course 
would provide the excuse for imposition 
of repressive measures � to "solve" the 
very problems the conspirators at the top 
are themselves creating. 
2 
So it makes no sense whatever to 
believe that the Watergate raiders really 
went to the scene of the crime to find 
"evidence" that the Democrats are be-
hind the riots. 
We are also told officially that the 
Watergate raiders were looking for proof 
that the Communists were behind the 
Democrats. We are told this by the same 
Nixon Administration which during the 
contrived war in Vietnam continued in-
tact Lyndon Johnson's policy of aid and 
trade with the arsenal of the Vietcong, 
permitting them to get the military equip-
ment they used to kill our soldiers; the 
same Nixon Administration which is now 
delivering billions of your tax dollars to 
the Reds in the form of credits for which 
you pay; the same Nixon Administration 
which recently rolled out the red carpet 
for Communist dictator Leonid Brezhnev, 
who is personally responsible for count-
less murders, and who keeps millions of 
victims in slave camps across Russia; the 
same Nixon Administration which em-
braced Mao Tse-tung, murderer of some 
sixty-four million Chinese. 
In fact, if the Watergators really did 
want proof of Communist associations 
they could have hung on the Democrats 
during the camgaign, there was no need at 
all for them to raid Democrat National 
Committee headquarters. Watergate reve-
lations now make clear that the Nixonites 
did everything they could to make 
George McGovern the Democrat candi-
date � just as my colleagues and I said 
from the beginning � because McGovern 
was by far the easiest candidate for Nixon 
to defeat. Whether he knew it or not, 
McGovern was nothing but Nixon's 
stooge. The idea was to deny the voters a 
genuine political choice, as usual, by 
arranging the nomination of a freak as the 
Democrat nominee, so that the voters 
would have to vote for Nixon whether 
they liked him or not. 
The reason McGovern was so easy to 
beat was for instance the fact that he is 
the only Presidential candidate in the 
AMERICAN OPINION 
Senate Watergate Committee has yet to look into the Wallace shooting and the death of Mrs. Hunt. 
history of either major party who was 
also an official sponsor of a certified 
Communist Front. McGovern was a na-
tional sponsor of a Communist Front 
known as the American Peace Crusade, 
and he held that exalted position not dur-
ing the Popular Front era of the 1930s, 
when some innocent people were tricked 
into such things � but in 1951, at the 
height of the Cold War, when members of 
such organizations were presumed to 
know exactly what they were doing. So 
McGovern was made to order for a so-
called anti-Communist like Nixon. McGov-
ern is the closest thing to an open Com-
munist who has ever been the Presidential 
candidate of a major political party. 
And there was no need whatever for 
Richard Nixon to raid the Watergate to 
discover all this. It was already in official 
government records. Indeed, it was pub-
lished with incriminating details in the 
September, 1972, issue of AMERICAN 
OPINION. So the question arises: If Rich-
ard Nixon really was sincere in his desire 
to expose the Communist background of 
the Democrat campaign, why did he 
SEPTEMBER, 1973 
never once mention the fact that George 
McGovern was the national sponsor of 
a Communist Front, branded as such 
by the federal government? Nixon could 
have done so � and in fact quite properly 
should have done so � but he did not. 
So for all these reasons, we can see 
clearly that the motives the Adminis-
tration gives us for the Watergate raid are 
as usual completely phony. Whether or 
not all the raiders knew it, they were 
going to the Watergate for a completely 
different reason. 
Now let's take a look at the raid itself. i 
For instance, you will remember having 
heard that the Watergate raiders put tape 
on the locks of two doors in the base-
ment, so that the tongue mechanisms in 
the doors could not thrust into the 
grooves in the door frames. As they 
prepared to use those doors, security 
guard Frank Wills, who had just come on 
duty, discovered the tape and removed it. 
"I took the tape off." he explained 
later, "but I didn't think zinything of it. I 
thought maybe the building's engineer 
had done it."

Approved for Release: 2017/01/18 C01482376 
In his new book, The Inzpeachment Of 
Richard Nixon, Leonard Lurie describes 
what happened next as follows: "When 
the five interlopers discovered their tapes 
had been removed, they panicked. They 
returned to the area below the Watergate 
Restaurant; there it was decided that the 
locksmith Gonzalez would go back and 
pick the locks, while Barker was sent up 
to Liddy and Hunt to discuss the possi-
bility of calling off the break-in. McCord 
went to the motel to await word. Liddy 
sent Barker back with word not to worry 
and the mission was on." 
Indeed, Gonzalez and another raider 
retaped the locks, so that when security 
guard Frank Wills, who was already sus-
picious, returned to check the doors, he 
knew something was wrong, and called 
the police to report a possible burglary. 
In other words, the raiders knew that 
someone had detected their presence in 
Watergate, but Liddy, the boss � who 
was waiting outside � decided to con-
tinue the operation nevertheless. Remem-
ber that we are talking here about men 
who are experts in their business. 
Across the street from Watergate, in 
the Howard Johnson motel, former F.B.I. 
agent Alfred Baldwin, recently hired by 
McCord, was serving as lookout. Baldwin 
told the Los A ngeles Times that at one 
point the lights on the entire floor above 
the Democrat National Committee offices 
went on, so he dutifully reported the fact 
by walkie-talkie to the raiders across the 
street, and they told him not to worry. 
Baldwin also tells us this: "Not long after 
that a car.parked in front of the Water-
gate and three men got out and went 
inside. I wondered if that meant any-
thing, but I did not use the walkie-talkie 
at that time." 
Why didn't he? It turned out that 
those men were members of the "old 
clothes' squad of the Washington police 
depattment and were there to arrest the 
burglars. If Baldwin had. warned his co-
conspirators in time, it is possible they 
could have gotten away. It is interesting 
to note that Baldwin later became a 
prosecution witness, in return for which 
the government let him go his way scot-
free. And it even turned out that the 
members of the "old clothes" squad had 
been off duty for an hour and fifteen 
minutes � apparently waiting for the call 
that tipped the operation. 
It is also interesting to record how the 
conspirators behaved once inside Demo-
crat National Headquarters � knowing 
that their presence might already be 
suspected by building guards. According 
to Leonard Lurie, this is what the police 
found when they cornered the Watergate 
Five: "... Two panels were ripped out of 
the office roof. Files lay in disarray. 
Random damage had been done all over 
the suite. It is clear that, if they had gone 
undetected, the burglars would have had 
to spend a great deal more time straight-
ening up their mess, so as not to arouse 
the suspicions of the staff when they 
returned on Monday morning. Any sign 
of forced entry would have probably led 
to a search, which would have uncovered 
the bugs in the ceiling and the taps on the 
phones." 
So, after having had one panic when 
they discovered that the tape on the door 
locks had been mysteriously removed, the 
raiders nevertheless took the entire Dem-
ocratic National Committee headquarters 
apart, as if they had all the time in the 
world, and had nothing to fear from the 
police. But, as usual, the national press 
has said not a word about this. 
You will also remember that E. How-
ard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy were not 
arrested at once. Both of them succeeded 
in getting away from Watergate. How, 
then, did the police connect them with 
the job? Well, it seems that two of the 
five raiders arrested inside Watergate were 
carrying address books, which contained 
E. Howard Hunt's name. Next to Hunt's 
name and telephone number, one of the 
raiders had written "W-house," for White 
House. Which made it relatively easy for 
the police to put two and two together. 
4 AMERICAN OPINION 
Running the Watergate burglary were "former" C.I.A. 
agents E. Howard Hunt (above right) and James McCord 
(right), who oversaw what appears to have been a C.I.A. 
"dirty tricks" operation run out of the White House and 
the Committee To Re-elect The President. There is no 
other reasonable explanation for the fact that then-
director of the C.I.A. Richard Helms (below) was 
awakened at three a.m. to be briefed on what at the 
time appeared to authorities to be a domestic burglary. 
When the case broke, Helms was sent out of the coun-
try as Ambassador to Iran and William E. Colby, the 
head of C.I.A.'s "dirty tricks" operations (to which 
Hunt had been assigned), was soon made director with 
authority over all U.S. intelligence operations. Mean-
while, Mrs. Howard Hunt, also a C.IA. agent, was ac-
cepting multi-million-dollar payoffs and demanding 
even more money. Then the plane on which she was 
flying from Washington to Chicago with two million 
dollars in negotiable paper was mechanically sabotaged 
and crashed � but Mrs. Hunt and the captain of the air-
craft were dead of cyanide poisoning before the aircraft 
ever hit the ground. Surviving the crash was an armed 
government agent identified as a "former" C.I.A. para-
chute specialist. After Mrs. Hunt's death, her husband 
revealed that immediately after the shooting of Gov-
ernor Wallace he had been ordered by Presidential at-
torney Charles Colson to go to gunman Arthur Brem-
er's apartment to clear it of evidence. This raises fur-
ther serious questions since Bremer's "boss" in the shoot-
ing of Wallace was Dennis Cossini, a C.I.A. operative 
who was subsequently murdered in Toronto and whose 
body was recovered and disposed of by C.I.A. agents. 
SEPTEMBER, 1973

And professional intelligence agents 
inform your reporter that this was com-
pletely unprofessional behavior. A profes-
sional on such an assignment leaves be-
hind all mention of his associates who 
might be implicated � and even all proof 
or his own identity � in case he is caught. 
Yet the Watergate raiders, who are sup-
posed to be such experts, actually were 
carrying evidence which linked them with 
White House official E. Howard Hunt. 
So the possibility exists that some-
where in the machinery there was a 
double agent, pretending to work for the 
Nixon gang, but in reality in the pay of 
someone else � someone else who pre-
cipitated the Watergate scandal in order 
to embarrass him who would be king. 
In fact, the latest incredible develop-
ment makes the raid even more curious, 
for it seems that columnist Jack Ander-
son is involved. Anderson is a former 
partner of the late -Soviet apologist Drew 
Pearson. He is also the man who reported 
last year that Senator Thomas Eagleton, 
McGovern's first runningmate, had a rec-
ord as a drunken driver � and then claimed 
he had made a mistake. Anderson is also 
the man who, in a recent issue of Parade 
magazine, confessed that he knew about 
the Watergate plot more than two months 
before the break-in on June 17, 1972 � 
but did nothing about it. This is the same 
Jack Anderson who is always mouthing 
off about morality in government. If a 
citizen has knowledge of a crime, and 
fails to report that knowledge to law 
enforcement authorities, then the citizen 
himself is guilty of a crime � which is 
exactly what the Watergate investigators 
now pompously tell us is one of .the 
crimes of Richard Nixon. Yet, Jack An-
derson was aware of the Watergate raid 
for more than two months before it 
happened, and said absolutely nothing. 
Why? Could the answer lie in the 
fascinating fact that Jack Anderson met 
the Watergate raiders at Washington's 
National Airport on June 16, 1972 � the 
day before the raid � as they flew in 
6 
from Miami to do the job? Was Anderson 
in some way involved in the raid � to a 
greater extent than his failure to tell the 
authorities what he knew in time? For 
instance, Anderson was personally ac-
quainted with several of the Watergate 
conspirators. He knew Bernard Barker. 
He knew Frank Sturgis, and has done 
several stories about him. Sturgis, who 
was arrested less than thirty-six hours 
after Anderson met him at National 
Airport, was an Anderson informant. So 
once again the sensible question arises of 
whether the entire Watergate scandal was 
some kind of a setup. 
And along these lines, it is also inter-
esting to make note of the earlier raid by 
the same gang on the offices of Dr. Lewis 
J. Fielding, who is Dr. Daniel Ellsberg's 
California psychiatrist. Once again, the 
Nixonites have an official explanation, 
according to which they were looking for 
psychological information they could use 
to destroy the man who had stolen the 
Pentagon Papers. And, once again, the 
story appears to be the usual Nixon 
fraud. For it now develops that the raid 
on Fielding's offices was as usual totally 
unnecessary. 
For instance, the government knew 
that Ellsberg and his wife had partici-
pated in the Communist-sponsored May 
Day demonstrations at Washington in 
May 1971. He has been a senior research 
associate at the Center for International 
Studies of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, which is financed by the 
Central Intelligence Agency, and one of 
the key members of which is Harold 
Isaacs, a man identified as a Communist 
and co-operative of Comintern agent 
Agnes Smedley in the delivery of China 
to the Reds. Among Ellsberg's close 
associates is his attorney, Leonard Bou-
din, who has represented Fidel Castro in 
the United States and is general counsel 
of the Emergency Civil Liberties Commit-
tee � officially cited as a Communist 
Front founded "to defend the cases of 
Communist lawbreakers." Among his 
AMERICAN OPINION 
other clients have been Soviet spy Judith 
CopIon and Alger Hiss. 
Indeed, the Nixonites knew that Ells-
berg had passed a copy of the Pentagon 
Papers to the Soviet Embassy even before 
he passed one to the New York Times. 
Perhaps that is why Valeurs Actuelles, the 
respected Paris financial weekly, not long 
ago openly branded Ellsberg as a Commu-
nist espionage agent. That is also why the 
government had an airtight case against 
Ellsberg on charges of conspiracy to 
violate our espionage laws, with no need 
whatever to conduct a nonsensical raid on 
his psychiatrist � which the national 
press and the so-called "anti-Communist" 
Nixon Administration have yet to men-
tion. 
It also develops that Ellsberg is a 
protege of none other than Dr. Henry 
Kissinger, and has been since he was a stu-
dent at Harvard. In 1968, Kissinger re-
cruited Ellsberg as part of a special panel 
of foreign policy experts to formulate an 
Indo-China policy for Richard Nixon. 
Yet, says intelligence expert Frank Ca-
pell, in a recent issue of The Review Of 
The News, it was Kissinger, Ellsberg's pro-
tector, who approved the plans to bur-
glarize Ellsberg's psychiatrist. Why? 
The so-called "plumbers" who com-
pose Nixon's Watergate gang are supposed 
to be among the world's foremost experts 
in their business, as we have said. If their 
true purpose had really been simply to 
photograph material in Dr. Fielding's 
files, they were expert enough to have 
picked the door locks and eased open the 
files, done their photography, closed the 
files and left. Then they could have done 
whatever they liked with the information; 
they could have published it to prove to 
the world what a freak Ellsberg really is � 
and, even today, Dr. Fielding would have 
no proof that the information came from 
his office, or even that the raiders had 
ever been there. 
What did the "plumbers" do instead? 
They smashed open the file in Fielding's 
office with a crowbar! So that it would 
SEPTEMBER, 1973 
be obvious even to a psychiatrist that 
someone had been on the premises with 
illegal intent. 
Now, what was the effect of the raid 
on Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist? The 
answer, of course, is that the raid got 
Ellsberg off the hook when it was re-
vealed that there was a connection be-
tween it and the Watergate break-in. 
Remember that Ellsberg admitted stealing 
the Pentagon Papers. Had it not been for 
the Watergate revelation, he would proba-
bly now be in prison. Coming as it did at 
the crucial time in his trial, ih. revelation 
forced a directed verdict of acquittal. 
So it is perfectly sensible to assume 
that that was in fact the real purpose of 
the phony raid to collect information 
which the raiders already had. The real 
purpose of the raid appears to be Henry 
Kissinger's desire to protect his protege � 
who was being so helpful to the Soviet 
Embassy. 
And all of this provokes curiosity 
about the backgrounds of the Watergate 
Seven. As we have seen, Sturgis, for 
instance, is a Jack Anderson informant. 
Richard Helms, at the time director of 
the C.I.A., admitted to the Ervin Com-
mittee that Martinez was on the C.I.A. 
payroll when he was caught in Watergate. 
Barker, a Cuban, is a disciple of E. 
Howard Hunt, who for twenty years was 
an agent of the Central Intelligence 
Agency � and may still be. According to 
professional intelligence experts, the 
C.I.A., like the Mafia, is an organization 
one never quits. And James WI McCord, 
who after his conviction spilled the beans 
about Watergate to Judge John Sirica, has 
also been a C.I.A. man for many years. 
An informant also reports that E. 
Howard Hunt was the C.I.A. man who 
directed the abortive Bay of Pigs opera-
tion in Cuba in 1961, and that Sturgis, 
Barker, and McCord were involved. The 
Cuban exiles who participated in the Bay 
of Pigs invasion did so of course to free 
their country from Communism, but as in 
one C.I.A. operation after another, when

the, smoke cleared the Cuban patriots had 
been wiped out or captured, and Fidel 
Castro was more firmly than ever in 
control. The patriots had been promised 
air cover, without which the operation 
could not have succeeded, but when they 
were already at sea the Kennedy Adminis-
tration decided to withhold it. The planes 
never arrived, and the patriots were easy 
prey. Indeed, Castro was perfectly aware 
that the invasion was coming. 
One of our informants � who was 
actively involved in the Bay of Pigs � 
recalls an interesting story told to him by 
the late David Ferrie, who was also a 
ar) C.I.A. agent, and who was one of those 
r--
co accused by New Orleans District Attor-
ney Jim Garrison of having participated 
in the assassination of President Kennedy. 
o According to Ferrie, E. Howard Hunt 
co went to Cuba several times before the 
v of Pigs, and personally explained the

supervised the installation on the beaches 
of pointed, four-foot stakes to impede 
(1) the invaders. And this of course would 
cu make Hunt's reputation as a "fanatic 
a) anti-Communist" rather dubious. 
11 It also would go a long way toward a 
cf) complete explanation of Watergate.

> The Plane Crash 
2 
c_ On December 8, 1972, Mrs. Dorothy 
.Hunt, wife of C.I.A. man E. Howard 
Hunt, got aboard United Air Lines Flight 
553 at National Airport, bound for Mid-
way Airport in Chicago. Mrs. Hunt herself 
was a C.I.A. agent, and had been one even 
longer .than her husband. They were 
A. "family." Indeed, contrary to ear-
ii from the White House, it now 
develops that Mrs. Hunt was the Water-
gate "bag woman." It was she who, 
pursuant to orders, delivered the offer of 
Executive Clemency to Watergate defen-
dants. It was she who paid them off in 
return for their promises to keep their 
mouths shut. And on December 8, 1972, 
she apparently was travelling with about 
two million dollars in cash, traveller's 
8 
checks, and money orders which the 
Nixon Team had handed over to buy her 
silence. Mrs. Hunt was privy to the same 
Watergate information as was her hus-
band, and could have used it to blow the 
Watergators from the water. 
Also on Flight 553, was C.B.S. net-
work newswoman Michele Clark, who 
was getting ready to do a story on 
Watergate. There was also a man carrying a 
gun, and calling himself Harold R. Met-
calf, who claimed to be an agent for the 
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous 
Drugs. 
And there were Ralph Blodgett and 
James W. Krueger, attorneys for the 
Northern Natural Gas Company of 
Omaha, along with some others associ-
ated with them. Mr. Blodgett and the 
others were angry at John Mitchell � one 
of the most important of the accused 
Watergate conspirators � and were deter-
mined to blow the lid off the case. It 
seems that former Attorney General 
Mitchell, and his friends running the 
Justice Department, were putting the 
screws to Northern Natural Gas. On 
September 7, 1972, some officials of that 
firm and its subsidiaries were indicted on 
federal criminal charges in Omaha, Chi-
cago, and Hammond, Indiana � and 
charged with bribing local officials to let 
a gas pipeline go through. 
All of this has been uncovered by Mr. 
Sherman H. Skolnick of Chicago, who is 
Chairman of the Citizens' Committee to 
Clean Up the Courts, and whose investiga-
tions have caused the departure of several 
corrupt Chicagoland judges. It was Skol-
nick who sent former Illinois Governor 
Otto Kerner to jail. And Skolnick reports 
that, to defend itself against the Justice 
Department's charges, Northern Natural 
Gas uncovered documents showing that 
Mitchell; while U.S. Attorney General in 
1969, dropped anti-trust charges against 
its competitor, El Paso Natural Gas; that 
the decision was worth several hundred 
million dollars to El Paso � and that John 
Mitchell's law partner represented El Paso

MAN 
BEHIND 
� THE 
MASK 
"More Startling Than Watergate" is the only way to 
describe this shocking report of Richard Milhous Nixon's 
sinister alliances and all-consuming ambition. 
Richard Nixon: The Man Behind The Mask reveals 
that the President not only hires and uses criminals and 
conspirators, but that he himself is part of a larger and 
far more dangerous conspiracy. The real plans and actual 
purpose of this secretive ruler are detailed at last in this 
carefully documented study.

at the time. Indeed, says Skolnick, Mitch-
ell mysteriously developed a stock inter-
est in El Paso with a law partner as a 
nominee. And pipeline attorney Krueger 
was carrying the proof of all this on 
Flight 553, on his way back from Wash-
ington, where pipeline attorney Blodgett 
had been trying to get the charges against 
Northern Natural Gas dropped. 
In other words, there were three dif-
ferent sources aboard United Air Lines 
Flight 553 who could have exposed vari-
ous aspects of Watergate; Mrs. E. Howard 
Hunt, Miss Michele Clark, and the North-
ern Natural Gas crowd. 
As this aircraft approached Midway 
Airport, the outer marker, also known as 
the Kedzie Localizer � a signal which 
tells the pilot where he is � stopped 
working. So did the flight data recorder. 
So did the captain's altimeter, which 
records the plane's altitude. Indeed, cir-
cuit breakers started popping all over the 
place. And the weather was bad, so the 
..pilot had no idea where he was. A witness 
on the ground says he was far off course. 
Eleven witnesses on the ground say the 
descending plane had no lights. And the 
chance of all this happening at the same 
time is about as likely as the possibility 
that Richard Nixon will ever make any-
thing perfectly clear. 
Indeed, a witness on the ground saw 
a descending parachute supporting an 
aluminum foil ball, which is a technique 
used to jam airborne navigational equip-
ment. It is interesting to note that for-
mer White House counsel John Dean 
testified as follows before the Senate 
Watergate Committee, about the sabo-
tage plans of convicted Watergate boss 
G. Gordon Liddy: "When discussing the 
electronic surveillance, he said that he 
had consulted with one of the best 
authorities in the country, and his plan 
envisioned far more than bugging and 
tapping phones. He said that, under his 
plan, communications between ground 
facilities and aircraft could also be inter-
cepted." 
SEPTEMBER, 1973 
In other words, Flight 553 was appar-
ently the victim of what the disarmament 
hoaxers call "massive overkill." But, be-
lieve it or not, there was even more. For 
instance, Air Traffic Control at Midway 
did not tell 553 that the Kedzie Localizer 
was not working. In fact it told the 
captain to continue inbound and land. 
Yet, at the same time, it told A.T.C. at 
nearby O'Hare Field that Flight 553 
would circle Midway again. The confused 
pilot was given the idea that he was really 
in a holding pattern, when he was not. 
And the approach controller later testi-
fied that he had "forgotten" to issue 
approach clearance to Flight 553. 
At 2:29 p.m., United Air Lines Flight 
553 crashed in the streets just short of 
Midway Airport. Waiting for it on the 
ground were up to two hundred agents of 
Defense Intelligence and the F.B.I. � 
which is interesting because F.B.I. re-
gional headquarters is some twelve miles 
from the scene. The F.B.I. was there 
before the fire department, which respond-
ed within one minute of the crash. 
Apparently we are supposed to believe 
that the F.B.I. just happened to be 
holding a convention in the streets ap-
proaching Midway, when Flight 553 hit 
the ground. For some time after he 
revealed this incredible fact, Mr. Skolnick 
was called a liar. But in a letter dated 
June 11, 1973, to John H. Reed, Chair-
man of the National Transportation Safe-
ty Board, William D. Ruckelshaus, who at 
the time was Acting Director of the 
F.B.I., admits that in less than forty-five 
minutes after the crash about fifty F.B.I. 
agents were on the scene. Why? What 
were even fifty, let alone two hundred, 
F.B.I. agents there to do? Why were they 
present without being invited by the 
National Transportation Safety Board, as 
is customary? Did someone know Flight 
553 was scheduled to crash? Were they at 
Midway Airport to arrest Mrs. Hunt, who 
had left Washington with about two 
million dollars in negotiable paper? 
Furthermore, the F.B.I. agents took 
11 
Approved for Release: 2017/01/18 C01482376 
complete control of the crash site, re-
fused to show their credentials, kept even 
the Chicago Police Department away 
from the scene, did the same to the 
Federal Aviation Administration, and 
stripped all the bodies of identification. 
So bizarre was the F.B.I.'s behavior that 
on June 5, 1973, Reed wrote .Ruckels-
haus for an explanation, recalling that 
"for the first time in the memory of our 
staff, an FBI agent went to the control 
tower and listened to the tower tapes 
before our investigators had done so; and 
for the first time to our knowledge, in 
connection with an aircraft accident, an 
FBI agent interviewed witnesses to the 
crash, including flight attendants on the 
aircraft prior to the NTSB interviews. As 
I am sure you can understand, these 
actions, particularly with respect to this 
flight on which Mrs. E. Howard Hunt was 
killed, have raised innumerable questions 
in the minds of those with legitimate 
interests in ascertaining the cause of this 
accident ...." 
So the question once again arises: Has 
the F.B.I. been directed to suppress evi-
dence which may well prove that the 
death of Mrs. Hunt � who could have 
exposed the entire Watergate mess � was 
not an accident, and that Flight 553 was 
sabotaged? 
Furthermore, along these lines, it is 
also interesting to note that the last 
words we hear from the captain of Flight 
553 � whose name, incredibly, was Wen-
dell Whitehouse � were spoken at 
2:26:24.66, according to the cockpit 
voice recorder, which apparently Means 
that the co-pilot and second officer were 
flying the plane during the final N. 
minutes. before the crash. The captain 
does not say a word during that long 
period of emergency! Indeed, the Chicago 
Tribune of March 25, 1973, reports that, 
according to the Cook County coroner's 
office, Captain Whitehouse was dead be-
fore Flight 553 ever hit the ground. 
What killed Captain Wendell White-
house? In a report on the accident issued 
by the National Transportation Safety 
Board, we learn that his body was found 
to contain 3.9 micrograms per milliliter 
of cyanide � which just happens to be 
four times the amount necessary to kill 
him. Yet, the bodies of the co-pilot and 
the second officer contained no cyanide 
at all. We are told that the cyanide 
poisoning was the result of inhalation, 
after plastic foam burned in the fire, but 
the co-pilot and second officer were 
breathing the same air as Captain White-
house, so it appears that the captain was 
poisoned in some other way. In fact, the 
bodies of six of the Watergate-connected 
passengers had a cyanide content higher 
than they could have gotten from a 
so-called aircraft fire. And these were the 
only people in whom cyanide was found. 
Where then did the cyanide come from? 
Your reporter doesn't know, but it is 
interesting to remember that among the 
passengers on Flight 553 was Harold R. 
Metcalf, who was carrying a gun, and who 
is supposed to be an agent for the Bureau 
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. And 
an intelligence agent who managed to get 
to the crash site recalls that Metcalf has 
worked as a parachute jumper in Europe 
for the Central Intelligence Agency. In-
deed, the agent recalls that when Met-
calf stepped from the rear door of the 
hulk of Flight 553, he was wearing a 
jump suit � which is exactly what the 
well-dressed man wears if he expects the 
plane he is flying in to crash. 
And soon after the crash, one of 
Skolnick's agents confronted Metcalf 
with the theory that the crash had delib-
erately been arranged; to which Metcalf 
blurted, "It wasn't supposed to" � and 
left the room. Could Metcalf have been 
what intelligence officers call a "double 
cutout," who was there to do a job, and 
didn't know that a job was supposed to 
be done on him? 
It is also worth recording that the 
Administration kidnapped Alex J. Bottos, 
a Skolnick investigator, and kept him for 
forty days without charge in the Spring-
AMERICAN OPINION 
field, Missouri, federal hospital � the 
same place Robert Kennedy kept General 
Edwin Walker after kidnapping him � 
when Bottos tried to reveal that the two 
million dollars in negotiable paper Mrs. 
Hunt had carried on Flight 553 was being 
disposed of by a criminal "fence." 
Finally, there is the incredible fact 
that on December 9, 1972 � exactly one 
day after the crash � White House aide 
Egil Krogh was appointed Undersecretary 
of Transportation. Krogh was of course 
one of the leaders of the so-called 
"plumbers" unit, which on behalf of 
Richard Nixon burglarized the offices of 
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist. And as 
Undersecretary of Transportation he was 
in charge of the National Transportation 
Safety Board, which was supposed to be 
investigating the crash. Furthermore, on 
December 19, 1972, only eleven days 
after the crash, White House official 
Alexander P. Butterfield of Ervin Com-
mittee fame was appointed the new head 
of the F.A.A. � which was another 
agency supposed to be investigating the 
crash. And five weeks after the crash, 
Dwight Chapin, Richard Nixon's appoint-
ments secretary, who was also in charge 
of the so-called "department of dirty 
tricks," became a top official with United 
Air Lines. 
All of this, of course, is crucially 
revealing, but notice that the kept na-
tional press and the Senate Watergate 
Committee have said not a word � which 
suggests they are participating in the cover-
up they so pompously denounce. 
Bremer And The C.I.A. 
As we have seen, the Watergate story is 
filled with fleeting mentions of the Cen-
tral _Intelligence Agency. James McCord 
was a C.I.A. agent for many years. So was 
E. Howard Hunt. And the C.I.A. gave 
Hunt whatever equipment he wanted to 
carry out his clandestine raids, from a wig 
to photographic equipment to false iden-
tification. Of course, we are constantly 
told that both Hunt and McCord had 
SEPTEMBER, 1973 
"retired" prior to the Watergate burglary, 
but the question arises of whether the 
Agency would work so closely with people 
who were no longer on its-payroll. Indeed, 
C.I.A. boss Richard Helms was awakened 
at three in the morning to be told that 
the Watergate Five had been arrested. 
Why would somebody take the trouble to 
notify the head of the CIA. � at three in 
the morning � about a domestic bur-
glary? The most sensible explanation, of 
course, is that the arrested Watergators 
were active C.I.A. agents who are now 
protecting the Agency. 
It is interesting that under the Nixon 
reorganization the director of the C.I.A. 
is also chairman of the board and coordi-
nator of all U.S. intelligence agencies, 
including the Department of Defense 
Intelligence Agency and the ultrasecret 
National Security Ageiicy. Short of the 
President, he is the one man in a position 
to tie up all of these loose ends. When 
Watergate broke, CIA. Director Richard 
Helms was rushed off as U.S. Ambassador 
to Iran. James Schlesinger was very brief-
ly made Director, and then quickly 
moved up to Secretary of Defense as the 
Watergate scandal became the subject of 
national outrage. With the heat on, Presi-
dent Nixon named William E. Colby to be 
CIA. Director. Mr. Colby's previous job 
had been as head of the C.I.A.'s Director-
ate of Operations, where he had spent his 
entire career. This is the so-called "De-
partment of Dirty Tricks," in charge of 
revolutionary activities and political assas-
sination. Among the men 'reporting di-
rectly to him had been E. Howard Hunt. 
And this raises another fascinating 
series of questions. Regular readers of 
AM ERICA N. OPINION will recall that in 
the October, 1972, issue of this magazine 
your reporter exposed the conspiracy to 
kill Governor George Wallace in Maryland 
on May 15, 1972. You will. remember 
that Arthur Bremer was trained and 
financed to do the job by a gang of 
Milwaukee revolutionaries with many 
CoMmunist connections. His immediate 
13

Approved for Release: 2017/01/18 C01482376 
superior in the conspiracy was an appar-
ent Maoist-Communist named Dennis Sal-
vatore Cossini, who turned up very, very 
dead in the trunk of an automobile in 
Toronto less than two weeks after your 
reporter began looking for him. And you 
will recall that Cossini's body was im-
mediately picked up by three C.I.A. 
agents � which naturally raised the ques-
tion of whether Cossini himself was a 
C.I.A. agent. 
In The Review Of The News for July 
11, 1973, investigative reporter Timothy 
Heinan revealed that he had confirmed 
from three separate federal sources that 
Dennis Cossini, the "control" on Bremer, 
was himself connected with the Central 
Intelligence Agency. Your reporter knew 
from the beginning that the revolution-
aries in Milwaukee did not think up the 
assassination of Wallace themselves. In 
fact there has been sworn testimony that 
Watergator dirty tricks specialist Donald 
Segretti, a trained agent provocateur, was 
operating in Wisconsin with such abandon 
.that the White House had to send special 
investigator Anthony Ulasewicz to "inves-
tigate" its own man. 
So the question now arises: Were the 
Watergators behind the shooting of 
George Wallace? It is a shocking question, 
an impossible question. But at the same 
time, it is perfectly logical and sensible. It 
is a question that must be asked. 
As we now know, the Watergators did 
everything they could last year to prevent 
the Democrats from nominating anyone 
but George McGovern for President � 
just as your reporter was saying at the 
time � because McGovern was by far the 
easiest candidate for Nixon to defeat. 
And as we now know, they went to great 
lengths to arrange that. For instance, just 
before the Florida primary, they issued a 
press release on Senator Ed Muskie's 
letterhead, accusing Senators Henry Jack-
son and Hubert Humphrey of sexual 
misconduct � the purpose of which was 
to discredit all three. We also know now 
that before the California primary they 
actually enlisted the Nazi Party in an 
attempt to get Wallace's American Inde-
pendent Party stricken from the ballot. 
And we know that the Watergators 
committed an endless series of serious 
felonies to re-elect Nixon, from burglary 
to bribery to perjury and obstruction of 
justice. We also know that the original 
scheme suggested by boss Watergator G. 
Gordon Liddy included a proposal for 
kidnapping � the penalty for which is 
death. You will remember that people 
dangerous to Nixon were to be taken to 
Mexico and kept there by force. Indeed, a 
source in U.S. Army Intelligence reports 
that Liddy's scheme � approved by Rich-
ard Nixon � included a serious proposal 
for political assassination. 
Did the Watergators thereafter decide 
to implement Liddy's plan by removing 
George Wallace in the only way they 
could: by sending "lone fanatic" Arthur 
Bremer to shoot him? Unfortunately, 
there is some evidence which may indi-
� cate a connection between Bremer and 
the Watergators. 
� It seems that E. Howard Hunt testified 
recently at a closed-door session of the 
Senate Watergate Committee. According 
to the Washington Post of June 21, 1973, 
Hunt told the Committee that less than 
an hour after the Wallace shooting he got 
a call from top Presidential counsel 
Charles Colson, who ordered him to 
break into Bremer's Milwaukee apart-
ment. The Washington Post tells it this 
way: "Colson told Hunt to bring back 
information from the apartment ... link-
ing Bremer to left-wing political causes, 
according to the accounts." 
In other words, Colson was ordering 
Hunt to strip Bremer's apartment of any 
evidence Bremer might have left there, 
showing who had recruited him to mur-
der George Wallace. This would certainly 
have included any ties to Bremer's "boss" 
Dennis Cossini, the Maoist who turned 
out to be a C.I.A. operative. 
According to the accounts, Hunt told 
Colson that it would take at least four 
hours for him to get from Washington to 
the Milwaukee apartment, which would 
have been too late to grab the evidence 
before the F.B.I. began to search. So the 
proposed expedition never took place. 
Colson at first denied having issued such 
orders, but he admitted that immediately 
thereafter he got in touch with Assistant 
F.B.I. Director W. Mark Felt. And in the 
New York Times of July 13, 1973, 
former White House aide Douglas Hallett 
fills us in: 
Mr. Colson says he was charged 
by the President with assuring 
F.B.I. protection for Bremer and 
his apartment; that, in fact, he had 
the apartment cordoned off right 
after the shooting. The former assis-
tant director of the Bureau, Mark 
Felt, can back up these claims. 
All of which explains a strange devel-
opment mentioned in your reporter's 
expose of the Wallace shooting in AMER-
ICAN OPINION for October 1972. In 
that piece I quoted Chicago Tribune 
reporters Ronald Koziol and John. 
O'Brien, who arrived at Bremer's apart-
ment soon after the shooting and "found 
that Federal Bureau of Investigation 
agents had come and gone, leaving the 
place unguarded .... the FBI agents re-
turned a few hours later and only then 
began putting evidence into boxes." 
While they were gone, swarms of 
"local people" removed just about all 
the evidence in the apartment. Could it 
be that this totally untypical and unpro-
fessional behavior on the part of the 
F.B.I. was the result of Colson's call to 
W. Mark Felt? What other explanation is 
there? Indeed, it is interesting to note 
that in 1970, F.B.I. Director J. Edgar 
Hoover refused to endorse the Nixon 
Administration's original scheme for po-
litical surveillance, and that he suddenly 
died on the night of May 1, 1972 � the 
international Communist holiday � only 
two weeks before Governor Wallace was 
shot, and only six weeks before the 
phony Watergate raid. We are told that 
Hoover died of natural causes, which is 
possible, but unfortunately there was no 
autopsy to prove it. In fact the body 
had been wrapped in a sheet, thrown in 
the back of a waiting car, and rushed 
from the Hoover home before a careful 
investigation could be made at the death 
scene. 
The Nelsongator 
In your reporter's opinion, Watergate 
amounts to nothing more than a sophisti-
cated gang fight, the prize in which is not 
1929 Chicago, but the whole world. 
It is interesting to note that the same 
kept national press which did everything 
to get Richard Nixon re-elected is now 
leading the attempt to tear him apart. 
And the beneficiary appears to be top 
conspirator Nelson Rockefeller, who in 
your reporter's opinion has long been 
Richard Nixon's benefactor and superior. 
It was Nelson Rockefeller in New York 
whom Republican Presidential nominee 
Richard Nixon travelled to see from the 
1960 G.O.P. Convention in Chicago, in 
order to get the Rockefeller platform 
which Nixon substituted for the one the 
delegates had written. It was into Rocke-
feller's Fifth Avenue apartment building 
that Nixon later moved: and it was a 
Rockefeller law firm that paid him more 
than $200,000 a year to make speeches 
after he had apparently been finished by 
his loss to Pat Brown in the race for 
Governor of California. It is also Rocke-
feller men who are now replacing the 
Nixonites on their way from the White 
House to jail. For instance, Leonard 
Garment, who has replaced John Ehrlich. 
man and John Dean, has long been a 
Rockefeller man. So is General Alexander 
Haig, a protege of Rockefeller's man 
Henry Kissinger, who replaces H.R. Hal-
deman. And so is Elliot Richardson, our 
new Attorney General, who supervise! 
the Justice Department's Watergate inves 
ligation. As Michael Kramer put it in :

AMERICAN OPINION 
SEPTEMBER, 19 73

Approved for Release: 2017/01/18 C01482376 
recent issue of New York magazine: 
"... To hear the Governor's advisers tell 
it, Watergate was ordained by the gods so 
that Nelson Rockefeller could capture the 
Republican Presidential nomination in 
�1976 ...." 
Was it really ordained by the gods � or 
by Nelson Rockefeller himself? Is Rocke-
feller really the man behind the exposure 
of Watergate, by way of double agents 
planted in the Nixon machinery? Is 
Rockefeller trying once again to satisfy 
his quadrennial ambition to be President, 
so that he can run the show openly as 
well as in secret? Already we see a 
plethora of planted items in the national 
press, indicating that Nelson Rockefeller 
is once again available. And syndicated 
columnist Paul Scott suggests that the 
plan apparently was to force Nixon to 
resign, after which Spiro Agnew, a former 
head of the Rockefeller for President 
Committee, would use the Presidential 
succession amendment ratified in 1967 to 
appoint his benefactor as Vice President. 
This of course would give Rockefeller a 
long headstart toward the nomination for 
President in 1976. 
That year 1976 is an important one. It 
has long appeared that it is the year the 
Conspiracy of super-rich Establishment 
Insiders had selected to consolidate dicta-
torship over all the world. And along 
these lines, it is also interesting to note 
that for years Nelson Rockefeller and his 
brothers have been defending and fi-
nancing the Communists � whom the 
Conspiracy created to serve as its flunk-
ies. Nelson Rockefeller, for instance, is 
the man who, in 1945, concealed the 
evidence given him by the F.B.I. which 
proved that U.N. founder Alger Hiss was 
in fact a Soviet spy; the man who has 
been an intimate, lifelong associate of 
Venezuelan Communist Romulo Betan-
court; the man who did everything he 
could to support the Communist activi-
ties of Martin Luther King. Indeed, in-
telligence expert Frank Cape11 reports in 
the June, 1973, issue of The Herald Of 
Freedom that, according to former C.I.A. 
research analyst R. Harris Smith, during 
the Eisenhower Administration General 
Walter Bedell Smith, then head of the 
C.I.A., warned the President that "Rocke-
feller is a Communist." 
And, as I write, Nelson's brother 
David, who runs the conspiratorial Coun-
cil on Foreign Relations, has just returned 
from a visit to Mao Tse-tung, the mass 
murderer for whom David Rockefeller is 
trying to arrange "most-favored-nation" 
status � which would facilitate the trans-
fer of our wealth to Red China. David 
Rockefeller's bank will now handle Mao's 
banking business in the United States, 
and the Maoist Government will have 
direct official ties with David Rocke-
feller's Council on Foreign Relations. 
All of which should surprise no one 
who knows that Communism is simply a 
tool of a small gang of incredibly wealthy 
totalitarians who are trying to enslave 
US. 
The Proof Of A Conspiracy 
Destructive though the manufactured 
Watergate scandal is, Americanists can 
nevertheless use it to advantage. For years 
we have patiently been warning that there 
is a Conspiracy in Washington, the goal of 
which is to destroy our Constitution and 
our rights. And for years we have been 
told hysterically that we are crazy. For 
years we have been criticized for recom-
mending the impeachment, for instance, 
of Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl 
Warren, who made a shambles of our 
Constitution. But now the word "conspir-
acy" is On the front page of our daily 
newspaper � which is always the last to 
know � and the same people who called 
us crazy are demanding the impeachment 
of the President. 
Watergate is a dramatic opportunity 
for Americanists to expose the Conspir-
acy fully, which is the only way to 
remove the conspirators and preserve our 
form of government and our rights, while 
there is still time. � �
