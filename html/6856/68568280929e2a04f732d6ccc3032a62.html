 Not all its covert actions have succeeded, but the
 agency did manage to outfox Congressional investigators.
 2V WaVE90lT M1-RMOTM
 There have been enough revelations about the Central Intelligence
 Agency over the past two years to keep diplomats, prosecutors, reporters and
 philosophers busy for entire careers. Three separate investigations not only
 stretched the imagination with show-biz material about cobra venom and
 deadly skindiving suits but twisted the lens on the American self-image in
 foreign affairs. The investigations rewrote history-the history, for example,
 of the relationship between the United States and the Castro Government
 in Cuba. They showed that the C.I.A., in some 900 foreign interventions
 over the past two decades, has run secret wars around the globe and has
 clandestinely dominated foreign governments so thoroughly as to make
 them virtual client states. In contrast to Watergate, the C.I.A. investiga-
 tions proved that abuses of power have not been limited to one particular
 Administration or one political party. They also established facts that few
 people were prepared to believe-such as that distinguished gentlemen
 from the C.I.A. hatched assassination plots with Mafia gangsters.
 With all these surprises percolating, the most interesting surprise has
 been largely ignored. And that is how the C.I.A. investigations ceased. The
 topic faded away so quickly as to make the whole episode look like a fad.
 Unlike the F.B.I. issue, which has moved to the prosecutors' offices and
 stayed on the front page, the vaunted trial of the C.I.A. has already become
 a memory. And the agency itself has survived the scandals with its covert
 operations intact, if not strengthened.
 The collapse of the C.I.A. investigations has been due largely to in-
 eptitude, poor judgment and lack of will on the part of the Congressional
 committees. But the agency also played a role. Its strategy was flawless.
 "Those guys really knew what they were doing," says a staff member of
 the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence chaired by Frank Church. "I
 think they defended themselves just like any other agency would, except
 they're better. They had a whole office set up to deal with us, and I some-
 times had the feeling that they ran operations against us like they run them
 against foreign governments. It was like the C.I.A.' station for the Congress
 instead of for Greece or Vietnam." The story of how they came out ahead of
 their investigators says a great deal about both the Congress and the agency,
 and about the problem of reconciling the demands of the superspy with the
 democracy he is supposed to protect.
 In the spring -of 1975, the Church committee had been spinning its,
 wheels for several months without much success. Charged with the task of
 investigating more than a dozen intelligence
 agencies, any one of which' was an enormous
 challenge, the Senators became cnsnarled in
 debate over how to proceed. The agencies
 were stalling, hoping to deflect attention else-
 where. 't'hen the committee got a break.

 under Vice President Rockefeller that January, , to inquire into charges of
 illegal domestic spying by the C.I.A., announced that it had received
 evidence of, C.I.A. involvement in attempts to kill foreign leaders. The news
 created an instant sensation. Rockefeller said his commission, which was
 completing its work, had neither the time nor the mandate to pursue
 the matter, and he turned the evidence over to President Ford, who quickly
 passed it along to the Church committee. Suddenly, the Senators found
 themselves with a large batch of classified documents and with responsi-
 bility for the hottest issue since Watergate.
 For five months last year, the Church committee focused its energy
 on assassinations. Other investigations lapsed. Staff members were pulled
 from other projects. While it is no mean feat in the Senate to obtain sus-
 tained, personal effort from Senators on any single subject, the members of
 the Church committee went to C.I.A. briefings day after day to be intro-
 duced to the agency's arcane methods. In November 1975, the committee
 published an interim report on this one aspect, and Senators and staff alike
 were proud of it. As an exploration of the Machiavellian underside of
 American foreign policy, it was, in fact, a tour de force. Yet it failed to
 build public support for investigating or controlling the C.I.A.
 Press and TV coverage was intense but shortlived, focusing on certain
 salacious details: the gangster plots, the titillating reports of. an affair
 between President Kennedy and the mistress of one of the gangsters, and
 terest was down. Assassina-
 tions proved peripheral to the
 main business of C.I.A. covert
 action, and the investigation
 of that unknown realm had
 scarcely  begun.  With  in-
 vestigations of the other intel-
 ligence agencies, including the
 F.B.I., still ahead of them, five
 crucial months had been lost
 -along with much of the
 committee's momentum. The

 of secrecy oaths that they

 was Chile-a selection favora-
 ble to the agency, since a lot
 of material on the C.I.A.'s in-
 tervention in Chile had al-
 ready leaked to the press:
 "It was a bad deal," says
 F.A.O. Schwarz, the commit-
 . tee's chief counsel. Many of
 the principal staff members
 opposed the settlement. What
 little they had learned about
 covert action in the course of
 the  assassination investiga-
 tion had made them realize its
 was one of the hardest but
 also one of the most important
 issues to deal with. "That i$
 why we went so heavily into
 Mongoose in the assassina-
 tion  report,"  Schwarz ex-
 plains.
 Operation Mongoose was a
 covert action designed  to
 weaken and destroy the Cas-
 tro regime through an orches-
 trated program of economic
 sabotage,  commando  raids
 .and paramilitary harassment.
 It was the heart of the agen-
 cy's effort to overthrow Cas-
 tro; simultaneous' assassina-
 tion attempts complemented
 Mongoose rather than vice
 versa. Although the campaign
 failed, it was kept so secret
 that the American public was
 left with a fundamentally dis-
 torted view'of United States-
 Cuba relations for more than
 a decade.
 Before the committee's re-
 port, it was generally accepted
 that the Kennedy Administra-
 tion ceased hostilities against
 Castro after the Bay of Pigs,
 until forced to act defensively
 by the unprovoked introduc-
 tion of Russian missiles on
 Cuban soil. The Church com-
 mittee revealed that not only
 were there repeated attempts
 on Castro's life before and
 after the missile crisis but
 covert Mongoose raids were
 being intensified throughout
 the period. The assassination
 report quotes the minutes of
 high-level meetings, less than
 two weeks before the missile
 crisis,  at  which  Attorney
 General     Robert   Kennedy
 spurred the C.I.A. on to hit
 Castro harder.
 The      assassination report,
 outside    sources generally
 agree, was the high point of
 the committee's investigation.
 After that, the staff divided
 into two groups, one known
 informally as "the lawyers"-.
 a group of attorneys drawn
 together largely by Schwarz
 -and  the  other  as  "the
 professors," who were gener-

 task - force leader William
 Bader, the "professors" be-
 came responsible for the C.I.A.
 investigation, while .the "law-
 yers"  went  off  after  the
 F.B.I. Frictions developed be-
 tween the two groups, the
 Bader group tending to criti-
 cize  the  lawyers  as  too
 prosecutorial and "Watergate-
 minded," and the Schwarz
 team hinting that the Bader
 group was too soft in its
 handling of the C.I.A.'s pros..
 In any event, discouraged by
 the covert-action compromise,
 the "professors" never recov-
 ered the initiative.
 n the House, the Select
 Committee on Intelli-
 gence chaired by Otis
 Pike-the  counterpart
 of the' Church committee-
 pursued an arduous and in-
 dependent  course.                                             Created
 only after a long internecine
 squabble over its leadership,
 its mandate weakened by con-
 tinuing- feuds in the House,
 the   committee   struggled
 through the summer of 1975
 to breathe life into itself-
 seeking, on one occasion, to
 justify its existence- by leak-
 ing the sensational but un-
 verified story that Nixon aide
 Alexander  Butterfield  had
 been a C.I.A. "plant" in thel
 White House. The story was
 refuted, leaving the committee
 with less credibility than ever.
 By fall, the traditional jealousy
 between the House and the
 'Senate had flared up behind
 the scenes, and Mitchell Ro-
 govin, negotiating with both
 committees, was finding them
 competitive. "Church," says
 Rogovin, "held his `,toxin hear-
 ings' because he was afraid
 Pike would do it if he didn't."
 By December, the House and
 .Senate committees were set on
 opposite courses. Pike wanted
 to impale the C.I.A. for its
 abuses.  Church  wanted  to
 show that a Senate committee
 could handle national secrets
 responsibly. The Ford Admini-
 stration played the commit-
 tees against each other. When
 Pike demanded  information
 and denounced "delaying tac-
 tics," Administration spokes-
 men would point to the ex-
 emplary behavior of the Church
 committee and appeal for a,
 more cooperative spirit. When
 the Church committee cooper-
 aced, the Administration tended
 to see it as a sign of weakness
 and feel freer to hold back
 on information. Secretary of
 State  Henry  Kissinger  and
 C.I.A. director William   E.
 Colby simply boycotted all
 the  covert-action hearings,
 and the conunittee accepted
 the rebuff instead of subpoe-
 naing them.
 "The object of the exercise,"
 says a Church committee staff
 we were not Pike. We were
 not going to move the Con-
 gress or the public by more
 expose. What was going to
 'carry us was the kind of edi-
 torial we finally got in The
 Washington Post: `An Intelli-
 gent  Approach  to  Intelli-
 gence."' The committee evi-
 denced an increasing aware-
 ness of its public image, of
 its ability to keep secrets.
 avoid leaks and work in some
 semblance of public harmony
 . with the C.I.A. Many on the
 committee staff endorsed this
 approach as the path toward
 "establishing a relationship"
 that would serve the Congres-
 sional committee that was to
 be set up to exercise over-
 sight-supervision of the in-
 telligence agencies. Some of
 these investigators have, in
 fact, moved on to jobs with
 the oversight committee, now
 in business. Their attitude was
 infectious: Even today, many
 former  Church  committee
 staff members are more reti-
 cent in discussing C.I.A. mat-
 ters than C.I.A. officials them-
 selves.
 n Dec. 24, a band of
 unknown  terrorists
 assassinated  Rich-
 ard Welch, the C.I.A.
 chief of station in Greece.
 Welch had been identified as
 a C.I.A. official by a small
 anti-C.I.A. magazine, and a
 .furor immediately arose over
 whether the revelation had
 anything to do with his death.
 The Senators on the Church
 committee received a flood of
 letters denouncing its work on
 the grounds that exposure of
 C.I.A. secrets is an invitation
 to the killing of C.I.A. offi-
 cials.
 Sources on both sides of the
 C.I.A. investigation now agree
 that neither the magazine nor
 the  Church  committee  is
 likely to have caused Welch's
 death. He was a relatively
 well-known figure in Athens,
 certainly to the kind of organ-
 ized political groups likely to
 have killed him. These proba-
 bilities  were  overwhelmed,
 however, by the emotional
 power of the tragedy, and the
 C.I.A. encouraged the idea
 that C.I.A. critics might have
 contributed indirectly to the
 murder. Rogovin would only
 tell  the.  Church  committee
 that   its  own investigations
 were not "directly" responsi-
 ble. Colby lashed out in public'
 at those who revealed C.I.A.
 secrets as being more sinister
 than the secrets themselves.
 Ford made public statements
 to th,,e  effect that inquiries
 into  C.I.A.  methods  were
 unpatriotic.
 No single event (lid more toa
 turn  1 uh!it: opiY ion  at `Hirst
 the  investigatae its  than the
 Welch affair. As 1975 ended,
 the press was shying away
 from ,the C.I.A.,issue, and ?huy-
 tility toward the inquiry was
 building up-in Congress itself.
 As  to  the  C.I.A.'s  private
 thoughts on whether naming
 senior officials makes them
 more vulnerable to "the other
 side," a move that escaped
 public attention may provide
 some insight: Welch was re-
 placed in Athens by a man
 who had been identified as a
 C.I.A. official. by Greek news-
 papers  and  an  American
 -magazine.
 On Jan. 29, 1976, Represent-
 ative John Young, Democrat
 of Texas, offered a motion on
 the House floor to suppress
 the final report of the Pike
 committee. The ensuing de-
 bate was not distinguished.
 Some speakers argued that
 the report-which they admit-
 ted they had not read --
 would endanger national se-
 curity and align the House
 with the murderers of Richard
 Welch.  Others, like Wayne
 Hays, argued for suppression
 on the grounds that the report
 would be boring: "I suspect
 that when this report
 comes out it is going to be
 the biggest nonevent since
 Brigitte Bardot, after 40 years
 and four husbands and nurrer--
 ous lovers, held a press con-
 ference to armounce that she
 was  no  longer  a  virgin."
 Views like these prevailed,
 and the House, by a vote of
 246 to 124, ordered its own
 report to be locked away in
 the clerk's safe.
 The document did not re-
 main suppressed very long. it
 was leaked to CBS co.rres-
 ?pondent Daniel Schorr, who in
 turn leaked it to The Vilage
 Voice through a series of inter-
 mediaries. When The Voice
 published the report in two
 special supplements under ban-
 ner headlines, it became the
 most spectacular leak of the
 C.I.A. investigations.
 Pike developed two themat-
 ic  criticisms  of  the  C.I.A.
 First, he amassed evidence of
 repeated intelligence failures,
 showing how the agency had
 failed to anticipate such major
 world events as the 1968 Tct
 offensive in Vietnam, the Rus-
 sian invasion of Czechoslova-
 kia the same year, and the
 1973 Yom Kippur war in the
 Middle East.  Citing various
 bureaucratic   entanglements
 and   preoccupations  as  the
 cause of poor performance,
 Pike took the agency to task
 for bunging the one function

 SNYD.ER: What  if Jimmy Carter is elected  in November?

 of me.   And    I'll  tell  you why.   I don't believe the agency or the
 Director of CIA,      Director of Central  Intelligence or  the head of
 CIA should be partisan.   But  I do believe strongly -that-whoever
 heads the intelligence community,   the Director of Central  Intelli-
 gence, must have                    the confidence of the President.   He can't serve
 intelligence well  if he doesn't.   And  the President is  ill-served
 if he can't have confidence    in what  the Director  is telling him.
 And so there is a certain compatibility separate and
 apart  from politics  that is  in  the national   interest.   And so-what
 happens,  I don't know.   And  I really think it's   far less important
 than whether  this community stays  strong,  the     intelligence community.
 And so  I would say "Mr.  President,  any time you want  to get a new
 man in here,  please proceed so to do."   And  I don't think that is.
 making partisan a nonpartisan     job.   It's  simply my conception. of hoI4
 government ought to operate.
 SNYDER: I don't have historicity in my head as  to
 what happens when a President of a different party comes  into
 office.   Do you remember what happened....
 SNYDER:   Yes.   When Johnson came in, or when Johnson
 left and Nixon came in.
 DIRECTOR BUSH:   Well,  Dulles  -- Dulles was  eventually
 replaced by Kennedy.   There was a little period of          time.   I mean
 President Kennedy replaced....
 SNYDER:   Replaced Allen Dulles.
 DIRECTOR BUSH:   ...Allen Dulles.   I can't -- I'll be

 DIRECTOR BUSH:   But  I don't remember.     I  thought you
 were talking about turnovers.   I.can't....
 SNYDER:   No, I'm just wondering.   The minute  Kennedy
 took office  from a Republican, Eisenhower,  did        you  fire  the  CIA
 Director?                                     .-
 DIRECTOR BUSH                                  No, no.
 SNYDER:   I  don't  think      so.
 DIRECTOR BUSH:   No, no, no,   no.
 SNYDER:   And.when Nixon    took it from the   Democrat,  Mr.
 Johnson,  did he     fire  the CIA Director?
 DIRECTOR BUSH:   No.   But  in fairness....
 SNYDER:   And I'm not  trying  to dictate....
 DIRECTOR BUSH:   No',  but  in  fairness,  Tom,  there  has
 never  been a  Director  who   has   had  as  active  a  political  past as
 I have.   And  so    just  as I understood    the  debate  on my  nomination
 before  the   Senate,   I would  understand  a  review of. my position,  if-
 for  no other            reason  than because  I  had    been    actively   involved on  the

 SNYDER:   You mentioned  that you  feel  it's proper that
 11    Carter,  the  Democratic         nominee, be briefed  on certain.iitems.
 Who decides how much he will be            told?
 DIRECTOI BUSH:   Well, in the  final analysis,  the President.
 The   President's  instructions        to me, as  head  of  the'intelligence  com-
 munity,        is                 the determining     factor.   But the President took a very
 broad view. He     said  I  think  that  it's most  important  that  the
 that Governor Carter be given intelligence briefings.   But     then
 I worked  out,  as the   designee of  the  President,       with Governor   Carter
 the parameters of the briefings.         And we decided  that  they should
 'be'on intelligence,  that they should     stay away,from policy and that  -
 they  should          stay away  from sources and methods, which is  a certain
 code for  the things  I          am  to protect under  the law.   Governor Carter
 recognized that  he  didn't need  to     know at       this  juncture  the sources
 and methods of the intelligence.         And  so our briefings-have consisted
 of-finished  intelligence.      I,'ve attended 'the. two  briefings  on'intel-
 ligence,  and  fortunately fore him with me went  some of our very top
 experts in the areas  that he'was  interested  in.        And we're not
 holding back.   The  President  has made      clear to me he wants   Governor
 Carter  fully briefed, and    this  is   what we're doing.   And  the bene-
 ficiary is  the                United States  of  America.
 SNYDER:                    Now  in  the  briefings  --  and  if you can't  say,
 you  will just  say  "I  can't  say."    I,understand  because  I'm a neo-
 phyte  and I               don't  want to  get  into  areas of great     sensitivity.
 But do  you brief. the opposition  candidate  on methodology, per-
 sonnel,  location,                  or  do you brief him on   things  that  are  happening
 currently incountries,where we operate intelligence installations?-
 DIRECTOR BUSH:                                It's` the  latter.   We don't  go  into metho-
 dology.  Sources                      and methods of intelligence we don't go into.
 SNYDER:                     Like  in country "X,"   Mr. "A"  is doing such and
 such  to make sure   that  political .Ir.  "B"  will   not  advance.   That
 kind  of  thing?
 DIRECTOR BUSH:   No.                    We don'.t  go  into  the  source or
 method'. What  we go  into  is  here's  the      way one conceives  the
 strength of  the  Soviet Union,  for example,   where  it's  up     against
 NATO, you  know' Or,  here's    what we  think  that   might  happen in
 China after  Chairman  Mao  passes  on..   Or,  here's a  current Intel--
 1'igen'ce briefing.                  Here's the  status of what might be goin-o
 in some area,  maybe  the Middle'East    or  Africa, or   wherevergitnis.
 SNYDER:            I        understand.
 DI:RIsCTUP, BUs11:                We  stay out   of   policy. We  give  him
 intelligence.  We  respond  to  questions.      And  I  hope its  working

 to-his satisfaction.   The people at th.e CIA,  the professionals
 with whom I work,        feel  that the briefings have gone reasonably
 well.
 SNYDER:   Will there be more before the election?
 DIRECTOR BUSH:   That. depends  on what  Governor  Carter
 feels he requires.
 SNYDER:   I see.   Now what....
 DIRECTOR BUSH:   The President has authorized me to give
 him what he needs in terms of intelligence briefings.
 SNYDER:   Has he asked  for anything you wouldn't    tell him?
 DIRECTOR BUSH:    Now, Tom, you're getting into....
 SNYDER:   I understand.
 DIRECTOR BUSH:   No, I  don't  think  so.   I don't think
 he has.   No.  And  I don't think we had any differences with the
 `Governor.
 SNYDER:   What arrangement is there,  though,  and  I'm cer-
 tain there must be some,               between the President and Governor Carter
 in terms of using information supplied by yourself and your associates
 as. campaign issue or campaign speechmaking source?
 DIRECTOR BUSH:   Well,  I don't -- I don't --- if there is
 some arrangement that  they've discussed,  something between them of
 that nature  -- certainly I've       not been any intermediary on  that  kind
 .of an arrangement.   I don't expect that kind of an arrangement exists.
 I think that any recipient of highly classified  intelligence in the
 position of Governor and certainly the President recognizes he's
 dealing with sensitive information.   And  I don't expect there will
 be an abuse of this information.
 But  should  that have been discussed, it hasn't been dis-
 cussed with me,                 nor  should  it be. That would be an arrangement, a
 policy kind  of a  thing  that  would  be worked  out elsewhere.   But  I
 don't believe      there's such an arrangement.

 A
 charges of bank robbery, and who
 wound up, in an ironic turn of the
 story, working briefly for the Interna-
 tional Rescue Committee of which
 '?Cherne was chairman of the board.
 . Early last year Casey persuaded the
 1los Angeles Times to send him and
 ,two st.aff reporters to Hong Kong at a
 reported cost of $15,000 for a prom-
 ised rendezvous  with  Hearst.  The
 newspaper subsequently described the
 episode as a hoax. Casey, acknowl-
 edged that,the Hearst trip "bummed
 out."
 Casey's career also encompassed a
 tiine-month period as director of spe-
 :cial projects for Boys Town, the Ne-
 -braska community started by Father,
 Flanigan, from which he was fired in
 a dispute with the administration over.
 the alleged theft of 3l files for *an
 MGM television production. (`.'One of
 my jobs," he said, "was to get them
 publicity.")
 When Cherne found out who had
 turned up with his notebook, lie noti-
 fied the intelligence staff and was
 advised "to play it down and not make
 it appear to,be important." The initial
 judgment was that the loss was not
 of great security significance.
 Cherne  maintains  that  he  first
 learned that Casey was employed in
 the Los Angeles office of the Inter-
 national Rescue Committee as a con-
 sultant during an Aug. 22, 1975,'phone
 conversation with him.  "i said,  'I
 don't think terribly much about you'
 association with IRC and when I de-
 cide finally, I'll ask. for your. resigna-
 tion.'
 The green notebook was returned
 on Aug. 2G, 1975, and Cherne turned
 it over to. the intelligence, staff. Three
 weeks later he called Casey and asked
 for h:s resignation.  "He submitted
 cheerfully, always cheerfully," Cherne
 reminisced.
 On Sept.. -2 Casey sent a Mailgram
 to the p_csiding judge in the Heist
 case, Oliver J. Carter, in the name of
 the IBC.
 "We, p.?ayfully request that Patricia
 Hearst be admitted to bail." the tele-
 grams read.  "Picasv  consider  that
 Patty  Hearst was directly and Indi-
 rectly i esponsible rror the, safe cvacua-

 By Laurence Stern
 Wasnlnufo i Post Staff Writer
 Leo Cherne, one of President Ford's
 chief intelligence advisers, . is a cen-
 tral' figure in a 'justice Department
 national security investigation that i>i
 being described by federal officials as
 "the green book affair."
 The green book is a government
 note pad in. which a staff aide to
 Cherne recorded briefings with diplo-
 matic and intelligence officers during
 a trip to Europe in March, 1975.
 Cherne is chairman of the Presi-
 dent's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
 Board and a member of the newly
 :formed  three-member  Intelligence
 Oversight Board.
 The notebook, officially described
 .as having contained "classified infor-
 mation.  . injurious to. the national
 security of the United States," disap-
 peared immediately after Cherne and
 his aide, Cmdr. Lionel H. Olmer, re-
 turned from the European trip.
 Here the plot thickens. Olmer. an
 intelligence officer during his entire
 "19-year naval career, says he, has no
 idea how the little green notebook got
 out of his possession. He ? is described
 by associates as an extremely meticu-
 lous professional experienced in the
 '.handling of classified material.
 'Within several hours after his ar-
 rival at his Rockville,: ] Id.. home, he
 called _ Wheaton. Byers, executive see-
 retary-of the Foreign ,Intelligence Ad-
 visory. Board and advised him of the
 notebook's disappearance' 'he' said yes-
 terday.. An  investigation was con?
 ducted and the notebook was. pre-
 sumed lost when the aircraft cabin
 was cleaned.
 The mystery was  solved-to' the
 greater consternation of :Cherne and.
 Olmer-on July 24, 1975, when the in-
 telligence adviser  received  a tele-
 phone call from Michael James Casey
 of Los Angeles.
 "He said, 'I have your notebook,' "
 Cherne recounted yesterday in de-
 scribing what he called a "14-month
 ordeal."
 It was during this and subsequent
 telephone conversations that Cherne
 learned that Casey had served two
 years at Soleclad prison near Sall
 Francisco., Casey. further , explained
 that he had recovered the notebook'
 from sympathizers of Patricia Hearst,
 who was then at }are.
 Casey contended that the finders of
 the notebook had hoped that. 'it "might
 be exchanged for considerations in
 their behalf and I -told him that 1
 wouldn't do  it:  even  if I  could,"
 Cherne said.
 Casey, in  a tctepiioitb  interview
 from Omaha. wh re lie was acquitted

 .group whose counterattack helped
 to plunge the FBI into crisis.   '
 The bureau had been pursuing the
 SWP since 1938 without producing
 any evidence of wrongdoing by the
 party or its members.
 The FBI's activities caused the SWP
 In 1973 to file what has become a $40
 million lawsuit against the bureau and
 other federal law enforcement agenc-
 ies, charging them with illegal harass-
 ment and intimidation.
 As a result of evidence uncovered
 by the lawsuit, the Justice Department
 has been conducting a seven-month
 Investigation into allegations that the
 FBI carried out widespread illegal
 burglaries against suspected "extrem-
 ists" during the past five years.
 Justice Department spokesmen con-
 firmed that the FBI had been ordered
 to stop investigating the SWP after it
 was learned yesterday that, the depart-
 rnent had sent letters to the SWP and
 to Judge Thomas P. Griesa, who is
 hearing the suit in U.S. District Court
 in New York, notifying them of the
 action.
 The spokesmen said Attorney Gen-
 eral Edward H. Levi had issued the
 -order following a "systematic review"
 .of how recently issued guidelines cov-
 ering domestic security investigations
 apply to the SWP and its youth' affili-
 ate, the Young Socialist Alliance.
 The spokesmen insisted that Levi's
 decision came in the course of review-
 ing the cases of all political groups
 under investigation by the FBI and
 had no connection with the still pend-
 ing lawsuit.                       '
 Levi's guidelines stipulate that' the
 FBI can investigate an organization or
 individual only if it has evidence that
 they have been engaged in some spe-
 cific Illegal act.. The guidelines bar the
 FBI from maintaining surveillance of
 a group solely for the purposes of
 gathering intelligence or because it
 suspects that the members might do
 something illegal.
 FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley
 also released a statement last night,

 An inquisitive American learns many things on a
 visit to Cuba. One of the most surprising is that high
 officials in Havana seem genuinely hopeful that the
 investigation of the Kennedy assassination will be re-
 opened. They are convinced that there was a Cuban
 -factor in the murder.
 - Conversations with senior officials of the Cuban
 government, including Deputy Prime Minister Carlos
 Rafael Rodriguez, make clear that they have followed
 closely the disclosures by the Senate Intelligence
 Committee casting doubt upon the Warren Commis-
 sion investigation: The Cubans are well aware that the
 doubts center on the failure of the CIA and the FBI to
 inform the Warren Commission of the several plots
 mounted by the CIA to kill Fidel Castro. Knowledge
 of these plots appears to have been withheld even
 from the FBI and CIA officials who were responsible
 for investigating the President's murder and for sup-
 porting the work of the Warren Commission. As a re-
 sult, there was no special effort to explore the possi-
 ble involvement of either the Cuban government or.
 Cuban exiles in the assassination. Evidence developed
 by the Senate committee makes both hypotheses plau-
 sible-and a new inquiry imperative.        -
 The situation is murkier and more perplexing than
 ever. Those who are resistant to conspiracy theories
 and who have been prepared-ever: eager -to be-

 adequate prop for their predilections. The commis-
 sion did not know that on Nov. 22, 1963, at about the
 very. hour Oswald struck in Dallas, an agent of the
 Central Intelligence Agency was meeting with a rank-
 ing Cuban official (code-named AMLASH and re-
 cently identified as Rolando Cubela) to plan the mur-
 der of Castro. Simultaneously, in Cuba. a French re-
 porter, Jean Daniel,,was spending the day with Cas-
 tro, conveying to the Cuban leader views expressed
 by President     edy in a brief interview at the
 White House-on, Oct. V:, persuading Castro that Ken-
 nedy wanted to explore ways to normalize relations.
 Thus, at,the. moment. the President was killed, U.S.
 policy toward Cuba appeared to be moving not only
 on two tracks but in opposite directions, and rtwvo-
 ment on'dithertrack could have provoked violent re-
 sponse by one or another Cuban faction.
 ,perceptions inside the Cuban government re-
 sponded to both tendencies, in U.S. policy. There is
 good reason to suspect that the AMLASH operation
 involved a double agent, or at least a singularly inept
 one. Castro almost certainly knew of it. The CIA even-
 tually concluded that the AMLASH activity was "inse-
 cure" and terminated it. Among other discoveries,
 within two days of the assassination it was known (but
 not., to the Warren Commission) that AMLASII had
 been in contact. with Soviet personnel in Mexico City,

 facts are significar.t or merely coincidental, one can-
 not 'tell. In retrospect, Cuban authorities note with
 some relief that Oswald was denied permission to visit
 a
 the finger of suspicion would surely have pointe
 Havana.
 Perhaps more suggestive of a direct leak from AM-
 LASH to Castro was the sequence of events on Sept. 7,
 1983, when the CIA re-established contact with the Cu-
 ban conspirator for the first time since the preceding
 year. Late that evening, Prime Minister Castro called
 in Associated Press reporter Daniel Harker for an un-
 expected interview. Only three Western reporters
 were based in Havana at the time and their contact
 with Castro was quite limited. Evidently, the Cuban
 leader had a message he wished to get on the record
 through Harker. He charged that the United States
 was aiding terrorist plots in Cuba and warned U.S.
 leaders that "if they are aiding terrorist plans to elimi-
 nate Cuban leaders, they themselves will not be safe."
 This threat of reprisals seems less inflammatory
 and more understandable now that we know what
 Castro knew at the time, namely, that the United
 States was in fact'stepping up its covert operations
 against Cuba during the summer and fall of 1963. Yet
 it seems an exception to the main lines of Cuban pol-
 icy as it was then evolving.
 For months afer the missile crisis of 1962, Castro
 had been displeased with the Soviets, and there are
 signs that he' was interested in an opening to Wash-
 ington. On Sept. 5, the Cubans quietly proposed talks
 with the Americans at the United Nations, and Ken-
 nedy soon responded with interest. Also, in early Sep-
 tember the Time magazine bureau chief in Buenos
 Aires, Gavin Scott, travelling on a Canadian passport,,
 spent two weeks in, Cuba. Although key U.S. officials
 have no recollection of consulting with Scott on that
 occasion, the Cubans recall his questions and com-
 ments as hinting of American interest in a possible ac-.
 commodation, much as they were later to interpret.
 the discussions between Jean Daniel and Castro.
 Then and now.the Cubans' attitude toward Ken-
 nedy has been a compound of political antipathy and-
 personal admiration. While critical of Kennedy's role
 in various counter-revolutionary efforts, Castro and,
 his associates voice a warm, almost affectionate re-
 gard for the President's courage and realism. They
 profess to have seen his death as a grave setback to
 more hopeful relations between the two countries.
 The John Kennedy of 1963 was not, in their judgment,
 the same man who was inaugurated in 1961, but a
 more mature, poised and forward-looking leader with,
 whom they could have done business.
 With this frame of reference, Cuban officials specu-
 late that the real origin of the assassination lies in an-
 ti-Castro circles, with which Oswald also was in touch.
 They emphasize that assassination is incompatible
 with their own revolutionary doctrine and that they
 never contemplated it even against Batista, the pre-
 vious Cuban ruler. And they volunteer the suspicion
 that the recent murders of Sam Giancana and Johnny
 Rosselli, the Mafia figures who consorted with the
 CIA to kill Castro, surely have some connection with
 Cuban exile politics and the Kennedy murder.
 Castro has said publicly that he has no proof "count-,
 er-revolutionary elements" planned the assassination,
 but that is clearly the consensus in Havana. Further
 investigation may still be inconclusive, but, far from,
 seeing it as an impediment to Cuban-American rela-
 lions, the Castro regime welcomes such an inquiry.
 Their curiosity seems greater titan their complicity.

 By Henry S. Bradsher
 Washington Star Staff Writer
 The Ford administration has be-
 come concerned about the extensive
 Soviet program for civil defense and
 the lack of any comparable effort to
 protect the American people in case
 of intercontinental nuclear war.
 The first comprehensive official
 study of the large Soviet civil defense
 program to be made in many years
 is now under way at the CIA and
 elsewhere around town. A National
 Security  Study  Memorandum  is
 being coordinated at the Pentagon
 examining U.S. civil defense needs.
 The NSSM,, pulling together differ-
 ent agencies views in order to arrive
 at a top-level recommendation to the
 President, is due to be completed by
 Sept. 30. It will provide the basis for
 a presidential decision whether to fit
 an expansion of civil defense work
 into the 1978 fiscal year budget.
 But so far the interagency materi-
 . al focused on CIA work has not pro-
 duced a clear picture of the Soviet
 program. There is disagreement on
 whether the preparations to protect
 the Soviet people from nuclear war
 by shelters or evacuation to the
 countryside which are described in
 Russian manuals are being carried
 out.
 THE SOVIET PROGRAM and U.S.
 needs are connected. by apprehen-
 sions of some American military
 analysts that an imbalance in civil
 defense programs would make this
 country vulnerable. In a crisis situa-
 tion, the Kremlin could threaten the
 American people with destruction
 while sheltering its own people, thus
 reducing the U.S. ability to negotiate
 from equal strength, these analysts
 warn.
 But this contention that the mutual
 deterrence "balance of terror" has
 been eroded is questioned by other
 analysts on two grounds.
 One is that a protected population
 could not long survive if its cities
 were destroyed and its air-and crops
 poisoned by fallout, so that protection
 from nuclear explosions might be
 meaningless in the medium or long
 term. The other involves whether the
 Soviet Union really can, or on the
 basis of present intentions will be-
 come able to, protect its people from
 nuclear attack.
 U.S. policy during the 1950s was to
 try to protect cities against bomber
 attack, and the advent of interconti-
 nental missiles led to the backyard
 air raid shelter boom in the early
 1960s. But by the middle '60s official
 doctrine switched under Secretary of
 Defense Robert S. McNamara to an
 TION the findings of people like
 Goure on which such warnings are
 based. A recent study by John M.
 Collins of the Library of Congress's
 Congressional Research Service said
 Soviet plans "are impressive on
 paper (but) how practical they would
 be in practice is problematical." Col-
 lins thought "no U.S. authority as yet
 has  satisfactorily answered  hard
 questions" about the Soviet program.
 One senior administration official
 handling arms control negotiations
 says U. S. Embassy personnel in the
 Soviet Union and travelers have fail-
 ed to see the kind of evidence that
 would be expectable if the paper pro-
 gram really existed as workable civil
 defense protection. A government
 expert on Soviet affairs reports a
 widespread suspicion that little more
 has been done than earmark re-
 sources.
 The main realization which had de-
 veloped in the administration by last
 spring as a result of publicity like the
 House hearings was that not enough
 was known about Soviet civil defense
 efforts. The CIA had not taken a seri-
 ous'look at the subject for more than
 five years - since before the post-
 ABM treaty program expansion that
 Goure detected.
 SO A MULTIAGENCY STUDY
 was commissioned. It should have
 been finished two months ago. In-
 -stead, each draft report had pro-
 duced new doubts about the reliabil-
 ity of available material.
 "The basic problem is that we just
 haven't been putting enough re-
 sources                                                                                  on  this,"  an  informed
 observer commented. "It should be
 possible for the U.S. intelligence
 community to determine whether.
 Soviet shelters and evacuation plans
 and all that really do exist, but the
 subject hasn't been getting enough
 attention so rar."
 The  National  Security  Study
 Memorandum was ordered by the
 White House after the study of Soviet
 efforts had begun. It is being coordi-
 nated in the office of Donald R. Cot-
 ter, an assistant to Secretary of De-
 fense Donald Rumsfeld for atomic
 energy affairs.
 An administration official said the
 NSSM was the result of accumulat-
 ing concern about the U.S. civil
 defense posture rather than any
 specific alarm over what the Soviets
 might be doing.
 But even if a gap is found and a
 threatening imbalance discerned, the
 chances of organizing an effective
 civil defense program in this country
 in anything less than an alt.-out, war
 situation are considered small by
 some informed officials. Therefore,
 the realistic options open to Cotter's
 study team stop somewhere short of

 THE BALTIMORE SUN

 New Delhi (AP)-The
 Indi- an Parliament voted yesterday
 to  invesiigaiie one of Prime
 Minister Indira Gandhi's most
 outspoken critics-Subraman-
 Ian Swarm, aright-wing, oppo-
 sition leader and . a former
 member of the Harvard Uni-
 versity econornics faculty.
 The vote came amid accusa-
 tions from Mrs. Gandhi's ruling
 Congress party and pro-Mos-
 cow Communists that the Unit-
 ed States Central Intelligence
 Agency is aiding the 36-year-
 ,old Mr. Swamy.
 Political sources said the on-
 `precedented investigation could
 cost Mr. Swamy his seat in the
 upper house even though he has
 four years remaining in his
 term.
 According to the govern-
 ment, 'fr. S?,vamy fled to the.
 West in January after evading
 arrest during the 14 months
 since  the  government  pro-
 claimed a national emergency
 "Ind detained many opposition
 leaders.

 but then escaped abroad again,
 opposition sources said.  .
 Ora Mehta,..the minister of
 home affairs, accused Mr. Swa-
 my of carrying out "anti-Indian
 propaganda calculated to bring
 ,lea. The CIA, he said,, was "no help at all."
 SAVAK has been "quite successful" in rounding
 up terrorists in the past, Sabeti said. He expressed
 confidence that the persons responsible for the mur-
 der of three American civilian technicians in Teh-
 ran last Saturday would eventually be caught.
 SAVAK believes the group responsible for the
 killings is the M11ujahidden E Khalq which began?as
 curious mixture of Marxism and Moslem con-
 servatisin. The number of active 'terrorists at large
 in Iran may not exceed 100, Sabeti said.
 The Americans were involved in "Project IBEX,"

 which the U.S. firm of Rockwell International is in-

 Taaesdoy, September 7, 1976     The Washington Star
 One of the storied traits of tyrants is that, no
 matter how impregnable they might seem to be,
 they never feel safe. Is this one of the explana-
 tions for Indira Gandhi's current bid to bury In-
 dian democracy under further layers of parlia-
 mentary and constitutional assent to her one-
 woman rule?
 Otherwise, the Gandhi government's demand
 for substantial new powers would seem to be un-
 necessary. Under the "emergency" authority
 she already claims to have, Mrs. Gandhi over
 the last 14 months has proven herself completely
 capable of jailing thousands of opponents, in
 cluding three dozen legislators, imposing a
 sweeping censorship that suppresses news even
 of parliamentary debate and cowing a once
 proudly independent judiciary. With her major
 critics locked up, resistance to her dictatorial
 course has been pathetically weak, and the
 world's most populous democracy lies dormant.
 And since Mrs. Gandhi's. Congress party enjoys
 commanding parliamentary control, there is no
 question about the government getting whatever
 legislative backing it wants -- including support
 for changing the constitution.
 It is by the constitutional amendment route
 that Mrs. Gandhi seeks new legal embellish-
 'ment of her bosshood as prime minister. Powers
 of the judiciary to review legislation and en-
 force civil liberties would be curtailed. Parlia-
 ment would be permitted to ban "anti-national
 activities and associations." And the prime
 minister, acting through the figurehead presi-
 dent, could simply order further changes in the

 constitution without even the need for a parlia-
 mentary rubber stamp.
 Some members of the parliamentary opposi-
 tion still at large were scathing in their
 denunciations of the Gandhi regime's constitu-
 tional  proposals.  "All  the  pillars  of
 parliamentary democracy are being converted
 into pliant tools of an all-powerful executive,"
 said H.M. Patel. "The main thrust of the bill is
 to establish a totalitarian rule of one-party
 dictatorship," said a Marxist member. Mr.
 Patel and his supporters walked out in a boycott
 of the parliamentary proceeding to avoid giving
 "a semblance of constitutional legitimacy to the
 move to throttle, democracy and impose authori-
 tarian rule."
 The parliamentary give-and-take seems to
 have a democratic ring until you realize that
 only foreigners like us can read about it, and
 even our correspondents are hampered. Censor-
 ship prevents the Italian people from learning
 the substance of the criticism voiced against the
 Gandhi program. The opposition also accuses
 the government of going back on a promise to
 permit public debate of the changes.
 As for editorial critiques of the constitutional
 plan by India's once-lively press, we regret to
 report virtually nothing along that line. The
 nearest an editorialist came to questioning the
 proposals was with reference to the plan for
 executive amendment of the constitution. An
 editorial in Tile Statesman called this "ex traor?.
 dinary indeed." That may be the most pregnant
 "indeed" ever written.

 Washington Post Staff Writer
 Deep distrust of Secretary of State
 Henry A. Kissinger's African shuttle
 diplomacy was expressed yesterday by
 black representatives of the Rhode.
 sian and Namibian (Southwest Africa)
 liberation movements.
 A conference of African specialists,
 held in the Senate Caucus Room,, re-
 verberated with suspicion that the ul-
 terior motive of Kissinger and the
 Ford administration is to protect
 white interests and American invest-
 nientsin southern Africa.
 Kissinger's attempt to launch new
 negotiations for peaceful settlement
 of the guerrilla warfare in Rhodesia
 and Namibia was assailed as out-of-
 date, ill-advised, a serious subversion
 of African aspirations and even a
 strategy of racism.
 Warfare alone, even if protracted
 warfare, is the only solution now for
 Rhodesia, liberation spokesmen said.
 The criticisms graphically illustrate
 the obstacles confronting Kissinger's
 new  round  of  African  diplomacy,
 which the State Department is ex-
 pected to confirm officially today.
 Kissinger is planning a press con-
 ference Saturday to explain his new
 venture, scheduled to be launched
 Monday and starting in black Africa.
 Sen. Dick Clark (D-Iowa), a co-spon-
 sor with Rep. Charles C. Diggs Jr. (D-
 Mich.) of the African panel discussion
 yesterday, told the group at a luncheon
 in the Senate Office Building that "I
 think the chances are one in 25, or
 one in 30," that Kissinger's diplomatic
 mission will succeed.
 "But I think it is worth making the
 effort," Clark said.
 However, while concentrating  on
 the racial struggle in Rhodesia and
 Namibia, Clark said, "I hope we never
 forget that the most repressive regime
 in southern Africa is the regime in
 South Africa."
 The Senate Foreign Relations Sub-
 committee on Africa,  which Clark
 heads, is conducting intensive hear-
 ings on South Africa. In South Africa,
 Clark said, "total U.S. investment is
 estimated at greater than $1.7 billion,"
 representing "40 per cent of the total
 U.S. investment in Africa."
 Several  hundred  spectators  at-
 tended the Caucus Room discussion,
 which was sponsored by the Fund for
 New Priorities in America :rd  the
 Women's Division of the United Meth-
 octist Church.
 To the disappointinent: of some of
 the white specialists on Africa, the lib-
 eration Spokesrnen for Rhodesia re-
 fused to consider any alternative to
 expanding guerrilla war.
 Callistus Ndlovu, representing the
 relatively more moderate wing of the
 Zimbabwe (Rhodesian) African  Na-
 tional Council, led by Joshua Nkomo,
 who tried to negotiate with Rhodesian
 Prime Minister Ian D. Smith, said:
 "We do not see how the talks can be
 resumed ... We therefore believe that
 any attempt to resume these talks is
 bound to fail."
 Eddison Zvobgo, a representative of
 the more militant wing of the Rhode-
 sian  liberation  movement,  led  by
 Bishop Abel Muzorewa, said , that
 "every time the U.S. raises the ques-
 tion of negotiations" it is because a
 liberation struggle is "about to tri-
 umph" somewhere in the world.
 "The conference  stage  is  over,"
 Zvobgo said. "Negotiations are being
 carried out where they belong-on the
 battlefield. We should resist any Kis-
 singer seduction."
 .One white panelist, Alex Boraine,
 from Harvard University's Center for
 International Affairs, a former mem-
 ber of the South African Parliament
 for the Progressive Reform Party,
 asked the  liberation spokesmen  if
 they saw no course "complementary
 to the armed struggle." He asked if
 there is no way to reduce "the length
 of the struggle" in Rhodesia, and the
 casualties.
 Only "by politicizing our people,"
 and "by rallying as many interna-
 tional forces as possible," replied El-
 ton Razemba, another member of the
 Bishop Muzorewa faction of the Afri-
 can National Council.  "Destruction
 will be there," be said. "What is war
 about? Zimbabwe will be a better soci-
 ety" in the end.
 Zvobgo, his colleague, interjected:
 "The only way of shortening the
 [Rhodesian] war or limiting the num-
 ber of people killed or injured is to
 get the war over as quickly as possi-
 ble. It is a kind of 'quick kill' theory,
 to put it bluntly."
 The Rhodesian liberation spokes-
 men insisted that what is going on in
 Rhodesia  in  the  conflict  between
 about 270,000 whites and about 6 mil-
 lion blacks is not a racial. war. "We
 are not' just fighting to replace a
 white government with black faces,"
 Ndlovu said. "1Ve are fighting to bring
 about fundamental change."
 American-Eritish plans to organize
 an international guarantee fund of up.
 to $1.5 hill ion to $2 billion to compen-
 sate Rhodesia's  white  settlers  for
 their property and other assets, said
 Ndlovu,  represents  "guarantees of
 4D
 privilege" which the blacks will nee
 tolerate.
 This idea "is predicated on the no-
 tion that it is impossible for blacks
 and whites to live together peace-
 fully," he said, and Zvobgo charged,
 "This really is racism."
 However, Nigeria's. ambassador to
 the United Nations, Leslie O. Harri-
 man, while criticizing much of Kis-
 singer's strategy, said, "I believe that
 the option of buying off the whites is
 realistic."
 Harriman said afterward, "We have
 done it in our own country [Nigeria]
 for independence." But he also said
 that, basically, "the military struggle
 is the only option left" for Rhodesian
 independence.
 Kissinger's diplomacy for Namibia
 equally "is bound to fail," said O.T.
 Emvula, deputy chief of the South
 West  Africa  People's  Organization
 (SWAPO) mission to the United Na-
 tions.
 He labeled Kissinger's approach to
 Namibia "a serious subversion"    of
 commitments made by the United Na-
 tions for the independence of that ter-
 ritory.
 Kissinger, Emvula said, "i'deliberate-
 ly complicates" matters by meeting
 with Prime Minister. John Vorster of
 South Africa, which rules Namibia
 under a mandate that the United Na-
 tions has ruled is illegal.
 If there "will he a negotiation," said
 Emvula, expressing a more moderate
 position  than  his  Rhodesian  col-
 leagues,                                                                                                         "only South   Africa  and
 SWAPO shall he the parties."
 However, SWAPO, he said, will not
 enter any talks with South Africa un-
 til South Africa withdraws its military
 forces from Namibia and releases all
 political prisoners.
 Panelist Boraine said, "I think Vor-
 ster will do a great deal to get Nami-
 bia ... off his back."
