 To the Militants of Africa!
 Revolution in Africa believes that the revolutionary people of the continent need
 to master all forms of struggle, including armed struggle, and that the militants of
 Africa must have active support in their just wars of national liberation.
 Revolution in Africa is your source book and guide.  Your own leaders are
 members of its editorial board and in their own words will sound the call for
 socialist revolutions.
 Revolution in Africa will be a handbook for the tacticians of revolt.  Its articles
 will be uncompromising and brutally frank.  They will reveal the hypocrisy and in-
 competence of the 'present so-called leaders of Africa and lift the paper curtain of
 words and more words which is used to hide their true nature and deceive their
 peoples.   Our articles will give praise where praise is due-to the numerous, growing
 Marxist parties, to guerrilla fighters throughout the continent and to all those in
 Africa whose devotion to Marxism-Leninism is reflected in deeds.
 Revolution in Africa comes into being to rescue the militants of Africa after a
 vile betrayal.  In May and June of 1963 a certain Verges published African Revolution
 at Algiers, but because of lack of cooperation from Ben Bella moved to Paris where
 the magazine was continued under the name of Revolution: Africa, Latin America,
 Asia.  Then one issue was seized by the reactionary French authorities because it
 contained an article on the Last Overseas Territories of France.  The cringing Verges
 went to the authorities and assured them that he would refrain from printing any
 material on French imperialism and would even destroy an article already prepared
 on French Somalia.
 This betrayal by Verges of the revolutionary struggle and his desertion of the
 cause of Marxism-Leninism to become the servant of the colonialists and neocolonialists
 aroused a storm of indignation, especially within the ranks of the militants of Africa.
 To me has fallen the honour of leading the development and growth of Revolution
 in Africa that. will resolutely oppose provincial nationalism and sterile revisionism,
 and will support all wars of socialist liberation and all efforts to build a united
 socialist Africa.

 Note from the Editor: Under the above heading Revolution in Africa
 will provide its readers with information about the founding, activity and
 progress of the militant Marxist parties in Africa.  Forthcoming articles
 will cover Sawaba (Niger), Parti Democratique de Guinee and the Parti
 African de l'Independence  (Senegal).  Certain  so-called  Communist
 parties which for the time being remain under the control of the revision-
 ists, such as those of Nigeria, and South Africa, will not be included.
 As is quite well known, in 1946
 the CPF (France) established the
 Rassemblement Democratique Af-
 ricain, first on the Ivory Coast and
 then in other areas of French colo-
 nial West Africa. Through its will-
 ingness to yield to opportunism
 and its failure to train leaders and
 cadres, the CPF lost control of this
 promising movement. However, an
 atmosphere favorable to political
 activity even under repressive co-
 lonial conditions was established
 and resulted in such positive off-
 shoots of the movement as the Parti
 Democratique de Guinee, Sawaba,
 and the Union Soudanaise.  After
 the People's Republic of China be-
 gan to support liberation move-
 ments in Africa, certain other par-
 ties were able to benefit from such
 interest and guidance. Further, the
 establishment of diplomatic rela-
 tions between China and France-
 on the initiative of France-made
 it more difficult than before for the
 regime of General de Gaulle to
 object to close Chinese-African col-
 laboration in the former French
 colonies.  The party described in
 the following pages emerged under
 the situation noted above and today
 it enjoys friendly, fraternal Chi-
 nese support.
 Union des Populations
 du Cameroun (UPC)
 The UPC first began activity in
 April 1948 as the Cameroun section
 of the RDA and from its founding
 it has been relentlessly militant in
 opposition to the colonialists and
 their successors the neocolonialists.

 Ernest Ouandie - leader of the
 guerrilla fighters in Cameroun
 and our esteemed collaborator.
 In this opposition and in support of
 the socialist cause it has contrib-
 uted numerous martyrs, including
 those innocent souls shot down in
 the demonstrations at Douala in
 1955.
 In August 1955 the colonial re-
 gime in Cameroun declared that
 the party was illegal and was dis-
 solved.  This order also was ap-
 plied against the Union Demo-
 cratique des Femmes Camerounai-
 ses and the Jeunesse Democratique
 du Cameroun. The party responded
 by appealing directly to the peasant
 masses and began an armed peas-
 ant struggle in certain parts of the
 Cameroun. Today  this  struggle
 continues in full force in the re-
 gions of Bamileke and Saraja. With
 sorrow it must be recorded that in

 1958 Rufus Um Nyobe, Secretary
 General of the UPC, gave his life
 while leading an armed band whose
 plans had been betrayed to the
 reactionary police.
 In 1959 the president of the
 party, Dr. Felix Moumie, visited
 Peking where he was warmly re-
 ceived and given assurances that
 selected party members would be
 given training in guerrilla warfare
 in China.  Not only was the prom-
 ise kept, but today graduates of
 these courses are leading their
 comrades on Cameroun soil.  In
 1960, when Dr. Moumie was visit-
 ing Geneva, poison was introduced
 into his food, and he too died as a
 martyr to socialism.  Despite pro-
 tests from many parts of the world,
 the Swiss government failed in its
 duty of tracking down the instiga-
 tors of this foul crime.
 Following the death of Dr. Mou-
 mie, the remaining members of the
 Executive Board of the UPC as-
 sembled.                                                                        It was decided that Abel
 Kingue, the Vice-President, should
 direct party activity, leaving the
 post of president vacant in honor
 of the memory of Dr. Moumie.
 Ernest Oudanie, a member re-
 spected by all his comrades, was
 assigned the vital task of penetrat-
 ing into Cameroun to assume lead-
 ership of the armed bands. Osende
 Afana was sent to Cairo as perma-
 nent representative of the UPC to
 the Permanent Secretariat of the.
 Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity Or-
 ganization. Reports indicate that he

 has been most successful in arous-
 ing  general indignation  against
 the tyrant Ahidjo among the mem-
 bers of the secretariat.
 Abel Kingue went to Accra after
 receiving personal assurances from
 Nkrumah  that  he  would enjoy
 complete freedom of action and
 have Ghanaian support in the revo-
 lutionary struggle.  In his enthusi-
 asm Kingue may have been guilty
 of some lapses of judgment and
 discipline.  He established an Ad-
 ministrative Secretariat at Accra
 and included as members several
 younger Camerounis who had been
 members of the CPF during their
 student days in France. These new
 members sought out a revisionist
 embassy in Accra and were in-
 structed in how to prepare a plot
 that would discredit the party mili-
 tants.  On  September 6,  1963  a
 bomb was throws into a meeting
 of the militant group and the vic-
 tims themselves were arrested by
 the Ghanaian police because they
 were carrying arms.  While the
 militants were held in prison, the
 revisionists formed a so-called Rev-
 olutionary Committee which sent
 delegates allegedly representing the
 UPC to the Afro-Asian Peoples'
 Conference at Moshi and to a later
 meeting at Nicosia.  This splitting
 effort was praised from abroad in
 an article published in a modern
 revisionist periodical: the article
 CIA-RDP78-02646R000500180002-2
 was signed by a certain Njiawue
 Nicanor, who also uses the name
 of Aboulaye Kone, writing on be-
 half of the so-called Revolutionary
 Committee.
 After the damage to the party
 had been done the militants were
 released from prison.  It cannot be
 denied that the Ghanaians acted in
 an arbitrary manner, and that the
 attachment of Nkrumah to the
 cause of Marxist-Leninism in Cam-
 eroun was brought into question.
 Discussions between Kingue. and
 Nkrumah continue with the UPC
 demanding certain, definite prom-
 ises before it will agree to keep its
 base  of  external  operations  in
 Accra.  The militants of Africa
 eagerly await the outcome of these
 discussions, hoping that Nkrumah
 will not choose to turn his back on
 the great cause of militant social-
 ism.
 Meanwhile Revolution in Africa
 has received word from our col-
 laborator Ernest Oudanie that the
 armed struggle within Cameroun
 will not cease.  While additional
 arms from Ghana will be most
 welcome, the aroused peasants are
 perfecting their guerrilla tactics
 and are capable of maintaining
 their present hold over large areas,
 as well as preparing to broaden
 the base of the war against the
 tyrannical regime.
 Long live the militants of, the
 UPC!

 FRICAN SOCIALISM:
 A Bourgeois illusion
 Certain servants of neocoloni-
 alism who deny the reality of the
 class struggle in Africa and who
 secretly serve the foreign capital-
 ists in their relentless exploitation
 of the continent, attempt to dupe
 the masses by advocating some-
 thing called African socialism.
 Such individuals include Julius
 Nyerere, Leopold Senghor, Ken-
 neth Kaunda, Mamadou Dia, Habib
 Bourguiba,  Jacques Rabemanan-
 jara, Maurice Adoum, David Dacko,
 Chabi Mama, and Jean-Marie Sa-
 waddogo.  Thus, the supporters of
 a bourgeois illusion have succeeded,
 for the time being, in mudding the
 atmosphere in Tanzania, Tunisia,
 Senegal, Zambia, Malagasy, Chad,
 Central African Republic, Dahomey
 and Upper Volta, and, unfortu-
 nately, this list does not include
 all the countries where this folk-
 myth is being propagated.
 Clearly the time has arrived to
 condemn so-called African social-
 ism and to expose its false dogma.
 All African political activists should
 be aware of the statements made
 by the true Marxists of Africa.
 Modibo Keita, admired winner of
 the Lenin Peace Prize, has given
 his view that there are two kinds
 of socialism, scientific socialism and
 democratic socialism and that the
 latter is to be equated with African
 socialism.  He states that the ad-
 vocates of African socialism include
 certain leaders who are unable to
 meet the wishes of the people and
 adds, "the people's passivity is not
 permanent.  That is why I think
 the African revolution will have to
 be violent to permit the creation
 of democratic states without an ex-
 ploited class."                                                                         In a similar vein
 Kwame Nkrumah emphasizes that
 Ghana has taken the road of sci-
 entific socialism, while his position
 is developed by the Ghana weekly
 The Spark which writes of "the
 false theory of an `African' or
 `Pan-African'  socialism,"  adding
 that, "the ideas of scientific social-
 ism will win the hearts and minds
 of millions of Africans," and con-
 cluding that there is need for un-
 relenting war against the view (of
 the advocates of African socialism)
 that there are no classes in Africa.
 It is very heartening to learn
 that the militant political parties of
 Africa are in the vanguard of the
 struggle against the bourgeois Af-
 rican socialism illusion.  Thus, the
 Parti Africain de 1'Independence
 (PAI) has stated: ". . . The pro-
 tagonists of African socialism think
 they can use their theory to in-
 toxicate the African working class
 and the working masses, to retard
 their realization of class-conscious-
 ness and thus slow down the de-
 velopment of the only authentic

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000500180002-2
 socialism, Marxist-Leninist social-
 ism." Very similar Marxist views
 are also expressed by the Union des
 Populations du Cameroun (UPC),
 the Ivory Coast Liberation Com-
 mittee, the Malagasy Popular
 Front, the Sawaba Party in Niger,
 and a number of other groups.
 However, it is now time to ex-
 amine the false dogma attached to
 this African so-called socialism.
 First, as noted above, this dogma
 denies the. existence of the class
 struggle in Africa by the naive ex-
 pedient of denying that classes
 exist. 'Thus, Senghor has stated,
 "There are no classes in our so-
 ciety,"  while  Houphouet-Boigny
 wrote, "The, class struggle, which
 lies at the base of Communism, has
 no meaning in a classless society."
 Even Sekou Toure, who usually
 follows a correct Marxist-Leninist
 line, parrots a similar line when he
 writes about the so-called "com-
 munaucratique" society of Guinea.
 As would be expected, Nyerere
 spouts similar nonsense, clothing
 his words with mythical references
 to "Ujamaa," or "familyhood," al-
 legedly the closely knit association
 of the families of like clans and
 tribes.  Nyerere, Toure and others
 shy away from the word "Commu-
 nism" and seek vainly to try to find
 something indigenous to the primi-
 tive societies of Africa which is
 better than Communism. They have
 even discovered something called
 "negritude" which is alleged to be
 the cementing force of the classless
 society but which is nothing more
 than a clumsy attempt to ration-
 alize the primitive mumbo-jumbo
 of a backward Africa that still
 dances to the colonialist tune.
 No one but a fool-and there are
 too many fools in posts of leader-
 ship in Africa-would deny that
 such features of class society as
 self-centered family structures,
 serfs, castes, chiefs and princes
 abound throughout the continent.
 Thus, it is pure illusion and decep-
 tion to state that primitive collec-
 tive traditions and groupings can
 form the base for the development
 of a modern socialist structure.
 Until the organisms of family, clan
 and tribe are ruthlessly broken up,
 efforts to develop socialism will be
 useless and ridiculous to a pathetic
 degree.  This effort must be ac-
 companied by a wiping out of the
 Special Notice.
 As this issue went to press word reached the editor that Algeria and the
 U.A.R. have decided to use the modern revisionists as their intermediary in
 sending arms and equipment to the freedom fighters of the Congo.  We
 deplore this decision which, in effect, pits self-seeking intruders against the
 real Africans, the original inhabitants of the continent, and their real friends
 of the new China.

 parasitical bureaucracy.  Nor can
 any faith be placed in the opportun-
 ist industrial proletariat. The class
 struggle must find its focal point in
 the militant, revolutionary devel-
 opment of the countless people of
 the countryside.  Fortunately, it is
 the Marxist parties, including those
 named earlier, who operate within
 the peasant milieu to arouse a class
 consciousness.
 The second feature of this false
 dogma is the pretense that African
 socialism is the equal of scientific
 socialism.  It should be known to
 anyone who even speaks the word
 socialism that the only peoples to
 achieve socialism are those who
 went about it in a scientific manner
 on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.
 Suggestions that the peoples of Af-
 rica can achieve socialism by means
 other than Marxism-Leninism or
 that the content of what they
 achieve will be a different so-
 cialism from Marxism-Leninism is
 nonsense.  In the final analysis
 Marxism-Leninism consists in the
 means of production being the com-
 mon property of all without refer-
 ence to the primitive tribe or to an
 outdated family, system.  This is a
 fact and a truth which no single
 African leader has been willing-to
 admit, and it is this denial which
 will bring on their downfall.  As
 a very specific example, African
 leaders should take a firm stand
 against capitalistic monopolism by
 barring foreign entrepreneurs from
 their countries, but none of them-
 even such men as Nkrumah, Keita,
 and Toure-has done so.
 It is axiomatic that the masses of
 Africa must carry on an intensive
 ideological struggle to open the way
 of their emancipation.  This strug-
 gle surely deserves the support of
 all Marxists and it is most startling
 to find that the modern revisionists
 are actually hampering a correct
 ideological development. A certain
 Professor I. Potekhin, who is iden-
 tified as the Director of the African
 Institute of the Academy of Sci-
 ences of the U.S.S.R. published an
 article called "African Socialism"
 in the first issue of 1963 of Inter-
 national Affairs.  This article is
 very difficult to understand for the
 poor professor was trying to carry
 water on both shoulders, trying to
 explain the truth and deny it at
 the same time, writing for Marxists
 in one paragraph and in the next
 paragraph attemping to deceive the
 Africans. He finally concluded with
 the statement that with regard to
 the need to abolish the exploitation
 of man there may be no open con-
 flicts between the advocates of sci-
 entific and "African'( socialism.
 Let us be frank and forthright,
 once and for all time, to refute the
 ridiculous efforts of both the mod-
 ern  revisionists  and  the  tribal
 minded "thinkers" in Africa: the
 path to socialism in Africa can be
 achieved only by the elimination
 of the bourgeois puppets who now
 masquerade as nationalist leaders.
 The African proletariat can and in-
 evitably will seek out and destroy
 all those false leaders in a great
 revolutionary uprising.  This will
 take time, but time is on the side
 of the Marxists-Leninists of the
 world who will assist and guide the
 African revolution.

 A Tribute to Pierre Mulele
 No moment in the long history of Africa and its modern awakening could be
 more suitable than the present to pay tribute to Pierre Mulele, martyred leader of
 the struggle for the freedom of the Congo, by bringing our readers the first authentic
 account of his years of sacrifice and service.
 I was privileged to meet Pierre Mulele in 1963 soon after his return to Europe
 from Peking.  Not long before he had completed a two months training course
 at the Academie Militaire on the outskirts of the city of Peking and he was bub-
 bling over with enthusiasm about his experiences.  He pointed out that Mao's study
 of the military art formed the solid base for the training which he and other Africans
 had received in the strategy and tactics of guerrilla warfare, as well as for the
 ideological aspects of such warfare.  He said: "Every morning I was awakened before
 dawn and driven to the Academie where the group of which I was a member worked
 until well into the evening.  The first month of training was devoted to the nature
 of various kinds of explosives and the use of bombs and grenades in sabotage opera-
 tions.  The second month included training. in the use of arms in guerrilla warfare,
 including those of Chinese and Russian makes, and to the conduct of this warfare."
 Mulele was especially eager to tell me how eminently suitable the Chinese
 method of guerrilla warfare, as developed by Moo, was to the situation in the Congo.
 He pointed out that it was based on the encirclement of the towns by the country-
 side, since it is in the towns that the reactionary elements maintain their garrisons.
 In this warfare the principle of the annihilation of the enemy must be carried out
 even in the smallest fight.  The enemy must be lured into the countryside where he
 is vulnerable: many means are available for this purpose, such as violating his
 women on the outskirts of the towns and blocking roads and trails.  Through these
 methods the enemy loses all sense of discipline and caution and the morale of the
 soldiers is greatly impaired.
 Mulele quoted for me the Chinese proverb, "Obstacles are the mother of success,"
 and pointed out that the development of a revolutionary movement depends on fight,
 defeat, fight, defeat, and fight until the. final victory is won.  As he applied this
 theory to the situation then prevailing in the Congo, he said that once operations
 began they would require a rapid development and expansion, since local areas of
 guerrilla warfare would have to be transformed into revolutionary bases which could
 be held against hostile incursions.  We can see how prophetic these words have been.

 Finally, he said that the establishment of revolutionary bases leads to the formation
 of the People's Army, directed by the Communist Party, and capable of taking
 power through accelerating violence against the reactionary regime.
 When I asked Mulele about his background he replied that it must be approached
 after an understanding of his present position as the leader in the struggle against
 the servants of imperialism in the Congo and as the standard bearer for the cause
 of socialism.  In his awn words, "Those who know me well have always heard me
 say, that freedom is never given to a person or to a country, but must be fought for
 and won."  Mulele went on to remark that he had fitted himself to be the rightful
 and sole successor of the martyred Lumumba, pointing out that all others, such as
 Gizenga, Diaka and many more, who claimed to be faithful to the ideals and aims
 of Lumumba had desecrated his memory, some through sheer inability and others
 through their willingness to please the usurpers of authority.  "These some traitors are
 now spreading slanders against me in order to try to cast doubt on my right to
 .leadership in the struggle for freedom, and it is for this reason that I welcome an
 opportunity to tell my story."
 Pierre Mulele was born in Orientale Province in 1929 and had his earliest school-
 ing at Kikwit and Totsi.  Then he went to the Little Seminary of Gizanbi and to the
 Intermediate School at Leverville before going on to higher studies at the Advanced
 Agricultural School at Yiseka in Equateur.  After two years of military service, in
 1952 he entered the colonial service and rose to be Commis adjoint principal aux
 Batements Civils at Leopoldville.  In these years he suffered many humiliations at
 the hands of the "white masters," but did not bear them with resignation.  As he
 remarked, "I looked about me for supporters of the blacks and found my first friend
 in the person of the consul of Czechoslovakia at Leopoldville.  He told me how
 members of the socialist camp had fought for freedom and gave me books on revolu-
 tionary methods."
 Mulele's activity and strong personality had attracted a wide following and in
 August 1959 he was chosen as Secretary General of the Bureau of the Parti de la
 Solidaire Africain.  Before the end of the year he left Leopoldville with funds pro-
 vided by the Czech consul to visit Cameroun, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali, and
 Guinea.  This first trip out of the Congo lasted for four months.  The greater part
 of this time was spent in Guinea following a special course for Africans in Marxism-
 Leninism, and as a reward for his outstanding study he was awarded a quick trip
 to Moscow in company with Gizenga.  Of this trip he said only, "We were both
 quite naive at that time and made a silly show of wearing Russian fur hats,
 acquired for the Moscow winter, in the heat of the Congo."

 A few months after Mulele's return to Leopoldville he went to Bruxelles as a
 representative of the PSA to the Conference Belgo-Congolaise sur les problemes
 economiques, financiers et sociaux, but left in May before the conference ended to
 engage in the electoral campaign and was chosen as a national deputy from Kwilu.
 In June 1960 he was named Minister of Education and Arts in the cabinet of Lumumba,
 The value of his services in that post are well-known.
 Mulele emphasized the point that he was the sole person to assume leadership
 in trying to halt the tragic course of events which followed the illegal dismissal of
 Lumumba as head of government.  In his words, "My urgent appeal for support
 against the imperialists brought me funds from Dr. Ghaleb Muhammad Morab,
 ambassador of the U.A.R. at Leopoldville which I turned over to Maurice Mpolo to
 use in supplying his armed bands and by way of equipment I obtained a large
 quantity of arms from the Czech representative in Leopoldville.  Unfortunately these
 efforts went for nothing as that fool Mpolo spent the few critical days in strolling
 about in a general's uniform instead of in fighting."
 Mulele went on to say that one event of these sad weeks caused a radical shift
 in his thinking.  This was the result of a letter Gizenga had written to the People's
 Republic of China demanding personnel, arms, funds, and food.  In reply Chan
 Hian-Kong, the Chinese ambassador at Cairo, sent a long letter full of feelings of
 friendship and brotherhood.  Sortly after this letter came Mulele went to Stanleyville
 with Gizenga to set up the Free Republic of the Congo, and held the post of Minister
 of Education in this government.  However, Pierre Mulele soon came to realize that
 Gizenga was incapable of establishing a government surrounded by loyal forces
 and capable of withstanding the onslaughts of the neocolonial forces.  The time had
 come for a tactical retreat in order to establish a separate base for revolutionary
 action.  What was Mulele to do?  He told me, "I thought first of Ghana but in his
 correspondence with Lumumba Nkrumah had proved to be all talk and no deeds.

 I thought of the Soviets but our experience had demonstrated that they were not
 solidly grounded in the realities of the Congo.  Indeed, it was after N. S. Khrushchev
 had said, 'Bas les mains devant le Congo' that I realized that the Soviet Union would
 do nothing to promote our war of liberation.     Thus, it seemed clear that it was the
 Chinese, free from any traces of white racism, who offered the best hope."
 So it was that on December 16, 1960 Mulele left Stanleyville and traveled to
 Cairo by way of Khartoum, arriving in Egypt before the end of the year.  He was
 given a warm welcome by Chan Hian-Kang who assured him that the People's Republic
 of China would recognize him as the diplomatic representative to the U.A.R. of the
 Free Republic of the Congo, once he had persuaded key figures in the U.A.R. to
 extend such recognition.  For some months Mulele lived with his family in a very
 small apartment until, at the insistence of the Chinese ambassador, a larger and
 more convenient one was assigned to him.  At this point in his story Pierre Mulele
 said that he was obliged to refute accounts that had circulated about his extravagant
 living in Egypt and that he spent freely from seven and a half tons of gold that he
 had taken from Stanleyville to Cairo.  "How could any sensible man dream," he
 said, "that such a weight could be transported through the Sudan.  Indeed, had
 any such sum been in my possession guerrilla warfare would have been initiated in
 the Congo long before it was."
 At Cairo Mulele established good relations with members of the socialist camp
 of peace-loving nations, especially with Richard Gyptner of the East German People's
 Republic.  However, the attitude of the authorities of the U.A.R. was discouraging
 as they declined to supply adequate funds for a cause which they so warmly
 praised.  Finally, he asked Chan Hian-Kang for his advice and was told that the
 so-called friends of the Congo would help him only if they saw some advantages
 for themselves and that Mulele must realize once and for all that it was only the
 People's Republic of China that actively supported wars of national liberation.  The
 ambassador added that Mulele should accept some of the invitations extended to
 him by the Communist parties and make his own judgment.
 So it was that Mulele went to Moscow again in March 1961, and again was well
 received but met only with excuses when he asked for aid for the Stanleyville govern-
 ment.
 By the end of 1961 it appeared certain that Mulele could do nothing for the
 cause of the freedom of the Congo in Cairo so he stored his files at the Chinese
 Embassy and left the country in January 1962.  His first stop was in Paris where he
 talked with leaders of the French Communist Party about aid in the preparation of
 pamphlets and in preparing for an uprising.  Returning briefly to Cairo to replenish his
 funds, in March he set off for Prague where he asked for aid in organizing sabotage,
 assassinations and terrorism in the Congo.  To convince the Czechs of the seriousness

 of his purpose he asked for training in the use of explosives.  He then went on to
 Moscow and found the Russians as gracious as ever.  As he said, "They even put
 me on a plane to Baghdad so that the Arabs of Iraq could have a first-hand look
 at an African socialist.  Unfortunately since that time the Iraqi Arabs, just as volatile,
 emotional and unreliable as their brothers in Egypt, have turned against socialism."
 At Moscow the Chinese representatives asked if he had reached a decision and
 he replied that he was, ready to go to Peking and to. take every advantage of this
 ,opportunity.
 Returning to the lessons of his stay in China, Mulele went on td say, "Perhaps
 it is only the Chinese who know the secret of hard work and it is one which every
 leader of a national movement of liberation must learn.  Our Congo, quite in con-
 trast to much of China, has abundant natural resources, but the greatest enemy of
 material progress is the lethargy of its people which stems from the ancient tribal
 society.  In many ways this society is more evil than colonialism itself.  China shows
 ithe world how a socialist country must be founded on a new order of society,. a
 society in which` family and tribal ties have no place.  Communal living and com-
 munal work must take priority over selfish personal ambitions.  It follows from this
 that the Congo can never be truly free as long as it is split into provinces whose only
 reason for existence is the presence of certain tribes.  It is well-known that all are
 brothers under socialism, but brothers in work and achievement and not because of
 ties of family and tribe.  I am fully committed to creating disorder in 'the Congo,
 because it is only by means of destroying the authority of the so-called provinces
 and the power of the tribal leaders that the ground can be swept clean for build-
 ing national unity.  To those who might question the possibility of achieving this
 goal, let me point to the People's Republic of China where ethnic rivalries no longer
 .exist and where ancestor worship has been wiped out.  I would not deny that this
 goal has been won' at a considerable cost of human lives-and that this process will
 be repeated in the Congo-but after all human life is almost too abundant,and what
 may be the loss of one generation will be the gain of the next."
 Mulele's eyes shone as he emphasized that his great mission as the successor of
 Lumumba was to build socialism in the Congo.  He added that his mission was to
 inform the people of the Congo of the main themes of scientific socialism: popular
 leadership exerted through the communist party, equal rewards for equal work, state
 ownership of the means of production and distribution, etc.  In addition, scientific
 socialism demands the destruction of the outmoded social order of the Congo and the
 .neutralization of chiefs, politicians, entrepreneurs, members of the so-called traditional
 elites and all others whose attachment to the reactionary ways of life and thought
 brand them as enemies of the new order.  "Once more I say that this is the reason
 for the fighting which now rages and which will continue, spreading through the

 bush like an inextinguishable flame, until the present social order and its lackeys have
 been wiped out."
 Sending his greetings to those now active in the struggle Mulele pointed out
 that this period will be a time of testing for many of them.  "The bravest warriors
 in this battle will receive the greatest rewards: they will be among the founding
 members of the Communist Party of the Congo and will receive high positions in the
 People's Army and in the administration of the socialist government."
 Somewhat inspired by Mulele's own optimism and enthusiasm, I asked what vision
 he had of a larger role of the future Congo in the African scene and his reply was
 most revealing.  "Just as socialism has nothing to do with tribal boundaries, so it
 condemns the boundaries of states that were drawn in an arbitrary fashion by the
 colonial powers and shamefully accepted by corrupt politicians.  It is clearly apparent
 that the People's Republic of the Congo will ignore such boundaries and liberate the
 Bantus and others wherever they may be found.  The Congolese socialists will take
 over the task of liberating the Angola and attaching it to our republic along with
 Brazzaville and certain parts of the Sudan and of Rhodesia.  Looking, toward an even
 larger scene, we have heard much of Pan-Africanism, but can have little faith in such
 a vision if it continues to be directed by a so-called emperor.  If Pan-Africanism is
 to have any reality it must be in terms of close collaboration among the Communist
 parties of Africa which will more and more draw their inspiration and guidance and
 material support from the great People's Republic of China."
 As I thanked Pierre Mulele for his clear and convincing outline of the future of the
 Congo, he, as a true socialist, thanked me.  As we parted he said, "Who can say
 when we shall meet again?  As a leader I should not risk a life which is of such
 value to my people, but when I hear of their noble deeds I am determined to share
 in their sacrifices and their victories."
 As is well known, in the summer of 1963 Mulele went to Congo (B) to provide
 inspiration and give instruction to elements of the National Liberation Army then in
 training to the north of Brazzaville.  He then boldly made his way into Leopoldville
 itself and then on to Kwilu province where scores of militants flocked to join him.
 Villages and even towns fell before their advance and Leopoldville itself was
 threatened.  Then tragedy struck, swift and relentless.  While intervening in a petty
 dispute of the division of spoils, Pierre Mulele was accidentally killed by his own
 followers.
 The loss of Lumumba seemed irreparable, the loss of Mulele seems irreparable,
 and yet their places must be taken by men who will never weaken in the face of
 danger and never flee from any enemy.
 Long live the memory of Pierre Mulele!

 .L Malawi
 Malawi, known as Nyasaland be-
 fore gaining independence on July
 6, 1964, is some 520 miles "in length
 and varies in width from 50 to 100
 miles.  The land area is approxi-
 mately 37,000 square miles. Malawi
 is landlocked, the southern tip of
 the country being 130 miles from
 the sea. It is bordered by Mozam-
 bique on the south, Tanzania on
 the northeast, and by Zambia on
 the northwest.  Malawi's elevation
 varies between 2,500 and 7,000 feet
 above sea level.  Because of this,
 and in spite of the fact that the
 country lies within the tropics,
 Malawi has an equable climate dur-
 ing most of the year.  Rainfall is
 seasonal and occurs in the summer
 months, from November to March.
 The fall varies from 120 inches in
 the mountains to 15 inches in the
 low lying areas.  The lush foliage,
 high peaks, and large lakes make
 this nation one of the most beauti-
 ful in all Africa.
 The population of Malawi is esti-
 mated at about four millions, in-
 cluding approximately 11,000
 Asians and 9,000 Europeans.  The
 inhabitants of Malawi are called
 Malawians.  The name of the na-
 tion is taken from that of the
 Malawi people, who in the 17th
 century inhabited much of the ter-
 ritory that is today Malawi.  Other
 tribes which migrated to present
 day Malawi were the Yao from the
 west and the Angoni from the
 south.
 Zomba is the capital of the coun-
 try.                                                                     It is located at the foot of
 6,842 foot high Zomba Mountain
 and covers an area of approxi-
 mately two and one half square
 miles.  It has a population of ap-
 proximately  6,500  persons.  The
 history of Malawi from the time of
 the arrival of the first European
 imperialists in the nineteenth cen-
 tury has been closely connected
 with the attempts of powerful for-
 eign individuals and companies to
 establish the form of government,
 which would give them the most
 effective control of, and greatest
 opportunity for, ruthless exploita-
 tion of both the human and natural
 resources of Nyasaland. Until 1953
 all administrative systems imposed
 on the Nyasaland peoples by the
 white minority were merely de-
 vices to protect and foster the
 growth of the foreign based, capi-

 talistic monopolies.  So it was that
 in 1953 the. imperialist exploiters
 adopted the idea of a federation of
 the territories of Southern and
 Northern Rhodesia with Nyasa-
 land as a means of entrenching im-
 perialist control by a white minor-
 ity, denying the brave Malawian
 people free access to their land,
 maintaining a vast pool of cheap,
 exploitable, enslaved African labor,
 and delaying the drive of the
 stalwart Malawian peoples for self-
 determination and independence.
 But, the revolution could not be
 stopped and the Federation col-
 lapsed in 1963, another instance of
 the decline of colonialism and im-
 perialism in post World War II Af-
 rica. The nationalistic drive which
 .ended the Federation and the bru-
 tal domination of Malawi by a
 white minority is merely another
 example of the inspiration given to
 African nationalists by the glorious
 example of the socialist countries.
 Malawi: view of the countryside from the air.
 The drive for self-determination
 and independence ended on July
 6, 1964 when the rule of the British
 imperialists ended and Dr. Hastings
 Banda became the first Prime Min-
 ister of independent Malawi.  Un-
 fortunately, the Malawian peoples
 have been betrayed by one of their
 own, for Dr. Banda has proven to
 be a stooge for the imperialists, cap-
 italists, and neocolonialists.    Even
 on the very day of the independ-
 ence celebrations, the South Afri-
 can and Portuguese imperialists
 were invited and occupied posi-
 tions of honor.  Dr. Banda has in-
 sisted on remaining on friendly
 terms with these white supremacist
 governments, even though they are
 the very enemy which true Afri-
 can nationalism has vowed to de-
 stroy utterly.  He has even spoken
 well of the brutal oppressor of the
 Southern Rhodesian nationalists,
 his personal friend, Mr. Field, and
 stated that they would undoubtedly

 do much business together.  Con-
 trary to the resolutions of the
 O.A.U., Dr. Banda has seen fit to
 appoint a Portuguese security agent

 people shows that he is merely a
 tool and puppet of the Portuguese
 imperialists and their reactionary
 Western supporters.  Dr. Banda re-
 tains his position of power only
 by terrorizing the people with his
 private gang of Western-armed
 thugs. The true friends of the peo-
 ple, former cabinet ministers of the
 government, have been forced into
 cruel exile. When these patriots
 voiced to Dr. Banda the desires
 of the Malawian people to have
 friendly relations with their social-
 ist comrades, the enemies of im-
 perialism, the People's Republic of
 China, he labeled them plotters and
 falsely accused them of accepting

 bribes from the People's Republic
 of China for opening the door for
 friendly, fraternal relations.  The
 use of bribes is a tactic of the West-
 ern imperialists, not of national,
 fraternal socialism.
 Dr. Banda has allowed the coun-
 try to remain economically de-
 pendent on foreign controlled capi-
 talist monopolies, and has even
 been seeking additional imperialist
 investment capital abroad, mainly
 in the United States, where he has
 recently spent considerable time.
 He has proposed several completely
 absurd schemes, among them the
 construction of a useless road along
 the lakes and the transfer of the
 capital to another location.  Even
 Dr. Banda's most abject Western
 apologists find it next to impossible
 to rationalize his actions unless
 rumours circulating in Malawi are
 true that the so-called "Kamuzu"
 suffers from a softening of the
 brain caused by past sexual ex-
 cesses and attendant diseases. How
 else could one explain the actions
 of this "Saviour," as he has hypo-
 critically caused himself to be
 called, in turning away the hand
 of friendship' from the socialist
 camp? How else can one justify his
 paranoid dismissal of his nation's
 most devoted servants and his si-
 multaneous lavishing of money,
 land and graft on a few sycophant
 lickspittles, including his degen-
 erate mistress?
 This cruel oppression and betrayal
 of the people cannot and will not
 last for long.  As the people threw
 off the imperialist chains with
 which  the      British  reactionaries
 bound them in slavery for one
 hundred years, so will they end the
 betrayal of their new independence
 by Dr. Banda.  The examples of
 other African nations and the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China point out
 to them the way to deal with this
 betrayal and advance to true so-
 cialism.

 of colonial boundaries.  Piously mouthing the praises of a still-born
 movement called Pan-Africanism, these politicians, kings and opportun-
 ists seek to keep their grasp on areas to which they have no just claims.
 Throughout Africa national liberation can be achieved only if population
 elements are inspired by sentiments of nationalism and it follows that each
 distinctive major ethnic group must be privileged to exert its right of
 self-determination with regard to political and administrative units.
 The many colonial boundaries which have become sources of conten-
 tion resulted from the rapacity and greed of the imperialists.  Some
 boundaries mark areas conquered and held by the force of arms, some
 are the results of temporary treaty agreements between competing foreign
 powers, while other follow minor topographical features in a most arbi-
 trary and haphazard manner.  Still striving to maintain their exploiting
 interests, these same powers strenuously oppose any local, just revision
 of these so-called boundaries. Yet, radical surgery is required if the
 future development of Africa is to follow true nationalist channels.  To
 the objection, voiced primarily by these same imperialists, that the exten-
 sive redrawing of national boundaries would result in the fragmentation
 of Africa, we assert that the goal of socialist union and unity throughout
 the continent can be attained only through the federation of popular
 units which can preserve their own dignity and identity within a larger
 framework.
 The space here placed at my disposal does not allow for an exhaustive
 discussion of the subject and I will limit myself to a few specific ex-
 amples.  These include the areas of Somalia, the Sudan and Congo (L).
 Somalia, through no fault of its own, suffers grievously from the
 hostility of all its neighbors.  The chief offender is Kenya which refuses
 to recognize the fact that the former Northern Frontier District is totally
 inhabited by Somali tribes: these 300,000 people are not Negroes and they

 are Somalis.  The hostile attitude of Jumo Kenyatta is well reflected in
 his statement: "They can pack up their camels and go back to the Somali
 Republic if they don't wish to remain within Kenya."  It should be pointed
 out that Kenyatta is stubbornly determined to repress the right of self-
 determination of not only the Somalis, but of the Masai who want to join
 Tanzania and the Teso who properly belong within Uganda.  Ethiopia
 has also refused to realign the common frontier so as to award Somali
 occupied areas to our nation.  Finally, the continued existence of so-called
 French Somalia remains a festering sore where our brothers suffer under
 colonial oppression.  Somalia and its people will not rest until all its
 territories are wrested from the usurpers.
 In the case of the Sudan, although we are Moslems ourselves we
 cannot be silent about the treatment accorded the tribes of the southern
 Sudan by the series of ruling cliques at Khartoum.  The action of the
 faceless regime in Khartoum in throwing thousands of southern Sudanese
 long resident there into concentration camps cannot be too severely con-
 demned.  However, just as serious in its implications for freedom in
 Africa has been the recent action of the Communist Party of Sudan.
 This party claimed earlier to advocate equal rights for the southern
 Sudanese as well as partition between north and south according to the
 principle of self-determination.  Now it has reversed its position fol-
 lowing instructions from the modern revisionists.  Its masters who seek
 to use the countries on the northern fringe of Africa as tools for its pene-
 tration of the sub-Saharan regions, have made the claim that dictatorial
 control over the southern Sudan by the Khartoum regime will make
 easier the shipment and delivery of arms to the Congolese and other
 freedom fighters.
 The problem of the Congo (L) is one which concerns all Africa.
 Tshombe and his masters, the white mercenaries, supplied with weapons
 of mass destruction by the colonial powers, will never succeed in crush-
 ing the desire of the Congolese for freedom.  On the other hand, it must
 be recognized that unity in the Congo (L), even under a people's govern-
 ment, is impossible because the region is presently enclosed within artificial
 boundaries which serve only to separate vast communities from their
 blood brothers in adjacent countries.  The Congo (L) must be reduced
 in size and number of components and this could be done after the areas
 involved had expressed their wishes according to the principle of self-
 determination.

 The Application to Africa of
 Mao's Precepts on Popular
 Revolution
 The People's Republic of China still
 recognizes the importance of wars of
 national liberation even though it has
 developed its own atomic bomb and
 is no longer subject to nuclear black-
 mail.                                  In its role as vanguard fighter
 in wars of national liberation, China
 acknowledges its obligation to lead the
 revolutionary movements throughout Af-
 rica against the feudal rulers and the
 neocolonialists who finance these lackeys.
 With the objective of leading the popu-
 lar revolts, China has provided training
 facilities, weapons, cadres, and guidance
 in the tactics and strategy of people's
 wars.
 New China has always supported revo-
 lution in Africa from whatever the source
 or political grouping-socialists in Al-
 geria, monarchists in Morocco, militarists
 in the U.A.R.  To wait for the gradual
 evolution of a proletariat in impover-
 ished, backward feudal states when, in
 the words of Chou En-lai, "prospects for
 revolution are excellent all over Africa,"
 is to turn one's back on the course of
 history.
 Because  the  imperialists and  their
 stooges will not voluntarily give up their
 control of a country, the only means by
 which they can be destroyed is revolution.
 Two approaches to revolution may be
 distinguished.  One  is  the  revolt  by
 workers in towns.  This approach, em-
 ployed in capitalistic countries, will not
 work in African countries, most of which
 do not have a significant working class.
 A second approach, which has been suc-
 cessfully employed by the Chinese, is
 based on the peasants.  The revolu-
 tionaries penetrate behind the enemy
 lines, win over the peasants, and encircle
 the towns.  Lines of communication are
 cut, the individual towns are isolated,
 and the enemy loses effective control of
 the nation.  This approach has been
 followed by the Chinese in their guidance
 to local African revolutionary movements.
 The first step in transforming a bour-
 geois-national uprising into a true Marx-
 ist-Leninist people's revolution lies in the
 formation of a strong Communist Party.
 Experience in China, North Korea, and
 Vietnam has revealed, in the absence of
 a proletariat, the value of the peasantry
 .as a sturdy foundation on which to build
 a party.  Because the peasants cannot
 produce the competent early leaders

 usually found among the industrial pro-
 letariat, however, these leaders must be
 sought among the intellectuals and par-
 ticularly among the students, who can
 provide the requisite zeal as well as in-
 telligence.  Many of these future party
 leaders will be found among the thou-
 sands of African students being given
 general academic and technical training
 in the.People's Republic of China.
 The Communist Party is an elite party,
 made up of individuals with revolutionary
 courage, disinterest in personal gain, no
 fear of criticism, and a willingness to
 confess to the party all their innermost
 thoughts.  Such a party, by its rigid
 standards, must be a minority party.
 Consequently, it will be necessary for the
 party to rally around its lead a united
 front of anti-imperialist allies, including
 even bourgeoisie, feudal classes, mon-
 archists, and militarists.
 During the revolutionary period the
 party's platform must contain something
 that appeals to each ally and nothing
 that may be objectionable to any of
 them.  The political objectives must ap-
 pear to coincide with the aspirations of
 the people even if they do not while
 the real intentions of the party must be
 secret from the allies.  Control over the
 allies is attained by confronting them
 with the party's superiority in organiza-
 tion, discipline, doctrine,  policy,  and
 leadership.  The party alone must lead;
 forceful leaders among the allies must
 be eliminated.  The party alone must ex-
 pand; the allied parties may be permitted
 only to stagnate.  As soon. as the allies
 are no longer needed, the party will ex-
 pose their true exploitative nature, will
 reject them one by one, and will use the
 remaining allies to help crush those al-
 ready singled out for liquidation.
 In addition to the formation of a
 united front under its direction and coon-
 trol, the party must obtain the active
 participation in the revolution of the
 population at large.  Moo colorfully de-
 scribed the relationship of the revolu-
 tionary activist under conditions of war
 to the population by linking the revolu-
 tionary to fish and b friendly population
 to the sea in which the fish makes its
 home.  The sympathy of the population
 is not enough; what is needed is the
 complicity of the people in the revolution.
 Persuasion can win over a minority of the
 population; force and selective terror will
 insure the support of the rest.  The ap-
 plication of violence serves a twofold
 purpose: first, to eliminate any elements
 of the population deemed actually or
 potentially hostile and, second, to set up
 the liquidation of these reactionaries as
 an example of what will happen to
 other deviationists.
 It may seem possible to seize power
 by means short of war.  However, such
 attainment of power is a hollow victory
 which subsequently will be diluted and
 lost through concessions and compromise.
 The true victory can only be won by force
 through armed struggle. Mao Tse-tung
 has wisely said, "Every Communist must
 grasp the truth: 'political power grows
 out of the barrel of a gun."'  When

 power is gained after an armed strug-
 gle, victory is complete, authority is ab-
 solute.  Combat has polarized the popu-
 lation, revealing friends, disclosing en-
 emies. As a result of armed struggle, the
 party has been enabled to strengthen
 its position.  A natural process of selec-
 tion has culled out the weak and purified
 the leadership.  With a firm political
 base and a reliable military establish-
 ment, the party is now ready to sustain
 the newly seized power.  Finally, be-
 cause a local war of national liberation
 is part of the continuing worldwide fight
 against imperialism and colonialism, every
 local defeat of the imperialists weakens
 their will and contributes to their ulti-
 mate over-all defeat.  Mao summed up
 the true nature of armed struggle with
 these thoughts:. . . "the main form of
 struggle is war, the main form of organi-
 zation is the army . . . without armed
 struggle there would be no place for the
 proletariat, there will be no place for the
 people, there will be no place for the
 Communist Party, and there will be no
 victory in revolution."
 In the application to Africa of the
 theoretical principles underlying wars of
 national liberation, many problems have
 arisen.  That these problems have been
 faced, overcome, and even turned to ad-
 vantage is a tribute to the correct Marx-
 ist-Leninist thinking of the representatives
 of the People's Republic of China on the
 scene in Africa and to the thorough
 training and preparation of local party
 cadres.
 In many African countries, the absence
 of an aroused proletariat, a militant
 peasantry, and a progressive student
 group has made difficult the preparation
 of a proper ideological base on which
 to construct a Communist Party.  Yet in
 Zanzibar, a small cadre of Chinese-
 trained activists led by Mohamed Babu
 was able to organize and control a pop-
 ular nationalist movement and to lead
 this united front to a glorious victory over
 the Arab forces of imperialism and reac-
 tion.  After two days of bloody violence
 from the 11th to the 12th of January
 1964, the people's revolution was suc-
 cessful and the socialist states led by the
 People's Republic of China quickly rec-
 ognized Babu's new revolutionary regime
 as the true government of Zanibar. Thus,
 a score of properly indoctrinated party
 activists, leading about 500-600 allies,
 were able to gain control of a state with
 a population of 150,000.
 Whereas in Zanibar a popular Com-
 munist-led revolt succeeded in spite of
 the absence of a true Communist Party,
 in the Congo this absence has caused
 the temporary setback of a people's re-
 volt.  Here, a small cadre of activists,
 again under the leadership of Chinese-
 trained Party members, such as Gaston
 Soumialot, were able to seize control of
 what was initially nothing more than
 a continuation of ancient native ethnic
 and tribal rivalries.  With the MNC-Lu-

 cessful in Zanzibar; prolonged and in-
 decisive in the Portuguese colonies and
 in the Congo.
 As the people's revolution comes to
 each African country in its turn, which of
 the two forms will it take?  In East Af-
 rica, if the voice of the people were
 heeded, the armed struggle could be
 quick and decisive in the Zanzibar tradi-
 tion.  But these countries are far too rich
 in resources for the imperialists to give
 them up without a bloody and protracted
 struggle.  One has but to recall the
 British intervention of January 1964 to
 realize that the  neocolonialists stand
 ready to plunge East Africa into a Congo-
 like blood bath before they will respond
 to the just demands of an oppressed
 population.  Consequently,  when  the
 popular  forces  strike  for  freedom in
 Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda,
 they can expect no mercy and will show
 no mercy.
 Party theoreticians have argued that
 the local Communist Party must achieve
 control of its country through native
 efforts.  The attainment of power by for-
 eign                                       intervention, it is further argued,
 will only result in weakening the local
 party and leaving it incapable of resolv-
 ing future threats without continuing ex-
 ternal support.
 No one can fault this argument when
 it is applied to countries with a well-
 established party.  Inasmuch as much of
 Africa does not yet have strong indige-
 nous Communist parties, it is only through
 external assistance that popular African
 revolutions can be established and sus-
 tained.  The record of the People's Re-
 public of China with regard to assistance
 to African activists glows brightly in con-
 trast to the efforts of all others.  In fact,
 China has provided help to all pro-
 gressivist parties throughout Africa.  Thus,
 recipients of comradely Chinese aid have
 been the UPC in Cameroun, the MPLA in
 Angola, the MNC-Lumumba in the Con-
 go, the UMMA in Zanzibar, and numerous
 others.  No progressive party is so small
 or mean that it cannot qualify for friendly
 support. For example, the Free Eritrean
 Movement, dedicated to the overthrow
 of the arch-reactionary, Haile Selassie,
 and to the establishment of a People's
 Republic of Eritrea, is small, with fewer
 than 10,000 members, and weak, operat-
 ing out of exile.  It is not too small or
 weak for its able leaders, Idris Muham-
 mad Adum and Woldeab Woldemariam,
 to receive Chinese training and financial
 assistance.  And  some  day this  party
 may be the spearhead of an Ethiopian
 revolution.
 Just as Communist Parties must deal
 with bourgeois nationalists and   even
 feudalists in the organization and oper-
 ation of a united front which the party
 can dominate initially and take over
 eventually, so must Communist nations
 form united fronts with nationalistic and
 even reactionary states for the ultimate
 objectives  of  the  international.  Thus,
 China has supported monarchists in Bu-
 rundi, nationalists in Eritrea, and irre-
 dentists in Somalia.  Through these coun-
 tries, China can help the downtrodden
 masses in the Ivory Coast, the Congo,

 Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Kenya.  For ex-
 ample, Chinese military assistance to the
 Greater Somalia drive first will pave the
 way for people's revolutions in Ethiopia
 and Kenya and then will permit an ad-
 vanced base for penetration of Somalia.
 Of course, there are always obstacles
 encountered in the use of nations in
 united  fronts.  Many  African  leaders
 speak loudly but do little.  Thus, Ben
 Bella of Algeria announced, "We will
 send arms and volunteers to our Congo
 brothers, as we have already done."
 In fact, although he had plenty of Chi-
 nese weapons and although the People's
 Republic of China offered to replace
 in his inventory any weapons that he
 sent to the Congo, at the time of great-
 est need he only made a single small
 shipment and even that not accompanied
 by volunteers.  Those African leaders
 who fail to support national wars of
 liberation may one day find that their
 own people will turn on them, accusing
 them as accomplices in the murder of
 their brothers.
 CHINA and AFRICA
 1. African Visitors to China
 In November of this year M. Keita received a hearty fraternal wel-
 come at Peking and elsewhere in the New China.  A member of his party,
 M. Gologo, Minister of Information and Tourism of Mali, gave an inter-
 view to the Shanghai paper Wen-hui Pao which included his praise for
 China's successful explosion of an atomic bomb. In his words: "China's
 first nuclear explosion ... is an honour for us and makes us strong."  It
 is needless to add that Gologo was speaking for all Africans who regard
 the growing might of the People's Republic of China as a mighty force for
 peace and national liberation.
 In October Theresa Kanyonga, Queen of Burundi, made her second
 visit to China and was warmly welcomed by old friends, including Hsu
 Kuang-ping, Vice-President of the National Women's Federation.  At an
 elaborate state banquet held for the Queen she spoke of the contrast
 between the austerity in her own country and the rich way of life of the
 leaders of China and kindly added: "The purpose of China's development
 of nuclear weapons is to break the nuclear monopoly."
 2. China Speaks to Africa
 In a statement released by the New China News Agency on December
 3, 1964 Liao Cheng-chih, Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000500180002-2
 and Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, con-
 demned the act of the Senegal Government in sentencing Abdoulhaye Ly
 to two years' imprisonment on the trumped up charges of inciting troops
 to disobedience, spreading false news and committing acts compromising
 public safety.  Praising Ly, Liao Cheng-chih said: "It is the right and the
 duty of militant African Marxist-Leninists to conduct violent struggles
 for national liberation and China and its people view with scorn and
 anger the reactionary regime in Senegal."
 The remark of M. Gologo quoted above provides a welcome oppor-
 tunity to clear up certain misunderstandings that have arisen relative
 to the position of China and its people prior to and after the explosion
 of its first nuclear bomb.

 4            World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.
 Editor Ahmad M. Kheir stands in the front row on the left
 and his wife is seen just above Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
 In Premier Chou En-lai's open letter of August 2, 1963 to the heads of
 all governments of the world he offered a number of constructive pro-
 posals, including one that all countries should "Cease all nuclear tests,
 including underground nuclear tests."  However, the Premier intended
 this proposal to apply only to those countries which already possessed
 nuclear weapons and not to the People's Republic of China itself.  This
 was made quite clear in a lengthy statement issued by a Chinese spokes-
 man on August 15, 1963.  The spokesman said: "The greater number of
 socialist countries possessing them (nuclear weapons) the better. . . ."
 He pointed out that China had made this realistic decision in the face of
 the threat of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, adding: "Socialist countries
 do not want nuclear weapons.  The Chinese Government and people
 have always stood in the forefront of the fight to prohibit them."
 As has now become known, as far back as June 20, 1959 the Soviet
 Government refused to honour its promise to provide China with a sample
 of an atomic bomb and technical data concerning its manufacture, giving
 as a reason the so-called fact that if China attempted to manufacture
 nuclear weapons it would result in a great strain on China's economy.
 This falsehood was exposed by a statement made on September 1, 1963
 by a Chinese spokesman, in these words.  "Is not China very poor and
 backward? Yes, it is.  The Soviet leaders say, how can the Chinese be
 qualified to manufacture nuclear weapons when they eat watery soup
 out of a common bowl and do not even have pants to wear? ... But in
 any case, even if we Chinese people are unable to produce an atom bomb
 for a hundred years, we will neither crawl nor kneel before blackmail."
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung made this position clear as early as November 18,
 1957 in his speech at the Moscow meeting of the Communist and Workers'
 Parties when he said: "If the worst came to the worst and half of man-
 kind died (in an atomic war), the other half would remain while im-
 perialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would
 become socialist; in a number of years there would be 2,700 million people
 again."  Thus, the position of the leaders and people of China has not
 changed. We recognize that the victory of socialism demands sacrifice,
 even the sacrifice of unestimated numbers of human lives.  But imperial-
 ism cannot be destroyed by any other means, as Comrade Mao Tse-tung

 world must, therefore, welcome China's ever growing nuclear strength.
 It is true that the Communique of the People's Republic of China,
 issued on October 16th immediately after the first nuclear explosion did
 contain the statement: "The atom bomb is a paper tiger." However this
 statement must be understood in its proper context, that is with reference
 to the famous statement of Comrade Mao Tse-tung that "Imperialism is
 a paper tiger."  In the hands of the imperialists whose strength declines
 with each passing day, the atom bomb is a paper tiger, but in the hands
 of the Communist Party of China the same bomb is a tiger whose fearful
 force can reach any corner of the world.
 3. Africa Speaks to China
 At a recent spontaneous demonstration held before the United States
 Embassy in Congo (B) shouts of "We hate you" and "We love China"
 were heard.  Leading this people's protest was Alphonse Moandat-Zahoud,
 member of the National Revolutionary Movement (N.R.M.), recently
 returned from Peking where he had visited on the invitation of the Chi-
 nese-African People's Friendship Association.
 On October 20th Chairman Liu Shao-chi received the following mes-
 sage from Diallo el Hadj Saifoulaye, Minister of State, Republic of Guinea.
 "We have learnt with real pride the news of the great victory of the Com-
 munist Party of China.  China's bomb is a freedom bomb."
 At Addis Ababa on October 16th Kebede Asfaw, Assistant Informa-
 tion Minister of Ethiopia, congratulated Ting Po of the Chinese Shenyang
 Acrobatic Troupe on the occasion of the explosion of the first atomic bomb.
