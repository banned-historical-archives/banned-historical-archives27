 MEMORANDUM FOR:  Deputy Director for Intelligence
 FROM:            Director of Central Intelligence
 SUBJECT:         Semantics and Structure of Disinformation
 Here is material I talked to you about this morning on our
 vulnerability to words, verbal formulations and concepts used as
 weapons against our security interests.  I am groping around for
 a way to get some concentrated brain power, high level policy
 attention and possible public attention paid to this subject --
 perhaps a small analytical group, perhaps a conference, perhaps a
 research program.

 Dear Gene,
 I had a very interesting talk with your wife at the
 PFIAB reception a week or two ago.  She put her finger on
 something which has troubled me.  Why are we so weak on
 semantics and the structure of disinformation?
 We talked about some people who had done work in
 this area.  She talked about a Glaswell in Chicago, I
 think.  I remember a fellow, a name like Lassiter, who
 was at Columbia a decade or two ago.
 I would like to get some ideas on how we could get
 a small group of' knowledgeable people interested and versed
 irn the art of science and semantics to study why we do so
 poorly and how we might do better.  I recall quite a lot
 of work done on this with respect to Hitler in the late 30s.
 Acain, there was someone whose name I can't recall who gained
 a lot of prominence in writing and speaking about the
 semantics of propaganda-  Not many of us left with memories
 that go back that far.
 If you or Mrs. Rostow have any ideas I would appreciate
 getting them.

 Can the Democracies Survive?
 Jean-Francois Revel
 doing what is needed to counter them. It awakens
 only when the danger becomes deadly, imminent,
 evident. By then, either there is too little time left
 for it to save itself, or the price of survival has be-
 come crushingly high.
 In addition to its external enemy (once Nazi,
 now Communist), whose intellectual energy and
 economic power are primarily destructive, democ-
 racy faces an internal enemy whose right to exist is
 written into the law itself.
 Totalitarianism liquidates its internal enemies
 or smashes opposition as soon as it arises; it uses
 methods that are simple and infallible because
 they are undemocratic. But democracy can defend
 itself from within only very feebly; its internal
 enemy has an easy time of it because he exploits
 the right to disagree that is inherent in democracy.
 His aim of destroying democracy itself, of actively
 seeking an absolute monopoly of power, is shrewd-
 ly hidden behind the citizen's legitimate right to
 oppose and criticize the system. Paradoxically,
 democracy offers those seeking to abolish it a
 unique opportunity to work against it legally.
 They can even receive almost open support from
 the external enemy without its being seen as a
 truly serious violation of the social contract. The
 frontier is vague, the transition easy between the
 status of a loyal opponent wielding a privilege
 built into democratic institutions, and that of an
 adversary subverting those institutions. To totali-
 tarianism, an opponent is by definition subversive;
 democracy, for fear of betraying its principles,
 treats subversives as mere opponents.
 What we end up with in what is conventionally
 called Western society is a topsy-turvy situation in
 which those seeking to destroy democracy appear
 to be fighting for legitimate aims, while the de-
 fenders of democracy are pictured as repressive
 reactionaries.  Identification of democracy's in-
 ternal and external adversaries with the forces of
 progress, legitimacy, even peace, discredits and
 paralyzes the efforts of people who are only trying
 to preserve their institutions.
 Already besieged by this combination of hostile
 forces and negative logic, the democracies are also
 harassed by guilt-producing accusations and in-
 timidation such as no other political system has
 ever had to tolerate. Like the "industry of vice"

 D EMOCRACY may, after all, turn out to
 have been a historical accident, a
 brief parenthesis that is closing before our eyes.
 If so, in its modern sense of a form of society
 reconciling governmental efficiency with legiti-
 macy, authority with individual freedoms, democ-
 racy will have lasted a little over two centuries, to
 judge by the speed at which the forces bent on its
 destruction are growing. And, really, only a tiny
 minority of the human race will have experienced
 it. In both time and space, democracy fills a very
 small corner. The span of roughly two-hundred
 years applies only to the few countries where it
 first appeared, still very incomplete, at the end of
 the 18th century. Most of the other countries in
 which democracy exists adopted it under a century
 ago, under half a century ago, in some cases less
 than a decade ago.
 Democracy probably could endure if it were the
 only type of political organization in the world.
 But it is not basically structured to defend itself
 against outside enemies seeking its annihilation,
 especially since the latest and the most dangerous
 of these external enemies-Communism-parades
 as democracy perfected when it is in fact the abso-
 lute negation of democracy, the current and com-
 plete model of totalitarianism.
 Democracy is by its very nature turned inward.
 Its vocation is the patient and realistic improve-
 ment of life in a community. Communism, on the
 other hand, necessarily looks outward because it
 presides over a failed society and is incapable of
 engendering a viable one. The nomenklatura, the
 body of bureaucrat-dictators who govern the sys-
 }tem, has no choice, therefore, but to direct its
 abilities toward expansion abroad. It is also more
 skillful, more persevering than democracy in de-
 fending itself. Democracy tends to ignore, even
 deny, threats to its existence because it loathes

 20/COMMENTARY JUNE 1984
 that reform groups used to talk about, there is
 now an "industry of blame"; it promotes the now
 universally accepted notion that everything bad
 that happens in the Third World is the fault of
 forces necessarily and exclusively located in the
 "more advanced" or "rich" countries, meaning, in
 almost every case-and for good reason-the
 democracies.
 The major shareholders in this industry of
 blame are, first, the despots who oppress the peo-
 ples of that unfortunate Third World with im-
 punity. Next come the Communist countries, ex-
 ploiting the underdevelopment abroad that they
 cannot remedy at home and converting the poor
 nations into totalitarian military fortresses.
 Here too, in what are termed North-South rela-
 tions, foreign and domestic enemies of democracy
 are converging; their maneuvers are of no help at
 all in improving the lot of the poor countries, but
 they are marvelously effective in undermining the
 democracies' confidence in their own legitimacy,
 their own right to exist. The "progressive" support
 some Westerners give to the worst of the Third
 World regimes is merely a geographical relocation
 of what for sixty years was "progressive" support
 of the Soviet Union and, later, Mao Zedong's
 China: complicity by a part of the Western Left
 against the peoples of the less-developed countries
 and with the tyrants who enslave, brutalize, starve,
 and exterminate them.
 It seems, then, that the combination of forces-
 at once psychological and material, political and
 moral, economic and ideological-intent on the
 extinction of democracy is more powerful than
 those bent on keeping it alive. Democracy is not
 given credit for its achievements and benefits, but
 it pays an infinitely higher price for its failures,
 its inadequacies, and its mistakes than its adver-
 saries do.
 and foes with reasons why defending itself would
 be immoral and, in any event, superfluous, useless,
 even dangerous.
 Civilizations losing confidence in themselves:
 an old story in history. They stop believing they
 can survive, because of an internal crisis that is
 both insoluble and intolerable, or under threat
 from an external enemy so strong that the only
 remaining choice is between servitude and sui-
 cide. I do not believe democracy is in either pre-
 dicament, but it acts as if it were in both. It
 seems almost eager to believe in its own guilt and
 in the inevitable result of that guilt. Democracy's
 predecessors hid such beliefs as shameful even
 when they thought, or knew, they were doomed.
 But democracy is zealous in devising arguments
 to prove the justice of its adversary's case and to
 lengthen the already overwhelming list of its own
 inadequacies.
 Are these inadequacies real or imaginary? Some
 are real, of course, just as there is real cause to
 blame specific democracies or the democracies in
 general for some of the injustice and misfortune
 in the world. But many of these alleged inade-
 quacies and much of the democracies' responsibility
 for the world's ills are exaggerated or conjectural
 or purely imaginary. And besides, are those real
 faults serious enough to provide moral justifica-
 tion for totalitarianism to exterminate the de-
 mocracies? And why are the imaginary flaws so
 widely credited in the democracies themselves,
 which thus consent to their own calumniation?
 If democracy does succumb, it will not be to
 the sort of internal crisis, an essential lack of
 viability, that nearly wrecked it between the two
 world wars. From 1919 to 1939, the democracies
 seemed to be eaten from within by an irresistible
 malady that raised a rash of right-wing dictator-
 to au-
 ships. One after another, they capitulated

 I NDEED,  democratic civilization is the
 first in history to blame itself because
 another power is working to destroy it. The dis-
 tinguishing mark of our century is not so much
 Communism's determination to erase democracy
 from our planet, or its frequent success in pursu-
 ing that end, as it is the humility with which de-
 mocracy not only consents to its own obliteration,
 but contrives to legitimize the victory of its dead-
 liest enemy.
 It is natural for Communism to try with all its
 might to eliminate democracy, since the two sys-
 tems are incompatible and Communism's survival
 depends on the annihilation of democracy. That
 the Communist offensive is more successful, more
 skillful than democracy's resistance, will be seen
 by history as just another example of one power
 outmaneuvering another. But it is less natural and
 more novel that the stricken civilization should
 not only be deeply convinced that it deserves to
 be defeated, but that it should regale its friends

 their own inability to govern themselves. In Cen-
 tral Europe, almost none of the parliamentary
 regimes established after World War I were still
 functioning ten years later. In Western Europe,
 first Italy went fascist, then Portugal, Germany,
 Spain. Of the great European powers, only Britain
 and France remained faithful to democracy, and
 in France democracy was so feeble, so incoherent,
 and so beleaguered that there were grave fears for
 its survival.
 The situation now, as the century nears its end,
 is nothing like that. For the first time since 1922,
 when Mussolini took power in Rome, all of West-
 ern Europe is democratic. The Greek colonels'
 seven-year dictatorship (1967-74) ended with their
 fall and a reinforcement of democracy there. In
 Spain, the Putsch dreaded since 1975 was tried
 and failed. The most dangerous, most unrelenting
 attacks against democracy have conic from the

 and West Germany, and a minority attempt in

 CAN THE DEMOCRACIES SURVIVE?/21
 1975 to saddle Portugal with a Communist mili-
 tary dictatorship.
 Despite these trials, the old democracies have
 held firm and the new ones have survived and
 even developed. The laborious effort the Left peri-
 odically makes to frighten people with the specter
 of a neo-Nazi peril in Europe always collides with
 the brute fact that none of the fascist movements
 in Europe today has reached party status or has
 managed to elect a member of any parliament. As
 for the stupidly inflated notion of an "extra-par-
 liamentary Left" that flourished in Italy and Ger-
 many around 1970, it expressed nothing more than
 the revolutionary Left's inability to seduce enough
 voters into making it parliamentary.
 Yet while democratic institutions are no longer
 challenged politically from within, the societies,
 civilization, and values democracy has created are
 being increasingly questioned. Self-criticism is, of
 course, one of the vital springs of democratic civili-
 zation and one of the reasons for its superiority
 over all other systems. But constant self-condemna-
 tion, often with little or no foundation, is a source
 of weakness and inferiority in dealing with an
 imperial power that has dispensed with such scru-
 ples. Believing one is always right, even when the
 facts say otherwise, is as blinding and weakening
 to a society as to an individual. But assuming one
 is always wrong, whatever the truth may be, is
 discouraging and paralyzing.
 Not only do the democracies today blame them-
 selves for sins they have not committed, they
 have formed the habit of judging themselves by
 ideals so inaccessible that the defendants are auto-
 matically guilty. Clearly a civilization that feels
 guilty for everything it is and does and thinks will
 lack the energy and conviction to defend itself
 when its existence is threatened. Drilling the idea
 into a civilization that it deserves defending only
 if it can incarnate absolute justice is tantamount
 to urging that it let itself die or be enslaved.
 T HE  same  problem  has  invariably
 plagued the foreign policy of the de-
 mocracies in the struggle against Communist im-
 perialism. From the day President Truman de-
 clared that "it must be the policy of the United
 States to support free peoples who are resisting at-
 tempted subjugation by armed minorities or by
 _.aufside pressure," the democracies were locked of
 their own free will into an almost insurmountable
 bind. For they laid down the condition that to
 have the right to resist absorption into the Com-
 munist empire, a country must be irreproachably
 democratic. In so doing, the West condemned it-
 self to failure or opprobrium. It became the pris-
 oner of an insoluble, self-imposed dilenuna: either
 it allowed most of the planet to sink under Com-
 munist domination, or, too often, it would be
 called on to protect countries that did not have
 democratic governments.
 The trap was a boon to Communist propaganda,
 which on this point was widely supported by the
 liberal Left in the democracies. And honesty does
 command that any democrat with consistent ideas
 deplore the hypocrisy of defending human rights
 and individual freedom while supporting authori-
 tarian governments. The best of these may be no
 more than relics or revivals of archaic power struc-
 tures, the worst are violent, police-run fascist re-
 gimes, or pseudo-democracies where elections are
 held only spasmodically; rarely, if ever, are they
 genuinely faithful to the ideal of the rule of law
 on which the West claims to base the legitimacy
 of its diplomacy and its defense.
 From the outset, then, the game has been un-
 fair. Strategic necessity is regarded as justification
 enough for a Soviet presence in another country,
 or a Soviet alliance with or aid to that country;
 anyone calling for further excuses is requested,
 even in the West itself, to mind his own business.
 A democracy, on the other hand, is not granted
 the right to defend the vital barricades of its own
 security  unless  the  democratic  imperative  is
 obeyed. If it is not, the West's duty is evidently
 to cede the territory in question to the Commu-
 nists who are unhampered by this democrats
 obligation.
 Thus, defending the independence of South
 Vietnam in the 1960's and 70's was tinged with
 infamy because the South Vietnamese regime was
 hardly one of exemplary purity. But the Hanoi
 regime had no need to furnish guarantees of its
 purity to win the right to defend itself or to at-
 tack its neighbors. Progressive and even centrist
 opinion throughout the world granted North Viet-
 nam "popular" legitimacy on trust, which its his-
 tory after 1975 did not support, but which its
 totalitarian and aggressive behavior even before
 1975 never seemed to diminish.
 Better still: if Moscow's worldwide strategic in-
 terests so require, the Soviet Union is allowed to
 ally itself with traditional-style fascist regimes that
 dispense with even a facade of progressivism. And
 the Soviets can do so without bringing clown on
 their heads the vehement criticism that world
 opinion levels at any democratic nation attempt-
 ing the same expedient. The Soviet Union and
 Cuba, for example, loudly took Argentina's side
 against Britain in the 1982 Falkland Islands war
 simply because it was obviously in the Kremlin's
 interest to oppose the Western democracies: sud-
 denly, no one in the Communist world minded
 the evil international reputation of the "odious
 and bloody fascist dictatorship" of the junta in
 Buenos Aires.
 The Soviet Union, then, is licensed by most
 people to safeguard its economic interests and cap-
 italize on its strategic advantages by realistic links
 with any government notorious for its disregard
 of human rights. But we hear only clamor and
 vituperation when a Western country is cornered

 into collaboration with South Africa or the Shah's
 Iran or Turkey.
 This double standard gives the Soviet empire
 an automatic advantage over the West: it not only
 can defend itself and expand without having to
 bother about the rules governing the foreign
 policy of the democracies, Iiut its satellites and
 f clients are also exempted. This is really a two-
 pronged advantage: although it need not respect
 human rights at home, the Soviet empire is free
 to condemn violations, real or fictitious, anywhere
 else, to exploit them and set its agents to exploit-
 ing them. It can even provoke violations, using
 terrorism to elicit repression in the Western coun-
 tries or those associated with them.
 The Soviet Union, then, enjoys the privilege of
 being entitled not only to defend its empire, but
 to enlarge it without being judged on the basis of
 its subject states' standards of living, social justice,
 political freedoms, or respect for human rights.
 When subjugated peoples rise against Commu-
 nism, the West usually refrains from helping them,
 thus recognizing the legitimacy of Communist
 domination in all circumstances. The Commu-
 nists, on the other hand, recognize the legitimacy
 of no government outside their empire, least of
 all in the democratic countries.
 Conversely, the democracies suffer the theoreti-
 cal handicap in their struggle with the Soviet
 Union of being responsible on all the above-
 mentioned grounds both for their own behavior
 and for that of their _a_;esi For example, when
 military governments took over in Greece in 1967,
 and in Turkey ten years later, the question im-
 mediately arose in the democracies of whether
 these countries, which had broken faith with de-
 mocracy, deserved to remain within the Western
 defense system. But when Poland declared a state
 of martial law to allow its army to shore up the
 shaky Communist-party dictatorship, Westerners
 immediately argued that no real liberalization is
 possible in a country like Poland because it is a
 vital strategic zone for the Soviet Union. Yet
 Turkey is just as essential to the West as Poland
 is to the Soviets. Driving it out of NATO, or even
 suspending weapons shipments to the Turkish
 army (which was done because of the Greco-Turk-
 ish conflict over Cyprus in 1974), means opening
 a fatal breach in the Atlantic alliance's southern
 flank.
 D ETRACTORS  of the United States and
 the "free world"-the expression is
 usually employed as a term-'of derision, as though
 there were not really a free world and a slave
 world-have always maintained that we cannot
 fight in the name of democracy by consorting with
 non-democratic countries. And, of course, it would
 be ideal if the democracies could survive by
 defending only other democracies. In most cases,
 however, this moral ideal runs up against local
 traditions of government or de-facto situations
 the West cannot easily alter. President Carter's
 human-rights policy, tinder which he suspended
 American aid to the dictatorships in Argen-
 tina, Chile, and Bolivia, produced no political
 improvement in those countries, but the Sovi t
 Union leaped into the breach to increase trad
 with them. In Iran, Carter hastened the fall o
 what was certainly a detestably tyrannical regim
 -which was succeeded by a much worse one.
 It takes a profound ignorance of history to
 blame American imperialism alone for the long
 Latin American tradition of coups d'etat, military
 dictatorships, civil wars, corruption, revolution,
 bloody terror, and repression; all this goes back to
 the very founding of independent states nearly
 two centuries ago. On the African continent, it is
 striking that one-man, one-party rule has tri-
 umphed almost everywhere, in North Africa and
 Black Africa, in the former French colonies as in
 the former Belgian and British colonies, in "pro-
 gressive" and "moderate" regimes alike. Even such
 leaders as President-for-Life Kenneth Kaunda in
 Zambia and Zimbabwe's Prime Minister Robert
 Mugabe, after opting for multiparty systems when
 their  countries  received  independence,  soon
 changed their minds on the ground that one-party
 systems are "more in tune with the African char-
 acter." Some of the most barbarous examples of
 internal genocide, like the slaughter in Burundi,
 had nothing at all to do with Western "imperial-
 ism"; neither have some of Africa's most mon-
 strous tyrants, such as Uganda's Idi Amin. And for
 the people of Uganda, the country's "liberation"
 from Amin by troops from "progressive" Tan-
 zania inaugurated an era of suffering and martyr-
 dom that has been every bit as abominable as the
 one that preceded it.
 In any case, the free world's moral turpitude
 and political inconsistency are recognized, pro-
 claimed, and condemned whenever it collaborates
 with largely or wholly undemocratic governments
 that violate human rights, whether it merely ac-
 cepts them passively or assists them actively. To
 escape this contradiction and avoid condemnation
 before the tribunal of free-world opinion, the
 West must therefore deny itself the support, in its
 struggle against Soviet expansionism, of any coun-
 try that is undemocratic and disrespectful of
 human rights. This principle means that the right
 of the democracies to defend themselves must be
 subordinated to the conversion of the whole
 world to democracy. Clearly, this can only lead to
 the disappearance of what subsists of democracy
 in today's world.
 In short, without always going so far as to ap-
 prove, we nevertheless consider it natural for the
 Soviet Union to defend its interests, increase its
 power, install its henchmen through a craftily
 spaced series of coups d'etat and purges. No one
 asks these imperialists to make the people they

 capture happy; no one thinks the Communists can
 be scolded into retreating. Nor does anyone in the
 democratic camp recognize his own right-not
 openly, at least-to fight Soviet imperialism with
 its own weapons. Instead, the free world again
 risks being accused of impure complicity with a
 reactionary "feudal" regime when it defends Saudi
 Arabia, say, against the undermining and subver-
 sion that the Soviet Union and its agents, includ-
 ing the Libyans, have been carrying on there for
 years. The moral is that the Soviet Union must be
 allowed to take over the Arabian peninsula unless
 all the countries there mold themselves to Western
 democratic ideals, an eventuality I would wish for
 but scarcely expect, at least in the immediate
 future, which is all that counts.
 Acso at stake in the immediate or very
 near future is the fate of southern
 Africa, especially that of the Republic of South
 Africa, which has earned the rightful hostility of
 all defenders of human rights for its official policy
 of racial segregation. That it should be excluded
 from all international sports events is not sur-
 prising-until  we  remember  that  the  Soviet
 Union, the People's Republic of China, North
 Korea, and Rumania, which have as many or more
 human-rights blots on their records, do take part
 in these events.
 This is another example of the double standard.
 But athletics is just a side issue here. What really
 matters is whether the West should, as the most
 enlightened and respectable voices of Western
 public opinion recommend, refuse any political
 and strategic cooperation with South Africa until
 apartheid has been eliminated. Considering that,
 at best, it would take a long time to end racial
 segregation in South Africa, that the Soviet Union
 is already strongly entrenched in the region, and
 that the slow process of reform might be radically
 accelerated by an uprising of South Africa's blacks,
 the West might gain little from abandoning
 South Africa and would certainly be seriously
 weakened. For, as we know, the sea route around
 the Cape of Good Hope is the main channel for
 our supplies of oil from the Persian Gulf. More-
 over, South Africa's soil holds most of the world's
 deposits of rare minerals outside the Soviet Union,
 supplying most of the metals needed by the in-
 -- dustrialized countries.
 In other words, if South Africa were to come
 under Soviet influence, Moscow would control not
 only its own vast mineral resources, but also
 those of South Africa and Namibia, where the pro-
 Communist SWAPO (Southwest African People's
 Organization) is likely to take power. The Soviet
 Union would then have a stranglehold on most
 and, in some cases, all the minerals vital to our
 industries. It could block oil shipments to us-if
 it had not already shut them off at the source
 along the Persian Gulf. That kind of economic
 power would make the Soviet Union master of
 the West without recourse to war, nuclear or
 conventional, in Europe.
 The Soviet Union's great strength lies in its
 freedom to invade areas where history has left the
 decaying remnants of archaic regimes that are
 important to the West's security or are sources of
 vital materials. Never mind that these regimes are
 replaced, as they always are, by bloodier, more re-
 pressive Communist police states and that the
 change leaves the area's poor more starved than
 they were before. The Soviets still come out ahead.
 For local and world opinion perceive the relative
 advantages of the old regime and the horrors of
 Communist putrefaction only after the new re-
 gime is in power and irreversible.
 When the West tries to protect archaic regimes
 or those of "modernistic authoritarians" like the
 Shah of Iran from disintegration, or attempts to
 restrain their abuses, it cannot help seeming to
 defend the Right against the Left, the past against
 the future, the billionaires against the poverty-
 stricken masses. The fact that when the Commu-
 nist Left overturns the Right it brings with it ram-
 pant famine, the camps, and the boat people never
 works as a preventive. If the West tries to pressure
 an archaic regime into becoming more liberal,
 either it is accused of "interference" by outraged
 nationalists,  or  its  well-meaning  proselytizing
 shoves the country into unforeseeable chaos, as
 exemplified by the Islamic revolution in Iran. And
 while the Ayatollah's bloody terror may now be
 partly anti-Communist for essentially religious
 reasons, the Kremlin knows very well that in the
 long run, when the brink of anarchy is reached,
 Iran may topple into the Soviet camp, but is un-
 likely ever to tip back into the free world.
 The Soviet Union's advantage over the free
 world is that neither world opinion nor, of course,
 its own muzzled public expects it to preach to its
 allies before associating with them, or to hold on
 to its satellites by any method but sheer force; it
 is not even required to provide enough food for
 the peoples it absorbs into its imperial system.
 But "international opinion"-the phrase de-
 scribes part of the free world's public opinion plus
 Soviet propaganda-will not accept violation of
 the rules of democracy by the West's friends. Even
 when such countries as Taiwan, South Korea,
 Malaysia, and Singapore develop thriving econo-
 mies that most other nations in the Third World
 envy and that would bring cries of admiration
 from the Western Left if they blossomed under
 Soviet banners, they are not appreciated. For they
 have curtailed their citizens' freedom. The social-
 ist regimes, of course, have obliterated freedom
 without even achieving comparable prosperity.
 Tills inequality of duties that so favors
 the Communists over the free world,
 however, prevents no one from turning around

 For example, a doctrinally pure French Social-
 ist, Louis Mermaz, president of the National As-
 sembly since 1981, replied to a reporter's question
 about the gulags: "I am as horrified as you are by
 the gulags, which are a perversion of Commu-
 nism. But I ask that you also condemn that mon-
 strosity of the capitalist system: hunger through-
 out the world that kills 50 million people each
 year, 30 million of them children." The retort,
 remarkable for its speed, is less so for its objec-
 tivity. For the parallel is only apparent: the gu-
 lags are a "perversion" of Communism, but fam-
 ine, according to the Socialist leader, is a product
 of the basic nature of capitalism. And while the
 magic of parallelism makes the Communist sin
 almost venial, that of capitalism remains mortal.
 Indeed, absolution is usually a one-way grant-to
 forgive the horrors of Communism. It seems un-
 likely that, if questioned on famine in the world,
 Mermaz would have replied with a diatribe
 against the gulags; he would have protested vio-
 lently against the shocking malnutrition of some
 of our fellow humans, and he would have been
 right. That the gulags exist does not make Third
 World poverty less morally intolerable. But by
 what sorcery is the reverse true?
 Besides, the magician was using phony statistics.
 As demographers know, some 50 million people
 die in the world every year. They can't all die of
 starvation and three-fifths of them can't be chil-
 dren. The fight against infant mortality in the
 poor countries has reduced its incidence, which is
 I Am not going here into why industrial
 capitalism, the first and only system of
 production that has wrested people from penury
 and that could perform the same service for those
 still experiencing penury, is the most decried. Nor
 will I waste time arguing at length that since the
 18th century, the nations where industrial capital-
 ism has developed also happen to be those where
 modern democracy took root. This does not mean
 that these countries have kept consistent faith
 with democracy, or that democracy is found wher-
 ever capitalism goes. But it does mean that two
 centuries of history are witness to a general con-
 comitance between capitalism and democracy. I
 will only note that this monumental file of evi-
 dence has been filched and that the democracies
 themselves have adopted the Communists' image
 of the world and their perspective on history.
 The falsest and most pernicious characteristic
 of this image and this perspective lies probably in
 the antithesis between socialism and capitalism,
 between totalitarianism and democracy. This func-
 tions in most minds as an interpretive grid, even
 for those opposed to socialism. Its imposition is
 not the least of disinformation's victories, for this
 disinformation no longer bears on events, but on
 ideas; it is philosophical disinformation, a sort of
 ideological mole that has burrowed into the under-
 standing most of its have of these forces.

 CAN THE DEMOCRACIES SURVIVE?/25
 democratic maybe likened to totalitarianism and-
 so loses its right to defend itself against Commu-
 nism. Since the world is full of governments that
 are neither totalitarian nor democratic,  their
 futures are sealed. For one thing, because none
 of the democracies, even those recognized as such,
 is perfect, and since there are oppressive features
 to any society, which regime can claim a genuine
 right to defend itself against Communism? None.
 And, following the same line of reasoning, if all
 that need be done to legitimize Communism is to
 show that capitalism has its faults, its vices and
 crises, then let world power be turned over to the
 Communists at once, on the principle that the best
 way to correct a limp is to cut off both legs.
 The real antithesis is not that of totalitarianism
 to democracy or Communism to capitalism, but of
 totalitarian Communism to all the rest. Commu-
 nism is a necrosis of economics, totalitarianism a
 necrosis of politics, of the body civic and of cul-
 ture. As a dead society, totalitarianism can be con-
 trasted with countless social forms now and in the
 past that cannot be called democratic as the term
 is understood in a few societies today, but which
 were not and are not dead, either. Medieval Eu-
 rope, Ming China, African, Polynesian, and Amer-
 ican societies before their contact with Europeans,
 the France of Louis XV and Napoleon III, Eliza-
 bethan England, the Spain of Philip IV, India
 under the Gupta dynasty and the Germany of
 Kant's day were neither democratic nor totalita-
 rian, but they were all living societies that, each
 in its own way, created valuable civilizations.
 The existence of injustice, persecution, oppres-
 sion in a group is one thing; for a group to be a
 negation of human nature in every aspect of its
 structure and ideology is something else again.
 This is the group to which totalitarianism be-
 longs. True, today we believe that to fulfill them-
 selves, all societies should aspire to democracy,
 progress toward it, and finally achieve it. I cer-
 tainly do. Nevertheless, thousands of social or-
 ganizations down through history, while not com-
 parable to modern democracies, were not nega-
 tions of humanity and did contribute elements of
 civilization to our present patchwork culture.
 Unlike capitalism, Communism is not an eco-
 nomic system, it is a political system that must
 necessarily asphyxiate an economy. We should
 therefore refuse to lump Communism in with
 other authoritarian systems or them with it. Total-
 itarianism endangers not democracy alone, but
 life itself. Communism is not simply one despotic
 political system among many, or one inefficient
 and unjust economic system among others. In nor-
 mal life, despotism and inefficiency are among the
 rare qualities that can be corrected, as is shown
 by all of history-except the history of Commu-
 nism. To survive, Communism seeks to destroy not
 just existing democracy, but every possibility of
 democracy.
 Any society of any type in the world today can
 accede to democracy, with a single exception: Com-
 munist society, which cannot go democratic with-
 out destroying itself. Understandably, then, total-
 itarian strategists try to reverse or block this ten-
 dency in the still malleable world around them.
 What is less easy to understand is that they can
 recruit some of their assiduous disciples from
 among democracy's guides and thinkers.
 B UT recruit them they do. Broad sectors
 of public opinion and of the West's
 political and cultural elite see the democracies as
 more reactionary, more damaging to the Third
 World, more aggressive militarily, especially as
 regards nuclear warfare, than the Soviet Union
 and its satellites. Westerners who favor an effec-
 tive nuclear deterrent and a verifiable balance of
 forces are still viewed as "conservatives," "right-
 wingers," "warmongers," or, at best, as "cold
 warriors." Those "liberals" advocating unilateral
 disarmament or, at any rate, prior and increasingly
 juicier concessions to the Soviet Union without
 reciprocal guarantees are considered generous souls
 who love peace.
 In practice, what these "liberals" are really pro-
 moting is an imbalance that would enable the
 Soviet Union to force its economic and political
 will on a growing number of countries without
 going to war, thus enlarging an already spacious
 orbit. For history teaches us that never, anywhere,
 have concessions coaxed the Soviet Union into
 making concessions. From this unhappy truth, for
 which they are in no way responsible, the demo-
 cracies do not conclude that they must change
 their diplomatic approach, but that they must
 concede still more.
 Indeed, anyone with his ear to the political
 ground might think the only danger to the West
 is Western arms and Western diplomacy. For ex-
 antple, the New York Tinies of April 2, 1983 an-
 nounced that "An Adverse Impact Among Allies
 Is Feared After Reagan Remark on Soviet Superi-
 ority." That is, the real danger to America's Euro-
 pean allies is not seen as possible Soviet military
 superiority but in America's plan to counter it by
 reinforcing West European defenses. Any President
 of the United States visiting Western Europe has
 been treated to demonstrations so hostile that an
 unsuspecting spectator would think he were the
 worst enemy Europe ever had.
 True, the people often show better judgment
 than the elites and the activists. In 1982, a survey
 revealed that all the peoples of Western Europe
 except the Spanish thought the growth of the
 Soviet military potential was more important in
 explaining international tension than the growth
 of America's military potential. (This had its
 clownish side, however: by a mat-gin of 45 percent
 to 21 percent, the French people believed that
 American interest rates and the dollar's role in

 26/COMMENTARY JUNE 1984
 international finance were much more serious causes
 of tension than the USSR's bulging arsenal.)
 Despite an improved and, by 1981, clearer per-
 ception of Soviet power, or perhaps because of the
 realism of that perception, most Europeans, and not
 just militant pacifists, said that if their countries
 were invaded, they would rather submit than re-
 sist. Asked in another poll, "If the Soviet army
 entered French territory, do you think the Presi-
 dent of France should immediately open peace
 talks with the Soviet Union?," 63 percent of the
 French answered "yes," 7 percent favored the use
 of nuclear weapons, and 31 percent thought France
 should fight, but without using its nuclear missiles.
 Now, one may very well prefer servitude to
 death. But we can also avoid putting ourselves
 in a situation in which that grim choice is all that
 is open to us. Yet the will to avoid such a situa-
 tion is precisely what the West seems to lack. The
 relentless Soviet "peace offensive," therefore, has
 every chance of succeeding, that is, of persuading
 the West and the rest of the world to accept per-
 manent military inferiority by portraying this as
 an absolute guarantee against war.
 Any normal person naturally hates the idea of
 war, and, of course, this feeling interferes with
 proper public information about strategy,  as
 though the information itself were dangerous. But
 a Soviet "peace" is synonymous with subjugation,
 for which the West is already being psychological-
 ly conditioned, and its continued pursuit will lead
 by imperceptible stages to a state of undeclared
 but total satellization. Even economic weapons,
 not to mention military deterrence, have been for-
 bidden to the West, or rather, the West has for-
 bidden itself to use them. This refusal to apply
 stern economic sanctions against the Soviet Union
 must have vastly reassured the men in the Krem-
 lin. And if the West can no longer resort to a
 credible strategic deterrent or to economic weap-
 ons, what is there to prevent the Soviet Union
 from continuing to trample the sovereignty of oth-
 er countries, other continents, the whole world?
 The practical conclusion Communist leaders
 draw from Western military and economic pas-
 sivity is that they can go right on doing what
 they have been doing. Jean-Francois Deniau, a
 former cabinet minister under Giscard d'Estaing,
 quoted a high Soviet official as having told him:
 We took Angola and you (lid not protest. We
 even saw that you could have beaten us in An-
 gola-the government was on our side, but it
 was within an ace of giving up-and that you
 did nothing to win; on the contrary. And when,
 to save ourselves, we sent in 30,000 Cuban sol-
 diers, Ambassador Andrew Young, a member of
 the American cabinet, said it was a positive step
 and an element of stability. All right, we noted
 the fact and included it in our analyses. Then
 we took Mozambique. Forget it, you don't even
 know where it is. Then we took Ethiopia, a key
 move. There again we noted that you could have
 replied via Somalia or Eritrea or both. No reply.
 We noted that and put it into our analyses.
 Then we took Aden and set up a powerful
 Soviet base there. Aden! On the Arabian penin-
 sula! In the heart of your supply center! No re-
 sponse. So we noted: we can take Aden.
 THROUGHOUT the course of relations be-
 tween the Communist and democratic
 worlds, the question of which will destroy the
 other has always been obscured in the democratic
 camp by adventitious side issues. Communism's
 leaders have never concealed their belief that this
 is the only question that counts and that they are
 determined to answer it with a total Communist
 victory. No temporary compromise, they feel, can
 alter the final judgment of history.
 If people in the West find it hard to bear this
 vision of merciless struggle between the two forms
 of sociev, if they sometimes drive it out of their
 minds, it is partly because the socialist cause was
 forged within the democracies themselves in the
 19th century, was one of their offspring that then
 became an independent component of political
 life. We have trouble understanding that this off-
 spring's heir presumptive, 20th-century Commu-
 nism, has assumed the historical mission of de-
 stroying the democracy from which it issued. We
 persist in viewing it as just another political per-
 suasion that may have degenerated, but which can
 mend its ways, calm down, participate someday in
 a global concert. To think otherwise, we feel, sins
 against tolerance. Unfortunately, the democracies
 are not making the rules in this game. The Com-
 munists in no way share their concern for toler-
 ance and the coexistence of systems.
 Communism considers itself permanently at
 war with the rest of the world, even if it must
 occasionally agree to an armistice. This is nothing
 to be indignant about. We must simply recognize
 it; unless we do, we obviously cannot begin taking
 suitable political countermeasures. The Commu-
 nists' war is fought in many ways. If necessary,
 this includes military action, but to Commu-
 nism's leaders, all forms of action are part of this
 war, beginning with negotiation, at least their
 very particular notion of negotiation.
 In their minds, the aim of negotiation has
 never been to reach a lasting agreement, but to
 weaken their adversary and prepare him to make
 further concessions while fostering his illusion
 that the new concessions will be the last, the ones
 that will bring him stability, security, tranquillity.
 The Soviets' "peace" propaganda, which to them
 means convincing others not to defend themselves,
 always overlies a threat of war, of implicit intimi-
 dation that exploits our very justifiable fear of
 an atomic cataclysm. This belligerent demand for
 peace merely summons the democracies to buy
 their security with slavery; it is an elaborate way
 to say "surrender or be wiped out." It has been
 called "attack through pacifism."

 CAN THE DEMOCRACIES SURVIVE?/27
 Because in its social system, as in its foreign
 policy, Communism is meeting increasing disap-
 proval, Communist leaders do not rely much any
 more on honey to catch their future victims (ex-
 cept, perhaps, in some badly informed Third
 World countries). Having given up trying to se-
 duce the unwary by pretending to represent leftist
 ideals, they are stripping off their mask and using
 pure force. Unlike the Western leadership, which
 is tormented by remorse and a sense of guilt, the
 Soviet leaders have perfectly clear consciences,
 which allows them to use brute force with utter
 serenity both to preserve their power at home and
 to extend it abroad.
 Many in the West take comfort from the in-
 ternal weaknesses of Communism-especially its
 economic inefficiency. But I for one am more
 frightened than comforted by these weaknesses. A
 system that has grown so strong despite so many
 failings, that increasingly dominates the world
 even when no one wants anything to do with it,
 at least not the majority of the people in the
 countries it seeks to penetrate, and that, where it
 is in power, everyone except the nomenklatura
 longs to be rid of-this system must nevertheless
 embody a principle of action and a monopoliza-
 tion of power more effective than any mankind
 has ever known before. Communism and the
 Soviet empire are unprecedented in history. None
 of the classic concepts that make the past intelli-
 gible explains Communist imperialism. The Soviet
 empire does not follow the bell-shaped expansion-
 ist curve of previous empires. Yet the democracies
 persist in believing that it will decline of itself
 and inevitably grow more moderate.
 The truth is, however, that the longer Soviet
 Communism lasts, the more expansionist it be-
 comes and the more difficult it is to control. Other
 Communist states, notably Cuba, Vietnam, and
 North Korea, have shown similar propensities for
 conquest. It does not follow that because Commu-
 nism is showing signs of rot and suffers reverses,
 it will turn to the path of peace. Except when
 they were disintegrating, few other empires had
 to deal with as many national and popular re-
 bellions as the Soviet empire has had since 1953.
 But it has withstood and quelled them without
 going to pieces. And these difficulties have in no
 way slowed its expansionist thrust.
 Frequently, part or all of a Soviet ruler's reign
 is scarred by serious setbacks. This happened under
 Stalin from 1925 to 1935, it happened during the
 reign of Khrushchev, who for a while seemed to be
 digging the empire's grave, and in the years imme-
 diately following his fall: the break with China,
 the loss of Albania, North Korean and Vietnamese
 neutrality in the Moscow-Peking quarrel, insurrec-
 tions in Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia,
 Rumania's new standoffishness, cracks in the mono-
 lithic Communist International. Yet never did the
 empire expand so much or so boost its military
 power as in the years that followed this critical
 period.
 The closer we get to the end of the century, the
 more Communist imperialism becomes the chief
 problem of our time. No other threat to world
 freedom has endured as long. Other totalitarian
 systems were defeated or simply crumbled with
 age. In many other unhappy countries that have
 been or still are ruled by dictators, democracy and
 dictatorship-or, at least, adulterated forms of dic-
 tatorship (and democracy)-have swept in and out
 like tides. Only Communist totalitarianism is both
 durable and immutable.
 To THE question of what should the non-
 Communist countries do, I am tempted
 to answer by turning to Demosthenes. "Some peo-
 ple," he said, "think they can stump the man who
 mounts the tribune by asking him what's to be
 done. To those I will give what I believe is the
 fairest and truest answer: don't do what you are
 doing now."
 This is not as summary an answer as it seems,
 even to today's problems. What, indeed, can we
 do? To go on as we have been doing would guar-
 antee the continued advance of totalitarianism,
 for, as experience has shown, it will not be stopped
 by its own weaknesses and internal failures.
 A second option is based on the hope that the
 Soviet Union will change its ways voluntarily if we
 acknowledge its place in the sun and show clearly
 through concessions that we have no intention of
 attacking it. Anchored to peaceful coexistence and
 detente, this option has too adequately proved its
 harmfulness to warrant further discussion. But
 since we have yet to scrap it, I can only warn peo-
 ple not to count on it to save us. It will keep us out
 of war by ushering us into subordination or slavery.
 A third choice proposed, reviving-horrorsl-
 the "cold war," which we are so repeatedly admon-
 ished not to do, really does not exist, since there
 has never been a cold war. What is called the cold
 war has simply been a toned-clown version of
 detente that has certainly not attained its theoreti-
 cal goal of "containment." The democracies selfish-
 ly thought to use detente to guarantee their own
 security by signing treaties finally and officially
 confirming the subjugation of the peoples already
 under Communist dictatorship. In this they have
 failed. All we have succeeded in doing is abandon-
 ing these enslaved peoples to their masters. As he
 was being exchanged for a Chilean Communist, the
 Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky found a cruel
 symbol of this complicity: "The Chekist [secret
 policeman] who took off my handcuffs, remarked
 for my edification, 'These handcuffs, incidentally-
 they're American.' And he showed me the stamp.
 As though I had waited this long to learn that
 since the Soviets took power, or just about, the
 West has been supplying us with handcuffs, literal-
 ly and figuratively."

 28/COMMENTARY JUNE 1984
 Yet this complicity has not brought us the
 security we expected from it. Never were the de-
 mocracies more vulnerable, more baffled, more ex-
 posed to the blows of Communist imperialism
 than they were when the so-called detente period
 ended. The years since 1981 have been especially
 tragic, with confusion sown in the democratic
 camp by the Polish and Afghan affairs, by the
 democracies' gradual but irresistible acceptance of
 Soviet military superiority despite the more and
 more threatening, impudently biting, and brutal
 way the Kremlin talks to them.
 Some responsible thinkers are pessimistic enough
 to believe that the West has become so docile that
 it can no longer call a halt without risking war. I
 have reached the opposite conclusion. I am con-
 vinced that the Soviets are intent on maintaining
 their nuclear superiority over Western Europe as
 a way to increase their pressure on us without be-
 ing dragged into a general war while gradually dis-
 engaging the United States from the continent of
 Europe. Thus the Western nuclear deterrent re-
 mains the principal guarantor of peace it has
 proved to be for the past thirty-five years. The
 nomenklatura doesn't want to die either.
 Once this first point is well understood, and
 acted upon, the second article of a worthy foreign ,v
 policy would be to reply to any Soviet encroach=
 ment with immediate reprisals, mainly economic,
 and to make no further concessions without mani-
 fest, equivalent, and palpable counterconcessions.
 The free world's revised foreign policy must and
 can have a precise objective: to make the Soviets
 understand once and for all that the irrevocable
 prior condition for resumption of negotiations and
 the granting of concessions of any kind is a defini-
 tive halt to Communist imperialism everywhere in
 the world.
 Activating this new policy, which really would
 be no more than a return to normal diplomacy,
 presupposes an almost total Western intellectual
 reconversion, sound understanding-at last-of
 what Communism is and how it works, and a
 hitherto unprecedented harmonization and coordi-
 nation of policy among all the democracies. This
 amounts to saying that while such a new diplo-
 matic departure appears objectively possible, it
 seems to me highly unlikely because of the intellec-
 tual frivolity, indecisiveness, and discord of the
 men called on to apply it. And that is why I fear
 that democracy may not survive the closing years
 of the 20th century.
