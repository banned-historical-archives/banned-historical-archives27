 Review
 The serious escalation in the level and intensity of terrorist violence in the Middle
 East should not be allowed to obscure the positive developments of 1983, a year
 when not all terrorists had it their own way. The picture brightened most in
 Western Europe:
 ? In Italy, the number of violent terrorist events was well down from previous
 years. The Red Brigades, decimated by arrests and defections, limited them-
 selves primarily to rebuilding efforts. Threatened terrorist incidents at Comiso,
 Sicily, Italy's sole INF deployment site, did not materialize.
 ? In West Germany,, not one person died from terrorism during 1983. The hunted
 remnants of the Red Army Faction hardcore mounted no attacks, and their call
 for the amalgamation of "the guerrilla and the resistance" into a single front ap-
 parently went unanswered. Overall, the number of violent terrorist incidents
 decreased by about half compared with the previous year. Five of the six
 members of the Kexel-Hepp Group, the country's only rightwing terrorist cell,
 were arrested, and the sixth (Hepp) is believed to have fled the country.
 Terrorists threatened but failed to forestall the scheduled INF deployments.
 ? In Turkey, the military government completed its self-assigned task of suppress-
 ing both rightwing and leftwing terrorism in Turkey and turned back authority
 to a civilian government in a peaceful election.
 Even in the Middle East there were some bright spots in the picture:
 ? The Government of Iraq kicked Abu Nidal and his organization (formerly known
 as Black June) out of the country. It also apparently suppressed the sophisticated
 bombing operations of the Baghdad based 15 May Organization.
 ? The Government of Jordan refused to yield to Abu Nidal's demands that it
 release members of his group that it holds prisoner, even though as a
 consequence its diplomats have become the targets of repeated assassination
 attempts by the group.

 ? In an attempt to repair relations with certain moderate African and Arab states,
 Libya's Muammar Qaddhafi downplayed terrorism during the year. Threats
 against exiled opponents of Qaddhafi were not followed up.
 ? The Government of South Yemen ceased fomenting terrorist attacks against
 neighboring North Yemen and in general reduced its support for international
 terrorists.
 ? Despite serious setbacks to Yasir Arafat and his moderate supporters, their ban
 against international terrorist operations by the PLO continued in effect.
 In the Far East, South Korea resisted the blandishments of the Taiwan Govern-
 ment and upheld its international obligations by trying and sentencing to prison
 terms of seven to 10 years the four Chinese who mounted the first successful
 hijacking of a Chinese civil airliner.
 In Latin America, there were positive developments in a number of countries:
 ? The newly elected civilian government of Argentina has indicted several former
 military leaders on criminal charges in connection with the thousands of.
 "disappearances" which occurred while they were in power. And several
 Montonero leaders have returned to the country professing to have abandoned
 terrorist tactics in favor of peaceful political activity, which would be good news
 only if they mean it.
 ? In Honduras in early May, authorities captured three key members of the
 Popular Revolutionary Forces-Lorenzo Zelaya Command, the most violent
 Honduran terrorist group. Among those apprehended was the group's leader,
 Efrain Duarte, who was persuaded to identify other members of the group and
 provide details of Cuban and Nicaraguan support; ultimately, he even con-
 demned violent revolution at a government-sponsored press conference. The
 information he provided enabled the Honduran Government to arrest many
 members of the group and, for the present, render it ineffective as a revolution-
 ary force.
 ? In the fall, the Honduran military decimated a force of some 100 Honduran
 insurgents, backed by Cuba and Nicaragua, that had tried to establish a base of
 operations in the remote region of Olancho. The defeat was a serious setback to
 Cuban and Nicaraguan plans to destabilize the Honduran Government and to
 punish it for its support of anti-Sandinista forces and US regional policy.
 ? Several terrorist groups-the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) and the
 Movement of 19 April (M-19) in Colombia and the Shining Path in Peru-
 offered cease-fires. While these offers may have been tactical in nature (and may
 not be accepted), they demonstrate that the groups in question were failing to
 achieve their political objectives through purely terrorist tactics.

 Significant                Costa Rica: Militants Seize Control of Communist Party. Leading San Jose
 Developments               dailies reported that militant elements of Costa Rica's traditionally bland, pro-
 Moscow, nonviolent Popular Vanguard Party (PVP) seized control of the party's
 machinery in a vicious internal power struggle. According to the media reports, the
 militants advocate armed struggle and guerrilla warfare. PVP legislator Arnoldo
 Ferreto was quoted in the local press as stating, "We have a hundred companeros
 fighting in Nicaragua and we will send a thousand more if we have to." The PVP
 is the country's largest leftist party. It claims a membership of some 6,000 to
 7,000, can mobilize an estimated 50,000 union militants, and controls Costa Rica's
 most powerful union. The party
 currently maintains a 200-man paramilitary capability and provided the Sandinis-
 tas armed volunteers during their struggle against the Somoza regime.
 Italy: Antonov Under House Arrest. The Bulgarian Airlines functionary Sergei
 Antonov, under investigation for complicity in the May 1981 Papal assassination
 attempt, was released from prison and placed under house arrest, ostensibly
 because his health was deteriorating.                       Antonov is      25X1
 required to remain at home but may receive phone calls and visitors. His passport
 was lifted to prevent departure from Italy.                                 25X1
 Spain: Attack on Jordanian Officials. The Arab Revolutionary Brigades (ARB)
 claimed responsibility for the 29 December attack on two Jordanian officials in
 Madrid. We suspect the ARB is a cover name for Abu Nidal's organization, which
 has been attacking Jordanian officials abroad for the past few months. Earlier this
 month, Abu Nidal threatened Jordan with renewed terrorism if Amman continued
 to refuse to release imprisoned members of his group. In addition, Abu Nidal may
 be targeting Jordanians to dissuade King Hussein from reinitiating a dialogue with
 Yasir Arafat.
 Colombia: No Truce With Guerrillas. According to Defense Minister Landazabal,
 in late December President Betancur bowed to military pressure not to agree to a
 cease-fire with Colombian guerrillas. In recent weeks the Revolutionary Armed
 Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the 19th of April Movement (M- 19) announced

 Earlier this month, five exiled Montonero leaders, including Obregon Cano and
 Bidegain, published an open letter to President Alfonsin announcing they would.
 return to Argentina to pursue their political objectives through peaceful means.
 France: Moves Against Potential Iranian Terrorists. The French Government has
 moved to disrupt a potential Iranian terrorist network in France. According to
 press reports, France closed the Iranian Islamic Center in Paris, expelling three
 Iranian Embassy officials and eight members of the Center on the grounds it was a
 potential staging ground for terrorist operations in the country. Quoting French
 security service sources, the press reports indicated the Center was involved in
 propaganda activities in France and also was involved in preparations to assassi-
 nate Iranian exiles and conduct attacks against French interests as well. No
 connection has yet been established between the expulsions and the two bombings
 in Marseilles on 31 December.

 Nicaragua's Support of
 International Terrorism
 Nicaragua promotes and supports terrorism in Cen-
 tral America to further its primary objectives of
 preserving its revolutionary gains and destabilizing
 non-Marxist governments in the region. Managua
 provides revolutionary groups with arms, ammuni-
 tion, training, and safehaven, as well as propaganda
 and financial support. The Sandinistas also offer
 sanctuary to South American terrorists.
 In El Salvador
 The Salvadoran insurgents regularly employ terrorist
 tactics to intimidate the opposition and to coerce the
 uncommitted.
 Managua.serves as base and safehaven for
 the Salvadoran insurgent command whence it directs
 the political and military struggle
 Ma-
 nagua also furnishes large quantities o arms, ammu-
 nition, and other material received from Cuba, the
 Soviet Union, North Vietnam, and other sympathetic
 states. A variety of overland, sea, and air routes are
 used to transport war materials from Nicaragua to
 the Salvadoran guerrillas. Local revolutionary groups
 and sympathetic or corrupt officials facilitate this
 Sandinista leadership has described   Salvadoran
 guerrillas as "our shield"-viewing their survival as
 essential to the preservation of Nicaragua's revolu-
 tionary gains.
 In Honduras
 Nicaragua also serves as sanctuary for Honduran
 terrorist leaders and, in the past, has provided direct
 support for terrorist operations. These include the
 sabotage of two electric substations in July 1982 that
 blacked out 80 percent of the country's capital, cost
 the Honduran economy an estimated $20 million, and
 idled some 50,000 workers. There is also evidence that
 Managua may have provided direction and weapons
 to the terrorists responsible for the 1981 skyjacking of
 a Honduran airliner and may have played a role in the
 1982 seizure of the Chamber of Commerce Building
 in San Pedro Sula, an operation in which many of
 Honduras's financial leaders were taken hostage.
 In July 1983, a group of 96 Cuban-trained Honduran
 guerrillas infiltrated Honduras from Nicaragua. They
 were decimated by the Honduran military, and their
 leader, Reyes Matta-who reportedly served with
 Che Guevara in Bolivia and with the terrorist Rebel
 Armed Forces in Guatemala-was killed.
 In Guatemala
 Nicaragua, we believe, facilitates the travel of Guate-
 malan terrorists to Cuba and Eastern Europe for
 clandestine meetings and training.
 In Costa Rica
 In 1983, Costa Rican authorities charged Nicaragua
 with complicity in two assassination plots against
 Eden Pastora and the Costa Rican-based anti-Sandi-
 nista leadership. The arrest of a Basque terrorist,
 accused of involvement in this latest plot and allegedly
 tied to Managua, raises the possibility that extrare-
 gional terrorists with a high order of expertise are
 being imported by the Sandinistas to target opposition
 leaders.

 The Sandinistas have placed renewed pressure on
 President Monge to enforce Costa Rican neutrality in
 response to recent attacks by anti-Sandinista forces
 they charge are based on Costa Rican soil. This,
 coupled with Monge's antipathy towards Managua
 and his strong support of US policy in the region, we
 believe, could lead Nicaragua to sponsor terrorism
 targeted directly against the Costa Rican Government
 if the Sandinistas come to believe that San Jose,
 despite its declared neutrality, is unwilling to restrain
 the anti-Sandinista opposition. For such operations,
 Managua would probably use Costa Rican or third-
 country nationals to provide the Sandinistas a degree
 of plausible denial
 In South America
 Nicaragua also is a haven for South American terror-
 ists, including Argentine Montoneros and Uruguayan

 Threats and Hoaxes:
 Dealing With the Ambiguy
 of Nonviolent Terrorism
 The terms threat and hoax reflect a wide variety of
 terrorist actions, some of which have major impacts
 on the targets and victims. The fear engendered by a
 credible threat or hoax may be as intense as that
 resulting from a violent terrorist act-and sometimes
 more debilitating. Accordingly, in our computerized
 data bases we have been characterizing threats and
 hoaxes as terrorist incidents, thereby giving them the
 same statistical weight as bombings, armed attacks,
 and other forms of terrorist violence.
 But threats and hoaxes are not the same as other
 forms of terrorism. They do not involve direct physical
 violence, nor its customary consequences, personal
 injury or property damage. Instead they work at the
 psychic level, and the damage that they cause is often
 difficult to identify and usually impossible to quanti-
 fy. Consequently, threats and hoaxes are seldom
 taken very seriously or examined very closely by
 terrorism analysts.
 Thus there is a fundamental ambiguity in the way we
 think about and deal with terrorist threats and hoax-
 es. In the current period of heightened anxiety occa-
 sioned by recent major terrorist successes against US
 and allied targets in the Middle East, terrorist threats
 are being taken more seriously than usual, in some
 cases more seriously than necessary. The great num-
 ber of spurious threats tends to overload the system,
 interfering with the capability of potential US targets
 to recognize and protect themselves from true danger.
 Therefore, in an effort to assist those who must
 evaluate and respond to terrorist threats and hoaxes,
 we present below some facts and observations about
 the ambiguous terrain of nonviolent terrorism.
 Impact of Threats and Hoaxes
 The impact of a threat or hoax (not to be con-
 fused with the impact of the event itself, should it
 subsequently materialize) is almost completely depen-
 dent on whether it is believed or not.' If it is believed,
 or if the target is uncertain about whether to believe it
 or not, the impact can be severe. Our records are
 replete with examples in which buildings have been
 evacuated or closed (temporarily or even perma-
 nently), personal and physical security precautions
 upgraded (perhaps at great expense or inconvenience),
 diplomats, executives, officials, functionaries, and de-
 pendents moved or reassigned, trips called off and
 travelers rerouted, plans and programs substantially
 modified or even abandoned, all on account of terror-
 ist threats. Often, however, nothing is done at all
 because the threat is not believed.
 How does a target decide whether or not to believe a
 threat, whether or not to take action to try to avert the
 consequences? In our opinion, based on examination
 of data involving thousands-of international terrorist
 threats over the past 15 years, the impact of a threat
 or hoax is a product of the credulity of the target, the
 gravity of the anticipated consequences, and-clearly
 most important-the credibility of the threat.
 Credulity of the Target
 Whether a terrorist threat is believed, or has any
 impact at all, depends partly on who the target is.
 Some people are naturally more credulous than oth-
 ers, or more inclined to believe that bad things may
 happen to them, or more certain that enemies are out
 to get them. Other people, in contrast, may refuse to

 ' We are talking in this article about articulated threats-what
 prospective attackers say to their targets. We are not talking about
 perceived threats-what prospective targets apprehend about the
 danger they face. Such apprehension can spring from many
 sources-from an articulated threat, to be sure, but also from an
 intelligence report or analysis, from a tip by?a third party, or from
 an accretion of observations by an individual that causes him to
 conclude he is in danger.

 In the context of terrorism the terms threat and hoax
 may have have multiple meanings or connotations,
 depending on who is talking-or listening. In fact, in
 some cases the terms may be deemed interchange-
 able. Soon after beginning any discussion of these
 phenomena, then, we must carefully define our terms.
 For the purpose of recording incident data, we define
 a threat as the expression of an intent to inflict injury
 on a person or thing. It may be conditional: "We will
 get you unless you do this-or stop doing that. " Or
 absolute: "We will get you. no matter what you do. "
 The extortion of "revolutionary taxes "from Spanish
 businessmen and bankers by members of Basque
 Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) is a kind of condition-
 al threat. So was the recent vague but menacing
 message from an alleged spokesman for Islamic
 Jihad in Beirut, who gave the US and French Multi-
 national Force (MNF) contingents 10 days to get out
 of town or face "an earthquake. " In contrast, most of
 the hundreds of threatening telephone calls received
 around the world each year by US diplomatic and
 military installations are absolute threats, simple
 expressions of animosity coupled with a stated inten-
 tion to do harm.
 Threats should be distinguished from warnings, in
 which terrorists who have already arranged for vio-
 lence to occur, typically by planting a time bomb, try
 to limit the casualties, typically by encouraging
 persons in the immediate area to depart before the
 explosion. Warnings are not terrorist acts.
 For the purpose of recording incident data, we dine
 a hoax as an attempt to mislead someone into
 believing that a terrorist event has just occurred.
 (false notification) or is just about to occur (false
 Regardless of whether they are predisposed toward
 credulousness or skepticism, however, prospective
 targets come to rely heavily on their own experience in
 deciding whether to believe a terrorist threat. For
 example, if a particular installation had been the
 target, say, of 50 anonymous bomb threats over a
 warning). Most hoaxes are verbal. Commonly, an
 anonymous person telephones the target installation
 and announces that a time bomb has been planted
 there, but a subsequent search turns up nothing.
 Occasionally, a hoax takes the form of the planting of
 a dummy explosive device; this increases the ostensi-
 ble menace, since it demonstrates that the perpetrator
 had access to the premises and could have planted
 (and might still plant) a real bomb.
 It will be observed that we are treading through a
 semantic minefield. Most threats, after all, are also
 hoaxes, since the perpetrators rarely intend to follow
 through-but a target has no way of knowing that at
 the time the threat is made. By the same token, the
 planting of a fake bomb is surely a threatening act.
 Indeed, the very idea that someone hates you enough
 to try to trick you into thinking you are about to die
 is in itself threatening. Consequently, in examining
 the ramifications of threats and hoaxes, it is neces-
 sary to distinguish carefully between them. The
 distinction we employ, admittedly rather arbitrarily,
 is that threats refer to events which are to take place
 in the future, whereas hoaxes refer to events that
 have already taken place. Note that the actual intent
 of the perpetrator-to harm or. just to frighten-is
 not a distinguishing criterion. To cite two examples:
 ? Threat: 'I am going to plant a bomb in your
 embassy, " announces a telephone caller. (It is irrel-
 evant whether the caller actually intends to plant
 the bomb and equally irrelevant whether he later
 actually does so or not.)
 ? Hoax: "A bomb has been planted in your embassy, "
 announces a telephone caller, but a subsequent
 search turns up nothing, indicating he was lying.
 week or so, and if none of them had panned out, the
 person receiving the 51st anonymous bomb threat-
 no matter how credulous he was innately-would not
 take it nearly as seriously as he took the first one.

 Secret
 Gravity of the Consequences
 Other things being equal, a threat to level a building
 with a car bomb will have more impact than a threat
 to pour acid into the innards of a subway ticket
 vending machine. A threat to firebomb a crowded
 theater is clearly of more consequence than a threat to
 torch an automobile=even an occupied automobile,
 unless the occupant is a VIP.
 If the potential consequences are grave enough, even
 obviously incredible threats receive serious consider-
 ation even by extremely skeptical people. For exam-
 ple, threats involving the use of chemical, biological,
 or radiological agents always cause a flurry of activity
 and concern because the potential consequences might
 involve mass casualties or huge damage. This is so,
 even though acts of so-called hi-tech terrorism have
 been extremely rare and none have done much
 damage.
 Credibility of the Threat
 More influential than the credulity of the target or
 the gravity of the consequences, however, is the
 credibility of the threat itself. Deciding whether or not
 a threat z is credible, however, may be a complicated
 process, for credibility is the product of the interplay
 among several factors, including the identity, capabil-
 ities, and reputation (alleged, suspected, or known) of
 the person or agency making the threat and the
 context or environment in which the threat is made. If
 the threat is of an immediate, bomb-in-the-building
 nature, a decision must be made instantly, whether or
 not there is enough information at hand to determine
 whether the threat is credible. In most such cases, the
 target decides to evacuate now and evaluate later.
 ' All such incidents must be treated initially as threats or bona fide
 warnings; only after evaluation or more information can some be
 identified later as hoaxes.
 Identity. Determining the identity and affiliation of
 the person making the threat often involves negotiat-
 ing a maze of possibilities:
 ? The person making the threat may or may not
 identify himself. In the latter case, the threat is
 anonymous.
 ? If the person making the threat identifies himself,
 either as an individual or as a member of a particu-
 lar group, the name he gives may or may not be
 known to the target (or to the security authorities); if
 not, the threat might as well be anonymous.
 ? Even if the name given by the person making the
 threat is known to the target, it must nevertheless
 still be established whether this person is in fact the
 person he claims to be or actually represents the
 organization he claims to represent; if he is not, or
 does not, the threat might as well be anonymous.
 to distinguish their warnings from hoaxes, some ter-
 rorist groups offer proof of their bona fides.
 Capabilities and Reputation. However accomplished,
 once the identity and affiliation of the person making
 the threat have been firmly established, the probabili-
 ty that the threat is real may usually be determined
 rather easily. In most cases, this entails deciding (a)
 whether the authors of the threat are capable of
 carrying it out; and (b) whether they have a record of
 carrying out their threats.

 In contrast, consider the following hypothetical exam-
 ple: an anonymous telephoned threat to the effect that
 Black June will soon explode a nuclear device at the
 US Embassy in Beirut. Such a threat would not be
 credible. The organization almost certainly does not
 possess nuclear weapons, and it no longer uses the
 name Black June; thus the caller would probably be
 deemed a crank having no connection to the Abu
 Nidal Group and neither the intention nor the capa-
 bility of carrying out his threat.'
 Evaluating Anonymous Threats. The great majority
 of anonymous threats are never carried out. The same
 goes for most of the threats made by persons or in the
 names of organizations nobody ever heard of. And
 even threats made in the names of well-known terror-
 ist groups can often be discounted after a bit of
 thought. Suppose, for example, that a self-proclaimed
 spokesman for Islamic Jihad purported to announce
 the date and site of the next truck bomb attack
 against a US facility in Beirut. We should doubt the
 validity of this threat on the basis that such attacks
 succeed only through surprise and that Islamic Jihad
 would hardly provide what amounted to a warning
 that would eliminate any possibility of achieving
 surprise.`
 Nevertheless, once in a while an anonymous threat is
 followed by action. Occasionally, a new terrorist
 group announces its arrival by making a threat and
 then carrying it out. And just because the representa-
 tive of a real terrorist group cannot prove he is who he
 ' It should be noted, though, that the extreme gravity of such a
 threat would ensure that it received serious attention.
 ' At the same time, a report by an intelligence source-or even a tip
 by a one-time informant-that offered details of a planned car
 bomb attack by Islamic Jihad might be highly credible.
 says he is does not mean that what he says can safely
 be disregarded.
 Environment and Context. When the identity of the
 person making the threat cannot be established, the
 environment and context in which the threat was
 made take on increased importance. Almost any
 kidnaping threat in Colombia, for example, is credi-
 ble, because kidnaping seems to have become the
 Colombian national sport; more than 100 kidnapings
 have occurred there this year alone, and many of the
 kidnapers have never been identified. In Spain, so
 many Basque bankers and businessmen have been the
 victims of kidnapings, bombings, and other ETA
 depredations that explicit threats from this quarter
 are hardly needed any more; after numerous object
 lessons, many pay protection money without being
 asked. This must be the ultimately anonymous threat;
 yet its credibility is unquestioned.
 Recently one evening, the US Embassy in San Salva-
 dor received the following series of threatening, one-
 sentence telephone calls from an anonymous male
 who spoke English with a heavy Spanish accent:
 First call: "You will die tonight."
 Second call: "Americans ... [verb, obscene in
 context]."
 Third call: "You will die tonight."
 Fourth call: "There's a bomb in your Embassy."
 Fifth call: ". . . [obscene verb] you."
 After the fourth call (which was, in fact, the only
 explicit threat), Embassy security officials searched
 the chancery and grounds, with negative results. They
 also notified appropriate Embassy personnel and put
 into effect standing bomb drill procedures, checking
 the neighborhood to determine whether anybody
 might be watching; apparently nobody was. This was
 a case where the environment weighed heavily in the
 assessment of credibility. In other US installations in
 other countries, the calls might have been taken less
 seriously.

 Secret
 Threats as Indicators
 When all is said and done, it does not much matter to
 a target whether he learns of a possibly impending
 terrorist attack via an articulated threat or from an
 intelligence report or tip. In either case, he must go
 through a similar process of evaluation:
 ? To evaluate a threat, the target needs to identify the
 author and his affiliation; and if he can do so, he
 must then decide whether the group in question can
 and is likely to carry out its threat.
 ? To evaluate an intelligence report, the target needs
 to determine the reliability of the source and of any
 subsources; and if they seem reliable, he must then
 decide whether the group in question can and is
 likely to carry out the allegedly planned attack.
 It may be seen that, both in import and impact,
 terrorist threats are operatively much closer to warn-
 ings, tips, intelligence reports, and other indicators of
 impending terrorist attacks than they are to the
 attacks themselves. Partly for this reason, we have
 under reconsideration our longstanding practice of
 recording threats and hoaxes as terrorist incidents.'
 ' Another reason is our growing suspicion that most terrorist threats
 and hoaxes are perpetrated not by practicing terrorists but by
 feckless counterfeits who would never dare to act out their hostility.
 Probably more often than not, the author is an adolescent misfit
 acting in solitude or in the giggling company of others of his ilk. To
 liken such posturing to the activities of real terrorists may hinder
 rather than promote a clear understanding of the actual terrorist
 threat.

 Suddenly and without public notice, the Government of Djibouti tried, convicted,
 and sentenced to six months' imprisonment the three Palestinians who on 20
 January 1983 hijacked to Djibouti a South Yemen Airlines flight bound from
 Aden to Damascus. The light sentences violated the spirit if not the letter of
 international laws regarding air piracy. Since they had already spent 10 months in

 The bomb exploded outside the bank, causing property damage but no injuries. On
 14 November, Associated Press in West Berlin received an unsigned confessor
 letter which stated the bank had been singled out because of its support to the
 Turkish junta. Police believe the bombing was the work of Turkish leftists.

 6 December 1983        Guadeloupe: More Attempted Bombings
 Authorities disarmed two butane bombs in Point-a-Pitre, one under the car of the
 Sub-Prefet and the other under a military vehicle. These attempts followed the
 arrest on 5 December of three independence activists; they were charged with
 plotting against the state.
 16 December 1983       Guatemala: Ultrarightist Murdered
 A regional leader of the ultraright National Liberation Movement (MLN) in the
 Department of Chiquilmula was murdered by unknown assailants using automatic
 weapons. The facts surrounding the case are obscure, but the US Embassy doubts
 the killing was perpetrated by terrorists and suggests the MLN leader may have
 fallen victim to a family feud. The MLN has demanded a full investigation, and
 we believe the organization may use the incident to justify continued attacks
 against Guatemalan reformist and liberal elements as well as leftists.
 Peru: Terrorist Leader Captured
 Peruvian police arrested Antonio Diaz, a key lieutenant of Sendero Luminoso (SL)
 leader Abimail Guzman. Diaz was reportedly operational head of SL activities in
 much of southern Peru. This marks the first time since the SL began its armed
 campaign in the spring of 1980 that Peruvian security forces have captured a
 ranking terrorist leader.
 19-21 December 1983  Turkey: Abu Nidal Linked to Recent Bombings
 On 19 December in Izmir, a car bomb was discovered and defused at the French
 Cultural Center. On 21 December in Ankara, a car bomb exploded near the office
 and residence of PLO Representative Abu Firaz. No deaths were reported, but
 there were some injuries and property damage. A French weapon with a silencer
 was found at the scene. On 21 December in Istanbul, a bomb exploded near the
 Iraqi Consulate, injuring three people. Turkish police, after arresting several
 people, have established that members of Abu Nidal's group and at least one
 Syrian agent were responsible for all three bombings.
 20 December 1983       South Korea: Hijackers' Appeal Overturned
 The six Chinese found guilty of the first successful hijacking in Chinese aviation
 history lost their appeal to have their seven-to-l0-year sentences overturned. China
 is unhappy with the sentences and. wishes the hijackers returned to China-where
 the penalty for hijacking is death. Taiwan, which sees the hijackers as political ref-
 ugees, would offer them asylum if South Korea would release them.

 Madrid: Attack on Jordanian Officials
 One employee of the Jordanian Embassy in Spain was shot and killed and another
 wounded by an unknown assailant. The Arab Revolutionary Brigades (ARB)
 claimed responsibility in a call to the Agence France Press in Paris. We suspect
 that ARB is a cover name used by Abu Nidal's organization, which has been

 21 December 1983       South Korea: American Cultural Center Threatened
 In Kwangju an anonymous telephone caller claimed that there was a bomb in the
 building housing the American Cultural Center. A search produced negative
 results.
 21-27 December 1983    Lebanon: Continuing Attacks Against MNF
 Troops of the Multinational Force (MNF) in the Beirut area continue to be the tar-
 gets of terrorist attacks. On the afternoon of 21 December, a large truck bomb ex-
 ploded outside the French MNF headquarters killing at least one French soldier
 and nine Lebanese civilians, and wounding more than 125 others. US sources
 credit extensive fortification of the facility with preventing more French casualties.
 At about the same time, one person was killed in another blast at a bar in West
 Beirut frequented by US Marines. An individual claiming to represent the
 previously unknown "Black Palm" or "Black Hand" organization took credit
 immediately following both bombings in a telepone call to a Lebanese radio
 station. In a call to the French news agency in Beirut the following morning, an in-
 dividual also took credit for the headquarters bombing in the name of Islamic
 Jihad and warned.of further attacks if US and French forces were not withdrawn
 from Lebanon in 10 days.
 The same afternoon, a US airman searching for explosives was wounded'by a
 sniper. Neither the airman nor others present heard the shot fired, suggesting that
 the sniper may have used a silenced weapon.
 Finally, the first attack directed at British MNF forces was recorded on 27
 December, when a car bomb was detonated by remote control as a British convoy
 passed near it in the port area. Two British soldiers were slightly wounded; no
 group claimed credit for the attack.

 The Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms (ORPA) claimed responsi-
 bility for the bombing of a government information office located in an office
 building only two blocks from the US Embassy. The attack was carried out by
 three masked terrorists carrying automatic weapons. They set off three bombs
 which gutted the facility and caused heavy smoke damage in the rest of the
 building. No injuries were reported.
 Italy: Arrest Warrant for Yasir Arafat
 Italian dailies report that a Venice court has upheld an international arrest order
 for Yasir Arafat on charges that the PLO leader and Al Fatah were directly
 involved in supplying arms to the Red Brigades (BR) in 1978-79. Since an
 extradition agreement exists between Italy and Tunisia, Arafat could face arrest
 on the Italian charges when he sets foot on Tunisian territory-although this
 seems unlikely. The warrant against Arafat was first issued in September of this
 year by a Venetian magistrate but was rejected by his superiors due to a lack of
 solid evidence against Arafat personally. However, the Venetian "Liberty Tribu-
 nal" which later reviewed the case found the evidence-much of it based on the
 testimony of "repentant" BR members-strong enough to call for Arafat's arrest.
 Saudi Arabia: Bombing in Taif
 A series of bombs exploded at a power plant, causing extensive damage. No group
 has claimed credit, and the Saudi Government has made no public statements

 In Valletta, Esther Millo, the Israeli Charge d'Affaires, was shot at five times
 from close range by an assailant who approached on foot the parked car in which
 she was sitting. Improbably, none of the shots hit her, although she suffered minor
 cuts from pieces of glass. Some diplomats in Valletta suspect the Maltese
 Government-under pressure from Libya-was behind the attack, which may
 have been intended to frighten the Israelis into closing their mission.

 30 December 1983       Turkey: Fake Anti-US Banner Bomb
 In Izmir, police discovered a banner stretched across the street near Ege
 University bearing an anti-US slogan by the leftist Turkish terrorist group Dev Sol
 (Revolutionary Left) and attached to metal canisters believed to contain explosives.
 Police detonated the canisters and found both were empty. The use of banner
 bombs has been a trademark of Turkish terrorist groups; however, most have
 carried slogans about the Turkish military junta rather than anti-US statements.
 Spain: Bombings Continue in Basque Country
 In Plascencia de Las Armas, a bomb exploded outside a bank, causing damage but
 no injuries. Although no group has yet claimed credit for the attack, we believe a
 faction of ETA was responsible for the attack, which was probably associated with
 its attempts to extort "revolutionary taxes" from banks in the Basque country.
 31 December 1983       France: Retaliatory Bombings
 In Marseilles, a bomb exploded at the St. Charles train station, killing two persons.
 It was followed shortly by a second bomb explosion aboard a high-speed train en
 route from Marseilles to Paris. Three persons on the train were killed and nearly
 40 injured. Although eight groups so far have claimed credit for the attacks, police
 are most inclined to believe the claim of the Armed Arab Struggle, which also
 claimed credit for the bombing of the French Cultural Center in Tripoli, Lebanon,
 on 1 January. A communique from the group asserted that the attacks were in re-
 venge for French air raids on Baalbek, Lebanon, on 17 November (which, in turn,
 were in retaliation for the suicide truck bomb attack on the Beirut Headquarters of
 the French Multinational Force on 23 October which killed 58 French paratroop-
 ers.)
 1 January 1984        Lebanon: Bombing of French Cultural Center

 to the notorious international terrorist Carlos-claimed credit for a bomb which
 destroyed the French Cultural Center. No one was injured in the attack.
 Peru: Another Big Blackout
 Coordinated attacks by Sendero Luminoso terrorists at midnight left nearly 40

 attacks the most telling blow against the government since the attacks in the
 capital last summer.

 2 January 1984            Spain: Reemergence of GRAPO
 In Madrid, the leftwing urban guerrilla organization October First Anti-Fascist
 Resistance Group (GRAPO) claimed responsibility for the murder of two police-
 men. The killings were carried out to commemorate the death of GRAPO's leader,
 who was killed in a gun battle with police in Barcelona on 5 December 1982. De-
 spite numerous police claims that GRAPO has disbanded, the group reappears
 regularly to attack police targets.
