 TEN YEARS OF CHINESE COMMUNIST FOREIGN POLICY
 South and Southeast Asia
 Conclusions
 During the ten-year period which ended in the mid-
 1960's, Communist China's foreign policy in South and
 Southeast Asia had emphasized conventional diplomacy com-
 bined with assurances of friendship and non-aggressive
 intent.   This policy emphasis had been intended to induce
 the governments of the area either to adopt or to retain
 neutralist positions and to dissuade them from increasing
 U.S. influence in the countries.
 Beginning in 1966, Mao Tse-tung gradually shifted
 his foreign policy toward some countries in the area from
 diplomacy directed at neutralization to the open encourage-
 ment of rural-based insurrection.  The shift toward stimu-
 lation--and where feasible, support--of the several small
 insurgencies in Sc,;th and Southeast Asia has been accom-
 panied by a drastic deterioration in the diplomacy of as-
 surance.   Never before have the Chinese Communist leaders
 called for the overthrow of so many neighboring govern-
 ments, including several with which Peking maintains diplo-
 matic relations.   Peking is now openly encouraging "armed
 struggle" in Burma, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia,
 and the Philippines. Of the non-Communist nations on
 China's periphery, only Pakistan, Ceylon, and Afghanistan
 are not present targets of Mao's new insurrectionist line.
 Cambodia is in a special status between the two extremes,
 as a small anti-government insurgency is increasingly
 cutting across the thin fabric of Peking's diplomacy to-
 ward Sihanouk.*
 *Vietnam and Laos are excluded from this study because
 they are the primary responsibility of Hanoi and have long
 been obvious cases of an insurrectionist foreign policy.

 Despite the selective encouragement of insurgency,
 Peking has continued to be cautious and non-adventurous.
 With the exception of shallow probes on the border with
 India, the Chinese have avoided overt and offensive moves
 on the periphery of the mainland.  They have limited their
 own involvement in the developing insurgencies and have
 insisted that the guerrillas follow a policy of "self-
 reliance."
 The shift in foreign policy in the area apparently
 reflects Mao's revived desire to "push" revolutions.   Mao
 seems now to regret that he did not continue without in-
 terruption the advocacy and support of rural-based revolu-
 tion in "the East."  His original convictions were reflected
 in Liu Shao-chi's proclamation in November 1949 that Mao's
 road of guerrilla war was the model for Communist-led
 revolution in "colonial and semi-colonial countries" every-
 where.   In late 1951, he began to soften the revolution-
 ary-insurrectionist line and to shift i:o conventional
 diplomacy and the cultivation of neutralism; policy in
 the ensuing ten-year period was characterized as peace-
 ful coexistence embodying the "spirit of Bandung."  Since
 1966, however, policy toward certain countries has been
 moving back toward the earlier revolutionary line.
 In addition to his revolutionary compulsion, several
 basic factors appear to have impelled Mao to adopt this
 new line in foreign policy.   One is Mao's dispute with
 the Soviet leaders over his contention that rural insur-
 rection is the "only" road to power for Communists and
 leftists in underdeveloped countries.   Another is Mao's
 increasingly obsessive concern to sustain tension and to
 intensify "class warfare" in foreign policy as well as
 in internal affairs.   Another factor is Peking's increased
 support of Hanoi, and the desire to punish those govern-
 ments which aid the U.S. or refuse to adopt the Commun-
 ist position on the Vietnam war.   Still another factor
 --one which operated during a period of highly irrational
 behavior from January to early September 1967--seems to
 have evolved from Mao's desire to export his ego-cult.
 During that wild eight-month period, Chinese Communist
 diplomats abroad adopted extremely militant practices;
 in Peking, a number of foreign embassies were invaded

 and several offices were severely damaged.   In order to
 retain formal diplomatic relations with some countries
 and to prevent a large-scale exodus of foreign diplomatic
 missions from Peking, Mao apparently permitted Chou En-
 lai to preside over a retreat from the 1967 irrational-
 ities.
 This has been a partial retreat, however.   It, has
 not been accompanied by a corr3sponding retreat from the
 insurrectionist line imposed on certain unfriendly coun-
 tries.  On the contrary, that line has been sustained
 toward every country against which it had been declared.
 The return to an insurrectionist line is a new feature
 of Mao's foreign policy in South and Southeast Asia and
 will probably continue for sometime.
 Mao's second-in-command, Lin Piao, the capable guer-
 rilla warfare strategist who has "safeguarded" Mao's views
 against Chinese military professionals, probably will sus-
 tain Peking's new foreign policy line, and, if he succeeds
 Mao, continue that line.
 Although Peking's new insurrectionist line is cen-
 tered on nibbling tactics and takes a long view, overall
 Chinese policy in South and Southeast Asia during the
 next several years will probably be increasingly bellicose.
 Peking's effort to stimulate guerrilla warfare is
 concentrated on Burma and Thailand.   The threat in these
 countries is long-term, but nonetheless important.   In
 Burma, Mao and his lieutenants apparently intend gradu-
 ally to expand the small insurgent forces of the Kachin
 and Shan tribes along the China border, and to build up
 the small and weak political-military apparatus of the
 Burmese Communists (White Flags) in central-south Burma.
 At the same time, they will try to create from these
 elements and others an integrated insurgent movement led
 by the Communists.   Although some conditions in Burma
 are favorable for support of the insurgency, the develop-
 ment and maintenance of unified insurgent forces among
 disparate political and ethnic groups has always been a
 major problem.

 In Thailand, Peking is encouraging insurgent move-
 ments now in being in at least three areas, and this ef-
 fort seems to be parallel to one which Hanoi is implement-
 ing in that country.
 The rate of expansion of these small insurgent
 movements probably will be slow, but the Chinese have
 indicated that the "protracted" nature of the struggle
 is useful for the building of an effective party appara-
 tus and guerrilla force.  Mao seems to believe that in-
 surgent movements in the area will distract the U.S. and,
 as stated in a July 1967 Peking broadcast, provide a more
 favorable situation for the Vietnamese "people's war,"
 as well as demonstrate the correctness of his strategy
 of rural-based insurrection.   ,
 Introductio-.
 Communist China was successful in keeping on good
 terms with most neutral leaders in nearby countries after
 1954, reassuring them, especially the Indonesians and
 Burmese, that Peking would not use local assets for sub-
 version.   That general mollifying policy is now mainly
 discarded toward most neutrals in the area.   The record
 shows that, roughly speaking, diplomacy (and its restraints)
 were dominant in Peking's foreign policy from the mid-
 1950s to the mid-1960s.  During that period, Mao accepted
 the rational principle that, in order to prevent U.S.
 "encirclement" of the mainland, armed insurrection in the
 area must be subordinated to a policy of assurance-against-
 subversion.  That is, he had been convinced that, as an
 antidote to containment, diplomacy could be more useful
 than revolution.
 As a consequence, Peking adopted the kind of diplo-
 matically "correct" policies usually associated with Chou
 En-lai, observing the nationalistic sensitivities of
 neutral leaders and accepting the legitimacy of their
 governments, and encouraging neutralism wherever possible.
 However, Mao and Chou did not view the governments as
 one homogenous or undifferentiated group of neutrals,

 and Peking clearly indicated a preference for the policies
 of those countries which were vigorously involved in anti-
 Americanism--viz., Cambodia and Indonesia.
 Cambodia:  Although Chou had been tactful in moving
 Sihanouk away from the West by exploiting his fear and
 hatred of countries friendly to the U.S., such as Thailand
 and South Vietnam, he had in 1960 warned that Peking would
 make problems for Phnom Penh if Cambodia "permitted the
 entry of American troops" on its territory.   Increasingly
 thereafter, Sino-Cambodian relations centered on the basic
 matter of whether Sihanouk was to be given a clear state-
 ment of commitment by Peking rega:ding Chinese Communist
 military intervention to defend his regime from outside
 attack.  Chou's practice was to string him along with
 statements which implied such a commitment, but never
 explicitly declared it.   At no great cost beyond some
 political support and military aid,  the Chinese leaders
 induced Sihanouk to be their most faithful sycophant
 among non-Communist national leaders, and increasingly the
 Cambodian chief of state defended a whole range of Mao's
 policies, including vituperative anti-Americanism and
 vigorous support of the Communist position on the Vietnam
 war.  When, following his October 1965 talks with the
 Chinese leaders (who advised him to reject Soviet aid),
 Sihanouk acted independently to sign a military aid
 agreement with Moscow (18 March 1966), Peking became less
 effusive in praising him.   The Chinese leaders, however,
 continued to encourage his assertive anti-Americanism
 and retained that part of their policy which was intended
 to deter him from re-establishing diplomatic relations
 with Washington and reducing his hostility to Saigon and
 Bangkok.
 This rational policy was temporarily discarded
 during the aberrant period of Mao's proxy "revolutioniza-
 tion" of Foreign Ministry officials in the spring and
 summer of 1967.   In that wild period, Sihanouk's national-
 istic sensitivities were outraged by Chinese diplomats

 disseminating Mao's ego-cult in Cambodia and by Peking's
 interference with his action against a pro-Chinese friend-
 ship association.   When, in late October 1967, Chou was
 permitted to revive his policy of assurance-against-sub
 version, he attained a reciprocal pledge from Sihanouk
 regarding a toning down of anti-Peking criticism in Phnom
 Penh.   Chou may not be able to keep Mao convinced that,
 so long as Sihanouk is demonstrably anti-American and
 supports the Communist position on the Vietnam war, he
 should be kept in tow.   At present, a small anti-govern-
 ment insurgency in Cambodia is starting to cut directly
 across Peking's diplomacy and may eventually impell
 Sihanouk to withdraw his ambassador.
 Indonesia:   Clear signs in mid-1960 that Sukarno
 was prepared to work with the Indonesian Cummur.ist Party
 (PKI) under Nasakom (national-religious-Communist) unity,
 and that he could replace Nehru as Communist China's major
 political partner in the area, induced the Chinese lead-
 ers to cultivate his good will.   Mao and his wife person-
 ally participated in September 1962 in the effort to move
 Djakarta into Peking's camp regarding the Sino-Indian border
 dispute, and in January 1963, Foreign Minister Subandrio
 was urged by the Chinese leaders to accept their position
 in that dispute.   Sukarno's assertive anti-Americanism
 became a key unifying factor, and his "To hell with your
 [U.S.] aid" speech of 25 March 1964 induced the Chinese
 leaders to support his policy of "confrontation" with
 Malaysia and the UK.  The Chinese kept their military
 support at the no-risk level, promising some weapons and
 guerrilla-war instructors; they were more forthcoming
 They used this increased leverage on
 Sukarno i:, January 1965 to try to attain greater PKI
 representation in the Cabinet, their intention being to
 advance Aidit's strategy of working within Indonesia's
 "bourgeois-nationalist" government as well as outside it
 to help bring the PKI to power.
 Failure of the Sukarno-Aidit, coup (1 October.  1965)
 converted a major anti-American partner into a pro-West
 enemy at a time when Peking's diplomacy had suffered set-
 backs elsewhere.   In order to avoid a new setback and to

 retain an official presence in Djakarta, Peking did not
 immediately shift to a revolutionary-insurrectionist
 policy.  Because Mao had not yet called for a "revolution-
 ization" of the Foreign Ministry, Chou had some leeway
 to try to avoid a diplomatic break despite vigorous persecu-
 tion of Overseas Chinese.   After Mao called for "revolu-
 tionization" of Chinese embassy officers (9 September
 1966), Peking's exchange of vituperation with Djakarta
 escalated into serious diplomatic insults, including a
 calculated snub of Suharto by the Chinese military attache,
 who was expelled as a result (31 January 1967).  Diplomacy
 deteriorated rapidly during the fanatical period in the
 spring and summer of 1967; each nation invaded the embassy
 of the other on 5 August (the Chinese acted in retalia-
 tion), but by that time the Chinese already had shifted
 to Mao's revolutionary-insurrectionist policy and had
 appealed to Indonesians "to overthrow the reactionary
 regime" (PRC government statement of 26 April 1967) and
 "to overthrow the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime" (Red
 Flag editorial of 9 July 1967).   Concealing their own
 earlier encouragement of the PKI to work within Sukarno's
 government, the Chinese leaders began to insist that the
 PKI should have begun "armed struggle" in the Maoist pat-
 tern at an earlier stage of the revolution.
 Suspension of diplomatic relations by Djakarta ot1
 10 October 1967 has deprived Peking of an easy channel
 for supporting the PKI, but the new PKI politburo is now
 pledged to a Maoist program of long-term party building
 and,  later, guerrilla warfare.   Peking's open support for
 this program and its use of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia
 to disseminate anti-Djakarta propaganda, as well as the
 policy orientation of the Suharto    regime in Indonesia,
 reduce the prospect for re-establishing diplomatic rela-
 tions between Peking and Djakarta in the near future and
 isolates the Chinese leaders from a former major ally.
 Burma:   The Chinese leaders apparently believed
 that Chou En-lei's assurance-against-subversion made to
 Rangoon in June 1954 would induce Burma to keep the Ameri-
 can presence at a minimum and to avoid participation in
 any anti-Communist regional alliance.   Although the Chinese
 Communists had engaged in various forms of subversive

 they had limited the scope of covert operations suffi-

 a border dispute or again in November 1960 to support
 Burmese army action against Chinese Nationalist irregulars,
 revolution had been subordinated to diplomacy.   The Chi-
 nese Communists did not supplant Burmese authority or
 establ 'sh Communist rural bases in the border areas as
 they could have done.
 Mao's diplomacy became increasingly crude, however,
 following Peking's June 1964 decision to increase support
 for Hanoi.   Seeking to win acceptance of Peking's posi-
 tion on the Vietnam war, Ne Win was hectored and harassed
 by Chou and Chen Yi in July 1964, by Chou during three
 visits in April 1965, and by Chou again in Peking in July
 1965.   Ne Win resisted these pressures, which had the
 effect of disillusioning him with Peking.   He had not
 taken kindly to Chinese support for 20 White Flag Com-
 munists who had come from Peking in. October 1963 to
 negotiate--unsuccessfully--terms for an end to insurgency,
 and he was angered by subsequent revolutionary initiatives
 w'iich indicated more open Chinese support for the White
 Flags in Burma.   The list of initiatives includes:  Peking
 Radio's broadcast of a Communist Party of Burma (CPB)
 message (30 September 1964) implying the need for, a new    25X1
 government; Chen Yi's request in early December 1964 that
 Ne Win try again to include the White Flags in a  'united
 front" government;
 These moves provoked Ne Win.  He reacted with increasing
 irritability and with firmer anti Peking moves against
 signs of more aggressive Chinese Communist intentions.

 It was in this atmosphere of increasing Sino-
 Burmese tensions that "revolutionized" Chinese diplomats
 returned to Burma in January 1967 to disseminate the sym-
 bols of Mao's cult among Burmese and local Chinese.  This
 was the immediate cause of the open exchange of recrimina-
 tions between Rangoon and Peking.
 anti- 25X1
 Chinese sentiment culminated in the murder of a Chinese
 embassy technician by a Burmese demonstrator on 28 June.
 Peking's response was to subordinate diplomacy even more
 to revolution by depicting the government for the first
 time as "reactionary" (NCNA report of 28 June), praising
 "the revolutionary armed struggle led by the CPB"  (People's
 Daily editorial of 30 June), broadcasting the 28 June
 ZP demand for the "complete overthrow" of Ne Win (broad-
 cast of 1 July), and ordering its technicians to stop
 work (PRC government note of 5 July).  On 31 October,
 when Peking was impelled to withdraw all its aid person-
 nel from Burma, the Chinese warned that they would con-
 tinue to support "the Burmese people's revolutionary strug-
 gle;" however, this was merely a publicly stated euphemism
 for their earlier shift to Mao's revolutionary-insurrec-
 tionist policy, in the summer of 1967.

 Sino-Burmese relations have not been formally broken,
 but Ne Win may be impelled to do just that as the Chinese
 become more active in trying to make the border area in-
 surgency a major problem for his security forces.
 Nepal:  Nepal's leaders have been encouraged to
 remain neutral not only to prevent them from joining an
 anti-Communist regional alliance, but more importantly,
 to detach Nepal from India's dominant influence.   After
 Sino-Indian border clashes intensified, following the
 Tibet revolt in March 1959, the Chinese leaders decided
 to make their charges of Indian "expansionism" appear
 more credible by treating Nepal as a completely independ-
 ent country, in contrast to New Delhi's depreciatory
 paternalism.   The Chinese placed an ambassador in Kath-
 mandu for the first time in August 1960, split the dif-
 ference on ownership of Mount Everest by drawing the
 border-agreement line through its summit in October 1961,
 accused India of "great-nation chauvinism" toward Nepal
 in May 1962, gained the right to bring aid equipment into
 Nepal "from the north" in January 1963, and expanded their
 presence through additional aid agreements in September
 1965 and December 1966.   By May 1967,   they were effectively
 competing with India and had displaced part of the latter's
 dominant influence.
 But "revolutionized" Chinese officials, who had
 returned from re-indoctrination sessions in Peking, abused
 Nepalese nationalistic sensitivities by disseminating Mao
 badges and books along the Kathmandu-Kodari road and by
 claiming in an NCNA account of the road-opening ceremony
 on 26 May 1967 that "many" Nepalese  ;hooted that Mao is
 the sun shining in the hearts of al. peoples.  The "revolu-
 tionized" Chinese also used the new road to import from

 Tibet large shipments of propaganda materials through the
 Nepalese postal system. The Nepalese leaders were further
 angered by the undiplomatic demonstrations for Chinese
 diplomats, expelled from New Delhi, conducted at the
 Kathmandu airport by Chinese embassy officials in late
 June.   Anti.-Chinese students were aroused to a violent
 demonstration of their own against the Chinese for dis-
 playing only Mao's picture in Peking's stall during the
 annual celebration of the King's birthday on t July.
 on 8 July,       Peking publicly charged
 the Nepalese government, for the first time, with complicity
 because they believed that the Chinese lead-     25X1
 ers had been tactfully working to downplay the t July
 incidents.   In contrast to the unprovocative action of
 the Chinese ambassador, another fanatical accusation was
 broadcast by Peking Radio on 21 July, thundering a series
 of demands and insisting that Kathmandu "must promptly
 annul all measures discriminating against China and stop
 all anti-Chinese utterances and deeds on Nepalese terri-
 tory,."   (emphasis supplied)  This was the style of "red
 diplomatic fighters"  and not that of Chou En-lai, but
 Chou apparently had to swim with this current.

 Although tensions have subsided, the Nepalese lead-
 ers are more suspicious of the Chinese leaders than they
 have been in recent years. Kathmandu has established a
 committee in its Foreign Ministry to evaluate security
 reports on the activities of Chinese, as well as Soviet,
 officials in Nepal.   In order to prevent New Delhi from
 reasserting its influence more extensively, the Chinese
 will have to mollify Kathmandu in any future disputes
 provoked by Mao's "revolutionized" diplomats.
 Afghanistan:    Afghanistan's unobtrusive neutralism
 and inactive role in major international developments have
 kept it on the periphery of Peking's foreign policy efforts.
 Intensification of Peking's disputes with New Delhi and
 Moscow, however, impelled the Chinese leaders to try to
 enlist the Afghans in their camp.   A friendship and non-
 aggression treaty was signed in 1960,  a border agreement
 was added in November 1963, and economic aid and cultural
 exchange agreements followed in March 1965.  Despite
 Kabul's rebuff of the Chinese delegation's effort in April
 1966 to induce Afghan officials to condemn the U.S. policy
 in Vietnam, the unobtrusive Afghans have not stirred any
 deep resentments in Peking and relations seem to have
 been unaffected by Peking's general shift to the left in
 foreign policy.
 Ceylon:  The neutral policy of Ceylon kept rela-
 tions friendly until the Tibet revolt in 1959 and the
 Sino--Indian border dispute in 1962 combined to create
 some degree of antipathy when Colombo refused to take a
 strong pro-Peking stand.  Relations were exacerbated to
 an unprecedented degree during the fanatical period in
 the spring and summer of 1967.   After a Ceylon Communist
 party politburo member publicly touted Mao to Red Guards
 in Peking as "the greatest teacher, leader, and Marxist-
 Leninist alive" (speech of 26 May 1967) and after Mao
 rewarded this kind of sycophancy by having an "extremely
 cordial conversation" with !'im on 6 June, Ceylon's Foreign
 Minister protested to the Chinese charge (interview of
 11 August) about Peking's support for a man who advocated

 "overthrow" of the government.   The charge replied in
 the most revolutionary way he could--namely, by quoting
 from Mao's "thought".   He was ordered out of the Foreign
 Minister's office.
 But the immediate cause of open Sino-Ceylonese
 recriminations was the 15 August Peking protest over
 Colombo's seizure of goods and a parcel of Mao buttons
 addressed to the Chinese embassy.   By publicizing their
 protest, the "revolutionized" Chinese impelled the Cey-
 lonese, whi had preferred to keep the dispute in private
 channels, to release their reply to the press.   The Chi-
 nese escalated the dispute, organized a demonstration in
 front of Ceylon's embassy in Peking on 20 August
 Chou may have
 been permitted, at this point, to reduce the tensions,
 and although demonstrations were again staged in front of
 the embassy in early September, they were carefully con-
 trolled and of limited intensity and duration.
 The Chinese leaders now seem to be reluctant to
 warm Indian hearts by protracting the dispute with Colombo.
 But if a renewed effort to spread the Mao-cult should
 provoke Colombo into a new round of protests, the Chinese,
 operating under Mao's revolutionary policy, probably would
 respond with open vituperation.
 Pakistan:  The Chinese leaders view Pakistan as
 a counterweight to India in South Asia.   Since the estab-
 lishment of Sino-Pakistani relations in May 1951, they
 have avoided antagonizing Karachi on the Kashmir issue.
 Unlike the Soviets, who supported Indian claims, they
 refused to recognize New Delhi's sovereignty over the
 area.   In the process of trying to isolate New Delhi in-
 ternationally, the Chinese leaders increased ties with
 the Pakistanis, concluding a border agreement ?.n March
 1963, an airline agreement in August 1963, and apparently
 some arrangements for supplying military aid in February
 1964 during Chou En-lai's visit.   By that time, Ayub had
 become Mao's quasi-ally and was to receive important poli-
 tical support during the India-Pakistan war in September

 some form of action within a specified time limit in
 support of a non-Communist quasi-ally.   Their ultimatum
 of 16 September 1965 to New Delhi demanding that structures
 on the Sikkim-Tibet border must be dismantled within three
 days was intended to humiliate the Indians and to ease
 pressure on hard-hit Pakistani forces.   The unprecedented
 commitment was,  they apparently calculated, safe in mili-
 tary terms; they could control the extent and nature of
 any skirmishes with Indian border patrols, correctly di.s-
 counting the prospect of a major Indian attack.   Politi-
 cally, however, they had taken a major risk.
 They could not control Ayub's policy, and when he
 moved to end the fighting on 18 September, Mao's diplomats
 were out on a political limb and were impelled to explain
 why they had not acted on their ultimatum.   International
 opinion, which was extremely critical of Mao's war-like
 interference and favorable to Moscow's moderating effort,
 confronted Peking with a major foreign policy setback,
 This rash political commitment apparently reflected Mao's
 increasing reluctance, in recent years, to act on the
 basis of what his foreign policy experts--Chou, particu-
 larly--tell him about the probable detrimental consequ-
 ences of revolutionary moves.  In any case, the Chinese
 leaders tried to absorb the political defeat and to retain

 enemy in South Asia.

 mission leaving Tunisia turned over Peking's interests
 there to the Pakistani embassy.  The Chinese leaders are
 aware that Ayub will insist on sustaining high-level con-
 tacts with Soviet and American officials.   Despite signs
 of Sino-Pakistani frictions in 1967, Peking probably will
 continue to support Ayub and to avoid imposing a revolu-
 tionary-insurrectionist policy against his government
 so long as he remains an enemy of India and does not cri-

 India:   Once Communist China's major friend in the
 area, India is now a major enemy.   After the establish-
 ment of diplomatic relations in April 1950, Chou En-lai
 had been given considerable leeway to try to maintain
 friendly relations between Peking and New Delhi.   Imple-
 menting a policy of assurance-against-subversion, he set
 forth the five principles of peaceful coexistence with
 Nehru in April 1954 and even stated that Sino-Indian rela-
 tions were graced with a special personal relationship
 between himself and the Indian prime minister.
 India's transformation in 1959 from friend to enemy
 was a development which the Chinese leaders accepted with
 reluctance.  Because of India's importance in South Asia,
 Chou in April 1960 tried to induce Nehru to negotiate the
 border dispute.  But Nehru rebuffed him, and, as the In-
 dians began to occupy positions near and in some cases
 behind Chinese border posts (after the PLt1 had moved into
 Indian territory earlier in the western sector), the Sino-
 Indian border dispute gradually developed into a major
 clash.
 Shortly after their first attack on Indian posi-
 tions in October 1962, the Chinese appraised Nehru as a
 man who had put himself in the position of a lackey of
 the imperialists" (People's Daily article of 27 October
 1962).   Mao in September 196      fessed a desire to set-
 tle the border dispute by negotiations, but his policy
 toward New Delhi actually was to discard more and more
 openly any possibility of negotiated settlement.   As the
 Pakistan-India war developed, Chou tried to clear his own
 name by dissociating himself from the earlier policy, at-
 tacking "the Indian reactionaries' vaunted nonsense about
 their policy of nonalignment and peaceful coexistence"
 (speech of 9 September 1965).  A full scale clash was
 averted, but the Chinese made a series of temporary shal-
 low probes into Indian territory, partly to assert their
 own claims and partly to encourage the Pakistanis to sus-
 tain (or revive) their military confrontation with Indian
 forces.
 This active patrolling policy subsided in 1966 but
 was resumed in August 1967, following an intensification

 of Peking-New Delhi recriminations over Chinese open sup-
 port for a revolutionary-insurrectionist policy for In-
 dian Communists and after Indian diplomats had been beaten
 by Red Guards.    Firefights on 11 September and 1 October
 1967 apparently were military expressions of intensified
 political relations.
 Peking's support for the revolutionary-insurrection-
 ist road in India was declared openly in the spring of
 1967.    "Rebellion" is "the only way out" for the Indian
 people, according to the People's Daily of 19 May 1967.
 The tribal minorities in the northeast--i.e., the Nagas
 and Mizos--were praised for waging "armed struggle."
 The Chinese centered their attention on Communist insur-
 gents in India in late June 1967, praising the small group
 of extremists in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal
 as "the revolutionaries" of the Indian Communist Party,
 and oa 5 July, People's Daily made it clear that only the
 China model--viz., "Mao Tse-tung's road" of "using the
 countryside to encircle and finally capture the cities"--
 would be acceptable to Peking.   This political support
 for a ludicrously small group occurred in the context of
 Peking's criticism of both the right and the left wings
 of the CPI, indicating that the Chinese will insist on
 complete rather than partial support from any Indian Com-
 munists in the future.
 The Sino-Indian diplomatic dispute, which had in-
 tensified Peking's appeals for a revolutionary-insurrec-
 tionist policy, developed in early June 1967 at a time
 when Mao was permitting (if not encouraging) Red Guards
 to defy the practice of diplomatic immunity.  The beat-
 ings administered to the Indian embassy's second secretary
 when he was expelled on 14 June led to a retaliatory at-
 tack on the Chinese embassy in New Delhi on the 16th and
 a siege of the Indian embassy in Peking on the 17th, and
 there seemed to be little more that could be done to
 strain Sino-Indian relations further.

 The prospect seems to be for all-out political
 warfare despite the existence of diplomatic relations.
 Small and sporadic patrol clashes almost certainly will
 occur on the border.   Peking will continue to exaggerate
 the importance of any future Maoist-type uprisings, and
 probably will continue to provide some aid to the Nagas
 and Mizos.
 II.  The Non-Neutrals
 Regarding enemies such as Thailand, Malaysia,
 Singapore, and the Philippines, the Chinese leaders'
 shift to a revolutionary-insurrectionist policy required
 only a further subordination of diplomacy to revolution
 because government-to-government relations had not been
 established.
 Thailand:  Failure to move the Thais away from
 their close relationship with the U.S.  impelled the Chi-
 nese leaders to drop their relative restraint.   At some
 time between the central committee work conference of
 June 1964 and the U.S. airstrike against North Vietnam
 in August 1964, the Chinese leaders apparently decided
 to create trouble for Bangkok by organizing anti-govern-
 ment Thais into a united front of political and military
 opponents.
 The political prong of this dual effort was center-
 ed on establishing seemingly non-Communist fronts--viz.,
 the Independence Movement of Thailand and the Thai Patriotic
 Front--in November 1964 and January 1965, respectively.
 On 6 October 1965, Mao himself
 participated in the effort to exploit the former prime
 minister Pridi, who has been in exile in China for many
 years, but Pridi apparently refused to lend his name to
 either of the front groups.

 authorities from almost inaccessible bases in southern
 Thailand.   On 15 April 1965,  the CCP sent a message of
 greetings to the Communist Party of Malaya, pledging sup-
 port against the "Rahman clique," and on 12 January 1966,
 they publicized the establishment "in China" of a mis-
 sion of the CPM front organization, the Malayan National
 Liberation League, whose leader in Peking insisted that
 "People's revolutionary war is the only answer to counter-
 revolutionary war."  The leader of this Peking-based
 organization tied the small Malayan insurgency to Vietnam,
 declaring on 1 February 1966 that the anti-Malaysia
 campaign would be intensified "to coalesce with the anti-
 imperialist struggle in Vietnam and Southeast Asia."

 The prospect is for sustained Chinese encourage-
 ment of these Communist insurrectionists in southern
 Thailand (along the border with peninsular Malaysia) and
 of the ethnic Chinese guerrillas in Sarawak.   They will
 continue to depict the new state of Singapore as an addi-
 tional target for subversion and Prime   n ster Lee Kuan
 Yew as a "puppet" of the West who should be overthrown,
 but their first effort will be directed at penetrating
 political parties rather than inciting overt insurrection
 in the immediate future.
 The Philippines:  Peking's ten years of people's
 diplomacy toward the Philippines his failed to move Manila
 out of its close relationship with the U.S.   In early
 1966, when the Chinese began to revolutionize their policy
 coward Manila, their primary goal was to warn government
 leaders to avoid direct support of the American effort
 in Vietnam.   In mid-February 1966, Peking Radio's Philip-
 pines section sharply increased its broadcasts to the
 islands and in mid-March 1966, the Chinese called for a
 "struggle against American efforts to induce...the Philip-
 pines to send troops to South Vietnam."
 In contrast to the earlier policy of professing
 non-support for the Communists in the islands, Peking
 published the "Philippine Communist Party's" 1 May 1967
 program of armed struggle against the government.   How-
 ever, the Chinese seem to be exaggerating the size of the
 pro-Peking elements among the Philippine Communists, the
 degree of control which these elements have over the in-
 surgents, and the extent of the insurgency.   They claim
 that, as a general principl3, Communist-led revolution
 can succeed even in isolated islands.
 The prospect seems to be for the Chinese to try
 to establish a small group of Communists and leftists
 as a distinctly separate organization from pro-Soviet
 elements.  They will almost certainly continue to insist
 that rural insurrection is the only way to seize power
 in the islands.

 Hong Kong and Macao:   Although Mao in 1939 had com-
 plained about foreign control of Hong Kong and Macao, for
 many years thereafter he had been unwilling to use the
 PLA to seize the colonies or to begin a political-subver-
 sive struggle to impose local Communist control on their
 governments.   Khrushchev's derisive remarks about the
 colonies in December 1962 did not impel him to than a his
 olic  of avoidin  a confrontation,                                i
 Only after Mao's
 foreign policy was "revolutionized" in the wake of the
 purge on the mainland was he willing to change the line
 of caution and restraint.
 Local leftists in Macao influenced by the militant
 political atmosphere on the mainland, engaged in activity
 which led the Portuguese authorities to suppress them in
 November 1966.   The Chinese leaders exploited this incident
 (34 Chinese were injured) to attain an easy foreign policy
 victory, in which "revolutionaries" subjugated "imperial-
 ists," and by mid-December 1966 a combination of local
 demonstrations and threats from the mainland resulted in
 a protocol which formalized a significant loss of Porguguese
 authority in the colony.   In effect, the Chinese leaders
 are now the proxy rulers of Macao.
 The Chinese leaders and the Hong Kong leftists
 (mostly union leaders and students) were encouraged to
 act in a revolutionary way toward the British authorities.
 On 6 May 1967, colony riot-police clashed with local Chi-
 nese, who were demonstrating and shouting Maoist slogans
 outside a Kowloon factory.   Twenty-one workers were ar-
 rested.   This incident sparked a major confrontation be-
 tween Peking and London.   Unlike the Portuguese, the British
 courageously resisted the combined pressures of local
 leftists and Peking's threats--which included the burning
 of the British charge's office in the Peking embassy on
 22 August--and refused to accept various humiliating de-
 mands.  The Chinese leaders finally backed down, ordered
 their apparatus in Hong Kong to end the violent phase,
 and accepted a temporary defeat--that is,  they allowed
 the situation to subside into a: low-boil protracted poli-
 tical confrontation.
