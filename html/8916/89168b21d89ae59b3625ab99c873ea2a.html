 USSR:  Statements
 I      I Soviet President Brezhnev and KGB Chairman Andropov
 delivered tough statements on East-West relations in Moscow
 yesterday.
 In a conversation with Chief Justice Warren Burger
 on Friday, Brezhnev, reading from a prepared text, noted that
 bilateral relations have taken a definite turn for the worse
 in recent months.  He cited the development in the US of new
 military weapons, Washington's "very harmful" posture on the
 Vladivostok agreement, an apparent lack of desire to work out
 a SALT II solution, and continuing foreign trade discrimination.
 Brezhnev concluded by saying that his country is prepared to do
 what it can to overcome the present "recession" in relations,
 and welcomes certain recent statements by President Carter, but
 that Washington's words must be translated into practical deeds
 if a positive change is to come about.
 I     I Andropov, speaking to an audience that included Brezh-
 nev at a ceremony honoring the first Soviet secret police chief,
 reportedly stressed the critical role of the Western press, dip-
 lomats, and intelligence agencies in sustaining Soviet dissi-
 dents.                    In uncharacteristically harsh tones, he emphasized that
 detente is a complicated and uneven process and does not ex-
 clude the "ideological struggle." Andropov called on US and
 Western "ruling circles" to renounce alleged attempts to create
 a "hostile atmosphere."
 Andropov's demand that Soviet dissidents be fully
 punis e   according to law is a reminder of the still unresolved
 fate of such dissidents as Anatoly Shcharansky, who has been
 arrested and may be tried. Andropov's statements may also have
 been intended to stake out a firm Soviet position on the human
 rights issue before the opening of the European security review
 conference in Belgrade next month. The Soviets anticipate crit-
 icism and pr(~Qsiirc, for a liberalization of internal contacts at
 the meeting.
 NAMIBIA - SOUTH AFRICA:  Plans and Protests
 I               Justice Steyn,  the Administrator-General for Namibia
 appointed by South Africa,  has publicly offered to involve
 exiled leaders of the South-West Africa People's Organization
 Approved F+r Release 2007/03/06 : CIA-RDP79T00975A039300010052-7
 Approved For
 in preparations for elections to a constituent assembly in Na-
 mibia. Steyn plans to go ahead with the election preparations,
 however,     even if SWAPO decides not to participate.  Meanwhile,
 South Africa Prime Minister Vorster has reacted strongly to
 the decision by the UN Council for Namibia to seek Security
 Council action on South Africa's announcement that it was
 switching the administration of Walvis Bay to the Government
 of Cape Province.
 On his arrival in Windhoek on 1 September
 St
 ,
 eyn
 promised-to be "absolutely neutral" in his administration of
 the territory. He said his primary
 oal was t
 g
 :o ensure free and
 unimpeded elections in Namibia, and indicated that he was still
 hoping to meet the 1978 target date for Namibian independence.
 Steyn reportedly stressed, however, that if the UN decided not
 to send a representative to Namibia he would still go ahead
 with plans for the elections.
 In discussing plans for administering Namibia, Steyn
 said he would give serious consideration to repealing or amend-
 ing certain repressive or discriminatory laws. He also promised
 to travel widely throughout the territory to acquaint himself
 with the country and its "peoples."
 I    I Steyn has since offered safe conduct to SWAPO's
 exiled leaders who want to return to Namibia to discuss partic-
 ipation in the elections.  He has also proposed meeting them in
 a third country. According to press reports, SWAPO president
 Nujoma yesterday rejected the safe conduct offer, arguing that
 Steyn had no legal right to invite him to Namibia. Nujoma has
 repeatedly insisted that only the UN has legal authority in
 the territory.
 Earlier this week the UN Council for Namibi
 a said it
 would challenge South Africa's claim of sovereignty over Walvis
 Bay--the only deep-water harbor in Namibia.  The Council main-
 tains that Walvis Bay is an "integral part" of Namibia and in-
 tends to seek Security Council support for its position.  South
 Africa has administered Walvis Bay as part of Namibia since
 1922.
 1       -1 On Thursday, Prime Minister Vorster warned that
 there would be little sense in continuing talks with the West-
 ern five-power contact group on the future of Namibia if the

 Vorster may have believed reports that the Council for Namibia
 had acted with the knowledge and approval of the contact group.

 CUBA: Castro Continues Campaign
 speaking campaign in an attempt to boost public morale affected
 by continued economic problems and to win support for an expan-
 sion in Cuba's foreign assistance programs.//
 //Cuban President Castro has resumed his domestic
 //Castro has made nine speeches during the past
 seven weeks.  In nearly all of his addresses, Castro has given
 his audiences a detailed inventory of the projects constructed
 by the government in their region in recent years and compared
 present-day conditions with those of the Batista era.//
 //While acknowledging the country's limited finan-
 cial resources, Castro has emphasized that Cuba's foreign as-
 sistance programs are not taxing the Cuban economy and that
 the present austerity is due to low sugar prices rather than
 to Cuba's aid projects in the Third World. The Cuban leader has
 also noted that the more prosperous recipient nations are reim-
 bursing Cuba for its aid programs, and even the poorer countries
 are providing food and lodging for Cuban technicians.//
 I                  /Castro has used these speeches to announce an
 expansion in Cuba's foreign aid programs in the near future,
 underlining his determination to continue his active pursuit
 of influence in Africa and the Middle East.  In one speech,
 Castro stated that the number of civilian technicians in less-
 developed countries will increase from 4,100 to 6,000 by the
 end of this year;  in a subsequent speech he said that the gov-
 ernment plans to send approximately 1,000 teachers to Angola
 next spring.//
 //Castro's preoccupation with the financial costs
 of Cuba's overseas activities indicates his continuing aware-
 ness of public concern that these programs are at least partly
 responsible for recent austerity measures at home.  In fact,
 last year's reductions in certain ration allotments and major
 revisions of Cuba's first five-year plan are attributable al-
 most entirely to low world sugar prices.//

 //Given the relatively small numbers of personnel
 involved, t e existence of underemployment in. Cuba, and the
 underwriting of most of the actual costs by other nations, we
 believe that the economic burden of Cuban assistance programs--
 including the forecasted increases--imposes little real economic
 sacrifice on the Cuban populace.
 GUATEMALA-UK-BELIZE: Toward Negotiations
 //Guatemalan representatives go to London next
 week for preliminary talks with the British on the future of
 Belize.  The respective foreign ministers will continue the dis-
 cussions at the UN later this month.  These talks will be cru-
 cial in determining whether a settlement is possible before
 the Guatemalan elections in March 1978. Any agreement that is
 reached may have to be kept secret until after the elections
 to prevent it from becoming a campaign issue.  Each country has
 been urging the US to press the other for greater flexibility,
 but the British are hemmed in by what they can seZZ to the
 BeZizans, and the Guatemalans by what they can seZZ to their
 mi Zi tary. //
 Despite its usual public posture of intransigence,
 Guatemala may now show greater flexibility than in past nego-
 tiations because of its dwindling international support. A
 few Latin American countries continue to express solidarity
 with the Guatemalan claim--mostly as a matter of hemispheric
 unity--but world opinion overwhelmingly supports Belize's wish
 for early independence. The English-speaking colony has few
 cultural tries with Guatemala, which has never exercised ef-
 fective sovereignty over the territory. A resolution intro-
 duced in the UN General Assembly last year in support of
 Belizean self-determination was approved 115 to 8.
 Guatemala is anxious to retain its last solid bloc
 of support---its Central American neighbors--particularly since
 Panama announced support for Belizean self-determination in
 May. Guatemalan Foreign Minister, Molina toured the four neigh-
 boring countries early last month to apply a little judicious
 arm-twisting, not only for diplomatic support but for commit-
 ments to send military assistance if hostilities should erupt.

 Subsequently, the foreign ministers of Costa Rica, El Salvador,
 Honduras, and Nicaragua met in Guatemala in late August, where
 they drafted a joint communique giving their host qualified
 diplomatic support. El Salvador reportedly provided the only
 military support--a single truckload of 30-caliber arms and
 ammunition.
 //El Salvador probably hopes   to receive
 Guatemalan support in its eight-year-old dispute with Honduras,
 and  to ensure continued acceptance of Salvadoran migrant workers.
 Although South American support is of less impor-
 tance, Vice President Sandoval began a month-long fence-mending
 swing through most of the continent in late July.  Despite
 Sandoval's accounts of his success,  the trip accomplished
 little. Brazil refused to budge from its position of neutrality
 and will probably abstain if a resolution on Belize is again
 introduced at the UN General Assembly.
 The Chileans, caught in a tangle of conflicting
 aims--support for self-determination,  support for another
 Latin American country, and a wish to improve relations with
 Britain--stuck to their previous position of hoping for a
 "negotiated settlement," as did Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay,
 and Peru.     In several countries--notably Argentina, Paraguay,
 and Uruguay--Sandoval's bellicose attitude and his exaggerated
 claims of successes elsewhere greatly annoyed the host govern-
 ments.
 The best chance for settling Belize's future in the
 coming round of talks is some face-saving formula for terri-
 torial concession to Guatemala that would allow the Guatemalan
 military to accept the reality of world opinion and of its own
 lack of capability against British forces in Belize. The hard-
 line public statements of President Laugerud, however, are doing
 little to prepare the Guatemalan public for the eventual "loss"
 of that "province." The "Belize-is-ours" stand leaves no
 room for arriving at the negotiated settlement that most
 American states favor.

 EAST GERMANY - WEST GERMANY:  Soundings

 ing                        a   s between East and West Germany in preparation for
 another round of inner-German negotiations.  West German offi-
 cials have told US diplomats that the discussions, held on 2
 September, were constructive and "not unfriendly," but that
 they were     "a little sharper" than the first round in mid-August.
 I           I Neither side reportedly made any concessions on such
 tun amen al issues as Bonn's recognition of a separate East
 German nationality.  The East Germans refused to discuss human-
 itarian matters, such as family reunifications and the alleged
 increased harassment of visitors to East Germany. The East Ger-
 mans again refused to discuss Berlin matters with the West Ger-
 mans, saying they would deal only with the West Berlin govern-
 ment.

 I             The East German negotiator nevertheless made clear
 a    is government is interested in continuing the soundings,
 and in discussing bilateral transit and traffic problems soon.
 The West Germans noted that the coming conference on European
 security in Belgrade a Parently has motivated the East
 tinue the talks.
 USSR: Gas Pipeline Compressor
 I             JThe USSR is seeking Western assistance to construct
 gas pipe Zne compressor stations using advanced,  lightweight,
 jet  turbine engines developed for aircraft. Such engines pro-
 vide more power for Zess fuel and are easier to maintain than
 engines currently used in compressor stations,  but they are
 relatively untested in such industrial applications.  If the
 Soviets can successfully adapt these engines for future gas
 pipeline compressor stations,  it would significantly assist
 their efforts to increase natural gas production and distribu-
 tion.
 I       I The Soviets have received bids from a Canadian group
 o  ering the Rolls Royce RB-211 engine and from a US firm
 offering an engine developed for a wide-body jet.  Bids have
 also been solicited from firms in the UK, Japan, and Italy.
 These advanced,  lightweight engines have not been used exten-
 sively for industrial purposes but they offer almost double the
 power and a 15- to 20-percent reduction in fuel consumption at
 a cost of approximately 1.5 times that of first generation en-
 gines of similar size now being used.
 IIo The engines also allow simpler field repairs, which
 re uce    wntime, eliminate the need to purchase spare engines,
 and reduce capital and maintenance costs.  If these engines
 can be successfully adapted for use in natural gas compressor
 stations, the Soviets will be able to improve significantly the
 operating performance of their natural gas pipelines and in-
 crease the amount of gas that can be moved through them.
 A continuing shortage of high-capacity gas compressor
 systems has caused the Soviets to put pipelines into operation
 before adequate numbers of high-performance compressors were
 available.  This has led to severely restricted flow and to
 Approved
 25X1
 Approved For
 operating problems. The fact that the Soviets are again seeking
 to purchase Western gas compressor stations and supporting
 equipment indicates that they have not been able to solve
 this problem.
 Soviet efforts to use locally built aircraft engines
 in na ur   gas compressor stations have been unsuccessful. They
 have purchased and installed other Western compressor systems
 that use less advanced aircraft engines. Last December, for
 example, the Soviets purchased 42 compressor sets using Rolls
 Royce Avon engines originally developed for military aircraft.
 They will be installed along the 2,000-kilometer Tyumen-
 Chelyabinsk natural gas pipeline in western Siberia. These en-
 gines have been used on the Trans-Canada pipeline system since
 1964.
 I _J Although these Western compressor systems involve
 proven aircraft engines,  they have not fully met Soviet require-
 ments. The Soviets are therefore seeking relatively untested,
 advanced technology systems in order to speed up industrial use
 of the new,  lightweight aircraft engines.  If the advanced en-
 gines prove successful, the Soviets may either purchase more
 engines or try to obtain the technology to build their own high-
 performance engines.
 ITALY:  Solar Technology Exports
 I          IItaly has decided to develop small-scale solar energy
 sys ems suitable for new markets in the Middle East and Africa.
 It wants to improve its competitive position with respect to
 France in order to prevent the French from becoming the major
 supplier of solar energy systems  to developing countries.  To
 this end,  the Ministry of industry proposes to allocate some
 $13 million as an incentive for industry to develop solar tech-
 nology,  particularly small solar electric power plants suitable
 for small,  isolated communities.
 About $9.1 million of this amount will be used for
 low-interest loans to aid the production of industrial proto-
 types. The remainder will be used to reimburse citizens for up
 to 50 percent of the cost of installing residential solar heat-
 ing and cooling systems.

 :Cn addition,  the National Electricity Agency will
 spend $3.25 million in the next three years to produce solar

 small solar refrigerators.  The National Hydrocarbon Agency will
 spend slightly more over the same period to develop a solar re-
 search and development facility,  solar heating and cooling sys-
 tems, and small solar water pumps.
 Despite their excellent work in solar research
 the
 ,
 Italians have not been able to establish a sales capability.
 Unless they can devise better marketing skills, France will
 continue to dominate the market in the Middle East and Africa
 for small-scale solar systems such as water pumps. France will
 also be able to expand into large-scale applications, leaving
 Italy behind despite its present technical lead in developing
 large-scale systems.
 Research on large-scale solar electric power systems--
 100 kilowatts to 1 megawatt--has been done at the University of
 Genoa since: 1962. The university has been testing a 100-kilowatt
 working model of a solar boiler since 1967 but has been unable
 to buy a turbine to produce electricity from the steam generated
 in the solar boiler. The US Energy Research and Development Ad-
 ministration will purchase an Italian-built,  :300-kilowatt solar
 boiler that will be installed and tested by the Georgia Insti-
 tute of Technology.
 I    I The University of Genoa recently began a joint program
 with t e private Ansaldo Spa firm to develop a fully operational
 solar electric power plant. Ansaldo, in partnership with the
 West German Messerschmidt firm, now offers factory-guaranteed
 solar electric power plants with capacities of 100 kilowatts
 and 1 megawatt. The government will provide some financial as-
 sistance to the program.
 The Polytechnic Institute of Milan also is active in
 so ar energy research and development in cooperation with gov-
 ernment and industry.  The Institute has built a 3-kilowatt solar
 electric power plant that uses an organic working fluid with a
 relatively limited temperature range from 30 to 70 degrees C.
 It recently received a contract to develop a small solar elec-
 tric power :plant that can be mass-produced.

 China commemorated the first anniversary of the
 death o  Mao Tse-tung yesterday in low-key fashion. The rally
 in Peking was small by Chinese standards, and the short ad-
 dress by Party Chairman Hua Kuo-feng continued the trend of
 recent weeks of paying lip service to Mao without endorsing
 the unpopular domestic policies he espoused in the mid-1960s.
 in the Chinese equivalent of alphabetical order by Peking radio.
 So far Peking has not listed the new Politburo in order of rank.
 Hua repeated the standard foreign policy formula
 signs yang opposition to the USSR and interest in the US, but
 he did not mention either country by name.  Not all Politburo
 members attended the ceremony, but those present were listed

 I          ;] The Salvadoran legislature on Thursday unanimously
 ra i ie   the mediation agreement signed with Honduras almost
 a year ago. Honduras ratified it within a month after the
 signing and has been prodding El Salvador to do likewise so
 that negotiations for normalizing relations could be resumed.
 The two countries must now agree on a mediator whose recom-
 mendations are not binding.
 I            Relations were broken eight years ago when the two
 countries went to war over several issues particularly the
 treatment of Salvadoran nationals by Hondurans. A peace
 treaty will have to resolve this problem as well as provide
 for the demarcation of disputed portions of their common bor-
 der. A full settlement is unlikely any time soon.

 //Nepalese Prime Minister Tulsi Giri and his en-
 tire ca ine                     resigned yesterday. A liberal in domestic politics
 and generally pro-Indian in foreign policy, Giri may have found
 himself increasingly at odds with King Birendra, who dominates
 the Nepalese political scene. Giri had held the post since
 December 1975.//
 //A former prime minister, Kirti Nidhi Bista, may
 replace         Bista was considered anti-Indian and pro-Chinese
 in the 1960s, but more recently has appeared to moderate his
 position. In domestic politics, Bista has long been regarded
 as a hard-liner, consistently resisting attempts at liberali-
 zation. F77                    I
