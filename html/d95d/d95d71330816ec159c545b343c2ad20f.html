 The subcommittee is pleased to be able to publish this original
 paper by Professor Robert F. Byrnes in the record of its inquiry on
 international negotiation.
 We invited Professor Byrnes to prepare a memorandum covering
 the main issues in negotiating exchanges of scholars with the Soviet
 Union which he thought should be considered and reflected upon, and
 he has responded with this discerning contribution to our record.
 Now Distinguished Professor of History at Indiana University,
 Dr. Byrnes was from 1959 to 1962 Director of the University's
 Russian and East European Institute. For nine years, from 1960
 to 1969, he served as Cha.irntan of the Inter-University Committee
 which, until this past summer, had the major responsibility for U.S.
 scholar exchange programs with the Soviet Union.

 EXCHANGES OF SCHOLARS WITH THE SOVIET UNION:
 ADVANTAGES AND DILEMMAS
 By
 Robert F. Byrnes
 During the last quarter century, the role of the American univer-
 sity and of the American schotar_ hn c quietly and gradually changed
 almost beyond the comprehension of even those who have partici-
 pated actively in the revolution. Expansion of higher education and
 of access to it in every part of the country has brought more than
 seven million students to AmericEm c-lJnpuses in the fall of 1969.
 These students, their faculties, the libraries which serve them both,
 and the entire college and university complex all face a continuing
 "knowledge explosion," an increase of information in most fields of
 study so rapid that most of what is noea taught in some fields was not
 known as recently as ten years ago.
 The role of the university in American life has so changed that the
 ivory tower has been demolished. M any Americans instead believe
 that the university, while con.tiwal.g its usual functions for the
 rapidly growing student body, should also be the principal instrument
 for resolving our social problems. Indeed, many are now convinced
 that new knowledge generated and spread by the university is the most
 important factor in social and ecorn,anuc change.
 The appearance of new fields of shad , of new knowledge, especially
 in the sciences, and of new respo1isibilities is matched by growing
 interest in the rest of the World, e-specially the so-called non-Western
 areas, which were neglected before the Second World War. The tech-
 nical revolutions in communication and in transportation, the growing
 appreciation by Americans of the position their country occupies in.
 international affairs, and the general shrinking of the world have all
 contributed to an increase of research and instruction in areas as
 different as the Soviet Union and Africa. This revolution in our view
 of the rest of the World has been especially reflected in the increased
 emphasis devoted by the American educational system to the Soviet
 Union, largely because of the growth and outward thrust of Soviet
 power. As a consequence, thousands of Americans have learned Rus-
 sian, have become interested in Russian history, literature and govern-
 ment, and have sought to analyze -fviet power and policy. Inevitably,
 just as American libraries have increased their resources to enable all
 to study the newly-discovered universe, so American universities have
 attempted to enable those intere, 1.ed in the Soviet Union to study
 there. This effort to encourage study within the Soviet Union has

 directly involved American universities and scholars in official ex-
 change programs with the Soviet government and has therefore
 created both problems and dilemmas.
 l`articipatiou by American universities in formal exchange pro-
 rmrarns with a country as ideologically and politically different from
 otus as the Soviet Union is only one of the Ways through which they
 IIave developed close relationships with agencies of our own govern-
 sent and with other governments as well. This position of the uni-
 vrt:sitirs is, of course, not new, because the state universities in par-
 ticular. and American colleges and universities in general, have never
 -wparateel themselves from the concerns of the people and their gov-
 criuuent at the local, state, and national level. However, the ties with
 our national government in particular have changed since the Second
 World War to such a degree that a quiet revolution has taken place,
 and few American universities dealt with even friendly foreign gov-
 erunients before the Second World War. In recent years, most Amer-
 ican uutivorsities have done extensive work overseas through organi-
 zations such as AID, largely to help universities and other educational
 organizations in underdeveloped countries. They have also helped to
 train young men and women for work in organizations such as the
 Peace Corps, and many of our large universities have as many as a
 thousand foreign students on campus, many on grants from their
 governments or from the American govertunent. Scientists oil cam-
 piises throughout the United States have undertaken research projects
 for agencies such as the Atomic Energy Commission, NASA, tai the
 National Institutes of Health. Many institutions maintain study
 centers or student centers abroad, and Horny have direct exchange
 relationships with colleges-and universities in other parts of the world.
 In short. the role of the American university within our society and
 the relationships the university has with other pare of the world have
 both changed rapidly. The participation of American universities and
 their scholars in academic exchanges with countries like the Soviet
 t'nion fits into this framework, one in which the university serves its
 own purposes and at the- same time participates in international ac-
 tivities which directly involve the national interest. The university's
 role in cultural exchanges with countries like the Soviet Union is
 simply more complicated and more difficult thtun the other kinds of
 Work for or with governments in Which many educational institutions
 are now engaged.
 The phrase "cultural exchanges" is difficult- to define. It means "an
 exchange of accumulated knowledge and methods which forms the
 present outlook of mankind nand reflects best on the problems of the
 past. the present, and the future." Ordinarily, of course, scholars and
 'indent, travel freely without any concept or framework of reciprocal
 !_riving and receiving, with an American scholar going to an institution
 in France about as easily as he would to one in this country, and with a
 French scholar coming to the United States or going to Japan with no
 special formalities or difficulties and with neither government- involved
 or even informed.
 Research for foreigners in the Soviet Union, however, is quite a
 different matter, because opportunities for Americans to study there,
 or for Soviet scholars to continue their work in the United States are
 possible, at Soviet insistence, only as print of an official cultural ex-

 change agreement negotiated between the two governments. Under
 this agreement, specified numbers of artists, dancers, bands, athletes,
 delegations of specified types, movies, special publications (such as
 Amerika), and exhibitions are exchanged between the two countries,
 who also agree on specific forms of scientific cooperation and on partic-
 ipation in congresses held in the two countries. The number of men
 and women involved in these exchanges is small, only a few hundred
 each way each year, and the number of dollars or rubles involved also
 is not large. (In fact, the total cost [including actual cost of instruction
 for Soviet graduate students and scholars in American universities]
 of all the academic exchange programs with the Soviet Union since
 1958 probably does not exceed $20,000,000.) However, the importance
 of these developments for the scholars and the universities, and for
 the national interest, far outweighs their apparent significance in
 numbers and in funds.
 The fall of 1969 provides an especially appropriate time to review
 exchanges of scholars with the Soviet Union because American uni-
 versities have just completed their first decade of such exchanges and
 because ominous repression in the Soviet Union and the uneasy situa-
 tion in Czechoslovakia and in Eastern Europe may raise questions
 in the near future about whether and how these relations can be
 continued.
 Moreover, in the summer of 1969, the Inter-University Committee,
 a private organization founded by seven universities in 1956 which
 grew to fifty-five institutions in 1969, presented its responsibilities for
 exchanges with the Soviet Union and some of the countries in Eastern
 Europe to a new organization, the International Research and
 Exchanges Board, which also assumed authority for the Ford Founda-
 tion programs in Eastern Euro pe and for the small American Council
 of Learned Societies senior scholar exchange programs. The experience
 of the Inter-University Committee provides a fine opportunity for
 review, since the Committee was the earliest, the largest, and most
 important private organization involved in academic exchanges with
 any Communist country. Financed originally by the Carnegie Corpo-
 ration and then supported in approximately equal parts by the Ford
 Foundation, the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the
 Department of State, and the participating universities themselves,
 the Committee has helped to bring about an extraordinary improve-
 ment and expansion in American research and instruction concerning
 the Soviet Union, which was precisely its goal. Moreover, the experi-
 ences which the Committee enjoyed were not notably different from
 those of other private organizations, such as the American Friends
 Service Committee, semi-public organizations, such as the National
 Academy of Sciences, or government agencies, such as the Public
 Health Service and the Atomic Energy Commission.
 The year 1969 is an a pro priate time for a review also because we
 have apparently reached a plateau in our exchanges with the Soviet
 Union and some of the countries of Communist Europe, after a peak of
 interest in 1963 and 1964. In fact, the invasion of Czechoslovakia in
 August 1968, which crushed high hopes for expanding exchanges with
 that country and with some of the other countries of Eastern Europe,
 may instead mark a sharp demarcation of possibilities for peaceful
 exchanges of all kinds with the Soviet Union and its associated states.

 At the same time, while no one can estimate the time or the cir-
 cumstances, we will certainly one day establish exchanges of scholars
 With Mainland China. Official Chinese suspicion and hostility towards
 the United States are similar to those in the Soviet Union, so the cir-
 rurnstanc:es under which any exchange program will be established
 and conducted will probably resemble those which have prevailed in
 the last few years. However, Chinese history and tradition, and Chinese
 interests, are somewhat different from those of the Soviet Union, and
 Attericatt attitudes are even more confused, so some differences in the
 attitudes and arrangements on both sides will surely appear. In any
 case, those in the universities and in government who will be respon-
 sible for cultural exchanges with Mainland China can clearly benefit
 substantially from analysis of the principles and problems involved in
 our exchanges with the Soviet Union.
 Finally, our review of exchanges of scholars with the Soviet Union
 should illuminate the relationships between the two countries during
 n 'cry critical and dangerous period because the exchange is both a
 model and as symbol of the difficulties we have in dealing with each
 tither. it helps to explain some of the criticism from the New Left of
 the universities for their relaationship, or even partnership, with the
 ,,overnnaent, in Washington. It also helps illuminate the curiou, drift
 towards isolationism which has been at prominent feature of the last
 few years of our political life, its the American people have shown
 increasing resentment over the war in Viet \anm and increasing
 weariness over the lone burden of high taaxation, as-istancc 'o foreign
 ctiuntrie:s. and constant international tension.
 holars and Their Universities
 _ nierican universities and their scholars would naturally prefer
 that those interested in continuing their study in the Soviet Union be
 :as free to travel there as they are to France or Mexico, just as they
 '.could prefer that Soviet scholars be able freely to come to this country.
 In fact. during the 1930's, a small number of men, including John
 Curtiss. John Hazard, Calvin Hoover, Philip'Mosely, G. T. Robinson,
 :anti Ernest J. Simmons. were able to study in this way in the Soviet
 t`nion. Indeed. the inability of our scholars to continue their work in
 the Soviet. Union as they did thirty years ago under Stalin is one
 evidence of an increase in restrictions, and in isolation, introduced
 there since even the grim 1030's. Because of Soviet insistence, the
 only 'Way in width Soviet and American scholars can study in the
 ether country is tinder a formal exchange agreement, the first of which
 was signed oft January 27. 195S, and others of which have been si ned
 in saaceeeding years after increasingly prolonged negotiation-. Cot1-
 settuently. while these agreements cba provide some protection or
 security for Americans studying in the, Soviet Union, they are directly
 responsible for bringing Atuerican universities into close relations with
 their own government and with the Soviet government its well.
 Our academic institutions and their scholars have agreed to par-
 ticipate in the exchange agreement. because of the significant ad-
 vantages they offer, the primary one, of course, the opportunity for

 American scholars to increase their knowledge and understanding
 of Russia. In 1956, the United States had less than ten scholars who
 had spent an appreciable period of time in the Soviet Union. In
 1969, while many scholars whose professional interest is the Soviet
 Union have not visited that country, approximately a thousand
 have spent from a month to two years studying in the country in
 which they are professionally interested. We have not yet produced
 a de Toequeville, but our research and instruction have improved
 considerably because of the opportunities our scholars have had to
 work in Soviet libraries, to become acquainted with Soviet students
 and scholars, and to get some taste of the spirit and quality of Soviet
 society. In fact, the exchange program is now far less important
 to the American academic community than it was in 1958, a fact
 which should be made clear to the Soviet authorities.
 This improved understanding of the Soviet Union has been spread
 throughout American society through teaching and publications,
 which have contributed an increasingly realistic appraisal of Soviet life
 and Soviet policy, one quite remote. from that produced by the glories
 of Russian literature of the nineteenth century or by the extraordinary
 heroism of the Soviet soldier and Soviet citizen during the Second
 World War. Those who have studied in Itussia have a confidence about
 their work from having seen and felt the element about which they
 teach. In the universities in particular, they have also participated in
 educating many of those who constitute the core of our specialists on
 the Soviet Union in the various branches of our government. When one
 considers that the military intelligence staff concerned with Russia in
 the summer of 1939 consisted of a colonel and a sergeant, neither of
 whom knew Russian and both of whom relied substantially upon the
 American press for information, one can appreciate the progress made.
 A subsidiary benefit has been an increased understanding of Ameri-
 can history, tradition, values, and shortcomings. This improved
 understanding of other cultures and of ourselves has helped American
 universities to contribute more effectively to help educate minorities
 who in the past have been denied equal opportunities. In sum, the
 exchange programs have helped us to provide a new definition of a
 liberal education and to widen educational opportunities here at home.
 In an age afflicted by nationalism and by the dreadful. consequences
 of a series of destructive wars, the exchange programs have also
 helped American scholars to recognize the special obligations our
 blessings have bestowed upon therm as citizens of the world and as
 responsible members of a universal scholarly community. We are, in
 short, beginning to see the universe as a whole, as did the middle ages,
 when the foundations of the modern university were being laid and
 when the traveling scholar was even more common than today. The
 medieval scholar recognized and acted upon the conviction that all
 share the same interests and have an obligation to work together.
 Today, we have learned again that we have a special obligation to
 assist scholars in other countries u-ho are living and working in less
 comfortable and free circumstance:, than we, a most important truth
 which the circumstances of our age could. easily smother. In fact, the
 growing sense of responsibility among many of our scholars and the
 treatment which American universities have provided Soviet scholars
 in this country have constituted one of our glories.

 Study in the Soviet Union has contributed in still other ways to
 changing American education. For example, the enthusiasm of our
 returning scholars, those in fields such as history as well as those who
 specialize in language teaching, for improving and expanding instruc-
 tion in Russian has been one of the important factors in the foreign
 language revolution which has swept the colleges and even the high
 schools of the United States in the last, fifteen years. Similarly, study
 of a society quite different in every way from ours has contributed to
 the expansion of area programs designed to encourage the student
 to study every aspect of a society, rather than just the history or the
 literature. This development has been one of the most important
 forces weakening the departmental boundaries which have tradi-
 tionally separated scholars in universities. It has therefore contributed
 to a new, more wholesome approach towards the nature of knowledge
 and the field of study. In short, the openness, the excitement, and the
 quality of those involved in Russian studies have helped to change the
 nature and character of the university and to increase its involvement
 in world affairs.
 At the same time, the organizational arrangements which American
 universities made to help resolve the problems which the exchange
 programs created have helped improve relationships among scholars
 and among universities. In short, bringing a dumber of universities
 together in a delicate and difficult task, with the institutions assigning
 administrative responsibility to one university and with the various
 tasks assumed by committees of scholars from many universities in
 different parts of the country, has helped to create new patterns of
 cooperation among American institutions of higher education. This
 has aided in breaking down the barrier which have separated Amer-
 ican universities from one another and which had Client so conscious
 of their sovereignty that. they were self-isolated in ivory towers in an
 Anglo-Saxon world. Since the educational revolution has placed heavy
 strains upon even our resources and since American universities must
 learn to cooperate more, both within the United States and abroad,
 the experiences of this exchange program have been of considerable
 significance, affecting the development of joint programs towards
 improving libraries, administering overseas centers, and selecting and
 educating scholars and students from foreign countries.
 American scholars who have, participated in the exchange program
 have also increased their understanding of the Soviet sy.Lem and of
 Soviet, foreign policy, whether their main concern has been linguistics
 or history or government. A happy consequence of this knowledge
 and understanding of Soviet totalitarianism is the growing apprecia-
 tioti among specialists of the problems which the Department of State
 faces in dealing with the Soviet Union. This may in fact be one of
 the most important national benefits from the exchange program,
 because it has reduced the likelihood that unknowwing scholars, oper-
 ating only oil what they read and ty=pical of American "transc.endell tal
 populism" and of American suspicion of our own government, would
 heavily criticize officials engaged in negotiations with the Soviet
 gove itcnent in circumstances which scholars who had not left the
 library or the "Intourist world" could not understand.

 The National Interest
 From the point of view of the American government and of the
 American public, perhaps the greatest contribution of the academic
 exchange programs has been their success in maintaining a tie with a
 group of important Soviet citizens at a time of high tension and
 great hazard. In fact, the great paradox of the exchange programs
 has been that the universities and the scholars, by seeking primarily
 to advance knowledge and their own special interests, have in fact
 served the national interest supremely well by the effectiveness with
 which they have maintained this narrow bridge between the two
 countries. This opportunity for dialogue reinforces the tendency
 within the higher levels of the Soviet government towards peaceful
 relations with the United States and provides whatever influence we
 have "towards rationality, permissiveness,  and openness." One
 should not overestimate the impact of programs such as this, but
 they do constitute a positive addition to the containment policy.
 They do to some degree soften the Soviet Union by opening a window
 in that closed society to the rest of the world. They do persuade the
 Soviet government to engage in relationships with the United States
 on peaceful grounds under conditions which are of mutual advantage,
 a practice which is regularly condemned in the Soviet Union as
 "ideological coexistence."
 The academic exchange programs also contribute to the national
 interest by increasing Soviet understanding of the United States. The
 handful of Americans who live in Soviet dormitories and who come
 to know well Soviet scholars and Soviet students, the future elite
 of their society, inevitably provide them some understanding of the
 quality and of the friendliness of our society. Similarly, those Soviet
 scholars who work in the United States must acquire an increased
 understanding of the nature of cur society and must have the Marxist-
 Leninist glasses with which they view the rest of the world to some
 degree cleaned. In fact, in 1964, seven Soviet alumni of the program
 who had each spent an academic year in an American university were
 serving their government in the United States, in their embassies in
 Washington or at the United Nations or in organizations such as
 TASS. This will in the long run contribute to reducing misunderstand-
 ing and fears on both sides and will help the Soviet elite to see more
 clearly the wider one world in which we all live. In fact, as Mr.
 Toynbee long ago recognized, the Soviet Union may now be learning
 that it is impossible to borrow Western efficiency without borrowing
 Western values, that it is impossible to import only a part of the West.
 Finally, the exchange program provides a, kind of index or barometer
 of the atmosphere in which Soviet decisions are made. Identifying or
 defining Soviet policies and the considerations underlying these posi-
 tions is a difficult task complicated by lack of information and the
 problems we face in penetrating the Soviet mind. The exchange
 program, one of the few direct, constant, measurable ties we have with
 the Soviet government, therefore serves as an effective touchstone of
 larger Soviet policies. Thus, recent, increased harassment of American
 scholars by the Soviet KGB reveals a change in the temperature or
 atmosphere within which all Soviet policies are decided. Moreover,

 the established history and the symbolic importance , of the exchanges
 are such t.lint it Soviet decision to reduce them sharply or end them
 would constitute it most. important signal about basic Soviet goads and
 policies.
 Tarr;  PROBLEMS, AND DILEMMAS
 Like any complicated new program, the aacademic exchange is an
 expensive one in the time and intellectual energy of scholars and
 udaninistaatoas it consumes. Soviet nclminisiraative rigidity and
 etficienr v are so vast, and Soviet ability to create and to magnify
 problems so great I lint the exchange programs probably devour more
 administrative tittae and energy per individual involved than any
 other academic enterprise in which an American university has ever
 ennnged. Oniv intense interest and resolute good will have triumphed
 over these Soviet quaalit.ies, which are apparently eternal and which
 deserve ai new Gogol.
 Great universities have been especially hampered because they are
 not properly organized to identify their own interests in such it pro-
 grain or to work effectively with other universities in ra national
 organization. Thus, it is ease to identify the specialists in Russian
 history or literature or government who should be encouraged to
 study in the Soviet Union, but few universities have recognized the
 other fields of study which would offer benefits for Americans.
 However, the unitiersity's principal problem has clearly been its
 transformation into an art ion :agency. and the main dilemma is it simple
 one. Should the university accept: it share of responsibility for
 t'xchaumge, of scholars with (orimiuuist countries taaad in so doing deft-nd
 it, integrity as a free institution, while art- the same time developing
 elose relations with agencies of our own government and of the foreign
 2ovt'rnrnent. and exposing itself to domestic and foreign criticism and
 to the whim, of international politics". Or should it instead allow our
 tttveranuent  to conduct the programs, with the great likelihood that
 inroads npou the aurivet`sity's integrity % ould occur? Or should the
 uuit-vi:sity declare that the problems are so complicated and so alien
 to its experience that it should not participate in a any way?
 ']'he university's decision to accept responsibility has helped break
 down and destroy the ivory tower and bring it into the middle of
 public life, and even into international politics, positions which the
 university and scholar have not sought and which it is hazardous for
 thorn to share. Work for the Peace Corps, for AID, and for other
 government agencies, and especially programs involving foreign
 ?rovernmeaats, has drastically changed the nature and character of
 the relationship between the university mad the government. Thus
 far, the principles and procedures established have recognized the
 ,pecial role free universities must a1 vmi.ys play, and the main hazards
 have been avoided. Moreover. everyone agrees, first, that the nrai-
 a ea,ity today cannot be removed front the society in which it functions
 vivid which it, serves, and, second. that the university in a free country
 roust remain true to its primary educational goats if it is to serve
 ociety effectively and remain truly independent.
 In the exchange programs, for example, even though the university
 often plays an important political role in at front- line capacity, it. must
 at a II tunes remain a privileged sanctuary of freedom. Our educational

 institutions are free and independent, suspicious of government, and
 accustomed to their own ways in their assigned areas of responsibility.
 They must remain sovereign, conduct their work of research and in-
 struction as they see best, and have a large share in the direction of
 cultural relations, in which they have always had an abiding interest.
 In brief, "political warfare" use of the universities and of the arts
 is useless and in the long run destructive, even though universities,
 artists, and scientists operating independently, doing their own work
 in their own best way, do have a very powerful impact.
 Relations between the Department of State and the universities
 have been remarkably effective and amicable because the men and
 women involved have so well understood the others' purposes, quali-
 ties, and problems. However, tension between American universities
 and the Department of State over exchange programs is natural,
 because the State Department has the primary responsibility for
 critical, delicate, and highly involved relations with the Soviet Union,
 which cannot be separated from relations with our allies and with other
 countries in the world. Moreover, while the universities are interested
 basically in only a small part of the cultural affairs agreement with the
 Soviet Union, the Department of State has responsibility for the
 entire agreement, which it naturally sees as a whole and which it
 wishes to administer in a, coherent and coordinated way, keeping in
 mind our total foreign policy towards the Soviet Union and with other
 countries as well.
 The particular issues of disagreement are obvious and will continue.
 Thus, the Department controls admission to the United States and
 has on occasion denied visas to Soviet scholars nominated in fields
 which have military significance, such as microelectronics or new types
 of computers, or in subjects in which the Soviet Union has refused to
 accept American scholars. In addition, in retaliation for travel restric
 tions imposed on all Americans in the Soviet Union, Soviet participants
 in the United States must inform the Department of State of intended
 travel four days before they can leave their home campus. In cases
 such as this, American scholars who are not informed concerning
 Soviet policies or concerning the larger framework in which the
 academic exchange resides, or who have a special personal interest in
 one person or one aspect of the program, frequently denounce the
 Department for policies Which seem to them petty or senseless.
 The Department of State is also vulnerable to domestic political
 pressures and critics, some of whom denounce the Department because
 "the Soviets send scientists to work on important problems in
 American laboratories while we send scholars to work in ancient
 Russian history in Soviet libraries." Some Americans and their
 representatives believe that the programs should be curtailed or
 abolished because they are convinced that the Soviet Union obtains a
 significantly greater advantage from them than we do. Others on
 occasion believe we can and sh.orrld. send ten thousand each year,
 bringing the walls of Moscow down by turning pages. The State
 Department, in short, is constantly vulnerable to critics and serves as a
 perpetual target for all Americans, some of whom have some influence
 on the annual appropriations for the Department and therefore for
 exchange programs. These pressures often cause disagreements be-
 tween the Department and the universities, which resent any apparent

 Departmental Weakening before popular pressures and who resist
 suggestions from the Department Which would help .satisfy the most
 responsible of the public criticisms.
 t'nfortunately, Lite Departn-cnt of State is not the only American
 government agency with which universities engaged in academic ex-
 change programs have to deal. Some of these government institutions,
 such as the National Academy of Sciences and the Atomic Energy
 t'oIrImission, have exchange programs of their otivn, which tire financed
 by Lite government but which rely on American universities to provide
 most. of the American participants and the laboratories and libraries
 in Wlricla Soviet participants continue their studies. The AEC and the
 NAS tend to be quite independent because they are within the govern-
 ment, and because their programs involve scientists, iii whom the
 Soviet. Union is particularly interested and for whom, therefore, it
 vrecates more comfortable arrangements and fewer problems than it
 does for scholars in the ordinary academic exchange program.
 however, thes!n   a,i In I I1i        Agency and the Federal Bureau
 of Investigation have raised greater pro ems for the American uni-
 veisities and their constituents, who tend to be critical of much of
 the government but especially critical of these two organizations.
 I'fac~,`j11 and the FBI, which have important national responsibilities,
 are interested in information concerning Soviet strengths and weak-
 nesses, policies and practices. On the Soviet side, officials of the KGB
 almost, inevitably evaluate all academic exchange programs with the
 Soviet Union in this context and, above all, in the perspective of their
 eternal suspicions and of their own extensive efforts. In fact, the
 universities' emphasis upon selecting young men and women of high
 intellectual quality with good coiUimand of Itussian, considerable
 knowledge of the Soviet Union, and great interest in learning about
 Soviet society has no doubt increased Soviet suspicion.
 The American scholarly organizations engaged in exchanges with
 the Soviet Union have done their utmost to insure that, their programs
 provide no grounds for suspicion, but they are essentially powerless to
 affect Lite Soviet attitude. These organizations, such as the Inter-
 I Iniversit:y Committee and the International Research and Exchanges
 Board, are interested exclusively in scholarly activities. They have no
 ties With the Centro'] Tnt.pflit1PnceAgeney or any other intelligence
 organization. They receive no funds from any intelligence organization,
 and they provide them no information. The Jitter-University Commit-
 tee in addition warned every candidate for study in the Soviet Union
 not only to reject any approaches that might be made by intelligence
 or other government agencies, but to report any, such incidents should
 they occur. Finally, every participant. in the Committee's exchange
 program signed a pledge that he would undertake no activity other
 than the scraolau?Iv ones for which he was selected.
 Even so, the existence and the activities of these government
 ag=encies have created difficulties for the American universities in their
 dealings with Lite ever-suspicious Soviet government. They have also
 created problems within tae American academic community, in spite
 of the efforts of the academic organizations and in spite of the genuine
 care, discretion, and propriety with which these organizations have
 carried out their activities.
 Another kind of dilemma which the universities and all of those
 concerned with the national interest. face reflects the advantages

 INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION                     11
 which the Soviet government derives from academic exchange pro-
 grams. In fact, it has been evident throughout the discussions and
 bargaining over -cultural exchanges, that tough-minded Soviet diplo-
 mats and officials have taken advantage of the abiding American
 concern about the international crisis and of our efforts to persuade the
 Soviet Union to adopt more peaceful policies. In short, they use our
 efforts to launch and to maintain. these programs to obtain vast op-
 portunities for themselves. American diplomats have sought not only
 to advance our own national interests, but have also recognized legit-
 imate Soviet objectives, because they perceived that any agreement
 would have to provide benefits to both countries. However, above all,
 they have sought to create an international framework and atmosphere
 in which the two countries together could :reduce the tensions which
 afflict us both. Basically, the Soviet leaders have taken advantage of
 this spirit and approach and have concentrated on their own restricted
 interests, while seeking to minimize our benefits and to prevent our
 joint escape from the present hazardous situation into a new structure
 and a new atmosphere. For every apparent step towards a freer world
 and greater international amity, they have insisted upon a parochial
 Soviet advantage which has not affected the commonweal, except in a
 divisive way, and which has indeed exposed the Americans involved to
 substantial criticism.
 Here one must recognize that Soviet scholars, artists, and intellec-
 tuals have almost no influence on Soviet policy or on Soviet adminis-
 tration of exchange programs. These men and women share many of
 our scholars' interests. They seek to increase their knowledge within
 their own special field. They are eager to cooperate with other scholars.
 They seek the recognition and respect of other members of the inter-
 national community of scholars. Above all, they look forward to
 opportunities to leave the Soviet Union, to go "out," for a few months
 or a year.
 Those of the Party and the government who make the decisions
 are different people and have different goals. Basically, they seek to
 strengthen the Soviet system and to weaken ours. Their primary
 concern has been to obtain scientific, technical, and military informa-
 tion from the United States. They have, in short, sought to use the
 exchange programs to strengthen their economy and to obtain impor-
 tant information and techniques from a more advanced country.
 Almost eighty percent of the Soviet participants in the basic program
 administered by the Inter-University Committee have been scientists
 or engineers, while somewhat less than ten. percent of the Americans
 have been in science or technology. Thus, the Soviet Union has
 obtained a significant increment to its scientific and technical knowl-
 edge from these programs, from basic knowledge concerning polio
 vaccines to training in econometrics and new systems of business
 management to the latest work in biochemistry.
 In addition, the Soviet government has acquired a kind of respect-
 ability both at home and abroad., especially among the large and
 important class of intellectuals or intelligentsia, who have been per-
 suaded in part by these programs that the Soviet Union is a peaceful
 and responsible member of the family of nations. It also believes it
 derives recognition, prestige, and propaganda advantages from the
 presence of carefully selected Soviet scholars in American universities,
 and the impact which life in the Soviet Union presumably has on

 American scholars. Finally, it utilizes the exchange program to train
 specialists on the United .States for work in various parts of the Soviet
 -o vernnen t.
 'I'lte difference hetween our goals mach tlae Soviet -oal,, is at the root
 of our problems, but there are even more essential factors involved.
 The principal one is the Soviet system, which differs in almost every
 way from ours, particularly in its values and in its political organize-
 tion. Recognizing and accepting this st'stvm in the atmosphere of the
 IE1(O's apparently reflects the willingness of many Americans also to
 accept Soviet control of Eastern Europe and the permanence of Cona-
 ouunist control wherever it exists. In addition, we have difficulty-
 dealing with the Soviet Union, because the economic and political
 levels of the two countries are different., one an advanced industrial
 soriety with it political and social democracy. and the other basically
 an underdeveloped society under authoritarian rule, with a highly
 developed military system. and motivated by suspicion and hostility
 towards the rest of the world.
 Relations with the Soviet government and with its controlled nni-
 versities therefore create a series of problems for American inst it utions,
 which are participating in formal, highly organized and even sanitized
 exchange arrangements with it totalitarian government, which natu-
 rally takes advantage of its negotiating position. One of the dangers
 is (fat we accept this primitive system of barter its it permanent, prac-
 tice. in violation of the wiry., in which we live and believe scholars
 caught to work. Moreover, the constant compromises which we have
 to make with the Soviet Union concerningthestatus of the participants,
 fields of study, travel opportunities. and essentials of life may weary
 the Americans responsible to the point that they will accept these
 temporary compromises as permanent. In short. it will be very diffi-
 cult in the long run for Americans to be firm towards the Soviet
 government but gentle and humane towards the Soviet scholars. and
 we may drift into a type of moral demobilization.
 Another great hazard for American universities is the degree of
 influence they surrender to the Soviet government over the direction of
 American scholarship. Thus. the Soviet Ministry of Higher and
 Specialized Education, and other Soviet officials, have denied the
 opportmtity for study in the Soviet Union to Americans highly
 cfatalified for study there, on the ground that thin subject, such as the
 allocation of labor resources, is not one studied in Soviet universities,
 or that political theory in the sixteenth century is a religious issue and
 therefore unworthy of study, or that every thing important in Soviet
 agricultural problems and policies had already been enunciated by
 Khrushchev. whose speeches the interested American scholar could
 examine in the United States. In other words, the Soviet Ministry has
 denied admission to most Americans who wish to study the Soviet
 economy, modern or recent history. Soviet politics, Soviet foreign
 policy, and many scientific fields, w vile American universities through
 1968 placed every Soviet scholar nominated in a field in which lie
 could work in an American university and for which lie could obtain
 at visat.
 This Soviet practice has also led American scholars, who are
 uiaiiily interested in seeing the Soviet Union, to, change their research
 projects so that they might Obtain admission under conditions dictated
 by the Soviet government. This has helped create an imbalance among

 INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION                     13
 the fields of study within Am.erica.u universities which may become
 permanent. Thus, we have sent eighty-three historians to study
 Russian history, but no Americans have been admitted to analyze
 Soviet foreign policy or the relations between the Party and the
 government. The Soviet government has therefore been able to have
 a profound influence in fields which are important to it and has suc-
 ceeded at the same time in deflecting the direction of American
 scholarship.
 The Soviet government may also have some influence over Amer-
 icans who have studied in the Soviet Union and who wish to return
 to the country of their special professional interest as scholars in
 Russian history, literature, or government. Soviet denials to some
 scholars of the opportunity to return for further study because of
 their publications or speeches can induce cautious behavior both
 within the Soviet Union and. within the United States by American.
 scholars. This may tend to restrict the freedoms of Americans, and
 it will also assist the Soviet government to keep its scholars and other
 intellectuals isolated and under control, which is one of its main
 concerns.
 Another serious problem has been what one American has called
 the "eternal indecencies and inequitiez" of dealing with the Soviet
 Union. American scholars in most programs are not allowed to bring
 their children, which naturally reduces the number interested, and the
 Soviet government even has a ouo;.a for the number of wives allowed
 each year. Almost all of the Americans (295 of the first 300) who
 went to the Soviet Union were placed in Moscow State and Leningrad
 State Universities and were denied opportunities to study in research
 institutes of the Academy of Sciences, while at the same time, Soviet
 scholars have been placed in that American institution most qualified
 to serve them, wherever in the United States that institution might be.
 Thus, the great majority of American scholars have been restricted to
 two universities, while Soviet scholars have worked in fifty-two
 different American institutions.
 In the largest and most. important, exchange program, that for
 graduate students and young scholars, each American participant
 has been treated as an aspirant stazhor, or probationary graduate
 student, regardless of his qualifications, achievements, and age. He is
 therefore directly subject to his So- iet professor and needs his approval
 for his program, for access to libraries and archives, and for study
 related travel. One associate professor from the University of California
 who had already produced an excellent book was thus denied the right
 to study in Leningrad State University and to work in the Leningrad
 libraries on the ground that the Soviet specialist in that field in
 Leningrad was too busy to direct his work.
 American scholars also have great difficulties obtaining access to
 archives, to living sources, and to some kinds of publications in Soviet
 libraries, such as doctoral theses. At the some time, Soviet scholars
 have the same access to information in this country that any American
 scholar does. Americans are seriously restricted in their opportunities
 to travel for study or study-related purposes from Moscow and Lenin-
 grad, and they ordinarily travel only in groups and accompanied by
 Soviet "guides," when they do travel. One young American spent
 forty hours obtaining permission to go to Leningrad from Moscow to

 tion in admitting him to the Soviet Union had assured him of this
 opportunity. At the same time, Soviet, scholars are allowed to travel
 freely throughout the United States, although they do have to inform
 the Department of State four days in advance of leaving their campus.
 Life in the Soviet Union itself constitutes a kind of permanent
 inequity, because of the living conditions, the frustrations, annoyances,
 iraclignities, and inefficiency, the assessment of discriminatory prices
 for inicrolilming research materials and for hotel rooms, the effort in
 recent years to segregate Americans from Soviet scholars and students,
 and the harassment to which Americans are subject.

 pelled from the Soviet, Union, so far as we can determine Without
 ague find also without consultation or advance notice to the par-
 r icipant's Anierican university or to the Committee. Eighteen left
 early because of fear caused by Secret Police interest in their work
 or were urged to leave by the American Embassy because KGB
 interest in them had been so visibly expressed. More than twenty
 tither participants in our major program have been criticized crudely,
 viciously. and without foundation in the Soviet press as spies or
 "ideological saboteurs."
 There is no dignified or proper response to these Soviet policies and
 practices, which create it serious dilemma and which have been ac-

 the nature of the Soviet system. All of the Soviet actions have been
 annoying and irritating, and some of them have been hazardous.

 nificant advantages which accrue to the Soviet Union, and they must
 believe that these advantages outweigh those we gain and the hazards
 to them. At the same time, there is an eternal "great debate" within
 the Soviet ruling group about the utility and wisdom of continuing
 academic exchanges. In this discussion, clearly those who decide have
 concluded that the benefits to the Soviet Union justify the risks
 taken; they would otherwise have ended the exchange program.
 However, this discussion continues on almost a daily basis, the
 "score" changes often, and those who favor exchanges may not always
 triumph and may not control actions taken at every policy level.
 The main problem for the Soviet leadership is the challenge this
 new "window to the West" poses for the Soviet political system,
 especially the Communist emphasis on a political monopoly, on abso-
 lute control, and on carefully monitored relationships with other parts
 of the world. This system rests not only on Communist suspicion of
 others, but also on the suspicion which'is a traditional and even in-
 herent part of the Russian view of the rest of the world. The police
 and other members of the ruling class have become increasingly fearful.
 of Soviet intellectuals and of West ern influences upon them. Indeed,
 the Soviet rulers apparently believe the greatest internal threat to
 their system is from the intelligentsia and those most highly trained.
 They seem to agree with Louis XlV that "nations touch only at the
 top" and that outside influences, which can penetrate the Soviet
 system best at its upper level, must be contained and destroyed. They
 aiie convinced that "we are betrayed by what is false within." The
 government now headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin very much re-_
 sembles that of Nicholas I in the suspicion with which it views all
 peoples, including its own, and in the "plot mentality" which corrodes
 its approach towards everyone, native or foreign, in the Soviet Union.
 These beliefs and Soviet "ideological sensitivity" are reflected in
 the constant vigilance campaigns and in press attacks upon Soviet
 intellectuals, especially writers, for their alleged vulnerability to
 foreign ideas and influence. The Communist political system and
 philosophy, and the. suspicion with which they view even the most
 loyal servitors-and the Soviet intellectuals are by and large loyal-
 therefore help explain the Soviet dilemma and resultant Soviet
 policies. The presence of Americans and other foreigners in Soviet
 universities, where the future elite are being trained; the published
 materials which they bring with them and on occasion share with
 their Soviet fellows; the conversations they have in their dormitories
 and in class; everything which Americans and others do in the Soviet
 Union is considered a threat. As one American expressed it: "We are
 propaganda, simply because of our presence here." In short, the very
 nature of the exchange program raises very difficult problems for
 the Soviet Union and places it on the horns of a fearful and continual
 dilemma. To obtain gains which it thinks important, even crucial,
 it must risk contamination of its intellectual elite and of the ideologi-
 cal future of the country. To obtain the advantages it seeks in the
 West, it must open up the Soviet Union to some degree to foreign
 scholars. To obtain scientific and technical and military information,
 and some political advantages, it must expose itself to criticism from
 Chinese Communists and at the same time to tolerate similar policies
 from the East European governments, which are even more interested
 than the Soviet Union in exchanges with the United States. In sum-

 nary, just- as the Department of State and the universities ever ponder
 the wisdom of continuing to endure the inequities and hazards created
 by the Soviet govermment, so the Soviet rulers constantly discuss
 the balance between the advantages they acquire and the "infections"
 which may constitute the price.
 Most of the adt anta;,res and the disadvtuitages academic exchanges
 provide are clear, but perhaps some of the achievements of the past
 twelve or fifteen years should be emphasized because they are not
 visible. One important accomplishment. is the simple survival of pro-
 grauis between two suspicious and hostile states, through a series of
 international crises, at a time when failure, cancellation, or a breach
 of one kind or another might have produced it great crisis. American
 iaastit utiolis involved have demonstrated great skill and wisdom in the
 election of mature and able young men and women and have ignored
 t lie occasional dramatic. calls for sending massive numbers. The
 universities have retained their responsibility and control in it pro-
 gratah which must be of. by. and for the universities if it is to be
 ,neces_s!ul and if they are Co survive as free institutions. Thev haave
 honored themselves and their traditions in the way* in which they have
 treated all Soviet scholars on their campuses. At the same time. they
 have successfully avoided art  taint of relationship with the Cent sal
 litt_ll              or any other intelligence organization, they have
 skillfully avoided taking direct part in political warfare between tine
 rh%o countries, and they have escaped such Iragie affairs it, that of
 `arttelot. The Departihtent of State has shown the same degree of
 wisdom, restraint. and skill iii its work with the universities and
 .,chobirs, who are acutely sensitive concerning their rights find re,spun-
 ,ihilit.ies. and with the Soviet Mini_,try of Foreign Affairs and of-her
 Soy let government agencies, which have been vigorous and deniand-
 tuuz iii pursuit of what they consider Soviet interests.
 At- the same time, the exchange programs in ninny ways hay a been
 a failure. We are following die principles and working within the
 franttenork established in 1958 and are now more than ever committed
 to a program which is Lite antithesis of the way in which Americans
 believe research in other countries should be arranged. Soviet scholars
 :utd other Soviet citizens are no more free to obtain Aiiierican and
 other Western publications than they were when the exchanges began.
 Ill fact, we have made no prog ?ess towards the hopes which Ainba,-
 saalor Lacy expressed in 1947 for "removing, barriers currently ob-
 st rnrtiug the free flow of information tabu idea," and providing benefit
 to hot.h people -of free discussion, criticism, awl debate lilt the vital
 issues of the day." We have not succeeded in exchanging teachers,
 eveu teachers of language-; there are no joint research projects, even
 fill subjects of common, concern, such i-, air poollution: the exchange of
 radio and television programs is extremely limited and directly con-
 [rolled by the Soviet government, and all American proposals for
 espunding the exchange program even iii the present framework, such
 it, through summer study and summer seminars, have been bratsduely
 rejected by the Soviet government-. Indeed, the programs in progress
 in 1969- 1970 are just half as large its those the American universities

 anticipated when they made their budget estimates for 1065-1970 in
 the spring of 1964.
 In short, there has been more continuity than change in Soviet
 policy and practice. The stone wall of the closed society still exists,
 even though the powerful magnet of Western ideas and Western
 progress still attracts, perhaps more strongly than ever, the Soviet
 intellectuals still isolated behind those barriers.
 Even so, the exchanges on balance have been an advantage to us,
 and we should continue them. In fact, both we and the Soviet Union
 have little choice but to continue, because ending them now would
 be such a dreadful blow at a time of high crisis. They constitute,
 in fact, a valuable opportunity to continue to work with the Soviet
 government and to reach Soviet citizens. We should rejoice over this
 opportunity, particularly because the exchange involves ideas and
 information, and therefore a kind. of competition with the Soviet
 Union on grounds congenial or favorable to us in areas where freedom
 has given us great advantages it, cultural vitality.
 However, we should also appreciate the new and to some degree
 dangerous role the American university and scholars now occupy.
 For those who believe that the work of the college should be "rele-
 vant," American educational institutions in this case at least have
 placed themselves on the firing line. This shift places a very heavy
 responsibility on the universities and on all those who wish them to
 accept such a role.
 The experience of the past fifteen years suggests that the American
 universities and the American government together have identified the
 correct principles for administering scholarly exchange programs with
 governments which have different ideologies and philosophies. Ad-
 ministrators and scholars in particular must ensure that universities
 remain centers of free inquiry; that they maintain the clear distinction
 between scholarship and political warfare and espionage; and that
 they be eternally vigilant in their relations with our government and
 with other governments as well. Above all, they should insist that our
 scholars are treated with the decency and dignity all men and women
 deserve, especially when they are guests in another country. We can
 achieve no great purpose by tolerating procedures which undermine the
 principles for which we stand.
 Moreover, the role of the university, and of the scholars, scientists
 and. artists, should be preeminent in those fields in which they have
 particular concern and responsibility; academic quality should be the
 primary factor in the selection process; the Americans selected for
 study in a Communist country should be men and women of maturity
 and stability; the selection process should be on a national basis, with
 recognized and competent scholars making the decisions and with
 scholars and graduate students in all fields of knowledge encouraged
 to participate.
 At the same time, we have learned that academic exchange programs
 of this kind require the reorganization of individual universities and
 increased cooperative efforts among educational institutions. Uni-
 versity administrators and scholars must maintain a high degree of
 sophistication if programs like this are to be successful. We must pay
 more attention to educating the American public concerning the sig-
 nificance of academic exchanges and the problems which they in-

 evitably raise, if the public is to understand them and provide the
 necessary support in the long future.
 Above all, we should have learned that the universities, the other
 scholarly organizations involved, and the government should work
 together to create a new kind of organization of public and private
 institutions, including the foundations, to coordinate the work in-
 volved. Our resources for exchange programs with Communist
 countries are too scarce to allow us to continue in a kind of free-fur-all,
 highly competitive, and dangerous basis. Ideally, this "American
 ('ocuicil" should be a semi-public organization, with the Board of
 Directors composed of private citizens nominated by the President
 and approved by the Senate, and with funds contributed in part by the
 federal government. and in part by private organizations, such as
 foundations, universities, business and labor groups, and organizations
 especially interested in the arts and sciences. It should possess full
 authority for all cultural exchange programs with all countries ruled
 by Communists, and it should speak for the universities and other
 cultural organizations in its dealings with the Department of State and
 rith foreign governments.
 if it should prove impossible to establish such an organization--and
 recent unsuccessful efforts have identified a number of compliecitions--
 the organizations involved in and responsible for such exchange pro-
 grains should at least form a loose federal organization to pool infor-
 ination, to consult concerning plans and programs, and to coordinate
 activities. After they have learned to cooperate and to work together,
 they should consider combining their operations and then coordinating
 American programs with those of other countries in an open way so
 as to persuade the Soviet Union that no conspiracy was beig directed
 against it.
 Such an organization and such a program should reduce the invisible
 costs which academic exchanges involve, eliminate some of the friction
 and tension among American organizations, and reflect the pluralistic
 approach which Americans traditionally adopt. At the same tinge,
 they should guarantee the necessary political sensitivity.  Such an
 organization should also serve as a shock absorber, on one side for
 the universities, and on the other side for the federal government,
 reducing the pressures to which both are now subject.
 The long term goal of everyone involved in academic exchanges
 with the Soviet Union and with other Communist countries should
 remain, of course, the free movement of people and materials. In
 fact, the new coordinating organization should be established with
 the expressed hope and goal that it wither away when free movement
 becomes possible.
 China has isolated itself, and has in general been isolated from, the
 rest of the world for the twenty years during which Communists have
 had control over that enormous country. This isolation will end one
 clay, with new problems and new opportunities for the Chinese and
 for the rest of the world. Clearly, American scholars and American
 government officials should begin to phin now for that day, benefiting
 from the experiences provided by our exchanges with the Soviet
 Union. In particular, we should recognize that the first steps will be
 decisive, as they have been in our arrangements with the Soviet
 Union, because they will establish the structure, principles, and
 procedures which Communist rulers will be most reluctant to change.

 We should, therefore, seek to ensure that all institutions and all
 fields of study be open to scholars of both countries, and that the entire
 area of both countries should be freely accessible. We should seek
 equity, not reciprocity. We should insist upon, or ,it least always
 retain the opportunity for, arrangements for exchanges of all kinds,
 short and long-term, of specialists and of teachers, of senior scholars
 and of graduate students. We should guarantee that scholars from
 both countries receive appropriate status and recognition, possess
 the right for study-related travel, and have the same access to research
 materials in libraries and laboratories as do natives. Finally, we
 should ensure that the academic exchanges not be restricted to men
 and women; the free flow of published materials between the two
 countries should be an integral part of the agreement.
 The nature of the world in which the Americans, the Chinese, and
 the Russians live suggests that relations among these states and their
 peoples will remain delicate and hazardous. We shall no doubt remain
 locked in a shrinking world, suspicious of and hostile towards each
 other, unable on one hand to conquer or overthrow the other but
 equally unable to disengage and flee into some kind of armed security.
 Cultural relations in this situation will remain of considerable im-
 portance, but can never be decisive. In such a position, we in the
 United States should maintain our economic, political, and spiritual
 vitality and our military strength, cooperate with other peoples who
 share our general goals and who are committed to peaceful progress,
 and continue to demonstrate that we are as resolute as in 1776 or in
 1942 to defend our interests. At the same time, we should try further
 to define and understand the nature of the political and economic
 systems with which we are engaged, to persuade them of our goals and
 of the kind of world we seek, and to make effective use of cultural
 exchange, of trade, and of other peaceful instruments to bring these
 goals within reach.
 The situation we face is very much like the Eastern Question,
 devilishly complicated, deeply rooted in the past, involving numbers
 of peoples, and beyond easy or quick solution. Intellect and strength,
 grace and perseverance will both be required and expected of us.
 Scholarly exchanges in these circuiastanees provide us an opportunity
 to use some of our enduring strengths to assist our rivals and ourselves
 together to make a step towards peace.

 The fact that in Romania such modern enterprises are being built, is more tellingly
 illustrating than figures the successes recorded by the Romanian people, on its
 path towards socialism.   The successes achieved in your country are the outcome of
 the selfless work of workers, peasants, intellectu&ls, of the fraternal alliance and
 cooperation of the socialist states, of the mutual assistance, that give the
 opportunity to the fraternal peoples to speed up the progress of the entire
 socialist camp.
 Showing that 25 years ago when the working class became a ruling class in a series
 of countries, the first problem it faced was the ensuring of state independence,
 without which the revolutionary changes could not be achieved, K.F. Katushev
 stressed that this problem was settled precisely due to the fact that the young
 socialist states, together with the first world socialist state--the Soviet Union--
 created a lasting defensive alliance materialized in the Warsaw treaty, in
 bilateral friendship and mutual assistance treaties.   It is precisely that alliance
 which ensured the state independence and sovereignty of the socialist countries
 against the imperialist plots, and it is precisely due to this fact that the
 peoples have acquired the possibility of working unhampered, changing the look of
 their countries, and building a new life.
 We can state the same about the economic problems.  We have at our disposal a
 ratified mechanism of economic and technieo-scientific cooperation that allows for
 ampler and more complex problems to be put and solved, related to the development
 of the national economies and of culture in each of the socialist countries.
 Referring then to the economic links between the Soviet Union and Romania-, the,
 speaker pointed out that during this year the exchanges of goods will surpass 800
 million roubles.
 This mutual advantageous cooperation, he said, will develop and deepen in the future,
 too, because it corresponds to the vital interests of our peoples.,  After speaking
 about some successes and present day preoccupations of the Soviet people on many
 fields, K.F. Katushev said:
 We hold dear the friendship uniting the communists, the working class, and all the
 working class, and all the working people of the Soviet Union and of Romania.  Let
 this friendship. strengthen and develop to the welfare of our countries and of world
 socialism.
 The speeches delivered during this meeting were repeatedly punctuated by loud
 applause.  K.F. Katushev handed over to the host the bust of V.I, Lenin and.a
 dummy of the Moscow television tower.  The meeting of the members of the CPSU
 delegation with the workers of the Bucharest machine-tool and aggregate works was
 an enthusiastic manifestation of the friendship between the RCP and the CPSU,
 between the Socialist Republic of Romania and the Soviet Union, friendship which
 has deep roots in. the historic past of the two countries.

 The CPSU is linked with the Romanian Communast Party by decades of joint struggle
 against imperialism and fascism and for the ideals of the working class.   Our
 countries are united by relations of alliance within the framework of the Warsaw
 Pact and CEMA.  For the Soviet people the Romanian people are friends and
 comrades in arms in the lofty work of creating a new social order.
 Your congress, Konstantin Katushev added, is reviewing the results of party
 activity carried out with regard to the guidance of all spheres of the country?s
 life and to planning its future prospects.  The work of the congress has revealed
 the multilateral activity unfolded by party organizations and the sustained labor
 of the working class, peasants, and intelligentsia in constructing the socialist
 society.
 After the liberation from the fascist yoke, Romanian working people have, in a
 short period, transformed their country into.a socialist state which possesses a
 developed industry and agriculture and advanced science and culture.  The successes
 achieved by your country and by other socialist countries also represent a result
 of fraternal mutual assistance, of close cooperation in the political, economic,
 and military spheres.   The friendship and collaboration of socialist countries
 protect the independence and sovereignty of each from any attempt made by
 imperialism, assuring them of all necessary conditions-for peaceful and constructive
 work, for rapid advancement along the road of socialism and communism.
 At present, the world socialist system exerts tremendous influence over the
 development of all mankind, representing the decisive force in the anti-imperialist
 struggle.-  This fact was unanimously recognized once again at the recent inter-
 national meeting in Moscow of communist and workers parties.  We all know what a
 fierce struggle the imperialists are waging against socialist countries on all
 fronts.   in this fight our class adversariez do not hesitate to use any method
 beginning with the perfidious tactics of bridge-building, aimed at undermining the
 unity of socialist countries, at sowing discord among them, to overtly supporting
 all antisocialist forces and organizing counterrevolutionary plots, from attempts
 at economic penetration to direct armed intervention.
 By showing political vigilance and proletari.ar solidarity in defending socialist
 gains, the communist parties and working people from fraternal countries not only
 repulse these imperialist attacks, but also t+F''  heavy blows aimed at continuously
 increasing the balance of force in their favor.    hi"~~ teaches us that the successes
 scored in the struggle against imperialism e     ;i direct proportion to the unity
 of socialist countries, of the fraternal co,-!;In ,.i parties and of all progressive
 forces of our epoch.   The example set by thy, iei:'oic Vietnamese people, who have
 inflicted defeats on the U.S. aggressors cu,-pel_..ng them to come to the negotiation
 table, strikingly demonstrates that a peopI    lung up to fight for their indepen-
 dence, and relying on the support of fratern:l socialist countries, on the
 solidarity of the world communist movement, are invincible.
 The communist and workers parties which toe.--,i. part in the international conference
 have resolutely stressed that the defense of socialism is an internationalist duty
 communists.

 For communists from the socialist countries this primarily means the necessity to
 show major concern for continuous and close political and economic cooperation between
 socialist countries, for strengthening their collective defense potential.

 important in consolidating their defensive organization,, which dnsures.,the.,s,ecurity

 want to revise the results of World War II.
 Our cohesion and unity of actionplay an extremely important role in supporting the
 national liberation movement, the just struggle waged by the Arab peoples against
 Israeli aggression, which is encouraged by international imperialism.
 The watchword, unity of action of all revolutionar.V,-ant.i...imperialist forceg,'' is 'the
 most militant, most topical slogan of our time.  Precisely because of this the problem
 of unity represented the main theme at the international conference of communists,
 a remarkable event in the life of the world communist movement, an important stage
 in the work of cementing its ranks.  The conference made possible a profound
 analysis of the present world situation, defined the methods of peoples, struggle
 against imperialism, for peace, democracy, and national and social progress.
 Comrades, Konstantin Katushev added, today, when socialist states have laid a strong
 foundation for multilateral economic development., they set themselves even greater
 tasks in the area of,continuous economic development, technical progress to increase
 the people's standard-of life, development of science and culture.
 To solve these problems, the decisions unanimously adopted at the 23d  Special Session
 of CEMA are of particular importance. The complex program outlined by the session
 on developing mutually advantageous cooperation and socialist economic integration,
 based on principles of socialist internationalism, respect for the principle of
 free consent and state sovereignty, coincides with the fundamental interests of
 our peoples..
 One can say with certainty that communist parties from the socialist countries,
 promoting a consistent Marxist-Leninist policy and approaching present problems
 from positions of strength, will further (?strengthen) the force of the world system
 of socialism and its impact on world events and will consolidate the unity of world
 communism.
 Closely rallied around the CPSU Central Committee, Soviet communists and working people
 warmly approve the results of the international communist meeting, the line promoted
 by our party in foreign policy and in the world communist movement.  They unanimously
 support the statement made by Comrade Brezhnev, general secretary. of the CPSU Central
 Committee, who said that our party will spare no efforts in order to strengthen the
 unity of the communist movement and will fully carry out its international duty.
 The CPSU and all Soviet people concentrate their efforts on constructing communism,
 on maintaining and consolidating peace.  Each step along this path lead to further
 realizing the development of the country's economy, for the real improvement of living
 conditions of Soviet people, the enhancing their cultural standard, and the
 accumulation of new scientific and art assets.

 After reaching advanced positions concerning  a -amber of important areas of scientific
 and technical development, our country is presently building the largest electric
 power systems in the world, unique electronic apparatuses, great nuclear power
 centers, and supersonic airliners, while realizing a vast program of space explora-
 tion.  The industrial production of the USSR has more than doubled in the last'8
 years, and agricultural production is more than a third greater.  The system of 5
 work days and 2 days off has been introduced in the country.   Over 10 million
 people are moving into new flats each year, improving their housing conditions,
 Nearly 1.5 million specialists graduate yearly from Soviet teaching establishments,
 after higher and medium studies.
 While exerting leadership over the construction of communism, the CPSU attaches
 great importance to problems concerning the continuous development of socialist
 democracy, bringing the broad people's masses into the country's management,
 consistently insuring the principle of comradeship in work and of other Leninist
 rules regarding party life, development, ani: strengthening the brotherly friendship
 between peoples of our country, educating working people in the spirit of socialist
 internationalism and attachment of communism.
 At present, our party and all Soviet people develop their activity under the sign
 of preparations for the birth centenary of Lenin, the founder of our party and state,
 the leader of the international communist movement.  The Lenin centenary will be'
 greeted with fresh realizations in the construction of communism.  We consider attach-
 ment to glorious Lenin's teaching, the realization of Lenin's teachings as a guarantee
 for remarkable victories in the struggle for the cause of peace, democracy, national
 independence, and socialism.
 In conclusion, Comrade Konstantin Katushev read the text of the CPSU Central
 Committee message to the 10th Romanian Communist 1[ arty Congress.
 The message reads:   The CPSU Central Committee, on behalf of Soviet communists and
 all Soviet people, conveys to the delegates to the 10th Romanian Communist Party
 Congress, and through you to the communists and working people of the Socialist
 Republic of Romania, fraternal greetings ana good wishes for success in the work of the
 congress.
 .In a short historic period, within the framework of the fraternal family of the
 people of the socialist states, the Rcmanftar, working people have achieved remarkable
 successes in constructing the new life.  Currently the 10th Romanian Communist Party
 Congress is discussing a program for the continuous and multilateral development of
 socialist society.
 We are certain that the Romanian Communist Party' and all Romanian people, consistently
 guided by the glorious Marxist-Leninist teaching, will succeed in achieving new
 victories in completing the construction of socialism, in. the development of economy,
 science, and culture, in the continuous development of the material well-being of the
 working people.
 The present international situation, the aggressive schemes of imperialist circles,
 the intensification of the'arms race, and the activities of imperialist blocs,'the
 sharpening of the ideological struggle in the international arena, all this requires
 .a well-defined class stand, the strengthening of the cohesion and unity of action
 of socialist caauntries, of the communist movement, and of all anti-imperialist
 forces.

 .mobilizing role in strengthening this militant, international cooperation.  The
 conference documents contain a program for a deployed struggle, at the present stage,
 against imperialism, for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism..
 The collective experience of the fraternal parties shows in a telling manner that the
 combination of national tasks and international development of brotherly cooperation and
 mutual assistance, within the.Warsaw Pact and CE?A; increase the forces of each socialist
 country, contribute to the general consolidation of the positions of socialism in Europe
 .and.the world.

 The spirit of Bratislava, the article says, is socialist internationalism in

 Recalling that in Bratislava the six fraternal. -parties called for a further
 development of the economic cooperation of socialist countries on a bilateral

 that "the Soviet Union and other socialist states have achieved historic successes

 ,stressed in their statement that the present situation requires unrelenting
 effort to raise the defense capacity of each socialist state and the entire

 the Warsaw Pact.  This question became a subject of particularly close scrutiny at
 the meeting of the Warsaw Pact Political Consultative Committee in March 1969 in
 Budapest.
 The communist and workers parties that participated in the Bratislava conference
 and signed the statement, Novikov says, regarded as their paramount task
 implementation of all conditions contained in the unanimously adopted document.
 Consistent and unswerving implementation of these conditions is aimed at a still
 greater strengthening of the positions of socialism in each country and in the
 entire socialist community.  This was convincingly borne out by the recent events

 SOCIALIST COUNTRIES' STRUGGLE DEMANDS UNITY
 USSR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
 Moscow PRAVDA 3. Aug 69 p 4 L
 (Editorial article:   "The Defense of Socialism Ids the International' Duty of Communists")
 [Text] The peoples of the socialist community under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist
 communist and workers parties are confidently creating a new society.   By their labor
 and their glorious achievements they are steadily multiplying the socialist countries'
 gains in developing the economy, science, and culture, improving the people's standard
 of living, and strengthening the state order.  The Polish People's Republic has just
 celebrated the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the new power.  The Bulgarian
 People's Republic and the Socialist Republic of Romania are preparing to meet the jubilee
 of the 25th anniversary of their entry onto the socialist road of development.  The GDR. ::
 is preparing for the 20th anniversary of the proclamation of the first worker-peasant
 state on German soil. In a short period these countries, like the other fraternal states,.
 have,gained important victories in all fields of.building a new life.
 During these years, these European socialist countries have created a mighty industry,
 implemented important reforms in the countryside, and insured the flourishing of national..
 culture and a continual increase in the people's well-being.  In the last 10 years alone,,.,
 the national income of the countries belonging to CEMA has increased by 93 percent.  The
 CEMA countries occupy only 18 percent of the earth's territory and only 10 percent of the,.
 world's population; live in them,  yet they produce roughly one-third of world industrial
 output.  These victories are eloquent proof of the inexhaustible life forces of the
 STATOTHR            socialist order and the. triumph of Marxist-Leninist teaching.  The socialist order is
 the advantages of its ec-
 full
 y
 becoming increasingly more mature and reveals ever more
 onomic and socio-pol.itical organization and the true democratism inherent in it.  The
 socialist countries international authority and their role in resolving the fundamental
 questions of world politics are continually growing.  The Soviet Union and the other
 socialist states, by their example, are inspiring the working people of the capitalist
 world to struggle for their rights and a bright future.
 The historic successes of the socialist countries are the result of the heroic efforts
 and selfless labor of millions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, the communist
 and workers parties' skillful direction of the processes of socialist building, and the
 t 1  lementation of Marxist-Leninist teaching in the concrete conditions of
 consl.s en   mp
 each country.  At the same time, it is the result of the fraternal countries, comprehen-
 rinciples of mutual aid and sup

 pects of life, facilitiates the resolution of important issues and helps the fraternal
 peoples to better fulfill the tasks set before them.
 The achievements of each socialist country are the common property of the whole social-
 ist system and each people's concrete contribution to strngthening the positions of world
 socialism.. The support, consolidation, and defense of these gains is the international
 duty of all  socialist countries.  This conclusion, dictated by life and steming from
 the interests of each socialist state and the entire socialist community, permeates the
 whole content of the statement of the socialist countries',oommunist and workers parties.,,
 adopted a year ago at the Bratislava conference.                                                                     ~.E

 The representatives of the conmunist and workers parties of Bulgaria, Hungary, the GDR,
 Poland, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, in convening the Bratislava conference,
 proceeded from fact that-the complex international situation and imperialism's subversive
 activities directied against the people's peace and security and the cause of socialism
 demanded the further unity of the countries of the socialist s$rstem.  They also took into
 consideration the fact that the development of socialism raises new problems, the
 solution of which requries the unification of the socialist states efforts.
 The participants in the meeting expressed the inflexible determination to develop and
 defehd socialist achievements in their countries and to achieve new sucesses in
 strenghthening of socialism's positions and rebuffing imperialism's intrigues is steadfast
 loyalty to Marxism-Leninism, education of the masses in the spirit of socialist ideas,
 proletarian internationalism, and an uncompromising struggle with the bourgeois
 ideology and all antisocialist forces.
 The Bratislava statement says:   "The fraternal parties firmly and decisively oppose
 their unbrea"able solidarity and high vigilance to any attempts by imperialism all other
 anticommunit forces to weaken the leading role of the working class and the communist
 parties.  They will not permit anyone anywhere to drive a wedge between the socialist
 states and to undermine the bases of the socialist social system.  The fraternal
 friendship and cohesion in this direction meet the vital interests of our peoples and
 form a reliable basis on which to resolve the socioeconomic and political tasks, on which
 our countries communist patties are working."
 The entire development of events in the world this past year has shown us the vitality
 and importance of the conclusions drawn in that document and their great theoretical,
 political, and practical significance.   Time has quite manifestly confirmed that the
 measures being implemented by the fraternal countries for strengthening the positions
 of socialism and for collective defense of socialist achievements are absolutely correct
 and timely.  Imperialist reaction has again been convincingly taught that the peoples
 of the fraternal countries are standing firmly on guard of socialist achievements and
 that any intrigues by the enemies of socialism are doomed to failure.
 iSpeaking at the celebrations in Warsaw, CPSU Central Committee Genral Secretary L.I.
 Brezhnev said:   "Let our class enemies harbor no illusions  about finding an opportunity
 of cancelling out the historical. achievements of socialism. Such a thing will not happen!
 The guarantee of this is the ~'(.creative,) conscious labor of the peoples of the socialist
 countries, their majestic plans, and their general determination to develop their
 fraternal cooperation in all spheres, and to strengthen the Warsaw Pact which reliably
 insures the sovereignty of its participants and the security and inviolability of the
 frontiers of socialism in Europe. . . ."
 The fraternal parties are doing great work to strengthen the might of the countries
 of socialism and for the broad, comprehensive coordination of efforts directed toward
 resolving tasks facing them and for utilizing all the capabilities contained in the
 new social system.
 The development of the countries of socialism is characterized by an increase in the
 political activity of the working class, the peasantry, the intelligentsia, and all
 the working people; by the comprehensive progress of the socialist social system; by
 the further development of socialist democracy; and by the improvement  of the
 style and methods of party, state, and economic works.

 ITT.   5 Aug 69                           A 26              USSR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
 The leading role of the working class and its vanguard--the communist and workers
 parties--is growing stronger in the fraternal countries.
 The socialist.countries' deepening and improvement of economic cooperation on a
 bilateral and multilateral basis is continuing.  These questions were widely discussed
 at the 23d a9  cial CEMA session, in which the leaders of the communist and workers
 parties and tt,:,e heads of government of the CEMA moimber countries participated.  Its
 decisions aimed at further widening comprehensive economic cooperation have great
 significance in strengthening the might of each country and the entire socialist system,
 in consolidating the positions of the socialist'countries,'and in strengthening the
 unity of the socialist community.
 The socialist countries' close fraternal ties also find expression in their foreign
 -o'.icy cooperation, in the collective examination of the key problems of international
 .life.  The Budapest conference of the Warsaw Pact member states, Political Con-
 sultative Committee represented a major contribution to the struggle for peace and
 security.  The appeal adopted in Budapest to all European countries concerning the
 preparation and conducting of a general European. conference on',questions of security
 and cooperation is receiving understanding and support among broad circles of the
 public on our continent.  The Budapest conference decisions are carving a path for the
 settlement of urgent international problems in the interests of insuring peace and
 security in Europe and throughout the world.
 Socialism's enormous contribution toward accelerating historical progress and to the.
 common cause of the anti-imperialist forces received a high evaluation at the internation;
 conference of communist and workers parties.  The conference noted that the world
 socialist system is the decisive force in the anti-imperialist struggle. Every liberation
 struggle finds absolutely irreplaceable support from the world socialist system,
 primarily from the Soviet Union.  Relying upon its,own constantly growing economic
 and defense might, the world socialist system is fettering imperialism and restricting
 its opportunities for exporting counterrevolution.  In fulfilling their international
 duty, the socialist countries are rendering increasing assistance to the peoples
 struggling for freedom and independence and are strengthening peace and international
 security.
 The emergence and development of the. world socialist system is
 part of the class battles in the international arena.
 The victories of all revolutionary forces and the new wrorld's successful opposition to
 the old depend to a decisive extent upon the further achievements of the socialist system
 upon its cohesion, and upon the ability and capacity of the ruling parties of the
 socialist countries to utilize the opportunities built into the new social system.  Hence,
 it follows that concern for strengthening the world system of socialism is simultaneously
 a concern for the world revolutionary process' development and concern for an effective
 struggle against imperialism.  The conference confirmed that the chief orientation in
 the cause of the socialist system's cohesion is represented by the unswerving
 implementation of the principles of socialist internationalism, the correct combination
 of the socialist states' national and international tasks, and the development of.
 fraternal mutual assistance and support.  Life is demonstrating with the utmost
 clarity the ever-increasing significance of the principles of socialist internationalism
 which lie at the..basis of relations between the countries of.the socialist community.

 The enemies of the new system  are not ceasing their attempts to undermine the bases
 of popular state power in the socialist countries, to frustrate the cause of the
 socialist transformation of society, and to reestablish their dominion.  Thus, the
 conference stressed with all force that the defense of socialism is the communists'
 international duty.  A break with internationalism, rejection of the socialist
 countries' coordinated actions, and a retreat from Marxism-Leninism are all inflicting
 harm upon the cause of socialism and upon the interests of the revolutionary struggle.
 The policy of the present CCP leadership is ari example of this.  The Mao Tse-tung
 group's splitting, great-power chauvinist activities on the international arena give
 voice to the fact that China's foreign policy has to all intents and purposes broken with
 proletarian internationalism and has lost its class socialist content.  This ruinous
 .course by the Mao group is meeting with a decisive rebuff by the overwhelming majority
 of fraternal communist and workers parties.
 The establishment of the new type of international relations and the development of the
 socialist states' fraternal alliance is a complex historical process during which
 difficulties and differences can arise.  The communists believe that these difficulties
 and differences must not break the socialist states' united front in the struggle
 against imperialism.  The socialist system is founded upon the community of
 socioeconomic system and upon the coincidence of the fundamental interests and aims
 of the countries belonging to it.   This community  is the guarantee of overcoming
 existing difficulties and the further strengthening of the socialist system's unity
 on Marxist-Leninist and proletarian internationalist principles.  Our Leninist party,
 .our country, and our people have always been true to their international duty.  As the
 CPSU Central Committee June plenum stressed, the USSR's foreign policy is playing and
 will continue to play a most important role in the common struggle by the anti-imperialist
 ..forces and in strengthening the might and cohesion of the community of socialist
 countries.  It will serve as an effective instrument for frustrating imperialism's
 aggressive plans, preserving peace, confirming the principles of the peaceful cooperation
 of states with different social systems, and for supporting the peoples' liberation
 struggle.
 Socialism's successes, its influence upon the course of world events, and the
 effectiveness of its struggle against imperialist aggression depend to a considerable
 degree upon the socialist countries' cohesion.    The socialist countries' unity of
 action is an important factor for the cohesion of all anti-imperialist forces.  Our
 party and the Soviet state have exerted and are exerting all efforts to insure that
 socialism's achievements are strong and inviolable, that the cause of socialism is
 consolidated and developed, and that the successes of the revolutionary forces and of the
 entire anti-imperialist front in the struggle for peace, democracy, national

 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 The Results of the World Communist Conference
 Summary,
 If the final outcome of the world Communist con-
 ference came near to satisfying Soviet goals, it was
 only because those goals had been progressively re-
 duced throughout the years of haggling that preceded
 the conference.   In the end, Moscow probably hoped
 to achieve little more than to convene a conference,
 to gain a high attendance of parties, to obtain con-
 demnation of the Chinese, and to produce a document
 that would serve as a new doctrinal "reference"
 point and demonstrate the ideological unity of the
 world's Communist parties.   The conference failed,
 however, to infuse a new sense of discipline into
 world Communism or to chart a coherent course of
 action for the national. parties.   The conference
 record and the conference documents can and will be
 quoted in support of views that remain divergent.
 Note:   This memorandum has been produced solely by
 CIA.  It has been prepared by the Office of Current
 Intelligence and coordinated with the Office of Na-
 tional Estimates and the Clandestine Services.

 Convening the Conference*
 1.   Many parties had feared from the beginning
 that Moscow would manipulate the China issue to re-
 strict their independence at a conference, and these
 misgivings increased following the invasion of Czech-
 oslovakia   The Soviets, however, did what was re-
 quired to bring the conference off.   In November 1967,
 as the campaign to organize a consultative meeting was
 getting under way, they publicly disclaimed any inten-
 tion of condemning China.   At the consultative meeting
 in Budapest in February 1968 they further buried the
 China issue by rallying the parties to the single
 theme of "anti-imperialism," which might be expected
 to unify them if nothing else could.   In the effort
 to prevent the issue from beclouding preparations for
 the conference, Moscow went so far-as to propose a
 new method for working out a conference document.
 The document was to be formulated and approved by the
 parties before the conference took place.
 2.   These tactics might have made it possible
 for the Soviets to convene the conference as planned,
 on 25 November, despite the golden opportunity given
 certain parties to protract the process by criticizing
 Soviet-approved drafts of the document, had it not
 been for the invasion of Czechoslovakia.  The adverse
 reaction of the western European parties, chiefly
 Italy and France, caused the conference to be post-
 poned twice until it was finally set for 5 June at
 a meeting in late March.   Romania took a particularly
 dim view of the doctrine of "limited sovereignty"
 promulgated by the Soviets to justify the invasion.
 The Soviet Union sought to counter the reaction in
 Europe by applying financial and other pressures
 where it could,   These measures worked, and the con-
 ference was assured.

 A High Attendance
 3.   From the outset, it was clear that Chinese
 participation in the conference was out of the ques-
 tion   In March 1965, when the 26 original drafters
 of the 1960 conference document were called to Mos-
 cow to organize a new conference, the Soviet Commu-
 nist party might well have judged from the incomplete
 response that Albania, North Vietnam, Indonesia,
 Japan, North Korea and possibly Romania would be non-
 participants.   Yugoslavia, which had been condemned
 at the 1960 conference, was undoubtedly written off
 by the Soviets early in their calculations.   Cuba
 failed to respond to the next organizing call to
 the same 26 parties in November 1967, and was added
 to the list.   As a result of the preparatory meetings
 in 1968, to which all parties were invited, it ap-
 peared that Romania would be a likely participant,
 but it became virtually certain that China's satel-
 lite parties  (Burma, Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand)
 would not be represented in Moscow.   This meant that
 there were around 80 parties left that Moscow could
 hope to attract to the conference.
 4. Ultimately,  75 parties officially partici-
 pated, including Cuba and Sweden, which sent observers,
 and two "underground parties," reportedly Nepal and
 the Philippines.   The appearance of Cuba gave a de-
 cided boost to the Soviets.   The only significant
 nonruling parties that did not attend were Japan
 and the Netherlands.   Although the Soviet party un-
 successfully sought the participation of North Viet-
 nam and North Korea, the number of parties on hand was
 probably satisfactory from the Soviet point of view.
 Asia was underrepresented, but otherwise the gather-
 ing was truly world-wide.   Attendance by the absent
 parties would only have further strained the already
 shaky facade of unity.
 Condemnation of China
 5.   During the years of increasing difficulty with
 China, the Soviets have sought by various means to get
 a condemnation of China and an expression of solidarity
 from other parties.   They realized, however, their ef-
 forts to humble China aroused fears in other parties

 25X1
 Declassified in Part -Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/30: CIA-RDP71 B00364R000100230001-1
 for their own independence.   It was also apparent
 that any attempt formally to expel China from the
 movement would cost Moscow a meaningful interna-
 tional conference.
 6.   By late March the Soviets were in a posi-
 tion to take a realistic reading of the strength of
 the opposition.   Up to that time dissent had been
 expressed mainly over the wording of the draft docu-
 ment, notably by the Italians and Romanians.   The
 French party, previously a pleader for its independ-
 ent status, had caved in by the March preparatory
 meeting, when it not only supported but also report-
 edly had a hand in formulating the draft of the docu-
 ment that emerged from that meeting.   Smaller par-
 ties in opposition to the draft document were Great
 Britain, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, San
 Marino, Mexico, Dominican Republic and Reunion.   The
 opposition of the smaller parties on an issue like
 China was obviously of little concern to the Soviets,
 but that of Italy and Romania was more serious.
 7.   By the time of the final May preparatory
 meeting, growing tension on the Sino-Soviet border
 and the conclusion of the Chinese party congress
 led Moscow to introduce the China issue on the floor
 of the conference,
 8.          Brezhnev's keynote speech of 7 June included
 a major section devoted to the China question, and
 placed Moscow's anger with China on the conference
 record,     In a rough box score of speeches by the 75
 delegates, some 51, including the Italians, condemned
 the Chinese leadership explicitly; two, including
 Romania, adopted a neutral stance;  and 19 avoided the
 issue, though several alluded to it by condemning
 "left opportunism."   This was probably the single
 most important issue of the conference for the Soviets,
 and they received the show of solidarity they sought.
 The Czechoslovak Issue
 9.   Moscow hoped to avoid discussion of the inva-
 sion altogether, and shortly before the conference
 the Czechoslovak party went on record urging that the
 matter not be raised.  Nevertheless, ten parties ex-
 plicitly criticized the Soviet-led invasion.   Presumably

 at at Soviet instigation,  four parties responded by de-
 fending the action, and some 60 parties did not men-
 tion it.   Although this minimized what could have been
 a very embarrassing situation for the Soviets Moscow
 was forced to water down references in the conference
 documents to the international responsibilities of
 individual parties.
 The Conference Record and Documents
 10.   The conference of 75 parties ran 13 days,
 5 to 17 June.   Except for the main conference docu-
 ment, other documents on the centenary of Lenin's
 birth, Vietnam, peace, Israeli aggression and soli-
 darity with Communists under repression, ran into
 little opposition.   The conference, apparently de-
 ferring to the insistence of parties like the French,
 Italian and Romanian, adopted a proposal to explore
 the holding of a broad-based world "anti-imperialist"
 congress, but significantly did not specify a target
 date.   The main document on the   imperialist  threat
 and the "unity" of the Communist world, which had
 been the subject of controversy for over a year, under-
 went revision up to the final days of the conference.
 Its language was generalized and made vague enough
 to permit the parties to find in it words or phrases
 to support differing views.
 11.   The main conference document was adopted
 on the last day of the conference.   The Dominican
 Republic delegate did not support the document as
 a whole,  and did not sign.   The Cuban and Swedish
 parties,  as observers,  also did not sign.   The Brit-
 ish and Norwegian delegates withheld their signatures,
 referring the decision whether to sign or not to their
 central committees,   The parties of Australia, Italy
 and San Marino agreed to sign only one of the four
 sections of the document, the section in anti-imperial-
 ism.   The parties of Switzerland, Sudan, Romania,
 Spain, Morocco and Reunion are reported to have signed
 with reservations,
 12.   Section one of the main document is a lengthy
 indictment of "imperialism," with the United States
 singled out for special condemnation.   Section two de-
 scribes the three forces of world revolution:   the

 Declassified in Part -Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/30: CIA-RDP71 B00364R000100230001-1 -~X1
 Communist countries, national liberation movements, and
 the international working force.   The third section
 calls on the parties to struggle against imperialism,
 which it describes as especially rampant in Vietnam.
 It also names those familiar "imperialist threats":
 NATO, West Germany and Israel.   In the context of
 "the struggle for peace," however, this section en-
 dorses the principle of "peaceful coexistence" which
 permits a wide range of activity by the militants and
 more peacefully oriented parties.   As it did in Khru-
 shchev's formulation, the principle does not contradict
 the right of any oppressed people to fight for its
 liberation "by any means it considers necessary."   At
 the same time,  "peaceful coexistence" allows for the
 development of "fruitful" economic, scientific, and
 technical cooperation with non-Communist countries;
 and requires support of disarmament measures and the
 nuclear nonproliferation treaty,
 13.   The final section of the document on the
 relationship among the Communist parties is the short-
 est, but it proved to be the most controversial in
 the drafting process.   It argues that the community
 of Communist nations, especially the Soviet Union,
 is the decisive factor in the "anti-imperialist strug-
 gle."   It stresses that cohesion of the Communist coun-
 tries will largely determine the progress of Communism
 and the effectiveness of its efforts to combat "im-
 perialist aggression."  Above all others, this section
 shows the effect of many committee redrafting sessions.
 It defends the need for "proletarian internationalism,"
 mutual assistance and support, but it also speaks of
 the need for equality, sovereignty and noninterference
 in the affairs of other parties.   While it is explicitly
 stated that there is at present no leading center in
 the international Communist movement, special praise
 nevertheless is directed to the Soviet union as the
 main force of the movement and for its efforts on be-
 half of the Communist cause,
 Conclusion
 14.   Given the scaled-down objectives of the So-
 viets,, they probably can take satisfaction in having
 brought together 75 parties, in having produced a
 Declassified in Part -Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/30: CIA-RDP71 B00364R000100230001-1
 25 Declassified in Part -Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/30: CIA-RDP71 B00364R000100230001-1
 final document elastic enough to be signed by the
 great majority of participants, and in having put
 on the record a series of speeches that can be cited
 as evidence of "overwhelming" support for Soviet
 views, especially on China.   Moscow cannot escape
 the fact, however, that the conference show of unity
 is marred by the absence of most Asian parties, and
 that the 61 parties that signed the main document
 without reservations represent only about one third
 of the estimated number of party members in the
 world.

 MEMORANDUM
 SUBJECT:    The Effect of the Cuban Missile Crisis
 on Soviet Strategic Force Planning
 1.   In October 1962 the leaders of the USSR were
 faced by a substantial US superiority in operational
 intercontinental strategic strike force and the pro-
 spect that the margin of superiority probably would
 continue to grow for at least another two or three
 years.
 2.   Earlier--perhaps a year or more before--the
 Soviet political and military leaders had probably
 come to the view that the limited capabilities of
 their intercontinental strategic forces compared with
 those of the US would,      if not redressed, provide the
 US with a potential first strike capability.   Soviet
 defense planners in making a prudent assessment of the
 strategic balance had probably concluded that, although
 the considerable Soviet strategic forces targetted
 against western Europe provided some measure of deter-
 rence, the USSR would have no assured retaliatory
 capability with respect to the US until about 1966.   By
 the fall of 1962, the Soviet leaders were also aware
 that US intelligence collection capabilities ruled out
 reliance on bluff and bluster.
 3.   These factors probably caused deep concern in
 the Kremlin.   From the Soviet point of view, the US
 strategic posture not only posed a serious potential
 threat to the national security of the USSR, but also
 severely circumscribed Soviet foreign policy options
 ,throughout the world.   Khrushchev probably viewed the
 emplacement in Cuba of strategic systems capable of
 reaching the US as the quickest way of redressing at
 least partially the strategic imbalance.   Successfully
 carried out,  it could have other immediate political
 returns as well.   Khrushchev's Berlin objectives were
 probably closely intertwined with the over-all strategic
 goals.

 Declassified in Part -Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/30: CIA-RDP71 B00364R000100230001-1
 8.   The comparisons of forces outlined above
 illustrate the vastly inferior strategic position of
 the USSR which probably provided the major motivation
 for Khrushchev`s decision to place nuclear strike forces
 in Cuba in 1962.   It seems likely that the Soviets de-
 cided not to deploy their second generation ICBM systems--
 the SS-7 and SS-8--on a large scale not only because of
 the shortcomings of these systems, but also because a
 crash program probably would have delayed the deployment
 of their third generation ICBM systems--the SS-9 and
 SS-11.   Thus,  it appears that Khrushchev decided to de-
 ploy existing medium range systems in Cuba as a stop-gap
 measure which would quickly and cheaply improve the re-
 lative strategic position of the USSR.
 9.   The attempt to convert Cuba into a Soviet stra-
 tegic nuclear base can be interpreted as an admission of
 the inadequacy of the Soviet strategic deterrent and as
 a measure of the Soviet concern about the possible mili-
 tary and political consequences of this inadequacy.   By
 1961 the USSR probably was aware of the growing US capa-
 bility to detect and monitor Soviet strategic force
 deployments and knew that it could no longer represent
 its strategic capability as being much.greater than it
 actually was.
 10.   In addition to causing genuine apprehensions
 about the security of the USSR, the US superiority pro-
 bably was viewed by Khrushchev as a restriction on his
 political flexibility in international relations--e.g.,
 in resolving the Berlin question.   The failure of his
 bold move probably reinforced the Soviet conviction
 that the USSR could not afford the military risks and
 political penalties of, not competing with the US in a
 strategic arms race.     .

 4.   The confrontation with US strategic power in
 the Cuban crisis probably confirmed the Soviet belief
 that anything less than a rough strategic equality
 with the US would leave them vulnerable both political-
 ly and militarily.   Apparently the experience also
 persuaded the Soviet leaders that in order to avoid
 another period of strategic inferiority they would have
 to react more rapidly to future US plans for force im-
 provements.
 5.   The failure of Kirushchev `s gamble in Cuba
 probably did not alter the Soviet goal of achieving and
 maintaining a credible deterrent, but it may well have
 ,been an important factor in determining the pace, timing,
 and dimensions of the Soviet effort to build a strong
 strategic offensive capability.   The Cuban experience un-
 doubtedly provided strong support for those in the Kremlin
 who advocated large scale deployments of the SS-9,  SS-i1    25X1
 and new SLBM strategic systems then under development in
 the USSR.

 11.   A review of military programs and expenditures
 indicates that there was no abrupt redirection of Soviet
 effort immediately following the Cuban missile crisis.
 The relative stability in expenditures for strategic and
 general purpose force programs  (excluding research and
 development expenditures) during the 1963-1965 period
 suggests that the Soviets decided to wait until the ad-
 vanced systems then in development--e.g., the SS-9, the
 SS-11, and Y-class SLBM systems--would be available for
 large scale deployment to.redress the strategic imbal-
 ance                       .   The general size of the deployment for these
 systems probably was determined during this period.
 Continuation of the rapid rise in expenditures for re-
 search and development programs--which began in the
 1950's--is an indication of the Soviet determination to
 pay the price of running a strategic arms race with the
 US.   The large R&D programs undoubtedly were designed
 to provide the Soviet leadership with sufficient flexi-
 bility to fulfill their requirements for strategic forces
 under any foreseeable contingencies.
 12.   The Cuban missile crisis may have provided the
 USSR with an important lesson on the nature of a strate-
 gic.arms race.   The US reacted to the "missile gap" of
 the late 1950's with plans for major strategic programs,
 principally Minuteman and Polaris.   The USSR, however,
 did not immediately respond to the US force improvement
 plans so that by the fall of 1962 it found itself in a
 worsening strategic position.   Since the Cuban crisis,
 it appears that the USSR has attempted to anticipate the
 deployment of new US weapons systems and moved to offset
 them.
 l       13.   The expressed Soviet interest in discussing
 strategic arms limitation is probably prompted at least
 in part by their desire to preserve their current stra-
 tegic position in the face of US improvements in stra-
 tegic capabilities planned for the Seventies.   Extension
 of SS-9 and SS-11 deployment and continued Soviet ABM
 testing may represent other-Soviet responses to US plans
 I for the deployment of MIRVs and an ABM system.

 [Editorial:  "A Great International Teaching"; words in slantlines published in italics]
 [Text] Leninism is the scientific, theoretical expression of the fundamental, universal
 interests of the working class and of all workers in the modern era.  Continuing and
 developing the eaus- of ti-- founders of the scientific ideology of the proletariat,
 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engel?, Leninism consistently expresses the cherished hopes
 of the working class and of working people and corresponds profoundly and comprehensively
 to the chief questions dictated by life and modern historical development.   The cause
 of the revolutionary renewal of the world and the theory and practice of socialism
 in our day are inseparable from the name of Valdimir Ilich Lenin.

 One of the widespread methods of struggle against Leninism is denial of its international
 character and international significance and the portrayal of Leninism as   particularly
 "Russian," phenomenon, as a teaching allegedly corresponding only to Russian conditions.
 This slander of the bourgeois ideologists against scientific communism has acquired
 the force of a rooted prejudice among them; it is even  shared to this or that extent
 by certain figures callil-ir themselves socialists and even Marxists.  For example,
 Ernst Fischer's latest booklet, "What Marx Really Said," which is graphic proof of
 the author's revisionist positions and of the coincidence of his views with the ideas
 of traditional bourgeois, anti-Marxist pr paganda, asserts that Lenin, "proceeding from
 Marxist considerations,` only "adapted t    I" ieory of revolution to the problems of
 tsarist Russia" (E. Fischer,   "Was Marx;i_rklich Sagte."  Vienna, 1968, page 157).
 This book defines Leninism as the sum of the views "of that group (Bolsheviks) which
 was led by Lenin within Russian social democracy and under the leadership of which the
 1917 October revolution occurred."  (Ibid, r1Re 158).  Thus, Fischer propounds the
 ideas of the applicability of Leninism only in the background countries of the East
 with a predominance of peasant population and a>pir s to depict Leninism as one of
 the varieties and one of the trends of Marxism.
 It is common knowledge that Leninism is the Marxism:.  our day, the creative development
 of Marxist teaching applicable to the hi:s...,rical cc_,,..tions of the period of imperialism
 and the transition from capitalism to socialism on a universal scale, the theory of the
 revolutionary activity of the communist parties: in the modern era, and the theory of
 building socialism and communism.  Leninism is becoming increasingly widespread.  Ruling
 the consciousness of the masses.   It is difficult to find a place on the globe now
 where the name of Lenin would not be known--the name of the   ,eat continuer of the
 cause of Marx and Engels--where one would not see in the prir: iples of his teaching
 and in the Leninist method the key to the solution of the ur;o-nt problems of social
 development.  The international content of Marxist-Leninist teaching is determined
 primarily by the fact that it represents a theoretical generalization of the experience
 of the revolutionary struggle of the international working class and the workers of
 the entire world and of the achievements of progressive science, and that it reveals
 the general patterns of social development and arms the working class and all workers
 of the globe with a mighty weapon of struggle for the victory of socialism and communism,
 It would be absurd to consider Marxism "a West European doctrine" simply because its
 founders lived in West Europe.  Naturally, in creating their theory of social development,
 the founders of scientific socialism --lied primarily on the experience of the most advanced
 countries of the 19th century from the   ew       of the level of social life and the
 revolutionary process.  At the sam  time, Ivforx and Engels made a profound study of
 and generalized universal history and the aggregate international experience of the
 revolutionary movement and took the gains of progressive science and culture into
 consideration.  This made it possible forthem to accomplish an extremely great change
 in man's social consciousness and to reveal the objective laws of the historical process,
 outside which it is impossible to understand the specific features of the development
 of individual countries.  Russia, to where the center of the revolutionary movement
 was transferred at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries by force of
 objective causes, became  the motherland of Leninism.  However, it would be absurd to
 consider Leninism a peculiarly "Russian" teaching on this basis.  In creatively
 developing Marxism, V.I. Lenin was  -bided by profound research into social relations
 not only in Russia but in the dove_:oped capitalist countries of West Europe and. the
 United States, and he studied and generalized the new processes in the Asian countries
 and the experience of the international working class and national liberation movements
 and the achievements of progressive science.

 Leninist ideas exert the most profound influence on the entire course of world develop-
 ment.  Lenin's name has become the symbol of proletarian  revolutions and of socialism
 and progress and the symbol of the communist transformation of the world.
 In the struggle for the victory of communism, and constantly imbibing strength to
 inspiration from Leninist ideas, the communist parties,--loyal to the principles
 of proletarian internationalism-- the workers of all countries and continents and the
 working people of all nations and peoples, color of skin, and race express feelings
 of boundless love and respect for Ilich and ascribe their best thoughts and
 aspirations to him.  The theory and method of Leninism has been confirmed comprehensively
 by historical practice.  Consideration of Marxist-Leninist teaching, comprehensive
 generalization of the practical experience of the revolutionary struggle and socialist
 building and of the achievements of modern scientific knowledge, and on this basis
 further creative development of theory--this is the law of action of all true
 revolutionaries and all Marxist-Leninists.
 Leninism, which has an international dharacter--the ideological foundation of inter-
 national unity and the brotherhood of the workers and their joint struggle against
 imperialism and for socialism and communism--obliges all communists to give a crushing
 rebuff to any revisionist sallies in whatever form and wherever they may manifest
 themselves.  This is natural, for when it is a question of the principles of Marxism-
 Leninism, of the international ideological property of the working class, and re-
 volutionary theory, there are no and cannot be any "indifferent" communists.  The
 meaning and significance of any philosophical teaching and of any sociopolitical
 doctrine are determined by their contribution to the general progressive development
 -f knowledge and by the extent and nature of their influence on social life. Leninism
 bias passed a comprehensive historical test in the very midst of mass historical
 movements, firmly entering the consciousness and the flesh and blood of the peoples
 and of hundreds of millions of people.  The most outstanding revolutionary achievements
 ?f the 20th century are connected with Leninism.--the Great October Socialist Revolution,
 which marked a fundamental change in the history of mankind, the complete and conclusive
 victory of socialism in the USSR. the formation of the world socialist system, and the
 magnificent social and national liberation battles and victories over capitalism won
 by the working class and the workers.   Marxism-Leninism has become the ruler of the
 minds of all progressive mankind and the reliable compass of scientific knowledge and
 the revolutionary confirmation of the new, higher forms of social order.
 For this very reason the bourgeois and the rlghtwing socialist ideologists are aspiring
 to belittle and emasculate the scientific content of Leninism and to put. their own
 "interpretation" on it.  The anticommunists are aware that in the middle of the
 e')th century it is no longer possible to reject scientific sociili`sm'out of hand and
 t  oppose Marxist-Leninist teaching openly.  Hence their attempts to find "contradictions"
 in the integral theory of Marxism-Leninism, to split up Its component parts and various
 -rages of development artifically and to counterpose them to one another.  A
 ..~nsiderable army of bourgeois ideologists--from the Trotskiyite S. Hook and the
 professional. anticommunist A. Meyer to the official American sociologist W. Rostow,
 Gather J. Bochenski, and the Jesuit A. (Shambra)  as transliterated 3--are concerned
 c?~unterpose Marx to Lenin.  They are leaning over backward, attempting to "prove"
 f-nat the ideology of modern communism is not only not related to the authentic views
 ;.f Marx, but is a "radical distortion of true Marxism."  Revisionists of various
 stripes have chimed in actively in this numerically strong choir of outspoken`
 bourgeois ideologists.  Acting on behalf of "true scientific communism," they are
 preverting and discrediting the great Marxist-Leninist teaching, theory, and practice
 of scientific communism. Here the enemies of scientific communism are concentrating
 tie fire of their criticism against Lenin and against Leninism.

 Marxist-Lenin1sts there can be no doubting the truth of the fact that the defense of
 the fundamental principles of the proletariat's scientific ideology and its subse-
 quent, development in accordance with r'ew historical conditions represents a single
 process.  The very formulation of the question of the possibility of breaking down
 this process--ovren more so that of the counterposition of its elements--is a false
 and artificial problem.  Unfortunately, a number of authors who consider themselves
 Marxists are .conducting an extremely fauitless discussion as to what is most important
 the preservation of the purity of theory, or its development.
 One has only to submit to this metapkbys'.cal formulation of the question, and any answer
 to it is ddomed in advance to one-sidedness fraught with incorrect political and
 theoretical.  conclusions. historical. expel,:':ince shows that any underestimation of the
 necessity to observe the principles of revolutionary theory, the ngcessity to protect
 them against any distortions, loads to a "ccreative" development of Marxism-Leninism
 in which its very essence is emasculated.  Te,principles and, method of scientific
 communism have been verified and corroborated by historical expos'iences,  In emphasis
 zing the se*ientIfic substantiation of Marxist teaching, as far back as the ehd of the
 last centuryV.I. Lenin said that this had been demonstrated strikingly since the time
 of the appearance of "Dams Kapital," when on the basis of the dialectical materialist
 method a profound scientific analysis of tie structure and development of the capitalist
 formation was made.   Now the correctness of scientific communism has been confirmed
 by the entire experience of the period of ~;c:>ansition from capitalism to socialism and
 the experience of the development of the world socialist system and the new socioeco-
 nomt:c formation.  Al]. the successes of the world communist movement were made possible
 by the fact that its path was illumina,id by proven Maracjst-Leninist, theory, reliably
 guarding against a possible descent to the positions of reformism and leftist
 revolut.ionar?,im.
 The great Lenin taught that without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary
 movement.  Xn all their activity the QP,SU and the fraternal parties, adhering to the
 principles of proleta.?ian international ism,  are  guided by the single doctrine of
 Marxism-Leninism.  Marxism-Leninism represents an integrated and harmonious system of
 scientific principles and conclusions; it is a monolithic teaching which must constantly
 guard itself both against attempts at reformist "softening" and against nationalist
 and "leftwing"-opportunist, dogmatic distortion.  Marxism's theoretical principles,
 which constitute the indestructible bads of the entire domestic and foreign policies
 of the communist party and the socialist state and the scientific foundation of
 socialism and communism, were defended indefatigably by V.I. Lenin.  Let us recall,
 for example, his ardent speech against the Second International's opportunist theoreti-
 eaLans? who distorted the Marxist ideas on the state, revolution, 4n                             he dictatorship
 of the proletariat, and against the Trc tskiyites and rightwing opportuni$ts in our
 countr^yo
 The necessity for the defense of the fundamental principles of Leninism is felt
 particularly sharply now.  Many extrenvily important theoretical tenets of scientific
 communism--on the+-proletariat's historic mission, on the dictatorship of the proletar-
 iat and the communist party's leading a',l(, In the revolution and socialist building,
 on proletarian internationalism, on the content and tethods of building a new society,
 and others--have become the object of persistent attacks by bourgeois and revisionist
 ideologists, endeavoring in one way or another to emasculate the very principles of
 Marxism-Leninism.  In these attacks the reformist ideologists generally speculate
 on the natural necessity to take new conditions into consideration, although it is
 perfectly obvig)us that a comprehensive generalizatioia of new phenomena of scientific
 knowledge and accial practiat is only possible tro  Marxist-Leninist positions.

 All this explains why Leninism, which took shape in the bitter struggle on the
 international scene against the dogma:: of the theoreticians of the Second International
 and against rigntwing and "leftwinf,? opportunism, became  the banner of the world
 working class movement in the era of the downfall of capita-ism and ti.e transition
 to socialism and communism.
 V.I. Lenin studied the development of capita-is.: not only in Russia, although by
 analyzing the contradictions of Russian reality he showed that their characteristic
 features are in principle inherent in the entire capitalist system.  On the basis of
 a profound study of the trends of social development on a universal scale and of
 an analysis and generalization of the enormous factual material of the leading
 bourgeois countries, V.I. Lenin revealed the essence of imperialism as the highest
 and final stage of capitalism and also its features and natural patterns.  Guided by
 the ideas of Marx and Engels and the practical experience of the Soviet state, V.I.
 Lenin: gave a Comprehensive substantiation to the p-tterns of the formation of the
 communist socioeconomic formation.
 Leninism is a new, higher stage in the development of Marxism and all its integral
 parts:   Its philosophy, political economy, and scientific communism.  V.I. Lenin
 developed and specified the most important ideas of Marxism on the leading role of
 the working class and its revolutionary port and on the dictatorship of the proletariat.
 V.I. Lenin enriched and specified the Marxist theory of revolution, drew a conclusion
 about the possibility of the victory of socialism initially in a few or even in one
 country alone, formulated the theory of the development of the bourgeois-democratic
 revolution into a socialist revolution, and developed the idea of the combination
 of the proletarian revolution with the national liberation struggle.   V.I. Lenin
 revealed the natural patterns and principal features of the transitional period
 from capitalism to socialism and formulated the principal problems of building
 socialism and communism.   Leninism is the property not of a single country, but of
 the entire international liberation movement,  Under the banner of Marx:.sm-Leninism
 an enormous period of world development has passed which cannot be ignored and even less,
 excluded from world history.
 In their time Kautsky,  0. Bauer, and other socialist renegades in the West and the
 Trotskiyites in Russia mode fierce attacks on Leninism, attempting to represent it as
 a product of Russian "backwardness" and peasant narrowmindedness, as a theory allegedly
 unsuitable for the developed capitalist countries.  In opposition tothe socia- reformist
 and Trotsklyite views, and in the course of a principled ideological struggle with them,
 the world communist movement has provided comprehensive grounds showing that the
 proletariat's scientific world outlook is a single, integral teaching formulated by
 Marx and Engels and subsequently developed comprehensively under the new historical
 conditions by V.I. Lenin.
 In our day scientific communism is being developed creatively by the CPSU and the
 other Marxist-Leninist parties.  Leninism today is the combat banner and the guide
 to action of hundreds of millions of people creating a new life and fighting for peace,
 freedom, Independence, and socialism.  Marxism-Leninism is the inexhaustible ideological
 wealth of the present-day communist movement.  At the same time Marxist-Leninists do
 not regard their teaching as something invariable and ossified.  The creative essence
 of Marxism-:.,eninism and its revolutionary core--dialectics--are aimed atta timely comprehension
 of new phenomena and processes in accordance with changing objective conditions.
 The further creative enrichment of Leninism is effected by the collective efforts of
 the world communist movement.  However, this development does not proceed apart from
 the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, but is accomplished on their pasis.

 awareness into the workers of the socialist society.  The CPSU is making an important
 contribution to resolving the urgent problems of present-day world development and of
 the international communist and workers movement.
 One example of the struggle against Leninism in our time is the slanderous accusation
 that it is of a "dogmatic" character.       Those who hold these views propose that the
 "closed" (they have in mind class and party) character of Leninism must be overcome
 and transformed into some kind of "opek" or "general" (that is, supraclass]doctrine.
 Bourgeois and revisionist ideologists are of" the opinion that only this kind of
 manipulation is capable or insuring the so:_;,ific character and authenticity of the
 proletariat's ideology,  Although there ..re certain differences in the views of
 propagandists of "opene? Marxism-Leninism, they  are united in. their offensive
 againtt'the fundamental principles of Marxism-LEEninism.and against its  precise
 class bases.
 Communist Party spirit is a most important princlpl~ of Marxist-Leninist ideology,
 a principle that conditions its strength and effect   ness.  Scientific communism
 appeals directly and immediately to the working cla.  and to all workers, expresses
 their real interests, and shows the way to the revo., ionary transformation of
 society.  To what other social forces must elarxism-".. nism be "opened?"  It is politi-
 cally naive to count on symiithy from the exploiter ola.sses.  The popularity of and
 the degree to which an ideological system is speead among this or that social group
 or class depend primarily on the ideology=s social meaning and objectives and on how
 completely it expresses their real interests.  Mai?xism-Leniniapc is the militant
 revolutionary teaching of the working class and of ~.ll worker~ll and its whole
 existence is aimed at the revolutbtonary  overthrow of the bourgeoisiets
 domination and at the destruction of each and every kind of e,eploitation and repression.
 On the other hand  the ideology of the exploiter classes is siarply directed at Sup-
 pression of the working masses and it serves the cause of justifying exploiatation,
 Here is its scoial purpose, its class objective, and its party spirit,  Therefore, th
 clash between communist and bourgois ideologies is an expression of ,the elassbtrugg e
 in the world arena and of the struggle by the proletariat and all working people for
 the liquidation of exploiter relationships, the struggle for the social and national
 liberation of the peoples.  As it is impossible to reconcile opposing classes and
 eliminate the antagonism between them, so too it is impossible to effect a
 synthesis of mutually opposed classes.  Since the struggle for the minds and hearts
 of men is one of the basic forms of the class struggle, there can be no compromise,
 V.I. Lenin wrote,   "People always have !en   ,,z always will be the foolish victims
 of deceit and self-deception until they .ieu,:i to seek out the interests of this or
 that class are behind the moral, religious, political, and social phrases,
 statements, and promises" (Complete Collected Works, Vol 23, p 47).
 The class interests  of the present-day imperialist bourgeoisie condition the
 tendentious, false, and mystifying character of its ideology.  The fundamental
 divergence between the interests of the bourgeoisie--a historically doomed class--
 and the objective requirements of social progress prompt the theoreticians of imperialism
 to misinterpret reality and distort the real trends of its development.   On the
 other hand Marxism-Leninism is the scientific ideology of the working class, which
 is interested in a strictly object: 1e analysis of reality, in the liquidation of an
 form of social injustice, and in t::v cohesion of all democratic forces for a bright
 future.

 Marxist-Leninists are enjoined to defend and protect these positions and to guard
 revolutionary theory resolutely and uncompromisingly against revisionist, reformist,
 and dogmatic distortions and the incorporation into it of all kinds of ideological
 substitutes purporting to be the "latest achievements" of scientific thought.
 The stanch defense of Marxist-Leninist principles inherently entails the need and
 ability to apply and develop revolutionary theory creatively.  V/I. Lenin's activity
 represents a model of the genuinely creative enrichment of theory
 Lenin liked to say that K. Marx's principal work, "Das Kapital," was the result of the
 study of real processes, of a wealth of facts; the same can also be said Of other
 4orks by Marxism's founders.  Indeed, this applies fully to the works of V:I. Lenin,
 who relied constantly on a meticulous analysis of social reality, the generalization
 of revolutionary practice in the imperialist period, and the practice of socialist
 building.  Leninism's Strictly scientific method is profoundly hostile to the
 revisionists' constructions which are divorced from life, a distortion of reality,
 and speculative.
 "irelessly struggling to preserve Marxism's purity and liberating it  from foul
 -;ppcrtunism, V.I. Lenin not only reinstated Marx's and Engels' true views, but also
 developed them creatively  in complete accordance with the new, specific conditions
 and with the achievements of science and social practice.  It was precisely in this
 way that he formulated the integrated teaching of the new type of proletarian party,
 enriched the Marxist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist
 state, and developed the teaching on the strategy and tactics of the proletariat's
 class struggle  on the alliance between the working class and the peasantry in the
 revolutionary struggle; the ways of creating a socialist economy; the content and
 .-r.ethods of the cultural revolution; and the ways of building socialism and communism.
 Marxist-Leninist ideology is linked inseparably with life, with the practice of build-
 ing socialism and communism, and with the struggle of the international working class
 -ra  =f all workers and oppressed peoples for their social and national liberation.
 :.pity of theory and practice, a creative appraoch to theory, consideration of changing
 circumstances, and the ability to generalize new phenomena--herein lie the fundamental
 -haracteristics of Leninism--the theoretical basis for the solution of the most
 complex questions of the revolutionary struggle and the building of a new society.
 The CPSU Central Committee resolutions  on the preparations for Vladimir Ilich
 Lenin's birth centenary" emphasises that "the unfading active force of V.I. Lenin's
 ideas consists precisely In his creative development of Marxism.  The Leninist
 attitude to theory combined in itself revolutionary creativity and loyalty to the
 principles of Marxism and the connection of theory With life and revolutionary
 practice."
 This Leninist tradition is continued by all Marxist-Leninists.  Taking into account
 oa specific character of the different countries, Marxist-Leninists throughout the
 t,.or-ld are developing and improving collectively a single and integral Marxist-Leninist
 theory.
 r?ollawing Lenin's principles and creatively generalizing Marxist-Leninist theory,
 the CPSU shows the Soviet people the way to the victory of communism.  In revealing
 the regu.;ar law-governed development from socialism to communism, the party has
 ubstantiated the primary significance of creating the material-technical base
 -f communism which insures the  victory or the new system, has developed scientific
 t.r-incipiaS for the organization and control of the national economy at Its present stage

 The anti-Marxist fabrication that Leninism is only suitable for economically
 undeveloped countries is refuted graphically by life.  These days any unprejudiced
 person can see that Leninism, its revolutionary theory, its strategy, and its
 tactical principles are suitable andobligatory for the fraternal parties of all
 countries, taking their specific conditions into account.
 It is well known that communists are --!ways in favor of the comprehensive consideration
 of the specific circumstances of one country or another and of their social,
 economic, and cultural traditions and conditions and against the mechanical
 transference of the experience of certain countries to others.  It stands to
 reason that one cannot replace this Marxist-Leninist attitude with the idea of
 the necessity fdr creating "a new variant of Marxism" for this or that country,
 for Marxism-Leninism is a single system of scientific views expressing laws of
 social development which are common to all countries and peoples and the whole
 of mankind.  There cannot be Chinese, Russian, or Yugoslav Marxism.  To assert
 such a thing would mean surrendering to oblivion theinternational essence of
 Marxism-Leninism and the universal significance of Marxist-Leninist theory and
 adopting the position of nationalistic ideology.  Let us remember how passionately
 V.I. Lenin opposed those who strove to "tear" socialism "asunder" into "national
 compartments" and how hewarned against nationalistic distortions which cause
 colossal damage to the interests of the world socialist revolution.
 The following fact is graphic evidence of the pertinence of these warnings of Lenin1s.
 As everyone knows, Mao Tse-tung began with the absolutization and dogmatization
 of Chinese experience, counterposing it to the revolutionary experience of other
 peoples.  Thus he tried to give substantiation to Chinas particular path to
 revolution and to its ideological expression--"Sinicized Marxism."  It could be shown
 originally that it was a question of applying Marxism to specific Chinese
 conditions.  However, with the passage of time it became clear that under the
 flag of "Sinicized Marxism" Mao Tse-tung and his group had embarked on the road of
 anti-Sovietism and  great-power chauvinism.  Matters even reached the point of
 armed provocations by the Chinese authorities on the Soviet-Chinese border, which
 seriously damage the cause of socialism. andpeace, the common front of the anti-
 imper-alist struggle, and the. friendship of the Soviet and Chinese peoples.
 Our people constantly nurture feelings of respect and friendship for the great
 Chinese people.  They are firmly convinced that in the final analysis the difficulties
 in Soviet-Chinese .r.1atons will be overcome.  The Soviet people are confident of the
 very great power o.L pr.,le.tarian internationalism, which expresses the vital interests
 of the peoples of a_i countries.  Naturally, every couhtry'whieh is guided by a
 Marxist-Leninist par :y will contribute something new to the forms and methods of
 socialist transformations.  The practice of the socialist countries has enriched
 and specified the concept of the general natural laws, forms, and methods of
 socialist building and has shown the rich, complex, and multiform nature of the
 formation and development of a new system under one set or another of historically-
 specific conditions.  The time taken for solvine:socialist'tasks and especially
 for the formation of mature socialism having the appropriate material and technical
 base and developed social relationships is not uniform for different countries;
 it depends considerably upon the socioeconomic level at which the socialist
 transformations begin.  But the basic natural laws for building and organ izing
 socialist life are common to all.  This is acknowledged by all Marxist-Leninists
 and is recorded in the declaration and statement of the 1957 and 1960 conferences
 of representatives of communist and workers parties.

 I-I.   9 May 69                                 A 19              USSR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
 The very nature of the working class--the wave of the future--a class whose interests
 coincide completely with the objective course of social development--conditions its
 interests in a true, all-round, and deep recognition of reality and in accelerating
 social progress.  Only with a scientific understanding of the objective laws of
 history is It possible to implement the worldwide historic mission of the working
 class--the overthrow of the final exploiter system and the building of a new society
 on wise and just principles--and to direct grandiose construction consciously in all
 spheres of human activity under socialism and communism.  Thus, any attempt to find
 social truth outside Leninism is a fruitless undertaking that has nothing in common
 with the interests of working people or of socialism and communism.  The theoretical
 treasure house of Marxism-Leninism as a single international teaching is open to all
 the modern achievements of progressive scientific thought and to all Marxist-Leninist
 parties, each one of which makes its own theoretical contribution on the basis of its
 own experience in the revolutionary struggle.  However, there are bourgeois and
 revisionist theoreticians who by hiding behind their demands for "openness" in Leninism,
 try to change it into a conglomeration of different ideas and concepts borrowed from
 the antiscientific social and philosophical doctrines that exist in our time.  Those
 who love to introduce into Marxism-Leninism views and proposals alien to it suppose
 that in this way they are insuring the "up-to-dateness" of Leninism,
 Of course, Marxist-Leninists are constantly analyzing 'theoretically and generalizing
 the greatest achievements of science and technology and the process of present-day
 social development.  Marxist-Leninists also reveal what new phenomena of social science
 and practice are being subjected to analysis and, moreover, falsification by the
 bourgeois thinkers.  Here Marxist-Leninists have waged and are waging an implacable
 struggle against the attempts of revisionist authors to replace Marxism-Leninism with
 an eclectic hodge-podge made up of the latest "achievements" of reactionary bourgeois
 philosophy, sociology, political economy, and legal and other concepts.  And the
 attempts in this direction are being undertaken relatively intrusively by the
 revisionists.  Periodically schemes are proposed which are calculated to cause a
 sensation among people who are unexacting in the theoretical and political sense:  To
 "supplement" Marxism-Leninism with abstract humanism, to replace the materialistic
 understanding of history with a "systemo-structural approach," to uncritically introduce
 into scientific communism sociological concepts, methods, and research principles, and
 so forth which have been borrowed from bourgeois theoreticians.
 Such an interpretation of the "openness" of the theory is rejected resolutely by
 Marxist-Leninists; the theory of Marxism-Leninism is /closed,/ categorically and forever,
 to all enemies of Leninism, whether they stand openly on the bourgeoisie's positions, or
 whether they hide behind socialist phraseology.  Any weakening, any yielding to the
 ideological enemies of scientific socialism would be fraught with losses for Leninist
 revolutionary theory--the greatest ideological asset of the international working class.
 These days even many bourgeois figures have been forced to admit that socialism,
 created on the foundation of Marxist-Leninist theory insures accelerated economic and
 cultural development for all countries which embarked on its path, regardless of
 whether in the past they were at the stage of capitalism or precapitalism.  All this,
 in its turn, predetermined the enormous effect of world socialism on the course of
 social development and the growth of the communist, workers, and national liberation
 movements.  And now the veritable nature of the theory of Marxism-Leninism has been
 proved in the experience of many nations, large and small, living in various parts of
 the earth and the general natural laws governing the formation and development of
 socialist society have been elucidated.

 Those actions were directed toward defense of socialist Czechoslovakia's national

 of world socialism and in waging a 4ptermined struggle against imperialism and on
 behalf of the basic interests of the working people.  The international conference
 of communist and workers parties, which opens in. Moscow on 5 June, is destined to be
 an important milestone in the mobilization of the popular masses for a more active
 and effective struggle against imperial .sm.  The recent session of the working group
 for preparation of the draft documents for the forthcoming conference and discussion
 in the preparatory commission of the draft of the main document for the conference
 showed the firm desire of communists of all continents for comradely cooperation and
 again demonstrated the growing aspiration of the communist and workers parties toward
 cohesiveness in the struggle against imperi-alism and on behalf of common aims on
 the principled basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.
 The course of preparations for the forthcoming conference shows that, given a sincere
 striving toward cooperation, even the most ,,omplex questions can be solved, and this
 is what the vital interests of the broadest popular masses imperatively demand.
 The objective community of interests of the communist parties and all ranks of the
 world revolutionary movement are stronger than those factors causing disagreement
 and divergence.  The condition for the coming victory of the international communist
 movement is loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and to the ideas of the recognized leader of
 the world proletariat, V.I.  Lenin, who made a enormous contribut on. to formulating
 the communist movement's strategy and tacti-,s.  Lenin raised high the banner of
 internationalism and educated communists and all working people in the spirit of
 ,international solidarity.    With his characteristic revolutionary passion V.I. Lenin
 fought opportunism, adventurism, and narion.lism in the international workers move-
 ment and warned the communist parties of the danger of nationalist and revisionist
 ideology and policy for the fate of the revolution and socialism.
 Recalling their leader's behests, Marxieit-Leninists of all countries are striving to
 strengthen the 'unity of their ranks on the basis of proletarian internationalism.

 2. When an attempt by the enemy, or by the Party, to advance by
 violent means has failed, the. conditions for an effective agreement
 between the Party and the enemy come into existence.
 In 1920, Lenin said :
 . . . every attempt to start war on us will mean for the states
 resorting to war that the terms they will get after and as a result
 of the war will be worse than those that they could have got with-
 out war or before war. This bas been proved in the case of several
 states. .   . And thanks to this our relations with neighboring
 states are steadily improving.. . . Peace on such a basis has
 every chance of being . . . durable. . .. e
 3. The Party must always expect outside groups to violate agree-
 men ts.
 In 1920, Lenin said about the policy of granting economic
 "concessions" to foreign entrepreneurs:
 Of course, the capitalists will not fulfill the agreements, say the
 comrades who fear concessions. That is a matter of course, one
 must absolutely not hope that the capitalists will fulfill the agree-
 ments??
 These attitudes imply that a "settlement" with the Western Powers-
 that is, an agreement sharply reducing the threat of mutual annihila-
 tion-is inconceivable to the Politburo, although arrangements with
 them, codifying the momentary relationship of forces, are always
 considered.

 SOME SOVIET TECHNIQUES OF NEGOTIATION*
 By Philip E. Mosely
 (I'roft'ssr,r  of International Relations and  Director  of the
 Yurnpean Institute. ('ohunbiat University, former Ulrexetor, Rus~:ian
 Institute. Columbia university)
 There is a deep-seated tradition in western diplomacy that an Wee-
 the diploluatt, should he a two-way interpreter. Ile must present his
 own ,roves?nmellt's policy forcefully to the government to which he is
 accredited and defend the essential interests of his country. If he is to
 give intelligent advice to his government. he must also develop it keen
 insight into the policies of the government witth which he deals and
 become skilled in distinguishing basic interests and sentiments which
 it cannot disregard from secondary ones which it may adjust or limit
 for the broader purpose of reaching agreement. Occasionally, as in-
 stanced by Woodrow Wilson's criticism of Walter Mines Page, it has
 seemed as if individual ambassadors become too much penetrated by
 the viewpoint and interests of the country to which they were sent and
 less able to press contrary views of their own governiiients.
 No such problem of delicate balance in functions arises to plague
 the Soviet negotiator. This has been especially true since the great
 purge of the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs in 19:8-:9 and the
 replacement of Litvinov by .lfolotov in 1939. The new foreign affairs
 stall' was recruited among the iniddle ranks of Soviet officials, whose
 entire training had been based on rigid adherence to centralized deei-
 sions and who had rarely had inforliial contacts with life outside the
 Soviet, Union. The present-day Soviet representative can hardly be
 called a ``negotiator" in the custoniarv sense. Ile is rather treated is a
 nteclianical mouthpiece for views and demands formulated centrally
 in 'Nlostxv, and is deliberately isolated from the impact of views, in-
 terests and sentiments which influence foreign governments anti peo-
 ples. Probably the Soviet representative abroad, through fear of heinrr
 accnsetl of "frilling captive to imperialist and cosmopolitan influences,"
 serves as a block to the transmission of foreign views and sentiments,
 rather than as a channel for coniniunit?ating them to his igoverli-

 revolution, during which our objective is the overthrow of the
 international bourgeoisie. .   . We shah witness a succession of
 ebbs and flows in the revolutionary tide. For the time being the
 international revolutionary movement is in the declining phase;
 but . . . this decline will yield    . to an upward surge which
 may in the victory of the world proletariat. If, however, it should
 not end in victory, another decline will set in, to be followed in
 its turn by yet another revolutionary surge. Our defeatists main-
 tain that the present ebb in 1 he revolutionary tide marks the end
 of the revolution. They are iiuistaken now just as heretofore . . .
 the revolution does not develop along a straight, continuous and
 upwardly aspiring line but along a zigzag path . . . an ebb and
 flow in the tide, . . .1i
 In 1927, Stalin said:
 The fact that the Chinese revolution has not resulted in direct
 victory over imperialism, this fact cannot have decisive signifi-
 cance for the perspective of the revolution. Great popular revolu-
 tions never win through to the end on their first appearance. They
 grow and strengthen these elves by ebbs and flow. So it was
 everywhere, and in Russia too. So it will be in China''
 That is, major successes are often preceded by repeated failures: "We
 know that the transition front capitalism to socialism involves an
 extremely difficult struggle. But we are prepared. . . . to make a thou-
 sand attempts : having made a thousand attempts we shall go on to
 the next attempt." ".  . we shall act as we did in the Red Army:
 they may beat us a hundred times, but the hundred and first time
 we shall beat them all." "Not one of the problems that we have had
 to solve could be solved at one stroke; we had to make repeated
 attempts to solve them. Having suffered defeat, we tried again.. . . "
 2. It is not possible to predict how strong an "ebb" will be, and
 how long it will last.
 3. To achieve a major advance or final victory requires a length of
 time commensurate to the historical importance of these events :
 "    the aim . . . [of the Party I is radically to transform the con-
 ditions of life of the whole of humanity, and . .. for that reason
 it, is not permissible to be 'disturbed' by the question of the duration
 of the work."
 4. A Bolshevik must always control any tendency to act inexpedi-
 ently after a setback : ".  . a Marxist must be able to reckon with
 the most complicated and fantastic zigzag leaps of history. . .  ."
 "Whatever the . . . vicissitudes of the struggle may be, however many
 partial zigzags it may be necessary to overcome (and there will be
 very many of them-we see from experience what tremendous twists
 the history of the revolution is making . . .), in order not to get lost
 in these zigzags and twists of history . . . in the periods of retreat,
 retirement or temporary defeat,, or when history, or the enemy, throws
 us back . . . the . . . correct tiling is not to cast out the old basic
 programs.". . .
 1. The Party must never show "adventurism" in its attempts to
 advance; that is, it must never risk already conquered major positions
 for the sake of uncertain further gal us.

 14            THE SOVIET APPROACH TO NEGOTIATION
 On January 20, 1918, Len in said:
 It would be a quite Impermissible tactic to risk the already
 begun socialist revolution in Russia simply because of the hope
 that the German revolution will break out in a very short time. in
 a few weeks. Such a tactic would be adventurist. We have no right
 to assume such a risk.'"
 On January 24, 1918, Lenin discussed the proposal that
 war against Germany should be resumed in order to
 maximize the chances of the German revolution :
 But Germany is still only pregnant with revolution, while with us
 a perfectly healthy child has already seen the light of the world.
 a child which we may kill by beginning the war." .. .
 1. 'Mastery in the skill of retreating is as necessary as mastery in the
 skill of advancing.
 In 1922, Lenin said:
 When It was necessary-according to the objective situation in
 Russia as well as the whole world-to advance, to attack the enemy
 with supreme boldness, rapidity, decisiveness, we did so attack.
 When it will be necessary, we will know how to do this again and
 again. . . . And when, in the spring of 1021, it appeared that the
 advance guard of the revolution was threatened by the danger of
 becoming isolated from the mass of the people ... then we resolved
 unanimously and firmly to retreat. And for the past year we have in
 general retreated In revolutionary order. Proletarian revolutions
 will not be able to fulfill their tasks without combining the skill
 in ... attack  with  the skill  in  retreating in revolutionary
 order.'. .. .
 1. Any agreements between the Party and outside groups must. be
 regarded as aiding the future liquidation of these groups and as bar-
 riers a ainst the liquidation of the Party by them. Thus," 'Reformism,'
 ,the policy of agreenietit' and ` particular agreements' are different mat-
 ters . . . with the Mew     -s agreements are transformed into a
 system, into a policy of agreement, while with the Bolsheviks only;
 particular concrete agreements are acceptable, and are not made into a
 policy of agreement."
 Thereforethere is no essential difference between coming to an osten-
 sibly amicable arrangement with an outside group or using Violence
 against, it; they are both tactics in an over-all strategy of attack.
 In 1920, Lenin said, with reference to Soviet plans for
 granting economic "concessions" to foreign entrepre-
 neurs:
 The major theme of my speech will be the proof of two points,
 namely, first, that every war is the continuation of the policy con-
 ducted in peace, only by other means; second, that the conces-
 sions which we grant, which we are forced to grant, are the con-
 tinuation of war in another force, by other means. .  . It would
 be a great mistake to believe that a peaceful agreement about
 concessions is-a peaceful agreement with capitalists. This agree-
 ment is equivalent to war... .

 In opening negotiations with any Soviet representatives except Stalin
 the first problem is to discover whether the representatives have any
 instructions at all. To discover ii-hat those instructions, if any, are
 requires sitting out the whole course of the negotiation, with its de-
 mands, insults, and rigidities and its always uncertain outcome . .. .
 Soviet experts and diplomats caimot participate in an informal day-
 to-day exchange of information, comments and tentative recommenda-
 tions concerning policy. Until Moscow has sent. instructions they can
 say nothing at all., for they may ia-il to express the exact nuance of
 thinking or intention which has not. yet been formulated at the center,
 and transmitted to them. After  Moscow has spoken they can only
 repeat the exact formulation given- to them, and no variation may be
 introduced into it unless Moscow has sent the necessary further in-
 structions. The "western" habit of continuous negotiation is baffling to
 the Soviet diplomats, who cannot undFarstand that their western col-
 leagues have both the opportunity and the responsibility for present-
 ing and even advocating policies within their own governmental
 operations and that, within a broadly agreed pattern of interests and
 purposes, they have considerable leeway in finding the most effective,
 and usually informal, methods of influencing their "opposite num-
 bers" in foreign. ministries or ernb~cssies .. . .
 The important network of in Formal communication among the
 "western" powers, as well as the moderate latitude given to their repre-
 sentatives, makes for a swift pace of negotiation which arouses bewil-
 derment and suspicion among their Soviet colleagues. Since western
 foreign ministries are receiving daily a flow of confidential comment
 on foreign views and intentions, they are forearmed with current anal-
 yses and can often ive necessary decisions rapidly. "Western" diplo-
 mats also have a substantial latitude to work out agreed positions and
 drafts, at least on secondary and procedural matters. Thus, their minor
 differences are often resolved with wh at seems to their Soviet colleagues
 like suspicious speed.
 Not believing in or not unders#andi n g the system of informal com-
 munication and limited individual latitude, the Soviet representatives
 readily fall back on the theory of "A merican dictation." It is easier for
 then to assert that the United States government has exerted political,
 military and financial pressure to force its will upon other governments
 than to take the trouble to analyze the. complex and, to them, unfamiliar
 and unbelievable system of informal communication which usually lies
 behind the "automatic majorities" assembled around United States
 proposals. They are incredible when told that such pressure is exerted
 only rarely and that more often agreement is reached through give-
 and-take of views, by which no side gets its full position and each gets
 a part of it.
 Sometimes the sole instructions with which a Soviet delegation en-
 ters a conference are that it is not to commit itself to anything or sign
 anything. . . . In some negotiations it became clear, after delivery by

 is              THE  SOVIET APPROACH TO NEGOTIATION
 Ilti far the most frequent situation is one in which the Soviet negotia-
 tors are bound by detailed instructions rigidly pressed. Each point. at
 issue, large or small, then becomes a test of will and nerves. Instead of
 striving t4i reduce the number of points of friction and to isolate and
 diminish the major conflicts of interest, the Soviet negotiator often
 appears to his exasperated "western" colleague to take pride in finding
 the maximum number of disputes and in dwelling; on each of them to
 the full. Even during the wartime period of relative cooperation it
 was noticeable that each decision to convene a three-power conference
 was followed by the piling up of disputes and grievances, as well as
 by the rapid fabrication of Soviet accomplished facts. Thus the decision
 to hold the Yalta Conference was followed swiftly by the unilateral
 Soviet recognition of the Lublin Committee as the legitimate govern-
 ment of Poland. While arrangements were being made to hold the
 Potsdam Conference, at which Poland's territorial gains in the west
 would presumably be determined by three-power decision, the Soviet
 goarernnient proceeded to turn over to Polish administration a large
 part of the Soviet zone This action was, of course, all assertion of the
 Soviet Union's exclusive role in eastern Europe, in disregard of a
 political agreement to determine the western boundary of Poland
 jointly, and in violation of the three-power agreement defining the
 zones of occupation in Germany.
 The closely related technique of playing up grievances was also well
 illustrated at Potsdam. Bitter and prolonged Soviet attacks upon the
 presence of British troops in Greece, the Dodecanese, Syria and Leb-
 auaon took up much time and energy. When the western negotiators
 had been worn down by these wrangles the Soviet negotiators could
 fare with greater equanimity the American and especially the British
 protests against the brutal assertion of Soviet hegemony in IIungary,
 Rumania and Bulgaria. By their tactics the Soviet, leaders had encour-
 aged their militant supporters in Greene, had upheld their reputation
 for hostility to "colonialism- in the 'Middle East, and had fought off
 any coordinated western program for loosening their grip on the three
 satellites.. .
 The treasuring of grievances, real or imaginary, within a cycle of
 themes for negotiation is paralleled within the individual negotiation
 by the use of disconcerting ripostes and of accusations of bad-faith.
 One of the most important issues which confronted the Moscow Con-
 ference of Foreign Ministers in October 1943 was whether the Czecho-
 slovak Government-in-Exile should conclude a twenty-year defensive
 alliance with the Soviet Union alone, or whether the building of any
 regional systems of postwar guarantees against a revival of German
 aggression should be postponed until the three major allies could re-
 solve the problem by joint decision. . . . Early in the discussion a con-
 crete issue of fact arose between Eden and Molotov. In a conciliatory
 fashion Eden began by saying, "I may be mistaken, but ..." Before
 lie could complete his sentence Molotov broke in harshly, "You are mis-
 taken," His abrupt riposte was effective. Eden's presentation was dis-
 rupted. By this tactic, and by constant accusations that the western
 powers were trying to rebuild a cordon Ranitaire in Eastern Europe,
 Molotov succeeded in evading any probing discussion of the nature and

 purpose of the Soviet program of building up .a security belt of its own
 and won British approval and American acquiescence for the first step,
 the conclusion of the Soviet-Czechoslovak alliance, which was signed at
 Moscow two months later.
 During the course of negotiation it is often clear that the Soviet nego-
 tiators are under compulsion to try for a certain number of times to se-
 cure each Soviet point, no matter how minor. After trying up to a cer-
 tain point and finding that the. demand cannot be put through the
 Soviet representative has often given in, only to turn to the next itein
 in dispute, over which a similarly prolonged period of deadlock ensues.
 What is not clear, however, is whether the number or duration of these
 tries has been prescribed in advance by instruction or whether it is left
 to the judgment of the individual Soviet negotiator to decide when he
 has built up a sufficiently impressive and protective record of having
 beat his head against a stone wall,.
 A good example of the "head-against-stone-wall" technique de-
 veloped rather early in the ilegot i atioris of 1945-46 over the Yugoslav-
 Italian boundary. At the first meeting of the Council of Foreign
 Ministers, held at London in September 1945, almost the only item of
 agreement was a brief instruction to the Deputies to the effect that the
 boundary "should be in the main the ethnic line leaving a minimum
 under alien rule,." When the Deputies began their work at Lancaster
 House, in January 1946, the Soviet delegation began a strong cam-
 paign, lasting for some six weeks of almost daily argument, to re-
 move the words, "in the main." The issue was fought over in long
 meetings of the four-power Commission for the Investigation of the
 Yugoslav-Italian Boundary, and from there it was carried into long,
 numerous and even more tense meetings of the Deputies.
 The three words which aroused Soviet ire were extremely impor-
 tant. If the boundary was to follow "the ethnic line" it would reach
 the sea between Monfalcone and Trieste, leaving Trieste with its large
 Italian majority and the coastal strip of Western Istria within Yugo-
 slavia. In the triangle Monfalcone-Gorizia-Trieste the ethnic boundary
 between Italian and Slovene villages is clearly marked and has hardly
 varied in several hundreds of years. On the other hand, if the bound-
 ary was to be "in the main the ethnic line," the Commission would
 have to give considerable weight to the claims of the Italian majorities
 in Trieste and in the coastal strip of Istria, offsetting against them
 the Slovene national character of several small villages in the coastal
 strip between Monfalcone and Trieste. If the words "in the main" were
 omitted it was hardly necessary to send out an investigating commis-
 sion at all, with its attendant. wave of turbulence, terrorization, kid-
 nappings and murders, and the "ethnic line", pure-and-simple, could
 be drawn in Lancaster House.
 During the weeks of intensive debate tension mounted around the
 green-topped table. As usual, Soviet intransigence turned the dispute
 into % test of staying-power. In view of the fact that public opinion still
 continued to regard any failure to reach speedy agreement with the
 Soviet government as primarily the fault of American or British "reac-
 tionaries," rather than attributing any part of it to the "all-or-nothing"
 Soviet attitude, it was not clear how long the western delegations would

 20              THE SOVIET APPROACH TO 'NEGOTIATION
 hold out against the Soviet demand that the boundary issue be pre-
 judged one-hundred-percent in favor of the Soviet position. In an
 effort to win the Soviet delegation over to a compromise the Western
 delegations offered to remove from the purview of the boundary com-
 mission Fiume, the islands of the Quarnero and the primarily Yugo-
 slav-inhabited parts of Venezia Giulia; they did insist that the formula
 "in the main" be retained and that the commission be free to investigate
 the Italian and mixed areas within the region. Finally, "enough was
 enough," even for Soviet negotiators enamored of indefinite repetition,
 and the Deputies suspended their meetings without agreement on the
 terns of reference.
 Now, at last, the Soviet delegation had, reluctantly, to inform Mos-
 cow that the Western Deputies refused to budo-e on this basic issue of
 rewriting the formula which had been aapprovec by the Council of For-
 eig'rn Ministers. This put up to the Soviet government the question of
 taking the responsibility for an indefinite deadlock in the negotiation
 of the peace treaties. After two days of marking timethe Soviet delega-
 tion asked to have a meeting of the Deputies and proceeded, without
 outward resentment., to a )prove the final western-backed version of the
 commission's terns of reference, retaining the key words, "in the main
 the ethnic line." One basic factor in the Soviet decision to recede from
 its stubbornly pressed demand must have been that Anglo-American
 forces were stationed in Trieste, Pala and the Isonzo valley. If 1 ugo-
 slav or Soviet forces had been in possession the deadlock would prob-
 ably have been allowed to continue indefinitely... .
 One of the. main pitfalls in wartime Anglo-American negotiations
 with the Soviet. Union was the tendency to rely upon reaching an
 "agreement in principle," without: spelling out in sufficient detail all
 the steps in its execution. After long and strenuous debates, studded
 with charges, accusations and suspicions, it was undoubtedly it great
 relief to reach a somewhat generally worded agreement and to go
 home. Prodded by manifold public and party duties, anxious to prove
 to thernselves and to their people that current agreements and post-
 war cooperation with the Soviet Government were genuinely possible,
 faring "deadliness" with respect, to the expectations of legislatures and
 of public opinion, flit' western leaders often approached these negotia-
 tions under serious disadvantages. Wooed rather than the wooer, able
 to deal at leisure with the manipulation of their public opinion at
 bonne. faring no deadlines, the Soviet leaders had many advantages.
 In this situation the western powers sometimes gained the "principle"
 of their hopes, only to find that "in practice" the Soviet government
 continued to pursue its original aims.
 At Yalta the Soviet Government agreed, after very lengthy argu-
 ment and stubborn resistance, to participate in a reconstruction of the
 Polish Government which would, it appeared, permit the survival of
 some political freedom for the great non-Communist majority of the
 people. By delays and (]uibblings over the execution of the "agree-
 ment in principle" during the next few months, the Soviet. Govern-
 merit secured about ninety percent of the original position with which
 it had come to Yalta and thus strengthened beyond challenge the small

 Communist minority in its dominant control of the country. At Yalta
 the Soviet Government also agreed, in return for sweeping territorial
 and other concessions, to deal only with the Chinese National Govern-
 ment as the representative of China. By turning over territory, ad-
 ministration and Japanese arms to Chinese Communist forces, the
 Russians nullified, in the areas where their forces were dominant, the
 principal and vital quid pro quo which they had promised at Yalta.
 When British, Canadian and A merican negotiators come to an "agree-
 ment in principle" they often haggle to a fare-thee-well over the
 implementation of an arrangement which may still be distasteful to
 each of them. However, they remain within the framework of the
 principle to which they have agreed, or else they frankly ask to reopen
 the agreement in principle and to renegotiate it on the grounds that
 further consideration has shown that they cannot carry it out. It has
 remained for the Soviet representatives to assert that they are carry-
 ing out "an agreement in principle" by doing just the reverse "in
 practice." .. .
 In numerous instances Soviet negotiators, even when under some
 pressure to reach agreement, have shown that they are in mortal terror
 of violating any part, minor or major, of their instructions, and are
 extremely reluctant to report to Moscow that they cannot get every
 point and every wording in their own drafts. Making recommenda-
 tions for even slight changes in their instructions exposes them to
 serious risks. It means that they consider their own superiors slightly
 less than omniscient. It may mean that they can be accused of giving
 undue weight to the viewpoint of another government and thus of
 "falling captive to imperialist insinuations." The result is that, even
 when, in a given question, the Soviet negotiator is committed to the
 desirability of achieving agreement, lie is unable to take any initiative
 in finding a reasonable meet,i n,g~ ground of viewpoints and he is usually
 extremely reluctant even to present to his own government suggestions
 for compromise or reconciliation of differences which originate in
 other delegations.
 A widespread lack of ease in using Eno-lish or French commonly
 adds a good deal to the difficulties of the ?oviet negotiator. One of the difficulties of Soviet-Russian vocabulary is that the word
 "compromise" is not of native origin and carries with it no favorable
 empathy. It is habitually used only in combination with the adjective
 "putrid." "Compromise for the sake of getting on with the job" is
 natural to American and British people, but it is alien to the Bolshevist
 way of thinking and to the discipline which the Communist Party
 has striven to inculcate in its members. To give up a demand once
 presented, even a very minor or formalistic point, makes a Bolshevik-
 trained negotiator feel that he is losing control of his own will and is
 becoming subject to an alien will. Therefore any point which has finally
 to be abandoned must be given up only after a most terrific struggle.
 The Soviet negotiator must first prove to himself and his superiors
 that he is up against an immovable force. Only then is lie justified in
 abandoning a point which plainly cannot be gained and in moving
 on to the next item, which will again be debated in an equally bitter
 tug-of-wills... .

 22            THE SOVIET APPROACH TO NEGOTIATION
 The western negotiator is usually able to envisage a series of minor
 shifts in his own and other positions. Ile is "pluralistic" in his ap-
 proach to a solution, in the adjustments of democratic decision-making
 at home and in seeking adjustments of interests and views among na-
 tions. The Soviet negotiator is worried, puzzled, scornful, and sus-
 picious when the western negotiator tries out a series of minor varia-
 tions to see if the opposing positions cannot be brought closer together.
 To him it means only that the western representative was "not serious"
 in the first. place. If'he is willing to shift so quickly from his original
 position it must mean that he did not hold it in earnest. to begin with
 and than he can eventually be forced all the way over to the Soviet posi-
 tion, provided the Soviet negotiator will only display "principled
 steadfastness" long enough and vigorously enough.
 The western representative tends to assume that a minor concession
 here or there will facilitate achieving the common aim of cooperative
 action. He does not necessarily look for an immediate quid pro quo for
 each minor concession. At a later stage in the negotiation his partner
 will remember the facilitating concession and will yield something in
 turn. To him "goodwill" is both a lubricant of the negotiating process
 and a valuable intangible by-product. The Soviet negotiator takes a
 minor concession as a sign that his principles are stronger and his will
 is firmer than those of his opponent. He does not believe in "goodwill."
 Ile is trained to assume the ill-will of the "capitalist environment." If
 an "imperialist" negotiator asserts his will for peace, it means, at the
 best, that he is consciously in favor of peace but is unconsciously a tool
 of uncontrollable forces which work for war and for the final clash be-
 tween "two worlds." At the worst., it means that he is trying to deceive
 and gain time while mouthing words of "peace." To a Bolshevik even a
 momentary "loss of vigilance" may have fatal consequences. The So-
 viet diplomat feels himself like a traveler by night in the forest who
 must be constantly on the watch for the smallest sound or sight of
 treachery. He must be unceasingly on guard against his own human
 tendency to "fall into complacency" and thus to underestimate the
 dangers which surround both him and the regime which he serves.
 Soviet diplomacy is also monolithic in its method of operation and
 in its reactions to outside events or internal changes of stress. 'lime
 American practice is to subdivide authority extensirveiy, both it home
 and in foreign dealings.:' military mission in Moscow, trying to work
 out plans for military coordination, would have nothing to say about
 the arrangements or conditions for lend-lease..  political negotiation,
 aiming to preserve the freedom of choice for an East European nation,
 would have no relation to another mission which might be deciding
 which German ships should be transferred to the Soviet Union, and
 all of them would have no relation to a decision concerning military
 and economic aid to China. No such autonomy or fragmentation of
 authority is felt in the Soviet conduct of its foreign policy. While it is
 probable that little background information on policy is comimini-
 cated by Moscow to its representatives abroad, beyond that which they
 need individually in order to carry out their instruemions. it is pretty
 clear that underlying attitudes are communicated rapidly to them.
 Thus, a negotiation over the statute of Tangier bogs down in Paris:
 this may be a repercussion cf a crisis which has arisen in Vienna or
 of a note delivered in Warsaw. Bolshevist mythology is full of "chain-

 Declassified in Part -Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/30: CIA-RDP71 B00364R000100230001-1
 reaction" concepts of causality. With the clumsy force of centralized
 wisdom it attempts to meet this .assumed universal causal interdepend-
 ence ("nothing is accidental") with its confidence in its own ability to
 manipulate events in accordance with its own Leninist-Stalinist dia-
 lectic, which it regards as a unique instrument for both foreseeing and
 bringing about the future.
 This is a grim picture. The Soviet negotiator is tight as a spring,
 deeply suspicious, always trying to exert the Soviet will-power out-
 ward and to avoid reflecting non-Soviet facts and aspirations inward,
 a rigid agent knowing only the segment of policy which he must carry
 out with mechanical precision. Does this mean that "negotiation" in
 any real sense of the term is impossible? Admitting that negotiation
 under these conditions is a very limited affair and very difficult and
 unrewarding, it may still be both possible and essential. But it requires
 a special approach. Naturally, a knowledge of Russian in its Soviet
 nuances is important. It is equally important to understand the role
 of the Soviet negotiator in relation to his own government and to its
 ideology. The Department of State has carried on a farsighted policy
 of equipping a substantial number of its representatives through lan-
 guage and area training and through service in missions in the Soviet-
 dominated areas to deal with Soviet problems, and as these young
 men mature in experience they will fill an important need. The Army
 and Air Force have also done a good deal along this line.
 In the absence of informal channels of communication with Soviet
 representatives it is important for an American delegation to be able
 to determine whether the Soviet negotiators have no instructions, have
 definite instructions, or merely have instructions to build up a propa-
 ganda position. A well equipped negotiator can go much more thor-
 oughly into the range of Soviet intentions if he follows the discussion
 in the original, without being handicapped by the opaque veil of trans-
 lation. In addition he should review each document exchanged or each
 statement made in the light of its clear rendering into Russian. It is
 unfortunate, for example, that many American public figures con-
 tinually speak of the need for an "aggressive policy" to counteract
 Soviet pressures, when they mean an "energetic" or "vigorous" policy.
 In Russian "aggressive" means only "intending to commit or engaged
 in committing aggression," and the colloquial American use of "ag-
 gressive" inevitably receives a sinister meaning in Russian translation,
 which is the form in which documents must be utilized by all but a
 handful of Soviet negotiators and policy-makers.
 In conducting negotiations with Soviet representatives it is impor-
 tant to adopt in the beginning a single clear position, one which can
 be upheld logically and politically during long discussions. The Soviet
 delegation will not report this position as the final and strongly held
 one until they have had a chance to attack it from all sides. Indefinite
 repetition of arguments must be accepted as an inevitable preparation
 to negotiate. The American negotiator is inclined to male a single
 presentation and then to become impatient when the Soviet response
 makes it plain that the Soviet representative either has not understood
 it or does not believe it. The Soviet negotiator, of course, does not be=
 lieve what he hears, but he listens for undertones of firmness or un-

 certainty which tell him whether or not he is slinking the determina-
 tion of his adversary. Strong but controlled feeling, rather than im-
 patience or anger, is an effective way of giving him his answer to this
 question. 1lrlren a position is firmly established it is often advantageous
 to prepare a. special inemorandtlru, accompanied by a clear and iclio
 niatic translation into Russian, in Order to be sure that one's Own posi-
 tion is adequately reported to Moscow, the only spot at which new
 instructions are likely to be initiated. Oral statements of position may
 or may not be r-ejxn?te(l, but it is probable that every bit of written
 material is carefully transmitted. If some part of the' English nienio-
 randunr does not lend itself to clear rendering into, Russian, it is useful
 to rewrite the English version until it can he rendered without am-
 biguity, for while Russian can express any thought, it, does not lend
 itself flexibly to a literal rendering of ill English concept or phrase.
 Once a position has been worked out, the iron-Soviet negotiator must.
 be prepared to uphold it in detail, and for a long time. The technique
 of constantly trying out variant, versions, which works well in the
 western style of negotiation, only confuses the Soviet representative,
 who suspects some new trick in each new variant and must. subject each
 in turn to exhaustive interpretation. Constantly modifying one's posi-
 tion of- the way in which it is expressed menus also that. the Soviet
 negotiator is at a loss to know what version is based on bed-rock and
 should therefore be reportedto Moscow. Even slight shifts in position
 or wording increase his belief that the adversary's position is a shaky
 one and thus encourage him to hold out that much longer for the full
 Soviet position. Western negotiators are usually in a position to accept
 slight adaptations, but even the slightest variation must be reported
 back to Moscow for decision there.
 Since western negotiators are generally free, in the light of previous
 instructions and their knowledge of their governments' overall policies,
 to comment at once on new proposals or statements made during the
 course of negotiation, they often assume that Soviet negotiators have a
 similar latitude and accordingly press them to express their views.
 When so pressed, the Soviet negotiator is always free to raise innuiner-
 able objections and criticisers. He is not free to express concordance
 with any part of a proposal on which lie has not received instructions
 from Moscow. Even the "program statements" of Soviet negotiators
 must be reviewed or written in Moscow before they can be delivered,
 and therefore Soviet statements at conferences often seem to have little
 relation to the immediately preceding statements of other delegations.
 When It negotiation is actually under way, it is useful to avoid press-
 ing the Soviet delegation to commit itself on a new proposal or draft.
 During the active negotiations carried on in the European Advisory
 Commission. whenever a new proposal or even a redraft was first, pre-
 sented, it was my habit to ask questions which would clarify its mean-
 iirg and implications and then to take the Initiative. even if I had
 adequate instructions, in saying that, I would have to consult my gov-
 ernment before commenting on it, thus relieving the Soviet delegation
 of the onus of either declining to comment on it or else of building up
 a whole series of negative statements against. the proposal. Then, out
 occasions when I had instructions on the new point at issue, I would
 go at once to the Soviet delegation and inform its members in detail of
 the American position. This meant that .Moscow had before it, at the:

 same time, the proposal and the American position on it. When there
 was a certain underlying desire to reach agreements, this procedure
 was often effective, or so it seemed, in reducing the number of diver-
 gences by providing full. background on the problem before Moscow
 had taken a firm position, which could later be modified only by a long
 and exhausting tug-of-wills. Such informal discussions, conducted in
 Russian, also offered an occasion for learning or sensing the often un-
 foreseen Russian objections and suspicions and for attempting to
 remove or alleviate them at an early stage.
 When stating a position it is well to be sparing in the use of gen-
 eral or broadly stated principles, and when such principles are an
 essential part of the position it is necessary to remember that they
 are not shared by the Soviet negotia+tor. Broad statements of prin-
 ciple can, however, be effectively anchored in the historic experience
 of one's own people and, expladiied in that setting, they can have a
 certain impact on Soviet thinking. Soviet policy-makers may then
 accept them as a fact which mu,4 be taken into account, even though
 they do not believe in them or share theirs.
 Wherever possible it is more useful to state one's position in terms
 of a definite material interest, is in the case of the question of Bul-
 garia's obligation to provide reparation to Greece and Yugoslavia.
 Soviet-trained negotiators pride themselves on identifying material
 interests and can therefore more readily visualize them as facts to
 which a certain adjustment can be made.. . .
 Is it worthwhile to dwell - on these experiences or to talk about
 negotiating at all? Even during the wartime alliance against the
 common menaces of Germany and Japan negotiations with the Soviet
 government were extremely dif tcult and frustrating, and, aside from
 the advantage of having established the United Nations, even before
 the end of the war, as a "forum for the opinions of mankind," none
 of the wartime agreements on postwar cooperation has worked out
 as was hoped, even against hope. Since the war the Soviet govern-
 ment has striven by all the means in its extensive arsenal to gain and
 retain every advantage for its sidle, regardless of the fact that thereby
 it quickly dissipated a very large reservoir of good-will and aroused
 the deep alarm of all nations which lay beyond its direct control.
 In a period of Soviet expansion and of hope for further expansion,
 negotiation could have only the purpose of confusing and dividing the
 nations which opposed its pressure, and since the war the Soviet
 purpose in negotiating has not been to reach agreements with strong
 opponents but to intimidate weaker and adjacent countries and to
 undermine the stamina of its principal potential adversaries.
 Protected by two oceans and remote from the direct origins of
 previous world wars, Americans have been accustomed to ignore the
 rising storm and then, once it had burst upon them, to work solely
 for victory over the immediate menace. Thus, they tend to feel a
 sharp dichotomy between "war" and "peace." When at peace they
 are reluctant to think of the possibility of war. When at war they
 concentrate solely on winning the war, as if it were a grim football
 match, and refuse to worry about the peace which is the goal of
 war. Through Lenin and Stalin Soviet thinking has fully absorbed
 the Clausewitz maxims that ivitional strength and strong alliances
 determine the effectiveness of national policy in peace, and that in

 war one must never lose sight of the aims of policy for which it is
 waged. To the Soviet -way of thinking, conflict is inherent in the
 development. of "capitalist." society, and cannot be wished out of exist-
 ence byy "subjective good-will."
 within this ongoin * history of conflict, however, Soviet tactics and
 techniques are not inflexible. Soviet policy towards the outside world
 has varied markedly during the past thirty-four years. True, the out-
 ward pressure of Soviet power has marked and !;eared the post-194-5)
 Sears and the building of a reliable counterforee is only now under
 way in Europe. The outline of It similar counterforce cannot yet be
 discerned in Asia. In western policy the building of "positions of
 strength" and the use of negotiation must go hand-in-hand. Building
 of strength and negotiating cannot be regarded as alternatives or as
 opposites. They must be teamed. Negotiation without strength and
 determination behind it is frustrating, dangerous and may be suicidal.
 On the other hand, when strength has been built, refusal to negotiate
 may precipitate a colossal struggle, which would be fought as it cruel
 civil war in many parts of the world.-the very conflict which western
 strength is beinm fashioned to avert.
 For the tinie%eing negotiation of those issues which are negotiable
 between the Soviet Union and the west is, generally speaking, in
 abeyance. But the art of policy will be to recognize, from a position of
 strength, future potentialities of negotiation, not with an expectation of
 bringing about a lasting or worldwide relaxation of Soviet ambitions,
 but as a means of alleviating individual sources of tension and thus
 of strengthening the free world. And if negotiation must go in harness
 with consistent and purposeful building o? strength, the art and to_ch-
 nique of international dealings must also he broadened to take full
 account of the peculiar character of the Soviet approach to negotiation.

 ON DEALING WITH RUSSIA
 By Dean Acheson
 (Former Secretary of State)
 ROLE OF NEGOTIATION IN SOVIET STRATEGY*
 Why is it that so many of us who have dealt with Russian officials
 find that personal recollections are pretty much restricted to anecdotes,
 sardonic or ridiculous, to discussions, frustrating and boring ? It is, I
 think, because no real personal relations are possible. Either those
 Russians with whom we have had to deal do not dare open their
 minds, or those who dare have nothing in them to disclose.
 Sir William Hayter, formerly British Ambassador in Moscow, has
 come to the same conclusion. With individual Russians, he has written
 in the London Observer (October 2, 1960), it is not "possible to estab-
 lish any kind of lasting or genuine personal relationship," and with
 "the real rulers of Russia ... it was the distressing experience of
 all Ambassadors that these great men had no more to say in private
 than in public; the same series of gramophone records was played
 on every occasion; nothing emerged from these private conversations
 that could not just as well be gleaned from the pages of Pravda."
 It seems almost as though Russians going abroad went to a school
 of dialectics, where naturally coarse manners were made intentionally
 offensive, and where the students were trained in a technique of in-
 tellectual deviousness designed to frustrate any discussion. For in-
 stance, if one is inexperienced enough to be involved in discussion of
 the merits of free thought, free expression, and a free press, the riposte
 is that our information media are owned and used by the imperialist-
 monopolists to poison and misinform the masses. How much better the
 wise parent who forces his children to speak the truth by punishing
 them when they tell falsehoods. Even better, we are told, is the Soviet
 government which makes the truth so abundantly available to all
 citizens that there is no need or place for private versions and perver-
 sions of it. This same pattern of thought can be applied to elections,
 in which the same benevolent Soviet system safeguards the ingenuous
 elector from the misguidance of self-interested and ambitious men, by
 permitting only one candidate--- -in other words "the best man." After
 a few evenings of this sort of talk, anything is preferable.
 In official negotiations the methods employed have a common root.
 My discovery of it, and consequent saving of my sanity, I owe to

 Averell Harriman. Toward the end of the war I found myself the
 head of an American group negotiating with a Russian group for the
 delivery and payment of some war surplus property when hostilities
 should sto . After the third meeting it dawned on me that the Russians
 were merely repeating the same things and that we were getting no-
 where. I disclosed m ? frustration to Averell, our Ambassador then to
 Moscow, who was in Washington for consultation.
 "Take a few days' recess,"-he advised, "then meet., give them a paper
 with your proposal, explain it, and recess again. This will enable them
 to cable Moscow and get instructions." Ile explained that none of our
 oral proposals had been sent to Moscow, since to have done so would
 have opened the sender to charges of being impressed by what we said,
 but that a written proposal was another thing. This had to be reported.
 To suppress it would be to assume responsibility which also could lead
 to criticism. This advice worked. The negotiations got nowhere ; but
 they ended, of which there had seemed to be no possibility before.
 Mr. Vyshinsky was not a formidable opponent. He was not equip ed,
 as is Khrushchev to use debate, discussion, and negotiation for their
 chief function in Soviet strategy. Unfortunately what this function is,
 is ill understood in non-Communist countries. I have heard people who
 should know better, including a head of government, say happily. "As
 long as we keep them talking, they're not fighting." Nothing could be
 more untrue: they are fighting. They are adopting a tactic specifically
 prescribed by Lenin to delay the crises while demoralizing and weak-
 ening the enemy. To our minds international conferences and interna-
 tional negotiations are so completely means for ending conflict that we
 are blind to the fact that they may be and, in the hands of experts, are
 equally adapted to continuing it. In the present century the Soviet
 state  s perfected the use of negotiation, including negotiation by
 mass conference, as a method of warfare. this use long antedates the
 Communists. A classic example is the negotiation conducted at Canton
 by the Chinese with Lord Napier of Merchiston, representing the
 British government, in the 1830's, as brilliantly told by Maurice Collis
 in Foreign Mud.' The similar use of negotiation by the Communists at
 Brest-Litovsk in 1917-1918 and Panmunjom in 1951-1953 was worthy
 of the model.
 negotiation, in the classic diplomatic sense, assumes parties more
 anxious to agree than to disagree; parties who are, therefore, willing
 to make concessions in determining what shall be agreed upon. But, as
 a friend put. it, Americans in recent. years have come to see three ele-
 ments in the process of negotiation. There is the element of the high
 school debate, in which the judges are the newspaper columnists and
 the Asian and African leaders are the audience. In other words, this
 element stresses the impression made by the negotiation, often a con-
 trived impression, as in the Geneva Summit Meeting of 1955, rather
 than its outcome. The second element is the Yankee horsetrade. Here
 the emphasis is on outmaneuvering the opponent, on the game, rather
 than on any importance of the game.
 The third element is the evangelical one of a revival meeting. Take
 the sawdust trail to salvation or suffer damnation in the fires of a nu-
 clear hell. "There is no alternative to negotiations with the Russians''

 THE SOVIET APPROACH TO NEGOTIATION              29
 is the constant theme of a well-known columnist and a prominent polir-
 tician in this country and of a large section of the British Labour
 party. This is, of course, silly. For if there is no alternative, and if the
 Russians will only negotiate, as is now the case on their own terms,
 then there is no alternative to surrender. But there plainly is an al
 ternative, which is by action to change the attitude of the other party.
 Negotiation should not be, as some conceive it, mere talk apart from
 action. Negotiation and action are parts of one whole. Action is often
 the best form of negotiation.. It affects the environment, which in large
 part is likely to determine the outcome of negotiation. The sputniks
 were powerful moves in negot.ialion; so was the Marshall Plan. Mr.
 Khrushchev at the 1960 Paris Summit Meeting, as at the New York
 General Assembly, was affecting the environment of international rela-
 tions. He was using conference and the forms of negotiation as an
 instrument of war.
 True negotiation with the Russians, when and how it can occur, has
 been admirably summed up by Sir William Ilayter in the excellent
 article already mentioned :
 Negotiation with the Russians does occur, from time
 to time, but it requires no particular skill. The Russians
 are not to be persuaded by eloquence or convinced by rea-
 soned arguments. They rely on what Stalin used to call
 the proper basis of international policy, the calculation of
 forces. So no case, however skilfully deployed, however
 clearly demonstrated as irrefutable, will move them from
 doing what they have previously decided to do; the only
 way of changing their purpose is to demonstrate that
 they have no advantageou  alternative, that what they
 want to do is not possible. Negotiations with the Russians
 are therefore very mechanical ; and they are probably bet-
 ter conducted on paper than by word of mouth.
 POSSIBLE PITFALLS ON TtFE WAY TO TIIE SUMMIT *
 There is a good deal of folklore, about on the subject of negotiating
 with the Russians... .
 We are told, for instance, that since only Mr. Khrushchev can make
 decisions for the Russian Government, meetings at lower levels are
 foredoomed to failure; therefore, on to the summit. Again, that "the
 tragic experience of Geneva in. 1955" came from "a grandstand con-
 ference," and that this summer's meeting should be held  in
 private. . .
 Is it true that the only way to work anything outwith the Soviet
 Government is by conference with the. top man and his staff?
 The answer is that it depends on what one is trying to work out. Mat-
 ters as complex as the concerting of military and supply operations
 on a vast scale during a world war did require this method. Yet the
 method, as method, contributed nothing to real agreement on the
 solution of Eastern European questions. On the other hand, in 1949,
 arrangements for the ending of the blockade of Berlin were agreed
 to without meetings at any level. It depends on what the Russians.
 find it in their interests to do.

 30            THE SOVIET APPROACH TO NEGOTIATION
 Let us have a closer look at the events of 1949. After the coup in
 Czechoslovakia, Stalin had decided in Khrushchev's later phrase, to
 cut out the "cancer" of Berlin. So, ?ollowin the reform of Vest. Ger-
 man currency, a serious problem for East Germany, the blockade of
 Berlin began in 1948. The United States r ponded with the airlift
 (which probably would not work today) and by a counter-blockade
 of East Germany. The Russians became the losers both in Germany
 and in their general propaganda position.
 Then, at the end of January, 1949, the Soviet Government published
 answers by Stalin to questions submitted by a newspaper correspond-
 ent. One of these questions and its answer were most interesting. The
 question was whether the Soviet Government would raise the block-
 ade if the Western powers agreed to postpone the formation of a West
 German state. pending a meeting of Foreign Ministers to consider the
 problem of Germany as a whole. The answer given to this is worth
 quoting in full :
 Provided the United States of America, Great Britain
 and France observe the conditions set forth in the third
 question, the Soviet Government. sees no obstacles to lift-
 ing the transport restrictions on the understanding, how-
 ever, that transport and trade restrictions introduced
 by the three powers should be lifted simultaneously.
 Officers in the State Department believed that this might be a signal
 that the Soviet Government was ready to discuss an end to the blockade
 and counter-blockade. It was decided that the Secretary of State, in a
 press conference, should give a signal back.
 This took the form of a bland discussion of the questions and
 answers in the Stalin interview. No great importance was attributed
 to them. It was pointed out that the formation of a West German
 Government could hardly be a cause of the blockade since it had not
 been thought. of when the blockade was imposed and was not immi-
 nent at the time. Certainly the measures taken in response to the
 blockade would end when it did. Finally, there were these two para-
 graphs :
 There are many ways in which a serious proposal by
 the Soviet Government to restore normal interzonal
 communications and communications with and within
 Berlin could be made. All channels are open for any sug-
 gestions to that. end. The United States, together with the
 other Western occupying powers, wold, of course, con-
 sider carefully any proposal made to solve the Berlin
 problem consistent with their rights, their duties, their
 obligations as occupying powers.
 As I say, all of the normal channels are open. I hope
 you will not take it amiss if I point out that if I on my
 part were seeking to give assurance of seriousness of pur-
 pose, I would choose some other channel than the channel
 of a press interview.
 At the same time, a senior diplomatic officer attending a United
 Nations meeting was instructed to say quite casually to a senior Rus-
 sian officer at the same meeting that he had been interested in the

 THE SOVIET APPROACH TO NEGOTIATION              31
 answers recently in the press and wondered whether they suggested
 anything more than the strict words of the text. The Russian officer
 had no information; but if he learned anything he would pass it on.
 In a week he did, equally casually. The answer had been very carefully
 prepared in Moscow. If the American officer had any specific question
 the Russian would do his best to get an answer.
 Thus began a protracted and highly secret negotiation. The very
 fact that secrecy was preserved was to each of the parties a sign of
 the good faith of the other. In the end, it was agreed that the blockade
 measures on both sides would be ended, a Foreign Ministers meeting
 convened on the German problem, and no obligation incurred to post-
 pone action on a West German Cove?nment since there was plenty of
 time for the meeting to be held before, in the normal course of events,
 any further steps would be taken. As the negotiations finished, other
 parties were brought in; they approved the plan and joined in the
 announcement.
 The conference of Foreign Ministers which followed took weeks
 and accomplished almost nothing. It was an exercise in propaganda
 over Germany. The Russians had exhausted their capacity for adjust-
 ment, and further progress must -await the development of new
 realities..  .
 This brings us to the second of the illusions we have mentioned
 about negotiating with the Russians. This is contained within the be-
 lief that it is possible to have "private" and not "grandstand" confer-
 ences of heads of governments.
 President Eisenhower does not share this illusion. "It is rather dif-
 ficult," lie said recently, "to visualize such a thing. If you meet with a
 group of world leaders, it is rather hard to keep the spotlight off of
 it." And how does one talk informally with "batteries of interpreters
 and recorders and all that sort of thing? It would almost inevitably
 change, I think, into something rather formal."
 The illusion, however, goes deeper than the belief that it is possible
 to keep these meetings private and out of the spotlight. It goes to a
 misconception of the role of these meetings in the Russians' strategy
 of negotiation. The purpose of these meetings to them is not, through
 discussion of a subject, to reach a resolution of it or an accommodation
 regarding it. These meetings are acts in themselves which are intended
 to affect the relative positions of the parties.
 The Soviets negotiate by acts and not by debate, offer and counter-
 offer. Their purpose may be to separate allies, or to undermine gov-
 ernments with their people, or to win over uncommitted peoples. Or it
 may be, as in "the tragic experience of Geneva in 1955," to bring a
 sense of relaxation, goodwill and security, before some energetic of-
 fensive such as Soviet intervention in the Middle East.
 Publicity is the lifeblood of such an operation. It is not merely, as
 President Eisenhower thinks, that a meeting of world leaders attracts
 the spotlight. It is that the purposes of the Russian leaders demand
 the spotlight, for the spotlight makes an act out of a speech.
 Here, too, the Soviet leaders have built-in advantage, for the spot-
 light shines brilliantly throughout the Free World and stops at the
 Iron Curtain which rings their own. Their opponents and all who may
 support or sympathize with them are open and eager to be worked
 upon. But the Communist people are immune from any counteroffen-

 sine, and hear only what their rulers wish them to hear. The dice are
 loaded in this game.
 The conclusion is not, of course, that the Western powers must not go
 to these conferences. But it is an illusion to expect much from them,
 or to identify them with the process of negotiation. in the usual sense
 of the word. They should be recognized for what they are: dangerous
 and highly mobile adversary operations .. .
 We can and should be ready, as we have been on occasions in the
 past. to use ingenuity in devising ways to give the Soviet Union rea-
 sonable assurance. of its own security and demonstrate our willingness
 to remove causes of anxiety, if an, there really are. The [arms con-
 trol) negotiations at Geneva over the past years have had this purpose.
 But one thing we should never do. That is to undermine the security
 of Western Europe-and with. it the best hope we have for avoiding
 resort to nuclear war-by destroying the possibility of developing
 such a strong defensive position on the ground in Europe that any
 aggressor contemplating a move against it must contemplate an at-
 tack on so large a scale that nuclear war would almost certainly re-
 sult. Only such a situation makes strategic nuclear power a credible
 threat and an effective deterrent....

 [From Soviet Policy Towards International Control of Atomic Energy. Copy-
 right ? 1961 by University of Notre Dame Press. Reprinted by permission.]
 THE GAMESMANSHIP OF INTERNATIONAL
 NEGOTIATION
 By Joseph L. Nogee
 (Professor of Political Science, University of Houston)
 The problem of international control of atomic energy is distinctly
 propitious as a case study in Soviet diplomacy. Not ony is it a prob-
 lem that is now a closed subject, but it is one which permits examina-
 tion of Kremlin policy on a vital issue from beginning to end. The
 choice between a national or international atom, so important in the
 middle and late 1940s, was a dead issue in the early years of the next
 decade : Soviet science and the cold war had permanently nationalized
 the atom.
 Secondly, the topic is one that contains more than its share of the
 drama that is inherent in any problem of such magnitude. The Baruch
 Plan was almost as revolutionary in its political implications as the
 plan for controlled atomic fission-a formidable challenge which had
 to be faced. Whatever course of action Premier Stalin followed in-
 evitably portended momentous consequences in view of the key position
 of the Soviet Union in world affairs.
 Thirdly, a relatively complete body of documentary evidence on
 this subject is both available and accessible to the scholar at the present
 time.. .
 One of the most important features of Soviet policy toward inter-
 national control of atomic energy was its duration and consistency.
 Given the deep-rooted nature of the Soviet aversion to internationaliz-
 ing any segment of Russia's economy, it remains a question why the
 Soviet Government did not reject the proposals in toto in 1946 instead
 of engaging in an eight-year debate with the object of defeating the
 proposals? In other words, why was the Soviet rejection of interna-
 tional control of atomic energy an indirect instead of a direct one? To
 broaden the question, of what importance was the prolonged series of
 negotiations in the Atomic Energy Commission, General Assembly
 and Disarmament Commission in the promotion of Russian national
 interests?
 Along with the leaders of every major nation, the Soviet elite recog-
 nized the world-wide pressure of public opinion for some form of
 control against use of atomic bombs. Premier Stalin himself com-
 mented that "the desires and conscience of people demand that the use
 of atomic energy for war-like purposes be prohibited." 1 Andrei
 Gromyko gave expression to this same force in his opening speech be-
 fore the Atomic Energy Commission when he said :

 34            THE SOVIET APPROACH TO NEGOTIATION
 If we continue to use these discoveries for the production of weapons of macs
 destruction we may intensify mistrust between states and keep the people of
 the world in continual anxiety and mistrust. Such a position would work against
 the aspirations of the pace-loving peoples who are thirsting for the establishment
 of a solid peace and who are making every effort to endure that their aspirations
 shall be transformed into reality.'
 The Soviet Union, which purported to bare its foreign policy upon
 popular aspirations for peace and security could no more afl'or(l to
 neglect world opinion on this subject than could any other major
 nation. At the very least it had to pay lip service to this popular ex-
 pression. .
 The negotiating techniques of the Soviet Union in the United Na-
 tions were, however, considerably more complex than merely paying
 lip service to a universally accepted ideal. And Soviet objectives in
 negotiating control of atomic energy were more ambitious than solely
 digging the grave for international control. Considerable. attention, in
 fact, was given by the Soviet Government to the United Nations debate
 to promote Soviet interests. While Soviet atomic energy policy did
 vacillate at times and appeared at moments confused and inconsistent.
 there was a broad pattern of objectives and tactics which over the
 eight-year period of atomic energy negotiations was both consistent.
 and positive. Over the past decade, as negotiations for disarmament
 replaced negotiations for international control of atomic enery, these
 same objectives and tactics have dominated Soviet diplomacy'-'
 The over-all motivation of Soviet behavior in atomic energy negotia-
 tions was to mobilize world public opinion favorable toward the Soviet
 Union. For their purposes the Soviet leadership divided world opinion
 into roughly three segments : the communist world, the Western world
 and that segment not encompassed by either, which can be labeled
 neutral public opinion. Each segment, of course, required the use of a
 different set of tactics, or more accurately, a stress of one particular
 technique over another to meet the requirements of the different objec-
 tives for the communist, Western and neutralist segments.
 Broadly speaking, the Soviet objective in atomic energy negotia-
 tions vis-a-vis the communist world was to reinforce anti-Western
 feeling by emphasizing the aggressive intention of the United Stites
 and England. Toward the Western nations the Soviet representatives
 were more. concerned with using the negotiations to put pressure on
 the United States to renounce use of the bomb. Soviet efforts to in-
 fluence the neutralist nations were primarily aimed at justifying the
 Soviet proposals and seeking United Nations approval-at least in
 principle-of Soviet atomic energy policy.
 Some of these objectives and the tactics used to achieve them were
 incompatible and there were times when Soviet policy did not seem to
 be consistently seeking any recognizable objective. For example, many
 of Miolotov's or Vyshinsky's vitriolic speeches, which were directed
 primarily to the ears of the pro-communist world, so irritated the vast.
 majority of United Nations representatives that some neutralist na-
 tions which might have given some support to the Russian proposals
 were alienated ; and, some of the Soviet propaganda eharzes against
 the United States were so palpably untrue that they had the effect of
 discrediting some of the more reasonable Soviet claims.

 THE SOVIET APPROACH TO NEGOTIATION           Jv
 The major proposals advanced by_the Soviet Government were not
 meant to be taken literally. They were too extreme to be accepted by
 the majority. They exceeded even Soviet expectations. Their purpose
 was to put the Soviet Union in a position from which it could bar-
 gain-i.e., in a position from which it could gain concessions by offer-
 ing concessions. Many of the Soviet resolutions and speeches had no
 relevance at all to negotiating in the conventional sense of a give-and-
 take in negotiation. These were designed only to convey and reiterate
 a propagandistic theme-e.g., that the Soviet Union stood for the
 absolute prohibition of atomic weapons or that the United States was
 planning to attack the Soviet Union. The Soviet representatives were
 not directly concerned about the truth or falsity of their statements
 before the various United Nations commissions and committees. What
 concerned them was the effect of what. they said on the attainment of
 their objectives. They were interested in creating attitudes. They were
 not interested in sounding out the extent of Western demands and then
 attempting to reconcile these demands with those of the Soviet
 Government.
 The distinction between communist, Western and neutralist areas
 of opinion which the Soviet representatives sought to influence is par-
 tially arbitrary. Rarely were Soviet propaganda efforts at any one
 time directed at only one area. The differing demands of each area
 had tobe met continuously in every organ of the United Nations where
 international control of atomic energy was under debate.
 One of the important features of the way Soviet atomic policy in
 the United Nations was carried out was the general uniformity of
 presentation before all the various orggans where the subject was de-
 bated. In general, there were no significant differences in the content
 and tone of Soviet speeches made before the General Assembly and
 its committees, the Security Council or the Atomic Energy Commission
 and Disarmament Commission and their various working committees.
 One might have expected a difference in approach to correspond with
 the different functions of the various United Nations bodies. The
 smaller working committees of the Atomic Energy Commission and
 Disarmament Commission, for example, were designed to facilitate an
 exchange of information and to reconcile conflicting points of view.
 When issues came before the larger United Nations organs-including
 the Atomic Energy Commission and Disarmament Commission-these
 objectives ordinarily gave way to attempts to enlist general support
 for or to justify a nation's policy. However, the general procedure for
 the Soviet representatives was to present the same kind of speeches
 before every body, large or small. Wherever they had the opportunity,
 the Soviet representatives utilized the smaller working groups to give
 the same long, tendentious, and hostile speeches that they gave before
 the Security Council or General Assembly.
 It is, therefore, possible to analyze the over-all objectives sought by
 the Soviet representatives without identifying these objectives with a
 particular United Nations body or limiting them to a particular period
 of time. Soviet representatives used the atomic energy negotiations
 principally for the attainment of five objectives. They were:
 (1) To reject the American atomic energy proposals without
 appearing to do so.

 36              THE SOVIET APPROACH TO NEGOTIATION
 (2) To link Soviet policy with popular aspirations throughout the
 world.
 (3) To portray the policies of the Western bloc-and the United
 States in particular-as aggressive.
 (4) To prevent the United States Government from using its atomic
 superiority to gain political advantages.
 (5) To stall for time.
 ' oward the attainment of each of the objectives the Soviet repre-
 sentatives utilized a specific set of tactics which they considered most
 relevant. Often one particular tactic served more gran one objective.
 One such case was the Soviet use of parliamentary tactics of diversion
 which served not only to stall for time, but fitted in with the Soviet
 goal of rejecting proposals without appearing to do so. As noted
 above, some of the taut ics designed to facilitate one particular objec-
 tive hindered the attainment of other objectives. .
 These five objectives constituted the esoteric goals of Soviet atomic
 energy negotiators in contrast to the exoteric 3 goals stated on the face
 of the Soviet proposals. It is not likely that these objectives were for-
 mulated at one time in any systematic manner; but the postwar record
 of atomic energy negotiations reveals that the Soviet representatives
 worked priniarify and consistently toward these ends. Moreover, it is
 quite clear that These same tactics have been an integral clement of all
 Soviet disarmament negotiations over the past fifteen years. With the
 changing subject matter of course, some goals have changed. No
 longer, for example, do the Soviets need to stall for time to build an
 atomic stockpile. New objectives have replaced some of the old. More
 recently Soviet negotiations have been directed toward a weakening of
 the NATO alliance system by encouraging dissension among the
 Western powers and by preventing the arming of NATO forces with
 nuclear weapons. It is clear that the lessons of the first eight postwar
 years apply to the east decade and a half.
 "Gamesmanship' is perhaps too facetious a term to describe the
 intensely serious contest in propaganda and psychological warfare

 a stall for time, the attainment of these unexpressed goals would have

 TECHNIQUES OF NEGOTIATION
 By Gordon A. Craig
 (Professor of History, Stanford University)
 Despite the relative lateness of their admission to the Western dip-
 lomatic community, Russian rulers and their ministers were not slow
 in appreciating the importance of negotiation and mastering its tech-
 niques. Thera is no entirely satisfactory history of the origins and early
 evolution of Russian diplomat .y ; but it is clear from what accounts
 we possess that at an early stage the court of Muscovy carried on
 negotiations with the khans of Asia and the caliphs of Bagdad; and
 in the time of Ivan III diplomacy was as frequently used as war in
 adjusting Russia's relations with the Golden Horde* and the Tartars
 of the Crimea. That prince was, ilideed, engaged throughout his reign
 in continuous negotiation, not only with his nearest neighbors but also
 with the papacy, the Hapsburgs, the king of Bohemia, and the Danish
 court, and he was reputed to be skillful in negotiation with ambas-
 sadors from abroad, a reputation supported by the successes of his
 diplomacy.'
 Russian relations with the West in this early period were inter-
 mittent but of increasing scope; and by the middle of the sixteenth
 century the court of Moscow found it expedient to coordinate the
 activities of the many Greek, Italian, and other agents working for
 it in the West by establishing a primitive foreign office, the Bureau
 of Ambassadors. As the ambitions of the rulers grew, and as their eyes
 began to turn to areas dominated by the Turks and the Swedes, they
 availed themselves of those coalition-making capabilities of negotia-
 tion of which Callieres was later to write, and sent envoys to seek
 alliances and other forms of aid in Vienna and Berlin, in Venice and
 Madrid, and in London, Paris, and the Hague.2 Before the seventeenth
 century was over, the obvious advantages of continuous contact with
 foreign courts had led to the establishment of the first permanent
 missions abroad,3 and this process was pushed further by Peter the
 Great and by Catherine, whose policy was oriented to the West and
 who participated actively and profitably in the complex play of dip-
 lomatic maneuver that filled the eighteenth century... .

 subtly played. It had to be subtle to be convincing. Where Soviet tac-
 tics were not subtle, they risked exposure and thus the defeat of the
 Soviet objectives.
 ? An incident reported by Frederick Osborn. concerning America's atomic energy negotia-
 tions during 1947-1949, provides an interesting example of the Soviet attitude toward
 atomic energy negotiations. Before Andrei Gromyko was scheduled to return to Moscow In
 1949, Osborn asked him if the two of them could not sit down together and go over atomic
 energy matters before Gromyko left, in order to break the deadlock that had developed over
 the past few years. The American representative expressed the opinion that Gromyyko was
 sincere in his desire to find a solution and that the Soviet representative trusted Osborn's
 sincerity. Together, said Osborn  they might be better able to explore both their govern-
 ments' positions than in the public debates on the Atomic Energy Commission. Gromyko
 looked at Mr. Osborn quietly for a moment and replied, "Mr. Osborn, you may be sincere,
 but governments are never sincere." They never had their talk. Osborn "Negotiating on

 The characteristics and negotiating techniques of Russia's diplo-
 matists in the early years of this association were a source of contempt,
 amusement, or exasperation to Western statesmen. The first Russians
 who visited Western countries as, special envoys struck at least one
 observer as very little more than "baptized bears." 4 Certainly they
 comported themselves as something less than human, and they made
 Muscovite grossness proverbial in the West by ruining the apartments
 assigned to them, breaking the furniture, and "leaving behind them
 unsupportable odors and indescribable filth." 5 When Peter the Great
 led his "Great Embassy" to the West in 1697-98, his suite virtually
 destroyed the house in which they were quartered in London. The
 floors were left covered with grease and ink; the curtains, quilts, and
 bed linen were torn to rags; fifty chairs were broken or had disap-
 peared entirely ; twenty fine pictures were slashed and the frames
 destroyed; and 300 window panes were broken..6 Damage of this nature
 could not be attributed wholly to inadvertence or to lack of breeding.
 Much of it appeared to be a deliberate flouting of Western convention
 in order to demonstrate Russian superiority. It accorded with other
 unpleasing traits of these first embassies: rudeness in matters of
 protocol, scornful disregard for the laws of the land to which they
 were accredited, and studied incivilities in their relations with their
 opposite numbers.'
 Negotiation with the Russians was always a difficult and indeed tedi-
 ous business. Envoys sent abroad were provided with detailed instruc-
 tions prescribing how they should act, what they should say, what
 tone they should use, what persons they were authorized to meet, and
 much more. They were never given full powers and could decide noth-
 ing without reference to higher authority. The introduction of new
 subjects into the course of a negotiation in train, or a suggestion that
 the discussion be turned to a differeiit level, invariably led to interrup-
 tions while the Russian representative sought new instructions. Nor
 was the tempo of negotiation appreciably faster in Moscow on those
 occasions when foreign envoys were given an opportunity to deal with
 the tsar through his chief ministers. All too often the envoys would
 learn, after interminable delays, that they were expected merely to
 accept fiats from the tsar; and demurrers on their part were met with
 pressures, menaces, and expulsions that showed little respect for the
 accepted code of diplomatic etiquette.,,
 Finally, negotiation with the Russians was hampered by certain char-
 acteristics of Russian intercourse that always delayed and sometimes
 defeated understandin. Perhaps because they had gone to school in
 Byzantium before they- established a firm relationship with the West,s
 the Russians retained Eastern habits of thought and discourse that
 were irritating to Western negotiators. What John Wheeler-Bennett
 has called "the incalculable capacity of the Slav for interminable con-
 versation" 10 tried their patienc.o to the utmost, while Russian arts of
 mystification often surrounded negotiations with impenetrable fogs

 of confusion. Even such a pronounced Westerner as Peter believed
 that dust should be thrown in the eyes of his Western rivals and that
 obfuscation should be considered an important instrument of Russian
 Policy. Peter's servants followed this injunction. Of A. I. Ostermann
 it was said that foreign ministers could sometimes talk with him for
 two hours and, on leaving his cabinet, be no better informed than when
 they entered it...

 Russian diplomacy in the nineteenth century was virtually in-
 distinguishable in method and technique from that of the states with
 which it dealt; and the outstanding Russian diplomats could have
 been put to work in other services without causing the slightest. incon-
 venience or disruption and with no need for re-training in the instru-
 ments and techniques of their craft. Their values, their language, their
 methods, in a word, their style was that of Western diplomats in gen-
 eral.. .
 It may be noted that in the latter half of the nineteenth century the
 Tsarist regime had every reason to put a higher valuation upon nego-
 tiation than upon such other instruments of foreign policy as war and
 propaganda. If in other countries the complaint was sometimes heard
 that the diplomats were always surrendering what the soldiers had
 won, in Russia it often appeared that the main function of diplomats
 was to make good the mistakes of their military coll    es, The skill-
 ful tactics of Orlov and Brunnow at the Paris conference of 1856
 tempered the demands of the victors in the late war and freed Russia
 from a diplomatic isolation that might have been dangerous in the
 ensuing period. In 1878, the masterly diplomatic campaign conducted
 by Peter Shuvalov in London and Berlin extricated Russia from
 the insupportable position to which it had been brought by a Panslav
 ppoolicy. And in 1946, in the Portsmouth conference that ended the
 Itusso-Japanese War, Witte and Rosen won a success that few would
 have pr edreted before the negotiations be  n...
 All in all, the conduct of Russian diplomacy in the nineteenth
 century was marked by competence and occasionally by brilliance, and,
 especially in conference negotiation, Russian     m
 di ~oatists showed .c
 special talent for making the most of bad cases. There was, however,
 nothing particularly original or distinctive about Russian practice. It
 was reserved for the Soviet reggime to devise new techniques of negotia-
 tion, while at the same time challenging the patience and ingenuity of
 the West by the way in which it adapted the traditional techniques to
 its own purposes.
 The Bolshevik regime began its career by announcing, in effect, that
 it was withdrawing Russia from the Wrestern diplomatic community,
 that it intended to repudiate all legal ties made with other nations by
 the Tsarist. government, and that it would refuse henceforth to con-
 form to the rules and procedures that had obtained in international
 relations. All this was made clear to the world by the Bolshevik Decree;
 on Peace, passed by the second All-Russian Congress of Soviets on
 November 8, 1917,11 and by Trotsky's statement two weeks later, at the

 time of the publication of the secret treaties, when he announced the
 abolition of the old diplomacy and "its intrigues, codes, and lies" and
 promised the inauguration of an "honest, popular, truly democratic
 foreign policy." 12 From now on, the Peace Decree stated, negotiation 11
 would be conducted "absolutely openly before the entire people ;
 and it was implied that intergovernmental negotiation would be mini-
 mal, especially after the restoration of peace, and that the Bolshevik
 regime, as a people's government, would henceforth direct its appeals
 and its messages to peoples rather than to their rulers. This would
 presumably make even the old diplomatic apparatus unnecessary,
 which is probably what was in Trotsky's mind when he spoke of issuin
 "some revolutionary proclamations to the peoples and then [closing]
 up the joint [i.e., the Foreign OfTice].7 74 . . .
 Trotsky himself [later] became the most eloquent advocate of a
 resumption of normal relations with other powers, using his influence
 in 1921 to conclude a final peace with Poland and to settle the bound-
 aries of the Baltic countries and, as early as 1920, urging Lenin to
 conciliate Great Britain.15 To maintain contact with the bourgeois
 states seemed the best way of detecting, and even influencing, their
 intentions. Moreover, as long as Russia was an isolated power girded
 about by possible coalitions, it seemed expedient for Soviet diplomats
 to be versed in the methods of their adversaries. Before long, the
 classical handbooks on diplomacy and such modern studies as Satow's
 Guide to Diplomatic Practice and Jules Cambon's Le Diplomate were
 being translated and read in the Soviet Union; and at the Genoa Con-
 ference of 1922 and subsequent high-level meetings Soviet delegations
 demonstrated that they could, when they wished, be scrupulously cor-
 rect in matters of protocol and that they had also acquired considerable
 facility in the use of orthodox procedures and tactics.
 This return to normal methods paid dividends, as is shown by the fact
 that, although the Soviet Union often faced the possibility of complete
 isolation in the years following the Brest conference, it always escaped
 it. Between 1920 and 1924 it was able to establish its reputation for
 reliability sufficiently to win recognition from most of the Western
 powers, and this was accomplished in large part by patient negotiation
 and by the skillful use of the. techniques of classical diplomacy, especi-
 ally the art of playing upon the differences of the powers and appealing
 to their greed or their fears.
 At the same time, even in this defensive period of their diplomacy, the
 Soviets were hesitant to commit themselves entirely to the values and
 procedures of the bourgeois West. If they learned to play the tradi-
 tional game as well as their bourgeois colleagues, their methods were
 on occasion apt to be startlingly unorthodox. They frequently advanced
 their objectives not by direct talks with other governments but by
 means of their contacts with individuals and groups whose pressure
 might move the governments in question. Something new was certainly
 added to negotiating form when Karl Radek held levees for German
 soldiers, businessmen, and politicians in a cell in the Moabit prison in

 1919, and whence he sought to induce his guests to use their influence
 in favor of a Soviet-German entente. 18 and the Treaty of Rapallo,
 the revelation of which exploded the Genoa Conference. 'had been pre-
 pared by other talks like Radek's conducted by agents of Leon Trotsky
 in the previous two years.11 The tendency to avail itself of multiple
 channels of negotiation, some (like the various Comintern links) lead-
 ing to groups whose activities inside friendly states were clearly sub-
 versive in nature, was one of the characteristics of Soviet diplomacy
 after 1920; and in the late twenties this sometimes weakened or de-
 stroyed work patiently achieved by more orthodox approiv'hes.
 In its forma negotiations with bourgeois states, Soviet diplomacy in
 the interwar period bore some resemblance to Ru-sian diplomatic
 behavior in the sixteenth and  venteenth cent:u ries. The Soviets had
 become participants in the affairs of the Western diplomatic com-
 munity reluctantly and only because it was in their interest to do so.
 but they never became members of it in any real sense. A British
 negotiator wrote in exasperation in 193:3 that one could get nowhere
 with the Soviets because they were "completely unable to see themselves
 in any other light than that of an a grieved Power struggling for
 their noble ideals against a world of political, financial and commercial
 conspirators." 18 In all of their dealings with Western powers, their
 attitude was one of inveterate suspicion-, which took various forms. As
 in the earliest period of Russian diplomacy, rigidity and legalism be-
 came hallmarks of Soviet negotiating technique, and Soviet, diplomats
 were as tightly bound to their instructions as were the envoys of Peter
 the Great anc his predecessors. Their suspicion was often extended
 even to the framework of the negotiations, and I have written elsewhere
 of the way in which the Soviet representative in talks on the possibility
 of resumption of diplomatic relations between Great Britain and the
 Soviet Union in 1929 stalled the negotiations until his own agenda was
 accepted instead of that. drawn up by the British Foreign Office, al-
 though the differences between the two seemed inconsequential even to
 the expert eye.19 Aside from this, the stoutness with which Soviet rep-
 resentatives held to their positions in negotiation became proverbial.
 They were far less inclined to make concessions to their opponents'
 point of view than their opponents were to theirs; and, indeed, when
 their opposite numbers made concessions, they viewed this with un-
 easiness and distrust, as showing that their adversaries had been in-
 sincere in adopting their original positions and were probably
 plotting some dark anti-Soviet stroke.
 In 1939, when the Western powers were seeking an agreement
 with the Soviet Union in order to check Hitler's march of aggres-
 sion, this attitude toward compromise proved an almost insupera-
 ble barrier to profitable exchange,. The Soviet negotiators in-
 variably stressed the necessity of Western concessions on the very
 points on which the West was most reluctant to yield; and attempts
 to conciliate them by giving way on lesser points merely encour-

 THE SOVIET APPROACH TO NEGOTIATION              43
 aged them to belive that, if they persisted, the West would give
 way on the major ones too.2e At one point in the negotiations,
 Lord Halifax, the British Foreign Secretary, asked the Soviet am-
 bassador "point-blank whether the Soviet Government wanted a
 treaty at all; to which M. Maisky said that of course they did, and
 why did I ask the question? Because, I replied, throughout the
 negotiations the Soviet Government had not budged a single inch
 and we had made all the advances and concessions ... Saying `No'
 to everything was not my idea of negotiation." 21
 The difference between Soviet and Western negotiators here and
 on other occasions was not, of course, merely one of tactics or even
 of understanding. At the root of these difficulties of negotiation was
 a fundamental incompatibility of purpose, which the Soviets, as long
 as they needed economic aid or security from foreign intervention
 or assistance against National Socialism or material help in the Fascist
 war, were careful not to admit, and which the Western powers were
 reluctant to see. It was only after the Second World War, when the
 Soviet Union, confident in its mission as it had been in 1917 and
 conscious of its strength, once more announced its inflexible. opposition
 to bourgeois society, that the real difficulties of negotiation with the
 Soviet Union were appreciated in the West.
 In a melancholy survey of post-World War II diplomacy, the for-
 mer British Permanent Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Lord
 Vansittart, wrote a few years ago: "I have `done' many conferences
 in my life but never went into one without some hope of a fairly quick
 result. No one could say the same today. Results are often not expected,
 and often not even desirable." 22
 One has no difficulty in admitting the relevance of these words
 to negotiations on major issues between the Soviet Union and the
 West since 1945. In these encounters the Soviet Union has very often
 appeared to be returning to the tactics that characterized its conduct
 of negotiations at Brest-Litovsk in 1918 and for much the same rea-
 sons that prompted its behavior there. Once more it has seemed to be
 confident that the victory of Communism on a world scale could not be
 long delayed and that all confrontations between Soviet and Western
 negotiators must be used to encourage the forces of revolution. Once
 more negotiation has been used not as a means of promoting agree-
 ment but as a weapon to discomfit enemies and reveal to the world
 their weaknesses, the falseness of their professions, and the injustice
 of their claims. Once more the very act of negotiation has been trans-
 formed into a dramatic performance designed to entertain and instruct
 a wider public with a spectacle of enlightened Soviet representatives
 battling manfully against the forces of capitalism and imperialism..
 In promoting this kind of negotiation, the Soviet Union has shown
 a great diversity of effective tactics. Not the least important of these
 has been the practice of universalizing its own position in the hope that
 the peoples of colonial areas, the uncommitted world, and significant

 parts of the populations of Western nations would identify themselves
 with it. This is in accordance with the advice given by Marx and Engels
 in The German Ideolog t where it is written that, since "increasingly
 abstract ideas hold sway' in the modern world, the revolutionary class
 is compelled to "represent its interest as the common interest of all the
 members of society, put in an ideal form; it will give its ideas the form
 of universality, and represent them as the only rational, universally
 valid ones," and it will seek to speak "not as a class but as the represent-
 ative of the whole society." ' 23 The Soviet Union has carried this idea,
 over to the sphere of international politics and, by doing so, has sought
 to invest its views and proposals with infallibility.
 The diplomatic advantage of this posture is that it can be used
 to make the traditional approach of Western diplomacy-the assump-
 tion of a com.meree d'avis reciproque and the search for agreement
 through compromise--seem somehow morally reprehensible. At the
 outset of the negotiations of the foreignt ministers in Geneva in 1959,
 Premier Khrushchev made a speech in Tirana, Albania, commenting
 on the Western case before it was presented. This kind of intervention
 into negotiations that were supposed to he private would in itself have
 been considered extraordinary in an earlier age, but .what Khrushchev
 said was even more remarkable. The Western proposals, Khrushchev
 said,
 do not contain it single element for negotiation. These pro-
 posals are not based on a desire to find a correct solution
 with a view to achieving that relaxation of international
 tension which all peoples so anxiously await .. .
 The USSR sincerely wishes to come to an agreement.
 But we reject the principle that one party should force its
 conditions on the other party. Mr. Adenauer and his
 foreign minister, Mr. Brentano try to force such a prin-
 ciple on the foreign ministers. Thtey say, : "With the L SSR
 one must negotiate as follows: concession for concession !"
 But that is a huckster's approach ! . . . We do not have to
 make any concessions because our proposals have not been
 made for bartering. We act on the principle that sensible
 solutions must be found which would not damage any
 country . . . Those who really strive for peace must not
 use methods of petty bargaining in the talks.2
 It is the studied inconsequence, of these statements that makes them so
 formidable. Our position is correct, Premier Khruslichev says, and is
 in the interest of people everywhere. To attempt to make us give up
 any part of our claims betrays both the false values of the bourgeois
 West (the mercantile rather than the statesmanlike approach) and its
 indifference to the cause of peace.
 Once formal negotiations get under way, .Soviet, tactics are de--
 signed to keep the image of a virtuous TLS.S.R. contending with
 cynical and unscrupulous adversaries before the world audience. Since
 coming to grips with concrete issues is not vital to negotiators in-
