 Cambodia: Back on theAttack
 The two months' lull in fighting ended on 9
 November when the Communists began a series of
 coordinated attacks on important government
 positions in Kompong Cham Province. Enemy
 pressure eased after several days, however, and
 Cambodian units once again gave a good account
 of themselves.
 Some of the heaviest fighting occurred just
 northwest of Kompong Cham city, where the
 Communists briefly occupied the town of
 Troeung at the junction of Routes 7 and 21. A
 few miles farther north the enemy inflicted fairly
 heavy casualties on two government battalions
 defending a small village.
 Kompong Cham city was hit by sporadic
 enemy mortar fire. The Communists also made a
 strong attack on the city's airfield, but three
 Khmer Krom battalions defending government
 positions at the airfield held their own with the
 aid of air strikes. On the east side of the Mekong,
 the town of Tonle Bet and two nearby villages
 were subjected to enemy ground probes. West of
 the city, enemy attacks along Route 7 extended
 as far as the town of Skoun, the rear security base
 for the  government  column  operating  along
 Route 6. Cambodian Army troops at Skoun re-
 pulsed probing attacks there. South of Skoun, the
 Communists destroyed a key bridge, blocking the
 movement of reinforcements to Kompong Cham.
 The last major Communist attacks in the
 Kompong Cham area were in late May. Since
 then, government defenses in Kompong Cham
 city have been strengthened considerably. The
 continuing presence of four Communist main
 force regiments near the city indicates the Com-
 munists may intend to maintain pressure in this
 sector.
 The attacks may be designed in part to fore-
 stall further Cambodian advances north and east
 of Route 6. Cambodian commanders scrapped
 plans to divert any troops from the column on
 Route 6, however, and reportedly hope to use
 forces in Skoun and along Route 7 to reopen that
 artery eastward to Kompong Cham.
 The military initiative was not left entirely
 to the Communists during the week. A combined
 force of Cambodian and South Vietnamese Army
 troops began a major offensive operation to clear
 Communist elements between Routes 2 and 3,
 some 20 miles south of Phnom Penh. As was the
 case with an earlier Cambodian operation in the
 same area, however, only token contact with the
 enemy was reported.

 Vietnam: Where Has All the Main Force Gone?
 In shifting from a "general offensive" strat-
 egy ii South Vietnam in 1968 to a less ambitious
 one in much of Irdochina in 1970, the Commu-
 nists have made some drastic changes in their
 military organization and deployments- By mid-
 1968 they had committed nearly 60 main force
 (regular) infantry regiments to the fighting in
 South Vietnam. Now, there are only a few more
 than 20 in the country, and many of these are in
 fairly remote base areas.
 the Commu-      25X1
 nists near Saigon have also disbanded the 101st
 Regiment, a first-line North Vietnamese Army
 unit that infiltrated into the South several years
 ago.
 What has hapaened to the other large units?
 A few have been disbanded-possibly as many as
 ten regiments-anc' the forces formerly subordi-
 nate -:o them have been reorganized to operate as
 separate battalions or as reinforcements
 Cong local forces and guerrillas.
 These shifts underscore the en-
 emy'i changing short-term priorities. Laos and
 Cambodia now come before Da Nang and Saigon,
 at least as far as main force commitments are
 concerned. They also point up the fact that a
 large part of the enemy's main force is still intact,
 even though much of it has been directed away
 from objectives in South Vietnam. This is part of
 the over-all transformation of Communist tactics
 in South Vietnam. toward greater emphasis on
 guerrilla forces, terrorism, and political action.
 The Communists have also sharply cut large
 units in northern South Vietnam, although there
 are still more main force regiments there (about
 12) than in any other region. This compares with
 nearly 30 enemy regiments in or near Military
 Region 1 at the peak of the 1968 fighting. Since
 then the Communists have disbanded only two
 regiments here, both in the Da Nang sector. The
 main reduction has been caused by a shift of
 major elements of several North Vietnamese divi-
 sions back into North Vietnam and the Laos
 panhandle.
 The Communists have made some of the
 most drastic cutbacks in Military Region 3, sur-
 rouncing Saigon. It was here that they formed a
 number of new regiments in late 1967 and early
 1968 in order to bring heavy pressure on the
 capital. Soon after the Communists abandoned
 this objective in 1969, they began to break up
 and disperse at least three main force regiments-

 active and considers even those inadvertently in-

 The private property decree also covers
 abuses by officials as well as petty crimes. There
 have been reports for years that government of-
 ficials in the countryside have been pressuring
 cooperative members for bribes and for  roduce
 from private  lots.
 The regime in Hanoi, seemingly dissatisfied
 with the discipline in the North, has taken stern
 new corrective measures. Two new decrees were
 announced in late October that hit hard at crimi-
 nal             abuses  of  both  state-owned  and  private
 property.
 The state property law is aimed at cracking
 down on a wide variety of offenses, ranging from
 petty thievery and wastefulness to organized
 criminal  activity, embezzlement and misap-
 propriation by officials. The little information
 that has seeped out of North Vietnam regarding
 corruption suggests that it continues to be fairly
 widespread, and is adversely affecting popular
 morale. The regime may be serious this time in
 doing something about it. The new law levies
 serious penalties, even for misdemeanors, is retro-
 Hanoi has moved in other ways to bring the
 country under tighter rein. The authorities have
 ordered  the various  inspection  mechanisms,
 through all echelons of government, to watch
 more closely over domestic affairs and to exact
 stricter compliance with central government in-
 structions. This is buttressed by a rather heavy
 propaganda  campaign  that  almost  daily  has
 warned against breakdowns in law and order and
 against what the regime clearly considers to be
 unsatisfactory levels of performance by cadres
 and workers.
 This kind of crackdown is a distinct change
 from the regime's relatively tolerant attitude of
 the past two years. Up to a short time ago, Hanoi
 either looked the other way or relied on finger
 shaking to correct the country's ills. Although
 propaganda of this kind often is overdrawn, it
 now appears that the regime is attacking the prob-
 lem because it believes it is undercutting to some
 extent Communist performance in the war and
 the  restoration  of  North  Vietnam's  econ-
 omy.

 LAOS: Souk Vongsak, the special envoy of Lao
 Communist  leader Prince Souphanouvong, re-
 turned to Vientiane from Hanoi via the recently
 instituted Soviet air service on 7 November. On
 his arrival, Souk said he had come to resume
 discussions  with  Prime  Minister  Souvanna
 Phourna on preparing for peace talks at Khang
 Khay. The Communist envoy hewed to the famil-
 iar Communist line, insisting that any talks would
 be between representatives of the "two princes,"
 Souphanouvong and Souvanna, a position that
 avoids recognition of Souvanna as head of the
 Lao Government. It is not yet clear how this issue
 of representation will be resolved, but Souk may
 have brought a response to the government's
 telegram of 27 October which, in effect, offered
 the Communists a chance to compromise. Mili-
 tary activity, meanwhile, was at a relatively low
 level this week as government forces withdrew six
 battalions that had been harassing enemy lines in
 the panhandle and prepared defensive positions
 for anticipated North Vietnamese attacks west of
 South Korea: Opposition Rocks the Boat
 Kim  Tae-chung of the New Democratic
 Party (NDP) has started the 1971 presidential
 campaign early, stumping the major provincial
 cities where  he draws large and enthusiastic
 crowds. A forceful orator, he is challenging Presi-
 dent Pak by name and has not hesitated to speak
 out on potentially explosive issues such as na-
 tiona defense and the administration's continued
 Kim Tae-chung
 failure to implement a
 constitutional  require-
 ment for local self-gov-
 ernment. He has also at-
 tacked favoritism within
 the national militia-an
 institution  that affects
 virtually    every South
 Korean family. In addi-
 tion, Kim has raised a
 variety of less sensitive
 but  nonetheless com-
 pelling issues, including
 women's rights and tax
 reform.
 Caught off balance
 by Kim's vigorous chal-

 lenge, harried administration leaders have re-
 sponded with public denunciations of Kim's pro-
 posals and even veiled threats of outright suppres-
 sion. In some instances the local authorities have
 resorted to clumsy and generally unsuccessful
 tactics, such as offering free admission to local
 movie houses on the day Kim is to speak, and
 flooding his rally site. Somewhat more subtly,
 they have sought to curtail media coverage of his
 campaign and to cut off his sources of campaign
 funds.
 Kim is still a long way from being a threat to
 Pak's re-election. In comparison to Pak's Demo-
 cratic-Republican party, the conservative NDP is
 poorly organized and short of money. Moreover,
 the whole weight of the government bureaucracy,
 down to the lowest village level functionary, can
 be brought to bear in support of Pak. Over-
 reaction by the administration, however, could
 endanger the political stability that Pak has built
 up over the years. Pak has been reported to be
 incensed by Kim's criticism and has demanded
 that something be done about him. This raises the
 possibility that if not Pak himself, a subordinate,
 in the hope of currying presidential favor, might
 take some drastic action that would stir greater
 support for the opposition.

 Communist China: The Shrinking Elite
 The continued absence of Chen Po-ta, a
 member of the elite politburo standing committee
 and Mao Tse-tung's longtime confidant and per-
 sonal secretary, raises suspicions that he has be-
 come a victim of another round of factional
 quarreling at the top levels of the regime. He has
 not appeared in public for over three months and
 the regime has offered no explanation for Chen's
 failure to be with other ranking leaders on oc-
 casions when his presence would seem obligatory.
 His prolonged absence from public view is being
 treated in a manner strikingly similar to that
 employed in the recent ouster of another polit-
 buro member, Peking political boss Hsieh Fu-
 chill. The disappearance of these top leaders,
 together with the unpublicized removal of some
 key provincial officials, attests to considerable
 behind-the-scenes  maneuvering  within  China's
 post - Cultural Revolution elite.
 Chen is 65I                   I Press com-
 mentary on last month's National Day turnout in
 Peking          did not follow the past practice
 of noting that some leaders were ab-
 sent due to illness. Instead, the cover-
 age of the event employed the un-
 precedented device of alphabetically
 listing Chen's standing committee col-
 leagues, Chou En-lai and Kang Sheng,
 together with the remainder of the
 politburo, suggesting a clumsily con-
 trived effort to downplay Chen's ab-
 sence.
 Western diplomats in Peking re-
 cently reported a rumor that at the
 major party plenum held from late
 August to early September Chen was
 criticized for undisclosed sins. An at-
 tack on Chen, taken together with the
 fall of Hsieh Fu-chih, should be fol-
 Page   5
 lowed by serious repercussions, but there are as
 yet only tenuous signs of disunity among the
 remaining leaders. Most, including Mao himself,
 have been appearing with unusual regularity since
 late summer, suggesting that Peking has taken
 pains to maintain a "business as usual" facade at
 the top.
 Moreover, analysis of regional and provincial
 leadership turnouts over the past six months or so
 indicates that some first- and second-echelon lead-
 ers have probably been removed from their posts.
 The officials apparently in disfavor include several
 provincial  government heads newly appointed
 during the Cultural Revolution, and possibly the
 commander of the important Peking Garrison
 command. The regime's continued refusal since
 the Ninth Party Congress in April 1969 to provide
 an authoritative and comprehensive "pecking or-
 der" for the new politburo is yet another indica-
 tor that Peking is still struggling to resolve the
 power relationships among competing interest
 groups that comprise the present elite.

 EUROPE
 UN: A Melange of Disarmament Issues
 The current session of the UN General As-
 semblV, like those of recent years, is being used
 by tha less developed countries to press the big
 powers to move faster on disarmament. The gen-
 eral satisfaction with the strategic arms limitation
 talks (SALT) and with the US-USSR draft treaty
 limiting military use of the seabeds has served,
 however, to blunt much of the sharpness which
 characterized previous Assembly debates on arms
 control issues.
 The draft seabeds treaty, endorsed earlier
 this year by all of the 25 nations attending the
 Geneva disarmament conference, with the excep-
 tion of Mexico, apparently will be approved by
 the Assembly members with little or no opposi-
 tion and will be opened for signature early in
 1971. A resolution commending the treaty was
 introduced in committee this week with the im-

 been mollified by superpower assurances that the

 Earlier in the current session it appeared that
 the East Europeans would be willing to allow the
 question of controls on chemical and biological
 weapons (CBW)-ari abrasive issue last year-to be
 referred back to the Geneva conferees in a way
 that would favor neither the Soviet CBW draft
 convection nor the British draft treaty on BW
 agents alone. Lately, however, they seem to be
 more inclined to push for Assembly adoption of a
 resolution favoring the Soviet text. Complicating
 the problems posec for the US by the CBW issue
 is the possibility that Yugoslavia may seek to have

 only Albania expressed a negative view. In view of
 this favorable climate of opinion, it appears un-
 likely that the Assembly will be asked to consider
 again the 1969 resolution which, addressed di-
 rectly to the Helsinki conferees, called for a mora-
 torium on the further testing and deployment of
 new offensive and defensive strategic weapons
 systems  "as an urgent preliminary measure."
 Sweden is preparing a resolution that simply calls
 for a cessation of tests of nuclear weapons and
 missile systems, and Japan may attempt to
 counter even this mild resolution with one that
 merely "welcomes" the talks.
 Among the nonnuclear-weapon states the
 subject of general and complete disarmament
 (GCD) has attracted a surprising amount of atten-
 tion again this year. Italy and Sweden, for ex-
 ample, may propose a resolution that would give
 some specific guidelines on GCD to the Geneva
 disarmament conference. Swedish UN delegate
 Edelstam has expressed concern that, lacking such
 guidelines, the superpower cochairmen of the
 Geneva talks will opt for only a miniprogram that
 would not be responsive to the disarmament as-
 pirations of the nonaligned.
 Complementing the interest in GCD are
 Romanian and Philippine initiatives on the eco-
 nomic and social consequences of the arms race.
 The Philippine draft resolution is especially trou-
 blesome for the US--and presumably for the
 USSR-because it charges the UN Secretary Gen-
 eral with the task of developing a disarmament
 program and proposing specific measures, a
 course of action that would constitute a deroga-
 tion from the prerogatives of the Geneva talks.
 The Romanian text is less contentious; it merely
 calls for a UN study on the subject.
 In the Assembly's general debate, several
 delegEtions referrec favorably to the SALT talks;

 Czechoslovakia: Husak Strengthens His Position
 During the past three weeks Czechoslovak
 party boss Gustav Husak has moved vigorously
 against hard-line critics of his moderate-conserva-
 tive policies. Husak apparently is anxious to go
 into .he forthcomng central committee plenum
 with a firmer control over the party mechanism.
 The foundation for the recent moves was
 laid down at the June central committee plenum
 when the party  chief warned that continued
 extremist agitation to expand the purge of liberals
 would harm his attempts to normalize the situa-
 tion. On 10 September Husak called for recon-
 ciliation with the disaffected intelligentsia as a
 necessary move to ensure effective management
 of Czachoslovakia's complex economy.
 During all thi; time, however, sniping at his
 conci iatory line continued, especially in the pro-
 vincial press and in some radio commentaries. On
 8 September, hard-liner Bohuslav Chnoupek was
 removed as chief of the broadcasting system and
 later departed Prague to become ambassador to
 Moscow. The radio and other mass media have
 since moved toward more consistent support of
 Husak's policy. The ultraconservatives' voice has
 not been stilled, however, as a new publication,
 Leva Fronta, is prcviding the ultras with a vehicle
 for criticism of Husak's moderates.
 Since mid-October Husak has moved faster
 to consolidate his position. Two leading hard
 liners  have  been  removed  from office-Josef
 Groesser, the Czech state interior minister, and
 General Otakar Rytir, the liaison officer to the
 Soviet forces in Czechoslovakia. Czech state Jus-
 tice Minister Jan Nemec and Minister of Educa-
 tion Jaromir Hrbek are also rumored to be due
 for dismissal.
 Husak apparently had a severe struggle be-
 fore he was able to prevent the start of political
 trials. The recent indefinite postponement of the
 trial of the liberal "Pachman group" indicates he
 has won on this point. A further blow to the hard
 liners was the failure of East German party boss
 Ulbricht to provide any sign of encouragement
 for them during his recent state visit. In fact,
 Ulbricht gave his blessing to Husak's policies.
 Moscow's blessing is also implied, as Husak would
 not be moving so boldly without assurance of
 support from the Kremlin.
 Husak thus goes into the central committee
 plenum with a relatively strong hand. The unity
 of the top leadership remains, with even such
 conservative presidium members as Alois Indra,
 Antonin Kapek, and Vasil Bilak lining up behind
 the current moderate line. It begins to appear that
 the power of the hard liners is on the wane,
 barring unforeseen developments. The plenum is
 not likely to be a showdown, but it will provide
 an indication of how far and how fast Husak
 intends to go toward "reconciliation."

 Suslov Hits Bonn Revanchists in Anniversary Speech
 Some statements of Politburo member Sus-
 lov in his October anniversary speech on 6 No-
 vember, together with other recent Soviet pro-
 nouncements, point to possible differing opinions
 among Moscow's leaders on the proper approach
 to relations with West Germany. Suslov's re-
 marks-which were probably cleared with his col-
 leagues beforehand -suggest that the existing con-
 sensus may favor a relatively guarded attitude
 toward Bonn, in contrast to the enthusiasm ex-
 pressed earlier by party chief Brezhnev over the
 Soviet - West German treaty.
 Suslov praised the Soviet - West German
 treaty, calling it a "foundation for a turn to the
 better" in bilatera  relations, but balanced this
 praise with a reminder that the treaty could "only
 play its role in ful' measure when it enters into
 force." Beyond this, he revived a vigilance theme
 that has been virtually absent in recent weeks. He
 asserted that "influential reactionary forces" in
 West Germany have come out against the treaty,
 and warned it would be "unforgiveable" to under-
 estimzte the "forces of aggressive militarism and
 revanchism" that continue their "insane plans for
 recarving the map of Europe." Suslov's remarks
 about "revanchist" forces in West Germany re-
 versed the pattern of the anniversary slogans,
 which for the first time in several years dropped
 such language in reference to West Germany.
 E uslov's cautionary remarks may, of course,
 have partly reflected Moscow's concern over the
 durab lity of the Brandt coalition, whose stability
 at the time appeared threatened by state elections
 in Hesse. They may also indicate, however, that
 the existing consensus within the collective pre-
 fers a cautious approach toward Bonn, despite the
 ringing endorsement the treaty has received from
 other quarters, notably from party chief Brezh-
 nev.
 Erezhnev, for instance, publicly endorsed
 the treaty on two -event occasions, in Alma Ata
 on 28 August, and in Baku on 2 October. In the
 latter speech, he presented by far the most posi-
 tive appraisal of the treaty to come from any
 authoritative Soviet source. He acknowledged-in
 line with Suslov-that the treaty would "only"
 have its full impact after ratification, but asserted
 that "even now" it is having "a favorable effect
 on the situation in Europe."
 While staking out a position as a staunch
 advocate of diplomatic approaches to West Ger-
 many, Brezhnev has also hinted of domestic op-
 position to this policy. In Baku, he referred dis-
 paragingly to "differences of opinion which one
 encounters here and there as to which side has
 gained more from the treaty," and argued that all
 sides had gained equally.
 Suslov, speaking of the economy, assured his
 audience that "the mighty Soviet industry is now
 capable" of solving all technical problems, guaran-
 teeing rapid economic growth and increasing its
 defense capacity. He boasted of the largest grain
 crop in history and the fulfillment of major five-
 year plan goals. Behind this rosy facade, however,
 were admissions of a multitude of unsolved eco-
 nomic problems.
 Suslov complained that agricultural produc-
 tion, especially meat output, currently was inade-
 quate to meet the future demands of the popu-
 lace. In the industrial sector, he acknowledged
 that capital construction was lagging, new tech-
 nology was being too slowly introduced, product
 quality was low, materials were wasted, and labor
 discipline was weak. His projected 1970 growth
 rates for industrial production and labor produc-
 tivity forecast another year of only moderate
 growth. Moreover, the absence of specific com-
 ments on the exact status of the next five-year
 plan (1971-75) suggests that problems over re-
 source allocations persist.

 Finland: Communist Party Split
 The split within the Communist Party has
 jeopardized the prospects for continued economic
 stabilization in Finland and may lead to the par-
 ty's withdrawal from the government coalition.
 The minority conservative faction in the
 party  has  consistently opposed the tripartite
 agreement, painfully worked out after the 1967
 devaluation between labor, management and gov-
 ernment, imposing strict controls on price and
 wage  increases. Charging the majority liberals
 with selling out the interests of the workers, the
 conservatives threatened to form their own party
 following their defeat at the 1969 party congress.
 Only under Soviet pressure did the two groups
 agree to submerge their differences early this year
 and conduct a unified campaign for the parlia-
 mentary election held in March.
 Disenchantment with the establishment role
 played by the liberals in the government was
 reflected in the lowest voter support received by
 the party since 1945. The conservatives, laying
 sole responsibility for this setback on the liberals
 and eager to discredit them still further, resumed
 their campaign against the economic stabilization
 agreement, using even harsher and more vitriolic
 language.
 The liberals were stunned when the con-
 servatives went so far as to break party discipline
 in a government confidence vote on a bill clearing
 the way for extension of the agreement. They
 quickly denounced this action and have threat-
 ened to force the minority out of the party if it
 does not cease its violations of party law. The
 Soviets, determined to prevent such a develop-
 ment, have printed several articles in Trud and
 Pravda supporting the positions held by the con-
 servatives.
 So far, the liberals seem determined to retain
 control of the party and to pursue their role as a
 responsible coalition partner. They have been
 encouraged by the defection of some of the more
 prominent party members from the conservative
 group as the latter has hardened its stand. The
 Soviets, however, seem at present to be intent on
 bolstering the conservatives, even though this may
 lead to an event-jai Communist withdrawal from
 the government.
 POLAND - WEST GERMANY: After a week of

 Jordan: Cease-fire Faces Hardest Test
 Jcrdan entered the most hazardous phase of
 the cezse-fire period when the restrictions of the
 13 October agreement and protocol went into
 effect after 9 November. Most Jordanians are
 apprehensive that extremists on either side might
 provoke a renewal of the conflict. Fedayeen lead-
 ers and the government appear to be actively
 trying to reduce tensions, but recent incidents
 have demonstrated the ease with which trouble
 can erupt.
 The prime condition of the restrictions is
 that both the fedayeen and the army will end
 military operations in Jordanian towns and cities.
 Other provisions call for the issuance of I D cards,
 passes, and license plates as well as assigning loca-
 tions for arms caches and fedayeen bases. Unified
 fedayeen offices in Amman would be limited in
 number and personnel.
 The fedayeen failed to get a general delay of
 the deadline, although the Arab observers com-
 mission reported that an extension of "two or
 three days" had been granted for two towns near
 Amman.

 SECRET
 In some northern
 towns, minor incidents are occurring, as usual.
 The observer commission is fairly satisfied
 with fedayeen implementation of the agreements
 so far and is reasonably optimistic that local in-
 cidents will not spread. The observer teams, as-
 sisted  by joint  army-fedayeen  patrols,  have
 proved effective in coping with violations and
 limiting their spread.
 Premier Tal has sought to ameliorate rela-
 tions with Egypt and Iraq, two of his chief critics
 that might influence fedayeen attitudes. During a
 press conference, he supported the Egyptian re-
 newal of the Suez cease-fire, and denied that
 Jordan had sought the withdrawal of Iraqi troops.
 He vowed to uphold the October agreement,
 pointing out that it would benefit both the feda-
 yeen and the government, and went on to reiter-
 ate that Jordan's policy is to recover the West
 Bank from Israel, even by war if other means fail.
 The fedayeen have been equivocal; while
 generally expressing satisfaction with the agree-
 ments, Arafat and other leaders have predicted
 ultimately another round of fighting. The ob-
 server commission has lately begun to echo feda-
 yeen  expressions  of  apprehension  about  the
 army's intentions.
 The Bedouin troops' distrust of the Palestini-
 ans has been hardened by the reassertion of Major
 General Zaid bin Shakir's tough attitude toward
 the fedayeen. They also believe that they gained
 the whip hand during the fighting and intend to
 maintain it. At present, the army is probably in a
 stronger tactical position than the fedayeen, and
 it will be tempted to exploit this advantage. Pre-
 mier Wasfi Tal's most difficult test may prove to
 be whether he can-with the aid of the Arab
 observer teams-not merely maintain the peace
 but do so while holding the army's extremist
 elements in check without running afoul of the
 influence  that  the  troops  can exert on the
 King.
 Egypt-Libya-Sudan:
 The State of the Union
 Plans for the political, military, and eco-
 nomic integration of Egypt, Libya, and the Sudan
 were announced in Cairo this week, but they are
 likely to be implemented on a protracted sched-
 ule.
 The communique referred to steps to ex-
 pedite the union, but the leaders of the three
 countries are fully aware that popular opposition
 in Libya and the Sudan to Egyptian hegemony
 compels them to move cautiously. The new tri-
 partite command-made up of heads of state
 Sadat of Egypt,  Numayri of the Sudan, and
 Qaddafi of Libya-and the various subordinate
 planning committees will probably work with
 great deliberation in drawing up specific recom-
 mendations for implementing the Cairo Declara-
 tion. Judging from the modest steps toward inte-
 gration that have been taken in such areas as
 education and air transport since the three ar-
 ranged an alliance last December, tristate unity is
 apt to have more form than content for the
 foreseeable future.
 It is not yet clear what type of union is
 contemplated. The failure of the unitary state
 established between Syria and Egypt in 1958 is
 well remembered in Cairo, and any formal politi-
 cal entity is likely to be a much looser structure.
 If the agreement to form a political union is
 carried out ultimately, it will probably be only a
 nominal federation such as was set up between
 Egypt and Yemen in 1958.

 Tunisia: A New Government
 The new government installed last Friday is
 notable for its tecl-nical competence and for its
 loyalty to President Habib Bourguiba. Prime Min-
 ister Fledi Nouira, who heads the new cabinet, has
 long  been  influential  in  financial  policy.
 Bourguiba presumaoly regards Nouira's colorless
 persorality as no threat to his own charismatic
 appeal.
 Nouira, a lone-time militant of the ruling
 Destourian Socialist Party (PSD), has been a close
 advise- to the President for many years. He has
 few known enemies in either the party or the
 government, and during the past year avoided the
 factional infighting among potential presidential
 successors. A self-styled "progressive conserva-
 tive," Nouira won the respect of international
 financial circles while governor of the Central
 Bank :)f Tunisia. His honesty and incorruptibility
 have earned the confidence of Tunisian business
 and 13bor circles, but he has little following
 among the youth.
 Nouira replaces Bahi Ladgham, who had
 been Tunisia's second-ranking official since in-
 cooperation with Libya will provide easier access
 to Tripoli's oil-rich coffers.
 Numayri and Qaddafi, who revered Nasir,
 appear to be sincere in their advocacy of more
 substantive Arab unity. The two Arab leaders
 may also hope that closer identification with
 Egypt  will  strengthen  their  somewhat shaky
 domestic positions. This strategy may backfire,
 however, by further antagonizing those Libyans

 juntas, who would chafe at excessive Egyptian
 meddling in their affairs. To some Arabs, in fact,

 Africe: New Cull for Black- White Talks
 Ivorian President Houphouet-Boigny is try-
 ing to aromote a dialogue between white-ruled
 southern Africa and he rest of the continent. By
 embarking on such a course, Houphouet is likely
 to deepen the split between militant and prag-
 matic  African governments on the southern
 Africa issue.
 Houphouet has long believed that unbending
 hostility toward South Africa is futile and that
 Pretoria's policies cannot be changed by force.
 Houphcuet's fear of Communist influence in cen-
 tral anc east Africa is probably also a factor in
 motivating him to -hake a move that will be
 unpopular among many Africans, including many
 of his fellow countrymen.
 The Ivory Coast President has called for an
 African summit conference to consider a peaceful
 approach to the problems of Portuguese colonial-
 ism, white-rule in Rhodesia, and apartheid in
 South Africa. Prior to this conference, his govern-
 ment would contact all heads of state to push a
 policy of negotiation toward the "white redoubt"
 states.
 Any genuine dialogue between white and
 black Africa, however, is still a long way off at
 best. Militant African governments, as well as
 some moderate ones, have been quick to voice
 strong opposition to the move while many other
 countries will simply dissociate themselves or re-
 main silent. The mil tants, notably Tanzania and
 Zambia, have been the chief supporters of the
 southern liberation movements and have spon-
 sored increasingly extreme resolutions in interna-
 tional forums. At this time, it seems certain that a
 majority of the 41 members of the Organization
 of African Unity will not be willing to join Hou-
 phouet s "crusade."
 Response  from  a  few  of the moderate
 French-speaking states has been favorable. Mala-
 gasy  President Tsiranana immediately hailed
 Houphouet's initiative, while the Malagasy Gov-
 ernment announced that the South African for-
 eign minister will visit Tananarive later this month
 to conclude economic agreements. Presidents
 Bongo of Gabon and Maga of Dahomey have
 expressed guarded approval. Endorsements by
 other former French dependencies may follow
 should Paris, which has long favored improved
 contacts with South Africa, push actively for the
 new approach. Paris may be hesitant at this time,
 however, because it has just succeeded in pla-
 cating some of the more militant African coun-
 tries by tightening its arms embargo against South
 Africa.
 Among English-speaking leaders, President
 Banda of Malawi, who has long cast himself as a
 "bridge builder" between white and black Africa,
 has welcomed Houphouet's move as a vindication
 of his policy. Malawi, which is economically de-
 pendent on its white-ruled neighbors, is the only
 black African state that has formal diplomatic
 relations with Pretoria. Botswana, Swaziland, and
 Lesotho, which by geographical necessity must
 also deal with South Africa, are likely to give at
 least qualified support to Houphouet's initiative.
 Ghana's prime minister is already on record as
 favoring such a policy, although other Ghanaian
 leaders are clearly less enthusiastic.
 In South Africa, the development has been
 roundly  acclaimed.  Both  the  Afrikaner  and
 English  press have  reacted  euphorically to
 Houphouet's  statements,  which have given a
 timely boost to Prime Minister Vorster's "out-
 ward looking" policy of cultivating relations with
 black states. Political circles in Pretoria are al-
 ready interpreting the Ivorian President's move as
 a "first step" toward diplomatic recognition of
 South Africa-a development that Houphouet has
 explicitly ruled out for Ivory Coast, at least for

 Angola: No End of Insurgency in Sight
 The two principal insurgent organizations in
 Angola are showing new tactics and strengths.
 The Portuguese are conducting successful opera-
 tions of their own, however, and the nine-year-old
 insurgency seems likely to drag on indefinitely.
 The most noticeable changes in the fighting
 have occurred in eastern Angola, where the pro-
 Soviet Popular Movement for the Liberation of
 Angola (MPLA) is the primary guerrilla threat. In
 recent months, the MPLA, which has 3,000-4,000
 armed guerrillas inside Angola, has concentrated
 on breaking out of the sparsely populated east,
 where there are few strategic Portuguese targets,
 toward the heavily populated center.
 The second major insurgent organization is
 Holden Roberto's Angolan Revolutionary Gov-
 ernment in Exile (GRAE). Its 3,000-4,000-man
 force inside Angola operates out of bases in the
 Congo (Kinshasa) and has long been the predomi-
 nant group in northwestern Angola. Out of favor
 with the African and Communist states that pro-
 vide most of the assistance to the insurgent move-
 ments, however, GRAE usually fielded poorly
 trained and inadequately armed guerrillas.
 Early this year, GRAE began receiving siz-
 ahle quantities of modern arms
 UNC
 and started its
 most substantial offensive in several years. Al-
 though Portuguese forces soon put it on the de-
 fensive again in the northwest, GRAE guerrilla
 units in eastern Angola carried out a few rather
 spectacular attacks. In fact, GRAE is at least
 temporarily challenging the MPLA as the strong-
 est insurgent force along the northern edge of the
 guerrilla-affected area in the east.
 The Portuguese, for their part, followed up
 their success in the northwest with effective
 search-and-destroy operations last August in heav-
 ily infested MPLA areas of the east. More troops
 and new helicopters enabled the Portuguese to
 initiate airborne assaults against the MPLA camps.
 Sizable quantities of supplies were destroyed and
 guerrilla units in these areas were disorganized
 and kept on the move.
 Although the guerrilla groups can point to
 some successes, they have serious obstacles to
 overcome. GRAE guerrillas are still hamstrung by
 shortages of modern small arms and by restric-
 tions placed on their activities by the Congo (Kin-
 shasa) Government, which fears Portuguese repris-
 als for giving sanctuary to the guerrillas. The
 MPLA has adequate arms supplies, but it still

 compounded these difficulties by disrupting sup-
 ply lines near the border. Several years ago, a  25X1
 strong MPLA force reached the northwest from
 Congo (Brazzaville), but has withered because no

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Chile: New Government Tests the Water
 During its first full week in office, the Al-
 lende government prepared cautiously to intro-
 duce many of the promised new foreign and do-
 mestic policies.
 Foreign Minister Clodomiro Almeyda toned
 down his outspokenly extremist views in his first
 officia press performances- Well known for his
 sympa_hy toward Havana and Peking, Almeyda
 said a-nong other things that although he and
 Allende both still sympathize with revolution-
 aries, their attitude as government officials would
 necessarily be different from past statements.
 Almeyda refused to express his characteristic dis-
 like of the US. and the embassy in Santiago
 believes that his performance is part of an ex-
 tensive effort by the new administration to create
 a "responsible" image on the international scene.
 Almeyda told the US ambassador during a
 courtesy call that the recognition of Cuba, an-
 nounced on 12 November, would be implemented
 as a result of his talks with Cuban cabinet minis-
 ter Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, head of the most
 numerous and impressive of the many unofficial
 delegations to Allende's inauguration. The delega-
 tion was part of a current show of closer ties with
 Cuba, including the unveiling of a larger-than-life
 statue of Che Guevara, the visit of a Cuban
 freighter, and television and commercial displays.
 The public reFort of Allende's first cabinet
 meeting on 9 November leaned heavily on fulfill-
 ment of such popular promises as emergency
 housing measures, free milk for all children by 1
 December, improving distribution of the social
 security benefits that most Chileans receive, and a
 crackdown on price increases. Although it was
 announced that an extensive analysis of the econ-
 omy was presented, no specific economic plans
 emerged from the meeting. Allende complained
 that the "harsh legacy of capitalism" that he had
 inherited, including a 34.1-percent cost-of-living
 increase in the first ten months of 1970, pre-
 sented major problems. He promised that the
 traditional year-end wage adjustments would
 favor the lowest income groups.
 Also present at the cabinet meeting was the
 Popular Unity (UP) Political Committee, com-
 posed of the leaders of the six parties in the
 coalition. This was in line with Allende's promise
 to maintain "political pluralism" in his govern-
 ment but, in effect, was more attendance than
 participation. With Communists and Socialists in-
 stalled in positions of control throughout the
 administration, some non-Marxist collaborators
 are beginning to complain publicly about their
 lack of influence.
 The UP is finding other key Chileans to
 speak in its favor. Cardinal Silva told Cuban inter-
 viewers on 9 November that the Chilean Church
 supported the fundamental reforms proposed by
 the UP. On the same day the Chilean delegate to a
 banking congress in Mexico City said that private
 banking organizations were cooperating exten-
 sively with the new government. This may indi-
 cate that the government is trying to reassure
 bankers that accommodation will pay. It may be
 using the same line toward the mining industry,
 its other immediate major nationalization target.
 Other Allende opponents are finding it con-
 venient to accommodate to his government. The
 editorial line of the prestigious daily El Mercurio
 is beginning to reflect the shift in control to a
 pro-Allende member of the Edwards family from
 its former owner, who has left Chile.

 Bolivia: Urban Terrorism May Increase
 The National Liberation Army (ELN) may
 give greater emphasis to urban warfare as a result
 of its serious losses in rural guerrilla warfare since
 July.
 The training by the Tupamaros is another
 indication of foreign participation in ELN activi-
 ties. In July the ELN published a list of its foreign
 members, including Chileans, Brazilians, Peru-
 vians, and at least one Argentine. Several of those
 named were later killed or captured in army
 clashes with the guerrillas. Three Chileans were
 among the six ELN members who surrendered to
 a Bolivian peace commission and were granted
 asylum in Chile. The ELN is known to have
 solicited  support  from  several  revolutionary
 groups in South America. A Chilean committee to
 support the ELN has been in existence for nearly
 a year.
 A concentration on urban warfare probably
 would be a temporary shift in tactics rather than
 a rejection of rural activities. Within the past few
 months, ELN propaganda has been giving more
 notice to the urban struggle. Published statements
 now warn that the ELN will "fight to final
 victory in the mountains and the cities." Earlier
 statements did not refer to urban activities.
 To date, the ELN has demonstrated a lim-
 ited capability in urban operations. It robbed a
 payroll truck in La Paz in December 1969, but
 lost several of its trained guerrilla personnel. The
 group has carried out well-publicized murders of
 several of its political opponents in the past 18
 months. In one case the alleged murderers have
 been apprehended. The ELN is probably respon-
 sible also for some of the bombings that oc-
 casionally occur in La Paz.

 Communal Politics
 In Malaysia:
 The Search For A New Beginning
 With the resignation last month of Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman and the installa-
 tion of a new cabinet headed by the Tunku's long-time deputy and heir apparent, Tun Abdul
 Razak, Malaysia is approaching the end of the emergency rule imposed after the racial
 conflagration of May 1969. These political ceremonies predictably were accompanied by public
 expressions of confidence and national reconciliation. Despite the brave words, however,
 everyone in Kuala Lumpur is painfully aware of the bitter legacy of 1969, and no one is under
 the illusion that the political life of the nation can simply be picked up where it left off some 18
 months ago. On the contrary, the ruling Alliance Party, its previous policies discredited and its
 new leadership a question mark, is venturing into political no-man's land without enthusiastic
 support from any significant quarter.
 The government's uncomfortable position is a direct result of the national elections of May
 1969 and the days of anti-Chinese violence that followed. The basic contradiction between the
 concept of Malay political supremacy and the government's liberal, democratic posture finally
 surfaced; the Chinese and Malay communities backed away from each other and any meaningful
 dialogue. Since then, the alienation of the two communities from each other and from their
 government has grown. The ruling Alliance Party, with its communal policy of moderation,
 compromise, and, at times, hesitation, has been left high and dry. Under these difficult
 circumstances, it is somewhat surprising, but hopeful, that the government has opted for a
 gradual return to the pitfalls and uncertainties of open political life. Malays backed the
 imposition of emergency rule and would undoubtedly favor its continuation if they were
 convinced that the government was ready to adopt strong pro-Malay policies. The moderate
 Malay leadership, however, has chosen a different and far more hazardous road. The government
 must recapture its disaffected Malay constituency and at the same time find a way to halt the
 mounting alienation of the Chinese community. Given the political and social vise in which the
 government finds itself, the rebuilding of some form of multiracial political system will be
 difficult. Whether the new government can muster the wisdom, skill, and strength to keep its
 balance remains very much an open question. The good intentions of Tun Razak and his
 lieutenants will not by themselves be enough. There is a seeming willingness on the part of all
 parties, however, to let the new Razak government have a fair chance to succeed.

 The Underlying Reality of Malay Nationalism
 Widespread Malay disenchantment with the
 United Malay Nat!onal Organization (UMNO), the
 principal component of the ruling Alliance Party,
 is at present the single most important reality of
 Malaysian political life. UMNO leadership, com-
 plair,                 the  Malay;, has  not done enough  to
 strengthen their "special position" in their native
 land They argue that the time has come to rec-
 oncile  the Chinese community to the fact that
 ultimate political power in Malaysia is a Malay
 prerogative and that this power will be used to
 obtain for the Malay a proper share of the na-
 tion's wealth. If this can be done at no significant
 expense to Chinese interests, all the better. But if
 not, they contend, the Chinese will simply have
 to pay the price required to remain in a Malay
 land. Any assessment of the political situation in
 Malaysia must take into account this new Malay
 assertiveness and its implications for the future
 direction of events.
 Since Malayan independence in 1957, politi-
 cal power has been held by a handful of Malay
 elite, molded by English education and tradition,
 and dominated by Tunku Abdul Rahman. Al-
 though the Tunku and his colleagues expected
 non-Malays to accept voluntarily the dominant
 polit cal position of the Malay, they preferred to
 down-play this to ichy subject and to emphasize
 the concept of a multiracial democracy in which
 the political, economic, and cultural rights of all
 citizens are protected. Under this style of leader-
 ship Malaysia became known as a model of com-
 munal and political stability; but, in retrospect,
 one suspects that the unifying effect of two suc-
 cessive  security threats-the  Communist
 emergency of the 1950s, and the Indonesian con-
 frontation of 1962-65-was in large part responsi-
 ble for Malaysia's enviable record. At any rate,
 Malay discontent with the government's even-
 handed communal policy was always near the
 surface. As they became more and more embit-
 tered and frustrated over their inability to over-
 come the legacy of centuries of feudalism, pov-
 erty, and ignorance, growing numbers of Malays
 Special Report                                  -2-
 SECRET
 came to see the Tunku's highly publicized British
 sense of fair play as evidence of treachery and
 betrayal of their interests.
 Obscured by the nation's over-all economic
 growth and prosperity and the Tunku's tendency
 to dismiss signs of unrest as the work of a few
 "ultras" or extremists, the depth of Malay disaf-
 fection went unnoticed until the parliamentary
 elections of May 1969 and the ensuing anti-
 Chinese violence. Although much has been made
 of the unexpected success of Chinese opposition
 parties in the 1969 election, gains by the Pan-
 Malayan Islamic Party (PMIP), a small right-wing
 party harshly critical of the government's "soft"
 approach toward the Chinese, were actually more
 significant. The PMIP captured three UMNO
 seats, but far more importantly, it captured over
 40 percent of the total Malay vote. The UMNO
 managed to retain a comfortable majority of
 Malay seats, but it had come close to electoral
 disaster. In the past eighteen months the UMNO's
 foundations within the Malay community have
 continued to erode, and today few observers
 would care to place much money on the party in
 a head-on test of strength with the PMIP. Pres-
 ently, the government is refusing to schedule two
 overdue parliamentary by-elections in Selangor
 and Malacca because its own private survey in-
 dicates that both seats, now held by UMNO,
 would fall to the PMIP.
 What all of this means is that the top eche-
 lon of UMNO is no longer in a position to dismiss
 Malay criticism of its communal policies as the
 reaction of a few "ultras." Indeed the term
 "ultra" has probably lost much of what meaning
 it ever enjoyed in the Malaysian political lexicon.
 Although  nationalist  Malay  opinion  may  be
 judged "ultra" or extremist by an absolute stand-
 ard, it is by no means limited to the PMIP. It
 presently runs the breadth and depth of the
 Malay community, including UMNO itself.
 In the past UMNO has been run in an ex-
 tremely authoritarian manner; the views of the
 top echelon were simply imposed on the rank and

 %WV        SECRET
 file. Many senior officials of UMNO, although
 perhaps not sharing the PMIP's desire for a rigid
 Islamic state, have sympathized with the PMIP's
 blunt pro-Malay posture. At the Kampong level it
 would probably be quite difficult to distinguish
 the politics of the local UMNO organizer from
 those of his PMIP counterpart. In the future there
 is likely to be much more give-and-take between
 Razak and these secondary echelons of UMNO,
 long ignored by the Tunku. The top leadership is
 bound under the existing political circumstances,
 to become more receptive and vulnerable to pres-
 sure from below.
 Identifying the specific sources of such pres-
 sure is not easy, because Malay nationalists within
 and outside UMNO have always been short of
 forceful and articulate spokesmen. Perhaps the
 single most important figure to watch in the
 coming days is Data Harun bin Idris, a senior
 UMNO official and chief minister of Selangor.
 Although apparently loyal to Razak, Harun has
 been an outspoken critic of UMNO's communal
 policies and has lines out to Young Turks in
 UMNO and the military. In May 1969, Harun
 delivered a fire-eating speech to a large assembly
 of young Malays in Kuala Lumpur-one of the
 developments that led directly to the anti-Chinese
 rioting.
 Another Malay nationalist who may assume
 a position of influence is Musa bin Hitam, a
 former assistant minister to Razak. Following the
 May 1969 riots, Musa openly advocated the re
 tirement or dismissal of the Tunku and was as a
 result relieved of his assistant ministership. Sub-
 sequently, Musa went to London to study, but
 when the Tunku announced in August that he
 intended to retire, Musa quickly reappeared in
 Kuala Lumpur. There is an air of vindication in
 Musa's sudden return
 Another Malay
 requently identified as an "ultra" leader is Dr.
 Mahathir bin Mohamed, a 45-year-old physician
 from Kedah. Mahathir was known in mid-1969
 for his opposition to the Tunku, and for this was
 Special Report
 dismissed from the central executive committee
 of UMNO and later from UMNO itself. In addi-
 tion to practicing medicine, Dr. Mahathir is a
 journalist and has frequently contributed articles
 on Malays and politics to various Malaysian publi-
 cations under the pseudonym of C. H. E. Det.
 Mahathir  is  also  the author of "The Malay
 Dilemma" published in Singapore in 1970 and
 banned in Malaysia. In this book Mahathir points
 out the essential differences in background, cul-
 ture, political systems, and acquisitiveness be-
 tween the Chinese and Malays. Because of these
 factors, he questions whether the Malays could
 ever compete with the Chinese on an equal basis
 and suggests that the only way to close the eco-
 nomic gap is for the government to weigh the
 scales heavily in favor of the Malays. Mahathir has
 been generally politically inactive since his expul-
 sion from UMNO, but he remains a potential
 leader of those favoring Malay supremacy.
 Another influential channel of Malay na-
 tionalism is "Utusan Melayu," the UMNO's unof-
 ficial press organ. The Jawi script edition of
 "Utusan Melayu" enjoys by far the largest circula-
 tion of any newspaper in Malaysia and is widely
 read at the Kampong level. For years, "Utusan
 Melayu" has been notorious for its chauvinistic
 Malay tone-a fact that kept its UMNO editors
 perpetually in the Tunku's doghouse. Last spring,
 for instance, "Utusan Melayu" raised the Tunku's
 ire by implying that the Malay military establish-
 ment might take over the government and do a
 better job of protecting Malay interests than the
 previous administration. In the months ahead the
 restraint or excess of "Utusan Melayu" polemics
 may shed some light on the degree of nationalist
 sentiment and influence within UMNO and the
 new government.
 Another barometer of nationalist pressure is
 the Malay university student. One of the most
 dramatic indicators of the change in political
 climate in Malaysia has been the radicalization of
 the Malay student movement and its turn toward
 political activism. In the past, student politics
 were dominated by the University of Malaya

 movement will retain. The vision of some of the
 movement's more ambitious leaders that Malay
 students will assume the same influential role
 played by Indonesian youth during and following
 the overthrow of Sukarno seems highly unreal-
 istic. Malay students do offer an enticing vehicle
 for opportunistic Malay   oliticians
 Student Union, a left-of-center, multiracial organ-
 ization with little real strength or appeal. Follow-
 ing the events of May 1969 it was quickly pushed
 into the background by the Malay Language
 Society, which soon gained a degree of national
 polit cal importance as the spearhead of the effort
 to force the Tunku's resignation. Student agita-
 tion against the prime minister, ignored by the
 Tunku himself, was a source of serious embarrass-
 ment for the government, even though demon-
 strations were usially confined to the campus
 premises.
 Now that the students' prime objectives have
 been achieved, it is uncertain what impetus their
 Special Report
 Perhaps the most significant Malay interest
 group is the military. The Malaysian military es-
 tablishment, through its participation in the emer-
 gency government, has for the past year and a
 half been involved in political affairs to an un-
 precedented degree. How and to what degree the
 military has sought to influence political decisions
 up to now is unclear. There is little question,
 however, that the military establishment reflects
 parochial Malay interests. Regardless of the politi-
 cal role the military chooses or is forced by cir-
 cumstances to assume, it is likely to remain an
 instrument of Malay nationalism.
 The top command structure of the armed
 forces is dominated by Malays as are the 12 royal
 Malay regiments, the backbone of the Malaysian
 Army. Aware of the Maoist adage that political
 power grows out of the barrel of a gun, the
 government has carefully preserved the exclusive
 Malay make-up of the regiments as a symbol of
 Malay political supremacy.
 ~ The rank
 and file of the regiments are recruited from Malay
 peasant stock and are narrowly racist in outlook.
 Depending on which accounts are believed, the
 regiments at best did little to curtail the anti-
 Chinese violence of May 1969 and, at worst,
 actively participated in it.
 Presently the top command structure of the
 military is dominated by the "Johore clique," a
 close-knit and influential association of senior and
 junior officers connected by marriage and place

 of birth. The Armed Forces Chief of Staff, Gen-
 eral Ibrahim, is the number-one member of the
 group. For the past year and a half Ibrahim has
 also been an influential member of the National
 Operations Council (NOC), the executive organ of
 the emergency government. Although he is not
 politically ambitious, he possibly could be per-
 suaded at some crisis point that military interven-
 tion might be needed to "save the nation." Of the
 63 top positions in the armed forces-from gen-
 eral down through colonel, including navy and air
 force equivalent   ranks-the  "Johore  clique"
 holds approximately 20 percent. The individual
 and collective influence of this group of like-
 minded, closely associated officers even though it
 has no formal organization is unrivaled within the
 military. Another key figure associated with the
 "Johore clique" is the army commander, General
 Nazaruddin,  who  comes from Pohang.  Naza-
 ruddin is known to hold and to have openly
 expressed strong Malay nationalist views. None of
 this means that the military establishment is dis-
 loyal to Razak. On the contrary, the new prime
 minister is generally regarded as the civilian poli-
 tician most favorable to the military's desires and
 aspirations.
 There is a deadly symmetry at work today in
 Malaysian politics. If the government faces a hard-
 ening of Malay communal feeling and diminished
 support within the Malay community, its prob-
 lems and prospects on the Chinese front are at
 least as grim. Essentially the government is con-
 fronted  with  Chinese  rejection  of the time-
 honored Malaysian recipe for political and social
 stability. This traditional formula tacitly provided
 for Malay political domination and special priv-
 ileges in such areas as government jobs, education,
 and land ownership in return for which the Chi-
 nese would be awarded citizenship. The political
 vehicle for this arrangement between the Malay
 and Chinese establishments was an "Alliance" in
 which UMNO shared political power on a token
 basis with its client party, the Malaysian Chinese
 Association (MCA). Chinese voting strength was
 Special Report
 restricted by the assignment of disproportionally
 heavy representation to rural Malay districts and
 by the MCA's willingness to contest only a
 mutually agreed-upon number of "Chinese" par-
 liamentary seats.
 The Alliance arrangement, in other words,
 was based on a racial myth-that Chinese don't
 mind who owns the cow as long as they can milk
 it. This myth has achieved considerable currency
 in Southeast Asia because of the remarkable
 ability of the outnumbered Chinese to make
 necessity a virtue. In Malaysia, however, where
 Chinese are roughly equal to Malays in number, it
 has been wearing thin for a long time. No longer
 willing to limit voluntarily their political leverage
 for the sake of communal harmony, the younger
 generations of Chinese have become increasingly
 dissatisfied with the leadership of the MCA. More-
 over, the Chinese, seemingly more aware of grow-
 ing Malay nationalist sentiment than the govern-
 ment itself, have come to view the full exercise of
 their political rights as the best means to protect
 themselves and. their hard-earned economic posi-
 tion from eventual Malay encroachment and sup-
 pression.  The  expulsion  of  Singapore  from
 Malaysia in 1965-the result of Lee Kuan Yew's
 attempt to extend his political organization to
 Malaysia and offer an alternative to MCA repre-
 sentation-served as a catalyst for this growing
 Chinese political restiveness. The full force of
 Chinese discontent was dramatically reflected in
 the strong showing of two relatively new and
 underorganized Chinese opposition parties in the
 elections of May 1969. The Democratic Action
 Party (DAP) and Gerakan captured between them
 nearly a fifth of parliament's seats, winning in the
 process 14 of the 27 seats formerly held by the
 MCA.
 At present, the DAP and Gerakan are taking
 a cautious approach to the resumption of political
 activity, concentrating on repairing the damage
 done to their organizations by the last year and a
 half of inactivity. Eventually, however, both par-
 ties intend to get on with the job of building a
 base of support throughout West Malaysia. In this

 effort, the DAP, which ran ahead of Gerakan in
 the elections, will probably make the greatest
 gains.
 The DAP, spiritual descendent of the Peo-
 ple's  Action  Party  (PAP)  of Singapore, was
 formed  after Singapore's expulsion from the
 Federation. Although the DAP ostensibly opposes
 racial politics, a very definite tone of Chinese
 chauvinism creeps into its noncommunalism. The
 party calls for democracy "with no precondi-
 tions" and multilingualism in education and gov-
 ernment. It views Malay royalty as a feudal drag
 on the nation and condemns the system of special
 Malay privileges incorporated into the constitu-
 tion as an example of the paternalism that has
 kept the Malay in a backward economic condi-
 tion. The DAP does not participate in the Na-
 tional Consultative Council (NCC), an appendage
 of the emergency government set up to consider
 the problem of national reconciliation, because
 the government refused to accredit the DAP
 candidate, who was then in jail. The party's press
 releases during emergency rule, the only form of
 political activity allowed, remained strident, how-
 ever, and there is no indication that the DAP is
 now prepared to back away significantly from its
 strong opposition to the government.
 The DAP's platform is without doubt an
 accurate reflection of popular Chinese opinion.
 Yet it could be a tragedy of the first order if the
 party continues to grow in appeal and becomes
 the clear-cut choice of the Chinese electorate. To
 the government, the DAP is anathema. It strongly
 suspects that the party's strings are pulled from
 Singapore, although there is no foundation to this
 as far as is known. Further, the government con-
 siders, with a certain degree of justification, that
 the DAP is. an unreconcilable agent of communal
 divisiveness. At the moment it is impossible to
 imagine any cooperation between the DAP and
 the Razak government or any other future Malay
 government.
 The Gerakan Party shares the democratic
 socialist precepts of the DAP and many of its
 Special Report
 communal views, but it has adopted a far dif-
 ferent tactical approach to political survival in a
 Malay-dominated state. Although it remains es-
 sentially a Chinese party, it has made a genuine
 effort to assume a multiracial character and has
 been moderately successful in attracting non-
 Chinese recruits. Unlike the DAP, Gerakan has
 adopted a cooperative posture and has gone out
 of its way to avoid antagonizing the government.
 The party participated in the proceedings of the
 NCC and last summer was seriously considering a
 government invitation to move into the Alliance
 and take part in the new cabinet.
 Gerakan discovered, however, that its policy
 of cooperation was weakening its support within
 the Chinese community, one more indication of
 the polarization of communal feeling in Malaysia.
 This, plus the realization that the new Razak
 government will be emphasizing Malay benefits
 rather than concessions to the Chinese com-
 munity, forced Gerakan to the conclusion that
 collaboration with the government would amount
 to political suicide. In late August the party with-
 drew from its discussion with the government;
 Gerakan participation in the Alliance now seems a
 dead letter. As political activity gets under way
 again, Gerakan is likely to move a little closer to
 the DAP position and to the center of Chinese
 opinion.
 This  leaves  the  government  holding  an
 empty bag. Although the MCA still functions as
 the Chinese component of the Alliance, it is po-
 litically bankru
 The MCA's leader,
 Finance Minister Tan Siew-Sin, has publicly ad-
 mitted that he can no longer speak for the Chi-
 nese masses, a candid statement that has caused
 the government considerable embarrassment. Al-
 though talk is still heard of pumping new blood
 into the MCA, there seems small chance that it
 will be resuscitated to any significant degree.
 The government's abortive attempt to bring
 Gerakan into the Alliance clearly indicates the

 moc'erate Malay leadership's awareness of the
 need to provide for more meaningful Chinese
 participation and representation in the govern-
 ment. Given the present degree of communal
 polarization, however, there is no readily appar-
 ent solution to this problem. As a result, Razak
 repcrtedly is said to be considering scrapping the
 Alliance in favor of a single integrated party open
 to all races. Although such a move could be a first
 step toward repudiation of communal politics in
 Malaysia, it is not likely to solve the government's
 immediate racial problems. The evolution of a
 truly multiracial and democratic party will be a
 slow process at best. For the time being any new
 government party would be dominated by the
 former UMNO leadership; the problem of attract-
 ing meaningful Chinese participation would not
 be significantly lessened.
 Perhaps one limited move in the right direc-
 tion would be to seek an improvement in rela-
 tions with the Singapore government of Lee Kuan
 Yew.  Lee  remE ins  a  popular  figure  among
 Malzysian Chinese, and even his indirect endorse-
 ment of the new Razak government might help
 reduce Chinese alienation and apprehension. It
 will be difficult for the government to move in
 this direction, however. Last August, Lee can-
 celed his first trip to Malaysia since Singapore left
 the Federation after Kuala Lumpur had reacted
 bitterly to a trivial incident between Singapore
 police and a group of visiting Malaysian hippies-a
 good example of the role paranoia and suspicion
 still  play  in  Malaysian-Singapore  relations.
 Cosying up to Lee would also be likely to
 exacerbate tensions between moderate and radical
 Malay elements, and, in fact, there has been no
 visible extension of an olive branch in Lee's di-
 rection.
 The caliber and stability of the government
 caught within this communal vise is difficult to
 judge. The greatest unknown is Tun Razak him-
 self. Although groomed for years as the heir ap-
 parent,  Razak  never  developed  any  of                         the
 Special Report
 SECRET
 Tunku's charisma or shared any of the respect
 enjoyed by the Tunku within the non-Malay
 population. Following the May 1969 .riots, when
 the Tunku went into a period of semi-retirement,
 Razak disappointed nearly everyone with his in-
 decisive leadership. Now, out from under both
 the inhibiting influence and the protection of the
 former prime minister, Razak will have to prove
 himself equal to the difficult tasks ahead. Fortu-
 nately he will have the able assistance of the
 Deputy Premier and Home Affairs Minister Tun
 Dr. Ismail. Ismail is without question the most
 effective and widely respected politician in the
 government.
 The most interesting aspect of the new
 cabinet is the central role to be played by Ghazali
 bin Shafie, formerly the permanent secretary of
 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Ghazali was ap-
 pointed to the senate last month in order to make
 him eligible for a cabinet position. As minister
 "with special functions" he has been given the
 crucial task of coordinating and implementing the
 government's efforts to restore national unity and
 to expand Malay participation in the nation's
 economic  life.  Ghazali's  performance  in this
 crucially delicate role is presently a matter of
 great conjecture in Kuala Lumpur. An oppor-
 tunist  with  long-standing  political  ambitions,
 Ghazali in the past has oscillated between the
 camps of Malay moderates and chauvinists.
 Although a long-standing member of UMNO, his
 entry into the cabinet via the back door has
 already raised the hackles of a number of UMNO
 politicians.
 After Razak, Ismail, and Ghazali, there is
 little to be said about the new cabinet members.

 A lack of leadersh p depth is a real problem for
 the Razak government just as it was for its prede-
 cessor. Largely because of the authoritarian man-
 ner in which UMNO has been run in the past,
 adequate second-level leadership simply has not
 developed. Ghazali bin Shafie, for example, has
 for years been cons:dered the only young "up and
 comer" in UMNO worth mentioning.
 Razak has brought two other Malays into his
 cabinet. Education Minister Hussein bin Onn is
 distinguished mainly by his loyalty to Razak, but
 he is regarded as a racial moderate and brings into
 the cabinet the magic of the Onn name-his father
 was the founder of UMNO. The other Malay is
 Mohamed Khir bin Johari, the minister of com-
 merce and industry. Although Khir has somewhat
 blotted his copybook as former minister of educa-
 tion and as UMNO nanager of the 1969 elections,
 he nonetheless has the ear of the UMNO Execu-
 tive Committee. If Tun Dr. Ismail
 hor,id become unable to continue
 to serve as deputy prime minister, Khir could lay
 stronc claim to that position, probably with the
 support of the party hierarchy. Razak and Khir
 25X1     are nct particularly close, however
 Only one member of the previous cabinet
 was dropped from the new one, an MCA minister
 whose notorious corruption had become an in-
 tolerable burden fcr the government. The cabinet
 thus remains loaded with ministers closely as-
 sociated with the Tunku. Most of them will even-
 tually go as Razak seeks to give his new govern-
 ment a more dynamic character. The timing of
 their departure, however, may depend at least in
 part on how much influence the Tunku can still
 exert or intends .o exert from his retirement
 residence in Kuala Lumpur. Most observers be-
 lieve that there will be no further cabinet changes
 until after parliament convenes in February..
 Future Policy Directions:
 Political Restrictions and Malay Benefits
 Although the caliber of the new leadership
 remai-is a questior mark, its modus operandi is
 Special Report
 slowly emerging. First of all, the government is
 intent on preventing another round of racial vio-
 lence. There are still clear signs of underlying
 communal tension in Kuala Lumpur and large
 numbers of police still patrol the streets, but in
 most aspects life has long since returned to
 normal, and the government has been remarkably
 successful in preventing inevitable minor racial
 incidents from turning into serious trouble.
 Aside from effective police work, the gov-
 ernment has attributed its success in maintaining
 order to the absence of communal polemics
 during the past year and a half of emergency rule.
 Accordingly, it is in no hurry to give up all of its
 emergency powers. Razak has pledged that parlia-
 ment will once more be the supreme political
 authority when it reconvenes next February. The
 National Operations Council will be abolished and
 a new "National Security Council" established.
 This group will be concerned with both internal
 and external security matters, and, as planned,
 would be an advisory group only, with neither
 executive nor legislative authority. The govern-
 ment, in conjunction with the return to open
 political life, has, however, placed extensive re-
 strictions on future political debate. In essence
 the restrictions forbid public discussion of the
 provisions of the constitution relating to citizen-
 ship, national language, Malay rights and benefits,
 and the sovereignty of Malay rulers. The govern-
 ment is empowered to proscribe entire political
 organizations that habitually violate these restric-
 tions. Going one step further, when parliament
 reconvenes in February, it will be greeted by a
 government-sponsored constitutional amendment
 removing the members' parliamentary immunity
 from punishment for infractions of the new re-
 strictions on political debate.
 The essence of the government's position
 seems to be that Malays cannot be pacified if
 non-Malays are allowed to question the political
 status quo; the curbing of political debate is
 necessary to prevent a recurrence of the May
 1969 disturbances. Nevertheless, it is hard to
 escape the conclusion that the restrictions are also
 designed to handcuff or possibly destroy the gov-
 ernment's  Chinese  opposition.  If  the  new

 restrictions are given a broad interpretation, the
 public platform of the DAP will for all practical
 purposes be swept away. Needless to say, this has
 given a somewhat hollow ring to the resumption
 of open political activity and the convening of
 parliament. Public reaction thus far has been re-
 strained, but resentment is bound to grow and
 could reach a dangerous level if the government is
 tempted to use the restrictions as an outright
 weapon of political suppression. Whether in the
 long run the restrictions will help achieve their
 stated objective of racial peace remains very much
 an open question.
 As the curbs on political debate suggest,
 future domestic policy will have a pro-Malay cast.
 This, of course, has been a foregone conclusion.
 Razak and his colleagues are, after all, Malay
 politicians, and their Malay constituency must be
 recaptured, soothed, and reassured if the present
 government is to survive. Unanswered are the
 questions, can the government achieve this end
 and maintain its balance in the process, and how
 far will it be willing to go in satisfying Malay
 aspirations at the expense of Chinese interests?
 In the sensitive area of language policy the
 government has already made its move. Beginning
 this year English-track schools in the Malaysian
 educational system will start to convert to Malay,
 on a stair-step basis. In 1986, English instruction
 at the fourth-year university level will end, thus
 completing the process. This action has not fully
 satisfied Malay opinion but hopefully will be ac-
 cepted as a step in the right direction. Many
 Malays are unhappy that similar action was not
 taken in regard to Chinese-track schools. The
 Chinese are more unhappy. They have been the
 primary user of the English-track system, but,
 more important, they view the government's ac-
 tions as being the prelude to Malayanization of
 the Chinese school system. The government's ac-
 tion has been tempered, however, by a recent
 official statement that implied that scientific and
 technical subjects will still be taught in the ap-
 propriate  language--generally  interpreted  as
 English.
 Special Report
 The compromise decision to scale down in-
 struction in English has allowed the government
 to maintain a degree of communal balance in its
 educational policy and still satisfy nationalistic
 Malay interests. In doing so, however, the govern-
 ment ironically has undermined more important
 long-term Malay interests. An obvious way to
 remedy the existing economic imbalance between
 Chinese and Malay is to produce more Malay
 graduates who can compete with the Chinese in
 the English language - oriented world of business.
 The fact that the nation's language policy is now
 headed  in the opposite direction is a perfect
 example of the problem the Razak government
 faces in reconciling emotional Malay nationalism
 and Malaysian national interests.
 The same phenomenon also can be seen at
 work in the current effort to Malayanize the
 government bureaucracy. Although most senior
 positions in the civil service are staffed by Malays,
 the rest have been filled primarily by non-Malays
 who think out and implement government policy.
 This has long been a sore point for Malays, and
 the government is now attempting to correct the
 situation by accelerated promotion and hiring of
 Malays. What this can do to the morale of better
 qualified non-Malay civil servants who remain es-
 sential for the effective functioning of the bu-
 reaucracy goes without saying.

 Another area in which the government could
 easily lose its balance is that of economic policy.
 Chronic Malay resentment and dissatisfaction is
 based in large part on the economic disparity
 between the Malay and Chinese communities.
 Malays, for example, account for only 9.1 percent
 of managerial and professional personnel and only
 13.8 percent of the technical and supervisory
 workers in the labor force, and Chinese income
 per capita exceeds Malay income by 75 percent.
 The Razak government has publicly committed
 itself to reducing this imbalance, and its survival
 could depend on the results it obtains.
 Last March the National Operations Council
 announced general guidelines for a "new eco-
 nomic policy"-the first major step in the govern-
 ment's attempt to convince Malays that it is ready
 to embark on a vigorous program to better their
 economic lot.  In August, the economic com-
 mittee of the National Consultative Council in-
 corporated these guidelines in its recommenda-
 tions to the government. The proposals chart out
 a number of general areas of effort. First, govern-
 ment  reform                   and  participation  in  the  rural
 marketing and credit facilities are called for. The
 flow of rural Malays into the urban sector is to be
 encouraged and facilitated by government infor-
 mation, welfare assistance, and massive "job
 corps" programs. Industrial firms are required to
 hire a certain percentage of Malay staff at all
 personnel levels under mandatory employment
 quotas. And direct government participation in
 the  private  sector-through joint government-
 Malay ventures, the blanket reservation of certain
 pioneer industries for Malay capital, and govern-
 ment loans or capital-holding for Malay ven-
 tures-is suggested as a possible way to guarantee
 Malay opportunity.
 Special Report
 Everyone on the Malaysian political scene,    25X1
 including the Chinese opposition, agrees that high
 priority should be attached to attacking economic
 imbalance. There is little agreement, however, on
 exactly how this should be done; and, not sur-
 prisingly,                                                                           the  government's  future  economic
 policy has become a matter of considerable con-
 troversy. Critics of the government guidelines,
 including most of the non-Malay economists and
 planners within the bureaucracy, complain that
 such blatantly preferential  treatment will be
 deeply resented by the Chinese and only worsen
 the nation's racial problem. More specifically,
 they fear that rigid employment quotas and gov-
 ernment intrusion into the private sector will slow
 down the rate of economic growth and inevitably
 lead to a sharp hike in urban Chinese unemploy-
 ment-something that could result in a dangerous
 rise in communal tension.
 Recently various government spokesmen, in-
 cluding the man on the spot, Ghazali bin Shafie,
 have attempted  to defuse such criticism by
 pledging the government's determination to work
 on the behalf of all economically deprived citi-
 zens regardless of race, a program that would on
 the face of it affect poor Chinese also. Exactly
 what Ghazalis rhetoric means, however, is un-
 clear. Most economically deprived citizens are
 Malay. As a matter of political expediency, if
 nothing else, the government must come up with
 a program that primarily benefits the Malay. The
 damage done to Chinese interests will depend on
 the specific legislation introduced in parliament
 next February and the manner in which the legis-
 lation is implemented. In the meantime, govern-
 ment economic planning will remain the source of
 considerable Chinese apprehension.
 I n the months ahead, the effort to restore
 Malaysian political and social stability will right-
 fully absorb most of the government's attention
 and energy. But there are other problem areas.
 Kuala Lumpur faces a potentially explosive situa-
 tion in the East Malaysian State of Sarawak,

 resist strong federal control. On the international
 front, the reduction of British military presence is
 forcirg the government to reassess its position in
 world and regional affairs. There are already clear
 signs that the Razak government intends to fol-
 low a more obviously nonaligned policy, although
 it wil probably remain in most respects oriented
 toward the West.  n addition, the government is
 still confronted with a persistent and growing
 Comriunist insurgency, not only along the fron-
 tier with Thailand but in the jungles of East
 Malaysia as well. It is difficult to exaggerate the
 potertial Communist threat to Malaysia. Present
 Communist capabi`ities and resources are limited,
 however, and, barring a breakdown of Malaysian
 political and social order, the insurgent threat can
 probz bly continue to be contained as it has been
 for years. But the government is far more con-
 cerned with the political communal tasks that lie
 aheac than with Communist activity or other
 peripieral problems, and it has got its priorities
 straight.
 .given the many political  unknowns and
 variables within the present situation, an assess-
 ment of the government's ability to hold a mod-
 erate and rational course is difficult. Under the
 best of circumstances, the Chinese community
 will probably have little to smile about in the
 coming months, and Chinese disaffection  is
 bound to remain a leading feature of the political
 landscape. The Chinese are not likely, however, to
 take the lead in a renewal of communal violence
 in which they would be the inevitable losers.
 Similarly, the specter of a mass Chinese turn to
 Communist struggle remains only that-a specter.
 The Malayan Communist Party did not pick up
 much Chinese support as a result of the riots of
 May 1969, and at present there appears to be
 little sentiment within the Chinese community
 for such a desperate alternative. Furthermore, the
 Communists believe that their strong Chinese
 image is both an ideological and practical draw-
 back. and they have been attempting to put their
 movement on a class rather than racial basis.
 Consequently-at least so far-they have avoided
 the temptation of using Chinese chauvinist appeal
 in their recruiting efforts.
 Special Report
 The greatest danger to stability will come
 from within the Malay community. If the govern-
 ment proves unwilling or unable to satisfy Malay
 demands and rebuild Malay confidence in UMNO
 leadership, communal tension will rise while gov-
 ernmental authority declines. In such unstable
 circumstances the military might well move in to
 control the situation. But an army coup d'etat
 against the moderate Malay leadership seems most
 unlikely. Any military intervention would be
 without the backing of the air, naval, and support
 services of the armed forces, all heavily staffed by
 non-Malays, and would almost certainly cause in-
 stant chaos. A distinct possibility, however, is the
 forceful assertion of Malay military influence be-
 hind the facade of civilian government. Shortly
 after the May 1969 riots, Razak, in his capacity as
 chief of the NOC, offered to turn the government
 over to the military. In similar circumstances he
 could  flinch again. With either a military-
 dominated government or the emergence of a
 more openly nationalistic civilian regime, the pos-
 sibility of an extreme Chinese reaction would
 escalate. The outcome could range from a sharp
 deterioration in the functioning of the govern-
 ment and economy, both heavily dependent on
 Chinese participation, to destructive racial civil
 war open to Communist exploitation.
 Fortunately, such pessimistic speculation is
 still premature. Despite the multitude of pitfalls
 ahead, there are a few bright spots. The absence
 of serious racial incidents during the past year and
 a half is a hopeful sign. Another plus is Malaysia's
 continuing economic boom. The government has
 an economic development cushion that should
 allow it, with a little balance and finesse, to
 improve the  Malay economic position at
 minimum expense to the Chinese. The greatest
 favorable factor, however, is simply the lack of
 appealing alternatives to the present leadership.
 The Razak government may now be the only
 thing standing between the present uneasy situa-
 tion and national breakdown-a situation that all
 parties on the political spectrum probably realize,
 at least in their more candid moments. At any
 rate, the real testing period for the new govern-
 ment lies ahead. Its right to survive will be judged

 on the basis of how it handles its parliamentary
 opposition next February, the specific legislative
 programs it comes up with, and the manner in
 which it implements its new policies, especially in
 the economic area. Although the general outlines
 of government policy have emerged, it is still far
 too early for anyone to pronounce judgment. The
 question of whether a moderate Malay govern-
 ment can survive in Malaysia is not likely to be
 answered within the next six months.
 Regardless of the eventual answer to this
 central question, there seems little chance that
 Malaysia can return to democracy along pre-1969
 lines. The political tight-rope Razak is walking
 leads directly to the parliamentary elections due
 three and a half years hence-a date far in the
 future but nevertheless in the back of everyone's
 Special Report
 mind. During this period communalism is almost
 certain to remain the driving force of Malaysian
 politics. It is difficult to imagine a reversal of the
 trend toward greater Chinese political assertive-
 ness; the Chinese opposition parties are likely to
 compound their 1969 electoral gains in future
 elections. A glance at the population chart shows
 that the non-Malays will hold the political balance
 of power in a truly democratic system. No Malay
 government, including the present one, is likely to
 consider letting this happen. There is, of course,
 plenty of ground between outright Malay political
 suppression  and  total  democracy.  Hopefully,
 what can be obtained is a gradual transition from
 executive  control  to  some  form   of  limited
 representative government-a process that will al-
 low a new beginning for long-term development
 of racial reconciliation and a noncommunal politi-
 cal system.
