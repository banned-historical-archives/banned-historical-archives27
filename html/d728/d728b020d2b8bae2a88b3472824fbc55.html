USSR - Communist China: A recently completed study 
of Soviet party journals and newspapers published between 
March and September 1958--the period of conception and 
initial organization of the Chinese communes--suggests an 
absence of coordination between the Soviet and Chinese par-
ties on this issue. During this period Soviet journals con-
tinued to treat Chinese agricultural policies with an approval 
which contrasted to their attitude after the full implications 
of the commune program emerged. The seeming lack of 
prior liaison on an issue of such importance to the bloc calls 
into question the effectiv ino-Soviet consultation on 
other doctrinal matters. (Page 1) 
USSR: IL_Chrushchev told Austrian Foreign Minister Kreisky, 
during the recent visit of the Austrian delegation to the USSR, 
that he could have declared an end to Western occupation of 
West Berlin instead of offering his "generous" free city pro-
posal. The Soviet premier said he was absolutely convinced 
that the Western powers would not have gone to war, and cited 
the effect of Bulganin's threatening letters to Britain and France 
during their attack on Suez in 1956. Khrushchev also stated that 
Soviet plans for raising the standard of living are based on in-
creases inproductivity under the Seven-Year Plan and not on pos-
sible savings from disarmament; 
(Page 3) � 
Communist China - Indonesia: a reported sharp protest 
by the Chinese Communist Embassy over Indonesia's treatment 
of Overseas Chinese reflects the intense friction over this issue, 
which has developed into a major irritant to Sino-Indonesian re-
lations. Peiping's action was prompted by measures being taken 
now in small villages in Java to round up and move by truck tq.

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Lack of Sino-Soviet Liaison on Communes  
A recently completed study of Soviet party journals and 
newspapers published between March and September 1958--
the period of conception and initial organization of the Chinese 
communes�suggests an absence of coordination between the 
Soviet and Chinese parties on this issue. During this period 
Soviet journals continued to treat Chinese agricultural policies 
with an approval greatly in contrast to their attitude after the 
full implications of the commune program emerged. The seem-
ing lack of prior liaison on an issue of such importance to the 
bloc calls into question the effectiveness of Sino-Soviet consul-
tation on other doctrinal matters. 
The Chinese Communist party leadership was actively con-
sidering and making preparations for a nationwide commune 
program throughout the spring of 1958. Prototype communes 
were formed in April, the same month that Mao Tse-tung wrote 
an article--not published until June�in which he implied an in-
tention to move into a more advanced stage of agricultural organ-
ization. At the same time, the Chinese stepped up their claims 
to be advancing toward the ultimate stage of Communism, in the 
face of the Soviet position that only the USSR had graduated 
from the preliminary "socialist" stage. The communes were 
almost certainly discussed at the Chinese party congress in 
May, although the proceedings were never published. The very 
term "people's commune"--Peiping has since said--was first 
adopted in June 1958. 
While the Soviet leaders presumably knew some sort of 
change was impending in the Chinese countryside during this 
period, they do not seem to have been aware of the implications 
of Peiping's plans�not publicly revealed by the Chinese until 
September 1958 when the commune system had already reached 
an advanced stage. Had the USSR been fully informed, it would 
almost certainly have been alarmed. Yet in June 1958, at the 
Bulgarian party congress, Khrushchev himself bestowed an un-
usual accolade on the Chinese party for its "enormous contribu-
tion to the theory and practice of the socialist revolution."

As late as early September, up to the eve of the publication 
of the Chinese party's commune resolution, authoritative Soviet 
papers and spokesmen continued to praise the existing Chinese 
cooperative system in terms which suggested that they did not 
expect it to change. These Soviet statements emphasized that 
China was following the tested Leninist cooperative plan and 
Soviet experience, whereas in fact the impending commune pro-
gram was a radical departure from Soviet practice. Moscow 
also continued to congratulate the Chinese on their creative ap-
plication of Marxism, a "creativity" which the USSR subsequently 
disapproved when it became fullry aware of the commune program,

Khrushchev Comments to Austrians gn East-West Issties  
Khrushchev told Austrian Foreign Minister Kreisky early 
this month that he could have declared an end to Western occu-
pation of West Berlin instead of offering his "generous" proposal 
for a free city. The Soviet premier said he was absolutely con-
vinced that the Western powers would not have gone to war, and 
cited the effect of the USSR's threatening letters to Britain and 
France during their attack on Suez in 1956.1 
/Further evidence that Moscow's long-range economic and 
military planning is not predicated on any substantial reductions 
in military expenditures through East-West disarmament agree-
ment was provided by Khrushchey's remarks. According to 
Kreisky, the Soviet premier stated that Soviet plans for raising 
the standard of living are based on the goals of the Seven-Year 
Plan, and not on savings from disarmament./ 
IKhrushchey said he had asked his military advisers for an 
estimate of the cost of shifting the Soviet military system from 
conventional armaments to missiles. They had estimated 30 bil-
lion rubles:, he said, which would be cheaper than the cost of 
maintaining a system based on conventional armaments4 
!Kreisky gained the impression from Khrushchev that the 
USSR would accept disarmament controls, but expressed doubt 
that Soviet views on the timing and scope of controls would be 
acceptable to the United States. Khrushchev appears to have re-
peated the vague and ambiguous position on controls that he out-
lined in his speech before the UN General Assembly on 18 Septem-
ber and in subsequent pronouncements. He called for an inter-
national control body composed of all states but made it clear 
that this body would have "free access to all objects under con-
trol" only after complete disarmament has been achieved:(

GMAIC Comments on Recent Extended-Range Firings  
From Tyura Tam  
The maximum feasible guided-missile test distance for 
land impact in Soviet-controlled territory appears to be about 
3,500 nautical miles. This distance is adequate for most 
ICBM test firings but greater ranges are desirable. The 
first two extended-range firings occurred on 30 May and 9 
June 1959, one to a range of about 4,500 miles, the other to 
a similar or greater range. There is a good possibility that 
these were unintentional overshoots since: a. telemetry indi-
cates that the rocket thrust terminated by running out of fuel 
rather than in two steps by command; and b. there is a strong 
probability that the USSR had no instrumentation ships in the 
impact area. It is also possible that these were intentionally 
fired past the Kamchatka Peninsula for the purpose of propul-
sion or other tests requiring little or no instrumentation in the 
impact area. 
Subsequently four highly instrumented ships have been iden-
tified connected with the impact area of the Tyura Tam range. 
On 22 October and, 72 hours later, on 25 October there were 
two intentional firings to a range of approximately 4,700 nauti-
cal miles to the vicinity of these ships. The trajectories were 
lower and the velocities greater than optimum (minimum energy) 
for this range�IndicatiriElhat_the vehicles have a ereater range 
capability.

CONF. "1AL 
IL ASIA-AFRICA 
USSR  Opposed to UN Presence in Laos  
Soviet Ambassador to London Malik told British For-
eign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd on 23 October that the USSR 
was "absolutely opposed" to a UN presence in Laos. Dep-
uty Foreign Minister Kuznetsov had raised no objection on 
7 October when UN Secretary General Hammarskjold first 
outlined his plan to appoint a representative in Laos after 
the UN fact-finding subcommittee submits its report. 
The Soviet Government probably feels that any acqui-
escence, even though unspoken, in Hammarskjold's plan 
would undercut its insistence that the only international 
framework on which to base a solution in Laos is the Geneva 
agreements. It may also fear that tacit approval will com-
mit Moscow to a procedure Hammarskjold can use in the 
future to side-step a Soviet veto. The Malik statement sug-
gests that the USSR will-veto any Western-backed proposal 
to establish more permanent and effective UN machinery in 
Laos. 
On 26 October Malik made strong representations to 
Lloyd and delivered a Soviet note protesting the trial of the 
14 Neo Lao Hak Zat leaders as a violation of the Geneva 
agreements and calling for a meeting of the Laos Interna-
tional Control Commission to consider what should be done. 
The Foreign Office plans to reply that the trials are an inter-
nal problem for Laos and are neither in violation of nor within 
the scope of the Geneva agreements:7 
iflammarskjold continues to seek a legal basis which the 
USSR-cannot challenge for establishing a UN presence in 
Laos, and seems willing to take a calculated risk of provok-
ing renewed Soviet charges that he has violated the principle.  
of impartiality inherent in the office of the secretary general.'

Qasim Regime Contacts Syrian Anti-UAR Elements  
Baghdad has approved the request of a former member of 
the Syrian parliament to accompany a reprocontative nf dissiripnt 
Druze elements in Syria on a trip to Iraq,  
Iraqi Premier Qasim wants to sound out Kurdish_ 
and Druze elements on the possibility of undertaking subversivl 
action against the Nasir regime in Syria], Baghdad's radio and  
press have been loudly claiming that gy-rian unrest has reached 
new heights recently. 
Baghdad probably stands little chance at this time of insti-
gating a successful move to upset Nasir's hold on Syria, particu-
larly in view of the precautions Cairo has recently taken against 
such a possibility. Vice President Amir's new assignment in 
Syria is intended in part to forestall any such effort. Qasim may 
feel, however, that Nasir's program for tightening his control 
and solving the economic and political problems of Syria will only 
heighten discontent there and may ultimately fail. In such an 
event, contacts with groups that might be expected to take advan-
tage of Nasir's errors would ultimately prove valuable to Iraq. 
There has been some feeling within Syria that alignment with Iraq 
is more "natural" than the present union with Egypt, a sentiment 
which could spread if Qasim succeeds in stabilizing conditions in 
Iraq while Nasir makes only slow progress in rehabilitating the 
Syrian economic and political situation.

1-111 IN 1 IAL 
panese  - North Korean Repatriation Stalemate Resolved  
the way appears to have been cleared ior tne repatriation 
()1 Korean residents in Japan to North Korea as a result of the 
approval by the pro-Communist Korean residents' organization 
(Chosen Soren) of modifications in the program proposed by the 
Japanese Government. The revised procedures will relax re-
strictions on visits to the repatriates during their stay at the 
port of embarkation, and provide for final interviews of fam-
ilies rather than individuals to determine that the repatriates 
had "freedom of choice" in making their decision. The Jap-
anese have indicated that these procedures will not substantively 
modify conditions which would confirm the voluntary intentions 
of the repatriates91 
The Japanese Red Cross plans to reopen repatriation regis-
tration offices as soon as the International Committee of the Red 
Cross approves the revised procedures--an approval Tokyo hopes 
to receive in a few days. Chosen Soren's nationwide boycott dur-
ing the three days the registration offices were open in late Sep-
tember had restricted applications for repatriation to slightly 
more than 200. Although Chosen Soren has claimed that 170,000 
of the approximately 700,000 Koreans in Japan want to return to 
North Korea, some observers believe that the number may be 
less than 50,000. The first repatriation ship is expected to sail 
in early December.) 
tSouth Korea has publicly threatened to break off talks now 
under way to settle outstanding differences with Japan if Tokyo 
compromised with the Korean organization./ 
tRorth Korea now may be willing to allow the repatriation to 
move forward in the belief that further obstruction would reflect 
on its good faith and hamper its efforts to promote relations with 
non-Communist countries. Should the number of prospective re-
patriates prove disappointing, Pyongyang may renew charges that 
interference by Japan is responsible/
