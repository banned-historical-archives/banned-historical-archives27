 NIC Organization and The National Intelligence Council (NIC) is comprised of the National
 Mission             Intelligence Officers (NIOs), their assistants, and the Analytic Group. The
 National Intelligence Officers serve as personal staff officers and senior
 advisers to the DCI in their respective areas of functional or regional
 responsibilities. They are responsible for producing National Intelligence
 Estimates and other interagency assessments. In this function, the NIC is
 the successor to the Board and Office of National Estimates, established in
 1950, as the DCI organization to produce intelligence estimates for the
 President.
 The National Intelligence Officers are selected from senior officers in the
 Intelligence Community, the Foreign Service, the military services, acade-
 mia, and the private sector. They are responsible to the DCI and serve him
 largely in his role of leader of the Intelligence Community. Collectively,
 the NIOs sit as the National Intelligence Council. The Council has a
 chairman and two vice chairmen.

 The Products        There are four types of coordinated Intelligence Community papers. The
 most formal and authoritative of the four is the National Intelligence
 Estimate-the NIE. A recent example is an NIE published in September
 1986 called Colombia: Prospects for the New Government, which exam-
 ined the prospects of President Barco and his projected ability to deal with
 a growing insurgency and a thriving narcotics industry. Such country
 specific NIEs are becoming less typical, as we seek to broaden our
 estimates regionally and functionally. Special National Intelligence Esti-
 mates-or SNIEs-are similar to NIEs but deal with more time-urgent
 issues. SNIEs are often specially requested by a policymaker and written in
 a matter of weeks or days.
 The two other forms of
 estimates are: Interagency Intelligence Memoranda (IIM) and Interagency
 Intelligence Assessments (IIA). Both are issued by the Chairman of the
 NIC, rather than the DCI. IIMs address topics in more detail, and IIAs
 have a quick turnaround but are usually of less immediate concern to
 senior policymakers than SNIEs. Finally, Memoranda to Holders may be
 issued for any of these four types of estimates, to update or amplify its
 judgments.
 The total number of estimates produced between 1979 and 1986 steadily in-
 creased to an almost even balance of NIEs, SNIEs, IIMs and IIAs. In mid-
 1986 the annual production plan was restructured to implement the DCI's
 decision to undertake more estimates that cut across traditional analytic
 disciplines and to reduce the number of conventional-style country-oriented
 NIEs, particularly on areas of marginal policy relevance. This year the
 plan includes about 100 formal estimative products, a list that, to assure
 relevance, is flexible and subject to revision. The list does not include the
 stream of less formal products constantly in production by the NIOs, their
 assistants, and members of the Analytic Group to advise the DCI or
 stimulate thought throughout the Community.
 The following charts indicate for 1986 the percentage of formal products
 by type, the genesis of the requests, and the agencies providing the drafters,
 the latter two indicate the degree of Community involvement in tasking
 and execution that is typical of NIC production.
 NIOs frequently attempt to challenge the Community to reexamine the
 conventional wisdom, and in the process often include alternative scenarios
 as well as indicators that will alert policymakers to a possible change in
 trends. An estimate on the Philippine succession written in 1985 discussed a

 broad range of less likely succession possibilities which could be used in de-
 veloping policy options. Estimates before 1983 usually had focused only on
 what the Intelligence Community believed to be the most likely scenario.
 When agencies differ on important issues, these differences are highlighted
 either through parallel text or footnotes. For example, a recent estimate
 entitled Domestic Stresses on the Soviet System, stated that Soviet
 domestic problems are likely to push Gorbachev to seek a restoration of de-
 tente. The Defense Intelligence Agency and the Air Force took a different
 tack, arguing that Soviet internal problems are not a significant variable
 concerning Moscow's foreign policies.
 The estimative product is reviewed at every stage and at the end, feedback
 is sought from policymakers through formal and informal channels. It is
 enormously helpful when a senior official takes the time to write a note or
 call to give views on an estimate-positive or negative.

 The Process         In order to be useful to policymakers, estimates must deal with topics that
 are relevant and timely; they must reach the right officials before key
 decisions are made. The most critical step in the estimate process is the se-
 lection of topics to be considered. A policymaker or the Director may ask
 that the Community take a thorough look at an issue. Alternatively, an
 NIO or the Chairman of the NIC may initiate an estimate in order to an-
 ticipate policymakers' needs-i.e., what he needs to hear, not necessarily
 what he wants to hear. Thus, successful NIOs must be constantly in touch
 with their key consumers as well as specialists in their field.
 The NIC involves all of the components of the Intelligence Community in
 the rigorous process of developing and coordinating an annual production
 plan that is constantly updated throughout the year. Three DCI panels also
 participate in this process by advising on the analytic soundness and policy
 relevance of the plan and on key estimates in their fields. (The Military Ad-
 visory Panel is composed of eight retired flag officers, former ambassadors,
 systems analysts, and a university professor. The Science and Technology
 Advisory Panel is made up of nine leaders of industry; and the in-house
 five-member Senior Review Panel includes former ambassadors, retired
 flag officers, and a distinguished scientist.)
 The estimative process has five stages, which involve all components of the
 Intelligence Community:
 ? Concept Paper/Terms of Reference (CP/TOR). The CP addresses the
 estimate's origin and purpose and asks key questions to be answered; the
 TORs outline in greater detail the central issues to be addressed in the
 estimate. The development of the CP/TOR is closely supervised by the
 NIOs, as it sets the stage for all that follows. The CP/TOR are reviewed
 and approved by the DCI for coordination and distributed to the
 representatives of National Foreign Intelligence Board (NFIB) Principals
 who meet to discuss and amend them.
 ? Writing the Estimates. The NIO supervising the preparation of the
 estimate selects a drafter from the Intelligence Community. When the
 draft is completed, it is reviewed by the NIO, the Chairman of the NIC,
 and by the DCI's Senior Review Panel. When possible, estimates are also
 reviewed by specialists outside the Community and other DCI panels.
 Estimates accommodating these comments as appropriate are sent to the
 DCI with a recommendation that they be sent to NFIB Agencies for
 formal coordination.
 ? Coordination. Formal coordination meetings among NFIB representa-
 tives are held and differences are either resolved or highlighted, with
 emphasis on the latter when they are significant. Dissenting views are
 clearly stated in the estimates as alternative language or footnotes.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/09: CIA-RDP93T01132R000100030001-0
 ? NFIB Approval. The DCI reviews the estimate after coordination and
 then submits it to NFIB Principals for final coordination. NFIB reviews
 the estimate, sometimes challenges its judgments and adds additional
 alternative language or footnotes, and recommends that the DCI approve
 or remand it.
 ? Feedback. Once an estimate is approved and published, feedback is
 sought from the policymakers concerning the relevance of the analysis.
 Further, retrospective analysis is done as the topic is being prepared for
 treatment again to determine how the Community's views may have
 changed and why.
 Assuring Quality/Relevance
 A good estimate digs deep, probes for factual bases of disagreement,
 highlights the critical uncertainties, and raises questions that need more
 attention. Top quality estimates do not necessarily simplify a policymaker's
 job; rather an excellent estimate widens the policyniaker's agenda and
 pushes the individual toward more extensive reflection. Getting a high
 quality, highly relevant product out of a process involving several agencies
 is not an easy task. We have taken several approaches:
 ? NIOs attempt to integrate traditional areas of analysis (such as political,
 economic, social and military) in many broad estimates. For instance, an
 estimate in production on Islamic fundamentalism will look at this as a
 regional phenomenon. This study will examine the influence this religious
 revival is having on the social patterns, economic practices, and political
 behavior of key Arab states as well as discuss the implications for the
 United States.
 ? Where appropriate, estimates cut across regional and functional analytic
 lines. For example, the NIC has produced an estimate on the prospects
 for counterterrorist cooperation among developed countries, and is
 preparing an estimate on the outlook for US foreign basing and access
 rights worldwide.
 ? Another will take a regional look at ASEAN rather than the usual
 country or event-specific approach. Still another will give policymakers a
 better understanding of the rapid shift in economic power to the newly in-
 dustrialized countries in East Asia.
 ? Occasionally we will attempt a totally new type of estimate. One such
 planned estimate will look at about 10 international high impact, low
 probability events. Individually, the probability of these events occurring

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/09: CIA-RDP93T01132R000100030001-0
 is low; however, their occurrence would have a dramatic impact on the
 international system. The Estimate will provide warning indicators of
 their potential emergence.
 Estimates and the Intelligence/Policy Connection
 Occasionally charges are made that judgments in some estimates were
 written to justify a particular pre-existing policy preference. The Tower
 Commission expressed this concern. There have been other instances in
 recent years of accusations of policy corruption of objective NIC judg-
 ments as well. This is particularly marked on issues concerning Iran,
 Central America, the USSR in the Third World, and overall Soviet
 policies. The NIC must tell it like it is, and let the chips fall where they
 may, and that is just what we attempt to do. We always have been, and will
 continue to be, careful to maintain the independence of the intelligence
 process. While we seek policy relevance, we seek to avoid policy prescrip-
 tion. Our analyses have not always been congenial to the policy communi-
 ty. Examples of estimates that reexamined the conventional wisdom, in
 some cases contradicting the assumptions underlying an administration
 ?      policy, are listed below. These examples, moreover, were picked from a
 much longer list:
 ? One recent estimate concluded that for the next few years constraints on
 Soviet hard currency would not be serious enough to spur a major shift in
 their foreign policy nor require Moscow to make fundamental economic
 reforms. The White House and some advisers at the NSC disagreed.
 ? In three estimates on Libya spanning five years, the Community was far
 more cautious and pessimistic about the impact of US political, econom-
 ic, and covert sanctions on Qadhafi than some administration policy
 officials.
 ? Major estimates on Soviet strategic programs have often dealt with

 Strengths and Weak- Strengths
 nesses of the NIC
 The strength of the NIOs derives from their freedom from the demands of
 current intelligence production and requirements, their focus on the longer
 term intelligence and trends, and their access to the DCI. Careful selection
 of senior people, with experience and stature in their fields, from a variety
 of professional and institutional backgrounds, provides objective advice and
 avoids institutional biases. The independence of the individual NIOs and
 their allegiance only to the DCI is intended to avoid conflict with policy or
 budget interests that tend to influence, or at least give the impression of in-
 fluencing, the judgments of the intelligence services of the individual
 agencies.
 The limited ability of the Community to devote resources to a broad range
 of in-depth research limits the longer term estimative work of the NIC.
 The problem will persist to the extent that Community intelligence
 analysts tend to act more as all-source reports officers than in-depth
 researchers.
 In addition, many of the the major questions require highly judgmental
 answers, which by nature go beyond any specific body of evidence. The
 questions call for political judgments of a high order with no certainty of
 being correct. Analysts tend to shrink from many judgments sought by the
 policymaker because the evidentiary base is too thin; yet these judgments
 can and must be made, even if qualified by explicit statements that they
 are based upon limited data.
 We try to identify the major variables that could affect our best judgment
 and to determine how those variables might affect the outcome. In sum, we
 try as much to describe the environment within which future events will
 take place as we do to provide a judgment on what is most likely to happen.
 Another problem is the difficulty in arriving at crisp judgments through
 the Community coordination process. The search for consensus often
 reduces the punch of those judgments, except where significant disagree-
 ments lead to alternative text or footnotes. We frequently use uncoordinat-
 ed typescripts to reexamine and challenge the accepted wisdom and to get
 those analyses before policymakers.
 The NIC's estimates production schedule routinely falls prey to staff
 shortages, NIO personnel changes, delays in receiving sensitive source
 materials, competition for the services of qualified drafters, the necessary
 Intelligence Community review and coordination process, and the need to

 I
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/09: CIA-RDP93T01132R000100030001-0
 spend valuable time in recasting less than acceptable drafts. As a result,
 there is a "bow wave" of estimates in queue awaiting production.
 One of the strengths of the NIO system is its ability to bring the NIOs into
 contact with policymakers, providing the NIOs a firsthand opportunity to
 see the latter's information needs. This is a two-edged sword. A close
 working relationship is vital to our ability to provide intelligence relevant to
 policy decisions. Too close a relationship can lead to perceptions that the
 independent intelligence process can be compromised for policy-or politi-
 cal-purposes. We strive to maintain a proper separation between policy
 and intelligence in order to maintain our objectivity.
 There is a constant need for NIO knowledge of "blue team" activities, that
 is, what our own policymakers are doing that affect foreign developments.
 We always need better information on the day-to-day intentions, planning,
 and operations of State, DOD, and CIA's Directorate of Operations in
 selected covert activities in order to have a full picture of the forces at play
 in foreign developments and to warn of unsuspected pitfalls.
 There are the problems associated with finding, acquiring, and retaining
 the best possible personnel for the NIC. A major hurdle is the stringent
 hiring process-particularly the rigorous polygraph examination and the
 length of the interview and -testing procedures-for anyone wishing to work
 in this building. We need to seek a representative sample of personnel from
 agencies and institutions inside and outside of government in the interest of
 a broad intellectual base. Too often, outstanding candidates simply are
 either intimidated and decline our offer, or exhaust their patience and
 accept another job offer.

 NIO/Africa           I. Key Issues
 ? Libya's Defeat in Chad. Qadhafi's army has been literally decimated,
 although President Habre's forces probably will need several more
 months to expel the remaining Libyans in the north. So rapid was the
 Chadian success that US policymakers have not fully formulated a
 follow-on US policy. They need assessments of Qadhafi's likely moves
 (including new Chad military ventures, new terrorism in Africa, and
 renewed subversion in neighboring Sudan and Niger), French intentions,
 and Habre's military intentions and capabilities.
 ? Instability and Economic Stagnation in Southern Africa. US decision-
 makers are rethinking policy toward southern Africa. They seek new
 ways to use our preferred diplomatic and economic tools to reduce
 regional and civil violence, promote economic development and political
 liberalization, and curb Soviet influence in Angola, Mozambique, South
 Africa, and Zimbabwe.
 H. Agenda
 With nearly 50 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the wide variety of
 problems that arise there, the NIO/AF must prioritize and be highly
 selective in choosing topics for Intelligence Community studies. Top
 priority currently goes to the myriad issues in southern Africa (including
 the Angolan and Mozambican civil wars, South Africa's domestic situation
 and regional relations, and Soviet military aid and influence in the region)
 along with Libyan activities in the Sahel belt (especially the war in Chad
 and Libyan activities in Sudan and West Africa). Second-order priorities
 include new problems in US relations with old friends Zaire, Kenya, and
 Sudan-problems aggravated recently by unavoidable reductions in levels
 of US foreign aid. Long-term and persistent issues are led by Africa's
 continuing economic decline and accompanying political instability, and
 also include major natural disasters such as famine, drought, and the
 growing AIDS pandemic.
 III. Estimative Program
 A total of eight estimative products were completed in 1986 and 10 are
 currently planned for completion in 1987 to address this agenda.

 NIO/East Asia        I. Key Issues
 ? Challenges in the Philippines. The situation in the Philippines is more
 difficult than many US policymakers have been willing to admit.
 President Aquino faces serious challenges from a stalled economy, a
 Communist insurgency, and even her own military.
 ? Potential for Political Instability in South Korea. An unpopular Chun
 Doo Hwan claims he will step down from the Presidency in 1988.
 However, it is likely that he will try to retain political power from behind
 the scenes. An increasingly confrontational opposition is pushing for
 direct presidential elections, while the ruling party wants a parliamentary
 cabinet system that will ensure its continued rule. The uncertain
 domestic political situation is increasing the likelihood of political
 instability and the potential for a military move by North Korea. L
 ? Uncertainty in China. The removal of General Secretary Hu Yaobang
 and the slowing of reforms raise prospects of further instability as
 prospective successors to aging Deng Xiaoping jockey for position.
 Retrenchment on domestic and foreign policies would set back China's
 opening to the US and the West.
 II. Agenda
 The sheer number of Asian nations and the multitude of problems needing
 attention require the NIO/EA to structure his agenda with priorities much
 in mind. Top priorities of the moment include the Korean Peninsula, the
 Philippines, and China. Right behind these hot issues come a number of
 second-order problems that could move to the front burner rather quickly,
 including developments on Taiwan and Indochina. A number of other

 issues, presently more of a potential problem, need watching so that they do
 not catch us by surprise. The situation in Cambodia and developments in
 Indonesia fall into this category.

 NIO/Europe          I. Key Issues
 ? Threats to NATO's Security Consensus. The Iceland summit and
 Gorbachev's latest INF proposal have stimulated reevaluation of security
 policies in Europe. The European left is embracing nonaggressive defense
 strategies that would weaken NATO, and there is movement toward
 greater European cooperation that excludes the US. Other potential
 threats to NATO cohesion include differences over counterterrorist
 policies, protectionism, and out-of-area disputes.
 ? NATO's Southern Flank. With early elections probable in Italy and
 Portugal, possible clashes in US-Spanish base negotiations, and height-
 ened tensions between Greece and Turkey, new problems-and potential
 crises-could erupt. Soviet probing is probable in connection with
 Gorbachev's planned visits to Italy and Greece.
 ? Western Opportunities in Eastern Europe. Imminent succession strug-
 gles and continued economic decline are key issues in Eastern Europe.
 Moreover, there are signs of increased friction in the Warsaw Pact as a
 result of Gorbachev's aggressive new policies and stiffer Soviet trade
 demands.
 H. Agenda
 The NIO/Europe accords top priority currently to issues relating to the
 transatlantic alliance, including
 growing threats to the NATO consensus. Secondary concern goes to
 programs designed to strengthen early warning capabilities in areas of high
 crisis potential, such as Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey. A third
 priority includes efforts to upgrade analytic and collection resources
 focused on Eastern Europe at a time of high uncertainty, and potentially of
 profound changes.
 III. Estimative Program
 A total of three estimative products were completed in 1986 and four are
 currently planned for completion in 1987 to address this agenda.

 NIO/Latin America      I. Key Issues
 ? The Sandinista Threat to Central America. The insurgency faces an
 uphill struggle, the Sandinistas are consolidating power, and Soviet
 support to Nicaragua is increasing.
 25X1
 25X1
 ? Latin American Debt. Mounting foreign debt afflicts the entire Third
 World, but only in Latin America could default have traumatic impact
 on the world financial system and economy. The region owes the rest of
 the world $400 billion; half is owed by Mexico and Brazil.                                                                                          25X1

 ? Narcotics. The narcotics flow from the Andean, countries through
 Mexico and the Caribbean to the US is increasing. We are losing the war
 on drugs.                                                                                          25X1

 H. Agenda
 Responsible for yet another area encompassing numerous countries and
 diverse issues, the NIO/LA must prioritize Community efforts on Latin
 America. Most pressing issues involve the Nicaraguan insurgency and the
 Soviet/Cuban foothold in Central America. Of secondary but high impor-
 tance are the issues of Latin American debt, narcotics, and instability in
 Mexico. Continuing concerns revolve around chronic instability in Latin
 American countries and in their relations with the United States, Soviet
 Bloc, and Cuba.

 NIO/Near East and      I. Key Issues
 South Asia
 ? Iran-Iraq War. Iraq appears brittle, and a tactical loss could become an
 Iraqi rout. Newly introduced weapons are increasing the threat to
 shipping in the Gulf, and succession in Iran could have profound
 implications.
 ? State-Supported Terrorism. The US and its allies differ over how to deal
 with the terrorist threat. Other than Lebanon, however, state-supported
 terrorism seems to be diminishing since the US bombing raid in Libya
 and UK sanctions against Syria. Nonetheless, the problem remains
 serious.
 ? Arab-Israeli Dispute. The US administration wants to reinvigorate the
 peace process and shore up Egyptian stability, but policy discussion is
 impeded by sensitivity and bias toward issues relating to Israel.
 II. Agenda
 A disproportionate share of the NIO/NESA's work is driven by ad hoc,
 priority requests for quick, focused intelligence assessments. Recent papers
 generated by these requests have focused on such issues as Egyptian
 military construction in the Sinai, Egypt's deteriorating prospects, and
 India's response to US efforts to improve bilateral relations. A second
 category of production in the NESA area concerns chronic policy problems
 that require frequent revisiting, such as the Iran-Iraq War, Libya, and the
 Arab-Israeli military balance. The third element of our NESA production
 involves long-term issues that affect US policy in the Middle East-such as
 the implications for the US of the Islamic revival, perceptions among the
 Arab states of the superpowers, and trends in Israeli social and political
 dynamics.

 NIO/USSR               I. Key Issues
 ? Gorbachev's Position and Agenda. General Secretary Gorbachev is
 staking out a bold agenda for political, economic, and social change in
 the USSR, but support for his program in the leadership and ruling elite
 remains precarious.
 ? US-Soviet Relations and Arms Control. Gorbachev also is shaking up
 the Soviet foreign policy apparatus and altering long-held negotiation
 positions in an effort to get an agreement that will restrict SDI and ease
 ? The Soviets in Afghanistan. The Soviets are trying new military tactics
 and a more sophisticated political strategy, but they remain committed to
 the maintenance of a pro-Soviet regime in Kabul.
 II. Agenda
 The NIO/USSR will devote primary substantive attention to four subjects:
 Gorbachev's domestic position and agenda; US-Soviet relations, especially
 its arms control dimension; Soviet policy in Afghanistan; and Sino-Soviet
 relations. All of these are issues with considerable potential for develop-
 ments that could have significant impact on US interests and policy.
 III. Estimative Program
 A total of two estimative products were completed in 1986 and six are cur-
 rently planned for completion in 1987 to address this agenda.

 highest priority will be to respond to the DDCI's concerns that the current
 mix of interagency estimates leaves unaddressed a number of potential
 future developments that, though currently judged unlikely, would have a
 substantial impact on US interests if they nevertheless took place, for
 example, significant movement toward German reunification or the eco-
 nomic and political collapse of Israel

 NIO/Counterterrorism I. Key Issues
 ? State Sponsored Terrorism. The motivations, methods, and targets of
 Syria, Libya, Iran and possibly Iraq.
 ? Radical Shia Threat. Including the Lebanon hostage problem and
 growth of nacent Shia cells in US, Europe, and elsewhere.
 ? Radical Palestinian Threat. Including Palestinian mainstream and
 factions, Western targets, and potential domestic threat.
 ? Central and South American Violence. Increasing use of terrorist tactics
 by insurgent groups, particularly in Andean nations, and the ability of
 governments to deal with the problem; threat to US interests in the
 region.
 ? Cooperative Counterterrorist Measures. Measures available to Western
 nations to increase cooperation and prospects for success.
 II. Agenda
 The top priority of the NIO for Counterterrorism is to continue to provide
 intelligence analysis on the containment of Middle Eastern terrorism and
 the prevention of its spread to Western Europe and elsewhere. The
 production of timely intelligence to assist European policymakers in
 dealing with their own problems of terrorism is an important part of this ef-
 fort. Another key priority is to provide intelligence and analysis on securing
 the release of US hostages.

 NIO/Economics        I. Key Issues
 ? Agricultural Policies. The US, as well as Japan and Western Europe,
 are under strong financial pressure to reduce government subsidies to
 agriculture. The US cannot act unilaterally without hurting US farmers,
 and US negotiators need to know what agricultural subsidies other
 governments provide, why they do so, and what flexibility they have to
 bring about reductions.
 ? Petroleum and Near East Stability. The global oversupply of petroleum
 is straining OPEC's ability to cooperate and to stabilize prices. It is
 increasing friction between those producers with relatively large reserves
 and those with smaller reserves; the latter are pushing for high prices in
 H. Agenda
 Of highest priority is the issue of economic reform in the USSR. Equally
 important is: Third World debt with the goal of providing advance warning
 of problems and tactical support for negotiations.
 Other problems include: global energy problems from the perspective of the
 tradeoff between lower energy prices and future energy security; economic
 differences among the major countries that result in politically sensitive
 trade imbalances; changing economic patterns, and prospects in Asia, and
 the impact of these shifts on our relations with this dynamic region.

 NIO/Foreign Denial The work of the NIO for FDIA falls in a special category of support for the
 and Intelligence  DCI:
 Activities
 ? An estimate on Soviet Intelligence Capabilities will be published in 1987.
 ? The Office of the NIO/FDIA provides the Chairman of the DCI's
 Foreign Denial and Deception Analysis Committee (DDAC). The Com-
 mittee, among other things, is responsible for coordinating the Communi-
 ty's national-level, all-source analysis of the purpose, means, and effec-
 tiveness of Soviet and other foreign intelligence denial and deception
 measures. The Committee also oversees assessments of the substantive
 intelligence damage suffered or anticipated from compromises of classi-
 fied US and allied information involving or impacting on intelligence
 sources and methods. At this time, the DDAC is now doing for the DCI
 (at the request of the White House and with the approval of the
 Department of Justice) damage assessments for the Walker/Whitworth,
 Pollard, Pelton, and Chin cases.
 ? Since its inception in 1984, the Office of the NIO/FDIA has focused on
 areas of potential US vulnerability to hostile-particularly Soviet-
 intelligence-related activities. Matters such as counterintelligence and
 security issues, denial and deception, and active measures (covert propa-
 ganda and covert action) all come under its purview. Historically these
 problems had tended to be viewed departmentally. The NIO/FDIA
 Staff, comprised of officers from CIA, DIA, FBI, and NSA, has been a
 catalyst in broadening perspectives of individual agencies and compo-
 nents in appraisal of these threats, and in promoting coordinated

 ? Warsaw Pact Military Threat to NATO. The size and capabilities of the
 Warsaw Pact forces facing NATO represent a changed threat to NATO.
 New force organization, weapons, and training all contribute to changes
 in capabilities, which is ever present in the background of Soviet /West
 European relations.
 ? Support to MBFR Effort. Continuous effort is expended to provide the
 data upon which judgments about MBFR options are made
 ? Soviet Projection of Military Power Beyond Europe. The presence of
 Soviet military forces in distant areas is often seen as evidence of their
 potency in international affairs but not as the real military capability
 that it signficantly represents.

 II. Agenda
 Assessing the complicated and formidable threat facing NATO will be the
 highest priority task again in 1987. Several estimates will assess the
 capabilities of selected components of the force, other estimates will
 address the threat theater by theater. Support of the MBFR and related
 force stabilization efforts will continue. We will also complete the military
 modernization program series on selected NATO countries in the context
 of the likely Warsaw Pact Threat. Attention will also be paid to Soviet
 threats and power projection outside of NATO to include maritime,
 foreign military sales and assistance, and activities in the Far East.
 III. Estimative Program
 A total of four estimative products were completed in 1986 and 21 are cur-
 rently planned for completion in 1987 to address this agenda. We are
 looking at scaling this schedule back to a more realistic agenda for the
 year.

 NIO/Narcotics
 1. Key Issues
 conducting a joint study of the field in an effort to define the topic more
 ? Narco-Terrorism. The nexus between narcotics organizations and terror-
 ist organizations is an area requiring additional intelligence and analysis.
 Currently,-the NIO for Counterterrorism and the NIO for Narcotics are
 exactly and diagnose its intelligence needs more precisely.
 ? Spillover Countries. US intelligence coverage is generally effective in the
 major cocaine-producing countries. More intelligence emphasis and
 efforts are needed on drug-related issues in countries such as Argentina,
 Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Venezuela.
 ? R&D Effort in Support of US Narcotics Control Objectives. A study by
 the Intelligence Research and Development Council is currently under
 way. It needs careful monitoring to ensure that a fully coordinated
 Community product is developed.
 II. Agenda
 Primary attention to three areas beyond the production of interagency
 papers currently listed on production schedule: supporting the DCI in his
 role on the National Drug Policy Board; working with major law enforce-
 ment agencies to build new policies and procedures to protect intelligence
 sources and methods in courtroom scenarios; and working in interagency

 NIO/Science and     I. Key Issues
 Technology
 ? Technological surprise.
 ? Soviet science and technology as a base for future military capability.
 ? Chinese efforts to narrow the huge technology gap with the West.
 ? Threats to US competitiveness by technological advances in other
 Western Countries. Potential role of the Allies in SDI.
 II. Agenda
 The highest priority of NIO/ST is to review recent estimates on Soviet
 military technology, especially in the areas related to future low observable
 strategic defense, and antisubmarine warfare systems.
 Of lower priority but still of importance is the effort to assess Chinese and
 non-Communist world technological advances and prospects.
 New efforts include technology available to terrorists and narcotic traffick-
 ers in the late 1990s, and what problems this would pose to the US.
 III. Estimative Program
 A total of four estimative products were completed in 1986 and nine are
 currently planned for completion in 1987 to address this agenda.

 NIO/Strategic        I. Key Issues
 Programs
 ? Soviet Strategic Offensive and Defensive Force Capabilities and Pros-
 pects. Assessment of these force capabilities is crucial to the US national
 security process. The sum capabilities are constantly reexamined. Our
 estimates are essential to US strategic military programs and are used in
 detail by the Pentagon and Strategic Air Command. The President,
 Executive Branch, and Congress receive extensive briefings on the work.
 We are currently focused especially on ICBM force modernization,
 mobile missiles, ABM developments, directed energy weapons develop-
 ment, military space programs, and deep underground leadership protec-
 tion program.
 ? Support of US Strategic Arms Control Negotiations. Our assessments of
 Soviet attitudes toward compliance and verification and US capabilities
 to monitor agreements are critical to the US arms control process
 H. Agenda
 The NIO/SP expends the majority of effort on the annual NIE 11-3/8,
 Soviet Forces and Capabilities for Strategic Nuclear Conflict Through the
 Late 1990's, which is a year-long multi-volume enterprise. Other estimates
 and ad hoc memoranda will specifically address more narrowly focused
 questions raised by the arms limitation process or by prospective develop-
 ments in US forces or weapons. We will bt intensifying our support to the
 Strategic Defense Initiative organization and will continue our deep
 involvement in the arms control process. We have underway a definitive
 NIE on our monitoring capabilities. Estimates will be produced coverin
 all of the key issues noted above.
 III. Estimative Program
 A total of five estimative products were completed in 1986 and 16 are
 currently planned for completion in 1987 to address this agenda.

 NIO/Warning        Pursuant to the Director of Central Intelligence Directive 6/1, the
 National Intelligence Officer for Warning is responsible for advising the
 DCI in all matters pertaining to warning and recommends when the
 issuance of warning is appropriate. He also reviews the collection and
 analysis of intelligence from all sources for warning implications in
 assessing intelligence judgments within the Intelligence Community and
 promotes research and training in methodologies and procedures for
 warning and for developing warning consciousness and discipline through-
 out the Intelligence Community. The NIO for Warning substantively
 duplicates in his area of coverage all the areas of the regional NIOs while
 specifically seeking out the issues for which warning is warrented.
 Estimative Program
 Two estimative products are currently planned for completion in 1987 to
 address this agenda, in addition to a monthly warning report for the DCI.
