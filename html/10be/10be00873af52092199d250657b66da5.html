 CHANGES IN THE SOVIET RAILROAD STRUCTURE*
 The rapid development of the Soviet economy in postwar years has
 included changes in both the railroad administration and network.
 Although the network is still inadequate, increased activity and the
 addition of rail-line mileage had resulted in a straggling, cumber-
 some railroad organization that required drastic overhauling to pro-
 mote better administration and greater efficiency.  Minor changes in
 the administrative systems have occurred periodically, but the number
 and rate of changes was greatly increased by the May 1953 edict of
 the Council of Ministers, which authorized the consolidation of the
 existing 56 systems into 1l.**
 In the consolidation, the smaller, less efficiently operated
 systems were divided among the larger adjacent systems, and the
 regional systems were redefined so that none overextended into the
 administrative area of another.  Five key trunklines of considerable
 importance are known either to be under construction or possibly to
 have been completed.  Information is lacking concerning the assign-
 ment of these new lines to railroad systems.  The revised railroad
 *Research for this study was done in collaboration with the Serv-
 ices Section, USSR Branch, Foreign Documents Division, 00, CIA.
 **The existence of 56 systems was first confirmed by the Soviets
 in Gudok, 15 February 1952.   The edict reducing the number was men-
 tioned in Zara Vostoka, 22 May 1953?  In most cases, inefficiency is
 cited as the justification for consolidations.  The Soviet justifi-
 cation for the creation of the Baltic System appearing in Gudok, 24
 June 1953, is typical.

 network, including the reorganized railroad systems and additional
 mileage, is shown on the accompanying map (13739).  The system names
 are those used by the Soviet Ministry of Transportation, and various
 colors are used to differentiate the individual systems.
 The major changes in the structure of the systems that have
 occurred since 19+8 are summarized as follows:
 1.  The Leningrad System was created between 19+8 and 1952 from
 a part of the October System.  After the May 1953 edict, it was
 reincorporated into the October System.
 2.  The Kalinin System absorbed part of the Western System,
 which is now abolished.
 3.  The Belorussian System absorbed the Belostok and Brest-
 Litovsk Systems in 19+8 and after the May 1953 edict absorbed the
 Minsk and part of the Western System.
 I.  The Vinnitsa System was created between 19+8 and 1952 from
 a part of the Southwestern System.  After the May 1953 edict, it was
 incorporated into the October System.
 5.  The Odessa-Kishinev System was formed by a merger of the
 former Odessa and Kishinev Systems.
 6.  The Donets System was established by merging the former
 North Donets and South Donets Systems.
 7.  The Moscow-Kursk-Donbas System was created by a merger of
 the former Moscow-Kursk and Moscow-Donbas Systems.

 8.   The Southeastern System absorbed the Penza System before
 1952.
 9.   The Volga System was formed by merging the Stalingrad and
 Ryazan'-Ural Systems.
 10.  The Transcaucasus System absorbed the Azerbaydzhan System.
 11.  The Usa System was created between 191+8 and 1952 from a
 part of the Kuybyshev System.
 12.  The Sverdlovsk System absorbed the Perm System.
 13.  The Far Eastern System absorbed the Maritime System.
 14.  The Baltic System was created by consolidating the former
 Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian Systems.
 15.  The Lvov System absorbed the Kovel' System between 1948
 and 1952.
 16.  The Pechora System was formed from parts of the Gor'kiy and
 Northern Systems.
 17.  The Karaganda System was created between 1948 and 1952 from
 part of the Omsk System.
 The five new trunklines under construction include the following:
 1.   The BAM (Baykal-Amur' Magistral).  Not until recently have
 the Soviets admitted any construction on this important alternate
 route to the Trans-Siberian Railroad.  On 4 November 1954, however,
 Pravda (No. 308) reported the completion of a section of the RAM
 about 700 kilometers long, extending from Tayshet to Ust-Kut via

 Bratsk. The Urga1-Komsomol'sk-Sovetskaya Gavan' section of the RAM
 is described in detail in Map Intelligence Review No. 37S-7, September
 1953.
 2.  The South Siberian Railroad.  This trunkline has been highly
 publicized by the Soviets and is to connect Magnitogorsk in the Urals
 with Stalinsk in the Kuzbas.  The line will pass through Akmolinsk,
 Paviodar, Kulunda, and Barnaul.  According to reports, it is also to
 be extended eastward through Abakan to Tayshet, and westward through
 Kartaly and Ishimbayevo to Abdulino. The Soviet press has reported
 the completion of several sections of the line, such as those from
 Akmolinsk to Pavlodar, Stalinsk to Barnaul, and Barnaul to Kulunda.
 3.  The Salekhard-Iarka Railroad.  According to available
 intelligence sources this strategic railroad is under construction
 or possibly completed, but it has probably not yet been accepted by
 the Ministry of Transportation for normal operation.  No information
 is available from open Soviet sources. A detailed study of the line
 is available in Geographic Intelligence Review No. 42, August 1954.
 4.  The Okha-7movskoye Pobedino Trunkline of Northern Sakhalin.
 Recent intelligence reveals that construction has begun on this key
 railroad line, which will connect with the South Sakhalin System and
 provide railroad transportation through the entire 600-mile length
 of the island.  A detailed study of the line is presented in Geo-
 graphic Intelligence Review No. 44, February 1955.

 5.  Komsomol'sk-Nikolayevka Railroad.  Construction of this rail-
 road is believed nearing completion, although official Soviet sources
 remain silent on the matter.
 The numerical designations of the systems appearing on Map 13739
 were taken from the 1951+ Soviet tariff manual, Tarifnoye Rukoyodstvo,
 N.1, Volumes I and II, published by the Ministry of Transportation
 (Ministerstvo Putey Soobshcheniya SSSR).*  In this source, each of
 the 41 railroad systems is designated by a number in parentheses
 following the system name.  These numbers are basically the same as
 those used in the 1938 edition of Tarifnoye Rukovodstvo, N.1+, Volume
 I.  Some of the numbers in both the 1951 and 1938 editions are iden-
 tical with system numbers used in the 1925 and 1926 tariff publi-
 cations of the Peoples Commissariat of Transportation entitled Svod
 Tarifov na Perevozku Gruzov po Zheleznym Dorogam SSR (Tariff Summary
 on Freight Transportation over USSR Railroads).
 The system numbers in the 1938 and 195+ tariff manuals differ
 only where individual systems have been consolidated into larger units
 or abolished, or where new systems have been created.  In the case of
 consolidation of two systems, the number retained for the new system
 in the 195+ edition is the smaller of the two system numbers appearing
 *Numerical designations for railroad systems. appearing on the
 Schematic Sketch of the USSR Railroad Network, 1948, were devised
 arbitrarily by the Foreign Documents Branch of CIA -- purely as an
 intelligence research aid.

 in the 1938 edition.  Where a system has been abolished, the number
 used in 1938 is not carried in the 1954 edition.  The numbers used to
 identify systems created since 1938 do not follow any definite se-
 quence and appear to be arbitrarily chosen.
 The 1954 tariff manual also proved to be an excellent source for
 confirming the identity of system junction stations shown on Map
 13739, which had been obtained originally from Gudok and other Soviet
 sources.  A number of supplementary brochures published in 1954 pro-
 vided additional data on more recent changes in station names, freight
 transloading centers, and freight tariffs.  The wealth of railroad
 information obtained from the two volumes of the 1954 tariff manual
 and their supplements emphasizes the increasing need for similar
 sources to provide corresponding detailed information on passenger
 traffic, trains, and stations.   (SECRET)

 PRESENT STATUS OF THE BORDER BETWEEN EAST AND WEST GERMANY
 The border between East and West Germany marks the westernmost
 extension of Soviet-dominated territory in Europe and exemplifies
 the meaning of the term "Iron Curtain."  With the recent attainment
 of sovereignty by West Germany, the border area takes on added sig-
 nificance.
 On 12 September 1944, 8 months before the end of the European
 phase of World War II, the European Advisory Commission (EAC), meet-
 ing in London, adopted a protocol between the Governments of the
 United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the Union of
 Soviet Socialist Republics regarding zones of occupation in Germany.
 This document provided that "Germany, within her [international]
 frontiers as they were on the 31st December, 1937, will, for the
 purposes of occupation, be divided into three zones, one of which
 will be allotted to each of the three powers .  .  ."  The provisions
 of this protocol were later (26 July 19+5) amended to include France
 as a participating power.
 As a consequence of the EAC decision, present-day Germany is
 divided into two major political_spheres, the Federal Republic of
 Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland) and the so-called German Demo-
 cratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik).  Until 5 May 1955
 the former (the West Zone) consisted of the American, British, and
 French Zones of Occupation; the latter (the East Zone) is occupied

 by the Soviet Union.  Apparently by coincidence, the demarcation line
 separating East and West Germany follows almost exactly the German-
 Slavic frontier of the early Middle Ages.
 Although several major rectifications and numerous minor changes
 have occurred along the original zonal boundary, the present line
 remains basically the same as that agreed upon by the Allied Powers
 in 1944.  Presumably, that line was never intended to be more than
 a temporary, stopgap line of delineation, but differences in the
 interpretation of the course of the zonal boundaries have created
 many problems and led to numerous border incidents.  (See Map Intelli-
 gence Review No. 36-s-6, June 1953, P? 12?)
 The legal line of demarcation originally agreed upon by the EAC
 established the frontier along the boundaries of the old German
 Lander (states) as they existed in 1941.  The right of modification
 was given to the field commanders, and various boundary rectifications
 took place in both the British and American Zones.  Several important
 alterations in the British Zone, made in 19+5 with the approval of
 the Allied Control Council, were in the Elbe River and Blankenburg
 areas (see the locational map, No. 13868, Insets A and B).  The
 most important rectification in the American Zone was the Witzen-
 hausen exchange (shown on map 13868).  This deviation in the boundary
 line in Landkreis (rural county) Witzenhausen, Hesse (Hessen), was
 established by written agreement between the U.S. commanding officer,

 Brigadier General Sexton, and the Soviet commanding officer, Major
 General Askalepov, on 17 September l945.*  In some instances, adjust-
 ments along the border have been made by local verbal agreements
 between the military authorities of opposite zones.  As a result, a
 "common usage" boundary, tacitly recognized by both East and West
 German authorities, has been established in many areas along the
 border.
 Other alterations in the legal boundary were made as a direct
 outcome of the activities of a surveying team of the British Army of
 the Rhine (Survey Department) and its Soviet counterpart.  An effort
 was made to straighten out the boundary and to make minor adjustments
 where it would be of tactical use to either side.  These were accom-
 plished mostly by following property fence lines or by moving the
 boundary from the middle of a road to the eastern or western edge
 so that the road would be entirely within the jurisdiction of one
 of the occupation powers.**  Although the legality of a boundary line
 thus determined is doubtful because of the lack of written approval,
 this official type of border rectification furnishes a point of
 departure for future negotiations.  The combined British-Soviet

 survey has left certain areas in dispute, however, and the problem
 still remains unresolved.
 In many instances, the Volkspolizei (East German Border Police)
 in fixing their frontier positions (digging plowed strips and erect-
 ing barbed-wire fences) have established border areas that are virtu-
 ally a "no man's land."  This has been done both for convenience and to
 help prevent defection to the West by persons living in close proxim-
 ity to the border.  Agriculturally productive parts of such areas
 are being used by farmers of the German, Federal Republic -- chiefly
 for growing hay, since they feel that their hold on the land is too
 uncertain to justify more intensive cultivation.
 In the brown-coal areas, the pits and work-heads were left in
 the same zone wherever possible.  In one area, the boundary line
 was drawn to allow quarries that were actually in the West Zone to
 be included in the East Zone, where the crusher and processor were
 located.  In several instances where city forests were in one zone
 and the city in another, the forests were reallocated for the con-
 venience of the local residents.
 The modifications cited point up one of the principal diffi-
 culties in discussing the border between East and West Germany --
 the fact that the legal or official boundaries are not always the
 "status quo" or actual boundaries.  The frontier as it exists on
 the ground -- the usage boundary -- is shown on maps of the

 Bundesgrenzschutz (Federal Border Police),* which reflect the informal
 exchanges accomplished by American, British, and Soviet withdrawals
 from the agreed-upon boundary.  In general, exact delineation of the
 British-Soviet Zone boundary becomes more difficult as the American
 Zone boundary is approached.
 In the American Zone, however, the boundary problem is much
 less acute than in the British Zone.  The major border problem was
 in the Witzenhausen area previously mentioned.  In several sections
 of the American-Soviet border the Volkspolizei have not always seen
 fit to establish their boundary coincidental with the legal boundary,
 and, as in the British Zone, have left a rather extensive area in
 a no-man's land status.  Consequently, the Bundesgrenzschutz have
 moved up to the Soviet boundary, annexing a large area to the east
 of the legal boundary and producing another usage line.  For the
 remainder of the American Zone, the legal and usage boundaries are
 almost identical, except for several small areas such as Theobaldshof,

 black line.  The boundary itself is drawn in the East German Zone,
 with the side toward the British and American Zones representing the
 actual frontier.

 13868).*
 Recent information indicates that local West German Kreis (county)
 officers have been given permission to exchange lots immediately
 adjacent to the frontier with East German zonal authorities.  It is
 entirely possible, therefore, that the usage line will again be
 changed in the immediate future.  While the changes will not, in all
 probability, be extensive, they may conceivably be large enough to
 be represented on a 1:25,000 map.
 Much of the difficulty in determining the exact delineation of
 the frontier can be attributed to the Soviet attitude that the present
 boundary is not an international frontier between two sovereign na-
 tions but merely an internal administrative boundary for the use of
 the occupation powers.  In recent years, the USSR has remained unco-
 operative and unwilling to put on paper anything concerning the
 delimitation of the border.  (SECRET)

 THE 1954 CENSUS OF FRANCE
 The 1954 census of the population of France is the twenty-
 seventh systematic count of its inhabitants since the first census
 in 1801.  It is particularly significant because it is the only cen-
 sus taken since 1936 that accurately reflects the normal economic,
 social, and political life of the country since World War II.  Nor-
 mally, the French census has been taken every 5 years.  However, no
 count could be made in 191+1; although a census was taken in 1946,
 it reflected the abnormally unsettled conditions following World War
 II.  At that time the social and economic life of the French people
 had been completely disrupted by military occupation and extensive
 destruction of homes, industrial plants, and transportation facili-
 ties.                          A census was scheduled for 1951, a year when many countries
 of Western Europe counted their populations, but it was postponed
 for financial reasons.
 After experiencing a declining birthrate for many years, France
 has now reached a turning point.  Since 1946, there has been a popu-
 lation increase of more than 2,270,000, an average annual rate of
 300,000.  To the census total of 42,771,500 must be added 187,000
 French citizens temporarily residing outside the country and an
 estimated 38,000 other persons not officially counted.  This brings
 the total population of France today to approximately 43,000,000, or
 roughly 10 percent of the total for Europe excluding the European

 USSR.  Although the 195+ figures are affected to some extent by a
 decrease in the general death rate and the infant-mortality rate,
 the population increase results primarily from a rise in the birthrate.
 According to the 195+ census, two traditional French characteris-
 tics remain constant:   (1) the dominance of one metropolitan center,
 Paris, over all other cities; and (2) the wide distribution of com-
 munes (administrative divisions roughly comparable to American town-
 ships) with very small populations.  The six and a half million in-
 habitants of "Greater Paris" comprise about 15 percent of the total
 population of France. Actually, the population in the city itself is
 increasing very slowly, having gained only 0.7 percent between 1936
 and 1954.  During the same period the suburbs, which are largely
 industrial, have been gaining on an increasing ratio from the city
 outward.   Those in the immediate environs of Paris have increased 8
 percent, whereas the more remote suburbs have gained more than 20
 percent.*  The increase in rural population is spread fairly evenly
 throughout the 69 departments that have gained in population since
 1946.  In the remaining 21 of the 90 French departments comprising
 Metropolitan France, the population has declined since that date.
 About half of the French population is divided among more than
 37,000 communes with less than 5,000 inhabitants, of which some

 10,000 have less than 200
 inhabitants each.  The other
 half lives in the slightly
 less than 1,000 larger com-
 munes with at least 5,000
 inhabitants.
 Aside from the marked
 increase in the Paris area,
 the general movement of
 population has been toward
 smaller industrial areas
 an.. ports.  This shift
 from farms to widely separated cities and towns is not so much postwar
 resettlement as a reflection of an economic trend toward concentration
 of wealth in urban areas.  Although France is still primarily agricul-
 tural, the largest population increase between 1936 and 1954, two "nor-
 mal" years, is in prosperous areas -- Paris, the industrial North, the
 Rhone Valley, and a number of scattered cities including Bordeaux and
 Toulouse.  The greatest decline has been in central, western, and south-
 western France and in Corsica -- all areas that are becoming poorer.*

 French social and industrial planners, as well as Government
 administrators, have long looked forward to currently accurate figures
 on which to base their studies.  Since the publication of the 195+
 Census, a Joint Colmnittee, with members from the Ministries of
 Labor, Industry, and Housing and Reconstruction, has been set up to
 study the problem of proposed decentralization of industry.  Several
 other long-range projects are in progress in the Institute of Statis-
 tics and Economic Studies (Institut National de la Statistigue et
 des Ptudes ~conomiques; INSEE), an official organization that conducts
 various occupational and regional studies and maintains a file of
 unusually detailed statistics on the communes.  During the past 10
 years the Institute has borne the burden of trying to analyze and
 evaluate social and economic situations from the only available
 official population figures, which confused rather than clarified the
 problems.  The 1954 census, in spite of minor inaccuracies, is a
 sound first step toward better studies.  (UNCLASSIFIED)

 SOVIET INTEREST IN OBLIQUE MERCATOR NAVIGATION CHARTS

 Because of the paucity of current intelligence on Soviet aerial-
 navigation charts and devices, any evidence that indicates possible
 developmental trends becomes of considerable interest.  Recently it
 was learned that the Soviets had acquired information concerning the
 construction and operation of a German wartime plotting board for use
 aboard the aircraft to indicate its position on a specially prepared   25X1X
 By the end of World War II the Germans had developed an automatic
 plotting board that indicated continuously the position of an aircraft
 in flight.  The plotting board was used in conjunction with separate
 radar equipment, matching features at the indicated flight position on
 the chart with the view presented on the radarscope.  Such correlation
 opened the way to further study of radar images and effects and pro-
 vided a means of checking and correcting the position of the aircraft
 on the chart.
 With the plotting device, geographic position is indicated by the
 intersection of two wires at right angles to each other, which move
 laterally across the underside of a translucent Mercator chart.  A
 speed-integrating mechanism continuously adds the changes in position
 due to aircraft speed and wind velocity, thereby controlling the move-

 ment of the wires.  As the intersection point moves across the edge
 of the chart a new intersection point appears at the corresponding
 point of entry on the adjoining chart.  The shift is accomplished by
 means of two endless-belt systems at right angles to each other, each
 of which carries three parallel wires, one of which is always in view
 on the chart.  The charts in the plotting device are evidently changed
 manually.
 The source passed on to the Soviets the information needed for
 computing the charts essential to the automatic plotting device.  The
 mathematical formulas giving grid intersections in terms of new rec-
 tangular grid coordinates were thus made available to the Soviets,
 and several charts were actually computed and compiled for them.
 Since the speed-integration mechanism does not compensate for scale
 variation over the chart area, the scale on each chart has to be
 nearly constant throughout.  The Mercator projection, besides being
 conformal, has very small scale variation near the axis of strength.
 The German charts were compiled as a continuous series of Mercator
 maps with a common "equator" coincident with the meridian of longitude.
 Adjoining sheets matched at the edges.  Depending upon the scale, the
 meridians of coincidence were spaced at 3- or 6-degree intervals to
 complete the coverage of an area embracing considerable range of
 longitude.  The scale preferred by the Germans for the automatic
 plotting device seems to have been 1:1,000,000, but other scales can
 be used by resetting the. integrating mechanism.  By restricting the

 area of a given chart to a narrow band on either side of the "equator,"
 the scale variation on any chart becomes negligible.  A straight line
 approximates a great circle very closely.  It is possible to compare
 oblique Mercator charts with any orientation of the projection
 "equator" and still retain the desirable navigational properties of
 conformality and almost uniform scale.
 Although he did not reveal to
 them the correlated use of the plotting device and radar, this,possi-
 bility could hardly have escaped notice, since the instrument for
 aerial navigation alone has obvious limitations.  Without the use of
 radar, the cumulative growth of positional error would become intol-
 erable on long flights.  The Soviets never intimated to the source
 that they were undertaking programs along such lines and any conclu-
 sions drawn are entirely speculative.  Nevertheless, it may be assumed
 that the German devices have been thoroughly weighed to determine what
 advantages would accrue to the Soviets through their use.  (SECRET)

 NEW PROVINCES IN TURKEY
 The pattern of Turkish provinces remained remarkably stable
 during the early postwar years despite some changes in their constit-
 uent districts.*  The creation of new provinces in 1953 and 1954,
 therefore, occasioned more than routine interest, as to both the rea-
 son for the changes and the method of carrying them out.  From 1946
 until 1953, Turkey had 63 provinces.  The 64th province, called Uqak,
 was formed in 1953; after the 1954 elections, two more -- Adiyaman
 and Sakarya -- were created, and another new province -- Nev9ehir --
 was formed largely from Kirsehir Province, which was disbanded.
 The creation of the new units is closely connected with the
 Turkish political scene.  Adiyaman was formerly the largest district
 in Malatya, the home province of Ismet Inonu, titular head of the
 Republican People's Party (RPP) and President of Turkey from 1936 to
 1950.  For that reason the designation of Adiyaman as a separate
 province has been called a vindictive act of the rival and now ruling
 Democrat Party (DP).  On the other hand, the creation of Sakarya has
 been explained as merely the fulfillment of a campaign promise of
 Prime Minister Menderes of the Democrat Party.  Another reason advanced
 for the creation of Adiyaman and Sakaraya was the desire to improve
 *The Turkish term for province is vilayet or il; for district,

 local economic conditions and provide more local representation and
 a greater degree of self-government.  Economic and political improve-
 ment was also given as a reason for the creation of U9ak in 1953?
 Unfortunately, the absence of exact details makes it difficult to
 determine how much truth there is in such high-sounding explanations.
 In any event, the political reasons have substance, and nowhere more so
 than in the case of?the creation of Nevsehir.
 Nevsehir was created primarily out of the dissolved Kir9ehir
 Province, plus two districts from Nigde and one from Kayseri.  Of the
 two remaining districts of Kirgehir, one each was attached to the
 provinces of Ankara and Yozgat.  Behind the creation of Nevsehir is
 the effort of the Democrat Party to gerrymander out of existence its
 principal rival in the area, the Republican National Party (RNP).  In
 the 2 May 1954 deputorial elections the RNP swept all five of the
 available seats allotted to the now defunct Kirgehir Province.  Prime
 Minister Menderes, though maintaining that the move had economic
 justification, left little doubt as to his real motive by accusing the
 RNP of political corruption.
 The accompanying map, No. 13866, shows the new provinces and
 their districts.  In addition, the districts comprising the new prov-
 inces, as well as those newly attached to old provinces, are listed
 in the following table.

 THAI-MEO AUTONOMOUS ZONE CREATED IN VIETNAM
 On 29 April 1955, Ho Chi Minh, as President of the Communist
 Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), issued Decree No.
 230 SL, Hanoi, for the formation of a Thai-Meo Autonomous Zone (see
 map No. 13874).    The formal creation of the "autonomous" area was
 announced at a congress of various tribal peoples of northwest Vietnam
 that convened in Son to Province on 7 May 1955, the anniversary of the
 fall of Dien Bien Phu.  Thus, an old Communist political-administrative
 device is being used in Vietnam, the newest of the "People's Democra-
 cies."
 Mao Tse-Tung in 1938 adopted for China the standard Communist
 line on the minority question -- "equal rights for minority peoples,
 and respect for and development of minority cultures and religions."
 Communist China has assiduously followed this line in dealing with
 its 35 millions of minority peoples, creating 24 autonomous areas
 between mid-1953 and early 1955.  The "autonomous zone" concept, with
 its emphasis on the rights of minorities, is, of course, actually a
 sop thrown to a minority people to help obtain its support for the
 Communist administration.  When successful, this administrative device
 also eliminates potential bases for dissident groups.
 The new Thai-Meo Autonomous Zone is similar in extent to the
 former autonomous Thai state (Federation of the Land of Thai) created
 by the French in March 1948. it includes an area of 19,300 square

 miles, bounded on the north by China, on the west and south by Laos,
 and on the east by the Fan Si Pan Mountains of Vietnam.  The Zone has
 three administrative levels:     khu, zone; chau, division (equivalent
 to a district in the provinces); and xa, village.  The provincial
 level has been eliminated.  The 16 chau of the Zone include all the
 districts of the former provinces of Son La and Lai Chau, plus Phong
 Tho district from Lao Kay Province and Than Uyen and Van Chan districts
 from Yen Bai Province.
 The total population of the Thai-Meo Zone is estimated at
 330,000.  The two largest racial groups are the Thai and the Meo,
 numbering 190,000 and 60,000, respectively.  Other minority groups
 are the Man, Muong, Puoc, Xa, and U Ni tribal peoples.  According to
 the Decree of 29 April, if a smaller minority group lives within an
 area occupied by a larger group, a separate autonomous area will be
 formed for the smaller group.  Such a small autonomous area will be
 administered directly and will have the rating of a khu or chau,
 depending on its size.  Areas within the Zone that are inhabited
 predominantly by Vietnamese will not be made autonomous areas but will
 have the same administrative pattern as the rest of the country.
 The Thai-Meo Zone is largely an undeveloped mountainous area.
 Except for a paved road connecting the towns of Lai Chau and Son La
 with the Hanoi area and a link from this road to Dien Bien Phu,
 transportation is generally over jungle trails or by river.  The
 economy is primitive, consisting chiefly of shifting agriculture,

 fishing, and hunting.  The opium poppy, generally the cash crop of
 the Meo tribes, is of some economic importance.  During the recent
 fighting in Indochina the Viet Minh used opium from this area and
 adjoining areas of Laos as a medium of exchange in the Hong Kong
 market to obtain items that the Chinese Communists were unable to
 furnish, such as medicine.
 Traditionally, settlement has been altitudinally stratified,
 with the Vietnamese living at the lowest elevations and the Thai and
 other tribes at much higher elevations.  The tribes have long had a
 mountaineer's aversion for the lowland Vietnamese -- a dislike that
 has been strengthened by unprofitable trade dealings with the more
 sophisticated Vietnamese.  Undoubtedly the Viet Minh hope that the
 Decree, with its guarantees in respect to local mores and languages,
 will mollify this aversion, which borders on hatred.
 Equally important is the relationship of the Autonomous Zone to
 Laos.  At present the Laotian provinces of Phong Saly and Houa Phan
 (Sam Neua) are occupied by members of the Communist Pathet Lao Party.
 These two isolated provinces, which adjoin the new Autonomous Zone,
 were designated at the Geneva Conference as a strictly temporary
 grouping location for the Pathet Lao Party, but in typical Communist
 fashion the Party has been consolidating its strength in the area.
 However, the Laotian people, like the Thai, to whom they are ethni-
 cally related, have a strong dislike for the Vietnamese, a feeling
 that has been strengthened by the Viet Minh Army incursions.

 Communist propaganda broadcasts beamed at Laos will probably continue
 to dwell on the "cultural and economic benefits being enjoyed" by the
 minorities in the Thai-Meo Autonomous Zone.  In this way the Communists
 hope to soften the Laotians, as well as Meo and other minorities living
 within Laos, and thus pave the way for future political or military
 action in that country.  (CONFIDENTIAL)

 SPELLING CHANGES IN RUMANIAN PLACE NAMES
 The application of the new Rumanian orthographic rules to geo-
 graphic names is apparently as confusing to Editura de Stat pentru
 Literatur'd Ptiinjifickf (the Rumanian State Publishing House for
 Scientific Literature) as to the Western nations.  Which of the 16
 spelling rules enumerated in the Council of Ministers Decree No. 3135,
 5 October 1953, are applicable to geographic names is still not clear.
 The general confusion resulting is reflected by official maps and
 directories published in 1954 by Editura de Stat.
 Indicator Alfabetic al Localittilor din Republica Popular'
 Rom2n' (Alphabetic Index to Rumanian Localities), Editura de Stat,
 Bucuresti, 1954, is assumed to be the authoritative directory for
 official Rumanian use.  This directory contains a complete alphabet-
 ical listing of settlements and of first-, second-, and third-order
 administrative divisions, supplemented by a map showing first- and
 second-order administrative division boundaries.  The geographic
 names are purportedly spelled according to the new orthographic
 rules.  A comparison of these names with those spelled according to
 the old orthography in Imp'rtirea Administrativ-EconomiceL a Repu-
 blicii Populare Rommne (Administrative Economic Divisions of Rumania),
 Bucuresti, 1952, reveals only one significant spelling change that
 has been made consistently -- the replacement of the abolished letter

 "A" by the letter "i."  Barlad becomes B^irlad, for example, and
 C~tmpulung becomes C'impulung.  Therefore, a revision of geographic-
 name spellings on existing maps and gazetteers to make them agree
 with the directory should in most cases involve merely the substi-
 tution of the letter "'i" for "a."                         The Rumanians, however, do not
 consistently abide by the new spellings.
 An additional spelling change is reflected on the most recent
 official Rumanian map accessioned by the CIA Map Library, Republica
 Popular' Romina Harta Politico-Economics (Political-Economic Map of
 the Rumanian People's Republic) published by Editura de Stat in 1954.*
 On this map the letter "e" following vowels is consistently replaced
 by the dipthong "ie."  Consequently Ploe9ti becomes Ploie9ti, Sncueni
 becomes $ cuieni, and ''argu-Sacuesc becomes 'I rgu-Sb cuiesc .
 Still other rules enumerated in Decree No. 3135 have not yet
 been applied to geographic names, among them the rule abolishing the
 final "u," which had already disappeared from the spoken language.
 Whether or not future maps will introduce additional spelling
 changes remains to be seen.  Until a larger number of representative
 maps becomes available from which some general pattern of spelling
 can be discerned, no reliable standards for the treatment of Rumanian
 geographic names can be established. (UNCLASSIFIED)

 REVISED ITALIAN ATLAS
 Noteworthy among the European atlases that have recently become
 available is a new edition of the Atlante Internazionale* published
 by the Touring Club Italiano (TCI).  The volume, dated 1955-56,
 incorporates features not found in the last previous edition (1951)
 while maintaining the high cartographic and typographic standards
 that have for many years made TCI publications outstanding.
 The main innovation of the new edition is a looseleaf format
 that permits the insertion of new and revised maps as they become
 available.  Maps will be issued in groups of 12, of which two groups,
 comprising about one-fourth the total number of projected maps, are
 now available.
 The maps issued to date cover the United States at scales ranging
 from 1:1,500,000 to 1:3,000,000 and various countries of western
 Europe at 1:750,000 to 1:3,000,000.  Also included are maps of north-
 western South America (1:10,000,000), Israel and Lebanon (1:1,500,000),
 various Far Eastern countries (1:3,000,000 to 1:5,000,000), and
 Central Asia and southern Siberia (1:7,500,000).  The Benelux map at
 1:750,000, the map of Israel and Lebanon, and the map of Central Asia
 are completely new; the others are revisions of old maps.

 Announced plans indicate that new maps covering Central America
 and the West Indies, various islands of the southwest Pacific, the
 Middle East, and European Russia are in preparation.  The other maps
 planned require revision only.  The place-name index, a prominent
 feature of past editions, will probably be the last part of the atlas
 to be completed.
 In its format and style, the new edition, like its predecessors,
 reflects the emphasis on tradition, precision, and artistic finesse
 that has long been characteristic of Italian cartography.  For example,
 all names on the maps are hand lettered, hachuring is used extensively,
 and some of the maps required as many as 14 color plates.  Maps of
 comparable quality can be produced in the United States, but will not
 appear in quantity unless several million Americans get around to
 appreciating and paying for the difference between artistically per-
 fect maps and less elaborate ones that are equally useful.

 NEW ECONOMIC ATLAS OF THE WORLD
 An exceptionally well-organized and up-to-date economic atlas of
 the world was published in 1954 by the Oxford University Press.*  The
 relatively small volume (7-3/411 x 10-1/2"; 157 pages) presents an
 impressive array of data on the production of specific commodities
 while also portraying such background factors as climate, relief,
 soils, and communications.
 The atlas is in two main parts:  (1) a section consisting of
 background maps and production maps covering 150 commodities; and
 (2) a textual-statistical section in which countries are listed alpha-
 betically and data on area, land use, population, communications,
 currency, exchange rates, production, employment, and trade are given
 for each.  The production maps are generally based on three or more
 representative years during the period between 1948 and 1952.  In the
 statistical section, figures are often given for several prewar years
 as well as for postwar years.
 The recency of the data is outstanding for a work of world cov-
 erage and extensive subject scope.  For example, the iron-ore map
 reflects the exploitation of Canadian, Venezuelan, and Liberian
 deposits; and the map of uranium-producing areas includes a textual
 summary on nuclear fuels.

 To save space, all but a few of the world maps are prepared on
 the Oxford projection, an equal-area projection on which most of the
 Atlantic and Pacific Ocean areas have been omitted.  The general and
 background maps range in scale from 1:6,000,000 to 1:150,000,000 and
 the production maps from 1:100,000,000 to 1:200,000,000.  Although
 some of the maps are crowded, nearly all are legible and reasonably
 easy to interpret.  Among the few unsuccessful maps is one that
 attempts to give the names of the important rayon-producing centers
 of the world at the scale of 1:100,000,000.  Aware of the limitations
 of small-scale maps, the compilers intend to follow up the world atlas
 with regional atlases in much greater detail.  Volumes on the USSR and
 Eastern Europe and on the United States and Canada are specifically
 mentioned as being planned.
 A rich assortment of interpretive textual data, tables, and
 graphs appears on the maps and on adjoining pages.  This information
 aids the user in interpreting the maps and also covers some subjects
 that cannot be treated with equal clarity in map form, such as long-
 range production trends, various trade patterns, and developments for
 which available data are incomplete.
 Among the background maps is one on international blocs that
 gives a breakdown of the British Commonwealth and an interesting, as-
 seen-from-Britain view of the progress of dependent territories toward
 self-government.  In the first classification, independent member
 countries -- Australia, Canada, India, etc. -- are listed along with

 the United Kingdom as entities of equal rank.  In the next four cate-
 gories, dependent territories are listed, beginning with those that
 are partly self-governing and ending with those that have little or
 no autonomy.  In a note of monumental tact, it is explained that
 dependent Commonwealth countries ". . . are, as it were, in a 'pro-
 cession' towards independence and self-government:  the order of the
 procession varies and cannot always be precisely stated."
 On the whole, the atlas is a remarkably compact, complete, and
 up-to-date work.  Some of the maps have cartographic shortcomings,
 but these are not serious and seem to be more than outweighed by the
 recency of the data.  The volume should be a highly useful addition
 to the reference tools of economic-geographic intelligence.
