 IDEOLOGICAL WEAKNESSES:
 There is considerably less radio discussion of ideological fail rgs-than in previous
 months, and the criticism of that aspect of Soviet life is less virulent.  A
 number of items dealtrrg-with-matters of ideology-tn'tb  period-under -review
 appeared in the-press but have not been broadcast.  Discvasing-education in the
 Rostov Oblast universities and technical colleges, MOLOT (28-May) says that it
 would be "incorrect and harmful" not to see the grave shortcomings in the work of
 a number of higher educational institutions.
 In the Novecherkasek Polytechnical -Institute, the Rostov Institute-of Railroad
 Engineers, and several other institutions the teaching of specialized subjects is
 said to be "divorced from the realities of life." This favorite Soviet expression
 applies primarily --ta   rxist dialectics.  Since- every- academic subject, from
 nuclear fission to ancient Greek literature, must be taught against -the -background
 of Marxism-Leninism, the failure to adapt-that--theory -to revery -type -of -university
 instruction is variously referred to as "political illiteracy", "harmful careless-
 ness" or worse.  To train large numbers of specialists in various fields, the
 editorial concludes, is -not enough:  It is the duty of the higherinstitutions of
 learning  to give the Fatherland new cadres of specialists faithful-to-the task of
 Lenin and Stalin."  That faith, it is implied, can be acquireet only through a
 profound study of the theory of Lenin and Stalin which is "inseparable"
 (nerazdelima) from any scientific or technical endeavor.
 The ideological application to the teaching of social sciences is the subject of
 discussion in a Grigoryan article carried by PRAVDA on 28 May -(not broadcast).
 The guiding -principle in-the teaching of social sciences, the author says,
 is to train "Lenirrists, " and that term- implies considerably -more than a -narrow
 specialization in'any branch of science or technology.  A "Leninist", as defined
 by Grigoryan, is a politico-social activist familiar with the laws of societal
 development and capable of participating in the political leadership of-the country.
 Talmudism and "uncritical attitude" (nachetnichestvo), says the article, still
 characterize the work of many Armenian universities and institutes.  Thus in the
 Republic's institutes of agriculture, pedagogy and physical culture, the
 ideological end of the work is said-to have been relegated to a secondary place:
 The basic contrast between-bourgeois and pro-
 letarian ideology and the superiority of the
 Soviet Socialist Regime over that of capitalism
 do not get satisfactory treatment.

 Russian version:
 lleudovletvoritelno raskeyvayetsya korennaya protivo-

 KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA (29 May) refers in general terms to the favorable effect
 on artistic and literary :activities as well as on scientific research in the
 Republic produced by the "intensification of attention"  (boleye napriazhennoye
 vnimanie) to the ideologi:ca" education of the Communists and non-partisans alike.
 The only shortcoming in that work, according to the paper, is that it is "still
 lagging behind the growing demands", in other words, unsatisfactory.  Mass
 ideological and political work should be widely developed "in the homes of the
 people" so that the "remnants of capitalism" in their minds may be eradicated for
 all. time.  There is no further amplification of this point, however.
 The Kazakh Party organizations are responsible for the wrong impression of past
 and present Kazakh life produced by the exhibits in a number of the Republic's
 museums, according to a dispatch by Zemtsov (29 May).  Many museum officials,
 he says, have "glossed over" (nroshli mimo) the fact that the union of the
 Kazakh people with the Russians was motivated by their desire to save their native
 land from foreign invaders.  All one gathers from viewing the various museum
 exhibits, says the dispatch, is that Kazakhstan was annexed to Russia by an
 imperial decree, and that is a "crude falsification" (grubaya falsifikatsia)
 of an historical event:
 ...concealed from the museum visitors is the his-
 torical fact that the Kazakh people saw in their
 union with Russia the salvation of their native land from
 foreign invaders and a method of overcoming their
 backwardness.
 i
 Russian version:
 ...o :t oosetit~ley muzeya skryt tot istoricheskiy
 fak-t;, chto kazakhskiy narod v prisoyedinenii k Rossii
 spravedlivo videl spasenie svoey rodiny of chuzhe-
 zenaiykh zakhvatc.hikov, videl put k preodoleniu svoey
 otstalosti.
 Another serious aberration   om the prevailing ideological line is the failure
 to "explain" that the strur?2e of the Kazakh people against their exploiters had
 merged (slila3) with the rr?-'?-iutionary fight of the Russian working class against
 the bourgeois-.landlord r,      for a Socialist revolution.  Nor is the present
 life and development of the Kazakhstan Republic properly reflected in the
 museum exhibits.  Most of tLem are said to be dealing with the past which, as
 has already been vointed,out, is frequently distorted beyond recognition.  Thus
 in the Kokchetav regional museum, the pre -revolutionary life of Kazakhstan is
 presented in the shape of luxurious Beys' tents and their women's fancy clothes,
 but there is aot a single exhibit showing the impoverished life of the Kazakh
 working class.  One looks in, vain (tshchetno iskat) for exhibits portraying the
 present life and prosperity of the Reoublic, says Zemtsov in conclusion.  Such
 is the case, for example, in the Guryev, Kokchetav, and Dzhambul regional museums:
 "Such museums in effect deprive the visitors of the possibility of juxtaposing the
 joyful present with the damned na;;t" (Takoy muzey po sushchestvu lishayet posetiteley
 vozmozhnosti sopostavit radostnnye nastoyashcheye a proklyatym proshlym).
 The Ukraine's ideological deportment is again the object of Moscow's attention

 at times disappointing ideological progress. Seventy percent of the deputy directors
 of the Academy's scientific-research institutions are said to lack ideological
 and academic training for their jobs.  That, it is claimed, goes a long way towards
 explaining the unsatisfactory research progress achieved. inTthewffields ofe
 linguistics, history, philosophy, ethnography and Ukrainian Committee for Arts is "still characterized by rude mistakes and
 bourgeois-nationalist distortions" despite the strong warning against such
 deviations issued by the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party several
 months ago.  Referring to the low ideological level of university instruction,
 particularly in social sciences, the article points out that among the Republici's
 215 heads of Social Science Departments there is only one Professor and one Doctor
 of Sciences, while none of the heads of the Marxism-Leninism Departments has any
 academic degree at all.  The article is particularly critical of the ideological
 deterioration (ideologicheskoye razlozhenie) that has been noted in the matter of
 training propaganda personnel.  This "most important business" (vazbneysheye
 delo) is said to have been criminally neglected by the Central Committee's
 Denartmentt of Agitation and  Propaganda.  In 1946, 35% of the Propaganda Department
 managers at the rayon and city Party Committees were university graduates, but'ithe
 present number of degree-holders is only 21%.
 Socialist competition between Russian and Ukrainian collective farms designed
 to "strengthen the friendship" (krepit          between        nations has been
 going on for several  years although, for some reason or other,
 friendly relations has never been given much publicity.  Referring to the subject
 on 5 June, a special Ukrainian-language broadcast from Poltava indicates that
 Russo-Ukrainian agricultural competition will henceforth be promoted on an
 increasing scale.  Aq implied in the case of the currently competing "Molotov"
 (Ukraine)and "Luch" (RSFSR) collective farms; the "elder brothel' attitude charac-
 terizing the relations between the two Republics also dominates the friendly competi-
 tion between individual farms.  Thus in an interview arranged between the leaders
 of the mentioned farms, both presumably model kolkhozes, it is emphasized thatlthe
 Ukrainians are far behind their Russian competitors.  For example, the stock
 of cattle in both kolkhozes is "nearly the same" but the 1951 milk yield per
 Russian cow was 4,000 liters whereas the Ukrainian cow was able to produce
 "only half of that."  The interview ends with the Russian livestock farm
 manager advising the Ukrainian Solkhoz to pay more attention to the selection of
 breeding stock in order to increase the milk yields, and the Ukrainian responding
 that "his remark has been accepted as correct."
 Crimean Ht  tore   n Be Ra rittpn- ,The joint scientific session of the History and
 Philosophy Departments of the Crimean branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences
 recently held at Simferopol, is told that the history of Crimea as currently
 presented is all wrong, according'to a broadcast of 4 June.  The impending
 official change of the peninsula's past was keynoted in Academician Grekov's
 opening speech which referred darkly to the "grave errors" that have crept into
 the treatment of this subject.
 The prevailing belief that the Crimea was the original homeland of the Goths, Khazars, Genoans, Tartars, and Turks stems from "Marr's scholastic, anti-
 scientific conception in the matter of the Slavs' origin" (skholasticheskaya,
 anti-nauchnaya kontseptsia Marra v voprosakh elnogeneza slavyan).  The Slavs, it
 is claimed had inhabited the peninsula even before the formation of the Kiev
 Principality, and their cultural influence has since predominated in the life of
 the population.  The reason for this misinterpretation of the true history of
 the Crimea, as pointed out at the session, is that it had always been studied
 and publicized "as something apart" (v otryve) from the history of the Russian
 State.
 Crimean archeologists studying the country's past are said to have "established
 the presence of Slavs" (ustanovili nalichie slavyan) in that area as far back,
 as the Third Century.  The affirmation of bourgeois scientist's that a Goth State
 existed on the peninsula at that time is refuted as a pure "invention" (vymysel)

 which unfortunately is reflected also in the works of certain Soviet historians.
 The latter are sharply criticized for "exaggerating the historial role" (preuvelichenie
 istoricheskoy roll) of Byzantium, the Goths and the Tartar Khanate in Crimea.  Those
 people, it is revealed, were among the aliens who constituted an insignificant
 part of the native Slav population and were quickly assimilated.  (An apparently
 irrelevant item on the sessions agenda was Zagorodsky's report proving "with
 concrete documents' inn konkretnykh'idokumentakh/ that the Anglo-American-French
 intervention in Crimea in 1918-1920, was noted for its mass murder and violence).
 The decision adopted by the scientific session calls for a thoroughgoing revision
 of the history of Crimea with al view to eliminating from it "all sorts of distor-
 tions, oversimplification, uncritical approach, and Talmudism", as outlined in
 Stalins "Marxism and Questions of Linquisties"o
 In view oftbe' numerous distortions in the history
 of Crimea, the session found it necessary to revise
 the historical and reference literature published in
 the postwar period,, particularly the text books; to
 reconstruct the exhibits of the Crimean museums to
 conform to tke, new scientific data in the field of
 history, and to devote more attention to the training
 Crimean historians .

 The ideological heterodoxy of Klirghizi SSR is dealt with in a lengthy Lukin
 report to FRAVDA from Frunze (8 nine., not broadcast), and is also referred to in
 the paper's editorial of the same date.  The plenary session of the Central
 Committee of the Kirghiz Gommunist!Party, called to review the ideological
 situation in the Republic, is reported to have revealed a variety of heresies
 ranging from the "misinte.rpretatior" of Kirghiz history to underestimation of
 iendship.
 the benefits of Russo-Kirgbiz friendship.
 t
 As pointed out by Central Committee Secretary Razzakov and others, the Republic's
 history and literature. as well a  the Kirghiz branch of the Academy of Sciences,
 are in need of a thoroiioh ideological overhauling.,  It is disclosed, as was the
 case in the other non-Russian republics, that the "progressive significance"
 (progress ivnoye znachenie) of the ';voluntary" union of Kirghizia and Russia does
 not get sufficient emphasis in Kirghiz history of literature.  Nor is the life of
 Soviet Kirghizia publicized much in contemporary literature--most of it stressing
 the country's prerevolutionary past instead.
 The works of the popular Kirghiz historian Bernshtam are said to be shot through
 with anti-Marxist and anti-Leninist interpretations.  Thus the 1898 Andizhan
 upriRing (against the Russians andllother foreigners) is presented as a national-
 liberation movement whereas itiwasiactually of "a reactionary character."  Prevalent
 among the Kirghiz men of letters is said to be the anti-Leninist "single stream
 theory" (teoria edinogo potoka) according to which all the native bards (ahyny)
 and poets of the 19th and early 20th century are portrayed as realists-democrats
 (realisty-demokraty) regardless, of!their political views and the class nature
 (klassovaya sushchnost) of the::r work. Pan-'Islamism, pan-Turkism, cosmopolitan
 tendencies. --I the "underestimation" (nedootsenka) of the role of Russian culture in the
 cultural development of the Kirghiz people are listed among the grave errors for
 which the Academy of Sciences and the Writers Union must assume major responsibility.

 Some of the Academy's institutes are referred to as "sterile enterprises" (besplodnie
 uchrezhdenia) which "for years" (godami) have not contributed anything to the
 national economy or culture.  Among them are the Institutes of Linguistics,
 Literature, and History.  The Kirghiz Writers Union, it is charged, is still
 tolerant of the nationalistic tendencies of some of its members.  Tokombayev's
 novel "The Bloody Years",, which is said to contain "elements of pessimism and
 decadence" (elementy pessimizma i upadochnichestva), was republished by the Writers
 Union despite the warning of the Republic's Fifth Party Congress several years ago.
 True to the pattern of Soviet ideological investigations, the Bureau of the Central
 Committee itself avows penitence for the un-Bolshevik mesa in the Republic's affairs.
 It is admitted, for example, that the Committee's secretary Orozaliev was "removed
 from his job" (snyat s raboty) last January for some unnamed ideological heresies.
 The Bureau also left unchallenged' the accusation that for a long period of time it
 "had kept secret the decision on the exposure of the bourgeois-nationalists" (der-
 zhalo v taine reshenie o razoblacbenii burzhuaznykh nataionalistov) who were active
 in the Academy of Sciences,
 f1n@   X AnnrQaeh to R1e1Jgina     ,hAQ,?e   In a lecture for the home audience on
 Socialism and Communism (6 July), Prof. Stepanyan speaks of the many ideological
 shortcomings to be eliminated in the transitional stage between the two systems.
 Some of the Soviet scientists, he says, still hold "idealistic and metaphysical
 views" (idealisticheskie i metaphizicheskie vozzrenia) which must be changed.  The
 survivals of capitalism among the population at large are characterized as un-
 Bolshevik attitude toward Socialist property, nationalist and religious prejudices,
 petty-bourgeois ethics and an irresponsible attitude toward the family.  It is against
 this "heritage of the past" that the Communist Party is said to be "taking decisive
 measures" (prinimavet reshitelniewmery).  Although the professor makes no reference
 to the nature of the mentioned measures, his implicit suggestion is that no such
 tactics are to be employed in. the fight against religion.  A gingerly approach to
 the question of religion is, it is implied, the corre.t line since administrative
 measures might do more harm than goods
 Extreme caution must be exercized in the struggle
 against religious prejudices.  Much harm is being done
 by those who offend religious sentiments in that struggle...
 One must avoid offending the religious sentiments
 of the faitbftl by crude administrative measures.

 Centralized control (edinonachalie-literally, one-man management) of industry
 is, according to FRAVDA (27 May), the basic principle of true Bolshevik economic
 leadership.  Such control., however, is unthinkable without constant and rigid
 supervision over every detail of the job since, according to Stalin, "it is from
 details that great projects emerge" (iz melochey stroyatsia velikie delay.
 Mentioned in this connection are a number of unnamed ministries, trusts, and other
 industrial organizations, but the Ministry of the Black Metallurgical Industry is
 singled out for editorial censure.  The "low level of management" (nixkiy uroven
 rukovodstva) of the Bakal ore mines, a vital sector of the Ural metal industry, is
 said to be due to the "lax supervision" exercized by the Ministry.  Those mines, it
 is asserted, have been working "unrythmically, with interruptions" (neritmiehno, s
 uryvkami) for a long time, and they are considerably behind schedules now and nothing

 is being done about it..  Ore-mining at Bakal would not have deteriorated to its preRent
 condition if the appropriate officials had remembered that "the interests of the State
 are above all else" (interesy goaudarstva prevyshe vsego).
 The key to production success, says RADYANSKA UKRAINA editorially on 28 May, is the
 proper utilization of machinery, that is, to its full capacity.  Discussing
 the progress of the South Ukrainian Canal construction, the paper says that
 the excellent machinery made available for that project is not performing as it
 should because the men behind the machines are not doing their part of the job.
 Cited as a typical example is the Zaporozhye Constructions Administration, one of
 the "leading" building organizations on the South Ukrainian Canal project:  "Half
 of its earth-mcving machines were idle in April, and graders and scrapers were
 poorly utilized."  Disparaging reference is made also to the organization leaders'
 method of checking the Socialist competition of its workers "on the air" instead of
 by personal supervision.  This, the editorial concludes, is "bureaucratic false-
 hood, not leadership.,."
 Inadequate utilization of machinery is also the subject of ZARYA's editorial
 discussion (28 May).  The reluctance to make full use of the available machinery,
 it is claimed, stems from the tendency to "underrate mechanization" on the part
 of many construction organizations:  there is even evidence of "negligence of
 machines and a scornful attitude toward them."  Insufficient utilization of
 machine capacity has-been noted among the oblast blast furnace workers, in ore-
 mining, metal trocessing and coke-chemical industries.
 KAZAKHSTANSKAYt. PRAVDA (6 June) complains that the qualitative indices of the
 Republic's industrial production still leave much to be desired.  Wasteful expendi-
 ture of fuel, electric power, and raw materials as well as "the most unsatisfactory
 use" of technical equipment are regarded as one of the chief contributing factors.
 Another and no less important reason for the unspecified industrial failings is
 said to be the "false objective" of obtaining favorable quantitative results at
 the expense of quality.  The net result of such management, particularly in the
 fishing industry, is that "production plans fail to be fulfilled."
 In a collectives letter to Stalin carried on the Home Service on 9 June, Estonian
 industrial management and labor familiarly pledge themselves to "still greater exertions
 for the benefit: of their Socialist Fatherland" but admit that "considerable short-
 comings" still hamper industrial'progreas~  "Some industrial units fail to fulfill
 the State plan...produce low-quality goods and permit waste."
 ThA"Dmad Soule01 gacj~etl  Racketeering in Soviet industry, in the Western sense, is
 never discussed on the radio sznce'that practice is usually associated with industria-
 lists and business men in capitalist countries.  References to shady machination,
 Soviet style, generally appear in feuilletona and other humorous press items.
 Ryabov tells the story of the head of the Mozhaisk Industrial Combine Tereahkin,
 now in Jail, whose love of'money got the better of his industrial talents and
 loyalty to the State.  Learning that a Gypsy caravan (tsyganskiy tabor) had camped
 near the town, Teresbkin decided  to change their nomadic ways of life by assigning
 part of the combine's production to them including the necessary "operating funds"
 which amounted to many thousands of rubles.  The Gypsies, however, decided to leave,
 after a short adventure into settled life, "having departed in an unknown direction"
 (otbyv v neizveaom napravlenii).  When the prosecuting authorities caught up with
 Tereshkin'a activities, it was revealed that the horse-drawn caravan of the
 untrustworthy gypsies, if there were any gypsies, could not be overtaken by the
 Combine's officials who pursued them in automobiles--if there was any pursuit.
 The close resemblance between Tereshkin's Gypsies and Gogol's "Dead Souls",
 Ryabov points out, is too bovious to be overlooked.  It was learned after further
 investigation that the "black bourse" (chernaya kassa) that operated within the
 Combine and was known to only a few "select" officials represented more tangible
 evidence than the Gypsy myth, and had something to do with the disappearance of
 State funds.  This black bourse, :..,cidentally, was the repository of funds acquired
 from the illegal production and sides of felt boots (valenki), and the distributor
 of the said funds among the officials making up Tereshkin's retinue.

 E n a":ic,n f r Children :   In a lengthy program for children broadcast from Stavropol
 on 6 June, Soviet youngsters are told that the ignorance in which American school
 children are kept is part ok a grand design for war on the part of the Truman
 Government.  It is the obvious aim of that Government, the children are told, "to
 bring up a generation of barbarians" whose reading ability will not extend beyond
 understanding bomber operation instructions, and their mathematics will be limited
 to making artillery calculations., An unnamed American teacher is quoted as
 having stated that "we must become familiar with the thought that a new world war
 is Inevitable."  In primary school text books, the letter "A" is said to appear
 opposite the word "atom", and "B" opposite the word "bomb."
 RLA33a,  the Home n   h   ~t .e:  The first "self-moving", four-seater carriage was
 built by an unnamed Russian serf "as early as 200 years ago", according to an
 anonymous talk heard on the Home Service on 7 June.  It is also asserted that the
 first two-stroke internal combustion engine was constructed by a Russian scientist
 in 1879.

 Amid persistent boasts of production gains, two anxieties are apparent:  the "temporary
 stagnation', of trade," and a shortage of capable personnel loyal to the regime.  In
 addition to State processing contracts, other methods' being employed to revive trade
 are exchange conferences and loans to speculators who will purchase native
 products.  Great success is claimed for the trade conferences'despite certain
 "unenlightened attitudes," such as a desire of tradeidelegatipn's to sell but not buy,
 and the determination of peasants to obtain satisfactory prices for their goods.
 As for the,so-called labor shortage, since armies of '!unemployed" are being given
 relief work, obviously it is a shortage of capability. I Perhaps one reason for the
 personnel problem is seen in the admission that "knowledge and experience" have
 been discarded as a basis for promotion.
 Both the tendency to rely on the Soviet and the weakness of this dependence are
 apparent in a report that Fukien Hrovince is now sending to Russia some of the
 goods formerly shipped to Hong Kpng, but must depend on the domestic market to
 absorb "most of it."  Direct Russian influence also is seen in connection with
 the Chinchiang flood control project.  To boost morale there, Mao Tse-tung
 sent a personal gift, presented by the Minister of Conservancy himself, accompanied
 by the "Soviet adviser to the Ministry."  A Russian adviser also appeared when
 dispatchers on the Chinese-Changchun Railway proved"conserva?4ive" and refused to
 adopt "new; ways," which of course were Soviet methods.
 In the Northeast, drought is feared, and in Kiangsi each land is idle, partly
 because farmers have been arrested, leaving their families with no labor and no
 money.  Szechwan grain levies were cut 20 percent because of   or crops, while
 some Szechwan farmers went on strike because their productio  quotas were impossibly
 high.   They knew they faced censure in any case.
 Teachers are singled out as needing thought reform, ae some possess the capitalistic
 attitude that allows them to "undergo thought reform! without reforming their thoughts."
 Also disappointing is the &lowness.of the workers to 'grasp the significance of
 the demarcation separating them from the capitalist class, for only after they
 absorb this ideal can the dictatorship of the proletariat lead the national
 construction.
