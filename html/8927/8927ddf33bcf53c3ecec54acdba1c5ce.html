CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
or 
HON. RICHARD D. McCARTHY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 24, 1966 
Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the 
New York Times, in its lead editorial 
Friday morning, makes several pertinent 
points regarding the decisions now fac-
ing the administration in light of the 
apparent lack of a response from Hanoi 
to our peace offensive. 
The Times emphasizes that "many 
factors counsel patience. The 2-month 
absence of North Vietnamese army units 
from combat in South Vietnam?which 
may signal a Hanoi desire to continue 
the diplomatic exchanges?is one such 
factor. Far more important is that fact 
that the military balance in South Viet-
nam has been fundamentally trans-
formed in the past year." 
The decisive new element, the Times 
points out, is the ninefold increase in 
American troops in South Vietnam. 
Meanwhile?. 
The newspaper observes?
it has become evident that the bombing of 
North Vietnam failed to achieve either of its 
original two objectives. It failed to slow 
down the infiltration of men and supplies, 
which increased as the bombing intensified. 
And it failed to bring Hanoi to the confer-
ence table. 
Warning against further escalation of 
the war, the Times warns: 
A further large-scale buildup would not 
end the military statement in South Viet-
nam. As in the past, it would be matched by 
increased Vietcong recruiting, infiltration, 
and additional North Vietnamese units and 
ultimately?if the ground war expanded into 
Laos, Cambodia, and, perhaps, North Viet-
nam?by the entrance of Chinese troops into 
the conflict. 
Apparently alluding to a letter from 
Gen. James M. Gavin, appearing in the 
latest Harper's magazine and to which 
I alluded in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of 
January 18, 1966, the Times concludes as 
follows: 
At the present, American forces are secure 
in their coastal positions and cannot be in-
voluntarily dislodged. General Gavin's re-
cent advice not to expand the war but to 
continue efforts to negotiate the peace, has 
the force of logic on its side. 
Under leave to extend my remarks, I 
include here the New York Times lead 
editorial of Friday, January 20: 
THE VIETNAM DECISION 
Failure of the Johnson peace offensive thus 
far to bring about formal negotiations with 
Hanoi inescapably raises the question: what 
course should the United States now follow? 
Much depends on Washington's evaluation 
of Hanoi's ambiguous public and private re-
plies and on the official estimate of how long 
it is safe to keep the bombers grounded. Is 
Hanoi holding out for concessions? Or is 
Hanoi seeking to avoid a conference out of 
the conviction that the United States will 
get tired and withdraw? President Johnson 
expressed the latter belief yesterday. But 
his conclusion from this remains unclear, 
since he also said: "The door of peace must 
be kept wide open." 
Many factors counsel patience. The 2-
month absence of North Vietnamese Army 
units from combat in South Vietnam?which 
may signal a Hanoi desire to continue the 
diplomatic exchanges?is one such factor. 
Far more important is the fact that the mili-
tary balance in South Vietnam has been fun-
damentally transformed in the past year. 
The decisive new element has been the 
ninefold buildup of American troops in 
South Vietnam to a strength of about 190,-
000. South Vietnamese armed forces, in-
cluding militia and police, now exceed 635,-
000. With South Korean, New Zealand, and 
Australian units, there are upward of 850,-
000 men in the field. And the backing of 
American air and naval strength gives these 
forces devasting firepower and unparalleled 
mobility. 
This buildup, in the words of President 
Johnson's state of the Union message, has 
put the enemy on notice that "time is no 
longer on his side" and that a Vietcong vic-
tory now is "out of reach." 
Meanwhile, it has become evident that the 
bombing of North Vietnam failed to achieve 
either of its original two objectives. It failed 
to slow down the infiltration of men and 
supplies, which increased as the bombing 
intensified. And it failed to bring Hanoi to 
the conference table. The bombing did force 
North Vietnam to turn from Peiping to Mos-
cow for antiaircraft missiles and, even more 
important, for massive economic and techni-
cal aid. But this unexpected dividend argues 
for a continued suspension of the bombing, 
rather than for its resumption. 
As White House Security Adviser McGeorge 
Bundy recently observed: "It has been made 
clear to us over a long period of time that 
the Soviet Government hopes there can be a 
peaceful settlement." And Moscow has also 
made it clear that peace efforts cannot be 
carried on while North Vietnam is being 
bombed. 
The critical decision that confronts Presi-
dent Johnson, therefore, is not whether to 
resume the early bombing of the north--
which even Republican leaders no longer 
press?but how to conduct the war in the 
south while continuing the probes for peace. 
The ground and air war in South Vietnam 
undoubtedly will resume fully after the lunar 
new year truce. What the President now 
must decide is whether to escalate that war 
in the south to a wholly new level by yielding 
to military requests for a doubling of Ameri-
can forces. Such a move would finally con-
vert the struggle from a Vietnamese conflict 
into an American war against Asians. 
A further large-scale buildup would not 
end the military stalemate in South Vietnam. 
As in the past, it would be matched by in-
creased Vietcong recruiting, infiltration of 
additional North Vietnamese units and ulti-
mately?if the ground war expanded into 
Laos, Cambodia, and, perhaps, North Viet-
nam?by the entrance of Chinese troops 
into the conflict. 
At present, American forces are secure in 
their coastal positions and cannot be in-
voluntarily dislodged. General Gavin's re-
cent advice, not to expand the war but to 
continue efforts to negotiate the peace, has 
the force of logic on its side. 
The Late Honorable John Taber 
SPEECH 
OF 
HON. 0. C. FISHER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 12, 1966 
Mr. FISHER. Mr. Speaker, the late 
John Taber was a most valuable Member 
A295 
of this body. He served with great dis-
tinction for nearly 40 years. As a mem-
ber of the Committee on Appropriations, 
once as chairman, he became known as 
the watchdog of the Treasury. In that 
capacity he was instrumental in saving 
American taxpayers untold billions of 
dollars. It is doubtful if any one Mem-
ber has ever done more in that respect. 
John Taber was indeed a great Ameri-
can. He was devoted to the cause of 
good government, of sensible restraint in 
the function of the Central Government, 
and of those fundamentals which make 
the competitive free enterprise succeed. 
During his long period of distinguished 
service Mr. Taber did more than his 
share in the preservation of our institu-
tions. We need more men of his dedi-
cation if our -Republic is to be preserved. 
An Intern's Views 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. TENO RONCALIO 
OF WYOMING 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 24, 1966 
Mr. RONCALIO. Mr. Speaker, Mem-
bers of Congress have had numerous oc-
casions to utilize the fine services of sum-
mer interns and are particularly grateful 
for the enthusiams and interest they 
bring to their responsibilities. 
Last summer I was pleased to have the 
services of Dan Spangler of Cody, Wyo., 
as a summer intern in my office. Dan, 
the son of Judge and Mrs. J. O. Spangler 
of Cody graduated in 1964 from the Uni-
versity of Wyoming with a degree in 
political science. He was attending 
Stanford University when he was selected 
as an intern for the Wyoming congres-
sional office. 
After a most satisfactory summer of 
employment Dan enrolled at the Uni-
versity of London under a Rotary Inter-
national scholarship. His exposure there 
to students from many countries has 
broadened his outlook on American for-
eign policy. At a time when the senti-
ments of some college students have 
created apprehension in the minds of 
many Americans, I am happy to note his 
thoughtful and responsible approach to 
this serious matter. I respectfully 
recommend his essay on Vietnam to the 
consideration of my colleagues as a 
worthy example of the mature outlook 
youth can offer when stimulated to take 
an active interest in the affairs of gov-
ernment. His essays follows: 
j- VIETNAM 
The greatest problem of our time is how to 
achieve world peace. A world war could 
destroy civilization as we know it. Nuclear 
weapons have enabled the two great powers, 
the United States and the Soviet Union, to 
achieve a state of mutual deterrence. The 
threat to peace does not come from any di-
rect conflict between these two states but 
from the possibility that they will become 
involved in what would begin as a limited 
war, then expand into a regional war until 
the interests of these two powers were di-
rectly involved, leaving no other alternative 
but a world conflagration. The existence of

CONGRESSIONAL 
large numbers of new, unstable states creates 
a number of opportunities for limited wars 
to expand into regional and world wars. In 
this situation, it is essential that the United 
States maintain flexible policies so that an 
escalated war will not be the only alternative. 
Before the present war widens any further, it 
is essential that the U.S. Congress conduct a 
public debate to explore fully the alterna-
tives to a wider war and to insure that U.S. 
policy in southeast Asia expresses the will of 
tile American people, 
historically, the area now know as North 
Vietnam has been the smallest but most 
densely populated sector of Indochina. 
North Vietnam was once controlled by China 
but in 939 Al). its people revolted and estab-
lished their own kingdom. Due to popula-
tion pressures and poor agricultural land, 
after 1069 the North Vietnamese advanced 
steadily into neighboring lands of the south 
and west, overrunning large portions of what 
is now South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. 
This expansion continued for 800 years until 
it was halted by the imposition of French 
colonialism. After the Japanese invaded the 
area during World War H, French authority 
was never reestablished in the north and the 
northern drive to the south and west began 
once more. The French attempted to arrest 
this drive until their defeat at Dienbienphu 
in 1954. The Geneva Agreement of that year, 
which was never signed by the United States, 
called for a united Vietnam within 1 year. 
The agreement was never carried out, mainly 
because it was unrealistic and dangerous. 
Till: DIFFERENT FACTIONS 
Lt is unrealistic to attempt to unify areas 
which offer as many contrasts as North and 
South Vietnam. Life in North Vietnam is 
still greatly influenced by Chinese ways due 
to China's former domination cif the north 
and to the close proximity of the north to 
China. Geographically, North Vietnam is 
more closely linked with China than with 
South Vietnam. The north has adopted 
China's subtropical agricultural methods 
while the tropical south has a different way 
of life. There has long been a rivalry be-
tween Hanoi. a former Chinese capital and 
a cultural and administrative center, on one 
hand, and Saigon, a French-created port, 
commercial, end agricultural marketing city 
on the other. Communications have never 
been good between the two areas. 
During World War 11, Hanoi took its orders 
from the Vichy regime while Saigon was the 
center for the Ganllists. In opposition to 
French colonial rule, nationalist leaders in 
the north identified with the Kuomintang in 
China while the Cao Gal and. Hoa Hoa fac-
tions led the nationalists in the south. With 
Lhese profound differences in the develop-
ment of North and South Vietnam, it is un-
realistic to suppose that they could form a 
viable state. 
THE AREA 
The unification of Vietnam under the ag-
gressive Communist regime of the north 
would be dangerous for the neighboring 
states; as well, which have riot forgotten the 
earlier period of Vietnamese invasion and 
domination. For, with the seizure of the. 
rich rice lands in South Vietnam, the well-
trained and equipped northern army would. 
easily have Laos and Cambodia at its mercy.. 
haos is the largest, least populated country in. 
tedochina, and it has the least capacity to 
rieread itself. The country is deeply divided. 
ethnically an politically. Cambodia is also 
sparsely populated and is in a vulnerable 
strategic position. 
Ships using the Cambodian capital, Phnom 
Penis, on the Mekong River, have to pass 
through South Vietnam. The Mekong Delta 
is open to attack from coastal and interior 
routes which can be commanded from North 
Vietnam and Laos. Thus, it is essential to 
Use security of Cambodia that South Viet-
nam and Laos are in friendly hands. To the 
RECORD ? APPENDIX January 24, _;966 
POVERTY TIIE REAL EVIL 
Any successful foreign policy must be de-
fined in terms of national interests and 
backed with adequate power. An American 
policy aimed at preserving the territorial 
integrity of Asian states while assisting in 
their economic and social development is In 
the American interest. The question that 
the American people and the U.S. Congress 
must now answer is whether or not that 
policy is backed by adequate power. 
There is no doubt that the United States 
? is able to apply enough military power to 
prevent an overt Communist takeover. But 
this tactic, by itself, will never bring stability 
to the region. American foreign policy in 
southeast Asia must receive more support 
from another form of power, which is the 
ability of the United States to encourage 
social and economic development. Stability 
can be achieved only if progress is made in 
this area, for poverty is a necessary pre-
requisite for the success of Communist 
revolutionary guerrilla warfare. 
Every successful Communist revolution, 
whether in Russia, China, Cuba, or Indo-
china, has been based upon impoverished 
masses. The Vietcong would have collapsed 
long ago without support from the people in 
the countryside. It is futile for the United 
States to remain in South Vietnam unless a 
massive effort is made to unite the South 
Vietnamese people behind their government. 
This task cannot wait until the war is over 
because the war will never end until social 
and economic changes are made. 
Besides intensifying our efforts in present 
developmental programs, we should give re-
newed thought to the development of the 
Mekong River,, which affects the livelihood 
of the entire Indochinese peninsula. The 
political fragmentation and strategic weak-
nesses of northeast Thailand, Cambodia, 
South Vietnam, and Laos are due partly to 
obstacles which make the Mekong difficult 
to navigate. By helping the southeast Asian 
nations to harness and develop this vital 
waterway, the United States could score a 
great victory in the battle for peaceful 
change by stimulating the imagination and 
loyalties of people in the most troubled parts 
of the region and by providing the oppor-
tunity for a better life to millions of Asians. 
CAUTION 
In clefendi:ng our national interests, we 
must proceed with restraint arid must view 
the scene from the vantage point of other 
nations, as well as our own. We must not 
allow ourselves to be placed in a position in 
which we no longer have any reasonable 
alternatives. As regard our policies in 
southeast Asia, the words of Bolingbroke are 
particularly relevant: 
"Victories, that bring honor to the arms, 
may bring shame to the councils, of a na-
tion. To win a battle, to take a town, is 
the glory of a general, and of an army. * * 
But the glory of a nation is to proportion the 
ends she pro :poses, to her interests and her 
strength; the means she employs, to the 
ends she proposes; and the vigor she exerts. 
to both." 
This is a time when momentous decisions 
must be made concerning future A mericon 
policies in southeast Asia. The decisions we 
make can be of vital importance to the fu-
ture of mankind. Therefore, in this vesslon 
of congressional debate, let all opinions he 
voiced, let all factors be considered, and let 
us coldly calculate the effects of our past, 
present, and future actions. A:nd finally, let 
us remember the judgment of our posterity 
with the words of Abraham Lincoln: 
"Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. 
We will be remembered in spite of ourselves. 
No personal significance or insignificance can 
spare one or another of us. The fiery trial 
through which we pass will light us down in 
honor or dishonor to the latest generation." 
west of Laos lies Thailand. The bulk of the 
Lao people live in Thailand, which has much 
reason to fear a Vietnamese-Laos combina-
tion. In addition, from 50,000 to 80,000 
pro-Communist refugees from Vietnam have 
settled in northeast Thailand since World 
War II. 
The instability and remoteness of north-
eastern Thailand make it imperative that the 
northeastern border is occupied by a stable 
Laos. These compounded problems of na-
tional security would be the consequences 
of a Vietnam united under a Communist re-
gime. The expansionist tendencies of a Com-
munist-controlled Vietnam would engulf the 
entire Indochinese Peninsula in large-scale 
warfare. As the war would expand, China 
would become more anxious to protect its 
borders and would play a larger part in the 
struggle. Eventually, the vital interests of 
such powers as India, Indonesia, and the So-
viet Union might become directly involved. 
The security of Australia and New Zealand, 
both close American allies, depends: upon a 
stable situation in southeast Asia, as World 
War II demonstrated. Britain is pledged to 
the defense of Malaysia and could become 
drawn into a wider struggle. If the even-
tually victorious powers in southeast Asia 
maintained close relations with china or fell 
under Chinese domination, the United States 
could :be subject to a grave threat. 
THE CIIINA ROLE 
It is difficult to tell if the Chinese always 
mean what they say but the Chinese leaders 
have pledged themselves to the destruction 
of the United States. In light of these pro-
nouncements, the United States most keep a 
close watch on China, which is now .1 nuclear 
power. In the coming years, it may be ex-
pected that China will achieve the capacity to 
deliver its nuclear weapons around the world. 
From our experience with the Soviet Union, 
it is clear that the best way to meet a nu-
clear threat is with another nuclear threat. 
But, if southern Asia were in the control of 
hostile powers, the United States would face 
great problems in mounting a credible deter-
rent to a Chinese nuclear force. Present-day 
missiles fired from the continental United 
States, can reach China only by crossing So-
viet territory. This only in creases the danger 
that the Soviet Union would aline with China 
in a war against the United States. Although 
relations are tense between Russia and China, 
the Soviet Union has given no indication that 
it would prefer a non-Communist Chinese 
regime. 
BALANCE OF POWER 
Thus, the U.S. presence in Vietna:m can 
be seen as an effort at limiting the scope 
of armed conflict in southern Asia, to insure 
that the great powers are not drawn into an 
open conflict in a wider war. Such a wider 
war would be certain to result if the United 
States did liot provide a balance to the forces 
of North Vietnam. A balance of power 
strategy is utilized. to guarantee that no one 
power has enough strength to subdue the 
other states. Without the balance provided 
by the United States, and with North Viet-
namese possession of the rich ricelands of 
South Vietnam, the balance in southeast Asia 
would be torn asunder. 
This would happen because the states of 
southeast Asia are so weak internally. But 
if the policies of the United States are suc-
cessful, these countries will someday be able 
to stand on their own feet. Before this 
happens, great changes must take place for 
the area is woefully underdeveloped and 
many of the people lack any sense ol national 
identity and loyalty. These changes may 
come about in one of two ways- violently 
or peacefully. The Communists advocate 
violent change while the United States has 
always realized that peaceful change, 
through foreign aid and technical assistance, 
is in its best interests.

Man Will Be Free 
EXTENSION OF REIVIAR 
OF 
HON. L. NIENDEL RIVERS 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 24, 1966 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the eyes of the world are fo-
cused on the Far East today. 
For it is there that the question most 
sharply asked is: "Will men be free or 
will men be slaves?" 
And the answer from courageous men 
is that man will? live as a free individual. 
Mr. Speaker, the Honorable WILLIAM 
JENNINGS BRYAN DORN?my distin= 
guished colleague from South Carolina 
and a great American?underscored 
those points in a stirring speech January 
23 at Taipei, Republic of China. 
His remarks are an inspiration to 
those who cherish freedom, a ray of 
hope to the nameless faces enslaved be-
hind the Iron Curtain. His message was 
clear and should give pause for thought 
to those misguided despots laboring un-
der the delusion that America is soft, or 
will fail her commitments in the Far 
East. 
His speech is of such import that I 
commend it for reading by the Members 
of the Congress. Under leave to extend 
my remarks in the Appendix of the 
RECORD, I hereby insert his message for 
the information of this body: 
MEN WILL BE FREE 
(Address by Congressman WILLIAM JENNINGS 
BRYAN DORN of South Carolina at the 12th 
annual Freedom Day Rally Taipei, the 
Republic of China, January 23) 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished guests, ladies 
and gentlemen. I bring you the greetings and 
the admiration of the Congress of the 
United States and the American people. As 
a member of the advisory board of the Na-
tional Captive Nations' Committee and on 
behalf of that committee I bring to you the 
best wishes of captive peoples all over the 
world. You, of the Republic of China, have 
won the enduring admiration of free peoples 
everywhere by your valiant and successful 
struggle to maintain the freedom of this 
island. You are the hope of freedom 
throughout the mainland. Your past is an 
inspiring saga of man's indomitable will to 
be free. Your present is a source of pride 
and hope to all who hate tyranny. Your 
future is nothing less than a promise to 
history. 
We gather here today to commemorate the 
courage of the 22,000 freedom fighters who 
defied tyranny and chose freedom instead. 
We gather here today to commemorate those 
throughout the world who have similarly 
struggled to escape terrorism and torture, 
those who continue the struggle for free-
dom. We commemorate and pay homage 
to the millions who have died to preserve 
freedom. 
It is fitting and proper that we observe 
Freedom Day. May we be encouraged and 
inspired to go forth from this spot as the 
spark of a great crusade to free the world of 
enslavement and oppression. The valor of 
these 22,000 Chinese and Korean prisoners 
will remain forever an inspiration to those 
who cherish freedom. 
The eyes of the world are today focused 
on the Far East. For, as Abraham Lincoln 
said with reference to my own country, the 
world cannot continue half slave and half 
free. And it is here, in the Far East that 
the question is today being most sharply 
asked?will men be free or be slaves? It is 
here that the answer is being most plainly 
given. Men will be free. 
It will not be easy?and there is no rea-
son to think that it will be quick?for free-
dom faces a massive challenge in Asia, a 
challenge led by those as determined as they 
are evil. There will be disappointments, 
frustrations, and setbacks in the future as 
there have been in the past. But men will 
be free. 
They will be free because the determina-
tion on the side of freedom is inexhaust-
ible?and you are the proof of that. They 
will be free because the resources of the side 
of freedom are more than sufficient and the 
will to use those resources is as firm as rock. 
Let no one be in any doubt about the 
commitment of the United States to the 
cause of freedom in Asia. The propaganda 
from Hanoi and Peiping expresses the con-
stant hope that the determination of the 
United States will weaken, that the effort of 
the United States will falter. They are en-
gaging in a dangerous delusion if they believe 
their own propaganda. They are making the 
fatal mistake of tyrants when they misin-
terpret a freeman's love of peace. Love of 
peace does not mean that we will meekly 
submit to tyranny. Love of peace does not 
mean that we will purchase it at the cost 
of freedom?ours or anyone else's. As Presi-
dent Johnson said earlier this month in his 
state of the Union message, "We do not in-
tend to abandon Asia to conquest." 
The Far East is the key area of the world 
geographically, economically, and politically. 
If totalitarianism should conquer the Far 
East, then all of Asia would fall. With Asia 
In Communist hands, Africa would be con-
quered. Western Europe would be out-
flanked and the forces of freedom would be 
in grave peril. 
In Asia there are vast untapped resources 
of manpower, rubber, tin, oil, and uranium. 
These resources, under the control of Com-
munist aggressors, would be used for con-
quest and war. These resources, under Com-
munist control, would not be used for peace 
or enlightment, for improved health and 
education. Under Communist control these 
vast resources would not be used for the 
advancement of freedom. They would be 
used for war and enslavement. 
May I remind you that the Communist 
aggressors consider the individual as mere 
grains of sand on the seashore to be used 
by the masters of tyranny for their own 
selfish aggrandizement. We believe man is 
created in the image of an all-powerful 
being. We believe that man has individual 
rights and aspirations, that he is entitled to 
dignity and individual liberty. This we be-
lieve. This we will defend. 
Lenin is reported as having said the road 
to Paris is the road through Peiping. The 
Communists are ruthlessly liquidating the 
opposition and are proceeding on that road 
to Paris by way of southeast Asia, the Near 
East and northern Africa. To halt this blue-
print for tyrannical power, conquest, and 
enslavement, the United States is spending 
Is blood and wealth in South Vietnam The 
United States manifested its devotion to the 
cause of freedom by expending the flower 
of its young manhood to defend that cause 
in Korea. 
Our Commander in Chief, President Lyn-
don B. Johnson, is very wisely supporting 
with strength the freedom fighters in South 
Vietnam. President Johnson will not pre-
side over the liquidation of freedom in Asia. 
He will instead preside over the restoration 
of freedom in Asia. He is a determined 
leader in the tradition of the Founding 
Fathers of? my country. By his courageous 
action, President Johnson has encouraged 
people throughout the world who are de-
voted and dedicated to the cause of freedom. 
We support you, here in the Republic of 
China, with our wealth and with our armed 
might. Your struggle for freedom is ours. 
We will not withdraw and leave you to fight 
this battle alone. We are here to stay until 
freedom is secure in Asia and the aggressor 
collapses in his own evil structure. 
In the history of the struggle for freedom 
you have produced one of the giant figures 
of our time. General Chiang Kai-shek was 
among the first to understand the diabolical 
tactics and sinister designs of the Commu-
nist world conspiracy. He began his heroic 
struggle to oppose communism on the main-
land in the 1920's, and he has been a world-
renowned champion in that struggle from 
that time to this. He and Madame Chiang 
long ago won the hearts of the American 
people and of freedom lovers everywhere. 
Madame Chiang is now in my country, and 
we welcome her both as a valiant ally and as 
a warm and honored friend. 
The Republic of China stands ready on 
the flank of Communist aggression. The 
Republic of China is blocking the road of 
Communist expansion to the islands of the 
Pacific. The Republic of China and the 
magnificent forces of the Republic of South 
Korea are a deterring force to the announced 
Communist plans to conquer India, south-
east Asia, and move into the Middle and 
Near East. I salute you for this magnifi-
cent contribution to world freedom. 
I salute you also for the assistance you 
are giving to the free world effort in Viet-
nam. You are one of the almost 40 nations 
which are helping the gallant people of that 
beleaguered land build a better life at the 
same time that they defend themselves 
against a cruel aggression. Your country is 
giving assistance in the field of agriculture. 
You have built power stations. You have 
sent medical teams. You have trained more 
than 400 Vietnamese technicians. You have 
given warehouses, agricultural equipment, 
seeds and fertilizers, veterinary equipment 
and cattle, boats, airplanes, and over half a 
million textbooks. And you have been gen-
erous in extending to our forces fighting in 
Vietnam both material facilities and hos-
pitality. You are playing your full role as 
part of the fraternity of freemen opposing 
aggression in Vietnam. 
The United States is fighting in South 
Vietnam as a member of that fraternity of 
freemen. We are fighting there against 
stark Communist aggression by terrorism, in-
filtration, sabotage, deception, and murder?
the most diabolical and dangerous form of 
aggression. We are fighting in South Viet-
nam to preserve the right of self-determina-
tion of nationalities. We are fighting for 
peace, as opposed to the spread of war. We 
are fighting to help all of you in a righteous 
cause. We are fighting to prevent a world 
war. We are fighting to prevent a world 
holocaust of unparalleled carnage and de-
struction. 
We are daily growing stronger, on land, on 
sea, in the air, and in space. This strength 
is for freedom. This military might is dedi-
cated to your independence, to your liberty. 
It will never be used for aggression, slavery, 
and conquest. The United States has no 
territorial designs anywhere in the world. 
We are for liberty and individual dignity and 
freedom for peoples everywhere. We believe 
in lending a helping hand to the diseased and 
the underprivileged throughout the world. 
We are standing beside all of you in this 
struggle for freedom to preserve your ancient 
heritage, your art, your culture?which pre-
cedes ours?to preserve your civilization, 
which began thousands of years before ours. 
We share your hopes and your aspirations for

he future. En this age of science and astro-
nautics, there is no room for Communist 
suspicion, hatred, bigotry, and deceit. I look 
to the future with hope and with confidence. 
I believe we are on the dawn of a new era. 
The magnificent progress made on this 
island shows what free societies can accom-
plish. The growth in your production of 
both agricultural and industrial goods can 
only be described as startling. Your exports 
are rising, your economy is strong, your cur-
rency is sound. Most important of all, the 
benefits of this prosperity are going to the 
people. I am proud that my country has 
assisted you in your efforts. And I know that 
you are proud that through your own efforts 
you have done so well that in your country 
we have been able to end our foreign aid 
pr gram. 
'the iron curtain in Europe and Asia is a 
manifestation of an inferiority complex. The 
Iron curtain is necessary to hide tyranny and 
promote totalitarianism. The Iron Curtain 
is designed to keep people from knowing the 
truth?to prevent them from knowing the 
joys of freedom and self-determination of 
peoples, individual liberty, dignity, and ecu-
menic opportunity. 
can assure you that the United States 
will stand firm throughout the world. We 
fought in Korea. We are fighting in Vietnam. 
We are with :you here. We were with you in 
Korea, in Quemoy, and in Matsu. We are 
supporting SEATO in southeast Asia and 
NATO in Europe. We will oppose Commu-
nist aggression wherever it rears its ugly 
head. 
The time 11..s come to launch an offensive?
an offensive of truth about freedom, the truth 
about stark Communist aggression and its 
sinister designs. We most offer hope for the 
captive peoples of the world to throw off the 
yoke of tyranny and again live in the sun-
light of freedom. We must spread the truth, 
throughout the world, about Communist im-
perialism and colonialism. We must tell the 
truth about class hatred and race prejudice 
of Communist imperialists?the truth about 
their liquidations, murder, and deceit. 
We must not reward Red Chinese aggres-
sion by giving Red China a seat in the Unit-
ed Nations. We must not dignify Red China 
by giving her a forum and a vote on the cause 
of freedom. We must not bolster her eco-
nomic system with the trade of free nations 
and peoples dedicated to the cause of human 
dignity. It would be a grave mistake to bol-
ster her sagging economy with the products 
of free enterprise nations. We must not make 
this same mistake again. The free nations 
of the world promoted trade with the dicta-
tors of World War II. It was their acquisi-
tion of products from free enterprise nations 
that largely enabled them to launch a war 
against private enterprise, property rights, 
dignity, and freedom of the individual. We 
cannot make this mistake again. Red China 
has the atomic bomb. She is perfecting the 
hydrogen bomb. Trade with the free world 
will enable her to have the hydrogen bomb, 
with which to launch an onslaught against 
civilization, in mass production at an early 
date. We must push our freedom offensive 
now. 
Captive nations and peoples hold the key 
to the future security, independence., and 
freedom of the world. Remain steadfast in 
your struggle for freedom. Captive nations 
are the "Achilles heel" of Red imperialist ag-
gression. Communism, fears your yearning, 
your desire for freedom. Communism fears 
your courage and your-ability to someday rise 
and turn back the tide of tyranny. 
You have our hearts. You have our sym-
pathy, our support, and our understanding. 
We share your hopes. We share your aspira-
tions. Most of all, we share your sure and 
certain vision of the future: Men will be free. 
RECORD ? APPENDIX January 24, 1itiqq6 
Misuse of Foreign Aid 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
E[ON. THOMAS M. PELLY 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 1966 
Mr. PELLY. Mr. Speaker, a constitu-
ent of mine, Mr. Jack Bird, who is a 
member of the Alaska Fishemen's Union, 
has posed some serious questions and 
charges pertaining to our foreign aid pro-
gram in the Republic of Chile. 
Following one of the major earth-
quakes in Chile, the U.S. forein aid 
program was stepped up to aid in the 
recovery from this major disaster. How-
ever, it seems that this aid and subse-
quent aid, according to Mr. Bird's 
memorandum, has not been allowed to 
filter down to those who were in rTeatest 
need. Charges of graft and corruption 
have often been voiced in this area and 
there is no valid reason why we should 
not establish rules for administering 
foreign aid. 
Mr. Speaker, the American public can-
not be placated forever with pious an-
swers and doubletalk which has no 
substa:nce of meaning. 
I have asked that the following memo-
randum from Mr. Bird be investigated 
by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Also, I am sending a copy of this memo-
randum to the officials of the CARE 
program so that they, too, may have the 
opportunity to look into the matter of 
CARE packages being sold, th is not 
reaching the poor. 
Mr. Speaker, with the thought that 
my colleagues and other readers of the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD might be inter-
ested in Mr. Bird's observations I include 
herewith the text of his memorandum: 
I would like you to take this miter up 
with interested parties,, regarding aid do-
nated by the American people. 
In 1960, I was living in Coronel, south of 
Concepcion, Chile, in a very poor section. 
The industry is mostly coal mining and the 
wages were very low. While I wes there 
we had the largest earthquake in Chilean 
history. Here in America the queen made 
headlines in all the newspapers and there 
were vast sums of money and mate/eels do-
nated for that area, which was the center of 
the cmake. I resided in that are,: for 3 
months after the quake. And I didn't see 
any sign of materials or aid that were sup-
posed to be donated for relief of the sictims. 
When I left Chile, people were still ramping 
in front of their ruined houses. Hui sired of 
thousands of people never knew of any aid. 
Where does this aid go? 
Four years later I was again lieing in 
Chile. This time in the north, in the small 
city of Iquique where I resided for 18 
months. At various times, I hate seen 
CARE packages on display in the store for 
sale. I purchased 8 kilos of flour for 31/2 es-
cudos, nearly $1. In the 18 months that I 
lived in Iquique, I never met anyone who 
had ever received a CARE package and there 
are hundreds of thousands of poor people 
there. They didn't even know such a thing 
existed. 
If we don't supervise the aid after it en-
ters these countries, we are wasting our time 
and mciney. 
I think this is a job for our highly rated 
Peace Corps in those areas. It would at 
least give them something useful to do. I 
have worked in many areas where the Peace 
Corps people are stationed and only about 
25 percent are qualified to contribute any-
thing to these areas, such as doctors, nurses, 
teachers and skilled technic-ans?the rest 
are just there for 2 years. 
Example. I have seen pictures in maga-
zines showing Peace Corps workers digging 
ditches in Latin America, when those people 
have known how to do that for 500 years. 
Also, two Peace Corps workers came to 
Iquique, age about 20, to teach fishing. 
When they got on a fishing vessel, they were 
lost; they had to learn from the Chilean crew 
members, much to the amusement of the 
Chileans. 
There are more Communists in Chile than 
I have seen anywhere else where I have 
worked. Most of the crew members that I 
instructed in fishing were Communiet. 
Allende, the Communist Party leader, gained 
in most depressed areas of Chile. And if we 
don't get to these poorer classes of people 
in the next 4 years, the Communist Party 
has a good chance of getting in. 
Therefore we must make sure we get credit 
for every dollar in aid we send there. 
I think that is where the Peace Corps 
would come in useful, to see that anything 
we send to these countries gets to where it 
is supposed to go. 
A national drive for good used clothing 
would be very welcome to these poor people. 
Nearly all American families have closets 
full of clothing they will never use again 
because they are tired of them. This ma-
terial could be distributed by the workers 
of the Peace Corps, to be sure it gets to the 
right people. 
My information is that aid donated by the 
American people is delivered to the principal 
port in each country, and then trusted to 
some local agency which may or may not be 
honest. 
As an American taxpayer, I want to see 
us get full value for each dollar spent.

The Weaver Appointment 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. LESTER L. WOLFF 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 24, 1966 
Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Speaker, more than 
two-thirds of all Americans are city and 
suburban dwellers. 
In a real sense, the job of the Federal 
Government is now concerned with the 
care of the people in these areas. 
The job facing the newly appointed 
head of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Affairs, the very able Robert C. 
Weaver, is a tremendously important 
one. His new Department must become 
the clearinghouse for urban and subur-
ban problems. 
A recent editorial in the New York 
Times calls this appointment "the begin-
ning of another road along which vast 
flew strides must be taken toward better 
living conditions." 
I respectfully requested that the Times 
editorial on Dr. Weaver's appointment 
be included in the RECORD, and commend 
it to the reading of the membership of 
this body: 
[From the New York (N.Y.) Times, Jan. 15, 
1966] 
THE WEAVER APPOINTMENT 
President Johnson's appointment of Robert 
C. Weaver as Secretary of the new Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Renewal has 
been long expected. 
A Harvard-trained economist, Dr. Weaver 
hay Government experience dating from the 
early days of the Roosevelt administration. 
He is dedicated and knows the field to which 
he has been assigned; he was deputy State 
housing commissioner and later New York 
State Rent Administrator under Governor 
Harriman. President Kennedy subsequently 
named him to the top housing post in the 
country. He has attained Cabinet level?
first Negro in American history to do so?
despite some criticism of his abilities and his 
imagination. 
If the appointment of Robert Weaver to his 
new post is the end of the road in the sense 
that the struggle to put a Negro in the 
Cabinet is won, so is it the beginning of 
another road along which vast new strides 
must be taken toward better living condi-
tions. "In some of our urban areas we must 
help rebuild entire sections and neighbor-
hoods containing as many as a hundred 
thousand people," the President said in his 
state of the Union message. "Working to-
gether, private enterprise and government 
must press forward with the task of providing 
homes and shops, parks and hospitals, and 
all the other necessary parts of a flourishing 
community where our people can come to 
live the good life." It is Robert Weaver's task 
to direct and coordinate such an ambitious 
effort, and we wish him the best of luck in 
this monumental job. 
Eccles Speaks Out cn Vietna 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. GEORGE E. BROWN, JR. 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 1966 
Mr. BROWN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, in view of the continuing efforts 
by the President to seek a negotiated 
peace in South Vietnam, for which I am 
most grateful, and the pressure which he 
is undoubtedly being subjected to from 
many persons advocating total victory, I 
think we would all do well to note the 
recent words by Financier Marriner S. 
Eccles. I would like to request unani-
mous consent to have printed at this 
point in the RECORD an article which 
appeared recently in the Los Angeles 
Times, January 4, 1966, wherein Mr. 
Eccles joins in urging that we not esca-
late the war in Vietnam: 
FINANCIER ASSERTS UNITED STATES SHOULD 
NOT ESCALATE WAR 
SAN FRANcisco.?"Under no circumstances 
should we escalate the war in Vietnam. Our 
position there is indefensible," says financier 
Marriner S. Eccles. 
Eccles declares, "Contrary to Government 
propaganda, we were not invited by and have 
no commitment to any representative or re-
sponsible Government of South Vietnam. 
"We are there as an aggressor in violation 
of our treaty obligation under the U.N. 
Charter." 
Eccles' remarks appeared in the "Letters to 
the Editor" column of the Monday morning 
edition of the San Francisco Chronicle. 
Now 75, Eccles was assistant to the U.S. 
Secretary of the Treasury in 1934 and has 
held several positions on the Federal Reserve 
Board. 
U.S. ACTION CITED 
Eccles said that after the Vietnamese vic-
tory over the French and the signing of the 
Geneva Treaty in 1954, the U.S. refused to 
allow free elections in Vietnam, "knowing 
that Ho Chi Minh, the Communist leader of 
the north, was so popular he would unques-
tionably win." 
"The South Vietnamese Catholics, about 
10 percent of the population, property owners, 
and business Interests in the large cities, are 
the strong anti-Communist supporters of 
A299 
South Vietnam, and are the minority," he 
continued. 
"We have provided large amounts of mili-
tary and economic aid and supplied them 
with military advisers," Eccles said. "But 
until the present administration came into 
office, we did not furnish American troops 
to help fight their war, until it was ap-
parent they were being defeated. 
"We have gradually taken over the direc-
tion to their Government as well as their 
war until now it has become an American war 
rather than a Vietnamese war." 
? As a result, Eccles said, "we now have alined 
against us the powerful countries of China 
and Russia, including all the Communist 
world, with practically no support from the 
rest of the world in spite of Rusk's and Mc-

World Is a Small One for Harriman 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. F. BRADFORD MORSE 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 24, 1966 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. Speaker, world 
leaders have continued to be amazed at 
the vitality and effectiveness of one of 
our most able Ambassadors, Gov. W. 
Averell Harriman. Governor Harriman's 
familiarity with the principal world fig-
ures for more than a generation has as-
sured his missions a friendly and respect-
ful welcome wherever he goes. 
Yesterday, Chalmers Roberts of the 
Washington Post reported on an inter-
view with the Governor following his 
most recent peace mission regarding the 
situation in Vietnam. I ask unanimous 
consent to include Mr. Roberts' article in 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD: 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Jan. 23, 
1966] 
WORLD IS A SMALL ONE FOR HARRISON 
(BY Chalmers M. Roberts, Washington Post 
staff writer) 
In the dark of last Wednesday evening 
W(illiam) Averell Harriman, who will be 75 
next November 15, ran down the ramp from 
his presidential jet at Andrews Air Force Base 
in nearby Maryland. It was the end of yet 
another talking trip. 
Harriman has been talking straight talk 
to presidents, prime ministers, dictators, and 
other assorted political potentates since Harry 
Hopkins introduced him to the Roosevelt in-
ner circle in early New Deal days. 
For 22 days he zigzagged around the world 
as one of President Johnson's peace offensive 
envoys. Mr. Johnson put a lot of people into 
diplomatic orbit but somehow the memory 
fades of all but the extraordinary durable 
Harriman. 
For Harriman the only word is extraordi-
nary. On this 35,000-mile trip he touched 
down in 12 world capitals?he was in Bang-
kok 3 times?and none of them was new to 
him. Not only had he been to them all 
before but he had met every one of the 
leaders before with the single exception of 
Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser. 
GREETED BY MENZIES 
That wealth of experience clearly paid 
dividends, Australia's Robert Menzies, who 
came out to the airport in the late evening 
to greet him, was an old friend from World

War II days in London when the Aussie sat 
with the British War Cabinet. 
Or take Yugoslavia's President Tito. 
"I saw him in Brdo"?where they met 
again this time?"back in 1951 when Yugo-
slavia, after the break with Russia, feared 
Stalin would turn the satellites loose on 
him. We gave him planes and tanks." 
Harriman paused and added: "When 
you've seen a man in his tough times, there's 
a certain relationship." 
In Warsaw-, Communist Party Boss Wladis-
law Gomulka saw Harriman "for old time's 
sake." He once had been a house guest in 
Harriman's New York residence, years after 
they first met during the war. 
"The Shah of Iran," says Harriman, "con-
siders me one of his oldest friends. He 
stayed at my cottage in Sun Valley." Har-
riman, whose father created the Union Pa-
cific Railroad, was of course the man who 
created that ski resort. 
Harriman has a newspaperman's instincts 
about travel and he hasn't missed many cor-
ners of the world. 
"If you haven't been to a country," as he 
puts it, "no matter how much information 
you have, you can't get a feel of it." 
In fact Harriman feels so strongly about 
the right of Americans to travel that he once 
hired Dean Acheson to fight a potential case 
for him right up to the Supreme Court. 
Back in the Eisenhower years, when he had 
finished a term as Governor of New York (he 
was involuntarily retired by the voters in 
favor of Nelson Rockefeller) Harriman de-
cided he wanted to go to Communist China, 
E 1959 TRIP CALLED OFF 
At that time the State Department forbade 
such trips. But the test case never came off 
because at the last minute he received a mes-
sage from Peiping saying it would not be con-
venient to receive him that year, 1959. 
Of course, Harriman has been to China. 
He stopped off in Chungking, the wartime 
capital, to see Chiang Kai-shek en route home 
from IVIoscow in 1946. Everybody told him 
he ought to go on to Peiping but he had a 
date with Gen. Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo, 
and so he missed his only chance to get the 
feel of today's center of the Asian Commu-
nist world. 
"I was very serious in those days," he says 
with a sense of regret that he didn't put off 
the visit with the general another day or two 
to take in Peiping. 
'rhe Governor?everybody calls him that 
and he loves it despite the fact that his 
political skills turned out to be in an al-
most totally inverse ratio to his diplomatic 
abilities?had only 8 hours' warning of his 
latest trip. President Johnson called him 
at noon and he was airborne from Andrews 
at 8 p.m. 
But the Governor was not unprepared this 
time even though he thought it was to be 
a trip of only a few days. 
"I've been caught several times before,'' 
lie explains, "on being sent to the tropics. So 
usually take some tropical shirts along. I 
only wear one weight of wool suit anyway.'' 
Although the presidential jet, with its huge 
"United States of America" legend embla-
zoned on each side, has a pair of bunks, the 
6-f oot-l-inch Harriman spent only 3 or 4 
nights aboard in bed. At each stop, too, em-
bassy wives reached for the soiled shirts and. 
returned them in time for the Governor and, 
his two globe-girdling aids, Asian Commu-
nist expert David Dean, and Christopher 
Squire, who is in charge of Hungarian af-
fairs at State. 
Harriman took no secretary. He penciled 
his dispatches on a yellow pad and got them 
oil at the next stop. Dean and Squire al-
ternated as note takers at the talks with 
the foreign leaders and then wrote up the 
detailed reports. 
Harriman has his own philosophy about 
diplomatic messages. 
"I write them short to the President and There was no surfboarding this time. But 
and the Secretary of State. More people he mused to a companion: "In my day, it 
read the short ones. But I make them very was much more dangerous; they didn't have 
much to the point. They have got to be that stabilizing fin on the back of the board 
reasonably entertaining. I learned that then." 
from the British. They pass around the 
Cabinet table the telegrams they get from 
their ambassadors. They never have a leak, 
either; I wish we could do as well. 
"The Ambassador in Britain who writes 
the best has his career made. They have 
literary style. Sometimes exact reporting is 
not as important as being descriptive." 
Harriman, of course, won't discuss the 
substance of his peace mission other than 
to say that "I got the impression that all 
the people I saw were anxious to see the 
fightin.g stop, although for differing rea-
sons." 
"The crocodile" method is to come to the 
point and wrap it up quickly. He had 45 
minutes at the Peshawar airport with Paki-
stan's President Ayub Khan who, naturally, 
he has known since 1959. 
IN WARSAW AT 3:30 A.M. 
When he arrived in Warsaw, nonstop from 
Andrews, it was 3:30 in the morning by his 
wristwatch. But 45 minutes al ter the 
touchdown he was closeted with Poland's 
Foreign Minister Adam Rapacki. 
"You can do an awful lot in an hour," 
he says. 
Harriman, of course, was acutely oriscious 
of the critical role the Sino-Soviet dispute 
plays in the war in Vietnam. Like other 
administration leaders, he feels that Mos-
cow wants to see the war ended, that Peiping 
wants to see it continue and that Hanoi is 
trapped in between the two Communist 
giants. 
It was Harriman, after the German sur-
render and before Japan fell, who inspired 
James Forrestal to write in his 1945 diary: 
"He said the outward thrust of communism 
was not dead and that we might well have to 
face an ideological warfare just as vigorous 
and dangerous as fascism or nazism." And 
that at a time when most Americans were 
putting their postwar hopes on a continua-
tion of the wartime alliance with the Soviet 
Union. 
Stalin himself confirmed Harrini an's dire 
views that October when he told him that 
"we've decided to go our own way." 
It was President Kennedy who first deeply 
involved Harriman in the Far East, ,-specially 
in the China problem. Today he takes very 
seriously the hard words from Peiping such 
as Lin Piao's pronouncement that the under-
developed nations of the "countryside" will 
surround and defeat the "cities" of North 
America and Western Europe. 
He wants Americans to fully appreciate the 
danger from China. But he does not worry 
that in turning their eyes to the .Par East 
they Will be bemused into thinking that 
Washington and Moscow are about to be-
come allies. He figures the Russians will 
make it evident it can't come to that. 
Averell Harriman did not bring peace to 
Vietnam but he clearly enjoys the satisfac-
tion of yet another job well clone. The trip 
was tiring; a cold turned into an ear infec-
tion because of too-rapid descent and change 
in the cabin air pressure corning into Darwin, 
Australia. 
Winging home across the Pacific, he played 
bridge with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, 
Senator JOHN SHERMAN COOPER, Dean, 
Squires, and Rush's aid, C. Arthur (Buck) 
Borg. Rusk, who had joined up in New Delhi 
and and who lives on his earnings, picked 
up a bit of change from Harriman who in 
1952 was reputed to be worth $40 million. 
When they got to Honolulu and tile luxury 
of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, Harriman 
ducked into a sports shop, bought a $6.95 
pair of wildly yellow swimming trunks and 
headed into the sea at Waikiki. 
George Paul Miller: The Conscience 
From California 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOSEPH E. KARTH 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 24, 1966 
Mr. KARTH. Mr. Speaker. It has 
been my rare privilege during the last 7 
years to know and to work with Congress-
man GEORGE P. MILLER, On the House 
Committee on Science and Astronautics. 
Under his leadership the committee 
has considered the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration authorization 
bills which have brought the country's 
space programs from very preliminary 
stages to full operation. Much credit for 
this successful achievement is due to 
Chairman MILLER'S knowledge and pa-
tience and parliamentary skill. 
The magazine Challenge published by 
the General Electric Missiles and Space 
division recently printed an article about 
Congressman MILLER. So that our col-
leagues can have the opportunity to read 
this excellent portrayal, I include it in the 
Appendix of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD: 
GEORGE PAUL MILLER: THE CONSCIENCE FROM 
CALIFORNIA 
(One of the first things a boy learns on 
getting a drum is that he's never going to get 
another one. One of the first things a nation 
learns about getting a GEORGE MILLER is that 
we need more like him. The capable chair-
man of the House Committee on Science and 
Astronautics relies on experience and com-
monsense in encouraging the Nation's space 
efforts. Here he speaks out on competition?
among people, in industry, and with Russia.) 
In a highly technical world like space, 
saturated with semantics like thermody-
namics, gravity gradient, and accelerometers, 
if you were going to handpick a man in Gov-
ernment to head up the House of Represent-
atives Committee on Science and Astronau-
tics, you wouldn't pick the manager of a 
travel agency that failed, or a man who was 
on relief in depression days, or an ex official 
of a State fish and game commission. 
You wouldn't, that is, sinless the combina-
tion of all three turned out to be GEORGE 
Ptah, MILLER, Congressman from California's 
8th District, now in his 11th term in Wash-
ington, just shy of his 75th birthday, rind 
still building momentum in a life he waited 
so long to begin. 
And you might pick him for this job of 
spearheading the annual authorization of 
America's $5 billion space program not be-
cause of his technical background ( though 
he's an engineer and has learned the lan-
guage); not because he's a tactful politician 
(though associates say he can settle disputes 
better than most), and not because of his 
experience (though he's served five Presi-
dents). 
You pick GEORGE MILLER because he's a 
trustworthy guardian of the public invest-
ment; because he asks questions until he 
gets answers we can all understand, and be-
cause he's dedicated to the idea that Amer-
ica will not ride on the back of the space

has been on relief. ' 
Edward Taylor of 810 North Illinois made 
it through the .eighth grade. He was in civil 
service work at Oak Ridge, Tenn.., then was 
- transferred to Fort Harrison "until the sol-
diers took over" in 1949. Since then he has 
been unable to find steady employment. 
Most of the other men I talked with have 
similarly steady, modest backgrounds: They 
are grateful to have the curbstone job mart 
as a door to temporary employment. They 
prefer that it not be called the "slave mar-
ket." Their pay runs from '75 cents to $1.25 
or 0.50 an hour as a rule, depending upon 
the type of work they get. 
Most of these good men are victims of the 
new technology. They are among 3 million 
employable but unemployed Americans. To 
most of these beyond the twenties or thirties, 
retraining and other war on poverty devices 
offer scant prospects. 
What they need is what Fred Gibson said 
is part of being a man?steady jobs. And 
they need them now. This strongly suggests 
a need for Federal action to create those 
jobs. It was Abraham Lincoln, not Karl 
Marx, who said the Government "should do 
for the people what the people cannot do 
themselves or as well themselves." 
Affirmation: 
SPEEC 
OF 
HON. CHARLES L. WELTNER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 13, 1966 
Mr. WELTNER. Mr. Speaker, the 
university and college students of Geor-
gia have initiated and organized Affirma-
tion: Vietnam, a project which has my 
approval and unqualified support. My 
colleagues here in the House have ex-
pressed their pride in these young people, 
and I join with them in applauding this 
expression of constructive patriotism. 
The original impetus came from a 
group of students at Emory University 
In Atlanta, and now includes representa-
tion and support from most colleges and 
universities throughout the State. Its 
sponsors include Senators RICHARD B. 
RUSSELL and HERMAN TALMADGE and other 
notable Georgians and Atlantans, as 
well as the entire Georgia delegation to 
the House of Representatives. Remar 
M. Sutton, Jr., is providing excellent co-
ordination of the movement in his capac-
ity as general chairman. 
The culmination of Affirmation: Viet-
nam will be a rally at Atlanta Stadium 
on February 12. It is a very special 
honor that Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk, a native Georgian and product of 
Georgia schools, will make the major 
address. 
Students have traditionally and his-
torically occupied a unique place in our 
society. Their enthusiasm and intelli-
gence-have been joined to many causes, 
and they have not hesitated to debate 
the issues with clear candor, and without 
regard to personal gain. 
In recent months, the students voice 
has often protested our commitment in 
southeast Asia. Therefore, this sponta-
neous movement by Georgia students is 
deeply gratifying and reassuring. 
I am proud to be connected with this 
project, and I hope that the demonstra-
tion of support for the reasoned princi-
ples of our country's commitment will be 
noted by the rest of our Nation. 
Johnson and Party Repairing Image 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 24, 1966 
Mr. YOUNGER. Mr. Speaker, re-
cently, under leave to insert my own re-
marks and include extraneous matter, 
I had inserted in the RECORD an article 
by Walter Pincus relative to the Demo-
cratic National Committee finances. 
Another of his articles on the same sub-
ject appeared in the Sunday Star of 
January 23. In order to complete the 
story, the article follows: 
MONEY AND POLITICS--JOHNSON AND PARTY 
REPAIRING IMAGE 
(By Walter Pincus) 
Stung by recent criticism, President 
Johnson and his top political aids are 
moving to improve the Democratic Party's 
darkened fundraising image. 
At the same time, however, financial de-
mands of this year's congressional election 
activities may resurrect the bad image just 
as fast as the Democrats try to knock it 
down. 
As a first step in image building, negotia-
tions are underway to transfer some $600,-
000 raised by the newest $15,000 a page Dem-
ocratic ad book to a bipartisan foundation 
which?with matching funds from the Re-
publican National Committee?would openly 
conduct voter registration drives prior to 
next fall's election. 
The ad book, which drew funds from 68 
corporations, was promoted by the Demo-
crats last summer behind a veil of secrecy. 
As originally conceived, the proceeds were 
to go to Democratic candidates who dis-
tribute the books at fundraising movie 
premieres. 
DIRECT MAIL PLAN 
As a second image-building step, the Dem-
ocrats soon will begin a modest direct mail 
solicitation for small contributions. In re-
cent years, the Democrats have received al-
most 80 percent of their funds from donors 
of over $100?most of them $1,000 givers. 
An effort last year to stimulate small con-
tributions through a contest was a dismal 
failure. So few people entered that win-
ners at the State level have not even been 
announced. 
President Johnson, himself, started off the 
new fundraising approach with his cam-
paign fund reform proposals in the state of 
the Union message. Among the sugges-
tions?still to be transmitted in detail to 
Congress?was a tax relief proposal for poli-
tical contributions. This is aimed at stimu-
lating small donations. 
In contrast to the Democrats, the Republi-
can Party has since 1962 reported raising a 
sizable proportion of its funds from donors 
of $100 or less. 
As politically attractive as the imagemak-
ing proposals are, they actually will cost more 
money than they will raise. 
With the need to raise some $1 million 
this year to support the national Democratic 
program, party leaders hope their top fund-
raiser?the President?will be able to carry 
Januaty 24, 1966 
out appearances at five or six dinners around 
the country. 
The President's recent gall bladder opera-
tion cost the national committee some $1 
million. Almost $400,000 of that figure would 
have been collected at a California func-
tion Johnson had planned to attend. When 
he was unable to go, the California promo-
ters refused to hold the affair and held onto 
some $300,000 already collected. That event 
apparently has been rescheduled for April. 
TWO WASHINGTON EVENTS 
Several fundraising appearances of Vice 
President HUBERT H. HUMPHREY, which bring 
in additional funds to Washington, were 
canceled when the President asked him to 
stay in Washington during his postoperative 
period. 
This year, along with out-of-town Presi-
dential appearances, the Democrats are plan-
ning on two affairs in Washington to bring 
in money. 
The financial attraction of the Nation's 
Capital as a campaign fund source is irre-
sistible. The entire take of an affair, rather 
than just half the proceeds, go to the Demo-
cratic National Committee. In addition, the 
city is bulging with people who understand 
politics and respond to requests for contri-
butions. 
Lobbyists, trade association representatives, 
and Government employees to make the city 
the best place to hold either a dinner?as 
has been suggested for this spring?or an 
entertainment gala?as is being talked of 
for midsummer. 
However, fundraising in Washington has 
its drawbacks?the prime one being the up-
roar over organized Democratic solicitation 
of Federal employees. Such protests have 
developed over the past 5 years. 
All the attempts at imagemaking could 
be destroyed if the party resumes its intri-
cate, organized, and illegal solicitation of 
Federal employees by their more politically 
oriented coworkers. 
INQUIRY IS CLOSED 
Last year, the Civil Service Commission 
and the Justice Department were forced to 
review the activities of officials in the Rural 
Electrification Administration after allega-
tions were made and partially confirmed that 
tickets to the 1964 Johnson gala were being 
sold on office time to subordinates. 
Justice recently announced it had closed 
the inquiry without finding sufficient evi-
dence to warrant prosecution. 
Such organized in-house soliciting also 
was planned for last year's Democratic con-
gressional dinner. Though it was stopped 
in some departments after being revealed in 
the press, other agencies carried it on suc-
cessfully. 
Another aspect of Democratic 1966 fund-
raising will be promotion of the $1,000 a 
membership President's Club, which since 
1961 has supplied a heavy proportion of the 
party's funds. Though it creates the "fat 
cat" image, the President's Club funds will 
be needed to provide the major part of this 
year's campaignmoney. 
Tomorrow, HUMPHREY and other top ad-
ministration and party leaders will attend 
the New York City President's Club kickoff 
meeting. Over 500 have been invited to at-
tend the closed briefing?and subsequently 
contribute $1,000 to the party. 
Similar events are being set up around 
the country, and probably will precede both 
the Washington and out-of-town fundrais-
ing appearances of Johnson. 
SECOND AD BOOK DOUBTFUL 
The bad publicity generated by this year's 
ad book limits chances that another book 
will be attempted this year. However, if the 
need for funds deMand it, the Democrats 
may put together a volume to accompany 
the gala. 
Over 100,000 of this year's book?a valen-

One of Our Commissioners Is Missing 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. CRAIG HOSMER 
CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 1966 
Mr. HOSMER. Mr. Speaker, the fol-
lowing communication has been sent by 
me to the House Republican conference, 
but I believe it may prove of interest to 
all our colleagues: 
Moans ENERGY COMMISSION VACANCY?
FAILURE To FILL 
For almost 7 months?since July 1, 1965?
a vacancy has existed on the U.S. Atomic 
Energy Commission. This vitally important 
body with an annual budget exceeding $2 
billion is functioning at 80 percent of its 
statutory manpower level. The management 
of its vast complex of scientific and indus-
trial activities rides heavy on the shoulders 
of four rather than a proper complement of 
five supervising Commissioners. The input 
of thought, judgment, experience and wis-
dom into Commission decisions affecting 
both U.S. nuclear defense and American 
progress in peaceful uses of the atom con-
tinues month after month to remain starved 
by a factor of 20 percent. 
Yet the Johnson administration remains 
totally unconcerned. Washington hears not 
the slightest rumor whatever of any possi-
bility of a new Commissioner to replace Dr. 
Mary I. Bunting, who returned to the campus 
of Radcliffe College last June 30. 
This regrettable state of affairs follows on 
the heels of an equally regrettable body blow 
to the Commission's farce level dealt by the 
same Johnson administration in 1964. This 
involved the appointment of Dr. Bunting 
herself in that year with the understanding 
and agreement of the White House that she 
would remain away from her teaching re-
aponsibilities only for a year. During her 
year in Washington, Dr. Bunting proved to 
be a brilliant, hard working, and able Com-
missioner. Expectedly, however, most of 
her year was devoted to learning the job. 
She left, therefore, at the very moment of 
emergence into a capability to assume her 
full share of the Commission's workload. 
The administration knew, or should have 
known, at the time it appointed her that 
ouch would be the case. There were other 
candidates for the 1964 vacancy who were 
willing and able to serve the full term, which 
Dr. Bunting was not. Nevertheless, she was 
selected, because at that moment the admin-
istration was going through one of its peri-
odic "appoint women to office" weeks. 
All of this is a record of bad government 
administration. The people should know it. 
They are entitled to something better. The 
Commission vacancy should be filled 
promptly by a person of high competence 
who will agree to serve the term. 
Roy Wilkins on Hogwash 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ANDREW JACOBS, JR. 
OF INDIANA 
IN TIM HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 24, 1966 
Mr. JACOBS. Mr. Speaker, a great 
deal of nonsense is being spoken and 
written today by individuals in an effort 
to ridicule this Nation's efforts to cope 
with the causes and effects of poverty. 
Two columnists writing in the current 
issue of the Indianapolis Observer pro-
vide a most welcome change from what 
appears to be an increasingly active and 
deliberately misleading campaign. 
Neither Roy Wilkins nor John Ackel-
raire, the Observer's columnists, will al-
low to go unchallenged the bumper 
stickers which smugly proclaim, "I'm 
fighting poverty. I work for a living." 
These two writers display honesty and 
realism in discussing the difficult cir-
cumstances in which the unwilling vic-
tims of the "new technology" find them-
selves. For that reason, I take this op-
portunity to insert their comments in 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD; 
[Prom the Indianapolis (Ind.) Observer] 
Roy WILKINS ON HOGWASH 
It is easy for most white people to think 
of Negro life as one long physical hardship. 
They remember lynchings and the victims of 
beatings and shootings. They know about 
bombings and burned-out homes and 
churches. 
Where Negroes are free of all this, or most 
of it, the public cries out, along with the 
young California guardsman in Watts: "What 
do they want? They never had it so good. 
These are not slums like Harlem." 
There are other cruelties besides lynching 
and the Negro is not insensitive to them. 
One is the popular myth that the race 
doesn't want to work, that it prefers wel-
fare payments. 
Today the not-so-subtle insult is repeated 
by rightwing critics and speakers and parrots 
belonging to this or that society, but call-
ing themselves generally, "conservatives." 
The latest dig is to be found on automobile 
bumper stickers: 
"I'm fighting poverty. I work for a living." 
The implication is as plain as it is smug. 
It says there is work aplenty for those who 
want to work. It says that those who do 
not work are deliberately choosing the as-
sistance of antipoverty and welfare programs. 
It says, further, with an air of self-righteous-
ness, "We who work are paying the bills for 
those who choose to enjoy poverty." 
Every student of the most elementary eco-
nomics of a capitalistic society knows this 
to be hogwash. and pretty smelly even for 
that concoction. 
Statistics don't mean so much to people 
who think and live by slogans, but the fact 
is that 3 million Americans are hunting for 
work and cannot get a job. In the midst of 
our affluence we simply have not solved the 
problem of what to do about workers dis-
lodged by technology, not by laziness. 
One element of the formula for unemploy-
ment is a dark skin. It is true nationally 
that the unemployment rate for Negroes is 
A279 
twice that for whites, but in some locali-
ties it is as much as four times the white 
rate. In the Watts district of Los Angeles 
last August 1 out of every 3 Negroes was un-
employed. 
In Michigan computers are bringing thou-
sands of different cars off the assembly line 
equipped by orders on punchcards. In 
Ohio a machine drills 250 cylinder blocks at 
once. In Louisiana a computer fills drums 
with chemicals. In Chicago a computer 
mixes and bakes cakes. On a single Dixie 
plantation a cottonpicking machine displaces 
50 Negro families. 
These changes and wholesale regional and 
family disruptions and the myriad personal 
tragedies that flow from them will not be 
remedied by the auto-bumper philosophers. 
They are too busy working?until they reach 
the brutal cutoff age of 45, that is.

are versatile, able-bodied men about as des-

be. They arrive, poorly clad against the pre-

walk in orderly array until picked up or hope

Fred Gibson has lived in Indianapolis more 
than 40 years. He never got beyond the 
fifth grade, although his felicitous manner 
of speech and wide range of self-gathered 
knowledge suggest considerably more formal 
education. In his time he has had some 
fair jobs?landscape gardening, construction 
work, hod carrying and fry cooking. The 
only really well-paying job he ever had, 
though, was a brief stint in a World War II 
war plant. He never has owned a house or

But neither has he ever been on public 
welfare nor has he ever gone to a township 
trustee for relief. He has no police record. 
"I have always tried to be a man," he said 
the other day, "and part of that is holding 
a steady job." 
In recent times a steady job has eluded 
Fred Gibson. So he goes down to the curb-
stone each morning in hope of a day's pick-
and-shovel or tile-laying work. If he is 
lucky, he may make as much as $25 or $30 
a week. His rent takes $16 of that. ("I

A278 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX January 24, 1966 
Into one sovereign and independent republic 
of the Ukrainian people. 
Although the Ukrainian Republic was 
recognized by a number of States, including 
the Government of Soviet Russia, it had no 
durable peace nor prosperty because Com-
munist Russia invaded the Ukrainian state 
despite its previous pledges to respect and 
honor the Ukrainian independence. 
For nearly 31/2 years, without assistane 
from the Western World, the Ukrainian peo 
pie waged a heroic war against Communist 
Russia in the defense of sovereignty of their 
country but the gallant struggle came to a 
tragic end. The free Ukrainian state was 
subdued to a puppet regime of the Soviet 
Socialistic Republic. 
Since the Russian Communist enslave-
ment with brutal oppression and domination 
there has been much suffering among these 
people. But despite the Communist yoke im-
posed by 1VLOscow, the Ukrainian people never 
accepted the foreign domination and are con-
tinuirig to struggle for freedom and national 
independence. Through a series of heroic 
and bloody uprisings and a steady resistance 
through underground warfare, the Ukrainian 
people have demonstrated their undying love 
of freedom and their opposition to alien slav-
ery and oppression. 
Both the Congress and the President of the 
United States have recognized the legitimate 
right to freedom and national independence 
by enacting and signing respectively the 
"Captive Nations Week Resoltuion" in July 
1959, which enumerated the Ukraine as one 
of the captive nations enslaved and domi-
nated by Communist Russia, and is entitled 
to recognition and moral support by the 
American people and the free world at large. 
During the debate on colonialism in the U.N. 
Assembly in 1960 and 1961 a number of West-
ern statesmen, including our Ambassador to 
the U.N. raised their voices in protest against 
the persecution of the Ukrainian people by 
the Communists. 
The cause of Ukrainian freedom and inde-
pendence is no longer a patriotic desire since 
the Communist menace has spread into Asia, 
our shores in Cuba and Latin America, it has 
become a political necessity for the free world 
to recognize that an independent Ukraine 
would substantially weaken the Communist 
empire. 
Americans of Ukrainian descent in our 
great State of North Dakota are planning 
to celebrate the forthcoming 48th anniver-
sary of the Ukrainian independence on Sun-
day, January 23, 1966, in a solemn and fitting 
manner with special religious services and 
programs which will be heard on radio and 
TV over stations in Bismarck, Mandan, Mi-
not, and Dickinson. 
We firmly believe that you are fully aware 
of the importance of Ukraine as an ally in 
the struggle against Russian Communist 
imperialism. We, therefore, respectfully re-
quest that you make an appropriate state-
ment on the floor of the Senate on or about 
the 22d of January in commemoration of the 
48th anniversary of the Ukrainian independ-
ence. This anniversary provides an appro-
priate occasion not only for the U.S. Senate 
and American people but also for the U.S. 
Government to demonstrate their sympathy 
and understanding of the aspirations of the 
Ukrainian people. 
It may also provide better understanding 
by extending diplomatic relations to Ukraine, 
which is a charter member of the United 
Nations, by nominating an American of 
Ukrainian descent to serve on some diplo-
matic post, and by the issuance of a com-
memorative stamp in honor of Europe's free-
dom fighter and Ukrainian poet, Texas 
Sheychenko. 
We extend our sincere thanks and appre-
ciation for the favorable response in the 
past on this and other. matters, and we hope 
that you will continue to accept our expres-
sions with meaningful understanding. 
Sincerely yours, 
DT. ANTHONY ZTJKOWSKY, 
President, UCCA, State Branch of 
North Dakota. 
Quick, Easy Solution to Vietnam 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WILLIAM S. MOORHEAD 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 13, 1966 
Mr. MOORHEAD. Mr. Speaker, after 
a visit to Vietnam last month I con-
cluded that the most important con-
tribution the average American can 
make to the war in Vietnam is patience. 
There is no quick and easy solution. 
The nationally syndicated writer, 
Ralph McGill, in a recent column, com-
pared the fighting conditions in Vietnam 
to an episode in our own history. He 
noted that Marion the Swamp Fox, using 
guerrilla tactics, "kept a large force of 
well-equipped British troops engaged 
across a long period of time." Four 
major expeditions by the British against 
him were unsuccessful. 
Indeed it is frustrating to hold the 
power to devastate completely an entire 
enemy country and not be able to use 
that power. 
Mr. McGill's column, published in the 
January 13 issue of the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, is an excellent answer to the 
question: "Why not win in Vietnam?" 
Under leave to extend my remarks I 
Include it at this point in the RECORD: 
NEITHER POWER NOE VICTORY ARE 
ENOUGH FOR VIETNAM 
(By Ralph McGill) 
ATLANTA.?"Why not victory now?" "Why 
not win in Vietnam?" "Why don't we get it 
over with?" 
"What's wrong with winning?" "Why 
can't this great power kick out that rabble 
of guerrillas in Vietnam?" 
These and other idiocies, born of frustra-
tion, 'echo in the land of the free and the 
home of the brave. (It is a land that ought 
to understand, out of its own history, the 
frustration in Vietnam. Our own history 
includes Marion, the Swamp Fox. He based 
himself in a swamp and kept a large force 
of well-equipped British troops engaged 
across a long period of time. On four oc-
casions, major expeditions were mounted 
against him. He eluded them. Marion was 
one of the factors that enabled final victory 
to be won. The more effective units of our 
continental army were, in effect, guerrilla 
troops, operating out of their knowledge of 
terrain and of living off the country.) 
The United States would win. Winning 
would, in a sense, be easy. Congressman 
CHARLES WELTNER, speaking in his Georgia 
district, said to the impatient and frustrated: 
"Certainly, it would be a simple matter to 
bring about, within 24 hours, the utter devas-
tation of all of North Vietnam. We could 
kill every able-bodied fighting man there?
along with every little child, every woman, 
every old man?all within the twinkling of 
an eye. We can win?if winning means 
wiping out 16 million human beings; and 
if winning includes the very real chance of 
direct military engagement with Commu-
nist China; end if winning includes the prob-
able necessity for using nuclear weapons 
against Peiping; and if winning includes 
the possible destruction of Russia?after, 
of course, Russia has simultaneously de-
stroyed 100 million American lives. 
"We have the power to win?if we want 
to win under these circumstances. That 
power has gone unexercised, to the mount-
ing frustration of us all, and to the in-
creasing demand that we do something. We 
sincerely seek an honorable peace and, I am 
convinced, are willing to go the extra mile. 
We will not, however, negotiate a peace that 
would mean the inevitable loss of southeast 
Asia to the thralldom of China." 
The world should have learned out of its 
many wars and "victories" that great power 
is not enough?not nearly enough. Nor is 
"victory" enough. Two tremendous wars en-
veloped most of the earth. They were "won" 
with a vast mobilization of power, men, ma-
terials, and food. A Korean war was waged, 
bloodily and indecisively. 
It was said of this harsh conflict that it 
was waged to contain Communist aggres-
sion. That was true. But it was not all 
the truth. We were then, as now, confronted 
with two Communist giants. Since that 
time, the second one, China, has detonated 
two nuclear devices. More are on the way. 
Russia, believing that communism eventu-
ally will triumph, seems willing, in the face 
of power, to build her own economy and 
avoid aggression. China, with a growing 
birthrate and an increasingly serious lack of 
food and viability in her economy, believes 
in and seeks aggression. Yet, in the last 2 
months her attempts to infiltrate and sub-
vert African governments have failed. A 
plot to make Indonesia a Peiping puppet was 
thwarted. 
Peiping-trained Thailanders now are in 
open opposition in north Thailand. The 
story goes on and on. 
Neither power alone, nor victory alone, is 
enough. What this country seeks to do is 
to mobilize all our power?our wealth of 
goods, money and arms?to seek the slow 
way, a new sort of "victory."

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN SHERMAN COOPER 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Monday, January 24, 1966 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the Appendix of the RECORD an article-
from the New York Times of January 10, 
1966, noting the election of Philip P. Ard-
ery of Louisville, Ky., as chairman of the 
board of directors of the American Heart 
Association. 
Mr. Ardery distinguished himself in 
World War II, leading an air squadron on 
D-day and since has been equally distin-
guished as a member of the bar and as 
a devoted worker in the field of civic af-
fairs. 
I am sure that he will continue to pro-
vide effective leadership to the American 
Heart Association as chairman of the 
board of directors. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

January 24, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ?APPENDIX 
ican system which our deliberations disclose 
as necessary. It seems to me that the task 
might be entrusted after this Conference to 
one or more bodies which would carry for-
ward our work in preparation for a special 
conference, under article III of the charter, 
to meet possibly within the next 6 months. 
At this stage I should like to advance for 
consideration some of the ideas that the 
United States believes could contribute to 
making our organization a more effective 
instrument. 
First, the United States favors annual OAS 
meetings at ministerial level. The interac-
tion and speed of developments in our 
hemisphere and elsewhere make it highly 
desirable that we meet with more regularity 
and frequency than we have before. The 
consultations should not be confined to our 
hemispheric problems alone. Developments 
in other areas might be reviewed both for 
their implications for us, as well as for what 
we might do to further the cause of peace 
and freedom elsewhere. 
Second, we should strengthen the organ-
izational relationship among the key organs 
of the system: the Ministers, the Council, the 
Economic and Social Council, CIAP, and the 
Secretariat. Our objective should be to in-
tegrate the various facets of our collective 
effort; to insure they are responsive to the 
agreed policies of governments; to insure 
that cooperation in the political, economic, 
social and cultural fields are mutually rein-
forcing and to insure that new operational 
tasks are carried forward with administrative 
efficiency and dispatch. 
Third, in our forward planning we should 
think not only of measures to deal with a 
conflagration onee it has broken out, but also 
of preventive steps the Organization might 
helpfully take in a dispute or situation in 
this hemisphere before it has reached the 
crisis stage. There is wisdom in the old dip-. 
lomatic tradition?incorporated in United 
Nations clactrine--that bilateral disputes are 
best settled bilaterally. Nevertheless, the 
Council might be empowered to consider a 
dispute or situation at the request of one 
or more American Republics: to recommend 
procedures for peaceful settlement; and per-
haps to recommend provisional measures de-
signed to prevent an aggravation of the sit-
uation. The Council, in carrying out such 
function:3, could avail itself of aiasytance 
from the Inter-American Peace Coinntittee, 
from special commissions, and from the Sec-
retary General. 
Fourth, the United States would also sup-
port strengthening the institution and role 
of the Secretary General, authorizing him to 
bring to the attention of the Council any 
matter which, in his opinion, may endanger 
peace and security in the hemisphere. 
Fifth, there is the question of joint ac-
tion. Both in the Cuban missile crisis and 
In the Dominican situation, the discharge 
by the OAS of its responsibilities involved not 
merely the assumption of political responsi-
bility but also the employment of units of 
the armed forces of various member states. 
These were contributed voluntarily and op-
erated collectively under a combined com-
mand. In the crises of 1962, this action was 
decisive. In the case of the Dominican Re-
public, the Inter-American Peace Force made 
a vital contribution to the avoidance of need-
iess bloodshed and the creation, of conditions 
for the Dominican people to determine their 
own future by votes and not by arms. Its 
importance is attested by the fact that the 
Provisional government has called upon it 
for continued assistance in the maintenance 
of peace and stability. 
The United Nations has, of course, had 
much more experience than has the OAS 
in this type of multilateral peacekeeping 
force. Many of your countries have made 
personnel available for both United Nations 
observation and military operations in sev-
eral crisis situations. 
111,11,,111 
It may, therefore, be useful for us to ex-
amine, in the light of experience and the 
nature of our collective responsibilities for 
paece and security in the hemisphere, and 
elsewhere, the desirability of establishing 
these voluntary contributions to interna-
tional peacekeeping operations on a more 
orderly basis in advance of their possible 
future use by the OAS or by the U.N. 
If we face the fact that we live in troubled 
times, if we face the fact that there are 
those who seek with purpose and persistence 
to destroy democracy. I believe, if we are 
patient, we shall find a creative way so rec-
ognize two important principles: first, we 
ought to be prepared to move fast and ef-
fectively and, if possible, together when a 
dangerous situation arises in the hemisphere; 
second, none of our governments is prepared 
to engage its military forces except by a na-
tional decision, at the highest level, in the 
light of particular circumstances. 
Sixth, I would note the need to avoid 
within our hemisphere competitive arms 
races. Our resources are desperately heeded 
for economic and social development. With 
all its imperfections we are blessed by the 
most mature and reliable system for re-
gional security and peacekeeping on the face 
of the planet. As military budgets are form-
ulated we should keep these facts before us?
and the examples, past and present, if the 
burdens and consequences of all arms races. 
The experience of the Cuban missile crises 
gave to the Western Hemisphere a heightened 
awareness of the need to control modern 
weapons and to prevent the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. One of the initiatives that 
received added impetus in 1962 was the pro-
posal to create a nuclear-free zone in l.atin 
America. The United States has followed 
with keen and sympathetic interesi the 
efforts of Latin American countries to work 
oat agreed arrangements for excludins the 
proliferation, the stationing, or storage of 
nuclear weapons within the territory of Latin 
Arnerican States. We have noted the en-
couraging progress toward this end which_ was 
made during the current year at discus ions 
in Mexico City. The United States believes 
the project of a nuclear-free zone in Latin 
America is constructive statesmanship iii the 
but tradition of the hemisphere. We wel-
come the effort and would be glad to see it 
reach a successf ul conclusion. 
should also note that our membership 
mi y expand. 
The emergence of two new, independent, 
states?Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago?
caused our organization to devise a formula 
for the admission of members. We found 
the formula without need to alter the char-
ter. The door is now open to additional 
countries to join the OAS. We will wet nine 
them wholeheartedly at such time as they 
with to avail themselves of this opportuaity. 
VII 
This, as we see it, is the panorama of our 
common tasks. 
The intent of my country to work with you 
in the common quest for freedom and pros-
perity has never been as strong as it is to-
day?to build together and together to pro-
tect what we are building. President Jehn-
son has summed it up this way: 
-Our charter charges each American con-
try to seek to strengthen representative 
democracy. Without that democracy and 
without the freedom it nourishes, material 
progress is an aimless enterprise, destroying 
the dignity of the spirit that it is really 
meant to liberate. So we will continuo to 
join with you and encourage democracy until 
we build a hemisphere of free nations Ileom 
Tierra del Fuego to the Arctic Circle." 
Thus vie would reaffirm the faith of my 
Government in the effectiveness and vita liLy 
of our regional system. It has served to 
bring new levels of understanding and good 
will between our peoples. It has served to 
promote freedom and democracy, It has 
A277 
served, and is increasingly serving, as a means 
for achieving material well-being and social 
justice for our nations. It has served to keep 
the peace in this hemisphere and to protect 
us from our enemies. 
The Organization has demonstrated its 
flexibility and adaptability to change in the 
past. I am confident that it will continue to 
do so in the future. 
The challenge in this old hemispheric sys-
tem is like the challenge of domestic political 
life: to transform and modernize policies and 
institutions in harmony with abiding prin-
ciples and values, so that the problems of 
today and tomorrow can be met. 
Together I am confident we shall meet 
that challenge. 
The 48th Anniversary of the Proclamation 
of Independence of the Ukraine 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. MILTON R. YOUNG 
OF NORTH DAKOTA 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Monday, January 24, 1966 
Mr. YOUNG of North Dakota. Mr. 
President, January 22 marked the 48th 
'anniversary of the proclamation of in-
dependence of the Ukraine. On this oc-
casion, Americans of Ukrainian descent 
all across the land took part in special 
observances to once again bring to the 
attention of the world how a free, inde-
pendent nation was forced under the 
yoke of communism. 
In a recent letter to me, Dr. Anthony 
Zukowsky, president of the North Da-
kota branch of the Ukrainian Congress 
Committee of America, Inc., discusses the 
special programs planned for North Da-
kota. These included special religious 
services which were broadcast over ra-
dio and television throughout a broad 
area of North Dakota. 
In his letter, Dr. Zukowsky made an 
excellent case for setting forth the ne-
cessity of maintaining our commitment 
to the people of the Ukraine and other 
nations who live under Communist 
tyranny. We cannot forget these people 
and their desire to obtain freedom. We 
must continue to support them and help 
them to advance in every possible way 
the independence they seek. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have Dr. Zukowsky's letter printed 
in the Appendix of the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the letter was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows:

DEAR SENATOR YOUNG: We want to again call 
to your attention that in the month of Jan-
uary Ukrainians all over the world includ-
ing our State, will mark the 48th anniversary 
of the proclamation of the independence of 
Ukraine, which took place on the 220 of

956 - CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE January 24, 1966 
dr we can choose, as wise commanders do, 
to fight on a front where we can win, to fight 
the war against want. It is the most impor-
tant war the race of man ever faced, a war 
we can win, and a war from which our 
Nation can come off stronger and' richer?
richer in moral, spiritual, and material ways. 
We have a disproportionate share of the 
world's arable land resources. They are not 
enough to meet the whole world's food de-
ficits, but we also have unrivaled agricul-
tural production and handling know-how 
which can increase productivity around the 
world. And we have a system of democratic 
government with freedom and enterprise 
which, copied throughout the world, can help 
to increase affluence everywhere. 
We can fight the war against want with 
corn instead of cannon, with farmers instead 
of marines, with tractors instead of tanks, 
with nitrogen used in fertilizer instead of 
explosives, with technology instead of battle 
plans, with food instead of fear, and with 
development instead of destruction. 
All men can be winners in such a war?
just as we are real winners today in the war 
against domestic want which was started 
in the thirties to end the paradox of want 
and surpluses here at home. As we ended 
the depression in the thirties, and as we have 
created jobs and eliminated poverty in post-
World War II days, we have enjoyed growing 
prosperity, and growing affluence. 
A world war against want would be an ex-
tension, beyond our national boundaries, of 
a policy adopted by our first President and 
Congress that has brought us to our present 
greatness, strength, and prosperity. 
George Washington, Albert Gallatin, and 
our earliest national leaders wOrked for Fed-
eral programs to bring about development of 
new areas. We have continued programs to 
stimulate the expansion of productivity 
across our land down to the present time. 
As geographical frontiers have disappeared, 
we have gone back to redevelop and upgrade 
the economic activity of some our own less 
developed areas and to expand vertically. 
The Tennessee Valley, the Columbia Basin 
development, the great western reclamation 
projects, and now Appalachia and the 
planned regional commissions in New Eng-
land, the Ozarks, the upper Great Lakes, and 
my own upper Great Plains area are exam-
ples of that policy. 
These area developments have paid divi-
dends to the Nation as well as the immediate 
territory involved. 
Tennessee Valley counties bear twice the 
share of the Federal tax burden today that 
they carried in 1935. They pay twice as 
much income tax. That means they im-
port and export twice as much or more from 
the rest of the Nation. Their contribution 
to the total economic strength of the Nation 
has doubled. The Columbia Basin has be-
come an economic bastion of the Nation as 
a whole. 
The flowback of benefits from economic 
development abroad is just as clear economi-
cally as the fiowback from our own regional 
developments, and it has returns in terms of 
world peace and human freedom not involved 
in our own regional development projects. 
We gave Japan food assistance after World 
War II. Japan is today our largest foreign 
market for agricultural commodities. She 
buys from us each year more than we 
granted her over several years. 
The Department of Agriculture has made a 
study of our exports to 54 developing nations 
which we have given food-for-peace aid. 
For every 10 percent rise in per capita -in-
income their purchases of agricultural com-
modities from the United States have in-
creased 21 percent. 
An in-depth study by the Department of 
Agriculture, "Foreign Economic Growth and 
Market Potentials for U.S. Agricultural Prod-
ucts." concludes: 
"The results of this study clearly indi-
cate a definite and positive relationship be-
tween growth in income and trade. They 
also indicate that expansion in the demand 
for U.S. agricultural and other products will 
continue to be closely tied to world economic 
conditions. Rapid economic development 
will help maintain a steady growth in U.S. 
agricultural and total trade; * * market 
outlets for an increasing part of American 
agricultural products will become more and 
more dependent upon the rate of economic 
progress in other countries. And, since the 
greatest market potential for U.S. agricul-
tural products is in the developing coun-
tries, it would be in our own economic in-
terest to help promote economic growth in 
these less-developed countries." 
The techniques for using food assistance 
to stimulate development in the emerging 
nations of the world are well known to the 
agencies that administer our food-for-peace 
programs. 
The voluntary agencies like CARE, Cath-
olic Family Welfare, and the others use 
grant food for wages on community and 
rural development projects?and it is rural 
development that is most needed to meet 
the challenge of the food and population 
crisis. 
The soft currencies which recipient na-
tions pay for food-for-peace supplies under 
title I of Public Law 480 are loaned back 
from many types of development projects; 
a considerable amount is earmarked for 
American private business firms to borrow 
to start business in the issuing countries. 
A war against want will require a decade 
or more to win. 
There are bottlenecks of dock facilities, 
storage facilities, transportation, and of 
knowledge on how to use our foods, which 
must be broken. India does not have con-
ventional port facilities adequate to unload 
the food she needs right now from the ships 
that bring it to her shores. 
We cannot pour food into a less developed 
country in quantities or on terms which will 
destroy the incentive for their own farmers 
to increase their production, as they must 
if the race with growing population is to 
be won. We must help those countries with 
our know-how and supplies to achieve maxi-
mum self-sufficiency. There are many other 
problems, including increasing the support 
of other developed lands. 
But if our great Nation has the skill to 
put a man on the moon, it has the skills 
necessary to solve the distribution and devel-
opment problems connected with a major 
world food effort. 
President Lyndon Johnson, in his state of 
the Union message, has called for a maxi-
mum effort to meet food, education, and 
health problems in a worldwide attack. He 
did not call for a limited effort. 
I had the pleasure of reporting in the 
U.S. Senate last Friday that support given 
my proposed international food and nutri-
tion bill reflected unprecedented unanimity 
among American citizens. 
All of the four major farm organizations 
favor moving our international food effort 
from surplus disposal to production to meet 
the needs of men. Labor organizations and 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are in sup-
port. Church groups, professional groups, 
the college and university community, and 
scores upon scores of newspapers and mag-
azines?leaders of the fourth estate?have 
expressed support. The endorsements are 
bipartisan, and by far the most extensive 
spontaneous outpouring I have ever known 
behind any proposal. 
We have yet one gamut to run. 
Space technologists and the electronics in-
dustry think they are the inventors of a 
new technique of miniaturization. 
We have had experts at that technique in 
Government for a good many years. They 
sometimes serve a useful purpose, but not 
always. The war against want, the race 
between food and population, cannot be won 
with any miniaturized, pilot projects. It 
cannot be fought on weekends and holidays. 
It cannot be won with left-overs. 
This war, from which our Nation and 
mankind can benefit eternally, can only be 
fought and won if we recognize it as the 
most important war in the history of man-
kind and if, in President Johnson's words, 
we make a "maximum, worldwide effort." 
The war against want cannot ultimately 
be avoided. 
What we do about it this year?in 1966?
may very well determine whether 15 or 20 or 
25 years from now the less developed world 
has become a world of self-sustaining, cash 
customers of both our agricultural and in-
dustrial industries, of if it is a cauldron of 
unrest and danger to the peace of the world, 
which can be brought into a balanced rela-
tionship between food and population only 
by the expenditure of greatly increased 
amounts for assistance and grants as a re-
sult of population growth and lagging 
develop nt. 
ADDRESS DELIVERED BY THE 
PRIME MINISTER OF SOUTH 
VIETNAM AT THE ARMED FORCES 
CONGRESS IN SAIGON 
Mr. COOPER. Madam President, on 
January 15, I was in Saigon. On that 
day, the Prime Minister of South Viet-
nam, Air Vice Marshal Nguyen Cao Ky, 
spoke at the closing ceremony of the 
Armed Forces Congress, made up of ap-
proximately 1,500 officers, who serve in 
every area of South Vietnam. 
In perhaps its most important fea-
ture, Prime Minister Ky declared that 
the Republic of Vietnam should set forth 
on the road to constitutional democ-
racy. In his speech, he outlined pro-
cedures for the drafting of a constitu-
tion providing for democratic institu-
tions, and plans to have the constitution 
voted on by the people at the end of 
1966, with elections for office to be held 
a year later. 
A second feature of the address is the 
stress on the pacification and rebuild-
ing of the civilization. It indicates the 
importance which Prime Minister Ky 
attaches to bringing about a peaceful 
Improvement in the living standards of 
the people. It is a statement that the 
Central Government is concerned about 
people throughout the country, and that 
his Government is taking vigorous ac-
tion to demonstrate its concern. 
I met with Prime Minister Ky and se-
cured a copy of his speech from the U.S. 
Embassy. I believe it important that it 
should be printed in the RECORD, so that 
the full text will be available to the 
Members of the Congress of the United 
States and to the people of our country. 
I ask unanimous consent that it be 
printed at this point in the body of the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the address 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

"It is obvious," LONG says, "that this pro-
liferation of snooping paraphernalia is in-
ereasingly placing the constitutional right of 
privacy of the individual citizen in peril. 
"Surveillance is becoming more and more 
pervasive in our lives, and privacy is becom-
ing harder to protect. 
"If we expect to have any privacy in 1984 
or 1985?we must examine the probable ad-
vances in technology, and we must provide 
stringent laws against indiscriminate eaves-
dropping. 
"As incredible as it may seem, there are 
firtually no statutes, Federal, or State, to 
protect against eavesdropping, indiscrimi-
nate or otherwise." 
Beirne argues that eavesdropping and 
wiretapping equipment of all types should 
tie registered and that all users of such 
equipment must be licensed by the Federal 
Government. 
In the licensing provisions he urges that 
strict limits be placed on the eligibility of 
agencies and individuals entitled to use such 
equipm ent. 
"In discussing the weapons of eavesdrop-
ping and wiretapping," Beirne says, "we are 
talking about weapons as dangerous to 
democracy, to personal dignity, and to in-
dividual freedom as thermonuclear wean-
ons are to human survival. 
"We do not equip the State militia with 
thermonuclear missiles. Nor can the cop on 
the beat or the bank guard or the private 
detective avail himself of tactical nuclear 
weapons. 
"For the survival of privacy, dignity, and 
freedom, for the survival of those things 
that make human survival most meaningful,

tically limit the use of all forms of wiretap

A WAR THAT ALL CAN WIN?AD-
DRESS DELIVERED BY SENATOR 
McGOVERN OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. 
Madam President, on January 18, 1966, 
Senator GEORGE MCGOVERN delivered a 
aignificant address at the annual conven-
tion of the National Limestone Institute 
here in Washington. 
In discussing the International Food 
and Nutrition Act, authored by Senator 
MCGOVERN and now pending in the Con-
gress, he said: 
All men can be winner of a war against 
want, just as we are real winners today from 
the war against domestic want which started 
in the Thirties to bring an end to the para-
dox of want and surpluses coexisting within 
the United States itself. 
As a cosponsor of this bill, I call the 
attention of other Senators to his re-
marks, and ask unanimous consent that 
the text of the address be printed at this 
point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the address 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
A WAR TIIAT ALL CAN WIN 
t Remarks of Senator GEORGE MCGOVERN, of 
South Dakota, at the annual convention 
of the National Limestone Institute, 
Washington, D.C., January 18, 1966) 
For all of the decade I have spent in 
Washington I have been talking and writing 
shout a war against want. 
IL is a real pleasure to talk to some of the 
warriors?to the men of an industry who 
have helped husband our soil resources and 
keep them productive both by supplying an 
essential mineral, calcium-carrying lime-
No. 9-- - 15 
stone, and by defending the Federal program 
which has helped to increase limestone use 
from the 1- to 3-million-ton-level in the 
1921-46 period to 27 million tons last year. 
All Americans are indebted to you ?trid 
your industry for your part in the job 1 hat 
has been done. 
I know you have a direct interest in the 
agricultural conservation program. We all 
do. And we will all benefit if the applica-
tion of limestone to our farmlands climbs 
to the 80 million tons annually which the 
agronomists; tell us that we need. You would 
benefit. Farmers would benefit. The lend 
would benefit. America would be strength-
ened for the great war against hunger whieh 
lies ahead. 
Private enterprise--yours, the hybrid seed 
salesman's, the farm machinery and supply 
industry's, and the farmers'?has now ad-
mit tedly made the difference between Anier-
Ma's food abundance and the Commin oat 
bloc's conspicuous lag in agricultural devel-
opment and ability to feed its own people. 
Russia is now trying to build some incentives 
into her system and stimulate some of the 
sort of enterprise found in America. 
We also have an obligation the Lime-
stone Institute for the presence in Washing-
ton of your president, Bob Koch. 
Soh is a genius, and I say that thouee t-
fully. it have long known him as a man of 
great organizational ability and as a great 
legifiative strategist. Two or three months 
ago he produced an edition of your Limestone 
magazine so effective you received a wen-
deserved Freedom From Hunger Founda Lion 
Award. I can attest its effectiveness for I 
got a good many letters asking if I had seen 
it, or asking how to get a copy. Copies were 
also sent to me by a dozen people who 
wanted to be sure that I didn't miss it be-
tianse they were themselves so impressed. 
eln Bob has proved himself an editor end 
publisher of great talent. 
la:Let 'month, Bob and his staff almost 
single-handedly arranged an impressive or-
ganizational meeting the Committee on the 
World Food Crisis. No one else could have 
assembled such an outstanding group of na-
tional leadership people a-nd run a meeting 
so smoothly and impressively in the short 
time he had. Thus far, I have found nothing 
that your president cannot handle in a dis-
tinguished way. 
am pleased to have this opportunity to 
express my appreciation to you of him, at; I 
have already expressed it to him. 
Through your national office, this organi-
zation has already made a mighty contri-
bution to efforts to awaken our country to 
what I am stare is the greatest challenge of 
our times. It is a challenge which involves 
not only our moral responsibilities as Chris-
tians to our fellow men, but also our na-
tional security and the possibility of brSag-
ing into existence a world at peace. At the 
same time, it offers us an opportunity for 
economic growth. 
The world is faced with hunger and star-
vation on a scale never before known, unless 
we begin at once to plan for tomorrow's t ood 
needs, as well as to size population to what 
this planet can support. The food crises that 
are occurring this year in Russia, Red China, 
and India, resulting in food grain transac-
ticas of unprecedented size, arc' a very mild, 
pallid warning of what lies ahead. 
The reality is that the Russia, China, and 
India emergencies have only tended to divert 
attention from even larger, chronic hunger 
and, starvation in the world, which we have 
been taking for granted. Under so-called 
normal food supply conditions, want is far 
more extensive than generally realized. 
'Half a billion of the world's 3 billion 
people lack enough food. Another billion 
suffer from malnutrition, or lack of adequate 
proteins, vitamins and minerals in the foods 
955 
they eat. Three million children die etch 
year from diseases induced by malnutrition. 
Countless human beings go through life per-
manently crippled physically, mentally, and 
emotionally because they did not have proper 
food in their formative years. The ever-
present companions of malnutrition?leth-
argy, disease, and premature death?breed a 
vicious cycle of listless people, powerless to 
break out of their misery but capable of 
breeding children and multiplying misery. 
The present prospect of this undernourished 
planet is that population will double in the 
next 35 years and stand at 6 billion human 
beings in the year 2000. World popula Lien 
growth is now about 2 percent a year. 
The growth rate testifies to the miracles 
of modern medicine, but it is a miracle, upon 
us here and now, which mankind cannot 
manage unless we adopt policies and make 
adjustments with far greater speed and bold-
ness than ever before in human history. 
Massive famines that will take the lives of 
hundreds of thousands of our fellow men 
will be upon us in another decade unless the 
planet's agricultural resources?both those 
of America and of the less-developed world --
are brought to maximum production during 
that decade. 
There is one thing certain: the paradox 
of America restricting production while tens 
of millions starve cannot continue any more 
than this Nation in the thirties could tol-
erate the paradox of extensive want, hunger, 
and death in the midst of surpluses. 
Population control measures are on the 
way. But they will not be adopted over-
night. There remain both social and sci-
entific hurdles to be overcome. Control is 
unlikely to do a great deal about the antici-
pated 40-percent increase in world popula-
tion in the 15 years just ahead, to 1950. 
That means another 11/4 billion mouths 
feed and bodies to be supplied. 
Heroic increases in world food supplies are 
needed now to alleviate want and prevent 
another generation of warped bodies, ex-
tending the problem of handicapped adults 
another generation. Our surpluses are all 
but gone. Our 1.4 billion bushel carryover 
of wheat in 1961 will have been halved next 
July 1, and is headed down toward 600 mil-
lion or even 500 million bushels--less than 
an adequate security reserve. Feed grain 
carryover has been pulled down from 85 
million tons to 57 million tons. Dairy prod-
ucts are already in short supply seasonally. 
We need to stimulate soybean production 'for 
commercial markets this year. We have o. 
statistical surplus of cotton, but less t,tn 
enough to decently and warmly clothe the 
people on earth today. 
It will take large increases in food produce-
tion in the years just ahead if the adjustment 
is to be made with food rather than by re-
duction of population through war, cliseL,se, 
starvation, and mass deaths. 
This grim world outlook can be our 
greatest international opportunity if we :ire 
capable of a grand strategy in world affairs. 
We have two courses to choose between, now 
that Public Law 480, the food for peace law, 
Is drawing to an end because of the dis-
appearance of agricultural surpluses on 
which it is based. 
We can treat the race between food and 
population as a continuing, inevitable 
Iwo-
man tragedy which is remote from us. We 
can announce our surpluses are gone and let 
children and adults die off in the less de-
veloped and less fortunate lands, concen-
trating on protecting our island of affluence 
in a sea of misery with halfway aid measures 
and the threat of massive nuclear retaliation, 
If we choose that course, we will be running 
the risk of a cataclysmic war which will leave 
even the survivors in a cauldron of radio-
activity to meet an uncertain fate.

CONGRESSIONAL 
for the entrusted with national responsi-
bilities, to review the manner in which they 
have carried out these responsibilities, to 
assess the situation and to plan adequate 
actions for the next stage. 
This is why, today after over 200 days in 
the office entrusted to me by the directory 
as head of the Government and on the occa-
sion which coincides with the end of the 
At Ty lunar year, I consider it my duty to 
appear before you, fellow citizens and com-
rades in arms, to draw, together with you, 
a yearend balance sheet and to define the 
objectives for the year ahead. 
PART 
Dear fellow citizens and comrades in arms, 
before dealing with future objectives, we 
should of course glance back at the past and 
make a sincere review of past activities to 
determine what we have achieved and frankly 
acknowledge what we were unable to achieve 
and what still remains to be completed. 
I am going to review the negative part first 
because what the Government has not done 
according to its wishes has always obsessed 
me. 
Let me deal straight off with a minor 
problem but one which however is closely 
related to the daily life of the population in 
the capital and which has become a cause 
for criticism of the government: electricity. 
It is, of course, a handicap to industrial 
and commercial enterprises, and an irritL.-
tion for private citizens and the government 
alike, when so vital a commodity as elec-
tricity cannot be supplied. In many press 
conferences and communiques explanations 
have been given regarding the cause of the 
electricity shortage and the measures taken 
to solve it. Some deadlines for solution 
have been set. But notwithstanding this, 
the capital still remained short of electricity 
until the end of 1965. 
It was only at the beginning of the year 
that the electricity cut was limited to night-
time only. Despite the efforts made by the 
government to help solve the shortage?ef-
forts that yielded some results?the shqrtage 
which prevailed during the last 6 months 
was a stain which marred the picture of the 
government's achievements. 
While this stain still remains to be re-
moved, another has appeared: the bus 
transportation problem. You all know that 
problem. It has been a chronic disease. 
Many remedies have been tried to cure the 
disease but all of them failed. Finally, the 
government was compelled to remove the 
cause of the disease by allowing the bus 
management authority to wind up business 
and leave the place to another and sounder 
organization to run the company. 
Outside of Saigon, the existing state of 
the interprovincial communications network 
is also a problem, but one which must be 
blamed totally on the war, not on technical 
or organizational defects. And the present 
war is chiefly one of sabotage directed by 
the enemy mainly against eur infrastructure 
facilities: highways, bridges and so forth. 
Therefore, to solve the problem of lines of 
communication Is conditional on the solu-
tion of this war of sabotage. Now that the 
war situation has begun to turn to our ad-
vantage, the improvement of the communi-
cations network seems realizable. 
In the area of major concern is the eco-
nomic problem. No government whatsoever 
could boast full success in its economic 
policy after only 6 months in power, espe-
cially when it inherits a chaotic situation 
which lasted for 2mars and which bore the 
aftermath of a per' of 20 war years. 
But not to have attained success does not 
mean failure. The tremendous effort and 
the achievements recorded will demonstrate 
this. However, as long as there is a large 
gap between wages and prices, as long as 
our people must strive so hard to find such 
items of prime necessity as milk, sugar and 
cloth, and so long as our fellow countrymen 
RECORD -- SENATE 957 
have to wait long months before being able 
to buy a motorbike the present government 
has to admit shortcomings, as it has to make 
all-out effort to settle the whole problem or 
at least to reduce the numerous injustices 
which still abound in all classes of society. 
In the list? of shortcomings, we must 
acknowledge the absence of institutions 
planned in the provisional charter, which to 
date still fail to be realized: such as the High 
Economic and Social Council, and the High 
Council of Magistrates. We must also recog-
nize that, due to the present circumstances, 
the government still is unable to create a 
favorable political climate. This leads to a 
report of what remains to be done. 
These things of which I spoke were only 
part of the government's shortcomings. 
There were naturally many others, as men-
tioned almost daily in the press and by the 
public and that I sincerely admit in order to 
draw therefrom valuable lessons. 
Dear fellow citizens and comrades in arms, 
while considering these shortcomings from 
an impartial and objective viewpoint, we can-
not, however, deny the achievements made by 
the government during the short period of 
time since it came to power. 
In contrast to the earlier 6-month period, 
and contrary to pessimistic predictions by 
those malcontent politicians and especially 
by those ill omen tellers, we have achieved 
political stability, a key prerequisite if we 
are to win the present ideological war. The 
success in this can be ascribed to the spirit 
of comprehension and cooperation prevailing 
among all strata of the population and 
among all political and religious groups. 
All of these were aware that the trend to 
division, to partisanship, and to mutual de-
struction in the national ranks are serious 
defecte which can only result in hurting the 
people's fighting potential at a time when the 
Communists are increasing their war effort. 
Because of this achievement in national 
solidarity and unity of mind and action, our 
rear has been more consolidated than ever 
before, compared with what prevailed under 
previous postrevolution governments. It is 
also evident that this support for the front-
line and the consolidation of the rear have 
taken place in an enthusiastic and stimu-
lating atmosphere which has brought to-
gether the major sections of the population. 
That is also the reason leading to the 
obvious improvement of the military situa-
tion, and that is also why the free world 
has shown its confidence in us with a great 
number of democratic nations giving full 
assistance in all fields to us. The most elo-
quent proof has been the participation in 
the fight, without any conditions, by the 
allied forces, who fight alongside their Viet-
namese comrades in arms on all the battle-
fields. This has resulted in important mili-
tary victories, making the situation better 
every day. If we were not cautious, we would 
say more and more optimistic. Without hav-
ing to elaborate the difference compared to 
what it was 6 months ago it is clear for all 
to see. 
Our military victories began immediately 
in the rainy season, the very monsoon sea-
son in which the Vietcong had boasted many 
times that they won the initiative in every 
battlefield. If this Communist propaganda 
made some lose their confidence and be-
come pessimistic, the government can point 
to its victories in the present dry season as 
something more specific than propaganda. 
Since last October, after the world-famed 
victories of Pleime, Ya Drang, and Chu Prong, 
where thousands of Communist bodies were 
left behind, Government forces, with the 
effective support of allied forces, successively 
won many other important battles: the Ba 
Ria ambush, the pursuit operation against 
the VC Dong Thep Regiment at My Tho, Bau 
Bang, Ben Cat, as well as the battles at Cau 
Ke, Cho Gao, Thach Tru, Lap Vo, Tam Ky, 
Long My, and so on. Everywhere, enemy 
bodies were lying all over the battlefield 
along with huge quantities of weapons. 
All this testifies to the Valiant spirit and 
the combat tactics of the Government and 
allied forces. Of course, this fighting spirit 
can only endure if one has confidence in the 
Government and in the future of our Nation. 
The point most worth mentioning in this 
present phase of our struggle is that no 
enemy position and no enemy stronghold 
can be considered safe, because all these have 
been smashed in repeated bombings and 
shellings. 
In brief, in constrast with the military 
situation this month last year, the Govern-
ment and allied troops have completely in 
hand the initiative of operations at every 
battlefront, and the tide of the war has 
turned in our favor. 
Following the military victories, the Gov-
ernment has also scored many valuable sue-
cesses in the diplomatic field. The Govern-
ment has striven to restore the national 
prestige, the confidence, as well as the 
strengthening of cooperation and support, 
of the friendly countries in this anti-Com-
munist struggle. 
That is one reason why many high-level 
delegations from our country have made 
goodwill visits to neighboring countries, such 
as the delegation led by the Secretary. Gen-
eral Of the National Directory to the Philip-
pines recently and the visits to the Republic 
of China, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, 
and Thailand. 
The Vietnamese missions abroad also in-
structed their personnel to hold conferences 
and seminars at the universities, associations, 
press organizations, with student and re-
ligious and other groups to explain the 
aggressive plot of Communist North Viet-
nam, and the Vietnamese people's and Armed 
Forces' struggle. 
Our diplomatic offensive has greatly 
diminished any prestige the Vietcong had. 
The most concrete proof of this is that the 
British Government has put aside a resolu-
tion submitted by a leftist parliamentary 
group and formally announced that it rec-
ognized only the lawful government of the 
Republic of Vietnam. 
Countries friendly to us, especially those 
in the Afro-Asian bloc, which include a large 
majority of nonalined countries that form-
erly paid little attention to our struggle for 
self-defense, have changed their attitude 
and now show good will and sympathy to-
ward us through support for Vietnam at the 
Algiers conference. 
At the United Nations General Assembly, 
many member nations have affirmed their 
support of the stand of the Republic of Viet-
nam. At present, nearly 40 free world coun-
tries are actively contributing to our struggle 
in one form or another and will continue 
their assistance until our final victory over 
the Communists and until peace and hap-
piness are restored to the entire people. 
Next comes the economic aspect. Though 
communication difficulties greatly affect the 
national economy the Government's efforts 
in regularising the internal market have been 
as follows: 
Rice supply: During the past 3 months 
more than 82,000 tons of rice have been sup-
plied to the eastern provinces, the central 
highland, and midlands. Some 1,735 tons 
of paddy and 90 tons of rice have been trans-
ported from the Mekong delta to Saigon. 
Rice imported from the United States totaled 
more than 27,000 tons shipped to Da Nang 
arid more than 16,000 shipped to Nha Trang. 
With more than 93,000 tons of imported rice, 
the Economy Department will have enough 
rice to provide for local needs and to set up 
reserves for the provinces. , 
During the past 3 months, 21,334 tons of 
sugar and 331,600 cases of condensed milk 
have been put on sale.

September and October but now thanks to 
the Government's efforts, food is no longer 
short and prices are stable. For example, 
Saigon consumes daily from 800 to 1,000 pigs. 
The price of pork previously was high be-
cause the city received only 400 pigs a day. 
But now the supply has become regular and 
in the last month the city has received 2000, 
pigs every day or twice the quantity it needs. 
The price of pork has dropped accordingly. 
Since July 1965 the Government has spent 
$47 million to import rice, condensed nail:: 
and wheat flour, the quantity of which 
largely exceeds local needs for the Lunar New 
Year. 
To meet any emergency the Government 
has set up storage depots to stock needed 
goods such as rice. These include: two rice 
depots in Ba Xuyen and Bac Lieu, three in 
Oa Nang, Qui Nhon and Nha Trang, eight 
depots for the cooperatives in the western 
provinces, six depots for the tobacco co-
operative and other depots for cotton yarn 
and paper. 
To supply other needed materiel for the 
population, the Government has provided 25 
more million of U.S. dollars to Import motor-
bikes, scooters, radios, sewing machines, and 
other goods. Meanwhile assistance from 
countries other than the United States have 
been used to import industrial equipment. 
To cope with artificial shortages and exces-
sive price increases, the establishment of 
large retail centers is being studied. 
Our efforts to improve the standard of liv-
ing and activities in the field of social welfare 
are also noteworthy: 
Land reform: Thanks to the new land re-
form program, 3,158 farmers have been made 
landowners since September 1965. Of this 
total, 2,268 low-income farmers in 10 prov-
inces were allotted cultivated land in ac-
cordance with ordinance 57. A further 758 
families in seven provinces were allowed to 
work public-owned land and 132 families in 
one province were allotted cultivated land 
which was purchased from French nationals. 
Further, by virtue of the October 8, 1965, 
decree, 227,629 families that were working 
on cultivating fallow land in the clearing 
and resettlement centers have been given 
ownership of 134,700 hectares of cultivated 
land. 
Electrification of the rural areas: Three 
rural electrification pilot cooperatives were 
established In Tuyen Due, An Giang, and 
Due Tu (Bien Hoa) with the view of supply-
ing power to the cooperative members at low 
prices. The Rural Electrification Cooperative 
Union was established on October 15, 1965, 
in order to push ahead the rural electrifica-
tion program. 
Workers' appropriation program: A total of 
400 taxicabs and 200 tri-Lambrettas were 
imported In the first phase of the Govern-
ment's program to sell these vehicles on an 
installment basis to drivers who used to rent 
their cars from others. A first lot drawing of 
such vehicles took place on January 8, 1966, 
in the capital. All the vehicles will be dis-
tributed by January 17. Other contingents 
of such vehicles will be imported by the 
Economy Department for redistribution. 
f.ow-cost housing units: The Public 
Works and Communications Department 
built 554 single-story housing units at Vinh 
Hui and Tan Qui Dong. Other construc-
tion projects such as road paving and drain-
age operations are underway at Thanh My 
'ray. Thanh Oa and Phu Tho Hoa. An-
other building project, covering the construc-
tion of 1,000 housing units, at VN$25,000 
each for workers is :under study. Pay-
ment for the homes will be made on a 10-
to 20-year installment basis and no down 
payment will be required. At the same time, 
the Department also plans to buy up vacant 
lots and sell them on an installment basis 
to low-income families who wish to do their 
own building. Another noteworthy fact is 
that the Government has cancelled the "vil-
la" building project for certain civil servants 
which was initiated by previous govern-
ments. 
Health: The Health Department made a 
tremendous effort to build in the capital as 
well as in various provinces, a dispensary, 
a psychiatric center, a leprosy center, a sur-
gical section, four maternity clinics, and a 
farm for mentally ill persons. These ef-
forts have been carried out, along with the 
training of rural health cadres. We have 
arranged the reception of foreign medical 
teams including a number of experts and 
quantities of materials and drugs. 
Social welfare work: As of December 12, 
1965, the Social Welfare Department granted 
a total of VN$285,714,210 to anti-Red ref-
ugees throughout the country. Of the total 
number of refugees, 160,434 have been re-
settled. The Social Welfare Department also 
has enlarged the Thu Due Nationa: Orphan-
age and built two new orphanages in Vinh 
Long and Birth Thuan at a total cost of 
VN$12 million. Plans have also been drafted 
for the construction of 20 day nurseries and 
12 other orphanages in 1966 at a total esti-
mated cost of VN$82 
All the regional social welfare organiza-
tions throughout the country have received 
financial assistance from the Social Welfare 
Department for further development. A 
beggar reformation center has been set up 
at Phu Binh in an effort to put an end to 
begging which must be eliminated in any 
modern society. 
In the field of information, with the aim 
of bringing news to large numbers of people 
in the rural areas, more than 30 provincial 
newspapers have been published. During the 
past 6 months, the Chieu Hoi (open arms) 
program recorded more than 7,000 returnees 
who brought in nearly 1,000 weapons. 
Television is one of the newest activities 
in our society. After a series of studies, on 
January 3, 1966 we signed an agreement with 
the American Government on telesasion. At 
the end of this month television programs 
will be available here. One thousand TV sets 
will be installed in the heavily populated 
areas of the capital and in nearby provinces. 
A following shipment will bring another 
1,500 sets to Vietnam. 
In the field of culture and educa Lion, one 
can note the following points: 
An education reform movement has been 
launched in order to help studen hi make 
progress from the moral, intellect oat and 
physical points of view. The movement also 
aims at giving the students a stronger sense 
of responsibility as citizens. This is an at-
tempt -to form it new generation of south for 
the reconstruction of the countrje Four 
pilot centers are now actively open i Ling to-
ward this end. 
A large number of schools have lam built 
to cope with our educational needs, such as 
the Viet Due (Vietnamese-German) tech-
nical education and the craft and industry 
school at Thu Due, the school for :the deaf 
and dumb at Lai Thieu, three new primary 
schools in Thua Thien, Ham Tan, and Binh 
Toy and so on. In addition to all this, 546 
primary school noon classes which :ire very 
detrimental to the health of the children, 
have been abolished, and 224 new classrooms 
have been built for the pupils in the Saigon-
Gia Dinh area. 
The annual examinations at the primary 
and secondary education levels ha-e been 
revised for the benefit of the students. The 
primary education examinations and those 
for the junior high school certificates will 
no longer be held, starting with this school 
year. The baccalaureate I system ol exami-
nations will also be abolished starting with 
the 1968-69 school year. 
As another evidence of the government's 
efforts in the rural education field, out-
standing students from low-income families 
will be granted official scholarships, thus 
enabling worthy students to complete their 
secondary education. 
A cultural institute is to be established 
with a view to promoting all the national 
cultural activities. The institute will be 
open to writers, artists, journalists, and to 
the public as well. A program aimed at im-
proving arts and letters will be announced 
shortly and put into practice in the near 
future. 
Administrative reforms are also being 
tackled by the government. An adminis-
trative reform committee has been estab-
lished to study and to recommend all appro-
priate measures designed to increase the ad-
ministrative efficiency of the government 
machinery. As a result of such reforms, 
close cooperation between the Administra-
tive and Financial Inspection Directorate 
General on the one hand and the inspection 
divisions of the other departments on the 
other hand has been initiated. All the ad-
ministrative abuses such as misuse of au-
thority, bribery, misappropriation, etc., will 
be eliminated. 
In other fields, the Government has done 
its best to successfully serve the people in 
accordance with scheduled programs which 
are scheduled but which I will not mention 
here. 
The Government has strictly run its pro-
grams in line with what was announced 7 
months ago. The outcome of the prosecu-
tion of such programs are modest but un-
questionable and are decisive to the success 
of the social revolution. In fact, the steps 
which our society are taking have not merely 
started in another direction, they are already 
traveling in another direction. All those 
who directly contribute to the struggle for 
the emergence and the reconstruction of the 
fatherland are well treated and supported. 
All the low-income people who once suffered 
injustice under the old regime now are get-
ting land of their own to plow or taxicabs of 
their own to drive. In the economic field, no 
complete control of consumer goods prices 
has been made by the Government as yet. 
But the normalization of the supply of such 
goods by the Government has been effected. 
This means that the Government is cutting 
off opportunities for the profiteers' malprac-
tices by totally controlling the supply of the 
consumers' goods. In the military area the 
continuous victories on the battlefields have 
forced the enemy into a defensive position 
and he has to take recourse in terrorist acts. 
Although these results have not yet en-
tirely satisfied us, they do constitute reasons 
to strengthen our confidence in the final 
victory. 
PART II 
Dear fellow Vietnamese, dear comrades in 
arms, from the date of assumption of office 
by the war cabinet, the Government's 
policies and programs of action have been 
clarified on several occasions. Therefore, the 
major targets of the war cabinet could in 
no way be misunderstood by the people. 
The assessment of the home situation and 
the announcement of the major duties 01 
the war cabinet during the inauguration 
ceremony of the Government on June 19. 
1965, and the declaration of its 26-point pro-
gram of action still constitute the guiding 
principles for governmental projects. In 
addition, on October 1, after 100 days of 
office, I made an amendment -to the war 
cabinet's role so as to fit its progrems of 
action more closely to the national require-
ments. On that occasion I also confirmed 
my standpoint on the national revolution 
and restoration of peace?a standpoint which 
the Government is perseveringly and de-
terminately carrying out to respond to the 
situation. 
Within the framework of such general 
policy of the Government, and on the basis 
of the results which I have reported, I would

January,24, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 959 
like np;i: on behalf of the cabinet, to an-
nounct the main targets to be realized by 
the Government in 1966: 
A. First target: To win the war?to pacify, 
and to reconstruct the rural areas 
First of all, what do we really want? 
Such a question posed to any Vietnamese 
concerned with the fate of his compatriots 
and the honor of the nation and the hap-. 
piness of the people in this part of the 
world?which means the happiness of 
each individual and each family?gets this 
unique and unvarying answer: Decidedly, 
not to communism. 
To such an answer, no additional comment 
is needed. 
There is no answer more eloquent than 
the blood of thousands of combatants who 
have sacrificed themselves for the survival 
of the fatherland from the Red imperialists' 
invasion. 
There is no reason stronger than the hard-
ship endured by the Vietnamese combatants 
and civilians during the lifetime of one gen-
eration, the hardships of those who are de-
termined to eradicate Communist ideology 
from this part of the world. 
There is no evidence more concrete than 
the flow of anti-Red refugees who prefer 
leaving behind all that is so dear to them: 
homes, ricefields, villages, rather than live 
shamefully under Communists' tyranny. 
We are determined not to be Communists. 
Such is the unanimous determination, the 
slogan of the whole Vietnamese population, 
yesterday, today and tomorrow, and until 
the day the Communist threat is eliminated 
from this country. 
But how do we get rid of this threat? 
There is no other alternative to the solu-
tion than to defeat the Communists and to 
rout them from their strongholds. We must 
defeat the Communists and exterminate 
communism. Otherwise, the Communists 
will exterminate us and enslave our people 
from our generation to our offsprings' gen-
eration. No one can foresee when enslave-
ment by Communists will end, 
The present anti-Red struggle is a total 
one. Its battlefields are everywhere. But 
the main line of resistance is in the rural 
areas and that is where the struggle will be 
decided. 
So the formula for such a struggle for the 
war Cabinet is: to defeat the Communists, 
to pacify and to reconstruct the rural areas. 
Of course, such a formula is not a new dis-
covery. All the former governments called 
for rural reforms, back to the countryside, 
and so on. The policy remains the same, 
from the so-called strategic hamlet program 
to the new life hamlet action program, to 
to win the hearts of the people and to re-
move the poisonous fish from the pure rural 
waters. 
What about the results? There is no need 
to repeat the results. 
The war Cabinet will not follow the path 
of the one which has failed. It is deter-
mined to do something for the rural areas, 
the areas which constitute the main and 
basic part of our Nation. 
To attain this goal, one must have an ob-
jective and realistic view of the situation. 
In fact, after a victorious military opera-
tion, one may think that an area is auto-
matically pacified. But a state of insecurity 
can quickly return to the area by a small 
number of the Vietcong who mix themselves 
in with innocent people. 
Our viewpoint is not only to root out the 
Vietcong from the rural areas but also to 
root ourselves in the rural areas and this not 
only for some time, but forever. 
But, how to put this concept into action? 
The task of liberating national territory 
remains a heavy, but glorious, task of the? 
Armed Forces. But, naturally the Armed 
Forces cannot be stationed forever in every 
hamlet and village, and on every portion of 
the roads. For this reason, immediately 
after a successful military operation, an ef-
fective and well-organized group of cadres 
will arrive to exploit the advantages brought 
in by the military operation. They will carry 
out pacification work with their maintask to 
be the rebuilding of a new life in rural areas. 
These cadres will immediately set up teams 
among the people to help them rebuild their 
homes and till their land. They will contact 
authorities responsible for reconstruction of 
social welfare facilities such as schools, dis-
pensaries, maternity clinics and the like. To 
maintain and consolidate the security in the 
area, they will also rally and organize the 
local people. 
This effective system of cadres will spread 
horizontally from hamlet to hamlet and 
vertically from hamlet to village and village 
to district and so on. This will constitute 
an intersupport position having the effect 
of an oil spot. This is the very key to the 
problem of pacification and rural recon-
struction. 
These conceptions and plan of the govern-
ment will constitute the main work of the 
Vietnamese Government for this year. The 
Government is determined to mobilize every 
opportunity and every resource and make 
every effort to recover maximum control of 
our cherished population and our rural areas 
by the end of 1966. 
B. The second goal is to stabilize the eco-
nomic situation 
Our second important goal in the new 
year is to stabilize the economic situation. 
To draw up a correct economic policy, one 
must begin by assessing accurately the pres-
ent economic situation in the country. 
Do we have inflation or do we not? 
If we take the word in its literal meaning-
indiscriminately putting in circulation bank-
notes without maintaining proper gold and 
currency reserves?we do not have any infla-
tion because we have sufficient gold reserves 
to meet any currency demands. 
If we understand the word in its popular 
meaning, i.e. a too large and too rapid circu-
lation of the currency, then we do have this 
thing called inflation. Why? The following 
five reasons will explain this situation: 
1. For a long time, and particularly for the 
past few years, because of the increasing 
tempo of the war, the budget demands in-
creased to meet the war situation. To an 
already deficit budget we have added more 
deficits because of the instability and suc-
cessive,changes in the national situation. 
2. Die to increasing subversive Vietcong 
activities, the supply system has encountered 
many difficulties, many branches of produc-
tion have slowed down. 
3. A number of short-sighted businessmen, 
thinking only of their immediate interests, 
have indulged in speculation and hoarding, 
cornering the market in many items and 
disturbing the economic life of the people. 
4. To stop the expansion of Red imperial-
ism, 200,000 allied troops have come to Viet-
nam to fight on our side, with expenditures 
reaching 1 billion piasters a month. In 
addition to this are the amounts spent on 
construction. 
These reasons are the direct causes of the 
increase in the volume of currency while 
goods and other necessities could not supply 
the 'demand, thus creating price increases. 
We should introduce here a parenthesis: 
civil servants and employees in the private 
sector and other people who live on a fixed 
salary suffer the most from price spirals. 
At the same time, unemployment has com-
pletely disappeared, since services every-
where are paid at the highest rates ever 
seen. In brief, if there are some classes of 
people suffering from this situation, other 
classes have benefited and now have a higher 
living standard. This is an important 
change in the overall living standard of the 
Vietnamese society. It is too soon at present 
to estimate the effects. 
Such is the real situation and the difficul-
ties in the solving of the problems are enorm-
ous. I would like to report here a typi-
cal event. 
When speaking about the increase in the 
volume of currency and the decrease in 
available goods, everyone sees that the sim-
ple solution is merely to import a large 
quantity of foreign goods to make up for 
the shortage in local goods. 
Thus, in the last 3 months, the Gov-
ernment has released nearly $200 million 
from the aid funds as well as the Govern-
ment-owned foreign currency to import 
prime necessity goods. But the problem is 
not that simple. 
If you want to import goods, you have not 
only to pay for then, but also you have to 
hire ships to transport them and provide 
docks for landing them. 
The commercial port of Saigon can only 
receive a maximum of 200,000 tons a year. 
With the present American aid program, the 
volume of imported goods already exceeds 
more than double this figure, not counting 
military materiel. 
Thus, with the Government's utmost effort 
and with the help of the most eminent ex-
perts, it still needs a minimum period of 
several months to enlarge the landing piers 
and to construct new ones. This is the work 
the Government is urgently carrying out at 
Thu Thiem, an islet on Thu Duo River, and 
at Vung Tau, Cam Ranh, Qui Nhon, and Da 
Nang, so as to complete in a few months an 
emergency plan. 
This plan includes any urgent and reason-
able measures concerning financial, currency,-
and economic fields which will converge to-
gether to the important goal of maintaining 
the purchasing power of the piaster, arrest 
price increases, and provide the population 
with all the prime necessities. 
On the one hand, the Government will 
'strictly implement a policy of thrift and 
economy in its agencies, and reduce the na-
tional budget's expenditures to their mini-
mum, despite the increase in military ex-
penses. 
The decision to reduce the expenditures 
down to $55 billion and the decision to give 
priority in the national budget to rural re-
construction, and to construction of schools 
and hospitals was a basic element in discus-
sion with the U.S. Government on the aid 
program. These decisions led to an increase 
of U.S. aid this year to at least twice the 
amount of U.S. aid last year. 
On the other hand, the Government will 
strive to increase national resources, mostly 
its revenues by improving tax-collecting 
methods. In this respect, I am convinced 
that our compatriots of all social strata not 
only are eager to fulfill their duties toward 
the national budget, but also heartfully con-
tribute to any urgently needed national re-
quirements. 
The tax system is under reexamination 
with new standards on social equity, so as 
to enable those circles who were enriched 
greatly due to the war situation to have the 
opportunity to contribute more than other 
laboring and needy people, Concerning those 
who live on their monthly salary, the Gov-
ernment will carry out every logical and com-
plete supply system for their benefit. 
In the meantime, all Government credit 
and tax agencies will give every assistance 
to the establishment or development of all 
useful branches of business. The Govern-
ment is planning to expand public and semi-
public enterprises to enable Vietnamese 
capital to participate to a greater degree. 
Therefore, the savings can be used pro-
ductively. Investments for increasing pro-
duction will replace passive holding or illegal 
trade speculation, and foreign currency 
blo,ckmarketing, khich the Government is 
determined to eradicate. 
I would like to warn once again all those 
blindfolded profiteers who heard goods for

speculation and provoke price hikes; they 
will go bankrupt, because in the days to 
come, with the increase in foreign aid, im-
ported goods will Ilow into the local markets. 
Adequate measures and procedures will be 
adopted to enable an abundant and rapid 
import of goods. 
Concerning the consumers, I would like to 
call your attention to this fact: Every delay 
in the supplies and the temporary shortage 
of goods should be considered normal in a 
protracted war. So I ask you to avoid rush-
ing into crowded shops to buy some tem-
porarily short product. This only benefit:3 
dishonest dealers, pushes forward the speed 
of the money circulation and thus increases 
the pressure of inflation. 
C. Our third goal: To build democracy 
The third goal, building democracy, is as 
urgent and important as the two previous 
ones. I would like to clarify once more--
to be sure ihat no one misunderstands the 
present government's goal and policy: be-
cause of the need in this historic phase, and 
conscious of their responsibilities toward 
the national destiny, the armed forces have 
assumed power, not with the intention of 
clinging to it, but to create the necessary con-
ditions for setting up a genuine democracy 
that will answer the aspirations of the entire 
people and the goal of our nation's long 
war which lies been with us since the French 
domination to present. 
My viewpoint in this problem has not origi-
noted from my subjective conception but 
from . an objective situation of the 2-year 
period following the November 1, 1963, events, 
Two years which saw the profound division 
of the people, the decomposition ol our so-
ciety, the internal subversion, along with a 
war that reached its highest intensity?all 
this caused a loss of confidence in this part 
of land, increased the people's suspicion, ann 
sowed confusion among them. No one had 
confidence in anything and every theory, 
policy, or program submitted was regarded 
with distrust :tad cynicism. 
le pure theory, democracy is the only fac-
tor which can defeat communism; if there is 
no democracy we lose the reason for our 
etruggle, let alone the means of victory. 
A genuine concept of democracy, however, 
should be based on the true situation al the 
country, the real circumstances of the so-
Mety, the political maturity level of the pop. 
illation and, in this case, the subversive war 
being waged by the Communists. 
fact, in these 2 years, there was no basic 
document winch could serve as a basis for 
building democracy. A provisional conven-
tion which was in effect no longer than 3 
months was violated, amended, and some 
mouths later, completely buried, only to be 
replaced by what was called the Vung Tau 
Charter. 'obis charter had been the cause of 
a troubled, dark period before a civilian gov-
ernment come into being with a provisional 
charter. Cut the fate of this document was 
no differen i; from fiat of its predecessors. 
Now, with the National Leadership Coni mu,-
tee, we have a convention, but this is no mme 
than a temporary statute which comes from 
the Government, not from the people. 
When one speaks of demoeracy, everything 
sthould come from the base that is the 
people-. entire people, or at least, the ma-
jority of them?and not dilated from the 
Government and forced on the people. 
A democratic regime should begin with a 
democratic constitution. But a constitution 
la not the work of a few days, and also it is 
not an experiment in a laboratory. Thus, 
the main point of the problem is to build 
democracy. 
Without such a basic medium, a constitu-
tion, no matter how ideal, will be wilt and 
carte away, ii it is not torn up by the up-
risings. 
llowevcr. I do not mean that this G'cry-
ernment wall use the state of war, or play up 
anticommunism or use the present condition 
of the nation, to restrict democratization. 
This Government has made up its mind to 
proceed with democratization, slowly but 
determinedly by training the people for their 
responsibilities and their interests, by helping 
the social organizations and political parties 
find ways and means to step up their activ-
ities and strengthen their positions. Thus 
win such organizations and parties lend a 
successful hand to the common performance 
of the national duties in the fut:ire. This 
Government has also made up its mind to 
drop demagoguery and to deny any con-
fused, shortsighted and Mind democratiza-
tion which will push the whole nation into 
chaos. 
With such a philosophy, we move on our 
way toward progress with the following: 
I. A democracy building council will be 
set up after the lunar new year. Upon for-
mation, such a council will propose a draft 
constitution in the near future. 
2. This draft constitution will serve as the 
main topic of discussion for seminars to be 
held throughout the country. Invited to 
participate in such seminars will be city and 
provincial councilmen, members of political 
parties, trade-union members, and students. 
So all the pros and cans of the matter con-
cerned will be aired and recorded. Thus the 
preparation of the future constittition will 
be the preoccupation of the whole people, 
not of just a minority. 
3. Once these seminars are launiehed, the 
Democracy Building Council will collect and 
consolidate the opinions and ideas of the 
participants a.nd arrive at a consensus. The 
council will then amalgamate the various 
points into a document to be voted upon in 
a popular referendum. 1 he referendum will 
be held next October. 
4_ After the people's opinions seminars 
have decided on a particular constitution, 
that constitution will serve as the basis of 
our democratic regime and will be officially 
proclaimed next November. 
Those who wonder why we don't elect a 
constitutional assembly like many other 
countries have to look straight at the pres-
ent war situation with its difficulties, com-
plexities, and tricks, to find the answer. 
The situation of our country is :not like 
any other, so why take after other countries? 
We have to establish a constitution which 
fits our nation. 
5. When we have the people's opinions on 
the constitution, we Will prepare for real 
democratic elections in 1967. With these 
elections, we will have legislative services, 
according to the people's will, and come 
back to the regular government elected by 
the people. 
While accomplishing these objectives we 
naturally also have to increase our efforts 
in the war and in the rural reconstruction 
program, in order to recover the Vietcong-
controlled areas and help the anti-Com-
munist refugees. The elections will only 
have meaning and value if security' is assured 
and the citizens vote in large numbers. This 
is one reason why we are choosing a gradual 
and stable solution for the establishment of 
our democracy. 
Besides, it is a reality which everyone 
has to accept, to be patient and confident, 
to prepare for the next step. As for the 
Government, it will carry out its responsi-
bilities in these tasks and provide the orga-
nizations and parties with appropriate op-
portunities and conditia:is to reach a mature 
and superior level, to assure the future of 
the nation. The Org,anittations and the par-
ties themselves will--to be realist re-
view their ranks, reorganize themselves, form 
new cadres, and reinforce their real strength 
and prestige to assure themselves of the peo-
ple's and authorities' confidence. 
On this point, I would like to add that, 
though the present Government raay still be 
awkward and inexperienced, there is no doubt 
of its good will in collaborating with evani-
zations, parties, and individuals who Whole-
heartedly want to lay the foundation for 
our future true democracy. 
This completes the report on the objec-
tives of the Government's program. 
On this occasion, I deem it my duty to 
point out the traditional ideal and determi-
nation of the Vietnamese people which is to 
always cherish and seek peace but only a 
peace which will guarantee its freedom, in
sovereignty, and territorial in-
tegrity. Any other form of peace which fails 
to provide these guarantees, would only be 
a lure into slavery and one which the Vietna-
mese people, with their clearsightedness and 
courage, would crush down in order to pro-
ceed toward a genuine and realistic peace. 
For those who still nurture doubts about 
this issue, I would say to them: our con-
cept of peace is very simple. We have not 
provoked war, we have not declared war. 
The present war is an invasion from outside. 
our country and one which at the outset was 
disguised as an internal struggle. But the 
disguise has been removed for a long time 
and the invader has uncovered himself. 
Now, it is up to the invaders from outside 
and his subversive henchmen within our 
country to end the invasion and subversion 
Then peace would at once return to this part 
of the country. Thus we would end the 
concern of so many nations large anti Srnafl 
and of so many statesmen the world over. II 
the invaders, acting like a blind force, cam.-
not restrain themselves, then it would be oor 
duty and the duty of all those peace-loving 
people to combine efforts to contain their 
ambition. Otherwise, the last resort woulet 
be to "outlaw them as peace saboteurs" in 
this peace-loving and freedom-loving part 
of this country. 
I deem it my duty also to express the sin-
cere gratitude of all our people to all the 
countries and international organizations 
and statesmen, as well as to all religious 
leaders, especially Pope Paul VI. who have 
demonstrated great concern over the plight; 
of the Vietnamese people. I further won: 
to insist that peace is workable only if it can 
guarantee national independence as well :13 
the people's freedom of thought and human 
dignity. 
I also want to associate all our fellow 
citizens and comrades-in-arms to the ac-
knowledgement that under whatever cir-
cumstances, we should ourselves be respon-
sible for our own destiny. No other nation 
is qualified and able to decide on our destiny., 
independently of our own will. For reasons 
of international solidarity, we have accepted, 
and are grateful for the moral and motorist, 
military and economic, assistance from the 
friendly countries. But never can we tol-
erate any Interference harmful to our lin-
tional sovereignty or any decision at vari-
ance with our people's aspirations. 
Fellow citizens, comrades in arms, now I 
have spoken. out all my feelings, my remarks 
and nay observations and I have reported o 
the objectives of both the National Directory 
and the war Cabinet from the period just 
ended to the next one. 
Despite the clamor of war roaring arcival 
us, despite the noisy provocations hurled by 
our enemy to discourage us, despite differ-
ences of view touched off by certain people, 
whether responsible or not, we mire deter-
mined to hold unflinchingly to our spirit, to 
endure suffering with great patience, to pur-
sue tenaciously the struggle for national 
salvation and reconstruction with the pur-
pose of defeating the Communists and bring-
ing back peace to the fatherland. We wird 
prevail in our present national plight in or-
der to bring back democracy, prosperity and 
happiness to our people. 
With this strong belief and decision, I sin-
cerely urge all our compatriots without dis-
tinction of class, religion, social stratum 
group, or party to clearly assist in the effort

to swep aside all friction, confrontation, 
or jealousy of an individual or communal 
nature and devote all their efforts and will 
to the future reconstruction of the father-
land and nation. 
When the nation is faltering, when the 
country is suffering destruction and parti-
tion, most of our families will suffer estrange-
ment, separation, misery, and the loss of 
loved ones. 
If there are some classes of our society 
which are privileged, this is just a minority 
in the different classes of the national com-
munity. 
The war situation, along with disorder, 
oppression and the struggle for survival and 
for progress have created social injustices, 
hampered the love of the nation and of man-
kind, and even has caused that love to be 
forgotten. 
In the face of this state of affairs, I can 
only make a sincere appeal to every strata of 
society and to all of our compatriots to share 
the misfortune and to help the families 
who have been unfortunate in this national 
catastrophe. I also urge them to look 
straight at the situation created by the sub-
version, the mourning, and the war, in order 
to come to the assistance of our poor com-
patriots by sacrificing to a certain extent 
our own interests. 
Only with this can one hope to reduce 
social injustices, to restore the love for our 
fellow creatures, so that we may advance 
toward the reconstruction of this country. 
The international situation is now going 
through tremendous changes which will see 
either the upsurge or the decline of our 
people. The period that lies ahead will be 
a decisive one as far as the salvation and re-
construction of this beloved land of ours is 
concerned. 
We will have opportunities to quickly re-
fill the gaps, the delays, and the waste of 
time which occured during the past 2 years. 
We should remain united in mind and 
spirit so that we may try to take advantage 
of these opportunities. We alone can save 
ourself. We can not stay idle waiting for 
assistance from others. 
I am of the opinion that those of us who 
are still alive have as had those who have 
died, the duty of contributing to the task 
of rebuilding, renovating, and developing 
this land to help it become stronger and to 
help it progress. 
This is our heritage and the heritage of 
our successive generations. 
I resolutely have confidence in the clear-
minded recognition and of the reasonable 
choice of all fellow countrymen as well as 
of our fellow combatants. 
I salute my fellow countrymen and fellow 
combatants. 
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
MINIMUM WAGE LAW 
Mr. TYDINGS. Madam President, 
since my duties as presiding officer of the 
Senate last Thursday kept me from 
speaking on H.R. 8126, the bill to amend 
the District of Columbia minimum wage 
law before it was passed by the Senate, I 
would like to take a moment now to note 
for the record, my strong support for this 
long overdue reform and my pleasure at 
its passage. 
Madam President, the concept of mini-
mum wage legislation for the District of 
Columbia is not new. Congresss first 
enacted a District of Columbia minimum 
wage law in 1918. That law was a pio-
neer in -the minimum wage field. 
But as the decades have passed, that 
law stood still. Its coverage was too re-
strictive and its provisions were to rigid 
to meet the needs of the National Capital. 
Although many workers in the District 
were protected by the minimum wage 
provisions of the Fair Labor Standards 
Act, more than 200,000 employees who 
work in the District of Columbia were not 
protected by any minimum wage law. 
Indeed, one of the most glaring defects 
of the 1918 law was that it covered only 
female and children employees. It gave 
no protection to men at all. Nor did it 
cover ci.inestic workers. 
Who needs minimum wage protection? 
Do the lawyers, doctors, architects and 
other 'Professional people have to worry 
about earning the $1.25 an hour mini-
mum wage the bill the Senate passed 
last Thursday authorizes? Do organized 
and skilled employees work for less than 
$1.25 an hour? 
No, the people who directly benefit 
from minimum wage legislation and the 
people who need it most are the unskilled 
workers whose labor contributes so 
greatly to the effective functioning of 
society, but whose skills are so slight 
or whose employment is so unstable that 
they have little power to organize and 
no ability to bargain for a decent wage. 
The dishwashers, the waiters, the jani-
tors, the car parkers, the household 
maids, and the thousands of others who 
provide many of the services which make 
life easier and more pleasant for all of us, 
most often find that society is willing to 
accept their labor, but not willing to see 
that they are paid a living wage. 
In preparing the minimum wage bill 
we passed Thursday, the Senate District 
Committee discovered too many cases 
like that of a restaurant kitchen worker 
here in the District who works 48 hours 
a week and gets only $12.50 a week and 
two meals a day for his pay. The com-
mittee discovered an apartment house 
maintenance man paid $35.40 for a 40-
hour week and a parking lot attendant 
paid 45 cents an hour. 
We cannot tolerate these incredible 
conditions anywhere in the country, and 
especially not in the Capital. 
H.R. 8126, as amended and passed by 
the Senate, is a reasonable response to 
the pressing problem of providing a mini-
mum living wage for thousands of work-
ers in the District of Columbia. 
By extending the minimum wage to 
men, as well as women and children, in 
the District, the bill will eliminate con-
ditions such as those found to exist in 
one upholstery shop, where a man was 
paid 90 cents an hour for doing the same 
work women do in the same shop for 
$1.10 an hour. 
By requiring payment of time and a 
half for overtime, the bill will reduce 
the excessive hours worked in many Dis-
trict of Columbia places of business and 
spreading the number of jobs available. 
By extending the minimum wage to 
domestic workers in the District of Co-
lumbia for the first time, the bill will 
guarantee a decent wage for the many 
women who labor in others' homes to 
provide or supplement a bare subsistence 
income for their families. 
All this bill does is to make sure that 
District of Columbia workers receive at 
least the national minimum wage for 
their labors. All this bill basically pro-
vides is that for a 40-hour week, 52 
961 
weeks a year, a worker should receive at 
least $2,600. 
A reasonable minimum wage for the 
workers of the District of Columbia will 
help hold families together, help contain 
welfare costs, and help provide a decent 
opportunity for family dignity. A de-
cent minimum wage will generate in-
creased purchasing power for District of 
Columbia" businesses, thereby improving 
economic conditions generally, and pro-
viding greater employment opportunity. 
But an equally compelling reason for 
enacting this District of Columbia mini-
mum wage bill is that the human cost of 
a lower minimum wage is simply too 
high to bear. When the father of a 
family cannot make enough to feed and 
clothe his family, the community cost is 
increased crime and delinquency, wors-
ened slums and rising welfare expenses 
is intolerable by the cost to our con-
science of standing by while fellow citi-
zens are exploited by a cynical and 
heartless wage slavery. 
This revision of the District of Colum-
bia minimum wage law was long overdue. 
It was necessary. It was right. 
PRAISE FOR JACK VAUGHN AND 
LINCOLN GORDON 
Mr. CHURCH. Madam President "A 
Good Reshuffle"?that is what the New 
York Times called the change which 
brought Jack Vaughn in as Director of 
the Peace Corps and Lincoln Gordon to 
take his place as Assistant Secretary of 
State for Latin American Affairs. Know-
ing them both, I can say "amen" to the 
praise they have both received. 
Jack Vaughn was in on the ground 
floor of the Peace Corps. He was there 
from the first, and was one of those who 
kept its programs close to the earth. He 
has emphasized a community develop-
ment approach by which corpsmen act 
as catalysts, cheerleaders, gadflies, and 
promoters for self-help projects which 
begin when the local people identify 
their needs. When he came to the Peace 
Corps, there were 123 volunteers in Latin 
America. When he left to become Am-
bassador to Panama, there were 3,000. 
I have seen them at work in the urban 
slums and destitute backlands of Brazil, 
and I can testify that they are doing a 
praiseworthy job. 
It was in Brazil, where he has served 
as our Ambassador, that I first met Lin-
coln Gordon. I endorse the appraisal 
of him made by the New York Times. 
Their editorial of January 19 said: 
The appointment of Lincoln Gordon as the 
new Assistant Secretary of State for Latin 
America brings to that difficult assignnient 
a man with penetrating judgment and a 
wealth of useful experience as an economist, 
Government official, and diplomat. 
He has been an enthusiastic Ambassador to 
Brazil, providing that country with sensible 
economic advice and trying tactfully to steer 
its present military regime toward a demo-
cratic solution of its difficulties. Mr. Gordon 
understands what the Alliance for Progress 
Is all about and can be depended upon to 
give it resolute support. 
The Washington Evening Star said of 
Jack Vaughn: 
(He) was doing a remarkable job as As-
sistant Secretary of State for Latin American

Affairs and U.S. coordinator of the Alli-
ance * *. His selection does assure the 
Peace Corps of an able, imaginative Director. 
Mr. President, both men promise well. 
We have reason for reassurance in their 
selection. 
I ask unanimous consent that the two 
editorials to which I have referred be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the edito-
rials were ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
From the New York Times, Jan. 19, 19661 
A 100D RESHUFFLE 
Whether his directorship of the poverty 
program. enhances or detracts from his 
reputation in the future, Sargent Shriver's 
service with the Peace Corps has marked 
him as an effective idealist. 
The idea for the Peace Corps was first 
broached by Vice President ROBERT Hum-
PTIREY in the Senate and Representative 
Hans's, of Wisconsin, in the House and was 
later taken up by President_ Kennedy; but it 
was Mr. Shriver who transformed an exciting 
idea into a convincing success. His zest and 
energy have helped thousands of volunteers, 
young and old, cut through the deadly smog 
of cynicism that tends to envelop foreign 
policy and to reach the poignant human re-
alities that lie behind today's crises. 
Jack Hood Vaughn, who now takes over 
the leadership of the Peace Corps, is doubt-
less happy to be leaving the State Depart-
ment, where he has been Assistant Secretary 
for Latin America. As an outsider with an 
academic background, he has been sand-
wiched between the career Foreign Service 
officers below him and the dominating per-
sonality of Under Secretary Thomas C. Mann 
above him. 
Ile had barely assumed office a year ago 
when the Dominican Crisis erupted. Mr. 
Vaughn has loyally defended administra-
tion actions in that crisis, but the evidence 
suggests that he was a bystander, as Presi-
dent johnson and Under Secretary Mann did 
most of the policymaking. Back in the Peace 
Corps, where he previously served as Latin 
American chief, Mr. Vaughn can deploy his 
talents in a line of work totally congenial to 
Ii rn. 
The appointment of Lincoln Gordon as 
the new Assistant Secretary or State for 
Latin America brings to that difficult assign-
ment a man with penetrating judgment and 
a wealth of useful exerience as an economist, 
Government official, and diplomat. He has 
been an enthusiastic Ambassador to Brazil, 
providing that country with sensible eco-
nomic advice and trying tactfully to steer its 
present military regime toward a democratic 
solution of its difficulties. Mr. Gordon un-
derstands what the Alliance for Progress is 
ail about and can be depended upon to give 
it, resolute support. If any man can reassert 
the full authority of the Assistant Secre-
tary as chief policymaker for Latin America 
in the bureaucratic jungles of Washington, 
Mr. Gordon is the man. 
'From the Washington (D.C.) Evening Star. 
19, 19661 
(.; InDIan FOR. BATTLE 
The White House showed good Judgment in 
giving the war on poverty its first full-time 
administrator. TiliS is the most ambitious 
of all the domestic programs created by the 
Johnson administration?and, at the 
moment, the most vulnerable. The Repub-
licans are talking of scandals in the anti-
poverty war that will be revealed in due 
course. And such extravagant failures as 
New York City's Haryou-Act program have 
left the public skeptical of the whole opera-
tion. Relieved of his Peace Corps job, Mr. 
Shriver still will have his hands full defend-
ing and guiding what has become a prime 
target of congressional criticism. 
The White House had to raid the State 
Department to find a Peace Corps Director?
and the Alliance for Progress seems to be the 
loser. We agree with Representative S1?1,DEN, 
chairman of the Inter-American Affairs Sub-
committee, that Jack Hood Vaughn was do-
ing a remarkable job as Assistant Secretary 
of State for Latin American Affairs and 
United States coordinator or the alliance. 
It is even possible that Vaughn's present 
tasks are a good deal more important than 
anything he could do as Peace Corps Director.

cif an able, imaginative director?ltiaving 
Sargent Shriver free to wage the bigger war

SAGA OF THE SEA 
Mr. BARTLETT. Madam Pres]cient, 
on November 26, 1965, the SS Oduna, 
battered by high seas and 50-mile-an-
hour winds, ran aground between rocks 
and a high cliff on Unimak Island, off 
western Alaska. 
The angle of the ship made it im-
possible to lower lifeboats. Thus the 
scene was set for another great saga of 
the sea. In the true tradition of those 
that go down to the sea in ships, coura-
geous attempts to take the men off the 
SS Oduna were successful. The entire 
crew of :37 was rescued. 
The ship, on a regular run from Adak 
to Seattle, was owned by the Alaska 
Steamship Co. The company's agent 
hl Kodiak submitted a report on the 
crow. The report is fascinating read-
ing. I ask unanimous consent that the 
report be printed in the RECORD at the 
eonclusion of my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
(See exhibit :L.) 
Mr. BARTLETT. Madam President, 
those reading the report will learn of 
the courageous actions of four members 
of the crew of the MV Adeline Foss, a 
Seattle-based tug which sped to the 
stricken ship on receiving its S 0 it 
Weather conditions made it inipos-
Able to approach the Oduna from the 
sea or the air. Military helicopters sent 
to the scene were forced to wait for a 
turn in the weather. 
However, the Adeline Foss crc wmen 
Cid not wait, A party consisting of 1st 
Mate W. D. Thompson and Seamen 
.Russ Christensen, Larry Ostby, and Ted 
Snider, managed to land on Unimak 
Island. After making their way down 
the cliff they successfully set up a 
breeches buoy line and brought 19 mem-
bers of the Oduna safely to shore. At 
that point, the weather improved and 
the rescue was completed by helicopter. 
A report of the rescue operation has 
been submitted to the Merchant Marine 
Awards Committee for consideration of 
possible awards for the four men of the 
Adeline Foss. 
Special mention must be made of the 
efforts of Air Force Capt. Gerald Bel-
anger and his helicopter crew, which 
completed the rescue. Describing the 
work of these men, the captain of the 
Oduna said: 
What he did is beyond words. We owe a 
great deal to him. 
And finally, words of praise., and 
thanks should go to all the units, mili-
tary and civilian, which were alerted 
and ready to take part in the rescue op-
erations if needed. 
Madam President, the story of the 
rescue of the crew of the Oduna indeed 
belongs among the great stories about 
those who go down to the sea in ships. 
EXHIBIT 1 
REPORT ON THE SS "OntiNA" 
The tragic ending of this voyage of SS 
Oduna under the sheer 700-foot cliffs of 
Ikatan Peninsula, Alaska, can only be 
tempered by the successful rescue of all 37 
crewmen aboard in spite of battering seas 
and 50-knot wind conditions. 
At 0655 November 26 we were notified of 
the Oduna's distress by Capt. R. E. Emerson, 
commanding officer, U.S. Coast Guard Air 
Station, Kodiak, with the terse information 
that she was aground, breaking up, end 
safety of the crew was deemed to be in ex-
treme danger. Our office staff was alerted 
and reported for duty immediately. The 
facilities of Alaska Communication System 
were also notified and placed in full emer-
gency status by their Kodiak commanding 
officer, M. Sgt. Gordon Wells, which subse-
quently contributed immeasurab:y to the 
successful communications network for the 
ensuing rescue operations. 
On my arrival at the Kodiak Coast Guard 
Rescue Center at 0735, it was learned that 
the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Storis and one 
of their Albatross aircraft, both based at 
Kodiak, were already en route to the scene, 
and intense operations were in progress for 
the dispatch of other vessels and aircraft. 
Kodiak Rescue Center was in full charge of 
all rescue operations, and the facilities of 
related commands in the Alaska Sea Frontier 
and on the Mainland were made available as 
required. The nearest suitable helicopter was 
dispatched from the Air Force at King Sal-
mon. The Air Force also supplied a C -130 
transport aircraft from Elmendorf to move 
a detachment of Army mountain troops 
from Fort Richardson which were deemed 
necessary in the event it became appropriate 
to perform a rescue from the beach cliff 
area. Another U.S. Coast Guard Albetross 
was dispatched from Kodiak with additional 
equipment and personnel, including Lt. 
Comdr. John Hancock, U.S. Coast Guard, 
who was directed to assume mission com-
mand of all rescue forces on arrival at Cold 
Bay. 
Commercial marine units also responded 
to the distress call. The nearby tug Adeline 
Foss quickly anchored her tow in a cove near 
the area and proceeded to Oduna. A Japa-
nese vessel also responded, Taiyo Sari; No. 
82, and permission was obtained from the 
Navy to place a Japanese landing party on 
the beach should it be necessary before ar-
rival of the Army mountain troops. The 
fisheries research vessel Reed, and U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife vessel U.S.S. Pribiloff, operating 
in the Dutch Harbor area, were also dis-
patched to the scene. 
By 0900 rescue operations had assumed 
massive proportions. Weather conditions at 
the scene did not abate, and were reported 
to worsen. A Reeve Aleutian Airways Goose, 
based at Cold Bay, managed a hazardous 
flight to position of Oduna, and resulting 
reports were indeed grim. Seas were break-
ing over the stranded vessel, and 50- ti 60-
knot wind conditions prevailed. 
We waited for arrival of rescue unit. By 
1100 both the Adeline Foss and the Japanese 
vessel reported any attempted approach to 
Oduna was impossible by sea. Rocks off-
shore and on both sides of the stranded ves-
sel prevented any close approach, as well as 
any launching of the Oduna's lifeboats. 
The first Albatross from Kodiak arrived 
at the scene at 1145 and the helicopter from

THE NEW YORK Tpirda_AN JAMES 
RESTON ON THVIETNAM AR 
Mr. 1VIeGOVERN. Madam President, 
some of the most perceptive writing on 
the Vietnam war has been done by the 
editorial staff of the New York Times 
and its distinguished columnist, Mr. 
James Reston. 
I ask unanimous consent that two im-
portant editorials published in the Times 
of January 21 and 23, together with 
columns by Mr. Reston of the same dates, 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Jan. 23, 19661 
TALKS WITH THE VIETCONG 
Secretary General Thant's formula for an 
interim broadening of the Saigon govern-
ment, to "take over the responsibility" of 
organizing self-determination in South Viet-
fain after the war, points to the heart of the 
problem of achieving a peaceful settlement. 
Despite Secretary Rusk's negative reaction to 
U Thant's suggestion and his almost exclu-
sive emphasis on Hanoi, somehow a way must 
be found to get talks going between the 
South Vietnamese factions that are doing the 
bulk of the fighting on the ground. 
President Johnson's plan for free elections, 
after a cease-fire, is Itself a means of achiev-
ing a representative administration in Saigon 
prior to American withdrawal. In a recent 
statement by Ambassador Bohlen, the United 
States has indicated that it would accept the 
results of such an election even if it returned 
a dominant Communist faction. But the 
real isSue is how the elections are to be 
organized. 
Essentially, this is a question of the kind 
of interim government that will preside over 
the country, under international supervision, 
during the electoral campaign. The electoral 
campaign itself can only follow a cease-fire. 
But a cease-fire is likely to be achieved only 
after an agreement on the makeup of an 
interim government. 
Proposals often have been made?inchid-
ing one by the United Nations?Secretariat 
after the fall of Diem in 1963?that neu-
tralist South Vietnamese leaders resident in 
Paris be brought home to form a new gov-
ernment and mediate between the warring 
factions. Talks between the generals ruling 
in Saigon and the Vietcong leadership?
either directly or through intermediaries 
initially?would be another possible ap-
proach. There have been hints that the 
Vietcong would welcome the independence 
from Hanoi that such contacts might 
encourage. 
The intransigent attitude of Air Vice 
Marshal Ky, the present Saigon Premier, does 
not necessarily rule out such talks. There 
have been repeated rumors in the past of 
contacts with the Vietcong on the part of 
South Vietnamese officers, Buddhist leaders, 
businessmen, and intellectuals. There would 
be little difficulty in finding intermediaries 
if the United States were prepared to en-
courage such exchanges. The aim of such 
talks could be to form either a neutral ad-
ministration or a coalition in which the 
South Vietnamese Army, the Vietcong, the 
15 Hansard, Parliament History of Eng-
land 1307 (1753-1765). 
Buddhists, the Catholics, the Cao Dai, and 
other political elements would participate. 
The attraction of such an approach has 
been increased by the numerous setbacks 
Communist China has suffered during the 
past year in projecting its influence beyond 
its borders from Indochina to Africa. Most 
of its programs of expansion or subversion 
have either failed or have been deflated. 
The result, as Times Correspondent 
Seymour Topping reported the other day, has 
been to create an opportunity for the United 
States to deal with the war in Vietnam no 
longer on the basis of determining "the form 
or ideology of the Vietnamese nation, but the 
reestablishment in southeast Asia of peace, 
order and respect for borders." A Vietnam, 
independent from China, that respected the 
borders of its neighbors would be a Viet-
nam contained?and separated from the rest 
of southeast Asia by the neutral buffer states 
of Laos and Cambodia. 
The most orderly way to deal with the 
whole problem would be another Geneva 
conference similar to that on Laos in 1962. 
That conference brought together the five 
great powers, the Indochina states and fac-
tions, the neighboring nations of southeast 
Asia and the countries which comprise the 
International Control Commission, India, 
Poland and Canada. The best method to 
clear the way for such a conference might 
well be a beginning of efforts to broaden the 
Saigon Government?a move that might als6 
stimulate Hanoi's interest in getting into 
the negotiating act. 
iFrom the New York Times, Jan. 21, 1966] 
THE VIETNAM DECISION 
Failure of the Johnson peace offensive thus 
far to bring about formal negotiations with 
Hanoi inescapably raises the question: what 
course should the United States now follow? 
Much depends on Washington's evaluation 
of Hanoi's ambiguous public and private 
replies and on the official estimate of how 
long it is safe to keep the bombers grounded. 
Is Hanoi holding out for concessions? Or 
is Hanoi seeking to avoid a conference out 
of the conviction that the United States 
will get tired and withdraw? President 
Johnson expressed the latter belief yester-
day. But his conclusion from this remains 
unclear, since he also said: "The door of 
peace must be kept wide open." 
Many factors counsel patience. The 2-
month absence of North Vietnamese Army 
units from combat in South Vietnam?which 
may signal a Hanoi desire to continue the 
diplomatic exchanges?is one such factor. 
Far more important is the fact that the mili-
tary balance in South Vietnam has been 
fundamentally transformed in the past year. 
The decisive new element has been the 
ninefold build-up of American troops in 
South Vietnam to a strength of about 190,-
000. South Vietnamese armed forces, in-
cluding militia and police, now exceed 
635,000. With South Korean, New Zealand, 
and Australian units, there are upward of 
850,000 men in the field. And the backing of 
American air and naval strength gives these 
forces devastating firepower and unparalleled 
mobility. 
This buildup, in the words of President 
Johnson's state of the Union message, has 
put the enemy on notice that time is no 
longer on his side and that a Vietcong vic-
tory now is out of reach. 
Meanwhile, It has become evident that the 
bombing of North Vietnam failed to achieve 
either of its original two objectives. It 
failed to slow down the infiltration of men 
and supplies, which increased as the bomb-
ing intensified. And it failed to bring Hanoi 
to the conference table. The bombing did 
force North Vietnam to turn from Peiping to 
Moscow for antiaircraft missiles and, even 
more important, for massive economic and 
technical aid. But this unexpected dividend 
January 24, 1966 
argues for a continued suspension of the 
bombing, rather than for its resumption. 
As White House security adviser McGeorge 
Bundy recently observed: "It has been made 
clear to us over a long period of time that 
the Soviet Government hopes there can be 
a peaceful settlement." And Moscow has 
also made it clear that peace efforts cannot 
be carried on while North Vietnam is being 
bombed. 
The critical decision that confronts Presi-
dent Johnson, therefore, is not whether to 
resume the early bombing of the North?
which even Republican leaders no longer 
press--but how to conduct the war in the 
South while continuing the probes for peace. 
The ground and air war in South Vietnam 
undoubtedly will resume fully after the 
Lunar New Year truce. What the President 
now must decide is whether to escalate that 
war in the south to a wholly new level by 
yielding to military requests for a doubling 
of American forces. Such a move would 
finally convert the struggle from a Vietnam-
ese conflict into an American war against 
Asians. 
A further large-scale buildup would not 
end the military stalemate in South Viet-
nam. As in the past, it would be matched 
by increased Vietcong recruiting, infiltra-
tion of additional North Vietnamese units 
and ultimately?if the ground war expanded 
into Laos, Cambodia and, perhaps, North 
Vietnam?by the entrance of Chinese troops 
into the conflict. 
At present, American forces are secure in 
their coastal positions and cannot be invol-
untarily dislodged. General Gavin's recent 
advice, not to expand the war but to continue 
efforts to negotiate the peace, has the force 
of logic on its side.

WASHINGTON: WHAT GREAT DEBATE? 
(By James Reston) 
WASHINGTON, January 20.?The process of 
debate in Washington, even on so solemn a 
business as risking war with a quarter of the 
human race, is an astonishing and depress-
ing business. 
No capital ever talked so much about 
"great debates" or had so few of them. The 
Senate has not been performing its consti-
tutional function of "advise and consent" on 
the critical issues of foreign affairs during 
the pause in the war. It has been tugging 
and hauling on the President in a series of 
disjointed and unconnected statements, 
speeches, and television remarks, most of 
them made outside the Senate Chamber. 
The opposition party did not launch a de-
bate on the President's state of the Union 
message. It put on a television show featur-
ing Senator Dunce= and Representative 
Form in a recitation which differed wildly 
from most of the things they have said about 
the war in the past. 
CHAOS IN THE CORRIDORS 
Secretary of Defense McNamara went be-
fore the Senate Armed Vervices Committee 
today and when he and the Senators emerged 
from the privacy of the commitee chamber 
the scene was about as orderly as the end of 
a professional football game. 
Senator RICHARD RUSSELL of Georgia told 
the crowding reporters that the general tone 
of McNamara's private reniarks was that time 
was running out on the peace offensive. 
"Never even mentioned it," the Secretary said , 
later. 
No doubt the discussion inside the com-
mittee room was better, but ever since the 
start of the peace offensive the public state-
ments have been a babble of disconnected 
shouts. One day a general comes back from 
Vietnam and calls for a resumption of the 
bombing in North Vietnam. The next a 
Senator offers his opinion that escalating the 
war now would be sheer madness.

While the officials of most departments 
have ultimately extended cooperation and 
pledges to remedy existing situations, no 
stah action has been taken by the FDA offi-
cials. No new regulations or controls, or 
even investigations, have occurred. However, 
this situation may be improved by new legis-
lation currently under study that would 
make the FDA a nun timembered commission 
with definite time limitations on tenure and 
tne imposition of other restrictions on the 
cemmission members. In this way new

troduced to aid the fair, efficient, and 
effective administration of the drug laws. 
The very compilation of the record of the 
hearings is valuable. ft documents the dan-
gers inherent when the bureaucrats become 
too impervious and too insulated from crit-
clan or challenge Violation of laws, in-
midation, and harrassment have been 
proven. Disregard and ignorance of consti-
ea Lionel rights have been brought before the 
public and Congrees. All of this will set the 
basis for future comprehensive legislation. 
The Commissioner of the IRS has pledged 
that he will conduct his own investigation 
and report fully to the public and Congress. 
Already, new orders have been issued that 
will aid in controlling the overzealousness of 
his agents.. 
On July 15, 1915, the President publicly 
reaffirmed his ban in wiretapping and praised 
the efforts of the subcommittee as in the 
public interest. 
With this record of achievement, the fu-
ture should promise that more definite steps 
will be more easily taken to get to the heart 
of the problem 0S protecting privacy. 
Legislai.iea and review 
The intention of the subcommittee is to 
continue the investigation until a complete 
picture is developed. This may Lake some 
time. However, the record is sufficient to 
give some general direction that future legis-
lation should follow. 
Initially, a comprehensive code regulating 
investigative techniques involving invasions 
of privacy presents a feasible means to 
remedy the existing violations and guard 
against future infringements. This code 
would attempt a broad definition of the 
right to privacy and the policy of Congress 
that such a right should be fully protected. 
Wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping 
could either be banned outright or limited 
to specific urgent needs such as national 
defense, natimed security, or the investiga-
tion of major crimesac Criminal and civil 
penalties would be imposed for violation of 
these rights. In addition the code would 
protect against intimidation or harassment 
by Federal agen,s. 
Presently, there exist criminal statutes out-
lawing deliberate violations of certain con-

Legislation to a similar effect was pro-
posed by the then Attorney General Robert 
Kennedy. It was subjected to compre-
hensive analysis. Hearings on wiretapping,

these have been either ignored or only par-
tially enforced. There is need for expansion 
and effective enforcement of these laws. 
Further possible legislation which count 
be considered separately by Congress or in - 
corperated into the code would set forth a 
code of conduct for Federal agents, with ap-
propriate penalties for its violation. In ae-
dition specific requirements as to the educa-
tion Of agents in the constitutional rights 
of citizens could be provided. 
It is believed that while most agents hate 
had the legal principles pertaining to sears e 
and seizure made available to them, this 
isolated, microscopic information is inade-
quate.. Further and more comprehensive ed-
ucation is needed in the purpose and mean-
tog, not only of the fourth amendment, bat 
of the entire Bill of Rights. 
Agents should be instructed that their pri-
mary responsibility is to prevent crimes and 
violations of law, not solely to convict people. 
This conviction psychology is imbued into 
the agent from his first association with an 
egency and ingrained while he remains there. 
All too often this conviction syndrome is 
generated by the publication of statistics 
aimed at proving the dedication and neces-
sity of the agency. In short, compilation of 
self-serving statistics goads agents into all 
sort; of indiscretions. It remakes a protector 
of society into a menace to liberty, a law en-
forcement officer into a potential violator of 
the law himself. 
More civilized standards than the number 
of convictions should not be impalatable to 
Congress or to the people. Rather than 
branding law enforcement as lax when the 
conviction rate falls, we should study the 
overall reduced rate of crime. Putting peo-
ple behind bars by illegal or questionable 
methods is no deterrent to crime; indeed, 
it acts only as a spur to competition in 
criminal acts. 
The increasing difficulties of law enferce-
mcnt, while partially due to lack of man-
power, lukewarm citizen support, low sa-
laries, etc., are attributable to a more deep-
seated dilemma. Basically, law enforcement 
officers are confused as to what is or is not 
within the permissible scope of their duties. 
The IRS agents on the one hand were Issued 
a directive by the Treasury Department, 
which was in existence since 1938, that com-
pletely banned wiretaps. On the other 
the national office of IRS conducted a wire-
tap and snooping school, and furnished the 
equipment and experts to place the taps. 
lettle wonder agents winked at the ban 
against wiretaps. Little wonder they had 
no fear of prosecution or other disciplinary 
action being taken against them. Setting 
forth specific guidelines in this code of con-
duct, plus education and the impositlon of 
appropriate sanctions for its violation ehould 
alleviate the confusion of federal :gents 
caused by such double standards. 
Two major salutary effects could come 
from this legislation. One, the right of pri-
vacy will be given public recognition as the 
constitutional and basic human right that 
it is. Two, the professionalism, efficiency, ef-
fectiveness, and dignity of the Federal agent 
can be jud.ged, assessed, and determined by 
his compliance or lack of compliance with 
the codeSe

" A cleaning house for complaints against 
tactics of Federal agents could possibly be 
established. The recently created adminis-
trative conference may be of aid here. Its 
major advantage is that it would be inde-
pendent of the agency It was investigating 
These hearings have also pinpointed the 
need for further investigation into subjects 
tangentially related to invasions of pri-
vacy. The legal process of libel of informa-
tion should be reviewed. This process exists 
as an anachronism in the law and permits 
the skirting of protections in certain cases 
afforded by a fourth amendment search war-
rant. 
The summons powers and jeopardy assess-
?ment powers of the IRS should be reviewed 
with a view toward limiting their use and 
providing seta guards against abuse. 
On an overall scale, Congress should be 
more wary of granting too much power to 
agencies. Indiscriminate grants have led I:, 
abuse and a lessening of congressional 
powers of coatrol. It is hoped that from 
this point on, when Congress delegates its 
powers it will provide safeguards against 
abuse and retain some supervisory control 
over its delegates. 
Congress should take more of an interest 
In how its laws are administered. No law is 
very effective or promotes social development 
unless it is properly administered. Laws 
today are being misconstrued, misread, or ig-
nored by sonic of their administrators. It is 
Congress who represents the people; Con-
gress must answer to the people. Delegating 
powers to bureaucrats who often answer to 
no one is not responsible representation of 
the people. If vigilance be the price of 
liberty, that price has to be paid by the Con-
gress as well as by the people. Today we 
seem to be experiencing a vital lack of vigi-
lance when Law enforcement officials disobey 
the law and Congress allows liberty to be 
lessened by administrative flat. 
CONCLUSIONS 
If the privacy so necessary to the develop-
ment of a free and independent people is to 
be preserved, our national lethargy and lack 
of knowledge must be countered. These 
hearings and the legislation that can be cre-
ated pursuant to them are steps in the right 
direction. But more is demanded; more is 
needed before we as a nation can reach a 
plateau of civilized existence above that on 
which we now abide. Citizen concern and 
assistance is vitally needed at this time to 
foster and nurture the neophyte strides 
made to protect our privacy and our heritage. 
Without them, this country is threatened 
with degradation into a comatose state of 
dependence and conformity. Encroach-
ments on freedom begin on a small insidious 
scale. Mr. Justice Frankfurter saw this dan-
ger as exemplified by police excess in the 
name of law enforcement and his keen per-
ception pinpointed the aspects of that 
danger: "[We are in danger of forgetting 
that the Bill of Rights reflects experience 
with police excesses. It is not only under 
Nazi rule that police excesses are inimical 
to freedom. It is easy to make light of 
insistence on scrupulous regard for the safe-
guards of civil liberties when invoked on 
behalf of the unworthy. It is too easy. His-
tory bears testimony that by such disregard 
are the rights of liberty extinguished, heed-
lessly at first, then stealthily, and brazenly 
In the end." . 
Would not all Americans feel mere secure 
and justly proud of their democracy if the 
following were to become reality and no sim-
ple aphorism: "The poorest man may in his 
and answerable to the President through its 
chairman. In 1952 the IRS set up its In-
spection Division to check the integrity of its 
employees. The fact that no instances of 
wiretap were discovered or reported since its 
Inspection is indicative of the ineffectiveness 
of a program to police police by police.

January 24, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 941 
Yet there was no reason why the two 
Houses of Congress could not have taken a 
week for a serious discussion of the Presi-
dent's state of the Union message. It was at 
least a clear picture of a perplexed man. It 
defined the dilemmas if not their solutions. 
In any other democratic country the par-
liament would have regarded such a mes-
sage at such a time by the head of the gov-
ernment as an invitation to a debate. The 
leader of the opposition in both houses 
would have replied at length, defined the 
areas of agreement and disagreement. Ex-
perts on both sides of the aisle would have 
talked on the aspects of the message they 
know best. And at the end of the debate, 
the leaders of the majority party would have 
tried to answer the questions raised. 
THE MYSTIFYING CLARIFICATIONS 
Such a procedure not only clarifies the 
feeling of a democratic Congress, but is 
often useful to the Government executives 
who finally have to make the decisions. But 
no such orderly clarifying procedure has 
been followed here. 
It may be objected that a public debate 
in the midst of the peace offensive would 
dramatize the divisions in the country on 
Vietnam?they are being dramatized any-
way?but there is no reason why the Gov-
ernment, if it fears this result, cannot debate 
the issue in private. This was done during 
the last war, and while there were the in-
evitable leaks, these slid little damage. 
The present situation is remarkable in a 
number of other ways. President Woodrow 
Wilson died believing that the power of the 
Senate was so great in the field of foreign 
affairs that it could virtually paralyze the 
President, but today the President alone can 
decide whether to renew the bombing or ex-
tend the pause, to raise or lower the level 
of violence on the allied side, to bomb Hanoi 
and mine the harbor of Haiphong or leave 
them alone, to attack the Soviet ships car-
rying supplies to the North Vietnamese or 
ignore them, without even listening to the 
Senate. 
TIIE CHINA QUESTION 
There has been no real debate on the 
China question, which lies behind the whole 
war. It is not even clear whether the North 
Vietnamese and the Vietcong have increased 
the number of attacks on our positions since 
the start of the peace offensive, for the Pen-
tagon has testified that the attacks have 
increased and the President has said they 
have decreased. 
If the purpose of all this is to confuse the 
enemy, it must be a success?for the so-
called debate is certainly confusing every-
body else. The American people are enti-
tled at such a time to a candid and search-
ing discussion of the issues in the Congress 
assembled, but this is precisely the one 
thing they have not had. 
[From the New York Times, Jan. 23, 1966.] 
WASHINGTON: THE MIND OF ASIA 
(By James Reston) 
WASHINGTON, January 22.?The mind of 
Asia, in all its different manifestations, is a 
constant puzzle to our policymakers in Wash-
ington. 
The Vietcong are not intimidated by our 
superior firepower and airpower: They just 
keep on coming. The people in the South 
Vietnamese villages seem to resent the bomb-
ing of their dead more than the bombing of 
the living. The brutality of the Vietnamese 
to their fellow countrymen they capture is 
almost beyond our comprehension. 
THE INDONESIAN MASSACRE 
Seldom a week passes now without some 
startling illustration of the point. Not so 
long ago, the Communists in Indonesia were 
demonstrating against the United States, ap-
parently with the approval of the Sukarno 
government and the Indonesion people. 
Then came the brutal murder of five leading 
Indonesian generals and a vicious counter-
attack against the Communists. 
Since then, over 100,000, not 1 but 100,000 
people, have been murdered in Indonesia, 
not in bombings but in savage manhunts. 
Even Sukarno concedes that 87,000 people 
have disappeared in this barbaric slaughter, 
and the intelligence services here put the 
total at nearer 130,000. 
Understanding the European mind in the 
past 30 years has been hard enough for offi-
cials in Washington, but Asia is something 
quite different. The North Vietnamese do 
not react to our peace offensive as we 
thought they might. The South Vietnamese 
have been very quiet about it, not because 
they approved, but because, knowing their 
countrymen, they didn't think it would 
succeed. 
Yet the same officials who have constantly 
been surpriSed by developments in Asia since 
the war, who were wrong in their calcula-
tions on the North Vietnamese bombing, 
wrong in their estimates of the effect of the 
American military buildup, wrong on a 
Whole succession of Saigon Governments, 
and wrong on the effects of our successful 
monsoon campaign?these same officials are 
now being quite dogmatic again about 
China. 
RUSK'S PARALLELS 
Secretary of State Rusk is constantly 
drawing the parallel between the Nazi ag-
gression in Europe and the Chinese aggres-
sion in Asia. His proposition is perfectly 
plain: China is the enemy. China must be 
stopped in this early phase of its aggressive 
expansion, just as the Nazis should have been 
stopped in the 1930's, and as the Soviets were 
stopped in Greece and Turkey, Persia and 
Berlin, after the last war. 
He may be right, but then again he may 
not. The Secretary General of the United 
Nations, U Thant, who is Burmese and pre-
sumably knows as much about Asia as Lyn-
don Johnson, sees China today not as a 
rogue elephant but as a nervous wreck. 
Prime Minister Sato of Japan thinks China 
is primarily concerned about her problems of 
production at home, and is using the war as 
a threat of foreign invasion to get more work 
out of the poor Chinese people. 
DIFFERING VIEWS 
When a country has been treated as an 
outcast, an outlaw, and a culprit, said the 
Secretary General, referring to China, "it is 
apt to act in a certain way * * *. In such a 
delicate stage, countries will sometimes show 
certain emotions, certain strong reactions, 
certain rigidities, and even a certain 
arrogance * * *." 
These two views of China are not neces-
sarily contradictory. If countries, like indi-
-viduals, can have "nervous breakdowns,' 
as U Thant suggests, they can also be danger-
ous, as Secretary Rusk assumes, but surely 
there is room here for more modest analysis 
of China, lest we commit more and more 
power to more and more false assumptions. 
TIME TO THINK 
The Communists may or may not need 
more time to think anew about the future 
course of the war and bring up supplies for 
the purpose, but the Johnson administration 
could certainly use more time. It is not 
agreed about how to proceed. It has not yet 
solved its supply problems in Vietnam, and 
It is not yet clear about the extent of the 
China menace or who is going to help con-
tain China if it does go mad. 
What, then, is the hurry? There is no 
danger that the American command can be 
overcome. We are constantly patrolling the 
enemy supply lines and will know in advance 
if any concentration of force is being gath-
ered. And there's nothing in the situation 
other than past tradition that forces us to 
act before we take time to think. 
MY SCOUTING PAST, YOUR SCOUT-
ING FUTURE: BY VICE PRESIDENT 
HUBERT H. HUMPHREY 
Mr. McGOVERN. Madam President, 
of all the many fine organizations in our 
country which help to build youngsters' 
lives, few are more important, more con-
structive or more inspiring than the Boy 
Scouts of America. America is truly in-
debted to over a million adult leaders 
who serve the Boy Scouts in individual 
troops, in headquarters and in other ca-
pacities. 
Many of our outstanding leaders in 
public and private life have had the 
happy privilege of serving as scoutmas-
ters. One of the finest descriptions of 
the joys and opportunities of scoutmas-
ter has been given by Vice President Hu-
BERT H. HUMPHREy. 
In the January 1966 isue of the maga-
zine, Scouting, he gives recollections of 
his days as a scoutmaster in South Da-
kota in the 1930's. And he summarizes 
the significance of today's and tomor-
row's Scout work. "My Scouting Past, 
Your Scouting Future" is his theme. 
I believe that his article will be of in-
terest not only to all those who have 
worked with the Boy Scouts, but to many 
other thinking citizens as well. 
I ask unanimous consent that the Vice 
President's article be printed in the REC-
ORD at this point. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
MY SCOUTING PAST, YOUR SCOUTING FUTURE 
(By HUBERT H. IITJMPHREY) 
Scouting is a joy?and a challenge. It is 
fun and fellowship, adventure and achieve-
ment, honor and patriotism. 
That's how I felt when I was a Scout in 
Reverend Ilartt's troop 24 back in the little 
town of Doland, S. Dak., and that's how I 
remember my later years as a scoutmaster of 
troop 6 in Huron, S. Dak. And that's how 
I feel about scouting today. 
My visit last spring to the national head-
quarters of the Boy Scouts of America 
brought back many fond memories. There 
was a large picture of Scoutmaster HUM-
PHREY and seven of his Scouts, and there 
were momentoes of all the early B.S.A. 
heroes?men like Beard, Seton, West, and 
Baden-Powell. 
Then there were all those wonderful Nor-
man Rockwell paintings that so accurately 
depict the adventure and the integrity of the 
scouting program. And there was a photo-
graph of our first national jamboree that 
made me recall that in 1935 I was all set to 
attend that remarkable gathering of youth 
in Washington, D.C., when a national polio 
epidemic forced its postponement until 1937. 
Appropriately enough, Mrs. Humphrey 
shared my visit to your national headquar-
ters, just as she had shared so many of my 
days as scoutmaster. Mrs. Humphrey?
Muriel?always enjoyed the outdoors and the 
company of Scouts. She called them young 
Indians. 
An honor guard of uniformed Cub Scouts, 
Boy Scouts, and Explorers greeted us at na-

sortment of blue and gold, khaki, and green 
differed from my crop of boys in troop 6 
back in Huron. 
In those days our people were pretty down 
on their luck from dust storms and the de-
pression. We had a rule that no one could 
have a new uniform, because we didn't want 
any boy to feel inadequate or inferior. So

tried to outfit each boy from the hand-me-
downs of older brothers. We made our 
camping equipment, too?at least some of it. 
Old troop 6 was versatile when it came to 
meetings. We didn't even start out as a 
church basement operation?the church 
budget, like everything else, was the victim 
of the depression and, therefore, too skimpy 
to allow for heating the basement. 
We were sponsored by the Good Fellow-
ship Class of the Methodist Church and my 
first meeting was held in the church's vesti-
bule during a dust storm. Later on we met 
outside the church, in the basement of Hum-
phrey's Drugstore, in my living room, and, on 
occasion, even. in Muriel's living room. 
Those were difficult and trying days. 
Money was scarce and church funds were 
even less available. But we finally did get 
beat for that church basement, even though 
it took a small conspiracy and a well-kept 
eecret. 
We announced a big troop bean feed and 
promoted it all over town. A real crowd 
turned out and shivered through the meal. 
We had, on purpose, negelcted to warn the 
folks that the basement wasn't heated. 
After that bean feed, the church officials 
managed to have it heated for us. 
That was in 1933. I served as scoutmas-
ter for about 3 years. During that eventful 
Lime we took into our troop a few boys who 
today might be labeled juvenile trouble-
makers. In fact, some of them had been 
in a little trouble, but they were not bad 
boys. They simply needed guidance, activ-
ity, and work. And the Boy Scout troop of-
fered these opportunities. 
Working with the troop committee we 
found jobs for our boys. I hired two of 
them to work in the family drugstore and 
put them on their honor to do well and to 
keep out of trouble. Given a chance, they 
came through with Hying colors. 
Those were days when we took a firmer 
stand with our young people. I had an 
understanding with my Scouts that we 
weren't going to have any smoking. So, 
when. I caught several of the boys red-
handed. I told them, "You're through?beat 
it." 
They were the most unhappy boys in the 
world and they started coming around my 
home every morning. Finally they got up 
enough courage to apoolgize and we took 
them all back into the troop?provided 
they abided by the rules. 
Starting in 1935 I was a pretty busy per-
son, what with my Scout meeting on Tues-
day nights and courting Muriel on 
Thursday nights. Muriel was always a sort 
of assistant scoutmaster. Even in those early 
days before we were married she encouraged 
me to carry on my Scout work?apparently 
she was already learning to cooperate with 
the inevitable. 
i[his was when Muriel earned the "fastest 
and best hamburger maker in South Da-
kota"?and those Scouts would eat them as 
fast as the could make them. They always 
Preferred her cooking to mine, and no won-
der. 
Once on an overnight hike I decided to 
Show the boys what a great cook I was. I 
prepared for them a simple desert?a sort of 
pudding of rice and raisins. I recall drop-
ping a rather large portion of rice into a 
kettle of boiling water. The rice kept ex-
striding. We wound up filling about every 
container in the camp with rice pudding. 
from that point on the Scouts of Troop 6 
resolved to do their own cooking and leave 
their scoutmaster to other chores. 
Sometimes I was 'worried about the qual-
ity of discipline in our troop. After all, 
eager, spirited young men are not easy to 
order about. But when the occasion re-
quired it, we would have good discipline. 
There was no need to be authoritarian or 
hard-fisted. Our discipline was based upofl 
fellowship, friendship, and a sense of pride 
In the achievements of troop 6. 
When I wanted the boys to do something 
they did it because they knew I wanted it 
done. It reflected upon the record of our 
troop. I always was able to be "one of the 
gang" without losing their respect. We 
worked together, played together, and 
camped together. 
I did my Scouting work right with the 
boys, starting as a Second Class Scout. I 
went on to Life Scout. Unfortunately, I 
didn't have the opportunity to finish my 
work as an Eagle Scout. But we Lad six 
Eagles in Troop 6 and that was good f r those 
days. 
Our town was Scout-minded; and with our 
little population, we had no less than six 
active troops. We had our own Scout-
master's roundtable in Huron?all the Scout-
masters in town met once a week it noon. 
We developed great fellowship that way and 
great competition between troops. 
By 1936 my future was taking a new turn. 
Muriel and I had decided to marry and to 
return to the University of Minnesota to 
complete my education which had been in-
terrupted by the depression. 
The move to Minnesota meant the end of 
my Scoutmaster days. On Scout Sunday 
during Boy Scout Week, I "preached" the 
sermon at the Methodist Church, then made 
my resignation official by presenting my 
khaki shirt to my good friend and fellow 
Scouter, the late Dewey Van Dyke. 
As a Scoutmaster I was a novice and an 
apprentice. The SUCCESS of Troop 6 was due 
in large measure to the man who served for 
some ti:me as my assistant, Dewey Van Dyke, 
and to another outstanding church roan and 
youth leader, Lynn LaCraft. It was Dewey 
and I.ynn above all who gave stability, con-
tinuity, and leadership to Scouting in our 
community. 
Dewey Van Dyke was full of stories of his 
youth and his experiences in World War I. 
He was a natural camper, loving the out of 
doors. He was the kind of man that boys 
respected. While short in stature, he was 
athletic, competitive, rugged, and a down-to-
earth fellow. The boys loved him. 
Dewey's only son, Bobby, was a member of 
Troop 6. He was an excellent Scout and he 
and his -dad were inseparable companions. 
But early in Scouting, Bobby was to lose his 
life in a drowning accident. This was a 
tragic blow to Dewey and his wife, Hazel. 
Dewey's wife, like Muriel Humphrey. was a 
Scouter, too: her life was fully involved in 
the work of Troop 6. 
The loss of Bobby Van Dyke was a blow 
to all of us. He was such a wonderful boy. 
But this sorrow and sadness that arlie to 
the Van Dykes served as an inspirition to 
Dewey. He redoubled his efforts in Scouting. 
He and Hazel literally adopted every boy in 
the troop. Instead of having one son, the 
Van Dykes now found themselves with any-
where from ;25 to 35 boys?treating !.j.lelri all 
like their very own. Scouting to them was 
a labor of love. 
My dear friend, Lynn LaCraft, a merober of 
the troop committee, also lost his boy --a for-
mer troop member, Kendall--as a Navy pilot 
in World War If;. They were also inseparable 
companions and dear friends to me. 
Kendall was an outstanding Seout?an 
Eagle Scout. He was always the leader :in the 
troop, a brilliant young man, athletic, an 
engaging personality, courageous, and co-
operative. 
Lynn LaCraft went on as did my friend, 
Dewey Van Dyke, to become a Scout leader, 
giving unselfishly of his life to other young 
men. 
Tragedy befell two families?the V Dykes 
and the LaCrafts?but they eased their sor-
row arid pain by giving of themselves to 
others. This is what it takes to make a great 
Scout leader?giving, sharing, caring for 
others. What wonderful memories these 
names bring back, memories of friendship 
and devotion to the highest values. 
We who have served as volunteers receive 
far more from the Scouting program than we 
can possibly give it. Whatever I gave to 
Scouting was richly rewarded by the joys, 
satisfaction, and opportunities of working 
with my boys of Troop 6. 
Few experiences can compare with the rich 
pleasure of seeing boys with whom you have 
worked grow to sturdy manhood and posi-
tions of respect in community life. 
An investment in time and energy with 
youngsters reaps the greatest "dividends"?
personally, for the boys, the sponsoring in-
stitution, for town and Nation. No wonder 
Scouting has grown and will continue to 
grow. 
Best of all, it is voluntary. This volun-
tarism is a unique characteristic of American 
life?the willingness of people to give of 
themselves to help others, the sharing and 
the building together out of conviction rather 
than ordered direction. Scouting is one of 
the finest examples of America's genius to 
get things done through the citizen's own 
initiative and responsibility. And it offers 
continuing challenge to so many adults who 
feel a deep desire to keep America free and 
to preserve the spirit of personal initiative 
and self --discipline. 
Scouting is more needed today than ever 
before. Life in America has changed greatly 
in the last quarter of a century. Family 
unity is tested more than ever. People a:re 
constantly on the move and often our roots 
are not as deep as they used to be. Scouting 
unites neighbors and former strangers, welds 
communities, builds tremendous good will 
and understanding internationally. 
As a former mayor, as a U.S. Senator, and 
now, as Vice President, I have seen Scout-
ing's good works in so many ways and places. 
Today in America's war against poverty, 
Scouting is helping to bring many disadvan-
taged youngsters into a new, better life. 
Sometimes this expansion of scouting may 
not be easy, but it is in the finest Scout 
tradition. You're interested in the boy?
not his race, color, or religion. The boy's 
own growth, his work, his skill?these are 
the things that count. You want to see that 
every boy is taught respect for law and order 
and the great institutions of our country--
the family, home, church, government, in-
dustry. 
Quite appropriately this "missionary" 
challenge is part of your current break-
through for youth program, a national effort 
to make scouting even more effective and 
meaningful as it is brought within the reach 
of more and more boys. You are absolutely 
right to be doing this, because the progra:m 
Is too good to keep to ourselves. 
Also on the scouting horizon is a signifi-
cant event for all Americans--next year's 
12th World Ja:mboree in Idaho. This will be 
the first time our country has been privi-
leged to be host for this international show of 
scouting brotherhood. God willing, I hope 
to be there. 
What a joy it will be to have boys from 
all over the world in our country. 
What an opportunity it will be for them to 
see this land of ours, and how fortunate we 
will be to knc.w the future leaders of other 
nations. They will come here as youngsters, 
but in a few years they will be guiding uni-
versities, managing businesses, leading trade 
unions, or serving in positions in govern-
ment. They will be helping to build a finer, 
more peaceful world. 
In our own land, Boy Scouts and their 
leaders will play an ever-more important role 
in helping America realize its highest ideals. 
For scouting is a vital activity in a truly 
great society. In his inaugural address,

either by undue responsibility or the re-
straints of size" (p. 117). The statement 
smacks more of a somnolent old mens club 
rather than the U.S. Senate which has a 
large number of relatively young men and 
bustles with activity and overwork?even 
with the 6-year term. 
I found the chapters by Richard P. Fenno, 
Jr. ("The Internal Distribution of Influence: 
The House"), Harvey C. Mansfield ("The 
Congress and Economic Policy") and Hol-
bert N. Carroll ("The Congress and National 
Security Policy") worthwhile and provoca-
tive. I do question Professor Carroll's state-
ment concerning foreign aid authorization 
and appropriations legislation as far as the 
U.S. Senate is concerned. He notes that 
while substantial bipartisan majorities have 
supported these programs "since the mid-
1950's, however, more than half of the Demo-
crats from the South and, since the late 
1940's, some two-thirds of the Republicans 
from the Middle West have voted 'No'" 
(p. 166). The fact is that during the 8 
Eisenhower years of the 12 rollcall votes on 
final passage of either the mutual security 
authorization or appropriations bills, a ma-
jority of midwestern Republican Senators 
supported foreign aid in each of the 8 years 
except 1956. They did so often by 2 to 1 
and 3 to 2 margins. Under a Democratic 
administration the record has been no dif-
erent. In the final vote on June 14, 1965, 
on the Foreign Aid Authorizations for fiscal 
year 1966, six midwestern Republican Sen-
ators voted for the bill, only three were op-
posed. This has included the consistent 
support of Senators DiaicsEN, HICKENLOOPER, 
and MUNDT, among others. 
Dean Truman concludes in "The Prospects 
for Change" that "One thread that runs 
through all of these essays is the dispersion 
of power, in the past half century appar-
ently an increasing dispersion, within and 
between the Houses of Congress" (p. 178). 
He believes that many reforms such as sep-
arate days for committee and floor work, 
additional personal staff, home rule for the 
District of Columbia, a requirement of joint 
hearings by House and Senate committees, 
and even disclosure of assets and income by 
Members would be insubstantial in actual 
effect on Congress. Reforms which would 
further dispersion, in his judgment would 
Include some of the "democratizing ones 
such as requiring fewer signatures on" 
a discharge petition. Truman is equally un-
enthusiastic regarding the introduction of 
electronic voting equipment and other time-
savers. He believes this "would strengthen 
minbrity control by facilitating snap votes" 
(p. 180). 
Truman views as most promising those 
measures which would increase leadership 
control not only over the floor, but also over 
the committee timetable. He agrees with 
Huntington as to the need for the Speaker 
or the Senate majority leader to select com-
mittee chairmen or at least to have the ma-
jority caucus choose a chairman from among 
the tap three on each committee provided 
the leadership "were able and willing to 
make their preferences prevail" (p. 181). 
Otherwise the result, Truman thinks, would 
be a further dispersion of power. 
Truman notes the various outside devel-
opments which have contributed to congres-
sional cohesion (an executive budget and 
legislative program, White House legislative 
liaison, and regular Presidential consulta-
tion with his own congressional leaders). 
But he longs for the suggestion made by 
Huntington and others that there be a con-
gressional commitment to bring to a vote 
top priority legislation from the administra-
tion. One recalls Senator Taft, and the at-
tempt to draft striking railroad workers 
under another Truman?President Harry S. 
Truman?and is perhaps as glad that we lack 
such an urgency procedure. 
I do think Dean Truman is profoundly 
correct in concluding that "The Congress 
and. its power structure cannot profitably be 
viewed as something separate and isolable 
from the remainder of the Government and 
society. They affect and are affected by 
needs and changes in the society and in the 
Government as a whole. They must, there-
fore, be looked at within this context" (p. 
183). 
That is why I am optimistic regarding 
reform. Reform has come in Congress and 
between Congress and the Executive over the 
years. Reform will continue to come. Per-
haps it will not come as rapidly as some of 
us would like. Perhaps it will come more 
rapidly than some of our colleagues prefer. 
But it is coming and will come, and in the 
process it has been aided by the thoughtful 
presentations such as "The Congress and 
America's Future," which have stimulated 
thought not only in various regional meet-
ings of the American assembly throughout 
America but also in Congress and among the 
interested public generally. 
UNAUTHORIZED VISIT TO NORTH 
VLETNAM gY THREE AMERICANS 
Mr. LAUSCHE. Madam President, 
according to an article carried in the 
Cleveland Plain Dealer on January 20, 
1966, the President of Yale University, 
Kingman Brewster, Jr., made a state-
ment pertaining to the visit of Prof. 
Staughton Lynd to Hanoi. 
Prof. Staughton Lynd, together with 
Communist Historian Herbert Aptheker, 
and Thomas Hayden, founder of the 
Students for a Democratic Society, sev-
eral weeks ago obtained permission to 
visit Brussels, Belgium. When they got 
to Brussels they took a Communist plane 
provided by the Communists that carried 
them to Prague, Moscow, Peiping, and 
finally to Hanoi. 
In Hanoi they met with the Commu-
nist leader. Out of Hanoi Professor Lynd, 
of Yale University, sent a telegram to 
the chairman of the Committee on For-
eign Relations asking for the right to 
appear before that committee and give 
testimony. 
I am quite certain that the Committee 
on Foreign Relations will not honor 
Aptheker, the practical leader of the 
Communists in the United States, nor 
Professor Lynd, nor Hayden, by allowing 
them to appear before that committee. 
However, It is rather refreshing to 
note that President Kingman Brewster, 
Jr., of Yale University, had the courage 
and the recognition of civil responsibil-
ity to speak up in regard to Professor 
Lynd. 
Professor Lynd teaches at Yale. I 
now wish to quote from an Associated 
Press dispatch from New Haven, Conn.: 
Yale University President Kingman Brew-
ster, Jr., said yesterday that Staughton Lynd 
was "naive and misguided" in making an 
unauthorized trip to North Vietnam. 
He had stronger words about the assistant 
history professor's speech in Hanoi, saying 
that it was "a disservice to the causes of 
freedom of dissent, freedom of travel, and 
conscientious pacifism." 
In addition, President Brewster said 
he felt that Lynd's "disparagement of 
his country's leadership and policies, 
while in Hanoi, damaged the causes he 
purports to serve." 
President Brewster then went on to 
January 24, 1966 
refer to the statements ascribed to Lynd, 
which Lynd reportedly affirmed, to the 
effect that "while in Hanoi" Professor 
Lynd "publicly asserted that the Johnson 
administration lies to the American peo-
ple and that the U.S. policy is immoral, 
illegal and antidemocratic." 
Madam President, those statements 
are a disservice to our country. We can 
tolerate dissent about judgments, but 
we cannot tolerate persons going around 
the world unlawfully and depreciating 
the cause of their country, not by speak-
ing the truth to their own people, but 
by trying to help Communists. 
I repeat what I said last week: The 
Attorney General should investigate this 
visit to Hanoi, and if he finds there has 
been a violation of law, he should insti-
tute the necessary proceedings to see to 
it that justice is done. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the two articles published 
in the Cleveland Plain Dealer be printed 
at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

SAYS PROFESSOR Is NAIVE: YALE PREXY 
ATTACKS LYND FOR HANOI TALK 
NEW HAVEN, CONN.?Yale University Presi-
dent Kingman Brewster, Jr., said yesterday 
that Staughton Lynd was "naive and mis-
guided" in making an unauthorized trip to 
North Vietnam. 
He had stronger words about the assistant 
history professor's speech in Hanoi, saying 
that it was "a disservice to the causes of free-
dom of dissent, freedom of travel, and con-
scientious pacifism." 
In his first direct comment on Lynd's ac-
tivities, Brewster said he felt that Lynd's 
"disparagement of his country's leadership 
and policies, while in Hanoi, damaged the 
causes he purports to serve." 
Lynd and two other Americans, Thomas 
Hayden, a founder of the Students for a 
Democratic Society, and Herbert Aptheker, a 
Communist Party theoretician, spent 10 days 
in North Vietnam, defying a State Depart-
ment ban on travel there. 
Brewster cited Hanoi radio reports, which 
he said Lynd reportedly confirmed, "that 
while in Hanoi he publicly asserted that the 
Johnson administration lies to the American 
people and that the U.S. policy is immoral, 
illegal and antidemocratic." 
Brewster said that Lynd is entitled to his 
opinions, "but the use of his presence in 
Hanoi to give this aid and comfort to a gov-
ernment engaged in hostilities with Amer-
ican forces seems to me inconsistent with the 
purposes of factfinding in the name of 
peace." 
Last week, when Lynd was asked about the 
radio Hanoi broadcast, he denied that he 
said the administration "lied" to the Amer-
ican people. He said he delivered the same 
speech last year at a rally in Washington, D.C.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 917 
come to play a more and more significant role 
as spokesman for the interests of unorganized 
individuals" (p. 25). Much of this is all too 
Irise but it overlooks the fact that if a Sen-
ater want to be a legislator, he can be. Many 
of our finest legislators come from the smaller 
States where constituent pressures are not so 
great in sheer volume. On the other hand, 
the legislator from the large State who de-
lies to perform a legislative rather than 
errand boy function has a unique oppor-
tunity to do so since the great size of his 
State can enable him to be relatively freer 
of particular interest group pressures. While 
Senators and Representatives do strive to 
serve as a court of last resort with the ad-
ministration for the unorganized individual, 
e do thing Members of Congress in both 
parties are well aware of "the principal or-
ganized social forces of society" and definitely 
so if they operate in one's own State. 
Huntington disagrees, correctly I think, 
th the so-called democratizers who "attack 
the power of the Senate Establishment or 
inner club and urge an equalizing of power 
among Congressmen so that a majority of 
each House can work, its will," (p. 27) . This 
dispersion of power would only lead to fur-
ther oligarchy and he believes "the only ef-
fective alternative to oligarchy is centralized 
authority." Thus Huntington argues that 
e Speaker in the House and the majority 
iesder in the Senate should select committee 
chairman and thus "restore to Congress a 
more positive role in the legislative process 
ansi strengthen it vis-a-vis the executive 
branch" (p. 28). Such a suggestion would 
he more likely to intensify the ''rubber 
stamp" aspects of a particular transitory 
majority, but I doubt if it would further the 
accommodation intrinsic and necessary, to 
the legislative process. Nor would it pro-
mote the interpersonal relations required to 
accomplish business in a chamber such as 
the Senate where much is accomplished by 
unanimous consent. The fact is that some 
committee chairmen in both Houses remain 
where they are because a majority likes it 
that way since these chairmen can withstand 
the heat. Other chairmen who block a ma-
jority are circumven fed in various informal 
ways when the majority desires, 
ifuntington feels that "recruitment of 
Senators from the national scene rather 
than from local politics would significantly 
narrow the gap between Congress and the 
other elements of national leadership. The 
'local politics' ladder to the Senate would be 
replaced or supplemented by a 'national 
politics' line in which mobile individuals 
might move from the establishment to the 
administration to the Senate" (p. 29). It 
is an interesting suggestion and probably 
there will be a few unique examples where 
this happens, but if it had been the prevail-
ing practice in the last two decades, two 
Presidents of the United States, John F. 
Mennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and two 
Vice Presidents Richard M. Nixon and 
1 1111ERT H, Humengay, would not have risen 
to national power. They were strictly 
products of the "local politics" ladder each 
of them beginning as either Congressman or 
nutyor. 
Huntington offers another possibility of a 
role for Congress and that is as a vehicle for 
pproving or disaporoving Presidential re-
quests within a given time period of 3 or 6 
months. He notes: "If thus compelled to 
choose openly, Congress. it may be supposed, 
ould almost invariably approve Presiden-
t al requests. Its veto power would become 
a reserve power like that of the Supreme 
Court if not like that of the British Crown. 
Cm these urgent measures it would perform 
a legitimizing function rather than a legis-
lative function" (p. 30), 
lie assumes that such a procedure would 
induce the executive leaders to consult with 
congressional leaders prior to the submis-
sion of such legislation and that. Congress 
would continue to amend and vote freely 011 
non-urgent executive requests. I completely 
disagree. Certainly the Civil Rights Act eh' 
1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were 
two acts which might well be put in the 
urgent category, yet to have Congress simply 
vote them up or down without the right to 
change them would have been wrong from 
the standpoint of eventual implementation 
of these measures, as well as from the ac - 
ceptance of the country for them. The fact 
is that Members of Congress Urged these 
measures?and more comprehensive ones- - 
before the Chief Executive submitted any at 
all. The fact is that in the case of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 it was largely written in 
the Senate Republican leader's office where 
by letting diverse viewpoints be aired, a vet - 
sion was agreed upon which was assured of 
passage. But even then further substan-
tial?and worthwhile, .e.g. the poll tax ban- - 
amendments occurred in committee and on 
the floor of both Chambers. 
With then Senator HUMPHREY, Democrat. 
of Minnesota, I was one of the Senate floor 
leaders in enacting the Civil Rights Act if 
1964. As leaders of a bipartisan coalition. 
we also attempted, over the years, at the be-
ginning of three Congresses to change rule 
XXII which permits the filibuster, In order 
to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 we were 
required to shut off a filibuster by securing 
approval from two-thirds of the Senators 
present and voting, which in practical terms 
meant two-thirds of the whole Senate. We 
did that. I think many of us who believe in 
majority cloture whereby 51 of 100 Senators 
could invoke cloture, after a stipulated pe-
riod of time, say a month, or so, realize that 
despite the time it took us and the obstacles 
we had to overcome, when we got there, we 
had a consensus in this land which no nar-
row sectionalism could afford to overlook.

"local" or "cosmopolitan," elected. He notes, 
correctly and, I think, regrettably that the 
"blur of activity" one often witnesses in the 
House or Senate Office Buildings "has little 
or nothing to do with pending legislation or 
public policy, but a great deal to do wills 
the reelection possibilities of the Members of 
the House and Senate," (p. 48). Not all 
Senators or Representatives are errand boys 
but there is no question that before one 
can be a statesman one must get elected. 
And who, in a free society, would have it; 
another way? 
Ralph K. Huitt, in a well-written essay, has 
analyzed the Senate with care and senti-
ment; ("The Internal Distribution of In-
fluence: The Senate"). As a staff man (for 
Lyndon Johnson and WILLIAM PROXMIRE 
he had a unique opportunity to view the 
Senate from different perspectives. His com-
ments on the role of individual and com-
mittee staffs and why these professionals 
serve is particularly noteworthy (pp. 97-981. 
In his first category of reforms which would 
strengthen the hands of the elected leaders, 
he retains the political scientist's nerve In 
change the seniority system, although his 
views are more tempered than most since Ile 
notes that "if it cannot be destroyed, et 
heist chairmen might be required to relin-
quish their authority at a certain age or the 
committee majority might be given some 
choice among the ranking members" (p. 91). 
Professor Huitt advocates a second cate-
gory of reforms which would bring some 
coordination to the spending and taxing pro-
grams of Congress. I completely agree wiLh 
him. In testifying before the Joint Com-
mittee on the Organization of the Congress. 
I stated that I was disturbed that the ad-
propriations process in Congress bears little 
relationship to the economic, tax, monetary, 
and fiscal policies with which it should he 
intimately involved. I recommended that the 
Joint Economic Committee be reconstituted 
to include the chairman, the ranking minor-
ity member, and a majority member from the 
following committees: The Appropriations 
and Banking and Currency Committees of 
both Houses, the House Committee on Ways 
and Means, and the Senate Committee on 
Finance. Because of the tremendous eco-
nomic impact which the decisions of the 
Armed Services and Public Works Commit-
tees of both Houses also have on Government 
spending and our economy perhaps they, 
too, should be represented. In addition, 
there should be greater coordination between 
the subcommittees which are practically 
autonomous arid the full Committee on Ap-
propriations in both Houses. The President's 
economic report should also be submitted 
more frequently and at a time when it can 
be utilized by the individual Members of 
Congress. 
Huitt notes that a third category of re-
forms relates to the effectiveness of indi-
vidual members and that "allowances for 
office help and materials are wholly inade-
quate for Senators from populous States.. 
These are nagging nuisances which reduce a 
Senator's efficiency" (p. 99). Again, he is 
completely correct. 'While he does not out-
line specific reforms, I would like to note a 
few which I also mentioned to the Joint 
Committee: authorizing each Member to 
have an additional legislative assistant for 
each of his standing committee assignments, 
provision for more adequate space, profes-
sional staff (especially for the minority), 
travel, telephone, and mail allowances, espe-
cially for Members from larger States, secur-
ing management co:nsultants to scrutinize 
senatorial offices and develop up-to-date pro-
cedures, precommittee staff hearings, elimi-
nation of senatorial consideration of post-
master appointments, permission for the 
military academies to select students via 
nationwide competitive examinations on a 
geographical basis, and establishment of a 
separate board of former Senators and Con-
gressmen to consider private immigration 
bills and small claims. 
Professor Huitt's fourth category of re-
forms "is aimed at the conduct of individual 
Members which brings discredit on the whole 
body" (p. 99). He :is not talking so much 
about unlawful conduct as that "behavior 
which falls in a kind of twilight zone where 
the ethics of the individual must be the 
regulator" (p. 99). I agree, only I would be 
more sepcific, as I attempted to be before the 
Joint Committee, when I urged that stand-
ards be applied not only to the Members of 
Congress but also to the professional staffs 
and other Senate officials as well as to all 
candidates for congressional office in a pri-
mary, special, or general election. Such 
standards should also be applied to the sen-
ior career and policymaking Members of the 
executive and judicial branches. 
Richard E. Neustadt in "Politicians and 
Bureaucrats" has written with skill of the 
relationships between the executive and 
legislative branches and within the execu-
tive establishment. He notes correctly that 
"presidential appointees are men-in-the-
middle, owing loyalty at once to the man who 
put them there, to the laws they administer, 
and to the body of careerists, backed b,y 
clientele, whose purposes they both direct 
and serve" (p. 109). Professor Neustacit's 
administrative experience is perhaps greater 
than his experience on Capitol Hill, since I 
am not inclined to agree with his soothing 
statement that "for most of its inhabitants 
the Senate is a pleasant place, possessed of 
quite enough prestige and power OP its 
semblance), and amenities of stall and 
space, and time to enjoy them (6 years at a 
crack), so that it alone remains what much 
of Government once was, a refuge for the 
spirit of political free enterprise, unfettered

Herbert Aptheker, U.S. Communist Party his-
torian. 
Charging that the three men violated the 
laws of the United States in their unauthor-
ized travel to Communist Vietnam and ought 
to be prosecuted, LAUSCHE said in a Senate 
speech: 
"I can suffer disagreements with the views 
of the President and other distinguished 
leaders about the course that we should fol-
low in South Vietnam. 
'However, neither I nor the general citi-
zenry and, of course, not the Members of the 
U.S. Senate, should give tolerance or suffer-
ance to persons who make statements hoping 
that the Communists of North Vietnam 
would be victorious. 
"These individuals are not promoting the 
cause of the United States. They should not 
be listened to; they should be recognized not 
in their false but their true colors which 
cause them to have greater sympathy for 
the cause of the Communists than for the 
cause of our own citizenry and Nation." 
COMMENT BY SENATOR RANDOLPH 
ON THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET 
Mr. RANDOLPH. Madam President, 
I have had access to the information 
contained in the President's budget mes-
sage. I wish to make certain comments 
at this time and, if necessary, be per-
mitted to have 1 additional minute be-
yond the 3 minutes allocated in the 
morning hour. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? The Chair hears none, and 
it is so ordered. 
Mr. RANDOLPH. Madam President, 
the President's 1967 budget program 
demonstrates responsible fiscal and eco-
nomic policy? appropriate to the times. 
With this program we can move closer 
toward the goals of what is characterized 
as the Great Society at home while 
strengthening our resistance to aggres-
sion abroad. 
With this program we can look "for-
ward to a continuation of the unprece-
dented and uninterrupted' economic 
growth of the past 5 years. 
With this program, we can meet our 
domestic needs without either recession 
or inflation. 
Since early 1961, the total national 
output has risen by nearly $200 billion, 
employment has increased by more than 
61/2 million workers, and the unemploy-
ment rate has dropped from 7 percent 
to close to 4 percent, a decrease which 
Is highly encouraging. 
In the year ahead, even higher levels 
of output, income, and employment can 
be expected. To sustain a sound and 
prosperous economy, the President is 
calling for a modest measure of fiscal 
restraint. He has proposed a set of tax 
measures which economic experts say 
will soak up a small proportion of the 
rising demand in the economy and en-
able the Government to achieve a small 
surplus in its cash transactions with the 
public. I have no reason to doubt the 
validity of the appraisal by the experts. 
In sum, the President's 1967 budget 
provides adequately for furthering our 
domestic and international objectives 
without imposing undue strain on our 
economic potential or productive capa-
bilities. His budget proposals, I believe, 
by and large, are both prudent and re-
strained. Together with responsible 
efforts by business and labor, our na-
tional and international objectives can 
be advanced?and advanced in an en-
vironment of steady yet noninflationary 
economic growth.

920 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE January 24, 1966 
Rev. Amor V. Oribello, moderator, Central 
Luzon Conference, United Church of Christ, 
Mr. GRUENING. Madam President, 
the advertisement gave only a partial 
list of those endorsing the statement and 
I ask unanimous consent that the state-
ment, the partial list of names and ad-
dresses of ministers, rabbis, and priests 
endorsing the statement, as well as the 
statement itself and reasons for the 
statement given by the Fellowship of 
Reconciliation be printed in full at the 
conclusion of my remarks. 
There being no objection, the state-
ment, names, and addresses were ordered 
to be printed in the RECORD. 
(See exhibit 1.) 
Mr. GRUEN1NG. Madam President, 
the statement signed by all these emi-
nent men is impressive because it sep-
arately addresses itself to the United 
States, to the people and Government of 
North Vietnam, to the National Libera-
tion Front of South Vietnam, and to the 
people and Government of the People's 
Republic of China. It is my earnest 
hope that the pleas for peace contained 
in this statement will be heeded by all 
those so vitally concerned. 
l'Jxumrr 
From the New York Times, Jan. 23, 19661 
International Committee of Conscience on 
Vietnam (affiliated with the Clergymen's 
Emergency Committee for Vietnam of the 
l'f'ellowship of Reconcilation). 
STATEMENT Dr THE INTERNATIONAL COMMIT-
'r T,m: or. CONSCIENCE IN VIETNAM--THEE ARE 
(RIR BROTHERS WHOM WE KILL 
No generation has had shown to it more 
clearly than ours the interdependence of all 
men. No matter what the reasons we ad-
vance for the killing we do?in Vietnam or 
elsewhere?they are our brothers whom we 
kill. More indeed than our brothers?they 
are ourselves and our children, for as surely 
as we do not find other ways than war for 
solving our human problems, we destroy the 
Future for ourselves and for them. 
We who sign this statement are impelled 
to speak by the tragedy of Vietnam, and by 
the failure of ;:eavernments to end that terri-
ble conflict. Yet we think not only of Viet-
nam, but of all our apprehensive world, torn 
by contending ideologies and ambitions, of 
which Vietnam is the present symbol. We, 
who in various ways have assumed the tern-
hie responsibility responsibility of articulating the human 
conscience, must speak or, literally, we 
should expect the very stones to cry out. 
We know the claims of both sides in the 
Vietnamese conflict. Each professes fts own 
moral rectitude. The United States and its 
allies assert their determination to stop what 
they describe as "ruthless Communist egres-
sion" in order to defend freedom, both for 
Vietnam and for the world. North Vietnam, 
the National Liberation Front of South Viet-
nam, and the People's Republic of China 
-vigorously proclaim their intention to throw 
back the "ruthlessly aggressive American im-
perialists" in defense of the right of the Viet-
namese to govern themselves, and on behalf 
of all those nations that are seeking "na-
tional liberation." Each side rejects with 
acorn the claims of the other, and ridicules 
the possibility that its antagonist may be 
sincere. 
We do not question the sincerity of either 
elde, on the contrary, the passionate con-
viction that each has of its own absolute 
rightness profoundly alarms us. Their de-
termination seems to have no terminal point; 
to prove its case, each seems willing to risk 
the ultimate nuclear conflict and jeopardize 
the future of the human race. 
Helpless villagers in Vietnam, unable either 
lo escape or defend themselves, recoil from 
the bombing of one side and from the terror 
of the other. War has become a way of life 
for them, dominating their rice paddies and 
inarketp laces, conscripting their young men, 
making widows of their women and orphans 
of their children, holding a whole population 
hostage to horror. In such circumstances. 
the claims of both sides become a mockery of 
lthe noble words they use. Freedom and jus-
tice are for men; they are not achieved by the 
tormenting of men. 
We address ourselves to the rulers of na-
tions, and to those associated with them: 
Lyndon B. Johnson, Nguyen Cao Ky, ho Chi 
Minh, arid Mao Tse-tung. 
Continuation of the war will not prove 
which side is right and which wrong. It will 
only increasingly force both sides to commit 
such atrocities as will mock all their claims. 
will draw both sides farther and farther 
Into a maelstrom of destruction in which 
mankind as a whole may finally be engulfed. 
You, each of you, has the opportunity at 
least to try to reverse this dreadful course, 
arid each of you has the responsibility. We 
plead with you to accept it, now, today, in 
the interest of all humanity. 
We address ourselves to our fellow human 
beings everywhere. 
Each of our nations has its hopes t nd as-
pirations, its own history and grievances and 
resentments. We live in widely differing so-
teal systems and ideologies, which seem to 
have in common only one thing: a willing-
ness to resort to war in their own interests. 
But war cannot serve the interests of men 
any longer, if it ever could. In this age, no 
matter for what ends war is fought, it can 
only destroy all our hopes and all our accom-
plishments. We must find new, nonmilitary 
ways of dealing with the conflicts and mis-
understandings that inevitably arise among 
us, and to secure justice for all men. 
We recognize and respect the necessary 
functions of government. We are not dis-
loyal; we honor the accomplishments and 
particular values of our respective societies. 
But governments have as their proper re-
sponsibility the safety and well-being of their 
citizens,, and in our world that well-being 
cannot be achieved through the military con-
frontation of competing states. 
It is your responsibility and ours Ia make 
this known, unmistakably and in every way 
open to us. To this end, we who sign this 
statement have committed ourselves as a be-
ginning. We represent many religious faiths 
in many countries, but we are of a common 
mind in our plea to all the con tending 
parties. 
Ti) the people and Government of the 
United States of America: 
The horrors that your planes and massive 
firepower are inflicting on the people of 
Vietnam are beyond any moral or political 
justification. The destruction of whole 
villages and the murder of masses of non-
combatants which are the consequences of 
your policies cannot be excused on any 
grounds whatever. We believe that there is 
wrong on both sides, but that, as the only 
one of the world's major powers directly 
involved, you bear the heaviest responsibility 
for the initiation of peace moves. We call 
on you: 
To stop the air attacks in both North and 
South Vietnam, at once, unilaterally, not 
simply as a political move in the direction of 
negotiations, but because those attacks are 
an affront to human decency and unworthy 
of a great people; 
To express a clear intention to withdraw 
all U.S. military forces from Vietnam, con-
sistent with the 1954 Geneva Agreements, to 
take effect immediately on conclusion of 
satisfactory arrangements to assure the Viet-
namese people a free choice of government; 
To state unequivocally your readiness to 
negotiate an end of the war on the basis of' 
the 1954 agreements, with the National 
Liberation Front as one of the principals in 
the negotiations. 
To the people and Government of North 
Vietnam, and to the National Liberation 
Front of South Vietnam: 
The opposition to your cause is not motiv-
ated solely by what you call the "aggressive 
Imperialism" of the United States. Honest, 
brave Vietnamese patriots who fought beside 
you in the Viet Minh against the French are 
among those who fight against you now. 
They distrust your intentions; they cherish 
certain rights and freedoms which they sus-
pect you of wanting to destroy; they are 
shocked find repelled by some of the methods 
you use. We believe that a heavy respon-
sibility for ending the war honorably rests 
with the United States, but that there is 
also a very heavy responsibility on you to 
create the conditions of peace. We call on 
you: 
To abandon the methods of torture, assas-
sination, the indiscriminate bombing o 
civilians and other forms of terror. They are 
an affront to the whole concept of human 
decency, and hopelessly degrade your cause. 
No consideration whatever of either justice 
or vengence can excuse such tactics; 
To issue a clear statement that any Viet-
namese Government in which you may have 
a part will honor the right of its citizens to 
practice their religions in absolute freedom, 
and that there will be no reprisals against 
those who have fought against you; 
To express your unqualified willingness to 
meet with representatives of the United 
States and this present South Vietnamese 
Government to negotiate peace and the 
future of your country, based on the 1954 
agreements. 
To the people and government of the 
People's Republic of China: 
Your influence in southeast Asia is enor-
mous, your words and actions are weighed 
throughout the world as portents of the 
future. We call on you: 
To refrain from statements and fictions 
that harden already bitter attitudes on both 
sides, and so perpetuate the war: 
To make clear your willingness to see the 
countries of southeast Asia develop their in-
stitutions of government and society free 
from outside intervention by force, and free 
from the military presence of any foreign 
powers. 
It is hard to imagine a world so torn by 
suspicion and hatred as is ours turning away 
from war and toward the resolution of con-
flict and the building of justice by non-
violent means, yet we humans have no other 
choice, and in our great religious heritage 
we have the guidelines we need to make this 
difficult decision. We call on all those, of 
whatever faith and nationally, who share our 
concern, to join us in our effol ts to build 
a truly human society on earth.

A NOTE FROM THE SPONSOR 
The Fellowship of Reconciliation is the 
sponsor of the International Committee of 
Conscience on Vietnam, as it was of its pred-
ecessor the wholly American Clergymen's 
Emergency Committee for Vietnam. This 
does not mean that all of the supporters of 
the various statements and other actions of 
these committees endorse the entire position 
of the fellowship; many?perhaps most?of 
them do not, and their signatures commit 
them only to the statements they have 
signed, the one to the left in particular. 
Considering the number of individuals in
and the complications of communica - 
tion, however, it is unavoidable that deci-
sions as to the time and circumstances under 
which these statements will be made public 
must be made by the fellowship. There 
will be those who will question the decision 
to publish this statement at this time. Their 
questions will be of two sorts: 
1. Is it fair to publish a statement urging 
the United States to initiate peace moves at 
a moment when President Johnson has sus-
pended the bombing of North Vietnam and 
is insisting on. his readiness to negotiate 
peace? 
2. Would it not be wiser to delay publica-
tion by 2 weeks more in order to have a 
fuller representation of signers from other 
countries? (Committees have been formed 
in a number of other countries, but have not 
had time to receive and transmit names of 
hundreds?perhaps thousands?of signers to 
the statement. It is probable that 2 weeks 
from now the number of signers listed here 
would be doubled or trebled.) 
We have considered both these matters 
carefully and make these comments. 
The peace offensive 
We are gratified at the suspension of the 
bombing of North Vietnam, though we regret 
the continuation of bombing in South Viet-
nam and deplore the initiation of bombing 
In Laos. We rejoice at the emphasis on peace 
that has dominated our Government's state-
ments in the past few weeks, and earnestly

January 2.4, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD? SENATE 
hope that it may continue. Some aspects 
of that emphasis, as well as the report that 
there has been no positive response from 
Hanoi make us uneasy, however. 
Both in the President's state of the Un-
ion address and in other Government state-
ments, the war hi Vietnam continues to be 
described without qualification as "Com-
munist aggression." From the point of view 
of North Vietnam and the National Libera-
tion Front (Vietcong), however, the genesis 
of the war was the refusal of the South Viet-
namese Government under President Diem, 
supported by the United States, to permit the 
1956 elections that had been the keystone of 
the armistice signed in Geneva in 1954. That 
armistice, ending the war between the vic-
torious Viet Minh and the defeated French, 
had provided for the withdrawal of the Viet 
Minh north of the 17th parallel and the 
French south of it, as a temporary measure 
until the French could withdraw completely 
and nationwide elections under interna-
tional supervision in July 1956, would unite 
the country. Millions of non-Communists 
throughout the world, whatever their ulti-
mate political sympathies, agree that the re-
fusal to permit these elections was the vio-
lation of the armistice that laid the founda-
tion for the conflict now going on. 
In the second place, though the Presi-
dent on January 12 carried the matter of 
Vietcong representation in negotiations an 
Inch further in saying that "we will con-
sider the views of any group," he has not 
accepted what many qualified observers con-
sider may be the sine qua non for negotia-
tions; recognition of the Vietcong National 
Liberation Front as a full principal in such 
negotiations. Since NLF has been the prin-
cipal opposition force throughout the last 
10 years of war, and since it now actually 
governs substantial portions of South Viet-
nam, it is not hard to understand its insist-
ence that it be a direct and full participant 
in the negotiations. 
Why now? 
January 23 is the final day of the lunar 
new year celebration known in Vietnam as 
Tet, and the final day of the truce agreed 
upon by both sides. The days that follow 
may well be decisive in determining whether 
this brutal, bloody war will be ended or. es-
calated. Hence this is a critical moment 
for those whose compassion goes out to the 
helpless Vietnamese people caught in this 
storm of ideological destruction and murder, 
and who are concerned lest all humanity's 
future be engulfed in nuclear conflict. 
This is the moment to bring maximum, in-
sistent pressure on both sides to make peace, 
to moderate their rigidities. It is a moment 
to insist that the United States recognize 
and deal with motivations on the other side 
that are more than simple aggression. It is 
also a moment to insist that the Govern-
ment of North Vietnam and the leaders of 
the National Liberation Front respond to 
the American peace proposals more posi-
tively than with vituperation and mockery, 
stating in unequivocal language what spe-
cifically they consider to be wrong and how 
It could be set right. 
These are the considerations that led to 
the decision to publish the statement now, 
while the U.S. Government still seeks peace 
and, regrettably, even before the names of 
many signers from this country and abroad 
can be included. 
We hope that those who read this state-
ment will feel led also to bring maximum 
pressure to bear on both sides, with letters 
to all the parties involved. Letters to gov-
ernments can be addressed to Washington, 
Hanoi, and Saigon, of course; letters to the 
Vietcong forces may be addressed to Front 
National de Liberation du Sud-Vietnam, 18 
Longevin, El Mouradia, Algiers, Alegeria.

THE MANSFIELD REPORT ON 
yjETNAM 
Mr. GRUEND. iesident, 
during the recess between the 1st and 
the 2d sessions of the 89th Congress, 
our able and distinguished majority 
leader, the Senator from Montana [Mr. 
MANSFIELD], accompanied by four of our 
eminent colleagues, Senators MUSKIE, 
INOUYE, AIKEN, and BOGGS, at the request 
of the President, undertook a study mis-
sion to Europe and Asia. 
As a result of this 30-day mission, the 
study group filed with the Senate Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations on January 
3, 1966, a detailed, realistic report on the 
United States involvement in the unde-
clared war in Vietnam entitled: "The 
Vietnam Conflict: The Substance and 
the Shadow." 
I ask unanimous consent that that 
report be printed at the conclusion of 
my remarks, together with the letter of 
transmittal. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is ordered. 
(See exhibit 1.) 
Mr. GRUENING. Madam President, 
at the present time, it is obvious that 
the administration has under serious 
consideration the determination as to 
whether or not there should be further 
escalation of our military commitment 
in Vietnam. It would be well if those 
charged with such decision read care-
fully and fully the report submitted by 
Senator MANSFIELD and his colleagues. 
Senator MANSFIELD is well qualified to 
head such a mission. A student of Asia, 
Its history and politics, he submitted, 
February 25, 1963, and at various earlier 
times, reports on Vietnam and southeast 
Asia containing predictions of things to 
come there unless our policies were 
altered. His sage advice then remained 
unheeded. I hope his warning contained 
in this report will be more carefully 
considered. 
The senior Senator from Vermont 
[Mr. AIKEN] was also a valuable addition 
to the study team, serving as he does as 
minority member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations with many 
years of experience in foreign affairs. 
In fact, all the members of the study 
team are to be highly commended for 
the contribution which they have made 
to a more realistic appraisal of our Viet-
namese involvement. 
Some of the more important, sobering 
conclusions of the report are: 
A rapid solution to the conflict in Viet-
nam is not in immediate prospect. This 
would appear to be the case whether military 
victory is pursued or negotiations do, in fact, 
materialize. 
"Insofar as the military situation is con-
cerned, the large-scale introduction of U.S. 
forces and their entry into combat has 
blunted but not turned back the drive of 
the Vietcong. The latter have responded to 
the, increased American role with a further 
strengthening of their forces by local recruit-
ment in the south and reinforcements from 
the north and a general stepping up of mili-
tary activity. As a result the lines remain 
drawn in South Vietnam in substantially the 
same pattern as they were at the outset of 
the increased U.S. commitment. What has 
changed basically is the scope and intensity 
of the struggle and the part which is being 
played by the forces of the United States and 
those of.North Vietnam. 
925 
Despite the great increase in American 
military commitment, it is doubtful in view 
of the acceleration of Vietcong efforts that 
the constricted position now held in Vietnam 
by the Saigon government can continue to 
be held for the indefinite future, let alone 
extended, without a further augmentation 
of American forces on the ground. Indeed, 
if present trends continue, there is no assur-
ance as to what ultimate increase in Ameri-
can military commitment will be required 
before the conflict is terminated. For the 
fact is that under present terms of reference 
and as the war has evolved, the question is 
not one of applying increased U.S. pressure 
to a defined military situation but rather 
of pressing against a military situation which 
is, in effect, open ended. How open is de-
pendent on the extent to which North Viet-
nam and its supporters are willing and able 
to meet increased force by increased force. 
All of mainland southeast Asia, at least, can-
not be ruled out as a potential battlefield. 
As noted, the war has already expanded 
significantly into Laos and is beginning to 
lap over the Cambodian border while pres-
sures increase in the northeast of Thailand. 
Even if the war remains substantially 
within its present limits, there is little 
foundation for the expectation that the Gov-
ernment of Vietnam in Saigon will be able, 
In the near future, to carry a much greater 
burden than it is now carrying. This is in 
no sense a reflection on the caliber of the 
current leaders of Vietnam But the fact is 
that they are, as other Vietnamese Govern-
ments have been over the past decade, at 
the beginning of a beginning in dealing with 
the problems of popular mobilization in sup-
port of the Government. They are starting, 
moreover, from a point considerably behind 
that which prevailed at the time of Presi-
dent Diem's assassination. Under present 
concepts and plans, then, what lies ahead is, 
literally, a vast and continuing undertaking 
in social engineering in the wake of such 
military progress as may be registered. And 
for many years to come this task will be very 
heavily dependent on U.S. foreign aid. 
The basic concept of present American 
policy with respect to Vietnam casts the 
United. States in the role of support of the 
Vietnamese Government and people. This 
concept becomes more difficult to maintain 
as the military participation of the United 
States undergoes rapid increase. Yet a 
change in the basic concept could have a 
most unfortunate impact upon the Viet-
namese people and the world at large. What 
is involved here is the necessity for the 
greatest restraint in word and action, lest 
the concept be eroded and the war drained 
of a purpose with meaning to the people of 
Vietnam. 
This danger is great, not only because of 
the military realities of the situation, but 
also because, with few exceptions, assistance 
has not been and is not likely to be forth-
coming for the war effort in South Vietnam 
from nations other than the United states. 
On the contrary, as it now appears, the 
longer the war continues in its present pat-
tern and the more it expands in scope, the 
greater will become the strain placed upon 
the relations of the United States with allies 
both in the Far East and in Europe. 
Many nations are deeply desirous of an 
end to this conflict as quickly as possible. 
Few are specific as to the manner in which 
this end can be brought about or the shape 
it is likely to take. In any event, even 
though other nations in certain circum-
stances, may be willing to play a third-party 
role in bringing about negotiations, any 
prospects for effective negotiations at this 
time (and they are slim) are likely to be 
largely dependent on the initiatives and ef-
forts of the combatants. 
Negotiations at this time, moreover, if 
they do come about, and if they are accom-
panied by cease-fire and standfast, would 
serve to stabilize a situation in which the

1 ETTER OF TRANSMTTTAL 
ITS. SENATE, 
DETTEE OF THE MAJORITY T,EADFR, 
Washington, D.C., January] 3, 1966. 
Boo. J. W. FULBRIGHT, 
Chairman, Committee On Foreign Relations, 
U.S. Senate, Washington. D.C. 
DEAR MR, CHAIRMAN: In accord with a letter 
from the President dated November 7, 1965, 
Senators Asazn, MUSKIE, Boccs. and INotrrir, 
joined me in a study mission to Europe and 
to Asia. The group was drawn in part from 
the Senate it large, rather than exclusively 
from the committee, because it seemed to 
me that it would be useful to add to a joint 
effort, of this kind, the views of Members who 
could bring other perspectives to the study. 
In this connection, the contributions of Sen-
ators MITSKIE. BOGGS? and INOUYE were ex-
ceptional. Insofar as Senator AIKEN is con-
corned, he also provided not only a bipartisan. 
strength to our purposes, but his great wis-
dom and judgment and his knowledge based 
on a long Senate and committee experience. 
The mission took us to France, Poland, the 
Soviet Union, Romania, Ceylon, Burma, Thai-
land, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Hong Kong, 
the Philippines. and Japan. Consideration 
was given to the inclusion of both Pakistan 
and India ill the itinerary. It was decided 
that it. would be inadvisable to include these 
two great countries, because the immediate 
difficulties with which they are beset over 
Kashmir are currently under active consid-
eration before the United Nations, and it is 
the policy of the United States to support 
fully the efforts of that international body 
to alleviate these difficulties. In the cir-
cumstances and in view of the nature of the 
group, we did not wish by our presence even 
to imply otherwise. To avoid any possible 
misunderstanding, therefore, we proceeded 
by a longer route from Bucharest to Aden 
and across the Indian Ocean to Ceylon, mak-
ing courtesy calls en route in Riyadh and 
On this mission, which took us more than 
:10,000 miles in over 30 days, we met with 
many of our own officials abroad and with 
officials of other governments. We went not 
to propound but to ask, to listen, and to note. 
To the extent that we spoke, it was to stress 
the essential unity of the Nation, irrespective 
of party or personal view in matters which 
affect the Na tion in its relations with other 
nations. We emphasized the deep concern 
if the President and the people for peace, 
end the profound preference which this Na-
Lion has for the works of construction over 
those of destrection. We reiterated the deep 
and firm commitment of the United States 
to a just resolution of the conflict in Viet-
nam.. 
We were at all times correctly and cour-
leously received and, on occasion, with very 
great warmth. Conversations with the offi-
eials of other governments were invariably 
frank, often animated, but never personally 
discourteous Even where our points of view 
differed most markedly. Almost without ex-
ception, officials put their cards on the table-
We did the same. 
Reports covering the situation in Vietnam 
and on other aspects of the mission were 
submitted to the President on December 19, 
1965, the day following my return to Wash-
ington. Subsequently, there were discussed 
when I met with Secretaries Rust and Mc-
Namara. A report reflecting the j.iint obser-
vations and conclusions of the group as the 
situation appeared to us in Novrinber-De-
cember 1965 is now submitted herewith to 
you as chairman of the Committee on For-
eign Relations. 
The situation in Vietnam and i 1.5 world-
wide ramifications constitute the gravest 
international problem which has eonfronted 
the United States in many years. In con-
nection therewith, the forces of t..n United 
States in Vietnam (under Gen. William C. 
Westmoreland) are performing a profound 
service at great personal sacrifice an behalf 
of the Nation. It is essential the!. the full 
dimensions of the Vietnamese problem be 
explored and considered as thorooghly and 
as widely as practicable in preseni circum-
stances. It was in the hope that a construc-
tive contribution will be made to tais explo-
ration and discussion, that this report was 
prepared for the use of the committee and 
the Senate. There has also been included, 
as an appendix to this report, a study made 
public by a similar Senate group n a pre-
vious presidential mission 3 year" ago. It 
may help to provide a useful perspective for 
the current situation in Vietnam. 
should like to note before closing a mat-
ter of special interest to the comm ii see. The 
Ambassadors and the officers of the Depart-
ment of State abroad were immensely helpful 
to the mission. Administrative arrange-
ments for the group were exceptionelly effec-
tive and efficient. The knowledge, under-
standing, and diplomatic skills of the em-
bassy staffs which were placed at our dis-
posal were generally outstanding in char-
acter. And the cooperation of the Defense 
Department, not only in providing efficient 
transportation but in many other ways, was 
of the greatest value to us. 
The group had as escort from the Depart-
ment of State, Minister Francis Meloy, 
Jr., Mr. W. 0. Trone, Direr ler of the Office of 
Operations, Department of State, and Mr. 
Paul Kelly. The Department of Defense pro-
vided the services of Maj. 0-en. Charles R. 
Roderick, Col. Prank Gess, and Lt. Col. 
George L. J. Dalferes. The a.ssis"ance of 
these men was highly effective in every re-
spect and of the greatest value to the group. 
Sincerely yours,

THE VIETN At CONFLICT: THE SUDST NCR AND 
THE SHADOW 
Ej A NE : THE SUBSTANCE OF WAR 
1. Introductory 
The most important new factor in the war 
in Vietnam has been the introduction of large 
numbers of U.S. troops into South Vietnam 
and their direct entry into com.bat. This 
augmentation of the U.S. military role in 
Vietnam was a response to a near-desperate 
situation early in 1965. There is no question 
that the Government of Vietnam in Saigon 
was faced with a rapidly deteriorating posi-
tion a.t that time. 
After the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem, 
repeated coups had weakened the cohesive-
ness of the central authority and seted to 
stimulate public disaffection and indifference 
to the war. At the same time, there was 
a greatly accelerated military drive by 
strengthened Vietcong forces. Their control 
expanded over large areas of the country, 
particularly in provinces adjacent to the 
western borders. Communications and trans-
portation between population centers became 
increasingly hazardous, except by Vietcong 
January 24, 1966 
sufferance. In short, a total collapse of the 
Saigon Government's authority appeared im-
minent in the early months of 1965. 
U.S. combat troops in strength arrived at 
that point in response to the appeal of the 
Saigon authorities. The Vietcong counter 
response was to increase their military activ-
ity with forces strengthened by intensified 
local recruitment and infiltration of regular 
North Vietnamese troops. With the change 
in the composition of opposing forces the 
character of the war also changed sharply. 
2. Military forces of the Government of 
Vietnam 
The Government of Vietnam now has ap-
proximately 635,000 men under arms. Of thin 
number, however, only about 300,000 are reg-
ular troops of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and 
Marines, with about 88 percent being Army 
troops. A general reserve of six airborne bat-
talions and five marine battalions is equipped 
to fight anywhere in the country. 
The Vietnamese Government has six fight-
er-bomber squadrons. It also has a small 
navy, composed of sea, river, and coastal 
forces. 
In the total of 635,000 men there are also 
regional forces of about 120,000 men which 
act as a constabulary in the 43 provinces. 
Each province chief, who has a military as 
well as a civil capacity, has a number of 
regional force companies under his com-
mand. Popular forces number about 140,000. 
Lightly armed, this group is recruited as 
a rule from local youth to act ELS defend-
ers of villages and hamlets. A civilian irregu-
lar defense group is recruited by the Viet-
namese Special Forces. It numbers about 
25,000 and is posted in border areas for patrol 
purposes. Finally, there is a national police 
of about 50,000 men. 
The total of 635,000 men in all categories 
is expected to be expanded in the current 
year, although a substantial increase is not, 
anticipated. The sources of expanded re-
cruitment are not great and, in any event, 
are shared with the Vietcong. Moreover, a 
high desertion rate continues, despite deter-
mined efforts to reduce it. 
3. U.S. and international forces in Vietnam 
In 1962, U.S. military advisers and service 
forces in South Vietnam totaled approxi-
mately 10,000 men. This number had in-
creased by May of 1965 to about 34,000. At 
that time the American force was still basic-
ally an advisory organization. Americans, 
in regular combat units.; were not yet en-
gaged on the ground. U.S. heheopter com-
panies were in use but only to supply tacti-
cal transportation to regular Vietnamese 
units and the U.S. jet fighter-bombers in the 
country with the exception of two or three 
squadrons of aircraft were not yet engaged 
in support of the Vietnamese Armed Forces. 
By December 1965, however, there were 
approximately 170,000 U.S. troops in South 
Vietnam. Additionally, there were about 
21,000 soldiers and marines from the Re-
public of Korea, an infantry battalion, and 
a battery of artillery, comprising some 1,200 
men, from Australia, and a New Zeala nd ar-
tillery battery of about 150 men. 
The augmented U.S. ground forces were 
composed of two Army divisions, the 1st In-
fantry Division, and the 1st Air Cavalry Divi-
sion, and two separate brigades, the let Bri-
grade, 101st Airborne Division, a:nd the .173(1 
Airborne Brigrade. The Australian and New 
Zealand troops were attached to the latter 
group. A full U.S. Marine division reinforced 
by a separate regiment was in Vietnam with 
the support of six Marine fighter-bomber 
squadrons. 
The small Vietnamese coastal force was 
augmented by a number of U.S. naval ships 
and Coast Guard vessels. The U.S. 7th Fleet 
was off the Vietnamese coast. Planes from 
its carriers were active in the air campaign 
against North Vietnam. They were also re-
inforcing the U.S. Air Force and Vietnamese

fighter-bomber squadrons in operations in 
South Vietnam. 
Ten U.S. Air Force and Marine fighter-
bomber squadrons were operating from five 
jet airfields in Vietnam; a sixth field was 
under construction. B-52 bombers from 
Guam were providing additional air strength, 
concentrating on more remote Vietcong bases 
which had previously been immune to 
harassment or attack. 
The magnitude of the expanded U.S. mili-
tary effort has required a vastly enlaged sup-
port complex. Starting almost from scratch 
in May of 1905, a logistic system has been 
built. There are four major logistic support 
areas. One is in the Saigon region, includ-
ing Bien Hao and Vung Tau. The other 
three are located along the coast, at Cam 
Ranh Bay, at Qui Nhon in Binh Dinh 
Province, and at Da Nang. The rapid in-
fusion of American forces has strained the 
facilities of the new logistic system to the 
utmost, with long delays in unloading and 
moving equipment not unusual. There have 
also been and still are shortages of important 
items of supply despite efforts to eliminate 
these shortages. 
4. Relationship of United States and Viet-
namese forces 
From the point of view of American policy 
and practice, the war itself remains a Viet-
namese war. The American command em-
phasizes that U.S. forces in Vietnam are 
there to support the Vietnamese and their 
Armed Forces in the effort to resist aggres-
sion by infiltration from the north and ter-
rorism and subversion from within. Viet-
namese sovereignty and the paramount role 
of the Vietnamese are meticulously respected 
and the supporting nature of the U.S. role is 
stressed. 
There is no combined or unified command 
of the international forces in Vietnam. 
United States and Vietnamese forces work 
together through coordination and coopera-
tion. The commander of the U.S. forces 
maintains close liaison with the Vietnamese 
Minister of Defense and the Chief of the 
Joint General Staff. Strategy and plans are 
devised together. Parallel instructions are 
then issued to the respective commanders 
through corps and division to regimental 
level. In the execution of an operation a 
joint command post is set up or liaison offi-
cers are exchanged and terrain is appor-
tioned for tactical areas of operation. Ac-
cording to American military commanders 
these arrangements have proved to be prac-
tical and workable. 
5. Vietcong-North Vietnamese forces 
In December 1965, the best available esti-
mates placed Vietcong strength in South 
Vietnam at 230,000 men. This figure is double 
that of 3 years ago. Total Vietcong strength, 
apparently, is steadily increasing despite the 
serious casualties which these forces have 
suffered during the past few months. 
Of the present total, approximately 73,000 
are main force soldiers, including 14,000 reg-
ular PAVN (Peoples' Army of North Viet-
nam) troops from North Vietnam. The Viet-
cong forces also include about 100,000 militia, 
some 17,000 support troops who operate along 
lines of communication, and approximately 
40,000 political cadres. It is estimated that 
the Vietcong, through local recruitment in 
the south and infiltration from ?the north, 
have the capability of a substantial increase 
in their numbers within a short period of 
time. 
Infiltration of men from North Vietnam 
through Laos has been going on for many 
years. It was confined primarily to political 
cadres and military leadership until about 
the end of 1964 when North Vietnam Regular 
Army troops began to enter South Vietnam 
by this route. It is anticipated that with 
the multiplication of routes through Laos 
the rate of infiltration is likely to increase 
threefold from the present estimated 1,500 
per month. The monsoon, which earlier was 
considered to be of great significance in its 
effect on the reinforcement capabilities of 
the Vietcong as well as on the ability of both 
sides to prosecute the war, has proved in ex-
perience to be of minor consequence if, in-
deed, of any consequence at all. 
6. Current state of the war 
By November 1965, American troops were 
directly involved in battle to a much greater 
degree than at any other time in the history 
of the Vietnamese conflict. At the same 
time, the intensity of the war itself reached 
a new high. The Vietcong initiated 1,038 
incidents during the last week of November 
and the total number of incidents which had 
increased steadily throughout 1965, reached 
3,588 in that month. These incidents in-
volved armed attacks up to regimental 
strength as well as terrorism and sabotage 
of various kinds of antiaircraft fire against 
U.S. aircraft. In the later months of 1965 
the trend was toward larger attacks, except 
in the Mekong Delta where there were nu-
merous small-scale actions. 
With the increase in the intensity of the 
conflict, there were increased numbers of 
casualties among all participants. In the 
month of November 1965, alone, 469 Ameri-
cans were killed in action, a figure repre-
senting about 35 percent of all Americans 
killed in action in the war until that date. 
In addition 1,470 Americans were listed as 
wounded and 33 as missing. During the 
same month the South Vietnamese Army re-
ported 956 soldiers killed in action, 2,030 
wounded, and 355 missing. The Vietcong, for 
their part, are estimated to have lost 5,300 
men killed in the month and, in addition, 
595 were taken prisoner. Many of these 
casualties were regulars of the North Viet-
namese Army. 
7. The security situation in South Vietnam 
The presence of U.S. combat forces has 
a'ted to arrest the deterioration in general 
security in Government-controlled parts of 
South Vietnam. It has also improved the 
ability of the Vietnamese Government to hold 
Saigon, the strategic heart of the country, the 
coastal bases, and certain other key areas in 
the country. In the latter connection, it 
should be noted that a strategic route (19) 
from the coast to the western highlands has 
been reopened for convoyed ground traffic to 
Plieku, a major military strong point in the 
western highlands. On certain other roads, 
an improvement in security is also reported. 
8. Vietcong reactions 
Faced by a blunting of their military 
efforts, the Vietcong have reacted strongly to 
the new situation. Beginning in June- an 
estimated 1,500 North Vietnamese troops per 
month have entered South Vietnam through 
Laos and this number is rapidly increasing. 
The estimates are that at least seven regi-
ments of regular troops from North Vietnam 
are now in the country with more on the 
way. At the same time the Vietcong have 
in recent months greatly stepped up the re-
cruiting, induction, and training of South 
Vietnamese in the densely populated delta 
region. They have increased their small-
scale attacks in that area, aiming apparently 
at isolated outposts and at demoralizing the 
regional and popular forces as well as har-
assing lines of supply and communication. 
The stepped-up activity of the Vietcong 
in the countryside has been paralleled by 
an effort on the part of the Government 
forces to strengthen their control over the 
population in the base areas and their im-
mediate environs. These base areas them-
selves are held in some force. At the U.S. 
Marine base at Da Nang, for example, the 
perimeter of security has been pushed out 
about 10 miles. The bulk of the U.S. Ma-
rine forces, however, is now preoccupied in 
defense within that perimeter. Nevertheless, 
it is still possible for the Vietcong to bypass 
the defenders and penetrate the area in 
927 
sporadic hit-and-run raids. Communica-
tions between the base areas along the coast 
are still subject to Vietcong ambush and 
attack. 
In Saigon, heavily defended as it is, the 
rattle of automatic weapons fire or the ex-
plosion of mortar shells in the outskirts of 
the city are not uncommon sounds by day 
or by night. Vietcong ability to carry out 
terroristic attacks within the city itself is 
from time to time made evident. Indeed, it 
is considered by some that Saigon with its 
many vulnerabilities to sabotage and terror-
ism and Hanoi with its exposure to air attack 
are mutual hostages, one for the other. 
9. Impact of increased American forces on 
the Vietnamese 
The arrival in Vietnam of American com-
bat troops in large numbers has had an im-
mediate positive psychological effect on Gov-
ernment-held areas. Not only has there been 
an improvement of morale in the Govern-
ment and the Armed Forces, there has also 
been a return of confidence among Viet-
namese civilians. This is especially true in 
Saigon where the increased American pres-
ence is taken as insurance against an immi-
nent collapse of the existing structure.1 
Politically and commercially minded Viet-
namese, seeing that the United States had 
so far committed itself, have found renewed 
courage and confidence. 
Of great significance is the fact that there 
has been a period of Government stability in 
Vietnam following the arrival of additional 
U.S. troops. This stability is more essential - 
than ever for the maintenance of public con-
fidence after the debilitating consequences of 
the repeated coups which followed the assas-
sination of President Diem. It is also vital 
for the effective prosecution of the war and 
the formulation and carrying out of social, 
economic, and political reform programs. 
10. The government of Gen. Nguyen Cao Ky 
The new leadership in Government, which 
is drawn largely from military circles, is 
young and hopeful, but with little knowledge 
of politics. Gen. Nguyen Cao Ky, the Prime 
Minister, recognizes that a purely military 
solution to the problems of Vietnam is not 
possible. Security and social and economic 
reform, in his view, must proceed hand in 
hand in order to gain the support of the 
people. 
The new leaders express the intention of 
moving toward some form of representative 
civilian government, taking into account the 
history and needs of the Vietnamese people. 
They speak of a consultative assembly to pre-
pare the way for a constitution and hearings 
throughout the country on the constitution 
with a view to 'a referendum at the end of 
1966. The referendum, according to their 
concepts, would be followed by elections to a 
legislative body by the end of 1967, if by that 
time elections can be held without intimida-
tion in as much as two-thirds of the country. 
Some observers believe that, perhaps, not 
more than 25 percent of the villages under 
Government control in South Vietnam would 
be free from intimidation at an election at 
the present time. 
In addition to prosecuting the war, the 
Government of Vietnam is seeking to initiate 
measures to protect and improve the welfare 
of the population. With the indispensable 
assistance of U.S. aid, food and other com-
modities are being imported into the country 
to meet current needs and to insure that the 
price of staples such as rice, fish, and canned 
milk remain within the reach of the people. 
1 The illustrative story is told of the Viet-
namese professional man who sold his house 
in Saigon in January of 1965 in despair over 
the deteriorating situation, only to buy back 
the same house later in the year, following 
the arrival of American troops, for twice the 
price at which he had sold it.

11. The pacification or civic action program 
A new effort is also being made to bring the 
people of the villages into closer and firmer 
rapport with the Government. In the period 
following the fall of the government of Ngo 
Dinh Diem, the so-called pacification or civic 
action program which brought government, 
police, economic, and social organization into 
the hamlets, was allowed in large measure to 
lapse. Due to subsequent changes of govern-
ment, there were eventually only a very few 
people left to carry on this work. Military 
necessity required the Government to con-
centrate on attempting to stop Vietcong mili-
tary advances. 
The present Government is once again 
seeking to create an organization to carry out 
a program of pacification or civic action. 
Screening the cadres left from the programs 
of previous governments, a basic group has 
been selected. Together with additional 
groups to be trained it is expected that a total 
number adequate to meet the needs for 
pacification teams in the priority areas 
chosen by the Government of Vietnam will be 
available by the end of 1966. 
The present plan for pacification work is 
regarded by observers as more thorough and 
snore realistic than previous efforts. It con-
templates teams remaining in each village :for 
an initial period of several months with sub-
sequent .followups over a period of at least 1 
year. The belief is that the inhabitants can 
generally be sufficiently won over to the sale 
of the Government in that period and condi-
tions established where elections for local 
officials can be held. It is realized, however, 
that even then the work cannot be consid-
ered as completed. 
17. Other programs 
In addition to giving strong support to the 
pacification program, the new Government 
has numerous other plans to better the lot of 
the people. There are, for example, projects 
to improve the pay of the troops, construct 
low-cost housing, and redistribute land. In 
this connection a program has been inaugu-
ated to give 700,000 acres of land to 180,000 
farmers. It is generally recognized that Gov-
ernment programs of this kind, many of 
which have been attempted in various forms 
before, will require years before any substan-
tial political effect upon the population ran 
be anticipated. 
Economic aspects of the conflict 
The Government of Vietnam has also in-
stituted a resources control program in an 
effort to restrict the Vietcong's ability to get 
the things they need to carry on the war.. In 
most parts of Vietnam, which is a naturally 
rich and productive country, it is not difficult 
to obtain enough food to support life. This 
is particularly true in the fertile and densely 
populated delta of the south with its great 
rice fields and network of interconnecting 
eanals. The Vietcong obtain money by many 
means, including taxation and extortion, and 
they can and do use these funds to purchase 
food in the countryside and medicines in 
district and provincial towns. The Vietcong 
can and do attack trucks and convoys on the 
roads mai seize the weapons, ammunition, 
and the other goods which they may carry. 
By a system of rationing, identity cards, 
and resource control, including checkpoints 
and mobile control teams, however, tne Gov-
ernment hopes to stop the 'Vietcong from 
obtaining key commodities such as food and 
MCCII.CillCS ill key areas such as the highlands, 
which is a deficit region. In other areas it 
is hoped that the system will make goods 
less available for the Vietcong and more diffi-
cult for them to obtain. 
it must be said that there is also a reverse 
side to this picture. The Vietcong, operat-
ing in the countryside, have the ability to 
restrict the flow of food to cities and popula-
tion centers such as Saigon. Vegetables, for 
example, come to Saigon from Dalat in the 
central highlands. Sugar also comes to Sai-
gon along the same road which is controlled 
in part by the Vietcong. It is common 
knowledge that commodities reaching Sai-
gon's markets by road from the Dalat area 
have paid a tax to the Vietcong before reach-
ing the city and that unless the tax is paid 
they will not reach the city. The fact is 
plain: Much of Saigon's indigem us food and 
commodity supply depends on the sufferance 
of the Vietcong and on payments to them. 
The ravages of war and terrorie on however, 
are taking a toll of the country' productive 
capacity Rice fields and rubber plantations 
in areas that are being bombed and fought 
over no longer produce their cm nibution to 
feed the people and to nourish the economy. 
Fledgling enterprises in outlying areas, cut 
off from supplies and from markets by inter-
rupted communications, wither and fail. 
Along with increased Vietcone activity in 
the delta in recent months, there has been 
growing Vietcong restriction on the flow of 
rice from that region to the Saigon market. 
The result is that Vietnam, a rice surplus 
region, in 1966 will have to import at least 
300,000 tons of rice from abroad under U.S. 
aid programs to feed the population of the 
cities and towns under the Government's 
control. 
Although, as has been said, the arrival of 
large numbers of American troeps has gone 
far to restore business confidence in the cities 
cf Vietnam, there have been adverse effects 
as well. One of these is the creation of a 
labor shortage, particularly among skilled 
workers, as men have been drained away 
from normal areas of employment to the 
base complexes and other regions where con-
struction projects are being pushed to create 
the logistic structure and other facilities re-
quired by the American forces. 
Inflationary pressures resulting from the 
war and the changed U.S. role have thus far 
been kept within bounds. Saigon itself, how-
ever, has an overstimulated atmosphere of 
almost hectic prosperity, in some respects, as 
the impact of spending by American service-
men and the effect of U.S. defense expendi-
ture make themselves felt. There are also 
the beginnings of the rumblings of personal 
discontent and antagonism which generally 
characterize the reaction in any nation to 
the sudden infusion of a large bedy of foreign 
forces, 
14. Summation 
In sum, the overall control oh the country 
remains about the same as ie was at the 
beginning of 1965. It is estimated that about 
22 percent of the population is under Viet-
cong control and that about 18 percent in-
habits contested areas. About tiO percent of 
the population in the country it, at present, 
under some form of government control, 
largely because of its hold on Saigon and 
other cities and large towns. 
The population cif the cities ins been aug-
mented by a great number of relugees. Hun-
dreds of thousands in number, they are for 
the greater part composed 0: people who 
have fled to the cities in an effort to escape 
the spreading inte:nsil.y of the war. In this 
sense, they are unlike the refugees who came 
from North Vietnam in 1954. These earlier 
refugees consciously chose -Li leave their 
ancestral homes and come tout a permanent-
ly, rather than accepe a Communist regime. 
the new refugees, for the most part, are 
believed merely to be waiting i or an end to 
the ligating in order to return to their homes 
and land. 
The Vietcong have stepped up sabotage, 
terrorism, and hit and run attacks in the 
Government-held areas which are, principal-
ly, cities and major towns and .ndeterminate, 
but limited, extensions outward from them. 
Harassment by United States :Ind Vietnam-
ese air attack and airborne :forces has in-
creased in the firmly held Vie lcong areas of 
South Vietnam which are almost entirely 
rural. And, of course, North Vietnam has 
been brought under air attack 
January 24, 1966 
In general, however, what the Saigon gov-
ernment held in the way of terrain in the 
early months of 1965 (and it was already 
considerably less than was held at the time 
of the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem), is 
still held. What was controlled then by the 
Vietcong is still controlled by the Vietcong. 
What lay between was contested at the out-
set of 1965 and is still contested. 
IL VIETNAM AND THE NATIONS OF ASIA 
Other nations of Asia generally view the 
conflict in Vietnam with great concern. 
Those countries nearest to Vietnam see in 
the spread and increasing intensity cif the 
warfare a heightened danger of a spillover 
into their territory. They sense that the 
longer the conflict continues and the more 
it escalates the greater becomes this danger 
to themselves. Furthermore, they fear the 
effect upon their own future should all of 
Vietnam become' a Communist state. 
Laos already finds itself deeply although 
unwillingly involved on the fringes of the 
war in Vietnam. The fighting within Laos, 
which continues despite the 1962 Geneva 
Agreement, is now a closely interwoven part 
of the Vietnamese struggle. The connection 
is most pronounced in the eastern part of 
Laos which lies within the control of the 
Communist Pathet Lao forces. This region, 
the so-called Laotian panhandle, is a natural 
infiltration route for men and supplies from 
North Vietnam into South Vietnam. Along 
border abutting on South Vietnam make:. it 
possible for troops and equipment from Ha-
noi to reach far south through Communist-
controlled territory in Laos with a minimum 
of risk before being diverted across the bor-
der into South Vietnam by any number of 
lateral communications routes. New roads 
have been constructed through this :moun-
tainous terrain along which men and sup-
plies can pass, for the most part undetected, 
protected as they are in some regions by 
double canopies of jungle foliage. These 
roads are not easily susceptible to aerial in-
terdiction. 
Cambodia, in a different mariner and to 
a much lesser extent than Laos, is already 
directly touched by the fighting in Vietnam. 
There are repeated charges that Cambodian 
territory is being used as a base for Viet-
cong operations. That is possible in view 
of the remoteness and obscurity of the border 
but there is no firm evidence of any such or-
ganized usage and no evidence whatsocver 
that any alleged usage of Cambodian soil is 
with the sanction much less the assistance 
of the Cambodian Government. Prince Siha-
nouk responded immediately to a recent al-
legation that the Cambodian port of Siha-
noukville is being used to transship supplies 
to the Vietcong by calling for an investiga-
tion by the International Control Commis-
sion which was set up under the Geneva ac-
cords of 1954. 
Cambodia's overwhelming concern is the 
preservation of its national integrity which, 
In times past, has been repeatedly violated 
by more powerful neighbors and is still sub-
ject to occasional forays from a minor dissi-
dent movement (the Khmer Semi) Which has 
been allowed to base itself in the neighbor-
ing nations. Cambodia seeks recognition and 
reepect of its borders by all parties to the 
conflict. It asks to be left to live in peace 
so that it may concentrate on its own prob-
lems and internal development. The Cam-
bodians have made great internal progress, 
largely through their own efforts supple-
mented by a judicious use of aid from the 
United States in the past and from other na-
tions both in the past and at the present 
time. They have a peaceful and productive 
nation with an intense sense of national 
unity and loyalty to Prince Sihanouk. 
The fact that fighting in South Vietnam 
has raged close to the border and there have, 
as a result, been occasional border incursions 
and bombing of Cambodian territory has 
caused the deepest concern to the Cambodian

Government. Cambodia can be expected to 
make the most vigorous efforts to resist be-
coming directly involved in the struggle 
surging through South Vietnam and to re-
pel to the best of its capability direct and 
organized invasions of its territory which may 
stem from the mounting tempo of the war. 
Thailand, the only country on the south-
east Asian mainland directly allied with 
the United States, seeks to cooperate with 
the United States as an ally while avoiding 
a spillover of the war into Thai territory. 
That course is becoming increasingly dif-
ficult to maintain. Thailand has a large 
number of North Tietnamese living in its 
northeast region bordering on Laos. This 
element retains an affinity for Hanoi and is 
susceptible to its influence. Moreover, in 
the recent past Peiping has brought to the 
forefront a Thai leader in exile and has 
increased the intensity of its propaganda 
attacks against Thailand. Reports of ter-
rorism and sabotage in the northeast of 
Thailand are increasing. 
The Vietnamese war was brought very 
close to Thai territory in November 1965. 
A Pathet Lao military thrust toward the 
Laotian town of Thakkek on the Mekong, 
which was supported by North Vietnamese 
troops, was fortuitously driven back by 
Government forces. Had it not been re-
pelled, the war, in effect, w^ul_. have reached 
the point where it made direct contact with 
Tailand's frontier. 
Nations in Asia more geographically re-
mote from the war in South Vietnam are 
nonetheless conscious of the dangers to the 
entire area as the struggle in South Vietnam 
becomes more prolonged and ever more in-
tense. These countries range from neutral 
and nonaligned Burma through such a-lies 
of the United States as the Philippines and 
Japan. 
Each of the countries of Asia has its own 
internal problems. Each has varying degrees 
of internal stability. Each has a principal 
concern, the avoidance of direct involvement 
in the Vietnamese conflict. With the excep-
tion of Korea, there is little likelihood of 
substantial material help from these sources 
in providing military assistance in South 
Vietnam. Others are either unwilling or 
reluctant to become involved in a military 
sense or are unable to do so because of inner 
difficulties or the broader strategic require-
-lents of the Asian situation. Even with 
aspect to Korea, it is obvious that any with-
drawal of forces for use in Vietnam creates 
new problems of military balance as be-
tween North and South Korea. It should 
not be overlooked that peace in the Korean 
peninsula is still held together only by a 
tenuous truce. 
The Asian nations generally are aware of 
their own relative powerlessness to influence 
the main course of events, or, in the final 
analysis, to control their own destinies 
should the conflict in Vietnam ultimately 
develop into a confrontation between the 
United States and Communist China with 
all that such an eventuality might imply 
for the peace of Asia and the world. In 
Japan, for example, there is a deep anxiety 
over the possible consequences to that na-
tion of such a confrontation if it should 
materialize. The memory of the escalation 
of the limited Manchurian incident of 30 
years ago into a seemingly interminable war 
on the mainland of China is not yet dead in 
Japan. 
To sum up, then, the nations of Asia 
recognize the immense importance to them-
selves of what is transpiring in Vietnam. 
But they also recognize their own limitations 
in the face of it. Their immediate preoc-
cupation, in any event, is with their own 
internal problems and development. 
Throughout the area there is a continuing 
interest in activities involving peaceful co-
operation for economic development. The 
Peace Corps is generally welcomed wherever 
It operates and, notably, in the Philippines. 
The new Asian Development Bank is being 
launched with considerable enthusiasm. 
The Mekong project has warm support 
throughout the region and considerable in-
terest in Cambodia, which is central to the 
concept. 
It is clear that none of the nations of the 
area desires the domination of either China 
or the United States. Given a choice, it is 
doubtful that any nation would like to see 
the influence of the United States with-
drawn completely from southeast Asia. 
Generally speaking, the nations of the area 
welcome peaceful ties with the United States 
and our participation in the development of 
the region if that participation does not be-
come overwhelming. 
C. TIIE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE 
Without exception the Soviet Union, Po-
land, and -Rumania give full and firm sup-
port to the position of Hanoi and the Viet-
cong. They are quick in their denunciation 
of the U.S. role in South Vietnam and ve-
hement against U.S. bombing in North 
Vietnam. 
Part -of this solidarity is undoubtedly de-
rived from ideological affinities. Whatever 
attitudes they may manifest toward Com-
munist China, and they vary, it is clear that 
responsibility for the continuation of the 
conflict in Vietnam is assigned to the United 
States and this is regarded as an impediment 
to improvement in political relations with 
this country. 
There is no reason to believe that the 
Soviet Union, in present circumstances, sees 
its way clear or, in fact, is anxious to play 
a significant role to assist in bringing an end 
to hostilities in Vietnam. The Soviet Union 
has steadfastly refused to join with the 
United Kingdom, the other Cochairman of 
the 1954 Geneva Conference, in calling for 
a reconvening of that Conference. They have 
efhphasized repeatedly in public statements 
as well as in other ways that they have no 
intention of taking an initiative for peace 
in Vietnam at this time. 
The countries of Eastern Europe have rea-
son for concern over the continuation of the 
conflict in Vietnam and its escalation. Some 
of these reasons have to do with their own 
national preoccupations and the situation in 
Europe. Both Poland and Rumania, for 
example, have a very substantial trade with 
the Western World and remain interested in 
increased trade with the United States 
should conditions permit. Both might well 
be disposed to make a contribution to a 
settlement of the Vietnam problem to the 
extent their capabilities permit but only 
should they see some possibility of success, 
D. COMMUNIST CHINA 
Behind the war in Vietnam, behind the 
fears and preoccupations of other Asian na-
tions and through the attitudes of the East-
ern European countries and the Soviet Union 
runs the shadow of Communist China. 
Until now the Chinese Communists have 
not introduced their manpower directly into 
the conflict although they clearly recognize 
that the war may reach that point. They 
recognize, too, that the war may impinge 
upon China herself at some point and have 
begun to make preliminary preparations for 
that eventuality. 
For the present, however, the Chinese ap-
pear to take the view that their direct inter-
vention in Vietnam is not required since: (1) 
the war in South Vietnam is a people's war 
which the Vietcong are winning; (2) North 
Vietnam is successfully defending itself; (3) 
the more the United States escalates the war 
the higher our casualties will be and the more 
discouraged we will become; and (4) the 
United States cannot win, in any event, ac-
cording to Chinese theories. 
It is from Communist China that Hanoi 
and the Vietcong derive the bulk of their 
outside material support. It is from Com-
929 
munist China that there has also flowed en-
couragement of resistance to negotiation or 
cOmpromise. As the war escalates and Hanoi 
becomes ever more dependent upon Chinese 
support, a dependence which Soviet aid at 
best only tempers, the likelihood also in-
creases that North Vietnam will not be able 
to negotiate a settlement without at least 
the tacit consent of China. In fact, that 
point may already have been reached. 
E. CONCLUDING COMMENTS 
A rapid solution to the conflict in Vietnam 
is not in immediate prospect. This would 
appear to be the case whether military victory 
is pursued or negotiations do, in fact, ma-
terialize. 
Insofar as the military situation is con-
cerned, the large-scale introduction of U.S. 
forces and their entry into combat has blunt-
ed but not turned back the drive of the Viet-
cong. The latter have responded to the in-
creased American role with a further 
strengthening of their forces by local re-
cruitment in the south and reinforcements 
from the north and a general stepping up of 
military activity. As a result the lines re-
main drawn in South Vietnam in substan-
tially the same pattern as they were at the 
outset of the increased U.S. commitment. 
What has changed basically is the scope and 
intensity of the struggle and the part which 
is being played by the forces of the United 
States and those of North Vietnam. 
Despite the great increase in American 
military commitment, it is doubtful in view 
of the acceleration of Vietcong efforts that 
the constricted position now held in Viet-
nam by the Saigon Government can continue 
to be held for the indefinite future, let alone 
extended, without a further augmentation 
of American forces on the ground. Indeed, 
if present trends continue, there is no assur-
ance as to what ultimate increase in Ameri-
can military commitment will be required 
before the conflict is terminated. For the 
fact is that under present terms of reference 
and as the war has evolved, the question is 
not one of applying increased U.S. pressure 
to a defined military situation but rather of 
pressing against a military situation which 
is, in effect, open ended. How open is de-
pendent on the extent to which North Viet-
nam and its supporters are willing and able 
to meet increased force by increased force. 
All of mainland southeast Asia, at least, can-
not be ruled out as a potential battlefield. 
As noted, the war has already expanded sig-
nificantly into Laos and is beginning to lap 
over the Cambodian border while pressures 
increase in the northeast of Thailand. 
Even if the war remains substantially 
within its present limits, there is little foun-
dation for the expectation that the Govern-
ment of Vietnam in Saigon will be able, in 
the near future, to carry a much greater bur-
den than it is now carrying. This is in no 
sense a reflection on the caliber of the current 
leaders of Vietnam. But the fact is that they 
are, as other Vietnamese Governments have 
been over the past decade, at the beginning 
of a beginning in dealing with the problems 
of popular mobilization in support of the 
Government. They are starting, moreover, 
from a point considerably behind that which 
prevailed at the time of President Diem's 
assassination.- Under present concepts and 
plans, then, what lies ahead is, literally, a 
vast and continuing undertaking in social 
engineering in the wake of such military 
progress as may be registered. And for many 
years to come this task will be very heavily 
dependent. on U.S. foreign aid. 
The basic concept of present American 
policy with respect to Vietnam casts the 
United States in the role of support of the 
Vietnamese Government and people. This 
concept becomes more difficult to maintain 
as the military participation of the United 
States undergoes rapid increase. Yet a 
change in the basic -concept could have a

most unfortunate impact upon the -Viet-
namese people and the world at large. What 
la involved here is the necessity for the great-
est restraint in word and action, lest the con-
cept be eroded and the war drained of a pur-
pose with meaning to the people of Vietnam. 
This danger is great, not only because 
of the military realities of the situation but 
aleo because, witn a few exceptions, assist-
ance has not been and is not likely to be 
forthcoming tor the war effort in South 
Vietnam from nations other than the United 
States. On the contrary, as it now appears, 
the longer the war continues in its present 
pattern and the more it expands in scope, the 
greater will become the strain placed upon 
the relations of the United States with allies 
bOth. iii the Far East and in. Europe. 
Many nations are deeply desirous of an 
end to this conflict as quickly as possible. 
Few are specific as to the manner in which 
this end can be brought about or the shape 
it is likely to take. in any event, even 
though other nations, in certain circum-
stances, may be willing to play a third-party 
role in bringing about negitiations, any pros-
pects for effective negotiations at this time 
(and they are slim) are likely to be largely 
dependent on the initiatives and efforts of 
the combatants. 
Negotiations at this time, moreover, if 
they do come about, and if they are ac-
companied by a cease-fire and standfast, 
would serve to stabilize a situation in which 
the majority of the population remains un-
der nominal government control but in which 
dominance of the countryside rests largely 
in the hands of the Vietcong. What might 
eventually materialize through negotiations 
from this situation cannot be foremen at 
this time with any degree of certainty. 
That is not, to say the least, a very satis-
factory prospect What needs also to be 
borne in mina, however, is that th.e visible 
alternative at this time and under present 
terms of reference is the indefinite expan-
sion and intensification of the war which 
will require the continuous introduction of 
additional U.S. forces. The end of that 
course cannot be foreseen, either, and there 
arc no grounds for optimism that the end is 
likely to be reached within the confines of 
South Vietnam or within the very near 
future. 
In sort, such choices as may be open are 
not simple choices. They are difficult and 
painful choices and they are beset with 
many imponderables. The situation, as it 
now appears, offers only the very slim pros-
pect of a just settlement by negotiations or 
the alternative prospect of a continuance 
of the conflict in the direction of a general 
war on the Asian mainland. 
ADMIRAL RICKOVER WRITES 
ABOUT LEWIS AND CLARK 
Mr. MUNDT. Madam President, one 
of America's most imaginative and active 
minds belongs to the eminent naval offi-
cer, Adm. H. G. Rickover. He possesses 
many talents. He has a wide range of 
interests. No matter on what subject 
he writes or talks, he is always able to 
interpret the information in a colorful 
and interesting way. 
During the congressional recess, I re-
ceived a leter from Admiral Rickover, 
written in the North Atlantic, aboard the 
U.S.S. Lewis and Clark, our new nuclear 
submarine. 'This is our 33d nuclear sub-
marine, Admiral Rickover reported, and, 
added to the fleet of 22 other attack-type 
submarines, brings our total attack fleet 
to 55. 
However, the very interesting part of 
the admiral's letter was a review of the 
RECORD ? SENATE January 24, P)66 
/tCCOMpilishments of Meriwether Lewis 
and William Clark, the famous explorers 
who traveled through the area which now 
comprises my home State, as well as all 
the States adjacent to the Missouri River. 
Admiral Rickover gives a condensed re-
view of the travels of Lewis and Clark in 
a most vivid manner. Because I fee 'I that 
not enough is known about these iamous 
explorers, or what they hoped to do and 
what they actually did do, I asked Ad-
miral Rickover for permission?which I 
have received--to place his letter in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD where I am sure 
st will be read by many persons hereto-
fore unfamiliar with a great part of our 
American history and heritage. 
ask unanimous consent thiTit this 
letter be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the letter 
was ordered to be printed in the RTCORD, 
as follows: 
AT SEA, U.S.S. "LEWIS AND CLAIM" 
(SSBN-644), 
North Atlantic, November 16, 965. 
Ron. KARL E. MUNDT, 
U.S. Senate. 
DEAR SENATOR MUNDT: We have jl.tiL suc-
cessfully completed the first sea trials of the 
U.S.S. Lewis and Clark, our 33d Polaris nu-
clear submarine. We also have in operation 
22 attack type nuclear submarines, making 
a, total of 55. The Lewis and Clark built 
by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry 
Dock CO., Newport News, Va. 
This ship is named for Meriwether Lewis 
(1774-1809) and William Clark (1770-1883), 
the Virginia-born captains under whose joint 
command a small American Army unit (3 
sergeants, 24 men, 1 Indian, and 2 French 
Canadian interpreters) crossed fr:iim St. 
Louis to the mouth of the Columbia River 
and back, thus competing one of the great 
transcontinental voyages of expli iration, 
ranking in importance with those of Balboa 
(1513) and Mackenzie (1793). 
Planned and personally supervised Peas-
if-lent Jefferson, the expedition had as its ob-
jective exploration of "the, Missouri River, 
and such principal streams of it, as, by its 
course and coMmunication with the waters 
of the Pacific Ocean * * * may oiler the 
most direct and practicable water communi-
cation across this continent." If such a 
water route could be found, much of the lu-
crative fur trade, then largely in C.madian 
hands, might be diverted to American sea-
ports. The President had long been inter-
ested in exploring this possibility; had, in 
fact, given aid to three previous al tempts 
that came to nothing. He obtained from 
the Congress authorization and am: initial 
grant of $2,500 in January 1803, a few 
months before the uncharted territory to 
be traversed by Lewis and Clark passed into 
our possession through the Louisiana Pur-
chase. The expedition got underway, May 
1804, in a bateau and two pirogues and did 
not return until nearly 21/2 years is ,or. 
It is difficult for us to realize the impor-
tance of water transportation in those days. 
Men, were inclined to believe certain naviga-
ble routes most exist simply because they so 
ardently whined that they should exist. 
Thus, the hope of reaching the Orient by 
sailing westward was not relinquished even 
after it became known that the American 
land mass stood as a barrier between the 
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; this hope was 
merely transferred northward to the inland 
waterways of North America, where for 300 
years Spaniards, Frenchmen, and English-
men diligently searched for the mythical 
Northwest Passage first postulated by 1/errs-
sane in 1524. To discover this passage was 
one of the avowed objects of the Hudson 
Bay Co. 
Some envisaged it as a strait across Can-
ada at the latitude of Hudson Bay, others as 
a comingling of the headwaters of major 
eastward and westward flowing rivers. Both 
versions of the myth were inscribed, as late 
as 1767, in Jonathan Carver's map ol 
America. Explorers kept the myth alive by 
asserting as fact what was pure fantasy, 
Thus, in. 1765, Robert Rogers stated cate-
gorically that between the sources cif the 
Missouri and the great river of the west the 
portage was not above 30 miles. His river of 
the west was pure figment of the imagine-
than but, oddly enough, speculation placed 
it near the actual location of the Columbia. 
No one then knew of the Rocky Mountains 
or imagined that such a barrier might divide 
America's eastern and western rivers. 
t must be counted a major gain, of the 
Lewis and Clark expedition that it laid to 
rest forever the myth of a navigable passage 
across the continent. It established, by ac-
tual observation, that the sources of the 
Missouri and Columbia lay too far apart for 
an easy portage and that neither river was 
truly navigable in its upper reaches. A feas-
ible route from St. Louis to the Pacific was, 
indeed, mapped out, but 430 miles of it ran 
overland through rugged terrain, and the 
3,555 miles by river were part way navigable 
by canoe only. Not until a century later did 
Amundsen find the only true Northwest 
Passage which does not, of course, bisect the 
continent but runs along Baffin Island 
-through the Arctic Ocean. In 1960, the nu-
clear submarine Scadrapon traversed the 
passage underwater. 
If then the Lewis and Clark expedition 
could find no natural and easy cross-
continental water route, it accomplished 
what in the end proved more important: It 
greatly strengthened our claim to the Oregon 
Territory, originally based on the discovery of 
the Columbia River in 1792 by Capt. Robert 
Gray of the American ship Columbia Recli-
viva. Over the route mapped by Lewis and 
Clark soon came American trappers, and in 
1811 Fort Astoria was built at the mouth of 
the Columbia, the first permanent settle-
ment in the Oregon country. 
America won the race to the Pacific by a 
hair's breadth, for Canadian traders were 
fast approaching the coast. Mackenzie had 
traversed Canada from Lake Athabaska to 
the mouth of the Bella Coola as early as 
1793, Simon Fraser came down the rive 
named i'or him in 1808, and David Thomp-
son followed part of the Lewis and Clark 
route in 1811. When he reached the mouth 
of the Columbia, he saw the American flag 
flying over Fort Astoria- it had been raised 
but a few months earlier. As the historian 
John Bakeless writes: "Because of the Corps 
of Discovery, Oregon is American today. 
And 10 white stars in the blue field of Old 
Glory stand for States of the Union that one 
by one grew up in the farms and mills, 
cities and homesteads, along the trail where 
weary men in tattered elk-skin cursed the 
rocks that tore their feet, sweated at the 
tow rope, poled against the savage current 
of the muddy Missouri, stumbled in the 
chilly streams of the Rockies, and staggered 
down the western end of the Lob o Trail." 
It had been a hard journey and a long one. 
When Clark wrote in his diary, November 7. 
1805, "Ocean in view. Oh joy." the weary 
explorers doubtless felt much the same tri-
umph and relief as the men on the three 
small Spanish caravels when they heard the 
lookout on the Pinta cry "Tierra! Tierra!" 
Charting a course-4,000 miles each way-
through unknown territory inhabited lay 
numerous, often hostile Indians, surely was 
difficult enough, but many other tasks were 
imposed on Lewis and Clark by Jefferson. 
Ile instructed them to keep a daily record 
of the weather and an accurate description 
of the route traversed; to ascertain "by ce-
lestial observation, the geography of the 
country"; describe in detail its fauna, flora

portance and I believe it deserves an 
explanation. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I was informed by 
the distinguished chairman of the Com-
mittee on Armed Services this morning 
that this was a bill which had to be 
considered in relation to the loaning of 
one destroyer and one destroyer escort 
from the reserve fleet to the Republic of 
China. 
The purpose, according to the report 
would be to authorize that loan, and, 
quoting from the report: 
The loan of these vessels is intended to 
give the Republic of China an increased 
capability to defend her contiguous waters 
against aggressive acts and to augment the 
free world naval forces in the western Pacific. 
Is that enough information for the 
Senator? 
Mr. COOPER. It is an explanation; 
and I believe it is good that it has been 
made. As I understand, this is a loan 
of a destroyer and a destroyer escort to 
the Republic of China? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. The Senator is 
correct. A full report will be incor-
porated in the RECORD. 
CONSERVATION?AND DESERVED 
RECOGNITION TO SENATOR 
CHURCH, OF IDAHO 
Mr. MOSS. Madam President, con-
servation is everyone's business. Unfor-
tunately, too few Americans make it 
their business. As a result, the task of 
preserving our natural resources?of de-
veloping them but not exploiting them?
has fallen on a few dedicated persons in 
both public and private life. 
We in the West, enriched as we are 
ith an abundance of magnificent natu-
ral wealth and beauty, are probably more 
aware of the need for balanced develop-
ment of our natural resources than any 
other section of the country. 
I am proud of the fact that our western 
congressional delegatidns have initiated 
and supported most of the great conser-
vation measures that exist today. Last 
week, I was privileged to vote in support 
of another of the great pieces of legisla-
tion aimed at preserving for future gen-
erations, portions of America's rich heri-
tage of splendor. 
In voting for Senate passage of the 
national wild rivers system bill, I also 
acknowledged the outstanding leader-
ship that my distinguished colleague, the 
senior Senator from Idaho [Mr. 
CHURCH], has played in so many conser-
vation efforts. 
Conservation means far more than 
simple preservation. Wise use and man-
agement of our resources rank equally 
with wise preservation and management 
and in both fields. FRANK CHURCH has 
been the one who has shown the way and 
lighted our legislative steps. A half 
dozen great dams and reclamation proj-
ects bear the imprint of his effort, along 
with many other smaller projects. He 
has battled for continued and increased 
soil conservation measures and has 
pleaded for additional funds to open up 
our great western forests for larger tim-
ber outputs and for greater recreational 
uses. 
No. 9-9 
As sponsor of the Wilderness Act, the 
Nez Perce National Historic Park bill, 
and the wild rivers bill, and as floor man-
ager for the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund Act, he has assured our grand-
children and our great grandchildren 
that segments of the American natural 
heritage will be theirs to enjoy, even as 
it has been ours. 
It is fitting, Madam President, that we 
should recognize the effort and dedica-
tion of our distinguished colleague from 
the State of Idaho. It is even More sat-
isfying to know that others appreciate 
his work and look to him as a champion 
of the cause of conservation. It is to the 
latter events that I direct the interest of 
the Senate. 
On December 20, 1965, the Senator 
from Idaho was named the Idaho Con-
servationist of the Year by the Idaho 
Wildlife Federation. In appropriate 
ceremonies in Boise, Idaho, the Gover-
nor of Idaho, the Honorable Robert E. 
Smylie presented the Senator with the 
annual Governor's Award. Governor 
Smylie noted at that time a fact that we 
in the Senate have long known, that 
conservation is truly a bipartisan matter. 
As the result of that award, the Sen-
ator from Idaho then became a finalist 
In the National Wildlife Federation an-
nual competition for outstanding con-
servation honors. 
On January 11, 1966, at the annual 
banquet of the National Wildlife Federa-
tion at the Hotel Statler Hilton, here in 
Washington, D.C., the Senator from 
Idaho [Mr. CHURCH] received the Na-
tional Conservation Legislative Award 
from the hands of the First Lady of our 
country. This came only moments after 
Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson had herself, re-
ceived the Federation's National Dis-
tinguished Service Award. The citation 
to the Senator from Idaho with the 
award read as follows: 
For significant congresssional leadership in 
the creation of the national wilderness pre-
servation system and for exceptional states-
manship and skill in focusing public atten-
tion on the need for preserving wild rivers, 
parks, and outdoor recreation areas. 
Madam President, the senior -Senator 
from Idaho has brought great honor to 
himself. But in so doing, he has reflected 
credit upon every Member of this body. 
We who have served with him during the 
years that the wilderness bill was de-
bated, the Nez Perce National Historical 
Park was created, the wild rivers bill 
passed by the Senate and a host of other 
measures, have been termed "Conserva-
tion Congressmen" by our fellow Amer-
icans. If we are truly worthy of this 
honor, Madam President, it is because 
our able colleague, Mr. CHURCH, has 
guided our thoughts and actions. 
TI3LIETNAM.".00NFLICT: THE SUB-
STANCEAND THE SHADOW 
Mr. MUSKIE. Madam President, last 
fall it was my privilege to be a member of 
what has since been described in the 
press as the Mansfield mission. 
Under the distinguished leadership of 
Senator MANSFIELD, it was our objective, 
In his words, "to look, to listen, to ask 
questions, and to report" to the President 
and the Senate. 
In this factfinding process we engaged 
in some 50 formal discussions with the 
leaders of the countries we visited and 
with our representatives in those coun-
tries. 
For us, as Senators, it was an inval-
uable opportunity to observe conditions 
In those countries, to hear firsthand the 
reaction of their leaders to our policies, 
to state and clarify U.S. positions, and 
to get in-depth briefings from American 
representatives in the field. 
Our approach to our mission was sim-
ple: First, to discuss any subject, any 
problem, any issue, any point of friction 
raised by our hosts; second, to state and 
to clarify, to the best of our ability, any 
American policy involved; third, to con-
sider, evaluate, and report to the Presi-
dent any suggestion, express or implied, 
to deal more effectively with any prob-
lem; and fourth, to note any possibility, 
however vague or remote, for moving 
toward a reduction of friction. 
This approach led to discussions of a 
wide range of subjects in almost every 
country. The list included few, if any, 
surprises. The one subject which arose 
in every instance was Vietnam. 
I take this opportunity to pay a per-
sonal tribute to the effective and able 
leadership of Senator MANSFIELD in de-
veloping the maximum utility of this 
kind of J nission. His dignified and cour-
teous, but "no nonsense" approach to 
our discussions was received with respect 
and frankness from our hosts, without 
exception. In my judgment, he made 
a major contribution to better under-
standing, in places where such under-
standing is important, of our country's 
Purposes, intentions, and motivations. 
The wise and distinguished Senator 
from Vermont, Senator AIKEN, per-
formed an invaluable service as "co-
leader" of the mission. He was a never-
failing source of good counsel and sound 
judgment. 
The intelligent, hard working, and 
dedicated work of my good friends, Sen-
ator CALEB BOGGS, of Delaware, and Sen-
ator DANIEL INOUYE, of Hawaii, com-
pleted the team of which I was proud to 
be a member. 
The report of our mission has received 
wide attention and comment. Many de-
scriptive labels have been attached to it. 
It was our purpose to produce a report 
which was, above all else, "realistic." It 
is the hope, I am sure, of each of us that 
the report may contribute to a sound 
understanding of the realities upon 
which to base the serious decisions we 
face. 
Because there is such widespread in-
terest in the report, Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that excerpts 
from the report be printed at this point 
In the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the excerpts 
from the report were ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD, as follows: 
THE VIETNAM CONFLICT : THE SUBSTANCE AND 
THE SHADOW 
A. VIETNAM: THE SUBSTANCE OF WAR 
1. Introductory 
The most important new factor in the war 
in Vietnam has been the introduction of

908 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE January 24, 1966 
large numbers of U.S. troops into South Viet-
nam and their direct entry into combat. 
This augmentation of the U.S. military role 
in Vietnam was a response to a near-desper-
ate situation early in 1965. There is no 
question that the Government of Vietnam 
in Saigon wits laced with a rapidly deteri-
orating position at that time. 
Alter the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem, 
repeated coups had weakened the cohesive-
ness of the central authority and acted to 
stimulate public disaffection and indiffer-
ence to the war. At the same time, there 
was a greatly accelerated military drive by 
strengthened Vietcong forces. Their con-
trol expanded over large areas of the coun-
try, particularly in provinces adjacent to the 
western beaters. Communications and 
transportation between population centers 
becaine increasingly hazardous, except by 
Vietcong sufferance. In short, a total col-
lapse of the Saigon Government's authority 
appeared imminent in the early months of 
1965. 
11.11. combat troops in strength arrived at 
that point in response to the appeal of the 
Saigon authorities. The Vietcong counter 
response was to increase their military ac-
tivity with forces strengthened by intensified 
local recruitment and infiltration of regular 
North Vietnamese troops. With the change 
in the composition of opposing forces the 
character of the war also changed sharply. 
2. Military forces of the Government of 
Vietnam 
The CInvernment of Vietnam now has aps 
proximately 635,000 men under arms. Of 
this number, however, only about 300,000 are 
regular troops of the Army, Navy, Air Force, 
and Marines, with about 88 percent being 
Army troops. A general reserve of six air-
borne battalions and five marine battalions 
is equipped to fight anywhere in the 
cituntry. 
The Vie t na mese Government has six 
tighter-bomber squadrons. It also has a 
email navy, composed of sea, river, and 
coastal forces. 
In the total of 635,000 men there are also 
regional forces of about 120,000 men which 
act as a constabulary in the 43 Provinces. 
leach Province chief, who has a military as 
well as a civil capacity, has a number of 
regional force companies under his com-
mand.. Popular forces number about 140,-
000. Lightly armed, this group is recruited 
as a rule Irom local youth to act as de-
fenders of villages and hamlets. A civilian 
irregular defense group is recruited by the 
Vietnamese Special Forces. It numbers 
about 25,000 and is posted in border areas 
for patrol purposes. Finally, there is a na-
tional police of about 50,000 men. 
The total of 635,000 men in all categories 
is expected to be expanded in the current 
year, although a substantial increase is not 
anticipated. The sources of expanded re-
cruitment :ire not great and, in any event, 
are shared with the Vietcong. Moreover, a 
high desertion rate continues, despite de-
termined efforts to reduce it. 
a. U.S. and international forces in Vietnam 
1.0 1962, U.S. military advisers and service 
forces in South Vietnam totaled approxi-
mately 10.000 men. This number had in - 
ereaned by May of 1965 to about 34,000. At 
that time tile American force was still basic-
ally an advisory organization. Americans, ln 
regular combat units, were not yet engaged 
im the ground. U.S. helicopter companies 
were in use but only to supply tactical trans-
portation to regular Vietnamese units and 
the U.S. jet lighter-bombers in the country 
With the exception of two or three squadrons 
of aircraft were not yet engaged in support 
of the Vietnamese Armed Forces. 
By December 1965. however, there were ap-
proximately 170,000 U.S. troops in South 
Vietnam. Additionally, there were about 
21,000 soldiers and marines from the itepublic 
of Korea an infantry battalion and a battery 
of artillery, comprising some 1,200 mon, from 
Australia, and a New Zealand artillery bat-
tery of about 150 men. 
'The augmented U.S. ground forces were 
composed of two Army divisions, the 1st In-
fantry Division and the let Air Cavalry Di-
vision, and two separate brigades, the 1st 
Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, and the 
173d Airborne Brigade. The Australian and 
New Zealand troops were attached to the 
latter group. A full U.S. Marine die ision re-
inforced by a separate regiment was in Viet-
nam with the support of six Marine fighter-
bomber squadrons. 
The small Vietnamese coastal ii gee was 
augmented by a number of U.S. eel ships 
and Coast Guard vessels. The U.S. 7th Fleet 
was off the Vietnamese coast. Plies from 
its carriers were active in the air unpaign 
against North Vietnam.. They were also re-
inforcing the U.S. Air Force and Vietnamese 
fighter-bomber squadrons in open, lions in 
South Vietnam.. 
Ten U.S. Air Force and Marine fighter-
bomber squadrons were operating f tom five 
jet airfields in Vietnam; a sixth deld was 
under construction. B--52 bombers from 
Guam were providing additional air strength, 
concentrating on more remote Vietcong bases 
which had previously been immune to harass-
ment or attack. 
The magnitude of the expanded U.S. mili-
tary effort has required a vastly enlarged 
support complex. Starting aIm st from 
scratch in :May of 1965, a logistic system has 
been built. There are four major logistic 
support areas. One is in the Saigon region, 
including Bien boa and Vung Tau. The 
other three are located along the coast, at 
Cam :Ranh Bay, at Qui Nhon in Binh Dinh 
Province, and at Da Nang. The rapid infu-
sion of American forces has strained the fa-
cilities of the new logistic system Jo the ut-
most, with long delays in unloeding and 
moving equipment not unusual. There have 
also been and still are shortages isf import-
ant items of supply despite efforts to elimi-
nate these shortages. 
4. Relationship of United States and Viet-
namese forces 
From the point of view of Amer. 'an policy 
and practice, the war itself remains a Viet-
namese war. The American command em-
phasizes that U.S. forces in Vietnam are 
there to support the Vietnamese and their 
Armed Forces in the effort to resist aggres-
sion by infiltration from the nor tii and ter-
roism and subversion from wittin. Viet-
namese sovereignty and the paramount role 
of the Vietnamese are meticulously respected 
and the supporting nature of the U.S. role 
is stressed. 
There is no combined or unified command 
of the international lorces in Vietnam. 
United States and Vietnamese forces work 
together through coordination and coopera-
tion. The commander of the U.S. forces 
maintains close liaison with the Vietnamese 
Minister of Defense and the Chief of the 
Joint General Staff. Strategy and plans are 
devised together. Parallel instructions are 
then issued to the respective commanders 
through corps and division to regimental 
level. In the execution of an operation a 
joint command post is set up or liaison offi-
cers are exchanged and terrain is armor tinned 
for tactical areas of operation. According 
to American military commanders these ar-
rangements have proved to be practical and 
workable. 
5. Vietcong-North Vietnames- forces 
In December 1965, the best available esti-
mates placed Vietcong strength in South 
Vietnam at 230,000 men. This figure is 
double that of 3 years ago. Total Vietcong 
stre:ngth, apparently, is steadily increasing 
despite the serious casualties which these 
forces have suffered during the past few 
months. 
Of the present total, approximately 73,000 
are main force soldiers, including 14,000 reg-
ular PAVN (People's Army of North Vietnam) 
troops from North Vietnam. The Vietcong 
forces also include about 100,000 militia, 
some 17,000 support troops who operate along 
lines of communication, and approximately 
10,000 political cadres. It is estimated that 
the Vietcong, through local recruitment in 
the south and infiltrated from the north, 
have the capability of a substantial increase 
in their numbers within a short period of 
time. 
Infiltration of men from North Vietnam 
through Laos has been going on for many 
years. It was confined primarily ta political 
cadres and military leadership until about 
the end of 1964 when North Vietnam Regu-
lar Army troops began to enter South Viet-
nam by this route. It is anticipated that 
with the multiplication of routes through 
Laos the rate of infiltration is likely to in-
crease threefold from the present estimated 
1,500 per month. The monsoon, which earlier 
was considered to be of great significance 
in its effect on the reinforcement capabili-
ties of the Vietcong as well as on the ability 
of both sides to prosecute the war, has proved 
in experience to be of minor consequence if, 
Indeed, of any consequence at all. 
6. Current state of the war 
By November 1965, American troops were 
directly involved in battle to a much greater 
degree than at any other time in the history 
of the Vietnamese conflict. At the same 
time, the intensity of the war itself reached 
a new high. The Vietcong initiated 1,038 
incidents du:ring the last week of November 
and the total number of incidents which had 
increased steadily throughout 1965, reached 
3,588 in that month. These incidents involved 
armed attacks up to regimental strength as 
well as terrorism and sabotage of various 
kinds and antiaircraft fire against U.S. air-
craft. In the later months of 1965 the trend 
was toward larger attacks, except in the 
Mekong Delta where there were n.umerous 
small-scale actions. 
With the increase in the intensity of the 
conflict, there were increased numbers ol 
casualties among all participants. In the 
month of November 1965, alone, 469 Ameri-
cans were killed in action, a figure repre-
senting about 35 percent of all Americans 
killed in action in the war until that date. 
In addition, 1,470 Americans were listed as 
wounded and 33 as missing. During tile 
same month the South Vietnamese Army re-
ported 936 soldiers killed in action, 2,030 
wounded, and 355 missing. The Vietcong, 
for their part, are estimated to have lost 
5,300 men killed in the month and, in addi-
tion, 595 were taken prisoner. Many of these 
casualties were regulars of the North Viet-
namese Army. 
7. The security situation in South Vietnam 
The presence of U.S. combat forces has 
acted to arrest the deterioration in general 
security in Government-controlled parts of 
South Vietnam. It has also improved the 
ability of the Vietnamese Government to 
hold Saigon, the strategic heart of the coun-
try, the coastal bases, and certain other key 
areas in the country. In the latter connec-
tion, it should be noted that a strategic route 
(19) from the coast to the western highlands 
has been reopened for convoyed ground traf-
fic to Pleiku, a major military strongpoint iii 
the western highlands. On certain other 
roads, an improvement in security is also 
reported. 
8. Vietcong reactions 
Faced by a blunting of their military ef-
forts. the Vietcong have reacted strongly to 
the new situation. Beginning in June an 
estimated 1,500 North Vietnamese troops pr 
month have entered South Vietnam through

January 24, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
Laos and this number is rapidly increasing. 
The estimates are that at least seven regi-
ments of regular troops from North Vietnam 
are now in the country with more on the 
way. At the same time the Vietcong have 
in recent months greatly stepped up the re-
cruiting, induction, and training of South 
Vietnamese in the densely populated delta 
region. They have increased their small-
scale attacks in that area, aiming apparently 
at isolated outposts and at demoralizing the 
regional and popular forces as well as harass-
ing lines of supply and communication. 
The stepped-up activity of the Vietcong in 
the countryside has been paralleled by an 
effort on the part of the Government forces 
to strengthen their control over the popula-
tion in the base areas and their immediate 
environs. These base areas themselves are 
held in some force. At the U.S. Marine base 
at Da Nang, for example, the perimeter of 
security has been pushed out about 10 miles. 
The bulk of U.S. Marine forces, however, is 
now preoccupied in defense within that pe-
rimeter. Nevertheless, it is still possible for 
the Vietcong to bypass the defenders and 
penetrate the area in sporadic hit-and-run 
raids. Communications between the base 
areas along the coast are still subject to 
Vietcong ambush and attack. 
In Saigon, heavily defended as it is, the 
rattle of automatic weapons fire or the ex-
plosion of mortar shells in the outskirts of 
the city are not uncommon sounds by day 
or by night. Vietcong ability to carry out 
terroristic attacks within the city itself is 
from time to time made evident. Indeed, it 
is considered by some that Saigon with its 
many vulnerabilities to sabotage and terror-
ism and Hanoi with its exposure to air at-
tack are mutual hostages, one for the other. 
9. Impact of increased American forces on 
the Vietnamese 
The arrival in Vietnam of American com-
bat troops in large numbers has had an 
immediate positive psychological effect on 
Government-held areas. Not only has there 
been an improvement of morale in the Gov-
ernment and the armed forces, there has 
also been a return of confidence among Viet-
namese civilians. This is especially true in 
Saigon where the increased American pres-
ence is taken as insurance against an immi-
nent collapse of the existing structure? 
Politically and commercially minded Viet-
namese, seeing that the United States had 
so far committed itself, have found renewed 
courage and confidence. ? 
Of great significance is the fact that there 
Las been a period of government stability in 
Vietnam following the arrival of additional 
U.S. troops. This stability is more essential 
than ever for the maintenance of public 
confidence after the debilitating oonse-
quences of the repeated coups which fol-
lowed the assassination of President Diem. 
It is also vital for the effective prosecution 
of war and the formulation and carrying out 
of social, economic, and political reform 
programs. 
10. The government of Gen. Nguyen Cao Ky 
The new leadership in government which 
is drawn largely from military circles is 
young and hopeful, but with little knowl-
edge of politics. Gen. Nguyen Cao Ky, the 
Prime Minister, recognizes that a purely 
military solution to the problems of Vietnam 
is not possible. Security and social and 
economic reform, in his view, must proceed 
hand in hand in order to gain the support 
of the people. 
The new leaders express the intention 
of moving toward some form of representa-

tive civilian government, taking into ac-
count the history and needs of the Viet-
namese people. They speak of a consultative 
assembly to prepare the way for a consti-
tution and hearings throughout the coun-
try on the cons titution with a view to a 
referendum at the end of 1966. The refer-
endum, according to their concepts, would 
be followed by elections to a legislative body 
by the end of 1967, if by that time elections 
can be held without intimidation in as much 
as two-thirds of the country. Some ob-
servers believe that, perhaps, not more than 
25 percent of the villages under government 
control in South Vietnam would be free 
from intimidation at an election at the 
present time. 
In addition to prosecuting the war, thls. 
Government of Vietnam is seekinzo, to initiate 
measures to protect and improve the wel-
fare of the population. With the indis-
pensable assistance of U.S. aid, food and 
other commodities are being imported into 
the country to meet current needs and to 
Insure that the price of staples such as rice, 
fish, and canned milk remain within the 
reach of the people. 
11. The pacification or civic action program 
A new effort is also being made to bring 
the people of the villages into closer and 
firmer rapport with the government. In 
the period following the fall of the govern-
ment of Ngo Dinh Diem, the so-called pacifi-
cation or civic action program which brought 
government, police, economic, and social 
organization into the hamlets, was allowed 
in large measure to lapse. )ue to subse-
quent changes of government, there were 
eventually only a very few people left to 
carry on this work. Military necessity re-
quired the government to concentrate on 
attempting to stop Vietcong military 
advances. 
The present Government is once again seek-
ing to create an organization to carry out a 
program of pacification or civic action. 
Screening the cadres left from the programs 
of previous governments, a basic group 
has been selected. Together with additional 
groups to be trained it is expected that a 
total number adequate to meet the needs for 
pacification teams in the priority areas 
chosen by the Government of Vietnam will be 
available by the end of 1966. 
The present plan for pacification work is 
regarded by observerers as more thorough 
and more realistic than previous efforts. It 
contemplates teams remaining in each vil-
lage for an initial period of several months 
with subsequent followups over a period of 
at least 1 year. The belief is that the in-
habitants can generally be sufficiently won 
over to the side of the Government in that 
period and conditions established where elec-
tions for local officials can be held. It is 
realized, however, that even then the work 
cannot be considered as completed. 
12. Other programs 
In addition to giving strong support to 
the pacification program, the new Govern-
ment has numerous other plans to better 
the lot of the people. There are, for ex-
ample, projects to improve the pay of the 
troops, construct low-cost housing, and re-
distribute land. In this connection a pro-
gram has been inaugurated to give 700,000 
acres of land to 180,000 farmers. It is gen-
erally recognized that Government programs 
of this kind, many of which have been at-
tempted in various forms before, will re-
quire years before any substantial political 
effect upon the population can be an-
ticipated. 
13. Econoinic aspects of the conflict 
The Government of Vietnam has also in-
stituted a resources control program in an 
effort to restrict the Vietcong's ability to get 
the things they need to carry on the war. In 
most parts of Vietnam, which is a naturally 
rich and productive country, it is not diffi-
cult to obtain enough food to support life. 
909 
This is particularly true in the fertile and 
densely populated delta of the south with 
its great rice fields and network of inter-
connecting canals. The Vietcong obtain 
money by many means, including taxation 
and extortion, and they can and do use these 
funds to purchase food in the countryside 
and medicines in district and Provincial 
towns. The Vietcong can and do attack 
trucks and convoys on the roads and seize the 
weapons, ammunition, and the other goods 
which they may carry. 
By a system of rationing, identity cards, 
and resource control, including checkpoints 
and mobile control teams, however, the Gov-
ernment hopes to stop the Vietcong from 
obtaining key commodities such as food and 
medicines in key areas such as the highlands, 
which is a deficit region. In other areas it 
is hoped that the system will make goods 
less available for the Vietcong and more diffi-
cult for them to obtain. 
It must be said that there is also a re-
verse side to this picture. The Vietcong, 
operating in the countryside, have the abil-
ity to restrict the flow of food to cities and 
population centers such as Saigon. Vegeta-
bles, for example, come to Saigon from Dalat 
in the central highlands. Sugar also comes 
to Saigon along the same road which is con-
trolled in part by the Vietcong. It is com-
mon knowledge that commodities reaching 
Saigon's markets by road from the Dalat 
area have paid a tax to the Vietcong before 
reaching the city and that unless the tax is 
paid they will not reach the city. The fact 
is plain: Much of Saigon's indigenous food 
and commodity supply depends on the suf-
ferance of the Vietcong and on payments to 
The ravages of war and terrorism, however, 
are taking a toll of the country's productive 
capacity. Rice fields and rubber plantations 
in areas that are being bombed and fought 
over no longer produce their contribution to 
feed the people and to nourish the economy. 
Fledgling enterprises in outlying areas, cut 
off from supplies and from markets by in-
terrupted communications, wither and fail. 
Along with increased Vietcong activity in 
the delta in recent months, there has been 
growing Vietcong restriction on the flow of 
rice from that region to the Saigon market. 
The result is that Vietnam, a rice surplus 
region, in 1966, will have to import at least 
300,000 tons of rice from abroad under U.S. 
aid programs to feed the population of the 
cities- and towns under the Government's 
control. 
Although, as has been said, the arrival of 
large numbers of American troops has gone 
far to restore business confidence in the 
cities of Vietnam, there have been adverse 
effects as well. One of these is the creation 
of a labor shortage, particularly among 
skilled workers, as men have been drained 
away from normal areas of employment to 
the base complexes and other regions where 
construction projects are being pushed to 
create the logistic structure and other fa-
cilities required by the American forces. 
Inflationary pressures resulting from the 
war and the changed U.S. role have thus far 
been kept within bounds. Saigon itself, 
however, has an overstimulated atmosphere 
of almost hectic prosperity, in some respects, 
as the impact of spending by American serv-
icemen and the effect of U.S. defense ex-
penditure make themselves felt. There are 
also the beginnings of the rumblings of per-
sonal discontent and antagonism which gen-
erally characterize the reaction in any na-
tion to the sudden infusion of a large body 
of foreign forces. 
14. Summation 
In sum, the overall control of the country 
remains about the same as it was at the 
beginning of 1965. It is estimated that about 
22 percent of the population is under Viet-
cong control and about 18 percent inhabits 
contested areas. About 60 percent of the 
population in the country is, at present,

910 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE 
under some form of government control, 
largely because of its hold on Saigon and 
other cities and large towns. 
The population of the cities has been aug-
mented by a great number of refugees. 
Hundreds of thousands in number, they are 
for the greater part composed of people who 
have fled to the cities in an effort to escape 
the spreading intensity of the war. In this 
sense, they are unlike the refugees who came 
from North Vietnam in 1954. These earlier 
refugees consciously chose to leave their an-
cestral homes and come south permanently, 
rather than accept a Communist regime. 
The new refugees, for the most part, are 
believed merely to be waiting for an end to 
the fighting in order to return to their homes 
and land. 
The Vietcong have stepped up sabotage, 
terrorism, and hit-and-run attacks in the 
Government-held areas which are, prima-
pally, cities and major towns and indetermi-
nate, but limited, extensions outward from 
them. Harassment by United States and 
Vietnamese air attack and airborne forces 
has increased in the firmly held Vietcong 
areas of South Vietnam which are almost 
entirely rural. And, of course, North Viet-
nam has been brought under air attack. 
In general, however, what the Saigon Gov-
ernment held in the way of terrain in the 
early months of 1965 (and it was already 
considerably less then was held at the time 
of the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem), is 
still held. What was controlled then by the 
Vietcong ITT still controlled by the Vietcong. 
What lay between was contested at the out-
set of 1965 and is still contested. 
R. VIETNAM AND THE NATIONS OE ASIA 
Other nations of Asia generally view the 
conflict in Vietnam with great concern. 
Those countries nearest to Vietnam see in 
the spread and increasing intensity of the 
warfare a heightened danger of a spillover 
into their territory. They sense that the 
longer the conflict continues and the more it 
escalates the greater becomes this danger to 
themselves. Furthermore, they fear the 
effect upon their own future should all of 
Vietnam become a Communist state. 
Laos already finds itself deeply although 
unwillingly involved on the fringes of the 
war in Vietnam. The fighting within Lacs, 
which coneinues despite the 1962 Geneva 
Agreement, is now a closely interwoven part 
of the Vietnamese struggle. The connection 
is most pronounced in the eastern part of 
bans which. lies within the control of the 
Communist Pathet Lao forces. This region, 
the so-called Laotian panhandle, is a natural 
infiltration route for men and supplies from 
North Vietnam into South Vietnam. A long 
border abutting on South Vietnam makes 
it possible for troops and equipment from 
Efanoi to reach far south through Commit-
uist-control led territory in Laos with a mint-
mum of risk before being diverted across the 
border into South Vietnam by any number 
of lateral communications routes. New 
roads have been -constructed through this 
mountainous terrain along which men amd. 
supplies can pass, for the most part undetect-
ed, protected as they are in some regimm 
by double canopies of jungle foliage. These 
roads are not easily susceptible to aerial in-
Lerdiction. 
Cambodia, in a different manner and to 
o much Lesser extent than Laos, is already 
directly touched by the fighting in Vietnam. 
There are repeated charges that Cambodian 
territory i.e being used as a brixe for Vietcong 
operations. That is possible in view of the 
remoteness and obscurity of the border but 
there is no firm evidence of any such orga-
nized usage and no evidence whatsoever that 
any alleged usage of Cambodian soil is with 
the sanction much less the assistance of the 
Cambodian Government. Prince Siha,noult 
responded immediately to a recent allega-
tion that the Cambodian port of Sihanouk-
ville is being used to transship supplies to 
the Vietcong by calling for an investigation 
by the International Control Commission 
which was set up under the Geneva Accords 
of 1954. 
Cambodia's overwhelming coneern is the 
preservation of its national integrity which, 
in times past, has been repeatedly violated 
by more powerful neighbors and is still sub-
ject to occasional forays from a tainor dissi-
dent movement (the Khmer Serail which has 
been allowed to base itself in the neighboring 
nations. Cambodia seeks recog )iticin and 
respect of its borders by all parties to the 
conflict. It asks to be left to I. ve in peace 
so that it may concentrate on it, own prob-
lems and internal development. The Cam-
bodians have made great internal progress, 
largely through their own efforts supple-
mented by a judicious use of aid :from the 
United States in the past and From other 
its Lions both in the past and at he present 
time. They have a peaceful and productive 
nation with an intense sense ,,r national 
unity and loyalty to Prince Sihaeouk. 
The fact that fighting in S-out h Vietnam 
has raged close to the border and there have, 
as a result, been occasional border incursions 
and bombing of Cambodian territory has 
caused the deepest concern to the cambodian 
Government. Cambodia can be expected to 
make the most, vigorous efforts to resist be-
coming directly involved in the struggle 
surging through South Vietnam end to repel 
to the best of its capability direct and or-
ganized invasions of its territory which may 
stem from the mounting tempo of the war. 
Thailand, the only country on the south-
east Asia mainland directly allied with the 
United States, seeks to cooperate with the 
United States as an ally while avoiding a 
spillover of the war into That territory. 
That course is becoming increasinely difficult 
to maintain. Thailand has a large number 
of North Vietnamese living in its northeast 
region bordering on Laos. This element re-
tains an affinity for Hanoi and is susceptible 
to its influence. Moreover, in the recent 
past Peiping has brought to the forefront a 
Thai leader in exile and has increased the 
intensity of its propaganda attacks against 
Thailand. Reports of terrorism and sabotage 
in the northeast of Thailand are increasing. 
The Vietnamese war was brough I very close 
to Thai territory in November 1965. A Pathet 
Lao military -thrust toward the Laotian town 
of Thakkek on the Mekong, which was sup-
ported by North Vietnamese troope, was for-
tuitously driven back by Government forces. 
Had it not been repelled, the war: in effect, 
would have reached the point whbre it made 
direct contact with Thailand's frontier. 
Nations in Asia more geographically re-
mote from the war in South Vietnam are 
nonetheless conscious of -the danifers to the 
entire area as the struggle in South Vietnam 
becomes snore prolonged and eve;- more in-
tense. These countries range frcen neutral 
and nonalined Burma through .uch allies 
of the United States as the Philippines and 
Japan. 
Each of the countries of Asia la is its own 
internal problems. Each has varying de-
grees of internal stability. Each has as a 
principal concern, the avoidance of direct 
involvement in the Vietnamese conflict. With 
the exception of Korea, there is hale likeli-
hood of substantial material help from these 
sources in providing military assistance in 
South Vietnam. Others are either unwill-
ing or reluctant to become involved in a 
military sense or are unable to do so because 
of inner difficulties or the broader strategic 
requirements of the Asian situation. Even 
with respect to Korea, it is obvioue that any 
withdrawal of forces for use in Vietnam 
creates new problems of military halance as 
between North and South Korea. It should 
not be overlooked that peace in the Korean 
peninsula is still held together only by a 
-tenuous truce. 
The Asian nations generally are aware of 
their own relative powerlessness to influence 
January 24, 19(56 
the main course of events, Or, in the final 
analysis, to control their own destinies should 
the conflict in Vietnam ultimately develop 
into a confrontation between the United 
States and Communist China with all that 
such an eventuality might imply for tale 
peace of Asia and the world; In Japan, for 
example, there is a deep anxiety over the 
poesible consequences to that; nation of such 
a confrontation if it should materialize. Tne, 
memory of the escalation of the limiter' 
Manchurian incident of 30 year;; ago into 
a seemingly interminable war on the 
land of China is not yet dead in japan. 
To sum up, then, the nations of Asia re-
cognize the immense importance to them-
selves of what is transpiring in Vietnam. 
But they also recognize their own limita-
tions in the face of it. Their immediate 
preoccupation, in any event, is with their 
own internal problems and development. 
Throughout the area there is a continuing 
interest in activities involving peaceful co-
operation for economic development. The 
Peace CorpJ, is generally welcomed wherever 
it operates and, notably, in the Philippines. 
The new Asian Development Bank is being 
launched with considerable enthusiasm. The 
Mekong project has warm support through-
out the region and considerable interest in 
Cambodia, which is central to the concept. 
It is clear that none of the nations of the 
area desires the domination of either China 
or the United States. Given a choice, it is 
doubtful that any nation would like to see 
the influence of the United States with
completely from southeast Ash;. 
Generally speaking, the nations of the area 
welcome peaceful ties with the United 
States and our participation in the devel-
opment of the region if that participation 
does not become overwhelming. 
C. THE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN ETTROPE 
Without exception the Soviet Union, Po-
land, and Rumania give full and firm sup-
port to the position of Hanoi and the Viet-
cong. They are quick in their denunciation 
of the U.S. role in South Vietnam and ve-
hement against U.S. bombing in North 
Vietnam. 
Part of this solidarity is undoubtedly de-
rived from ideological affinities. Whatever 
attitudes they may manifest toward Com-
munist China, and they vary, it is clear that 
responsibility for the continuation of the 
conflict in Vietnam is assigned to the United 
States and this is regarded as an impedimeni; 
to improvement in political relations with 
this country. 
There is no reason to believe that the So-
viet Union, in present circumstances, sees it;; 
way clear or, in fact, is anxious to play a 
significant role to assist in bringing an end 
to hostilities in Vietnam. The Soviet Union 
has steadfastly refused to join with the 
United Kingdom, the other cochairman of the 
1954 Geneva Conference, in calling for a re-
convening of that Conference. They have 
emphasized repeatedly in public statemen 
as well as in other ways that they have no 
intention of taking an initiative for peace 
in Vietnam at this time. 
The countries of Eastern Europe have rea-
son for concern over the continuation of the 
conflict in Vietnam and its escalation. Some 
of these reasons have to do with their own 
national preoccupations and the situation 
in Europe. Both Poland and Rumania, for 
example, have a very substantial trade with 
the Western World and remain interested in 
increased trade with the United States 
should conditions permit. Both might well 
be disposed to make a contribution to a 
settlement of the Vietnam problern to the 
extent their capabilities permit but only 
should they see some possibility of success.

ern European countries and the Soviet Union 
runs the shadow of Communist China. 
Until now the Chinese Communists have 
not introduced their manpower directly into 
the conflict although they clearly recognize 
that the war may reach that point. They 
recognize, too, that the war may impinge 
upon China herself at some point and have 
begun to make preliminary preparations for 
that eventuality. 
For the present, however, the Chinese ap-
pear to take the view that their direct inter-
vention in Vietnam is not required since: 
(1) the war in South Vietnam is a people's 
war which the Vietcong are winning; (2) 
North Vietnam is successfully defending it-
self; (3) the more the United States escalates 
the war the higher our casualties will be and 
the more discouraged we will become; and 
(4) the United States cannot win, in any 
event, according to Chinese theories. 
It is from Communist China that Hanoi 
and the Vietcong derive the bulk of their 
outside material support. It is from Commu-
nist China that there has also flowed en-
couragement of resistance to negotiation or 
compromise. As the war escalates and Hanoi 
becomes ever more dependent upon Chinese 
support, a dependence which Soviet aid at 
best only tempers, the likelihood also in-
creases that North Vietnam will not be able 
to negotiate a settlement without at least the 
tacit consent of China. In fact, that point 
may already have been reached. 
E. CONCLUDING COMMENTS 
A rapid solution to the conflict in Vietnam 
is not in immediate prospect. This would 
appear to be the case whether military vic-
tory is pursued or negotiations do, in fact, 
materialize. 
Insofar as the military situation is con-
cerned, the large-scale introduction of U.S. 
forces and their entry into combat has 
blunted but not turned back the drive of 
the Vietcong. The latter have responded 
to the increased American role with a further 
strengthening of their forces by local recruit-
ment in the south and reinforcements from 
the north and a general stepping up of mili-
tary activity. As a result the lines remain 
drawn in South Vietnam in substantially the 
same pattern as they were at the outset of 
the increased U.S. commitment. What has 
changed basically is the scope and intensity 
of the struggle and the part which is being 
played by the forces of the United States 
and those of North Vietnam. 
Despite the great increase in American 
military commitment, it is doubtful in view 
of the acceleration of Vietcong efforts that 
the constricted position now held in Vietnam 
by the Saigon government can continue to 
be held for the indefinite future, let alone 
extended, without a further augmentation 
of American forces on the ground. Indeed, 
if present trends continue, there is no assur-
ance as to what ultimate increase in Amer-
ican military commitment will be required 
before the conflict is terminated. For the 
fact is that under present terms of reference 
and as the war has evolved, the question is 
not one of applying increased U.S. pressure 
to a defined military situation but rather of 
pressing against a military situation which 
is, in effect, open ended. How open is depen-
dent on the extent to which North Vietnam 
and its supporters are willing and able to 
meet increased force by increased force. All 
of mainland southeast Asia, at least, cannot 
be ruled out as a potential battlefield. As 
noted, the war has already expanded sig-
nificantly into Laos and is beginning to lap 
over the Cambodian border while pressures 
increase in the northeast of Thailand. 
Even if the war remains substantially with-
in its present limits, there is little foundation 
for the expectation that the Government of 
Vietnam in Saigon will be able, in the near 
future, to carry a much greater burden than 
It is now carrying. This is in no senSe a 
reflection on the caliber of the current leaders 
of Vietnam. But the fact is that they are, 
as other Vietnamese Governments have been 
over the past decade, at the beginning of a 
beginning in dealing with the problems of 
popular mobilization in support of the Gov-
ernment. They are starting, moreover, from 
a point considerably behind that which pre-
vailed at the time of President Diem's 
assassination. Under present concepts and 
plans, then, what lies ahead is, literally, a 
vast and continuing undertaking in social 
engineering in the wake of such military 
progress as may be registered. And for many 
years to come this task will be very heavily 
dependent on U.S. foreign aid. 
The basic concept of present American 
policy with respect to Vietnam casts the 
United States in the role of support of the 
Vietnamese Government and people. This 
concept becomes more difficult to maintain as 
the military participation of the United 
States undergoes rapid increase. Yet a 
change in the basic concept could have a 
most unfortunate impact upon the Viet-
namese people and the world at large. What 
is involved here is the necessity for the 
greatest restraint in word and action, lest the 
concept be eroded and the war drained of a 
purpose with meaning to the people of 
Vietnam. 
This danger is great, not only because of 
the military realities of the situation but also 
because, with a few exceptions, assistance has 
not been and is not likely to be forthcom-
ing for the war effort in South Vietnam 
from nations other than the United States. 
On the contrary, as it now appears, the longer 
the war continues in its present pattern and 
the more it expands in scope, the greater 
will become the strain placed upon the rela-
tions of the United States with allies both 
in the Far East and in Europe. 
Many nations are deeply desirous of an 
end to this conflict as quickly as possible. 
Few are specific as to the manner in which 
this end can be brought about or the shape 
it is likely to take. In any event, even 
though other nations, in certain circum-
stances, may be willing to play a third-party 
role in bringing about negotiations, any pros-
pects for effective negotiations at this time 
(and they are slim) are likely to be largely 
dependent on the initiatives and efforts of 
the combatants. 
Negotiations at this time, moreover, if they 
do come about, and if they are accompanied 
by a cease-fire and standfast, would serve to 
stabilize a situation in which the majority 
of the population remains under nominal 
government control but in which dominance 
of the countryside rests largely in the hands 
of the Vietcong. What might eventually ma-
terialize through negotiations from this sit-
uation cannot be foreseen at this time with 
any degree of certainty. 
That is not, to say the least, a very satisfac-
tory prospect. What needs also to be borne 
in mind, however, is that the visible alterna-
tive at this time and under present terms of 
reference is the indefinite expansion and in-
tensification pf the war which will require 
the continuous introduction of additional 
U.S. forces. The end of that course can-
not be foreseen, either, and there are no 
grounds for optimism that the end is likely 
to be reached within the confines of South 
Vietnam or within the very near future. 
In short, such choices as may be open are 
not simple choices. They are difficult and 
painful choices and they are beset with many 
impounderables. The situation, as it now 
appears, offers only the very slim prospect 
of a just settlement by negotiations OT the 
alternative prospect of a continuance of the 
conflict in the direction of a general war 
on the Asian mainland. 
Mr. MUSKIE. Madam President, 
since our return from our travels, each 
911 
of us, of course, has been asked to add 
our personal impressions to the report. 
The report speaks for itself and repre-
sents a consensus of the five Senators 
Involved. Nevertheless, it cannot con-
ceivably encompass the hundreds of re-
actions and impressions which we expe-
rienced and are still digesting. 
It may be useful, therefore, Madam 
President, to include at this point in the 
RECORD?and I ask unanimous consent 
to do so?some excerpts from comments 
I have made since our return. 
There being no objection, the excerpts 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
I have said that Vietnam was the single, 
consistently recurring subject in our discus-
sions: 
Only the Communist countries urged our 
unconditional withdrawal from South Viet-
nam?with varying degrees of emphasis and 
harshness in their criticism of American 
policy. 
There appeared to be an underlying regret 
in Warsaw, Moscow, and Bucharest that the 
Vietnam problem exists and a wish that it 
might go away?but the words used con-
sistently placed responsibility upon the 
United States for the existence of the prob-
lem and for eliminating it. 
There was a general uneasiness about the 
dreadful uncertainties to which the Vietna-
mese conflict might lead. 
There was a general pessimism about the 
prospects for a negotiated settlement, but 
indications of an interest in contributing to 
that objective if the opportunity arose. 
Support for U.S. policy in Vietnam varied 
inversely with the distance from southeast 
Asia. 
There was very great uneasiness in south-
east Asia as to the consequences for south-
east Asian countries of a complete U.S. with-
drawal. 
All the areas of the world which we 
visited were a constant source of interest to 
all of us, but southeast Asia had a particu-
lar fascination. 
It is, of course, the site of our greatest 
overseas problem. 
It is an area of great variety and beauty. 
It is an area of great resources and poten-
tial richness. 
On the surface, the five countries we 
visited?Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, 
and South Vietnam?have mach in common 
and would appear to have much to gain 
from a closer association. 
In reality there are differences and divi-
sions, deep seated and historic, which are 
sources of constant friction?and instability 
even within a given country. 
And the gap between the rich and the 
poor is as great as anywhere in the world, 
and productive of more instability. 
There is no love or natural affinity between 
any of these _ countries and China?before

There is no question in my mind but 
that all of them would fall under Chinese 
domination and control if the United States 
withdraws or is driven from South Vietnam. 
To the leaders of Red China, South Viet-
nam is just another incident in the long 
struggle which they have waged for 40 years 
and which they intend to continue to wage 
for the ultimate supremacy of their brand of 
communism in the world. 
They will not be diverted from their ulti-
mate objective by whatever happens in Viet-
nam. 
Only the forces of evolution and change,

a modern, industrial state, can blunt or

SUBSTITUTION OF PRIVATE FOR 
PUBLIC CREDIT 
Mr. MOSS. Madam President, I am 
sure that Senators on both sides of the 
aisle will welcome the special emphasis 
that President Johnson's budget places 
on urging the private financial commu-
nity to participate more fully in financ-
ing major Federal credit programs. 
In the coming fiscal year, the Federal 
Government plans to relinquish to pri-
vate buyers $4.7 billion of Federal 
loans?including both individual loans 
and opportunities to participate in pools 
of loans. 
To make this possible, the President 
proposes to broaden the whole range of 
assets now sold through participation 
pools. He also proposes to expand the 
newly enacted program under which 
State and nonprofit agencies, with Fed-
eral assistance, insure private loans to 
college students, so as to reduce the 
budgetary requirements for direct Fed-
eral loans. 
The President's program of substitut-
ing private for public credit?wherever 
consistent with program objectives?is 
in line with policies voiced by each of 
the last three Presidents. It fulfills the 
recommendations made in 1963 by the 
Committee on Federal Credit Programs 
that "Government credit programs 
should, in principle, supplement or stim-
ulate private lending, rather than sub-
stitute for it"?a report endorsed by 
both President Kennedy and President 
Johnson. 
It carries out the views so cogently ex-
pressed by the minority members of the 
House Ways and Means Committee in 
1963 when they declared that "The ad-
ministration can always reduce its bor-
rowing requirements by additional sales 
of marketable Government assets." 
Finally, this emphasis is most timely 
in the light of the special urgency of 
total budget requirements this year. By 
substituting private for public credit, we 
can free money for high-priority pro-
grams without increasing budget ex-
penditures. 
This is realistic, sensible, financial 
management. 
it penalises no beneficiary of public 
, credit assistance. 
It encourages the private credit sys-
tem to share with Government the re-
sponsibility and opportunity to build the 
Great Society. 
ADDRESS BY SENATOR RUSSELL OF 
GEORGIA To GEORGIA STATE 
LEGISLATURE, JANUARY 17, 1966 
Mr. TALMADGE. Madam President, 
my distinguished colleague, the Senator 
from Georgia i Mr. RUSSELL I recently de-
livered an outstanding address to the 
-eneral Assembly of the State of Geor-
gia, meeting at the State Capitol in At-
lanta. - 
appearing before a joint session of the 
State senate and the Georgia House of 
Representatives, Senator RUSSELL out-
lined in some detail the lasting and 
meaningful results of more than 3 dec-
ades of service in the U.S. Senate La his 
native State and to his Nation. As his 
record clearly shows, his primary eon-
cern has always been and will always be 
the well-being of the people of his State, 
as well as the security and best interests 
of the United States. The warmth and 
respect with which Senator RUSSELL is 
regarded by an overwhelming majority 
of the people of Georgia was demon-
strated by the enthusiastic reception he 
received from members of the Georgia 
Legislature, prior to, during, and follow-
ing his address, 
Just as the senior Senator from 
gia is held in high esteem by his fellow 
Georgians, so is he in the Chamber of 
the U.S. Senate. I know of no ether 
Member of this body who is more res;axt-
ed for his unswerving allegiance to the 
principles which have made this Nation 
what it is today, for his steadfastness in 
holding to heartfelt convietions, or for 
his knowledge of the parliamentary in-
ner workings and procedures of this body 
than my beloved senior colleague and 
warm friend, Dicx RUSSELL. 
Madam President, I commend Senator 
RussELL's remarks to the attention of the 
Senate and ask unanimous consent that 
they be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the remarks 
were ordered to be printed in the RLCORD, 
as follows: 
I UM ARES OF SENATOR RICHARD B. R::SSELL 
PREPARED FOR DELIVERY TO THE GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY Of GEORGIA AT THE CAME?, AT?
LANTA., MONDAY, JANUARY 17, 1966 
It is a high honor to stand again is this 
historic hall where men and events hare met 
In shape the destiny of our beloved Georgia. 
For me, each return visit to this general 
a3cembly is a sentimental and deeply moving 
eeperience. It brings back a flood of nos-
talgic rnemorlas of my own service in this 
body. I count the 10 yearn: I spent as a 
member of the house from Barrow County---
4 of them as speaker?as, among the most 
pleasant and satisfying of my career, 
This occasion today is especially meaning-
[sl. Last year, for the only Shoe in my life. 
I was unable to respond to a call to eldress 
this assembly. I can assure you that my 
esteem end respect for this body a:id its 
members are such that only illness pre' ented 
my presence on that occasion. 
EALT It GOOD, SPIRITS HIGH 
no this morning I welcome the oppor-
tunity to redeeem myself. I am happy to 
-ay that today my health is good, my spirits 
are high., and my face is turned full to the 
future. I look forward to serving Georgia in 
the Senate of the United States for many 
years to come ?provided that meets With ap-
proval of the people of this State. 
In both basis of organize tion and mem-
bership, this general assembly is deferent 
from any that has met here in the memory 
of man. But 1 am confident that its viedica-
lion and devotion to the welfare of Cleorgia 
is as great as any that has gone before. I 
am sure that you will discharge every re-
aponsibUity without fear, favor, or in 
imida-
ion. 
Georgia, in common with the rest of the 
country, is undergoing a period of whirl-
wind change and transition. When 1 was a 
member of this house, two-thirds of the 
people of Georgia lived on farms :,nd in 
rural areas. Today, however, slightly more 
'ell:an half of our people reside in urban corn-
January 24, 1 9 66 
inuniticse--and the trend to the city is almost 
certain to continue in the coming years. 
These changes have brought about a host 
of new and perplexing problems that are 
peculiar alike to the rural and the urban 
areas of our State. 
In searching for solutions to our problems, 
I know there will be differences and conflicts 
among you. But these can be resolved if 
they are approached in a spirit of cooperation 
and mutual understanding?and in accord-
ance with the words inscribed on our great 
seal?in "wisdom, justice, and moderation." 
GEORGIA'S HORIZON UNLIMITED 
Nothing can do more to enhance the future 
of Georgia than to have all our people from 
all sections working in harmony together for 
the common good of all. We must not jeop-
ardize that future through a needless strug-
gle between urban and rural interests that 
can only bring harm to the people of both 
sections. 
Georgia today is forging forward in all 
areas of life and in all spheres of activity. 
In the dark and discouraging years that, fol-
lowed Appomattox, the eloquent and incan-
descent Benjamin Harvey Hill uttered some 
words that Georgians of his day and ours 
have taken to heart. He said: "We can live 
neither in nor by the defeated past, and if 
we would live in the growing, conquering 
future, we must furnish our strength to 
shape its course,, and our will to discharge 
its duties." 
This we have done. Upon a proud and 
honorable heritage, we are constructing a 
new and modern Georgia that blends the best 
of the old with the promise of the new. 
Today, the future beckons as never before 
with hope and opportunity for all our people. 
A recent eurvey by the U.S. Department of 
Commerce revealed that in 34 of 35 cate-
gories Georgia has outstripped the Nation in 
industrial growth since 1948. In the same 
period, the average income of Georgians has 
doubled?though in our self-congratulation 
on this achievement let us not forget that we 
are still behind many other States. This is 
an area in which we must do better. 
WORKING FOR GEORGIA 
During my years in the Senate, I have 
worked with unstinting zeal and energy to 
advance Georgia's progress in every legiti-
mate and proper way at my command. I 
have undertaken to see that Georgia receives 
full opportunity to participate in all Federal 
programs and activities which our people, 
after all, help to pay for with their tax dol-
lars. I have done so in the conviction that 
I have been elected to represent and work 
for Georgia's interest in Washington - -and 
not Washington's interest in Georgia. 
The record, I think, bears evidence that 
these efforts have borne fruit. Let me 
quickly summarize some major areas: 
National defense 
Some 60,000 Georgians today are employed 
on the 15 major military bases located in 
Georgia and in defense-related industrial 
activities. The total impact on the Georgia 
economy of military and defense payrolls 
and activities amounts to well over $l bil-
lion annually and is increasing. Last year, 
for the first time, Georgia became one of 
the 10 leading States in dollar volume of 
defense contracts?and this was before selec-
tion of the Lockheed Co. at Marietta to build 
the mammoth C.-5A aircraft?one of the 
largest defense contracts ever to be awarded. 
River development 
Four of Georgia's principal rivers?the Sa-
vannah, the Chattahoochee, the Coosa, and 
the Flint?are under major development by 
the Corps of Engineers and construction of 
four new multipurpose dams is underway 
or is authorized. In the postwar period., 
we have opened 500 miles of year-round navi-
gable waterways on our rivers and our goal. 
is to add another 250 miles in the foresee-.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 
the unhoused to have homes. He 
learned there that they could not protect 
such policies when the interest rates were 
being increased in this bludgeon-like 
manner. If the interest rate did not go 
up on the loan, the discount would come 
in on the mortgage and the homeowner 
would be hurt in either instance because 
the piper must be paid. 
Once the decision to increase the in-
terest rates had been determined by the 
Federal Reserve Board, the cost of the 
housing had to march ahead in order 
to take care of this interest payment. 
This meant that if a person were buying 
a $20,000 home and the interest rate 
goes up one-half percent, which it im-
mediately did, there was a $100 cost 
which had to be absorbed on a discount, 
or spread across the life of the mortgage. 
It meant monthly payments had to be 
increased by $6 a month. To qualify for 
the home the man had to have a pay in-
crease of $24 a month. Now, for good-
ness sake, Mr. Speaker, if what we are 
trying to do here is to stop inflation, then 
I suggest to you the ? action of the Fed 
brought about the very condition that 
they were predicting because in the lit-
tle movement recited above you can see 
the house cost increase and the pay-
ment per month has to increase. There-
fore the wages, in order to take care of 
these demands, have to be increased. So, 
if we are upping the demand for wages 
and if we are upping the consumer prices, 
we are certainly moving forward on what 
I should judge is the common man's in-
terpretation of inflation. 
Therefore, it seems to me it was a very 
unhappy thing to do this. I must join 
the gentleman from Wisconsin in that 
determination, in that the Federal Re-
serve chose to make the determination 
they did at the time that they did it. It 
seems to me that the record is not yet 
clear as to how they can justify this 
move. I predict to you that the record 
will not show now or in the immediate 
future that the move they have made has 
stopped in any way the seeking of loans 
for investment. The bank loans have in-
creased since the movement of the Fed. 
Everybody has rushed into the market 
because they said that inflation is com-
ing. Immediately they charged the 
money market up, and there has been a 
greater demand as a result. I have seen 
no effect in the area in which one would 
hope to have gotten an effect. That leads 
me to believe that the gentleman from 
Wisconsin is right. Instead of firing a 
cannon they should have called up the 
riflemen and should have zeroed in on 
the problems on a selective basis. There-
fore, Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with 
the remarks of the gentleman from Wis-
consin. I would hope that we can look in 
the future to action by the Federal 
Reserve Board that will really indicate 
they are a part of this Government and 
intend to be as responsible and as re-
sponsive as the rest of us in Government 
have to be. 
I shall look forward to that great day, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. REUSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California [Mr. 
HANNA], who is one of the most indus-
trious and scholarly of our colleagues and 
who, particularly as a member of the 
great House Committee on Banking and 
Currency takes seriously the obligation 
which that membership entails for him, 
that he keep a continuing surveillance 
over monetary conditions in this country. 
I am proud and delighted that the 
gentleman shares my hope that the an-
nual report of the Federal Reserve, which 
will be delivered to our committee in a 
matter of weeks, will contain a reasoned 
account of what the Fed has done and 
an effort to come to grips with some of 
the problems and possibilities which I 
have discussed here this afternoon. 
I thank the gentleman from California 
for his contribution. 
VIETNAM! 
The SPEAkER pro tempore. Under 
previous order of the House, the gentle-
man from New Jersey [Mr. GALLAGHER] 
is recognized for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, com-
mittees of the Congress are presently 
considering various aspects of our Na-
tion's very substantial effort to stem 
Communist military and psychological 
aggressions in southeast Asia. Very 
shortly the Congress will act on the Pres-
ident's request for supplemental funds 
in the fiscal year 1966 budget to support 
our military operations in Vietnam. We 
will be asked to approve some additions 
to nonmilitary spending, specifically to 
permit expansion of the U.S. AID pro-
grams in South Vietnam. 
I am confident the Congress will act 
speedily on the President's request, thus 
reaffirming its strong support for the 
President's policies and actions. 
The situation confronting the United 
States in southeast Asia is difficult, com-
plex, and fraught with danger. If it were 
anything less, it would not be the issue 
to which this Congress will devote the far 
greater share of its attention in the 
months that lie ahead. The actions of 
the Congress will, in large measure, 
determine the course the country shall 
follow; our decisions will influence the 
military and political actions of the 
United States. 
I expect the Congress will engage in a 
broad and sweeping review of the situa-
tion. It is right that we should do so. I 
am confident the most searching studies 
will confirm that the President has fol-
lowed a course of action best suited to 
achieve our objectives which are to pre-
serve the integrity of the established Gov-
ernment of the Republic of Vietnam, to 
turn back the armed aggressors from the 
North and to bring about a cessation of 
hostilities and a just and enduring peace. 
The grave responsibility for the mili-
tary and political actions necessary to 
achieve these objectives rests with the 
President. He, in his loneliness, wisdom, 
and conscience, must make the decisions. 
This is the shattering burden of the man 
in the White House. 
Wide interest at the present moment 
is focused on the pause in the bombing. 
Great pressure is being brought to bear 
to resume the bombing. 4 may well be 
that a resumption will of necessity come 
about. 
The decision on how long to continue 
881 
the suspension of bombing against the 
north is one which only those with knowl-
edge of all the developments, both mili-
tary and diplomatic, can reach a mean-
ingful judgment. Few are in possession 
of such knowledge. The President is. I 
will say, however, that once the bombing 
is resumed, the momentum established 
as the result of the present pause and the 
intent diplomatic activity which has ac-
companied it will die and the openings 
toward peace which might have devel-
oped will close. 
We can resume the bombing of the 
north at any time, in a matter of minutes, 
and the advantages of that course?both 
physical and psychological?will imme-
diately come into play. But the present 
efforts dedicated to seeking out a peace-
ful, political settlement?which the 
President has told us have thus far 
achieved neither success or failure?
would then be shut off, in a sense wasted. 
If we continue this peace effort a while 
longer, we do not sacrifice our ability to 
reinstitute the bombing ?whenever we 
might. But if we send the bombers 
against the north prematurely we have 
sacrificed?at this stage, in this time?
the chances for moving in the direction 
of resolving the conflict in a peaceful 
manner. Therefore, unless there is an 
immediate and overriding necessity to re-
sume the bombing of North Vietnam, I 
am inclined to believe that we should not 
press the President to do so now. If the 
bombs fall so will fall the hopes for an 
early settlement. We will know then 
that the aggressors can only be deterred 
through continued military pressure. 
The President is dedicated to peace 
but he is also dedicated to protecting the 
lives of the young Americans involved in 
the war. Both these goals are equated 
with the present bombing pause. I am 
sure that the President will make the 
right decision when all the ingitdients 
have been evaluated. To press him now 
to resume bombing is but adding one 
more strain to what must be an agoniz-
ing review of the limited options at his 
disposal. 
I address myself to a fundamental and 
therefore critical point?whether, as has 
been suggested in some circles the United 
States should make a formal declaration 
of war against North Vietnam. 
This, in my opinion, would be a most 
unwise move. I know that many Mem-
bers share my concern that we should 
even seriously consider such an action. 
The President now has the emergency 
powers and authority necessary to act. 
The Congress in joint resolution dated 
August 10, 1964, approved all steps taken 
including the use of armed force, in the 
defense and freedom in southeast Asia. 
Let us be mindful that although we are 
involved in sizable military operations 
In support of the Government of the 
Republic of Vietnam, we are at the same 
time, engaged in continuing worldwide 
effort to bring an end to conflict, to 
move from the jungle battlefields to the 
conference table. We seek to curtail 
the conflict, not broaden it. We seek to 
end it, not extend it. 
The President of the United States 
must have flexibility to act quickly and 
decisively in a situation of this type.

882 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE January 24, 1966 
A declaration of war would deny him 
this flexibility. It would place him in a 
rigid position, very severely reducing his 
capability of quick action to take advan-
tage of either military or political tar-
gets of opportunity. 
We must be conscious of the political 
sensitivity of our involvement in south-
east Asia. Great change has taken place 
In the past two decades in the relation-
ships between nations. 
Although we are the most powerful na-
tion on earth, we must be mindful that 
we live in a community of nations, many 
of whom are alined with us in the fight 
to halt the spread of communism. I am 
certain that a declaration of war would 
prove distressing to most of the allied 
nations who support our present policies 
and actions in Vietnam. 
As war has become more devastating, 
diplomacy has become infinitely more 
delicate, more urgent. As the likelihood 
of expansion of a conflict increases, a re-
sponsible nation must intensify its efforts 
to end conflict. 
The United States possesses military 
power so tremendous that it is almost 
beyond the comprehension of man. A 
declaration of war would assume the full 
application of that power with rather 
limited restraints in the hands of the 
President. At a time when our objective 
is to limit the conflict in southeast Asia 
and to end it as quickly as possible, a 
declaration of war would tend to broaden 
it, quite possibly extend it. 
One who possesses great power must 
have the will and the means to control 
power. In the context of our involve-
ment in Vietnam, there must be day-to-
day, hour-to-hour management of our 
military operations at the highest level. 
The President, committed in an open 
campaign for peace, must have the con-
trol that can immediately escalate or de-
escalate our military effort as may be 
in his sound judgment and dictated by 
developments. 
If a declaration of war assumes the 
application of maximum military power, 
as most nations would take it to mean, 
it assumes destruction of North Vietnam. 
This, we are attempting to convince the 
world, is not an objective of the United 
States. 
Our objective is to apply the military 
power necessary to rid the Republic of 
Vietnam of the armed aggressors?and 
to permit, in time free and open elections, 
a self-determination by the citizens of 
that country. What damage has been 
done and what further damage may be 
wrought by American - irpower in North 
Vietnam is what is necessary to curtail 
and eventually to halt Hanoi's support of 
the Vietcong. This, we hope, is clearly 
understood by the leaders of the Demo-
cratic Republic of Vietnam. 
Although our objectives may be lim-
ited, our determination to achieve those 
objectives is not. It becomes more firm. 
The President, as he has so often stated, 
will apply the power necessary to halt 
the aggression. We will meet our com-
mitments in southeast Asia 
I cannot give too great an emphasis 
to the point that a declaration of war 
would have serious international impli-
cations. This is so not only because as 
I have noted, a declaration would as-
sume dedication to the total destruction 
of the enemy, but it would question the 
validity of the President's statements 
concerning his desire for a peaceful set-
tlement. Our hope, of course, is that, 
in time. Hanoi will take a more reasoned 
and rational approach to a solution. A 
declaration of war would reduce such a 
possibility. 
In this age, as post-World War II his-
tory shows, it is important that a power-
ful nation tailor its actions, both polit-
ical and military, to existing situations. 
In Greece, threatened by Communist 
guerrillas in 1947, President Truman as-
sumed a firm position in support of the 
Greek Government, providing necessary 
support to sustain that government. He 
designed his strategy and his policies to 
fit the existing situation. 
The situation in Korea called for a 
totally different strategy, a tremendously 
expanded effort, approaching but not 
quite becoming a total effort. Here 
again? President Truman had the flexi-
bility a Chief Executive needs. 
The most recent example of controlled 
response was President Kennedy's han-
dling of the Cuban missile crisis. He 
was prepared to use maximum power, 
but applied just enough pressure to force 
withdrawal by the Soviet Union, thus 
achieving his objective. 
President Johnson's decision to halt 
bombing of North Vietnam properly 
complimented his very open and deter-
mined worldwide effort to bring those in 
conflict to the conference table. If he 
had been in an inflexible position, such 
as we might expect in a state of declared 
war, an adjustment to compliment a 
stepped up move toward peace might not 
have been possible. 
The decision as to how long the cessa-
tion of bombing shall continue must rest 
with the President. Only he has knowl-
edge of all of the developments, military 
and political, that influence the actions 
that must be taken to achieve our objec-
tives. Control is not a one-way street, it 
can be employed to achieve rapid escala-
tion, as could well be the case once it be-
comes evident the cessation of bombing 
is serving no purpose. But at what pre-
cise moment this might become the bet-
ter part of strategy, only the President 
can say. 
Although there have been, since the 
founding of the United Nations in 1945, 
too many armed conflicts in the world, 
there has not been a formal declaration 
of war by any nation. 
As the Congress seeks to assist the 
President in his efforts to gain the lim-
ited objectives that have so often been 
proclaimed, as we review and study the 
policies and actions aimed at winning 
those objectives, let us make sure that 
we place no undue restraints upon the 
President or insist on any actions that 
might hamper his efforts to win the war 
and win the peace. 
DUPLICTY IN GOVERNMENT 
(Mr. HARSHA (at the request of Mr. 
JoHNE;ox of Pennsylvania) was granted 
permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. HARSHA. Mr. Speaker, the 
Johnson administration is certainly 
amenable to the charge of duplicity 
in government. This administration, 
which has shed so many crocodile tears 
about how it sympathizes with the plight 
of the aged, and professes to want to do 
so much for the poor, has been doing 
more to pauperize the aged and poor in 
this Nation than any administration in 
the history of America. 
This administration, through its in-
flationary policies, has destroyed the life 
savings of the retired people by reducing 
the purchasing power of their pensions 
and savings. It has made the poor 
poorer, and the plight of those living 
on fixed incomes more severe, by driving 
up the cost of living so high that their 
meager income is insufficient to purchase 
the bare necessities of life. And now 
this administration continues its attack 
on the less fortunate by insisting that 
they be required to pay a tax on the use 
of telephones. 
This is certainly duplicity in govern-
ment. While giving lipservice on the 
one hand to the plight of the poor and 
the aged, the administration, on the 
other hand, is going to compound that 
plight by taking from these people part 
of their meager savings and income 
through a telephone tax. A telephone 
tax hits hardest those who can least 
afford it. 
In this day and age telephone service 
is a necessity. Many people rely on this 
service to do their shopping, to be in-
formed as to their work, as a means of 
communication with their children, jobs, 
schools, and homes; and, in many in-
stances where both parents of a family 
work, this is the only means of commu-
nication between their children and 
emergency agencies. For many, partic-
ularly the aged and less fortunate, it is 
the only means of contact with law en-
forcement officials, the fire department, 
doctors, and hospitals. 
If the administration needs this addi-
tional revenue to help finance the war 
in Vietnam, let it obtain it by striking a 
comparable amount from the foreign aid 
program. Let some of the other na-
tions, who will benefit from the fight 
against communism as much as the 
United States, contribute to this onerous 
task, instead of placing the burden on 
the aged and those least able to afford it. 
I shall oppose the imposition of any tele-
phone tax, and hope that those who are 
interested in the welfare of the aged, 
retired, and poor will join me. 
INDEPENDENT SURVEYS ON THE 
POVERTY PROGRAM 
(Mr. YOUNGER (at the request of Mr. 
Joimsoist of Pennsylvania) was granted 
permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. YOUNGER. Mr. Speaker, very 
few independent surveys have been made 
in regard to the poverty program. How-
ever, the attached article by Haynes 
Johnson, taken from the Sunday Star 
of January 23, 1966, gives a detailed re-
port on the action of the program in 
Little Creek, Ky., which I am sure the

ists in supporting the need for preserva-
tion of etur natural heritage, it is cer-
tainly appropriate to reinforce one of the 
very earliest official projects having such 
a purpose. 
This bill is in effect an extension of the 
Appalachian Trailway agreement which 
since 193$ has been a guide for the 13 
States through which the trail passes. 
About one-third of the trail is now on 
Federal lands. It runs from Mount Ka-
tandin, Maine, to Springer Mountain, Ga. 
One of the most beautiful sections of 
the trail lies in my own 27th Congres-
sional District in New York State. It was 
here in 1922 that the first section of the 
trail was opened under the leadership of 
the late Raymond H. Torrey, a name 
highly honored in my district. The trail 
there is partly within the Palisades In-
terstate Park, itself a majestic treasure 
of natural American forest land. At that 
point the Appalachian Trail is at the 
point closest in its entire length to the 
New York metropolitan area. Perhaps 
here the greatest numbers of Americans 
enjoy this fraction of Amercian in its 
original condition. 
In substance my bill H.R. 12204 pro-
vides coordination of the efforts of the 
Secretaries of Interior, Agriculture, and 
Defense and those of other Federal offi-
cials in providing uniform administra-
tion and protection of the Appalachian 
Trail. The trail is designated to be a 
trailway which shall be maintained so 
as to retain its natural and scenic char-
acter. The Secretary of Interior, with 
concurrence of other Federal agencies, is 
authorized to issue regulations carrying 
out the purpose of the act. The Secre-
tary is authorized to redefine the route in 
order to improve its quality. The bill 
sets up the principle of locating the trail-
way to provide maximum retention of 
natural conditions and scenic and his-
toric features, and its primitive nature. 
The bill provides for acquisition by the 
Federal agencies of properties through 
donations or willing sellers, all for the 
benefit of the trailway objectives. 
PEACE QUEST PRAISED 
(Mr. DOW asked and was given per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD.) 
Mr. DOW. Mr. Speaker, the President 
has made quite clear his hopes for end-
ing the war in Vietnam. No one doubts 
that the United States prefers peace?
a just and honorable peace?to a mean 
and ugly war. Our motives will go far to 
convince others that we do not seek 
added territory and that we do not seek 
to rob another country of its resources. 
A recent editorial in the Washington 
Star is typical of many which have 
praised the administration for its ap-
proach to ending the war in Vietnam. 
Because this editorial is of much interest, 
I insert it in the RECORD: 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Evening Star, 
Jan. 17, 1966] 
CONTINUING PEACE QUEST 
Whatever signals have or have not been re-
ceived from the Communi t leaders in Hanoi, 
President Johnson is acting as if he means 
business in his search for peace in Vietnam. 
The state of the Union message did not, 
as many people expected, mark the end of a 
peace offensive and a return to intensified 
war. It marked, on the contrary, the culmi-
nation of an appeal to shift the conflict from 
the battlefield to the conference room. 
Since then the Russian mission to Hanoi 
headed by party leader, Alexander N. 
Shelepin, has wound up its work. Along with 
increased aid for North Vietnam, the Rus-
sians also have been urging negotiations, in 
the-opinion of some analysts here. In South 
Vietnam, observers have marked a slackening 
pace of hostilities. In New Delhi where he 
attended the funeral of Premier Shastri, Vice 
President HUMPHREY conferred for almost 2 
hours with Russian Premier Alexei Kosygin, 
presumably on ways to end the fighting. 
The surprise visit of Secretary of State 
Rusk to Saigon adds fuel to the speculation 
that something is cooking. The opposition 
of the South Vietnamese Government to any 
formal negotiations at this stage is a major 
obstacle to peace talks that would have to be 
overcome if discussions were to be held. The 
presence of Mr. Rusk in the troubled capital, 
along with the President's chief emissary, 
Averell Harriman, suggests that the chances 
are brightening. 
"I am hopeful," said Mr. Johnson Wednes-
day. "And I will try as best I can with 
everything I've got to end this battle and 
return our sons to their desires." The sub-
stance of these hopes today remains very 
much a mystery. But few can doubt that 
the President is doing his best. 
DR. MANFRED GEORGE 
(Mr. RYAN asked and was given per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and include extra-
neous matter.) 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
pay tribute to a man who was not only a 
great American, but a great citizen of the 
world. The death of Manfred George in 
New York on December 30 has saddened 
not only those who knew him, but all 
those through the world who were fa-
miliar with Aufbau, the German lan-
guage weekly which he edited so bril-
liantly and tirelessly for more than 25 
years. 
Manfred George came to this country 
in 1939. At that time he could already 
look back on a distinguished career in 
his native Germany as an author, novel-
ist and, above all, a journalist. Forced 
to leave Germany because of his implaca-
ble enmity to Nazism, he settled briefly 
in Czechoslovakia, then in France and 
finally found his way, like so many other 
refugees from tyranny, to the United 
States. 
Shortly after his arrival he was per-
suaded to take over a small monthly 
newsletter, called Aufbau, dedicated to 
maintaining contact among German 
speaking refugees. Under his inspired 
leadership this publication, which soon 
became a weekly, gained worldwide re-
nown as one of the finest German lan-
guage papers in the world. Today 
Aufbau is read in more than 80 coun-
tries and is universally respected as a 
thoughtful and outspoken voice for de-
cency and liberalism. 
Through the pages of Aufbau Man-
fred George provided an entire genera-
tion of immigrants with their first link 
to their new homeland. While inter-
national in its interest, Aufbau was and 
remains primarily an American paper, 
and through it our many new citizens 
who arrived in the late thirties and early 
forties as refugees from the evils of Hit-
lerism received their first introduction 
to America. 
Manfred George communicated a 
sense of excitement, dedication, and the 
sheer joy of being alive. And he never 
once lost sight of his aim and his 
supreme ideal: freedom and decency 
everywhere. Wherever the fight for hu-
man decency was being waged, he was 
at home: whether it was Germany or 
Isreal, New York or Mississippi. His pen 
was in the forefront of the struggle 
against oppression and tyranny. His 
life was dedicated to the cause of free-
dom and justice. 
Mr. Speaker, all those who shared his 
ideals have lost an articulate spokes-
man. Manfred George was not only an 
illustrious constituent but a cherished 
friend whose sound counsel I valued. He 
was fortunate in leaving a monument of 
his own creation. Aufbau will endure 
because Manfred George succeeded in 
imbuing it with his own spirit. Through 
his paper he will continue to live. 
Mr. Speaker, I include at this point 
In the RECORD articles about Dr. Man-
fred George which were published in the 
New York Times and the New York 
Herald Tribune on January 1, 1966: 
[From the New York Times, Jan. 1, 1966] 
D. MANFRED GEORGE '72, Dies; EDITOR OF 
GERMAN WEEKLY HERE?NOVELIST AND 
BIOGRAPHER MADE AUFBAU A VOICE OF HELP 
TO REFUGEES OF NAZISM 
Dr. Manfred George, editor of Aufbau, a 
German weekly here, died Thursday night 
in the University Hospital. He was 72 years 
old and lived at 785 West End Avenue. 
Dr. George, a biographer and novelist, who 
was known as a liberal editor in Germany 
before the rise of Hitler, became editor of 
Aufbau in 1939, after arriving here as a 
penniless refugee. 
Aufbau was then a small monthly news-
letter published by the German Jewish Club 
of New York, which is now the New World 
Club, Inc. Dr. George marshaled a distin-
guished advisory board, including Albert 
Einstein and Thomas Mann, and built the 
publication into an influential weekly with 
a circulation of 30,000. 
In World War II, the Aufbau helped thou-
sands of refugees adjust to new homes and 
aided in the reunion of families and friends. 
It offered subscribers English lessons, infor-
mation about naturalization, jobs, and 
housing. 
Aufbau changed with the times. Its 
search column, which assisted refugees in 
tracing families after the war, gave way to 
a supplement to help Jews establish claims 
for restitution from the German Govern-
ment. Today, it carries theater and opera 
reviews, columns on the stock market, and 
hobbies, as well as articles on world affairs. 
EXCLUSIVE FROM HEUSS 
"Aufbau," Dr. George once said "never 
stressed the concept of collective guilt for 
Germany." This resulted in friendly, rela-
tions with the German Government. In 
1951, Theodor Beuss, President of West Ger-
many, gave Aufbau an exclusive story about 
the decision of his Government to pay Jews 
for loss of property under Hitler. 
Dr. George toiled as many as 100 hours a 
week, aided by a staff of 30, to get Aufbau 
to its subscribers throughout the United 
States and many foreign countries. His 
reward was a loyal readership among up-
rooted people all over the world. 
He was born in Berlin, the son of a busi-
nessman, and studied law at the Univer-
sities of Berlin, Greifswald, and Geneva. In 
World War I, he served in the German

MANFRED GEORGE, EDITED GERMAN ATJFBAU 
HERE 
(By Jerome Zukosky) 
Manfred George had been swept across the 
borders of Europe before Nazi oppression, at 
times crossing mountains on foot, when he 
arrived penniless in New York in 1938. 
A lawyer, prolific author of plays and bi-
ographies, a journalist who ranged the world, 
and a leader of liberal German la-publican 
politics, he was one of the tens of thousands 
of German-Jewish professionals who con-
tributed to the flowering of a liberal and 
humane German culture before Hitler. It 
was his mission, Dr. George wrote later, to 
preserve in America what remained of that 
tradition. 
He succeeded by creating Aufban, or Re-
construction, as a forum for his comitrymen. 
He began at a salary of $15 a month with a 
decrepit typewriter, a 1-room Manhattan 
office and a 4-page monthly newsletter of 
a refugee's club and 2,000 subscribers. Work-
ing often 7 days a week and 14 or more hours 
a day, writing much of the paper himself, 
Dr. George turned Aufbau into one of the 
most influential foreign-language newspa-
pers in the United States. Its circulation of 
about 38,000 a week includes readers in 38 
nations. 
Dr. George, editor of Aufbau for the last 27 
years, died Thursday evening at University 
Hospital of a stroke at 72. He ern ered the 
hospital in October after a long illness but 
continued to edit the paper from his bed, 
telephoning constantly to his shabby clut-
tered office at 2121 Broadway, on whose walls 
were pictures of such old friends as Marlene 
Dietrich, whose first biography he wrote. 
Dr. George rounded up an advisery board 
In 1041 for Aufbau that included Al:iert Ein-
stein, Thomas Mann, Franz Werrel, Lion 
Feuchtwanger, Emil Ludwig, Freda K.irch-
wey, Roger N. Baldwin, and others of sim-
ilar talent who set the tone of the paper. 
He was an intimate friend of Dr. Albert 
Schweitzer. who occasionally contributed 
and with whom Dr. George had a long and 
lengthy correspondence. 
Dr. George mixed sophisticated theater re-
views?he was one of the first to pay serious 
attention to the off-Broadway thea ter?and 
literary news with advice to the immigrants 
about finding jobs, apartments, and lan-
gulag, instruction. Special sections were 
devoted to tracing missing persons and sur-
vivors of the Nazi holocaust and helping 
refugees here make claims for restitution 
from the postwar West German Government. 
Yet Dr. George "never stressed he con-
cept of collective guilt for Germeny," he 
said, and his moderation paved the way for 
close ties with the West German Govern-
ment. At a testimonial meeting at Hunter 
College last May on Aufbau's 30th anniver-
sary, some 2,000 readers gave an motion to 
West German Ambassador Heinrich Knapp-
stein as well as the urn. ii consul general 
here. 
As Aufbau's readers changed into Amer-
icans, so did Dr. George and his paper. 
"When I go to Europe now, I sin going 
abroad," he said in 1959. He felt increas-
ingly cut off the postwar German genera-
tion, for which he used the German word 
"truenamerkinder"?children of the ruins. 
"They are bent, tthey came out of the 
shadows, there is a wall between us," he said. 
His paper runs an average of 32 pages a 
week. Walter Lippmann is translated into 
German, but Art Buchwald and Dick Schaap 
of the Herald Tribune appear in English. 
Dr. George was born in Berlin, the son of 
a businessman whose ancestors included 
rabbis, merchants, and architects. 11 is study 
of law was interrupted by World War I, 
during which he was seriously wounded in 
January 24, 1966 
the German Army. Soon after obtaining 
his law degree in 1917 he began writing for 
German newspaper. He was editor of the 
Berlin Abendpost, drama critic for the 
Berliner Volkszeitung, and later Prague cor-
respondent for the Nationalzeitung of Basel, 
Switzerland, which he served as American 
correspondent after emigrating here. 
During the 1950's Dr. George contributed 
to the Herald Tribune editorial page and 
wrote many articles for other newspapers 
and magazines in the United States. 
Surviving are his wife, the former Jean-
nette Simon of 785 West End Avenue, a for-
mer social worker he married in Germany in 
1920; a son Frank, an architect, of Stamford, 
Conn.; a daughter, Mrs. George O'Sullivan, 
a book illustrator, and three grandchildren. 
A private funeral service will be held today. 
A memorial forest in Israel in honor of Dr. 
George is being planned. 
FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICIENT IN 
S SHIP CONSTRUCTION 
(Mr. ROGERS of Florida asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and ex-
tend his remarks.) 
Mr. ROGERS of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, the Federal budget released today 
contains provision for construction of 
only 13 new merchant ships. 
As of October 31, 1965, the U.S.S.R. had 
464 merchant ships of 1,000 gross tons or 
over under construction or on order. 
The Soviets have reached the point where 
some 24 percent of the total number of 
ships being built throughout the world 
are being built for them. 
Shipyards in some of our closest allied 
nations are hard at work trying to fill the 
Russians' orders. Britain, Japan, Italy, 
Holland?they are all building ships for 
the Reds. 
By comparison, the United States had 
only 39 merchant ships under construc-
tion or on order as of last October. Our 
own shipyards are operating at less than 
half capacity. 
During 1965, the Soviets accepted de-
livery of 100 new ships, while the United 
States took delivery of only 16. In terms 
of cargo capacity our total delivery of 
ships was approximately 24 percent that 
of the Russians. 
The Soviet Union spent over $600 mil-
lion last year on new ship construction. 
The U.S. figure comes to less than 20 per-
cent of that. 
The importance of shipping strength in 
time of war or national emergency is 
seen from the fact that our merchant 
marine has been called our "fourth arm 
of defense." Yet so pitiful is today's U.S. 
shipping strength that it has become nec-
essary for the Defense Department to 
charter foreign ships, at least four of 
them, for the sealift to Vietnam. 
Last week the Chief of Naval Opera-
tions raised serious questions about the 
adequacy of this Nation's shipping 
strength to handle emergency require-
ments. 
Somewhere in the Defense Department 
someone has been derelict in assessing 
the need for shipping capacity in time of 
emergency. 
As a member of the House Merchant 
Marine and Fisheries Committee I urge 
that a full and thorough review of this 
matter be initiated immediately. So

ARTHUR PATRICK CANNON 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the gentleman from Florida [Mr. 
FASCELL ]. 
Mr. FASCELL. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
sad duty to advise my colleagues and 
friends of the death of a former Member 
of this distinguished body, Arthur 
Patrick Cannon, who represented the 
Florida counties of Dade and Monroe, 
and his country extremely well. He died 
on Sunday, January 23. 
He was born in Powder Springs, Cobb 
County, Ga., on May 22, 1904. The 
family moved 6 South Carolina where 
Pat attended public school and Wofford 
College at Spartanburg, S.C. Pat Can-
non came to Florida where he attended 
John B. Stetson University at DeLand 
and then graduated from the University 
of Miami in 1931 with an LL.B. 
Arthur Patrick Cannon served in this 
distinguished body from January 3, 1939 
to January 3, 1947. 
"Pat," as he was affectionately called, 
by his many friends, was an able, knowl-
edgeable, and humble man of great 
heart, who knew and understood?and 
was ever willing to assist?his fellow 
man. 
In 1939, speaking before a committee 
of the Congress, he stated: 
My walking in marble halls has not caused 
me to forget thousands of shacks that house 
many of our unfortunate people, where they 
merely exist, hungry, ill-clothed, without 
medioal care. 
Pat never forgot his fellow man. He 
was always in the forefront of those 
striving to better each individual's way 
of life. 
He was among the first to propose and 
encourage the adoption of Federal old-
age assistance programs. He was among 
the first to propose Federal programs to 
assist the rehabilitation of veterans?
particularly the wounded veteran. He 
urged that more liberal benefits be in-
cluded in the Social Security Act. 
Pat was a strong supporter of the Flor-
ida sugar industry and was an early ad-
vocate of the intracoastal waterway, 
which is now nearing completion. 
Pat was a leader among those who 
proposed programs to eliminate poverty 
and crime and to increase education and 
employment opportunties. 
In the late thirties, when crime and 
poverty were most prevalent and when 
employment was at a low ebb, he told 
his colleagues in these halls: 
It is true that there has been crime in 
the past and unfortunately in all probabil-
ity there always will be crime. But it is 
just as true that idle youth is a dangerous 
instrumentality. If we turn the crime pages 
that have blackened our history we will be 
reminded that "Baby Face" Nelson, "Pretty 
Boy" Floyd, and John Diflinger all embarked 
on their criminal careers during the tender 
years of their lives. I am firmly of the be-
lief that criminals are not born, and that 
criminals are made, largely by the environ-
ment in which they find themselves. A child 
born of normal parents who are equipped to 
properly rear the child does not become a 
criminal. The activity and the anxiety and 
the ambition of unbridled youth cursed with 
poverty and denied the association of par-
entage because of economic conditions is the 
matter with which we must concern our-
selves. Thousands of boys and girls are 
graduated from our high schools and col-
leges mentally fit and equipped in every way 
to fill that niche in society, As they walk 
out into the world, employment is not 
found. They are nonetheless ambitious 
and nonetheless able, and as a result of the 
deplorable condition of lacking of buying 
power and lack of available employment, they 
are called upon to use their good resources 
toward a criminal end. That is the plight 
largely of a greater portion of the inmates 
of our houses of correction, penitentiaries, 
and reformatories today and likewise our asy-
lums. The youth of America must be em-
ployed and put to work and it must be done 
immediately, lest irreparable injury visit our 
society. 
Pat was a great humanitarian, always 
concerned with the welfare of his fellow 
human being, possibly because of his 
humble beginnings, but whatever the rea-
son, it is certain that Pat was motivated 
by a keen desire to help the youth, our 
elder citizens, veterans, and the deserv-
ing downtrodden. 
After his fruitful and vigorous service 
In the Congress of the United States, Pat 
returned to Miami. 
He went on to become a circuit judge 
elected in 1952, 1954, and in 1960 for a 
6-year term. He was serving in that of-
fice at the time of his death. 
Pat Cannon was an outspoken man. 
No one ever had any doubt about where 
Pat Cannon stood on anything, because 
he was quick to tell you. 
Pat Cannon will be missed sorely by his 
friends and colleagues. I extend my 
deepest sympathy to his family. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may be permitted to 
extend their remarks at this point in the 
RECORD, and that I may have permission 
to revise and extend my own remarks. 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, it 
is so ordered. 
There was no objection. 
AUTHORIZATION FOR COMMITTEE 
? ON BANKING AND CURRENCY 
Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Committee 
on Banking and Currency have until 12 
o'clock midnight tonight to file a report 
on the bank merger bill, H.R. 12173. 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, it 
Is so ordered. 
There was no objection. 
SEVENTY-SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE 
HOUSE URGE THE PRESIDENT 
NOT TO GIVE UP CURRENT PEACE 
OFFENSIVE 
(Mr. ADAMS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 min-
ute, and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, a number 
of the Members of the House, sharing a 
growing concern about the war in Viet-
nam, last Thursday drafted a letter to 
the President and in the course of only 4 
hours on Friday obtained its signature 
by 77 Members. Our letter to the Presi-
dent expressed our support of his exten-
sive efforts to move the Vietnamese war 
to the conference table and we promised 
him our continued support in resisting 
aggression against South Vietnam. We 
urged the President not to give up on his 
current peace offensive at this time and. 
we offered a suggestion that the United 
Nations be asked to seek an effective 
cease-fire in Vietnam. 
On Saturday the President replied to 
our communication in the form of a let-
ter addressed to me as the first name in 
the alphabetical list of signers. Mr.

CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE Or REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, D.C., January 21, 1966. 
THE PRESIDENT, 
The White House, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: We strongly support 
the vigorous efforts you have undertaken to 
bring the war in Vietnam to the conference 
table. Specifically, we applaud you for the 
moratorium on bombing North Vietnam and 
for the extensive personal contacts you have 
initiated with the leaders of other nations 
to make clear our unrelenting desire for a 
just peace. We would like to suggest that 
you further consider one additional dimen-
sion to this diplomatic offensive, that we 
formally request the United Nations to seek 
an effective cease-fire and that we pledge our 
support and our resources to such an effort. 
While the response from the other side has 
not been encouraging, we do not believe we 
should yet assume that the door has been 
firmly closed. We cannot expect that a con-
flict which has raged so bitterly for so long 
will be quickly or easily resolved. Neither 
can we ignore the alternative to negotiations, 
a prolonged and probably expanded war with 
attendant costs in human suffering and 
material resources. 
We stanchly support the determination of 
our Government to resist the terror and ag-
gression which deny the people of South 
Vietnam the right freely to determine their 
own future. We continue to support you in 
that commitment. We recognize that there 
are those who urge a resumption of bomb-
ings of North Vietnam and a premature 
bandonment of our peace efforts. We are, 
however, concerned that unless we can halt 
or reverse the escalation of the last months

THE WHITE HOUSE, 
Washington, January 22, 1966. 
Hon. BRocx ADAMS, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR Mn. CONGRESSMAN: I am responding 
to you as the first in alphabetical order of 
those Members of the House who have writ-
ten to me under date of January 21 on the 
search for peace in Vietnam. I hope you will 
share this answer with your cosigners. 
I am grateful for your strong support of 
our effort to move the war in Vietnam to the 
conference table. This support is a real en-
couragement, coupled as it is with the equally 
strong support of our determination to meet 
our commitments in Vietnam. 
I share your interest in effective action 
through the United Nations, and I want you 
to know that there is no part of this whole 
problem to which we give closer attention, 
I have reviewed this matter many times with 
Ambassador Goldberg, and we have repeat-
edly considered the suggestion you offer. 
You can be assured that he and I are firmly 
determined to make every possible use of 
the United Nations in moving toward peace, 
and toward an effective cease-fire as part of 
that purpose. 
Unfortunately, you are correct in your 
statement that the response from the other 
side has not been encouraging. The evi-
dence available to this Government indicates 
only continuing hostility and aggressiveness 
in Hanoi and an insistence on the abandon-
ment of South Vietnam to Communist take-
over. We are making no hasty assumptions 
of any sort, but it is quite another matter to 
close our eyes to the heavy weight of evi-
dence which has accumulated during the last 
month. 
I can give you categorical assurance that 
there will be no abandonment of our peace 
efforts. Even though it is increasingly clear 
that we have had only a hostile response to 
the present pause in bombing North Viet-
nam, you can be sure that our unflagging 
pursuit of peace will continue. As I said 
this week in a letter to Speaker MCCORMACK, 
"Whether the present effort is successful or 
not, our purpose of peace will be constant; 
we will continue to press on every door." 
And at the same time, I am confident that 
as elected representatives of the American 
people, you will share my determination that 
our fighting forces in Vietnam shall be sus-
tained and supported "by every dollar and 
every gun and every decision" that they must 
have "whatever the cost and whatever the 
challenge." For a month we have held our 
hand in an important area of military action. 
But the infiltration of the aggressor's forces 
has continued, and so have his attacks on 
our allies and on our own men. I am sure 
you will agree that we have a heavy obliga-
tion not to add lightly to the dangers our 
troops must face. We must give them the 
support they need in fulfillment of the com-
mitment so accurately stated in your letter?
"the determination of our Government to 
resist the terror and aggression which deny 
the people of South Vietnam the right freely 
to determine their own future." 
Sincerely, 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON. 
AMENDMENT TO FOREIGN TAX 
CREDIT PROVISION OF THE IN-
TERNAL REVENUE CODE, FOR THE 
BENEFIT OF THE U.S. ECONOMY 
(Mr. SECREST asked and was given 
permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD, and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. SECREST. Mr. Speaker, I am in-
troducing a bill to amend section 902(b) 
and section 902(c) of the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1954. These sections pro-
vide that if a U.S. corporation owns 10 
Percent or more of the voting stock of a 
foreign or first level corporation, and if 
such foreign corporation owns 50 per-
cent or more of the voting stock of a 
second level or a foreign subsidiary, the 
domestic parent corporation may credit 
its proportionate share of the subsubsidi-
ary's taxes. No credit is allowed to the 
U.S. corporation for foreign taxes paid 
by a foreign corporation beyond the sec-
ond level. 
As an example, a U.S. corporation has 
a wholly owned or majority owned for-
eign subsidiary in country X. This sub-
sidiary wishes to develop a new activity 
in which local capital should participate, 
but it is in no position to provide 50 per-
cent of the required capital without help 
from its American parent. However, it 
could provide 25 percent, with local capi-
tal providing the other 75 percent. Un-
der present tax law, the latter cannot be 
done without complete loss of foreign tax 
credits on the new enterprise. 
The foreign tax credit provision of 
the Internal Revenue Act, which was en-
acted in 1918 to remove international 
double taxation, has been amended sev-
eral times. The present requirements of 
10 percent and 50 percent ownership go 
back to the 1951 tax law. I understand 
that the 1951 requirement of at least a 
50-percent stock ownership on the sec-
ond level was predicated entirely on ad-
ministrative convenience to the Internal 
Revenue Service. However, section 6046 
of the Internal Revenue Code now re-
quires an information return from each 
U.S. person who, directly or indirectly, 
845 
owns 5 percent or more in the value of 
the stock of a foreign corporation. In 
addition, the 1962 tax law dealing with 
"subpart F income" provides the Treas-
ury with detailed information on for-
eign operations of U.S. taxpayers. All 
this information in the hands of the 
Internal Revenue Service should elimi-
nate the administrative inconvenience 
which might arise from reduction of the 
ownership test from 50 percent to 25 
percent and from inclusion of the third 
level foreign corporation in the tax 
credit structure. 
The proposed amendment would re-
duce the 50 percent requirement to 25 
percent between the first and second 
levels and would include third level for-
eign corporations in the tax credit struc-
ture if the 25 percent test is met. 
This change will have four major ef-
fects, all of which are in our national 
interest: 
First. It will contribute to the U.S. 
balance of payments. 
Second. It will enable American busi-
ness to expand and grow abroad with 
reduced amounts of American equity 
capital. 
Third. It will create a more favorable 
business climate abroad by furthering 
the increased participation of foreign 
local nationals in their own foreign 
economy. 
Fourth. It should encourage a de-
mand, wherever feasible, for raw mate-
rials, products and equipment to be sup-
plied from sources within the United 
States rather than elsewhere, thereby 
benefiting our economy through in-
creased employment and income. 
Income from oversea investments by 
U.S. industry is the major factor in the 
U.S. balance of payments. Conse-
quently, anything that can be done to 
expand the source of this income, with-
out the use of U.S. dollars, would fur-
ther the balance-of-payments' Position. 
Such expansion also is affected by for-
eign competition which requires Amer-
ican industry operating abroad to pro-
tect its marketing position by additional 
investment from either the United 
States or abroad. 
The United States has taken certain 
steps to reduce the amount of 'U.S. dol-
lars used for foreign investments. One 
way to expand and grow without using 
U.S. dollars is to encourage foreign na-
tionals to share in the ownership of the 
foreign enterprises in which American 
industry has interests. The reduction 
of the 50-percent test to 25 percent, 
and an extension of the credit to third 
level foreign corporations, would enable 
American industry, without the loss of 
foreign tax credits, to tap local sources 
of capital in the foreign country in 
which modernization and expansion are 
required to meet foreign competition 
abroad. 
In addition, the increased participa-
tion of foreign nationals with American 
business in the industrial life of a par- ? 
ticular foreign country should create a 
healthier attitude toward American ac-
tivities in that country. Section 106(1a) 
of the Canadian Income Tax Act, effec-
tive in 1963, is an example of the concern 
of foreign governments for increased

local participation in non-resident-
owned businesses. This law provided 
for a reduction in the Canadian 
withholding tax paid by nonresident 
corporations having a prescribed degree 
of Canadian ownership. 
In those countries which have local 
national stock exchanges, use of local 
equity capital could lead to a wider dis-
tribution of the stock of a second or 
third level foreign corporation. This 
penetration of the local capital markets 
could create additional sources for rais-
ing future frenture capital. 
Modernization and expansion of Amer-
ican financed industry abroad are neces-
sary to meet foreign competition abroad. 
Under the foreign tax credit structure, 
as it now exists, capital required for such 
modernization and expansion must come 
largely from the United States. This is 
so because any reduction of the 50-per-
cent stock interest between the first and 
second level foreign corporations, or the 
use of third level foreign corporations, 
would result in a loss of foreign tax 
credits to the U.S. parent corporation. 
As this proposed legislation will prove 
beneficial to the economy of the United 
States as well as participating foreign 
countries, I urge my colleagues to actively 
support its enactment. 
THE 4-YEAR TERM FOR MEMBERS 
OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENT-
ATIVES 
(Mr. CHEEP asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 min-
ute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CHELF. Mr. Speaker, as you and 
my colleagues know, I am for a 4-year 
term for Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
My bill, House Joint Resolution 394, is 
not new?it has been in the hearts and 
on the minds of men since the days of 
that great American, James Madison, 
who favored a longer tenure of office for 
Members of the House. 
Many others, over the years, have 
fought for this worthwhile project. In 
my own case?it has taken the constant. 
prodding of my people for 20 years to 
arouse me to do something about it. 
Only when 1 had to fight and finance 
four, hard, costly campaigns, all in the 
last 2 years, would I launch myself into 
the frontline trench of the 4-year term 
battle. I refuse to sit idly by and wait 
until election costs grow so great and so 
frequent that only a wealthy person with 
unlimited means can afford to run for 
Congress. 
The President has one version of this 
legislation and I have another. While 
our approaches differ somewhat, we both 
want a 4-year term. President Johnson 
may be on the New York Central and I 
on the Pennsylvania but we will arrive 
at the same destination. Only the route, 
the modus operandi, or legislative me-
chanics are at variance. I shall grate-
fully accept constructive amendments to 
my bill. I am happy to introduce today 
the President's prepared draft of the 
legislation. 
I am convinced that the people of the 
United States are for this constitutional 
change by a ratio of 3 to 1. The Gallup 
poll?a 3-to-1 count?which was released 
last week, is in keeping with the many 
polls that have be?i taken by various 
Members of the House in their respec-
tive congressional districts. 
For a year now, many of you have 
good naturedly needled me for "more 
action" on this legislation. At the lunch 
counter, at the dining room table, on the 
floor, behind the rail, in the cloakroom, 
on the train between buildings, you have 
"kidded" me to "get with it." Now that 
you have action and a powerful friend 
and ally, I would admonish you to quit 
talking and go to work on our 41 col-
leagues who are against the legislation 
and those 67 others who have expressed 
some doubt. Surely, the 254 who are 
strong for the measure here in the House 
do not need any persuasive conversation. 
COMMENT ON THE PROPOSF.T) 4-
YEAR TERM FOR MEMBERS OF 
THE HOUSE 
(Mr. ROUSH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute, and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROUSH. Mr. Speaker, I am, and 
have been, an advocate of the 4-year 
term for Members of the Home. The 
increasing burdens of the office, the ex-
pense of campaigns, the ability through 
modern communication to keep close 
contact with his people, the need for 
undivided attention to the national prob-
lems are all persuasive. 
However, Mr. Speaker, even as I ap-
plaud the support of the administration 
for this idea I am critical of the pro-
posal as advocated by the administra-
tion. 
First. I feel that there should be an 
expression by the electorate on national 
issues every 2 years; a staggering of the 
terms would accomplish this goal. 
Second. I see no reason to insert in the 
necessary constitutional amendment a 
limitation which would prevent a Mem-
ber of the House from running for the 
Senate unless his term had expired or 
unless he resigns. Surely such a provi-
sion is not necessary to induce these 
statesmen who serve in the other body 
to vote for such an amendment. 
I am unalterably opposed to clutter-
ing up a constitutional amendment with 
such a limitation. I hasten to add I am 
not and probably never will be a candi-
date for the Senate. 
ERRONEOUS STORY ABOUT SUM-
MER POST OFFICE JOB 
(Mr. JACOBS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extead his re-
marks.) 
Mr. JACOBS. Mr. Speaker, I should 
like, this morning, to pay my respects 
to the Washington Post. 
On September 14, 1965, the Washing-
ton Post said I had got a summer post 
office job for one of my relatives. Never 
doubt that the Washington Post prints 
the news. It was news to me, especially 
since it was not true. 
Well, they were pretty nice about it. 
January 24, 1966 
They ran a correction containing a 
regret. 
But I must confess that when, on Jan-
uary 22, 1966, the Washington Post re-
ran the same erroneous story about the 
same alleged job for the same alleged 
relative, it did get to be a bit of a bore. 
Besides, some of my relatives are be-
ginning to find out and complain about 
the job discrimination. 
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PRO-
GRAM OF PUERTO RICO 
(Mr. POLANCO-ABREU asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mi. POLANCO-ABREU. Mr. Speaker, 
poverty has always been the number one 
enemy of Puerto Rico. Twenty years ago, 
in order to destroy this foe, Puerto Rico 
embarked upon an industrial develop-
ment program with the object of raising 
living standards for all its people and 
particularly for its working people in 
the cities and in the fields. Its interest 
was and is in the educational and eco-
nomic opportunities for the poor. 
But in industrializing, Puerto Rico's 
policy was and is to create new industrial 
activity and to build on that base. 
Through these years, Puerto Rico's 
spokesmen have made it clear--and I 
emphasize this again today?that Puerto 
Rico neither seeks nor will shelter run-
away industries from any State. 
We seek only a small share of the an-
nual expansion of U.S. industrial capital. 
Mainland expansion of manufacturing 
capital in recent years has been about 4 
percent per year, adding 1,200,000 jobs 
annually. Puerto Rico has been develop-
ing at the rate of about 29,000 jobs per 
year, or about 1 for every 40 in the main-
land. 
I make these observations because 
there was raised in the record of this 
forum the question of minimum wages in 
Puerto Rico with the suggestion that 
Puerto Rico might be enticing industries 
from the mainland. The implication was 
that minimum wages in Puerto Rico are 
too low and that Puerto Rico is thus 
placed in a position of competitive ad-
vantage with the mainland firms. 
Mr. Speaker, the implication is false, 
and I maintain that it is unnecessarily 
damaging to the 2.4 million fellow citi-
zens living and working in the island. 
Puerto Rico will not build on the foun-
dation of misery for its people. We be-
long to the family of governments which 
advocates and strives for better things 
for its people?more jobs, higher wages, 
more education, better living, fuller em-
ployment. We have come far in this re-
spect, and in 1964 had advanced to $900 
per capita income as compared to $1,749 
per capita income in Alabama. Yes, we 
have come far by the standards of many 
nations in this hemisphere and in 
others, but we are still very poor in this 
respect as comparc d with any of the sis-
ter States of the Union. 
The real key to progress is fullest pos-
sible employment. Such a condition 
makes for simultaneous advance on all 
fronts. When employment rates fall, 
any community begins to disintegrate
