 B R I E FCODIFIDIENTIA&
 THE SOVIET PARTY CONGRESS   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 The formal presentation of "debate- speeches" at
 the 20th Soviet Party Congress ended on 20 February
 when the congress voted "unanimously" to approve "the
 political line and practical activity of the CPSU
 central committee.,"  The speeches generally rein-
 forced the. line set by Khrushchev on the successes
 of the Communist world, prophesying greater achievements
 in the future, and extolling the virtues of collective
 leadership.
 In announcing that war is no longer "fatalistically
 inevitable," FKhrushchev repudiated a dogma laid down
 by Lenin and confirmed in a revised form by Stalin.
 The present regime has thereby, in effect, established
 its right to create binding ideological precepts and
 has declared its refusal to be burdened in the
 execution of policy by its Stalinist inheritance.
 Under the heading of party affairs, Khrushchev
 called for the establishment of a bureau under the
 central committee of the Soviet Communist Party to
 deal with matters concerning the Russian Socialist
 Federated Soviet Republic in order to lighten the
 administrative load on the top leaders in the party
 presidium.   Khrushchev also recommended the writing of
 a new party history to replace Stalin's 1938 version,
 changes in the party rules, and an increase in the size
 of the party with stress on quality.  He also adjured
 the party to transfer more party members to work
 directly connected with industrial and agricultural
 production.
 Premier Bulganin's presentation of the Sixth
 Five-Year Plan and remarks on economic affairs by other
 leaders, while generally only restatements of familiar
 themes, pointed up the most pressing economic problems
 faced by the regime in maintaining a rapid rate of
 growth of Soviet economic strength.

 Public utterances of Arab and Israeli leaders
 continue to be keyed to the possibility of hostilities
 this spring, despite some relaxation of tension following
 Israeli prime minister Ben-Gurion's statement last week
 that plans for the Banat Yacov canal have been "shelved"
 in the expectation that Ambassador Johnston would again
 visit the area.

 Soviet Campaign Against US Balloons Continues:   The USSR
 has rejected the United States' contention that
 balloon flights do not endanger air transport and
 has offered to organize exhibitions of captured
 American balloons and equipment in Western countries
 to prove the validity of Soviet protests.    Moscow
 is also exploiting the balloon issue to discredit
 President Eisenhower's mutual aerial inspection
 plan.   F_             I .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    Page   1

 East German regime has been making plans to seal
 off its territory from West Berlin and West
 Germany, allegedly in order to improve currency

 stem the escape of military-age refugees which

 the initiation of these measures reportedly is

 Struggle Developing Over Successor to Hatoyama:
 Japanese Liberal-Democratic Party leaders have
 agreed to the election of Prime Minister Hatoyama
 to the party presidency in April and to his
 remaining in office for three to six months there-
 after.  The decision has focused the factional
 struggle within the party on the choice of its
 vice president, who probably will succeed the
 prime minister to both the top party and govern-
 ment posts.  Liberal Party Secretary General
 Shinsuke Kishi is the leading contender.

 Japan Considering Expanded Relations With Communist China:
 The Hatoyama government's intention to place greater
 emphasis on relations with Communist China, as re-
 ported in the Japanese press, suggests a bid for
 popular support of this course.                        .    Page  3    25X1
 Communist China to Adopt Latin Alphabet:   The Chinese
 Communists' proposal to introduce the use of a
 Latin alphabet contrasts with the measures taken
 by the USSR to replace Latin by Cyrillic scripts in
 Central Asia.  Peiping justifies the new alphabet
 on the "long historical tradition" of Latin letters
 in China.   The USSR may have exerted no strong
 pressures on the Chinese in favor of Cyrillic,
 thereby  avoiding any charges of "cultural imperi-
 alism."                      .  .  .  .  .  .          ?    .  .  .  .    s    .    Page  5
 South Vietnam: As the 4 March date for national assembly

 Kabul.  Primary attention at the moment is
 apparently being given to development of trans-
 portation facilities, but Moscow reportedly has
 also approved an irrigation project and offered
 an additional loan of $12,000,000 to an Afghan
 government-controlled textile company.

 minister residing in Algeria is confronted with
 the task of defining a policy in the face of
 settler hostility and Algerian Moslem pressure.
 Rebel activity remains at a high level, and the
 first large-scale desertion of native troops
 took place between 19 and 20 February.  Negoti-
 ations- between France and the Moroccan nation-
 alists to work out a new treaty relationship were
 25X1        formally opened on 15 February.   New Tunisian
 negotiations for further concessions will open
 soon in Paris.   I              I .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .    Page  10

 The Peruvian Revolt:   The regime of General Odria in
 Peru appears to be permanently weakened as a re-

 SOVIET VIEWS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A WESTERN ECONOMIC
 CRISIS .  .  .  .  .            .  .  .  .  .  .     .     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page  1
 Khrushchev's statement at the 20th Party Congress on
 the possibility of an economic crisis in the West reflects
 the belief that the USSR can capitalize on any Western
 economic difficulties to increase its international
 influence.  The Soviet leaders may believe that continued
 pressure for general disarmament can succeed in reducing
 the level of Western arms production and thus remove what
 Communist spokesmen have frequently described as an
 artificial stimulant forestalling a capitalist depression.
 Khrushchev's diagnosis reflects a belief that the West will
 inevitably face substantial economic difficulties and that
 these may occur soon.  He did not commit himself to any
 specific timing for such a depression, however, and the
 speech of First Deputy Premier Mikoyan later at the congress
 suggests even more strongly that the leaders are uncertain
 co
 ncerning the timing of the crisis they expect in the West.

 WEST GERMAN POLICY TOWARD EAST GERMANY AND THE USSR .  .  .    Page
 West Germany is faced with strong inducements' for
 dealing with the Soviet Union and East Germany: the desire
 for national unification or, failing this, for contacts
 with the East German population;  the necessity to cope with
 East German demands respecting Berlin access; and a moderate
 desire for trade with the East.   It has been apparent for
 some time that a large proportion of West Germans would
 accept neutrality in return for unity, and there is a grow-
 ing disposition to deal with the East Germans.   Nevertheless,
 the Bonn government does not presently appear inclined to
 enter unilateral negotiations with Moscow or to recognize

 CHINESE COMMUNIST MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS IN 1955   .  .  .  .    Page   10
 Peiping's program for the modernization of its
 armed forces made considerable progress in 1955.  Now
 in possession of a ground force equal in size to that
 of the Soviet Union and the world's fourth largest air
 force, the Chinese Communists, with continuing and
 substantial Soviet assistance, are growing steadily in
 military power.  Peiping's greatest military priorities
 have been devoted to the preparation of offensive and
 defensive facilities in the coastal area opposite
 Taiwan and the offshore islands.

 23 February 1956
 The formal presentation of
 "debate speeches" at the 20th
 Party Congress ended on 20
 February when the congress voted
 unanimously to approve "the
 political line and practical
 activity of the CPSU Central
 Committee."
 The speeches generally re-
 inforced the line set by Khrush-
 chev in his 14 February speech
 on the successes of the Commu-
 nist world, prophesying greater
 achievements in the future, and
 extolling the virtues of col-
 lective leadership.
 Foreign Policy
 Foreign Minister Molotov's
 speech was largely devoted to
 a faithful repetition of the
 foreign policy and doctrinal
 themes laid down by Khrushchev.
 His most notable statement was
 an admission that the Foreign
 Affairs Ministry had been
 guilty of "underestimating the
 new possibilities" of the post-
 war period and had been criti-
 cized for this by the central
 committee.
 Molotov stressed particularly
 the need for flexibility in
 foreign policy, the importance
 of friendship with non-Socialist
 countries which oppose military
 blocs, and the importance of
 working-class unity between So-
 cialist and Communist parties,
 suggesting that he was blamed
 for dragging his feet in de-
 veloping these tactics.
 Military Affairs
 Defense Minister Marshal
 Zhukov asserted that the USSR
 is "protected by diverse atomic
 and thermonuclear weapons,
 powerful rocket-propelled and
 jet-propelled armaments of
 various types, including long-
 range missiles."  Mikoyan
 stressed that Soviet military
 strength is an effective deter-
 rent to Western initiation of
 war against the Soviet Union.
 Stating that there were atomic
 and hydrogen bombs in the USSR
 as well as in America and that
 these could be carried to "any
 point of the earth by aircraft
 or rockets," Mikoyan warned
 that "in the event of American
 aggression, hydrogen bombs can
 in return fall on American
 cities too...."  Zhukov also.
 noted that Soviet retaliatory
 atomic blows would "destroy
 millions of lives and immense
 wealth in countries which are
 America's allies."
 Other speakers at the
 congress lauded Soviet military
 strength while stressing that
 it was maintained solely for
 defense purposes.
 Mikoyan said in his speech
 that a serious discrepancy
 exists between the supply of
 goods and the population's fi-
 nancial resources, thus admitting
 the existence of inflationary

 pressures in the Soviet economy.
 His remedy for the situation is
 to make further price reductions
 only when warranted by an in-
 crease in supply relative to
 the purchasing power of the
 population.
 Kaganovich discussed re-
 vision of wages and norms,
 which he said had been basical-
 ly unchanged since 1932.  The
 revision, which is apparently
 proceeding very slowly, will be
 aimed at decreasing the propor-
 tion of take-home pay received
 as bonuses--which now comprises
 40 to 60 percent of the total--
 by raising basic wages and out-
 put norms.
 Premier Bulganin's presenta-
 tion of the Sixth Five-Year Plan
 directives was largely a re-
 statement of well-known economic
 themes. He gave new investment
 data, however, which, compared
 with the 1956 budget, show that
 a shift of funds from agriculture
 to consumer goods industries is
 planned to occur in the late
 1950's, presumably when higher
 agricultural output will re-
 quire larger processing capac-
 ity in light industry.
 Bulganin discarded the
 traditional Soviet maxim that
 obsolescence of equipment is
 peculiar to capitalism and
 impossible under Socialism.
 His attack on economists hold-
 ing to this Marxist view clears
 the way for a more realistic
 policy of replacing outmoded
 machinery-which, under previous
 policy, would have remained in
 use until it was beyond repair.
 Surpassing the United
 States in per capita production
 remains the "main economic
 task" of the USSR, according to
 all the speakers who have dealt
 with economic affairs.
 Ideology
 In announcing that war is
 no longer "fatalistically in-
 evitable," Khrushchev repudiated
 a dogma laid down by Lenin and
 confirmed in a revised form by
 Stalin.   The present regime has
 thereby, in effect, established
 its right to create binding
 ideological precepts and de-
 clared its refusal to be bur-
 dened in the execution of policy
 by its Stalinist inheritance.
 Since the end of World
 War II, there have been many
 signs that Communist theoreti-
 cians have been uncomfortable
 with Lenin's assertion that
 war is inevitable as long as
 capitalism survives.   On the
 eve of the last party congress
 in 1952, however, Stalin em-
 phatically refused to abandon
 the doctrine entirely.   He
 stated:   "It is said that Lenin'.s
 thesis that imperialism in-
 evitably gives birth to wars
 should be considered obsolete
 since powerful peoples'  forces
 have now grown up which are
 taking a stand in defense of
 peace,  against a new world war.
 This is not correct.... In order
 to eliminate the inevitability
 of wars,  imperialism must be
 destroyed."
 In denying this view,
 Khrushchev has accomplished
 two things. He has reoriented
 Communist ideology to square
 it with a more realistic ap-
 praisal of the strategic situa-
 tion,  acknowledging the dis-
 astrous consequences that would
 result from general war in the
 nuclear age.   He has,,further-
 more, cleared the decks for a
 more vigorous pursuit of the
 policy of "competitive peace-
 ful coexistence."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 February 1956
 The denial of "inevitable
 war" is probably linked with
 another doctrinal revision by
 Khrushchev--the assertion that
 Communists may win political
 power in capitalist countries
 through nonviolent means.   Both
 revisions'seem'.designed to give
 Soviet policy the stamp of
 respectability and to remove
 the suspicion that professions
 of peaceful intent are merely
 a screen for conspiratorial
 activity.
 A follow-up speech delivered.
 to    the .party,  congress by pre-
 sidium member Mikoyan betrays
 Soviet embarrassment on this
 last point. He posed the ques-
 tion of how long peaceful co-
 existence will last, and stated,
 "Our enemies interpret it to
 mean that we are...allegedly in
 favor of spreading Communism to
 the whole world by means of war
 but that we are supposed not to
 be ready this year and want
 peaceful coexistence until such
 time as we are well prepared
 and can attack.....This is slan-
 der of our policy."
 Mikoyan also questioned
 other Stalinist pronouncements.
 In speaking of Stalin's
 Economic Problems of Socialism
 as it pertains to the economy
 of contemporary capitalism,
 Mikoyan said, "It is doubtful
 that we can be helped by it
 and it is doubtful whether it
 is correct."
 Mikoyan was one of the most
 vigorous in decrying the cult
 of Stalin and praising the bene-
 fits of collective leadership.
 His remarks suggest that the
 rehabilitation of some of the
 Old Bolsheviks eliminated by
 Stalin in the great purges, of
 the 1930's might be undertaken
 in the new volume.
 Besides the historians,
 the philosophers and economists
 were also accused of being
 "insolvent before the party."
 PART I
 Again Stalinist distortions
 and restrictions were blamed
 and a new era of creative
 ideological thinking and
 objective economic analysis
 was called for.
 The congress showed that
 ideology is now beinr  tailored
 to fit 'policy, as much as at anytime
 in the past. The regime has. demon-
 strated that for the moment it
 is more interested in creating
 a supple,' pragmatic policy than
 in preserving traditional dogmas
 which hamper its execution.
 Party Affairs
 Khrushchev on 14 February
 called for the establishment
 of a bureau under the central
 committee of the Soviet Commu-
 nist Party (CPSU) to deal with
 matters. concerning the Russian
 Soviet Federated Socialist
 Republic (RSFSR), the writing
 of a new party history, changes
 in the party rules, and an in-
 crease in the size of the party
 with the stress on quality.
 He also adjured the party to
 transfer more party members to
 work directly connected with
 production.
 The organization of a
 "Bureau of the CPSU Central
 Committee for the RSFSR" is a
 logical extension of the or-
 ganizational principle first
 employed some time ago when
 Departments of Agriculture  and
 of Party Organs were created
 "for the RSFSR" in the central
 committee apparatus. The new
 bureau, according to Khrushchev,
 is needed to provide "more con-
 crete and efficient leadership"
 in the RSFSR, the only Soviet
 republic which does not have
 a republic party organization.
 The new bureau presumably
 will correspond to the party
 bureaus already existing in the
 other 15 republics, but will
 differ in the method of its

 selection, i.e., it will be
 "elected" by the all-union
 central committee instead of a
 republic central committee.
 Members will probably be
 chosen from among leading Oblast
 party leaders and ministers of
 the RSFSR.   Likely choices in-
 clude RSFSR premier Yasnov,
 Moscow Oblast party boss Kapito-
 nov, Leningrad Oblast party
 boss Kozlov, and Moscow city
 party chief Furtseva.
 The new bureau presumably
 is being formed to lighten
 the administrative load on the
 all-union party presidium,
 which heretofore has had the
 task of dealing directly with
 each of the RSFSR's 78 oblasts,
 krais and autonomous republics
 as well as with the other 15
 republics.
 Success of the two depart-
 ments "for the RSFSR" ii  han-
 .dling agricultural and party
 organizational matters in the
 Russian republic may have been
 instrumental in the decision
 to create the RSFSR .bureau.
 Soviet leaders apparently
 prefer this-method of providing;
 leadership for the RSFSR to
 the organization of a Russian
 republic party because the
 latter would completely over-
 shadow the other republics'
 parties and adversely affect
 Soviet nationality policy.
 Khrushchev also called
 for amendments to the party
 statutes as rewritten in 1952
 to accommodate this and other
 organizational changes and
 rules of procedure "dictated
 by life."  One amendment has
 already been made necessary
 by the expansion of the sec-
 retariats of oblast and republic
 party committees beginning in
 1954,
 Other amendments will
 permit the republics divided
 into oblasts (the Ukraine,
 Belorussia, Kazakhstan and
 Uzbekistan) to hold party con-
 gresses once every four years
 rather than every two years,
 modify the time limits for
 holding plenary sessions of
 party committees, and abolish
 local representatives of the
 party control committee.
 The Kommunist editorial
 in September      which crit-
 icized Molotov's ideological
 error called for the writing
 of a party history covering
 the years since the Short
 Course History was wr itt`en
 t-K`irushchev, however,
 demanded a completely new
 textbook "based on historical
 facts" and bringing the history
 of the party up to date.
 The lengthy theses on the
 50th anniversary of Bolshevism
 in 1953 went a long way in
 revising the party history as
 contained in the Short Course
 History.   The theses were too
 brief , however, to serve as a
 party textbook.   A new textbook
 is apparently needed to "rewrite'
 history to change Stalin's
 role in the light of current
 emphasis of the virtues of
 collective leadership and the
 new line on peaceful coexistence
 and the nonviolent path to
 Communism.
 These principles will
 probably also be emphasized in
 the new party program yet to be
 written.   The present party
 program was written in .1919.
 The 18th Party Congress in 1939
 scheduled its revision and so
 did the 19th congress in 1952.
 The war was undoubtedly in-
 strumental in the failure of the
 1939 program revision committee

 to perform its function, and
 Stalin's death and the result-
 ing political reconstruction
 probably account for the ab-
 sence of a draft program at
 this congress.   Khrushchev
 considers it necessary to co-
 ordinate the draft program
 with a lonst-range elan for
 future cultural and economic
 development,  so it is prob-
 lematical whether a new party
 program will be developed by
 the time the next congress
 meets.
 An increase in the size of
 the party was demanded, to be
 achieved by admitting into
 party ranks leading workers,
 particularly from the "main
 professions, leading collective
 farmers and the best portion
 of the Soviet intelligentsia."
 Such a selective increase in
 the party's size would prob-
 ably reduce still further the
 percentage of party members
 drawn from the industrial
 proletariat and reinforce
 the elite character of the
 party.
 Khrushchev, however, at
 the same time castigated party
 leaders for considering "party
 work one thing and economic
 and state work another."  He
 insisted that party officials
 should study technology,
 agronomy,  and production.
 Furthermore, more Communists
 should work directly at pro-
 duction.                       Over 3,000,000 party
 members live in rural areas,
 but less than half of these,
 Khrushchev complained, work
 directly on collective farms,
 machine-tractor stations
 and state farms.

 ARAB-ISRAELI SITUATION
 Public utterances of Arab
 and Israeli leaders continue to
 be keyed to the possibility of
 hostilities this spring,
 despite some relaxation of ten-
 sion following Israeli prime
 minister Ben-Gurion's statement
 last week that plans for the
 Banat Yacov canal have been
 "shelved" in the expectation
 that Ambassador Johnston would
 again visit the area.   The Is-
 raeli Foreign Ministry has inter-
 preted Ben-Gurion's statement,
 which apparently was not co-
 ordinated with his cabinet, to
 mean that Israel's policy on
 Banat Yacov has not changed and
 that work on the canal will be-
 gin when weather permits--pre-
 sumably in April--unless prcg-
 ress  toward a water settlement
 is made.
 "War fever" seems particu-
 larly acute in Syria.   Syrians
 reportedly fired on Israeli
 fishermen on Lake Tiberias on
 23 February.   Syria's air force
 is in its best condition yet,
 with 11 jets and four conven-
 tional fighters reported ready
 for combat.
 While all reports agree
 that Egyptian premier Nasr has
 warned the Syrians to go slow,
 he has made clear that Egypt
 will come to Syria's aid if
 necessary.   Syrian prime minis -
 ter.: Ghazzi has indicated that
 he recognizes the dangers of
 the present state of mind in
 Syria and has said that public
 opinion must be calmed.   Ghazzi's
 political position is so weak,
 however, that he probably
 cannot afford to be less belli-
 cose than the army officers on
 whom his government is dependent.
 Meanwhile, the Egyptian ini-
 tiative to resume discussions of
 the Johnston plan for development
 of the Jordan River seems to have
 died a-borning.   The Lebanese prime
 minister has said no Arab govern-
 ment could accept the plan under
 present conditions, and Nasr re-
 portedly did not raise the issue
 during his recent talks with the
 Jordanian prime minister. Nasr
 later stated that the current
 atmosphere is not auspicious for
 new talks on the water problem.

 Israel's drive for arms has
 been stepped up still further.

 on 16 February that he did not know
 whether "friendly countries"
 would supply the materiel Israel

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Soviet Campaign Against
 V5 Balloons Continues
 The USSR followed up its
 display of captured American
 balloons and equipment at a
 press conference in Moscow with
 a second note to the United
 States on 18 February.   The
 note repeated earlier charges
 that the "real purpose" of the
 balloon operations is aerial
 photography of Soviet territory,
 and rejected the US contention
 that the balloons do not en-
 danger air transport.
 Moscow took note of the
 statement in the United States'
 note of 8 February that the
 American government "will seek
 to avoid the launching of ad-
 ditional balloons which.. .might
 transit the USSR," but, in an
 apparent attempt to interpret
 this as a stronger commitment,
 stated that the United States
 had promised to take the "neces-
 sary measures to prevent the
 further release" of these bal-
 loons.
 Moscow also offered to
 organize exhibitions of captured
 balloons in New York, Washing-
 ton, London, Paris and else-
 where to demonstrate the
 "soundness of the assertions
 made by the Soviet government."

 East German employ-

 will be banned, and
 a crackdown will be
 made on illegal mone-

 If increased re-

 is little likelihood
 that there will be
 any serious inter-
 ference by the Com-
 munists with Allied
 access to Berlin through East
 Germany or Allied rights of
 access to East Berlin.
 Any closure of the Berlin
 border would probably be under-
 taken because an intensification
 of recruitment is in prospect.

 have been supplemented by in-

 assisting people to escape from
 East Germany.   Two of the ac-

 These sentences, however, were

 .Struggle Developing Over
 Successor to Ha-toyama
 Japanese Libera.1-Democratic
 Party leaders have agreed to
 the election of Prime Minister
 Hatoyama to the party presi-
 dency in April and to his re-
 maining in office for three to
 six months thereafter.  The
 decision has focused the fac-
 tional struggle within the
 party on the choice of its
 vice president, who probably
 will succeed the prime minister
 in the top party and government
 posts.                             -
 Party secretary general
 Shinsuke Kishi, an influential
 promoter of the recent conserv-
 ative merger, appears to have
 the best chance to succeed
 Hotoyama,  but   he does not have
 his party's unanimous support.
 He has long planned that the
 party's old guard, as personi-
 fied by Ha.toyama, and former
 Liberal Party president Ogata,
 would forsake active politics
 to become senior advisers and
 that the young political leaders
 would take over the reins of
 conservative   leadership.
 Oga.ta.'s death and Ha.toyama's
 unwillingness to step aside
 have thwarted these plans.
 However, present information
 suggests that Kishi still plans
 to succeed Ha.toyama.
 Conservative old-guard
 politicians, fully cognizant
 Japan Considering Expanded
 'Relations With Communist   China
 The Hatoyama government's
 intention to place greater em-
 phasis on relations with Com-
 of Kishi's political a.spira-
 tions, have recently combined
 forces in_an attempt to pre-
 serve their authority in the
 party and head off his drive
 for the party leadership.   Led
 by Tsuruhei Ma.tsuno, a. member
 of the Diet upper house, the
 group has constituted itself
 a, senior board to be consulted
 on all questions of importance
 to the party,  including the
 selection of the party vice
 president.   It is doubtful,
 however,  that they will be
 able to select from among
 their own ranks a candidate
 of sufficient stature to win
 the party presidency.
 The Liberal-Democratic
 merger has provided a basis for
 stabilizing conservative poli-
 tics in Japan, but must still
 overcome the handicaps which
 have chronically beset the
 conservative forces:   personal
 ambition,  the inability of any
 faction to dominate the party,
 and the unwillingness of all
 the factions to compromise.
 Whether the younger party lead-
 ers will be able to name Ha.to-
 yama.'s successor probably will
 depend on their ability to rec-
 oncile these conflicts and to
 agree upon an order of preced-
 ence for their succession to
 the top posts.

 course, and an attempt to es-
 tablish Japan's position in
 future talks with the United
 States.
 A 500-page study by the
 Foreign Ministry states that
 Communist China can no longer
 be ignored and that the people
 have the utmost trust in Mao
 Tse-tung.   It also notes that
 Japanese talks with Peiping
 will almost inevitably follow
 the conclusion of the Soviet-
 Japanese talks in London.
 In concluding that the
 Chiang government on Taiwan
 is faced with a problem of
 deteriorating morale, Japan
 may have been influenced by
 Peiping's recently stepped-up
 campaign to induce defections,
 even though there is no avail-
 able evidence that high-level
 Chinese Nationalist officials
 have seriously considered the
 offers.
 Japan's long-standing de-
 sire'for closer relations with
 Peiping has been intensified
 in recent months by the ex-
 pectation of a.relaxation of
 the China embargo and by the
 desire to move quickly to
 establish a foothold in the
 China market before Western
 European and other nations
 capture it.   The Japanese dis-
 count the effectiveness of
 trade sanctions against Communist
 PART II
 China and are reportedly fear-
 ful of losing the China market
 permanently unless controls are
 relaxed.
 Last fall the Hatoyama
 government approached the
 United States for support of
 a proposal that items of partic-
 ular .. importance to Sino-Japa-
 nese trade be released from
 the embargo against Communist
 China., Japanese leaders feel
 that some such concession  is
 necessary to relieve domestic
 business pressure,
 The Japanese government
 is considering approval of
 the exhibition of embargoed
 goods at Japanese trade fairs
 scheduled to be held in Com-
 munist China next fall.   It
 points to the division of
 opinion in CHINCOM on this
 subject as evidence that other
 nations may plan to do like-
 wise to beat their competitors
 to the China, market.
 When unofficial Sino-
 Japanese talks are held this
 spring to renew last year's
 unofficial trade and fisheries
 agreement, the Hatoyama govern-
 ment will have an opportunity
 to expand official relations.

 Communist China to Adopt4
 Latin Alphabet
 The Chinese Communists'
 proposal to introduce the use
 of a Latin alphabet contrasts
 with the measures taken by the
 USSR  to  replace  Latin  by
 Cyrillic scripts in Central
 Asia.
 The Latin alphabet has no
 special advantages over Cyrillic
 for rendering Chinese sounds.
 A Chinese Communist predisposi-
 tion against Latin seemed indi-
 cated in August  1955,   when
 Peiping authorized the use of
 Outer Mongolia's Cyrillic script
 by the Mongols in China. Peiping
 justified its eventual deter-
 mination on Latin letters for
 the Chinese language in large
 part on the basis of the "long
 historical tradition" of Latin
 letters in China--a rationali-
 zation which must have carried
 little weight  with  Soviet
 linguists who had successfully
 effected the transition from
 Latin to Cyrillic in Soviet
 Asia during World War II.
 Throughout the 1920's and
 most of the 1930's, the USSR
 favored the adoption of Latin
 rather than Cyrillic script
 by its Central Asian minorities.
 After 1939, however, the Latin
 alphabets of the Tajik, Kirghiz,
 Kazakh, and other minority
 nationalities in the USSR were
 abandoned for Cyrillic scripts
 in the course of a general
 trend to Russification.   In
 rationalizing the shift from
 Latin to Cyrillic in 1941,
 Outer Mongolia deferred to
 the USSR by observing that
 "the future development of the
 country's culture can progress
 only through a, strengthening of
 fraternal relations with the'
 peoples of the Soviet Union
 and through a. mastering of their
 culture."
 Soviet linguists themselves
 played a leading role in the
 "long historical tradition" by
 helping develop a Latin script
 which the Chinese Communists
 employed to a limited extent
 in the 1930's.   In at least one
 of their border regions, it was
 given equal status with Chinese
 ideographs as authorized script
 for official documents.   However,
 sometime in the 1940's, soon
 after the Soviet Union came to
 favor Cyrillic in the Asiatic
 USSR, the Chinese Communists
 dropped their campaign to pro-
 mote the Latin alphabet.
 Previous proposals in China.
 to introduce an alphabet have
 aroused resentment among many
 intellectuals, who maintained

 Excerpt from Communist China's constitution in traditional characters
 that Chinese culture itself
 was endangered by such reforms
 in the language.   The Communists
 this time are endeavoring to

 that the new letters "no longer

 As the 4 March date for

 them are assuming a more threat-

 conceding that Diem undoubtedly
 will win, has called for a
 "massive boycott" and stated
 that the Vietnamese people will
 turn the elections into "a
 bloody reply to the Americans
 and their lackeys."  Current
 indications are that the Viet
 Minh will attempt to disrupt
 the elections by covert means.

 Diem considers it imperative
 that a reliable assembly be

 lature's first task will be
 to adopt his draft constitution
 and thus complete the reorgani-

 the referendum last October dis-
 placing Bao Dai as chief of
 state.
 The still unpublished draft
 constitution reportedly grants
 overriding authority to the
 president,  including the power
 to dissolve the assembly "in
 cases of serious conflict with
 the government."   Diem has also
 announced that an advisory
 economic and social council,
 composed of farm,  labor,  busi-
 ness and professional repre-
 sentatives,  will soon be
 created to "supplement" the
 national assembly. He is said
 to feel the creation of such a

 a political assembly and will

 Czechs are said to be preparing

 The USSR seems to be ex-
 ploring new possibilities of
 economic penetration through a
 reported offer of a $12,000,000
 loan to an Afghan textile com-
 pany.   This apparently is not
 a direct government-to-govern-
 ment deal, as was the $100,-
 000,000 credit, although the
 Afghan government owns 51 per-
 cent of the textile company
 stock.
 Greek Election Results
 The parliamentary majority
 which Greek prime minister Kar-
 amanlis won in the 19 February
 elections is sizable enough to
 permit him some freedom in car-
 rying out the "progressive" pro-
 gram that he has promised.
 Popular support for his govern-
 ment depends on his ability to
 satisfy popular demands for
 economic progress and to settle
 outstanding international issues
 in a way satisfactory to public
 opinion.
 Nearly complete returns
 indicate that Karamanlis' Na-
 tional Radical Union (ERE) will
 control at least 161 out of the
 300 seats in the new parliament,
 compared to the 200 it had in
 the final days of the last
 parliament.   There is some chance
 that the prime minister may pick
 up one or two additional seats
 when the soldier vote is com-
 pleted.
 Press reports indicate that
 three center leaders of the
 Popular Front have already
 broken away from their alliance
 with the Communist-front EDA.
 Liberal Party chief Papandreou,
 Liberal Democratic Union head
 Venizelos, and Populist Party
 leader Tsaldaris have announced
 that they will support Karaman-
 lis on foreign policy matters.
 PART II
 The presence of Soviet
 personnel in Afghan government
 offices suggests that the cau-
 tion observed by both Afghans
 and Russians in their past rela-
 tions is breaking down.  Public
 opinion in Kabul reportedly sup-
 ports the government's apparent
 willingness to accept most So-
 viet offers.   However, overly
 aggressive Soviet activity
 could provoke a slowdown in of-
 ficial Afghan co-operation.
 (Concurred in
 by ORR)
 This will involve the addition
 of about 75 seats to Karamanlis'
 parliamentary strength and should
 enable him to resist success-
 fully EDA's demands for a neutral
 Greece.
 The left-wing parties won
 about 45 seats in the new
 parliament, compared to five in
 the previous one.   EDA won
 about 18 seats and the fellow-
 traveling Democratic Party
 (DKEL) about 20, apparently the
 largest bloc of Communist-con-
 trolled deputies in Greek history.
 This delegation can probably do
 little to obstruct the function-
 ing of parliament but it does
 give the Communists the respect-
 ability they have been seeking
 and provides a forum for their
 propaganda.
 The political future of
 Karamanlis probably now depends
 on his ability to win popular
 confidence--he polled fewer
 votes than the Popular Front--
 by carrying on a vigorous cam-
 paign for economic improvement.
 Likewise, he will have to cater
 to popular feeling in such emo-
 tionally charged issues as the
 Cyprus dispute with Britain and
 Greek-Turkish relations, al-
 though support of the center
 leaders will allow him some
 latitude.

 French Negotiations
 In North Africa
 ALGERIA
 Robert Lacoste,  the new
 French minister residing in
 Algeria, appears to be con-
 fronted with the practically
 impossible task of achieving
 an Alger'n settlement.   La-
 coste indicated to the American
 consul general on 16 February
 that his principal job is to
 see that "Algeria remains
 French."   Lacoste's attitude
 together with the confidence
 of French settler extremists
 that they have overawed Premier
 Mollet suggest that all the
 essential political decisions
 will not be made.
 Leaders among the moderate
 Algerian Moslems remain quiet
 and are, enjoying the spectacle
 of internecine French strife.
 Having warned that a government
 could expect a reaction within
 30 days of its formation if
 their minimum aspirations were
 not met,  these leaders appear
 to be biding their time until
 2 March.   Meanwhile, rebelac-
 tivity remains at a high level,
 and the first large-scale deser-
 tion of native troops in Algeria
 took place between 19 and 20
 February.
 Negotiations to define a
 new treaty relationship between
 France and Morocco were formally
 opened in Paris on 15 February
 by the sultan and President Coty.
 Because French negotiator's had
 not yet been selected, working-
 level discussions were postponed
 until 22 February.   In contrast
 with French unpreparedness and
 confusion,  the Moroccan delega-
 tion with a mandate from the
 Moroccan people was ready to
 press for very hard terms on
 national defense,  foreign affairs
 and economic matters.   In his
 formal remarks on 15 February,
 the sultan stated that Morocco
 must first be granted actual
 independence before negotiation
 of a new treaty which would de-
 fine its status of "interdepend-
 ence" with France.
 Meanwhile, French farmers
 in northern Morocco have de-
 clared in telegrams to the
 French government that they will
 abandon their farms because of
 the worsening security situation.
 Simultaneously, French authori-
 ties evacuated about 100 for
 estry guards in isolated areas
 as well as some 600 French
 residents in western Algeria
 in the face of renewed rebel
 activities by Berber tribesmen.
 French-Tunisian negotia-
 tions are to reopen on 27 Febru-
 ary, according to French offi-
 cials in Tunis and Paris.   Con-
 scious of the fact that Morocco
 has been promised independence
 while Tunisia was granted limited
 autonomy last June,  the Tunisian
 government on the eve of the
 general election scheduled for
 25 March is pressing for addi-
 tional concessions.
 In preparatory discussions
 earlier this month, Habib Bour--
 ghiba, president of the moderate
 nationalist Neo-Destour party,
 which is the dominant force in
 the present government,  indicated
 that Tunisia would be satisfied
 with a token national army and
 some diplomatic representation
 abroad.   At that time, France
 seemed disposed to make such
 concessions.

 Salvadoran Presidential Election
 El Salvador is nearing the
 climax of a long and  bitter
 election campaign.   The presi-
 dential election is scheduled
 for 4 March, and   there  is
 danger that violence or a mili-
 tary coup may occur before or
 shortly after that time.
 The opposition, which
 doubts it can win the election,
 has consistently attempted to
 provoke the government into
 taking repressive and unpopu-
 la.r measures, apparently in the
 hope of providing discontented
 army officers with justifica,
 tion for seizing the government.
 President Osorio, whose
 term ends in September, is con-
 fident that the administration
 has sufficient popular support
 to assure the election of his
 hand-picked successor, the mod-
 erate and capable Lt. Col. Jose
 Maria Lemus, who favors close
 co-operation with the United
 States.   Osorio wants to go
 down in history as one of the
 very few Salvadoran presidents
 to complete his term and turn
 the office over to a. constitu-
 tionally elected successor.
 The administration has thus
 far shown considerable restraint
 in reacting to opposition prov-
 ocations,..   Civil liberties
 have not been restricted.
 Three of the five opposi-
 tion'presidential candidates
 were. disqualified by the gov-
 ernment on technical grounds
 on 14 and 15 February.   The
 leading remaining opposition
 candidate, Lt. Col. Rafael Ca.r-
 ra.nza Ama.ya, has been described
 as nationalistic and a potential
 rightist dictator.   Though he is
 not known to have had close re-
 lations.with Communists,he may
 now be receiving the support of
 Communists who were active in
 the political organizations
 built up by the three disquali-
 fied candidates.

 PART III
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 SOVIET VIEWS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A WESTERN ECONOMIC CRISIS
 Khrushchev's remarks at
 the 20th Party Congress about
 an approaching economic crisis
 in the West reflect the belief
 that the USSR can capitalize on
 any Western economic difficulties
 to increase its international
 influence.   The Soviet leaders
 may believe that continued pres-
 sure for general disarmament
 can succeed in reducing the
 level of Western arms produc-
 tion and thus remove what Com-
 munist spokesmen have frequent-
 ly described as an artificial
 stimulant forestalling a capi-
 talist  depression.
 Khrushchev's diagnosis
 reflects a belief that the West
 will inevitably face substan-
 tial economic difficulties and
 that these may occur soon.   He
 did not commit himself, however,
 to any specific timing for such
 a depression.
 Khrushchev's Speech
 Khrushchev stated that
 "today the capitalist world is
 approaching the point at which
 the stimulating action of many
 of the  temporary  factors is
 becoming exhausted."  With re-
 gard to US industry specifical-
 ly,  he said,  "There is no pros-
 pect for a further substantial
 increase in production."  He
 asserted that the stability of
 the capitalist economies would
 in the future be determined
 largely by the situation in the
 capitalist world,  where "sub-
 stantial changes have taken
 place in recent years."
 that Moscow is calculating that
 a depression in the major capi-
 talist nations would give the
 underdeveloped countries serious
 difficulties in selling their
 raw materials.   The Soviet
 Union would doubtless step into
 the breach with attractive trade
 offers.
 First Deputy Premier Mi-
 koyan,  speaking to the party
 congress shortly after Khru-
 shchev,   praised the latter's
 analysis of contemporary capi-
 talism, but emphasized the con-
 tinuing growth of major Western
 economies. His lengthy de-
 scription of the weaknesses in.
 Soviet analyses of world capi-
 talism and his call for more
 accurate research shows that
 the present leadership is dis-
 satisfied with current analyses
 of this subject.   Mikoyan's
 statements suggests that he is
 even less certain than Khru-
 shchev as.to the timing of.the
 crisis the Soviet leaders ex-
 pect in the West.
 The remarks of Khrushchev
 and Mikoyan should be viewed
 against the background of Soviet
 thought on world capitalism
 throughout the postwar period.
 In particular, Khrushchev's
 references to Western rearmament
 as both a stimulant and a poison
 reflect the uncertainty and con-
 fusion among Soviet economists
 since Stalin's death about the
 precise economic implications
 of a high level of arms pro-
 duction.
 Background:   1946-1953

 which follows that of Soviet
 economic specialists, suggests

 Soviet economists on the anal-
 ysis of industrial cycle:  in
 capitalist countries strongly
 suggested that this was a sub-
 ject of debate among the top
 leaders themselves,  in their
 efforts to estimate the future
 relative strength of the Soviet
 Union and the United States.
 The publication in 1946
 of a book on capitalist econ-
 omies by Eugene Varga,  the
 foremost Soviet economist,
 touched off an ideological con-
 troversy which lasted more than
 two years.   Although Varga's
 prediction that at least ten
 years would elapse before a
 major economic depression e-
 rupted in the West was perhaps
 unpalatable to the regime,  the
 criticism against him was aimed
 primarily at his belief that
 World War II had brought about
 changes in the essential struc-
 ture of capitalism.
 Varga took the position
 that wartime exigencies had
 taught capitalist states the
 benefits of government plan-
 ning and intervention in the
 economy,  that capitalist states
 were becoming more sensitive
 to the interests of the working
 class and consumers, and that
 the war had altered relation-
 ships between colonial powers
 and their colonies.
 This analysis raised a
 strong possibility,  despite
 Varga's own prediction of a
 forthcoming Western depression,
 that capitalism might escape a
 final collapse entirely by
 making certain modifications
 in its basic structure.   Varga's
 critics, both professional and
 party, were quick to seize on
 these heretical propositions,
 and he was finally forced to
 recant publicly in early 1949.
 In October 1952, Stalin
 authoritatively set forth the
 Soviet view of the capitalist
 world economy in his Economic
 Problems of Socialism in t e
 R.   The major prem   a of
 this analysis was that the
 tide of Communist territorial
 expansion was ebbing temporarily
 as a result of the partial
 stabilization and consolidation
 of capitalism.   Stalin's
 emphasis on the internal and
 external "contradictions" in
 the capitalist world system
 placed the development and ag-
 gravation of a capitalist eco-
 nomic crisis in the indeterminate
 future.    The tone of the article
 was essencially one of "ultimate"
 events and of situations in the
 contemporary world which would
 not continue "forever and ever."
 View Since 1953
 The main stream of Soviet
 thought since 1953 on the capi-
 talist world economy had con-
 tinued to follow the course
 established during Stalin's
 last years.   Although the
 majority of economists followed
 the dictates of orthodoxy,  sorme,
 particularly those of high stand-
 ing,  skirted along heretical
 grounds in their efforts to
 report accurately and honestly
 the realities of capitalist
 economies.    Despite criticism
 by their colleagues,  these men

 did not back down, nor were
 they silenced officially.
 The book by Varga on capi-
 talist economies, published in
 August 1953 and acclaimed as an
 "outstanding comprehensive work,"
 reflected these trends partic-
 ularly well since it was mainly
 written prior to Stalin's death,
 but undoubtedly revised there-
 after'.   While parroting most of
 the stereotyped themes of post-
 war official dogma on capitalism,
 Varga raised an issue which has
 since become the subject of
 lively debate and the central
 problem of current Soviet thought
 on capitalism--the question of
 the effects of rearmament on
 capitalist economies.  .
 Varga challenged the
 .Stalinist propositions that
 rearmament in capitalist states--
 as in the USSR where full em-
 ployment of resources is planrd
 --leads directly and immediate-
 ly to a reduction of nonmili-
 tary-production and personal
 consumption.  He declared that
 military production under capi-
 talism, particularly in the
 United States, supplements rath-
 er than competes with other in-
 dustrial sectors.   While other
 contemporary Soviet economists
 accept the thesis that rearma-
 ment leads to a temporary up-
 swing in the business cycle,
 they denied Varga's view that
 military production supplement-
 ed industrial- production.
 Despite Varga's obvious
 heresy, wh is h  would negate
 the 'theory of the destructive
 PART III
 consequences of rearmament on
 ,capitalism, he has not yet been
 officially criticized.  An open
 debate,  the first real one in
 many years, continues to rage
 among Soviet economists:..
 Possible Change in Views
 The only recent exception
 to the failure of Soviet econ-
 omists to fix a firm date for
 the onset of a new Western cri-
 sis was a prediction in Septem
 ber 1955 by the economist A.
 Bechin that a depression might
 begin in the United States "in
 a few months."
 Writing in the journal
 Problems of Economics, Bechin
 argued that threebas c factors
 had stimulated production and
 postponed the beginning of a
 major depression in America
 since World War II:   the main-
 tenance of a high level, of
 military output, particularly
 since 1950; the large overseas
 markets available to the United
 States after 1945 as a result
 of wartime devastation  in
 Europe; and the.large invest-
 ment needs of American industry
 which had accumulated during
 the war years of maximum em-
 phasis on production and min-
 imum attention-,to replacement
 of worn-out equipment and
 facilities.
 Bechin concluded that
 these special conditions were
 coming to apply less and less
 to the American economy, and
 a depression might begin, even

 "in a few months."         While
 drawing his predictions in
 fairly sharp terms, however,
 he ended his article by calling
 for further serious investiga-
 tion of the subject.
 Although Bechin made a
 general denial of  Varga's
 theoretical point that mili-
 tary production supplements
 rather than reduces total in-
 dustrial output,  he pursued
 the same course in treating
 militarization as the Primary
 source of postwar American in-
 dustrial modernization and
 capital expansion.
 While he argued that there
 was little prospect for expand-
 ing American exports and capi-
 tal investment in the near fu-
 ture, he failed to mention the
 future outlook for military
 production.   Hence,   it   is
 reasonable to infer from Be-
 chin's healthy regard for the
 stimulating economic effects
 of US military production that
 he predicated his estimate of
 an approaching economic crisis
 on the assumption that defense
 expenditures would soon decline.
 Importance of Foreign Trade
 In addition,  the heavy
 stress placed by Bechin on the
 importance of foreign trade to
 Western economies indicates a
 belief that the capitalist
 world market may in the future
 become a critical arena, con-
 ditioning the development of a
 Western economic crisis.   The
 tour of Khrushchev and Bulganin
 through Asia highlights recent
 events  which  suggest  that
 Stalin's successors are convinced
 economic policy can be used to
 reduce the areas of  Western
 influence and even to exacerbate
 the internal difficulties in
 capitalist economies.
 Even though Bechin's views
 have not been reiterated in So-
 viet propaganda, they appear to
 reflect the thinking of in-
 fluential elements in the So-
 viet hierarchy.
 Two previous works by this
 author have acted as harbingers
 of shifts in Soviet domestic
 policies and propaganda.   In
 April 1953, Bechin intimated
 that Marxist theory permitted
 a narrowing of the gap between
 the growth rate for consumer
 industry and heavy industry in
 the USSR, four months  before
 Malenkov's public announcement
 of the "new course."   In July
 1954, six months before the
 return to unopposed priority
 for heavy industry,  he harshly
 criticized those economists
 who were arguing that the
 growth of consumer industry
 should exceed that of heavy
 industry during the "transition
 to Communism."
 Although Khrushchev, at
 the party congress, failed to
 adopt Bechin's specific predic-
 tion of the outbreak of the
 expected capitalist crisis, his
 analysis followed the same
 lines as Bechin's.   He prob-
 ably felt it both unnecessary
 and risky to associate himself
 publicly with such   a  specula-
 tive pronouncement.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 February 1956
 WEST GERMAN POLICY TOWARD EAST GERMANY AND THE USSR
 West Germany is faced
 with strong inducements for
 dealing with the Soviet Union
 and East Germany:   the desire
 for national unification or,
 failing this, for contacts with
 the East German population;
 the necessity to cope with
 East German demands respecting
 access to Berlin; and a moderate
 desire for trade with the East.
 It has been apparent for some
 time that a large proportion
 of West Germans would accept
 neutrality in return for unity,
 and there is a growing disposi-
 tion to deal with the East
 Germans.   Nevertheless,  the
 Bonn government does not pres-
 ently appear inclined to enter
 unilateral negotiations with
 Moscow or to recognize East
 Germany.
 It is the consensus of
 all West German political
 parties and all sections of
 the press that German unifica-
 tion is the first order of
 public business.  The persist-
 ence of this theme is apparent
 despite the impression left by
 the Geneva. foreign ministers'
 conference last fall that Mos-
 cow will not permit unification
 on any terms in the foreseeable
 future.
 Chancellor Adena.uer warned
 the Bundestag in December that
 repeated German cries for unifi-
 cation were apt to weary the
 Allies,,who had other problems.
 Nevertheless, on the occasion
 of Prime Minister Eden's trip
 to Washington, the Bonn govern-
 ment was moved to ask once more
 that the German problem be kept
 at the top of diplomatic
 priorities.
 There is no doubt, either,
 but that Adenauer intends for
 Ambassador Haas, when he reaches
 Moscow, to explore the unifica-
 tion question with Soviet offi-
 cials.   Adenauer, however,
 makes a clear distinction be-
 tween exploratory conversations--
 which are acceptable under the
 terms of the Paris treaties-
 a.nd a bilateral "deal" with the
 USSR--which is not.
 Relations With Moscow
 The two men most likely
 to succeed Adenauer, if he
 should depart from the scene
 before the national elections
 in the summer of 1957, are
 Foreign Minister Heinrich von
 Brentano and Finance Minister
 Fritz Schaeffer.   Both are
 strongly pro-Western, are
 clos.1.v associated with Ade-
 na.uer's.  policies, and would
 probably head a, government very
 similar to Adenauer's. There
 is no doubt, however, that
 lacking the enormous prestige
 which Adenauer enjoys, they
 would have more difficulty
 coping with superficial offers
 from Moscow.
 Political rather than
 economic considerations are
 likely to be controlling in
 Bonn's relations with Moscow.
 The prospect of unification is
 far more compelling than that
 of commercial benefits.  There
 are, to be sure, some vociferous
 businessmen who see a: future in
 Eastern trade, and business and
 industry generally are always
 on the lookout  for profitable
 contracts wicn the East.   Most
 West German businessmen, how
 ever, do not anticipate big
 markets in the East, chiefly
 because the Orbit record on
 exports and payments is poor
 and is not expected to improve
 materially.
 The Bonn coalition dispute
 of the past two months was
 touched off when Thomas Dehler,
 chairman of the coalition Free
 Democrats, remarked that Bonn
 should negotiate on. unification
 with Moscow.   Althou;h .DelAlr
 later explained that he as-
 sumed, of,course,  the fullest

 consultation with the Western
 powers, who retain authority
 in unification matters, Adenauer
 was sufficiently disturbed to
 demand, and receive, a, renewed
 statement of the Free Democrats'
 loyalty to the Paris treaties.
 The difficulties which the Free
 Democrats are giving Adenauer
 in North Rhine-Westphalia, do
 not arise from a dispute over
 foreign policy.
 Neutrality
 While the West Germans are
 not likely to negotiate behind
 the backs of the Western powers,
 they might be willing to ac-
 cept neutrality if agreed on
 in Western councils.  The op-
 position Social Democratic
 Party (SPD) has consistently
 advocated West German with-
 drawal from NATO, and public
 opinion polls in 1955 showed a
 rising percentage,  in fact a
 plurality, in favor of with-
 drawal if unification could be
 achieved in that way.
 Nevertheless, neutrality is
 not now a burning issue in the
 Federal Republic, since even
 SPD leaders acknowledge pri-
 vately that Moscow would not
 consent to German unity on any
 terms, because of the effect
 it would have on the Satellites.
 While patriotic considera-
 tions make it impossible for
 any speaker in West Germany to-
 day to oppose unification,
 there is considerable private
 awareness of the economic bur-
 den that would be placed on
 West Germany's prosperity by
 amalgamating with the economy
 of East Germany.
 Relations With East Germany
 Though the diplomacy of
 1955 closed the door on German
 unification, it also intensi-
 fied West German interest in
 East Germany.   Bonn has three
 main policies toward East
 Germany.  First is the policy
 of   nonrecognition, on the
 grounds that the regime of the
 German Democratic Republic
 (GDR) has no foundation in
 popular consent.   Second is the
 policy of maintaining contact
 with the East German people to
 bolster morale, preserve cul-
 tural unity, and render aid.
 Third is the policy of main-
 taining interzonal trade be-
 cause it is profitable.
 If unity is impossible,
 many West Germans think rela-.
 tions with the East German
 population will have to be
 stepped up, otherwise a whole
 generation of Germans will be
 lost to the West.' Moreover,
 there is growing sentiment, not
 as yet exploited by the politi-
 cal parties, that unification
 itself might be discussed with
 East Germany,.  The All-German
 Affairs Ministry in Bonn would
 like to promote a free inter-
 zonal exchange of books, maga-
 zines, motion pictures, and
 radio programs, but the chances
 of East German co-operation
 are slim.   The exchange of
 trade union delegations and
 youth groups has not been sa.tis-
 .factory to the West Germans
 and will probably be approached
 more cautiously in the future.
 Last November the Federal.
 Republic and the GDR agreed on
 an all-German team for the 1956
 Olympics.   The American embassy
 commented that the arrangement
 appeared in microcosm to be
 just the type of rapprochement
 advocated by East German lead-
 ers.
 Bona's best hope of pre-
 serving contact, however, lies
 in the literally millions of
 unorganized interzonal travel-
 ers..   To increase the visits
 of last Germans, Bonn is con-
 sidering a plan to subsidize
 railway travel.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 February 1956
 "Technical" Contacts
 Apart from cultural con-
 tacts, employees of the East
 .and West German governments
 have for many years met to deal
 with mutual problems of inter-
 zonal trade, rail and water
 traffic, and postal service.
 They usually operate, however,
 not as governmental officials,
 but as "technicians."   A Social
 Democratic demand during the
 Geneva conference for a large-
 scale expansion of technical
 contacts was voted down by all
 other Bonn parties,  and Foreign
 .Minister Von Brentano has since
 taken the position that such
 contacts should be enlarged
 only where a need for them is
 shown.
 The minor German Party,
 the Refugee Party, and some
 elements of the SPD found Molo-
 tov's Geneva proposal of an
 all-German council attractive,
 although they would modify it
 to make quite a different in-
 strument from that intended by
 the Soviet foreign minister.
 Molotov suggested a council of
 an equal number of West and
 East Germans, appointed by their
 governments, to deal with all
 mutual affairs, including the
 preparation of unifications. The
 West Germans, however, would
 prefer an elected council with
 representation according to the
 population of the two Germa.nies
 (nearly 3 to 1 in favor of the
 West).
 Bonn's policy of diplomat-
 ic  aloofness from the East Ger-
 man government has seemed to
 be in increasing peril over
 the past ten months, particu-
 larly since Moscow granted the
 East Germans a treaty of sov-
 ereignty in September.   The rea.-
 son for this is not any popular
 pressure in West Germany to
 recognize the East German regimes
 but the political leverage which
 the latter has through its capa-
 bility of harassing West Berlin's
 lifelines. The East German
 government has already tried to
 lure Bonn into ministerial dis-
 cussions to protect first truck
 and then barge traffic from
 West Germany to Berlin.   Neither
 attempt has been successful, but
 Bonn fully expects further
 efforts.
 Meetings of East and West
 German cabinet ministers would
 not necessarily be followed by
 an exchange of ambassadors, but
 Bonn is  nevertheless anxious to
 avoid ministerial contacts or
 any action that would add to the
 political prestige of the East
 German government.   It has, in
 fact, threatened political re-
 taliation against any non-Orbit
 country which might recognize
 East Germany.
 At the same time, the Bonn
 government knows it may be in a.
 fairly desperate situation over
 Berlin access problems unless it
 gets the fullest possible sup-
 port from its Western Allies.
 For this reason, a joint West
 German, AAmerican, British, and
 French group has been set up in
 Bonn to meet regularly and con-
 sider the problems of dealing
 with East German pressure.   Bonn
 is unlikely to take any important
 action that has not been ap-
 proved by this group.
 The Bonn government recog-
 nizes, too, that resistance to
 the East German maneuvers may
 entail economic sacrifice, since
 the stoppage or curtailment of
 interzonal trade is the most ob-
 vious form of counterpressure.
 Bonn, however, will resort to
 trade curtailment only if hard
 pressed, since this counter-
 measure, used  halfheartedly last
 summer in the Berlin truck tolls
 case, was ineffective and caused
 much dissatisfaction in business
 circles.
 Despite the complexity of
 relations with East Germany and
 the desire for unification, there
 are no indications that Bonn is
 contemplating a special deal with
 Moscow, or that it will recog
 nize the East German regime.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 Felbruary 1956
 at the outset of 1955 to about
 2,150 by the end of the year
 derived from the USSR's evacua-
 tion of its military forces
 from the Port Arthur Naval Base
 in May.   Some 240 jet fighters
 and close to 100 jet light bomb-
 ers were transferred to the
 Chinese at that time.
 It is believed that the
 Chinese also received at that
 time four submarines,  a sub-
 marine tender,  and about 50
 torpedo boats, together with
 a few other miscellaneous ves-
 sels which had been based at
 Port Arthur.   Other transfers
 of Soviet equipment to the Chi-
 nese in 1955 include jet light
 bombers,  four submarines,  two
 destroyers and 1.2 subchasers.
 Large supplies of avia-
 tion fuel and equipment ar-
 rived in China throughout the
 year.   Moreover,  the first ap-
 pearance of MIG-17  (FRESCO) jet
 fighters at Chinese bases and
 the conversion of piston fighter
 units to jets during 1955 show
 that jet fighter shipments to
 China have not stopped.
 Navy
 In line with the navy's
 primary mission of coastal de-
 fense, the Chinese Communists
 seem intent on increasing the
 number of their patrol and es-
 cort vessels and submarines.
 Since 1952,  Chinese,  shipyards
 in Shanghai and Dairen have been
 turning out numbers of small,
 steel-hulled patrol craft and
 landing craft types, and,
 I I             rigate-type vessels
 may be under construction in
 Shanghai.
 Information is scant on
 the extent of Soviet aid to
 Chinese ground forces, but the
 continued modernization and re-
 organization of ground units
 clearly indicates that such aid
 has not been lacking.
 Chinese Communist ground
 forces, currently estimated at
 about 2,500,000,  remained at
 about the same level in 1955,
 but reorganization and moderni-
 zation has resulted in greater
 combat efficiency.   Widespread
 construction and improvement of
 road and rail networks in all
 areas of China is gradually
 helping to overcome the logis-
 tical shortcomings and lack of
 mobility of Chinese troops.
 Peiping during 1955 con-
 tinued to move to centralize
 authority over its troops in
 the field.   Previously sub-
 ordinate to powerful area com-
 manders, armies and divisions
 are now under increasing con-
 trol from Peiping itself,  and
 there seems less chance of any
 significant army dissidence in
 local areas.
 A conscription law,  first
 formulated in late 1954,   was
 put in full operation in 1955,
 and the military forces are
 no longer dependent on the old
 "volunteer" system.   The new
 draft program is also aimed at
 the establishment of a trained
 reserve and an eventual cut in
 the size of the standing army.
 In the fall of 1955, Peiping
 announced a new system of ranks
 for the armed forces.   Based on
 the Soviet system,  the rank pro-
 gram replaced the old concept
 of an army of coequal "revolu-
 tionary comrades."  Discipline
 and control will almost cer-
 tainly be enhanced.
 Disposition of Power
 Ground Forces:   The only
 known major changes in   the
 disposition   of           Chinese  army
 units  in  1955            involved the
 withdrawal  from  North Korea
 of four armies and other, small-
 er units totaling about 215,000
 troops.   Ground force strength
 in Korea now amounts to about
 345,000 as compared to almost
 900,000 at the peak of the war.
 One of the four armies withdrawn
 last year is now located in

 Manchuria.; the locations of
 the other three have not yet
 been determined.
 Infantry strength in the
 coastal areas between Canton
 and Shanghai, the coastal belt
 from which any assaults against
 the Nationalists would be
 mounted,rem ained substantially
 the same.   However, the movement
 of support and service units to
 this area in 1955 has greatly
 increased Communist capability
 for moves against the Na.tional-
 ists..   There are an estimated
 610,000 troops in this re ion
 and
 strength may have been
 in recent months.
 this
 augmented
 The Chinese continue to
 maintain close to 600,000 troops
 in North China. and Manchuria..
 These forces are in positions
 for a, quick return to Korea. in
 the event of a renewal of hos-
 tilities there.
 Approximately 300,000
 troops based in the vast and re-
 mote regions cxf the Southwest and
 .Lvorthwest Ci. iiia. areas are used
 chiefly for agricultural and
 construction tasks.
 There are about 190,000
 troops in units whose locations
 are not known.
 Naval Forces:   Despite the
 transfers of submarines and
 destroyers from the USSR to
 the Chinese, the strength of
 the navy remains relatively
 insignificant in terms of modern
 naval power.  Of considerable
 importance, however, is the
 fact that during 1955, Chinese
 Communist naval strength sur-
 passed that of the Nationalists.
 Their four destroyers and
 all 13 of their submarines re-
 main at the major naval bases
 at Tsingtao and Dairen or Port
 Arthur, well to the north of
 the Taiwan Strait.   The 20-odd
 frigates,  larger gunboats, and
 larger conventional landing
 craft are located in the Port
 Arthur area.,
 Tsingtao,
 Shanghai
 and Canton.
 Only small
 coastal
 vessels with
 extremely
 limited
 firepower are based at
 ports
 in the Taiwan
 Strait.
 The Chinese Communist navy's
 employment of its limited force
 has been cautious during the past
 year.  The submarines have been
 training in waters in the im-
 mediate vicinity of Tsingtao,
 and most destroyer training has
 been reported in the same area.
 Recently,  however, two of the
 destroyers have made interarea.
 voyages to Dairen and Shanghai.
 Operations north from Canton
 and south from Shanghai have
 increased gradually, but Com-
 munist ships have refrained from
 challenging the Nationalist navy,
 and there have been no exchanges
 of naval strength between northern
 and southern bases.
 With the acquisition of
 more modern ships and trained
 crews, and with continued de-
 velopment of better ports and
 base facilities in the Taiwan
 Strait area, the navy is likely
 to assume a, more aggressive role.
 It will probably take time to
 develop these capabilities, how-
 ever.   In the immediate future,
 offensive action against the Na-
 tionalist navy in the Taiwan
 Strait will probably involve
 the use of torpedo boats, which
 the Communists used with sur-
 prising success a year ago dur-
 ing action around the Ta.chen
 Islands.
 Air Force:   In possession
 of close to 1,100 jet fighters--
 about half the total strength
 of the air and naval air forces
 --Peiping has concentrated
 chiefly on developing capabili-
 ties for a. strong defense of
 the mainland.   Improved radars
 are being placed in. use at
 strategic coastal points, and
 various intercept tactics have
 been tried by fighter units.
 The Chinese, despite gradual im-
 provement, still exhibit a, lack
 of proficiency in air defense,
 however.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 February 1956
 The Chinese have about 300
 jet light bombers, which form
 the nucleus of a strong tactical
 bombardment force.   This bomber
 force is backed by about 250
 obsolescent piston light bombers
 and 10 TU-4 (BULL) B-29  type,
 long-range bombers.
 The strongest concentration
 of air units is in the area.. be-
 tween Shanghai and Canton, where
 there are now about 870 planes,
 including 655 jet fighters,. 100
 piston fighters, 65 jet light
 bombers, and 50 piston light
 bombers.   Of the 870, 605 are
 based in a quadrangle of bases,
 which includes Shanghai, Wuhu,
 Chuhsien, and Luchiao.   The
 jet bombers arrived in this
 area for the first time in April
 1955, and there was a gradual
 increase in jet fighter
 strength during the year.
 MIG's operate from Luchiao
 for combat patrols of the South-
 east China. coast as far ,south as
 Matsu. For defense of the Swatow
 area.,  the Communists depend on
 jet fighter units from Canton.
 The region between Swa.tow and
 Foochow is not currently defend-
 ed by Communist aircraft, and
 Nationalist reconnaissance
 flights in this area. are ma.ae
 regularly.   Should the Communists
 decide to occupy new airfields,
 which have been completed in the
 Taiwan Strait area.,, however,
 they will be in position to
 cover the last gap in coastal
 air defenses.
 Other significa.nt.c.oncen
 trat16ns of Communist air units
 are-in Manchuria, where there
 are some 360 jet fighters and
 about 175 jet light bombers=,
 A lesser grouping of,air units,
 including jet fighters,  is lo-
 cated  in.area's?-hear Peiping.
 Preparations Opposite Taiwan
 Having forced the Chinese
 Nationalists to evacuate their
 forces from the Tachen and
 Nanchishan Islands in February
 1955, the Communists had elimi-
 nated the last Nationalist
 strongholds from the Chekiang
 coast;  and they began emphasiz-?
 ing improvement of facilities in
 Fukien Province, directly op-
 posite Taiwan and the offshore
 islands of Matsu and Quemoy.
 The most important single
 development was the beginning
 of construction of some nine
 airfields along the coast, all
 of them suitable for jet air-
 craft operations.  Four are
 ready for use now, but none is
 occupied.   Two others in Chek-
 iang Province--Chuhsien and
 Luchiao--were completed and
 occupied by air units.
 Another major project is
 the construction of Fukien's
 first rail-line--from the
 Shanghai-Canton line to Amoy.
 Eight of the 11 known Chinese
 military railway construction
 divisions are working on the
 line, and it may be completed
 this year.   Peiping may regard
 completion of this line as es-
 sential for major military opera-
 tions in the area.   Essential
 improvements to.the.. road ..network
 were completed in 1955, and sup-
 ply problems have been eased.
 More roads are scheduled for con-
 struction in Fukien this year.
 New and better radars em-
 placed at critical points along
 the east coast were noted dur-
 ing the summer, and MIG's from
 Luchiao have recently begun
 making patrol sweeps to the
 Matsu area in defense against
 Nationalist overflights.
 There has been a continuous
 :increase in' the number of
 artillery positions, artillery
 weapons, and antiaircraft guns
 along the coast, and there has
 been considerable effort to
 build defensive strongpoints
 along the coastal beaches and
 on small offshore islands held
 by the Communists.
 There are no indications
 that attacks against the Nation-
 alist-held offshore islands are
 imminent.
