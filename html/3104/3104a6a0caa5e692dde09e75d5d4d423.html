I. .Introduction and Summary 
A. This study Was undertaken to gauge the extent of personal 
crisis, confusion, and disorientation among representative Satellite 
officials and Communist party members residing outside the Orbit 
that resulted from the Stalin denigration. Of primary, concern are 
the individual reactions of prominent party members to statements 
made by Khrushchev and Mikoyan during the 20th CPSU Congress 
in February, 1956, and to the "secret" Khrushchev report that was 
released by the U.S. State Department in June 1956. Reactions to 
the events in October and November 1956 are included. In view of 
the recent Soviet campaign against Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov, 
et al., , the study may serve as an, aid in estimating reactions to 
the continuing de-Stalinization campaign. 
B. This study is based on statements made privately by certain 
Satellite personnel while on missions abroad for their governments. 
The statements were obtained through various sensitive channels. 
For the most part, the individuals quoted are still active and trusted 
party members. Also, with few exceptions, these Satellite party 
members represent a middle echelon of party officials who are 
active in a commercial or diplomatic capacity outside the Soviet 
orbit. 
C. In order to condense the mass of material used in making 
this study, it has been necessary to report only selected parts of 
total reactions. Some quoted passages have been included to give 
a more lively picture of the depth of feeling that was produced by 
the Stalin denigration and the events that followed. These remarks 
were frequently made under private and intimate circumstances. 
D. Prevalent throughout the conversations was the expression 
of hostile opinion toward the 1956 Soviet leadership. Even after 
twelve years of indoctrination, terror, and discipline, Satellite 
party members were not afraid to express their candid opinions, 
under certain circumstances.

E. Satellite party officials confirmed the deplorable economic 
status that their leaders had created. After twelve years of power, 
these officials appeared in unanimous agreement that living condi-
tiona had not been significantly improved; the period had been charac-
terized by low wages and poor working conditions, and tremendous 
capital expansion had resulted in continuous shortage of basic con-
sumer good's. Their condemnation of party leaders was not based 
on any profound Marxian logic or -abstract analysis of the current 
crisi-s. In simple terms, usually based on their own observations 
and' experience, they concluded that their leaders had been so bent 
on building socialism that they ignored the basic needs and desires 
of the people. Each day, through their contacts in the homeland 
and their residence in the West, they could see a disparity between 
Communist theory and practice. From reading Western newspapers, 
they also were in a. position to reflect on the injustices, the propa-
ganda, and the inefficiency caused by their leaders. 
F. These officials appeared most disturbed by the embarrassing 
and unfavorable position in which they were often placed. Trade ? 
officials openly admitted that their system had forced them to be.at a 
disadvantage in conducting trade relations with the West. They 
appeared resigned to their fate as helpless victims who are required 
to carry out the orders of their superiors even when they know that 
every rule of sound economics is being Vdolated. They considered 
it ironic that they were often required to export the very items that 
were badly needed at home. (Even the merchandise that is finally 
exported is usually of such poor quality that it is hardly worthy of 
internal consumption.) They admitted that thy 'were often required 
to export products which were imported only a few months before. 
Very often, they found them,selves competing with other Satellites, 
each trying to undercut the price of the other, in order to sell their 
products in Western markets. All this caused many of them to 
wonder whether their leaders were not deliberately delivering them 
into the hands of the capitalists. In the midst of this economic chaos, 
they conceded that something was wrong. Many of them saw the 
necessity of giving more freedom to the people in order to produce

more and better goods and to break the present economic deadlock. 
G. Nevertheless, reactions offer little evidence that a large 
number of party members were abandoning the Communist ideology 
and turning to capitalism for salvation. Particularly among the 
cadre members, there was still a blind faith in the basic soundness 
of Communist ideology. Privately they still maintained that they 
must remain blood enemies of the West, even though they were 
forced to show the outward friendliness of "peaceful coexistence." 
When pressed, many of the Satellite party officials would still 
maintain that Soviet diplomacy is better than capitalist diplomacy. 
H. Several of the reactions revealed nostalgia for the past, 
in contrast with the present indecision and confusion. The party 
leadership had no ready solution to the then current crisis. Even 
such questions as whether the deceased Stalin was a genius or an ? 
idiot could not be resolved. Opinions were hopelessly divided. ? 
Some party members blamed the current Soviet leaders for having . 
allowed too much freedom too fast. Another segment blamed Stalin 
for the crisis, but at the same time believed that the leaders who 
shared hi,s power were equally at fault. Still others maintained 
that Stalin was a genius and bls,med the new.Soviet leaders for 
lacking his power and political insight. The only fundamental point 
on which there appeared to have been any widespread agreement ? 
was that the Stalin denigration was handled very crudely. 
I. The reaction of a Polish official reveals the profound 
feelings that became stirred and how Party members began to 
analyze Stalin's downfall in terms of their own experience. Stalin 
had been demoted to another "god that failed." The once great 
genius, according to this official, had now been reduced to a com-
plete idiot. For not only did Stalin corrupt himself, but he corrupted 
his followers and even the Communist ideology. In attempting to 
create a world after his own image, he distorted and rearranged 
everything according to a preconceived ideal of his own. First he 
eliminated his opposition. Then he proceeded to organize a dictator-

ship that tolerated no criticism of his policies. In the end, h.e had 
so arranged and manipulated everything that he was either feared 
or worshipped by everyone. No one dared to offend his vanity, 
question his wisdom, or offer criticism. He was protected from 
all unfavorable criticism, to the point that he became isolated in a 
world of his own. In this world he lost contact not only with the 
masses, but even with his own Party. Science was distorted to 
meet his approval, history was rewritten to make a hero, and a 
ruinous economic policy was tolerated in order to build a heavy 
industry. Only after Stalin's death was there anyone brave enough 
to label his insanity "cult of personality." 
J. Many of the comments and opinions reflected in this study 
suggest that there is still a strong current within the Communist 
movement demanding that the hypocrisy and deceit that was insti-
tutionalized under Stalin be removed, and that corrective measures 
be taken immediately. Otherwise, the party must face the danger 
of becoming completely detached from the masses. Although the 
nature of the desired changes was not always clear, the attitudes 
of Satellite personnel tended toward immediate adjustments in the 
standard of living, greater independence from the Soviets, more 
freedom inside and outside the party, and a change in political 
leadership. As one Bulgarian official warned, "Some day the 
people will ask for an accounting, and then you'll see what will 
happen. We have been torturing our people, a.nd now we have 
lost them."

II. Bulgarian Reactions  
50X1-HUM 
The following summaries and conclusions are based on a 
selection of conversations among members of a Bulgarian economic 
mission abroad. ,These conversations took place during the period 
4 April 1956 to 15 May 1957, and represent views and opinions 
expressed by middle echelon Bulgarian Communist Party members 
on the existing economic situation and events following the 20th 
CPSU Congress in Moscow. For purposes of analysis, conversa-
tions are summarized in four parts. Parts A, B, and ..0 cover the 
period prior to the uprising in Hungary. Part D summarizes the 
conversations during and after the Hungarian events. 
Part A covers the period between 4 and 21 April, during the 
time the first significant reactions to the Stalin denigration began to 
appear. Between 2 and 6 April a meeting of the Bulgarian Central 
Committee Plenum took place in Bulgaria, in which Chervenkov was 
severely criticized for "building a cult of personality." These 
criticisms were subsequently enlarged in a number of explanatory 
meetings which were held in Bulgaria between 12-13 April. The 
meetings were conducted on the district level, with leading Central 
Committee personalities participating in the discussions. Chervenkov 
was accused of committing a number of errors, among them the 
following: 1) choking criticism within the Party for the purpose of 
building a "cult of personality"; 2) promoting careerists in the Party; 
3) perverting "socialist legality"; 4) impeding friendly relations be-
tween Bulgaria and Yugoslavia; and 5) economic blundering. An 
interesting aspect of this affair was the fact that while Chervenkov 
was being called to task for errors associated with the "cult of 
personality, " hardly a word was uttered in Party meetings of Stalin's 
guilt of the same crime, as initially brought into focus by Comrades 
Mikoyan and Khrushchev at the 20th CPSU Congress in February 1956. 
The criticism of Chervenkov was not without its foreseen results, 
and on 16 April 1956 Premier Vulko Chervenkov had to "resign" from 
his government position. He was succeeded by Anton Yugov. It is 
within this framework that the conversations in Part A are summarized.

A. From 4 April to 21 April 1956 
1. The conversations clearly indicated that, for the most part, 
members of the Bulgarian mission were not very well informed on 
the political events taking place in Bulgaria. Their primary source 
of information appeared to be Western newspapers, particularly 
leftist French, Italian, and Swiss,. Yugoslav newspapers, visiting 
members of other missions, and occasional reports which were sent 
to the legation through diplomatic channels. Their first knowledge 
that changes were being considered in Bulgaria came by chance 
from a visiting Bulgarian ambassador, who passed on some infor-
mation he read in a French newspaper. This was the news that 
Chervenkov would resign and that prior to doing this, he would go 
to Moscow. This news came twelve days before Chervenkov 
actually resigned. Part of the information apparently was faulty, 
for there was no evidence to confirm that Chervenkov made the 
trip to Moscow. 
2. In reading foreign newspapers or of the delegates trans-
lated the more important articles for the group. The group would 
then make various comments, depending on the content of the article. 
In most cases, these comments seemed to adhere closely to the 
official Party explanations, but on some occasions the remarks 
would be sarcastic, ironical, humorous or even outright equivocal. 
Members seemed to express a preference for the French and Italian 
papers, feeling that they were more informative and critical than 
their own Bulgarian newspapers. They did not receive the Bul-
garian newspapers regularly, and even when they did arrive, they 
were about ten days late. It was not known whether members of the 
delegation read non-Bulgarian papers with the approval of their 
superiors in Sofia, or whether it was a practice that was tolerated 
but not officially condoned. From all indications, it seemed obvious 
that the officials were devoting a considerable amount of time to 
reading these Western newspapers and were becoming fairly well 
informed of the growing criticism of Stalin that was appearing in 
the press. For example, they were aware that Khrushchev and

Mikoyan made some unflattering remarks about Stalin at the 20th 
CPSU Congress; that Malenkov made some critical statements 
against Stalin when he returned from England; that the People's 
Republic of China commented on Stalin's errors; and that Togliatti 
made some sharp criticisms of the Soviet Union. During the early 
part of April 1956 the Bulgarian economic officials would read 
these articles without making any major comments. 
3. It was not until the 20th of April, during a weekly meeting 
of the local Party cell, that the subject of the implications of the 
20th CPSU Congress was brought up for discussion. This was the 
same day that the legation received a news bulletin which had some 
critical reference to the Stalin denigration. The conversations 
of the economic mission personnel became a little more frank 
when Stalin was mentioned in following private discussions. How-
ever, during the local Party meeting there was great reluctance 
on the part of the participants to volunteer to talk on the subject. 
Many of them excused themselves by saying that they were not 
prepared to discuss the situation. 
4. The officials were initially without any guidance as to 
what position to take on the Chervenkov affair, or on other poli-
tical affairs within their Party. When it was becoming increasingly 
evident that Chervenkov would have to be dropped, one of the 
younger members of the mission could not understand this turn 
of events. The older members of the Party seemed more resigned 
to the situation and accepted it as inevitable but ironical. The 
group as a whole viewed the Chervenkov resignation with certain 
reservations. They all agreed that he was popular in the Party, 
highly intelligent, extremely capable and "cultured." The latter 
quality apparently was something that was considered rare among 
Bulgarian Party leaders. 
5. There was, however, general agreement that Chervenkov 
was being made a scapegoat for errors committed by the Party 
itself. But what was most disturbing to the mission members

was the humiliating way in which Chervenkov resigned?in front 
of the Yugoslav delegation in the Sofia Parliament. The only sub-
stantial criticism against Chervenkov at this time seemed to be 
the fact that he considered himself an expert on everything. The 
? 
mission members thought that although he was an unusually gifted 
man, he did have certain limitations. They refused to believe at 
this time that Chervenkov was guilty of the "cult of personality." 
In their opinion, other members of the Party were just as much 
to blame, for they were the ones who had showered all their 
attention on Chervenkov. Further, they felt that on a number of 
occasions Chervenkov personally opposed the glorification. At 
most, they expected that he would be required to criticize him-
self, accept the new line, and make appropriate apologies for his 
past treatment of Tito. The fact that he was forced to go all the 
way and "resign" came as a surprise. One of the older Party 
members of the mission offered the opinion that Chervenkov, 
like Stalin, could be made or broken, and that tomorrow another 
Chervenkov would be made, and perhaps one even as genial as 
Stalin. Other members of the mission had certain reservations 
about this statement, but all seemed to agree with another state-
ment by this individual when he said, "We must criticize but 
never expose ourselves." 
50X1-HUM 
6. From the general tone of the conversation and from 
several remarks which were made, a distinct impression is left 
that the mission officials were opposed to the forced acceptance 
of Yugoslavia as a friendly neighbor. When one of the members 
read a statement in a newspaper that Bulgarians have always 
liked and "admired Yugoslays, the group broke into laughter. 
They considered equally humorous a Yugoslav account which stated 
that the Yugoslav delegation caused great enthusiasm when it 
entered the Bulgarian Parliament. Other unflattering remarks 
were made to the effect that the Yugoslays themselves indulged 
in a Tito cult and that they were a backward country in comparison 
to Bulgaria.

7. There were a number of indications that the discussion of 
political matters had intensified criticism of the deteriorating Bul-
garian economic situation. Top Party leaders were the targets of 
considerable sarcasm and joking, although no one official seemed 
to be singled out more than another. These jokes and puns were 
made openly and appeared to be greatly enjoyed. Typical jokes 
concerned the shortcomings of the Party, the economic crisis, and 
the vanity of Party leaders. For example, during a discussion in 
which it was stated that higher officials were sabotaging the econo-
mic program and then blaming it on lower officials, the following 
joke was told by one of the members: A gypsy from Turnovo, 
Bulgaria, was asked to join the Party. The gypsy, however, re-
fused the invitation with appropriate apologies by saying that he 
was too poor, and thus could not live up to the reputation of a 
IIgood" Communist. Another anecdote concerned a Communist who 
was asked what reward he wanted for his loyal years of past service 
to the Party. The Communist answered, "All I want is to be re-
turned to the good old times." The frankness of some of these jokes 
would indicate that Party members were getting bolder and were 
beginning to "open up." One of the officials told the following 
anecdote to his associates: When a high official was asked why 
there was no improvement since 1944, he replied, "The Communists 
don't know how to govern yet. All they know how to do now is 
sabotage, for they lack experience." This type of humor was in 
evidence when the mission officials discussed the problem of whose 
protrait should be hung in their offices. Now that Chervenkov had 
resigned, they wondered if anyone who replaced him would be 
permanent. One member suggested that they hang a poster of 
Dimitrov; since he was already dead they felt that it would be quite 
unlikely that any future changes in posters would have to be made. 
8. One of the more serious topics of discussion was the 
economic situation, and the inability of the Party's leaders to 
improve it. The officials were unusually outspoken on the subject 
and made no pretense of curbing their disglast. Up to this point, 
their criticism was largely restricted to blaming the top leadership

for the economic failures. All the officials seemed to be in agree-
ment that the Bulgarian economic situation was at its lowest', ebb 
since the Communists took over in Bulgaria. Among the more 
blatant shortcomings pointed out were: 1) intolerably low wages 
for industrial and agricultural workers; 2) high cost of food pro-
ducts and durable consumer goods; 3) poor quality of products; 
4) poor planning andidistribution of goods; 5) avercoacentiation--. 
on industrial expansion; 6) inept utilization of workers. These 
were only a short list of the large number of failures attributed 
to the leadership of the Party. To these officials it seemed a 
paradox that the Party had been unable to solve the economic prob-
lems after being in power for twelve years. On a number of 
occasions they openly admitted that the Bulgarian worker had been 
better off before the Communists took over. However, this indict-
ment did not seem to go into any detailed analysis or discussion 
of why the Communist economic program had failed. In typical 
Marxist fashion, the officials blamed their leaders for not having 
1) faced the problem squarely, 2) made the necessary organizational 
changes, and 3) established closer ties with the masses. From 
either their own experience, or that of some family member, they 
were able to bolster their arluments with an abundance of proof. 
This experience convinced them that the present leadership was 
in need of younger and more intelligent men who were not afraid 
to criticize and make decisions on their own. From their own 
experience they also knew that lesser officials did not dare to 
criticize their superiors openly, and that there was a general re-
luctance on the part of all officials to take too much initiative 
for fear of being blamed for something. This, they felt, posed 
a real dilemma, resulting in no one's wanting to assume respon-
sibility, in one layer of bureaucrats blaming the next until it 
reached the top and then could be pushed no further. But even at 
the top, these Party members conceded that statistics were 
falsified and deceptions were perpetrated. They knew from first-
hand accounts that peasants had not always "volunteered" to join 
collectives; that agricultural and industrial quotas were often un-
realistic; that crops often had to be sown on unproductive land.

Nor, ?to these officials, was it a revelation that they wereforced to 
make trade agreements that clearly were not in the best interests 
of the Bulgarian worker. Somehow, as if by magic, they felt that 
this could all be changed with proper leadership and the correct 
application of Marxist-Leninist theory. The fact that twelve years 
had already gone by and that their progress to the promised utopia 
had deteriorated rather than improved, seemed merely to intensify 
their convictions that something had to be done soon. For the 
present, they appeared to be at a loss to determine how the prcb-
lems could be solved. 
9. The general candor of the conversations indicated that 
certain of the officials were now, perhaps for the first time since 
they joined the Party, beginning to examine and think about some 
of the events that were difficult to explain in the past. They raised 
such questions as why their ministers had never gone outside the 
Orbit; why they never went to the West to talk; and why these 
problems had not been brought up before. One member, as if making 
an unusual revelation for the first time, stated, We, acted on in-
structions from above." Another member added, "We now start to 
understand the problem and everything is becoming clear, but then 
it appeared to us that it was normal and right." A third member 
concluded, "We were then satisfied with the general declarations 
about peaceful coexistence." Such statements suggest the possi-
bility that many Party officials were beginning to see through the 
cover of the Soviet pattern, even though there was some question 
as to how deep this type of analysis went. Sometimes their analyses 
brought some peculiar conclusions. When one official commented 
that Israel was a bourgeois country without freedom, another mem-
ber replied, "You can imagine how it was there when even in a 
democratic country like Bulgaria, Chervenkov was able to establish 
a dictatorship." 
10. Considerable discussion was also devoted to the problem 
of rehabilitating former Communists. The first information these 
officials received that Traycho Kostov and his friends would be

rehabilitated came from a visiting Bulgarian minister, who said 
that he had read the news in a French newspaper. All members 
of the delegation expressed favorable comments regarding such a 
step, but felt that the rehabilitation should not be at the expense 
of Georgi Dimitrov. One member expressed the opinion that 
"they all had been boiled in the same kettle, but those who had 
lighted the fire were still in power." Members also agreed that 
the responsibility for the original accusations should be deter-
mined and appropriate action taken. They expressed concurrence 
with a newspaper article which indicated that now that the Kostov? 
situation had been clarified, perhaps diplomatic relations could 
be resumed with the United. States. A few days after these com-
ments were made, the officials read in one of their newspapers 
that the former Security Chief, Ivan Raykov, and twenty of his 
subordinates had been arrested and accused of obtaining false con-
fessions and preparing the false trials of 1949 and 1950. This 
prompted one member to comment, "They are already looking 
for scapegoats!" 
B. From 21 April to 20 July 1956 
Part B covers the period during which the Bulgarian officials 
read the first installments of the "secret" Khrushchev speech in 
the local Western press. This account was read with great interest 
and further stimulated discussions on economic and political 
problems. 
1. It was not until 8 June that the officials received the first 
newspaper account of the secret Khrushchev speech. They appeared 
to accept its authenticity despite the fact that they were reading it 
in the bourgeois Western press. The officials were amazed at the 
scope of the revelations and were particularly impressed with the 
amount of detail in the account and its documentary nature. In 
their usual reading session, they asked one of their members to 
read all details concerning Lenin's letters of admonition against 
Stalin. It came as a considerable surprise to them that Stalin

killed so many of his associates and that he treated Lenin in such 
a "rough" manner. After all, they argued, it was Lenin who gave 
Stalin his education in Communism. Stalin, therefore, should 
have honored Lenin, rather than undermine his prestige by killing 
his followers. One of the more immediate effects of the speech 
was to provoke discussion of past and recent events in the light of 
the new discoveries. Each member appeared to have knowledge 
of some facts that he felt needed clarification, and it now seemed 
that the new revelations could help explain them. One official, 
who had previously exalted Chervenkov, wa.s now making an un-
flattering comparison between Stalin and Cherven.kov. He con-
cluded that both Stalin and Chervenkov had treated their colleagues 
in a "rough" manner by not permitting criticism of the Party leader-
ship. Another member felt that he could now understand why certain 
Soviet films presented a distorted view of Zhukov's participation in 
the Soviet victory during World War II. He pointed out that Zhukov 
was not even mentioned in such films as "Berlin Assault" and 
"Moscow Defense." This was a clear case of misleading the people. 
All the officials seemed to agree that although some of the errors 
made by Stalin may have been known, Khrushchev was right when 
he said that no one dared to criticize Stalin for fear of being killed. 
Despite the officials' avid interest in pursuing the discussion of 
the denigration of Stalin, such discussion was ruled out of order at 
one of the weekly cell meetings of the Party. The cell chairman 
claimed that it was not on the agenda of the meeting, and, ther efore, 
it could not be discussed. The agenda apparently was approved in 
advance by Sofia. 
2. The officials found it hard to accept the charge that all 
those who were liquidated in the past were enemies of the people. 
Even if they were enemies, ;they argued, there was no justification 
for killing them after they were separated from the Party and 
neutralized. Now, the officials felt, was an appropriate time to 
make the necessary corrections in the Party. The guilty should 
be separated from the innocent, and the Party history should be 
revised. But even more important, they felt, was the necessity

for the Party to tell the truth about the Party history. They felt 
that there were still many incidents which had not been revealed, 
and had they been revealed when Stalin was alive, the course of 
events might have been different. 
3. The criticism of Stalin also further intensified the group's 
discussions of the shortcomings of the Party bureaucracy. All the 
officials were in agreement that Stalinism had not only had its 
influence on Chervenkov, but it had had a proportionate effect on 
the Party, the government and on their own lives. They pointed 
out how Petko Kunin, a former member of the CPB Politburo, was 
imprisoned because he dared to criticize Chervenkov. It was also 
clearer to them now why Chervenkov had reprimanded Gochev, when 
Gochev urged the Bulgarian writers not to be afraid to criticize 
even the Central Committee. On the government side, they renewed 
their former sentiments of the Party's continual bungling in economic 
matters and its failure to correct the situation. One official went 
so far as to say that the Communist idea was all right, but its 
methods were bad. From their own knowledge and day-to-day 
experience in dealing with the West, they were now aware that 
Party propaganda had misled them in the past, both in regard to 
the decadence of the West and to the rate of economic progress in 
Bulgaria. As a consequence, they felt that they were left isolated 
in a false complacency, to the point where this isolation could no 
longer be supported. All around them they saw evidence of megalo-
mania. Even their own lives, they argued, reflected the poverty? 
of the present economic situation. While their superiors drew high 
salaries and lived a life of comparative luxury, they, as lower-
ranking officials, could not even afford the luxury of traveling with 
their wives and children. They were most critical of certain policies 
of the Party, such as concentration on heavy industry while the popu-
lation was being starved to death. They felt that the propagandists 
could hide the misery no longer, for it was a known fact that the 
people had to wait for hours in long lines even for bread. The 
continual shortcomings and falsehoods of the Party had now made 
the people apathetic. When Chervenkov submitted his resignation, 
it was passively accepted.

4. In spite of all the evidence of the economic bankruptcy 
of the Party program and the falsehoods of Party practice seen 
by these officials in their immediate surroundings, they appar-
ently were convinced that their system would eventually triumph. 
This belief was expressed even after they admitted that the Party 
had lost the confidence of the people. It seemed that their simple 
naivete forced them to believe that there were some latent truths 
and accomplishments in Marxism-Leninism, even though their own 
experience had shown very few examples. They conceded that a 
struggle was going on against them all over the world and that 
because of their unwise policies the opposition had been gaining 
strength. In the words of one official, "We always considered 
every one of our actions to be right and now we see that most of 
our actions were to our disadvantage." The officials appeared to 
be under no illusions as to the meaning of "peaceful coexistence." 
Although contacts between the two Blocs should be increased, they 
felt that Cbmmunist objectives had to be maintained. All agreed 
that the two Blocs must remain blood enemies, as Western capi-
talistic intentions could not be trusted. On a number of occasions 
the discussions indicated an inexplicable nostalgia for Soviet 
accomplishments. For example, the officials were impressed 
with the way Khrushchev handled himself when he visited and spoke 
with the British industrialists. When they read of Khrushchevis 
statements to the British regarding Soviet progress in atomic energy 
and production of new military weapons, they showed considerable 
pride in the Soviet accomplishments. When they read t14t Dulles 
stated that the danger of war with the USSR was receding, this also 
was well received. Later when they read that Gruenther was re-
signing from the leadership of NATO, they were convinced that 
NATO was no longer a serious threat to the USSR. The officials 
seemed to accept without reservation a -statement by one of their 
colleagues that Soviet diplomacy had been the best and most suc-
cessful. The only thing that puzzled them was why the Bulgarians 
allowed themselves to be isolated. 
5. The news of the Poznan demonstrations drew considerable 
reaction among the officials. When they read the first reports in 
15

Western newspapers, their first reaction was that the Polish army 
had made a mistake in opening fire on the demonstrators while the 
demonstration was peaceful. All agreed that the economic situation 
in Poland was bad. Several officials stated that they had heard of 
similar demonstrations taking place in other satellites. As more 
newspaper and radio reports came in, the officials found it hard 
to believe that such an incident could actually take place, and 
expressed doubts as to the truth of the repprts. A visitor to the? 
mission felt that the demonstration was another indication that 
the people were turning against the Party everywhere. All frankly 
admitted that the situation in Poland was most serious. They 
seemed surprised when they heard that the people had received 
arms from the police. The entire incident, in their opinion, 
proved that the Party was becoming impotent, and that it had 
lost its authority with the people. In their opinion, the Party should 
not have admitted its mistakes in Poland. At this point one of the 
mission members stated that living standards were even lower in 
Bulgaria than in Poland, and that the people were suffering more. 
But he felt that the Bulgarian people had more patience than the 
Poles, and also they were not used to better things. Of interest 
was a concluding remark by the visiting member when he stated: 
"Someday, we will be beaten by the people because of the way we 
are ruling. We have been torturing the people, and now we have 
lost them." 
C. Significant Comments  
1. Concerning the "Cult of Personality": 
"Someone has said that the Communist idea is all right, 
but the methods are bad. The people are asking questions. 
In Parliament someone asked Todor Zhivkov, 'Comrade 
Todor Zhivkov, can you tell me why you became Party 
Secretary? I can tell you. You became Party Secretary

going against the cult of personality, while you actually 
started it. Now Vulko Chervenkov is to be blamed. 
You are also guilty. Why don't you look at yourself?" 
"I say that not only Chervenkov, but even the Party, the 
administration, and our entire life was influenced by 
Stalin." 
"We are very interesting. All we do is talk. We are 
very strong in speeches." 
2. About the Yugoslays: 
"The Yugoslays are trying to take advantage of the 
present Situation. " 
"More or less we are following the Yugoslav line. They 
like to brag about themselves. This is why they never 
get anything done." 
"I would like to know if the Yugoslav Presidium of the 
Communist Party had a discussion about collective 
leadership." (They all laugh) 
3. Comments on the deteriorating economic situation: 
"We should not teach ourselves exclusively from the 
Soviet Union because until the Revolution it was a 
country that stayed behind, as if in the Middle Ages. 
What caused the 17th of June in Germany?... There 
are reasons. In East Germany the government tried 
to take away the workers' rights. This is impossible. 
Today is for today. The people want to be better off 
tomorrow than they are today. This is the whole 
nature of Socialism. If we want to go back, we should 
expect no success."

"We lost the trust of the people and we have to do

The Party has lately become shipwrecked.... This

even if they say the truth, nobody believes it.

However, we must remain their enemies, but we are

8. Remarks on the brutal purge of innocent victims!' 
"I am sure that history will prove some of these people 
innocent. I think that now is the right moment to sever 
the guilty from the innocent." 
"This should really happen, because in the history of 
the Bolshevik Party there are mistakes, and this history 
must be revised, since we now know that it was false. 
And we must teach ourselves the truth about the Party 
history." 
9. Referring to Soviet policy and its effects: 
"It is almost unbelievable how much change we have had 
during the last five years." 
"I have to admit th3? before I came here I was under the 
impression that hunger and misery were the daily bread 
of capitalist countries. I was under the impression 
that people were dying from hunger." 
"Not only you. We all had the same impression." 
10. On the failure of the Politburo to curb Stalin: 
"We wondered why the Politburo allowed Stalin to do 
these things. Why didn't it criticize or stop him. But 
of course this thing was not easy. It would be very 
dangerous."

11. And as for: the future: 
"Meetings cannot solve these questions. It is clear 
that there is no bread. They promised to increase 
salaries, but these are just words. Because we want 
to live, we cannot refuse the necessities. A family 
cannot live on a monthly salary of 500 levas. I am 
telling you that our people are very patient and had 
confidence in the Party. But some day they will ask 
us for an accounting, and then you'll see what will 
happen. We have been torturing our nice people, and 
now we have lost them." 
D. From 24 October 1956 to 15 May 1957  
Part D offers an interesting contrast of opinions, largely 
as a result of the dramatic events in Hungary in late October 
and the early part of November 1956. Throughout this period a 
noted change is evident in the intensity of criticism against Stalin 
and the present Bulgarian leaders. Although there continued to 
be widescale dissatisfaction on a number of problems, it was 
apparent that the Soviet intervention in Hungary tended to cause 
the Bulgarian officials to modify some of their earlier hasty and 
?severe judgments. 
50X1-HUM 
1. Statements made just prior to the outbreak of hostilities 
in Budapest showed awareness that the situation in Hungary was 
becoming more tense each day. In their usual morning discussion 
of political events, the Bulgarian officials blamed the Soviet 
leaders, particularly Khrushchev, for what was taking place. After 
all, they argued, it was the fault of the Soviet leaders for having 
waited for Stalin to die:before daring to speak against him. More-
over, the Soviet leaders should have been unusually careful not to 
make mistakes, since they should have known that the repercussions 
would be bad. As the Bulgarian officials discussed the problem 
further, they also blamed the Soviet leaders for having made con-

cessions to the Yugoslays, who were now taking advantage of Soviet 
difficulties. Rather than let the Yugoslays aggravate matters, the 
Soviet leaders should have taken a strong hand with them from the 
very beginning. Typical of some of the private remarks that were 
expressed on this subject were the following: 
"During the past year all they have been doing is talking against 
Stalin and his mistakes, while the country is still ruled by the 
same people who made the mistakes. They must correct 
these mistakes, for they have caused the bad economic situa-
tion. The people are looking to other persons to correct their 
mistakes. 'I 
"What Khrushchev said during the 20th CPSU Congress was 
completely different from what he said at Stalin's funeral. 
How can the people believe him?  That is exactly what the 
people want to know; when did he tell the truth. They will 
even want to know this in the future." 
"According to a newspaper account Molotov, Malenkov and 
Kaganovich are plotting against Khrushchev. Khrushchev 
has confused things rather than straightening them out. " 
2. Once the Hungarian uprising broke out in full force, the 
officials were obviously confused and at a loss to explain it. At 
first they began to re-emphasize their earlier convictions that 
serious ,inistakes were made and that the discontent of Hungarian 
workers was a prime factor. The officials felt confident that the 
Soviets would be able to handle the situation, and it was perhaps 
for this reason that they were most cautious in giving any endorse-
ment to the Nagy government. One Bulgarian official ventured 
the opinion that some day a similar revolution would take place 
in Sofia. 
3. As the Hungarian uprising continued, the officials be-
came more nervous. They eagerly read and discussed what news

was available in the Western press. The fact that the Bulgarian 
radio and press sat silently by in the first phases of the fighting 
was a source of real aggravation. The officials made a number of 
pointed remarks concerning the lack of reliability in Bulgarian 
radio and newspaper accounts. The discussions that followed often 
provoked comments on the shortcomings of the Party. Significant 
in this respect were comments such as these: 
"I don't listen toi.their /Bulgarian/ news on enterprises be-
cause I don't believe them. They dontsay anything about 
the two-day-old stale bread which people in Sofia are forced 
to eat, and about what these people think." 
"Who knows what they will write in order to lie to the people, 
and nobody can tell what is the truth. Radio Sofia and the 
Bulgarian press often report untruthful events, and after-
wards nobody puts it straight....In Bulgaria they await the 
arrival of Moscow's Pravda before publishing anything. 
Pravda arrives daily at noon, and in the afternoon they pre-
pare the papers for the next day." 
"Our Party leaders want everybody to think in the same way 
as they do. In many instances, I know that decisions 
reached by village Party committees are revised by area 
committees. There is no democracy within the Party. The 
higher organizations must approve anyone who is elected 
by a lower one. And it is a known fact that many of the 
delegates who are elected to attend Party congresses are 
manipulated from above. Some leaders maintain such close 
connections with their friends that it is difficult to remove 
them." 
"A great deal is spoken about democracy while very little 
is done. It is much better to take measures in time than 
let the situation become such as it is now in Hungary. If 
we don't do this, the people will tell us how to do it....In

Poland the situation of the workers and peasants was very 
bad. The same seems to be true in Hungary. This can 
include all countries of the peoples' democracies.... Accord-
ing to the newspapers the Russian people have passed from 
socialism to communism, but has this actually happened, 
when Soviet workers are paid so little." 
"Instead of simplifying our organization, we have overbur-
dened it and made it more complex. Everyone is apathetic, 
nobody is interested in anything.... Our leaders must 
straighten out the situation if they want to prevent a similar 
event in Bulgaria." 
4. About 30 October 1956 a decided turn took place in the 
usual morning discussions. Where in the past the economic status 
of the workers and peasants was largely blamed for the Hungarian 
uprising, now, more and more, attention was given to the official 
Party explanation that Western impetialist agents and bourgeois 
counterrevolutionaries were responsible. The Soviet intervention 
wa,s now rationalized as a necessity, and the Warsaw Pact was 
defended as a justification for the return of Soviet troops into Buda-
Pest. This change in opinions can undoubtedly be explained by the 
fear that these officials had that should the Hungarian revolution 
succeed, their fate in Bulgaria might also be in question. After 
Soviet troops re-entered Budapest, the officials began to wonder 
why Soviet troops had waited so long to put down the uprising. From 
the remarks made, there were clear indications that the officials 
were pleased that the Yugoslays gave at least a qualified support to 
the Soviet action. In discussing the ouster of Nagy, one official 
summed up his views in these words: "Never mind, it is now much 
better. So let our men know how to govern, while the others must 
lea.rn how to obey. That will be much better for the people." 
5. After Kadar had been re-established in power, the dis-
cussions again focused on the errors that would have to be corrected, 
both in Hungary and in Bulgaria. It was generally agreed that the 
24

Hungarian "demonstration" served a good purpose, even if it was 
at the cost of many lives, and had been permitted to last too long. 
The Party and the Government in both countries would have to 
improve the economic situation and correct other errors. Speaki-ng 
of Bulgarian conditions, one official made this observation: "Of 
course we can talk about all the faults committed in our TKZS's 
(cqoperatives) and about other faults, but we cannot deny all that 
we have done and start from the beginning again. We must criti-
cize our faults but we cannot deny our achievements." The official 
went on to point out that the confidence of the people in the Party 
would have to be restored. 
6. During the period of January through May 1957, the daily 
discussion of the officials was largely devoted to current inter-
national events. Those items which received most attention were 
the East-West disarmament talks, the Yugoslav-Soviet situation, 
the crisis in the Near East, and the economic difficulties in the 
Soviet Bloc. Comments on the events in Hungary practically 
ceased. Conversations now concerned those items of interest 
which, the officials thought, ?were signs that tension.s between the 
East and West were increasing. For example, such subjects as 
the testing of nuclear weapons, Soviet military capabilities, United 
States military preparations, Soviet warnings to NATO countries, 
and the need for agreements, were frequently mentioned. The 
officials entertained many fixed views and seemed greatly con-
cerned that the United States and Great Britain did not want the 
friendship of the Soviet Union. If war was to be avoided in the 
future, they felt that it was imperative that the United States and 
the Soviet Union reach agreements on disarmament and spheres 
of influence. 
7. Some discussions reflected a faiHy comprehensive interest 
in Soviet military preparations, although it was quite apparent that 
views were probably shaped by what the officials heard on the radio 
or read in the Party press. They seemed to have no doubts that 
Soviet capabilities were superior to those of the West. The Soviets,

one official prophesied, would fight the next war with flying saucers 
and rockets. Another official recounted how he had read in some 
paper that in three years. the Soviets would have an atom-powered 
bomber capable of flying at an altitude of approximately 10 miles. 
A third official went on to point out how Soviet atom te,sts were 
responsible for the earthquakes and the cold weather the past few 
years. The officials also took a lively interest in Chinese develop-
ments, taking cognizance of Communist China's growing strength 
and contacts with the West. They considered China as a power 
which already dominated the Far East, but was in need of another 
ten years of peace to build up its strength. While China was build-
ing up strength, they believed that it would give the Soviet Union 
a free hand in Europe. 
8. As the officials discussed the critical situation in the Near 
East and the unsatisfactory progress of the disarmament talks, 
Yugoslavia and Tito were invariably brought into the discussions. 
Tito was obviously the scapegoat for everything that was going 
wrong. The officials found it ironical that Tito should find himself 
in such a good position. By claiming neutrality he could sleep 
calmly while around him there was fighting. Moreover, they could 
not understand why Tito was rated as the "greatest Leninist" by 
some Communist parties. The officials placed the responsibility 
for Tito's present stature on erroneous Soviet policy during 1955 
and 1956. It was the Soviets, they argued, who first opened the 
door to Titols opportunism and revisionism. By seeking a rap-
prochement with him too quickly, Khrushchev made Stalinism a 
bigger issue than imperialism. In analyzing the situation further, 
they wondered if Stalin should not have done more than just shake 
his finger at Tito in 1948. Had not Tito changed his mind in 1948, 
they felt that things might be different today. 
9. The same kind of logic was frequently employed in other 
discussions requiring the officials to reconsider some of their 
earlier preconceived views. On a number of occasions it was not 
unusual to hear the officials wonder if they had not been too hard

on Vulko Chervenkov. Perhaps, also, they felt that they may have 
been too strong in their condemnation of Stalinism, overlooking the 
successes that he had achieved. At one point the view was expressed 
that the overemphasis on Stalinism had weakened the political front 
of the Soviet Union and the Satellites. One official remarked it 
caused the Hungarian revolution. Under Stalin, he argued, there 
was at least stability, but under Khrushchev, there is only talking 
in circles, and no one knows what is taking place. 
10. There was some optimism, however, over the proposed 
industrial changes that Khru.shchev was sponsoring in the Soviet 
Union. These changes were considered as a "real revolution, " and 
it was hoped that the changes would succeed in cutting costs and 
reducing bureaucracy. The Bulgarian officials looked favorably 
toward a return of competition between enterprises and an improve-
ment in both local and foreign trade enterprises. It was obvious 
from the remarks that were made that the officials had an exaggerated 
notion of the extent of the proposed changes. They understood 
Khrushchevls proposals to mean a complete decentralization of Soviet 
industry and a return of "self-management" to factories. They also 
thought that factory councils would be created to manage the enter-
prises, but these councils would not be like those in Yugoslavia. 
11. When the Bulgarian officials heard the first announce-
ments over their radios that Mao Tse-tung had made a speech in 
which he raised the problem of contradictions between the Party 
leaders and the people, they considered the speech very interesting 
and logical. Discussion of the speech prompted a number of com-
ments on criticism and self-criticism and the responsibility for 
errors. It was generally agreed among them that people on lower 
working levels were more likely to make mistakes than the leaders 
because on.lower levels Party workers often did not have a com-
plete grasp of the entire situation. In continuing to discuss the 
question, they reached the conclusion that there was no point in 
castigating their leaders too much, for even they had their positive 
sides. This question also elicited some interesting comments and

unflattering observations concerning the efficiency of the Bul-
garian Parliament. The officials agreed that the Bulgarian 
Parliament was most efficient when it came to making decisions, 
but they were not so sure it was a body truly representative of the 
people. One official wondered why proposals were always accepted 
unanimously, and why the peoples' representatives never said, 
"My opinion is such and such. In the end, the thought that the 
peoples' representative actually represented the people, or a group, 
was considered as quite humorous. The question was pursued 
no further. 
12. Throughout the period under discussion, economic diffi-
culties in Bulgaria cOntinued to be a subject of the greatest impor-
tance. It was obvious that this was a problem that not only con-
cerned the officials in their daily activity, but was also a problem. 
that had no immediate prospects of solution. As an indication of 
the seriousness of only one aspect of economic life, one visiting 
Bulgarian agricultural expert commented on the deplorable status 
of meat production. He stated that in the period between 1939 and 
1957, there had been no increase in meat production in Bulgaria, 
despite the fact that the demand for meat was becoming greater 
each year. With the shift of population to the cities, people in 
the countryside were being forced to st-pply higher quotas, thus re-
ducing their own consumption of meat. The expert maintained that 
unless the bad policies of the agricultural program were corrected, 
the economic situation would deteriorate completely. As one step 
towards improvement, he recommended that some incentives, 
such as the return to the peasants of state forage land, be initiated 
at once. The agricultural official went on to point out that many of 
the state farms were operating at a heavy loss, largely due to un-
economical practice.s and the apathy of state farm workers. In 
other sectors of the economy, similar conditions were: noted, In 
the foreign trade sector, for example, Sofia policies were blamed 
for the sale of products to Western countries at a loss in order to 
get dollar credits to pay off high-interest-rate loan.s to other 
satellite countries. Officials found it equally hard to explain why

Bulgaria was undertaking expensive construction projects in Syria 
at a financial loss, at a time when much-needed construction was 
being neglected at home. 
Conclusions 
1. Evidence of disillusionment with the present Communist 
system in Bagaria is found scattered throughout the conversations. 
Not only are the mission officials seriously concerned with the 
deteriorating economic conditions, but they are also alarmed at the 
inability of the Party leaders to bring about the necessary changes. 
The record of the Party after twelve years of dictatorship reveals 
a complete bankruptcy in achieving the goals that it promised the 
people. Wages are tragically low; consumer goods are in extremely 
short supply; prices on even basic commodities are out of balance; 
unemployment is increasing; yet, they say, the Party officials 
continue to cover their blunders under a cloak of propaganda. 
2. The comments of these officials seem to plead for an end 
to this farce, and ask that the past errors of the Party, both in-its 
actions and in its recording of these actions, be corrected. The 
Bulgarian Communist Party, they feel, is in real danger of per-
manently isolating itself from the masses, unless the necessary 
changes can be initiated promptly. The pressures for change go 
beyond mere economic improvements. There is need for more 
"democracy" in the Party, they believe, a younger and more 
aggressive leadership, less subservience to the CPSU and more 
contact with the West, a slowing down of capital expansion and a 
vindication of past injustices. This is only a partial list of the 
changes that seem to be desired. 
3. The full extent and depth of the disillusionment cannot 
be accurately measured on the basis of the comments of these 
officials alone. Living in the West has forced them to change many 
of their preconceived ideas derived from what their Party leaders 
wanted them to believe. They seem impressed with the material

wealth:of the West and the frankness of its press. This, however, 
has, not appeared to affect their profound respect for the Communist 
ideology itself. They expressed amazingly few views negating their 
basic conviction in the superiority of the Communist ideal. If their 
system has failed to date, they seem to argue, the cause of failure 
has been the incompetence of the Party leadership. To the Wes-tern 
mind, such a conviction reflects an unbelievable naivete. They 
readily admit that there has been much talk and little action, yet 
none of these Bulgarian officials has a clear, perspective as to how 
the needed changes can be brought about without altering the Com-
munist ideology at the same time. The dilemma that has been 
posed seems rather simple. On the one hand they appear to admire 
Soviet diplomacy, and on the other, they cannot understand how 
Bulgaria has allowed herself to be isolated from the West. Some-
how, as if by the application of some magic formula, they expect 
the right combination of leadership to bridge these two extremes. 
There appears to be more than one Communist conscience which 
is disturbed by the deceptive Party propaganda and the poverty 
of the Bulgarian people. 
4. The denigration of Stalin undoubtedly put a "thawing" 
process into action. Now, perhaps for the first time, Party officials 
have begun to reexamine the past record of the Party. In so doing, 
many Party members have become convinced that the Party has 
lied to them, just as the CPSU has lied to them about their idol 
Stalin. Each day they see examples of deception which cannot be 
reconciled with reason and experience. This inevitably results 
in further questioning, doubting, and disillusionment, In time, 
it may lead to individual moral crisis of the Party member and a 
complete rejection of the Communist "faith. " There is little doubt, 
based on fairly reliable indications, that these officials, once 
expcsed to the unsettling self-examination of the post-Plenum days, 
have continued to view new Party developments critically, even when 
such skepticism must be more carefully concealed, due to the 
current "hardiip,"and Party censorship.

III. Polish Reactions 
The following summaries and conclusions are drawn from 
selected remarks among a group of Polish officials residing in 
the West. The summaries are divided into three parts. Part 
A covers a period of two weeks prior to the 28 June 1956 Poznan 
riots. Part B contains reactions shortly after the Poznan riots. 
Part C covers the period from late July 1956 to June 1957. 
A. Prior to 28 June 1956. 
1. Members of the Polish group made extremely critical 
remarks concerning political and economic developments in 
Poland. Coming under particular attack were the grave effects 
of the Soviet leadership, its involvement in the Stalin denigration, 
and the implications of these developments on current Polish 
affairs. The Polish officials deplored the sagging economic 
situation at home and the inability of the Party leaders to bring 
about any improvement. It was readily admitted that after twelve 
years of dictatorship by the Party, the people were still obliged 
to live at a scandalously low economic level. Even when it was 
conceded that the Communists took over the Polish government 
at a very difficult period, no one could now deny that the Com-
munists had made mistakes. All the officials were in agreement 
that these mistakes could not all be attributed to the effects of 
the hostile policies being followed by the West, but were essentially 
the result of internal Party mismanagement. In their opinion, all 
the monumental construction projects, the copying of everything 
Soviet and the blind acceptance of Party leadership without criticism 
were tragic mistakes. The officials appeared in complete agree-
ment that the economic situation was becoming so bad that the 
human conscience could no longer be required to justify what had 
taken place in the past, even though the Party is still required to 
follow and accept the experience of the CPSU. One official com-
mented that even taking into consideration the inevitable difficulties 
of the period of "transition to Communism", it is still necessary to

change the inefficient economic system and correct the terrible 
errors of the past. The economic difficulties cannot be blamed 
on capitalist pressures; they are entirely the fault of the Com-
munists, with their vast and unnecessary construction projects. 
2. The officials made several outspoken comments on 
Stalin. There appeared to be unanimous agreement among them 
that it was now no longer possible to hide Stalin's past mistakes. 
There was no doubt in their minds that the effects of the Stalin 
dictatorship were destructive and that in its course many innocent 
victims were put to death. One official referred to Stalin as a 
savage dictator who had gone wild with power. In only a few 
months he succeeded in destroying some of the best cadres of 
the party. Now, they said, all the horrible things are seen, but 
the cause is not evident. Stalin was an idiot who had the power 
of a dictator. 
3. In analyzing Stalin's many faults, the officials con-
cluded that he must have had a very distorted picture of life in 
general. They said Stalin had theories about everything, which 
coincided only with his own concept of his ideal world. Unfortu-
nately, once Stalin achieved power, he did not know how to apply 
his theories practically. Because he isolated himself and dared 
to trust no one, he had no grasp of reality. Everyone took 
advantage of his vanity and prejudices, including Beria, who kept 
everyone from him. Stalin came to be feared; even his closest 
associates dared tell him only what he would like to believe. In 
due time public opinion was nullified and Party criticism was 
suppressed. All these developments, they felt, kept Stalin in 
ignorance of the true situation inside and outside the Party. 
4. One of the most damaging effects of Stalin's megalomania 
was the corrupting influence of his methods on leading officials in 
the Party and the government, and even on the militants of the 
rank and file. One of the officials commented that although they 
knew conditions were very difficult they thought everything would

change in the future, and it was for that that they lived. They 
accepted and believed everything as if it were Holy Scripture. 
But, they said, it will not be accepted as Holy Scripture in the 
future, and they felt that to be a good thing. 
5. It was clear to these officials that not only the Soviets, 
but all Communists were responsible for Stalin's deceit and 
treachery. By flattering Stalin at every opportunity, all Party 
leaders were in a sense contributing to his many faults. In the 
end, the Polish officials wondered whether it was really Stalin 
who was made a fool, or the Party members themselves. In 
looking back over what had taken place, they found it incredible 
that not one person in the whole CPSU had enough courage to tell 
Stalin the truth when he was alive. 
50X1 -HUM 
6. In the light of the new revelations on Stalin, the Polish 
officials now felt that many questions had been clarified. How-
ever, they expressed doubt that any immediate changes would 
take place within the Party. Although they felt that there were 
some courageous men in the Party, it was their opinion that the 
majority of the delegates who attended the 20th CPSU Congress 
were still Stalinists. One of the officials was disgusted that not 
one delegate at the Congre-ss dared to offer a single protest 
during the proceedings. Commenting on the demoralization that 
had set in, one official remarked that in glaring contradiction to 
all Communist principles, Party members had become completely 
indifferent to human suffering. While repeating again and again 
that the capitalist system depresses the workers, the Communists, 
according to this official, have in fact been treating their workers 
even worse, under the excuse that it is necessary under the 
conditions. This change of attitude, the officials noted, was in 
stark contrast to the dedicated faithfulness of Communists who 
had joined the movement at its inception. As a result of years of 
indoctrination, the formerly dedicated Communists now meekly 
submitted to the injustices being committed without offering any 
strenuous protests. The Communist "madness" had now progressed 
so far that it could not even be explained away by the Party leaders.

7. Undoubtedly, much of the political and moral dis-
illusionment could be attributed to economic factors. As one 
official pointed out, the workers had made no progress during 
the Party's reign, and despite all the promises and exhortations, 
each year they became more enslaved. The economic trend 
that was taking place was testimony that Communism was 
defeating itself in Poland and was proving that capitalism was 
a better system. From their own experience and from what 
they had learned from relatives at home, they could not under-
stand how a worker could live on 500 zlotys a month under the 
existing price levels. From the comments made, there could 
be little doubt that the low economic status of the Polish worker 
was an irrefutable argument proving the bankruptcy of the 
Polish Communist utopia. The officials remarked that they 
should be ashamed to call themselves Communists when the 
average worker earns only 500 zlotys per month, when after 
twelve years of "dictatorship of the proletariat" the Polish 
people are still so badly off. They wondered why the workers 
should be expected to want the class struggle to continue, and 
how they could have any hope for the future when year after 
year they earn only as much as a slave. The low standard of 
living, they said, is actually destroying Communism. 
8. On the political side, the Polish officials commented 
extensively on the deteriorating situation within the Polish 
United Workers' Party (PZPR). It was their opinion that 
unless some form of national movement took place soon, the 
Party would be in danger of a serious crisis. They felt certain 
that the leadership of the Party would have to change. As they 
viewed the internal Party situation, Ochab, who was then leader 
of the Party, would have to be replaced by someone capable of 
handling the growing disillusionment. One of the officials felt 
strongly that only with the return of Gomulka, "an honest man", 
could any significant changes be expected in the Party leader-
ship. The prospects of Gomulka's return, however, were at 
that time not considered too likely. There Were certain

reservations among the officials as to whether Gomulka would 
be completely acceptable to the Polish people and whether he 
could occupy his former post without first confessing his 
former errors. But regardless of his prospects, they were 
convinced that the Party was in urgent need of a new orienta-
tion. All agreed that a Party congress should be held at the 
earliest opportunity and that a complete exposure should be 
made of past mistakes and injustices. 
9. One of the most interesting aspects of these political 
reactions was the criticism leveled at Soviet foreign policy. 
It was frankly admitted that the Soviet had isolated themselves 
through their own stupidity. While this isolation could possibly 
be justified in Lenin's time, the officials felt that there was 
little justification for it during Stalin's period, or during the 
current period. Even Khrushchev was severely criticized for 
his conduct of Soviet policy. There was considerable depth 
of feeling on this issue. One official said that Stalin's stupidity 
could not be pardoned, but that the Communists who permitted 
him to get away with it were idiots too. Khrushchev also was 
criticized for having the nerve to say that Stalin had made all 
these mistakes, while making similar mistakes himself. 
10. It was also evident, on the basis of other remarks, 
that the Polish officials strongly resented Soviet interference 
in Polish affairs. In commenting on Soviet omnipotence in 
determining Polish affairs, one official stated that although 
?the need for collaboration with the CPSU and the utility of 
their experience could easily be understood, the CPSU 
certainly had no right to forbid criticism when one saw that

one outspoken critic, it was one of the most serious blows in 
the entire history of the PZPR. The initial reaction was to-
discount the press reports as being either exaggerations or 
provocations, for it seemed incredible that a historically 
peaceful city like Poznan should suddenly erupt. All of the 
officials found it hard to accept the failure of the Polish 
security forces to detect the preparations in advance and to 
move in immediately before the disturbances started. They 
viewed the situation as an example of "incompetence and 
anarchy" within the Party. 
2. It was readily admitted that one of the most harmful 
results of the demonstration was the bad political atmosphere 
created both within Poland and in the West. The timing of 
the incident was considered most unfortunate, since it came 
at a time when the Polish economic situation was at its worst. 
But what the officials seemed to fear most was the adverse 
affect on their relations with the local emigre groups and on 
their other propaganda activity. Since many Western observers 
were present at the Poznan Fair and witnessed the demonstra-
tions, it would not be possible to deny what had taken place. 
Since the West was already well informed of the reasons for 
the demonstrations, any official explanation would make them 
look like "imbeciles". Some officials felt that because of the 
unfavorable publicity that would follow, a number of scheduled 
events would have to be cancelled until the atmosphere improved 
again. For example, much discussion took place as to whether 
a Communist front congress, to which many exile Poles had 
been invited, should be cancelled because of possible repercus-
sions from the "reactionary Polish emigration". Concern was 
also expressed as to how the Poznan affair could be best explained 
to Western diplomats. 
3. Some of the individual reactions to the Poznan situation 
deserve examination. It is interesting to note how reactions to 
this new situation differed from the previous criticism of the

Party leadership. Where the Polish officials had previously 
expressed many reservations about the accuracy of Party 
reporting and the internal corruption of the Party, their first 
reaction now was to accept all Polish newspaper and radio 
accounts of the demonstration as being the truth. They 
appeared convinced that the demonstration was instigated by 
the "imperialists" and supported by certain decadent elements 
outside Poznan. 
4. One of the more immediate concerns was the security 
of the installations, since it was feared that hostile emigres 
would try to break in. A number of steps were taken to 
increase security, including admonitions to all personnel to 
increase their vigilance. 
5. After the Poznan crisis passed, the officials accepted 
a more sober view of the incident. In discussing the riots 
among themselves it was stated on a number of occasions that 
had it not been for "reasons", it would not have occurred. 
Again it was emphasized that the economic situation was the 
cause for the present misery, since it had caused the workers 
to oppose the Party. This was not merely because the Party 
was in a period of transition and only on the threshold of better 
times, but was the result of obvious shortcomings in Party 
leadership. Pointing out the errors in the economic sphere, 
the officials noted that the constant experiments of the Party 
were bringing ruin to the country. Not only was the distribution 
system poor, with extreme shortages even of such a basic item 
as bread, but also the whole price system was insufferable. On 
the farms the situation was even worse than in the factories, 
and there was no question but that the people were generally 
better off economically under the Fascist occupation. One 
official repeated the anecdote in which Hilary Minc, Poland's 
economic boss, arrived in a village and told the people that 
they were making money and all living at ease under the Com-
munist leadership. To this the people applauded and shouted,

"Long live Minc and his family on 500 zlotys per month!" In 
summing up their views, it was agreed that Poznan should 
serve as an alarm system to the Polish Communist Party 
that something had to be done. 
6. When-the Polish officials read Western newspaper 
accounts about the "secret" Khrushchev report, they 
reiterated their previous opinions that the Russians were to 
blame for what was happening. After all, they were the ones 
who were "foolish" for having pretended friendliness and 
stifled criticism. And because they were foolish, the people 
could now no longer be held on a leash. The whole world now 
knew what had taken place in the USSR, for there could no 
longer be any secrets. But despite this frank condemnation 
of the CPSU, and the half-hearted approval of the consequences, 
it was generally agreed that Khrushchev had made a serious 
error in making the report. In effect Khrushchev had made a 
fool of himself. What would be the value of telling the world 
that Stalin had engaged in chicaneries and murdered many of 
his associates, the officials argued. Who would benefit from 
these revelations -- certainly not the Satellites. In analyzing 
all the implications, the officials became greatly disturbed 
over the present lack of secrecy in the Party and the fact that 
Western newspapers were exposing everything. This was bad 
publicity, and it was most unfortunate that the secret Khrushchev 
port had to come out when it did. It had caused confusion on 
all levels in the Party, and the knowledge of the masses about 
Stalin's "nastiness" and crimes could not help the present 
s ituation. 
7. What seemed particularly distressing to them was the 
disorientation of the Party leaders. This disorientation was not 
restricted to Polish leaders alone, for even the French, Italian 
and Belgian leaders had had to go to Moscow to get explanations 
as to why the Khrushchev Report had not been publicized before.

Since it was now published, they wanted to know if it was the 
truth. And because it was first published by the bourgeois 
press, it opened the doors for a tremendous amount of 
criticism, with most of it directed against the Party leadership. 
8. In Poland, the officials admitted, there already was 
considerable seething against Khrushchev, who reportedly 
moved about like a bull in a china shop, while Malenkov 
merely sat around and waited. But even the present Polish 
leaders seemed hopeless failures. Minc and Mazur, the 
officials pointed out, were sick old men. Berman, when he 
retired, supposedly stated, "Good, I will retire, but you 
are responsible the same as I," There was also considerable 
resentment of the meddling of Soviet officials in Polish affairs. 
For example, during one of Khrushchev's recent visits to 
Poland, the question of Zambrowski's position arose. The 
Party in general was reported to be opposed to him, but was 
required to capitulate when Khrushchev insisted that he be 
retained. Nor were Polish officials pleased with Khrushchev's 
conduct during his visits. References were made to his 
undignified attitude and his heavy drinking. 
9. This disillusionment with the Party leadership left 
many Party members completely uncertain of the future. 
More than one Polish official admitted that no one seemed to 
know what could or should be done. In the final analysis, it 
was conceded that the solution would turn on what Moscow 
wanted, and not what the Poles wanted. The political situation 
was characterized as "incredibly stormy and a gigantic tragedy 
divorced from words." One official went so far as to say if he 
were not a Communist, he would not have faith. "How could 
one have confidence," he asked a friend, "under these cir-
cumstances?"

C. Polish Reactions: 15 July 1956 to April 1957. 
From the general comments and private conversations 
reported during this period, it is clear that the return of 
Gomulka as head of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) 
on 12 October 1956 did not bring to an end, or even appreciably 
reduce, the growing disillusionment among Polish officials. 
Although there were some signs of optimism, particularly in 
public statements-, the over-all political and economic situation 
was still privately viewed with pessimism. Significant in this 
respect were the following comments and remarks, indicating 
that despite their deep attachment to the Communist ideology 
and their strong feeling of anti-Stalinism, many of the Polish 
officials were still dissatisfied with political developments 
both inside and outside of Poland. 
I. In late July 1956 a slight shift was again becoming 
apparent in the Polish officials' evaluation of the Poznan riots. 
Now it was becoming more common to hear two different views, 
one official and the other private. Officially, it was argued 
that it was Western agents who precipitated the riots. Privately, 
however, Soviet economic policies and the errors of Polish 
leaders were held to blame. Polish officials began to have 
increased fear that if new strikes took place or unemployment 
increased, more serious economic difficulties could be expected. 
The Polish economic situation was considered so alarming that 
an official made the statement that if the public were informed 
about the economy and the Party's policy, it would "tear the 
Party to pieces". 
2. One official in particular seemed dissatisfied with 
everything he saw. He complained privately that the personnel 
he supervised were dirty and lazy, satellite representatives 
were of disreputable character and, in fact, the whole environ-
ment suggested apathy and complete indifference. After a short 
trip to Poland he came back even more dissatisfied, complaining

that the Party was not active enough, the lot of the workers 
was becoming worse, and general poverty could be seen 
everywhere. His main criticism was directed at agricultural 
conditions in Poland and the Soviet domination of all aspects 
of Polish life. At one point he remarked: "What is the root 
of all of our difficulties in Poland? We take agricultural 
products from the peasants by either purchase or requisition. 
We take their products for nothing and give them nothing in 
exchange. This is the basis of our economic problems. " 
3. Towards August and September 1956, the views 
of the Polish official described above became still more 
cynical. He remarked that the self-satisfaction of the Polish 
Central Committee was a tragedy. Members of the Party, 
he noted, were becoming contemptuous and scornful of the 
rest of the population. To a close associate he confided that 
Party members were acting like "colonizers" in Poland, and 
he recalled the declaration once made by Lenin: "When men 
can no longer live as in the past and when the State can no 
longer govern as in the past, then the masses begin to stir 
and become active." Only with the return of a popular figure, 
such as Gomulka, could the situation be changed. 
4. After the Gomulka coup had succeeded, a wave of 
optimism could be noted in the conversations, The general 
trend of conversation was patriotic and anti-Soviet. Where 
one official had been most pessimistic in the past, he now 
remarked that "Polandts fondest hopes had been realized". 
He went on to point out that although he was satisfied with the 
new developments in Poland, he did not see how Poland could 
continue to defy the Soviets. It was his opinion that Gomulka 
did not want to break with the Soviets. Moreover, a break 
with Russia was not advisable. As he phrased it, it was not 
a question of wanting to be dominated by the Soviets, but a 
question of Socialism:

"It is not a question of breaking the alliance with the 
Soviet Union. We do not want to break the alliance 
with the Soviet Union.... But an alliance with the 
Soviet Union is one thing and dependence on the Soviet 
Union is another." 
5. Khrushchev's visit to Poland on 19 October 1956 pro-
voked a number of uncomplimentary remarks. The situation 
was "touch and go", and there was much uncertainty as to 
whether the Soviets would openly intervene with their armed 
forces in Polish affairs. A strong feeling prevailed among 
the Polish officials against any Soviet delegations coming to 
Poland. One official spoke vehemently of the "idiocy of Moscow" 
and described Khrushchev as the "biggest idiot on earth". 
He went on to label  Pravda as a "dirty rag", and recalled how 
Khrushchev addressed a delegation of PZPR Central Committee-
men as "Polish Zionists", 
6. The political triumph of Gomulka was largely credited 
to Ochab, who, ?according to one Polish official, tipped the 
balance for Gomulka at the right moment. It was his opinion 
that the whole country was behind Gomulka, including the Polish 
security organizations. He correctly predicted that Rokossowski, 
the Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the Army, would have to be 
replaced because of the strong feeling that prevailed against him. 
7. With the advent of the Soviet intervention in Hungary, 
a notable change could be detected concerning Polish unity with 
the Soviets. An indication of this growing disillusionment is 
apparent from the selected comments of a Polish official during 
the period 9 November to 1 January 1957: 
9-November: (referring to the Soviet intervention in Hungary) 
"The Soviet menace is hanging over Poland but so far 
we have avoided it nicely. Soviet influence in Poland 
is diminishing. "

8. In January, and in the following months, much of the 
same opinion was expressed. The only exception was a New 
Year's speech which was made before an official gathering, 
at which time the Polish situation was described in fairly 
optimistic terms. The changes in Poland were characterized 
as a "fight for a new, freer and a more just way of life". The 
speaker declared that the PZPR had managed to govern under 
difficult times, and once again Polish patriotism' had saved 
the country. One week later, however, in discussing the 
Polish situation with a friend, the same official described the 
situation as disintegrating and bemoaned the poor salaries, 
the living conditions and morale of Polish workers. Two 
weeks later he was able to find considerable fault with 
Gomulkals leadership. He accused Gomulka of being a weak 
leader and incapable of making decisions. Gomulka, he added, 
was not an experienced politician and everything he was doing 
was in opposition to the Party's program. Fortunately for 
the Party, it had some old leaders who were well qualified 
and?able to give Gomulka some support. The Polish official 
was also concerned with members of the Sejm (Polish parlia-
ment) who he felt were acting as demagogues, making promises 
to everyone. If the members of the Sejm continued in this vein, 
he predicted that the Sejm would make itself the center of 
struggle against popular democracy. Not only the country, 
but the Party was in chaos. Gomulka, the official added, was 
contributing by falsifying statistics to make the situation 
appear better than it actually was. 
9. In the early part of 1957 there were indications that 
anti-Semitism in Poland was becoming worse than ever before. 
The situation, in the opinion of one official, was becoming 
scandalous. He thought that Polish leaders were publicly 
inviting anti-Semitism, with the purpose of stifling democra-
tization in the country. He felt that anti-Semitism was not 
actually a real problem, as the number of Jews in Poland was 
practically insignificant. The persecution of the German 
minority, in his opinion, was a far greater problem.

Conclusions 
1. The candor and bitterness reflected in the reactions 
can leave little doubt that many Polish officials were extremely 
critical of the political-economic situation in Poland even before 
the June 1956 Poznan Riots. This bitterness increased notably 
with the release of the "secret" Khrushchev Report and with the 
demonstrations at Poznan. The over-all effect was to focus 
sharper attention on the record of the PZPR leadership over the 
past twelve years. In the opinion of these Polish officials, it is 
a shameful record of economic failure. The balance sheet adds 
up to practically zero and living conditions are worse after all 
these years of Communist rule today than they were under German 
occupation. 
2. Even some ardent and loyal Communist Party members 
have not accepted the results passively. There is evidence of 
extreme disillusionment in their statements, very similar in tone 
and substance to that of the Bulgarian officials. The similarity 
is striking, even to the point of the individual criticisms of the 
leadership and the causes of the economic difficulties. Both 
reactions seem to suggest that many Party members are aware 
that to date the Party program has not been favorably received 
by the workers. With the passing of each day, they see more 
examples of this steadily deteriorating situation, to the point 
where the Party has made the worker its direct nemy. In the 
eyes of these officials, the blame rests squarely with the Party 
leadership, because its stupidity brought about the crisis. Now 
this leadership seems incapable of finding a solution other than 
re-applying the old Marxist-Leninist formulas which have been 
used ineffectively in the past. 
3. The discussions offer no clear insight into the signifi-
cance or depth of this undercurrent of.disillusionment. On the 
surface these appear to be the voices of individuals who are 
confused and disturbed. None of the conversations seem unusually

analytic or critically_ introspective as to what should be done 
to put the Party back on the right track again. In most cases 
the criticism, is destructive rather than constructive, and the 
main theme seems to be the need for change. Judging from 
the discussions, this change should involve some form of 
political concessions and economic recovery. Unprofitable 
enterprises should be abandoned, wages should be raised, 
prices lowered; in short, the standard of living needs immediate 
adjustment. Other changes also seem to be indicated, particularly 
greater internal Party democracy, greater independence from 
the Soviets, correction of past injustices and a younger and more 
competent leadership. These changes, if accepted, would 
supposedly bring about an economic and political relaxation and 
a certain amount of independence from the USSR, both desperately 
needed at this time to bring the Party closer to the masses. 
4. These discussions leave the impression that Party 
members are finding it increasingly difficult to justify Party 
practice with their own consciences. Conscience often forces 
them to rebel against the errors of the Party, the existing 
poverty, the false hypocrisy of Party propaganda and the bru-
tality of the system. But faith forces them to accept all these 
shortcomings in the name of ideology. Thus, there appears to 
be a struggle between ideology and practice, between ends and 
means, To many, it seems inconceivable that after twelve years 
of dictatorship the Party has nothing to show for itself but workers 
who hate the very system that was forced upon them to give them 
economic freedom. They apply the official stock answers -- the 
failure to achieve ends can be attributed to poor leadership. 
Khrushchev is a "clumsy elephant", Rakosi is a "bandit", 
Zawadski is an "incompetent"; nevertheless, their basic con-
viction that the Communist utopia can be attained, if given proper 
leadership, remains unshaken. Nor is their own sense of self-
righteous indignation altered. ,It seems ironical that while they 
deplore the deceptions and machinations of their superiors, they 
themselves, in their day-to-day activity, are often found fanatically 
devoted to perpetuating the system's errors.
