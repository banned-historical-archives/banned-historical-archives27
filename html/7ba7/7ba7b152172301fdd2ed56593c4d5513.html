Dunn expressed his conviction that the US would be gravely mistaken in supporting a solution for Erttrea and Tripolitania that excluded Italy.

GREECE: Reductionur:mcie -US Ambassador Grady, commenting on General Van Fleet's recent recommen- dation that Greek armed forces be maintained at their present strength through fiscal year 1950, stresses the importance of effecting a substantial reduction of Greek Army strength in advancing Greek economic rehabilitation and declares that responsible Greek leaders are becoming increasingly insis- tent on such a shift in emphasis from the military problem to reconstruction. Grady feels that there is every present in- dication that the army's summer campaign will eliminate organized guerrilla operations In the interior of Greece, thus permitting reduction of the Greek iforces to begin. Grady adds, however, that the US should attempt to maintain its present military aid appropriations and should not consider a reduction of the army's strength before next fall. (CIA Comment: CIA believes that, although guerrilla activity in the heart of Greece will probably be virtually elim- inated by autumn, the concentration of the main guerrilla strength in areas along the Albanian frontier will require all available Greek Army strength.)

Views on Soviet policy in Far East and Euro --US Embassy CU /3 goscow,15 commentliiIon reports that the Soviet representa- camp tives in China, Siam, and India have departed for Moscow, expresses the view that the Kremlin may embark on a period QIP/3 of more intense activity in south and east Asia. The Embassy anticipates a continuance of Soviet demands for an early Japanese peace treaty, propaganda efforts to exploit US-British differences in the Middle and Far East, and direct action to take advantage of existing tensions in Southeast Asia. In this connection, the Embassy warns that, despite Chinese Communist efforts to obtain trade concessions from the West, the Chinese Communists are unlikely to be "weaned away" from Communist orthodoxy at this time. The Embassy points out that the USSR will make a strong attempt to aid Communist China in the event that the Communists do not obtain aid from the West and that only after this Soviet attempt has failed will there be any hope that the Chinese Communists will consider following a path independent of the Kremlin. Meanwhile, Embassy Moscow anticipates no relaxation In tension in Europe but believes that the next phase of the East-West struggle will center increasingly on the economic field. According to the Embassy, the Kremlin will seek every means to obtain restoration of East-West trade and to exploit any economic conflict between the western powers.

Murphy comments that the key question is whether the railway administration will be permitted to cooperate and adds that a brief period may be necessary before the Soviet Military Administration "graciously" assents to such cocperation. Murphy points out that the Soviet attitude cannot be ascer- tained until the morning of 28 yune when the crews will try to put the intra-city rail system back into operation. NEAR EAST-AFRICA 2.

According to the Consulate-General, Riley feels that the Israeli interpretation., which was confirmed to � iley by Foreign Minister Sharett� would be "completely inacceptable" to Syria and that there is thus little chance for the successful completion of an armistice. The US delegation to the UN in New York, meanwhile; reports that Blanche is taking a "stiff line" against the Israeli attempt to modify his pro:. ,sal and is insisting that his proposal be accepted by both parties as it stands.

Et my even result in a move toward authoritarian government. There appears to be in Parliament no potential successor to Sophcglis. possessing the required ability to command a.pproval and restrain political fa.ctionalism. Populist chief Tsaldaris, Foreign Mb.ister under Sophoulis and himself an ex-Premier, has been given the first opportunity to form a new cabinet. With 37% of the seats An Pa.rlis.ment, the Populists may find it easier than any other group to muster enough minor-party support to carry Parlia- .ment. Continued Liberal-Populist cooperation of the kind achieved by Sophoulis s unlike:49 llowever, because leading elements in both parties will welcome an occasion for a test of party strength. Furthermore, a slate headed by Tsaldaris will probably encounter considerable hfngh-level friction, tams - much as he las, at least until very recently, been cut of favor with the King and has also irritated Army Commender in Chief Pa.pages. F12 as seems quite possible, Tsaldaris fails in the initial attempt to form a new cabinet, the second chance may fall to the 74-year-o1d Diomedes, Liberal Vice Premier under Sophoulls, or to some similar figure without strong political coloring. Diomedes is a higtly respected financier who might be abae temporarily to preserve the old coalition cabinet, but his task would soon become much more difficult because of his relative inexperience in politics and his lack of a stabiliz- ing force comparable to Sophoulis'. One or two minor poli- ticians may also be invited to try their luck at forming a cabinet, but with diminished chances of success.

Such a development, although likely to remove the friction between political and military leaders which has been detrimental to the effectiveness of the Greek Army, would have sharp political repercussions in Greece and would expose the US to further Soviet charges of lending support to non-democratic governments. - Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 RET GENERA L A us 11.. :tan Arrryir piaatell gErg.'

The French official urges that at the time of Senate ratification, a strong declaration be made that US strategy contemplates the defense of Western Europe on the Rhine, not at the Pyrenees. The parliamentary leader explains that the French consider it of paramount importance to locate the headquarters of central military planning under the Pact in Washington rather than In London, in order to overcome traditional differences in policy between the UK and tlre continental powers.

Analysis of Soviet attitude at CFM meeting--US Embassy C 111/3 Moscow, in commenting on the line taketchy the USSR at the Paris meeting of the Council of Fore' Ministers, ex- presses the view that some basic change may IF vve taken place in the Soviet attitude not long before the meeting. Pointing to Vishinsky's "defensive attitude and apparent improvisation," as well as his failure to build up a con- sistent pro,E4 ganda pattern, the Embassy suggests as pos- sible explanation the impact upon the USSR of the May elnctions in Soviet Zone Germany, combined with recent ;catkins in the Satellites I), difficulties and weaknesses. The Embassy reasons that because of these evidences of weakness, the Kremlin found it inadvisable to permit any real progress toward a German settlement and will pro- bably place obstacles in the way of further progress on the Austrian treaty unless the USSR is successful in tightening its control in the Satellites and the Soviet oc- cupation zones. The Embassy explains that although any "last minute shift" in Soviet tactics can be accounted for by this analysis, the willingness of the USSR to mark time at present probably is based more fundamentally on the Kremlin estimate that a crisis of capitalism is approaching much faster than previously anticipated.

French r i est US statement on MAP-- French Foreign c s given -sere .ry of State Acheson an aide me metre expressing the concern of the French Govern- ment in connection with the submission sel the Atlantic Pact to the French Assembly. The aide memoire declares that the Assembly debate would open wider more favorable cir- cumstances if the US had already clarified the "milikt ry and strategic consequences" which France may expect from the Pact. The Government fears that iu the absence of such clarification the Assembly may attach reservations which would greatly limit the scope of the Pact. The French Foreign Office has advised US Embassy Paris that Schuman would be greatly aided in his effort to get the widest possible support of the Pact if the Military Aid Program were introduced into Congress before the French Assembly begins its debate. The Foreign Office emphasizes that Schuman hopes to obtain US permissiaa to make use publicly of assurances previously obtained Washington that: (a) US strategy contemplates the defense of Wester Europe; and (b) the US intends to establish, with- in the organization envisaged by the Pact, a combined stiff representing the US, Canada, the U1K, and France.

Soviet motives as indicated bynyishins s ech--Secretary of State Achesonii�Triris comments that Vis ky's state- ment in the 24 May session of the Council of Foreign Minis- ters seems to reveal the fundamental Soviet purpose to re- capture a voice in NVestern Germany, particularly in economic matters. The Secretary believes this interpretation to be supported by Vishinsky s emphasis on the standard Soviet position regarding the Ruin*, his comparative neglect of poli- tical questions, and his failure to include anything calculated to attract any support in Germany. The Secretary adds that his reply to Vishinsky, insisting on the maintenance of the progress already made in Western Germany, was fully sup- ported by the British and French Foreign Ministers, so that a unified western position is clearly on record. The Secretary believes that Vtshinsky's proposal that the CFM deal with the Japanese peace treaty reveals a Soviet desire to: (a) obtain participation for the Chinese Communist government, thus involving western recognition; or (b) embarrass the western powers by forcing them to refuse recognition. The US delegation in Paris expresses its "first impression" that the US should hold to its policy that the CFM is a highly undesirable forum for consideration of the Japanese peace treaty. THE C.

Israelis make known their territor.iaLdewa--US repre- sentative Ethridge in Lausanne has been told by Israeli delegate Eytan that Israel will not only present to the Pales- tine Conciliation Commission a demand that it retain all territory now under its control (with possible minor rec- tifications), but will also demand additional territory in north-central Palestine now occupied by Jordan. Eytan also told Ethridge that Israel will do nothing more about the Arab refugees now. Ethridge comments that: (a) the Lausanne Conference is likely to break up when the Arabs know Lsraers position; (b) neither side seems ready for peace; (c) there seems little likelihood that Israel's demands will be modified; and (d) unless Israel modifies its demands, there is no possibility of peace on any basis heretofore en- visioned by the US.

Continued Soviet restrictions on Berlin�VS Representative rerdreSTFOTENETEW"--"0�"fforts, re ewing the present status of Soviet restrictions on transport, trade, and com- munications between Berlin and the western zones, that "Berlin remains today In a state of semi-blockade." Accord- ing to Riddleberger, the USSR may be having "second thoughts" on lifting the blockade because the Soviet action has failed to: (a) retard progress toward the establishment of a west German government; (b) produce a "crack" in over-all western trade policy vis-a-vis the Soviet bloc; or (c) release a flow of west- ern zone goods essential to the Soviet Zone and to the continua- tion of the Soviet reparations policy. It eileberger therefore raises the possibility that the USSR may have intended to lift the blockade only enough to oermit reconvening the CFM while simultaneously rew.integ a favorable barmining position in the event that no over-ail settlement on Germany is reached and it later becomes necessary to negotiate some provisional arrangement for Berlin. Riddleeerger believer, in view of continued Soviet restrictions on Berlin trade, that the Depert- ment of Slate should decide whether Soviet implementation of the ressup-Malik agreement has been sufficieet to warrant the convening of the CFM. (CIA Comment: CIA agrees that the 'USSR may be attempting to preserve the most favorable position possible In the event of a breakdown of the CFM negotiations. CIA further believes that the USSR will attempt at Paris to exploit certain remainizg transport restrictions in be.rgatning on the over-all problem of German trade and Its relation to western export policy. CIA believes, however, that e Kremlin's strong desire to hold the CFM meeting would impel the USSR to modify Its restrictions on Berlin trade if confronted by a western refusal to convene the CFM under present conditions.)

The delegates believe that western conditions for the unification of Germany should be presented after the Soviet proposals have been dissected, thereby avoiding any appear- ance of presenting the USSR with an ultimatum at the opening of the-meeting. 3. .S� jimitsen_t_of the German question--US Embassy Moscow coders that the Soviet press treatment of the Ger- man question indicates the Kremlin not only had hoped that � convening the CFM would effectively delay development of the west German government but had even believed that the mere announcement of four-power agreement would accomplish this purpose. The Embassy further notes that the emphasis of the Soviet press on economic unification suggests that the Kremlin is primarily interested in the removal of the counter- blockade, interference with Germany's growing contribution to the European recovery program, and breaching the western restrictive trade policy.

The Foreign Office estimates that Soviet control over the electoral machinery is adequate to have secured a 90% vote. The Foreign Office believes that the USSR may have hoped to: (a) create optimism among the western foreign ministers concerning the possibility of an agreement with the USSR; (b) make the Germans believe the western powers are being needlessly cautious and are delaying Germany unity for their own advantage; and (c) enable Soviet propaganda to assert that the elections were free. (CIA Comment: CIA doubts that the Soviet Zone elections were "rigged" in the manner suggested but agrees with the Foreign Office interpretation of the way in which the USSR may attempt to exploit the results.) 5. GREECE: Government fears big er deal on Greek issue-- The Greek Foreign Ministry has ormed US Embassy Athens of its concern about recent Soviet advances to US and British representatives regarding the Greek issue and of its desire that every effort be made to keep the Greek question out of the CFM. The Greek Cabinet reportedly feels strongly that: (a) the Greek-Communist dispute must be kept before the UN where Greece is represented; and (b) the Greek issue should be left alone until the rapidly improving military power of the Greeks puts them in a position to settle the disputes with their northern neighbors on the most favorable terms. The Department of State has advised Embassy Athens that the US is not negotiating on Greek matters without Greek participation and that Greece has not been mentioned as a subject for consideration in the CFM. The Department expresses the hope that the matter will not come before the CFM and indi- cates that in any case the US will not engage in substantive talks without Greek participation. - 3 - Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 ET e4eye GENERAL 9 MAY 1949 992 1.

Jessup indicates it was agreed that: (a) unification of Germany is desirable under the proper conditions; (b) a united Germany should be free to associate itself with the West; (c) there should be no delay in implementing the west German government; (d) a boundary commission to study Germany's easter i frontier is desirable; and (e) Austria should be dis- cussed sometime during the CFM meeting. According to Jessup, the French specify as conditions for the unification of Germany the extension. of the Bonn Constitution and free German elections. The French representative believes that if the CFM does not achieve concrete results, there may be a recurrence of inter- national tension; he therefore considers it may be necessary to come to a limited solutio involving some degree of co- ordination between the east and west German systems and a temporary arrangement for Berlin. Jessup made it clear that the US does not favor the withdrawal of US forces from Germany or any disposition of those forces which would weaken US in- fluence in Europe. Jessup indicated that the US intends to insist that the USSR relinquish ownership of property in the Eastern Zone before there can be any unification of Germany. Sits FAR EAST 2.

The. British Charge estimates that at the C FM meeting the USSR will present vague and unaccep,Kble proposals which can be exploited by Soviet propaganda, thereby seeking to delay the integration of western Germany into the political and eco- nomic system of the West and to weaken the resolution of the western peoples to carry out the North Atlantic Treaty. US Embassy Moscow reiterates its view, however, that a major Soviet tactical shift may develop at the CFM meeting and declares that in any evert the western delegations must be prepared or such an eventuality. (CIA Comment: CIA agrees with the estimate of US Embassy :Moscow concerning the possibility of a Soviet tacti- cal shift.) 2. Reaction of Sovlpublic to lifting of blockade--US Embassy Moscow observes that the reaction of the Soviet public to the lifting of the Berlin blockade is decidedly restrained and not at all comparable to the popular reaction to the Smith-Molotov exchange of a year ago or the Stalin-Kingsbury Smith corre- spondence of last February. The Embassy believes that this reaction is chiefly caused by: (a) the paucity of information available to the Soviet public on the Berlin blockade and a consequent ignorance of the seriousness of the situation; and (b) the lack of attention given the recent agreement by Soviet propaganda, combined with a continuation of anti-US propagan and the recent jamming of US and British broadcasts. - 1 - Jocanent No. 63 0 d/Pe- S eIA- e�hF NO CHANGE in Class., 11 DECT_A(75:72-1,.71.1.,` 0 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 TO RET FAR EAST 3.

Possible Soviet tactics at forthcomin CFM meeting�US Embassy Moscow, in commenting on possible Soviet tactics at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Foreign Minis- ters, expresses the belief that a drastic and dramatic shift in Soviet strategy may well develop even though no specific indications have been noted. The Embassy points out that the Kremlin must be strongly attracted at present by the potentialities of an accommodation which would prevent the USSR from being completely excluded from western Germany while awaiting the development of the expected crisis in the capitalist world. In view of this, the Embassy believes that although the Kremlin will probably attempt at first to achieve the aims outlined in the Warsaw Declaration of 1948, the USSR quite possibly may be prepared to accept nearly the same terms recently agreed upon by the western allies.

The Embassy believes that such a Soviet approach would "clearly shake western foreign policies to the very bottom," by confusing western public opinion at a crucial period of western consolidation and by creating practical problems of the first magnitude and of incredible complexity, particularly in connection with current restrictions on East- West trade and with Germany's relation to the political and economic rehabilitation of Western Europe.

(CIA Comment: .CIA. does not believe that the USSR contemplates a military invasion of Iran at this time. The USSR, however, may plan to stir up trouble not only among the Kurds in Iran but also among those in northern 'rag and Syria. The Kremlin may also plan to use members of the former autonomous government of Iranian Azerbaijan to create disturbances.

ProstestsJEAustrian treat i talks�The Department of State has informed US representative Reber at the Austrian treaty talks that it does not desire to discuss the problem of Austria at any forthcoming CFM meeting until substantial agreement is reached on German issues. The Department does not wish to link the Austrian ea.ty to a possible dead- lock on Germany, thus prejudicing future Austrian talks, and understands that the British and French concur in this ap- proach. The Department desires that discussions of the Austrian treaty be continued in order to clarify secondary issues and to ascertain Soviet intentions, that a recess be obtained shortly before a CFM meeting, and that negotiations be resumed simultaneously with the CFM meeting. Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber has expressed the hope to US Minister Erhardt in Vienna that, if no agreement is reached on Austria either at a CFM meeting or during the London talks, the western powers will make a sweeping pro- posal advocating that occupation of Austria be terminated within six months or a year and that, in the meantime, occupa- tion controls be relaxed and the Austrian army be built up. Erhardt agrees substantially with Gruber, despite the fact that Gruber's proposal would take western forces out of Austria while the USSR retained German assets in Austria and the frontier issue remained unsettled.

Clubb transmits his firm belief that such an opportunity to insert an opening wedge between Communist China and the USSR should be promptly and fully exploited. Shanghai near economic colla se--US Consul General Cabot in Shang i reports that Shangh.ai faces catastrophic conditions. According to Cabot, public confidence in the Nationalist currency has practically vanished, employers are unable to meet their payrolls, and foreign businessmen fear that conditions will become so bad that the people of Shanghai will welcome the arrival of the Communists. Cabot considers it essential that the US continue the present ECA program for Shanghai because its curtailment at this time would lead to such serious food and supply shortages that economic collapse would be complete. Cabot believes, however, that ECA stocks in Shanghai should be kept at prudently low levels. 2 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 30 APR1949 co TO 976 44), GENERAL 1.

Its:_sLip:Malik tailts--The Department of State, in commenting on the Jessup-Malik talks, has informed US missions in the field that Soviet Representative Malik has raised the question of the formation of a west German governme t but has not made a specific condition of the point. US Representative Jessup has indicated in reply that preparations would continue on the government but has pointed out that the question of establishing the government does not arise in making plans for a CFM meeting in the near future. (The Department ex- plains that there is ample time for a CFM meeting before the west German government could actually be established.) The Department has further advised its missions that, although the 26 April TASS release apparently accepts the US position, there are indications that the USSR may attempt to interpret jessup s statement as a firm commitment that a west German government would not be established either prior to, or during, a meeting of the CFM. rhe Department considers that this . Issue must be definitely clarified in further talks between Malik and Jessup. US Embassy Moecow, in commenting on the TASS release, expresses the .view that the reference to the Kings- bury Smith-Stalin exchange does not actually remove the speci- fic condition that removal of the blockade is dependent upon postponement of a west German government as well as convoca- tion of a CFM meeting. The Embassy believes, however, that the Kremlin might drop this conditiat in view of the potential effect of an ostensibly serious peace offer combined with a lifting of the blockade and a meeting of the CFM. (CUL Comment: CIA believes that, although the USSR may attempt to make the postponement of a west German gov- ernment a specific condition for lifting the blockade, the Krem- lin may estimate that the effect on the Germans of removal of the blockade will alone halt or postpone the establishment of a west German state.) 1 Document No. 693 sas C/A-s NO CHANGE in Class.; E] DECLASSIF.T.ED Class.

The Department asserts that US objectives in the current review of unagreed articles should be to obtain the maximum possible agreement and to test Soviet intentions in regard to the ultimate conclusion of a treaty. 3. British views concerning MAP legislation--US Embassy London expresses the vfew, concerning irniaritiessional legislation on the Military Aid Program (MAP), that there would be a strong adverse reaction in the UK if MAP were financed through eats in ECA. The Embassy considers that despite British confidence in the US and the current assumption that US-UK unity is funda- mental to British foreign and defei. se policy, a linking of MAP with ECA or the attaching of onerous or unilateral conditions to MAP would bring a strong 1: ritish reaction. The Embassy believes that failure by Congress to pass MAP legislation would create grave doubts in the UK concerning US reliability In international ffa irs and would cause serious British con- cern over the psychological effect on the French.

GERMANY: Socialist Views on draft constitution-- According to Acting US Political Adviser Riddleberger in Berlin, the German Socialist Party (SPD) expects to continue the Bonn discussions on the basis of new proposals for the West German draft constitution. Riddleberger states that (SPD) moderate leaders as well as the SPD delegation at Bonn now expect ultimate agreement at Bonn on a text acceptable to the occupying powers, but that the SPD extremists who opposed the original draft still consider such an outcome unlikely.

Stuart Is then to return to Washington for consultation. Meanwhile, Stuart reports that Acting President Li and remaining top officials have fled Nanking and that all Nationalist troops deployed for defense of the Yangtze river have been ordered to withdraw south of Hangchow. According to Stuart, the ridiculously easy Communist crossing of the Yangtze was made possible byNation- alist defections at key points, disagreements in the Nationalist high command and the failure of the air force to provide effective support.

US assurances to Arab states ug--The US Consulate General in Jerusalem suggests that, in order to restore peace in Palestine and long-term stability in the Middle East, the US should give assurances to the Arab states that the US is prepared to make strongest representations to Israel against the threat or use of force both during and after the 26 April peace negotiations at Lausanne. The Consulate believes that such assurances are necessary in order to restore Arab confidence and to free the Arabs from fear of the kind of military pressure they experienced during the recent armistice negotiations. The Consulate adds that postponement until September of the Israeli ap- plication for UN membership would demonstrate to Israel that it cannot continue to ignore world opinion with impunity. - TS 2.

Riddleberger believes that the resolution must be considered in the light of the SPD contention that it is the political party which stands most clearly for German ideas and rights.

British anticipate accelerated Soviet peace offensive�US sassy on on i. � nsm s Le ew a r ::oreign Office official that current vague "feelers" and rumors concerning the lifting of the Berlin blockade by the USSR should be regarded as preparation for an all-out Soviet "peace offensive." The British official reasons that be-. cause the Kremlin must realize that the blockade has boomeranged against the USSR and has actually strengthened anti-Communist sentiment both in Germany and among the western powers, a change of tactics is essential if the USSR is to regain the initiative. The official considers that a Soviet peace move is imminent and may be launched on May Day. He believes that such a peace gesture would con- sist of a proposal for: (a) the lifting of the blockade and counter-blockade; and (b) Four Power discussions of Ger- man questions, including the establishment of a single Ger- man government. Although the Foreign Office official be- lieves that the Britivh public would not be taken in by such a peace move, he fears it would strike a responsive chord in France, Italy, and elsewhere in Western Europe. (CIA Comment: CIA agrees that the USSR is 111raly in the near future to make proposals for an East-West settle- ment involving the lifting of the Berlin blockade. Although it appears that a change of Soviet tactics is essential if the USSR is to regain the initiative, there is no specific evidence that Soviet strategy has changed sufficiently to permit the proposal of terms acceptable to the western powers.)

CHINA: Li finds Communist terms not acceptable--Acting 5- 5 President Li has informed the US, British, French, and Australian Ambassadors in Nanking of the Communist peace terms, which amount to unconditional surrender. According to Li, the Communists demanded that reply be made to these terms by 20 April, but he has answered that the difficulties of reaching the various members of the Nationalist Government will require more time, though not beyond 23 April. Li told the Ambassadors that he felt cer- tain the terms would not be acceptable to his Government and that he is now convinced no peaceful settlement can be reached with the Communists. Following Li's request for advice from the Ambassadors, the British Ambassador expressed the sentiment of the group that nothing could be done to aid the Chinese in settling what is essentially a Chinese problem.

Cumming believes it to be very doubtful that the Swedish Air Force either could or would be ordered to leave Sweden in the event of Soviet attack and that the Commanding General's statement would be repudiated by the Swedish Government if it became known. Cumming interprets the real purpose of the Swedish statement to be: (a) to invite current assistance to the Swed- ish Air Force and the standardization of equipment along RAF and USAF lines; and (b) to initiate backdoor staff con- versations with the US and the UK. (CIA Comment: CIA believes that the Swedish Air Force would not evacuate unless all further resistance was useless or unless the tactical situation required air opera- tions from Norwegian or Danish bases in coordinated defense of Swedish territory.) 2.

The Deprtment has therefore authorized the Embassy to inform the Italian Foreign Office, if the ritish Ambassador concurs, that the US is mindful of Italy's special relations with Yugoslavia and would not object to Italian-Yugoslav discussions concerning an ex- change of provisional commercial air rights on a limited basis.

The Department expresses its serious doubts that Spain will be able to make repayment. The Department instructs the Embassy to make clear to the Spanish authorities that a general demonstration of Spain's capacity and willingness to make more effective use of its re- sources is prerequisite to obtaining financial aid from the US.

ITALY: Vatican view of Italian colonies uestion--The Acting U epresen ve at fie atican transmits the view of the Vatican Under Secretary of State that if a decision is made on the former Italian colonies which could be con- strued as unfavorable to Italy, the Italian Communists and the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement will make a special effort to demonstrate that the US and the UK have no real interest in Italy's rehabilitation. The Vatican Under Secre- tary believes that this move would seriously weaken the De Gasperi Government and might even cause it to fall, with serious consequences. The Vatican Under Secretary also believes that the chief Communist aim is to reenter the Gov- ernment and that the Communists can easily become a real danger if they are successful in undermining Italian confi- dence in De Gasperi. He suggests, for these reasons, that it would be desirable to postpone a final decision on the colonies for at least 8 or 9 months. (CIA Comment: CIA believes that a decision on the colonies which could be construed as unfavorable to Italy might be followed by a Cabinet reshuffle, including the resignation of the Foreign Minister. CIA does not believe that such a decision would cause major changes in the coali- tion or in its stability.) FAR EAST 2.

Rhee agreed that it was psychologically desirable that he publicly announce this conclusion shortly and in so doing Indicate that he was therefore suggesting a review of the timing of US troop withdrawal. Mucci� believes that Korean acceptance of the US withdrawal would be given impetus if he were enabled to make an early report to Rhee on the specific assistance to the Korean security forces the US expects to give. (CIA Comment: CIA believes that Rhee's continued acquiescence to the US troop withdrawals will depend on his receiving firm assurances that the US will provide the equip- ment to maintain and expand Korean security forces. CIA believes, however, that there will be an adverse psychological reaction when the fact of impending US withdrawal becomes generally known in Korea despite any announcement that Korean forces are now competent to defend the country.) -2 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 50 Ls' 12 APR 1949 ET 9 6 0 GENERAL 1.

After point- in.g out that all Italians regard Asmara and Massawa in Eritrea as Italian cities, Dunn adds that Italians cannot be expected to put faith in Ethiopia's ability to administer this area when Ethiopia is unable to administer its own territory. Meanwhile, Prime Minister De Gasperi has described to Ambassador Dunn the difficulty encountered by the Italian people in reconciling the reluctance of the US to support Italian trusteeships of the former colonies with the decision of the US to include Italy in the Atlantic Pact and the European recovery program.

Israeli Foreign Minister given US views on Palestine-- cretar sorme Israeli Foreign Minister Shared that President Truman holds the following views regarding the Palestine situation: (a) Israel must be pre- pared to offer territorial concessions in exchange for any increase over the 29 November territorial allocation it wishes to retain; (b) the concept of internationalization for Jerusalem still should be supported, although local Arab and Israeli government might be arranged under trustee- ships recognizing international interest in the Holy Places; and (3) Israel should attempt immediate repatriation of perhaps one-fourth of the eligible Arab refugees. The Secretary pointed out that Israeli action on the refugee question would not only constitute a real contribution to a political settlement but would also "make it possible" for the President to continue his "strong and warm support of Israel." After Sharett had reiterated the Israeli position that the refugee problem can be solved only in a final settle- ment, the Secretary suggested that Israel at least indicate Its willingness to accept a certain number of refugees and take further action as peace negotiations progress. US Ambassador McDonald in Tel Aviv has been instructed to communicate the results of this interview to Prime Minister Ben Girton and also to express the serious concern of the US over reports of an Israeli incursion into Syrian territory.

CHINA: Communist ''ultimatum" .111.1221,ung-len--US Am- bassador Stuart has been informed by Acting President Li Tsung-jen's principal adviser that on 5 April Li received, through a non-Communist emissary from Peiping, a message which Li interprets as an ultimatum from the Communists. Stuart was advised that the message requests a high-rank- ing Nationalist official (either Li or Premier Ho Ying-chin) to proceed at once to Peiping to serve as vice chairman of the Army Reorganization Committee, of which Communist leader Mao Tse-tung will be chairman. The message re- portedly indicates that formal conversations in the Army Reorganization Committee are to be held from 9-12 April and that Nationalist failure to send a representative or to reach agreement by the specified date will impel the Com- munist forces to cross the Yangtze River promptly. (CIA Comment: CIA believes that this message is a Communist device to apply increased pressure on Li's Government in the current negotiations and is not a genuine Communist ultimatum. Although the Communists are capable of carrying out their threat of crossing the Yangtze, they probably do not want to force a breakdown of negotiations at this time.) 2 ao RET Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 e/A- 5 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 1;\ 50 TOP GENERAL it 6 APR 1949 955 I.

According to the Embassy, the Kremlin's objective in these activities would be to drain Tito's strength to such an extent that the western powers would not consider it feasible to give Tito enough assistance to continue resisting. (CIA Comment: Although the USSR will probably use every subversive device likely to increase opportunities for the overthrow of the Tito regime, CIA doubts that these tactics will include large-scale guerrilla warfare or that Tito will permit a war of attrition to develop against him without taking vigorous countermeasures.)

KOREA: Plans for US troop withdrawals--The Department of State has advised US representative Muccio in Seoul of its concern lest preparations now under way for evacuation of US occupation forces will result in premature publicity on withdrawal plans before either the Republic of Korea or the UN Commission on Korea has formally approved the move. The Department is anxious to avoid giving the impression that the US troop withdrawals from Korea are either contrary to the wishes of the Republic or in response to Korean pres- sure. Mucci� has been asked to estimate whether formal establishment of a Military Advisory Group for Korea at this time would minimize the adverse effects of the eventual with- drawal announcement. -2 c) �(;;;,,\ TO EetlET Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 5 APR 1949 954 GENERAL 1. Western Union request for military aid--The Department of State has transmitted o U Ambassiaiii Douglas in London the terms of the request by the Western Union powers for US military aid and the US reply. The Western Union requests US material and financial assistance in a common defense program based on the principles of self-help, reciprocal aid, and common action in defense in accordance with the Atlantic Pact. In reply, the US has informed the Western Union that the President is prepared to recommend to Congress that the US provide military aid under the principles of the Atlantic Pact, with the understanding that the allocations of material and financial assistance shall be agreed upon between the Western Union powers and the US. The Department has also informed Douglas f " t discussions are now being held with Danish, Norwegian, and Italian representatives concerning the requests of those countries for US aid and the terms of the US reply. 02pki.

According to Riddle - bergers the unsatisfactory political sitmation in the western zones arises principally from the disunity of the western powers concerning Germany and is evidenced by mounting confusion, doubt, and disillusionment, particularly in connec- tion with the slow formation of the west German government. Riddleberger points out that the strong desire for trade be- tween west and east Germany, combined with a desire for political unity, produces a growing west German tendency to favor rapprochement with Communist-run east Germany. Riddleberger observes that west German responsiveness to Soviet peace and unity propaganda is much greater than it would have been some months ago. (CIA Comment: CIA considers that the lack of agree- ment among the western occupying powers is the chief deter- rent to progress on a west German state and that such disunity encourages German expectations of western concessions on the issue of centralization. Concerning the tendency to favor rapprochement with east Germany, CIA believes that even though west German conservative commercial circles desire eastern markets, the desire of west Germans as a whole for political unification on Soviet terms is weak. CIA does not believe that west Germans are very receptive to Soviet propa- ganda for "peace and unity.

According to the informant, Lie is depressed by what he regards as the decline in UN in- fluence and by progress toward the Atlantic Pact. The inform- ant believes that Lie's decision was not a firm one, but re- flected "a mood of the moment." (CIA Comment: CIA believes that although Lie is seriously concerned over the decline in UN prestige, he will probably not offer hi.5 resignation at this time,) o. :113 N3 03JECX/or i)if.:CLI.,,Ts.SITICATION OF Document Document No. 601 TO CHANGE in Class.

Polish withdrawal of Spanish case from UN agenda --US Embassy Warsaw believes that the recent Polish attempt to withdraw the Spanish item from the General Assembly agenda is a Soviet-directed lactic. The Embassy considers that the Polish motives are to: (a) narrow the field of dis- cussion in the General Assembly, thereby permitting con- centration of propaganda attacks against the Atlantic Pact; and (b) preserve the present situation between Spain and the Atlantic Pact signatories. The Embassy further points out that if the western powers seize the initiative in the Spanish case, the USSR can claim that their motive is to pave the way for Spain's adherence to the Atlantic Pact and that such preparations reveal the aggressive and anti-UN character of the Pact.

PALESTINE: UN efforts seen blocked by Israeli attitude-- US Representative Ethridge concludes, in a review of the work of the UN Palestine Conciliation Commission to date, that Israeli cooperation with the Commission is unlikely unless the UN and its member states are willing to back the Commission as an agency for facilitating a settlement of all outstanding issues. Ethridge considers that the Israelis have no respect for either the Commission or the Arab states and are apparently convinced that Israel can progress only by military means. Ethridge comments that in view of Israeli intransigence the Commission has had as much success with the Arabs as might be expected. .C. T TO 1E D: ' THIS DO. 60.

BURMA: Shift to extreme leftist government likely--According to US Embassy Rangoon, the Burmese Government party (the Anti-Fascist Peoples' Freedom League) has publicly indicated Its willingness to yield power to a "leftist" group. The Embassy believes that the insurgent Peoples' Volunteer Organization (PVO) will now either enter a coalition with the Government party or replace the present Government. (CIA Comment: CIA believes that the formation of a government strongly influenced or dominated by the PVO is quite likely. Such a government would be far more leftist than the present regime and would probably take a strong anti-US line.) 2 TOP S 4 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749332 e/i9 eonF.
