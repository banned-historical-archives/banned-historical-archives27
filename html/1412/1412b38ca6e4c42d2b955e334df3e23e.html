 LEBANON       ?~.
 Developments in Lebanon this week
 were heavily influenced by an agreement
 worked out in Damascus on April 16 by
 Syrian President Asad and Palestinian
 leader Yasir Arafat. The agreement was
 aimed in part at patching over differences
 between the Syrians and Lebanese leftists
 led by  Kama[ Jumblatt after Syrian
 regular forces moved into Lebanon earlier
 this month.
 Asad agreed to a request by Jumblatt,
 through Arafat, for the revival of thejoint
 Syrian- Palestinian- Lebanese truce com-
 mittee to police the new cease-fire that
 went into effect on April 20. Asad rebuff-
 ed Jumblatt's demand that Syria
 withdraw its forces and gained Arafat's
 public support for a continuation of
 Syrian mediation. Both Asad and Arafat
 rejected publicly other Arab or inter-
 national participation in future settlement
 talks.
 Asad may have given certain private
 assurances to Arafat to mollify Jumblatt
 and win leftist support. In any event,
 Jumblatt has no choice but to acquiesce so
 long as the mainline Palestinian groups,
 which provide the bulk of his arms and
 fighting men, are prepared to cooperate
 with the Syrians.
 The  Syrian-Palestinian  agreement
 caused immediate concern among
 Lebanon's top Christian leaders. Presi-

 dent Franjiyah-apparently with the en-
 couragement of Interior Minister
 Shamun-attached  new  conditions  to
 signing the constitutional amendment that
 provides for the early election of his
 successor. Franjiyah and Shamun fear
 that Asad may have secretly agreed to
 scrap the February political settlement,
 under which the Christians would salvage
 much of their political position.
 Damascus has denied this publicly and
 privately. Saiga leader Zuhayr Muhsin
 reportedly told representatives of the
 Christian Phalanges Party at a meeting of
 the truce committee this week that Syria
 had made no secret commitments to
 Arafat, and Asad probably gave similar
 assurances to a special envoy of Franjiyah
 who visited Damascus on April 21.
 The restoration of the truce committee
 has reduced the level of fighting, which
 late last week had again become intense in
 Beirut and nearby mountain villages. By
 midweek, however, the committee was
 still having trouble suppressing violence in
 the capital, with elements on both sides
 continuing to trade artillery and mortar
 fire.

 ISRAEL  -     / I
 A march staged in the Israeli-occupied
 West Bank on April 18-19 by the Jewish
 ultraconservative Gush Emunim group
 touched off a new round of violent an-
 ti-Israeli demonstrations this week by
 West Bank Arabs strongly opposed to the
 group's demands that Jews be permitted
 to settle in greater numbers in the
 territory.
 Some 30,000 Israelis reportedly par-
 ticipated in the march, which began near
 Ram Allah and ended at Jericho. The
 event was timed to influence a govern-
 ment debate on West Bank settlement
 policy tentatively scheduled for the end of
 April. Disagreement among Israeli
 political factions over the wisdom of per-
 mitting the march will sharpen the debate.
 In Nabulus, one Arab demonstrator
 was killed and eight others wounded by
 Israeli troops attempting to restore order.
 Another Arab was wounded by Israeli
 soldiers in a similar incident at Jenin. One
 of the largest demonstrations occurred in
 Ram Allah, triggered by the accidental
 shooting late last week of a six-year-old
 Arab boy by Israeli troops. The Israelis
 were trying to disperse a crowd quarreling
 over the results of the municipal council
 elections on April 12.
 Israeli authorities imposed curfews on
 several towns and reinforced their
 military and police forces in the territory.
 By midweek an uneasy calm appeared to
 be returning to the West Bank, and some
 curfews were lifted. Israeli officials are
 also appealing-as they did during the
 Arab demonstrations in February and
 March-to the members of municipal
 councils in the area to help maintain
 order.  Many of these councilmen,
 however, were elected last week on
 nationalist slates favoring the Palestine
 Liberation Organization. The Israelis are
 likely to have difficulty securing   'r
 cooperation.
 IRAQ-SYRIA
 Iraq cut off oil to Syria on April 9, forc-
 ing Damascus to seek high quality crude
 elsewhere to meet its commercial and
 military needs. The Syrians have tem-
 porarily curtailed or suspended domestic
 air service to conserve aviation fuel and
 have approached the Saudis to help make
 up the shortfall.
 The transit pipeline agreement between
 Iraq and Syria, under which Syria had
 been buying 50,000 barrels per day of
 Iraqi crude at a price of only $3.00 per
 barrel, expired last December. Since then,
 differences over the future sale price of
 Iraqi oil and over Syrian transit fees have
 prevented Damascus and Baghdad from
 concluding a new agreement.
 Syria depends exclusively on Iraq for
 light crude. Syria earned some $150
 million last year in transit fees on the oil
 passing from Iraq through Syria to the
 Mediterranean.
 Damascus could buy light crude from
 other suppliers-at world market prices,
 more than $11.50 per barrel. Syria would
 also incur additional transport costs in
 getting the oil to the Homs refinery. If
 Damascus purchases light crude from
 Saudi Arabia, the Saudis might provide
 some concessions, but Syria would still
 have to pay substantially more than under
 the Iraqi terms in effect until last
 December.
 The move may have been timed to
 hamper Syria's efforts to resolve the
 Lebanese crisis. The Iraqis have supplied
 arms and money to fedayeen radicals in
 an effort to undercut Syrian mediation ef-
 forts there and have been vocal in their
 criticism of recent Damascus policies.
 Baghdad would like to see a Syrian failure
 in Lebanon lead to the overthrow of Presi-
 dent Asad.
 The two rival Baathist regimes in Syria
 and Iraq have been bickering more or less
 openly since last spring when Damascus
 cut off water to Iraq from the Euphrates
 River after Iraq allegedly meddled in
 Syria's internal affairs. If Syria decides to
 put pressure on Iraq to resume oil
 shipments, cutting the flow of water again
 would be the most obvious and effective
 RHODESIA
 Rhodesian nationalist guerrillas based
 in Mozambique have for the first time at-
 tacked important lines of communication
 in southeastern Rhodesia.
 A train on the Rutenga-Beitbridge
 railway was damaged last weekend by an
 explosive device.  Earlier this month,
 Rhodesian security forces had removed an
 unexploded device from the tracks.
 The Fort Victoria - Beitbridge highway
 was temporarily closed by the Rhodesian
 police on April 19 after three South
 African tourists were killed and another

 wounded in a terrorist attack the previous
 night.
 Until now, most guerrilla activity in the
 southeast has been within 10 to 15 miles
 of the Mozambique border, but a few
 small guerrilla groups have penetrated
 farther into southern portions of the coun-
 try. The recent incidents occurred about
 85 miles from the border.
 Most guerrillas operating in Rhodesia
 are in the northeast, long the focus of in-
 surgent activity. There are probably now
 only a few hundred guerrillas in the
 southeast. With the end of the rainy
 season at hand, however, the insurgents
 may be shifting more of their activity to
 the southeast where natural cover is better
 during the dry season.
 SOUTH AFRICA - ISRAEL
 South African Prime Minister Vorster,
 following his recent four-day visit to
 Israel, announced that the two countries
 have reached a broad agreement to ex-
 pand economic and scientific cooperation.
 Vorster probably at least explored
 possibilities  for  obtaining  Israeli  ar-
 maments to strengthen South Africa's
 armed forces.
 Vorster said that a joint ministerial
 Prime Ministers Forster (1) and Rabin during their talks in Jerusalem
 o ea
 committee would meet regularly to
 promote projects using South African raw
 materials and Israel's skilled manpower.
 Prospects appear slim, however, for a
 significant expansion in nonmilitary
 trade, which is now less than 1 percent of
 either state's total foreign trade.
 Speculation that the South Africans are
 shopping for Israeli arms has been
 prompted by the 40-percent increase in
 the defense budget for the coming year
 that Vorster submitted to his parliament
 last month. South Africa in fact could
 become one of Israel's best markets for
 arms and technical military assistance.
 Early this year Israel sold to South
 Africa 10 tank hulls, from which South
 Africa will probably try to assemble ar-
 mored vehicles. Pretoria has reportedly
 been negotiating since late  1974 for
 Reshef-class patrol boats and Gabriel
 naval cruise missiles; sales of these items
 have not been confirmed.
 Other Israeli weapons that might in-
 terest South Africa are the Kfir fighter,
 the Shafrir air-to-air missile, and the
 Arava STOL transport. Since Pretoria
 has Mirages in its inventory, South
 African air force personnel would have lit-
 tle trouble in adapting to the Kfir, which
 is based on a Mirage. Any sales or
 transfers of the Kfir, which has US
 engines, would require US approval,
 however.
 Favorable reactions to the visit in
 South Africa have apparently strengthen-
 ed domestic support for Vorster's efforts
 to increase the limited number of states
 openly supportive of South Africa. Ap-
 parently, Rabin is willing to lend himself
 to South Africa's attempt to play up the
 importance of Vorster's visit even though
 it might hinder Israel's efforts to
 re-establish ties with black Africa and
 provide additional grist for Israel's
 detractors in the UN.           125X1
 INDIA    2 CPS -2 t
 During the past week Prime Minister
 Gandhi's government moved to improve

 issues and the resumption of diplomatic
 relations.
 China and India withdrew ambassadors
 prior to the Sino-Indian border war of
 1962. Relations were never severed, and
 small diplomatic missions have continued
 to operate. Occasional efforts to improve
 relations in recent years have come to
 nothing because of recurrent disputes and
 occasional border clashes.
 China has long insisted that India,
 which was the first to withdraw its am-
 bassador, be the first to return one. The
 Indians have been reluctant to comply in
 the absence of an unequivocal commit-
 ment by China to reciprocate. New Delhi
 finally conceded to the Chinese demand,
 with only a verbal understanding that
 Peking would send an ambassador to New
 Delhi shortly after the Indian diplomat
 presents his credentials.
 The announced Indian willingness to
 meet with the Pakistanis to discuss possi-
 ble renewal of overflights, resumption of
 rail and road communications, and
 restoration of diplomatic ties, came in
 response to a Pakistani decision to drop a
 five-year-old case against India before the
 International Civil Aviation Organiza-
 tion. Negotiations are likely to be difficult
 and could bog down once again in an ex-
 change of recriminations.
 In any event, India will still face un-
 resolved problems with both countries.
 China and India have conflicting border
 claims; Kashmir will remain an unsettled
 issue between Pakistan and India.
 India probably hopes by these latest
 moves to improve its position among
 Third World countries prior to the non-
 aligned summit meeting in August. India
 is regarded by many of these nations as
 too closely tied to the Soviet Union.
 Indian officials presumably informed
 Soviet diplomats of the proposed in-
 itiatives prior to the public an-
 nouncements and, probably not coin-
 cidentally, announced on April 15 the
 signing of a major trade pact with the
 Soviet Union. Gandhi reportedly is plan-
 ning to visit Moscow early in June to con-
 fer with Soviet leaders.
 CHINA  2 ~ - 3
 Senior military leader Yeh Chien-ying,
 a staunch supporter of ousted Teng
 Hsiao-ping, returned to Peking last week
 after a three-month absence, reportedly
 in south China. His return suggests he is
 reasonably satisfied with the compromises
 arranged after Teng's fall. It is also a
 further indication that moderates have
 come through that event relatively un-
 scathed.
 Yeh reportedly walked off his Defense
 Ministry job in protest last January, when
 Teng was not named to succeed Chou
 En-lai as premier. The defense job had ap-
 parently been kept open for Yeh. To mask
 this high-level disagreement over the at-
 tack on Teng, Peking issued a document
 claiming that Yeh was "ill" and that his
 duties were being performed by Politburo
 member Chen Hsi-lien. Chen was never
 identified-publicly or privately-as act-
 ing  defense  minister  and  has  not
 Yeh Chien-ying
 appeared in public since February 28.
 Yeh was not identified as defense
 minister in his public appearance last
 week, but that in itself is not particularly
 significant. He is not usually so identified
 when he appears in public. It seems un-
 likely that he would have returned to Pe-
 king if he had lost the Defense Ministry
 job, although it is possible that this posi-
 tion, as well as that of chief of staff, is still
 subject to bargaining. Yeh is the last
 leading moderate to appear since Teng's
 fall and was himself reportedly under
 criticism in February. His return to public
 view makes even more glaring the absence
 of all but one of the party leftists leading
 the attack on Teng. Their nonappearance
 suggests serious dissatisfaction with the
 recent turn of events.
 The moderates appear to have been
 successful in restricting the campaign to
 Teng and protecting his supporters. Mao
 himself reportedly stated recently that the
 Cultural Revolution of the mid- I960s was
 "30 percent bad" because too many inno-

 CAMBODIA
 The Khmer communists, one year after
 their  take-over, completed  their
 governmental reorganization last week,
 announcing  appointments  to   top
 positions. The announcements followed a
 three-day session of the popular assembly,
 elected last month, which ratified the ap-
 pointments and officially accepted the
 "retirement" of Prince Sihanouk and the
 resignation of the former cabinet.
 Khieu Samphan was named chairman
 of the new State Presidium and will
 doubtless continue as the regime's leading
 spokesman. Several other leading com-
 munist figures have kept their cabinet
 positions-most notably deputy prime
 ministers leng Sary and Son Sen who
 retained the portfolios for foreign affairs
 and defense respectively. They have held
 these posts since last August. Their wives
 have also been given cabinet posts.

 President Geisel hopes to forge closer
 ties with France when he meets with
 President Giscard d'Estaing in Paris next
 week. Consultations between the two
 nations have become frequent during the
 past year, and an exchange of visits by the
 foreign ministers helped set the stage for
 this state visit.
 The meeting could produce some major
 agreements since commercial talks are
 planned and the groundwork is being laid
 for closer economic and cultural ties. Dur-
 ing the past week, Brazil and France have
 already agreed to cooperate in space ex-
 ploration and, according to press reports,
 are making preparations for large scale
 mineral exploration in Brazil and for the
 construction of a major hydroelectric
 project.

 The topics to be discussed are likely to
 include the newly independent nations of
 Portuguese Africa. Both countries are in-
 terested in strengthening relations there.
 President Giscard will probably also show
 interest in the state of Brazilian-US
 relations in the aftermath of the visit by
 Secretary Kissinger.
 Much of the potential for a significant
 improvement in relations apparently still
 hinges on the issue of nuclear cooperation.
 The Brazilians have already obtained a
 full nuclear fuel cycle from the West Ger-
 mans and do not want to be committed to
 specific projects by the French. France,
 however, has expressed a desire to
 prospect for uranium ore in Brazil and to
 establish uranium enrichment facilities
 there. Earlier this year Foreign Minister
 Sauvagnargues publicly denied reports of
 a major dispute, but an agreement setting

 the war, is now chairman of the popular
 assembly's standing committee. Other
 new faces include Sao Phim and Nhim

 Former prime minister Penn Nouth
 was named to an honorary position of
 "high counselor," but he is the only im-

 retention suggests that he will continue to

 munist participation in the government.

 Demonstrations by French leftist par-
 ties could mar the festivities. A French
 Communist newspaper has already scored
 the visit, and leftists have called for
 protest demonstrations on the grounds
 that Geisel will be trying to attract in-
 dustrial investment to Brazil, with its
 cheap labor market, at a time when firms
 are laying off workers in France. The
 probability of serious disruptions is re-
 duced, however, by the fact that the Bra-
 zilian delegation will be housed on the
 outskirts of Paris, and the main banquet
 is to be held at Versailles.
 Even if little of substance results from
 the talks, they will serve to underscore
 Brazil's claim to be an independent
 emerging power that can deal with great
 nations on an equal basis. It is with this in
 mind that Geisel also plans to travel to
 Great  Britain  next  month.          25X1

 Christian  Democratic leader Zac-

 his last minute consultations aimed at

 Zaccagnini went ahead with the talks

 week appeared to rule out a compromise
 when they called on all of the other parties

 munist parliamentary support. The Chris-
 tian Democrats' counterproposal would
 leave the Moro government in place but
 have it negotiate emergency economic
 measures and a compromise on the abor-
 tion question with all parties except the
 neo-fascists.
 The Socialists at first refused even to
 discuss the Christian Democratic offer
 but agreed to meet with Zaccagnini when
 the other parties cautiously left the door
 open  to  further negotiations.  After
 meeting with Zaccagnini this week,
 Socialist chief De Martino came close to
 rejecting his proposal but said that the
 Socialists would not reply formally until
 the Christian Democratic leader had con-
 sulted the other parties.
 At this point, it appears that Zac-
 cagnini's only hope of avoiding an elec-
 tion centers on the possibility of finding
 enough common ground with the Com-
 munists to bring pressure on the Socialists
 to reconsider their position. Zaccagnini
 and the Communists share a desire to
 postpone the contest but differ on how to
 do it. The Communists are pushing their
 own emergency formula under which the
 government would consult with them in
 parliament on a much broader range of
 issues than Zaccagnini proposes.
 Conservative  Christian  Democrats
 have so far refused to consider the Com-
 munist Party's solution, because they fear
 that, in practice, it would enable the Com-
 munists, through the back door, to
 become part of the government's
 parliamentary majority. Under the
 proposal that the Christian Democrats
 have authorized Zaccagnini to present,
 the Communists would still be considered
 part of the opposition, despite their con-
 sultative role.
 President Leone did not appear very
 confident this week that Zaccagnini would
 succeed in averting an electoral show-
 down. In recent months, Leone has stead-
 fastly opposed an early election.

 ARMS STANDARDIZATION
 Ten European members of NATO's
 military organization and France met in
 Rome April 9 to consider steps to
 promote European collaboration in arms
 standardization and production.
 The principal order of business at the
 meeting was the assignment of tasks to
 key national participants. Belgium, which
 was largely responsible for gaining French
 participation in the arms talks, will chair
 a steering group that will coordinate four
 joint European arms projects: a tactical
 combat aircraft, tank ammunition, a
 short-range  antitank  weapon,  and
 minesweepers.
 The British will collate national require-
 ments and draw up an overall schedule
 for European equipment replacement.
 The Germans have been given the
 politically sensitive task of working out
 the guidelines for European arms
 cooperation. Bonn has stressed the impor-
 tance of maintaining momentum and en-
 suring that "political principles" not be
 lost sight of in the pursuit of specific pro-
 jects. Critical issues for the group are how
 it will be related to NATO and how it will
 achieve a "two-way street" in arms trade
 with the US.
 Other important questions to be resolv-
 ed are how to preserve national produc-
 tion capabilities within a comprehensive
 European framework and how to com-
 pensate countries like Greece, which lack
 the industrial capability to share in many
 common production efforts.
 Efforts of this group to work out
 collaborative production  arrangements
 have tended to eclipse separate NATO
 standardization discussions,  limiting
 the latter to the establishment of com-
 mon equipment standards for each ally to
 meet. Most of the European members of
 the Alliance favor such a "standard-set-
 ting" role for NATO and an enhanced
 production role for Western Europe. They
 see such an arrangement as furthering
 their goal of recognition of Western
 Europe as an equal partner in the
 Alliance.

 EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
 The EC Commission expects income
 disparities among member countries over
 the next five years to continue to widen.
 Community cohesion as a result will be
 further strained, policy coordination will
 become more difficult, and pressure for
 adopting trade restrictions will intensify.
 The commission estimates that during
 1976-80 the annual real growth rate of the
 community will be 4.4 percent, inflation
 will average 7.5 percent, and unemploy-
 ment will remain relatively high by EC
 standards-probably 3.2 percent in 1980.
 Worse than average performance is
 generally expected in Great Britain, Italy,
 Ireland, and Luxembourg.
 A medium-term EC economic program
 is still being developed. The commission
 would give top priority to job-creating in-
 vestment and anti-inflation measures. It
 suggests investment subsidies, continued
 curbs on labor immigration from third
 countries, subsidies for hiring new
 workers, and liberalizing retirement rules.
 It  also  favors formal pacts among
 business, labor, and government-ap-
 parently to control wage increases, slow
 inflation, and encourage investment.
 Diverging economic trends coupled
 with    domestic  political  pressures
 guarantee  continuing     disagreement
 among members over future community
 economic policies. Britain and Italy can
 he expected to advocate measures to
 stimulate production and employment,
 while West Germany will press for strict
 anti-inflationary policies and will resist
 calls for greater transfer of its resources.
 Persistent economic disparities within
 the community may encourage individual
 members to opt for trade controls, con-
 trary to the wishes of the commission.
 Projected economic conditions in Italy
 and Britain will increase pressures in these
 countries to restrict third country im-
 ports. Any such unilateral moves would
 violate the Treaty of Rome and further
 undermine  community cohesion.

 The failure of the Soviet grain harvest
 last year is causing more and more
 localized food shortages.'In rural areas es-
 pecially, there are reports of food shor-
 tages that in some cases may be severe.
 Supplies of most foods are adequate in the
 central parts of major cities.
 Food shortages will ease as the new
 crop becomes available, but meat supplies
 will become increasingly tight. We es-
 timate that total meat production in 1976
 may fall by as much as one quarter below
 1975 levels. State-operated packing plants
 will be hard-pressed to meet meat produc-
 tion goals already reduced 18 percent
 from 1975.
 Private sector meat output, about one
 third of the total, may be off even more.
 Scattered reports indicate difficulties in
 obtaining feed for privately owned
 livestock. In order to maintain herds in
 the "socialized" sector, collective and
 state farms may refuse to sell pigs from
 the spring farrowing to private
 households. These piglets are a primary
 source of private sector meat production.
 Soviet authorities are taking steps to
 deal with the meat shortages. The USSR
 has just purchased from New Zealand
 35,000 tons of mutton and beef, costing
 about $28 million. The meat is to be
 shipped between January and July, the
 period when we expect domestic supplies
 to be most restricted. Since the beginning
 of the year, there have also been rumors
 of meat im ort contracts with Australia
 and France.

 President and party chief Gustav

 Soviet Politburo member Andrey

 stewardship, labeling him an "outstan-

 of conditional rehabilitation to former

 Svoboda underlined continuity in the top

 with the re-election of Rude Pravo editor-

 a number of ultraconservative holdovers
 from the Novotny period. The changes
 were even more striking among the can-

 MEXICO
 The Echeverria government is under
 fire from two of its most important con-
 stituents. The business community is up in
 arms over a draft law on urban land use,
 and angry campesinos are courting
 violence in their efforts to obtain more
 land. Both problems could carry over into
 the administration of President
 Echeverria's successor, Jose Lopez Por-
 tillo, who takes over in December.
 The draft "human settlements" law has
 sparked the most bitter business-govern-
 ment dispute in recent years. Its main pur-
 pose is to curb land speculation by giving
 local governments the power to zone land
 for "socially beneficial" uses. Its intent is
 to establish a system to deal with an ex-
 pected huge urban population growth.
 The private sector views the legislation
 as an unconstitutional assault on private
 ownership and part of a trend under
 Echeverria toward statism. Government
 proponents say the intent is not to con-
 fiscate but to correct chaotic urban
 growth by channeling new migration into
 sparsely settled areas and restraining land
 speculators.
 As a result of the proposed law, the
 business community's initial enthusiasm
 for Lopez Portillo as the next president
 has waned. Still too much in the
 President's shadow to take an indepen-
 dent stand, Lopez Portillo has sided with
 Echeverria on the issue.
 Illegal land seizures in the countryside
 are worrying the government even more.
 Earlier this month, farm laborers carrying
 guns occupied a 400-hectare plot in the
 rich Yaqui Valley in the state of Sonora,

 ly owned farms predominate. Violence
 was averted, but landowners fear that
 failure to dislodge these squatters will en-
 courage others. Land invasions on a
 smaller scale did in fact take place recent-
 ly in four other states.
 While acknowledging that invasions
 usually precede a change in ad-
 ministrations  as campesinos  try  to
 pressure  the  incoming  president,
 Echeverria and Lopez Portillo have
 spoken out forcefully on the incidents,
 calling on the campesinos to avoid
 violence.
 The government has staves] Off similar
 trouble in the past by  sending egbinet
 ministers to make promises to the
 campesinos and to relieve the fears of lan-
 downers. This time, however, officials are
 concerned that the practice of buying time
 has reached the point of diminishing
 return and that serious violence is a real
 possibility.

 ARGENTINA
 Argentina's military rulers acted with
 moderation in an early test of their ability
 to handle labor's reaction to the recently
 announced economic austerity program.
 Troops arrested a few workers in stopping
 a wildcat strike at the General Motors
 Buenos Aires plant last Monday.
 Further government-labor tests may lie
 ahead. Slowdowns and extensive sabotage
 of production have been reported at other
 automotive plants in Buenos Aires and
 Cordoba. Absenteeism, which dropped
 sharply following the coup on March 24,
 is rising again.
 Ford workers in Buenos Aires are said
 to be ready to demand a 40-percent wage
 hike, an increase incompatible with the
 terms of the government's stabilization
 program.
 Labor problems in the automotive in-
 dustry are especially touchy because the
 plants are foreign owned. Potential
 foreign investors that Argentina hopes to
 attract will be observing how vigorously
 the government deals with troubles in
 these  plants.  Moreover,  automotive
 products are important earners of urgently
 needed foreign exchange.
 Success of the government's program
 to restore economic stability will depend
 on its ability to control labor. The govern-
 ment faces a difficult choice. If disruptive
 actions continue, more repressive
 measures will be needed. Greater repres-
 sion, however, could strengthen popular
 support for leftist movements and make
 the government's other main task-the
 ment of terrorism-more difficult.

 The three major noncommunist parties are expected
 to divide most of Sunday's vote, with the Communists
 running a distant fourth. Actual formation of a new
 government must await election within 60 to 75 days of
 a new president, who will play a major role in negotiating
 its composition.
 Portuguese voters go to the polls on
 April 25-the second anniversary of the
 overthrow of the Caetano regime-to
 select their first freely elected parliament
 in half a century. The election represents
 another victory for the noncommunist
 parties and military officers in their ef-
 forts to thwart the Communists' drive for
 power, although it may not be the final
 round in the struggle.
 The results of the election on Sunday,
 coupled with the outcome of the presiden-
 tial election to be held 60-70 days later,
 will determine the shape of the new
 government to be installed this summer.
 Tight security measures have been im-
 posed to assure that the balloting for the
 new 263-seat Assembly of the Republic
 takes place without serious disruption.
 The "operational" wing of the military
 led by army Chief of Staff Ramalho
 Eanes, which has insisted on returning the
 government to civilian hands and has been
 cooperating closely with the democratic
 parties, has been successful in keep-
 ing the widespread violence during the
 campaign from getting out of hand.
 With the pronounced shift away from
 the left since last summer, the center and
 center-right parties should do well. The
 latest polls still show a large number of
 uncommitted  voters,  however, which,
 combined with a degree of voter apathy,
 could result in a low voter turnout.
 This could work in favor of the better
 organized left.
 Although 14 parties are participating,
 only 4 appear to have a chance of ob-
 taining a significant percentage of the
 vote-the Socialists, the centrist Popular
 Democrats, the center-right Social

 Portugal: Election Preview
 Democratic Center, and the Communists.
 Socialist Party
 The fact that a democratic election is
 being held at all owes much to the persis-
 tent opposition of Mario Soares and other
 Socialist leaders to former prime minister
 Vasco Goncalves and his Communist sup-
 porters. The irony is that the conservative
 backlash, which the Socialists by their
 criticism of the left helped to trigger, will
 cut into the Socialists' own vote,
 The Socialists-who have repeatedly
 stated their opposition to joining a
 post-election coalition-hope to obtain
 enough assembly seats to control the
 Mario Soares  ~C
 government. To accomplish this, they say
 they must capture 40 percent or more of
 the popular vote. The party has portrayed
 itself as the only realistic alternative to an
 unstable government of the right, attempt-
 ing to convince voters that the Socialists
 are in the best position-because of their
 good  international connections-to
 oversee Portugal's economic recovery.
 To succeed, the Socialists will have to
 retain most of the plurality vote which
 they gained in the constituent assembly
 election last year, make inroads into
 Communist strength, pick up support
 from the Popular Democratic Party's
 alienated left wing, and hold their own
 among first-time voters, many of whom
 come from the largely conservative ranks
 of Angola returnees. A lagging effort in
 the closing weeks of the campaign in-
 dicates that they will probably fall short
 of their goal and have to settle for 30 to 35
 percent of the vote.
 Popular Democratic Party
 The Popular Democrats, led by Fran-
 cisco Sa Carneiro, are hoping to
 capitalize on the shift to the right to im-
 prove substantially on the 26-percent
 share of the vote they received last year,
 which they believe would assure participa-
 tion in the new government.
 The party's strategy of seeking a
 post-election coalition with the Socialists
 will be complicated by its campaign tactic
 of attacking Snares' party and attempting
 to link the Socialists with the Communists
 in the public mind.
 The Popular Democrats have a strong
 natural constituency in both the north and
 in the Azores and Madeiras, but they have
 been hampered in broadening their sup-
 port by a lack of funds and of experienced

 campaigners-the result of a split by the
 party's left-wing leaders in December.
 The Popular Democrats have developed
 close ties with the Angola refugees and
 with small farmers, who are incensed at
 the Socialist-supported government land
 reform program.
 Francisco Sa Carneiro ? ,Z
 In order to achieve their election aims,
 the Popular Democrats must hold their
 strength in the north while picking up
 significant numbers of those who voted
 Socialist in the Constituent Assembly
 election last year. Opinion polls, which
 put the Popular Democrats' strength at 28
 to 35 percent, would appear to give them
 an outside chance of supplanting the
 Socialists as the plurality party.
 Social Democratic Center
 The Popular Democrats probably could
 have hoped for even greater gains were it
 not for the campaign surge of the Social
 Democratic Center, the only major party
 which has not participated in recent
 governments. Ably led by Diogo Freitas
 do Amaral, the party has effectively
 presented itself as a fresh alternative to a
 succession of leftist governments whose
 "socialist" policies have "destroyed" the
 economy. In seeking votes from much the
 same constituency as the Popular
 Democrats, particularly in the north, the
 Center has attempted to tie the rival party
 to the government's failings.
 Prevented from campaigning by leftist
 agitators and hampered by a rightist im-
 age in last year's election, the Social
 Democratic Center received only 7.6 per-
 cent of the vote. Its goal this time is to tri-
 ple that figure. If the party receives 18 to
 25 percent of the vote, as-some polls have
 indicated, it will have a strong claim to
 participation in the government.
 Communist Party
 The decision to hold-free elections is a
 sharp setback for the Communists, who
 have lobbied vigorously against them and
 tried to provoke a postponement behind
 the scenes. Sensing his party's increasing
 isolation, Alvaro Cunha] has attempted
 during the campaign to lay the
 groundwork for a "popular front" coali-
 tion government with the Socialists. This
 strategy  also  appears  to  have  little
 chance of success, although some re-
 ports indicate that the Communists may
 have  infiltrated  the  Socialist Party's
 left wing in order to influence that
 party's decision after the election.
 The Communists-who won 13 percent
 of the vote last year-are hoping to garner
 at least 10 percent to give at least some
 credibility to their argument that they
 should be in the new government.
 Although the party expects to lose ground
 because of the conservative backlash,
 much of this may be offset by inheriting
 most of the 4.5 percent cast last year for
 its front organization, the Portuguese
 Democratic Movement, which is not run-
 ning candidates of its own. The Com-
 munists should poll between 8 and 12 per-
 cent of the vote.
 The Far Left
 The significance of the eight far left
 parties on the ballot is that they will draw
 votes away from the Communists. They
 have effectively used free media exposure
 to disparage ties between Cunhal's party
 and Soviet leaders-portrayed as
 "neo-Hitlers" and "monsters" bent on
 military expansion who deprive their peo-
 ple of political rights. The far left parties
 should retain the 4 percent they received in
 the elections last year, giving them
 at most two or three assembly seats.

 Government Possibilities
 It appears unlikely that a clear winner
 will emerge from Sunday's balloting. A
 rough split of the electorate among the
 three noncommunist parties, with the
 Communists trailing a distant fourth, as
 the polls are predicting, is likely to result
 in a coalition government comprising the
 Socialists and one or both of the parties
 on their right. Such a coalition would
 have the blessing of the military as well as
 a broad base of popular support, but
 could be rent by deep-seated differences
 over government policy.
 Should the Socialists win anywhere
 near the 40 percent they are seeking, they
 will probably try to form a government on
 their own with support from in-
 dependents. Such a government is likely
 to be viewed with somewhat less favor by
 the "operational" military, who, although
 they have worked closely with the
 Socialists since November, oppose many
 of the programs supported by the party's
 left wing. Soares and other party
 moderates are also concerned about the
 strength  of the left wing and may
 seek  to  sharply  limit  its  role  in
 party policy after the election.

 and the Social Democratic Center could

 munist participation.
 The Presidential Election
 Whatever the outcome of the assembly
 election, the new president-who is given
 extensive  powers  under the con-
 stitution-will play an important role in
 forming the government.
 Disagreement among members of the
 Revolutionary. Council-which has ruled
 Portugal for the past two years-over the
 advisability  of running military can-
 didates has led to speculation that a
 civilian may be considered for the office.
 A near-majority vote for one of the non-
 communist parties could increase the
 likelihood of a civilian president. An in-
 conclusive  parliamentary  election,
 however, would seem to dictate the selec-
 tion of a strong military figure, capable of
 arbitrating policy differences among the
 parties in the coalition likely to emerge.
 The present head of state, Costa
 Gomes, Prime Minister Azevedo, and
 army Chief of Staff General Eanes appear
 to be fading from contention. Eanes is
 considered irreplaceable in his present
 position, while party and military support
 for both Costa Gomes and Azevedo has
 noticeably declined. Northern military
 region commander Pires Veloso has
 emerged as the military front-runner, with
 some support in each of the three major
 noncommunist parties.
 Pires Veloso is a tough professional
 soldier and a rigid disciplinarian who has
 been discreetly campaigning behind the
 scenes. Recent statements by the general
 indicate that as president he would adopt
 a hard line against leftist manipulation of
 the labor sector, which has contributed
 strongly to the present economic malaise.
 The two-month interregnum between
 elections could see various attempts to
 disrupt the relative stability Portugal has
 enjoyed since November. A poor election
 showing, coupled with probable exclusion
 from the government, could prompt the
 Communists to take some rash action, in-
 cluding an attempt, in collusion with left-
 ist military officers, to have the election
 results suspended.
 Within the Revolutionary Council
 itself, the rivalry between the "political"
 officers led by Costa Gomes and Foreign
 Minister Melo Antunes and the
 "operationals" who  look  to General
 Eanes also could reach a flashpoint as the      25X1
 "politicals" are faced with turnip   ower
 over to elected civilians.

 Kenya's traditional concerns over two of its hostile
 neighbors-Somalia and Uganda-have been aggravated
 by fear that it might be drawn into a possible war over
 the French Territory of the Afars and Issas.

 Kenya: Worried About Neighbors
 Kenya believes it is seriously threatened
 by two hostile neighbors-Somalia and
 Uganda-armed  with  sophisticated
 Soviet weapons and eager to advance
 claims to parts of Kenyan territory.
 Nairobi maintains one of the smaller
 armies in sub-Saharan Africa, preferring
 to emphasize economic development
 rather than military strength.
 Tribal considerations may also enter
 into the decision to keep the army
 relatively small. It is the only significant
 institution in Kenya not dominated by
 members of President Kenyatta's Kikuyu
 tribe, although recent reorganizations and
 promotions are gradually shifting the
 balance to the Kikuyu.
 I n the past, the Kenyans depended upon
 their mutual defense pact with Ethiopia
 and a long-standing tacit agreement with
 the UK providing for British assistance in
 the event of an attack on Kenya.
 Nairobi now believes it can no longer
 count on British assistance and realizes
 that the chances of help from Ethiopia
 have been diminished by Addis Ababa's
 problems with Somalia and troubles with
 insurgencies in Eritrea and elsewhere.
 The Kenyans are in fact concerned that
 the quarrel between Ethiopia and Somalia
 over the future of the French Territory of
 the Afars and Issas will lead to open war-
 fare and that Kenya will be drawn into
 the conflict.
 Kenya's policy toward the Horn of
 Africa is marked by friendship with
 Ethiopia, its partner in a 13-year-old
 defense pact, and distrust of Somalia,
 which claims about one fifth of Kenya.
 Addis
 Kenya supports Paris' announced inten-
 tion to grant independence to the French
 Territory of the Afars and Issas.
 Somali designs on the territory-and
 Ethiopia's determination to thwart
 them-worry the Kenyans, however,
 because they fear their defense pact with
 Addis Ababa might embroil them in any
 military conflict that develops.
 Nairobi also believes that a successful
 Somali take-over of the territory would
 encourage Mogadiscio to act on its claims
 to  the  northeastern  part  of
 Kenya-inhabited primarily by ethnic
 Somalis-perhaps by starting a new in-
 surgency there. The disputed area is
 sparsely settled and all but impossible for
 Kenya to defend.
 The Soviet presence in Somalia has
 heightened Kenyan concerns. Kenya has
 been suspicious of the Soviets ever since
 Moscow supported some Kenyan leftists
 in the 1960s.
 In keeping with the terms of the
 Kenya-Ethiopia defense pact, officials
 from both governments met early this
 year to coordinate contingency planning
 against Somalia. Nairobi has tentatively
 agreed to permit Ethiopia's armed forces
 to use Kenyan airports and other facilities
 in the event of war between Addis Ababa
 and Mogadiscio.
 Kenya would be reluctant, however, to
 commit its own weak forces directly
 against Somalia, Should Ethiopia request
 direct  Kenyan  intervention,  Nairobi
 would probably do little more than rein-
 force its border units so as to tic down
 Somali troops.
 The Kenya-Uganda Balance
 Relations between Kenya and Uganda,
 difficult since Idi Amin came to power in
 1971, reached a new low recently. In
 February, Amin publicly claimed part of
 western Kenya, and Nairobi responded by

 organizing anti-Amin demonstrations and
 refusing to allow goods imported through
 Kenya's harbors to he transshipped to
 Uganda.
 The Kenyans later eased the restriction,
 but imposed a number of other economic
 penalties, such as cutting in half Uganda's
 fuel allotment from the Nairobi refinery.
 These sanctions appear, to be hurting
 the Ugandan economy and may have
 provoked  cross-border  forays  by
 helicopter-borne Ugandan _ troops this
 month-ostensibly seekin
 Kenyan leaders, alwa
 Amin's erratic behavior, now are even'
 more concerned by his accumulation of
 Soviet weapons and advisers, and by
 Uganda's ties to radical Arab states and
 Somalia. The Kenyans suspect that
 Amin's claims to parts of Kenya were
 made in collusion with Somali President
 Siad; we have no evidence to support this
 suspicion.
 Kenya fears that if Mogadiscio does
 renew the insurgency in northeast Kenya,
 Uganda might lend support by staging
 some form of military diversion.
 President Amin's term as chairman of
 the Organization of African Unity ends in
 July, and the Kenyans think he may feel
 free thereafter to take more aggressive ac-
 tion against Kenya. They are handling
 him very carefully. Kenyatta returned the
 Ugandan helicopters and several soldiers
 captured during the recent incursions with
 a stern warning to Amin.
 Nairobi may also ease the economic
 restrictions in order to avoid giving Amin
 justification for a military move against
 Kenya on the grounds that it is strangling
 Uganda economically.
 Kenyan leaders worry about Amin 's
 superiority in weapons and numbers of
 troops. Kenyan units are generally better
 trained and disciplined,

 Kenya is seeking military aid Irons t e
 US and probably from others as well. Ef-
 forts to interest the British in providing
 troops or aircraft for a joint exercise or
 some other show of force, preferably near
 the border, have been unsuccessful.
 The Uganda Side
 Amin has his own army problems. In
 addition to chronic indiscipline and plot-
 ting in the military, sonic officers are
 reportedly unhappy with his hostility
 toward Kenya and with shortages of food
 and supplies resulting from Kenya's
 economic restrictions.
 Nevertheless, Aniin apparently feels
 the need for an almost constant external
 threat to divert popular attention from the
 effects of his five years of maladministra-
 tion and turmoil.
 In the event of a conflict between
 Ethiopia and Somalia, Amin probably
 would, at a minimurn, make military
 gestures that would tie down Kenyan
 troops on the western border.
 It is far less likely that Amin would
 strike out on his own against Kenya.
 Under  the  right  circumstances,
 however-such as a period of turmoil that
 might  follow  Kenyatta's death-the
 Uganda leader might try to seize a piece
 of Kenyan territory.
 Uganda's  military superiority  over
 Kenya would give it an initial advantage,
 but it probably could not sustain major
 operations for long. Uganda has few
 well-trained ground force officers and
 even fewer qualified jet pilots.
 A military campaign would bop down
 quickly because of logistics problems and
 the military indiscipline that has resulted
 from Amin's frequent reorganizations,
 transfers, and purges suncc coming to
 power.
