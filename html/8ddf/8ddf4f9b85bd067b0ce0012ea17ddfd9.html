 Upgrading Science and Technology
 As part of its effort to modernize China's economy,
 Hua Kuo-feng's government has begun to take steps to
 upgrade basic research in two crucial areas--science
 and technology.
 Over the past few months, there have been numerous
 signs that China's leaders are concerned about the low
 priority given to these fields in recent years.  Many
 articles in the press, for instance, have attacked the
 "gang of four" for undermining work in science and tech-
 nology and have called for renewed attention to basic
 research in these fields.  Among the most recent were
 two front-page articles in People's Daily on March 9
 that attacked the "gang of four" for trying to.infiltrate
 the Academy of Sciences and use it as a base for promoting
 their political ambitions.  Now that the gang has been
 purged, they said, China's scientists should strive to
 6/           "consolidate" the Academy of Sciences and to promote
 #'-%         scientific research in order to "accomplish the modern-
 ization of science and technology by the end of the cen-
 tury."  This same theme is repeated in no less than four
 articles in the April issue of the Chinese Communist
 Party's theoretical journal, Red Flag.
 There have been other more concrete signs of the
 government's interest in basic research.   In January,
 Fang I, former minister for economic relations with
 foreign countries and an official with a long career in
 managing scientific and technological programs, was
 m  appointed vice president of the Chinese Academy of
 6D Sciences.   He was presumably given a mandate to overhaul
 the academy and to improve the quality of its research
 programs.   Since his appointment, the academy has held
 a number of professional conferences to promote scien-
 tific research.   In March, for instance, there were two
 scientific meetings in Peking--a conference on high
 energy physics and a forum of scientific and technological
 workers to discuss the principle of "letting a hundred
 schools of thought contend" in the field of science.

 The theme of this last conference suggests the
 importance that China's leaders attach to upgrading
 scientific and technological research.   "Letting a hun-
 dred schools of thought contend" is a Chinese codeword
 for allowing greater freedom of thought and more debate.
 It is possible that China's leaders realize that without
 at least a limited amount of discussion and more freedom
 to pursue research programs, China's science and tech-
 nology will continue to stagnate and the goal of develop-
 ing a modern, industrial economy will become more elusive.
 There is a pressing need for all of these measures.
 In spite of their importance to economic development,
 science and technology have received short shrift in
 China since the Cultural Revolution in the mid-1960s.
 Two nagging problems have resulted--a shortage of qual-
 ified personnel and a lack of sufficient expertise.
 During the Cultural Revolution, many senior researchers
 were purged.   Others, harried by political pressures,
 withdrew from their work.   Few were replaced, because
 65)    schools and universities, forced to deemphasize academic
 training and to curtail their graduate programs, were
 unable to turn out qualified younger scholars.   In as-
 tronomy,  for example,  it has been estimated that there
 are at most 30 graduate students in the entire country.
 The training of these few younger researchers, moreover,
 is often spotty and inadequate.   Over the past decade,
 they like their elders have often been obliged to neglect
 their studies and research in favor of participating in
 political campaigns or working in the countryside or in
 factories.
 The dangers of this situation have not been lost
 on some of China's leaders.  As long ago as 1972, both
 Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai allegedly became concerned
 about. the low priorit accorded to developing science
 and technology.
 D
 in 1975, Hua Kuo-
 feng and Teng Hsiao-ping took charge of an effort to
 upgrade basic research at the Academy of Sciences.   Both
 of these efforts, however, came to naught--allegedly
 because the "gang of four" opposed and sabotaged them.
 Now that the gang has been purged, China's new leaders,
 many of whom have expressed concern about the state of

 Waiting for Teng
 The failure of former vice premier Teng Hsiao-ping
 to return to public political life earlier this month,
 despite expectations and even predictions of Chinese
 officials that he would do so, suggests continuing contro-
 versy over the Teng issue among the few leaders currently
 on the depleted Politburo.  Although most accounts indi-
 cate that the major bone of contention is what position
 to give Teng, the heart of the issue seems to be the
 more fundamental question of how Teng's return will
 affect the distribution of power at the top and the per-
 sona]. political fortunes of certain leaders.
 Much speculation among Chinese and outsiders alike
 has focused on the impact of Teng's return on new party
 Chairman Hua Kuo-feng's status.  While the lesser known
 Hua may not be eager for Teng's rehabilitation, more
 recent indications are that he has adopted a neutral
 position above the current fray.  The more immediate
 m problem, and the one that probably accounts for the
 iY chancfing signals on the timing of Teng's reemergence,
 seems to be the often reported opposition of Politburo
 members Chen Hsi-lien, Wu Te, and Wang Tung-hsing.  All
 could have reason to fear that a Teng restored to
 official position would seek retribution against them
 based either on their earlier less-than-cordial relation-
 ship or their eagerness to jump on the anti-Teng band-
 wagon after his dismissal.   Rumors that the three are in

 varying degrees of political trouble have been making the
 rounds for some time,
 Of the three men, the case against Peking party
 boss Wu Te seems the weakest.  There is no evidence that
 Wu and Teng did not get along in the past.  The blackest
 mark against Wu seems to be his role in calling for an
 end to the riots in Peking last April that resulted in
 Teng's dismissal.   If the riots were a justified response
 to provocation from the now fallen leftists, which now

 seems to be the official explanation, then Wu's calling
 a halt to them could be'used against him by Teng's sup-
 porters.  Nevertheless, Wu allowed the riots to go on
 all day and ordered the crowds to disperse only after
 Q they had set fire to a building.   He did not, as charged,
 attack Teng by name in his speech to the rioters.   He
 was, however, the last senior official to call for con-
 tinuedcriticism of Teng, and that may make Wu himself
 sufficiently uneasy about Teng's return to try to resist
 it.
 Despite the role of the security forces under Wang
 Tung-hsing in arresting Teng's major opponents, the
 "gang of four," it is possible that Wang and Teng them-
 selves did not work well together.  Teng reportedly
 wanted to name his own man to head the party's General
 cp Office, a job that is held by Wang.  That in itself may
 be enough reason for Wang to oppose Teng's return.  Little
 is known of Wang's policy preferences, but because of his
 long personal association with Mao, he seems the least
 likely member of the Politburo to support Teng's right-
 ist policies.
 Chen Hsi-lien, commander of the Peking Military
 Region, probably is playing a key role in the discussions
 of Teng's fate, much as he did in January 1976 when his
 apparent abandonment of Teng possibly led other military
 men to turn their backs on him.  The military reportedly
 is not united on the Teng issue
 and Chen
 whom Teng may
 ,
 ,
 have wanted to replace as Peking Military Region commander,
 is a likely candidate to oppose Teng.   Chen was attacked
 in wallposters last January for opposing Teng, and rumors
 that he will be transferred out of Peking--and apparently
 lose his vice premiership as well--probably reflect a
 perception by many Chinese that Teng's return may not
 bode well for Chen.
 Just as rumors of Teng's imminent return began to
 be replaced by excuses for his delayed appearance, Chen,
 who had not been very active publicly, suddenly showed
 up twice in Peking, suggesting the "oppositionists" have
 won a temporary delay.  Chen's recent high visibility
 contrasts with that of his alleged civilian cohorts,
 ~Wu Te and Wang Tung-hsing. It is possible that a final
 resolution of the Teng question will involve some
 assurances to the more powerful Chen that he will not
 lose much, if any, ground.

 Despite Teng's failure to appear, most signs still

 brother continues to make public appearances, and media
 0      references to the "gang of four's" attacks on "a leading

 his return,  they have had no impact on personnel appoint-
 ments in the provinces, almost all of which seem to bene-
 fit Teng and those who support him.   Moreover, there is
 a strong feeling among the Chinese populace, but more
 importantly among Chinese officials, that the country
 needs Teng because no one can match his ability--and
 contacts--to get things done rapidly and efficiently.

 New Possibilities in South Asia
 China has reacted to the defeat of Indira Gandhi
 in last month's Indian election with public glee and
 private caution.   Peking is encouraged because the new
 Prime Minister, Morarji Desai,  has implied he will move
 to loosen India's special ties with the Soviet Union
 developed during Gandhi's tenure by pursuing a more
 evenhanded foreign policy.   Chinese officials, however,
 are also aware that the new Indian government is still
 fragile and heavily dependent upon the USSR--a dependency
 underscored by the Soviet foreign minister's forthcoming
 trip to Delhi.

 The Chinese attempted to take advantage of problems
 between India and the USSR.   Last summer, Peking broad-
 cast articles emphasizing the economic disadvantages of
 India's trade with the USSR.   In January, the Chinese
 used the occasion of the visit of a private Indian
 delegation to China to signal their interest in better
 relations.   Given China's recent record of attempts to
 demonstrate good will plus Desai's expressed desire for
 better relations with all of India's neighbors, the
 Chinese may now cautiously seek an opportunity to improve
 relations.

 Any real improvement in relations would necessarily
 raise the long-standing Sino-Indian border dispute.
 With Gandhi out of the picture, Peking may reason that
 this is the best opportunity since the 1962 border war
 to probe this question.   On January 11, a Chinese
 Foreign Ministry statement reiterated Peking's "stand
 of resolving boundary conflict through negotiations."
 An Indian official reacted favorably to the Chinese
 statement, but indicated that the important tactical
 question of which side would formally propose negotia-
 tions would have to be resolved.                                        Two forthcoming

 contacts between the Chinese and Indians may produce
 further signals.   Indian businessmen will go to the
 Canton spring fair and an exchange of journalist delega-
 tions will follow.   Peking may want to avoid explicitly
 proposing negotiations then, but there may be hints of a
 desire to get talks underway.
 At the same time, Peking may want to explore the
 attitudes of the new Indian leadership toward their
 bilateral disputes. Prime Minister Desai has taken a
 hard line on the border question in the past.   The
 Chinese will be interested in seeing how this squares
 with his call for improved relations with all countries.
 Another possible avenue of exploration for the
 Chinese is the Indo-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir.   The
 Chinese have supported the Pakistani line on Kashmir for
 9       years as part of their "tilt" toward Islamabad.   Peking
 recently voiced firm support for the people of Kashmir
 in "their just struggle for the right to national self-
 determination."   Given a stable,  less hostile, less pro-
 Soviet Indian government, China may choose to soft-pedal
 this line in the future.
 Peking's relationship with Islamabad would be
 affected by real progress with New Delhi.   Pakistan,
 China's long-time friend in South Asia,  served as China's
 fulcrum to gain leverage with a.hostile India.   The ups
 and downs of Chinese military and economic assistance
 to Pakistan have closely followed the course of China's
 policy toward India.   Peking nonetheless has reassured
 Islamabad that any improvement in relations with New
 Delhi would not be at Pakistan's expense.   Last year,  for
 example, as the Chinese moved toward normal relations
 with India, they increased their military deliveries to
 Pakistan.
 A high-level Chinese military delegation visited
 Pakistan last month, possibly to prepare a new military
 aid package for Pakistan.   It is unlikely that Islamabad
 will receive as much as it would like from the Chinese.
 Peking cannot provide the sophisticated equipment that

 assistance this year may coincidentally help to smooth
 the way for a Chinese attempt to improve relations with
 India.
 Better ties with India would also affect Bangladesh,
 where China has been consolidating its position since
 the fall of the pro-Indian, Soviet-aided regime in 1975.
 During strongman Zia ur-Rahman's visit to China earlier
 this year, Peking extended limited military and economic
 assistance to Dacca, including a squadron of MIG-19s.
 Chinese officials, however, have uttered only guarded
 support for Bangladeshi positions in bilateral disputes
 with India.   If Peking is satisfied with the results of
 the forthcoming Farakka barrage talks between India and
 Bangladesh over diversion of Ganges River water,  it may
 further reduce comments on Bangladeshi disputes with
 India.   It is unlikely, however, that the Chinese would
 reduce their present limited level of economic and military
 support to Bangladesh for fear that the Soviets would
 supplant them there.                                                      25X1

 Sabotage on China's Railways:   The Tip of the Iceberg?
 Despite the new regime's success in restoring po-
 litical order in China's faction-ridden provinces, there
 is reason to suspect that a great deal of sabotage, ar-
 son, murder, and other breaches of public security is
 currently disrupting the nation's railroad network.   This
 unrest: may in some instances be politically motivated
 and related to the campaign against local followers of
 the "gang of four."
 According to a national conference on railway work
 in late February,  "class enemies" are disrupting the
 O railways, despite the efforts of local party committees,
 public security departments, and railway personnel.  An-
 other conference on railway public security work spon-
 sored by the ministries of public security and railways
 also stressed the need for a greater public security
 effort: against railway saboteurs.
 mid-March operation of the railways in some areas was
 chaotic enough to warrant the intervention of local mil-
 itary units.   Most provinces have held provincial level
 railway conferences, but only a few
 have admitted having current
 public security problems.
 (roving bands of "criminal gangs and other
 scoundrels" are creating havoc along the provincial
 railway network.   Anhwei Province has been politically
 stable for the past 10 years, but has been run by a man
 who harshly criticized Teng Hsiao-ping last year and
 who may be closely associated with the "gang of four."
 It is possible, therefore, that Anhwei's railway sabo-
 teurs are rightists who are trying to defy the province's
 leftist leadership.   It is more likely, however, that
 they are low-level leftists who have been suppressed by
 Anhwei's leaders to convince Peking of their loyalty.

 Although there have been no reports directly link-
 ing railway saboteurs to local leftists who may have
 fled after the fall of the "gang of four" in order to
 avoid incarceration, the case of Anhwei Province sug-
 gests that perhaps some leftists did arm themselves and
 go underground.   This would account for the sudden in-
 stability in a formerly quiet province--an instability
 brought on by a crackdown ordered by the regime on low-
 level followers of the "gang of four."
 If this is the case, the campaign to root out fol-
 lowers of                                    an  of four" may be encountering more
 resistance                                                  Leftist-
 generated sabotage of the nation's railways not only
 poses public security problems, but could have serious
 economic effects--as it did last year--on China's sagging
 economy.
