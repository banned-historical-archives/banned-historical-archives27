ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN COMMUNIST CHINA  
UNDER THE FIRST AND SECOND FIVE YEAR PLANS* 
1953-62. 
Summary and Conclusions  
Communist China made substantial economic progress during the period 
of the First Five Year Plan (1953-57). Total output of goods and serv-
ices (gross national product -- GNP) increased at an average annual rate 
of about 7 to 8 percent, which may be compared favorably with recent rates 
of growth of a little more than 3 percent in India, 8 percent in Japan, 
and 7 percent in the USSR. The rate of growth was quite uneven during the 
period, however, varying from 4 to 5 percent in 1954 to 12 to 13 percent in 
1956 and revealing the extent to which economic activity in Communist China 
is geared to the results of the previous year's harvest. Total output on a 
per capita basis increased at an average annual rate of 5 to 6 percent, with 
nearly half of the additional output channeled into investment or government 
purchases of goods and services. .As a result, per 'capita consumption rose 
more slowly, averaging 3 to 4 percent a year. As probably more than 60 per-
cent of this increase in consumption went to urban inhabitants, per capita , 
consumption of the peasant population, which constitutes more thar.1 80,percent 
of the total population, probably showed little improvement. 
During the First Five Year Plan the major accomplishment in the'agri-
cultural sector was the nearly complete collectivization of China's peas-
ants, far ahead of original plans. The number of peasant households which 
have not yet joined cooperative farms, 3 percent of the total, is expected 
to decrease rapidly as a result of recently imposed restrictions on private 
peasants. For all practical purposes the basic unit for control of agri-
cultural production during the Second Five Year Plan (1958-62) will be the 
collective farm. 
Agricultural production during the First Five Year Plan generally was. 
adequate to meet the basic needs of the populationand the economy, but 
few targets for increased production in this sector actually were achieved. 
Crop.losses from natural calamities in 1954 and 1956, disruption and con:-
fusion-from rapid socialization; and shortages of equipment, draft animals, 
and fertilizers combined to prevent targets from being met. The apparent 
fulfillment of the goals for increased production of food grains and cotton'

is believed to have been due in part to statistical understatements in 
1952 and 1953 when the National Statistical Bureau was in process of 
organization. To the extent that this bias in statistical reporting 
influences current agricultural planning, it leads to the setting of 
optimistic targets in the Second Five Year Plan. 
In contrast with an average annual increase in agricultural pro-
duction of only 3 percent during the First Five Year Plan, industrial 
output achieved the high average annual growth rate of more than 16 per-
cent, and production targets on the whole were significantly overfulr, 
filled. During the 5-year period, finished steel production more than 
tripled and the output of such other basic raw materials as coal, elec-
tric power, and cement doubled. An even more notable achievement was 
the rapid development of the machine building industry to a point where 
Communist China can now produce large-scale precision machine tools, 
simple mining and metallurgical processing equipment, power station equip-
ment for medium-size plants, motor trucks, aircraft, and large locomotives. 
In fact, the machine building industry expanded at such a rapid pace that 
by 1957 it had outstripped fuel and raw material production, resulting in 
production cutbacks and uriderutilization of capacity in many branches of 
the industry. Light industry progressed much more slowly than heavy in-
dustry during the First Five Year Plan, in large part because of shortages 
of agricultural raw materials. 
The impressive record of economic development during the First Five 
Year Plan demonstrates the ability of Communist China to restrict con-
sumption and mobilize resources for investment. The high level of in-
vestment, averaging each year about 17 percent of GNP for the 5-year 
period, enabled the regime to overfulfill the capital construction plan 
by about 14 percent in spite of the concern evinced in early 1957 that 
the program was endangered by "strains, stresses, and imbalances." 
Approximately 56 percent of investment was allocated to the industrial 
sector, within which heavy industry received overwhelming priority, 
accounting for nearly 89 percent of total industrial investment. State 
investment in agriculture was held to a minimum in spite of the fact 
that more than half of total investment funds originate in this sector. 
Foreign trade, which in total turnover was equivalent to about-10 per-
cent of GNP, was a significant factor in the economic progress of Communist 
China during the First Five Year Plan. Approximately 15 percent of total 
investment in capital construction consisted of imports of vital machinery 
and equipment, nearly all of which originated in Bloc countries and which 
together accounted for 78 percent of total trade. Soviet credits made 
only a minor contribution to the economic development of China, because most 
of these credits were military in nature. Soviet technical assistance, how-
ever, was of considerable importance to the industrialization program. In,
to assisting in major industrial construction projects, Soviet

advisers and technicians worked with virtually every ministry in the 
government and with individual enterprises. As a result of steadily. 
mounting foreign debt charges and payments under Communist China's own 
foreign aid program, the regime was confronted with a shortage in foreign 
exchange at the close of the First Five Year Plan period. 
It is estimated that total output of goods and services will increase 
about as rapidly during the Second Five Year Plan as in the First Five 
Year Plan. Estimates of.GNP show that, in general, sufficient funds will 
be available to finance the investment which, would be required to achieve 
projected increases in production during the Second Five Year Plan. This 
achievement will entail a relative increase in the share of total output 
allocated to investment but at the same time will also permit some im-
provement in per capita consumption. As an indication of continued prog-
ress toward Communist China's major goal of industrialization, it is esti-
mated that the industrial sector will contribute nearly 26 percent of 
.gross national income in 1962 compared with 20 percent in 1957 and only 
13 percent in 1952. Industrial output will increase at a somewhat slower 
rate (91 percent) during.the Second Five Year Plan than during the First 
Five Year Plan (109 percent), in large part because of increasing reli-
ance on new capacity to achieve increases in production. On the other 
hand, agricultural output during the Second Five Year Plan is expected 
to increase at a faster rate (17 percent compared with 13 percent in the 
First Five Year Plan) in keeping with the new emphasis on agricultural 
development in Communist China's economic planning. 
Recent speeches by Chinese Communist leaders indicate their deter-
mination to reach a solution of the agricultural problem. Their 
announced plans call fora significantly higher investment in agricul-
ture than during the First Five Year Plan. Assuming no serious diffi-
culties with peasant morale and attitudes, the production of basic food 
crops is expected to increase by approximately 16 percent in 1962 above 
1957. An increase in population of 13 percent which is expected during. 
the same period should allow a slight increase in per capita consumption 
by 1962 compared with 1957. Production of -industrial crops should be 
sufficient to maintain current consumption levels of consumer goods made 
from agricultural raw materials. With increased incentives to farmers, 
including measures recently inaugurated, the number of livestock should 
increase appreciably. 
The Second Five Year Plan, as announced, contains no provision for 
new long-term credits from the USSR. Under the plan, Communist China 
will have to finance through exports the, imports required for industri-
alization as well as to repay Soviet credits advanced during the First 
Five Year Plan (estimated to be 3.1 billion yuan). With their present 
capabilities the Chinese Communists probably do not need further Soviet 
credits to carry out their planned industrial development. In the event

of'serious economic difficulties, however, the Chinese might seek and 
obtain some assistance on credit from the USSR. 
Successful completion of the Second Five Year Plan will depend on 
the degree of flexibility and realism with which the regime approaches 
certain perennial problems of economic development in China. The basic 
problem confronting any government is the unrelenting pressure of popu-
lation on food supply. The impressive gains in industrial and agricul-
tural output to date have been accompanied by an accelerated rate of 
growth in population, from about 1 to 1.5 percent per year in the period 
from 1950 to 1952 to an estimated 2.4 percent in 1957. The average annual 
rate of growth in agricultural output during the First Five Year Plan, 
about 3 percent, provided only a small margin above the average growth in 
population of about 2 percent. That the Chinese Communists are aware of 
the gravity of their Malthusian problem is illustrated by the current 
birth control campaign and by the all-out effort to expand agricultural 
production. 
The Chinese Communists are promoting an extensive campaign to en-
courage birth control and to make large families economically unattrac-
tive. The new policy on population, however, is not expected to do much 
more than level off the annual rate of growth at about 2.4 percent, so 
that the estimated population will be about 710 million in 1962 and 799 
million by 1967. The estimated increase in population of 13 percent 
-during the Second Five Year Plan will continue to press heavily on the 
supply of food and consumer goods. 
The Chinese Communists also have evidenced awareness of their growing 
employment problem. The goal of mechanizing industry as rapidly as pos-
sible has been replaced by plans to use more investment funds on projects 
which offer maximum employment. Job opportunities arising from this pro-
gram, however, are limited, and it is probable that nearly half of the 
increase in the labor force during the Second Five Year Plan will have to 
find employment in agriculture. In addition, various steps have been 
taken to stiffen the policy preventing peasant migration into the cities 
and even to transfer large numbers of present urban residents back to the 
countryside. These developments will tend to depress further the low per 
capita income of the rural population but will not materially increase 
agricultural output, because rural labor is already abundant. 
The Chinese Communists have demonstrated their ability to mount a 
program of rapid industrialization. A continuing allocation of 15 to 
20 percent of output to investment -- and an allocation of half of this 
to investment in heavy industry -- is feasible because of the growing 
capacity of the economy for production of producer goods and because of 
the ample supply of labor for construction. The productive capability 
of China in investment goods, however, contrasts sharply with its capa-
bility in agriculture. As noted above, there is a rather narrow margin

between the rate of growth in population and the rate of growth in agri-
cultural output. The rapid rate of growth in population poses not only 
a problem of food supply but also a problem of maintaining full employ-
ment with equitable income distribution. 
It is impossible to forecast whether or not Communist China's agri-
cultural policies will lead to serious difficulties. Some of these 
policies, however, should be described as risky, in that the regime, hav-
ing socialized the agricultural population, cannot afford not to achieve 
increases in agricultural production. Investment allocation for in-
creasing agricultural output appears to be adequate in the period of the 
Second Five Year. Plan. The risk, then, results from the low incomes and 
incentives for peasants. The Chinese are following the Soviet example 
in collectivization and in financing investment by forced savings which 
are extorted primarily from the agricultural population. They are doing 
so without the margin of diet and production of surplus food that the 
USSR had and in the face of a rapid and possibly accelerating growth in 
population. 
Should insufficient peasant incentives have an adverse effect on 
agricultural production, the Chinese Communists could, of course, 
modify their program so as to alleviate the most pressing difficulties. 
Peasant incomes could be raised and urban incomes reduced while invest-
ment would be left intact, a situation which in practice probably would 
be both administratively and politically difficult. If the supply of 
agricultural products becomes critically low, the shortages could be 
relieved by foreign trade, in that agricultural exports could be reduced 
or agricultural imports increased. This expedient, however, would be At 
the expense of imports of investment goods. Alternatively, some reduc-
tion of the planned level of investment could be made, as was the case 
in 1957. Another measure which is open to the Chinese Communists is an 
increase in the imports of chemical fertilizers. Such imports probably 
would pay for themselves through expanded agricultural production, per-
mitting an increase both in agricultural exports and in domestic food 
supply.

I. Performance Under the First Five Year Plan (1953-57). 
A. Economic Planning and Administration. 
Although the Chinese Communist First Five Year Plan (1953757) 
was drawn up to cover the period from 1953 through 1957, the plan was 
published only at the midpoint of the period in July 1955. IP ,During 
the first half of the period the regime operated under annual plans and 
at the same time attempted to complete its institutional organization 
for administration of both annual and long-term plans. A number of 
serious faults were revealed in the statistical system which still re-
main to handicap present and future planning. The first complete enu-
meratiOn of population was carried out' in 1953-54 and revealed a total 
population of about 100 million in excess of previous estimates. _V In 
the process of the population census and of the subsequent collectiviza-
tion of agriculture in 1955-56, additions were made to the statistics on 
cultivated area and crop production which resulted from improved statis-
tical coverage. The official statistical reports on increases in culti-
vated area and crop production achieved during the course of the First 
Five Year Plan thus show a bias (because of statistical understatement 
in the base year of 1952) which may influence the future estimates of 
possible results to be realized from investment in agriculture. This 
bias also may affect the long-range planning of budgetary receipts and 
Investment which are based largely on national income to be derived from 
production and processingof agricultural products. 
* 
? 
At first, economic planning was modeled closely on Soviet expe-
rience, in spite of the widely different conditions in China of heavy 
population pressure on the land and low per capita productivity. Because 
of an increased awareness of the special characteristics of China's popu-
lation-resource base, however, the regime altered its approach to a number 
of economic problems during the course of the First Five Year Plan, espe-
cially the interrelated problems of population, employment, and investment. 
The shift was from one of Soviet and Marxist emphasis on the advantages 
of a large population and a capital-intensive investment program to one 
of seeking to impose limitations on population growth, additional stress 
on labor-intensive investment projects, numerically large shifts of popu-
lation from urban areas to marginal agricultural areas, and deemphasis of 
mechanization of agriculture. 
In spite of the defects in Communist China's planning for economic 
development, the regime has achieved remarkable success in its main ob-
jectives of heavy industrialization, socialization of both agriculture and.

The degree of success which had been achieved in the First Five Year Plan 
was the basis for strong expressions of optimism on the part of the Chair-
man of the National Economic Commission in his report to the National 
Peoples Congress in early February 1958. 1/ Although credit was given 
to the USSR and "other fraternal countries" for the "enormous assistance" 
given during the First Five Year Plan, it was assumed that the Chinese 
Communist leaders could proceed under the 1958 annual plan and the Second 
Five Year Plan to manage the increasing complexity of centrally controlled 
planning, production, and allocation of resources with less Soviet aid 
than in the First Five Year Plan. 
B. Trends in Output. 
Communist China made substantial economic progress during the 
period of the First Five Year Plan. Total output of goods and services 
(GNP) increased at an average annual rate of about 7 to 8 percent, a fig-
ure which compares favorably with recent rates of growth of a little more 
than 3 percent in India, 8 percent in Japan, and 7 percent in the USSR. 
GNP, valued in constant 1956 market prices, rose from about -78 billion yuan 
in 1952 to about 111 billion yuan in 1957.** Growth was quite uneven dur-
ing the period, however, varying from 4 to 5 percent in 1954 to 12 to 13 
percent in 1956 and revealing the extent to which economic activity in 
Communist China is geared to the results of the ,previous year's harvest. 
Total output on a per capita basis increased at an average annual rate of 
5 to 6 percent, with nearly half of the additional output channeled into 
investment or government purchases of goods and services. As a result, 
per capita consumption rose more slowly, averaging 3 to 4 percent a year. 
As probably more than 60 percent of this increase in consumption went to 
urban inhabitants, per. capita consumption of the peasants, who constitute 
more than 80 percent of the population, probably showed little improvement. 
The impressive record of economic development during the First 
Five Year Plan demonstrates Communist China's ability to restrict consump-
tion and mobilize resources for investment. To achieve this rate of growth, 
total investment per year averaged about 17 percent of GNP for the 5-year 
period, a proportion roughly comparable to that achieved in recent years 
in the US.*** During the plan period the share of GNP contributed by the

industrial-sector Tose from 13-percent,in -1952 to--nearly 2O percent-in- - 
1957, revealing a rapid rate of progress toward Communist China's major 
goal of industrialization. As agricultural output increased at an aver-
age annual rate of less than 3 percent, its relative share of GNP de-
creased from 58 percent in 1952 to 47 percent in the last year of the 
-First Five Year Plan.* 
C. 'Agricultural Socialization and Production. 
1 1. Socialization. 
1 
The original goals for the socialization of agriculture 
called for the incorporation of one-third of all peasant households in 
semisocialist agricultural producer cooperatives by 1957 and for a 
majority in the principal agricultural areas to be organized in such 
cooperatives by 1962. This step would complete preparation for the 
transition into fully socialist cooperatives -- collective farms -- dur-
ing the Third Five Year Plan (1963-67): On publicizing these goals in 
mid-1955, however, Mao Tse-tung called for a daring program of rapid 
socialization which quickly swept millions of peasants into producer' 
cooperatives. IV A bumper harvest in 1955 encouraged the regime in its 
belief that cooperativization resulted in greater production, andprom-
ises of higher income werepersuasive influences in collectivizing the 
peasants. Atter reaching -a high of 1.9 million Cooperatives in late 
1955, consolidation and transformation into collective farms took place 
at an increasing rate. By July 1957, 97 percent of all peasant house-
holds were members of about 750,000 agricultural cooperatives, including 
93 percent in 680,000 collective farms. 2/ A State Council directive of 
21 December 1957 placed even the few remaining private peasants under 
a comprehensive system of controls to be implemented by neighboring 
Collective farms. ?,j Agricultural socialization thus was practically 
completed. 
On entering collective farms, peasants lost the remaining 
benefits from ownership of land, livestock, fruit trees, and implements 
which had played a part in determining their share of total income in 
the lower forms of agricultural cooperatives. Promised remuneration for 
these compulsory contributions is still forthcoming in most instances, 
and the delay and uncertainty are sources of dissatisfaction, especially 
among those who contributed the most to the collectives -- the upper 
middle class peasants. 
* For estimates of GNP by sector of origin, for the years 1952-57, see

Certain advantages should accrue to the state from agricul-
tural socialization, such as tighter political control over the peasants, 
increased efficiency in the mobilization of labor for reclamation and 
water conservancy work, and closer control over the production, procure-
ment, and distribution of agricultural commodities. Although some of 
these benefits have been realized, peasant disenchantment with socializa-
tion has made itself felt in many ways. 
In the winter of 1955-56, exorbitant demands on off-season 
peasant labor were made for the construction of irrigation facilities. 
As a result, many peasants lost their usual income from sideline activi-
ties, with harmful effects on purchasing power and morale. This practice 
has since been modified. In 1956, natural calamities in some areas fur-
ther aggravated the peasants' economic situation, leading to underfulfill-
ment of the state's grain procurement plan. Although sales of domestic 
grain were 6.5 million metric tons* greater than in 1955, grain procure-
ment was 1.5 million tons less, and the resulting deficit had to be met 
from state grain reserves. V Peasant resistance to grain procurement, 
in many cases supported by sympathetic cadres, was achieved by various 
methods, among them the following: reports of crop failure were falsi-
fied, standard yields were based on the least productive fields, measures 
and scales were altered, and grains were not completely threshed. 
In the winter of 1956-57 a substantial number of peasants, 
primarily of the upper middle class, withdrew from collective farms. In 
Kwangtung Province alone, more than 100,000 households dropped out of 
collective farm. 18./ Many subsequently returned, but throughout China - 
an increasing influx of peasants into cities, where unemployment is al-
ready a critical problem, has created a serious drain on urban food 
supplies. Strong measures have been taken to force these dissatisfied 
peasants to return home, but the problem still exists. The reasons for 
leaving cooperatives include the unfavorable comparison between the wages 
of workers and those of socialized peasants, the low returns to members 
of cooperatives compared with those to the few remaining private well-
to-do peasants, the assertion of authority by poorly trained cadres, and 
the restrictions on the exercise of former sideline pursuits, especially 
trading. 
Another result of collectivization has been a serious decline 
in the number of hogs and draft animals arising from lack of personal 
care, 'inadequate fodder, and low procurement prices. Measures taken to 
strengthen incentives to increase the number of livestock have been only 
partially successful. These measures include increases in procurement 
prices for livestock and livestock products, increases in the size of 
private plots (up to 10 percent of total cooperative land) to promote

production of fodder, and assignment of livestock to individuals for 
raising and use. The number of draft animals, which provide nearly all 
draft power on China's farms, had decreased by 4 percent in late 1957 
compared with mid-1956. 2/ 
2. Production. 
a "The expansion of agriculture is a basic condition for en-
suring the development of our industry and fulfillment of Our economic 
plan as a whole. ... It is agriculture that provides conditions for the 
growth of industry." These statements, appearing in the text of the First 
Five Year Plan, 12/ illustrate the extreme importance attributed to the 
role of agricultural production in the, development of the Chinese Commu-
nist economy. Although the plan stressed the importance of raising output 
of grain and cotton crops, it also called for significant increases in - 
all types of. agricultural, production. - 
In general, attempts to reach the original targets planned 
for 1957 were successful, particularly those for total grains and cotton. 
Production of soybeans, sugar cane, and sugar beets, however, fell short 
of planned goals.* As production in 1952 probably was higher than that 
on which the Chinese based their Five Year Plan goals, successes in meet-
ing specific production goals in 1957 are correspondingly less spectacular 
and failures all the more serious. 
To achieve the planned goals, major efforts were put forth to 
increase the area under irrigation and multiple cropping and to increase 
the availability of chemical and organic fertilizers. It is estimated that 
production of grain actually increased about 17 million tons during the 
First Five Year Plan. Approximately 45 percent of this increase resulted 
from expanding the area under irrigation and multiple cropping; about 4o per-
cent, from increased availability of fertilizers; and the remainder from such 
measures as the reclamation of waste land; the use of improved seeds, imple-
ments, and pesticides; and the application of improved methods of cultivation. 
Official statistics on production of grain for the past 4 years 
(1954-57) are generally reasonable in the light of known weather conditions, 
expenditures or improvements and fertilizers, and general conditions in the 
countryside. There is a possibility tha;b 1956 agricultural production was 
overstated. One reason for this conclusion is that only a modest increase 
? of 2.5 million tons was claimed for 1957 above 1956 in spite of much better 
weather. Statistics for 1952 and 1953, however, are believed to have been 
understated considerably because of inadequate reporting and have been re-
vised in the estimates presented in this report. Several types-of evidence 
support this revision. 
* For the estimated production of selected agricultural commodities for 
the years 1952-62, see Table 5, Appendix A, p. 49, below.

The main source of official statistics in Communist China, 
the State Statistical Bureau, was not established until the eve of the 
First Five Year Plan, in late 1952. One of its first major tasks was to 
take the population census of 1953, which revealed about 100 million 
people more than had been accounted for in the official statistics before 
that time. As this fact reflects the poor condition of Chinese statistics 
before the First Five Year Plan, it is highly unlikely that an accurate 
estimate of cultivated and sown area was available at that time. In fact, 
In 1952, the authorities admitted that 11 million hectares of registered 
taxable land had already been discovered as a result of expanded survey 
coverage between 1950 and 1952. 
In mid-1955, when the goals for the First Five Year Plan were 
first published, the 1957 goal for sown acreage was 151.6 million hectares. 
When the final figures for 1955 were published in 1956, sown acreage had 
already reached 151.1 million hectares, 11/ indicating that the statistics 
for the base year of 1952, on which the 1957 goal was based, had been 
understated. The 1957 goal was later revised to 160 million hectares, a 
reasonable figure in light of both the existing sown acreage and the.con-
tinued efforts to expand crop cultivation. 
The considerable increases of about 6 million hectares of sown 
area and 21 million tons of grain claimed for the 3 years from 1952 to 
1955 are not believed to have been possible. Increases in production 
which could have resulted from increased irrigation facilities and other 
improvements as well as increased supplies of agricultural chemicals, espe-
cially fertilizer, fall far short of Chinese Communist claims of increases 
for that period. Weather is not a factor, for both 1952 and 1955 were 
'excellent crop years, well above average. These considerations support 
the conclusion that statistical understatement, because of/inadequate 
coverage in the base year, was responsible for a substantial proportion 
of the claimed increases in production.* The year 1955, considered to be 
an "average calamity year" and well covered statistically, is therefore 
selected as the base year from which to project estimates for the Second 
Five Year Plan and to adjust the data for 1952 and 1953. Trends using 
these revised data are considered to be feasible and acceptable. 
Food requirements of China's rapidly expanding population have 
necessitated a continuous expansion of area sown to food crops, especially 
grains. During the First Five Year Plan, however, the area under indus-
trial crops increased even more rapidly. From 1953 to 1956 the percentage 
of the total sown area in industrial crops rose from 8.1 percent to 9.2 
percent, but that of grain crops dropped from 79.3 percent to 78.1 percent 
* Confirmation of this conclusion is provided by a recent Chinese Commu-
nist admission that nearly half of the claimed increase in cultivated area 
during the First Five Year Plan resulted from improved statistical cover.,

and that of soybeans from 8.6 percent to 7.6 percent. In 1957 the per-
centage of the total sown area in grain crops further decreased to 77.1 
percent. 1.3./ 
Although official concern has been great, planned increases 
in livestock have not been realized, including the target for the First 
Five Year Plari, The number of hogs, for example -- despite a consider-
able increase from a low of 84 million in 1956 to 114 million in mid-
1957 -- still fell short of the 1957 target of 138 million.-112/ 
D. Industrial Socialization and Production. 
? 1. Socialization and Management. 
By the end of 1956 the socialization of industry had virtually 
eliminated all private industrial enterprises in Communist China. The con-
version of most of the private industrial sector in 1956 into joint state-
private enterprises, a transition stage preliminary to exclusive state 
ownership, was a device which enabled the regime to exercise effective con-
trols over the activities of these enterprises and at the same time retain 
the services of the former private managers and technicians. Payment of 
liquidation dividends at a flat rate of 5 percent to the former capitalist 
owners was originally planned to continue at least until 1962, but there 
has been recent Party agitation to abolish this form of "exploitation" 
within a period of 2 to 3 years: 22/ 
The general growth and expansion of the industrial base dur-
ing the First Five Year Plan have been accompanied by Chinese Communist 
measures directed at increasing Party control over all industrial enter-
prises. Party control over management in industrial enterprises has been 
expanded by strengthening the "collective leadership" of the Party committee 
over the individual plant managers, and control over the workers has been 
similarly expanded by the establishment of workers' congresses in place 
of the unpopular trade union conferences. These workers' congresses, which 
also function under the leadership of the Party committee, are supposed to 
have certain supervisory powers over the plant manager, thus further limit-
ing the authority of managerial personnel in industrial enterprises. 
If the isolated'complaints made in the past year by non-Party 
managerial personnel and former capitalist groups are indicative of the 
general situation in Chinese industrial enterprises, the economic waste 
generated by unskilled or ignorant Party representatives at the individual 
enterprise level must be substantial. It is hardly probable that the re-
cent increase of Party influence in enterprises will alleviate the dis-
satisfaction and unrest manifested by the workers and noted in Mao's 
"contradictions" speech in 1957. 1//

2. Production. 
During the First Five Year Plan, Communist China made con-
siderable progress in laying the foundations for industrialization. The 
gross value of modern industrial output (excluding handicrafts) increased 
about 133 percent during the plan, with heavy industry increasing more 
than 200 percent and light industry about 85 percent. 1?./ Although the 
average annual rate of growth of industrial output during the period was 
high (about 16 percent), it was uneven, having been reduced to about7 per-
cent in 1957, which was a year of consolidation and restoration of balance 
after the relatively overambitious construction of 1956. The share of GNP 
originating in industry rose rapidly, and the proportion of gross industrial 
output originating in the state, joint state-private, and cooperative sec-
tors of the economy increased from about 49 percent in 1952 to about 71 per-
cent in. 1955 and to more than. 99 percent in 1957. In spite of notable ad-
vances in industrialization, China still. lags behind Japan and far behind 
other advanced industrial nations in per capita and total production of 
most industrial goods..* Riding the wave of success developed in the course 
of the First Five Year Plan, Communist China has recently announced its 
intention of surpassing Great Britain's output of most producer goods by 
1972, including iron and steel, electric power, coal, cement, and chemical 
fertilizer. 
Production targets in the First Five Year Plan were, on the 
whole, significantly overfulfilled: production of producer goods in 1957 
was about 34 percent above the plan goal, production of consumer goods 
4 percent above the plan goal, and handicraft production 6 percent above 
the plan goal. Crude oil, edible vegetable oil, sugar, cigarettes, and 
cotton cloth (excluding homespun) constitute the major commodities which 
underfulfilled plan targets.** The degree of overfulfillment of produc-
tion targets varied greatly, however, so that critical imbalances between 
industrial sectors and between related industries were developed in 1956 
and 1957. Heavy industrial development was given special emphasis during 
the plan period, and high average annual rates of increase in production 
were achieved, as shown in Table 1,*** which compares the average annual 
rates of increase in output of selected heavy and light industrial products 
during 1953-57. 
By far the most notable achievement of the 5-year period was 
the establishment of the basis for further industrialization in the machine 
-*. A comparison of Communist China's GNP and production of selected com-
modities with those of various industrial nations is shown on the chart, 
Figure 3, following p. 14. 
** For goals of the First Five Year Plan and estimated output of selected 
industrial products for the years 1952-62, see Table 6, Appendix Al p. 50,

building industries. Whereas China was formerly heavily dependent on 
foreign prpducers for almost all Machinery as well as for many of the raw 
materials required by the machine industry, it is now claimed -- and 
reasonably so -- that the machine building industry can satisfy between 
70 and 80 percent of machinery requirements under the Second Five Year 
Plan. 121/ Although still dependent on imports for certain components, 
China now is able to produce large-scale precision machine tools, simple 
mining and metallurgical processing equipment, power-station equipment 
for medium-size plants, motor trucks, aircraft, and large locomotives. 
The naval and civil Shipbuilding industries, the electronics industry, and 
related ferrous and nonferrous metallurgical industries also have achieved 
considerable development. Much of the recent advance has involved imita-
tion of Russian designs, but China has begun to design some types of new 
equipment independently. The extra-rapid development of machine industries 
in relation to other industries and services created imbalances in product 
demand and raw material availability which led in 1957 to production cut-
backs and underutilization of capacity in such machine building indus-
tries as those producing trucks, locomotives, freight cars, agricultural 
machinery, and textile machinery. This capacity will be utilized exten-
sively in meeting the targets of the Second Five Year Plan (1958-62). 
The iron and steel industry has so developed that in 1957, it 
was Claimed, 88 percent of rolled steel requirements would be met by 
domestic production, compared with 61 percent in 1952. 22/ The signifi-
cant increases in production still have not eliminated many of the basic 
problems in the iron and steel industry, including concentration of a

large share of production at An-shan, inadequate development of ore 
mining and dressing facilities, and the inability to supply the increas-
ing variety of steels revired by the advancing technological level of 
Chinese industry. These continuing problems are being met to a degree 
by construction now under way, or planned, of integrated plants at 
Pao-t'ou and Wuhan and of about 25 small and medium-size plants advan-
tageously located throughout the country near the ore deposits and local 
consumption centers. China has become self-sufficient in most nonferrous 
metals (with the notable exceptions of copper, chromium, and nickel). 
Two significant aspects of production of nonferrous minerals have been 
the increase in exports of nonferrous metals and the rapid development 
of the aluminum industry, which presently meets domestic metal demands. 
Further development of metals and minerals for export .is planned, but ex-
pansion of production of copper, presently inadevate, probably will re-
main the most important item in the plan for the development of nonferrous 
metals. 
Although production in the chemical industry increased about 
three times during the First Five Year Plan, the industry still is far 
from meeting the needs of agriculture and other industries in either 
volume or variety of products. Development of the chemical industry dur-
ing the Second Five Year Plan appears, however, to have the highest 
priority. As an integral part of the drive to solve China's pressing 
agricultural production problem, the chemical fertilizer industry is to ' 
be developed as fast as possible, and, to aid the tense situation in the 
supply of cotton cloth, the synthetic fiber industry is also to be en-
couraged. 
Starting from a very low base, production of crude oil 
achieved the impressive growth rate of 230 percent during the plan period. 21/ 
Development of existing and new producing fields and construction of new 
processing and transport facilities during the plan period have laid the 
groundwork for future large increases in production. Demand for petroleum 
products is increasing rapidly, however, and China still will be dependent 
on imports to a marked degree during the next 5 years. Shortage of petro-
leum products probably has retarded the growth of some sectors of-the 
economy. 
Production of coal, which almost doubled during the First 
Five Year Plan, generally has kept pace with industrial and power re-
quirements, but unanticipated urban and rural household demand brought 
on a coal shortage in 1956 and 1957. Increased emphasis on small and 
medium-size workings should help to meet the growing demand for household 
use. Recent steps to help solve another problem, the poor quality of 
coal produced, include an accelerated program for construction of coal 
washing and processing units.

As shown in Table 1,* light industry progressed much more 
slowly than heavy industry during the First Five Year Plan. Growth of 
China's light industrial sector is, of course, limited by the inadequate 
supply of agricultural raw materials. Most of the increases in produc-
tion by light industry during the Five Year Plan have come from a greater 
utilization of existing facilities. Although the cotton textile industry 
has developed additional capacity, shortages of raw materials have led, 
to considerable underutilization of capacity during the last 3 years. 
The relatively small rate of growth of consumer goods indus-
tries probably should be further depressed because of an upward statis-
tical bias created espeFially in this sector by socialization and the 
concomitant increased ability of the regime to account for production at 
the local level. The meat-slaughtering industry is mentioned as a case 
in point. In 1952, only 10 percent of this industry was controlled by 
the government and was reported as light industrial output in the modern 
sector, but the corresponding figure in 1955 was nearly 70 percent. Al-
though the index of total meat slaughtered, with 1952 as 100, increased 
to only 129 by 1957, the index of industrially-slaughtered meat (that 
done by the state) rose to 1,146. This falsely inflated the growth of 
the light industrial sector. With slaughtering deleted from the produc-
tion tabulation, the 1957 index for modern light industry would be re-
duced from 185 to 172 (1952 = 100). 
In spite of the heavy priority assigned to the development of 
modern, mechanized industry during the First Five Year Plan, handicraft 
in 1957 still eemprtsed about 16 percent of total industrial output com-
pared with about 21 percent in 1952. 2/ The handicraft industry accounted 
for the following significant proportions of the production of major con-
sumer goods in 1956: salt, 22 percent; sugar, 36 percent; edible oils, 
27 percent; and cotton cloth (including homespun), 22 percent. Handicraft 
production of producer goods, largely simple farm tools and other ironware, 
also increased at a rapid rate (about 126 percent) over the plan period. 
Regional dispersion of industry, motivated by both strategic 
and economic considerations, is a long-range goal of the Chinese Communists. 
There was, however, an even greater concentration of industrial production 
in the old industrial areas during the First Five Year Plan. This concen-
tration resulted not only from the reconstruction of the existing industrial 
plant but also from the location of new industry in these areas which pro-
vided known sources of raw materials and fuel and developed transportation 
facilities and a reservoir of skilled labor. More than 80 percent of total 
investment in China's iron and steel industry was allocated to Northeast 
China during the plan period, and half of the 156 key industrial projects 
receiving Soviet aid are located in this one region. 2,1/

3. Transportation. 
The transport sector of Communist China has supported the rapid 
advance in economic development and, except for local dislocations, has 
kept pace with the general industrial growth of the economy. The transpor-
tation system has been utilized at close to capacity, and all branches of 
the sector have experienced high annual growth rates.* The railroads, with 
their high percentage of the traffic load, have been primarily responsible 
for the support of the industrial sector,** but the other types of carriers 
are increasing their proportionate share of the load as shown in the follow-
ing tabulation of percentages of total freight ton-kilometers borne by each 
type of carrier for 1950, 1956, and planned for 1962:

The absolute amounts derived from the percentages given for the modern 
means of transport and cart transport check closely with official Chinese 
Communist announcements of transport achievement. The estimate for  in-
land transport by junks is the first provided for 50X1 
this sector. This series points up the important part native transport, 
in the form of native ships and carts and pack animals, plays in short-
haul local movement of goods. Native transport in 1956 carried more than 
50 percent of the total tabulated freight tonnage, although it accounted 
for less than 5 percent of the total tabulated ton-kilometers. 
E. Foreign Trade and Economic Relations. 
-Foreign trade turnover of Communist China was equivalent to 
approximately 10 percent of GNP over the First Five Year Plan, rising 
from more then 8.1 billion yuan in 1953 to a high of more than 11 billion 
yuan in 1955, followed by a drop to slightly more than 10 billion yuan 
in 1957.* The decline in 1956 was on the import side and reflected a 
sharp reduction of receipts under.Soviet loans. In 1957, there was a 
cut in both imports and exports, with total trade about 5 percent less 
than in 1956. In spite of the 1956-57 decline the foreign trade goals 
of the First Five Year Plan, it is claimed, were overfulfilled and total 
trade by the end of 1957 was expected to exceed the First Five Year Plan 
target by 6.4 percent, with the import and export plans overfulfilled by 
8 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively. 22/** 
The contribution of foreign trade to economic and military develop-
ment during the First Five Year Plan is indicated in the composition of 
Communist China's imports. Imports during this period totaled more than 
25.3 billion yuan, of which approximately 8 percent were financed by Soviet 
loans, presumed to be largely of a military nature, and about 4 percent 
by Soviet economic credits. Articles in the Chinese Communist press have 
stated :that the composition of imports was approximately as follows: 
machinery and equipment, 60 percent (15.2 billion yuan); essential raw 
materials, 30 percent (7.6 billion yuan); and consumer goods, 10 percent 
(2.5 billion yuan).*** The machinery and equipment category perhaps in-
cludes some or all of the military imports financed by Soviet loans as 
well as about 3 billion yuan in military Imports estimated to have been 
financed through normal trade channels. In addition, the Chinese

** The reported overfulfilIment is based on a' cumulative total for the 
years 1953757. It was' stated in the First Five Year Plan that the total 
volume of imports and exports in 1957 would be 66.5 percent greater than 
in 1952. It is estimated that the actual increase in total trade was 
about 60 percent.

that there was little change in 1957.

Communists have estimated that during the First Five Year Plan imports 
of machinery and equipment for state construction projects would account 
for 15.2 percent of total investment in capital construction, or about 
7,4 billion yuan. 
Exports are estimated to be approximately 23.5 billion yuan dur-
ing 1953-57. Agricultural products and products processed from agri-
cultural raw materials are stated to have been 77.5 percent of total 
exports, with exports, of mining products, machines, and industrial prod-
ucts contributing the remaining 22.5 percent. El/ 
Trade with the USSR and other Bloc countries was predominant 
during this period, accounting for nearly 78 percent* of total trade for 
the years 1953-57. Trade with the Free World, however, increased in 
relative importance during the last 2 years of the plan period. Main-
tenance of trade with the Free World at this level while total trade was 
dropping is attributable in part to the increase in trade over the past 
few years with Afro-Asian countries and to the partial relaxation of 
trade controls against Communist China in 1957 by some Free World coun-
tries. Minister of Foreign Trade Yeh Chi-chuang predicted in midyear 
that trade with Afro-Asian countries in 1957 would be about 88 percent 
above the 1950 level. 2L8/ The decline of exports in 1957, which appa-
rently caused the Chinese Communists to reduce imports, was partly a 
result of a drop in exports of foodstuffs which largely would have gone 
to the USSR. 
An analysis of Communist China's balance of payments over the 
First Five Year Plan period indicates net .receipts in the nontrade items 
which enabled the financing of an import surplus of approximately 1.9 
billion yuan. Payments for debt service and for foreign aid totaled 
almost 3.5 billion yuan, receipts of Soviet credits were more than 3.1 
billion yuan, and net receipts from all other items were more than 
2.2 billion yuan, including overseas Chinese remittances, expenditures 
of Soviet forces in China during 1953-55, drawings on foreign exchange 
holdings, clearing account debts incurred, and exports of gold. Of the 
Soviet credits received during 1953-57 -- valued at about 3.1 billion 
yuan -- only about one-third can be considered as being used for economic 
development purposes. In terms of funds available for industrial develop-
ment during the First Five Year flan, the Soviet economic credits were 
relatively small, amounting to about 4 percent of total imports and about 
5 to 6 percent of investment in machinery and equipment for capital 
* This percentage would be reduced to 70 percent of total trade if the 
yuan data were converted to US dollars. The discrepancy results from 
the different yuan-dollar exchange rates believed to be employed in China's 
trade with the West (2.46 yuan to.US $1) and with Bloc countries-(mul-
tiple exchange rates, the weighted average of which is 3.79 yuan to US $1).

construction projects. The economic credits, in fact, were far less than 
the yuan -- about 1.9 billion. -- required for repayment of principal and 
interest on the total foreign debt in the plan period. In view Of state-
ments in the Chinese Communist press which suggest only limited reserves 
of foreign exchange, it seems likely that Communist China will be unable, 
during the Second Five Year Plan, to depend on existing foreign exchange 
holdings for sizable.imports.* 
F. Trends in National Finance. 
Actual budget revenues and expenditures during Communist China's 
First Five Year Plan almost exactly balanced at a level approximately 
5 percent above the plan figures. 29/ Most of the above-plan expenditure 
was allocated to economic construction, with more than half of budget 
appropriations under this category devoted to industrial development. 
Although profits from state enterprises and tax receipts exceeded the 
Original plan, the largest increment in above-plan revenue resulted from 
foreign loans, principally in the form of transfers, on credit, of Soviet 
military equipment located in China. Expenditure rose more rapidly than 
revenue during the plan period. Asa result, the budget surplus which 
had been accumulated in the years 1951 to 1954 was exhausted by 1956, 
when the government resorted to currency issue to cover the budget defi-
cit in that year. Reflecting the agricultural base of China's economy, 
annual budget revenues were to a large extent governed by the harvest 
results of the preceding year. Thi 6 pattern of sharp, cyclical fluctua-
tions in annual financial and economic activity during the First Five Year 
Plan prompted a concerted effort in 1957 to build up state reserves of 
basic grain and industrial crops and thus make possible somewhat steadier 
growth during the Second Five Year Plan. 
The most striking feature of Communist China's public finance in 
1956 was the development of an inflationary trend revealed in deficits 
appearing both in the budget accounts and in the balance sheet of the 
state bank. In spite of the liquidation of 2 billion yuan of state com-
modity reserves to absorb some of the "excess purchasing power" created 
by the state's overambitious construction program, there Was still an 
increase in note issue amounting to nearly 1.7 billion ydan. 12/ A 
series of deflationary measures adopted in 1957 included a cutback in 
budget expenditures, a drastic curtailment of agricultural loans,- and a 
reduction in the labor force. The necessary corollary of these measures 
was a slowdown in the rate of economic growth, with state investment in 
capital construction in 1957 declining for the first time and by the 
sizable margin of about 15 percent. Among other trends appearing during 
1956 and 1957 was the continued reduction of defense expenditure. This

development is a reflection of the modernization program in Communist 
China's armed forces which calls for diminishing expenditure for manpower 
(carried under the defense category in the budget) and for increasing 
investment in military industry producing modern arms and equipment 
(carried for themost part under the economic construction category in 
the budget). Still another trend was the sharp contraction in receipts 
from foreign aid coincident with steadily mounting foreign debt charges 
and payments under Communist China's own foreign aid program.* 
G. Trends in Capital Construction Investment. 
1. First Five Year Plan Fulfillment. 
It is estimated that gross investment in Communist China 
amounted to nearly 84 billion yuan during the First Five Year Plan, of 
which more than 60 billion yuan were provided by the state. The major 
sources of savings for gross investment were as follows: profits and 
depreciation allowances of state enterprises, 62 percent; surplus of 
taxes over government noninvestment expenditures, 14 percent; and farmers' 
investment expenditures out of income, 9 percent.** Nearly 80 percent of 
total savings were channeled through the state budget, with most of the 
remainder consisting of private savings and a small amount generated at 
the enterprise level. As further evidence of the key role of agriculture 
in China's economic development, more than half of total investment is 
based on the output of the agricultural sector. 
Although a number of somewhat fearful views of "strains, 
stresses, and imbalances" created in the Chinese economy during the 
First Five Year Plan emanated from Peibing in early 1957, it now appears 
that the regime was eminently successful in attaining the capital con-
struction objectives laid out in the plan. In fact, it is reported that 
planned investment in capital construction was overfulfilled by 14.1 per-
cent, or approximately 6.03 billion yuan above the original target of 
42.74 billion yuan. 31/*** Reflecting Communist China's preoccupation 
* Communist China's budget accounts for the years 1950-58 are shown 
on the chart, Figure 5, following p. 22. 
** For the major components of investment and savings estimated for 
the First Five Year Plan, see Table 9, Appendix A, p. 58, below. 
xxx It should be noted that the plan and fulfillment figures are not 
strictly comparable for the following reasons. First, the fulfillment 
figure is the cumulative total of investment made under the respective 
annual plans which include certain types of construction (for example, 
some local construction) not incorporated in the Five Year Plan. This 
would have the effect of inflating the fulfillment figure. On the other 
hand, as the fulfillment figure is expressed in current prices, the re-
duction in producer goods prices in 1956 gootnote continued on p. 27

with rapid industrial development, approximately 56 percent Of total 
investment in capital construction was channeled into the industrial 
sector and less than 8 percent into the agricultural sector.* The in-
creasing tempo of the regime's drive for rapid industrialization is 
illustrated by the fact that about 54 percent of total investment was 
concentrated in the last 2 years of the plan. 
2. Industrial Capital Construction. 
It is estimated that 27.38 billion yuan Were invested in 
industrial capital construction during the First Five Year Plan. Approxi-
mately 21 billion yuan of this sum represents the gross value of industrial 
fixed assets newly added during this period, an amount slightly higher 
than the net value of all industrial fixed assets existing in 1952. 2/ 
One result of such a rapid expansion of industrial capital in Communist 
China has been the appearance of serious dislocations and imbalances be-
tween the different industrial sectors. As illustrations of the imbalance 
in industrial development that occurred during the plan period, the 
Chinese Communists have cited lagging production in the fuel and raw 
material extraction industries relative to the manufacturing sector as 
well as the uneven development of various branches of the machine building 
industry. 
The proportionate distribution of investment funds between 
heavy industry and light industry has continued to be a topic of much 
discussion among Chinese Communist planners. In spite of a temporary 
shift in favor of light industry in 1956, the ratio of heavy to light in-
dustry investment for the 5-year period was approximately the same as 
that provided in the plan, about 7.9 to 1. ,3./ The major obstacle to 
expanding production of consumer goods is not so much lack of productive 
capacity as a shortage of raw material supplies from the agricultural 
sector. The Chinese Communists have realized belatedly that increased 
investment in agriculture and in the machinery and chemical fertilizer 
industries which support agriculture provides the only basic solution to 
the continuing problem of insufficient consumer goods. For this reason, 
the heavy industry - light industry ratio loses much of its significance 
as an indicator of trends in economic planning in Communist China. 
would have the effect of understating the investment totals for 1956 and 
1957 in relation to the plan prices. Thus the two factors tend to com-
pensate for each other.

vestment during the First Five Year Plan, see Table 10, Appendix A,

II. Economic Trends Under the Second Five Year Plan (1958-62). 
A. ,Introduction. 
A 
In formulating their 1958 annual economic plan the Chinese Com-
munists have demonstrated a new awareness of the fundamental need for 
expanding agricultural production, especially food grains and fibers, as 
the only practical way to provide both increased investment funds and 
consumption goods. A change in emphasis in their priorities has occurred 
in that although heavy industry will continue to receive the largest 
share of investment, increased investment will be accorded to those heavy 
industries providing fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, irrigation 
equipment, and implements for agriculture. A crash program to construct 
new chemical fertilizer plants, combined with a rising level of imports, 
is expected to make available by 1962 at least 7.5 million tons of chemi-
cal fertilizers, a threefold increase over the amount available in 1957. 
At the same time, it has been recognized that important increases in 
production have resulted from raising procurement prices in the past, and 
further price adjustments for certain industrial crops may be planned. 
Whether these shifts in investment and incentives in favor of the 
peasants will be sufficient to improve production to the necessary extent 
cannot yet be estimated, but it is at least clear that the new "policy 
of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously on the basis of 
priority to the growth of heavy industry" is a realistic adaptation of 
Communist policy to conditions existing in China. 
B. Gross National Product. 
It is estimated that total output of goods and services (GNP) 
will increase about as rapidly during the Second Five Year Plan (1958-62) 
as during the First Five Year Plan (1953-57). The estimates of GNP for 
1962 are based on trends in commodity production, government purchases 
and investment, and consumption expenditures. The estimates show that 
in general sufficient funds probably will be available to finance the 
investment required to achieve the projected increases in production 
during the Second Five Year Plan. As shown in Table 11,* GNP at market 
prices will increase by about 45 percent in 1962 above 1957, or 7 to 8 
percent per year. In the distribution of total output, investment will 
increase its share from 20 percent in 1957 to 24 percent in 1962, largely 
at the expense of consumption expenditures which will decline from 70 
percent to 66 percent of the total. In spite of its lower proportion, 
the total consumption expenditure will still permit some increase in 
per capita consumption.

Among the trends projected to 1962 for national income by sector 
of origin, the most significant finding is the continued progress toward 
Communist China's major goal of industrialization. According to these 
estimates the industrial sector will contribute about 26 percent of total 
gross income in 1962 as against 20 percent in 1957 and 13 percent in 
1952.* Industrial output will increase at a somewhat slower rate (91 
percent) during the Second Five Year Plan than in the first plan period 
(109 percent), in large part because of increasing reliance on new ca-
pacity to achieve production increases. On the other hand, agricultural 
output is expected to increase at a faster rate (17 percent compared with 
13 percent in the First Five Year Plan), in keeping with the new emphasis 
on agricultural development in Communist China's economic planning. 
C. Agricultural Production. 
The Peiping regime has decided that an all-out effort must be , 
made to increase agricultural output during the Second Five Year Plan. 
Accordingly, agriculture will receive a larger share of investment than 
it did in the First Five Year Plan. Direct investment by the state, to 
be used primarily on large-scale irrigation and water conservancy projects, 
will increase from 7.8 percent of total capital construction in the first 
plan to about 14 percent of total investment in 1958. 311-/ Indirect invest-
ment also will increase significantly; for example, investment in the 
chemical fertilizer industry will rise from 1 percent of the total during 
the First Five Year Plan to about 3 percent in the Second Five Year Plan. 
The bulk of agricultural investment, however, will continue to be financed 
out of funds accumulated by the collectives, with primary emphasis on 
small-scale irrigation projects which permit expansion of double cropping 
and an immediate increase in agricultural production. Substantial in-
creases in production are planned for both food and industrial crops. 
It is estimated that the increase in grain output by 1962 will 
be on the order of 30 million tons. Applied to the production of grain 
of 185 million tons in 1957, it is felt that production of grain in 1962 
will be approximately 215 million tons. This figure is considerably less 
than the original plan goal of 250 million tons, but plan revisions have 
already been made, with a recent drop to 240 million tons. 35/ Other 
revisions probably will follow. By comparison, the 1962 target for pro-
duction of cotton is conservative -- 2.15 million tons, having recently 
been lowered from 2.4 million tons. It is estimated that production of 
cotton in 1962 will reach 2 million tons. 
Factors considered in making the above estimates include the 
increase in irrigated area, the increased availability of chemical and

organic fertilizers, and the increased sown area obtained through recla-
mation and multiple cropping. Underlining the importance of Communist 
China's program for rapid expansion of the chemical fertilizer industry, 
about one-fourth of the increases in production estimated as possible 
by 1962 are expected to result from increased application of chemical 
fertilizer. The amount available in 1962, including imports, is expected 
to be four times that in 1957, totaling approximately 7.5 million tons 
of both nitrogenous and phosphorous fertilizers. 
In order. to increase production, incentives must be offered which 
will complement the physical Improvements made. So far, incentives for 
collective farm peasants are not satisfactory. Many socialized peasants 
have suffered disillusionment instead of experiencing increased'itcen 
tives. With increased labor requirements for construction, crop cuitt 
vation, and livestock raising, increased competition for land among 
grain,- industrial, and fodder crops, and an increasing gap between urban 
and rural income, the work of collectivized peasants must be properly en-
couraged with increased incentives in procurement prices of agricultural 
products and in better supplies Of consumer goods if the estimated in-
creases in production, are to be.realized. 
In general, in view of the recent realistic adaptation of 
Communist policy to conditions in China, agricultural production during 
the Second Five Year Plan Is expected to keep pace with the basic food 
requirements of Communist China's rapidly growing population and to 
permit some expansion of light industry. It is doubtful whether any 
significant surplus will appear in the agricultural economy. Even the 
achievement of the production figures for 1962 will require a flexible 
approach to the problems of management of the collective farms. Possible 
modifications of the present agricultural program which may result from 
increasing strains on the cooperatives include organizational changes, 
the readjustment of planned allocations of resources to agriculture, and 
the raising of state procurement prices. 
D. Industrial Production. 
During the Second Five Year Plan, Communist China will advance 
a step further toward creating an independent, socialized .industrial 
economy, building upon the foundations laid in the First Five Year Plan 
(1953-57). No finalized plan has been released, but the proposals put 
before' the Eighth Congress of the Chinese Communist Party for increases 
in industrial output apparently are still the basis for detailed plan-
ning. 1?./ If anything, these now appear to be generally conservative.* 
The proposed 1962 targets.were based on the original First Five Year

Plan goals. Thus, in the case of those commodities '(such as crude Oil 
and edible oils) which failed to meet the original targets,- attainment:-
of the Second Five Year Plan goals is doubtful. In other cases the 1957 
target was significantly overfulfilled, and achievement ofthe 1962 goals. 
appears likely.* 
Heavy industry (including the chemical industry) will continue 
to receive priority development, with greater emphasis being devoted 
to those industries which support agricultural production. This is 
especially true of the chemical fertilizer industry and the production 
of farm and irrigation works equipment. A greater part of the heavy 
industrial investment will be in newly developing industrial areas in 
northern Manchuria, North-Central China, and the Northwest, based upon 
extensive inland deposits of industrial raw materials. Increased 
production during the second plan will rely heavily on new capacity. 
(much of which was designed, partly constructed, or completed during 
the first plan), whereas rehabilitation of existing capacity and 
improved technology were important factors in achievement of the first 
plan goals. Significant proportions of the increased output of the 
iron and steel industry and the coal extraction industry will come 
from production of small- and medium-size producing units, under the 
program for effecting a rapid increase in local industries. 
The product mix of Chinese industry will continue to expand 
rapidly and by 1962 will be capable of supplying many basic materials 
as well as medium- and some large-scale machinery and equipment. By 
1962 the plan calls for the machine building industry to furnish 
about 80 percent of machinery requirements compared with about 60 
percent in 1957. In addition to the priority development of the chemi-
cal and machinery industries, it is expected that production of petro-
leum and copper will be emphasized. Chinese production of petroleum, 
however, is far below requirements for consumption, and even if the 
1962 proposed target is met, it is estimated that imports of finished 
petroleum products will remain slightly higher than the 1957 level. 
E. Foreign Economic Relations. 
1. Foreign Trade. 
The economic development program of Communist China will 
necessitate continued growth in its foreign trade. During the First 
Five Year Plan, more than 12 percent of total imports were financed 
by credits from the USSR. Assuming no great change in the world situa-
tion through 1962, it is believed that no significant economic credits

will be received by Communist China. Therefore, the level of imports 
-will be largely determined by export capabilities. 
In the First Five Year Plan period, Communist China's 
exports increased at an average annual rate of under 540 million yuan. 
It is believed that exports will be pushed strenuously over the period 
of the Second Five Year Plan, but the export expansion will be limited 
considerably, as indicated by the 1957 cutbacks, by the demands for 
domestic consumption. It is estimated, therefore, that the potential 
increase in exports over the Second Five Year Plan period will be on 
roughly the same order of magnitude in absolute value terms as that 
experienced during the years 1953-57 -- that is, assuming an average 
annual increase of 500 million yuan, with exports being able to reach 
approximately 7.9 billion yuan by 1962, about 46 percent above 1957. 
Assuming that Communist China exploits this export poten-
tial fully, approximately 4..0 billion yuan, or more than 11 percent - 
of exports during the Second Five Year Plan, will be required for, debt 
service and foreign aid grants and credits. It is estimated that 700 
million yuan in foreign exchange may be received by Communist China 
during this period from overseas Chinese remittances_. If miscellaneous 
foreign exchange payments and receipts are approximately in balance and 
if foreign exchange holdings are at approximately the same level at the 
end of 1962 as they were as of 1 January 1958, Communist China's import 
potential for 1958-62 would be approximately 31.2 billion yuan,* a 
23-percent increase above total imports during the First Five Year Plan. 
Total trade in 1962 would be approximately 15.4 billion yuan, a 49-per-
cent increase above 1957. 
The foregoing estimate' of Communist China's ability to 
pay for imports and the estimates of import requirements during the 
next 5 years suggest that Communist China probably will have suffi-
cient foreign exchange to finance the level of investment goods 
imports apparently planned for the Second Five Year Plan. 
2. Economic Dependence or Self-Sufficienc . 
One of the long-term goals of Communist China is the 
achievement of a high degree of economic self-sufficiency. In the 
industrialization program to date, however, Communist China has been 
dependent on outside assistance, largely from the USSR, in the form 
of imports of investment and military goods, technical assistance, and, 
to a much lesser extent, economic credits. Imports of investment 
goods refer primarily to machinery, equipment, and installations for

industrial construction, principally the 211 (205 being industrial) con-
struction projects receiving complete Soviet aid which are said to form 
the core of Communist China's industrialization program. Although most 
of this aid has come from the USSR, the aid from the European Satellites 
has not been insignificant, with Czechoslovakia alone reported as as-
sisting in the construction of 27 industrial enterprises. Communist 
China's dependence on other, largely Bloc, countries for imports needed 
for industrialization is indicated by the following tabulation, which 
shows the degree of self-sufficiency claimed by the Chinese Communists:

Metals More than 8o 112/ 1957 
Technical assistance, most notably in the form of technical 
data, planning, and technicians furnished for specific construction pro-
jects, has been of considerable importance to Communist China's indus-
trialization. Technical assistance, however, has not been confined to 
construction projects. In the reconstruction period especially, when 
the shortage of trained technical personnel was most acute, Soviet ad-
visers and technicians worked with virtually every ministry and agency 
in the government and with many individual enterprises. Technicians 
provide on-the-job training for Chinese workers, and, in addition, about 
7,000 Chinese have been sent to the USSR for training. Soviet Bloc 
technical data have been utilized extensively. 
With the continuing industrialization of the Chinese economy 
and the expansion of trained personnel in various fields, the dependence 
on Soviet Bloc technicians will gradually decline. Chinese Communist 
statements suggest some dissatisfaction with Soviet designs and techni-
cal advice and indicate that foreign technical assistance must be adapted 
to the actual conditions prevailing in China. Lli This may be an indi-
cation that Communist China will endeavor to rely increasingly on its 
awn technical resources. In view, however, of the many technically com-
plex projects (including a number in the electronics, synthetic fiber, 
metalforming machinery, and precision tool industries) in the planning 
or preliminary stage of construction, it appears likely that the need 
for technical assistance from the Bloc will remain strong throughout the 
Second Five Year Plan.

F. National Finance and Investment. 
1. Financing the Second Five Year Plan. 
Estimates of gross investment and sources of savings for the 
period 1958-62 indicate that sufficient funds probably will be available 
to finance the level of expenditures for capital construction outlined 
in the Draft Proposals for the Second Five Year Plan.* The estimate of 
budget savings, which are expected to account for about 85 percent of 
total savings in the economy, is based on an analysis of trends in taxes 
and profits and. depreciation funds of state enterprises in terms of pro-
jected increases in production of commodities and services. The other 
savings components, including increases in bank deposits, savings at the 
enterprise and farm level, and net foreign investment, are estimated on 
the basis of trends observed in the years 1953-57. Given an estimate of 
total savings, gross investment is derived in the same ratio to savings 
as in the period of the First Five Year Plan.** Individual estimates, 
again based on trends observed in the First Five Year Plan period, for 
agricultural investment outside the budget; increases in inventories; 
and major repair expenditures and supplementary budget expenditures for 
agriculture, water conservancy, and forestry are then aggregated and 
subtracted from the gross investment total. The residual is then treated 
as the amount available for state investment in capital construction 
during the Second Five Year Plan. 
The resulting estimate of state investment, roughly double 
the amount provided in the original First Five Year Plan, corresponds 
with the proposed level of expenditures for capital construction as 
announced in the Draft Proposals for the Second Five Year Plan.Ligi 
Thus, on the basis of present economic policies and in view of trends 
in production and consumption, Communist China's program for mobilizing 
investment capital during the Second Five Year Plan period is considered 
to be probably feasible. 
2. Allocation of Investment. 
Estimates of investment-output ratios by sector for the First 
and Second Five Year Plans show higher ratios of investment in relation 
to output in the years 1958-62 than in the First Five Year Plan period.XX

savings for the Second Five Year Plan, see Table 14, Appendix A, p. 63,

This finding reflects the increasing necessity of relying on newly added - 
capacity rather than on greater utilization of existing capacity in 
order to achieve planned expansion of production. In the First Five 
Year Plan the targets for investment were high in relation to production 
goals for 1957, and most of the goals were achieved in 4 years. The 
proposed level of investment in the Second Five Year Plan is not likely, 
however', to lead to a similar overfulfillment of the 1962 targets. 
Recent discussions of the 1958 plan reveal a new pattern of 
state investment allocation designed to correct the imbalances in eco-
nomic development appearing under the First Five Year Plan. Greater 
emphasis on agricultural development is seen in the rising proportion 
of capital construction investment in agriculture as against industry 
(1 to 4.7) compared with the corresponding ratio (Ito 6.6) under the 
First Five Year Plan. Beavy industry, particularly the chemical fer-
tilizer and farm equipment industries which support agriculture, oc-
cupies an even more favored position in relation to light industry than 
in the First Five Year Plan, the new ratio being 8.9 to 1 compared with 
7.9 to 1 in the years 1953 to 1957. The reason for this decision at a 
time when supplies of consumer goods are far from meeting demand is that 
expansion of light industry must await the prior development of produc-
tion of raw materials in the agricultural sector. Another characteristic 
of the 1958 investment plan is an increase in the ratio of investment 
between the fuel and raw material extraction industries on the one hand 
and the processing and manufacturing sectors on the other, the ratio 
rising from 2.5 to 1 in the First Five Year Plan to 4.6 to 1 in 1958. 
Finally, in recognition of the problem of rising investment cost per 
additional unit of production, more investment is to be allocated to 
small- and medium-size mining and industrial installations under the 
jurisdiction of local levels of government, projects for which the in-
vestment cost per unit of capacity is considerably lower than for large-
scale, highly mechanized plants and mines. This trend is reflected in 
the ratio between central and local government investment in 1958, their 
respective shares changing from 4.1 to 1 in the First Five Year Plan to 
3.2 to 1 in the first year of the Second Five Year Plan.)1.3./ ?

III. Problems of Economic Development. 
A. Introduction. 
The salient fact about the Chinese economy is the enormous popu-
lation relative to the quantity of arable land. In most periods the 
extremely high birthrate of the peasant population has been largely 
offset by a high death rate. In any period, however, when wars, disorder, 
natural calamities, and disease have been mitigated, there has been an 
immediate response by growth in population. This unrelenting pressure 
of population on food supply is the basic problem with which any Chinese 
regime is faced regardless of its other objectives. 
The Chinese Communists have had remarkable success not only in 
forwarding their major objective of industrializing China but also in 
restoring general economic activity and in improving agriculture and the 
food supply. This success has borne its usual fruit of growth in popu-
lation. The rate of growth which in 1950-52 was about 1 to 1.5 percent' 
per year is now estimated to have reached 2.4 percent in 1957. The 
average annual growth of agriculture for 1953-57, nearly 3 percent, 
provided a mall margin above the average growth in population of 2 per-
cent. The margin, however, has diminished as growth in population in-
creased. 
The gains in agriculture over the past 5_years resulted from 
relatively simple and inexpensive measures. Future gains are likely 
to become slowly more difficult. Only a small decrease in growth of 
food production would lower it below the rate of growth in population. 
The First Five Year Plan (1953-57) demonstrated the ability of the 
Chinese Communists to mount a program of rapid industrialization. But 
the Malthusian problem will remain to confront the Chinese Communists 
regardless of their success in industrialization. 
The problem of population versus food supply is discussed in 
more detail below. Communist China's economic policies and plans are 
evaluated in the light of this problem. 
B. Population and Labor Force. 
The population of China in mid-1957 was 631 million compared with 
about 575 million in 1952.* The increase over the 5 years averaged about 
2 perc,nt per year, well above the rate of the period 1950-52 and perhaps 
3 to 4 times the rate of 1930-50. This acceleration of growth poses not

only a problem of food supply but also the problem of maintaining full 
employment with equitable income distribution. 
Before 1956 the Chinese Communists were inclined to flaunt their 
large population as an attribute of national power and prestige. Accelera-
ting growth in population, however, gradually brought home to them the 
difficulty of maintaining the average consumption of the total population. 
When demands for austerity in consumption failed to achieve the desired 
rate of saving, important consumer goods such as grain, vegetable oils, 
and cotton cloth were rationed. The insufficiency of agricultural pro-
duction to meet both ration commitments and desired levels of state 
reserves influenced a change in the official attitude toward population 
and the formulation of a positive policy on the subject. An extensive 
campaign is now being waged to encourage birth control and to make large 
families economically unattractive. 
The new policy on population is not expected to do much more 
than level off the rate of growth at about 2.4 percent, so that the 
estimated population will be about 710 million in 1962 and 799 million 
by 1967. The present shortage of medical services probably will prevent 
the birth control program from making much headway in the rural areas, 
where more than 8o percent of the population resides. The gains which 
are achieved are likely to be largely offset by reductions in the death 
rate. The estimated increase in population of 13 percent during the 
Second Five Year Plan (1958-62) will continue to press heavily on the 
supply of food and consumer goods. 
A similar awakening:has taken place in Chinese Communist employ-
ment policy. The goal of mechanizing industry as rapidly as possible 
has been replaced by plans to devote more investment funds to projects 
which offer maximum employment. Planning for agricultural mechanization, 
originally based on Soviet experience which substituted large-scale 
tractors and combines for scarce labor, has been revised drastically to 
feature small-scale, multiple-purpose machinery designed to supplement 
rather than displace China's abundant agricultural labor force. 
Various steps have been taken to stiffen the policy preventing peasant 
migration into the cities and even to transfer large numbers of present 
urban residents back to the countryside. These increments to the agri-
cultural labor force will tend to depress further the low per capita 
income of the rural population but will not materially increase agricul-
tural output, because there is already an ample supply of rural labor. 
The prospects for a new labor force policy that will provide 
proportionally greater nonfarm employment opportunities in the Second 
Five Year Plan and the Third Five Year Plan (1963-67) than were provided 
by the First Five Year Plan are not promising. A brief review of labor 
force trends during the First Five Year Plan provides a basis of com-
parison.

The official data on the number of office staff and factory 
workers indicate that they totaled about 24.2 million in 1956, or less 
than 10 percent of the estimated total labor force. During the First 
Five Year Plan, only 5.2 million new office and factory workers were 
added to the labor force* out of a total population increase of more 
than 50 million. A national rate of participation in the labor force 
of 47 percent of the population has been indicated in several sample 
studies. Applied to the estimated 1956 nonfarm population of 104 mil-
lion, this meant a total nonfarm labor force of 49 million in that 
year. Besides the 24 million office and factory workers, 20 million 
more were accounted for in such categories as handicrafts, military 
forces, and services. The remaining 5 million probably were unemployed 
or casual laborers. 
In the early years of the Second Five Year Plan, the population 
increment annually reaching employment age will be about 5 million or 
6 million. Assuming a participation rate of 70 percent for this age 
group, nearly 20 million jobs will be required during the plan period. 
Moreover, this increase in job requirements is in addition to the need 
for employment of those at present unemployed or undetemployed. Toward 
the end of the Second Five Year Plan and to a much greater extent in - 
the Third Five Year Plan, about half of the annual population increments 
of 15 million or more will be seeking employment in the labor market. 
The only employment goal expressed in the Second Five Year Plan 
is to increase factory and office employment by 6 million to 7 million 
persons. /12/ Although this goal was fixed before the recent emphasis 
on small-. and medium-size industrial installations, rough estimates in-
dicate that thiS new program can provide at best no more than 1 million 
additional jobs during the period of the Second Five Year Plan. Another 
major source of nonfarm employment, the handicraft industry, is not 
encouraged by the Chinese Communists, for the reason that expansion of 
handicrafts would enlarge the demand for scarce agricultural raw materials 
and interfete with planned production in the modern industrial sector. 
It is probable that nearly half of the 20 million entering the labor 
force during the Second Five Year Plan will be underemployed in agricul-
ture, if not unemployed. 
C. Investment Allocation. 
The Chinese themselves have viewed their present problems pri-
marily as a question of investment allocation -- that is, the share of 
total output devoted to investment and the allocation of investment 
among various sectors. 
* For the sector distribution of this labor force for the years 1952 
and 1956, see Table 17, Appendix A, p. 65, below.

At the Eighth Party Congress and thereafter, a number of speeches 
and articles took issue with the official Communist doctrine of the over-
whelming priority of industry, especially heavy industrial development, 
in Chinese Communist planning. The three general themes of those advancing 
such views follow. First, the ratio of "accumulation" (the Communist 
term for net investment) to total output in the First Five Year Plan 
period was about the maximum that could be achieved in China. Although 
this rate of investment (about 22 percent) was lower than that attained 
in the USSR during its several Five Year Plans (about 25 percent), it 
could not be raised, because of the consumption requirements of China's 
enormous population. 1.?W Second, the share of industrial investment 
allocated to light industry in the First Five Year Plan was too low, 
accounting for less than 12 percent of total industrial investment. La/ 
This pattern of allocation was preventing increases in light industrial 
output which would in turn provide investment funds for heavy industry 
by incteasing budget income from the state's light industry enterprises 
and from indirect taxes. The small share of investment in light industry 
and existing price and trade policies had resulted in production by 
light industry of poor-quality goods. By improving the quality and 
variety of the products of light industry, it was argued, living stan-
dards could be raised and exports of these commodities could be greatly 
increased. Third, the rate of increase in agricultural output was too 
small in relation to increases in the nonagricultural sectors, causing 
consumption to rise too slowly in relation to investment. Moreover, 
peasant consumption was increasing much more slowly than wages of em-
ployees in the nonagricultural sector, and prices paid for agricultural 
products were too low to support an increasing peasant standard of living 
and to provide incentives for increasing agricultural production. 
These criticisms were directed at some of the major features of 
Communist China's investment program during the First Five Year Plan. 
For the 5-year period 1953-57, gross domestic investment at current 
prices averaged about 17 percent* of GNP, a percentage which is roughly 
comparable with that achieved in recent years in the US. The allocations 
of investment expenditures to heavy industry were 30 percent of total 
v investment in 1952 and rose steadily each year up to nearly 50 percent 
in 1957. The average annual rate of increase in investment in heavy in-
dustry from 1953 through 1957 was nearly 24 percent as against an average 
annual rate of increase in other investment of a little less than 10 per-
cent. 
* This estimate is based on a study of China's national accounts. The 
percentage given in Chinese Communist statistics is larger mainly because 
a number of expenditures and reserve funds which they include in the 
"accumulation" figure are not considered to be investment as defined in 
the West.

It is noteworthy that this increase in investment in heavy in-
dustry has, taken place simultaneously with a modest increase in over-all 
per capita consumption and in general without serious strain on the 
economy. The difficulties that appeared in 1956 and led to a reduction. 
of investment in 1957 resulted from investment ,(and current production) 
outstripping the supply of industrial materials (and inventories of all 
kinds) rather than an excess of investment at the expense of consumption. 
Corrective measures were .taken in 1957 to raise investment in raw, materials 
industries relative to processing industries. Moreover,, the allocation 
of nearly nine-tenths of total industrial investment to heavy industry 
in the First Five Year Plan period was not excessive in the light of 
China's needs. Even with the modest development of the light industry 
sector during the period 1953-57, most of the major consumer goods in-
dustries were producing well below capacity in 1957 because of the short-
age of raw material supplies from the agricultural sector. 
Thus the critics of Communist China's investment program sensed 
a basic problem in the economy, but their analysis was only partly cor-
rect. Only the third of the criticisms cited above approaches the 
essential problem. This problem is not that total investment has been . 
necessarily too high but that the burden of saving for the investment 
has been too heavily concentrated on.the.agricultural population, whose 
per capita consumption probably rose little if at all during thA First 
Five Year Plan. The basic question is whether the investment, manage-
ment, and incentives in agriculture are adequate: to produce sufficient 
food and fibers' for a rapidly growing population and in addition to 
provide a surplus to support investment programs in other sectors of 
the economy. 
D. Agriculture. 
1. Investment. 
Agricultural prospects hinge on two kinds of factors': first, 
the physical potentiality of the land and the cost of exploiting this 
potential, and, second, the impact of socialization and other Communist 
policies on peasant incentives, and hence on.productivity. 
Investment planned for agriculture for 1958-62 represents 
a larger share of planned total output and of total investment than in 
the preceding 5 years.. State investment will concentrate on large-scale 
water conservancy projects which will not contribute substantially to , 
production until after 1962. Investment by the peasants themselves will 
center' about small-scale irrigation projects.which will have a.more 
immediate effect On production. As nearly as one can tell, the:target 
for expanding irrigated (and thus multiple-cropping) area is. about the, 
maximum that can be achieved. In addition to the direct investments in

agriculture, a major effort to increase production of chemical-fertilizer 
will contribute materially to agricultural output. In this Case, the 
revised 1962 production target of more than 10 million tons of chemical 
fertilizer appears to be in excess of what is feasible. 
Thus it appears that the Second Five Year Plan calls for 
doing nearly all that can be done to increase agricultural output. The 
success of the plan, however, is contingent on the cooperation of the 
peasants. Of an estimated total investment of 33 billion yuan for agri-
culture, forestry, and water bonservanoy, it is estimated that more than 
half is to come from the collectives' and cooperatives' income -- that 
is, out of the peasants' awn income.* In practice it may prove impas-
sible to exact such a large amount of forced savings frol the peasants, 
in which case the discrepancy would have to be made good by the state 
in the form of loans or subsidies. 
Most of the funds for state investment also came from the 
agricultural population through the mechanism of state procurement at 
fixed low prices. The impact Of these policies is reflected in Peasant 
income. 
. Trends in Worker-Peasant Income Differentials. 
Trends in worker-peasant per capita incomes, measured in 
constant prices, for 1952, 1957, and 1962 are presented in the follow-
ing tabulation (in yuan per year): 
1952

These estimates cannot be considered an exact measurement of comparative 
consumption, because they do not take into account the higher prices 
(25 to 30 percent) of commodities in cities, the different consumption 
patterns in urban and rural areas, and the additional expenses incurred 
by workers for housing, utilities, and transportation. Nevertheless, 
* See Table 14, Appendix A, p. 63, below. 
** Worker income is derived from the total wage bill, excluding fringe 
benefits; peasant income is derived from estimates of both cash income 
and farm home consumption.

they do indicate that the income differential, already substantial in 
1952, was even greater in 1957 and that it will become even more pro-
nounced during the period of the Second Five Year Plan. 
The Chinese Communists themselves have expressed concern 
over this large disparity between worker and peasant incomes, especially 
as it affects peasant Morale and productivity and stimulates peasant 
migrations into the alreRay overcrowded cities. The regime has taken 
certain measures, mainly in 1956-57, which seek to narrow the differ-
ential. Procurement prices for farm products have been raised on the 
average relative to retail prices. According to Official announcements, 
the index of state procurement prices in 1956 was 16.6 percent higher 
than in 1952. @./ On the other hand, average retail prices of indus-
trial products sold in rural areas were claimed to be approximately the 
same in the 2 years in question. Other measures to stimulate production 
were directives to the cooperatives to allow more time and labor points 
for subsidiary industry and to increase from 5 to 10 percent the pro-
portion of land held in individual plots. Finally, recent directives 
on wages of unskilled workers attempt to meet the problem in a reverse , 
manner by lowering the initial wages for city jobs for which the peasants 
might qualify. 
These measures apparently had little net effect on narrowing 
the differential in 1956-57, and estimates for 1962 indicate that the 
discrepancy between worker and peasant incomes will increase. A solu-
tion to this problem would be simply to increase significantly the 
prices paid for agricultural goods. .Then, however, a way would have 
to be found to lower urban incomes, or aver-all investment would have 
to be reduced. 
3. Collectivization. 
Incentives depend not only on income but also on the way in 
which incomes are tied to individual performance. Collectivization 
removes land and capital from individual ownership and responsibility. 
Wherever it has been tried, it has had a negative effect to one degree 
or another on agricultural productivity. Whether this will happen to 
a significant extent in China remains to be seen. In the USSR a large 
export surplus and an initially adequate diet provided a cushion for 
the reduction in output that accompariied collectivization. A comparable 
reduction in China, where a large portion of the population is on the 
edge of malnutrition, would be much more serious. 
China's collectivization experience is still too short to 
provide the basis for judging its ultimate success. Experience to date*

provides both favorable and unfavorable signs. Over-all agricultural 
output has increased somewhat. Although grain procurement declined in 
2 successive years, 1955 and 1956, it probably rose again in 1957. 
There was a precipitous decline in the number of hogs in 1956 but a 
recovery in 1957 when hogs were returned from the collectives to the 
individual peasants. On the other hand, the downward.trend in draft 
animals continued, and because of peasant dissatisfaction with collec-
tivization,.there has been a large influx of peasants into cities. 
In general, the Chinese Communist leadership has displayed 
considerable flexibility in adjusting to problems arising from collec-
tivization, as illustrated by the increase in the size of the peasant's 
private plot in 1957, by increases in procurement prices during 1956 
and 1957, and bY the return of hogs to private care in 1956. Flexibil-
ity is limited, however, by the overriding procurement objectives of 
the state. 
This limitation is illustrated by the abortive "free market" 
policy introduced at the Eighth Congress of the Chinese Communist Party 
in September 1956. 112/ By this time, almost all peasants' sales of major 
agricultural products were restricted to the procurement and purchasing 
agencies of the state. In an attempt to stimulate the lagging production 
of subsidiary agricultural commodities, a state-regulated free market 
was to be Opened for such secondary agricultural products as poultry, 
vegetables, farm handicrafts, and fruit and aquatic products from 
scattered sources. In effect, this was merely a recognition of a tra-
ditional, long-existing marketing system whichup to that time the 
Chinese Communists had not brought under,state control,' 
By November 1956 a free market had been established in nine 
provinces, and, as predicted, the supply of vegetables, poultry, fish, 
and handicraft products had increased rapidly in response to demand and 
favorable prices. In spite of controls, however, alleged abuses of the 
free market system soon spread. .22/ Commodities on the lists of goods 
restricted to planned state procurement and unified purchase, especially 
grains and edible oils, found their way into the free market before the 
state purchasing quotas had been fulfilled. Although production of 
grain in 1956-57 was reported as 5 percent above that of the previous 
grain year, purchases of grain by the state decreased by 5 percent. 
One of the reasons why peasants left the cooperative farms was to engage 
in full-time commercial. activity. In some cases, whole cooperatives 
apparently collaborated in selling their produce before fulfilling state 
quotas. Prices of some products soared, and a black market flourished. 
In October 1957, all sales of major agricultural commodities 
except to state trading agencies were prohibited, and in addition the 
list of commodities which could be sold in the free market was greatly

reduced. Even these items may be brought under government procurement 
and sale by local governments in those areas where particular items are 
produced in large quantities. Thus the end result of the free market 
experiment was to subject even more of agricultural production to the 
state's procurement and pricing policies. 
E. Large Versus Small Industrial Units. 
During the First Five Year Plan, Communist China's industrial 
investment program stressed capital-intensive Projects which failed to 
make optimum use of the vast labor existing in China. The ch6ice of 
capital-intensive technology has two consequences that are serious in 
the light of Communist China's problems and objectives: (1) output 
gains probably are not so large, particularly in the short run, as they 
could be under a labor-intensive investment program; and (2) a consider-
able part of the increase in labor force becomes unemployed or is pushed 
back into agriculture where low per capita income is already a problem. 
With increasing growth of the labor force over the next decade, it will 
became Even more urgent to provide productive employment outside of 
agriculture. Chinese Communist plans for developing small-scale plants 
indicate an awareness of this problem. On the basis of available in-
formation, however, the scope of. these plans does not appear to be ex-
tensive enough to contribute significantly to a solution of the employ-
ment problem. Moreover, the planning and supervision Of many small-
scale plants is clearly more difficult than would be the case with a 
relatively few large plants. 
The industrial planners of Communist China entered upon the 
First Five Year Plan with a predilection for large-scale, integrated 
industrial plants like the new iron and steel combines under construc-
tion at Wuhan and Pao-t'ou. During 1957, however, a combination of 
factors relating to the allocation of resources influenced the Chinese 
Communist economic planners to consider favorably the relative economy 
of investment in small- and medium-size heavy industry installations 
and the expansion of existing plants in such old manufacturing centers 
as Shanghai and Tientsin. Such plants would require more laborers than 
large-scale plants but would permit exploitation of additional natural 
resources, reduce transportation costs of raw materials, utilize domes-
tically produced equipment, and enable more rapid completion of construc-
tion. 
During the course of the First Five Year Plan the Chinese Com-
munist planners learned from experience that labor costs in construction 
are relatively low and that the costs of imported designs and heavy 
automatic equipment are relatively high. Thus in some industries in 
China the investment cost per unit of capacity of a small- or medium-
size installation may be substantially lower than the cost of a large

S,E-C,R-E-T 
one. On the other hand, this initial advantage may be somewhat counter-
balanced by a higher production cost per unit of output. The following 
figures, which were taken from a Chinese Communist review of coal mine 
investment and production costs, 21/ illustrate these points:

Another advantage of the small- and medium-size mines is that they can 
help meet the growing shortage of coal for household consumption, at the 
same time reducing the load on the railroad system and freeing the large 
mines to produce for industrial demand. Also, China is able to provide 
production eqUipment for the small- and medium-size mines from domestic 
resources, thus reducing the pressure on its limited holdings of foreign 
exchange. As a result of all of these considerations, it is now planned 
to have small mines (with an annual production capacity of 300,000 tons 
or less) account for well over one-third of the new capacity to be added 
to the coal industry during the Second Five Year Plan. 22/ 
In the iron and steel industry it has also been found that 
limited increases in productive capacity can be realized by improving 
some existing small plants and building similar ones for less cost per 
ton of capacity than would be involved in building a large integrated 
plant. The small-plant program will alleviate local shortages of iron 
and steel, will permit exploitation of a number of scattered small iron 
deposits, and will enable the large mills to make economies by mass-
producing for large consuming industries. The original small-plant 
program 'called f6r the construction of about 18 plants at widely dis-
persed locations with a combined production of 1.6 million tons of 
steel and for a total cost of about 600 million to 700 million yuan. 2,V 
By comparison, a large iron and steel plant with an annual production 
of 1.5 million tons of steel has required more than 1 billion yuan in 
capital investment. It is expected that these small plants will con-
tribute more than one-fourth of the new capacity to be added to the 
steel industry during the Second Five Year Plan. 
This trend toward economizing on capital investment, with em-
phasis shifting to smaller, less mechanized plant facilities, has

characterized .planning in other heavy industries as well. Several non-
ferrous metals processing plants have been planned to utilize less 
mechanized units, more domestically produced equipment, and more labor-
intensive processes, with the result that the plants can be constructed 
more quickly. A similar program is under way for the chemical fertilizer 
industry, with numerous medium- and small-scale plants planned for con-
struction within a relatively short period of time.? 
E. Prospects. 
Whether or not the agricultural policies of Communist China will 
lead to serious difficulties is difficult to predict. China cannot 
afford a decline in agricultural production, and, in this Sense, some 
of these policies might be considered risky in that they provide rela-
tively low incentives for the peasants. The Chinese Communists are 
following the Soviet example in collectivization and in financing in-
vestment by savings extorted primarily from the rural population. They 
are proceeding, however, without the margin of diet and production of 
surplus food that the USSR had and in the face of a rapid and possibly 
accelerating growth in population. 
The Chinese Communists can, of course, modify their program to 
counteract the more pressing difficulties should these policies prove 
detrimental to agricultural production. .Peasant incomes could be raised 
and urban incomes reduced while leaving investment intact, although in 
practice this procedure probably would be both administratively and poli-
tically difficult. A,safety valve is available in foreign trade in that 
agricultural exports can be reduced or agricultural imports increased, , 
although this latter expedient would likely be at the expense of imports 
of investment goods and would thus affect to some extent the planned level 
of investment. Another measure which the Chinese Communists might adopt, 
and one which appears ,to be the most 'promising, is substantially increas-
ing imports of chemical fertilizers. These imports would tend to pay for 
themselves through expanded agricultural production, which in turn would 
both increase the domestic food supply and permit increased agricultural 
exports.
