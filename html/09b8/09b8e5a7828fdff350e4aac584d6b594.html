 RLD COMMUNIST AFFAIRS
 23 May-19 June 1967 50X1-HUM
 1.   The outbreak of Israeli-Arab warfare  finds all ruling CP leaders (except
 the Rumanians) on the side of Nasser and Co.; nevertheless, it exposes further
 cracks and conflicts in the Communist world, notably as:
 a.   The Chinese attempt to exploit the disappointment of the Arabs with the
 Soviet failure to take effective action to support them, branding the Soviets
 as "the number one accomplice" of the U.S. in "jointly plotting the Israeli
 attack," "secretly flirting with I. while publicly condemning her"; the Soviet
 clique is "the worst traitor to the Arab people," a "hangman" repressing their
 struggles; a Soviet ship was the first to enter the reopened Gulf of Aqaba,
 and the Soviets are trying to sabotage the Arab oil embargo by selling their
 oil instead; etc.   As the cease-fire urged by the Soviets (after the magnitude
 of I. military superiority became apparent) is achieved, China calls on-the
 Arabs to "plunge into redoubled, long-range, fierce struggle."  And Peking
 reports warm reception of and gratitude for its support among the Arabs, with
 Arab papers republishing the above charges and calls.
 b.   The Soviets strike back in a lower, more defensive key, exposing Chinese
 "fabrications," ridiculing Peking's repeated reference to the support of its
 700 million people so far away (why didn't they use them in neighboring Indo-
 nesia or Vietnam?), and accusing it of provocation and "objective" collusion
 with the U.S. and Israel.
 c.   The Soviets rally a Moscow summit of the,European ruling parties (minus
 Albania, of course) to sign a statement patterned on the Soviet example, --
 but the Rumanians refuse  to associate themselves with it because of its de-
 nunciation of the Israelis as aggressors, -- though Tito does sign.   The Ruman-
 ians on the other hand, call for a fresh start at solving the problems on the
 basis of existing realities and the necessity for peaceful coexistence of both
 sides, -- while Radio Bucharest in Yiddish describes its new April treaty with
 Israel for expansion of trade and cooperation!   Rumania offers emergency wheat
 shipments to the UAR -- as does ComChina, while some of the other Communist
 states are reportedly joining the Soviets in emergency resupply of military
 hardware.
 d.   In Asia, the Mongolian Party subscribes to the Moscow Summit  statement
 after it is published, while the N. Korean and N. Vietnamese parties are more
 sharply critical of U.S. "instigation and support" of the Israeli aggression
 thanMoscow.   Cuba denounces as "capitulation" the UNSecurity Council cease-
 fire resolution agreed to by the Soviets.   Only the Albanians among the ruling
 CPs join the Chinese in charging Soviet complicity with the U.S.
 e.   A number of CPs, especially in the West, are reportedly torn between Soviet
 pressure for support and popular sympathy fdr Israel:   the British CP reportedly

 suffers numerous resignations after it opts for the Soviet line,, while the
 CPSUA avoids taking sides.   The full story of such repercussions obviously    50X1-HUM
 remains to be told.
 2.  Elsewhere, the Chinese further exacerbate their isolation in the ICM by
 engaging in new "diplomatic" feuds  involvin   ersonnel and property, with the
 Mongolians                Bulgarians           and East Germans          50X1-F50X1-H U M
 and again scathingly attack the CPs of India                and Japan          50X1-HUM
 They also increase the intensity of their media attacks on the Soviet revi-
 sionists (even apart from the Israeli-Arab conflict), -- and draw increased
 Soviet response.
 3.     Ceausescu-led Rumanian visit to Hungary before the Israeli-Arab outbreak
 produced the coolest communique yet seen in these EE bilateral             UW
 meeting without even any reference to a cordial atmosphere or fraternal     50X1-HUM
 friendship, and a scheduled mid-June visit of the same Rumanians to Yugoslavia
 is indefinitely postponed after the Moscow summit            And the E. Germans 50X1-H U M
 still angry at the Rumanians for establishing dip omatic relations with Bonn,
 front-page, after the Moscow summit           the story of the new Israeli- 50X1-HUM
 Rumanian treaty expanding trade and cooperation.
 4.   The Soviets keep up their pressure for a world CP meeting, calling for it
 jointly in a communique with the Finnish CP
 5.   And the Albanians continue to broadcast messages purportedly from an
 underground anti-Gomulka Polish CP, this time a communication to comrades in
 the purported underground "Bolshevik CPSU"
 6.   Both Soviet and Chinese media publicize statements (too numerous to record)
 by fronts under their respective wings and following their respective lines
 on the Israeli-Arab conflict;those based in Peking also accuse the Soviet
 revisionists of collusion with the U.S.
 7.   Chinese media heavily exploit a Peking seminar)             (sponsored by    50X1-HUM
 their captive Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau to commemorate Mao's "Yenan Talks,"
 -- and frankly acknowledge that. it is "the first international meeting to pub-
 licize Mao's thought."   (Most "foreign" names mentioned are readily identifiable
 as expatriates resident in Peking.)

 passes, the continuing welter of confused reporting indicates almost no

 "progress," with wi~d violent or passive resistance -- or plain anarchy.
 The Army is ordered        to assume full responsibility for cracking down     50X1 -H U M
 on lawlessness and maintaining order, yet it seems to be strangely reluctant
 or unable to act.   Large-scale mobilization of urban personnel for field work
 on the summer harvest is reported.   Foreign observers, Communist as well as
 non-Communist, attribute the almost hysterically xenophobic regime actions
 described throughout our Chronology as designed to divert the people's atten-
 tion from internal chaos and rally support under the banner of nationalism.
 9.   Peking tries to continue to keep the Hong Kong unrest    stirred up,     50X1-HUM
 repeatedly calling on the HK people to organize and prepare to overthrow      50X1-HUM
 British rule, with the support of the 700 million Chinese:  however  a series
 of strike efforts fail and the situation seems to be stabilizing.

 the Chinese escalate feuds with Indonesia        and continuing) and India    50X1-HUM
 tions -- if it were any country other than China.
 12.   The explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb draws much the same reaction
 from the various Communist media as the earlier A-bomb explosions (a one-     50X1-HUM
 sentence report citing NCNA for Soviet output).  Warm congratulations from
 Ho Chi Minh are worth noting.
 13. Our Chronology details)                               (considerable evidence of
 the Soviet regime's current difficulties in coping with a rising intellectual
 ferment and demand for freedom by its writers, revealing the picture of bland
 conformity at the 4th Congress of the Union of Soviet Writers conveyed by
 media reporting was phony and misleading.
 14.   The first Communist attempt to explain the reasons for the disastrous
 Arab defeat known to us comes in a June 13 Soviet Radio "Peace and Progress"
 broadcast:   it cites as the principal factor that the Arab armies were composed
 of uneducated peasants.   It also implies that the Arab soldiers may not have
 been enamored of the "transformations taking place in their country."   (Included
 under Israeli-Arab round-up.)
 15.   PRAVDA again warns W. German that W. Berlin is not a part of it but is
 "an independent political entity."

 a "people's war" to conquer the country.
 21.   JAPAN:   Further splitting of the Japanese left as a result of the JCP-

 A.  The first anniversary of the outbreak of the "'Cultural Revolution" finds
 Peking regime propaganda trying to cdnvey its message through "cultural"
 matters (literature and art), and acknowledging that "at this stage of the
 struggle to seize power, contradictions of various kinds remain complex."
 Meanwhile, wall newspapers and posters describe chaotic, bloody clashes on
 a growing scale throughout the country, seemingly confirmed by a 7-point
 June 7 directive banning all forms of violence and illegal action and  i~; ving
 the PLA (army) full responsibility for maintaining order everywhere (a man-
 date which seems to have made little difference as yet in the stance of
 local PLA commanders).
 Noteworthy items include:
 (1)  May 23 opens (with a Lin Piao-led mass rally) a new propaganda barrage
 pegged to  the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work 'Talks at
 the Yenan Forum of Literature and Art,"' and including repeated references
 to "the forum on literary and art work in the armed forces in 1966 (Shanghai,
 February 2-20)" which "Lin Piao entrusted to Chiang Ching (Mrne. Mao)," --
 a Mao-edited and -approved `summary" of which is published on the 28th.
 Also published for the first time are five of Mao's "militant documents on
 literature and art," three 'letters" and two "instructions" over the period
 1944-1964, all of which are distributed in pamphlet form beginning June-1.
 (2)  A June 1 joint RED FLAG/PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial commemorates the lst
 anniversary of "the first M-L big-character poster to appear in China," --
 "a great strategic measure ... a battle order issued directly to the entire
 Party and to the people of the entire country."  This editorial admits that
 contradictions remain complex in the struggle to "force the enemy finally

 (3)  The 7-.point June 7 `circular" cracking down on violence and giving the
 PLA responsibility for maintaining order, first reported on that date by
 Tokyo YOMIURI's Peking correspondent Seki, is signed by the CCP/CC, the
 State Council, the CCP/CC Military Affairs Committee, and the CCP/CC Cul-
 tural Revolution Group.
 (4)  On the day the circular appeared, a Peking poster by a visiting Yunnan
 group describes an uprising in that province of 30,000 "under the influence
 of a handful of power factionists within the Kunming Military Govt" who
 on 28-29 May besieged 2,200 members of the "Kunming Maoist Artillery Corps,"
 killing 266 and injuring about 1,000.  This is only one of a series of
 reports of similar nature by correspondents in Peking, and there is no
 indication of a slackening in the turmoil following the issuance of the
 directive to the PLA.

 (5)  Meanwhile, NCNA on the 11th announces that more than 29 million copies
 of THE SELECTED WORKS OF MAO TSE-TUNG;came off the press in China in the
 first 5 mo':hs of 1967, a 20% increase over last year and "two and one-half
 times the total number of copies published in the 15 years preceding the
 GPCR. ""
 (6) In contrast, PEOPLE'S DAILY on June 15 and 16 publishes "letters from
 readers'' and editor's notes "in response to Chairman Mao's call":  "Economy
 must be practiced in making revolution."  Advocated are "such 'small things'
 as withdrawing broadcast vehicles, stopping the practice of sending presents,
 and using clay paste instead of starch as glue."
 B.  Concern with the summer harvest is expressed in a PEOPLE'S DAILY edi-
 torial of May 31 which calls it "an acute class struggle" and directs the
 immediate mobilization of the "poor and lower-middle peasants, all working
 people and revolutionary cadres" to work on it, -- and even more concretely
 by an NCNA report on the 15th:  "In the past few days nearly 200,000 Red
 Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, commanders and fighters of the
 PLA, and cadres in govt. organizations have gone from Peking to the surround-
 ing ccuntryside to help bring in the wheat harvest, which promises to be
 excellent."
 C.  Personalities at the top:  Mao is reported meeting with pro-Chinese
 Ceylonese Communist leader N. Sanmugathasan on June 6, shaking hands with
 80 international seminar participants June 9, and appearing in public at
 the Peking Opera on the 17th.  Lin Piao gains even further prominence as he
 heads for the first time a large public gathering in the absence of ilao,
 the May 23 rally on the 25th anniversary of the Yenan talks, a performance
 which he repeats on June 9:  his name is also on a newly-published book to
 be added to the Maoist classics, devoted to the 1966 forum which he "entrusted
 to Chiang Ching'' (para. Al). Chou En--lai is less visible, but there is no
 evidence that he's in trouble.  Chen Yi continues to carry out his Foreign
 Minister duties in the face of Red Guard attacks.
 D.  Internal failure hidden behind anti-foreign actions?  Peking mobs demon-
 strate against the personnel and installations of eight foreign countries,
 four Communist and four non-Communist, including physical abuse and property
 damage in a number of cases (see details in subsequent chronology).  A
 June 15 Tillman Durdin dispatch from Hong Kong to the NYTIMLS cites "politi-
 cal observers here" as interpreting these "xenophobic demonstrations as
 exercises in self-stiumulation and a substitute for achievement," used "to
 divert national attention from somber internal conditions and to keep stu-
 dents who are out of school and other revolutionary partisans in Peking
 excited and busy."  Communist media also take this line:  see Mongolian

 imperialism and Soviet revisionism....  The Indian people cannot build

 the reactionary Congress rule and smash this man-eating social system....
 At a time when the Indian people's struggle against Congress rule

 May 21-June 8                           The May 21 melee at the Ulan Bator
 railway station is inflamed to a major Mongolian-Chinese clas, with govern-
 ment notes and media exchanging mutual recriminations of provocation, abuse,
 and physical violence, and with anti-Mongolian demonstrations in Peking.
 PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator on the 27th carries the attack to extremes of
 vituperation:
 "Tsedenbal and his like are a handful of spineless sycophants
 at the beck and call of their masters.  They fawn on the Soviet revi-
 sionist ruling clique, cringe before them in the most servile manner,
 and sell out lock, stock and barrel the state sovereignty and national
 interests of Mongolia...."
 The last word on the subject to come to our attention is a June 8 article
 by UNEN's Commentator:
 "... Their vile attacks and filthy slander on socialist countries,
 including the MPH, exposes the true face of the present Chinese leader-
 ship, the face of great-power chauvinists and petty-bourgeois adven-
 turists....  explained by a wish to conceal from the Chinese people
 the bankruptcy of their adventurist policy, to distract the people
 from the serious situation at home...."                               50X1-HUM
 May 22--27                                            The Soviet regime's diffi-
 culties in coping with rising intellectual ferment and demand for freedom
 by its writers are strikingly illustrated by developments of this period:
 -- Published accounts of the 4th Congress of the Union of Soviet Writers
 indicate that it generally  continued in bland conformity with the Party
 line as set forth in Demichev's opening message, with the single exception
 of Cossack Sholokhov's free-wheeling  diatribe.  However, subsequent reports
 state that the record was heavily edited to eliminate evidence of bitter
 controversy, especially over the question of literary freedom and the harsh
 treatment of Sinyavsky and Daniel.  PRAVDA's text of the Sholokhov speech,
 although strictly "Party-line" and repeatedly denouncing those within and
 without who call for literary freedom:   (a) deplores "the open desire of
 our writers' leadership to conduct this Congress by avoiding sharp corners
 at all cost";  (b) expresses concern that the average age of delegates is
 near 60 and that ''abnormal mutual relations have developed with part of the
 young writers"; and  (c) regrets the pointed absence (in Italy) of senior
 journalist Ilya Ehrenburg and implies that others have boycotted the Con-
 gress.  The Western press gives heavy play to the following passage:
 "Recently. quite a few voices have been heard in the West militating
 for 'creative freedom' for us, Soviet Writers.  These self-invited
 fans also include the CIA and some Messrs. Senators, inveterate White
 Guarde, the turncoat Alliluyeva _, and the not unknown Kerensky, who
 became a political corpse long ago.  Look, into what amazing company
 our zealots of freedom of the press are falling.

 French novelist Lanoux makes the most direct reference to the Sinyavsky-
 Daniel case (after Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Aragon boycotted the Congress
 .on this issue) -- '"Recent steps taken in this country have rejoiced your
 enemies and greatly disturbed your friends.  Maybe it was a personal affair,
 but you must realize that literature belongs to the whole world."  -- but
 Soviet media omit this in their reporting.  The Congress and media also
 ignore a written message of greeting by American playwright Lillian Hellman
 who attended the opening session:  it called for literary freedom and open
 discussion of problems.
 --- PRAVDA's report of the Sholokhov speech is the first Soviet media reference
 to Svetlana's defection since the brief March 13 TASS note that she had
 gone to India, but it triggers a series of subsequent attacks:   (a) in an
 across-the-board May 27 PRAVDA editorial denunciation of U.S. "anti-Soviet
 provocations" ("... the Soviet citizen S. Alleluyeva, who was first taken
 by CIA agents from India to Switzerland and then recently brought to the
 U.S., is being used for the same unseemly purposes.'");  (b) May 31 KOMSO-
 MOLSKAYA PRAVDA's reprint of French CP's attack in May 28 L'HUMANITE DIMANCHE,
 with KP's own preface; and  (c) three articles in June 7 LITERATURNAYA
 GAZETA, one original, signed "Valentin 008," and reprints of one from the
 French NOUVEAU CANDIDE and an Art Buchwald satire from NYPOST.
 - A notable absentee from the 4th Congress was Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who
 became famous overnight in 1962 with publication of his account of life in
 a Stalin forced-labor camp:  it was reported that he had addressed a message
 to the Congress which was circulating unofficially among delegates.  On
 May 31, Paris daily LE MONDE publishes the text of this message (NYTIMES
 has English translation June 5).  In it, he denounces "the oppression, no
 longer tolerable, that our literature has been enduring from censorship,"
 reveals that he has been prevented from publishing the last 3 years, and
 charges that the State Security Committee (KGB, the secret police) confis-
 cated some of his writings and his files in 1965 and that this material is
 now being used in a campaign to defame him.  He lists 24 outstanding Russian
 writers whose works have been barred in some way in the Soviet Union, many
 of whom were persecuted and perished in prison camps, and reminds the Union
 of its constitutional duty to protect and defend the rights of its members.
 Westerb correspondents in Moscow in the next few days report a joint letter
 to the Union signed by some 80 prominent Soviet writers endorsing the Sol-
 zhenitsyn appeal and calling for a public discussion of the evils of literary
 censorship.
 --- Moscow's two most famous young "rebel" poets, Yevtushenko and Voznesensky,
 figure prominently in the current turmoil.  Y. was on a lone, free-wheeling
 tour of Spain and Portugal before the Congress, and was last reported seen
 in Lisbon May 16.  TASS May 23 includes his name among several members who
 returned from foreign travels" in time for the Congress, but he not sub-
 sequently reported or seen attending:  moreover, Reuters and UPI reporting
 on the above item state that Y. had cabled his support of the Solzhenitsyn
 appeal.  V. did attend the Congress but reportedly signed the joint letter
 supporting the appeal:  at the close of our period he is forced to cancel
 out of a June 21 engagement to read his poetry at NY's Lincoln Center Summer
 Festival, cabling the New York sponsors: "can't come.''

 May 23:   The 147th anniversary of the Indonesian CP (PKI) is commemorated
 variously by Moscow, Peking and Hanoi.  The latter, in a NHAN DAN May 23
 article, lauds the PKI ("a main patriotic force in I.'), deplores the per-
 secution and massacre of I. Communists by "the I. reactionary forces," and
 "urges the I. authorities to set free" those still detained and "give up
 their policy of terrorism and repression."  Pekin  r ives low-key publicity
 highlighted by a May 28 account of a meeting of the Federation of I. Stu-
 dents in China addressed by Supeno, "a member of the PKI/CC delegation in
 the CPR," who declared that the PKI would"lead a people's war from country-
 side against the cities until all I. is conquered."  Radio Moscow to I. on
 the 23rd admits that "a number of PKI leaders violated the political line
 laid down by the Party program" but argues that the Party "cannot bear
 responsibility if errors are committed by individual leaders."
 May 23, 29, 30:  Chinese media try to incite Communist- led revolution in
 the Philippines.  Radio Peking in Tagalog on the 23rd broadcasts a purported
 "Statement by the Philippines CP" which "promises to launch a life-and-
 death struggle'" against the American imperialists, their reactionary allies
 within the country, and the Soviet-led modern revisionists.  NCNA on the
 29th reports that "'the P. People's Liberation Army led by the P. CP (PKP)
 has recently stepped up the guerrilla warfare on Luzon Island and has scored
 one victory after another."  Next day Peking broadcasts a similar report in
 Tagalog and a PEOPLE'S DAILY commentary greets it as "heartening news."  It
 concludes that "the P. revolutionary people will certainly win final victory
 after protracted arduous struggles if, armed with Mao Tse-tung's thought,
 they fight a people's war, establish revolutionary base areas, and encircle
 the cities from the countryside."

 -- A May 23 Soviet Govt statement which cites Israel's war-like moves,
 with "the direct and indirect encouragement... from certain imperialist
 circles which seek to bring back colonial oppression to Arab lands," and
 asserts flatly that:
 "Should anyone try to unleash aggression in the Near East he would
 meet not only with the united strength of Arab countries but also with
 strong opposition to aggression from the S.U. and all peace-loving
 states...."

 ""U.S.imperialism is at present hatching a big plot of aggression
 against Syria, the UAR and other Arab states by making use of Israel..
 The Soviet revisionist leading clique (SRLC) is the number one
 accomplice of U.S. imperialism...  Once again it is colluding with
 U.S. and British imperialism, busily working to strike a political
 deal with them and actively peddling its sinister ware of the 'Tash-
 kent spirit' in a vain attempt to sabotage the just cause of the Arab
 people....  The Arab people ... will surely recognize the SRLC in all
 its ugliness as a betrayer of the interests of the Arab people and will
 never be taken in by it....`
 -?- NEW TIMES May 31 (after the UAR closes the Gulf of Aqaba) denounces, along
 with "imperialist provocateurs who would like to aggravate the crisis,"
 "the Chinese leaders, who call themselves 'sincere friends' of the Arab
 nations, while at the same time urging them to 'fan the flames of struggle'
 in the Near East."
 -- PEOPLE'S DAILY June 2 strikes back at the NEW TINES article "virulently
 attacking China," calling it "babbling nonsense."
 -- On June 6, the day after the armed conflict began, the SovGovt issues a
 fairly restrained statement condemning Israel for initiating aggression,
 blaming no one else for complicity, declaring "its resolute support for the
 govts and peoples" of the Arab states, demanding that Israel "stop immediately
 and unconditionally its military actions" and "pull back its troops beyond
 the truce line."  In contrast, the Chinese Govt statement same day declares:
 "The SRLC has connived at the aggression committed by Israel at the insti-
 gation and with the support of U.S. imperialism, thus once again revealing
 its ugly features as a betrayer of the Arab people."  As for support, it
 says:
 "The Chinese Govt hereby solemnly declares: Armed with Mao Tse-
 tung's thought, the 700 million Chinese people who are victoriously
 carrying on the GPCR absolutely will not allow the U.S. imperialists
 and their collaborators to ride roughshod and commit aggression every-
 where.                            We firmly stand on the side of the Arab people and resolutely
 support them in their just war against U.S.-Israeli aggression.  Vic-
 tory will surely belong to the heroic fighting Arab people!"
 PEOPLE'S DAILY same day goes much further:
 "U.S. imperialism and its lackey have unleashed a war of aggres-
 sion....  British imperialism is also an accomplice....  The SRRC is
 again playing the shameful role of number one accomplice....  A large
 number of Soviet war vessels havesteamed into the eastern Mediterranean,
 exchanging fraternal greetings with the warships of the U.S. 6th Fleet
 on the high seas....  The SRC is bent on stamping out the flames of
 the Arab people's just struggle in collusion with U.S. and British
 imperialism.  Its act of betrayal has added greatly to the aggressive
 arrogance of Israel...."

 Indicative of the conflicting -pressures on many CPs with sizable Jewish
 membership is the vacuous June 6 statement by CPUSA GenSecy Gus Hall, as
 reported by TASS:
 "Whatever one's views on the crisis in the Middle East may be,
 there can be only one conclusion regarding the military struggle
 which has erupted between Israel and the Arab states.  It is a wrong
 war.  It is a war which benefits only the U.S. and British oil monopolies
 and no one else...."
 And AP London reports on June 18 that the British CP's endorsement of
 Moscow's position  "resulted in many resignations of Jewish members."
 -- A June 9 Moscow summit of the chiefs of 7 European Communist countries
 (Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Rumania, and
 Yugoslavia) and the USSR produces a joint statement along the lines of the
 June 6 Soviet statement --- which Rumania refuses to sign, -- although Tito
 does,his first _~oint action with the Soviet Bloc since his split in 191+8.
 Next day, the USSR, and Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia break relations with
 Israel (allegedly because the latter ignored the UN Security Council call
 for a cease-fire) followed by E. Germany, Poland, and Hungary on the 12th;
 and Yugoslavia on the 13th:  Rumania refrains from taking the step.  The
 premiers of these (except non-member E. Germany),  including Rumania (and
 Mongolia) follow Kosygin to N.Y. for the Soviet-initiated UN General Assembly
 session beginning the 19th.
 On June 11, as the shooting inthe Mideast had practically ended, PEOPLE'S
 DAILY front-pages a call to-the Arabs to renew their fighting, citing Mao's
 dictum:  "fight, fail, fight again, fail again, fight again ... til. their
 victory...."  Again branding the Soviets as "a false and treacherous friend''
 which had "Jointly plotted the frantic Israeli attack" with the U.S. as a
 "`political maneuver to trap the Arab countries," PD declares that the Soviets
 were ""secretly flirting with I. while publicly condemning it, stating that
 "a Soviet vessel was the first ship to pass the Gulf of Aqaba" after I.
 took command of the Tiran Straits.
 'J The Soviet revisionist clique is a heinous %rindler specializing
 in double-dealings, the worst traitor to the Arab people, in collusion
 with U.S. and British imperialism, a hangman suppressing the Arab

 Beginning June 7, massive demonstrations of hundreds of thousands in
 Peking denounce the Soviet revisionists as well as the imperialists.  TASS

 the Chinese "take measures to insure conditions necessary for the  normal
 work and security of Soviet representatives in China."
 -- IZVESTIYA begins a counters-attack in a Petrov article on June 12: Peking's
 declarations about its readiness to send the entire Chinese population of
 700 million as armed assistance to the Arabs are an utter absurdity not to
 be taken seriously because of geographical, transport, or military consider-
 ations.  The calls from Peking are either a provocation of politicians or a
 cry of despair from frightened-to-death petit-bourgeois who do not believe
 in the final victory of the liberation movement.  Radio "Peace and Progress'`
 to Asia on the 14th again brands the reference to 700 million Chinese sup-
 porters as "sheer nonsense" and asks:  "if it were so simple to send 700
 million people to the other end of the world, then why did Peking not send
 them to Indonesia or Vietnam which are much nearer?" It goes on to brand
 "the call to employ nuclear weapons in the Near East "as" nothing less than
 a criminal venture."
 -- An interesting Communist effort to explain the reasons for the Arab
 defeat was made in a Radio "P & P" broadcast to in English Asia June 13:
 "First of all, it is necessary to denounce as imperialist lies
 and slander that claim that the reason for the defeat was the social
 and economic transformations which were carried out in the progressive
 Arab countries...:"
 The Israeli forces represented a well-trained army of educated
 men, equipped with modern weapons....  The Arab armies were also
 equipped with modern weapons....
 However, if we examine the ranks of the Arab armies, we shall see
 that they are composed of peasants, most of them with faulty education,
 not always able to make the best of modern weapons, not always under-
 standing the significance of the social and economic transformations
 taking place in their country.  This was the big difference...."
 Algerian dictator Boumedienne flies to Moscow for secret talks June 12-

 in Yiddish to North America describes increasing Rumanian-Israeli trade rela-
 tions, especially the agreements concluded during April 9-16 talks.  Rumanian
 Party daily SCINTEIA June 13 commentary by "V. Iliescu" avoids placing
 blame for the Near East fighting on either side and urges the necessity "to
 proceed in everything from the existing realities created as a consequence
 of the social and political evolution of the postwar world, and from the
 need of coexistence and cooperation between the Arab states and the state
 of Israel....   On the l 6th, Rumania announces its offer to the UAR of
 immediate delivery of 50,000 tons of wheat, and 15,000 tons of corn, with
 `'conditions of payment to be established later," plus unspecified food to
 Syria.
 -- A _Cuban Govt declaration made public June 7 denounces the UNSC cease-
 fire resolution, adopted with Soviet support, as a "scandalous capitula-
 tion." Public criticism of the Soviet course is reported by AP Cairo on
 June 10, and AL AHRAM is mildly critical on the 12th: next day, however, it
 charges "certain imperialist circles" with furthering "an intentional,
 premeditated, anti-Soviet campaign."  And Reuters reports from Warsaw on
 the 19th that Gomulka attacked some Polish Jews who "applauded Israel's
 victory and even organized drinking parties to celebrate it."
 NCNA  June 16, on the basis of press reports, accuses the Soviets of
 "taking advent  e of the oil embargoes carried out by the Arab countries
 against U.S. and British imperialism to sell its own oil to West European
 countries, thus sabotaging the Arab oil embargo and making profits in its
 own egoistic interest."  TASS June 19 distributes a statement by Soviet
 Foreign Trade Minister Patolichev describing as "'sheer fabrication' the re-
 ports in the Western press that the S.U. is trying to take the place of the
 Arab countries in the oil market," the purpose of which is "to sow doubt in
 Arab countries about the position of their sincere friend, the S.U."  He
 also asserts that the USSR sells no 'oil or oil products to Israel.
 May 23 and continuing:  In addition to the heavy new barrage on the theme of
 betrayal of the Arabs, as described above, Chinese media attack the Soviet
 revisionists heavily on other old and new subjects throughout the period:
 collusion with the U.S. in many fields, with Japan, and with India; degenera-
 tion toward capitalism; a new characterization of the CPSU leaders as "red
 compradors" pursuing an "open door policy toward foreign monopoly capital,"
 etc.  They also produced their first attempt at "Kremlinology" -- the first

 NORTH VIETNAM'S TREATMENT OF POWs
 The 12 June repatriation of 39 North Vietnamese sick
 and wounded prisoners by the South Vietnamese government provides an
 opportunity to keep attention focused on Hanoi's refusal to permit the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to inspect North Vietnam's
 prison camps and its failure to repatriate sick and wounded U.S. pris-
 oners.   Although American POWs in North Vietnamese prisons probably
 'total over 300, it is difficult to estimate with any precision because
 Hanoi has refused to provide the ICRC with definitive lists of the pris-
 oners and because the limited number of foreign journalists and others
 permitted to "interview" U.S. fliers had no opportunity to visit the prison
 camps but have talked with, or seen the POWs only under constant guard
 in pre-selected rooms in Hanoi.   The strictly controlled nature of the
 so-called interviews and the sometimes eerie behavior of the U.S. air-
 men has led even observers unfriendly to the U.S. to question the type
 of treatment Hanoi is giving American prisoners and has raised the
 specter of brainwashing -- at least in the broad sense that coercion
 was used to obtain statements.
 Despite Hanoi's claim that it treats the prisoners "humanely," it
 continues to refuse offers by the ICRC and other neutral observers to
 visit the prisoners.   Hanoi has not even allowed the designation of a
 Protecting Power for the prisoners -- a non-belligerent agreeable to all
 belligerents to serve as a mediator in matters concerning prisoners.
 Hanoi has not only failed to repatriate seriously sick and wounded POWs
 but has declined to meet with the ICRC to discuss the matter.   Most of
 the POWs are not permitted to send or receive mail as required by the      50X1-HUM
 Geneva Conventions.

 THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY. YEAR OF
 THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION:  The Year
 IThe Kremlin's hopes for improving its image abroad and
 enhancing the regime's prestige and leadership at home during the 50th
 Anniversary Year have been deflated by lackluster pre-Anniversary events,
 unexpected developments, accumulated unsolved problems, and political
 uncertainty.   The burden of the over-all adverse situation is such that,
 at the least, this year's celebrations will probably be considerably
 constrained.
 Soviet Preparations and Objectives:   On 1 July 1965 the Soviet regime
 began a campaign to prepare for the celebration on 7 November 1967 of the
 50th Anniversary of the October* Revolution.   On 4 January 1967 the Central
 Committee of the CPSU accelerated this campaign by widely publicizing an
 8,500-word resolution on "Preparations for 50th Anniversary of Great
 October Socialist Revolution."   (See extensive excerpts attached).   The
 resolution, a poorly written piece, made extravagant claims of Soviet
 achievements, omitted large portions of Soviet history in its survey,
 and virtually ignored the existence of contemporary problems.   As expected,
 the resolution called for a series of events and a press campaign to build
 up enthusiasm for the celebration, and exhorted Soviet citizens to express
 their patriotism and to work hard to increase the'economic and military
 might of the USSR.
 Fulfillment of the program to date:   A survey of the Soviet press shows
 that the resolution has been obeyed:   all media have chimed in to urge
 greater effort, to preach tighter discipline and, implicit :y,   to forget
 the past and look ahead.
 *Called the October Revolution because, according to the old Russian
 calendar, 7 November 1917 fell on 25 October.

 A series of gatherings for Soviet and international groups have
 taken place or are scheduled. On 28-31 March, for example, a "scientific"
 conference on the international significance of the October :Revolution
 was held in Moscow.
 Other: Gatherings, past and future, include:   On 1.7-19 April, a national
 scientific-theoretical." conference in Leningrad to discuss "Great
 October -- the triumph of Leninis theory of the socialist` revolution;"
 on 22-27 May, in Moscow, The Fourth Soviet Writers Congress, the announced
 concern of which was to be the 50th Anniversary of the October Revolu-
 tion and "the role of Soviet literature in its pelebration",(see below);
 in late  July in Leningrad, an international - outh congress t    e
 the 50th Anniversary  ear.                                                            50X1-HUM
 The effect of the pre-Anniversary meeting and of the press campaign
 cannot be ascertained.  It is noteworthy, however, that a1; two international
 meetings, strong and possibly major emphasis was given to propaganda themes
 attacking the Chinese Communists and calling for an international congress,
 probably at the expense of the planned discussion of the October Revolu-
 tion.  Also noteworthy, though hardly unexpected, is the virtual absence
 in the Soviet press of evidence that the Soviet, people are entering into
 a genuinely joyful, festive spirit in observation of the 50th Anniversary
 of CPSU rule.
 Other events believed to have been scheduledin conjunction with the
 Anniversary include space feats, such as the Venus shots and the test
 flight of a new space ship.   The latter feat, which ended in the tragic
 death of Col.     Komarov, is generally thought to have been the first
 on the schedule of a series of manned space shots; the balance of the
 -series has now, apparently been cancelled.
 Unforeseen Developm ents:  If the Kremlin is not,exud n; optimism and
 fueling its Anniversary celebrations with cheerful bulletins, the explan-
 ation may well be largely in the unusual events which ha`7e blackened the
 'Soviet calendar so far in 1967.
 First, the early March defection of Svetlana Alliluyeva (nee Stalin)
 which, though played down in the Soviet press for more than two months,
 when seriously finally shaken. surfaced gave ringing 24 April Apr eviil (coinciding nci that ding the re Mmewithgand adversely

 an expression of deep disaffection by many Soviet writers.   (See Chronology).
 Fourth, the recent Mideast crisis, which delivered such a blow to Soviet
 prestige that no amount of Soviet bluster and propaganda can conceal its
 seriousness.
 Prospects for the balance of the Anniversary  ear:-  The uninspiring
 nature of the Central Committee resolution of   January, the absence of
 evidence that the objectives of the resolution are being carried out
 effectively, and the effects of the above-cited unforeseen developments
 combine to indicate that the Kremlin's hopes for a,'joyous Anniversary
 celebration have been considerably dampened.  To these reasons there may
 be added an accumulation of gnawing unresolved problems and the reported
 political divisions at the top levels of Soviet leadership.
 The unresolved problems include the allocation of economic resources,
 the relationship of the military to the political leadership, the direc-
 tion and speed of economic change, and the ever-present question of how
 to deal with Stalinism.   (See summaries of these problems, attached).
 The most obvious of these problems, that concerning economic allocations,
 is seen in the failure to prepare and ratify the present five-year plan,
 which covers the period started 1 January 1966.   The 112-year delay now
 almost equals the time by which the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955)
 was delayed; it is interesting to note that that plan was interfered
 with by the substantial demands placed on the Soviet economy by the
 Korean War and by the uncertainties that war created.
 The existence of significant political divisions among USSR leaders
 has been suspected by Kremlinologists for some time.   Recent reports by
 Harry Schwartz of the NEW YORK TIMES (NYT 28 May) and AP Moscow corres-
 pondent Henry Bradsher (WASHINGTON POST 12 June) have surface some of the
 rampant speculation.   Schwartz discerns three basic factions headed by:
 Kosygin and Podgorny (liberal); Suslov and Shelepin (conservative-
 reactionary); Brezhnev (alternating between the two extremes).   These
 factions are, according to Schwartz, engaged in disputes over a broad
 range of policy issues which he discusses.   Bradsher reports from Moscow
 that observers believes the Soviet Union's collective leadership may be
 shaken up early next year.   He emphasizes the significance of economic
 indecision.   The Schwartz and Bradsher articles are attached.
 The prospects, in summary, are that the Kremlin will have to over-
 come some rather substantial obstacles or else, as now appears likely,
 the 50th Anniversary celebration will be a constrained affair.

 COMMUNIST REACTION TO ARAB-ISRAELI CRISIS
 .Bloc Countries
 From the start of the Arab-Israeli crisis, bloc officials excepting
 Rumanians,have supported the Soviets in condemning Israel as an aggres-
 sor against her Arab neighbors.   Rumania refused to sign the trumped up
 declaration which Moscow had prepared for the quickly called summit in
 Moscow on 9 June.   The Rumanian government was reportedly offended at
 being called to Moscow to sign an already.prepared declaration without
 benefit of prior consultation.   Reporting from various sources (summarized
 below) indicates that public opinion in most of these bloc countries
 strongly disagrees with the official government position.
 Yugoslavia
 Pres. Tito's strong support of the Arab cause has evoked the most
 open disapproval of any foreign policy issue in several years.  Many
 Yugoslavs identify themselves with the Israelis whom they consider the
 underdogs and express satisfaction with Israeli successes.   There has
 apparently been official disagreement over Tito's policy, but no evidence
 that he will fail to get support for his endeavors even though the Fed-
 eral Executive Council has met twice on the Mideast situation without
 issuing a statement in support of his policy.
 At a foreign affairs debate in the Sejm, several deputies spoke out
 against breaking diplomatic relations with Israel.   One deputy stated it
 would be a shameful act for a country in which so many Jews had been
 murdered.   Newspapers, radio, and TV stations have reportedly been
 swamped with angry telephone calls protesting the government's action
 and "false" reporting.  Jewish newspapermen came-under particularly
 strong attack for their anti-Israeli articles.
 On June 19, Party Chief Gomulka denounced those Poles who welcomed
 the Israeli victory over the Arabs.   He said:   "We do not wish a fifth
 column to be created in our country....   We cannot remain indifferent
 towards people who, in face of a threat to world peace-hence also to the
 security of Poland and the peaceful work of the Polish nation - express
 their support for the aggressor and the disturbance of peace.... We
 take the position that all Polish citizens should have one fatherland:
 People's Poland.... Let those who feel that those words are addressed
 to them draw the proper conclusions."  The Associated Press reported
 that the subsequently published official text omitted the fifth column
 reference and added the comment that "The huge majority of Polish citizens
 of Jewish nationality share the one fatherland position."  This speech
 was obviously aimed at Polish Jews and Gomulka's well-known anti-Semitic
 feelings must leave Jews in the Polish Communist Party in a vulnerable
 position.

 Czechoslovakia
 The contrast between the official position and public attitudes
 was highlighted by the unprecedented number of comments conveyed to
 westerners during the crisis period.  These included outspokenly pro-
 Israeli comments by workers and middle level managers of various mining
 communities, a virtually unanimous anti-regime attitude on the part of
 students and faculty at Cha:^les University and the refusal of many stu-
 dents to participate in demonstrations before the US and UK embassies.
 Speeches of senior faculty members in a, recent :meeting at the Prague
 Military Academy displayed a markedly pro-Israel attitude.   President
 Novotny's strident speech a-: Lidice on June 1.1 seems to have provoked
 normally disenchanted Czechs to view even more skeptically their leaders'
 pronouncements on foreign policy.  Many people felt he debased the Li-
 dice Anniversary and stated that his attacks on the US as an aggressor
 in the Middle East were totally baseless.
 Other reports indicate that Czech trade officials are displeased
 with their governments position, being afraid exports of certain goods
 to America and Canada will be affected as Jewish merchants are their
 largest purchasers.
 Rumani a
 A Rumanian diplomat stated that the position. his country has taken
 in the Arab-Israeli conflict has evoked great Soviet displeasure and the
 Soviets have charged Rumania with breaching socialist solidarity.   He
 stated:   "They just can't understand our right to take such a position
 if we feel, as we do, that it is in our national interest".
 Another Rumanian compared Israel's position to that of ]Finland in
 the 1939-40 Winter War.   He admitted that it was difficult to maintain
 an impartial stand in the face of tremendous Soviet and Arab pressure.
 He confided that the Rumanian position had been covertly praised by
 several bloc officials.   He maintained that the Soviet vote for a weak
 UN resolution after its pugnacious attitude toward Israel made the USSR
 an object of ridicule.
 To judge from the apathetic demonstrations in front of the US and
 UK embassies, Soviet citizens simply did not have their hearts in the
 exercise.   The apathy may be partly due to the fact that the Arabs have
 never been popular in the Soviet Union.  Many citizens are resentful of
 the large amounts of aid invested in Arab countries and feel that the
 money should be used at home.
 There are also three million Jews in the USSR, many of whom are
 sympathetic to the Israeli cause.  An Israeli diplomat indicated that

 his Embassy had received telephone calls from Soviet citizens, wishing
 them well.   A Jewish Soviet citizen indicated that thousands would volun-
 teer to fight for Israel if they could.
 Bloc Journalists
 Several bloc journalists stationed in Western countries have indi-
 cated they disagree with their countries' policies and are using various
 pretexts to avoid filing stories on the Arab-Israeli conflict and the
 discussions before the UN.   Jewish bloc newsmen have indicated sensi-
 tivity over having to write anti-Israeli articles and are afraid that
 speeches such as Gomulka's will unleash a wave of anti-Semitism in
 East European countries.
 A Cuban diplomat in a Western country said his government was dis-
 gusted with Soviet failure to support the Arabs.   He stated that his
 country realized that the Soviet Union would not help Cuba in any con-
 frontation with the United States any more than it had helped the Arabs.
 Western Europe
 Italy
 Luigi Longo's initial all-out support of the Soviet Arab position
 brought severe criticism from such membeis as Umberto Terracini, a
 Jewish member of the PCI Directorate who recently visited Israel and is
 reported to have sent a letter to an Israeli paper which denounced the
 Arab states.   Some party "liberals" even accused the Soviets of inciting
 the Arabs.
 In Turin and Rome local Communist committees issued strong state-
 ments of support for Israel.   Longo is reported to have said that the
 party position was very unpopular and had caused an enormous upsurge of
 anti-Soviet feeling at all levels both because of the Sovet's black and
 white approach to Israel and because many militants felt that the Soviets
 let the Arabs down.   Longo felt that the PCI had an obligation to the
 CPSU to help prevent collapse of Soviet prestige in the Middle East.
 The strong pro-Soviet statement by Party Secretary Waldek Rochet
 has been very unpopular within the PCF and has almost ruptured its alli-
 ance with the Left Federation.   Leftist intellectuals such as Jean Paul
 Sartre, Pablo Picasso, Piere Mendes-France and many others have signed
 petitions giving total support to Israel.   Guy Mollet castigated the
 PCF position calling L'Humanite's editorial "preposterous" and rebutted
 UAR arguments on which Soviet Union has publicly based its support for
 Arabs.

 The two elements of the PCB have taken opposing stands on the Near
 East crisis.  The orthodox PCB INFORMATIONS contained a remarkably pro-
 Israel line while the pro-Chinese Grippist(CF has gone beyond the Soviet
 stand and even accused the Soviets of appeasement.
 Austria
 VOLKSSTIMME, official organ of the KPOe called for an immediate
 ceasefire in tones of neutrality and compromise.   One :report states that
 seven Austrian Communists had signed a resolution on "Israel's right to
 exist."
 Spain
 While party leadership seems to support the, Soviets, rank and file
 seem to have different: reactions ranging from sympathy for Israel.to
 antipathy towards Nasser, who is considered a fascist, and criticism of
 the Soviets for letting the Arabs down.
 Brazil                             Latin America
 Many PCB intellectuals support Israel.  At least two are known to
 have signed a pro-Israel manifesto.   The Arab-Israeli conflict is viewed
 by some as being confrontation between US and USSR.   Someee members feel
 the USSR failed the Arabs i:a1their hour of crisis and the USSR has lost
 prestige as a consequence.
 Panama
 A well-known leftist politican bitterly criticized the Soviets for
 their poor performance and especially for inferior arms they shipped
 to Mideast.   The CP cautioned the politician,  against taking such an
 anti-Soviet line.
 An official of the Socialist Party issued a statement condemning
 Israel without consulting the PS leadership.    This statement was pub-
 lished by both Communist EL SIGLO and Socialist ULTIMA HORA.  The state-
 ment brought irate protests from PS members and was later amended.   Pro-
 Cuban Socialist leader Allende defended the Tni-Continental statement
 and said it condemned 3srae_Li government for its pro-imperialist policies
 but did not advocate annihilation of one state by another.

 appear divided over question, some in open sympathy with Israel.
 Argentina
 The PCA is highly concerned about the effect Soviet position will
 have on Jewish members of the Party.       It is afraid many will defect and
 wealthy Jewish sympathizers will withdraw financial support.  The PCA
 has been trying to persuade members that the Soviets are supporting UAR
 because it is anti-imperialist.
 A bloc diplomat said that 3000 Argentines have volunteered for
 service in Israel, including members and functionaries of the PCA.   He
 stated this could be explained by the fact that a number of top func-
 tionaires are Jews who believe that Israel has a right to exist and that
 development of the Israeli state has been supported by the entire pro-
 gressive world.
 Uruguay
 The Anti-Israeli position taken by the party and the Soviets is
 causing strong   reaction.   The party is afraid of losing a valuable
 source of income from wealthy Jewish sympathizers.   It hopes to counter-
 act this by propagating the line that the US is interested in gaining
 control over Arab oil supplies and Israeli war is part of US policy for
 instigating "local wars".
 Middle East
 Egypt
 The managing editor of AL AKHBAR stated that he would like to have
 poisoned the leaders of "a big power which he believed was a friendly
 state which would support us" as well as the leaders of Israel, the US,
 and the UK.   He chided USSR by name in a later editorial.   Voice of the
 Arabs broadcast warned listerners not to depend on the East or West.
 AL AKHBAR moderated its tone later and LA ALHRAM of 13 June noted that
 the USSR had extended "colonssal economic and military aid" to the Arabs
 and that "reactionary circles" were trying to alienate the two.
 Lebanon
 The CP initially gave mild approval to role of USSR in war.
 Reportedly Kamal Jumblatt, leader of the Progressive Socialist Party,
 and front groups rebuked the Soviet Ambassador in Beirut for lack of
 Soviet support.   The pro-Chinese organization issued a pamphlet attack-
 ing the USSR as a partner of Anglo-American imperialism.
 Syria
 The CP of Syria emphasized the large amount of Soviet support to
 Arab countries.   The ruling Ba'ath Party line seems to have varied.   One

 newspaper queried why USSR had not stopped Anglo-American intervention
 while another emphasized how the "socialist camp", especially the USSR,
 stood by the Arabs "during the battle".
 Iraq
 The government controlled press and radio in Baghdad made little.
 comment on the Soviets in the Arab-Israeli conflict.   The CP of Iraq's
 Voice of the Iraqi :People broadcasts, originating in East Germany,
 initially paid scant attention to-the Soviets while a later broadcast
 stressed the great amount of political, economic and military aid the
 "socialist camp" has furnished the Arabs and noted that "imperialists,
 Zionists, and reactionary agents" were maneuvering to weaken Arab-Soviet
 friendship.
 Israel
 No CP statement has been noted since the outbreak of hostilities.
 On 3 June Dr. Moshe Sneh, Pro-Soviet leader of one fact_Lor',. of Party,
 issued a strong condemnation of Arabs, defended Israel's right to exist
 as an independent nation, and said the people of Israel are determined
 to fight for their country.   The anti-Zionist element of the Party
 stressed the "aggressive nature of Israeli policy" in contrast with the
 Soviet "policy of peace."
 South Asia
 India
 The CP India (right) praised the USSR as "the guarantor of the
 sovereignty of peoples standing guard against the neo-colonialist offen-
 sive of US imperialism."  The CP (left) generally sympathized with the
 Arabs, although it singled out the "Israeli working class" for its warm
 sympathy.
 Ceylon
 The pro-Moscow wing of the CP in its newspaper FORWARD of 14 June
 replayed a pre-crisis statement of the leader of the anti.-Zionist CP
 Israel which called for a change in Israel's imer:i_alist  orientation.
 The newspaper feebly reported there were two Communist parties in Israel?
 Pakistan
 Newspapers have generally followed an anti-Soviet line on the Arab-
 Israeli war.   KOHISTAN (Rawalpindi.) accused the Soviets of collusion
 with the US and the Karachi newspaper HURRIYAT indicted the Soviets
 for betraying the Arabs.   The PAKISTAN TIMES stated that "China has
 replaced the Soviet Union as the advocate of  just  causes and friends of
 victims of aggression."

 Indonesia
 Indonesian Communists feel that the Soviets suffered a defeat in the
 Mideast and are pleased, yet they regret Nasser's loss as he was useful
 to the progressive forces.   They felt the war was engineered by the
 imperialists and revisionists (Soviets) to remove world attention from
 Vietnam.
 Africa
 Nigeria
 The Socialist Workers and Farmers Party (SWFP -- the Nigerian CP)
 Secretary General Otegbeye said on 14 June that he and most members of
 his party were elated over the Israeli victory over the Arabs.  He des-
 cribed Nasser and other Arab leaders as "Fascists" who persecuted Commu-
 nists and furthermore Nasser had always supported the reactionary Muslims
 in the northern region of Nigeria.  Another Central Committee member
 stated that the Party would refrain from publicly criticizing Nasser as
 all Communist activities in Nigeria are funded by the Soviet Union or
 other bloc countries.
 The CP of Sudan has been critical of the Soviet Union and the
 socialist bloc.  SCP Secretary General stated that the position of
 Socialist countries cannot'. be explained  by any "reasonable revolu-
 tionary."
 The SCP made the following decisions:   (a) to contact. Soviets and other
 socialist countries and demand decisive intervention to save Arab social-
 ism, and (b) to work to direct the masses' anger against the USA and
 the UK in order to divert their attention from their discontent with the
 socialist countries until these countries rectify their stand.

 GENEVA, May 19-'The lead-
 ers of the International Red
 Cross appealed today to all
 sides in the war in Vietnam to
 assure  "proper and humane
 treatment"' of Prisoners and to
 conclude a cease-fire to end the
 civilian population's "intolera-
 ble burden of human misery."
 The appeal was made by the
 presidents of the three central
 bodies of the International Red
 Cross as concern mounted in the
 United States over the fate of
 downed pilots and other Amer-'
 leans held prisoner by Northi
 Vietnam and the Vietcong.
 In a seven-point statement,
 the Red Cross officials 'lilso
 urged the- warring par ties" to
 'refrain from all deliberate at-
 tacks upon innocent civilians in
 Vietnam, whether by aerial or
 ground weapons, or by torture
 or wanton murder."
 They asked that every effort
 be made to avoid causing death
 or injury to civilians during all
 ground, air and naval opera-
 tions.
 Under international law, they
 stressed, the right to choose the
 means of injuring' the enemy Is
 'not unlimited."
 i The statement was issued by
 .Samuel Gonard, president of the
 all-Swiss  International  Com-
 mittee of the Red Cross; Jose
 Barroso-Chavez of Mexico, pres-
 ident of the league to which 106

 T.;

 I  North. Vietnamese military
 authorities have permitted two
 more United States prisoners of
 and report that their treatment
 at the hands of their captors
 was "humane."
 A French physician and an
 American biochemist, both asso-
 ciated with the Bertrand Russell
 Peace Foundation and Interna-
 ,tional War Crimes Tribunal,
 described in interviews their
 meeting with the captured air-
 men in Hanoi last month. The
 tribunal has no official .stand-
 ,Ing and is supported by per-.
 csistent critics of United States
 policy in Vietnam.
 Though both prisoners, were
 said to be in reasonably good
 health and lucid in conversation,
 the, visitors reported, they per-
 formed the same strange ges-
 ture---a low and deliberate bow
 of greeting-that has led the
 United States, Government to
 charge the North. Vietnamese
 with brainwashing.
 This charge was made by the
 State Department on April, 3
 after   the   magazine   Life
 had published a picture of one
 prisoner, Lieut. Cmdr. Richard
 A. Stratton, In an act of bow-
 ing. The Life photographer 'Lee
 Lockwood, said he had found it
 "thoroughly distasteful."
 'Disagreeable Moment"+.
 Jean-Michell Krivine, a sur-
 geon on the staff of a pu}lic
 hospital in Paris, called the ap-
 pearance and deep bow of the
 American prisoners -'the most
 disagreeable moment" of his
 trip to North Vietnam.
 One prisoner, Identified as
 Maj. Jack Williamson Bomar of
 San Antonio, Texas, was said
 to have performed this gesture
 greeting even though he.was
 standing with crutches. He said
 his ankle had been injured when
 he \pa'rachuted out of his air
 craft. He was captured on Feb.
 4, 1967.
 Dr. Krivine said Major Bomar
 "looked puzzled" when one of
 the Western visitors held out
 his hand.
 "For a second he did not seem
 to know how, to respond," Dr.
 Krivine said.
 Only. when the visitor, Pro-
 fessor John B. Neilands of the
 University,  of  California  at
 'Berkeley, explained   that  he
 [simply wanted to shake hands
 did Major Bomar extend       his
 own hand in return.'
 tr.; Interviewed by telephone, ,Dr.
 Neilands said "I didn't see any
 evidence of brainwashing," but
 he added, "It's a relative tom
 --it all depends on what you
 mean ,by it."
 Dr. Neilands, who is 45 years
 old, has been on the biochem-
 istry faculty of Berkeley for
 the last 15 years.
 Meeting on March 16
 The meeting with the t*o
 prisoners took pplace on March
 16 in Hanoi. Beside Dr. Kri-
 vine and Dr. Neilands was a
 third visitor, Maurice Cornil, a
 Belgian lawyer. Mr. Cornil is
 directing a ? team of jurists in-
 vestigating the war In Viet-
 nam. He is not associated with
 the war crimes tribunal, head-
 ed by the British philosopher,
 Lord Ru sell.
 This tribunal Intends to con-
 vene a `"trial" of President
 Johnson for war  crimes  in
 Paris later this month.
 Though    Major 'Bomar did

 statements critical of the John-
 son Administration, and then
 as having said, "I don't want
 my name published, I don't
 want to go from a Vietnam-
 ese jail into an American one."
 Major Bomar refrained from
 political criticism during the
 two-hour conversation, accord-
 ing to the two visitors, and
 was quoted as having said at
 have interpreted a ituniber of
 indications as evidence that the
 prisoners are being subjected
 to brainwashing. Most spectacu-
 lar, officials saidi is the strangq
 bowing by the American offi-'
 cers. when greeting visitors.
 "This is hardly a greeting
 they teach you at West Point,"
 said one American analyst.
 Mr. Lockwood, the photogra
 plier, reported that the prisoners
 he had seen, -Commander Strat-
 ton, had bowed in response, to
 sharm commands from a North
 Vietnamese officer at his side.
 Dr. Neilands said neither of
 the two prisoners he had seen
 appeared to consult his Viet-
 namese guard before speakifig
 or bowing. One, however, looked
 questioningly at the guard, be-
 fore accepting a cigarette from
 Dr. Krivine.
 More than 20. American pris-
 oners have been named by the
 North Vietnamese with propa-
 ganda statements or "confes-
 sions" attributed to them. Ja-
 panese  television  cameramen
 were allowed to photograph
 one prisoner, Condr. Jeremiah
 A. Denton, Jr.j in May, 1966.
 The American Broadcasting
 Company reported earlier this
 month, that lipreading special-
 ists who had examined Japanese
 films of another prisoner had
 found that the words heard on
 the sound track did not coincide
 with the lip movements seen

 Party Resolution   50th Aiivrsry of Soviet Lth
 OCTOBER SOCIALIST REVOLUTION.- Jan. 4, 1967, Resolu-
 tion of C.P:S.U. Central Committee. (Pravda and Izvestia,
 Jan. 8, pp. 1-2. 8,500 words. Condensed text:) Nov? 7, 1967,
 will be the 50th anniversary of the victory of the Great Octo-
 ber Socialist Revolution....
 The October Revolution opened the way to solving the funda-
 mental problems posed by the entire course of the previous
 development of world history: the future of society, the nature
 of social progress, war and peace and the fate of world civi-
 lization.
 The victory of October confirmed the Leninist theory of
 socialist revolution. The test of history has been withstood
 .by the Marxist-Leninist teachings on:
 the inevitibility of the fall of capitalism and the affirmation
 of socialism;
 the vanguard role of the working class, guided by the Com-
 munist Party, in revolution and the building of a new society;
 the dictatorship of the proletariat and its role in the strug-.
 gle for the triumph of socialism;
 the Soviets as the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat
 and as organs of genuine popular rule of socialist democracy;
 the alliance of the working class with the peasantry and
 other strata of the working people, under the leadership of the
 working class, as the decisive force in the struggle for social
 liberation;
 the industrialization of the country and the socialist trang-
 formation of agriculture;
 the ways of deciding the national question;
 raising the living standard of the working people and effect-
 ing a cultural revolution....
 During the days of October and the years of the Civil-War-
 and the fcreign intervention, the high revolutionary spirit and
 heroism of the working class and the toiling peasantry mani-
 ef- sted itself with particular force. The ovie`f re`pabTic,`li
 an island, was surrounded by an ocean of hostile forces, and
 its enemies prophesied its inexorable and early death. They
 all did everything they could to strangle and destroy the young
 Soviet republic. Enormous effort was required to break the
 ring of fire of the White Guards and interventionists, to over-
 come the economic blockade, famine and economic devastation.
 Under the leadership of the Communist Party, workers and
 peasants and the Red Army defended the gains of the revolu-
 ,,okion and routed the enemies. The country set about economic
 construction.
 The mass heroism of the working people in the years of the
 restoration of the national economy and the first five-year
 ;plans is one of the unforgettable pages in the history of our
 society. The Soviet people spared neither efforts nor means,
 consciously chose deprivation and labored stubbornly, display-
 ing models of. courage in the name of overcoming the country's
 backwardness and turning it into a powerful socialist state.
 The feat of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War
 against the fascist invaders is immortal. This war was long
 and bloody, and the vac ims it c a me-d innumerable. But the
 Soviet social and state system, created by the October Revo-
 lution, withstood the cruelest trials....
 The strength of the socialist system clearly manifested it-
 self in the postwar years as well. Cities and vvrages were
 raisedTrom ashes and ruins in a very short time. The econ-
 omy, destroyed by the war, was completely restored, new
 successes in the development of economics, science and cul-
 ture were achieved and the country entered the period of full-
 scale communist construction....
 Our people will always hold sacred the memory of the rev
 olutionary fighters and Leninist Bolsheviks who perished in
 Tsarist prisons and in exile, the memory of the national he-
 roes of the Socialist Revolution and the Civil War. Our lafrd
 was soaked with the blood of millions of the best sons and
 daughters of the people, who perished at the hands of White
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved
 Guards, interventionists and fascist invaders. The glory of the
 sons and daughters of the people who defended it, freedom and
 independence of our homeland will not fade. The courageous
 builders of new plants and.collective and state farms under the
 first five-year plans will never be forgotten. ' The deeds of ,  .
 those who through their labor multiplied the material and spir-
 itual wealth of Soviet society will live forever.
 The path of our people is great. Their exploit is great. They
 will be an eternal example for future genera ions, for ail w o
 fiave chosen--the roams of freedom.
 `TFie e~T 5anner oT-socia sm  as been flying triumphantly
 over our land for half a century. For. half a century the Soviet
 people have been realizing the ideas of Marx, Engels,. and
 Lenin. They have done much, achieved much. The complete
 and final triumph of socialism in the U.S.S.R. and the transition
 to the building of communism are the most important results
 of the h e revolutionary reforms in our country.
 ty ears-ob~oOctoer means the cu rea_tion of large socialist
 industry with a steady rate of development, supplied with the
 newest-lechnology and capable of solving the most complicated
 scientific and technical problems and national-economic tasks....
 Fifty years of October means implementation of the Leninist
 plan o organize the countryside into cooperatives, the creation
 of large-scale socialist agricultural production. As a result of
 the triumph of the collective farm system, a social revolution
 has occurred in the tenor of rural life....
 Fifty years of October means a rise in the living standard of
 the people.. The rights to labor an recreation, to free educa-
 tion, medical services and pension security have become natu-
 ral and normal for the Soviet people....
 Fifty years of October means the carrying out of a cultural
 revolution. Socialism has brought the Soviet people education
 and enlightenment, it has elevated and enriched the spiritual
 life of the society immeasurably....
 Fifty years of October means a growing social, political and
 ideological unity of the people. On the basis of a community of
 vital interests among the the working people, the alliance between
 the working class and the peasantry, which formed and grew
 strong in the common struggle to build socialism and commu-
 ism, has become firmer....
 The experience of the development of the U.S.S.R.-a unified
 socialist multinational state-discloses the essence of social-
 ism and its importance in deciding the age-old national ques-
 tion and represents a triumph for the ideas of proletarian in-
 ternationalism in practice.
 Fifty years of October means the birth of the man of the new
 world, the new morality. The triumph of the October Revolu-
 tion launched a vigorous struggle against the morals and prej-
 udices of the private-property world, against its individualism,
 egoism and selfishness. The years of socialist construction
 fundamentally changed the nature of relations among people in
 our country. The bourgeois ideologists' reckoning that social-
 ism would not overcome the forces of inertia and the individ-
 ualistic morals of the old world proved wrong. During the
 years of Soviet rule a generation of people has grown up with a
 highly developed political consciousness and a new attitude to-
 ward labor, people reared in the spirit of collectivism and
 comradeship, Soviet patriotism and proletarian international-
 ism. The new nature of man as a revolutionary and fighter for
 our great cause has been forged.
 Our country gave birth to and established the democracy of
 socialism-the most extensive, the most representative, the
 most just. The rule of the Soviets, born of the Revolution-rule
 y t6 he people and for the people-opened wide possibilities for
 the participation of the working people in the administration of
 state, production and public affairs. Socialist society raises
 the civic dignity and honor of the person, places before people
 the most noble goals and brings about all the conditions for the
 conscientious creativity of the masses in the name of commu-
 nist construction....

 The results of the October Revolution and the lessons of his-
 tory are irrefutable evidence of the advantages of socialism
 over capitalism. The development of the Soviet socialist so-
 ciety and the results achieved by it are a practical demonstra-
 tion that socialism is the social system that guarantees the
 planned and efficient development of social production, growth
 in national prosperity and culture, democracy and true free-
 dom for the working people.
 The experience of the building of socialism has shown what
 a complex and creative matter the revolutionary reconstruc-
 tion of society is, and what new problems, tasks and historical
 changes it comes across in its development.
 Soviet society was created, grew and became strong in bitter
 class battles. In solving the highly complicated task of the
 practical embodiment of the ideals of scientific socialism, our
 people, guided by Lenin's party, took a new path, never before
 traveled by anyone. In the struggle for Soviet rule, for the
 victory of socialism, the working class and all working people
 had to overcome many obstacles and barriers and to bear the
 burden of incredible difficulties....
 Along the 50-year path traveled, the Party and people have
 known both the joy of great victories and the bitterness of
 losses, temporary failures and mistakes. Our party emerged
 from all trials even more tempered, stronger and with un-
 shakeaMe revolutionary optimism and confidence fn the tri-
 umph of the great communist cause.
 Even now we have many unsolved problems. The Party
 soberly evaluates the state of affairs, sees the urgent prob-
 lems and takes all steps toward their solution....
 Socialism is a constantly developing society, which in its
 progressive development discloses ever newer reserves and
 possibilities. These possibilities and advantages of socialism
 are realized not by themselves, not automatically, but as a re-
 sult of the conscientious labor of millions....
 During the most difficult times-the years of struggle for
 Soviet rule, the days when the working people experienced the
 pain of the loss of Lenin, and during the period of the grave
 trials of the Great Patriotic War-remarkable sons and daugh-
 ters of our people entered Lenin's party in order to struggle
 within its framework for the victory of the workers' cause.
 Communists have always and everywhere taken on the heav-
 te st share of struggle and construction. In the course of the
 revolutionary struggle and socialist reforms, the Party
 trained numerous cadres of workers in all branches of the
 economy and culture. The Communist Party is of one flesh
 with the working class, the toiling people, the creative people,
 it constantly feels their unanimous support; the confidence of
 the working people is dear to the Party, it has no other inter-
 ests but those of the people.
 The C.P.S.U. approaches the 50th anniversary of October
 fully armed with its rich experience in the management of
 communist construction and the country's foreign and domes-
 tic policies. The Party defended its general line in a relent-
 less struggle against Trotskyites, petty-bourgeois adventur-
 ists, right-wing opportunists, national deviationists and other
 anti-Leninist schools and groups.
 Firmly and consistently guided by Marxist-Leninist princi-
 pies and constantly developing and enriching the theoretical
 heritage of Marx-Engels-Lenin, the C.P.S.U. is confidently
 leading the Soviet people along the path of communist con-
 struction and is successfully fulfilling its role of organizer
 and political leader of the Soviet people.
 The experience of the C.P.S.U. as the party of the Great
 Socialist Revolution, as the guiding force of a socialist soci-
 ety built in a country where formerly there had existed the
 most diverse socio-economic structures-from patriarchal
 'tribalism to capitalism-has enormous international signifi-
 cance.
 The Communist and workers' parties and peoples of fra-
 ternal countries study carefully and make extensive use of the
 experience of socialist and communist construction in the
 Soviet Union in the creation of a new life. The valuaple ex-
 perience of fraternal parties in the building of socialism is
 widely used in our country. Mutual support and assistance
 and the mutual exchange of experience have become a power-
 ful factor in our successful movement forward along the path 2
 The Soviet state has proclaimed and is putting into practice
 new principles of relations between peoples and countries,
 principles of equity, sovereignty and noninterference in inter-
 nal affairs. The Soviet Union, beginning with Lenin's Decree
 on Peace, is following a foreign policy that is in keeping with
 the most vital aspirations of the peoples. This is the policy of
 ensuring favorable conditions for the. building of socialism and
 communism, of strengthening unity and solidarity among the
 socialist countries, supporting in every way the struggle of
 peoples for national and social liberation, consistently follow-
 ing the principles of peaceful coexistence among states with
 different social systems and struggling to deliver mankind
 from a new world war....
 The building of socialism and communism in the U.S.S.R. is
 a most important component part of the world revolutionary
 process. Socialism now influences world developments.pri-
 marily through the positive force of its example. The might of
 our state, its example, prestige and activeness in the interna-
 tional arena, which have been placed in the service of the
 Ideals of socialism, are taking on more and more significance
 ing people of all countries.
 The Great October Socialist Revolution has immense inter-
 nati o   sign' icance. It has accelerated the course    iTi`stoor-
 ical events in the world. The ideas of Marxism-Leninism and
 October hae sprea over the entire earth, they have roused
 peoples to the struggle against their oppressors, for freedom
 and independence. The gains of the October Revolution have
 been a mighty base for revolutionary reforms in all parts of
 the world....
 The October Revolution was the turning point in the develop-
 ment o the national- I e afion movement. It demonstrated the
 real possibility o complete plete na ions  i eration for peoples, be-
 gan the crisis of the colonial system and opened realistic pros-
 pects for national-liberation revolutions. The smashing of
 colonial empires, the entrance of formerly enslaved peoples
 into international life as an active and independent force, their
 striving toward social progress-all of this is inseparably con-
 nected with the October Revolution, the successes of socialism
 and the class and anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of
 the world.
 The Great October Socialist Revolution:
 united in asingg e current the struggle of the proletariat and
 other revolutionary forces for sociaalism wit the slruggTe of
 oppressed peop es agar snnational colon al oppression.- IL dis-
 closed the urgency an net  cesslty of an alliance between the
 workers' movement and the national-liberation struggle of
 peoples in the name of victory over imperialism, in the name
 of the triumph of national and social freedom;
 exerted an immense revolutionary influence on the peoples
 of the world, strengthened the fighting determination o the
 aroused broad social strata to an active political life;
 to an enormous extent, furthered the strengthening of the
 organization oft e working class and the working people
 throughou the world, which has found its expression in 'the
 growth of Communist Parties and in the rapid development of
 trade unions, women's and young people's organizations and
 all the progressive forces in society....
 The strategic line of the modern Communist movement was
 defined in the Declaration and Statement of the Moscow Con-
 ferences of representatives of Communist and workers' par-
 ties, and fidelity to these is an inalienable feature of the
 Marxist-Leninist parties.
 A half century of history has proven the correctness and
 and social democratism. The experience demonstrates that
 ily guided by Marxism-Leninism, and any attempt to replace
 Marxism-Leninism with pseudo-revolutionary phraseology and
 American imperialism, having assumed the function of world
 policeman, is intensifying provocations 'in various areas of the
 world. U.S. imperialists have unleashed a piratical war
 against the Vietnamese people and are trying to strangle the
 freedom and independence of the peoples and establish their

 This requires strengthening of unity among all revolution-
 ary and progressive forces for a vigorous rebuff to the ag-
 gressors, for the struggle against imperialism.
 A half century of experience demonstrates graphically the
 unshakability of the Marxist-Leninist position on the indivisi-
 bility of the national and international tasks of revolutionary
 forces. Loyalty to proletarian internationalism is the founda-
 tion for the successful motion forward of the revolutionary
 cause in every in ivt    coon ry a i on on interne ao~ on
 scale....
 The 23rd C.P.S.U. Congress was an important milestone in
 the movement of our country toward communism. On the
 basis o a profoun scientific ana ysis, the   rty Congress
 determined the main tasks of the modern' stage of communist
 construction. The Party worked out and is implementing
 highly important steps toward establishing and developing
 Leninist norms of Party and state life, improving the princi-
 ples of collectivity in work, developing inner-Party democ-
 racy, expanding criticism and self-criticism and improving
 the methods of managing the national economy.
 The tasks and plans for coming years outlined by the 23rd
 Party Congress awaken new forces and new energy in the
 Soviet people....
 The C.P.S.U. Central Committee resolves:
 To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Great October So-
 cialist Revolution as the great holiday of the working people,
 an increase in labor productivity, an improvement of the sys-
 tem of planning and economic incentives and the perfecting of
 social relations;
 ensuring high, steady rates of development in agriculture
 and a significant increase in the output of agricultural prod-
 ucts on the basis of the intensification of agricultural production;
 a further substantial rise in the material and cultural level
 of the life of the people, the expansion of housing, cultural and
 service construction in the city and the countryside;
 the further improvement of socialist democracy, a raising
 the glorious holiday of all the peoples of the U.S.S.R. and as
 the triumph of the ideas of October, the ideas of communism.
 Recalling the words of V. 1. Lenin that the best way of cele-
 brating the anniversary of the great Revolution is to concen-
 trate attention on unsolved problems, the C.P.S.U. Central
 Committee recommends to Party, Soviet, trade union, Y.C.L.
 and economic organizations that they expand even more the
 struggle for realization of the plans outlined by the 23rd
 C.P.S.U. Congress and direct the efforts of the working peo-
 ple toward solving the following highly important tasks:
 a further significant growth in industry, an increase in the
 efficiency of social production on the basis of the comprehen-
 sive utilization of the achievements of science and technology,
 of the role of the Soviets, full exercise of their powers in
 carrying out the tasks of economic and cultural construction,
 the development of activeness among the working people in all
 spheres of public life, an increase In the responsibility to the
 people of executive agencies, Deputies and officials;
 the strengthening of the socialist norms of life, the enrich-
 ment of the revolutionary traditions of our society and the
 comprehensive rearing of the people in the spirit of Soviet
 patriotism, proletarian internationalism and friendship among
 peoples.
 To recommend to the Central Committees of Union-republic
 Communist Parties; territory, province, city and district
 Party committees; and primary Party organizations that they
 launch widespread organizational and political work in connec-
 tion with the 50th anniversary of the Great October Socialist
 Revolution....
 The preparations for and celebration of the 50th anniversary
 of October are called upon to promote the further development
 of the revolutionary and labor traditions of the people and of
 Soviet patriotism and proletarian internationalism, the foster-
 ing in the working people of high moral qualities, devotion to
 communist ideals, a civic attitude, implacability toward bour-
 geois ideology, the ability to place the interests of the social-
 ist homeland above all else, and the readiness to defend with
 weapons in 'hand the achievements of socialism.
