 The local military have taken over the Azorean island of Sao Miguel, after a
 protest demonstration forced the resignation of the civil governor and apparently
 touched off a separatist effort to seize control.
 Separatists apparently sought to exploit a demonstration by some 3,000
 Azoreans who occupied the Portuguese civil governor's office in Ponta Delgada
 yesterday afternoon.
 The separatists closed Ponta Delgada airport and took over a local radio station.
 The airport was later reopened, apparently on orders of the military governor.
 There were early indications that some army members on Sao Miguel had
 acquiesced in the separatist effort. The separatists issued a call for their supporters
 elsewhere in the Azores to seize "points of decision" and implied that they had
 military support.
 A member of the Azorean Liberation Front later told the US consul in Ponta
 Delgada that Military Governor Magalhaes was meeting with representatives of the
 Front. The military on Sao Miguel, after some vacillation, appear to have decided to
 remain loyal to Lisbon, at least for now.
 A communique issued in Lisbon last night claimed that the situation was fully
 under the control of the Armed Forces Movement.
 Magalhaes' tie to Lisbon appears to be weak, however, and may be cut if
 Portugal's ruling military authorities seek to retaliate for yesterday's events. So far,
 apparently, no one has been arrested, and the separatists are thus free to try to
 capitalize on the support they received yesterday and perhaps to try again with more
 preparation.
 Coordination with groups outside Ponta Delgada was not established yesterday,
 and nothing happened on other islands. The separatists had little chance of seizing
 the key points-military armories and communications facilities-allegedly called for
 in their original plan.
 US military officials at Lajes air base, on Terceira Island, report that the
 situation there remained calm.

 There was no interference with the seven NATO ships-including a US vessel
 and a Portuguese ship-currently visiting Ponta Delgada.
 Lisbon's initial reaction to the developments was subdued, but charges of a
 rightist attempt to thwart the Portuguese revolution are sure to arise. Leftists are
 likely to make an effort to link the US to the disturbances.

 A new round of heavy fighting broke out in Luanda on Thursday when
 troops of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola attacked several
 areas in the city held by forces of the National Front for the Liberation of
 Angola. Thus far, the Popular Movement appears to have the upper hand.
 The Popular Movement's military successes over the past week in northern
 Angola and the exclave of Cabinda have probably encouraged it to try to force
 the Front out of Luanda. In other parts of Angola, the Popular Movement now
 seems in a good position to disrupt the Front's supply routes from northern
 Angola and Zaire to Luanda. The Front already appears to be suffering
 shortages of arms and ammunition. Fragmentary reports on the fighting in
 Cabinda suggest the Popular Movement may have pushed the Front out of the
 capital city.

 Renewed fighting in Angola is posing serious problems for Portugal's ruling
 Armed Forces Movement, which is divided on how to deal with its African territory.
 A recent Portuguese delegation to Zaire led by Revolutionary Council member
 Vitor Alves signed a joint declaration reiterating Portugal's position of neutrality
 among the factions and stating that Portugal pledged to avoid any action that might
 worsen the Angola situation. Although the communique is consistent with Portugal's
 public stand, it also served to mollify President Mobutu, who had been publicly
 denounced by Rosa Coutinho for his support to the Front.
 Further evidence of the split in the Armed Forces Movement on the Angolan
 issue came to light thi;; week in remarks made to Ambassador Carlucci by
 Interterritorial Coordination Minister Almeida Santos. Santos claimed that over the
 objection of Rosa Coutinho he had succeeded in persuading Portuguese leaders to
 adopt a position of genuine neutrality. He argued that the Popular Movement clearly
 would be defeated and that Portugal could not afford to back a loser. His admission
 that Portugal has been secretly backing the Popular Movement is the first by any
 high government official.
 The issue, however, may not have been finally resolved as Santos claims. Rosa
 Coutinho has a large following and may yet sway the Armed Forces Movement to
 his point of view. His arguments will be strengthened by recent Popular Movement
 successes in the fighting in Angola.
 Meanwhile, the influx of white refugees from the Portuguese colony could
 cause additional problems for Portugal's leaders. It is estimated that at least 5,000

 Portuguese emigrants have left Angola since August, with 1,500 returning home. As
 many as 50,000 more are now said to have booked passage. The refugees that do
 return to Portugal will not only swell the ranks of the unemployed but will also
 reintroduce into Portugal's turbulent political life a large number of conservative
 military officers who view present political developments in Lisbon with alarm.

 . The British electorate's overwhelming endorsement of EC membership in
 the referendum on June 5 indicates that Prime Minister Wilson's gamble with
 his political future paid off. Several years ago, Wilson had suggested holding a
 referendum in order to prevent the Labor Party from splitting over this
 controversial question.
 Over 67 percent voted in favor of remaining in the EC. Roughly 65
 percent of the electorate turned out-less than normal for general elections but
 sufficiently high for the government to declare that the voters had made clear
 their views. Wilson hoped that a positive vote in the referendum would put to
 rest, particularly within his own Labor Party, the question of Britain's
 European connection.
 In Scotland, a surprising 58 percent voted to remain in the EC. This is a
 blow to the Scottish Nationalists, who had urged a "no" vote to protest that
 England had dragged Scotland into the EC. Some Scottish members of
 Parliament suggest that the positive Scottish vote indicates that Nationalist
 strength has peaked.
 Despite the outcome of the vote, some opponents may try to keep the
 issue alive. The chairman of the National  Referendum  Campaign-the
 anti-Market umbrella organization-said that a "yes" vote did not need to be
 final and that what one parliamentary session did, another could undo.
 However, one of the leading anti-Marketeers-who is also head of Britain's
 largest trade union-called on Britons to look ahead now and unite behind the
 government to solve the country's mounting economic problems.
 Now that the all-consuming referendum campaign is over, Wilson is
 expected to move in two directions before Parliament recesses in mid-July:
 --shuffle the cabinet to move some of the uncooperative vocal
 anti-Marketeers to less important positions;
 --address growing economic problems, especially rising inflation and
 unemployment. The trade unions, industry, and the government will search
 more urgently than before for a substitute for the nearly defunct social
 contract.
 The unqualified British "yes" to EC membership is being greeted with
 immense relief in the EC capitals. The Community can now devote more
 attention to problems that had been deferred while the British question

 preoccupied the Nine. The referendum is a major political success for the
 Community and could provide new forward momentum. At the least, it should
 temporarily still anti-EC sentiment in Denmark that was deriving inspiration
 from the UK.
 London will move quickly to mend fences with its EC partners and
 assuage the considerable resentment currently felt toward it in many quarters.
 There will be opportunities for conciliatory moves at several Council meetings
 this month, including one of the foreign ministers, and at a "European
 Council" of the nine heads of government next month. Recently announced
 changes in the UK Foreign Office and diplomatic service probably point to
 Wilson's intention to increase the "European" cast of British foreign policy.
 The Labor Party, for the first time, will now take seats in the European
 Parliament, and British representatives, including those from the trade union
 sector, will attend meetings of the economic and social committee. No major
 changes in London's position on principal issues under EC competence are
 expected anytime soon, and Britain will continue staunchly to protect its
 national interests in EC forums.
 British influence on the EC has been to broaden and liberalize the
 Community's external policies while making its machinery more pragmatic and
 less bureaucratic. This positive impact can be expected to continue, as will
 Lond n's efforts to counter the EC's tendency to evolve along protectionist
 lines.

 There have been no major anti-US demonstrations or disturbances in Vientiane
 for nearly a week, but harassment of Americans continues.
 Yesterday, a so-called "protest committee" claiming to represent some 2,700
 Lao employees of AID demanded an extra three months' severance pay for these
 employees, on top of the generous termination benefits already promised them. In
 order to keep the AID dissolution negotiations on track and to protect the safety of
 the 200 or so Americans still in the Lao capital, US officials had little choice but to
 acquiesce.
 The Pathet Lao are continuing to enter the private residences of American Al D
 personnel, ostensibly for the purpose of inventorying the "furniture." In some cases,
 they have confiscated refrigerators, stoves, and air conditioners-possibly in the
 belief that AID personnel wit attempt to remove these appliances when they leave
 Laos on or before June 30.

 LEBANON
 Lebanese Prime Minister - designate Rashid Karami, who has been trying for
 ten days to assemble a new cabinet, yesterday received an assist from Egyptian
 President Sadat.
 In an interview published in a Beirut newspaper, Sadat urged all Arab states to
 refrain from interference in  Lebanon's domestic affairs, proclaimed his own
 willingness to visit Beirut to facilitate the negotiation of a new agreement between
 the Lebanese and the fedayeen, and expressed confidence that the head of the
 right-wing Phalanges Party, Pierre Jumayyil, will recognize his "Arab responsibility.
 Sadat appealed to Jumayyil to cooperate in seeking an end to Lebanon's
 political and security crisis, adding that he has "no doubt that Jumayyil will
 respond." This expression of confidence, although qualified, will tend to undermine
 the position of Progressive Socialist leader Kamal Jumblatt, who has held up the
 formation of a government by insisting that the Phalangists should be excluded
 because of their role in the recent fighting.
 Jumayyil has publicly welcomed Sadat's initiative. He has shown no sign,
 however, of backing down from his demand that the Phalangists be included in any
 new government.
 A  variety  of  Lebanese political and religious leaders-and, probably,
 representatives of the Syrian government-have also been attempting to persuade
 Jumblatt to limit his demands and cooperate with Karami. With this combination of
 Arabs calling for moderation, Jumblatt is not likely to hold out for long-especially
 if as is likely, his party is offered important cabinet posts.
 Karami has said only that he will form a government "in due time." He has
 justified his failure to make quick progress by repeating that the country needs a
 cabinet competent to deal with, rather than ignore, Lebanon's problems.
 Karami has indirectly criticized President Franjiyah's handling of the current
 crisis by publicly praising former president Shihab, who-with Karami as prime
 minister-provided vigorous and effective leadership after the 1958 civil war. Karami
 probably holds only limited hope that Franjiyah will provide much help in
 assembling a cabinet, but is eager to protect himself against his own possible failure
 by moving in advance to put some of the blame on Franjiyah.
 In fact, recent developments have significantly reduced Franjiyah's political
 strength and popularity, although he remains the dominant figure. Still, he has been

 The Nationalists' initial requst to co-produce an additional 20 F-5E aircraft has
 been approved by the US. Their requested credit arrangements for these aircraft
 have been disapproved, however, and Taiwan is expected to attempt domestic
 financing to support the operation.
 Taiwan's participation in co-production of the aircraft-which has been limited
 to the assembly of prefabricated components and parts-is to undergo a phased
 increase. By mid-1976, the Nationalists should be manufacturing some components
 from US-supplied raw materials. Taiwan would also like to co -produce 60 to 80
 engines for the aircraft,

 JAPAN-CHINA
 Tokyo has tentatively approved a one-year, $500-million trade credit for China.
 The credit, arranged in April, will help correct Peking's balance of payments this
 year.
 The credit will be used to finance Chinese imports of 1.5 million tons of steel
 from Japan this year. It will also enable Peking to continue importing industrial
 products and equipment, while avoiding at least temporarily a balance-of-payments
 problem.
 Without the credit, China had anticipated a $600-million trade deficit with
 Japan this year. In 1974, the deficit with Japan was $840 million-five times the
 deficit in 1973. Total Japanese trade with Chinawill reach $4 billion this year, $1
 billion more than last year.
 The credit will provide some relief to Japan's depressed steel industry. Peking's

 Gustav Husak's election to the presidency, on top of his continuing role as
 party secretary, confirms his position as the strongest leader in the Prague regime.
 Over the coming months, however, his political acumen will be put to the test as he
 grapples with difficult internal problems.
 Husak's tenure in the two top jobs appears secure, at least until the party
 congress next spring. He is apparently in good health and, after several months of
 intensive internal debates centering on the selection of a successor to former
 president Svoboda, he has clearly emerged as "first among equals." More important,
 the fact that Husak won the presidency demonstrates he has Moscow's endorsement.
 The US embassy reports that its diplomatic contacts in Prague are, nevertheless,
 generally reluctant to conclude that Husak's position is now unassailable. Indeed,
 the Central  Committee plenum that nominated  Husak for the presidency
 conspicuously avoided  removing the  incapacitated Svoboda from  the party
 Presidium. Although Svoboda's retention in the party's top ruling body preserves the
 delicate balance between moderates led by Husak and the hard-liners, Husak
 probably would have preferred replacing him with another moderate.
 Husak's dual posts will probably make him increasingly vulnerable to internal
 critics, and he will no longer be able to devote full time to running the party.
 Moreover, some members of the leadership-rightly or wrongly-can be expected to
 interpret his elevation to the presidency as a "kick upstairs." The resulting
 uncertainty about Husak's political strength, plus the need eventually to replace
 Svoboda on the Presidium, could lead to increased political in-fighting, thereby
 further complicating Husak's efforts to lead the regime.
 Husak must still find a way to heal the wounds of 1968, when as many as
 500,000 party members were purged in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion. He
 favors moderation and is engaged in factional struggles with party hardliners who
 oppose his efforts to rehabilitate former party members-primarily at the lower
 levels-on a case-by-case basis. There are no signs that Husak has won this struggle.
 Another problem confronting Husak is what to do with his predecessor,
 Alexander Dubcek.
 Husak could find it difficult to
 muzzle Dubcek and his supporters. Failure to do so will bring Husak under
 increasing pressure from revenge-seeking hard-liners at home.

 The determining factor in Husak's future will probably be Moscow's continuing
 appraisal of his performance? He will have to be particularly adroit both in living up
 to Soviet expectations and in establishing political stability in a party and a nation
 still haunted by the events of 1968

 A Spanish Foreign Ministry official has indicated that his government this week
 informed Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria that it would soon invite them formally
 to a four-party international conference to discuss the future of Spanish Sahara.
 According to the official, if one or more of the parties reject the invitation,
 Spain then plans to request UN Secretary General Waldheim to 'convoke such a
 conference under his own auspices. Waldheim's announced visit 'to all four countries
 next week may lay the groundwork for such a conference. The official stated that if
 a conference cannot be successfully convoked even under UN auspices, Spain's
 "hands will be clean"; it will have made an honest effort to seek a solution among
 the interested parties. The next step then would be up to the UN.
 The official stressed Spain's willingness to consider any possible solution-not
 excluding annexation or partition-that the interested parties may propose. He
 insisted that Madrid is not committed to the creation of an independent state or to
 surrender sovereignty to any particular Saharan political force. Rabat has not yet
 dropped its objection to Algerian participation in negotiations to settle the
 disposition of the territory, but we believe Morocco will acquiesce to prevent an
 early Spanish withdrawal-a possibility raised in a statement issued by Madrid last
 month.
 A mutually acceptable political solution will be difficult to achieve. Algiers
 opposes Moroccan annexation of all the territory, while Rabat opposes Spanish
 Saharan  independence.  Both  Morocco and  Mauritania fear a hasty Spanish
 withdrawal before a political settlement can be negotiated.
 Algerian opposition to Morocco's claims has not diminished. To exert pressure,
 King Hassan has orchestrated an anti-Algeria press campaign, including attacks by
 Moroccan party leaders.
 For the present, the Algerians seem unconcerned about Moroccan pressure
 tactics. They would like to see Spain withdraw leaving an established government in
 place, presumably the pro-independence party in the Sahara that Algeria is publicly
 supporting. The Algerians have the capability to exert pressure on Morocco by
 enlisting international diplomatic support for granting Spanish Sahara independence
 or by supporting subversive activity by Moroccan dissidents residing in Algeria.
 Mauritania, for its part, remains fearful of Moroccan irredentism. Nevertheless,
 it is interested in a partition of the region with Morocco and claims to have reached

 agreement with Rabat. It accepts Algeria as an interested party, but gives it a
 secondary role because Algiers has no territorial claim. In any negotiations,
 Nouakchott will argue that partition is the most viable compromise solution.

 FRANCE: The US defense attache in Paris reports that a French naval task
 force of two destroyers is en route to the Indian Ocean. The ships reportedly will
 transit the Suez Canal on June 15, after a four-day visit to Greece. The two warships
 will relieve a guided-missile frigate and a destroyer in the Indian Ocean and will
 remain there until the end of the year. The reopening of the Suez Canal will have a
 significant impact on the French Indian Ocean Fleet. Transit time around the Cape
 of Good Hope is about 18 days. The Red Sea route via the canal will shorten the
 logistics support line from the main French Mediterranean naval base at Toulon to
 forces in the Indian and Pacific oceans by nearly two weeks.
 BURMA: Workers and students staged  small  protest demonstrations in
 Rangoon  yesterday, but no violence was reported. The protesters were
 commemorating the anniversary of last year's violent labor disorders, during which
 troops killed more than 20 demonstrators. The government hopes to keep the
 situation in hand this year and has sent high-ranking officials to meet with the
 workers and students. It has also announced that overtime pay for workers will be
 increased; low pay has been one of the main grievances of the workers. The US
 embassy reports that both the authorities and the protesters appear to be trying to
 avoid a serious confrontation. The mood is described as tense, however, and the level
 of unrest could escalate

 USSR: The  two  Kanin-class guided-missile destroyers and an armed
 replenishment oiler that made a 12-day visit to Cienfuegos, Cuba, left there on June
 4, probably en route to Northern Fleet waters. These units were in Boston from May
