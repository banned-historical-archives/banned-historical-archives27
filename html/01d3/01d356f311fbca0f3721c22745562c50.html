 Brain Drain
 Won't Affect
 Research
 India's scientific and technolog-
 ical programs would not be af-
 fected seriously either now or in
 the near future by  the "brain
 drain," a survey done for India's
 Council of Scientific and Industrial
 Research indicates.
 According to a report in the
 Statesman, the study, carried out
 by the council's .research, survey
 and planning organization,  says
 that the large percentage of mal-
 employment and underemploy-
 ment of qualified scientists actually
 gave the "impression" that the
 country could dispense with the
 services of those who have left or
 are leaving to take up positions
 abroad.
 This "impression" is strength-
 ened by the further finding that
 scientists, engineers and physicians
 In India are accorded a status and
 salary that compares unfavorably
 with those enjoyed by the Central
 Government's administrative staff.
 In support of these conclusions,
 the study notes that 18.6% of the
 nation's total pool of 713,000 sci-
 entists and technical personnel
 were malemployed and  another
 10.4% were unemployed. While the
 annual outturn of scientists and
 technical personnel was 80,000, In-
 dian scientists abroad on the role
 of national registers numbered
 some 12,000.   .

 Indonesia Fears
 New Red Plot
 Acting Indonesian President  u ar o this week warned
 that diehard "remnants" of the outlawed Communist Party
 may be plotting another attempt to seize power in the
 country.
 The warning by General Su-
 harto coincided with another by
 Maj. Gen. Amir Machud, mili-
 tary commander of Djakarta,
 against any attempt to "sabo-
 tage" General Suharto's policies.
 It coincided with testimony by
 a Communist leader at the
 treason trial of former Army
 Brig. Gen. Supardjo that the
 Communist underground was
 planning action.
 In a written address to. a meeting of officials in.his office,
 General Suharto said: "According to confiscated documents,
 it is clear that remnants of the Partai Communist (PKI) will
 continue to prepare a coup in Indonesia."
 more than 30,000 American troops.
 He agreed that. Communist rebefactions had sprung up in Thai-
 land,  but  blamed  this  on
 Americans.
 Leaders of the governing Con-
 gress Party decided this week to
 act fast and choose their next
 Prime Minister March 12. Party
 President Kumaraswami Kamaraj
 met with the party high command
 in Parliament. The last session of
 the old Parliament begins March
 13 to pass an interim budget. A
 Congress Party source said that
 by naming the Prime Minister
 beforehand, the lame-duck session
 would know with whom Parlia-
 ment would have to deal. for the
 next  five  years.  Attempts  are
 being made to have the newly
 elected leader confirmed without
 controversy and so strengthen the
 party and its leaders. In results
 from last week's election, the Con-
 gress Party has won 277 of the 520
 seals in Parliament.
 INDONESIA
 The Government made public a
 statement this week declaring that
 President  Sukarno  had  yielded
 power to the country's strongman,
 General Suharto, on his own initi-
 ative.  The  statement  said                         that
 President Sukarno's first proposal
 to General Suharto was rejected.
 General Suharto and other mili-
 tary commanders then declared
 they would not initiate any more
 meetings with him. The President's
 decision to hand over all executive
 powers was made Feb. 20, and
 officially announced two days later.
 The statement said President
 Sukarno had ordered the delay
 until he felt the proper time had
 arrived.
 JAPAN
 The Economic Council, an ad-
 visory organ of the Government,
 proposed in its final recommenda-
 tion last week that the nation's
 economic growth rate be kept at
 an average 8.3 per cent annually
 in real terms during the five-year
 period from 1987 to 1971. The
 average rise in consumer prices,
 according to the recommendation,
 will be 3.8  per cent annually.
 Kazutaka Kikawada, chairman of
 the council, is expected to submit
 this  recommendation  to  Prime
 Minister Eisaku Sato immediately
 after It is approved by the coun-
 cil's general meeting this week.
 This is the fifth recommendation to
 be made since 1955 by the council,
 which is officially a national eco-
 nomic planning consulting organ
 of the Economic Planning Agency.

 Nizam is Dead
 the end, the Indian Government
 took over his feudal state and put
 him on an allowance of $900,000 a
 year.
 In his youth, however, the Nizam
 was known for his high spirits and
 erudition. He rode elephants in
 silver howdahs and glided about in
 Rolls-Royces. He drank whisky,
 which  made him exceptional
 among Muslims, and he had his
 own jazz band.
 High Splendor
 He also lived in unexampled
 splendor in castles and palaces that
 were filled with gems. In his prime
 the Nizam entertained the world's
 potentates and served dinner on
 plates of gold.
 The British regarded the Nizam
 as "premier prince of India" and
 treated him with all the respects
 due a monarch.
 Despite his seeming profligate-
 ness, the young Nizam was by
 nature stingy and shrewd. He
 found that he had inherited a
 creaky and corrupt administration,
 and he set out to do something
 about it.
 This is a side of his nature that
 Is generally not known abroad.
 The Nizam fired corrupt officials,

 He was devoutly religious but
 secular in his outlook. He treated
 the majority of the population,
 Hindus, the same as he treated
 Muslims. He employed able men
 from outside the state to run the
 state affairs and build his projects.
 He founded the Osmania Uni-

 Achievements
 By 1944 he could look back at
 his achievements and say with
 satisfaction: "The last few years
 have been years of prosperity."
 But then, with a suddenness that
 broke his heart, the rush of the
 postwar years caught up with the
 Nizam.
 When independence and parti-
 tion came, the Nizam wished to set
 up an independent state, but was
 thwarted. The Indian Government
 permitted him to keep his titles
 and his possessions, but his pride
 was deeply hurt.
 Deeply hurt, the Nizam shut
 himself in his palace. He turned
 most of his property into a trust
 to provide for his relatives. And
 for the last 15 years of his life he
 was rarely seen in public.

 old man, once almost a legendary

 CALCUTTA PROFESSORS PARADE-Pressing for the implementation
 of a promise for a uniform and higher grade of salaries for all college
 and university faculty members, lecturers and professors all over India
 observed a day of silent protest on Jan. 31. In Calcutta teachers under
 the auspices of the West Bengal College and University Teachers Asso-
 ciation held a silent procession through the main streets of the metropolis.
 India Considers
 Compulsory Service
 A committee set up by the Indian Government to study national
 service for students has recommended compulsory national service
 for university students "which will have far-reaching effects on the
 educational system in the country," says the Asian Student Pulietin,
 New Delhi.
 The five-member committee was
 set up at the instance of the Prime
 Minister. The committee consisted
 of representatives of the Ministries
 of Home, Defense and Education
 and  the National  Cadet  Corps
 (NCC). The committee's report is
 being studied by the Prime
 Minister.
 National Service Corps
 The new scheme, called the Na-
 tional Service Corps  (NSC)
 scheme, is estimated to cost Rs.100
 million ($13.33 million) annually.
 The committee said that either
 the proposed National Service
 - Corps or the existing National,
 Cadet Corps should be made com-
 pulsory to all male university stu-
 dents. It should be voluntary for
 girls, the committee said. The com-
 mittee has suggested enforcement
 of  the  National  Service  Corps
 scheme in all universities by an
 Act of Parliament. It recommended
 that the Act, should specify com-
 pulsory participation of male uni-
 versity                        students  in  either the
 proposed National Service Corps or
 the National Cadet Corps.
 The Act should also stipulate
 provisions of adequate time for the
 National Cadet Corps or the Na-
 tional Service Corps as well as for
 normal academic work by reducing
 the present number of holidays
 and vacations and by rearranging
 terms suitably.
 New Department
 The committee suggested crea-
 tion of a new department for the
 National Service Corps headed by
 a secretary, considering the im-
 portance of the scheme. Once the
 National Service Corps gets going,
 the department could take over
 the National Cadet Corps also, it
 said.
 In view of the importance of the
 new program and the many diffi-
 culties it has to encounter, the
 committee suggested creation of
 a national committee for the Na-
 tional Service Corps to be pre-
 sided over by the Prime Minister
 and including the Central Min-
 isters of Education, Defense, Home,
 the Chief Ministers of the States,
 eminent educators, and the direc-
 tors-general of the National Cadet
 Corps and the National Service
 Corps.
 To attend to the complex prob-
 lems of National Service Corps ad-
 ministration and interdepartmental
 coordination, a high-powered com-
 mittee of secretaries should be set
 up at the Center. A similar mech-
 anism presided over by the Chief
 Secretary and including the De-
 velopment Commissioners should
 be set up at the provincial level
 also, the committee recommended.

 To Revise
 Syllabi
 The Pakistan Government has
 decided to appoint a National Bu-
 reau of Syllabi and Curricula, and
 a National Textbook Board to co-
 ordinate and harmonize education
 which is currently beset by cur-
 ricular absurdities and textual ir-
 regularities, says the Pakistan
 Times.
 According to t%e decision
 reached at the Governors' Confer-
 ence in Rawalpindi on Feb. 23,
 March-April 1968 will be the dead-
 line for preparation of authorita-
 tive books on history, law, civics,
 and international affairs with par-
 ticular reference to Pakistan's for-
 eign policy and ideological basis.
 Both the National Bureau of
 Syllabi and Curricula, and the Na-
 tional Textbook Board will be
 composed of officials dealing with
 educational matters and educa-
 tionists of repute. The two bodies
 will also have representatives of
 the two Provincial Governments.
 The preparation of standard
 books on the half dozen espe-
 cially selected subjects will be en-
 trusted to groups of scholars and
 administrators working in the re-
 lated fields. Some of the books-
 on economics and foreign affairs,
 for example-are already under
 preparation.
 Once a book is approved by the
 National Textbook Board, it will
 be prescribed for the entire coun-
 try, and translated into Bengali
 and Urdu.

 Turkey Saves Grain
 By Nuclear Radiation
 The world's first plant for saving
 grain by using nuclear methods of
 killing insect pests started trials
 recently at Iskenderun, on the
 south coast of Turkey. Built on a
 pilot 'scale by a British firm con-
 tracted  by  the  International
 Atomic Energy Agency, the plant
 was financed by the Turkish Gov-
 ernment and the United Nations
 Development Program.
 At Iskenderun, grain from large
 hoppers falls in a carefully regu-
 lated flow past a powerful source
 of radioactive cobalt; gamma ra-
 diation has the "effect of sterilizing
 the insects in the grain. The in-
 sects may then live for a few
 weeks, during which period they
 provide  a  degree. of  protection
 against reinfestation by the same
 species.

 Korea to Test
 Kibbutz System
 SEOUL (By Air Mail) - More
 than 300 acres of fertile Cholwon
 valley land astride the 151-mile
 truce corridor fringing the north-
 ern reaches of the Republic of
 Korea will be cultivated for the
 first time since 1953 under a pro-
 gram patterned after Israel's kib-
 butzim farm system.
 A Korean Defense- Ministry
 spokesman said the test program
 will allow 100 farming families-
 most                                                                                                                        of  them headed  by  ex-
 servicemen-to cultivate the land
 and live in strategic hamlets simi-
 lar to Israel's kibbutzim.
 The kibbutz is a farming system
 employed along the Israel-Arab
 border  where  members  of the
 hamlets are capable of both carry-
 ing out self-defense operations and
 farming.
 Strategic Hamlets
 The spokesman said farmers will
 be moved into the Cholwon valley
 strategic hamlets after receiving
 special military  training  which
 will enable them to repel any pos-
 sible attack by north Korean in-
 filtrators.
 At present, the spokesman said,
 more than 45,000 farming families
 are crowded into an area im-
 mediately north of the civilian
 control line hoping to return to
 their old farms inside the army
 controlled area.
 The civilian control line ranges
 from one to four miles below the
 southernmost boundary of the de-
 militarized zone.
 The Ministry plan is to build
 modern farms in the uninhabited
 area using Western farming
 methods as a pioneer project to
 Increase Korea's agricultural capa-
 Army Helps
 The Defense Ministry and
 Korean army units in the area are
 to help the farmers obtain ma-
 chinery,'farming implements and
 to set up special loans.
 The first year's crop alone is ex-
 pected to yield 40,000 bushels of
 grain, the spokesman said,  ex-
 plaining that this project is three-
 fold-to expand farm land, build
 model farms and aid former mem-
 bers of the military.
 Some farmers,  formerly  res'
 dents to the area north of th
 civilian control line, were allowe
 to enter the area in the mornin
 but had to return before sunse
 This practice,  according to  t
 spokesman, did not provide su
 cient time to run farms and t
 farmers could not build homes in -
 side the area.
 He said when the program
 completed, it will provide a co
 siderable amount of farm product;
 to  help  feed  Korea's  growin
 population.

 Motivations' for
 Development Stressed
 By BRIJ B. KIIARE
 The Asian Student
 Campus Correspondent
 Columbia, Missouri - "Why d
 others? What are the motivations
 for economic, social and political
 development?  To identify  these
 motivations is to explain human
 behavior  which has policy im-
 plications for modernization in the
 developing nations of Asia." These
 ideas were discussed last week by
 Dr. Udai Pareek during a Univer-
 sity Assembly Lecture on "Motiva-
 tion for Development in South
 Asia,"  followed  by  a  Faculty-
 Graduate Student Colloquium on
 "Problems of Behavioral Science
 Research in South Asia."
 Dr. Udai Pareek is a visiting as-
 sociate professor of psychology at
 the Population Center, University
 of North Carolina. He is director,
 Extension Education at the Small
 Industry Extension Training In-
 stitute, Hyderabad, India, and col-
 laborating editor of Manas. He has
 been on the editorial boards of the
 Indian Journal of Psychology and
 Psychologia. His long list of pub-
 lications includes Studies in Rural
 Leadership, Behavioral Science
 Research in India: his two forth-
 coming books are Training for De-
 velopment, and The Process of
 Change in Education.
 Based on his experiences of re-
 search, Dr, Pareek pointed out that
 there are to be found intercultural
 differences within the same coun-
 try. With this in mind, programs
 of development can be charted and
 changed because the present cen-
 tury is one of plan changes. He
 said that this is the concept of
 manipulative mobilization which
 the planners of all emerging na-
 tions must realize if their goal is
 fast industrialization.
 Psychological Factors
 But development does not occur
 by mustering resources alone, em-
 phasized Dr. Pareek. Having eco-
 nomic resources or foreign ex-
 change is not enough. The psy-
 chologicalfactors also play an Im-
 portant part. For example, one kind
 of motivation'is related to one kind
 of behavior. A general model of
 social system generating motiva-
 tions, which in turn determined the
 individual behavior, was discussed
 in detail by Dr. Pareek.
 He referred to Professor McClel-
 land's The Achieving Society, and
 the research design based on need
 for achievement which were rep-
 licated in India. This primary mo-
 tivation, Dr. Pareek continued, is
 related to a concern for excellence
 in the performance of work. Sim-
 ilarly,  economic  development is
 caused by the need for achieve-
 ment.
 A  second kind of motivation
 which Dr. Parcels considered very
 crucial is the need for extension.
 "How do people integrate them-
 selves with their society," asked
 the Indian psychologist. He re-
 plied that development takes place
 when individuals integrate their
 own interests with those of the
 s"Lie'ty.  That  is,  social  changes
 are caused by those individuals,
 namely the modernizing elite, who
 are concerned with the betterment
 of others. It is possible when re-
 gional, parochial or group inter-
 ests are made subservient to the
 interests of a large community.
 Professor Pareek said that they
 have devised psychological tests
 to determine the extent of these
 motivations. In an experimental
 design conducted in Hyderabad,
 India,  motivation  training  was
 given to 60 people in a town. Their
 influence in a community of 100,-
 000 was measured. This induced
 level of motivation was then con- I

 tioned about a longitudinal study
 now  being  conducted  in  India
 which will last for 10 years. It is
 Council of Research and Educa-
 tion. The purpose is to study the
 achievement motivations of high
 school students for this duration.
 The significance of this research is
 to evaluate the effect of depend-
 ency needs upon entrepreneurship.
 Dr. Pareek hypothesizes that the
 need for dependency is as impor-
 tant a variable as the need for
 achievement  in  the  process  of
 modernization. The difference is
 that the need for dependency is
 negatively related to national de-
 velopment.
 Dependency Motive
 Professor Udai Pareek observed
 that the dependency motive is re-
 flected in, and probably caused by,
 the system of hierarchy prevailing
 in the social structure of Asian
 countries. Certainly, it is the main
 feature of the extended families
 and bureaucracies. Under these
 circumstances, individuals are
 afraid of taking responsibility.
 They are reluctant to take moder-
 ate risks which are sufficient con-
 ditions for the need for achieve-
 ment. Unless proper measures are
 taken to nullify the negative ef-
 fects of dependency need no de-
 velopment or change is possible.
 Professor Udai Pareek's visit to
 the University of Missouri was co-
 sponsored by the South Asia Lan-
 guage and Area Center and the
 Department of Psychology. The
 South Asia Program, now in its
 second year, is being directed by
 Dr. Paul Wallace, assistant pro-
 fessor of political science. The pro-
 gram offers a series of courses in
 the social sciences and humanities.
 It was founded by Dr. Nobei P.
 Gist, chairman of the Departm nt'
 of Sociology, in order to serve this
 area of the Midwest, and was ex-
 panded last fall with a grant of
 $30,000 from the US Office of Edu-
 cation. In December  1000,  the
 South Asia Program was awarded
 two Graduate  National Defense
 Foreign Language fellowships for

 First Albino
 Gorilla Found
 From the National Geographic
 Society in Washington, D.C., came
 word last week that the first albino
 gorilla known to science has been
 discovered.
 The 55-pound, two-year-old ani-
 mal was found clinging to the body
 of his mother, shot while raiding
 a banana patch last October in
 Rio Muni, Spanish Equatorial
 Guinea, Africa.
 The National Geographic's ac-
 count said the baby is "a typical
 young gorilla in every respect but
 one: he is an .albino. The hair, Is
 white, skin pink and eyes blue."
 Now in the Barcelona Zoo, he
 has been nicknamed "Coptiva de

 it before the hot sun of my creditors. But in any case it is
 hard to ignore unless you are a mystic living in the Himalayas
 or some such place.
 What brought all this on was the
 difficulty I experienced today
 when t was purchasing my frugal
 lunch. These new coins that Uncle
 has turned out of late are rather
 hard to distinguish. On occasion-
 and this was one-I find myself
 giving some tradesman a penny
 when I mean to give him a dime.
 While it has been explained to me
 that there is a shortage of silver
 and that the laminated abortions
 we now get are necessary to save
 the economy,  I still don't like
 them.
 In this part of the country there
 is a neighboring state where
 gambling is legal. Until a couple of
 years ago, the coin generally used
 in the gambling "hells" was the
 silver dollar, a heavy and noble
 coin. If by some chance you latched
 on to more than 10 of them you
 felt, that you were carrying around
 a.fortune. Now I understand that
 these have been replaced by plastic
 chips  that are  redeemable  for
 paper valuta. Bah! It takes all the
 joy out of wagering a small sum
 on the spin of the wheel or the
 fall of the dice. What puzzles me
 is where have all the silver dollars
 gone?  There must be a secret
 horde somewhere-or hordes-but
 I don't know of it.
 On occasion I feel rather sorry
 for the young people of today.

 International Night
 -Courtesy Southern Illinois University
 IN NATIVE COSTUMES-Adding a colorful note to an International night
 held at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, are these young ladies in
 come the thoughts of an ancient
 alumni, so I shall cut it short-but
 there; was a, time when you :could
 get a hamburger for five cents and
 a  milk shake for  10-although
 there was some difficulty in raising
 the wherewithal to purchase these
 things.
 Let me go back a few years
 earlier to Asia. When I was a tot
 in Japan the pen was the medium
 of exchange. As I recall it was on
 a par with the dollar. In any case,
 a silver yen (that I now have' as
 a money clip) was the same size.
 It would buy you a great deal,
 although as a child I seldom had
 my hands on one. I was more
 familiar with the sen, which was
 one one hundredth of a yen,
 Finally, there was a very small
 copper coin worth.one-half of a
 sen that was known as go-Tin or
 five rin. In earlier times I gather
 that the rin was in circulation, but
 as I am not talking of the Paleo-
 lithic age, I understand that it
 had gone out of circulation except
 as a five rin piece. So, if my mathe-
 matics are not completely wrong,
 five rin was one two hundredth of
 a yen. With that insignificant coin,
 similar to the Lung chien in China
 at the same period or the paisa on
 the Indian Subcontinent children
 could buy a piece of candy or
 adults pick up a couple of ciga-
 rettes. Ah me, how the times have
 changed.  So  have  salaries,  of
 course, but I know very blasted
 well that' we were able to buy
 more with our pittances in those
 days than you can today with a
 wad of bills.
 In the course of this investiga-
 tion into the world of finance my
 colleague, who assisted me in this
 expedition into expenditure, dis-
 covered that the word "cash" is
 derived from a Tamil Indian word.
 It is interesting to conjecture how
 it became a part of the English
 language-and  the  Chinese,  for
 that matter, for the common term
 for tung chien or any other type
 of coin was "cash."
 Whatever its origin, it is a de-
 sirable item to have around. At
 one time there were such things
 .aa'gpld coins, but I'doubt if many
 of you would know of them. They
 had the feel of money, or cash, if
 you wish. When you flipped one it
 rang like a fine temple bell. Now,
 at least in this country, you are
 not even supposed to own one
 unless It is In the form of an
 ornament.
 Well, if we stick around long
 enough, we may all get back to
 using the Maria Theresa Baler.
 This, in case you are not familiar
 with it, is a large silver coin that
 is minted nowadays in ' Mexico, I
 believe. It is used widely in the
 Middle East and North Africa and
 Is  the  only  form  of  currency
 trusted by the inhabitants.
 Can      you  blame  them    when
 money is laminated today? What
 next? Plastic discs?
 Ashtra, Ancient Caananite
 Capital, Uncovered in Syria
 A Syrian archaeological expedi-
 tion has discovered Ashtra, an an-
 cient  Caananlte  principality  In
 southern Syria haunted for many
 tenturles by what was known as
 "the curse of the Pharaohs."
 All Abu Assaf, head of a Learn of
 experts from Syria's Department
 of antiquities, disclosed the news of
 the discovery on Feb. 23.
 In a statement, carried by the
 Associated Press, Abu Assaf said
 the wall surrounding Ashtra and
 the main gate of the city have al-
 ready been uncovered beneath a
 hill about 80 miles south of Da-
 mascus.
 Relies Identify City
 The city's identity was revealed
 by relics found near the gate. They
 included lamps and jars, cylindri-
 cal seals, gold rings, necklaces and
 hairpins.
 Abu Assaf said the finds pointed
 out that Ashtra prospered from
 lino to 7I2 R C and Karl ar,?nng o.?_
 ternal commercial relations.
 Among the relics discovered was
 a small bronze statue of a human
 figure covered partially by a thin
 layer of gold, 3,400 years old. The
 statue, dating back to the 14th cen-
 tury B.C., is strikingly similar to
 the gods of the Caunanlie kingdom
 found long ago in northern Syria,
 Abu Assaf said.
 First Historic Reference
 The chronicles of the 12th dy-
 nasty of Egypt's pharaohs make the
 first historic reference to Ashtra. It
 was the pharaohs' habit to fight
 any defiant city beyond their mili-
 tary reach by declaring it a cursed
 principality and then waiting until
 their curse befell the city's people.
 In Ashtra's case it took 10 cen-
 turies for the curse to strike at the
 hands of Assyrian King Teglet

 Inter-University Cooperation in Area Programs
 And the Social Sciences: Asian Problems and Prospects*
 By CHOH-MING LI
 Vice-Chancellor
 The Chinese University
 of Hong Kong
 When I  was asked to spas
 about inter-university cooperation
 in area study programs, I asks
 myself the following questions:
 are. stu
 eii
 What disciplines are we
 to 1 elude
 In area study programs?
 What is the present state of area
 studies in Asian universities?
 What conditions seem to be favor-
 able to the development of these
 programs?
 What are the forms of Inter-tlniver-
 aity cooperation involving social
 sciences I. Asian universities?    -
 And, anally, what are some of the
 goals that we might net for Inter-
 university  cooperation  in  area
 atudies?
 Since Asia. has such it wide di-
 versity of countries, cultures, and
 universities,. I frankly was quite
 reluctant to talk in general terms
 about these questions. Even a cur-
 sory view of Asian diversity is
 sufficient warning that one must
 avoid sweeping statements 'about
 the area. However, since there are
 many problems and characteristics
 that are shared by universities
 throughout Asia, I felt there was
 et least sufficient evidence to pro-
 vide our distinguished visitors here
 today with some guidelines and
 thoughts for discussion.
 Therefore, with the appropriate
 reservations and qualifications In
 mind, let me move cautiously to
 ray questions.
 What Are Study Programs?
 My first question asked "What
 clo we mean by area study pro-
 grams?" Rather than give an irn-
 raediate answer to this, let me
 place area study programs within
 the larger context of social sclei)ce
 research Institutes found in uni-
 t ersities around the world. Uri
 t ersittes Save a wide variety
 social science centers and insti-
 tutes, but for present purposes we
 might point to four kinds, First,
 there are centers organized around
 well-established disciplines and
 departments-for example, eco-
 nomic research centers and educa-
 tional research centers. The fac-
 ulty, teaching, and research  of
 these centers are. not necessarily
 oriented to an understanding of
 any particular country, although
 this in fact is the normal situation.
 For the most part, these centers
 use the tools of only one discipline
 in analyzing a traditional range of
 issues relating to a single nation.
 Second, there are centers organ-
 ized  around particular methods
 that are used in several disciplines.
 Survey research centers are the
 best and perhaps only example of
 this kind of organization. Since
 they are usually designed to facil-
 itate the research efforts of faculty
 by means of providing sampling,
 interviewing, and tabulation serv-
 ices, their focus is almost exclu-
 sively on the home country where
 it is possible to develop these re-
 sources.
 Third, there are a number of
 institutes that are beginning to
 focus primarily but not exclusively
 art overseas countries, -especially
 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin
 America. There are a variety of
 such centers. For example, centers
 for the study of developing socie-
 ties and centers for international
 comparative studies often utilize a
 wide range of social science dis-
 ciplines and methodologies to study
 an equally wide range of countries
 in all the developing areas. These
 centers tend to undertake multi-
 nation programs In social science
 studies:
 Different from these three kinds
 of programs are the fourth type
 which may be identified as area

 Editor's Note: At a meeting sponsored by The Asia Foundation
 in Hong Kong-Dec. 18-21, 10 uni"versity presidents, vice chancel-
 lors and vice-presidents from Asia, the United States and Aus-
 tralia discussed "University Cooperation and Asian Development."
 Conference papers covered a wide range of topics, generally ex-
 ploring the possibility of regional cooperation among universities
 in advancing studies in the physical and social sciences, law and
 the humanities, and the role of universities in research and public
 papers presented at the Hong Kong conference. In the previous
 weeks, "The Asian Student" carried papers by Dr. Kazuo Okochi,
 president of the University of Tokyo, Dr. Grayson L. Kirk, presi-
 dent of Columbia University, Charles J. Hitch, vice-president of
 the University for Administration, University of California, Dr.
 Haydn Williams, president of The Asia Foundation, Dr. S. L.
 Chien, president of National Taiwan University, and Zelman
 Cowen, vice-chancellor of the University of New England, Armt-
 dale, NSW, Australia.
 study programs per se. Instead of
 relying on only one social science
 discipline and method, a variety of
 disciplines and methods are used;
 and instead of focussing on many
 countries in different continents,
 the program has as its center of
 concernall the countries In a de-
 fined geographical  and  cultural
 area, such as Southeast Asia, South
 Asian or even Latin America, For
 some very large, complex, and im-
 portant countries-such as China,
 India, and Russia - the program
 may focus on only a single nation.
 Area study programs, then, have
 a defined geographical focus and a
 variety of disciplines, methodolo-
 gies; and, intellectual perspectives.
 These centers have the advantage
 of organizing faculty,' library, re-
 search and training resources, as
 well as research funds, for an
 inter-disciplinary approach to
 problems of a particular country
 and region. Needless to say, these
 problems often are vitally relevant
 to, tho.: development? goals of. the
 countries and regions being
 studied.
 What Disciplines are included
 In Area Study Programs?
 It Is somewhat a moot point to
 argue whether one discipline
 should be included or excluded
 from an area study program. In
 fact, we have languages and hu-
 manities together with economics,
 political  science, ? sociology,  and
 anthropology. We also have history
 and business administration. One of
 the strong points of area study pro-
 grams is that social science re-
 search is established on a firm lin-
 guistic, cultural, and historical
 base. However, the exciting intel-
 lectual developments in area study
 programs over the pastgeneration
 have been provided by the social
 sciences. I would hazard the
 prophecy that the exciting Intel-
 lectual developments in the next
 generation will be provided by so-
 cial scientists who turn their at-
 tention to international compara-
 tive studies on an intra-regional
 and inter-regional basis...
 What Is the Present State of
 Area Studies in Asian
 Universities
 Area study programs, as de-
 scribed so far, are programs of so-
 cial science studies, and, therefore,
 when we ask "What is the present
 state of area studies In Asian uni-
 versities," we are also asking the
 more general question of "What is
 the present state of the social sci-
 ences In Asian tinlvoroItloa?" Fur-
 thermore, since our discussion of
 area study programs was framed
 in research as well as in teaching
 terms, we must also ask "What is
 the present state of social science
 research in Asian universities?"
 These are very big and very im-
 portant questions ... Three issues
 seem especially relevant: (1) the
 significance- of having a colonial
 background, (2) the character of
 Asian universities, and (3) the re-
 search orientations of university
 faculties. Let us look at each of
 these issues separately.
 First, most of the countries in
 Asia are ex-colonies, and in coun-
 tries where universities were es-
 tablished by the colonial govern-
 ments, special attention had long
 been given to the metropolitan re-
 gion and its cultural heritage. The
 study of neighboring countries and
 colonies was muted by this colo-
 nial bind.
 We might also note that the uni-
 versities in the metropolitan re-
 gions-Great Britain, France, and
 the Netherlands-were rather slow
 and conservative in the develop-
 ment of modern methods of empir-
 ical social science research. This is
 especially true with regard to so-
 ciology and political science. As a
 consequence, in establishing colo-
 nial universities patterned after
 the metropolitan model; the colo-
 nial governments tended to ex-
 port a university tradition that to-
 day is inappropriate' to= the needs
 of Asian ;governments for social
 science researchon issues ielevant
 to-the country's development needs.
 My second point pertains to the
 kind of higher education institu-
 tions we have today in Asia, es-
 peeially- Southeast Asia. Frankly,
 most of them'are-none other than
 four-year colleges, and, for the
 most part, it'does'no't seem that
 the colleges or their governments
 have formulated a clear philosophy
 of?higheredubhtion?. Although the
 creation of high quality univer-
 sities is one of the important de-
 velopment goals of governments in
 Asia, it is not certain whether
 these universities are ends In them-
 selves, institutions limited to train-
 Ing the future elite, or whether
 they are multi-purpose organiza-
 tions providing training, conduct-
 ing basic research, and contribut-
 ing in a variety of practical ways
 to the community that supports
 them.          -
 The absence of a research-
 minded faculty and administra-
 tions is related to the character of
 the four-year college and the am-
 biguity of the university's pur-
 For the most part; they are small
 four-year colleges with only fledg-
 ling  programs  In  graduate
 studies.... We provide basic un-
 dergraduate training at home,
 while our graduate schools are in
 America, Britain, and Europe. This
 may or may not be a healthy and
 economical situation, but it is a
 fact that most of us are living
 with.. , .
 These various influences-the
 the university, and the absence of
 faculty research interests-have
 contributed to the present state of
 the social sciences and area study
 programs in Asia. The social sci-
 ences are under-developed, and
 area study programs are practi-
 cally non-existent.
 What Conditions Seem to be
 Favorable to the Development
 of Area Programs?
 Although only a few Asian uni-
 versities have area study programs,
 I think we have enough informa-
 tion now to suggest what is needed
 in order to develop such programs
 in the future. Let me suggest three
 especially important conditions.
 First, as countries in Asia have
 become  independent, they have
 naturally developed their own in-
 dividual national interests. Some
 of these interests relate to neigh-
 boring countries for which no reli-
 able information and understand-
 ing is available. It is not surprising
 that some national governments
 are inclined to provide'the national
 university with the financial sup-
 port to create programs of research
 on neighboring countries. The role
 of national interest was no doubt
 important in the decision of India
 to create the first chair of Chinese
 Studies a year ago at the Univer-
 sity of New Delhi, and similar in-
 terests may have motivated Chi-
 nese study programs in Japanese
 universities. As Asian countries
 are brought closer together in the
 future, we can expect that there
 will be an increased awareness of
 the need of still greater informa-
 tion about neighboring countries.
 These developments will in turn
 encourage the creation of addi-
 tional area study programs.
 Since the social sciences are the
 primary contributors to area study
 programs, another condition for
 the development of these programs
 is the development of social sci-
 ences. Through national and inter-
 national programs to be discussed
 again later, this development is
 occurring quite rapidly In most
 Asian countries. As a result, we
 should soon have the intellectual
 resources for the creation of area
 study programs.      -
 The third condition is the grow-
 ing interest in research on the part
 of university social scientists.
 Without such a development, there
 would be no need for governments
 to support area  study programs
 within the universities, for the
 basic research needed on other na-
 tions could be done within gov-
 ernment itself... .
 What Are the Forms of Inter-
 University Cooperation in the
 Social Sciences?
 Given the limited resources for
 Choh-ming Li, vice-chancellor of the Chinese University of
 Hong Kong, was born in China and is a naturalized American
 citizen. He was educated at the University of Nanking and re-
 ocived his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at the University of Califor-
 nia at Berkeley.
 Dr. Li's teaching career has taken him to Nankai, Southwest
 Associated, and National Central Universities in China as pro-
 fessor of economics (1937-43), and to the University of Cali-
 fornia at Berkeley as professor of business administration and
 director of the Center for Chinese Studies (1951-63). In 1964
 he was appointed to his present position.
 From 1945-47, Dr. Li was deputy director-general of the
 Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration
 (CNRRA) and in 1948 and 1949 was permanent delegate of
 the Republic of China to the United Nations Economic Com-
 mission for Asia and the Far East. In 1949 and 1950 he was
 chairman of 'the Board 'of Trustees for Rehabilitation Affairs
 of the National Government of China.
 social science research  within
 Asian countries, and given the
 need for a wider perspective on
 and knowledge about the region, it
 is only natural that we look to
 ways of pooling our resources and
 perspectives in  a way  that will
 benefit one another. In this regard,
 ferent kinds of inter-university co-
 operation involving social science
 research in Asia.
 First, two or more universities
 within a single country occasion-
 ally cooperate with one another.
 Some universities are sharing a
 common research facility, such as
 a computer, and some universities
 have  divided  responsibilities
 among them In a common research
 project. Informal faculty colloquia
 designed to develop faculty re-
 search  interests  and                                                                                                                                                               expertness
 are still another way in which so-
 cial scientists from                                                                                                                                                                different
 universities cooperate  with  one
 another.
 Second, universities from two or
 more countries within the same re-
 gion cooperate with one another....
 Third, a university in a develop-
 ing country cooperates with one or
 more universities from a Western
 country. This is a very common
 and extremely valuable form of
 assistance to Asian universities.
 For example, The Chinese Univer-
 sity of Hong Kong is cooperating
 with the University of California
 in a number of ways beneficial to
 the social sciences. We hope that
 this will be especially helpful in
 developing faculty resources, for
 we are sending promising young
 faculty and students to California
 for further training, and in return
 California sends us visiting pro-
 fessors, as well as graduate fellows
 and undergraduates....
 The fourth kind of inter-univer-
 sity cooperation involves two or
 more Western universities.  The
 London-Cornell project is an ex-
 ample of this kind of program....
 What Goals Should We Set for
 Inter-University Cooperation
 in Area Studies and the
 Social Sciences?
 Now that we have talked in gen-
 eral terms about forms of inter-
 university cooperation, let me
 move next to what the purposes of
 cooperation  should  be  between
 Western and Asian universities.
 Although I have just alluded to
 this issue, it is so important that I
 would like to touch on it again.
 Asian universities must be very ,
 clear in their mind regarding the
 ways that inter-university cooper-
 ation is to benefit their faculties
 and institutions. Of course, every
 university worthy of the name will
 do everything in its power to assist
 scholars and students visiting from
 Western universities. However, be-
 cause we have only limited re-
 sources, we must be absolutely
 sure that programs affecting fac-
 ulty time and university resources
 are unequivocally beneficial to our
 faculty and - students. Specifically,
 we must be certain that inter-
 university programs help us de-
 velop our faculty to a stage where
 it is completely capable of playing
 all the major roles within the uni-
 versity.                            ,.
 Moreover, given the  underde-
 veloped stage of social science re-
 search in many of our universities,
 the other basic purpose of these
 programs is to provide academic
 leadership in research during the
 period that our own faculty's cap-
 abilities are being developed. We
 have been adopting this strategy
 in The Chinese University by ap-
 pointing outstanding foreign re-
 search scholars to the directorships
 of our leading social science re-
 search centers. I emphasize the

 A New Source
 Of UN Finance
 T HE United Nations cannot func-
 Lion efficiently, especially in its
 pence-keeping mission, If It Is not
 financially solvent. In recent years
 it has come pgrilously close to in, solvency because of the failure of
 sonic nations to pay their dues.in
 time and the refusal of others to
 meet the special peace-keeping as-
 sessments. Though a formula was
 found in the form of subscriptions
 to UN bonds to avert the fiscal
 crisis, the basic defect in the pres-
 ent scheme of financing the world
 organization remains.
 A new source of a steady and
 adequate revenue for the UN, free
 from the political squabble over
 pro-rated dues and proportional
 assessments in the present system,
 should be found.
 Senator Frank Church, a United
 States delegate to the UN, has
 come up with a sound suggestion.
 He urged that the UN be given
 ownership of the ocean's mineral
 resources.
 In his report to the Senate For-
 eign Relations Committee, Senator
 Church (Dem., Idaho) said, "The
 gicntest untapped reservoir of the
 world's wealth lies beyond national
 jurisdiction and under title to no
 nation, at the bottom of the seas... .

 name of either a missionary-edu-

 contribution to the school or a

 school. The Underwood family is

 universities in Asia are now in a

 of our universities already have
 the resources necessary for initiat-

 not have the resources necessary
 for developing adequate area study

 Apart From the Other Malays
 MASK OF ASIA: The Phil-
 ippines Today, by George
 Farwell. Praeger, New York,
 1966; 227 pp., $6.95.
 This unique book is a tour de
 force, not unsuccessful. In 20 chap-
 ters and 200 pages George Farwell
 telescopes his account of the Phil-
 333 years under Spain, 48 under
 the United States and the 20 years
 of their independence. A brief re-
 view of such a book will perforce
 paraphrase much, directly quote
 very little.
 P:?ior to 1565 there was the long
 cultural influence of Mother India
 with an overlay of Islam at the
 end, a much briefer period, during
 which peaceful commerce pre-
 vailed, both domestic and foreign.
 The missionary friars, whose zeal-
 ousness matched their ignorance,
 destroyed everything associated
 with this period and improvised
 new beginning, the Introduction
 and acceptance of a very mundane
 Christianity. They found a mild
 type of servitude persisting under
 the rajahs,  continued in ruler-
 ship as Christians, and provided
 one religion for the submissive
 poor, a more enlightened one for
 the rich: quite as they had done in
 Spanish America.
 Miracles and Superstitions
 Miracles and superstitions would
 suffice for the Masses, while that
 for their masters included a little
 learning; and a little learning is a
 dangerous thing. Arbitrarily, this
 set the Philippines people apart
 from their brothers in Indonesia
 and culminated in piracy that, with
 ups and downs, still persists. In
 the end, all lowlanders accepted
 the novel new faith, but the high-
 landers, the_Igorots, the Ifugaos
 and their cousins of less impor-
 tance, or notoriety at least, were
 never reached. Against Mindanao
 and Sulu Muslims, wars of lead
 and sword were waged incessantly,
 and, on the whole, the Muslims
 had the better of it during the cen-
 CPYRGHT
 tury ended in the sixth decade of
 the 19th century, when (Farwell
 makes no specific note of this),
 steam-powered gunboats from
 Europe proved able to deal with
 the Muslim's vintas.
 Meantime, the friars together
 with the Jesuits built a thousand
 parish  churches  throughout the
 lowlanders'  area, all by corvee
 (again omitted by Farwell), 40
 days forced labor annually by all
 men between 18 and 40 years of
 age. Spain's monarchs paid each
 missionary 100 pesos a year; and
 the whole Spanish community lived-
 the husband strives to keep it re-
 plenished. All that Farwell, in_;a
 brief year, saw superficially, has
 a deeper, sounder aspect than he
 could have been aware of.
 Here's a direct .quote from Far-
 well:         r r"g
 "The trend of young men today
 is away from politics. The edu-
 cated, the alert, the` university-
 trained are thpse. days going into
 the world of comine?ce..   . the

 Farwell notes that racism is co.
 extensive with the whiteman's
 world: In the Philippines in cases
 of mixed marriages, and they were
 many, as under the Dutch in In-
 donesia, the bride rose to her hus-
 band's class. Thus the privileged
 maintained their authority,  over
 the poor. However, on Dec. 30,
 1896, the Churchmen shot Jose
 Rizal whose novels of. protest had
 they Were secretly imported,
 smuggled In bales of piecegoods by
 friendly merchants, and read by
 thousands (though Farwell, again,
 makes no mention of how they
 reached the people), and the fat
 was in the fire.
 To forge ahead hurriedly, the
 American regime began In 1898,
 and civil government surplanted
 military administration in July,
 1901-a truly great statesman at
 its head, Wm. H. Taft, under per-
 haps even a greater War Secre-
 tary, Elihu B. Root who drafted
 the McKinley Instructions to the
 Taft Commission ". . . we are not
 in the Philippines for our own
 benefit, but for the benefit of the
 Filipinos."
 The need of the Philippines for
 everything led inevitably to some
 modification of Root's basic prin-
 ciple.
 Different Classes
 The reader may take it from
 there. The upper class still rules,
 the poor, 80% of the population,
 rapidly growing, still toil, and till
 the soil under usurious land rents.
 And yet, despite every conceiv-
 able handicap, a middle class is
 successfully wedging itself between
 the hopeless poor and the arrogant
 rich. Again overlooked by Farwell
 -after all, he limits himself to
 200 pages!-this progress is due to
 the fact that Mother India left the
 Filipinos, anciently, a priceless
 heritage: every family is a matri-
 archy, the wife manages the purse,
 developed to maturity without vio-
 lence, corruption, greed, and In-
 justice.' Historically, this has been
 true of many countries, notably the
 United States, Australia, Mexico,
 in their earlier stages at least."
 Farwell fails of according jus-
 tice to the eight-year Harrison ad-
 ministration, whose all-Filipino
 cabinet was able and upright be-
 yond cavil or dispute.

 were  from  persons  devoted  to
 blackening the Harrison adminis-

 WITH MacARTHUR IN JA-
 PAN:-A Personal History of
 the Occupation, by William
 Sebald, with Russell Brines.
 e     l' ?4 FTNew York,
 318 pp., $6.95.
 William Sebald was United
 tates Ambassador in Japan dur-
 g the years following the sur-
 nder in 1945 of the Japanese mil-
 :sty forces. He was the senior
 epresentative of the US State De-
 artment, but the actual control
 f the occupied country was in the
 ands of the Army, and in fact in
 lands
 e hands of one man: General of
 e Army Douglas MacArthur.
 This is an account of that rela-
 onship, and Ambassador Sebald
 ould be congratulated for his
 w key account of what must
 ave been one of the most frus-
 ating jobs ever created. Without
 tual power he was required to
 cal with the Japanese Govern-
 ent as the American representa-
 ve - on a civilian basis - but
 ithout any power to make im-
 ortant decisions. These were the
 solute responsibility of The Gen-
 al-as his wife and aides called
 (Others who were involved
 the Occupation had different
 ames, but as many were libelous,
 ey will not be mentioned in this
 eview.) Under these circum-
 ances,Ambassador Sebald had to
 cad with the utmost diplomacy,
 nd it would seem that he per-
 rmcd his task well.
 Fascinating Accounts
 While most of this book is an
 ccount of the Occupation that
 oat of the students of the time
 ould be well acquainted with,
 ere are portions that are most
 scinating in casting a spotlight
 n a great general and a highly
 ontroversial man.
 and in time it appears that he
 strode in the robes of assumption.
 Ambassador Sebald, in one of
 the most revealing parts of this
 interesting book, tells of a meeting
 with MacArthur after the United
 plained to its Foreign Office that
 MacArthur had ignored them. This
 complaint, in turn, had been sent
 to the US State Department, which
 relayed it to Ambassador Sebald.
 It became his unpleasant task to
 convey it to the general. Mac-
 Arthur, in the vernacular, blew
 his stack.
 As Sovereign
 "When I suggested," Sebald says,
 "that it might be useful were he
 to meet occasionally with various
 chiefs of diplomatic missions in
 Tokyo to give them a firsthand
 rundown on Korea, he promptly
 said that this would serve no use-
 ful purpose; moreover, they had no
 responsibility in Korea. 'And why,'
 he added, 'as a sovereign, should
 I? President Truman doesn't do so,
 nor does the King of England or
 any other head of state.'."
 This is an amazing statement for
 any American to make and sounds
 as if it had come from a Roman
 pro-consul in Spain or Gaul. But,
 in essence, this was what Mac-
 Arthur was - a pro-consul. No
 other American In history ever
 had the powers that were granted
 him. Whether he exercised them
 wisely or not Is a question for his-
 tory to decide.
 Ambassador Sebald apparently
 feels that on the whole he did a
 good job. To those of us who were
 involved in the Occupation in a
 minor role and have watched Jap-
 anese reaction since, this is open
 to doubt. But the Ambassador-
 who, by the way, knows his Japan

 service there-tells an interesting

 A MORTAL FLOWER;
 China - Autobiography and
 History, by Han Suyin. G. P.
 Putnam's Sons, New York,
 ,
 This is the second volume o
 Han Suyin's ambitious series of
 autobiographical books that may
 come to five or six. It covers the
 turbulent years between 1928 and
 1938 in China when the author
 grew up to be a young lady. In this
 volume she writes with even a
 surer hand than in the first vol-
 ume, The Crippled Tree, for she
 lived through this entire period,
 whereas for the earlier part of the
 period from 1885 to 1928 in The
 Crippled Tree, when she was not
 yet born, she has to depend upon
 other people's memoirs, letters and
 hearsay, for the latter part she has
 to rely on her childhood memories.
 Still willful, ambitious and un-
 loved by her mother, she now grew
 up as a young Eurasian girl in
 Peking, faced with all the special
 problems in social and emotional
 relationships.
 She was determined to be a
 medical doctor and first did clerical
 work at the Peking Union Medical
 College to make a living. She had
 her first love affair, that she de-
 scribes with frankness. Later, she
 entered  Y'enching  University
 where oho was subject to ostracism
 because of her friendships with
 foreigners. Then she went to study
 medicine In Belgium, 1935 to 1938.
 In 1938, after the outbreak of the
 Sino-Japanese war, she broke off
 her studies and returned to China
 to rally to its support.
 Background of Turbulence
 Her personal story is told against
 the background of turbulent events
 In China: the rise of Chiang Kai-
 shek, the formation of the Chinese
 Communist Party, the split be-
 tween the Nationalists and the
 Communists, the extermination
 KaftheR against  a  ommun s s,
 the Sian Incident and the Japanese
 threat and invasions, first of Man-
 churia, then of China Proper.
 Paraded before our eyes are
 many  political  figures:  Chiang
 Kai-shek, Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-
 lai, Chu Teh, Madame Chiang Kai-
 shek, and others.
 She is critical of Chiang Kai-
 shek and his Government.
 She is also critical of American
 policy. She writes, "For already in
 the 1850s America had begun to
 dream of the conquest of Asia;
 since then she has been on the
 march, designing to reign first on
 the Pacific, then in Asia, later-
 who knows?"
 .Of Viet Nam
 Of Viet Nam she says: "Many
 of us in Asia think it more digni-
 fied to apologize, than to go on, as
 America Is doing, losing not only
 face but honor, and gaining the
 world's contempt for the death she
 rains down upon an unfortunate
 small country, Viet Nam, because
 America, so large, so wealthy, is
 unable to admit to a mistake in
 judgment."
 She tells about the story of the
 Chinese Communist, and especially
 Mao Tse-tung's mountain fortress
 of Chingkangshan in Kiangsi Prov-
 ince and the Long March based
 upon her interviews with veteran
 Communists. Directly from their
 lips it smacks of propaganda.

 Global Peace
 Structure
 IF a sound structure of global
 peace with justice cannot read-
 ily be built upon the weak frame-
 work of a global organization com-
 mitted to universality, on what
 should we attempt to erect It?
 The answer would seem to be:
 the strong foundation of those na-
 tions who would genuinely accept
 the principles underlying this
 structure and be ready to cooper-
 ate wholeheartedly in the task of
 constructing it.
 It may be said that they would,
 In the first instance, comprise only
 a relatively small portion of the
 world, and that consequently the
 body which linked them would be
 weak.
 True enough, membership would
 probably be rather small at first,
 not so much that there are few
 nations who accept the principles
 on which such a body would be
 based, as that there are few gov-
 ernments prepared to commit
 themselves to an unknown.
 But this would not make the
 body weak. Unity and strength of
 purpose would, on the contrary,
 make It strong-far stronger than
 any larger organization composed
 of members with. conflicting aims
 and purposes..
 And, as the value of joining such
 a body became apparent, we would
 gradually find all those countries
 which believed in its Ideals and
 objectives joining in and extending
 the scope of Its authority and in-
 fluence.
 It would not be realistic to ex-
 pect ifte    ents which did not
 tB ept`thes   ekli-eltd>objeetiusa.
 to Join. They would obviously. be
 hostile to the organization and seek
 to undermine it.
 But this would no more be a
 valid reason for abandoning the
 idea of such a body than the hos-
 tility of criminals would be valid
 reason for abandoning our present
 system  of  community  law and
 order.
 And, being outside the organiza-
 tion, these hostile governments
 would be far less able to sabotage
 the development of the suggested
 global body than if they were in-
 side It.

 Mad Angiotensin
 KNOW what Angiotensin is? It,,
 what causes high blood pres-
 ;ure.
 One could make a list from here
 o the moon of what are commonly
 ?ecognized as causes of high blood
 eressure:  bad drivers, blaring
 rublic address systems, queue
 rreakers, unsympathetic bureau-
 rats, inflated bar bills, etc.
 It comes as news, however, that
 undamentally it is a chemical sub-
 tance in the blood stream that Is
 esponsible. And such infinitesimal
 mounts of it are enough to start
 he life fluid gushing.
 A couple of researchers at the
 :yushu University Hospital have
 eported success In isolating this
 ubstance, called Angiotensin, for
 ee first time anywhere. Not only
 eat,  they have. determined  its
 hemical structure and succeeded
 a synthesizing it.
 Why in the world should they
 'alit to? Surely, there is little to
 e gained by manufacturing the
 tuft for the market.
 Just as nobody would expect to
 o a good, business of selling cs
 car virus, if there Is such a thing.
 But in the wonderful world of
 medical science half of. the battle
 is identifying the enemy. For such
 a common and often misunder-
 stood thing as high blood pressure,
 that should be a notable achieve-
 ment.
 Although the researchers have
 not been so explicit In their prog-
 nostications, It seems that the ul-
 timate. thing their work points to-
 ling blood pressure. This chemical
 line of attack offers new hope-
 and more, certainly, than any ap-
 proach that might be made to those
 everyday, commonly recognized
 causes of blood pressure,

 Student Rumbles
 C / +ONTINUING clashes between
 ll ti student  and youth  groups,
 some of them with fatal results,
 do not seem to attract the atten-
 tion of those who should be con-
 cerned, presumably for lack of ap-
 preciation of the juvenile delin-
 quency problems involved.
 Cases of student rumbles have
 developed disturbing patterns of
 thinking and behavior among our
 young. These have shown that our
 youths, in and out of school, go
 about armed with deadly weapons,
 including firearms.
 They also go around in groups,
 like wolf packs, poised for trouble.
 Gangs also maintain feuds
 against. each  other,  particularly
 those belonging to different schools,
 with raids and retaliatory action
 as part of standard operating pro-
 cedures. There are likewise rival
 groups in some colleges that en-
 gage in Intramural clashes.
 All these have demonstrated at-
 titudes  and  behavioral patterns
 that could require correction if the
 next generation of leaders of
 thought and action is to be saved
 ft'om destructive and anarchic
 tendencies.
 There have been too much bend-
 ing backward, over-indulgence and
 downright collusion in dealing with
 juvenile  delinquency. In  all  its
 manifestations. It would seem that
 parents, guardians, school authori-
 ties, and the whole society itself
 are  indifferent  to  the  monster

 Unless everybody wakes .up to
 the evil in our midst and does
 something about it-at home, in

 deserved condemnation by those
 who will come in our wake.

 Union Day
 TODAY.marks-the 20th anniver-
 sary of Union Day, A mass rally
 attended by over 100,000 woiking
 people is to, mark the occasioni in
 Rangoon, the venue of this year's
 anniversary celebrations.... The
 rally today-.has been-preceded by
 a two-day discussion of the Aim of
 Union Day.by over one thousand
 delegates and .over
 of the na-
 tional races. The discussion clearly
 brought into prominence, If the
 people are to endure as an inde-
 pendent nation, politically free
 and economically prosperous and
 socially just and stable, the na-
 tional races must live and work in
 fraternity, unity, and In unassail-
 able solidarity. To bring about this
 happy state of mutual trust, love,
 and respect among the national
 races, the Revolutionary Council
 has proclaimed the National Races
 Policy and Belief. The Policy first
 proposed to the national races at
 the.l7th anniversary of Union Day
 celebrated in Mandalay has re-
 ceived the acclaim of the people.
 It is to translate this policy Into
 reality that all must strive relent-
 lessly, dedicatedly.
 The Policy in esssence aims at
 removing all factors spawned by
 feudalism . . . which has shown
 dissension and distrust among the
 national races. These factors had
 in the past militated against har-
 monious relations not only between
 one race and another but also be-
 tween one class of people and
 another. Today, the LANZIN-the
 Burmese Way to Socialism-has
 laid down social and economic
 piinciples in a political philosophy
 consonant with the people's tradi-
 tion and culture, their environment
 and their life. There is now noth-
 ing to militate against reviving and
 re-establishing the cordial rapport
 nity, unity, and solidarity. All that
 is needed today to recreate that
 united nation is for the national
 races to realize that they are of
 one blood and their interests are
 bound together. That one cannot
 hope to remain safe and well
 should the boat sink in dissension
 and strife with the others. That
 one's well-being depends on the
 well-being of the others as well....

 Easy Way Out
 IF cigarette-smoking causes lung
 cancer-as many doctors say-
 and nicotine.is the culprit, it is
 logical to help the helpless with a
 substitute which has all the looks
 but none of the poison of a cig-
 arette. And American techni-
 clans ... have produced a cigarette
 made of lettuce leaves, which in
 appearance, price and smokability
 Is almost as good as the real stuff,
 a kind of weed that cheers but not
 inebriates. It puffs just as well,
 although addicts testify to its
 wrong flavor. But to those who
 want to be weaned the lettuce cig-
 arette is an easy way out. It shows
 that when human ingenuity and
 technology are put together sur-
 prises are always in store. Chasing
 the will-o'-the-wisp of endless
 progress, the West is facing other
 similar  problems. Air pollution,
 for instance. Millions of smoke-
 stacks and automobiles have so
 poisoned the atmosphere that gas
 masks are being seriously sug-
 gested                                                                                                                          as  the  proper  solution.

 scribed, such as LSD. (It was a
 British decimalist who claimed it
 stood for pounds, shillings, pence.)
 Indeed, a whole new generation of
 arty-arty non-conformists styling
 themselves as Hippies has sprung
 up In California; they find the easy
 way out of life's problems by liv-
 ing it up with pills, Even the TV
 syndrome may be avoided, it Is
 said, by building an electronic cir-
 cuit direct from the set- to the
 brain, and a sleeping man may
 watch a show, Unfortunately the
 genius who invented the lettuce
 cigarette Is in no position to think
 of an easy way out of the loneli-
 ness and aimlessness of life in a
 computerized, competitive,  sav-
 agely one-up-man society.

 Convention of Int'l
 Studies Association
 The eighth.annual national con
 vention of the  Internationa
 Studies Association will take plac
 on Friday and Saturday, April 14
 15  on  the  Washington Squat
 campus of New York University 1
 New York City, with ISA Middl
 Atlantic servicing as the host re-
 gional division and with NYU an
 Columbia University serving as the
 co-host institutions.
 Registration and some options
 events have been scheduled for the
 preceding day, Thursday, April 13,
 The program that has been ar-
 ranged so far includes a United
 Nations briefing and tour, an ad-
 dress on "Science, Technology and
 International Politics" by William
 T. R. Fox, panel sessions on such
 subjects as "Methodology in Inter-
 national Studies," "The Scientific
 Challenge," "The Contribution of
 Regional Studies  to an Under-
 standing of World Politics," and
 "The Public Impact on Foreign
 Policy."
 Both Asian and American
 scholars and students are welcome
 to attend the convention.
 The International Studies Asso-
 clutlon was forinally organized on
 April 14, 1960, on the campus of
 the University of California,
 Berkeley, Calif. The founding
 members consisted largely of polit-
 ical scientists on the West Coast,
 but their purpose was not to create
 a new organization for political
 scientists. On the contrary, they
 felt that the study of international
 relations was the major profes-
 sional concern not only of scholars
 in a number of academic disci-
 plines, but also of government and
 international organization officials
 and some individuals in other busi-
 ness and professional fields. The
 primary purpose of the Aspocia-
 tion, therefore, was to provide an
 organizational and communications
 link between these diverse people
 for whom the study of interna-
 tional relations was a major pro-
 fessional concern.
