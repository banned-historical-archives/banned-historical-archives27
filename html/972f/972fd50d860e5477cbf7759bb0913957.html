 Prospects for Red China
 Communist China's Disciplined Millions Challenge the Free World
 CPYRGHT

 Rostow and others, to be published Nov. 5 by the. Technology Press of the Massachusetts Institute of

 CPYRGHT
 By W. W. Rostow
 Center for International Studies, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
 Just one month ago, the latest dynasty to rule over China celebrated the fifth anni-
 versary of its establishment in Peking.
 What are the prospects for this regime? What do its leaders envisage as their objec-
 tives? By what means do they hope to? achieve them? What problems do they face? Is
 Peking likely to launch a major war?
 Obviously, no colriplete answer to these questions can be furnished from this side of
 the Bamboo Curtain. But from available sources, Communist and non-Communist, a
 reasonably coherent picture emerges.
 The Soviet Mode
 Peking's domestic course over the next 10 years
 is clear enough. The top leadership seeks to re-
 peat on the Chinese scene the pattern of domestic:
 transformations carried out by Stalin in the early
 1930's, with a specially urgent emphasis on the
 establishment of a Chinese industrial base for
 the maintenance of its modernized armed forces.
 It seeks simultaneously a related goal: to in-
 crease the independent authority of Peking in
 Asia within the limits permitted by the need
 to maintain the Sino-Soviet alliance and by the
 resource requirements of the industrialization
 program. For the moment, where internal and
 external ambitions conflict (or are made to con-
 flict by an effective free-world policy), the .
 present leadership in Peking is likely to accord
 priority to expansion of its domestic power base.
 urno!
 Communist period, was not adequate to insure
 a large exportable surplus. Moreover, China
 lacks the timber and gold which the Soviet
 Union- could throw in as its grain export
 capabilities declined under the impact of col-
 lectivization and population increase.
 I
 The Chinese Communist regime's problem is
 thus essentially more difficult than Stalin's, and
 success is not assured. Much hinges on the
 course of agricultural output and, especially, on
 the peasant's productivity response to the re-
 gime's grain-control and collectivization meas-
 ures. A repetition in China of the 20 per cent
 fall in agricultural output which marked the
 first Soviet five-year plan would constitute a
 disaster-not to the Chinese people alone, but
 to the regime's ideological pretensions, and prob-
 ably
 In terms of political, social, and cultural pol-
 icy, as well as in economic objectives and tech-
 nique, the actions of the Chinese Communist
 regime as of 1954 strongly recall those of Stalin
 in 1930. Generally, the regime's order to the
 cadres-to take their guidance from Chapters
 9-12 of Stalin's "Short Course"-reflects the fact
 that the regime intends, essentially by Stalin's
 methods, to duplicate in China the results
 achieved by Stalin in the 1930's.
 i   t
 .'
 It is, therefore, worth examining how relevant
 is the Soviet pattern-a pattern which operates
 so powerfully on Peking's rulers-to Commu-
 nist China.
 In China, 1952 marked the virtual completion
 of  the  postwar  rehabilitation  process,  and,
 roughly, the attainment of pre-Communist peak
 levels of output. In the Soviet Union, 1928
 marked the reattainment of, roughly, 1913 out-
 put levels. In 1929 and 1953, respectively, the
 Soviet and Chinese Communist first five-year
 plans were launched.
 The following key differences between Com-
 munist China in 1952 and the Soviet Union in
 1928 must be noted, however.
 1.  By the end of the 1920's the Soviet Union
 had already passed through the great popu-
 lation increase that results from the applica-
 tion of basic modern public health measures.
 Communist China is still in an early stage of
 jr>
 Internal Crisis?
 Although it is plain that there will be con-
 tinning and probably increasing strain between
 the regime's doctrines and ambitions on the one
 hand and its human and material resources on
 the other, it would be foolhardy to forecast a
 major crisis. All that we can see now is that,
 given a convergence of certain conditions, such
 a crisis is- possible. It may be useful, therefore,
 to outline very briefly an extreme case.
 The regime is committed to a policy of agri-
 cultural mobilization sufficient to cover a set of
 key requirements: minimum peasant consump-
 tion, urban needs, projects demanding mass use
 of labor, military and all official needs, and
 exports.
 The regime is prepared, up to a point, to
 regard the food supply left to the peasant as
 residual; that is, it is prepared to balance its
 books, as in 1953-1954, with starvation on a
 considerable scale-but well short of major
 crisis.
 Nevertheless, a rising population in the face
 of an agricultural output either static or de-
 creased by unfavorable peasant response or nat-
 ural disaster1 would immediately raise serious
 questions.
 To what extent should rural starvation be
 accepted in lieu of reduced allocations to other
 categories? How much starvation over what
 period would crack the morale of the cadres
 and the peasant-born Army? At what stage
 would a cutback in foreign trade and invest-
 ment be accepted in place of starvation?
 And, in the extreme, what would happen if
 a population increase and accelerated urbaniza-
 tion should so silt up the Chinese economy that
 the regime would be confronted with the choice
 of unacceptable levels of starvation or a virtual
 abandonment of its further development plans?
 These are questions of quantity and degree;
 and it should be strongly emphasised that an
 extreme crisis which would pose them all can-
 not be forecast on present evidence. Such a
 definitive crisis could come about only as the
 result of a process lasting for several years, not
 as the consequence of a single poor harvest
 season.
 ventional military units, rather than guerrilla
 operations. They will be more expert in staff
 work, logistics, and the handling of modern
 equipment than  Chu  Teh and his  colleagues
 wno now run the Chinese Communist armed
 forces.
 The politicians will be experts at the bureau-
 cratic manipulation of organized instruments of
 power, administrators rather than experts in the
 politics of insurrection.
 If present modes of education and criteria
 for promotion persist, the new generation will
 be heavily laced with engineers, industrial man-
 agers, and planners. In short, we can expect,
 slowly or suddenly, a transition in Communist
 China similar to that engineered by Stalin in
 the Soviet Union in the 1930's. It is still a
 decade, however, before this new generation
 emerges and bids for (or inherits peacefully)
 the posts of command.
 China and Free Asia
 Peking is not merely cligaged in a struggle
 with its own basic problems, its people, and
 its culture; it is in a competitive race with
 a. me evolution
 in China will be profoundly affected by the
 course of events in free Asia; and the full suc-
 cess of the Chinese Communist regime depends
 in part on what happens over the next decisive
 years in free Asia.
 The Chinese Communists came to power es-
 sentially because the only alternative regime
 available was weak in the field, ineffective in
 administration, and, to many, unattractive. In a
 larger sense the meaning of what Communist
 China accomplishes or fails to accomplish will be
 measured against the strength and attractive-
 ness of free Asia's performance.
 In the short run, however, military success can
 be an effective political substitute for domestic
 performance. Regimes which are achieving inter-
 national success seldom break up in their period
 of expansion. Free-world military weakness in
 Asia could thus strengthen the prestige and
 power of the Peking regime within China and
 cushion the consequences of a mediocre domesUC_
 performance.
 '
 Direct military aggression by the Chinese
 Communist regime is not to be ruled out.
 Nevertheless, it appears evident that the regime
 wishes to avoid a major war, and that it in-
 tends to pursue its ambitions for expansion in
 Asia by a mixture of political aggression with
 limited military actions which minimize the
 risks of major war and which cost little in
 resources.
 We can count on a determined effort to com-
 plete the conquest of Indochina. Incipient opera-
 tions in this style may be in the making, directed
 against Thailand, certain northern provinces of
 India, Burma, and, perhaps, Indonesia.
 The Chinese Communists hope to link such
 direct pressures on the Asian states to more con-
 ventional political efforts to pose as the leading
 power of Asia and as the repository of the
 correct line of approach to Asia's great problems
 of overpopulation and agrarian poverty.
 The effectiveness of such a program of quasi-
 military erosion and political posturing obviously
 hinges on the military and political performance
 of free Asia.
 If Japan is left to wallow along from year to
 year in the trough of a chronic balance-of-pay-
 ments crisis; if the Philippines fail to make good
 in concrete results the social and economic
 promise of Magsa.ysay's political suceesc iL.3ede-
 nesia remains indolent and distracted in the
 face of its growing population problem; if India
 fails to.produce major results from its effort at a
 democratically engineered rural revolution; if
 Formosa fails to develop both as a creative ele-
 ment in free Asia and a political rallying point
 for a new China-if, in short, free Asia does
 not substantially improve its performance, an in-
 different outcome on mainland China would still
 represent an important relative achievement both
 to the Chinese and to Asians generally.

 3.  In 1928, real income per capita in the
 Soviet Union was about four times as high as
 in 1952 Communist China.
 4.  In 1952 Communist China allocated about
 four times as much to the armed forces as the
 Soviet Union did in 1928.
 5.  Pig-iron and steel output in 1952 Corn-
 munist China was roughly comparable to that
 of Russia in the 1890's. The first five-year plan,
 if successful, will expand this industrial base
 roughly to the 1913-1928 Soviet level.
 6.  Largely because of the initial inadequacy
 of its industrial base, Peking must count on an
 enlarged level of foreign trade in its first five-
 year plan, while the Soviet Union could achieve
 its goals despite a sharp decline in external
 trade.

 Chinese scene:
 1.  A sharp fall in the death rate.
 2.  A disproportionate rise in the urban pop-
 ulation.       ----- --

 peasantry to the regime's agricultural policy,
 yielding static or declining output.
 4.  A relative neglect of agricultural in favor
 of industrial investment.
 5.  A succession of bad harvest years.
 Roughly -speaking, it could be said that the
 fulfillment of Peking's current objectives re-
 quires something like a 10 per cent increase in
 agricultural output over the 1952 level by, say,
 1957 to 1959; and that a 10 per cent fall in out-
 put from the 1952 level, if it persisted for several
 years, could generate a decisive crisis.
 Such a crisis would notbe merely a domestic
 affair. Its existence would constitute a demon-
 stration that the Soviet mo~1el is inappropriate
 to the Chinese (and Asian) scene; and that the
 network of ties to the Soviet Union failed to
 carry China over the hump into sustained in-
 dustrial growth. '
 In such an extreme setting, the leadership
 might well split and Peking's international
 orientation as well as its domestic policy come
 anus
 quent conflict.
 Thus, while emphasizing the fact that a de-
 cisive crisis on the mainland cannot be firmly
 forecast, it can be said with confidence that one
 critical test of theregime over the next several
 years will lie in its ability to move. toward its
 announced goals in the face of China's funda-
 mental problems of overpopulation and low
 agricultural productivity, by techniques which
 violate the peasant's incentive to produce.
 Changes at Top
 What changes can be expected to take place
 in the top leadership of the Communist regime
 over the next decade should crisis or major war
 be avoided?
 At the moment, the top leadership represents
 a continuity stretching back to the earliest days
 of Chinese communism, This homogeneous group
 of individuals, now mainly in their 50's, will
 continue to control the Chinese Communist re-
 gime over, say, the next decade whether or not
 Mao Tse-tung himself survives, and to remain
 unified and fairly impervious to change until
 the 1960's.
 The passing of Mao Tse-tung, who is now in
 his early 60's, would undoubtedly remove the
 most powerful, most unifying personal force.
 But the regime has already begun to lay the
 foundations for collective leadership in public.
 doctrine and, quite possibly, in administrative
 practice.
 i   I   i
 As we look ahead, however, the inevitable
 process of wholesale replacement, whether grad-
 ually prepared for or occurring over a rela-
 tively short period, could have significant mean-
 ing. The older leaders like Chu Teh, Lin Tsu.
 han, and Tung Pi-wu, who now lend great
 prestige to the regime and still exert influence
 on policy, will presumably have passed from
 the scene or will be without real power.
 The same holds true for the famous military
 veterans, the very core of Mao's strength and
 of the unique Chinese Communist administra-
 tive system, all but, possibly, Lin Piao, who is
 only 46-and Lin is thought by some to be.
 already seriously incapacitated.
 By 1965 the elders may well be Chou En-lal,

 T4h-hu atotTbl~r-cWRn. There is only one
 full-scale military man here-,-Feng T'eh-huai.
 There is a sizable group of Communist Party
 veterans in their 40's; and there have appeared
 in recent years important new leaders, like An
 Tzu-wen, Lai Jo-yu, and Hu Yao-pang, who
 seem to be without any known history of dis-
 tinction in the Chinese Communist movement
 and to have moved suddenly from the regional
 periphery to the power center. Here is the ma-
 terial of future leadersbi$--a mixture of what
 we might call second-generation veterans whom
 we recognize at least in part and of newcom-
 ers just beginning to show.

 Conc'nsions
 Looking ahead, the Peking regime's continued
 stability can be'satd                         on the
 following four interconnected factors:
 1.  The policy and performance of Soviet Rus-
 sia. Moscow must continue to deny itself direct
 intervention in Peking's internal-control system,
 and Moscow must avoid an internal Soviet crisis
 that would gravely weaken Soviet strength on
 the world scene. A weak Soviet Union would
 force a reappraisal by Peking of the lean-to-one-
 side policy, as would an attempt to extend Soviet
 strength   into   Peking's   domestic   power
 machinery.
 2.  Competition with free Asia. Peking must
 persuasively maintain its posture- as Asia's wave
 of the future, both in terms of military strength
 and, especially, as possessor of the "correct"
 formgla for the solution of Asia's problems.-
 Peking's ability to do this lies largely in the
 hands of the free world: in free-world actions
 and policies, and in the image the free-wort
 impresses on the thinking of Asia's citizens.
 3.  The  economic  problem.  Peking  must
 achieve  industrialization,  without excessive
 starvation, in the face of China's underlying
 between measures to increase agricultural ou
 put and the human response of the peasant
 to collectivization-with the harvests an
 portant random variable.           -
 4.  Top leadership unity. Unity and continui
 must be maintained in the top leadership of
 regime, a problem which is likely to hinge
 the foreseeable future more on the success
 Peking's substantive internal and external pof
 ties and the leadership's continued agreeme
 on them, than on personal or bureaucratic stru
 gles for power within Peking's control structur .
 1?-
 All this is said on the assumption that maj
 war will not come. The question arises: Is Pekin
 likely to launch a major war-for example, b
 pouring its ground forces south into Burm ,
 Thailand, Malaya, and Indonesia, taking the ris
 that would be involved, as the Japanese did
 1941?   .  -
 For the moment such premeditated milita
 aggression seems unlikely. Peking's leaders ha
 a strong sense of history. They see - China in
 tactically strong position, but without the str
 tegic underpinnings for  independent majo
 power status. For the moment their main p
 pose is to concentrate on the establishment
 the  industrial  and military foundations f
 major-power status. They are not in the ni
 for reckless military adventure which wou
 risk their hard-won base of power in China.
 But it cannot be too strongly emphasized t
 the determination of the cost of military adve
 ture to Peking is a matter of the free world
 strength, unity, and will. Communism is never
 self-containing phenomenon.
 What are likely to be Peking's intentions '
 the face of limited unstable conflicts?
 Peking is likely to press its interests coolly
