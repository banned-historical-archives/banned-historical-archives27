 FOREWORD
 This memorandum outlines generally the level of economic activity
 in the territories of Indochina placed under Viet Minh control by the
 Geneva Conference.  Estimates are made of the extent of agricultural
 self-sufficiency and of the level of activity of industry,, principally
 of mining, textiles, cement, and transportation.  The trading structure
 of the North Vietnam area is outlined as it functioned before and
 during the recent hostilities.  The probable benefits to the Soviet
 Bloc of the inclusion of the Viet Minh area within the Bloc are
 discussed.  A comparison is drawn between the prospects for develop-
 ment of North and South Vietnam into self-sustaining economic entities.
 An estimate of probable economic developments through 1957 is made.

 ESTIMATED ECONOMIC GAINS TO THE SOVIET BLOC
 IN NORTH VIETNAM*
 Summary and Conclusions
 The partitioning of Vietnam, decided upon at the Geneva Conference
 21 July 1954, has split a natural economic entity into two parts.  The
 area now to be controlled by the Viet Minh has relatively greater
 potentialities for developing a viable partially industrialized econo-
 my, because it is richer in coal and mineral resources; already pos-
 sesses cement, textile, and food-processing industrial installations;
 and, in addition, has fair possibilities of establishing self-suf-
 ficiency in food production.  South Vietnam, on the other hand, is an
 almost exclusively agricultural economy, with an exportable rice surplus
 and rubber plantations producing for export, but with very little in
 the way of mineral resources and with few industrial facilities of
 consequence except rice mills, rubber factories, distilleries, and
 shipyards.
 Reports of the 1954 "5th month"** rice crop in North Vietnam,
 which may have been as low as 50 percent of normal, indicate that
 there may be the worst famine in this area since 1945.  The conse-
 quent reduction of at least 25 percent of the total 2.4 million
 tons*** of rice produced from the two annual rice crops in 1953 would
 reduce per capita availability from indigenous production to about
 97 kilograms.****  Since domestic requirements are estimated at 200
 to 250 kilograms per person per year, North Vietnam must either
 The estimates and conclusions contained in this memorandum repre-
 sent the best judgment of the responsible analyst as of 15 September
 1954.  This memorandum does not include any estimate of possible gains
 to the Viet Minh from their acquisitions from North Vietnam residents
 and institutions of holdings of old French-issued Indochinese piaster
 currency.
 **  The 5th month crop, harvested in May, is the first crop of the
 year.
 Tonnages throughout this report are given in metric tons.
 **  Crop production figures are in terms of paddy rice,, whereas
 consumption is in terms of milled rice (which represents a 75--percent
 extraction rate).

 500,000 tons of rice from other areas, includ].ng Communist China,
 which is not ir, a position to supply such an amount readily.  North
 Vietnam normally obtains grain from South Vietnam and has only

 and methods of distribution.
 North Vietr.am has the essential resources]for small-scale indus-

 and cement.  It contains most of the known mineral resources of
 Indochina, but except for coal these had not teen developed. to sig-
 nificant proportions for purposes of industrialization under the
 French.
 Generally, the inclusion of the Viet Minh areas into the Soviet
 Bloc will not mean the addition of any v-"-tally important natural
 resources of w1.ich the Bloc does not already control adequate sup-
 plies.  Any sut stantial production from North Vietnam',s mineral
 resources other than coal can'be made available to the Bloc only
 at the cost of considerable investment in trafnsportation, mining,
 and processing facilities.
 Communist China will receive more benefit from the inclusion of
 the area in the Soviet Bloc since important additional supplies of
 cement and coal, will become available to it, as well as a convenient
 railroad route for facilitating exploitation, of Southwest China's
 tin and copper resources and for importing egIuipment for further
 development of that area.  The two railroad links with South China,
 when restored, will assist North Vietnam's development and facilitate
 possible future transport of military supplie's from the Bloc.
 North Vietnam's proved iron reserves are ;estimated at only 5.7
 million tons, End iron mining was developed  'ainly for the purpose
 of export of iron ore to Japan.  Only small   ounts were processed
 into iron and .feel products, in local nativE furnaces, the cement
 plant, and the Bac Son iron and steel plant.: Unless further geo-
 logical surveys prove otherwise, North V:Letnn will not have the
 indigenous resources for an adequate iron and steel industry.

 Production of ferroalloy metals, notably manganese, tungsten,
 and chrome, from the important deposits of North Vietnam has
 virtually ceased since World War II.  Under  table conditions it

 is possible that as much as 10,000 tons eacn in metal content of
 marketable manganese and chrome and 700 tons of tungsten ore may
 be produced per year by 1957 for export to the Soviet Bloc.  These
 are relatively unimportant, however, in comparison with reserves
 and production in the Bloc.  Manganese and chrome may be of future
 importance to the Bloc for bartering purposes, or when Communist
 China's requirements exceed exploitation of its own deposits.  Of
 the nonferrous minerals, North Vietnam has reserves of zinc,
 bauxite, and tin which would be of little significance in the Bloc
 supply position but perhaps would be of some use in improving
 North Vietnam's trade position.  The zinc smelter at Quang Yen,
 if restored, would be of possible benefit to Communist China, which
 has inadequate facilities for the conversion of zinc ore to metal.
 Possibly 8,000 tons of zinc metal and 1,250 tons of tin metal in
 concentrates may be produced per year by 1957.
 The phosphate industry in North Vietnam will be of great value
 to the Viet Minh in its future progtam to increase food production,
 particularly in view of the fact that there is a phosphate fer-
 tilizer factory in Haiphong.  North Vietnam is not self-sufficient
 in salt, and, pending expansion of the existing salt field, the
 large population probably will require imports.
 The estimated reserves of coal in North Vietnam are 20 billion
 tons.  The local Indochina market has been comparatively limited,
 and coal. has been an important export,. especially to Japan.  The
 accretion of the Indochina coal mines and reserves to the Soviet
 Bloc adds to Soviet resources a significant volume of high-grade
 anthracite coal (with lesser amounts of bituminous and lignite),
 which is particularly well located for transportation by water to
 China and other Asiatic countries and well adapted to supplement
 and complement the coal presently being mined in China.
 The acquisition by the Viet Minh regime (in May 1955) of the
 Haiphong Cement Plant, the largest cement producer in Southeast
 Asia, with an installed annual capacity of 400,000 tons, will
 provide a relatively significant source of supply to Communist
 China, whose requirements for cement for immediate construction
 purposes are substantial.
 The centers of the electric power industry in North Vietnam
 are at Hanoi and Haiphong and total 41,000 kilowatts (kw), or
 three-fourths of the total North Vietnam capacity of 55,000 kw.
 Indications, however, are that the electric power facilities have

 not recently been utilized at nearly their optimum capacity and that a
 significant portion of the supply has been for li~hting and electric fans.
 Although a considerable hydroelectric potential ecists, a total capacity
 of less than 1,000 kw is currently installed at 1, zinc mine and 2 tin
 mines.  The installation of other than the snallest units in the im-
 mediate future is tnlikely, because of the costs band time involved.
 Most of the baEic needs of the population of North Vietnam, as re-
 gards consumer goods, are met through the efforts; of local artisans, al-
 though the two cotton mills of Indochina, produci#g cotton fabrics, yarn,
 and cotton blanket?;, are located in North Vietna*.  Raw cotton supplies
 have been obtained entirely from imports, recentlyy from the US?
 North Vietnam contains no industrial iroiuction facilities which
 can be considered Important or significant to the machine-building
 production of the soviet Bloc as a whole.  Although the area is well
 endowed with both naterial and human resources fcr greater industrial-
 ization, the machine-building industries are still in the planning or
 rudimentary stages.
 The weapons and ammunition industry of North4Vietnam is very limi-
 ted, production te3hniques having been largely improvised.  It is evi-
 dent that total production has met only a fraction of past Viet Minh
 needs.
 North Vietnam possesses the base of a well-developed transporta-
 tion system involving railroads, highways, End w .ter, which should be
 adequate for any immediate exploitation of the resources now under its
 control.  Rehabilitation of the area's railroad system, particularly to
 Communist China and also to the Soviet Bloc, will be expedient both
 strategically and economically.  The chief requirements for these pur-
 poses will be railroad construction equipment and rolling stock, and
 the relatively small amounts needed are within tie capability of Com-
 munist China and the USSR to supply.  By connecting the Chinese rail-
 road system to th?t of North Vietnam north of Lang Son, the Bloc will
 establish through rail service from the USSR through Communist China
 to the Southeast Jsian Communist frontier.  The restoration of the
 Raiphong-Lao Kay line to Yunnan Province in Southwest China will prob-
 ably receive high priority as a means of further developing and ex-
 ploiting the tin and copper resources of Yu:anan Province in Communist
 China.

 Vietnam, and intercity wire-line facilities are almost nonexistent
 today.  In order to restore the existing facilities so that they
 can meet the immediate requirements of the Viet Minh regime, the
 regime will have to obtain from the Soviet Bloc trained manpower,
 communications and electric power equipment, some heavy machinery
 items, and raw and finished materials.
 The total population of North Vietnam in 1954 is estimated to
 be about 14 million, or about 56 percent of the population of all
 Vietnam.  Nearly 70 percent of the population reside in the Red
 River delta or coastal areas, which make up only about a quarter
 of the land area of North Vietnam.  About 90 percent of the popula-
 tion is dependent on agriculture for a livelihood, but many of those
 persons working in the mines or industrial installations are part
 of an agricultural population, appearing to work in the plants only
 to supplement their agricultural income.  Most of the industrial
 labor force is semiskilled or unskilled.     With only meager facili-
 ties for the training of skilled workers, the. withdrawal of French
 technicians will create for North Vietnam the problem of a severe
 shortage of skilled and managerial personnel.
 The economic organization of the Viet Minh regime is typical
 of that of a Communist state, and the policy of the regime in
 genera]. appears to follow closely the lines of Mao Tse-tung's
 procedure in China in applying the principles of Marxism-Leninism
 to domestic conditions.  North Vietnam may be expected to emulate
 Communist China's example of the last several years in the imple-'
 mentation of planned economic development on the Soviet model.
 Technical assistance from Communist China or other Bloc countries
 will be required to accomplish such development.
 North Vietnam has been a deficit area in respect to foreign
 trade.  During the postwar period, 1949 through 1951, North
 Vietnam controlled only 6 percent of the exports and 22 percent
 of the imports of Indochina as a whole.  The pattern of external
 trade no doubt will be oriented toward the Soviet Bloc and will
 follow the typical one of an underdeveloped area dependent on a
 few basic commodities in trade.  Grains, coal, and cement accounted
 for more than three-fourths of the value of exports from North
 Vietnam during 1936 through 1938, while textiles and metal manu-.
 factures represented more than three-fifths of all imports.  The
 Viet Minh has received material aid from Communist China since at
 least early 1950, and it has been fairly well established that
 Chinese Communist personnel have been operating with the Viet Minh.

 Though the Viet Minh Communist policy is not known, the Communists
 may consider this area important enough to encourage some indus
 trialization, requiring the importation of capital goods from the
 Soviet Bloc and increasing, though not, significantly, the drain
 upon Bloc resources.
 Of the two areas of Vietnam, North Vietnam possesses by far the
 greater potential for a viable industrial economy with its well-
 balanced resource base even though it needs technical aid and
 investment funds to develop it, and even though the rice deficit
 probably will render it dependent upon some grain imports to sup-
 port its polulation.
 I.  Introduction.
 The conc.itions for normal production and economic development
 have not existed in North Vietnam since prior to 191+1.  The
 Japanese wartime occupation was followed by Chinese. occupation at
 the end of lrorld War II, and from 19)+6 to the time of the French
 defeat the Exea was the field of a civil war between the Viet Minh
 forces and the French and French-supported Vietnamese government.
 Under French rule in Indochina the development of heavy indus-
 try was not encouraged, mainly because it would compete with
 interests of the homeland.  In the northern area industrial activity
 was limited to the exploitation of the coal resources and deposits
 of some metallic minerals and to the development of agricultural
 and mineral processing plants and a few f4ctories producing con-
 sumer goods for local use.                      These f acilites are located primarily
 ,in the Red River delta area, which the French forces controlled
 during the hostilities, and which has always been the major source
 of agricultural production in North Vietnam.  Since these resources
 were denied to the Viet Minh forces, they had to rely upon Com-
 munist China and the Soviet Bloc for economic and military support
 and on clandestine procurement of grain and medical supplies in
 French-cont:olled areas. Now that the Vi4t Minh, as a result of
 the Geneva agreements, is about to obtain control of the economic
 resources o:' Vietnam north of the 17th Parallel, it is important
 to assess tae economic assets of the area' in the new context

 (a) of the association of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV)
 with the Soviet Bloc, and (b) of the prospective exploitation and
 development of the resources of North Vietnam under Communist
 methods of planning and economic control.  It is also of interest
 to examine the relative prospects of the DRV and of South Vietnam
 in respect to the viability of the two areas as separate entities.
 II.  Productive Resources.
 A.  Agricultural Output in 1953 and Trends since 1946.
 Agriculture, the mainstay of the Indochinese economy, pro-
 vides a livelihood for about 90 percent of the total population of
 the country.  Rice is the principal crop as well as the main staple
 of diet and the chief export.  North Vietnam currently does not
 produce enough rice to support its estimated population of 14 mil-
 lion, while the southern part of Vietnam produces a surplus for
 export.  Historically the North has always depended upon the South
 to make up its deficit, particularly in times of drought.  In 3-953
 the estimated per capita production of milled rice in North Vietnam
 was 126.2 kilograms (kg)* while on the basis of the 1953-54 esti-
 mated crop, the per capita production for South Vietnam alone was
 approximately 255.3 kg- !/**  The yearly rice requirements have
 been estimated to be between 200 and 250 kg per capita. D'  Because
 rice production in the North is not sufficient to support the esti-
 mated population of 14 million, a poor harvest -- such as not in-
 frequently occurs in the Red River delta -- would further aggravate
 the situation and would necessitate the importation of even greater
 quantities of rice.  This rice could be made available in the course
 of normal trade with South Vietnam or otherwise from Communist China
 at the expense of the latter's own consumption.  As a matter of fact,
 the entire area of North Vietnam underwent a dry winter in 1953-54,
 and the majority of the spring crops appear to have been severely
 damaged. J  There are prospects that the "5th month" crop of rice
 may be as low as 50 percent of normal, which would mean the worst
 crop since the famine year of.1945. !/  According to information
 currently available this would mean a reduction of at least 25 per-
 cent of the total normal crop (there are two rice crops) or an
 approximate estimated production of 1,810,000 tons of rice for :L954,
 or a per capita production of approximately 97 kg.

 The observed eating habits of the northern Vietnamese cast
 considerable light on their varying standards of living from season
 to season and :,tear to year.     Prior to the man harvests, when the
 rice supply from the previous crop is exhausted and the new harvest
 has not yet come in, there appears to be recurring death and famine.
 In general, the Tonkin peasant eats only 2 meals per day, and only
 in times when the workload is heavy does he  at 3 substantial meals 'Uiy
 a c   .  When food runs short and little work has to be performed,
 he attempts to adapt himself by eating curly once a day, sleeping
 long hours, and reducing as much as possiblelhis expenditure of
 energy.  He eats, if not to satisfaction, atjleast enough to keep
 fit when work requires during certain times of the year.  When
 there is scarcity, he consumes anything he can find which is edible,
 which besides normal kinds of food includes %rorms, water insects,
 locusts, flies, ant eggs, snails, herbs, and other forest products.
 Undernourishment is common in the area, and localized famines occur
 frequently.
 Thus the average food supply position of North Vietnam is
 relatively di,.-,advantageous compared vita that of South Vietnam.
 It is believed, however, that rice production may be increased
 somewhat in North Vietnam within a year or.1wo, if peace is main-
 tained and if intensive irrigation, other agricultural improve-
 ment programs, and conversion of other lands to rice are under-
 taken by the 'Tiet Minh regime.  Increased production and con-
 trolled distrLbution of chemical fertilizers (utilizing phosphate
 from the mines near Lang Son and Lao Kay) would, for example, help
 to boost production.  North Vietnam, however, has a lower potential
 for increased rice production than South Vietnam.
 Other major food crops produced. in North Vietnam Include
 corn, sugar, sweet potatoes, and manioc:.  Table 1* shows 'the pro-
 duction of the principal agricultural c:ommod.ities for the years
 19:37-41 and 19+6-53. It will be noted that:, rice and sugar pro-
 duction have increased slightly over the years, while corn pro-64 000
 duction has decreased drastically from 225 ,00 tons in 1937
 tons in 1953.  The cultivation of corn was  romoted by the French
 to satisfy fodder requirements of metropolitan France, and over
 80 percent of' the total Indochina prewar crop was exported. J
 It may well die that the acreage devoted to the production of this

 commodity may be converted to some other food crop which would be
 more acceptable to the indigenous population and would supplement
 the main diet of rice.  Kidney beans and soybeans, as possible
 alternative crops, are reported to be even now the most important
 'source of protein in the Indochinese diet after rice and fish. 10
 In any case, it is evident that the low average food balance of
 North Vietnam based on indigenous production need not be regarded
 as an irremediable condition.
 Other agricultural commodities produced in North Vietnam
 include peanuts and peanut oil, sesame seed and oil, soybeans,
 tea, cottonseed oil, castor beans and oil, tobacco, and raw
 cotton.  Peanut production, which reached an estimated peak of
 9,696 tons 11  in 1940, dropped to 4,927 tons 12  in 1953.  Tobacco
 production dropped from an estimated 4,162 tons in 1939 to

 that total estimated production of meat in North Vietnam in 1951
 was one-fifth of 1935-39 average production.  Footnote a of Table 3
 also shows the considerable drop in the fish catch.  Unless
 general fishing conditions have changed radically, the reported
 60,000-ton salt water fish catch for 1930 in the Gulf of Tonkin and
 Northern Annam, together with the potential for increased raising
 of fresh water fish in ponds, may serve as sofne indication of the
 program which may be resorted to by the Viet Minh regime to increase
 this important source of food for the Indochinese diet.

 a.  The data on fish catch in Indochina and
 North Vietnam are extremely sparse. It has
 been reported that 60,000 tons of salt water
 fish was the catch for the Gulf of Tonkin and
 Northern Annam and it was estimated that the
 salt and fresh water catch for Vietnam in 19)+0
 was 180,000 tons. L 9J     1953 the Embassy
 estimated that this catch had been reduced to
 30,000 tons.
 Table 4* shows the principal items in the estimated production
 of food per capita in North Vietnam in 1953. It will be observed that
 these figures are based on production only and do not allow for ex-
 ports, imports, stocks, and nonfood uses.  As a partial picture of
 food resources per capita in North Vietnam, Table )+ suggests that on

 As of 1951, the total well-established iron ore reserves

 deposits which have been economically significant in the past are
 all located north of the 17th Parallel, primarily in the Thai Nguyen
 area (210351 N - 105057' E).  The ores of this deposit are of high
 grade, containing from 55 to 66 percent iron, but are rather limited
 in quantity.  Iron mining in Indochina after 1936 was developed
 largely for the export of iron ore to Japan.  In fact, aside from
 small quantities consumed by local cement plants, native furnaces,
 and the Bac Son iron and steel plant, Japan has been the chief his-
 torical consumer.  Table 5 illustrates the relatively small produc-
 tion of iron ore in Indochina. 22

 Indochina's iron ore resources to Communist China and/or to the Soviet
 Bloc is questionable.*  Unless further geological surveys prove other-
 wise, North Vietnam cannot be regarded as a !significant source of
 iron ore for itself or for any of the Bloc countries.
 b,  Iron and Steel.
 Indochina's very small :Lron and steel industry, as
 well as the bEsic raw materials for it, lies' north of the 17th
 Parallel.  Other than negligible native iron furnaces, the only
 known production of pig iron and steel was from a plant at Bac Son
 (21053' N - 106021' E), which was operated in 1942, 1943, and
 1944 by the French Tonkin Coal Mining Company.  Production, at
 this plant varied from 1,100 tons of pig iron in 1942 to a ,high
 of 2,900 tons of pig iron and 600 tons of st a eel in 1943.
 A 1948 survey made by a French commission for the
 modernization of Indochina indicated the exiptence of a raw material
 base, with the exception of coking coal, sufficient to support an
 iron and steel industry capable of producing 100,000 tons of pig
 iron and 60,000 tons of steel per year. 23   The development of
 minting and transportation facilities would bp necessary, 24 and
 unless the prcblem of using anthracite coal  .nstead of coke in the
 blast furnaces is solved, any future steel i dustry of Communist-
 held Indochina would have to import 125,000 to 400,000 tons of
 coke annually.  The future development of a steel industry of any
 size by the Communists would require coreside'able investment and
 provision of equipment by the USSR and its Satellites.
 c. Ferroalloys.
 AMong its mineral resources, lndochina possesses
 several ferroalloy metals, notably manganese, tungsten, and chrome,
 the important deposits of which are all locoed north of the 17th
 Parallel.    Production of all these minerals  as virtually ceased
 since World War II.  Until such time as a steel industry is de-
 veloped in North Vietnam the importance of these metals will be
 limited to expert purposes.

 (1) Manganese.
 Reserves of manganese ore in Indochina, have been
 estimated at 25,000 tons, but exploitation would require extensive
 field investigation to prove the deposits for further development. 25
 The most important occurrences of the deposits are to be found in
 Vinh (Nghe An)-Ha Tinh (18?40' N - lob?oo' E.  Production. of man-
 ganese began in 1935 and reached its peak in 194+4 when 7,700 tons
 were produced. 26   Under stable conditions at least 10,000 tons of
 marketable ore could probably be extracted.  Inclusion of Indo-
 chinese manganese reserves into the Bloc total is relatively un-
 important because of the large reserves already controlled by the
 Bloc.*
 (2) Chrome.
 Measured and inferred chromite reserves of the
 Co Dinh deposit near the village of Nong Cong (20000' N - 105?30' E),
 in Thanh Hoa Province, are estimated at 1.7 million to 2 million
 tons.of?recoverable metal. 27   In 1939, this mine produced 2,000
 tons.  During the Japanese occupation, production rose to 12,400 tons
 of 45-percent concentrates for 1943-44+ inclusive. 28   In general,
 North Vietnam may have the potential to produce 5.0,000 tons of
 chromite concentration annually. 29  Chromium ore reserves may be
 of future importance to Communist China when its requirements exceed
 exploitation of its own minor deposits.* 30
 (3) Tungsten.
 Known tungsten ore reserves in Indochina are
 quite small, the only deposits of commercial quality being located
 in the immediate area surrounding Tinh Tuc (22039' N - 105?51' E).
 Production of tungsten concentrates is shown in-Table 6.**
 There are several reports indicating that the
 Viet Minh with Chinese Communist aid have been operating these
 mines. 31   In view of Communist China's large reserves of tungsten,
 inclusion of the limited Indochinese tungsten reserves within the
 Soviet Bloc appears to be of negligible significance to Communist
 China or the Bloc.*

 2.  Nonferrous Minerals.
 The greatest period of production for nonferrous metals
 in Indochina occurred just before and during the period of Japanese
 occupation.  Most of the deposits of these metals are located in or
 near Viet M_nh-controlled territory, and consequently there has
 been no known production since 1946.
 Zinc, the deposits of which are located in North
 Vietnam, is the only major nonferrous metal produced in Indochina
 which has occupied a position of importance in the economy of the
 country.  A smelter built; in Quang Yen near Haiphong, in 1924)
 with a capacity of 6,000 metric tons of metallic zinc, was reported
 to have been destroyed or severely danage4 by bombing in 1943. 33
 Table 7* gi-ires the production of zinc in  ndochina in terms of
 metal content and smelter output.
 The acquisition of Indochijna's zinc industry by the
 Viet Minh would be of possible benefit to Communist China, particu-
 larly if the smelter at Quang Yen were restored.  Because facilities
 in China are inadequate for the conversion of zinc ore to metal,
 China imports zinc metal from Poland.  Asi de from this, the

 a.  Tin concentrates (tin content).
 For the period from 1933 to 1940, the average annual
 output of tin was 1,384 tons.  Based upon scattered reports of in
 dividual mines, it is estimated that 40 to 59 percent of the total
 production was achieved in North Vietnam and 50 to 60 percent in
 Laos.  Using 45 percent as an average figure!, the output of Tonkin
 for the 1933-40 period would be 620 tons of contained tin per year.
 On the basis cf limited reserves and past production records, a

 S-E-C-R-E-T
 maximum output of 1,000 to 1,500 tons of contained tin in concen-
 trates is anticipated for North Vietnam.  In view of the large
 Chinese tin reserves and rapidly growing Chinese output, together
 with the expected reconstruction Of the railroad from Haiphong to
 Kunming, the significance of the Vietnam tin potential is compara-
 tively unimportant.*
 d.  Phosphates.
 Most of Indochina's major phosphate deposits are
 located above the 17th Parallel.  The most important of these is
 at Lao Kay, near the Chinese border.  Estimates of reserves range
 from 10 million tons of 40-percent phosphate and 40 million tons
 of varying grades to.100 to 200 million tons of all grades.  The
 Japanese raised production at Lao Kay to 120,000 tons in 1942.
 Other less important deposits are found in Lang Son and Thanh Hoa
 Provinces. 39    Table 10 gives the production of phosphate in
 Indochina.

 Phosphates represent an important source of fertilizer,
 which will be of considerable use to the Viet Minh in increasing food
 production.  As early as May 1952 the Chinese Communists reportedly
 had 10,000 miners extracting the phosphate ores at the Cam Duong mine
 near Lao Kay. 41   The expected reconstruction of the railroad. from
 Haiphong to Lao Kay will greatly stimulate production, particularly
 in view, of the fact that there is a phosphate fertilizer factory in
 Haiphong.*

 Large and small salt works are sattered all along the
 Indochina coast, but North Vietnam in the past h.s produced on the
 average only an estimated one-third of the total salt production of
 Indochina.  For exaunple, of 193,600 tons 42  of Galt produced in 1937
 in the whole of Indochina an estimated 661, 000 tors were produced in
 what is now North Vietnam.  In 1941, because of increased Japanese
 requirements for salt, production rose to 260,000 tons.  This serves
 to illustrate to some degree the existing potential for increased sea
 salt.*  The large :)opulation of North Vietnam wi.l probably require
 imports of salt, pending expansion of the existing salt fields.
 3.  Coal.
 All tha developed coal mines of Indochina are located
 north of the 17th ?arallel, in the vicinity of t e coastal areas of
 Haiphong, Hon Gay, and Cam Pha.  The bulk of production has been
 anthracite coal, most of which is of supericr quality.  The prin-
 cipal area of production has been the Quang Yen lasin (21007' N -
 107027' E), in which the above-named coastal ports are located.
 Before World War II, 44 mines were producing coal in this basin.
 At present, 1 large French company, La Societe FTancaise des C;aarbonnages
 de Tonkin, and 4 o:r 5 smaller companies of diveroified ownership are
 the only active operators.  The major portion of production is from
 open-cut mines of the French company.  Plans had recently been developed
 for an extensive renovation of this company's pr6perties over a 5-year
 period, involving substantial investment and. the introduction of
 modern mining methods and up-to-date mechanized equipment whereby the
 use of manpower and the cost of production c:ould1 be reduced.  About
 US $1.7 million worth of coal mining equipment   s been delivered to
 the Charbonnages du Tonkin-company by the UPI under MSA and FOA
 auspices. 43   It was planned to restore production to approximately
 1 million tons annually,4  depending upon the  .evelopment of mar-
 kets for the increased production.  The local InPchinese market for
 coal has been comparatively limited, and coal has been an important
 export, especially to Japan. 45
 Coal. reserves in Indochina, mostly located in North Vietnam,
 are estimated at 20 billion tons, about equal. in', volume to the estimated
 original reserves of anthracite coal in Pennsylvania.  Approximately

 12 billion tons of these reserves are believed to exist in the Quang
 Yen Basin, of which 390 million tons are in the currently most pro-
 ductive fields within` the basin.  Based on an estimated recovery of
 65 percent, coal from this mine alone would last 200 years at the
 1952 rate of production. L6
 The accretion of the Indochinese coal mines and reserves
 .to the Soviet Bloc adds to its resources a significant volume of
 high-grade anthracite coal (with lesser amounts of bituminous and
 lignite), which is particularly well located for transportation. by
 water to China and other Asiatic countries and well adapted to sup-
 plement and complement the coals presently being mined in China.
 The possibilities of wider trade, both intra-Bloc and with non-
 Bloc countries, are materially enhanced by the Bloc's acquisition
 of these mines and deposits.*
 Table ll** gives the production, imports, exports, and
 consumption of coal (anthracite, bituminous, and lignite combined)
 in Indochina, 1937-41 and 19)+6-53
 4.   Electric Power.'
 Hanoi and Haiphong are the centers of the electric power
 industry in North Vietnam.  Three coal-fired steam plants -- a
 22,500-kilowatt (kw) plant in Hanoi, a 6,300-kw plant in Haiphong,
 and a 12,200-kw plant in the Haiphong Cement Works -- total
 41,000 kw, or three-fourths of the total area capacity of 55,000 kw.
 The Hon Gay Coal Mine Plant with a 4,000-kw installed capacity and
 the Ben Thuy wood products plant with a 3,)+50-kw installed capacity
 are the other two significant plants. 47   These 5 plants thus account
 for nearly 90 percent of the total, with the remainder divided among
 13 diesel, gasoline, and hydro plants.  As a matter of comparison,
 It is interesting to note that the total capacity of all these plants
 is only about two-thirds that of the single smallest unit installed
 in the Potomac Electric Power Company's new Alexandria Station.  In
 the past the Hanoi-Haiphong area was served by over 700 kilometers of
 30-kilovolt transmission lines. 48   Unsettled conditions over the
 past. several years, however, resulted in.destruction of a major
 portion of the system and the installation of small gas and diesel
 generators to serve the many small centers. 49

 Indications are that the electric power facilities have
 not recently been utilized at nearly their optimum capacity and. that
 a significant portion of the supply has been for lighting and electric
 fans.  Although some rather elaborate plans for the development of
 the hydroelectric potential of the area have been advanced., a total
 capacity of less than 1,000 kw is currently installed at 1 zinc and
 2 tin mines.
 It may be presumed that the Viet Minh will assign some
 priority to the restoration of the transmission system so that a
 maximum portion of the demand may be met from coal-fired plants,
 rather than from diesel-driven plants which require imported fuel.
 Such restoration will require the importing of equipment and prob-
 ably will also require some technical assistance from the Soviet
 Bloc.  The supply of power to local industry may be considerably
 increased by scheduling techniques and by limitation of domestic
 use.  Any expansion of electric facilities would be a reflection of
 major expansion of industries.  Although a considerable hydroelec-
 tric potential exists, the installation of other than the smallest
 units in the immediate future is unlikely because of the costs and
 time involved.  Table 12* shows capacity and output of electric
 power in North Vietnam.
 The partition of Indochina has placed the only cement
 plant in the area in the control of the Viet Minh.  The output of
 this plant, located at Haiphong (20052' N - 106041' E), constitutes
 the largest volume of production of any single industry other than
 coal mining in Indochina. 60   The Haiphong plant is the largest
 cement producer in Southeast Asia, with an installed annual capac-
 ity of 400,000 tons.  Allowing for unavoidable plant maintenance,
 an effective annual production of about 300,000 tons could be
 realized. 61   As shown in Table 13,** there has been a marked
 difference between actual production and theoretical installed
 capacity, the best production having been achieved during the
 period 1937-41.  The relatively high output of these years was
 brought about by modernization of the plant and a resultant improve-
 ment in quality which opened more foreign markets.  The location of
 the plant on a waterfront serving deep-draft vessels makes its

 The acquisition of this cement plant by the V:Let Minh regime
 will be relatively significant as a source of supply to Communist
 China, whose requirements for cement are substantial for immediate
 construction purposes.  Thus, Communist China may become the principal
 external consumer of the plant's output, possibly leading to maximum
 exploitation of the plant's capability.*  The 1953 output of the
 plant approximated 10 percent of estimated total Chinese Communist
 cement production of that year.  The expected reconstruction of the
 Haiphong-Kunming Railroad will make cement conveniently available
 to the heretofore relatively isolated region of Southwest China.
 South Vietnam, which in the past used a large portion of the annual
 cement production of Haiphong, may for the time being be forced to
 seek its requirements elsewhere.

 a.  Textiles.
 Two cotton mills, both of whit  are located in North
 Vietnam, account for the major portion of production of machine-made
 cotton textiles in Indochina.  The Societe Cotnniere du Tonkin, at
 Nam Dinh, the scle industrial producer of cotton fabrics in Indo-
 china, also produces yaxn and cotton blankets. 92   The Societe des
 Filte:ries de 1'Indochine, at Haiphong, engages only in the spinning
 of cotton yarn End thread. 93   Industrial pro uction of cotton
 fabrics has in the past amounted to 35 to 40   rcent of the total
 output. 94+   The remainder may be attributed t  artisan weavers,
 approximately 6C percent of whom are located i   North Vietnam. Z5./
 It should be noted that the textile industry iI completely de-
 pendent upon imported raw cotton.  During the i past several years
 the US has supplied this demand.  Altogether,  bout 75 percent of
 the cotton fabric production facilities and al   of the yarn pro-
 duction capacity are north of the demarcation line.  Table 1)+*

 ,ost of the basic needs of the population of North
 Vietnam, as regards consumer goods, are met through the efforts of
 local artisans.     In most instances, the peasants supplement their
 income from agrit3ultural endeavors by artisan activity such as basket
 weaving, grass rope making, and pottery making;  There are, however,
 some villages in which the whole population contributes to the
 fabrication of o:ae type of item, such as baskets or mats. 13;/  Examples
 of small consume:- goods enterprises located in'North Vietnam are a
 candle making plant at Haiphong, 136  porcelain factories at Hanoi
 and W)n Cay,13   soap factories at Hanoi and H iphong, 138  button
 factories at Hanoi and Haiphong, L32/ and bicycle parts shops at
 Hanoi and Haiphong. 1]+0
 7.  Engineering, Munitions, and Shipbuilding Industries.
 a.  General.
 North Vietnam contains no industrial production facili-
 ties which can be considered important or significant to the machine-
 building industr;r of the Soviet Bloc as a whole.  Although the area
 is well endowed 'rith both material and human resources for greater
 industrialization, the machine-building in1ustr'ies are still in plan-
 ning or rudimentary stages.  Colonial policies!in the past have
 generally retarded the development of autonomous industrial facili-
 ties, and the facilities which do exist are primarily repair and
 service shops se-; up by machine-importing companies for the benefit
 of their local c:_ients.  It is estimated that the benefit to the Bloc
 resulting from acquisition of these facilities will be negligible.
 b.  Munitions.
 ]?roduction of weapons and ammunition in North Vietnam
 is very limited, and without foreign imports in the form of semi-
 finished militar;r end items and raw materials,'Viet Minh production
 of weapons and ammunition has been carried on in a number of small
 plants employing usually no more than 50 to 100 workers each.  Such
 plants have been established in out-of-the-way '',forested and mountainous
 areas, have been operated mostly at night, and frequently have been
 moved to avoid bombing. 141Production techniques have been largely
 improvised, and :_t is believed that total production has met only a
 fraction of past Viet Minh needs.  With increa ed supplies of higher
 quality Chinese weapons, many such plants in Viet Minh have concen-
 trated. on repair work and the production of ammunition.

 c.  Shipbuilding.
 North Vietnam has a very limited capability for ship
 construction and repair.  Construction would probably be limited to
 small wooden fishing and river vessels without power propulsion.
 Haiphong is the only point within the area which reportedly possesses
 any kind of facilities.  These yards in the past have built large
 numbers of wooden vessels and have done repair of small ocean and
 coastal vessels. 142
 C.  Transportation and Communications.
 1.  Transportation.
 a.  General.
 The DRV, with the areas gained in the truce agree-
 ment, possesses the base of a well-developed transportation system
 involving railroads, highways, and water* which should be adequate
 for any immediate exploitation of the resources now under its con-
 trol.  The transport network as developed by the French made avail-
 able several transport media parallel to each other.  The focal
 point of all transport is the Hanoi-Haiphong road, rail, and water
 route axis.  Transport, however, from the Tonkin Delta area south
 to the truce demarcation line is not well developed.
 The transport system can be made to serve the needs
 of the area and to develop relations with Communist China and the
 USSR.  The chief requirements for these purposes will be railroad
 construction equipment and rolling stock, and the relatively small
 amounts needed are within the capability of Communist China and
 the USSR to supply.
 b.  Highways.
 The highway complex of North Vietnam focuses on the
 two major cities of Hanoi and Haiphong.  Originally the road system
 was established to satisfy military needs and to extend French
 influence inland from the mouth of the Red River toward China.  Hence,
 from a very dense highway network within the delta region, high--
 ways have been constructed toward the northern limits of the country,
 *  In addition, the Viet Minh now control several airfields to which
 civil air transport could be established.

 linking the delta with the Chinese border at, Ban Leng, Lao Kay,
 Thanh Thuy, Tliuy Cao, Nam Quan, and Mon Cay   In the past these roads,
 because of their military and political use,.' never received the ex-
 tensive improvements which could only have  een justified in terms of
 more intensive economic development.  Since 1950 the Viet Minh and
 the French have placed a major emphasis on improving tactical com-
 munications by reconstructing existing roads and trails, and by
 constructing new roads in order to bypass vtlnerable road stretches
 subject to interdiction.  Conspicuous among these is the road
 built by the Viet Minh connecting Dong Dang,11 on the Chinese border
 opposite P'in?;-hsiang, the Chinese railhead? to Thai Nguyen, where
 the improvements have permitted two-way truck traffic.
 Under peacetime conditions, and with the reconstruc-
 tion of bridges, it is probable that each ofithe roads leading into
 North Vietnam from China will soon have a capacity of 600 to 1,000
 tons each way per day (EWPD).  With the return to peacetime con-
 ditions and the probable reconstruction of railroad facilities,
 however, the greater part of the China-Tonkii traffic will move
 via railroad cr water as was the case prior Ito the outbreak of
 hostilities.  Thus, because of the short; supply of gasoline and the
 heavy consumption thereof on the long-haul supply route from China,
 the truck park built up by tactical expediency will probably be
 used more for ancillary or feeder purposes w4ien through railroad
 service is restored.
 I
 The French originally constr4.cted a simple but ade-
 quate meter-ga3e railroad system in North Vi+tnam consisting of two
 lines crossing at right angles at Hanoi.         Thg line running north-
 south was built within the concept of a trans-Indochinese :^ailroad
 uniting the no:^thein and southern parts of the country.  The line
 running generaLly .east-west, extending up th? Red River valley from
 Haiphong to La) Kay and then Into China to K nming, was built to
 enhance French influence in Southwest China 4nd to exploit the mineral
 resources of Yunnan.
 Just prior to the truce agre4ment, only a few
 sepaxate sectors of this railroad system wer  in operation --
 the vital Hano:_-Haiphong line under French control 143  and some
 segments of the system within the Viet Minh areas.  144/ .Although
 the rails have been removed from all nonoperating sectors of the

 railroad net, the roadbed remains.  In order to facilitate economic
 development and to serve military purposes, it is considered probable
 that the reconstruction of the lines connecting with the Chinese rail
 systems in Kwangsi and Yunnan Provinces will receive the highest
 priority in the allocation of labor and materials on the part of both
 the Chinese Communists and the Viet Minh.  It is estimated that these
 connecting lines could be returned to operating condition within
 the 300 days allowed the French for withdrawal from the delta.
 The Lao Kay-Haiphong line will probably be re-
 established to its prewar condition to facilitate the exploitation
 of the Chinese K'ochiu tin mines and the copper resources in southern
 Yunnan as well as to hasten the development of the mineral resources
 of North Vietnam.  Construction on this line has already been reported
 begun.  This route will probably continue to represent the most ex-
 peditious transport link between Yunnan and the industrial areas of
 China until Kunming is joined by rail to Chungking and the Yangtze
 River.  In 1940 the Haiphong-Yunnan line had a maximum daily capac-
 ity of 3 trains EWPD, with train capacity computed at 250 tons. 145
 If the Haiphong-Lao Kay line is reconstructed over
 its entire length with 30-kilogram-per-meter (kg/m) rail (the weight
 used on. the Chinese` section of the line), it will require about
 34,000 tons of rails. In addition, use of this line into China will
 require the further construction of about 80 kilometers of rail from
 the Chinese border to the present railhead at Pi-tze-chai and
 strengthening of the Lao Kay - Ho-K'ou bridge at the Chinese border
 and other bridges.
 Moreover, the Hanoi-Lang Son-Nam Quan line will prob-
 ably be rebuilt as soon as possible.  This line is not only economically
 but also strategically important, in that a short rail connection
 across the Chinese border would connect the Viet Minh railroad system
 with those of China and the USSR.  In 1940 this line had a maximum
 daily operating capacity of 3 trains EWPD, with train capacity com-
 puted at 140 tons. 146   It is probable that the gage of this rail-
 road will be widened to permit use of standard-gage equipment from
 China.  Such a program may delay full utilization of the line, but, in
 view of the advantage of through transit without transloading and of
 the relatively low capacity of meter gage lines, it is doubtful if
 the Chinese would have doubled the capacity of the Nanning?-
 P'ing -hsiang line 147  without anticipating the need for a like in-
 crease in the capacity of the Viet Minh line.

 If the Hanoi-Nam Quan line is rebuilt at standard gage
 it will require about 15,000 tons of 42-kg/ii rails and a considerable
 amount of bridging equipment.  Constructionicould proceed into North
 Vietnam from the railhead in China.

 will require Chinese
 ng stock, rails, and
 in China but in limited
 ted to be about 150,000
 Minh requirements, and the
 luding eastward and north-
 ward railroad construction from Yunnan) would be expedited by the
 convenient transportation link between Southwest China and coastal
 transport ove:^ the Haiphong-Lao Kay line.  Communist China can also
 alleviate the shortage of railroad repair facilities in North
 Vietnam through the accessibility of the repair shops at Hengyang
 and Ch'uchang (Kukong).
 d.  Water.
 (1) Inland Waterways.
 The inland waterways sy tem in'North Vietnam was
 organized by the French to develop the movement of traffic between
 the, larger cities and at the same time to e tend the irrigation of
 cultivable land.  Over 700 kilometers of waterways are open to
 navigation, iI / although some of this -,otajj may be presently of
 limited use due to silting of channels.  The main waterway system
 is that of the Red River and its basin In the Tonkin delta.
 Normally these waterways are heavily trafficked by sampans and junks,
 and. screw and paddle wheel launches regularly serve Hanoi, Haiphong,
 Nam. Dinh, and the chief provincial towns.  Because of the vast amount
 of small junk traffic on the inland waterwa s, no accurate estimate
 .of activity c?n be made.  There has been, however, no shortage of
 available bottoms to handle local cargo requirements.
 (2) Maritime Shipping.
 The expansion of maritimm traffic and port
 facilities in North Vietnam received considerable stimulation from
 the French, but during the recent hostilitieb much structural main-
 tenance was allowed to lapse with the resultjthat many of the facili-
 ties have beer.. impaired.  Nevertheless, the basic factors contributing

 S-E-C-R-E-T
 to the continuing movement of ocean-going traffic were preserved as
 necessary parts of the logistical supply program of the French forces
 in the area.
 The principal port of North Vietnam, Haiphong, is
 supplemented by secondary ports of either specialized or regional
 character, such as Cam Pha Port, Hon Gay, Port Wallut, Quang Yen,
 Dong Hai, and Ben Thuy.  Although other minor ports are susceptible
 to expansion, the rehabilitation and exploitation of the above-named
 ports should satisfy the major economic needs of the Viet Minh during
 the next 2 years (barring any unexpected military events)?  Except
 for small junks the Viet Minh have no coastal fleet, and probably
 will be dependent on Communist China for coastal shipping bottoms.
 Haiphong, as the major deep-water port; of North
 Vietnam, serves as the gateway for Tonkin.  Because of the agreement
 to allow the French 300 days (that is, until mid-May 1955) to evacuate
 the port, development by the Viet Minh of the Haiphong industrial
 complex and port will necessarily be delayed.  Although the port has
 been allowed to silt up during the past 10 years, the existing port
 facilities would permit a substantial increase in the tonnage now
 handled.  In 1952 the port handled slightly over 1 million metric
 tons of cargo, and it has been estimated that it could handle ap-
 proximately 8,000 tons per 20-hour working day, or about 2.8 mil-
 lion tons per year. 14    The port can berth vessels up to 7,700-
 ton Liberty-type vessels, but has limited repair facilities.  With
 Haiphong opened for trade of the Viet Minh, commerce will probably
 be directed chiefly toward Communist China.  Since the route between
 Haiphong and Canton is less than 1,200 kilometers and for the most
 part sheltered, Chinese Communist coastal-type vessels will be capable
 of handling a considerable traffic flow between the two areas.  Soviet
 Bloc and chartered vessels will be able to serve the European-Viet
 Minh trade to Haiphong as it develops.
 lion Gay was developed solely to export coal from
 nearby mines.  Over 2 million tons of coal were exported annually
 from this port before World War II, 150  and the port has been in
 continuous operation.  Although most of the vessels calling at Hon
 Gay port are of the 4,000- to 5,000-ton variety, it is possible to
 bring in Liberty-type vessels, contingent on high tide and calm
 waters. 151   Facilities at the port permit turn-around of 5,000-ton
 colliers in 24 hours.  Cargo other than coal is handled with con-
 siderable difficulty.

 The rapid communications services of Noith Vietnam have
 deteriorated.marke:dly since the period befo:^e World Wax II.  At that
 time, depending a:most exclusively on foreign equipment and technical
 knowledge, they probably adequately met the needs of the country.
 Combat destruction and widespread sabotage have accounted for much
 of the decline.  .:n consequence, intercity 'wire-1line facilities are
 almost nonexistent; today, with only an esti:Hated. 129 kilometers of
 wire lines and po,;sibly 7 telephone exchanges in operation.  As a
 result, radio com(Lunication is being utilized a4 a minimal alter-
 native. 152   At .)resent there are 20 to 24 radio stations in the
 area, concentrated primarily at Hanoi and Haiphong.  So depleted are
 the permanent civ:Ll communications resources th4.t the contending
 military forces r,.portedly meet their own needs for rapid communica-
 tions without any dependence on civil facilitie$.  It seems likely
 that this situati)n will persist for some time.
 In communications resources, Ncrth Vietnam is a liability
 to the Soviet Bloc.  In order to restore the ex.sting facilities to a
 condition to meet adequately the immediate requirements of the Viet
 Minh regime, the regime will have to obtain. fro i. the Bloc trained
 manpower, communications and electric power equipment, some heavy
 machinery items, and raw and finished materials,.  Expansion of the
 :radio broadcasting base as a chief medium of maps communication for
 control and indoctrination of the "Viet Minhese1' and the propagandiza-
 tion of the peoples of the other Indochina stays and perhaps Thailand
 will be included as one of the first orders ofusiness.

 of all Indochina (30.5 million).  The 195+ population represents an
 increase within the Viet Minh area since 19+3 of about 8 percent,
 compared with an 11-percent increase within all Vietnam, and a,
 14-percent increase within all Indochina.
 Nearly 70 percent of the population of North Vietnam reside in
 the Red River delta or coastal areas.  These areas, however, make
 up only about a quarter of the land area of North Vietnam.  This
 results in many sections within the area having population densities
 of over 1,700 persons per square mile, or as high as any nonurban area
 in the world, as well as having underemployment of the populace.
 An estimate of the total labor force available within the country
 is difficult to calculate.  In the rural population, however, every-
 one works from early youth to old age, and this generalization
 applies only to a slightly lesser extent to the urban population as
 well.  Probably about 8 million persons fall in the 15 to 59 year
 age group, of which over 3.5 million would be males. 15~+   About
 90 percent of the population is dependent on agriculture for a
 livelihood, and probably no more than 1 percent of the total have
 no direct connection with agriculture. 155   Many of those persons
 working in the mines or industrial installations are also a part of
 the agricultural population, as they appear to work in the plants
 only to supplement their agricultural income.
 Skilled labor represents only a small fraction of the labor
 force, and the greater part of the skilled labor force is employed
 in the production of local specialty items such as food products,
 textiles, baskets, or other handicraft products. 156
 Of the modern industrial installationd in North Vietnam, coal and
 other mines, textile plants, and the cement plant employ the greatest
 amount of labor.  Except in the textile industry, most of this labor
 is unskilled or semiskilled.
 There are only meager facilities for the training of skilled
 workers in North Vietnam, and, if French technicians and admini-
 strators withdraw, the factories of North Vietnam will be faced
 with a severe shortage of skilled and managerial personnel.

 IV.  Economic Organization.
 The economic organization of the Viet Minh regime is typical of
 that of a Communist state.  The party directorate is the seat of
 power, and Party members hold the principal ministries and direct
 the mass organizations which propagandize and implement decisions
 of the central boaly.  Some ardent nationalists   ve been utilized
 by the Party in ministerial positions but only    n close association
 with Party member3 as deputy ministers.  Six mi istries, all of
 whose ministers or deputy ministers are Party, m mbers, deal par-
 ticularly with matters of economic policy and c ntrol:  the Ministries
 of Finance, Commerce and Industry, Agriculture, Labor, Public Works,
 and Information.  In general, the policy of thelregime appears to
 follow closely th= lines of Mao Tse-tung's proc duce in China in
 applying the principles of Marxism-Leninism. to conditions in Vietnam.
 The Land Reform Law, which was promulgated by the National
 Assembly of the DRV on 4 December 1953, has bee   heavily propagandized
 in order to gain popular support.  It provides   enerally for confisca-
 tion and expropriation of the lands of large 1                downers, absentee land-
 :Lords, and members of the opposition ("reaction  ies"), and for re-
 distribution of the land to landless peasants o        small landholders. 157
 The law is similar in many respects to the law opted by the Chinese
 Communists in June 1950, and, as in Communist China, it appears to have
 the twofold immediate purpose of popularizing the regime on a broad
 base and of eliminating the opposition of the g ntry as an effective
 force.
 During the last 3 years, the influence of C
 advisors has been pronounced in the inauguratio
 currency reforms.  In early 1951 a small bond i
 than planned) was floated with value, in terms
 for 5 years.  In 1951 the budget was formulated

 ces were to be paid
 in Ho Chi Minh piasters at the market price of paddy on the day of
 payment.  In 1952, collection of taxes and cont of of expenditures
 were centralized in the hands of the Ho Chi Mina government.  No
 local government expenditures were allowed unless previously autho-
 rized by the central government.  Local taxes                        re abolished, and
 the people were Eo informed by widespread prop         anda.  A National
 Granary Service, supervised by officials appointed by the central
 government, assumed control of the paddy suppli s collected through
 taxation, thus removing this function from local authority.   In 1952

 a Viet Minh state bank was established with a monopoly on currency
 issue, which had previously been partly in the hands of semi-
 independent regional administrations.                                         In 1952, five principal forms
 of taxation were instituted to replace the previously irregular
 taxes-in-kind, real estate and business taxes, agricultural tax,
 taxes on industry and commerce, commodity taxes, export-import duties,
 and slaughterhouse taxes.  The new agricultural tax was based on
 production instead of on land area, and the yield estimate for -tax
 purposes was said to be stabilized.  Exemptions were allowed for
 family units instead of individual farmers, but the harvest tax was
 to be collected on a graduated scale based on size of land hold-
 ings. 158
 Taxes on industry and commerce under the reform are of three
 types:  turnover taxes, taxes on gross profits, and taxes on partic-
 ular transactions in the case of petty merchants.  Taxes on opium
 and salt amount to one-third of production.  Tea, sugar, tobacco,
 and cigarettes are similarly taxed, but at lower rates.  Slaughter-
 house taxes amount to 10 percent of the value of the processed meat.
 The implementation of the land reform law and of the tax col-
 lection system appears to have been erratic, varying, with the degree
 of control, from mere propaganda to severe enforcement.  The central-
 ization of administration, however, has generally been as absolute
 as the condition of available communications would appear to allow.
 The results are reported to have been generally in the direction of
 a reduced rate of currency and price inflation in the Viet :Minh areas
 and strengthening of control of resources in the hands of the
 regime. 159
 At the DRV government conference held in Tuyen Quang in July 1953,
 Vice President Pham Van Dong of the DRV summarized the policies of
 his government as follows:  (1) more thorough and equitable tax col-
 lections under the centralized tax collection system; (2) the increase
 of trade with other countries as well as with "enemy-controlled areas";
 and (3) the improvement of land and water transportation systems to
 facilitate trade.  He stated that the fact that prices had become
 more stable would aid in the development of economic production and
 that the implementation of the land reform program would increase
 agricultural production.  Since agriculture is the basic element of
 the Vietnamese economy, he said that the working slogan would again
 be:  "Increase agriculture production first, then encourage the
 development of family handicrafts."  Finally he stated that "production

 No economic programs, or even production             oals of the DRV, have
 been announced since the conclusion of t,,  Ge eva agreements.  The
 policies of the regime, however, as so far ex ressed, are clearly
 reminiscent of those which have been so ruthl ssly applied in
 Communist Chine,over the last 4 years.  In vi w of the close similarity
 of fiscal and tax reforms to those in Conmtunipt China and the con-
 tinual presence of Chinese Communist advisors in North Vietnam, the
 pattern of centralization of authority and co trolled economic develop-
 ment may be expected to follow that of the Peiping government, with
 but slight modifications to fit local conditions and resources.

 French trade with North Vietnam, protected by preferential
 customs, was relatively greater than was that area's trade with the
 rest of the world.  Tonkinese and Annamese exports to France, con-
 fined mostly to corn, coal, and metals, represented 52 percent of
 all exports from those provinces during the late 1930's.  Imports
 from France, concentrated in textiles, metal and miscellaneous
 manufactures, and paper products and chemicals, amounted to 53 per-
 cent of total imports in the same period.
 An annual commodity trade deficit marked the prewar period
 of North Vietnam, averaging about US $4 million from 1936 through
 1941.  Cochinchina had an inverse experience during this time,
 with the magnitude of its trade surplus dependent on the quantity
 and price relationships of grains and rubber.
 The pattern of external trade of Tonkin and Annam before
 World War II was typical of an underdeveloped area dependent on a
 few basic commodities.  Grains, coal, and cement accounted for
 more than three-fourths of the value of exports from North Vietnam
 during 1936 through 1938, while textiles and metal manufactures
 represented more than three-fifths of all imports.  Grain, repre-
 senting 47 percent of exports, consisted primarily of corn exports
 (to France), with rice exports (to China) averaging about a third
 of the value of corn exports.  Fuel and cement accounted for 32
 percent of exports.  Coal from mines near Hon Gay produced the
 major fuel export (to Japan, China, and France), while the cement
 plant at Haiphong exported half its production to neighboring
 Asian nations.  More than two-fifths of the value of imports
 arrived as metal and metal manufactures, while textiles accounted
 for one-fifth of imports.

 Vietnam during the immediate prewar period and in 1949-51.

 Little information is available concerning direct trade
 between North Vietnam and the USSR or other Soviet Bloc countries.
 Many of the above items imported from Communist China are of Soviet
 or Soviet Bloc manufacture. A Viet Minh trade mission has been re-
 ported in Europe in the first quarter of 1954 placing large orders
 for military equipment, vehicles (jeeps, trucks, and buses) pharma-
 ceuticals, and hospital equipment in East Germany, Poland,, and
 Czechoslovakia. 166
 3.  Extent of Material and Technical Assistance Given
 to the Viet Minh. The Viet Minh have received material aid from Communist
 China since at least December 1949 and perhaps since 1948,,  Until
 early 1951 only essential supplies of arms and rice had been sent
 to the Viet Minh, but by summer Communist China began supplying
 material designed to develop the Viet Minh's internal systems of
 supply.  Military equipment and supplies, however, apparently con-
 tinued to be the Bloc's main contribution to the Viet Minh.
 The seale of supply is difficult to estimate.  In
 June 1951, Communist China and the USSR were each said to have
 promised 1,000 tons a month (totaling 2,000 tons per month).  The
 plans for later in the year indicated aid on a lower level of
 possibly 1,300 tons a month, although implementation of the plan
 revealed movements of only 500 to 600 tons a month.

 By =nid-1953, Soviet Bloc aid may have totaled as much as
 2,000 tons a month, according to French sourc.s.  By 195+ there were
 indications of increased military aid, possib'y as much as 3,000 to
 4,000 tons a month. 167   With the end of the war in sight, however,
 the :195' trade agreement called for the excha4ge of industrial goods.
 It has been fairly well establish6d that Chinese Com-
 munist personnel -- instructors, technicians,' political and military
 advisors, and perhaps transport labor along m ,jor supply routes --
 have been operating with the Viet Minh.  Esti  tes on the extent of
 this personnel assistance, however, have varild widely.  While the
 average of the several estimates in the past has been in the neighbor-
 hood of 10,000 to 15,000, there was a gradual] decrease during 1952
 to roughly 5,000.  This decrease was apparent.y attributable to the
 progress made by the Viet Minh in their organization, to the develop-
 ment of training camps in South China, and to; the difficultids en-
 countered by the presence of Chinese in VietLinh zones.  With
 respect to this latter point, it is felt that the Viet Minh, while
 not denying the necessity of Chinese Commmnist assistance, have
 been attempting to reduce the numbers of advisors and technicians
 in Viet Minh zones because of the possibility of a resurgence of
 traditional antipathy among the Indochinese fpr the Chinese.
 The Viet Minh may, in fact, ;purs4e a deliberate. policy
 of restricting contacts between Chinese personnel and the Viet-
 namese populat:_on in order to avoid arousing historic animosities
 held by most V:Letnamese toward the Chinese.  There are no confirmed
 reports of Chiaese combat casualties, except for minor operations
 along the nort'.iern border.  It appears, therefore, that Ch:Lnese
 Communist personnel operate primarily in conjunction with central
 administrative units and at higher command 1 vels, and such a policy
 would definitely limit the capacity of the Viet Minh organization to
 absorb foreign specialists and advisors.
 C.  Relaticris with South Vietnam and. 0th r Asiatic Countries.
 There is probably a limited amount of trade between the Viet
 Minh and the French-held areas in Vietnam despite government efforts
 to maintain a land and sea blockade.  Individuals who have fled from
 Viet Minh territory have stated, without confirmation, that trusted
 Workers' (Communist) Party members are designated in each sector to
 conduct trade with non-Communist regions.

 Although the total volume of such trade is relatively small,
 it has been of considerable importance to the Viet Minh because of
 specific shortages.  Special efforts have been made to secure medical
 supplies, fuel, and transportation equipment and parts, and the Viet
 Minh have admittedly been dependent upon food supplies seized from
 French-controlled areas.
 There have been reports of arms smuggling between Thailand
 and Viet Minh areas, carried on by coastwise shipping to Communist-
 held areas in Cochinchina and overland through Cambodia.  No esti-
 mates of the volume of this traffic can be made from available
 information. .
 D.        Effects on World Trade Patterns of the Inclusion
 of North Vietnam in the Soviet Bloc.
 The Viet Minh certainly will attempt to eliminate the area's
 trade deficit by pushing exports.  It is interesting, however, to note
 that in 1952, coal exports -- one of Tonkin's major foreign exchange
 earners -- would have paid for only 25,000 tons of rice, about 5 per-
 cent of'the possible rice deficit the Viet Minh may face, at least in
 the short run.  The Soviet Bloc is not in a favorable position to give
 aid, although this deficit is relatively small.
 Although the Viet Minh Communist policy is not known, the
 Communists may consider this area important enough to encourage some
 industrialization.  Industrialization, in requiring the importation
 of capital goods from the Soviet Bloc, would increase, although not
 significantly, the stresses and strains already existing within the
 Soviet Bloc.   As the Viet Minh area is already a deficit area, in-
 dustrialization would add to the drain upon Bloc resources.*
 The reopening of the old trade routes from South China through
 Indochina would facilitate the exploitation of South China's minerals
 and the general. development of this area.  In 1937, transit trade from
 Yunnan through Tonkin to China and Hong Kong totaled more than
 50,000 tons valued at US $13.6 million, almost the value of Tonkin's
 exports.
 The primary commodities entering foreign trade from North
 Vietnam before the war are generally supplementary to the Chinese

 economy.  Japan, the largest buyer of Tonkinese coal in the 1930's,
 may be interested in renewing this source of'supply in exchange for
 Japanese textiles and manufactured goods,.  Should a trade relation-
 ship develop between Japan and North Vietnam, China may have an
 opportunity to use Japanese trading desires as a lever to obtain
 trading concessions for herself.  In the absence of Japanese trade
 with North Vietnam, it is probable that the USSR and China can
 furnish North Vietnam with the relatively smll amounts of textiles
 and manufactured goods required.
 Frencb imports from North Vietnam before World War II
 consisted more than 65 percent of corn and of about 10 percent
 each of metals and coal.  French exports to North Vietnam were
 concentrated in metal manufactures (38 percent), textiles (31 per-
 cent), and miscellaneous manufactures (15 percent).  Should all
 trade with North Vietnam be cut off in the future, France should
 have little difficulty obtaining these imports elsewhere in the
 Free World.  Some adjustments may be necessaay in the transition
 of ;French trade to other areas, due to the preferential position
 France enjoyed from Indochinese customs arrangements.
 Of greater immediate significance toi, France than the loss of
 this trading area is the possibility_thtat USlwar aid for Indochina
 may be diverted to other uses.  During the calendar year 1954,
 US $785 million were to be funneled through ;France for the war effort
 in Indochina, thus greatly relieving-the French gold and dollar
 shortage.  At the time of the cease-fire, only US $100 million of this
 amount had been received by France and US $l100 million additional was
 in the pipelir.e.  If the US should decide that all or part of the
 remaining US $,585 million and the US $800 million now scheduled for
 calendar year 1955 should be diverted to Southeast Asian cr other
 defense, these funds would not flow through France and would make it
 increasingly difficult for the French to maintain a foreign currency
 balance.
 VI.  Comparison of the Level of Economic Activities and Viability
 of North and South Vietnam.
 The truce demarcation line divides Vietnam into two areas which
 under normal conditions would form comp:Lementary parts of a national
 economic entity.  Of these, the area now under Viet Minh control
 possesses by far the greater long-term .Dotertial for a viable indus-
 trial economy.  However, this area does not ;produce enough rice to

 support its population of 14 million and will probably be dependent
 upon some grain imports to make up its general food production
 deficit.  North Vietnam contains the only major coal deposits of
 Vietnam, and practically all of the known metallic mineral resources,
 including zinc, tin; iron, tungsten, manganese,. chrome, lead, and
 gold.  In addition, the only cement plant in the country    the
 largest in Southeast Asia -- is located at,Haiphong.  The country's
 two major textile plants are also located in the Viet Minh area,
 ,although these depend upon imports of raw cotton and do not produce
 enough textiles for North Vietnamese requirements.
 It is believed that these resources should enable the Viet Minh
 in time to procure in foreign trade the manufactures which are
 needed for a modest industrial development.  However, the apparent
 unwillingness of the Viet Minh to offer sufficiently attraftive terms
 to the French administrators and managers to continue operating the
 coal mines and industrial installations and to carry on interregional
 and foreign trade poses an immediate problem for the Viet Minh if they
 are to realize any benefit from these economic activities, pending
 the time when Communist technicians and advisors become available.
 Moreover, the extensive capital construction necessary to rebuild
 transport and communications facilities linking North Vietnam to
 the Soviet Bloc, and the improvement of mining and industrial
 facilities -- even to the levels that had been planned in US Foreign
 Operations Administration programs -- is believed to be beyond the
 capabilities of the Viet Minh and.will probably require technical
 assistance from the Bloc in planning, supervision, and additional
 equipment.  The immediate needs for imported food supplies, raw
 cotton, gypsum, and technical equipment will require aid from the
 Bloc if the past level of economic activity in the area is to be
 restored soon.
 For the long term, North Vietnam, as discussed in Section II
 above, possesses a well-balanced resource base for a self-sustaining
 industrial economy but needs technical aid and investment funds to
 develop it.  The USSR has provided substantial technical assistance
 to Communist China in its economic development during the past 5 years.
 It still remains to be determined whether the USSR or Communist China
 is in a position to pass on the lessons which have been learned in
 the initial stages of development of the Chinese economy to another
 Asian country with an even less developed resource base.  North
 Vietnam, however, already seems to be benefiting from the experiences
 of Communist China, as can be observed in the measures for taxation,

 land reform, and centralized control which hav; been promulgated in
 Viet Minh areas Ln the past 3 years.     The expected reconstruction
 of the two railroads linking North Vietnam to China will stimulate
 economic exchanges between the two countries.  China is apparently
 in a position to benefit more at first from the Haiphong-Yunnan rail-
 road connection.  It would provide the means of easy export of
 minerals from Southwest China and of hastening'ithe construction and
 indus-trializaticn programs in that region, whi.e North Vietnam would
 benefit incident ally from the restoration of the railroad line
 through its are?, of prospective resource development.  Thus, in view
 of the early evidences of Chinese Communist aid to the Viet Minh, it
 is believed that necessary technical aid will be forthcoming, at least
 to the extent that is considered mutually beneficial.
 South Vietnam, on the other hand, has practically no resources
 available other than agriculture and will be hard pressed to create
 a self-sustaining economy, even in the long rein.  The area does
 possess an agrioultural base for rice production sufficient to sus-
 tain its populaAon and permit exports, which prior to World Wax II
 amounted to over 50 percent of all exports from Indochina.  Although
 in the past China has been the principal purchaser of Indochinese
 rice, there has been no trade between South Vietnam and China in the
 last several years.  India and other Pacific countries have purchased
 rice from the Cochinchina area, but rice production and consumption
 are quite elastic in these regions and the market quite variable.
 Since rice fron the Cochinchina area is inferior to that of the, other
 two main sources, Thailand and Burma, the demand for Indochinese rice
 is always dependent upon the amount available in those countries.
 Whether rice trading with the Viet Minh areas will be effected is not
 yet clear.
 In addition to rice production, the only other major resource
 available to South Vietnam for foreign trade is natural rubber, pro-
 duction of which. amounted to about 73,00-0 toils in 1953, or about
 5 percent of the world output.  France has been the main market.
 Depending on markets (and on allocation of t1e foreign exchange proceeds
 of exports), t:iese two resources could provide investment funds for a
 modest development of consumer goods industries which would improve
 the self-suffi2iency of the area.
 A major problem immediately facing the South Vietnam government is
 the relocation of an indeterminate number of;ersons refugeeing fromn
 the northern area.  Traditionally unwilling to leave their homes

 to take up free land in the upland regions, the northern Vietnamese
 who accept resettlement in the South will probably be limited for the
 most part to the families of military and functionary personnel de-
 pendent on the government for support.  These number as many as
 330,000 to 350,000 people.  Temporary provisions for their accommoda-
 tion are currently being made.                              There are several sparsely populated
 inland plateau areas where these people could be settled, where they
 could grow such crops as maize, potatoes, beans, manioc, and taro,
 or where they could develop plantation-type crops such as rubber,
 coffee, tea, pepper, or fruits.  However, even at best, these pur-
 suits would be long-term in their effect and no prospect is in
 sight to provide the means of livelihood even for the present
 numbers of civilian personnel seeking resettlement in the South.
 There seems slight chance that -- in the absence of a vigorous and
 efficient organization of migration, agricultural, public works and
 handicraft projects, to utilize the emigrants -- the need for self-
 supporting economic activity for these people can be fulfilled.
 Even with some American aid, the capabilities of the South Vietnamese
 government are being taxed to provide for their welfare.
 On the other hand, a large number of stay-behind cadres and
 guerrilla forces of the Viet Minh can be expected to remain in the
 South to carry on the Viet Minh regime's program of political
 subversion and disruption of economic activity.  In these circum-
 stances, the institutional structure of the South Vietnam economy
 as an agricultural colonial appendage of metropolitan France will be
 subjected to further severe strains.  The continued maintenance and
 protection of French colonial interests in agricultural production
 and trade are at the same time both necessary for the support of the
 present level of economic activity in the area and paralyzing in their
 effect upon native aspirations to develop a viable national economy.
 The long-enforced dependence of Indochina on the metropolitan country
 for manufactured goods has discouraged the development of indigenous
 industry.  At a time when increased economic opportunities are needed
 to support the population and to replace employment in occupations
 connected with interregional and colonial trade, normal private
 sources of investment are lacking to provide the needed maintenance
 and expansion of the small industrial and trade sectors.  In the face
 of the expected further disruption by Communist forces in the area,
 additional foreign economic aid to South Vietnam appears to be more
 than ever required to maintain and develop the economy and. to provide
 stimulation, guidance,and support for projects in public works, agri-
 culture, consumer goods and agricultural tools industries, and
 handicrafts. 168

 VII.  Estimate of Probable Economic Develo  !nts ' n North Vietnam
 through l95 f'
 A. Future ure Soviet Bloc Aid. Up until the time of the cease-fire, t le bulk of aid given
 to the Viet Minh by the Soviet Bloc was of a military nature and
 consisted mostly of military equipment and rations, as well as
 material to develop the Viet Minh's Internal lines of supply.
 Mid-1954 protocols for the exchange of goods between the DRV and
 Communist China `.ndicate that North Vietnam wa scheduled to
 receive very little in the way of capital good  for improving indus-
 trial production from Communist China.  Fu:rthe               ore, there is no
 known grant of a_.d to the Viet Minh such as th grant extended to
 North Korea by the USSR, Communist China, and the European Satel-
 lites, which will reportedly amount to US $300 i4illion and restore
 the 1946-50 leve:_ of economic activity.  On th other hand, because
 of the lack of any information on the Viet Mi   regime's plans for
 economic developzent or on future Soviet Bloc  id to North Vietnam,
 future production can only be estimated there, predicated upon
 North Vietnam's known resources and facilities  the immediate needs
 of Communist China and the USSR, and the desir  of the Peiping
 regime to make &i impressive showing in Indoch na for the benefit
 of the other Southeast Asian countries.
 Under these conditions, it is assumed
 Vietnam will rec,~ive technical and material ai
 particularly from Communist China because the
 gain both economically and politically from th
 Vietnam into the Asian Communist Bloc; and. (2)
 important enough in itself, will be limited by
 1) that North
 from the Soviet Bloc,
 atter has the most to
 integration of North
 that such aid, although
 considerations of
 economic worth and will not be extended tc North Vietnam projects at
 an unrealistic cost.
 B.  Probable Economic Developments through 1 57.
 It is believed that the bulk of Sciviet Bloc aid will be granted
 to (1) connect North Vietnam with Communist Ch na by rail, and to
 improve other transport facilities; (2) exploit the area's coal, tin,
 zinc, chrome,and phosphate resources; (3) provide the cotton textile
 industry with raw cotton; (4) increase cement  roduction; and (5) pro-
 vide food supplies to overcome present shortages.

 S-E-C-R-E-T
 Rehabilitation of the area's railroad system will be expedient
 both strategically and economically to Communist China particularly
 and also to the Soviet Bloc.      By connecting the Chinese Communist
 railroad system to that of North Vietnam north of Lang Son, the Bloc
 will accomplish through railroad service from the USSR through
 Communist China to the Southeast Asian Communist frontier.  Recon-
 struction of the Lao Kay-Haiphong line, on which construction re-
 portedly has already begun, will again allow Communist China use of
 the most expeditious route in exploitation of its Ko-chiu tin and
 other mineral resources found in the Southwest as well as aid Com-
 munist China's construction program for that region.  Reconstruction
 of rail facilities will be accomplished almost entirely with Chinese
 Communist or Bloc materials and technical personnel, and strategically
 will actually benefit the Chinese Communists more than it will the
 Viet Minh.
 In addition to reconstruction of rail facilities, the Soviet
 Bloc will probably aid the Viet Minh in rehabilitating Haiphong harbor.
 Dredging equipment and reconstruction of some wharf and repair facili-
 ties will be required, and the equipment and technical assistance for
 this will also have to come from Communist China and/or the Bloc.
 Emphasis on the area's resources will probably proceed as
 follows (see Table 19*):
 1.  Iron and Steel.
 Although it is estimated that no iron and steel industry
 of any significance will be established by 1957, the export of iron
 ore will undoubtedly be resumed after the restoration of necessary trans-
 portation and mining facilities and will probably equal or surpass the
 prewar production peak of 135,000 tons.  Ferroalloy ore production
 consequently will also be limited to export demands, and probably
 will also surpass past peak production.    Chromite production may
 receive the greatest attention since Communist China has only very
 minor chrome ore deposits of its own, and although present requirements
 are meager they will undoubtedly increase.

 2.  Nonferrous Minerals.
 Zinc production will be of importance to Communist China,
 particularly when and if the zinc smelter at Quang Yen is retorted.
 It is assumed that the Chinese Communists will probably give this
 project high priority inasmuch as their own zinc smelting facilities
 are inadequate, and China is importing zinc metal from Poland.  It
 is therefore believed that zinc production will reach at least
 8,000 tons per year.
 Tin production, the only significant addition to the
 Soviet Bloc as a whole, could possibly reach 1,500 tons by 1957 and
 would be very considerably increased, probably doubled, with the
 acquisition and operation of the Nam Pathene mines in Laos.
 Production of phosphates which reportedly has already
 begun under the Chinese Communists in Lao Kay will continue and
 become more important with the acquisition of the Haiphong phos-.
 phate fertilizer factory.  It is estimated that production of
 phosphates will attain at least.160,000 tons by 1957?
 Although coal production in North Vietnam reached an
 historical peak of 2.6 million tons in 1939, it does not appear
 likely that this figure will be approached by 1957.  The poten-
 tiality for a production greater than the estimated 1957 production
 figure of 1.0 million tons probably exists, but because most pro-
 duction is dependent upon export demands and because present con.-
 ditions do not portend as favorable a coal export situation as
 existed in the late 1930's, it does not seem likely that the coal-
 producing potential in North Vietnam will be fully utilized.  New
 trade agreements made by the Viet Minh regime, however, could
 significantly change the situation within a short time period.
 For example, the resumption of coal exports to Japan alone on the
 1939 level would mean an increased production of about 350,000 tons
 per year.
 4?  Textiles.
 Prior to the partitioning of Vietnam, the cotton textile
 industry, especially the plant at Nam Dinh, was almost entirely de-
 pendent upon the US for its supply of short staple cotton.  Some

 S-E-C-R-E-T
 imports of Ind:_an and Egyptian cotton supplezdented the US supply but
 were not suitable for most of the production.  In 1953 the US, through
 the Foreign Operations Administration,supplid about 8,000 metric tons
 of raw cotton, and prior to the hostilities the cotton textile indus-
 try annually u;3ed 12,000 to 14,000 tons of r w cotton.  Practically
 all cloth and ;Tarn produced by the industry is consumed domestically
 but still does not meet local demand.  The Bloc will be required to
 supply the industry with raw cotton, as well as finished c=loth and
 yarn.  This import requirement should not greatly tax the Bloc.  The
 Nam Dinh mill aas been idle since French withdrawal, but reportedly
 is in excellent condition. '169/.
 5.  Cement.
 The only other industry of North Vietnam to which the
 Bloc probably will grant considerable aid is the Haiphong Cement
 Plant, North Vietnam's most important manufacturing industry.  It
 is estimated that because of its importance  s a new source of
 supply to the Chinese Communists the latter pill exert every effort
 to raise the slant production to 300,000 ton  per year and probably
 will achieve this well before 1957.
 6.  Food.
 For the present, considerab:Le Bloc aid will be required
 to meet the daily living requirements of 14 million Northern Viet-
 namese.  Since the area will be a showcase for the rest of South-
 east Asia to view Communist "progress," it is believed that the
 Bloc will exert considerable efforts to raise the living standard.
 The estimated per capita production of rice .(milled) of 1"C16.2 kilo-
 grams is cons:_derably below the yearly :rice !requirements of an
 Annamite which are estimated to be between 000 and 250 kilograms.
 It is anticipated that rice; production may lie increased somewhat
 in North Vietnam within the next two years.; General food production
 probably will also be increased over the sane time period with
 programs for ;;rowing other food crops and i4creasing fish catch
 production.  The immediate acute needs of North Vietnam for food
 because of a coor crop year will necessitat , however, comparatively
 high imports Df foodstuffs.  These will hav  to come either from
 Communist Chiaa, which is experiencing a bai crop year in 1954
 because of the present floods, from South Vietnam, or from other
 Southeast Asian. rice producers.  In add.itio ., the area will still
 require importation of many daily necessities such as footwear and
 clothing, which in the past have been supplied by France.
