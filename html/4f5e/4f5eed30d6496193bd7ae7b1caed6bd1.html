 Synopsis
 1          Perspective-OPEC: Implications of the Production Agreement
 OPEC's decision to return to adherence to a quota system is in line with Saudi ara-
 bia's objective of garnering producer cooperation and fulfills Iran's goal of
 increasing prices. Strict compliance could push the average world oil price to about
 $15 per barrel in the near term.
 3          Australia: Politics of Wheat Exports Roils Relations With the United States
 With national elections less than 18 months away, Prime Minister Hawke is
 concerned about the effects of the US Export Enhancement Program (EEP) on
 Australia's wheat sales next year. Some members of Hawke's government are
 urging him to use the US-Australian joint defense facilities as a bargaining chip,
 but we doubt this linkage will be made in the bilateral ministerial beginning 10
 August in San Francisco.
 9       Colombia: Economic Challenges for the New Administration
 President Barco takes office this week with the benefit of an improving economy.
 The new president, nonetheless, needs to tackle high unemployment, control
 inflationary pressures, and prevent mismanagement of the coffee bonanza.
 Tunisia's worsening economic situation is severely depressing the country's living
 standards and is adding to an already high level of political tension. While the gov-
 ernment is finally beginning to confront the country's economic difficulties,
 memories of the bloody January 1984 food riots will probably hamper implementa-
 tion of the government's structural adjustment program.
 17         Key LDC Debtors: Grappling With Capital Flight
 Capital flight, which we estimate has bled over $180 billion from the key LDC
 debtors over the past decade, remains an obstacle to the solution of their
 international financial problems. Unless the debtors implement structural reform,
 which would remove the powerful incentives for capital outflows, we believe their
 financial straits will persist, multiplying economic problems and undermining
 political stability

 23         Syria: Limited Help From Domestic Oil Gain
 Oil from Syria's new Thayyem field will only marginally strengthen Syria's
 economy, but will make Damascus less dependent on Iran for concessional oil
 shipments. Syria will continue to run a large current account deficit and suffer
 chronic foreign exchange shortages, which will add to President Assad's political
 problems.

 Perspective          OPEC: Implications of the Production Agreement
 OPEC's decision to return to adherence to a quota system is in line with Saudi
 Arabia's objective of garnering producer cooperation and fulfills Iran's goal of
 increasing prices. Strict compliance could push prices substantially above current
 levels in the near term. If the agreement collapses, however, and the Saudis renew
 the price war, oil prices could fall below current levels for an extended period.
 The agreement calls for OPEC production of about 16.6 million b/d during
 September and October, some 3.6 million b/d below current levels. The burden of
 the cuts will fall on Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE-Iraq is not bound to a
 production quota. Prices are expected to remain volatile over the near term.
 Market psychology and a sharp cut in OPEC output could push the average world
 oil price to about $15 per barrel in the near term from its current $11 per barrel
 range. Spot prices for some crudes have increased by $5 since Monday.
 Considerable uncertainty remains over OPEC's ability to reduce its output to the
 target level. Past trends suggest that the membership will not abide by the quotas.
 The UAE reportedly was particularly reluctant to agree to the proposal and
 probably will be slow to comply. Substantial distrust exists among members, and
 they have warned that violations-even if marginal-would lead to a rapid
 collapse of the agreement. OPEC plans to monitor member compliance but has no
 enforcement mechanism. Most OPEC producers realize the consequences of
 indiscipline, however, and might be cautious about attempting to recoup this year's
 losses by exceeding their quotas. Indeed, the financial pain producers have
 experienced in recent months and the prospect of still greater losses in a continued
 price war may well encourage greater adherence to the scheme. Promises of
 support from some non-OPEC producers-including Mexico and Malaysia-may
 also encourage OPEC discipline.
 The Saudi strategy to increase its market share enacted last September was
 designed to raise near-term revenues, to force other producers to reduce output,
 and to ensure a long-term market for their oil. Although the Saudis probably
 hoped that oil prices would stabilize at about $15 per barrel-an amount that
 would generate the minimum required revenues at their quota level-excess
 production by other OPEC members forced prices to fall further. The Saudi policy
 also succeeded in cutting Iran's oil revenues, an incidental but desirable result in
 Riyadh's view. The new agreement is in line with Saudi Arabia's basic objectives.
 Despite absorbing the largest production cut, Riyadh has succeeded in getting
 other members to share in the reductions and would remain the world's largest oil
 exporter, an important Saudi objective.

 other OPEC members to unite in pressing Riyadh to reach an agreement.
 Tehran considers the agreement a success because it will boost prices without Iran
 having to cut output. Iran also will view the agreement as a victory for its
 campaign of intimidation against Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, highlighted by
 its attacks earlier this year on Saudi ships and by the probable Iranian-sponsored
 sabotage of Kuwaiti oil facilities. Tehran will claim that its lobbying convinced the

 The Saudis still hold the trump cards, and if other OPEC members fail to adhere
 to the agreement Riyadh will have little incentive to restrain output. Faced with
 quota violations by other members, the Saudis probably would renew the market
 share fight and force prices down again. If OPEC members were to join the fight
 and attempt to force their remaining excess capacity-currently about 4 million
 b/d-onto the market, oil prices could fall to about $5 per barrel, their lowest level
 in real terms since before the Arab oil embargo in 1973. In the absence of
 producer cooperation, some industry analysts believe that oil prices would then
 force a reevaluation of oil and economic policies.
 Although not specifically an anti-US policy, an attempt by Riyadh to keep prices
 low would hurt oil exploration and development activity in high-cost areas such as
 the United States, Canada, and the North Sea. If prices held at around $5 per bar-
 rel for an extended period, domestic political pressures in many countries would

 Australia: Politics of
 Wheat Exports Roils Relations
 With the United States
 With national elections less than 18 months away,
 Prime Minister Hawke is concerned about the effects
 of the US Export Enhancement Program (EEP) on
 Australia's wheat sales next year. Wheat farmers
 have been hardest hit by declining commodity prices,
 and Hawke undoubtedly believes he cannot afford to
 ignore their pleas to use his claimed "special relation-
 ship" with the US administration to win them relief.
 Moreover, wheat farmers are traditionally the most
 vocal of Australia's relatively militant farmers and
 exert more political pressure than their numbers
 would indicate. Some members of Hawke's govern-
 ment are urging him to use the US-Australian joint
 defense facilities as a bargaining chip, but we doubt
 this linkage will be made in the bilateral ministerial
 beginning 10 August in San Francisco.
 Farmers-who provide more than one-third of Aus-
 tralia's export income-have been hurting the past
 years.' The value of agricultural production fell 21
 percent in 1985, largely because of low commodity
 prices, and probably will fall another 21 percent in
 1986, according to the Australian Bureau of Agricul-
 tural Economics. Despite high yields, more than one-
 half of the country's grain farms suffered net losses
 this year. According to our estimates, average farm
 income on family farms for the year ending 30 June
 1986 fell below $5,000, less than an Australian family
 can collect from welfare programs.
 Under these conditions, farmers have combined their
 economic leverage with militant tactics to gain politi-
 cal concessions from Canberra. In July 1985, 40,000
 farmers marched on the capital, and five months later
 a group from New South Wales dumped 30 tons of
 wheat on the Parliament steps to protest low prices-
 $135 a ton in December 1985 versus $90 now-and
 high domestic interest rates. These tactics
 ' Wheat is the most important crop, involving 45,000 farms and
 about 25 percent of the country's farmers. This year 98 percent of
 apparently brought results. During the first quarter of
 this year, Hawke granted special tariff rebates on
 fertilizer imports and tax rebates on farm fuel, pri-
 marily to prevent the Labor Party from losing its
 control of several states in elections early this year.
 The Prime Minister remains vulnerable to farmer
 dissatisfaction because the loss of nine of the Labor
 Party's 12 rural seats in the House of Representatives
 in the next national election-which must be held by
 January 1988-would topple the Hawke government.
 To complicate Hawke's political future, growth in the
 nonfarm sectors has slackened as a result of the
 weakness in world commodity prices. Real economic
 growth is likely to be less than 2 percent this year-
 compared with 4.5 percent last year-and unemploy-
 ment has risen slightly to about 8 percent. The
 current account deficit continues to widen, despite the
 27-percent depreciation of the Australian dollar in the
 last 18 months, which in itself has contributed to an
 inflation rate of over 9 percent annually. In addition,
 after a three-year lull in industrial turmoil-primarily
 due to the government taking an active part in wage
 negotiations-Australia's trade unions last month be-
 gan a series of strikes that we believe is likely to
 continue until at least September, when preparations
 for new wage negotiations will begin.
 From Hawke's perspective, the EEP darkens an al-
 ready grim export outlook. International wheat prices
 are plunging because of high world wheat stocks,
 stagnant demand, and rapidly increasing production
 both in traditional wheat exporting countries and in
 former major wheat importers-such as Brazil, Chi-
 na, and the EC. World stocks now total over a full
 year's trade. Major grain producers are adopting
 aggressive export tactics to compete in this environ-
 ment including low-interest credit terms, attractive
 freight rates, and direct export subsidies to boost sales
 to the major cash buyers-the USSR, China, and
 Japan.

 US Farm Policy and the World Wheat Picture
 The 1985 US Farm Bill-in effect for the next five
 years-was designed to make US grain exports more
 competitive. It mandated a $1 billion, three-year
 Export Enhancement Program (EEP) to promote US
 sales and reduced rates on loans to US farmers. The
 EEP offers payment-in-kind crop bonuses from gov-
 ernment stocks to promote exports to targeted mar-
 kets where the United States faces competition from
 heavy subsidizers such as the EC. The United States
 has provided assurances that subsidies would be
 targeted to these markets and would not harm other
 US allies or nonsubsidizers. Last month proposals
 were made to broaden the EEP to include all tradi-
 tional US grain customers-including the USSR and
 In addition to Australia, the expanded EEP will
 sharply depress the export earnings and trade out-
 look for other major wheat exporters-including
 Canada, the European Community, and Argentina.
 Any US action that displaced sales to the USSR,
 Canada's most important market-a new Canada-
 USSR long-term grain agreement is scheduled to be
 signed this fall-would politically damage Prime
 Minister Mulroney. He feels the plan would force
 Ottawa to match US subsidies in order to maintain
 the Canadian market share, thereby undermining his
 efforts to control Canada's budget deficit.[
 China.
 The US wheat price sets a floor price for other wheat
 exporters. Under US farm legislation, wheat farmers
 take out loans to finance production using their
 potential wheat crop as collateral. The wheat price
 set by the government and used to calculate a
 farmer's loan amount, called the loan rate, acts as a
 guaranteed minimum price because the farmer can
 forfeit his crop to the US Government if the world
 price falls below the loan rate. In recent years, high
 US loan rates have propped up global wheat prices
 and, in combination with required sizable US acreage
 reductions, provided a powerful incentive to other
 nations to boost grain production.
 The new US farm policy is likely to raise US farm
 export volume but sharply depress world grain prices
 over the next few years. According to some econo-
 mists, world farm commodity prices could drop 50
 percent below last year's levels and stay low for the
 next five years
 The EC also considers the USSR an especially
 important market because of its size and closeness,
 and US subsidies would fuel EC suspicions that the
 United States is directly attacking its Common Agri-
 cultural Policy. Even without US subsidies, lower
 world grain prices expected this marketing year as a
 result of the new US Farm Bill could add $1 billion
 to the cost of EC export subsidies. As a result, the
 EC would react strongly to subsidized sales to the

 b The $90 price for next year is the Chase Econometrics' estimate of
 the US wheat export price next year, taking into account the effects
 of the US Farm Bill but not an extension of the EEP. The $75 price
 is the world price we estimate would prevail with an EEP extension.
 The table above does not show the effects of the EEP on the
 quantity of wheat Australia might sell. According to our estimates,
 if the EEP is extended to the USSR and the Soviets next year buy
 the full amount of wheat specified in their current US long-term
 agreement (4 million tons), Australia's sales to the Soviets in
 1986/87 could fall from an estimated 3 million tons to 1.5 million
 tons, cutting revenues by $155 million. China has not entered long-
 term agreements for wheat purchases since 1983. Thus we are less
 able to predict how much wheat China would import from Austra-
 lia or the United States in 1986/87, although industry and USDA
 analysts estimate China's wheat imports are likely to be the same as
 or slightly less than this year, barring major crop disasters.
 Hawke, however, is probably worried more about the
 overall effects of the EEP on wheat prices. We
 estimate next year's price will fall to $75 per ton if the
 EEP expansion becomes effective. In this case, Aus-
 tralia stands to lose as much as $245 million on its
 wheat exports in 1986/87. It is conceivable that
 Australia could lose even more revenue-if the quan-
 tity sold also falls-but Australia so far has competed
 aggressively with EEP sales-by offering, for exam-
 ple, liberal credit programs or discounts for cash
 purchases. For this reason we expect Australia to
 maintain its current volume share)
 just below the surface.
 Although Foreign Minister Hayden stresses that secu-
 rity issues and trade issues will not be linked in the
 San Francisco talks, some members of Hawke's gov-
 ernment-echoing popular sentiments-say that Aus-
 tralia should use the US-Australian joint facilities as
 a bargaining chip in attempts to thwart further
 expansion of the EEP. We do not believe the Austra-
 lian participants will directly threaten to close the
 facilities, but, if the proposed expansion becomes law,
 tensions will be high and such a threat will remain

 Colombia: Economic Challenges
 for the New Administration
 President Barco takes office this week with the benefit
 of an improving economy. The recent coffee price
 windfall and government stabilization measures have
 slowed inflation, strengthened the external accounts,
 and boosted economic growth. The new president,
 nonetheless, needs to tackle high unemployment, con-
 trol inflationary pressures, and prevent mismanage-
 ment of the coffee bonanza.
 Colombia is experiencing a healthy recovery from the
 economic stagnation that greeted President Betancur
 four years ago. Lower government spending and new
 taxes cut the public deficit in half in 1985. Leading
 Colombian firms refinanced their foreign debts, halt-
 ing the erosion of foreign exchange reserves, accord-
 ing to local banking sources. The ailing financial
 system-which has suffered from a lack of liquidity,
 widespread domestic corruption, and insider loans
 made by the banks-is in better shape than a year
 ago, and domestic interest rates are set by market
 forces. Relaxed import controls have reduced short-
 ages of manufacturing and agricultural inputs. The
 subsequent impact on prices has helped keep inflation
 at 10 percent for the first six months of 1986-the
 government goal is 22 percent for the year.
 This year's rebound in world coffee prices and lower
 world interest rates have improved Colombian exter-
 nal accounts. New oil production has made the nation
 self-sufficient, eliminating $300 million in yearly oil
 import bills. Moreover, oil and coal exports will be
 roughly double last year's level. During the 12-month
 period ending in May, coffee earnings and capital
 repatriation-in response to more attractive domestic
 interest rates-pushed the foreign exchange reserves
 up 43 percent to about $2 billion.
 Nonetheless, Colombia's two-year stabilization pro-
 gram has slowed the domestic economy. Official
 statistics indicate that real GDP grew only 2.5 percent

 Mining and construction revived this spring, but
 agriculture and commerce remain depressed. More-
 over, unemployment is at a record 15 percent. Bogota
 has issued bonds and accelerated payments for im-

 money supply, generated by the coffee windfall. Al-
 though monetary stabilization measures have taken
 out of circulation about 50 billion pesos since January,
 the money supply is growing at an average annual

 and a voluntary-and successful-stabilization pro-

 president's greatest fiscal challenge will probably be
 to limit inflation and prevent mismanagement of the
 current coffee bonanza, which may produce nearly
 $3 billion in foreign exchange earnings this year.
 Despite the government's success in keeping inflation
 down during the first half of this year, gains in wages
 and a flexible devaluation policy may result in an
 annual rate of about 25 percent. The chief danger is a
 pattern of short-term planning that has characterized
 previous Colombian policymaking in similar situa-
 tions and contributed to the serious weakening of the
 economy during the last coffee boom (1976-78).

 The Role of Narcotics and Other Contraband
 in the Colombian Economy
 The US Embassy reports that, as a share of GDP,
 illegal earnings from cocaine and marijuana smug-
 gling have increased since mid-1985. The estimated
 annual value of illegal drugs produced or processed
 in Colombia has fluctuated from $400 million to at
 least $1.6 billion over the past five years
 Drug earnings are Colom-
 bia's second most important source offoreign ex-
 change after coffee. Illegal earnings from the drug
 trade were equivalent to about 20 percent of total
 legal exports in 1985, up from 12 percent in 1983, but
 not all these revenues returned to Colombia. In
 addition, the US Embassy reports that illicit im-
 ports-mainly smuggled consumer goods-financed
 by drug money probably amount to $400-500 million
 a year.
 Colombian agriculture has significant potential for
 expansion and diversification. The World Bank re-
 cently granted $425 million in loans to strengthen the
 agricultural sector. Barco's integrated rural develop-
 ment program is aimed at increasing food production
 and alleviating rural unemployment. Insurgent activi-
 ty, however, has hampered the past efforts to imple-
 ment rural development projects and will pose obsta-
 cles to Barco's program.
 US commercial interests would benefit from a sus-
 tained economic recovery in Colombia-the third-
 largest US export market in Latin America. We
 foresee increased opportunities for US sales as a result
 of Bogota's import liberalization and improved for-
 eign exchange situation, continuing the late 1985
 upturn. Because of the need to diversify exports, the
 Barco government probably will criticize US counter-
 vailing duty actions on Colombian goods, including
 textiles and cut flowers. On the regional debt front,
 Bogota's willingness to adopt IMF-monitored policies
 and good macroeconomic management record could
 serve as a role model for other Latin American
 debtors. Nevertheless, guerrilla attacks on oil facili-
 ties and other economic targets will continue to
 discourage foreign investment, despite Barco's plans
 to attract new capital.

 The Tunisian Economy:
 At an Impasse
 Tunisia's worsening economic situation is severely
 depressing the country's living standards and is add-
 ing to an already high level of political tension. The
 appointment of Rachid Sfar, former Minister of
 Economy and Finance, as Prime Minister, last month,
 along with other cabinet changes, indicates growing
 government awareness of the urgency of the problem.
 At the same time, however, fears that new austerity
 measures will prompt a repeat of the bloody January
 1984 food riots have so far held President Bourguiba's
 government back from effectively addressing
 Tunisia's economic woes. These same fears will also
 probably hamper implementation of the government's
 structural adjustment program recently proposed to
 facilitate desperately needed foreign aid. Reduced
 consumer subsidies, minimal wage increases, and a
 hefty currency devaluation-all long-standing issues
 with Western donors-are almost certain to generate
 popular unrest. Nevertheless, Tunis is looking at a
 current account deficit that could exceed $1 billion
 this year, and, without some financial relief, will
 encounter severe problems in meeting even essential
 needs.
 ? Unemployment has hit the young hardest-70 per-
 cent of the populace is under the age of 26, and the
 population is growing at a rate of nearly 4 percent
 annually.
 Nevertheless, fears of popular backlash to the new
 austerity measures have held the Bourguiba govern-
 ment back from effectively addressing Tunisia's eco-
 nomic woes. Tunis had attempted in 1983 to begin to
 realign the economy and ease the country's financial
 bind by slashing consumer subsidies and imports,
 restricting development expenditures, and freezing
 wages. Local reaction to these measures was largely
 muted. In January 1984, however, the government
 misjudged public patience. Tunis removed subsidies
 on wheat-a staple of the Tunisian diet-causing
 bread prices to double and triggering nationwide riots.
 The disturbances were quieted only after the military
 was called in and Bourguiba reinstituted the subsi-
 dies. Wary of further backlash, the government has
 instituted few new reforms since. It has carefully
 avoided any politically sensitive reforms-such as
 devaluation-necessary to bring spending more in line
 with revenues and to broaden the economic base.
 Tunisia, like its North African neighbors, depends on
 oil for its economic well-being. The petroleum sector
 accounts for 40 percent of export receipts, 20 percent
 of government revenues, and 10 percent of GDP. As
 with other oil producers, the prolonged oil market
 slump has had a decidedly negative impact on Tuni-
 sia's domestic economy:
 ? Real GDP per capita-at $1,100, still among the
 highest in Africa-has sunk far below the oil-boom
 levels of the late 1970s.
 ? Inflation is running on an annual basis at almost 14
 percent, while wages remain frozen at 1983 levels.
 ? The economic slowdown has pushed unemployment
 over 30 percent, and unemployment and underem-
 ployment together are as high as 50 to 60 percent in
 urban areas.
 Last year, the poor performance in the petroleum
 sector was at least partially offset by surprisingly
 strong performances in both agriculture and tourism.
 This year, however, these sectors are in trouble.
 Inadequate rain is curtailing cereals production-
 producing sporadic shortages-and threatening herds.
 In addition, Tunisia's tourism industry is still feeling
 the effects of the Israeli raid on Tunis in October and
 continued Libyan terrorist threats.
 Other sources of revenue also are sluggish. World
 demand for raw phosphate remains depressed, be-
 cause of oversupply and an industry shift toward using
 phosphoric acid and other processed derivatives. The

 malnutrition and unprecedented crime levels. Dis-
 gruntlement with economic conditions, in general, has
 already led to several localized demonstrations
 against the government. Many of the towns are the
 same ones involved in the January 1984 disturbances,
 which quickly spread north to impoverished urban
 areas.
 Looking Ahead
 The continuing slump in world oil prices, along with
 poor performances in nearly every other sector of the
 economy, presages a very difficult year. Economic
 growth could well be negative-as much as 3 per-
 cent-for the first time in over two decades. Tunis
 also faces a sixth straight year of current account
 deficits; this year's shortfall could surpass the 1984
 record of slightly more than $1 billion.
 After months of ignoring mounting pressure from aid
 donors for action, the Bourguiba government is finally
 beginning to confront the country's accelerating eco-
 nomic difficulties. According to Embassy reporting,
 Tunisia decided in June to implement a six-year
 structural adjustment program in conformity with
 reforms long advocated by the World Bank and other
 Western donors. The program will reportedly empha-
 size demand restraint and export promotion. Adjust-
 ments slated for this year include price increases in
 basic commodities such as milk, sugar, corn, soybean
 meal, bread, pasta, and cooking oil, no wage increases
 except the minimum wage, about $250 million in
 budget and development spending cuts, modifications
 of price and import controls, and a free float of the
 Tunisian dinar, which is expected to result in an
 effective devaluation of 11 to 14 percent. Government
 changes announced in July, which elevated the former
 Minister of Economy and Finance, Sfar, to Prime
 Minister and promoted the architect of Tunisia's
 adjustment plan, former Minister of Planning Khelil,
 to Minister of Economy, Finance, and Planning un-
 derscore the government's new resolve.
 The structural adjustment program as presently writ-
 ten would significantly ease Tunisia's economic diffi-
 culties over the long run. Reduced government subsi-
 dies on food, development spending cuts, and
 continued wage restraints, for example, hit three
 major sources of budgetary deficits. Altering the
 country's exchange rate should also make Tunisian
 nonoil exports more competitive and help keep a lid on
 import demand. Moreover, an adjusted dinar along
 with reduced import controls and revised tariff and
 customs duties will eventually help promote new
 exports, broadening Tunisia's economic base and
 making the economy less susceptible to the vagaries of
 the world oil market.
 We also believe, however, that many of the proposed
 reforms could easily spawn domestic unrest long
 before the program churns out any benefits. A partic-
 ularly explosive element in the government plan is the
 hard line on wages combined with gradual cuts in
 most food subsidies. The decline in purchasing power
 would be even more sizable if accompanied by the
 proposed devaluation. Reduced development expendi-
 tures could also touch off unrest as project cancella-
 tions cause layoffs or firings at a time when unem-
 ployment is already at record levels.
 As a result, we believe that backstepping from this
 year's goals or, at the very least, a stretching-out of
 the reform timetable is likely. In our opinion, the 1984
 riots are seared into the collective memory of the
 Bourguiba government, and those memories will tem-
 per any zeal for reform. At the same time, Tunis
 cannot abandon the adjustment package entirely for
 fear of losing promised international aid. For exam-
 ple, Tunis's proposed program probably was behind
 the World Bank's recent decision to provide some
 $180 million in agricultural and industrial develop-
 ment loans. The Bank is also considering loans in the
 public enterprise and housing sectors. Embassy
 sources claim that Tunis may use its structural adjust-
 ment program as collateral to draw on automatically
 available IMF funds and other multilateral aid
 sources for another $160 million. These amounts are
 in addition to a $175 million Euroloan secured earlier
 this year.

 Key LDC Debtors: Grappling
 With Capital Flight'
 Capital flight, which we estimate has bled nearly
 $180 billion from the key LDC debtors over the past
 decade, remains an obstacle to the solution of their
 international financial problems. The debtors are
 having a harder time balancing their international
 accounts because high borrowing requirements-due
 in part to continuing capital flight-are running up
 against creditors' resistance to new lending. In addi-
 tion, lenders are using the capital flight issue to justify
 further lending cutbacks. Unless the debtors imple-
 ment structural reform, which would remove the
 powerful incentives for capital outflows, we believe
 their financial straits will persist, multiplying econom-
 ic problems and undermining political stability.
 We define capital flight as the net accumulation of
 foreign assets by private citizens. This accumulation
 is the natural reaction of residents, who are trying to
 preserve or increase their wealth, to prevailing eco-
 nomic and political conditions. Capital flight cannot
 be measured directly or accurately because of its
 often surreptitious nature. However, crude estimates
 can be made using balance-of-payments and debt
 data. We use the "implicit capital outflow" method,
 which estimates capital flight as a residual. Our
 estimate equals net foreign direct investment plus net
 foreign borrowing minus the change in nongold re-
 serves plus the current account balance. Because of
 the many shortcomings of this method, our estimates
 should not be viewed as point estimates, but rather as
 benchmarks representing the minimum level of capi-
 According to our estimates, the flight of capital from
 the key LDC debtors had accelerated dramatically
 before the international financial crisis began in 1982.
 Capital flight reached a peak of $31 billion in 1981-
 up from $9 billion in 1976. The $86 billion that left
 these countries during 1980-82 is equivalent to 52
 percent of their net foreign borrowing, 12 percent of
 their gross fixed investment, and nearly 3 percent of
 aggregate GDP. Mexico, Argentina, and Venezuela
 were the hardest hit during this period, while Brazil
 was virtually untouched by capital flight.
 The unprecedented flight of capital from the key
 LDC debtors during 1980-82 can be traced primarily
 to economic mismanagement:
 ? We believe overvalued exchange rates were the key
 cause of this capital exodus. When currency devalu-
 ations failed to keep pace with inflation, the debtors'
 real exchange rates appreciated by over 30 percent
 LDC debtors include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Nigeria,
 Peru, the Philippines, and Venezuela. Dollar values are measured in
 1985 US dollars, and growth rates were calculated from constant-
 tal flight.
 during 1978-81. Overvalued exchange rates made
 foreign assets cheaper and raised the specter of
 large devaluations.
 ? Negative returns on domestic assets were also an
 important cause of capital flight. Real interest rates
 grew increasingly negative as governments fixed
 nominal interest rates below the rising rate of
 inflation.
 ? Heightened uncertainty over imminent economic
 adjustment made assessing the returns and risks of
 domestic assets difficult. There also was increased
 political uncertainty arising from martial law, mili-
 tary coups, rising political opposition, and transi-
 tions to civilian rule.

 Although our estimates indicate that outflows have
 tapered off since the international financial crisis
 began, capital flight continued to plague the key LDC
 debtors. As massive capital outflows from Mexico and
 Argentina were partially staunched, capital flight fell
 from $31 billion in 1981 to less than $8 billion in
 1985. We believe, however, this capital loss inflicted
 more damage than past episodes of capital flight
 because of the severe foreign exchange shortage dur-
 ing the period. The $37 billion that left during 1983-
 85 was equivalent to nearly 75 percent of net foreign
 borrowing. We also believe capital flight may have
 been even higher because, with tighter capital con-
 trols, outflows that once were easily measured were
 pushed underground and became impossible to detect.
 ? The most important step taken to limit capital flight
 was the move to more realistic exchange rates.
 Faced with financial crisis, these countries devalued
 their currencies by 40 percent in real terms during
 1982-85, pushing up the domestic currency cost of
 foreign assets.
 ? A drop in savings-the funds available to finance
 foreign asset purchases-also stifled capital flight.
 Forced economic austerity in the key LDC debtors
 led to a 13-percent contraction in the pool of savings
 during 1983-85. Resident saving was stagnant, and
 savings from foreign sources plummeted when for-
 eign borrowing was curtailed.
 We believe a combination of new foreign exchange
 policies and economic austerity reduced capital out-
 flows from the key LDC debtors:

 ? Most debtors also implemented stringent capital
 controls in hopes of buying time so the lingering
 problems of negative real interest rates and height-
 ened uncertainty could be addressed.
 The mechanics of capital flight illustrate why the key
 LDC debtors have had difficulty halting capital out-
 flows. Our analysis indicates that nearly all segments
 of society acquired foreign assets:
 ? Government officials were implicated in the most
 flagrant cases of capital flight. Per capita, they
 probably acquired more foreign assets than any
 other group. Corrupt chief executives were the
 premier capital flight artists, but cabinet ministers
 and bureaucrats also funneled illegal payments
 overseas.
 ? In fact, the business community, including promi-
 nent businessmen, small businessmen, and multina-
 tional corporations, probably moved the most capi-
 tal abroad. Their decisions to convert domestic
 profits to foreign assets were based almost exclu-
 sively on economic fundamentals.
 ? The general public also participated in a small way
 in the foreign asset rush. Even the unsophisticated
 learned the benefits of holding foreign assets. Resi-
 dents often held US dollars "in the mattress." The
 general populace also acquired assets overseas
 through banking channels or by carrying small
 amounts of capital abroad.

 We believe most of the capital that left key LDC
 debtors before the financial crisis moved overtly
 through legitimate channels. Unless the funds were
 tainted, there was no need to develop complicated
 schemes when capital controls were weak. In most
 cases, residents made deposits in local banks, and the
 funds were transferred by wire to accounts overseas.
 Capital was also physically carried out of the country.
 Residents mailed bank drafts overseas for deposit in
 foreign accounts or brought bundles of cash with
 largest recipient, with Switzerland a distant second,
 Funds were also moved
 offshore to Panama, Hong Kong, and smaller havens
 such as the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas. A
 small amount flowed to nearby LDCs. Once capital
 was shifted abroad, we estimate that residents invest-
 ed about two-thirds of it in financial assets and the
 rest in personal and business property.

 them on foreign trips.
 As capital controls tightened, residents developed
 increasingly elaborate schemes to transfer funds
 abroad:
 ? The least elaborate ploys involve smuggling.=
 everything from
 cattle to Krugerrands is smuggled, but financial
 assets-cash, bonds, bank drafts, and traveler's
 checks-are the preferred cargo. Contraband is
 then converted to hard currency and the proceeds
 invested.
 ? More elaborate schemes to move funds abroad
 involve misreporting. Exporters underinvoice ship-
 ments and remit to the central bank only a portion
 of foreign exchange earnings. Importers overinvoice
 purchases and draw extra foreign exchange from
 the central bank.
 ? Clever residents also concocted more exotic ploys.
 They developed schemes to acquire readily convert-
 ible assets, such as gold, foreign exchange, or even
 airline tickets, for shipment overseas. Citizens also
 devised ways to hide their capital transfers through
 legitimate banking and commercial channels. Resi-
 dents engage in parallel transactions such as curren-
 cy swaps that enable them to acquire foreign assets
 without actually transferring funds across the bor-
 der.
 Analysis of press and diplomatic reporting indicates
 that residents of the key LDC debtors invested their
 flight capital in an array of assets around the world.
 We believe about three-fourths of this capital ended
 up in developed countries. The United States was the
 Although individuals benefited, we believe capital
 flight has had serious economic effects on the debtor
 countries:
 ? Higher foreign debt is the principal legacy. As
 capital streamed out of these countries, governments
 borrowed abroad to replace it. This policy set off a
 capital-flight foreign-borrowing spiral that was
 probably responsible for about one-half the buildup
 in their foreign debt during the past decade.
 ? Capital flight also reduced real income, leading to a
 lower standard of living for most citizens. As capital
 left the country, the pool of funds available for
 investment contracted, and domestic capital forma-
 tion dropped off. This investment slump in turn
 reduced the countries' potential to produce goods
 and services.
 ? Capital flight also increased income inequality.
 Those who acquired foreign assets, mostly the
 wealthy, received special benefits. Their foreign
 asset purchases were subsidized through overvalued
 exchange rates. Moreover, they purchased foreign
 assets paying high returns while others had to settle
 for at best the low returns available domestically.
 Assessing the political fallout from capital flight is
 difficult, but logic and anecdotal information suggest
 that capital flight has affected the political environ-
 ment in these countries. As residents moved their
 capital abroad, their national allegiance was eroded
 because they had less personal stake in their coun-

 tries' future. Capital flight also provided ammunition
 for the opposition, who used the issue to embarrass
 political leaders and undermine government support.
 Moreover, when capital flight made economic inequi-
 ties more pronounced, some residents may have been
 attracted to leftist ideologies promising income equali-
 ty.
 While the exodus of capital from the key LDC
 debtors has slowed, we believe capital flight remains a
 major obstacle to the solution of their international
 financial problems. Capital outflows are keeping for-
 eign borrowing requirements high at a time when
 access to foreign credit is severely limited. With
 foreign exchange scarce, capital flight is inflicting
 more damage on their balance of payments than ever
 before. Lenders are also seizing on capital flight to
 justify further lending cuts. They point to the fact
 that over 70 percent of the funds borrowed abroad
 since 1982 were used to acquire foreign assets-up
 from about 50 percent during 1980-82.
 Our analysis indicates that structural reform, rather
 than tighter capital controls, would slow the exodus of
 funds by removing the incentive for capital flight.
 Historically, these countries have relied on capital
 controls to limit capital flight, but controls have been
 only partially effective. Well-connected elites operate
 above the law, and even the less powerful employ
 numerous methods to acquire foreign assets illegally.
 In contrast, more realistic exchange rates raise the
 cost of foreign assets. Financial market deregulation
 makes domestic assets more attractive by raising real
 returns. Consistent economic policies and strong dem-
 ocratic institutions reduce the risk of holding domestic
 assets.
 If the key LDC debtors can overcome the obstacles to
 structural reform, repatriation of foreign assets accu-
 mulated by their residents may hold a key to the
 solution of their international financial problems. We
 believe residents own a stock of foreign assets equal to
 at least one-half the foreign debt of these countries.
 The debtors might entice some of this capital back if
 they adopted structural reform. Repatriated capital
 would help relieve balance-of-payments pressures and
 cut foreign borrowing requirements. Even if residents
 kept their foreign assets but repatriated earnings, the
 impact on international accounts would be significant.
 If the obstacles prove insurmountable and the key
 LDC debtors fail to adopt structural reform, we
 believe capital outflows will remain stubbornly high
 and international financial problems will continue to
 dog these countries. They will have a harder time
 balancing their international accounts when inflated
 foreign borrowing requirements bump up against cre-
 ditors' increased resistance to new lending. Forced to
 trim their international outlays, they probably would
 lobby even harder for debt service relief rather than
 institute greater import cuts. If concessions are not
 granted by creditors, more debtors might suspend
 principal repayments and limit interest payments.

 Syria: Limited Help From
 Domestic Oil Gains
 Oil from Syria's new Thayyem field will only margin-
 ally strengthen Syria's economy but will make Da-
 mascus less dependent on Iran for concessional oil
 shipments. The new field will begin producing 50,000
 to 60,000 b/d in September when a new pipeline is
 completed and is expected to produce 100,000 b/d by
 1988. Initially, this will reduce Syria's dependence on
 imported oil by about 40 percent. A stronger domestic
 oil industry will barely put a dent in Syria's profound
 economic problems, which result from years of misdi-
 rected Ba'thist policies and burdensome military
 spending. Syria will continue to run a large current
 account deficit and suffer chronic foreign exchange
 shortages, which will add to President Assad's politi-

 cal problems.
 Although crude oil and products account for over 60
 percent of exports, Syria is a net importer of oil.
 Syrian refineries are designed to operate on a blend of
 domestic heavy crude and imported light crude but
 operate more efficiently on straight light crude. Ac-
 cording to the US Embassy, the Syrian oil trade
 deficit was about $200 million in 1984 and probably
 larger in 1985, mainly as a result of the declining
 volume of crude exports.
 Exports are depressed because of lower prices and
 stagnant production. Revenues from oil exports fell
 from over $1.3 billion in 1980 to less than $900
 million in 1985. The official price for Syrian crude
 was steady through 1985 but fell dramatically in
 February after Damascus reluctantly introduced
 "netback" pricing, which ties the crude sales price to
 the value of refined product. The fall in exports has
 been aggravated by erratic Iranian deliveries. Exports
 fell in 1985 by at least 20,000 b/d as the Syrians were
 forced to divert export oil for domestic use. If the
 increase in Thayyem production is unexpectedly de-
 layed until 1987, we estimate this year's exports of
 crude could provide less than $400 million.

 Imports of crude oil and products represent a growing
 share of Damascus' hard currency imports. Syria's
 primary supplier, Iran, has pressed Damascus for
 prompt payment and often suspended deliveries. Ac-
 cording to press reports, periodic cutoffs this year
 have forced purchases of 50,000 b/d of light crude on
 the Mediterranean spot market. These purchases have
 almost exhausted Syrian foreign exchange reserves
 and probably underscored for Assad his growing
 economic isolation.
 Although Damascus has granted several exploration
 and drilling concessions to foreign firms since 1974,
 these firms failed to find any major new fields until
 the recent Thayyem discovery. After peaking in 1976
 at 200,000 b/d, current Syrian oil production has
 slipped to 185,000 b/d,

 on concessional oil shipments. Since Damascus broke

 production goals will be met on schedule. We estimate
 the low-gravity, low-sulfur Thayyem crude will re-
 duce imports by about 40 percent over the next year.

 Syrian nonpayment of its debt and Iranian intransi-
 gence on additional price concessions have strained
 relations and resulted in periodic cutoffs of Iranian
 deliveries. Last year's oil imports from Iran totaled
 less than 75 percent of the contract amount
 Moreover, Syrian
 tankers loaded with Iranian oil have been targets of
 Iraqi attacks twice in 1986, further disrupting crucial
 imports. We estimate 1986 deliveries of Iranian oil at
 approximately 6.5 million barrels. The oil link to
 Iran has been weak since the outset of the relation-
 ship in 1982. Deliveries have continued, albeit at
 progressively lower levels, despite Syria's consistently
 poor payment record.
 Domestic consumption of petroleum products has
 doubled since 1975. We estimate current demand for
 petroleum products is 150,000 to 190,000 b/d and
 growing more than 10 percent annually. Military and
 industrial demand as well as price subsidies have
 fostered high consumption of several products. Syria
 is only partly meeting current domestic demand for oil
 products. The government in late 1985 announced
 much-needed price increases for most petroleum prod-
 ucts to curb demand and reflect actual costs. Accord-
 ing to Embassy reporting, rationing of some oil prod-
 ucts began in February, and electricity is shut off in
 Because Damascus has exercised its option to use the
 lighter Thayyem crude domestically, total oil exports
 may actually fall as Syria compensates Pecten with
 heavier Suwaydiyah crude on a value equivalent basis.
 While the current market prices for the two grades of
 crude are very close, light grades generally are higher
 priced. Pecten's share could increase by up to 20
 percent when prices rebound, cutting further into

 The US Embassy reports the IMF has delayed action on Ecuador's request for

 Japanese citizens from vacationing in South Africa. Japan, which has been
 criticized for not being more active in the international arena, probably believes
 that the United States and the United Kingdom will soon take strong measures. It
 does not want to appear reluctant to participate. The proposed sanctions would cut
 Japan's purchases from South Africa in half. Past sanctions, which included a
 longstanding ban on direct investment in South Africa and limits on computer

 Foreign Aerospace Plane  Western Europe and Japan are debating development of completely reusable space
 Development Programs     launch systems. The United Kingdom is proposing HOTOL, a horizontal-take-off-
 and-landing launcher, which would use a combination of air-breathing and rocket
 propulsion. The British contend that HOTOL would lower launch costs by 50
 percent for geostationary orbit and 80 percent for low-Earth orbit. Recognizing
 they could never fund the projected $6 billion development alone, Britain is
 attempting to compete with Hermes-the French-proposed, rocket-launched,
 spaceplane-for European Space Agency support. The West German Research
 Ministry is also considering HOTOL participation. In addition, the West Germans
 are developing the Saenger, a two-stage spaceplane with a recoverable air-
 breathing booster. For their part, the Japanese are exploring technologies for an
 advanced air-breathing hypersonic engine, but have not committed to a develop-
 ment program. Although none of the foreign efforts are as far advanced as those of
 the United States, there may be an opportunity for cooperation to speed the
 technology development and lower US development costs.

 Creating Problems
 The
 decision is sure to anger Tokyo, because Ottawa is demanding that Japan allow
 only a slight increase in auto exports despite substantial investments in Canada
 made by Japanese carmakers in the past year. Moreover, Ottawa is likely to
 further aggravate the situation by supporting Suzuki's request that Tokyo grant it
 the majority of the eventual increase in the Japanese quota. Suzuki claims that it

 Extended               the major factors that have prompted Madrid to extend an industrial restructuring
 program. The program-originally expected to cost $6.7 billion during 1984-86-
 aimed at enhancing export competitiveness and bolstering the finances of sunset
 industries by trimming surplus labor, closing inefficient plants, and modernizing
 production. According to press reports, Madrid believes that further gains are
 necessary, and it intends to spend an additional $1 billion during 1987-88 to
 support investments in equipment, restructure debts, and lay off additional
 workers. We expect most of this effort will be directed at the steel and shipbuilding
 sectors. Madrid must reduce crude steel capacity by 3 million tons under the terms
 of its EC accession agreement, and Spanish steel firms are demanding that the
 government finance layoffs of another 10,000 to 20,000 workers. Worldwide
 surplus capacity and slack demand will probably lead to sharp cuts in shipyard ca-
 pacity and employment.
 Greek Parliament     The Greek Parliament last month fulfilled a longstanding commitment to the EC

 had requested three delays, but finally committed itself to implementing the tax as
 part of a deal to receive a $1.5 billion balance-of-payments loan from the EC last
 November. The VAT will replace 10 of 24 existing indirect taxes. It will have
 three rates-averaging about 10 percent-and will cover all goods and services
 except banking and insurance; banking services will become taxable in 1989.
 Athens probably hopes that the VAT, coupled with the tougher enforcement
 measures adopted earlier this year, will reduce widespread tax evasion and help de-
 crease the budget deficit, which hit a record last year. Government estimates
 indicate, however, that the tax will raise only about $3 billion-or approximately
 the same amount that would have been raised by the indirect taxes that are being
 abolished.

 can get foreign technology from other neutrals and through secret trade with
 Western countries. He acknowledged the embargo causes delays and provides an

 freeze for many items, were enacted in June. More recently, the government
 announced new sanctions against violators of price controls, including threats of
 dismissal and prison sentences for managers. In recent weeks, however, implemen-
 tation of its price policy program has been marked by indecisiveness and
 disorganization. The willingness and ability of Premier Mikulic's government to
 hold the line on price controls could become a test of its ability to implement its
 broad economic recovery program. While the government can probably count on
 modest support from the Communist Party, it will be forced to balance public
 demands for price stability against increasing pressures from industrial organiza-
 tions to relax price restrictions and threats from producers to undermine price
 policies.
 Chinese             China appears to be on the verge of implementing a nationwide labor reform
 Labor Reforms       package aimed at gradually replacing the centralized system of assigned jobs and
 lifetime tenure with fixed-term contracts. In late June, the China began a 105-day
 suspension of new hiring and transfers in state-owned offices and factories,
 according to a credible Hong Kong newspaper account. The report, citing an
 internal Chinese Communist Party document, also disclosed that the state will
 provide temporary unemployment insurance to contract workers who lose their
 jobs under the new system. By making it easier for mangement to release
 employees, these reforms are aimed at raising enterprise productivity and market
 responsiveness, and cutting back the number of redundant workers. A Hong Kong
 press report in May suggested that, during the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90),
 Beijing hopes to trim "surplus" employment in state enterprises by 15 million
 workers, out of a total of 86 million employees in the sector. The Chinese press has
 recently expressed concern about finding new jobs for these workers, many of
 whom they hope will be absorbed into collective and private-sector jobs.

 CAAC Faces Down       The Director General of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), Hu
 Kickback Scandal       Yizhou, recently told foreign aviation officials in Beijing that they must take
 "drastic actions" to help halt recurrent rumors of bribes and kickbacks from
 foreign aviation companies. Foreign commercial aviation officials have vehemently
 denied stories that Hu's predecessor accepted bribes on foreign aircraft sales to
 China, but a CAAC official's evasion of a reporter's question during a May 1986
 press conference has fueled the gossip. Despite persistent rumors of his arrest, US
 Embassy officials say the former director was conspicuously present during the
 May 1986 Aerospace Exhibition in Beijing-a move some CAAC officials
 speculated was designed to squelch these reports. In response to Hu's plea, State
 Planning Commission Vice Minister Gan Ziyu has agreed to meet with represen-
 tatives of foreign firms to offer suggestions on how to convey their concerns to the
 State Council. US diplomatic officials note that one US aviation corporate head
 has already written to Deng Xiaoping personally, assuring him of his company's
 innocence and expressing concern over the possible long-term damage that could
 be done to Sino-US commercial aviation relations.
 China Stages           China is holding a three-week trade exhibition in the Soviet Union-its first since
 Trade Fair             1953-featuring more than 4,000 industrial, consumer, and military items,
 in Moscow              including a model of China's Long March-3 rocket, satellites, computers, televi-
 sions, textiles, and handicrafts. Although the show has not yet resulted in any
 contracts, it has drawn considerable press attention in both countries, and has
 attracted more than 20,000 visitors daily. According to US Embassy reporting, the
 Soviets have played up the exhibit-highlighting the countries' common interest in
 "socialist construction"-as part of Moscow's recent overtures to Beijing: Premier
 Ryzhkov paid a visit the day of Gorbachev's Vladivostok speech. The Chinese
 exhibit appears designed to publicize China's economic growth, according to the
 Embassy; Chinese press accounts have reported the Soviets' interest in "the vitality
 of China's economy as reflected in the exhibits." At the opening of the fair, the
 two countries signed a protocol on exchanges of trade exhibitions through 1990.
 According to Chinese customs statistics, trade between the two countries more
 than doubled last year over 1984 levels, to nearly $2 billion.
