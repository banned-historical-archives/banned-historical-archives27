 Disgruntlement over austerity measures and rumors of coup plotting
 are increasing, but in our view Chairman Mengistu is still in control.
 His problems with the economy and the military nevertheless are
 likely to increase.
 A report on the country's monetary system issued last month by a
 government commission calls for a strengthened role for the Reserve
 Bank in fighting inflation and charting economic growth. The
 recommended reforms made to date on a piecemeal basis, however,
 have been offset by the declining exchange rate of the rand, which
 has not only accelerated inflation but spurred domestic criticism of
 government economic management.
 Growing domestic unrest in Djibouti-unless kept in check by more
 vigorous leadership by President Gouled-may provide Libya with
 attractive opportunities to improve its position in the Horn of Africa.
 The government of President Abdallah faces a variety of economic
 and political challenges resulting from the Comoros's colonial
 legacy, geographic limitations, postindependence power struggles,
 and his autocratic style of rule.

 Ethiopia:
 Mengistu Still in Charge
 25X1
 disgruntlement over
 austerity measures and rumors of coup plotting are
 increasing in Ethiopia. In our view, however,
 Chairman Mengistu is still in control, although his
 problems are likely to increase soon. Addis Ababa
 thus far has been able to shield key urban and
 military constituencies from the worst effects of
 drought and continued fighting. F__1  25X1
 his rule.
 The Embassy reports that the outlook for economic
 recovery remains bleak. We believe the government
 probably will be forced to impose further austerity
 over the next several months that will irritate the
 urban and military sectors. The Army has fared
 poorly in its latest campaign against the northern
 insurgencies, which is likely to put renewed pressure
 on Mengistu. In our judgment, however, Mengistu
 will be able to endure for some time by placating
 influential groups as much as possible and by relying
 on his pervasive security service to contain threats to
 New Challenges
 Economic austerity measures were extended last
 March to the military and officers of the security
 service for the first time since Mengistu consolidated
 power in 1977. Mengistu has tempered the impact of
 these measures-which include gasoline rationing,
 elimination of free housing and access to special
 stores, and an end to free use of government cars-by
 promoting a large number of officers and increasing
 their pay, according to US Embassy reporting. We
 believe that Mengistu is trying to demonstrate to the
 military that it retains special status, despite the
 cutback in privileges.                 25X1
 Defeats at the hands of the northern insurgents may
 take some toll on military morale and support for
 Mengistu, in our view. Addis Ababa began its latest
 campaign against the insurgents last March, but
 unlike previous attempts, it confined operations to
 Tigray Province and Tigrean-inhabited portions of
 Gondar and Welo Provinces, according to the US
 Embassy. The offensive apparently was aimed at
 securing highways and disrupting guerrilla operations
 and logistics. We believe it also was aimed at
 stemming the movement of refugees into Sudan,
 where some guerrilla recruitment and training occur.
 Recent government setbacks, such as in fighting near
 Sekota, indicate that the offensive has bogged down
 and indeed may have emboldened the rebels to
 increase their attacks. The Embassy reports the rebels
 in Eritrea have been successful in several significant
 engagements earlier this month, including assaulting
 the port of Massawa, near Asmara, and Barentu, a
 key to Ethiopia's defensive line.
 We believe the increased fighting will lead to renewed
 pressure on Addis Ababa by those in the military who
 favor a political settlement with the northern
 insurgencies, including partial autonomy for Eritrea.
 Mengistu, nonetheless, remains committed to a
 military solution. The Eritreans have rejected
 anything less than independence for the province.
 Fighting, meanwhile, probably will continue to be
 inconclusive and create additional disgruntlement in
 the Army. We believe Mengistu, as he has done
 previously, would move quickly against anyone
 suspected of antigovernment activities; he might even
 execute dissidents as an example to other troops.
 Although the urban population appears dissatisfied
 over declining economic conditions, the US Embassy
 reports that there are few political channels for
 expressing discontent. The Kebeles, neighborhood
 associations dominated by Mengistu loyalists, have

 erupted recently over economic issues, they have been

 Also in May, our Embassy reported that an angry

 Addis Ababa for moving religious articles from a

 austerity measures have been accepted by the
 populace with little more than grumbling by a handful
 of protesters. We believe the general public remains

 urban middle class. They probably helped to persuade
 Mengistu to develop the Ethiopian Worker's Party,
 established last September for the 10th anniversary of
 the Ethiopian Revolution, as a potential alternative
 power base to the military. Nevertheless, in our
 judgment, the ideologues remain loyal to Mengistu
 and, in any event, probably do not have enough
 military support to seize power. F-I

 South Africa: Implications
 of Monetary Reforms
 The Commission of Inquiry into the Monetary System
 and Monetary Policy of South Africa (the de Kock
 Commission) released its final report last month, more
 than seven years after the body was created. The
 recommendations in the report complement changes
 in South African monetary policies that Gerhard de
 Kock, chairman of the commission and governor of
 the South African Reserve Bank, has been
 implementing on a piecemeal basis since 1979.'
 Besides streamlining monetary policies, changes
 proposed by the commission and already implemented
 in part by de Kock are designed to strengthen the
 Reserve Bank's role in fighting inflation and charting
 economic growth. The impact of the changes de Kock
 has made to date, however, has been offset by the
 declining exchange rate of the South African rand,
 which has not only accelerated inflation but spurred
 domestic criticism of government economic
 management.                      25X1
 Monetary Policy Through Controls
 South Africa during the 1960s and 1970s relied on
 monetary policies that placed direct controls on
 financial outflows and interest rates, and set fixed
 rates of exchange between the rand and other
 currencies by government fiat, according to academic
 studies. These sources note that South Africa had
 suffered sustained private capital losses during the
 late 1950s, which accelerated after the well-
 publicized killing of 69 black protestors by South
 African police at Sharpeville in March 1960. The
 drain on government foreign currency and gold
 reserves sparked by this capital outflow induced
 Pretoria to resort to a sequence of countermeasures.
 In addition to foreign borrowing, Pretoria raised
 interest rates, tightened import controls, increased
 restrictions on foreign currency purchases by South
 African residents, and, finally, extended these foreign
 exchange controls to nonresidents. The last of these
 measures halted the drain on reserves.
 ' The Reserve Bank fills roughly the same role in South Africa as
 the Federal Reserve Bank does in the United States and other
 central banks do in their respective countries. Most of the monetary
 reforms cited in this article have already been implemented by
 The Reserve Bank implements monetary policy
 through its influence over the volume of bank loans
 made, the interest rates charged on those loans, and
 the exchange rate between the rand and other
 currencies. The impact of changes in these variables,
 in turn, affects the purchasing power of consumers
 and investors in the economy, and thus influences
 economic growth, inflation, and the distribution of
 employment and output across South African
 industries. Debt,-financed consumer purchases, such
 as houses, cars, and major appliances, are especially
 sensitive to interest rate changes. Similarly, changes
 in the value of the rand affect the competitiveness of
 domestically produced goods relative to imports.
 The Reserve Bank is relatively independent of
 political processes in the country, but coordinates its
 policies with the government treasury. Bank Governor
 de Kock lists the South African central bank as the
 third most independent in the world, after the US
 Federal Reserve Bank and the West German central
 bank, according to US Embassy reports. Treasury
 and Reserve Bank coordination, however, is
 important because the magnitude and method of
 financing government deficits affect the amount of
 liquidity in the economy and vice versa
 We believe, however, that direct controls also
 prompted some adverse consequences. In our view, the
 prolonged application of foreign exchange restrictions
 removed the natural check on the growth of domestic
 purchasing power and contributed to the rise in
 inflation rates from 10 percent in 1978 to 15 percent
 in 1983. Money that would otherwise have left the
 country for investment abroad added to domestic

 Commission of Inquiry Into the Monetary
 System and Monetary Policy of
 South Africa: A Chronology
 Exchange controls imposed on nonresidents to stem outflow of capital that began after the shootings at
 Sharpeville in March 1960; dual exchange rate introduced, effectively penalizing nonresidents
 withdrawing funds from the country.
 August 1977                   The Commission of Inquiry into the Monetary System and Monetary Policy in South Africa (the de
 Kock Commission) appointed.
 The first interim report of the de Kock Commission is released; recommends moving from fixed
 exchange rate system to exchange rate determined largely by market forces, but managed by the South
 African Reserve Bank through sales and purchases of US dollars.
 March 1980                   Many legal ceilings on interest rates abolished.
 January 1983                   The second interim report of the de Kock Commission released; proposes more market-oriented
 monetary policy.
 February 1983               Government removes exchange controls on nonresidents and relaxes those on residents; ends dual
 exchange rate system.
 Reserve Bank begins paying revenue from gold sales to mining companies in dollars rather than rand to
 encourage the development of private foreign currency markets in South Africa.
 Reserve Bank shifts to paying revenues to mines half in dollars, half in rand in order to increase its
 ability to influence exchange rates.
 Final report of the de Kock Commission released; proposes gradual phasing out of remaining exchange
 controls.
 demand. This induced Pretoria to impose additional
 regulations in a number of unsuccessful attempts to
 stem growing demand. Ceilings on commercial credit,
 for example, were instituted to slow lending. This
 approach failed because politically sensitive interest
 rates, especially those charged to farmers and
 homeowners, were kept artificially low. Moreover, the
 method of subsidizing loans to farmers, which in
 effect treated their debt as an asset against which
 banks could make additional loans, increased
 purchasing power.
 The Market-Oriented Approach
 South African officials, led by Reserve Bank
 Governor Gerhard de Kock, realized that these
 successive layers of monetary controls were increasing
 underlying inflationary pressures, according to press
 reports. As a result, de Kock and other South African
 economists have pushed since the late 1970s for
 removal of government controls so that the economy
 could adjust automatically through interest and
 exchange rate changes to new economic conditions. In
 addition, a drop in Western inflation rates since 1980
 has raised substantially South Africa's inflation rate
 relative to its main trading partners (see figure 2).
 Several important moves toward implementing this
 market-oriented approach were initiated a few years
 ago, beginning with the demise of the fixed exchange
 value of the rand in 1979. After a series of
 devaluations, South Africa gradually moved to a
 "managed float," in which the value of the rand is
 chiefly determined by supply and demand. The
 Reserve Bank purchases and sells US dollars to
 moderate sharp movements in the rand's exchange
 value. Pretoria also has lifted many ceilings on
 interest rates and bank loans. In 1983, Pretoria
 removed exchange controls on nonresidents.

 Gerhard de Kock has served since 1981 as governor of the South African Reserve
 Bank, giving him primary responsibility for policies affecting commercial credit
 and foreign exchange. He had previously served for 10 years as the Reserve
 Bank's senior deputy governor. Regarded in the press as a monetarist who opposes
 nonfiscal economic controls, de Kock strongly favors tight budgetary restraints
 and slower growth of commercial credit as ways to curb South Africa's high
 inflation rate. Although he approves of President Botha's racial reform policies,
 according to US Embassy reporting, de Kock has generally avoided involvement
 in political issues, stressing the bank's independence. Embassy sources note that
 the South African business community holds de Kock in high regard because of
 his economic expertise and strong leadership skills. He has an M.A. degree from
 the University of Pretoria and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard.
 According to press accounts, the final report of the de
 Kock Commission proposes some additional monetary
 reforms:
 ? All interest rates should be market oriented,
 including those charged to homeowners and
 farmers.
 ? Interest paid on home mortgages should not be tax
 deductible.
 ? Special tax benefits enjoyed by savings and loans
 that specialize in mortgages should be eliminated.
 ? Exchange controls on residents should be eased
 further as the balance of payments improves.
 Residents should be given freer access to investment
 opportunities and financial markets abroad.
 ? Monetary policy should be keyed to targets for
 growth of purchasing power. These targets should
 not be rigidly enforced, but should serve as
 guidelines to make monetary policy more consistent.
 25X1
 Under the proposed system, the monetary authorities
 would set 12-month targets for growth of purchasing
 power each February. The primary goal of monetary
 policy would be to slow inflation, but with some
 attention to the short-term impacts on foreign reserve
 holdings and interest, growth, unemployment, and
 exchange rates. According to press accounts,
 President Botha has approved the commission's
 recommendations.2
 Short-Term Economic Effects
 Gradual introduction of de Kock's market-oriented
 approach to monetary policy already has affected
 economic performance. The elimination of the fixed
 exchange rate for the rand has allowed its value to
 float downward from an average of $1.19 in 1979 to
 about 52 cents this past week. Although combating
 inflation had been one of de Kock's goals in
 implementing monetary reforms, in the short term the
 declining value of the rand has raised the cost of
 imports and increased inflation rates (see table,
 "South Africa: Selected Monetary Indicators,
 1966-85").
 3 Although the appointment last week of Chris Stahl as the new
 Director General of Finance has been interpreted by some observers
 in South Africa as a signal that Pretoria will move slowly in
 implementing new monetary reforms, we believe that President
 Botha remains committed to de Kock's market-oriented approach.
 Stahl's earlier objections to some de Kock Commission interim
 recommendations were based on practical considerations rather
 than fundamental differences in approach, according to US
 Embassy reporting.F__~

 Secret
 South African mining companies, nonetheless, have
 benefited from the floating rand. The sharp decline in
 its exchange value has boosted local currency earnings
 on gold sales, more than offsetting the fall since 1980
 in the world gold price. Indeed, whereas the dollar
 price of gold has fallen by 50 percent from its 1980
 average, the rand price has increased by nearly 30
 percent (see table). While the economy as a whole has
 suffered from reduced foreign currency earnings as a
 result of the lower world gold price, the monetary
 reforms have produced profits in the mining industry.
 Increased profits, in our judgment, have made it
 possible for large South African mining companies
 such as Anglo-American Corporation to offer black
 mineworkers higher wages and ease pressures for
 unionization in this vital sector of the economy.
 Despite the benefits enjoyed by the mining sector, not
 all South African companies have gained from the
 floating rand. Record high interest rates have reduced
 consumer borrowing, cutting sales in the automobile
 and construction industries, according to press
 reports. In addition, many South African companies
 misjudged the magnitude of the decline in the rand in
 a floating exchange system, and suffered substantial
 losses, according to industry sources. Companies that
 signed contracts to deliver goods based on production
 costs under one exchange rate, for example, lost
 money when the fall of the rand raised the local prices
 of imported raw materials and intermediate goods.
 25X1
 To provide insurance against this risk, the Reserve
 Bank has encouraged the development of futures
 markets in South Africa for foreign currency by
 making more dollars available to local foreign
 currency traders? Such markets would enable
 companies to fix their exchange rates for future
 purchases of dollars or other foreign currencies.
 Futures markets, which are well established in the
 United States and other Western nations, have the
 added benefit of moderating drastic swings in
 exchange rates, according to academic studies. F_
 ' Previously, the Reserve Bank, as the principal seller of South
 African gold on world markets, had kept the dollars earned from
 gold sales and paid the mining companies their revenues in rand;
 under the current arrangement, half of the gold revenues are paid
 to the mines in dollars with the condition that the companies sell
 these dollars within five days after their receipt. F__1
 De Kock strongly defends the new exchange rate
 policies, according to US Embassy reporting, and
 argues that maintaining the value of the rand at an
 artificially high level as gold prices fell would have
 drained Pretoria's remaining foreign reserves.
 Nevertheless, the Reserve Bank has intervened to
 keep the rand from falling too quickly. De Kock
 justifies this deviation from the new hands-off
 approach by arguing that much of the downward
 pressure on the rand in December 1984 and January
 1985 was the result of the poorly developed futures
 markets. In his view, companies saw the downward
 path of the rand and panicked, selling rand for dollars
 or other foreign currency to cover future imports
 before their rand became even less valuable on world
 markets. This panic selling, in de Kock's opinion,
 added to downward pressures on the rand. The
 currency has stabilized since in the 50 to 55 cents
 range.
 Political Considerations
 The monetary reforms are a bold move politically for
 Pretoria, in our view, and represent a willingness to
 risk some short-term support in exchange for long-
 term economic gain. In common with many elements
 of President Botha's racial reform program, the
 streamlining of monetary policy reflects an ideological
 shift away from the use of government controls to
 solve social and economic problems, and toward
 greater reliance on market forces. Although monetary
 reforms lack the overtly racial considerations involved
 in modifying apartheid laws, much of the potential
 gains from the higher economic growth that de Kock
 envisions will result from monetary reforms would
 accrue to South African blacks, while most of the
 immediate costs of higher interest rates are being
 absorbed by middle-class whites and white farmers,
 two groups that have traditionally supported the
 National Party. In our view, President Botha hopes
 that by accepting the de Kock Commission
 recommendations, the country's economy will have
 sufficiently improved by the time of the next elections
 in 1988 or 1989 to more than offset any political
 damage. Whether or not this gamble pays off will
 depend on consistency with which the new market-
 oriented approach is applied in practice.

 Djibouti-Libya: Keeping
 Qadhafi at Bay
 expense.
 In our view, growing domestic unrest in Djibouti-
 unless kept in check by more vigorous leadership by
 President Hassan Gouled-may provide Libya with
 attractive opportunities to improve its position in the
 Horn of Africa. US Embassy reporting indicates that
 Libya has kept the Gouled regime off balance with an
 array of carrot-and-stick tactics, and has succeeded in
 casting doubt in Djibouti over the depth of French
 commitment to this strategically located nation.
 Should Gouled stumble in meeting the internal
 challenges that lay ahead, we believe Colonel Qadhafi
 may gain increased room for maneuvering at Western
 attempt to keep Qadhafi at arm's length.
 Mixed Signals
 Tripoli's diplomacy of alternating promises and
 threats has placed Djibouti-Libyan relations in a state
 of flux. The US Embassy reports the Gouled regime
 views Qadhafi with a mixture of fear, hope, and
 suspicion. Gouled fears the potential for increased
 Libyan meddling at a time of escalating domestic
 instability, according to the Embassy. At the same
 time, Libya's diplomatic gains with Sudan, Somalia,
 and Morocco have enhanced Qadhafi's stature in the
 eyes of some Djiboutian officials-Foreign Minister
 Moumin among them-and raised hopes for Libyan
 assistance to Djibouti's ailing economy. Although
 dealing with Qadhafi now appears diplomatically
 fashionable in Africa once again, we believe Gouled
 will remain suspicious of Libyan intentions and
 From our perspective, Qadhafi is intent on
 establishing broader influence in Djibouti, with a view
 to enlarging Libya's role in Horn affairs at French
 expense. US Embassy reporting suggests that the
 Libyan leader seeks to drive a wedge between Paris
 and Djibouti by playing on Gouled's fear of isolation
 in the Arab World. In addition, Qadhafi continues to
 court the conservative, pro-Western Gouled to grant
 relay facilities for Radio Tripoli, implying that
 Libyan economic assistance will be forthcoming in
 return. Although the Embassy reports no active
 Libyan aid programs at present, Tripoli recently
 provided Djibouti with a well-equipped maternity
 clinic-as yet unopened-that has become an irritant
 in relations. Embassy officials say Qadhafi is
 withholding operating funds in an attempt to pressure
 Gouled to support Libya in international forums.
 Complementing Tripoli's diplomatic pressure tactics
 are indications of a Libyan campaign to undermine
 the Gouled government.
 Embassy believes Gouled is not eager to affront
 Qadhafi, and could not easily dismiss Libyan
 overtures for improved ties.
 Gouled's Growing Vulnerabilities
 The US Embassy reports that Gouled faces a growing
 list of domestic problems-all vulnerable to
 manipulation by Qadhafi-which threaten the
 regime's stability and may weaken its will to resist
 future Libyan advances. Foremost among these
 problems is a large budget deficit. Faced with severe
 unemployment and an inability to expand
 significantly its stagnant economy-which is based on
 commerce and transit trade with Ethiopia-Djibouti
 must rely heavily on foreign aid at a time when its
 primary benefactors-France and Saudi Arabia-are
 themselves experiencing severe financial difficulties
 and cutting back assistance programs. Gouled's
 budget problems are further aggravated by

 inefficiency, the strain of coping with refugees from

 to deteriorate visibly in recent months.
 The economic collapse has sparked growing domestic
 unrest that periodically erupts in small-scale strikes
 and demonstrations against the government. The US
 Embassy says a malaise among students, unemployed,

 officers has caused the government's public standing

 a key location for the protection of oil routes through

 concerned over potential Libyan meddling, we believe
 the Mitterrand government will continue its policy of
 gradually reducing direct budgetary support to
 Djibouti-a policy that has reduced French aid by
 half since 1980 to its present level of about $8.6
 million per year. According to the US Embassy,
 France is looking for ways to share the burden of
 support for Djibouti with more Western and moderate
 Arab states, citing budgetary austerity, its
 commitment to Chad, and the negative impact of a
 strong US dollar on the French franc.
 and gaining needed economic assistance.
 While seemingly committed to reducing its economic
 aid to Djibouti, US Embassy reporting indicates that
 Paris has sought to reassure Gouled that its 4,800-
 man military contingent will be kept in place. Under
 the Franco-Djiboutian treaty, Paris is obligated to
 defend the country against external aggression. The
 French military presence and spending by French
 soldiers are important to the local economy. We
 believe Gouled will forgo dramatic gestures toward
 improving relations with Qadhafi as long as France
 maintains its troops there. Should Gouled fail to
 secure reliable aid sources to compensate for
 reductions in French support, however, the pressure of
 looming budget shortfalls and fear of the instability
 they could engender may induce him to move closer to
 Qadhafi in hopes of tempering Libyan adventurism
 Prospects
 In our view, Djibouti is entering an increasingly           25X1
 unstable period in which Gouled's leadership abilities
 will be severely tested. Gathering social tensions,
 chronic economic distress, and passive allies threaten
 to open opportunities for Libya. Recent diplomatic
 successes have bolstered Qadhafi's credibility and lent
 momentum to those in Gouled's regime who favor
 warmer ties with Libya. We believe the potential
 exists for an upgrading of ties, but much depends on
 Qadhafi's diplomatic skill and how desperate Gouled
 may become. We believe Qadhafi's hand has never
 been stronger, and if he cannot entice Gouled with
 diplomacy and promises of economic aid, the Libyan
 leader will not hesitate to increase attempts to
 destabilize Gouled's regime.
 Gouled's future almost certainly depends on
 supplementing-or restoring-French economic and
 military commitment to Djibouti, in our judgment.
 Although Gouled is eager to expand economic ties
 with moderate Persian Gulf states and the West-
 particularly the United States-we believe most
 nations are waiting for France to take the lead. For its
 part, France may feel its still vital economic and
 military role will be enough to sustain French
 influence in the post-Gouled period, no matter how
 radical his successors. In the event of a coup against
 Gouled, we believe France would act only to protect
 its nationals, and take its chances with the successor
 regime. Meanwhile, the Mitterrand government
 probably will continue its gradual economic
 withdrawal-trying to encourage a greater US aid
 role-while upholding its military commitment to
 Djibouti for the foreseeable future.
 We believe Gouled's odds of holding on are slightly
 better than even. A more vigorous leadership role--
 Gouled has a reputation for muddling through-and a
 reassertion of government authority would go far in
 enhancing his prospects. The US Embassy reports
 Gouled has recently begun to show some political
 muscle in an attempt to crack down on corruption and
 stanch the erosion of public confidence in his
 government. In addition, Gouled's political survival
 will hinge on how shrewdly he manages the balancing

 act between rival interests in Djibouti-Issa and Afar,
 French and Libyan, Ethiopian and Somali. Should
 domestic unrest boil over, however, an anti-Western

 would clear the way for more direct Libyan
 involvement.

 Comoros: Ten Years of
 Independence
 The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros faces
 an uncertain future as it celebrates 10 years of
 independence this month. Ahmed Abdallah
 Abderemane is serving his second and final
 six-year term as President under the constitution he
 promulgated in 1978. He faces a variety of
 economic and political challenges resulting from the
 Comoros's colonial legacy, geographic limitations,
 postindependence power struggles, and his
 autocratic style of rule.F____-]       25X1
 Historical Setting
 A variety of cultures influence social and political
 development of the islands in the Comoran
 archipelago-Grand Comore, Moheli, Anjouan, and
 Mayotte. In the 15th century, Shirazi Arab traders
 established sultanates in the islands, and introduced
 Sunni Islam to what has now become a largely mixed
 Afro-Arab population. Moheli and Mayotte, however,
 eventually fell under the domination of the large
 island state of Madagascar which plundered the
 islands' population in slaving raids. The first
 significant European presence in the islands was
 established in the mid-19th century when
 Madagascar ceded Mayotte to France.
 descendant from the French.
 Despite longstanding interisland rivalries among the
 ruling Shirazi elite, the Comoran sultanates were
 united by France into part of a larger colony with
 Madagascar after that island had become a French
 protectorate in the late 19th century. The center of
 colonial administration for Comoros remained at
 Mayotte, which offered the best natural port facilities,
 until the French bowed to pressure from the ruling
 elites on the other islands and shifted the capital in
 1962 to Moroni on Grand Comore. Mayotte, however,
 retained close cultural ties with France because,
 unlike the other islands, its inhabitants are
 predominately non-Muslim and ethnic Creoles,
 Toward Independence. Comorans voted in a
 referendum in 1958 for continued French rule with
 internal self-government carried under a Council of
 Ministers and a territorial assembly. Despite the
 referendum, expatriate Comorans on the East African
 mainland and several influential families in the
 islands pushed for independence throughout the
 1960s. Abdallah, a conservative politician and
 member of an elite, landowning family from Anjouan,
 assumed the presidency of the Council of Ministers in
 1972 and began to press more vigorously for
 independence. In 1974, a referendum calling for
 independence was supported overwhelmingly by all
 Comorans except a majority of the inhabitants of
 Mayotte. France agreed to grant independence the
 following year but, under pressure from politicians
 from Mayotte, postponed independence pending a
 second island-by-island plebiscite on the issue.
 Abdallah unilaterally declared independence for all
 the islands in July 1975; Mayotte, however, refused to
 acknowledge Comoran sovereignty and continues to
 be administered by France.
 The Radical Years: 1975-78. One month after
 independence, Abdallah's government was toppled by
 mercenaries working for an amorphous and
 opportunistic six-party opposition coalition that
 appointed the radical Ali Soileh as head of state in
 January 1976. Soileh embarked on a harsh rule
 designed to restructure Comoran society by replacing
 many Islamic customs with a "socialist" revolutionary
 ethic. Soileh relied on youth militia brigades-the
 Moissy-to deter internal opposition through a
 campaign of terror and violence. Popular discontent
 grew as Soileh broke with Comoran traditions and his
 socialist policies accelerated economic decline. In
 May 1978, Abdallah returned to power after
 financing a coup led by the well-known mercenary
 Bob Denard and many of the same mercenaries who
 had deposed him two years before.
 The Second Abdallah Regime
 US Embassy reporting indicates that Abdallah has
 attempted to keep Comoros on a moderate political
 course since his return to power. Press reports suggest

 that, despite the taint of his mercenary-backed
 regime, Comorans prefer Abdallah's comparatively
 benign one-party rule to that of the repressive Soileh
 largely because he quickly restored Comoran Islamic
 traditions. Endemic rumors of plotting and coup
 attempts, however, indicate Abdallah's hold on power
 is not firm. In our view, the President must surmount
 a variety of economic and political challenges if he is
 to survive over the next few years.
 25X1
 Economy in Disarray. Comoros's geographic
 limitations clearly have been a significant deterrent to
 economic growth. The US Embassy reports that the
 islands have no known mineral resources; the
 surrounding coastal waters cannot sustain exploitable
 fisheries because the continental shelf is too narrow;
 the rocky coastlines contain no natural deep water
 harbors; and water shortages occur on the most
 populated island, Grand Comore, because the porous
 volcanic soil can not sustain surface streams year-
 round. In addition, according to Embassy reporting,
 the population is growing at about 3 percent annually,
 faster than food production can increase and
 threatening to overwhelm existing social services.
 25X1
 In our view, government policies have done little to
 diversify the economy and to expand food production.
 The regime relies on a plantation-system economy,
 established under French rule, which monopolizes a
 majority of what little arable land is available to
 produce vanilla, copra, spices, and perfume essence
 for export. Cash crops accounted for 99 percent of the
 government's foreign exchange earnings in 1984, but
 the value of exports has declined in recent years
 because of reduced world market demand. The US
 Embassy reports that agriculture also suffers from
 extensive soil overworking and the primitive farming
 techniques practiced by village farmers, who take
 advantage of ambiguous sharecropping regulations to
 encroach on the cash-crop estates and plant
 subsistence food crops, according to Embassy
 In our view, the Abdallah regime is becoming
 excessively dependent on foreign loans for both
 balance-of-payments support and development
 schemes. US Embassy statistics indicate that growing
 foreign indebtedness has boosted public debt from 38
 percent of GDP in 1980 to 116 percent of GDP in
 1984. Increased amounts of foreign exchange reserves
 are being spent on food imports. Embassy officials say
 that the growing current account deficit-21 percent
 of GDP by yearend 1984-is becoming a major
 problem. This year the regime briefly attempted to
 economize by eliminating the military's meat ration
 and halting salary payments to teachers and civil
 servants until France provided some emergency funds,
 according to the Embassy.
 Foreign Relations. US Embassy reporting indicates
 that Abdallah consistently has pursued a staunch pro-
 Western foreign policy. He has sought to expand on
 traditional ties with France and moderate Arab
 states, and to strengthen relations with the United
 States. Embassy officials say that the President, for
 example, repeatedly has pressed the United States
 and France to accept his longstanding offer to
 establish military facilities in Comoros. He also has
 moved to improve cool relations with neighboring left-
 leaning Mozambique and Madagascar, and he has
 established better informal commercial relations with
 Pretoria.
 Abdallah has rebuffed most Soviet efforts to
 strengthen relations because, according to US
 Embassy officials, he believes that Islam and
 Communism are incompatible. Moscow most likely
 seeks access to local port and air facilities, although

 such access probably is not vital to limited Soviet
 operations in the region. Late last summer, however,
 the President accepted a Soviet offer of 13
 scholarships, a gesture we believe was designed to
 convey to the West his displeasure with aid levels, and
 to indicate that he has alternative sources of support.
 25X1
 Abdallah almost certainly views maintaining
 reasonably good relations with France as essential to
 the survival of his regime. France provides the
 majority of Western economic development assistance
 and almost all balance-of-payments support as well as
 limited security aid. Bilateral relations, however, are
 not entirely smooth, according to US Embassy
 reporting. Abdallah most likely resents France's
 repeated withholding of assistance funds because of
 poor Comoran fiscal accountability. F__1  25X1
 islands will depress Mayotte's economy.
 The US Embassy reports that relations with France
 also are strained by Abdallah's persistent accusations
 that Paris is deliberately delaying measures to bring
 French-administered Mayotte under Comoran rule.
 France has a garrison of foreign legionnaires and a
 small naval facility on Mayotte. A second referendum
 to decide Mayotte's future is tentatively scheduled for
 later this year. In our view, Abdallah seeks to
 integrate Mayotte not only for nationalistic reasons,
 but also because Mayotte is the most prosperous and
 developed island in the archipelago. Embassy
 reporting suggests Abdallah still faces strong
 opposition to unification from the island's inhabitants,
 who are fearful integration with the other, poorer
 state.
 Internal Dynamics. Abdallah has consistently sought
 to suppress all political opposition since his return to
 power. His political party, the Comoran Union for
 Progress, was made the country's sole legal party in
 1982. We believe that Abdallah amended the
 Constitution two years later to undermine the
 influence of political rivals. He abolished the post of
 Prime Minister and altered the succession procedure
 probably to ensure that the designated successor-
 longtime rival Mohamed Taki-could not assume
 power. Last January, the President consolidated his
 authority further by shuffling the Cabinet and
 reducing four rivals to coequal status as ministers of
 We believe, on the basis of US Embassy reporting,
 that, although Abdallah's political rivals lack
 sufficient national stature to successfully challenge
 his hold on power, the President's maneuverings have
 not completely eliminated opportunities for his
 opponents to destabilize the regime.-For example,
 press reports suggest that Taki, now residing in
 France, may be garnering influence with a small but
 vocal group of exiled oppositionists and possibly also
 with French elements opposed to Abdallah's recent
 openings toward South Africa. We know little about
 internal civilian opposition to Abdallah, other than
 that it probably is fragmented and espouses a leftist
 ideology.
 In our view, the military poses the greatest threat to
 Abdallah's rule. The President has attempted to
 minimize military coup plotting by dispersing the
 military and gendarmerie throughout the three
 islands. However, US Embassy reporting suggests
 that disgruntlement in the military is growing over
 Abdallah's preferential treatment of his personal
 protection unit, the white mercenary-led presidential
 guard. A narrowly averted coup last March by
 disgruntled Comoran members of the unit, however,
 underscores
 the President has
 responded to the coup attempt by doubling the
 number of white mercenaries in the guard to 50.
 Short-Term Outlook
 Abdallah will have to tread carefully so long as
 military frustration continues over his apparent
 favoritism toward the presidential guard and the
 white mercenaries. In our view, there is a reasonable
 chance that elements in the military may attempt to
 move against the regime again, but we believe that
 any coup plots probably would be thwarted by the
 upgraded mercenary contingent. In our judgment,
 however, the mercenaries themselves could become a
 source of new difficulties for Abdallah. US Embassy
 reporting suggests that the white leadership is
 splitting into two discernible factions: an older
 element oriented politically toward South Africa and
 seemingly loyal to Bob Denard, and a younger, less

 experienced group amenable to French interests and
 loyal to the guard commander, a Belgian mercenary
 known as "Commander Charles."
 The economic picture will remain, in our view, bleak,
 and Comoros's geographic limitations, shortsighted
 economic policies, and history of poor fiscal
 management suggest that the islands will be
 dependent on foreign largesse for the foreseeable
 future. From our perspective, Abdallah almost
 certainly will avoid provoking a cutoff in French
 financial assistance, so he probably will not go beyond
 rhetoric designed mainly for domestic political
 consumption in pressing France for the integration of
 Mayotte. Abdallah most likely will seek increased aid
 from the United States following the scheduled
 opening of the US Embassy in Moroni this August.
 We believe that cool relations with the Soviet Union
 are unlikely to improve appreciably over the near
 term. The Soviet Union appears unwilling to provide
 Abdallah with the levels of economic assistance
 Comoros requires, and Abdallah probably would
 refuse Soviet enticements of military assistance. In
 our view, however, relations with Moscow could
 improve should Abdallah, who is in his mid-60s, die
 while in office. We believe there is a chance
 succession provisions could be ignored and that any
 ensuing power struggle would hold uncertain
 prospects for pro-West elements. Similarly, a
 successful coup could bring to power elements
 inclined to move closer to Moscow.

 Briefs
 French drug enforcement officials are working with authorities in Benin and Togo
 to curb traffic of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana, primarily to France and the
 United States. The investigation reportedly indicates that large quantities of
 heroin and cocaine are arriving in Cotonou, Lome, and Accra from a network
 operating through Lagos.                           the narcotics-heroin
 from Pakistan and cocaine from Latin America-are flown into Lagos, smuggled
 into Cotonou, and then concealed in the luggage of Beninese who are flying to
 Paris. The narcotics are often transported by women, who are believed less likely
 to arouse suspicion. Money is exchanged in Paris, after which the drugs are again
 concealed and flown to the United States. The Embassy estimates that the total
 volume of narcotics involved is substantial given the number of people believed to
 be taking part.
 Over the past year, several hundred kilograms per month of marijuana, which is
 grown in substantial amounts in Benin's northern mountainous region, have
 reached Paris from Cotonou,                          The marijuana is often
 shipped as unaccompanied baggage, labeled fruits and vegetables. The quantities
 involved and the method of shipping suggest the complicity of the local airlines, as
 well as customs and immigration officials. The Beninese Ministry of Interior has
 issued instructions to transfer all customs and immigration officials at Cotonou
 Airport to other locations. Embassy officials, however, believe that the move will
 bring only temporary improvement because of widespread corruption within these
 services.
 Beninese and Togolese police authorities are
 cooperating. Both countries have accepted a French offer to train security officials
 on drug control techniques. Beninese police arrested members of two of the four
 drug-smuggling operations known to be operating through Cotonou, but members
 of a third operation escaped to Ghana. A fourth ring of both French and Beninese
 traffickers continues to operate                        So far, no attempt
 has been made to obtain help from Nigeria because
 the Nigerian security services are too corrupt to permit an effective investigation.
 Public discontent, especially among student and labor groups, over economic
 reforms imposed by President Kerekou has increased sharply, according to the US
 Embassy. Kerekou's decision to halt guaranteed government employment for all
 university graduates prompted student strikes in April and May.

 Kerekou responded harshly by closing schools and ordering police and security
 forces to shoot demonstrators on sight. He dismissed Minister of Higher
 Education, Col. Michel Alladaye, who was a principle instigator of the October
 1972 coup that brought Kerekou to power.
 The schools reopened last month without incident, but we believe that additional
 austerity measures could provoke more unrest. In our view, further turmoil may
 encourage hardcore leftists in the military to seek Libyan or Soviet backing to
 overthrow Kerekou. Kerekou has turned to the West in the past several years in
 search of economic aid, and the Libyans and Soviets probably would be eager to
 lend support to coup plotters in an effort to restore formerly close ties to Benin.
 South Africa             Controversial Anglican Synod
 South Africa's predominantly nonwhite Anglican Church passed a series of
 controversial resolutions at its triennial synod in July that may prompt a split in
 the 1.5 million-member church, according to the US Embassy. The church
 formally condemned several recent government measures to counter black unrest,
 including the growing number of detentions and deaths and the unexplained
 disappearances of black activists. In addition, the synod sent telegrams to senior
 government officials requesting an inquiry into police and military activities in the
 townships. The Anglican Church belongs to the multiracial, interdenominational
 South African Council of Churches, which demanded last month that President
 P. W. Botha immediately withdraw the army and riot police from black townships,
 charging that security forces were actually responsible for much of the violence.
 Whites, who make up about 20 percent of the Anglicans but provide more than 70
 percent of church funds, probably will react to these decisions by the nonwhite
 majority by reducing contributions and perhaps leaving the church.

 conflict may spill over into Malawi.
 Despite economic constraints, Malawi recently began a military buildup that
 apparently is prompted by concern over the worsening security situation in
 neighboring Mozambique. Malawian exports and imports transiting Mozambique
 continue to be disrupted by the Mozambican rebels, and Lilongwe is unable to stop
 the insurgents from using its territory for safehaven. An influx of Mozambican
 refugees and worsening violence in border areas have increased prospects that the

 training on the Elands in July, we believe additional purchases of South African
 arms, including more Elands, are likely only if the South Africans continue to
 offer competitive financing. The one-year-old militia has been expanded to 1,200
 men, and has established regional commanders and regular training and pay
