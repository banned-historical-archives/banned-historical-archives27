 undoubtedly designed to continue the Soviet policy of creating confusion

 Republic desires "unification" of the peninsula: despite 135 occupation of
 the southern zone.
 Peoples' Cown.ttees were organized throughout Korea at the time of
 Japans collapse and were designed to farm the basis of an indigenous

 USSR-occupied Korea, were recognized and utilized as the structure upon
 which.to base the C    iet regime,  In US-occupied Korea, however, the
 Committees were ordered to disperse and ill will against the US resulted.
 At present, the Republic of Korea fills nearly all such local offices by
 appointment and has no immediate plans for local election,  Southern
 Koreans still have fond memories of their dispersed Peoples, Committees
 and nationalistic pride may well be aroused bar an effort to revive this

 meeting with his ministers.  In calling for redoubled'ei'forts to achieve

 is emerging in increasing nuribers to assist Government forces in the
 fighting, particularly in and arround to iaportant port of Bassein and
 at Ins?in, 10 miles north of Rangoon.  It seems like p thwa;, simile' action

 Secondly, Lt. Gen,, Smith Dun, Burmese Commander-in-Chief  has left
 Rangoon for Kalaw, in Northern Burma, ostensibly on sick leave,,  Smith
 Dun, a Karen, has been replaced by Bo Ne ?`lip, a Burman and Left-"ling
 Socialist, Smith Dunts departure will probably cause further Karen
 desertions from the Burmese Arn r.  Both these developments make the
 possibility of a general, amicable settlement between Karens and Burmans
 increasingly remote.

 Dutch resent new plan.  A new scheme for the transfer of Netherlands
 sovereignty to an Indonesian federation is currently scheduled for dis-
 cussion on the Island of Bangka.  The all-Indonesian meeting is supposed
 to include Republican President Soekarno, Premier Hatta and a delegation
 of Federalists,  If the Bangka conference accepts the Dutch plan (Neth-
 erlands relinquishment of sovereignty within two months to a "Republic
 of the United States of Indonesia"), both Dutch and Security Council
 timetables for elections and the granting of sovereignty would be con-
 siderably accelerated.
 Republican leaders, however, view the plan with skepticism, regard-
 ing it as a Dutch device to circumvent the 28 January TIN resolution.
 Until recently, they have declined to participate, as individuals, in
 discussions with the Federalists, but have insisted that they be recog-
 nized as representatives of a reconstituted Republican Governments
 The Federalists, through whom the Dutch have attempted to win Repub-
 lican support, have shown an unexpected independence of their own,  They
 have been reluctant to condemn the latest SC resolution and to commit
 themselves to ar{r specific course of- action.  Mile certain of the Fed-
 eralists are avowedly pro-Republican, the great majority are anxious to
 stall without committing themselves until it is clear that either the
 Dutch or the Republicans will retain the balance of power in Indonesia.

 LI Taung :lent s continuing efforts to negotiate peace with the Com-       "Br

 to the Communists' intransigence, there is a growing split within the

 fight on if honorable peace negotiations fail.  The Cabinet, which has

 advantage to continue negotiations. few Nationalist officials are likely

 Sinkjan  to become Soviet buffer.  Soviet Ambassador Roshchin's
 Transfer to  anton, and CHANG  hih-chung's mission to Tihua, may be
 related in a Soviet maneuver aimed at consolidating Soviet control in
 Sinkiang, thereby realizing a strategic security objective of the 'JR,.
 For the past year Roshchin has been identified with the prospect;
 of Soviet mediation in the Chinese civil war::.  Last month, when the
 USSR formally declined to mediate, Soviet sources confirmed reports
 that Roshchin would leave presently for Moscow,  Last week, however,,
 Roshchin followed the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Canton,
 the only Ambassador to do so.  It is perhaps implied thereby that Roshchinhs
 mediation mission also remains, or that the USSR desires the Chinese
 Government to believe that  Soviet mediation is still possible.  More-
 over, the Chinese Government organs now in Canton are the proper
 authorities for ratifying international agreements.
 It is probable that the USSR does not desire a strong China . even
 a Communist China - on the Soviet borders, and therefore is seeking
 to form a buffer area through Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, and Sinkiang.
 The Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945 provided for a strong Soviet position in
 Manchuria; although MAO Tse-tung stated publicly his desire that Outer
 Mongolia be restored to China,, that area became a Soviet satellite, and
 may draw Inner Mongolia into its orbit; and now the Soviet position in
 Sinkiang should be greatly strengthened by the "local agreement" which
 CHANG has gone to Tihua. to negotiates
 The agreement reportedly would grant the Soviet Union mining, trade
 and aviation monopolies in Sinkiang for the next forty to fifty years.
 The mining monopoly would give the Soviets full rights to exploit Sinkiang's
 little-known resources of oil, wolfram and gold.  Oil deposits in Sinkiang
 are rumored to be sufficient to supply the entire Scviet Per East,
 though this would require many years of development.  the mining monopoly
 would also make possible Soviet exploration to check on unconfirmed
 reports of uranium in Sinkiang.
 A Soviet trade monopoly would provide for exchange of Sinkiang"s
 .raw materials, principally wool, for manufactured goods from the USSR
 In addition there would be a new civil aviation agreement renewing the
 virtual air monopoly held by the USSR under the Sino-Soviet Aviation
 Agreement which was denounced by China last September:,
 CHANG's mission might well prepare the ground for making a Soviet
 satellite not only of all Sinkiang, but perhaps of parts of Ningxia?

 Chinghai, and Kansu.  While the Sinkiang provincial government has long
 .desired resumption of trade with the USSR, the present Chinese Govern-
 ment would seem to have little to gain, in that its life expectancy is
 .certainly not the 40 or 50 years which the Sinkiang pact onvisagea.
 Thus the Chinese Government may be seeking, in return for approval of
 the "local agreement," a leans for preserving its own life: specifically,
 by Soviet mediation in the civil war.  It is improbable that the USSR
 will or can mediate successfully to that end; but the USSR could easily
 promise to attempt it, and Acting President hI Tsung-jen appears sufficiently
 naive and desperate to accept such a promise.
 The Chinese Communist radio has not yet mentioned the Sinkisxig
 negotiations.  Tihua, however, is one of the 16 major centers to,s hick,
 according to the Communists, the Peiping surrender formula will be
 applicable.  Thus the proposed "local agreement." if it were to remove
 Sinkiang from the eventual control of the Chinese Communists, would
 seem to qualify as one of the "traitorous" treaties which the Communists
 have denounced.  It is therefore possible that the USSR and the Chinese
 Comzatnists are plotting this maneuver in concerts i.e., that the USSR
 will promise to attempt mediation, will additionally promise CHANG and the
 Moslem governors of Ningxia  and Chinghai that their authority will be
 preserved, and will then allow the area to pass into Chinese Comoanist
 control.  It seems more likely, however, that the USSR, if not seeking
 direct control of a Northwest 'autonomous" regime, is at least seeking
 a position strong enough to permit the Chinese Communists to enter the
 Northwest only on USSR terms.
 The participants in a Soviet   Nationalist agreement, if the
 Chinese Communists were genuinely excluded from it, would obtain widely
 varying returns: the USSR would get Sinkiang; the Chinese Government
 a sack of wind; O.HANG   a comfortable berth, subject to sudden relocation;
 and the Moslem leaders   continued, although insecure, authority.
 The Chinese Communists would be confronted with a serious dilermma:
 whether to accept in silence this major loss in territory and face, as
 was the case in regard to outer Mongolia, or to denounce the agreement
 and attempt ?- with their increased strength since 1145   to rectify
 it, in which case their relations with their one important international
 friend would be severely compromised.  While a Soviet maneuver in denying
 the Northwest to the Communists or restricting their authorcty therei.n
 would certainly increase the chances for Titoism in Chinas the Soviet
 annexation of the border re4ions would make the fact of Titoism, if
 it does appear in China, less dangerous in its effects upon the USSR,
 Taiwan Governor bids for US su  ort.  In an apparent effort to
 obtain  h good will and support, through ECA and other forms of aid,
 Governor CHEN Cheng has indicated to US officials he intends to develop
 in Taiwan an autonomous, anti-Communist administrratian, which would be
 independent of mainland China.  His known loyalty to CHIANG Kai-shek and

 the latter:s careful preparation to make the island his final stronghold
 belie CHEN's claim that circumstances do not permit CMANG's return to
 power, even in Taiwan,  Moreover., CHEN's ruthless character and his
 previous record in military and provilial administration fail to sub?-
 atantiate his promise of a competent and popular regi.me~  Also interesting
 to note are recent public statements of CHANG Chun in Chungking and
 XSUEU Yueh in Canton, similar to those of the Taiwan Governor, regarding
 the prospect of CHIANG's return.  Alttxaargh these statements may partially
 reflect personal views, it is likely that they constitute maneuvers
 for US aid and may even have ttc; rmcit approval of the Generalissimo.

 would be employed in the defense of that metropolis.  Still another
 report expresses doubt the the bulk of the city's populace wish to see
 that city envolved in any future fighting.  It is probable that the
 great majority of the Nationalists, civil and military alike, have little
 faith in the success of LI Tsung-fen's present pence overtures:.  To
 the north the Communists celebrated their cleanup of North China by
 holding a big "liberation? cele~)ration in which conquering Communist
 forces paraded in ? ,hhe streets of Peiping.  US observers report that the
 armaments of the troops which entered Peiping was predominately Japanese
 with a heavy proportion of automatic weapons, some had US Tommy guns
 caroines, and artillery, the motorized equipment was US made, and that
 the troops themselves, dressed in a conglomeration of uniforms apps read

 Comminists confiscate ECA. food at Tientsin.  The Communist hove
 in abruptly terminaati ng the-Tientsin food ration. program by egonfiscation
 and distribution of ECA flour stocks appears to have been shortsighted.
 The chief repercussion may be as food shortage accompanied by eratic
 prices until the harvest season.  The Communists have not been sufficiently
 aware that feeding the 2-3 million people in Tientsin and its environs
 entails large-scale food imports and an efficient collection and dis?.-
 tribution organization.  Primarily because of ECA. the people of Pei.pi.ngg
 and Tientsin' have become accustomed to a sufficient amount of cheap
 food during the last six months; if the Communists are unable, by transfers

 Local currencies are emerging throughout non-Communist China.  In
 consequence of increasing; economic isolation Hunan Province issued a
 new currency this week called the silver yuan.  At Hank= Pat Chung-hsi
 expressed his disgust with the defunct gold Yuan by authorizing free
 circulation  and bank acceptance) of silver dollars.in Hupeh Province,
 The Taiwan provincial government has banned all remittances of gold Yuan
 from the mainland because of its worthlessness and inflationary effect,
 The 500% depreciation of the gold yuan this week plus the departure of
 most of the Central hank except the currency issuing department for
 Canton will force the emergence of many other local currencies.  The
 possible abandonment of the gold yuan by the Canton refugee governi sent
 is reported by a Hong Kong Coimnuniat newspaper, which claims that a
 "Four United Provinces" currency has been printed in Hong Kong (presumably
 to cover Kwsngtung, Kwangs i , Fukien and Kiangs i) .
 The possibility. cif coastal trade between Slime giai and North Chinet
 developed this week.   The Kailan Minin  Adminictraticri in Cormraunist
 North China has arranged with Central Trust, a subsidiary of the Central
 5inky to exchange 100,000 tons of Kailan coal for 300f,000 bags of
 Shanghai. flour.  Economically, the exchange is ideal since coal is
 plentiful  in  North China and scarce in Shanghai,. and the reverse is
 true of flour  The Kailan Mining Administration has assured the
 ships' entry and clearance at Chinwangtao if they fly only the Kailan
 house flag.
 Shipping circles throughout the Par East are anxiously awaiting
 the reopening of. Communist ports in North China to  orci ;n and coastal
 trade.  The American ship, President Fillmore, has received word from
 Peiping that arrang ents for unloading its carge at Tangku have been
 made.  In face of foreign competitions the Executive Yuan finally approved
 Chinese shipping to Communist destinations.
