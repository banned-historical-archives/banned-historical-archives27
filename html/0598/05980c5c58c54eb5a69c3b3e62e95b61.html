 Gommuntcr'. i Fo? leaMMR:
 Too many people believe and many too many are
 told that what has happened to and in China since
 VJ Day has been and is acceptable to the Chinese peo-
 ple because it is in keeping with their history and
 their traditions.
 As a matter of simple fact, the Chinese are a peo-
 ple who, when "Communism" descended upon them,
 had no history, no tradition and no living experience
 of anything comparable to or resembling the totali-
 tarian system which in and since that year the Com-
 munist Party in China and the government which
 that Party created have imposed upon them.
 The Communist Party in China had grown from
 seeds imported from Moscow in 1920. It had at-
 tempted in 1927 to seize control of the Nationalist
 movement. Thwarted in that effort, it thereafter had
 operated for twenty years as an armed and militant
 -opposition. Finally, after VJ Day, with Soviet moral
 and physical support, it defeated the National Gov-
 ernment in battle after battle, and, in 1949, it set up,
 in Peking (Peiping), a new government, the "Cen-
 tral People's Government of the People's Republic
 of China."
 China was at that moment a Land that had been
 ravaged by warfare during most of more than 20
 years. Its economy was in ruins. Its government
 was overburdened and weary. Most of its people
 and most of its foreign residents and their affiliates
 .were ready to welcome anything in the guise or the
 -orm of a "new deal." And that was what the Com-
 -nunists- blaming for the ills that prevailed, first the
 Nationalists, second the Japanese, and finally all of
 -he foreign powers except the Soviet Union and its
 satellites-promised: a new deal, a great new deal,
 - Utopia.
 What then was Communism? Well, whatever may
 save been the concepts and intentions of the founders,
 -ommunism had become by 1949 a device for despot-
 5m, a system powered by and radiating an ideology,
 n instrument employed and adapted, in each of
 nany countries, by a few leaders and a small per-
 entage of the local population-for acquisition and
 xercise of political control. Incidentally, Yalta had
 bntributed to its having become that.
 The first conspicuous and unmistakable result of
 ie Communist victory in China was' the retreat of
 ze National Government to the island province, Tai-
 -an (Formosa), and the beginning of the new phase
 i which, although China, the country, remains China
 zere are in China two governments each exercizing
 athority over a part of the country and each claim-
 ig to be the government of the whole.
 BY STANLEY K. HORNBECK
 United States Ambassador, Retired
 The government on the mainland, i.e. the Com-
 munist regime, has since 1949 made effective its juris-
 diction over all parts-except only Outer Mongolia
 and Formosa-of what had been in the days of the
 Manchus the Chinese Empire; and it has given this
 domain the first truly totalitarian organization and
 administration that the peoples within its boundaries
 ever have known.
 In the course of eight years plus, it has made of its
 domain a Land wherein the central authorities make
 decisions which, implemented by a huge bureaucracy,
 directly affect almost every aspect of the life and live-
 lihood of the people-men, women and children, in-
 dividually and collectively. With an elaborate system
 of physical and psychological controls, the Party and
 the Government exalt the "state", preach "Commu-
 nism", tolerate no opposition or dissent, and prepare
 the nation for what they call a "Socialist" order.
 At the outset-while establishing order, the new
 rulers for some time showed respect for principles and
 proceedures of justice. But once they were well in
 control they caused all agencies, including the courts,
 to function as instruments of state policy.
 To cause the nation to accept an authoritarian and
 totalitarian regime, the Party and the Government
 set out to impose their own version of the Soviet ver-
 sion of "Communism." So they have made war-hot
 and cold-upon the old culture and its manifestations.
 In that process, they have done their utmost to ex-
 tirpate all religions and all creeds-except the creed
 which they themselves preach. They have persecuted
 priests and teachers. They have expelled or imprison-
 ed missionaries and foreign business men. They have
 forced the closing of foreign diplomatic and related
 establishments.  They have burned and censored
 books. They have liquidated millions of their own
 people. They have enslaved many other millions.
 And, right and left and up and down, they have con-
 fiscated the properties of their victims.
 Early and conspicuous was their carrying out of
 "agrarian reform." First, landlords were denounced.
 Next they were turned over to the populace for
 trial and execution.  Then their lands were di-
 vided among the peasants. Next the peasants were
 taxed, and they soon found the taxes more of a bur-
 den than had been the rentals which they had paid
 before-whereas from the paying of the taxes there
 was and is no way of escape. In that context, and in

 others, the regime has demonstrated strikingly that
 power to tax can indeed be power to destroy.
 While destroying, the new rulers have also created.
 One of their first constructive achievements was that
 of establishing a stable currency. Early, too, was their
 enactment of a new Marriage Law-which greatly
 improved the legal status of women but was very
 damaging, as it was intended to be, to the old social
 order.
 They have emphasized education-Communist ed-
 ucation. Schools, faculties, students, text books and
 their authors and their publishers-all-they have
 brought under government control. They have made
 Russian a second language. They employ Russians-
 some-as instructors in many of the universities. They
 feature, as do the Russians, technical studies.
 In place of the old books, they have published and
 distributed more newly printed matter-officially ap-
 proved, of course-than had ever before been circu-
 lated in China.. Toward teaching, informing and prop-
 agandizing all, and for the illiterate in particular,
 official agencies turn out radio material, place loud-
 speakers on the streets, and distribute vast quantities
 of pictorial material-extending those services even
 to the villages. They have studied-as had their pre-
 decessors-various plans and proposals for either sim-
 plifying the Chinese language or romanizing it or
 both; but they have not thus far put into effect any
 of these.
 Of "Art", Chairman Mao Tse-tung has declared:
 "There is no such thing as art for art's sake"; all
 work should "serve the interests of the workers, peas-
 ants and soldiers.". So-Art, in all its forms, is made
 to conform to official concepts and to serve the pur-
 poses of the State. In that framework, authors and
 artists glorify the laboring man, feature the Commu-
 nist struggle for peace, and with one accord anathe-
 matize the United States.
 In all the fields they have endeavored to eliminate
 Western influence, except that of the Soviet Union.
 They have made the experience, the practices, the
 theories and the products of the Soviet Union their
 patterns and guides. They have emphasized con-
 formity. They have engineered "anti" campaigns and
 "remodelling" movements, with processes of mob
 trial, of self criticism and of confession. They have
 used everywhere the procedures of spying, inform-
 ing, accusing, condemning and penalizing. They have
 compelled the people-especially the intellectuals-
 to abase themselves and to denounce one another.
 And these things they continue to do.
 They staged in 1957 a "Rectification Campaign",
 directed toward liquidation or suppression of critics of
 the regime. Mao Tse-tung had in February expressed
 himself in terms of a classic: "Let the hundred flowers
 Dioom."  I. he government had later invited criticism.'
 There had ensued a month in which many intellectu-
 als and many student groups indulged fervently in
 freedom of speech. And then the regime clamped
 down, in terms of "weeding the garden" or "suppres-
 sion" of "rightists." Sad has been the fate, the brain-
 washing and orthodoxing, of many of the men-and
 some women-who in this context had expressed
 themselves in words disagreeable to the regime.
 The very latest manifestation of the regime's will
 to dictate is being afforded in the so-called "relocation
 movement." Announcement was made last November
 that several hundred thousand students and likewise
 large numbers of government employees, urban
 workers, professional men and intellectuals were
 "volunteering" to go forth, settle in rural areas, and
 serve the cause of agriculture. "Volunteering" was,
 of course, a euphonious rendering of "being sent"-
 just as it had been in relation to the soldiers sent by
 Peking into Korea in and after 1950.
 Thus has Communism, authoritarian totalitarian-
 ism, dealt with the people in mainland China. A few
 Communist leaders and some millions of Communist
 Party members, a "People's Government", dispose as
 they see fit of the lives and property of 5-00,000,000
 people, their subjects.
 Among their purposes, the Communist leaders have
 of course had that of making China prosperous and
 powerful.
 In the economic field, on the constructive side, they
 have proceeded with a program modeled upon that
 devised and already far advanced in the Soviet Union.
 The objectives and methods have been: agricultural
 reorganization and improvement; industrial rehabili-
 tation and expansion; enlargement and improvement
 of communications; exploitation of mineral resources;
 and collectivization.
 Toward implementing its program the regime
 launched in 1953 a Five Year Plan. That Plan is
 understood to have been prepared by Soviet experts.
 It called among other things for doubling the gross
 industrial output. Its techniques have been Soviet
 in concept and in form. The means for proceeding
 with it-including financing, equipment and instruc-
 tion-have come largely from the Soviet Union. Re-
 mainders from it are now being carried forward in
 a second Five Year Plan.
 In what it has done with the programs thus far,
 the regime has greatly improved the physical face of
 the country. It has emphasized the interests of the
 state rather than the betterment of the lot of its peo-
 ple. Incidentally, yet .pertinently, it has employed
 on projects directed toward agricultural improvement

 large part from the peasantry, and more millions

 industrial expansion, of improvement of communica-
 tions, and of exploitation of mineral wealth, it has
 added substantially to the state's capabilities.
 The most venturesome of the politico-economic
 undertakings has been and is that of the agricultural
 collectivization. This has called for organizing of co-
 operatives within the Chinese farming pattern and for
 creation of large mechanized farms in areas where
 that is practicable. It has been implemented widely
 and at a fast pace. It gives rise to, and it still leaves
 open a question: whether the regime can deal success-
 fully with the human factor, can cause several hun-
 dred million peasants to cooperate in an undertaking
 which calls for abandonment of their traditional as-
 piration to land ownership and of their accustomed
 manner of tilling each his little plot of ground. To
 reconcile the peasants to this it will have to be shown
 them as individuals that they profit by it. Otherwise,
 each can offer resistance-at least in its passive form.
 There has been from the outset some forceful re-
 sistance, in some places, to some of the regime's ef-
 forts. There is disagreement as to its character and
 extent. The Communists themselves have reported
 from time to time on "liquidation" of "subversive
 armed forces," in terms invariably of not less than
 "tens of thousands." Those reports signify only that
 there is some overt resistance and that where it occurs
 it is stamped out. That there can be much-in the
 absence of leaders, of organization and of weapons-
 is not likely. Mass suffering and popular resentment
 do not of themselves produce formidable revolt.
 There could develop a conflict within the Party.
 There could come disaffection within the armed
 forces. There might occur the long planned assault
 from Formosa. In the event of any one or more of
 such conceivable developments there might ensue a
 widespread popular rebellion. There is, however, no
 indication that any of these is imminently likely.
 Probably greatest among Communist China's in-
 ternal problems is that of food for its already huge
 and fast increasing population. China has more land
 than is now under cultivation but it also has too many
 people in and clinging to the most favorable areas,
 and the trend of population movement recently has
 been from the land to the cities rather than the re-
 verse. The regime is working on that problem. It is,
 with engineering, selection of crops, etc., bringing
 hitherto uncultivated or long neglected areas into .
 production. It has destroyed many grave sites and
 cemeteries. The population, though, is increasing at
 a rate which outruns that of the processes of reclama-
 tion. The answer would be: slow down the birth
 rate and speed up the agriculture.  Birth control,

 though, while much talked about, is not sweeping
 the country.
 In the realm of mineral resources, China is in
 terms of absolute amounts reasonably well endowed,
 but in terms of relative amounts and of advantageous
 juxtapositions is less well off than are several other
 countries. What she is known to have is enough to
 support an extensive but not a "super" industrializa-
 tion.
 In the realm of foreign trade, there has been and
 is in some quarters much wishful talking about the
 possibilities of China as a market. If one looks at
 figures of world trade, historical and actual., one
 finds that the China market never has amounted to
 really much. Nor is it likely to in the near future.
 China has not much to export, and, therefore, not
 much with which to pay for imports. There may
 come a time when she will have the wherewithal-
 but that time is probably a long way off. Currently,
 what the Communist regime most wants from abroad
 is strategic goods; what it gives most of in return is
 raw materials and food stuffs; and most of what
 trading it does is with the Soviet Union and other
 Communist countries.
 Communist China's armed forces-ground and air
 -are the foundation and guarantors of the regime's
 authority. They add up to a large establishment.
 Organized on the Soviet model and with Soviet as ,. q
 sistance, they draw heavily upon Russian sources for
 equipment.
 Outstanding is the abiding fact that the Communist.
 regime in the Soviet Union has supplied the inspira-
 tion, the pattern, the guidance and much of the
 equipment and funds that have made possible first=
 the existence, second the victory, and third the thus

 ernment to essay a role in world affairs utterly un-
 familiar in modern times to the Chinese state, that
 of an affirmative heavy-weight contender. In this,
 some features of the foreign policy, the strategy and
 the tactics of China's Communist leaders are obvious:
 Among these are: acceptance of Soviet leadership;
 support of positions taken internationally by the So-
 viet Government; effort to make secure the newly
 re-established Chinese imperial domain; effort to
 achieve for that domain a great power status, with
 universal diplomatic recognition of its Government
 and occupation by that government of China's seats
 in the United Nations; and, in general, effort to en-
 large the influence of the Communist bloc.
 What plans the Peking authorities may have, if
 any, for forceful external adventuring they alone
 know. They are emphasizing preparedness. They
 are expressing opinions and giving advice abroad-
 in support of Soviet opinions, advice or action. They
 presumably will be guided by their and Moscow's
 reading of developments and opportunities in the
 "cold" war. Meanwhile, they propagate at home and
 abroad the thought that China is again a great power,
 that it must "liberate" Formosa, and that it must and
 will defy the United States.
 However, it seems reasonable to believe that for
 the present the regime 'is fully preoccupied with its
 program and its problems at home.
 It is not true that "all is well along the Yangtze."
 It is not true that in mainland China's cities "there
 no longer are flies." It is not true that the people
 have enough to eat and enough to wear and are
 happy. Qualified observers note with one accord
 that the programmers and implementers are now
 encountering grim realities in terms of shortages. One

 The victory of the Communist Party in China in
 1949 and the jurisdictional dichotomy which ensued
 gave rise to many problems in the relations of other
 countries with China. All other Communist states
 and several not-Communist states promptly trans-
 ferred their diplomatic recognition from the National
 Government to the newly created Communist Gov-
 ernment in Peking. As of today, the United States
 and with it a majority of other countries still abide
 by the recognition accorded over the years since 1928
 to the National Government.
 On several occasions, once very recently (in Janu-
 ary 1958), this country's Secretary of State, Mr.
 Dulles, has declared that it is the policy of the
 United States in this context: to continue our recog-
 nition and support of the National Government; to
 continue our withholding of diplomatic recognition
 of the Communist "People's Government"; and to
 continue our opposing of admission of the latter to
 the United Nations. (Mr. Dulles also has explained
 why, has shown that we do not ignore Communist
 China, and has-added to the effect that "no" does not
 necessarily mean "never.")
 That policy takes appropriate account of the record
 and the attitude of the National Government and it
 shows respect for our obligation and our commitment
 to that Government. It takes account likewise of the
 record and the attitude of the Communist regime on
 the mainland. It is in line with the over-all purposes
 and efforts of American foreign policy in defense and
 promotion of freedom, peace, security and justice.
 The Communist Government in Peking follows
 the lead of the Soviet Government in Moscow in the
 war which the Communist world is making upon the
 free world. They two work hand in hand toward
 victory for "Communism" throughout the world.
 They make use of a great variety of weapons and,

 concessions. They talk of "peaceful co-existence"--
 but those words do not mean to them what they
 mean to us. Nor does "Communism" mean "com-

 devised and employed toward enslavement and ex-
