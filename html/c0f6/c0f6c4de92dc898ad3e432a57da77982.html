 SALT
 MOSCOW CONVEYS CONCERN OVER DEADLOCK IN NEGOTIATIONS
 lloscow has expressed its concern ;jbout the stalemate reached
 in the Geneva negotiations In a 7 April P:ZAVDA article
 criticizing continued opposition to SALT in the United
 States.  The article by Valentin Larionov, a specialist
 on military aspects of U.S. foreign policy at the USA
 Institute, was critical of the continuing modernization
 of the U.S. strategic arsenal and of the new U.S. missile
 targeting strategy advanced by Secretary of Defense Schlesinger
 last January.   The unmis'akable thrust of the article was to
 reject pressures For changes in Uoscow's position on SALT
 arising from strategic developments in the United States.
 Although the article conies on the heels of a strong effort
 by lloscow to counter Western press assertions that the
 24-28 March Kissinger visit failed to make progress on a
 range of issues including SALT, Larionov did not broach
 the Kissinger visit or its aftermath in his article.
 Larionov warned that the recent developments in U.S.
 strategic programs and doctrine were "relapses into the
 cold war" which "cannot but damage the process of normalizing
 the international atmosphere."  He did not, however, break
 any new ground in his criticism.  His response to both the
 Secretary's statements on missile targeting strategy and to
 recent Western discussion of po--sible use of tactical nuclear
 .weapons in Et'rope echoed earlier Soviet commentary in arguing
 that the very consideration of a limited nuclear exchange
 tends to lower the barriers to nuclear war and thus "casts
 a shadow" on the U.S.-Soviet prevention of nuclear war
 agreement signed last June.  ;.evertheless, his article
 represents the most authoritative public response to date
 to the missile targeting debate in the United States.
 A. Platonov and L. AleksEyev had skirted the subject in an
 earlier article on SALT in the 14 February PRAVDA.
 Like Platonov and Alekseyev, Larionov balanced criticism of
 adverse developments within the United States with a more
 positive note.   He asserted that leaders on both sides are
 "exerting effcrts (and urging other countries to do the same)
 to bring about a limitation above all in that sphere of
 armaments which holds the most dangerous potential."  Moreover,

 10 APR:LL 1.974
 he concluded that despite the most recent developments
 the "political atmosphere"  is still more propitious for
 agreement than during the first stage of SALT and that as
 a result "the negotiaL:icnb can lead to constructive
 results if both sides have a real desire to reach .lgree-
 ment:."  Unlike Platonov and Alekseyev, however, he did not
 mention the  commitment  made at  the June summit to seek
 agreement by the end of 1974.
 l.acionov is a retired colonel who has acquired a reputation
 as a hardiiner because of his rather hawkish treatment of
 U.S. weapons programs in the past.  Thus his selection to
 Wri.re the 1?RAVDA article appears to be designed to strengthen
 1ho credibility of. ifoscow's firm stance on SALT at this time.
 Llr i.onov was chosen to perform a similar role following the
 conclusion of the SALT ONE agreements in 1972.  His article
 in the 8 September NEW TIMES (No. 37) capped a public effort
 by  Moscow--pegged to the congressional debate on rat i.fi_cat.i.on
 of the May agreements--to warn against U,S. moves to ol:f.set
 the .i.nrt::rim offensive agreement's quantitative limitations
 through qualitative improvements. *  Larionov argued in the
 article that a new emphasis on qualitative development
 would "contravene the very spirit of the agreements concluded."
 In the current PRAVDA article he again showed concern over
 the implications of a persisting U.S. technological lead,
 such as in warhead accuracy.   He cautioned that "the mili-
 tarists of the seventies are placing great hopes on the
 return, even if only in the long run, of the lost strategic
 superiority of the United States by means of qualitative
 improvement of -capons.    .    ."
 ??  The TRENDS of 13 September 1972, pages 27-29, discusses
 Moscow's reaction to the congressional debate over the initial
 SALT agreements.

 MOSCOW BACKS FRENCH LEFTIS'rS, PRAISES POMPIDOU'S POLICIES
 Initial low-level Moscow i::eaction to the French presidential
 elections indicates that the Soviet Union is giving, pro-forma
 support to the PCP 's strategy of bockinp Socialist party
 leader Francois Mitterand, as the candidate of the leftist
 coalition, on the first ballot scheduled for   May.   This
 is in accordance with Moscow's usual practice of supporting
 the electoral strategy of local connnuni;;t parties and
 does not necessarily indicate that the Soviet Union would
 prefer. Mitterand to the eventual Gaullist candidate.   Indeed,
 the praise accorded Pompidou's policies by Soviet media in
 the aftermath of his death suggests that Moscow may prefer
 a continuation of a Gaullist regime to t:lie unknown quantity
 that would be represented by a les; nationalist-minded leader.
 Almost immediately after President Pompidou's 2 April. death,
 Moscow radio and TASS began publicizing 1'CF and communist-
 dominated trade union appeals For a single leftist candidate
 supported by the PC$, the Socialist Party (PS), and the left
 Radicals under the aegis of the three parties' Joint Program.
 Moscow's apparent endorsement of the PCF's strategy, however,
 stopped short of direct acclaim for  ii.tterand personally.
 The possibility of an ultimate victory for. M.itt:erand thus
 poses questions for Moscow relating to French l:ori i?n and
 internal policies, and Soviet media have  to (late  maintained
 a significant silence on this possibility.
 Until relatively recently Mitterand was a consistent public
 critic of the Kremlin and, as a result, a favorite bete noire
 of Soviet comment.   But as Mitterand in recent months has
 sought to increase his statute as a presidential candidate
 and has softened his public criticism of the Kremlin, Moscow
 similarly has increased favorable publicLt.-y for hi.m.   Commenting
 on the 8 April endorsement by the three leftist parties of
 Mitterand, Moscow radio's French service said that. Paris
 and Western press observers rated Mitterand's "personal"
 standing as high.   The radio cited a Paris paper to point out
 that a joint lefL:ist candidate could outpoll all other
 candidates on tae first ballot, but it stopped short of
 conanenting on a prospective second ballot in which the Gaullists
 believe they can win a runoff between a single Gaullist-supported
 candidate and Mitterand.

 10 APRIL 1974
 As regards Pompidou, Moscow has heaped glowing praise on
 the former president as a worthy successor to General
 de Gaulle in furthering the successful development of
 detente and cooperation between France and the Soviet Union.
 Moscow rclio's French service on the 3d went so far as to
 say that Pompidou's "political testament" was epitomized
 in his recent remarks to journalists in Pitsunda during his
 talks with Brezlinev.   Pompidou was quoted as saying that
 Soviet-French cooperation and friendship wet.^_ the result
 of history, geography, General de Gaulle's policies, and
 those of the current Soviet and French leaders.  According
 to the radio, Pompidou added that this policy of cooperation
 must continue and be expanded for the good of the two
 countries and the stability of Europe.   The favorable
 praise for the Gaullist tradition as it affects Soviet
 French relations may be interpreted as Moscow's subtle
 way of expressing its preference for another eventual
 Gaullist victory in the current elections.
 MOSCOW TAKES RESTRAINED NOTE OF UK-EC DIFFERENCES
 Moscow reacted in low-keyed fashion to British Foreign Secretary
 Callaghan's announcement, at the EC Council of Ministers meeting
 on 1-2 April in Luxembourg, of his government's intention either
 to obtain renegotiation of the terms of its membership in the
 Common Market or to withdraw its membership.   In a series of TASS
 and Moscow radio items Moscow has indicated that the British move
 provides further evidence of increased West European disunity and
 reveals the economic and political disadvantages for European
 countries in Common Market membership.  This restrained reaction
 is generally consistent with Moscow's practice on intra-European
 issues, and apparently reflects its belief that a hands-off attitude
 serves its interests better than a heavy-handed show of partisan-
 ship.                   If it had wished to exploit the issue, the materials were
 ready at hand.
 Reaction in the West European press to Britain's announcement
 was  varied but generally unsympathetic, tending to present
 the development as a major crisis for the EC and a setback for
 European unity.   Some of the more critical comment accused the
 Wilson government of being guided by narrow domestic political
 considerations, as well as by short-sighted nationalistic interests,
 at the expense of the larger European community.   Other critical
 comment accused Britain of failing to honor diplomatic obligations,
 upsetting its allies and threatening to deadlock future EC de-
 liberations for months.

 Soviet comment has alluded briefly to some of these critical
 themes but has not replayed them in detail.            Moscow radio's weekly
 observers' roundtable noced on 7 April, for example, that the
 EC Council of Ministers meeting had stimulated a "whole avalanche
 of comment" and pessimistic concern for the future of the EC in
 the West European press.  But in the subsec-tent brief discussion
 of this development, IZVESTIYA observer Mikhaylov focused almost
 entirely on the substantive content of. Callaghan's speech, re-
 marking that the British announcement was faithful to a well-known
 public position of the Labor Party, should have surprised no one,
 and requested adjustment only for "the most serious liabilities"
 of EC membership.  Noting that the British announcement had "met
 with hostility," Mikhaylov concluded blandly that. "the crisis in
 inter-state relations in the West continues to mount."

 FBIS TRENDS
 1.0 APRIL 1974
 USSR URGES RETURN TO GENEVA TALKS, EXCHANGES BARBS WITH EGYPT
 in a period of lessened diplomatic activity on the Arab-Israeli
 problem, Moscow has continued to call for an early resumption of
 the Geneva peace conference while avoiding detailed comment on
 the disengagement issue.   At the same time, in broadcasts in Arabic
 it has indicated its displeasure with Egypt on a variety of counts,
 ranging from as-Sadat's recent public criticism of the Soviet
 Union to Cairo's trend toward economic liberalization.  Moscow has
 also played up the second anniversary of the Soviet-Iraqi friendship
 and cooperation treaty and has continued to publicize the forthcoming
 visa.t to the Soviet Union of Syrian President a.l-Asad.
 SYRIAN-ISRAELI      Without overtly denigrating Secretary Kissinger's
 DISENGAGEMENT       efforts to bring about- disengagement on the Golan
 front, Moscow has made cloar its impatience to
 get back in the negotiating picture through a resumption of the Geneva
 talks.  Matveyev in an international review in IZVESTIYA on the 2d
 referred to the "urgency" of resuming the Geneva conference, saying
 that only within such a framework, "not: by means of any other com-
 binations," would it be possible to achieve a stable political
 settlement.  Middle East specialist Belyayev, in the domestic
 service observers' roundtable on the 7th, similarly called for a
 return to Geneva and dismissed any notion of "dwelling on some
 kind of individual measures."
 Soviet treatment of Israeli Defense Minister Dayan's visit to
 Washington at the end of March to present T:sraei's proposals on
 disengagement on the Syrian front typically focused more on the
 issue of further U.S. military aid to. Israel and Dayan's talks
 with Secretary Schlesinger than on his disengagement discussions
 with  Secretary Kissinger.  Moscow linked the tension on the Golan
 front  with  Dayan's visit, attributing the Golan clashes to Israel's
 desire to convince the United States of the continued need for
 financial and military aid.   A :RED STAR article on the 7th, noting
 that Dayan. had gone to Washington "ostensibly" to discuss dis-
 engagement, found it "very significant" that talks with Schlesinger
 were included in his program.

 RED STAR, like other comment, also saw the Golan clashes as
 evidence of Tel Aviv's refusal to withdraw from the area, point-
 ing to a statement by Dayan in Washington that he did not believe
 Israel would return the Golan Heights to Syria.          RED STAR observed
 that the conclusions of Israel's Agranat commission investigating
 Israeli preparedness last October stemmed from t:he need to find a
 scapegoat and showed that Israeli leaders did not intend to change
 their "adventurist" policy.
 TASS on the 9th in a one-sentence item reported the departure of a
 Syrian delegation for Washington "in view of the pending negotiations"
 on Syrian-Israeli disengagement along the Golan ceasefire line.
 Moscow has supported Syria's firm position on disengagement, with
 PRAVDA's international review on the 7th referring approvingly
 to Damascus' "logical" position that it would not accept a "partial
 solution" nor any plan for separation of forces which did not

 1967 and 1973.   In effect justifying Syrian fire on the Golan Heights,
 PRAVDA cited the Damascus AL-BA'TII as declaring that Syrian
 military action was aimed at preventing Israel. from advancing and
 fortifying its positions.  And a PRAVDA dispatch on the 6th said
 that Israel was strengthening and improving its positions, "creating
 a system of long-term defense," and beefing up its forces by
 transferring major contingents from rear areas.
 Reporting President al-Asad's speech on the 13a'th Party anniversary,
 TASS on the 8th noted without comment that he declared Syria would
 continue its political activities aimed at settling the conflict
 but would not stop the "armed struggle" directed toward achieving
 this goal.   In his speech, broadcast by Damascus radio on the 7th,
 al-Asad also cryptically rejected criticism of Syria's "inflexible"
 stand not only by "some of our Arab brothers" but also by "some
 of those who share our problem from a distance."

 in encouraging foreign investment and in effect turning away from
 Nasir's socialist policies.  Moscow responded indirectly but trans-

 COALITION GOVERNMENT FORMED IN LAOS AFTER LONG DELAY
 The long-delayed formation of a coalition government and council
 in Laos has prompted predictable statements of apprc?,al from the
 Lao Patriotic Front (LPF) and its supporters in 1-lanoI., Peking,
 and Moscow.  At the same time LPF comment has warned  that the
 United States and its "henchmen" still harbor "dark schemes to
 prevent and sabotage" the coalition.   King Savang Vatthana's
 investiture of the two bodies came on 5 April--more than a year
 after the 23 March 1973 date specified in the 21 February 1973
 Vientiane agreement.*  A September protocol on implementation of
 the Vientiane a1;?eement had termed as "independent and equal"
 the two bodies--the Provisional National Union Government (PNUG)
 headed by Premier Souvanna Phouma, and the National Coalition
 Political Council (NCPC)  headed by LPF Chairman Souphanouvong.
 The September protocol also stipulated that the NCPC would work
 closely with the government on both domestic and foreign policy
 formulation, the implementation of the 1.973 agreements, and the
 organization of the general elections.
 The LPF's determination to insure that the NCPC has equal
 stature with the government was reflected in its choice of
 personnel to fill positions allotted to it in the government
 and the council.  In addition to naming Secretary General Phoumi
 Vongvichit deputy premier and foreign minister in the government,
 the Front designated LPF Central Committee members for two of its
 10 other government posts.  In the NCPC Souphanouvong will have five
 members of the LPF Central Committee serving under him out of the
 total of 15 other posts that the Front was allotted.  The LPF's other
 positions in the government and NCPC were given to members of the
 Patriotic Neutralist Forces and relatively obscure, nonpolitical
 functio,aaries.
 Consistent with the Pathet Lao practice of focusing its attacks on
 the United States since the Vientiane agreement, a 6 April LPF
 Central Committee appeal assailed "the policy of aggression of
 the United States and its henchmen in Laos and Indochina."  The
 appeal viewed the creation of a new government in Laos as "a
 heavy setback for U.S. neocolonialism and a handful of warmongers,"

 who I.I. :warned would continue to carry out "dark schemes" to
 sabotage the coalition.    An unusually caustic father Lao radio
 commentary on the same day hailed the cont:Lnu:ing struggle against
 the ruthlessness and brut:a7.fty of the bellicose U.S. :imperialists
 and their henchmen."  The 11A7'tLET LAO NEWS AGENCY on the 7th
 transmitted a lengthy indictment of U.S. policy in Laos since
 World War 11, mentioning po.intcdl.y that the Un:lted States had
 long coveted the'111jundaiit natural resources" ava Liable in the
 country.*
 In the hours imnaediatel.y preceding the .installation of the new
 coalition, the Pathet Lao radio began to promote Souphanouvong's
 status in the new Hierarchy by referring to him as "Chairman
 His Highness Prince Souphanouvong, our beloved leader."  On the
 day of the investiture, however-, a message was monitored on a
 Pathet Lao point-to-point r.ad:Loteletype circuit directing that
 the phrase "our beloved leader" be eliminated from the new
 standard formulation, reflecting some sensitivity about excessive
 exaltation of SouphrlnoUVOng in the circumstances of implementing
 a new arrangement with RLC leaders.   Pathet Lao media have
 dwelled, however, on the "enthusiastic" welcome -accorded
 Souphanouvong on his arrival in both Vientiane and Luang Prabang.
 FOREIGN REACTION      Hanoi, Peking, and Moscow have manifested
 their official, support for the establ.ish!aent
 of the coalition in Laos.  Congratulatory messages were sent to
 Souphanouvong--by DRV President 't'on Duc ']'hang aiid Nat i.onal.

 Ton Duc Thang and I'RC act trig Chra i.rman Tung P.i.-wu.  The top
 echelon North Vietnamese leaders hosted the entire LPi'/PNF
 contingent in Hanoi while en route to Vientiane and Luang Prabang.
 In references to U.S. policy in Laos, communist comment hailing
 the coalition followed familiar patterns:   Hanoi was unrestrained
 in its criticism and Peking and Moscow were circumspect.  A
 6 April NILAN DAN editorial, for example, accused the United States
 of resorting "to the most barbarous and perfidious maneuvers" and

 PEKING, PYONGYANG WARMLY RECEIVE CAMBODIAN FRONT DELEGATION
 Following a high-level welcome in Hanoi during a 28 March-1 April
 visit, the Cambodian Front delegation led by insurgent armed
 forces chief Khieu Samphan and his "special. advisor" l:eng Sary
 was given comparable treatment during visits to Peking and
 Pyongyang, effectively cementing an image of Asian communisL
 solidarity with the Cambodian struggle.   The leJ.egation arrived
 in Peking from Hanoi  n 1 April. and stayed until the 5th, when
 it left for Pyongyang, where it visited for three days before
 returning to Peking on the 8th.   In both China and North Korea,
 the delegates were received and feted by top-level. officials,
 including Mao Tse-tung and Kim I1-song, and spoke at a full
 round cr receptions and rallies attended by strong representations
 from the PRC and DPRK Politburos.
 Speeches by Khieu Samphan in Peking and Pyongyang played up the
 same themes that had marked  his international debut in Hanoi
 last wee'.c.*  He routinely reaffirmed Front deLermination to
 achieve the five points, called attention to continued insurgent
 victories of "strategic significance," duly attacked the chief
 members of the Lon Nol regime by name, and showed continued
 sensitivity over alleged U.S.  plans for a "sham peace" and cease-
 fire short of Front objectives.
 Samphan carefully acknowledged the titular .leading position of
 the China-based Front contingent led by "lie-ad of state" Prince
 Sihanouk and RGNU Prime Minister Penn North, who were in Peking
 to greet Samphan on arrival.   Sihanouk had returned to Peking on
 28 March from Canton--his prime residence in China since  his
 ailing mother's arrival there last November.   Ile was greeted at

 Nouth have attended all major. Chinese ceremonial functions
 in honor of the Front delegation, including its meetings with
 Mao on 2 April, but were nr.,tabiy absent from two working-level
 meetings which Chou held with Swil)han and Sary on 2 and 4 April.
 NCNA reported that Sihanouk on the 3d gave a r ception for
 Samphan and Sary, at which he rcltornLed Front reso:l.ve not to
 reconcile with Lon Nol.
 U.S. ROLE         'I'hr.oughouL lit   tour., Khi.eu Samplian has been
 IN CAMBODIA       nt pa i is to ,;tress the impact of continued
 U.S.  Involvement in the Cambodian conflict
 following the :15 August 1973 U.S. bombing halt, and to charge that
 Washington has recently endeavored to step up Its interference
 through increased economic and inil.i.tar.y aid to [.oil Nol and through
 direct command of the Phnom Pcnli adm.inist ration by growing numbers
 of U.S. advisers.  This approac'i was eart.ier Initiated authorita-
 tively in a 20 March RCNU 1.'r.opaanda and information Ministry
 statement and was followed in comment marling the 23 March Front
 anniversary.   Propaganda has m.tantamnod that stepped-up U.S.
 interference and aid li is been respon;.;:i.b.ile for Lon Nol's continued
 survival, and has, in effect, excused public Front predictions
 late last year that the 1973-74 dry season offensive would finish
 off the enemy.   Samphart had been in the forefront of those
 predicting decisive success last fall., but he appeared to
 acknowledge the present military stalemate In a 3 April rally
 speech in Peking which cited heavy U.S.  involvement: in noting
 that the insurgents "arc, determined to fight this bloody war on
 a long-term basis."
 While rationalizing Front failure Lo end the present military
 stalemate, Samphan's stress on the U.S. role has also seemed
 designed to revive support from Front: all. Les in Pelting and Hanoi,
 who have been increasingly restrained in their backing of Front
 objectives over the past year.  Notably, Peking and Hanoi have
 generally softpedaaed specific support for the Front demand
 regarding the overthrow of the Lon Nol regime.   In the wake
 of the U.S. bombing halt, both allies significantly reduced
 public attention to the U.S. role in Cambodia, suggesting that
 they viewed the situation as one in which the Cambodian people
 should "settle their own affairs" without major outside support.
 By stressing Was lington's continued and allegedly expanding
 involvement In Cambodia, Samphan in effect has reminded both
 backers of their internationalist obligation to continue and
 :increase support for the Cambodian struggle against outside
 "imper.ialism."

 To make the Front position more attractive to its Chinese and
 Vietnamese allies, Samphan's stress on the U.S. role has been
 accompanied by a notable softpedniing of his previous emphasis
 on the need to "anti ih:ilate" the Lon Nol regime.   1z~.Lher than focus
 as in  the past on his uncompromising resolve to drive nut the
 United States and to destroy the Phnom Penh regime before peace
 will be restored, Samphan endeavored to put to more reasonable
 gloss on his settlement stznce, stressing the Front's desire for
 peace and asserting that U.S, interference alone is responsible
 for holding back peace.   'hough he duly affirmed Front resolve to
 achieve the five points and to overthrow the Lon Not regime,
 Samphan did not--as he has in the past--specifically call for the
 regime's overthrow as a condition for peace.
 CAMBODIAN-PRC      In his speeches in Peking, Smnphan was notably
 RELATIONS          more effusive regarding Chinese aid and
 relations with the Front than lie had been
 concerning Front-DRV ties while in Hanoi.  lie hailed Peking's
 "unqualified support and assistance," and said that Front-PRC
 friendship "is a pure one based on correct principles of equality,
 mutual benefit, and unqualified mutual respect."  'the Chinese
 .iprocated, putting on a large show of 1'RC solidarity with the
 Cambodian and Indochinese struggles.   Aside from their meeting
 with Mao, the delegates have thus far been addressed by Chou
 En-lai at a banquet on the 1st and by Wang flung-wen at: a rally on
 the 3d, which occasioned the turnout of eleven Lull and two
 alternate PRC Politburo members.
 Chinese speakers at the various activities have duly supported the
 Front's five points, hailed the RGNU as the "sole legal government"
 of Cambodia, and affirmed Sihanouk's status as "head of state."  They
 promised "all.-out support and assistance" for the Cambodian struggle,
 and duly criticized continued U.S. aid for the "traitorous Lon Nol
 clique," demanding that Washington stop its interference and allow
 the Cambodians to settle their own affairs.  The Chinese also used
 the occasion to reaffirm support for the PRG's recent six-point plan
 and to reiterate the demand that Washington and Saigon abide by the
 Paris agreement.
 PRC FOREIGN POLICY     To underline Chinese unity with the Cambodian
 and other revolutionary struggles, the
 Chinese used the occasion of the visit to recall. Mao's 20 May 1970
 statement pegged to the U.S. invasion of Cambodia--a statement
 which had not been cited by PRC media in recent months.   However,
 Peking was careful to avoid stressing the salient anti-U.S.,
 anti-Nixon Administration features of the 1970 Mao statement,

 emphasizing instead  the broad M;)oi.st belief that the Indochinese
 peoples' example h::rs Shown that  by resolute struggle a small ant:
 seemingly  weak  oppressed people  can  defeat  a  poworfti I  naornaanr.
 In a further demonstration of revolutionary solidarity, Wang
 1-lung-wen on the 3d disclose  the new Mao instruction that "we are
 eom1nuni.cts, and must hci.p the people.   If we do not help the
 people, then :LL is a betrayal  of Marxism."    Chou En-lai had
 appeared to allude to this :i.nstr.uction In a 24 March banquet
 speech for the Tanzanian president when he affirmed Peking's
 "bounden proletarian intor.nationalist duty" to aid world
 revolutionary struggles and asked rhetorically:   "How can a
 communist party or a socini1st country be worthy of its name
 if it' does  lot: support the pCop.ie's revolutionary struggles?"
 'In a 6 March 1971 Hanoi rally address Chou had referred to a
 similar Mao instruction in the Vietnamese context, which asserted
 that "If anyone among us should say that we should not help the
 Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and
 for national salvation, that will. be betrayal, betrayal of the
 revolution."
 The 1.'eic:ing leaders also used the opportunity of the delegation's
 visit to lecture the. Cambodians on the Chinese view of the
 international situation, particularly the belief that continuing
 "world disorder" stemming from U.S.-Soviet rivalry and Third
 World opposition to the superpowers is the salient feature of
 the present age and is having a beneficial  impact for. China and
 for oppressed peoples throughout the world.  Chou's speech on the
 .1st appeared to allude to the concl!1s:Lon of Secretary Kissinger's
 24-28 March stay in Mosco:a in stressing the Chinese belief that
 despite talk of detente and "lasting peace," superpower rivalry
 will continue, providing opportunity for advantageous Chinese
 maneuvering within the triangular relationship.
 Wang Hung-wen, in his first major speech since his report. at
 the 10th CCP Congress last August, added his endorsement to
 Chou's assessment of international affairs in his rally speech
 on the 3d, pointing out that U.S.-Soviet rivalry has spread
 from the crucial area of Europe to the Middle East, Mediterranean,
 and Indian Ocean, in spite of efforts toward reconciliation.
 Wang also took the opportunity to clarify the seeming ambiguity
 in his report last August regarding where Peking presently sees
 the major threat of attack against China.  .In his 24 August
 address, Wang had called on the Chinese people to "prepare well
 against any war of aggression and guard against surprise attack
 by imperialism and social-imperialism."  His 3 April speech

 carefully dropped the allusion to the United States and focused
 solely en the USSR in stating that the Chinese are prepared
 against "a surprise attack launched by social-imperialism."
 Although Moscow media have given the Front delegation's visits
 only passing notice, Moscow radio on 5 April harshly rebutted
 the "anti-Soviet action" of Wang's rally speech.  The report
 noted that Wang is considered the "third most important person
 in the Peking hierarchy" and carefully cited his close ties to
 Mao's entourage, suggesting that Moscow sees little indication
 that this representative of the younger geneiar-ton in Peking
 Will-prove any more moderate toward Moscow than his elders.

 MOSCOW, BUDAPEST PROMOTE DRIVE FOR NEW WORLD PARTY CONCLAVE
 Moscow's reluctance to take, the lead in cal.].ing for  F1  new
 international conference of- cominun:i.st parties was evidenced
 most recently in a 30 Marcie 1'1'AVDA editorial. article which
 typically focused on appeals for a conference by other parties.
 The article, keyed to the third anniversary of the 24th CPSU
 Congress, said without elaboration that  the CPSU deeply
 understands the urge of the fraternal parties to once again
 exchange opinions" on topical world issues.  F:Lve days later,
 an authoritative article in the 4 April NEPSZABADSAG reiterated
 Budapest's support for a new conference and served notice
 that the Uungar:Lans are ready to p:Lay a key role in preparing
 for a new conference, as they did in connection with the
 June 1969 ?Ioscow party conference.
 The PRAVDA editorial article prefaced its referen^e to "an
 exchanl;'I of ^p:Lnions'' among the parties by an attack on the
 Maoist  leadership of China, a vow to wage an uncompromising
 struggle "against right and 'left' revisionism," and an assertion
 that the international situation had "greatly changed" since
 1969--tile stock arguments currently used by foreign Cl) supporters
 of a new conference.   Soviet media have duly reported the
 endorsements of this line by iloscow's five orthodox East
 European allies and by about a dozen nonruling CP's.   On its
 own, iioscow had in the February issue of PARTY 1,1 FE disputed
 arguments against a new conference raised by a minor Spanish
 Cl? official while at the same time portraying plans for the
 conference as still in the tentative stage.
 1-UNGARIAJ      The 4 April NEI'SZAI3ADSAC article, by the
 ARTICLE         authoritative foreign affairs commentator
 Ferenc Varnai, may be viewed as an effort to
 improve Budapest's image in 'toscow's eyes at a time when
 it is under heavy Soviet pressure to restructure the Hungarian
 economic management system along more orthodox lines.   Varnai
 traced Hungarian support for a new conference back to Kadar's
 speech at the 10th IISTIP Congress in 1970.   The author recalled
 that Radar had noted the absence of any "international
 organization" in the communist movement and had urged the
 adoption of "joint ideological stances" on Topical issues.

 10 APRIL 1974
 Clearly with Romania in mind, Varnai alluded sarcastically
 to "people who regard the international conference as a
 'threat' to their party's independence."  He went on to
 point out that Moscow had repeatedly given assurances that
 the movement had no "center," that all national parties
 were independent and had equal rights, and that no party
 could prescribe what another party could or could not say
 at international communist meetings.   Continuing in this
 vein, he warned that "those who pay attention only to their
 own interests, but do not act for the movement as a whole,
 are no internationalists."  He added that no single country
 could on its own exert a decisive influence on major world
 developments.
 Varnai also flatly denied "bourgeois" predictions that the
 new conference would "excommunicate China."  lie instead
 insisted. that the world movement "never intended" to oust
 Peking and that it was the Maoist leaders who "isolate
 themselves."
 Varnai's article was clearly in response to Romanian objections
 to a new conference spelled out by Ceausescu in an interview

 his stance in an interview published in the London GUARDIAN

 there was "no question of organizing such a meeting in the

 NEW COLLECTIONS OF BREZHNEVIS SPEECHES PROLIFERATE
 The Brezhnev cult has reached new heights in recent months, with
 publication of two new col.lcc lions of his speeches, glorification
 of his dominant role in Soviet policy formulation and almost unan-
 imous    recognition of his status as head of the CPSU Politburo.
 With eight collections of his speeches now in print, Brezhnev is
 rapidly approaching Khrushchev in literary output.  The role of
 Brezhnev's publications in boosting his political stature was
 highlighted by a 27 March KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA editorial review
 of one of the newly published collections, which declared that
 his speeches not only "crystallize the collective mind" of the
 Politburo but also represent his unique personal contribution
 to policy making.
 In Brezhnev's nine and one half years as party leader, eight
 collections of his speeches have appeared, as against eleven
 major collections of Khrushchev speeches during his eleven and
 one hall: year reign.   Brezhnev's first edition appeared in early
 1970, rouGhly matching the five year germinal period before the
 public;zLion of Khrushchev's first major collection in 1958.
 Perhaps of greater importance are the different leadership images
 projected by the two sets of publications.  To judge Cr.om the
 titles of his collected works, Khrushchev's image was depicted in
 rich colors as a force for world peace, an opponent of war, a
 tribune of the arts, a spokesman for agricultural interests and
 an advocate of "goulash communism."  By the same token, Brezhnev
 emerges merely as a businesslike world statesman and an austere
 authority on agricultur.a.l policy, party organization and Komsomol
 affairs.
 BREZHNEV'S      Brezhti v has already outdone Khru shchev in the
 COLLECTION      massive volume in which his works have appeared.
 For example, Brezhnev's main collection--a two-
 volume 1970 edition--was issued in 500,000 copies.  By contrast,
 Khrushchev's editions never exceeded 250,000 copies and his main
 collection--an eight-volume edition on agriculture--was issued in
 only 75,000 copies.  Brezhnev's collected works were announced in
 PRAVDA on the following dates:
 2 May 1970--a two-volume general collection of speeches and
 articles since October 1964, entitled "The Leninist Course"

 KHRUSHCHEV'S COLLECTION     Although the loquacious Khrushchev had
 more volumes in print,  they usually
 covered relatively short periods.  Collections covering his entire
 tenure as first se.retary began appearing in 1963, most notably an
 eight-volume collection of agricultural speeches.   Aside from a
 short 1956 collection of speeches to youth and reprints in pamphlet
 form of individual. speeches on special occasions, the following
 major volumes of Khrushchev speeches were published:
 1958--a collection of 1957 speeches, entitled "For a Firm Peace
 and Peaceful Coexistence"

 BURGEONING CULT     Since the December 1973 CPSU plenum public
 ackawwledgement of Brezhnev as "head" of the
 Politburo has  become virtually standard practice throughout the
 Soviet Union.  The Ukraine and the city of. Moscow fell into line
 with this practice in February ai,d March.  At earlier ceremonial
 meetings in those areas obeisance was paid to the Politburo without
 reference to 3rezhnev.
 Brezhnev's dominant role in foreign affairs received unusual praise
 in an 18 January NEW TIMES article by Yuriy Ivashin.   Reviving a
 formula made familiar in the Stalin era and only rarely used in
 Khrushchev's day, Ivashin declared that Soviet foreign policy was
 made "under the direct leadership" of Brezhnev.   It is noteworthy
 that Ivashin coupled praise of Brezhnev's summit diplomacy, which
 in his view had transformed Moscow into a mecca for leaders of
 Western as well as communist states, with undisguised contempt for
 the Soviet foreign a:f</div></div></div>  </div>
