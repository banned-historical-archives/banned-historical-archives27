 Shele in Removed from
 Soviet Politburo
 The Soviet party Central Committee meeting in
 Moscow yesterday signaled the beginning of prepara-
 tions for the next party congress and eliminated
 one of the potential runners in the long-term race
 to succeed General Secretary Brezhnev.  The removal
 of trade uniunr3 chief Aleksandr Shelepin from the
 Politburo does little to clarify the succession
 picture, however, and there could well be additional
 moves within the leadership between now and the con-
 vening of the congress.
 Brezhnev was clearly in charge at the plenum,
 delivering a report on plans for the congress, now
 set for February 24, 1976.  Foreign Minister Gromyko
 delivered a report on foreign affairs, which is
 usually given by Brezhnev.  This continues the trend
 toward greater collectivity in the leadership that
 has been apparent since the General Secretary's
 illness this winter.  Since his return to public
 view, Brezhnev has been pacing himself more care-
 fully.  As a result, greater public exposure has
 been given to his colleagues.
 The decision setting the date for the party
 congress has come earlier and more smoothly than
 it did for the 24th congress in 1971.  This suggests
 satisfaction on the part of the leaders with present
 political conditions and confidence in their ability
 to set the course of the Soviet Union over the next
 five years.
 The announcement of the opening date for the
 congress should trigger a cycle of party meetings
 which will begin in the fall and continue up
 through the hierarchy, ending by late January or
 early February.  Personnel shifts will probably be

 occurring from now on at all levels within the party,
 and final, results of these shifts will determine the
 relative political strength of the various Soviet
 leaders for the next several year&.
 Sholopin has long been regarded warily by soma
 of his colleagues as a dangerous combination of
 ability and ambition, and his departure from the
 Kremlin removes a potential element of instability
 in the leadership.   In 1965, he mounted a serious
 but unsuccessful challenge to Brozhnev's leadership.
 When that failed, his career took a precipitous
 slide.   In 1967 he was  removed from the party
 Secretariat and given the trade unions post--a
 traditionally powerless figurehead position.
 Shelepin's visit to England and Scotland last
 month was greeted by a tremendous outcry in the
 British press against him personally as a former
 chief of the Soviet secret police (KGB), and
 clearly hurt his prospects for the future.   (CONFI-

 Soviet Central committee meets
 25X1X
 The resolution issued by yesterday's Central
 Committee plenum expressed satisfaction with the
 fruits of the four-year-old Soviet "peace program"
 and endorsed continuation of a detente policy.
 Striking a typical balance, the resolution also
 observed, however, that the successes of Soviet
 foreign policy were based on Soviet economic and
 military strength, and noted that the forces of
 wer and reactio', were still active.
 The resolution put the party's stamp of ap-
 proval on further progress in the force reduction
 talks and SALT by holding that political detente
 must be accompanied by military detente, including
 arms reductions.   It also noted the continuing im-
 portance of bilateral and multilateral summitry in
 improving international relations.
 in light of recent international developments,
 the Soviet leadership apparently concluded that this
 was an appropriate time for a foreign policy review.
 Like past Central Committee resolutions, however,
 this one is short on specifics.  Details were almost
 certainly taken up by Foreign Minister Gromyko in his
 report to the plenum, but neither his speech nor
 that of party chief Brezhnev is likely to be made public.
 The plenum's emphasis on foreign policy jibes
 with reports that Moscow has begun a broad assessment
 of Soviet relations with the West in preparation for
 the party congress next February.                           25X1X
 says that this
 group has at least reached some preliminary conclusions:
 --World developments since the last
 party congress in 1971 have demon-
 strated the correctness of Moscow's

 detonto policy, and the policy
 should be continued.
 --The capitalist powers retain great
 strength and resilience, and will
 rebound from their current economic
 crisis.
 --The economic rewards of detente,
 especially the increascu imports
 of Western technology, will not in
 themselves obviate the need for
 change in the Soviet political and
 economic structure if the USSR is to
 close the technology gap with the West.
 This Interpretation of Soviet thinking is ob-
 viously subject to change, and other Soviets might
 be prepared to argue that the foreign policy line
 should be adjusted to take advantage of the chang-
 ing world situation.  Nonetheless, it is consistent
 with other signs of the mood in Moscow.  A recent
 .article in Pravda by the minister of foreign trade,
 which highlighted the rapid growth of trade with the
 West, took a strongly self-confident stance, con-
 trasting the strengthened political, economic, and
 military posture of the USSR with the troubles of
 the West.   During Secretary Simon's visit to Moscow
 last week, the Soviets made it clear that while their
 interest in bilateral trade is still high, it is tip
 to the US to remove political obstacles to increased
 trade.   (CONFIDENTIAL)

 Iraqi's Visit Fails to
 Stem Soviet Concern
 The brief, official visit to Moscow of Iraqi
 strong man Saddam Husayn, which ended April 15, ap-
 pears to have been amicable, but probably did not
 lessen concern in the Kremlin about Baghdad's drift
 ?A::'ay from the USSR.
 in his speech at a dinner for the Iraqis, So-
 viet Premier Kosygin implied that Iraq's accord with
 Iran will reduce Baghdad's dependence on Moscow.
 He did not endcrse the accord and cautioned that
 "imperialists" still have designs on Iraq.  The
 agreement was endorsed, however, in Movcow Radio's
 Arabic-language broadcast of the communique.
 Kosygin's remarks suggest that Moscow is con-
 cerned that the Baathist regime opposes a role for
 the Iraqi Communist Party in the government.   He
 said that Moscow regards the cohesion of leftist
 forces as an "earnest" of Iraq's revolutionary
 credentials.
 The Soviet Premier also indirectly voiced mis-
 givings about Iraqi policy toward the Kurds.                             The
 Soviets, who have been cool to Iraq's armed suppres-
 sion of the rebellion, may think that the Baathists
 intend to eliminate the Kurds as a political factor.
 The Soviets may hope that the collapse of Kurdish
 leader Barzani's movement will lead to a revival of
 leftist influence among the Kurds that the Soviets
 could exploit.
 Kosygin championed closer cooperation among
 Syria, Iraq, and Egypt, arguing that a united posi-
 tion would enable the Arabs to confront Israel mor?
 effectively.   in an apparent reference to Baghdad's
 charges that Syria has diverted water from the

 Euphrates River, the Soviet leader urged that "all"
 obstacles to unity be removed.
 The visit appears to have been short on sub-
 stantive accomplishments, with new agreements limited
 to a consular convention and cooperation on the
 peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Although the Iraqi
 and Soviet chiefs of staff participated in the talks,
 there is no indication that any new military agree-
 ments were reached.  They may, however, have dis-
 cussed continuing differences over such issues as
 provision of spare parts and training.   (CONFIDEN-

 Yugoslav-Soviet Relations
 A  er the B je is Visit.
 Premier Bijedic's visit to the Soviet Union
 from April 9 to 15, during which he hit back at
 recent Soviet efforts to belittle the Yugoslav
 partisan resistance during World War II, was a
 qualified success.
 Bijedic carried Belgrade's resentment into
 the halls of the Kremlin itself where, in toasting
 his hosts, he pointedly referred to the unique role
 of the partisans in liberating Yugoslavia.  As a
 result, the final communique pays special tribute
 to the Yugoslav peoples for their struggle against
 fascism.  It also notes that both Yugoslavia and
 the Soviet Union made huge sacrifices during World
 War II.  Following his talks in Moscow, Bijedic
 drove Belgrade's point home in Leningrad and Kiev.
 Furthermore, he sniped at the Soviets by pointing
 out that the partisans received military aid from
 the Western allies before Soviet assistance arrived
 in 1944.
 Despite the communique's claim that the visit
 took place in a spirit of "friendship anc: mutual
 understanding," it is clear that other differences
 persisted.  On international problems, for example,
 the communique said only that the two sides had a
 "comprehensive exchange of views"--a formulation
 that implies disagreement on a number of issues. The
 one area where the two sides expressed satisfaction
 with bilateral relations was in economic relations.
 Moscow's handling of the 30th anniversary of
 victory in World War II, coming on the eve of the
 Bijedic visit, showed an almost complete lack of
 sensitivity to Yugoslav pride over the partisan war
 effort (Staff Notes, April 11 and 14).                25X1C

 25X1C                        tried to excuse the Kremlin's
 eavy- an a ness to a Western colleague by blaming
 Soviet military writers.  He  grudgingly admitted,
 however, that the blunder had prejudiced chances
 of Yugoslav participation in VE Day celebrations
 planned by the socialist countries.
 Although the Yugoslav press generally indicates
 satisfaction with the Bijedic visit, the articles
 stress that good bilateral relations depend on the
 adherence of both sides to previously agreed princi-
 ples.                             Indeed the communique specifically refers to
 the need for "mutual respect, sovereignty, full
 equality and non-interference in internal affairs."
 Yugoslav commentator Milika Sundic stressed these
 principles in his evaluation of the trip, warning
 that failure to live up to them is unacceptable to
 Belgrade and "cannot be useful for the Soviet Union."

 Force Reduction Talks Recess
 The fifth round of the force reduction talks
 ?             in Vienna ends tod,,y.  There- has been no progress
 in resolving basic differences, and the talks re-
 main stalemated.  They will resuma in mid-May.
 Both East and West marked t,    during this
 round.  The Soviets and their allies offered a
 revised scenario for negotiating their proposal
 of last October that called for initial reductions
 of 20,000 men by both. sides in 1975.   They also
 offered to amend slightly their basic proposal
 of November 1973.  Eastern representatives com-
 mented informally that they did not expect the
 West to take these proposals seriously  and were
 not surprised when the Western delegations re-
 jected them.
 Neither East nor West has shown signs during
 the round that they are overly disturbed by the
 lack of progress in Vienna.  The Soviets have never
 appeared to be under time pressure during the talks.
 Various Soviet officials have implied that there
 would be no movement in Vienna until the European
 security conference in Geneva concludes in a satis-
 factory manner.   In addition, there have been some
 indications that Moscow is aware that the West
 might substantially modify its basic proposals, and
 the Soviets apparently are content to await such an
 initiative.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/BACKGROUND

 Moscow Plans for China Without Mao
 Tao Soviet Union has apparently concluded that
 the course of the post-Mao power struggle will be
 protracted.  There is no entirely clear or con-
 sintent picture of the Soviet appraisal of the post-
 Mao years and there probably are differences among
 various bureaucracies about how best to deal with
 China, both now and in the future.  Nevertheless,
 certain broad outlines emerge, and running through
 these is a theme of hopefulness that the USSR will
 be able to influence the outcome in ways that will
 case Chinese hostility.
 Moscow sees all power in China as concentrated
 in the hands of Mao and three factions:  the leftists
 (usually associated with the Shanghai party organiza-
 tion), the moderates (those associated with Chou En-
 lai and the economic ministries), and the military,
 whose political power has been dramatically reduced
 but whose allegiance in the post-Mao period cannot
 yet be predicted. Mao is seen as in control, but
 not as all-powerful, acting as a sort of arbiter
 who imposes his policies on China by manipulating
 the factions that contend for his favor.
 China Immediately after Mao
 Soviet observe.   have at times claimed that
 the Cultural Revolution eroded power at the center
 any enhanced si3paratist tendencies in at least some
 regions of China.  For instance, one Soviet report
 in the summer of 1974 stated that "localist tendencies"
 had increased sharply in China.  By and large, how-
 ever, Soviet commentary plays down the prospect that
 China will break up during the post-Mao years.

 prolonged period of political instability at the
 center during which Mao's myrmidons will struggle

 with one another for pro-eminence.  This period
 will last, according to various Soviet observers,
 from seven to ten years, and no strong figure is
 expected to emerge from the upper echo ions of the
 present leadership.  By the and of this period,
 however, some as yet unknown figure will have con-
 solidated power into hie hands.
 Most Soviet observers feel that the leftists
 will have the initial advantage in the post-Mao
 period, but will not be able to consolidate this
 hold because they lack a strong base in the provinces
 and in the army, and have little practical adminis+.a-
 tive experience.  Thus, neither Wang Hung-wen or Yao
 Wen-yuan (long abused by Soviet propaganda) is expected
 to be able to fill Mao's shoes.  Chou En-lai is said
 to be regarded with suspicion by Mao and will not be
 able to rally sufficient forces to gain predominance.
 Other current leaders, such as Teng Hsiao-ping, are
 regarded with contempt by the Soviets and are not
 considered to have much staying power.
 In Moscow's view, the political struggle among
 these contending forces will result in a stalemate.
 New policies are not expected to be pursued with any
 consistency as the present generation of Chinese
 leaders kills itself off, politically if not physically.
 During these years of maneuver, however, Moscow will
 have opportunities to propose the expansion of commercial,
 cultural, and diplomatic relations.  These offers will
 be made primarily to show Soviet good will and to gain
 a sense of the direction of the political changes in
 China.  Because of the unsettled leadership struggle
 in China, however, the offers will be made primarily
 to probe Chinese intentions and to prepare the ground
 for more extensive actions when, in Moscow's view, the
 time is ripe.  The is little evidence in Soviet
 writings, or in t'. sir secret assessments, that a force-
 ful, or saber rattling policy is under serious considera-
 tion.

 Sino-Soviet Relations and Factions Within China
 Although Moscow noes little hope for improved
 relations with China in the immediate post-Mao
 years, over the longer run the Soviets are cau-
 tiously confident that China will brenk with Mao's
 hostility toward Moscow and that the two countries
 will be able to reach some sort of modus vivondi,
 perhaps even a relationship that can be labeled
 detente.   It is clear from secret Soviet documents
 that Moscow is convinced that there are significant
 forces in China that want to improve Sino-Soviet
 relations.   It is much less clear that their conviction
 is based on more than wishful thinking.  As one China
 watcher told a US embassy officer, "we know there are
 pro-Soviet voices, but we don't know who they are."
 Even classified Soviet assessments are notably lacking
 in specifics on who exactly are the pro-Soviet Chinese.
 Soviet optimism rests, in part, on the expectation
 that the new generation of Chinese lnadorn will view
 domestic imperatives and the outside world (including
 the Soviet Union) from quite different perspectives
 than the current leaders.  Moscow detects a considerable
 diversity of opinion beneath the surface in China and
 expects that in time new forces and ideas will emerge.
 Questions of domestic development, international economic
 relations, and Chinese relations with the Soviet Union
 are among the topics that are considered likely to be
 debated vigorously in the post-Mao years and to be
 answered in terms different from the current orthodoxy
 in Peking.
 This deduction flows from Moe jw's strong belief
 that such Maoist campaigns as the Jroat Leap and the
 Cultural Revolution, as well as Mao's anti-Sovietism,
 are inconsistent with Chinese needs.  Moscow is con-
 vinced that these policies have generated opposition
 within the party and the military which will come to the
 fore after Mao's demise, providing the opportunity for

 the sort of modernization the Soviet Union known

 Although Soviet commentary usually portrays
 the Chinese leadership an divided between radical
 and pragmatist, it appeart3 that Moscow down not
 regard theme labels an unefvl analytic tools.  In
 fact, it appearn that the UaSR does not see a great
 dual of substantive difference between the two fac-
 tionn on issues that will matter in the future.
 This is illustrated by the recent observation
 by a Soviet cjfricial                        that
 differences in China on the quen  on o  re ationn
 with the Soviet Union have nothing to do with the
