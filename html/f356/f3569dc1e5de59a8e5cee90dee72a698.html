NOTE: 
Political, sociological, and economic data, including monetary conversion 
rates, generally reflect information through mid-October 1972, except for population 
estimates, which have been projected to 1 January 1973. Military manpower estimates are 
as of 1 January 1973 except for average number of males reaching military age, which 
are projected averages for the 5-year period 1972-76. Military and communications data 
are as of 1 October 1972 unless otherwise indicated. 
Most of the land utilization estimates are rough approximations, and most of 
the statistical data are rounded (thousands and millions). Figures for "arable" may 
reflect only the area actually under crops rather than the potential cultivable. 
Fishing limits are included only when they differ from the territorial limits. 
For some countries GDP, rather than GNP, is shown. The difference between 
the two is in the addition or subtraction of the value of return on foreign investment. 
GDP equals GNP plus income earned in the country but sent abroad, minus income earned 
abroad but sent into the country. GDP thus tends to exceed GNP in debtor countries, 
ip and the reverse is true in creditor countries. 
Major ports are the largest maritime ports of the country, relative to other 
ports of the same country, on the basis of estimated port capacity, alongside berthing 
accommodations, and commercial or naval importance. Minor ports are the remaining 
ports of a country which have, relative to the major ports, significantly lower 
estimated port capactiy, fewer alongside berthing accommodations, are of less 
commercial or naval importance. Major transport aircraft are those weighing over 20,000 
pounds. Military budgets are in U.S. dollar equivalents. The dollar sign refers to 
U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. The abbreviation FY stands for U.S. fiscal year; 
all years are calendar years unless otherwise indicated.

ECONOMY: 
Economic activity in Gibraltar centers on commerce and large British naval and

port serves also as important supply depot for fuel, water, and ships' wares. 
Recently built dockyards and machine shops provide maintenance and repair 
services to 3,500-4,000 vessels that call at Gibraltar each year. 
U.K. military establishments and civil government employ nearly half the insured 
labor force. Local industry is confined to manufacture of tobacco, roasted 
coffee, ice, mineral waters, candy, and canned fish. Some factories for 
manufacture of clothing are being developed. A small segment of local 
population makes its livelihood by fishing. In recent years tourism has 
increased in importance.

Principal economic activities of San Marino are farming, livestock raising, light 
manufacturing, and tourism; the government's total budget for FY71 is about 
$12 million, with the largest share of revenue derived from the sale of 
postage stamps throughout the world and from payments by the Italian 
government in exchange for Italy's monopoly in retailing tobacco, gasoline, 
and a few other goods; main problem is finding an additional $3 million to 
finance badly needed water and electric power systems expansions

tons/year) and grapes (average annual output about 700 metric tons/year);

and hides are most important livestock products

Fiorentino, and pottery production at Borgo Maggiore; some tanned hides,

also produced 
Foreign transactions: dominated by tourism; in sumer months 20,000 to 30,000 
foreigners visit San Marino every day; a number of hotels and restaurants 
have been built in recent years to accomodate them; remittances from 
Sanmarinese abroad also represent an important net foreign inflow; comodity 
trade consists primarily of exchanging building stone, lime, wood, chestnuts, 
wheat, wine, baked goods, hides, and ceramics for a wide variety of consumer 
manufactures
