 of  masses  had Ito be kept in mind.  These differences were not merely racial,
 nor based on the relatively low ratio of Chinese intellectuals to the illit-
 erate millions.                          the answer was in the specific historical
 background of Chinese society and its fundamentally different nature.  The   50X1-HUM
 total number of intellectuals who had completed their higher education before
 the Communist take-over in China did not exceed one fourth of one percent of
 the population of the country.  This number included both those who had re-
 ceived their schooling in the country and those who were trained in foreign
 countries                                                              Assuming 50X1-HUM

 numbers of relatives were actually intimate members of the landowner's family,
 great numbers of persons were permitted to claim various degrees of kinship.
 Sometime there were several hundred such kinsmen, all of whom effectively served
 the landlord's purpose because they were invariably devoted and reliable workers
 or foremen on the family land.  Up to the time of the Communist take-over, these
 relatives derived certain personal advantages as members of an important or
 powerful family.

 with being corrupt criminals.  ClDaely associated with the Chinese landlords

 the importance of the Chinese landlord families in the past, their remnants were
 absorbed within the mass of Chinese agricultural workers.  Even though traditional
 landowner families had disappeared in current China, the small closely-knit family
 unit continued to exist.  The small units were formed on tradition and were
 characterized by mutual love of all their members.                               50X1-HUM

 since the Communist take-over in 194 .  When gaining political control, the
 Communists subjected the country to one reorganization after another for
 almost five years.  The situation during this period was chaotic.  Each of
 the various stages of Communist reorganization usually was directed against
 a specific target.
 a.  The campaign against corrupt government employees was known as the "Move-
 ment of the Three Evils."
 b.  The so-called "Movement of Five Evils" was directed against former corrupt
 businessmen who were known to have been involved in unscrupulous expolita-
 tion of the population.
 c.  The "tiger beating" which followed the previous two movements gave every
 Chinese citizen an opportunity publicly to accuse any officeholder or any
 other individual in his community, and the accused could also defend him-
 self in public against his accuser.
 d.  There were three other movements before the "Let all flowers blossom and
 let all schools of thoughts compete" was introduced by MAO Tse-tung in
 June 1956.  This era of relative political relaxation, which lasted only
 eight months, permitted criticism of the Communist system by the Chinese
 intellectual.
 e.  The situation changed suddenly                                  when the
 government initiated a merciless struggle against r g  -w ng bourgeois
 elements in China.                   Hungarian events
 inspired this movement, w  c   was directed against the right-wing
 intellectuals.
 there were three additional clear.A..V-  HUM

 so-called "Anti-Supervisors Movement," which was actually intended to do
 away with all non-Communist supervisors in nationalized institutions; the
 "Ten-Year Hardship Movement"; and the subsequent "Iron Melting" campaign

 for compulsory introduction of an extra four hours" daily work for all govern-
 ment office employees and compulsory Sunday work for all other workers.  The
 Communist pressure reached its peak
 7.  The impact of anti-American propaganda on the Chinese masses was a complete
 failure.  The average Chinese actually hated the Communists more than he hated
 the Americans or, for that matter, other foreigners.  In the past, some Chines 50X1-HUM
 actually suffered as a result of activities of the "whites" in China, so a
 certain amount of antiwhite feeling could be justified.
 the number of those who were wronged was so small that their in-
 fluence upon the present Chinese masses was negligible.  Quite naturally, the 50X1-HUM
 Chinese Communist regime focused all its propaganda activity on this small
 number of individuals in order to create the impression that all Chinese had
 been wronged, and all hated the "imperialists."  Since the Communists could not
 point to a single specific offense committed by "American imperialism" against
 China, they exerted every effort in their propaganda to discredit "the Americans"
 through association with the other "imperialists."
 8.   Since the Chinese masses had no access to any impartial or neutral sources of
 information, they were completely exposed to the pressures and distortions of

 the Communist propaganda machine.                                   the intel-
 lectuals were able to read some foreign press summaries, including U.S. and
 other anti-Chinese press reports, which dealt with prevailing conditions in
 China.  Such items were quoted without an      commen

 all those who were able to read the critical articles to defend the Communist
 Chinese road to socialism and to prove that the statements made in the foreign

 means of getting the intellectua s accus omed to making public statements which
 were contrary to their actual beliefs.                          if this was con-
 tinued over an extended period, eventua  y even highly-educated persons in  50X1 -HU M
 China would be so confused that, in. spite of any reluctance towards coopera-
 tion with the Communists, they would be turned into pawns which could be used
 to further the aims of Communist propaganda.

 forced cooperation with the Communists and free and independent individual
 support for the Communist cause.  The average worker in China might be compared
 with a man chained to an oar of a galley and not fed if he failed to pull his
 oar.  Judged only on the basis that the Communists had succeeded in fully
 chaining everybody in China to the oars, the regime had met with success.  In
 this respect Chinese Communist organizing talent was admirable.
 10.   Naturally the quality of work performed was low, but the quantity could not
 be overlooked.  Whereas the manual laborer in the West worked eight hours,
 his Chinese counterpart worked 12 hours daily in order to compensate for the
 lack of mechanization.  Soviet and other satellite specialists were exerting
 every effort to train large num bers of Ious workers, but they found the 50X1-HUM
 process both tedious and slow.                  the skilled workers and foremen
 could be compared to an aceompl s e  c au  eur who could drive but who knew
 nothing about the automobile engine.  In China today numerous newly-assembled
 power plants, steel mills, spinning mills and flour mills were supervised by
 one expert, who ran them with the help of semi-skilled, or semi-trained person-
 nel.  The fact that such a deficiency existed at present was no indication
 that China would not be able eventually to educate an adequate number of re-
 liable scientists and technicians with outside assistance.
 11.    Of the various foreign experts who were employed in training local technicians,
 the Soviet
 s were looked upon with most favor because they were humble and ever
 willing to help, and their simple work methods appealed to the unskilled Chinese
 work
 ers.  Even the most elementary technical operations had to be demonstr  e

 they were dealing with skilled workers.  In their demonstrations of various
 working methods they took for granted that the Chinese trainees posseRRRd A

 12.    An entirely different attitude prevailed insofar as Chinese engineers were con-
 cerned.  Most of these                     older generation, were educated in
 the West                                but not in the USSR.  To these experts,
 the Soviev.           s primitive approach to technical problems was usually un-
 acceptable.  On the other hand, the attitude of the lower-level Chine official towards the Soviets was cool but polite.                   the   50X1-HUM
 Chinese took advantage of the Soviet willingness to show      primitive   ow-
 how, whereas the East Germans were rather reluctant to disclose too much of their
 more advanced technical knowledge to the Chinese.

 13.              Although the number of technically trained individuals in China was not great,
 the average worker continued to differentiate between the older generation of
 technicians and engineers who were educated before the advent of Communism and
 the new technical experts who received their training after the Communist take-
 over.  Whereas the older generation of so-called "intellectual technical ex-
 perts," even though politically unimportant, was tolerated by the regime only
 because its members had specialized knowledge, the Chinese workers looked up
 to these experts because they remained the symbol of the Chinese past and be-
 cause practically all of them showed no enthusiasm for the new order.  On the
 other hand, the average worker detested the newly-trained younger Chinese tech-
 nicians who were trusted by the regime.

 CHCU En-lai exhibited a great deal of

 the  One Hundred Flowers Movement                            even though MAO
 Tse-tung was very popular among the Communists, he could never equal the pseudo-
 deification achieved by Stalin.
 15.    The average Chinese was a superstitious person, but he was not inclined to be-
 lieve in any concept compared to the Christian attitude towards God.  To the
 Chinese worker, a god had to be useful and tangible, since he was inclined to
 accept nothing which lay outside his world or within the sphere of heaven.
 The average Chinese, however, did have a fear of the unknown.  Being devoid of
 any special religious feelings, the worker had very little tenderness, but was
 capable of being sentimental for a limited timed  In addition, the Chinese was
 riot inclined to believe in personal sacrifice unless he could expect an appro-
 priate reward.  Even though he conformed temporarily to pressure, he continued

 doubted that any amount of effort on the part of the present Communist regime
 could either change or even influence the character of the Chinese people.   50X1-HUM
 16.   In the recent past, the Chinese masses appeared to exhibit most hatred for the
 Japanese.  On the other hand, they harbored neither special hatred nor particu-
 lar admiration for the "whites."  At present, the average Chinese individual
 was inclined to believe that "whites" were rich and through politeness to them
 Chinese might gain certain personal advantages.  The great mass of Chinese had
 never had any direct association or contact with "white people."  Practically
 none of the members of the lower class were capable of differentiating between
 the various nationalities; to the average Chinese  a Soviet was as much a
 "white" as an American.                                the so-called 90hate America"
 campaign was artifically   spired by the present regime, which incited the    50X1-H U M
 crowds at public rallies against the unknown phantom labelled "American imperi-
 alism."

 oppression continued to be directed at the Taoists because of their previous
 collaboration with Japan, participation in public graft, and extortion of money
 from their followers. Buddhism and Islam were regarded as imposed by the im-
 perialists for the sole purpose of exploiting the Chinese people.  The average
 Chinese convert was free to practice Christianity only as long as he dissociated
 himself from "foreign agents," i.e. missionaries.  Similarly, Roman Catholics
 were permitted to enjoy religious "freedom" as long as they complied with the
 government's demand to separate themselves from the Pope.  Naturally the Com-
 munists saw to it that the younger generation was educated along strict anti-
 religious lines.  All churches, which had had a record of collaborating with
 Japan or associating with the activities of warlords, continued to be main tar-
 gets of the Communist anti-religious propaganda.
