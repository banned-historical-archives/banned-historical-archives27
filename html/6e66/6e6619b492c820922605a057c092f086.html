 SOVIET PARTY CONGRESS   .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  1
 The temporary Sino-Soviet truce reached in November
 1960 has been shattered by developments at the 22nd; party
 congress.   The violent Soviet attacks on the Albanian re-
 gime have overshadowed the new Soviet party program and
 suggest that Khrushchev has chosen this issue to impose
 on Peiping a new test of strength in the continuing strug-
 gle for leadership of the international Communist movement.
 His revival of charges against the antiparty group is in-
 tended to link this issue with the "cult of personality"
 indictment against the Albanians--and, by implication,  the
 Chinese--leaders.   The proceedings of the congress provide
 further evidence that Khrushchev's position as leader of
 the Soviet Union is unassailable.   Peiping has already in-
 dicated that it will defend Albania, but will probably
 urge that the matter be settled in private discussions.
 Page  11.
 The USSR now appears to have placed itself firmly
 behind the Ulbricht regime's efforts to force US offi-
 cials to acknowledge the right of East German guards at
 the Friedrichstrasse checkpoint in East Berlin to exer-
 cise control over US-licensed vehicles driven by civil-
 ians.   As recently as 22 October Soviet officials in Ber-
 lin had indicated that the USSR still accepted the US
 position that US official license plates are sufficient
 identification in so far as East German police personnel
 are concerned.   At the Soviet party congress,  bloc lead-
 ers are avoiding polemical treatment of the Berlin and
 German issues pending continuation of exploratory talks
 with the United States.

 Viet Cong activity continued at record level last
 week, with most incidents occurring in the southern areas.
 The Communists are keeping up attacks to disrupt north-
 south communications routes,  but apparently are still
 concentrating on erosion of the Diem government's control
 at the village level.   Continuing rumors of coup plotting
 in Saigon point up discontent in high government and mili-
 tary circles.   Although there is no evidence of advanced
 planning, some elements may be considering the ouster
 of P;.?esident  Diem as one step toward a solution of the
 Viet Cong problem.

 Souvanna Phouma's efforts to expedite formation of a
 coalition government following his meeting with King Savang
 last week have encountered new obstacles.   Boun Oum has
 rejected Souvanna's proposal for another meeting of the
 three princes in Xieng Khouang to discuss the composition
 of the cabinet,  and Phoumi is again voicing doubts as to
 whether Souvanna would be able to form a "truly neutral"
 government.   At Geneva, Western and Communist representa-
 tives are still at odds over several key aspects of a
 treaty on Laos.
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Sihanouk's diplomatic break with Thailand gives the
 Communist bloc another chance to increase its influence
 in Cambodia.        Sihanouk has previously responded to slights
 from Thailand and South Vietnam by increasing his contacts
 with the bloc.   While he has frequently asserted that he
 is anti-Communist and that his country is neutral,  he be-
 lieves South Vietnam and Thailand are a more immediate
 threat than Communism.   Saigon and Bangkok view Cambodia
 as a weak link in Southeast Asian security.

 Tshombd on 24 October accepted the UN's conditions
 for ratification of the 13 October cease-fire agreement
 between UN and Katanga forces.   Implementation has pro-
 ceeded without incident,                              but strains between these forces
 and between Leopoldville and Elisabethville are likely to
 remain.   Adoula continues bent on bringing Katanga to heel
 and,  recognizing his own limited military capability,  is
 pressing for a new mandate for UN forces which would more
 clearly support this objective.   Gizenga,  in Stanleyville
 since 6 October, shows little inclination to return to
 Leopoldville,  and may be trying to rebuild a center of op-
 position in his provincial stronghold.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Apparently anticipating French insistence on a referendum,
 however, Ben Khedda expressed willingness to continue work-
 ing for a peaceful solution through this means.   Should
 De Gaulle announce prior to 1 November an intention to re-
 sume negotiations, it would have the effect of encouraging
 the Secret Army Organization to precipitate violent demon-
 strations by Europeans to counter the Moslem demonstrations
 scheduled for that date.

 Nasir is taking steps to eliminate the potential for
 a rightist coup in Egypt and to dramatize his determina-
 tion to press ahead with his socialist revolution.                                     In
 Lebanon the resignation of strongly pro-Nasir Prime Minis-
 ter Saib Salam may bring government changes which will in-
 hibit the freedom of Egyptian agents to run subversive op-
 erations into Syria from Lebanese territory.   The Jordanian
 Government staged its burlesque of free parliamentary elec-
 tions last week without serious incident, but resentment
 continues widespread, especially among the Palestinians
 on Jordan's West Bank.

 Although the USSR has not yet offered economic or
 military aid to the new Syrian Government, Moscow   probs.-
 blywould extend such assistance if requested.   The USSR
 apparently will continue work on projects under the $150,-
 000,000 economic credit granted prior to Syria's union
 with Egypt in early 1958.   Damascus has no known outstand-
 ing Soviet military aid credits.

 The bloc program to aid underdeveloped countries in
 establishing and expanding civil air facilities has been
 gaining momentum in recent months.   Several types of civil
 aircraft have been sold to Guinea, Ghana, Mali, Cuba, and
 India,  and in some of these countries the majority of
 transports operating on the national airlines were pur-
 chased from the bloc.   The underdeveloped countries have
 been receptive to bloc offers because of favorable prices

 The recent antigovernment rioting may have heightened
 sentiment in the armed forces for suppressing both leftist
 and moderate opposition groups and even for the restoration
 of a military regime.    The government made long-planned
 moves against pro-Castro leaders on 22 October but with
 only partial success; most of the leaders slated for depor-
 tation had gone into hiding.   The government has been suc-
 cessful in forcing Generals Arismendi and Hector Trujillo
 to leave the country, but no change in the position of
 General Ramfis Trujillo appears likely in the immediate
 future.   President Balaguer appealed on 23 October for an
 end to political rancor "in this moment of conciliation
 and concord,-                                                            25X1

 Rioting has broken out in Bolivia following the impo-
 sition of higher prices for gasoline and fuel oil,                                     an often-
 postponed measure which the  International Monetary Fund has
 insisted is essential for 'the stabilization program.                   The
 government, which had evidently been hoping that its re-
 cent "discovery" of a revolutionary plot would distract
 public attention from the decree,  declared a state of siege
 in the capital on 21 October and imposed domestic press
 censorship.   The rioting does not appear to pose an imme-
 diate threat to President Paz'  administration,  but furthei
 violence is likely.
 BACKGROUND OF THE BLOC'S DISPUTE WITH ALBANIA   . ,  .  .  .  .   Page  1
 During the past year,  the USSR and the satellites
 have attempted,  through political,  economic, and psycho-
 logical pressures,  to get Albania to conform to Khru-
 shchev's international and party policies.   In an effort
 to compensate for their growing isolation from the Soviet
 bloc,  Albanian leaders have developed closer relations
 with Communist China and have extended economic feelers
 to the West.
 Domestic dissatisfaction with the Castro regime is
 increasing,  but is not believed to have reached a level
 where it is a serious threat to the government.   The anti-
 Castro forces now include more people than before from the
 lower classes,  although the majority in this group still
 supports Castro.   The Castro regime has a hard core of
 fanatical backers and a large and efficient apparatus
 of repression.

 Nehru, when he returns to the United States on 5 No-
 vember, will be eager to explore international issues with
 President Kennedy, but the line Nehru takes is likely to be
 based firmly on the neutralist policy he has always felt
 best served India's national interest.   The  Indian leader's
 emphasis on negotiation and compromise as essential to ease
 cold war tensions stems largely from his fear that war
 would jeopardize  India's economic development.   India today
 is marked by relative political stability and steady eco-
 nomic progress,  but regional and religious antagonisms
 persist,  the ruling Congress party is weakened by faction-
 alism and inertia,  and the economy will be hampered for
 some time by unemployment,  inflation,  and a scarcity of
 industrial power.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 WEEKLY REVIEW
 SOVIET PARTY CONGRESS
 What was billed in advance
 as the congress to outline the
 bright future of the USSR and
 the "socialist commonwealth"
 has been transformed into a
 sordid recounting of the strug-
 gle between Khrushchev and his
 opponents in the party and a
 public unveiling of the smolder-
 ing dispute between Khrushchev
 and his bloc opponents.   Khru-
 shchev's decision to turn in-
 stead to the long-dead ""anti-
 party group" issue and the
 critical question of Soviet
 authority in the bloc is re-
 lated to Khrushchev's success
 and failure in his dual role
 as Soviet leader and head of
 the international Communist
 movement.
 In the former role,.Khru-
 shchev is celebrating his
 assumption of complete power
 in the USSR, where his position
 now appears unassailable.   His
 close political lackeys have
 appeared at the 22nd congress
 in important roles for no
 other reason than their personal
 association with Khrushchev--
 much in the manner of Stalin's
 appointment of his own palace
 guard to the central committee.
 Khrushchev's review of the
 details of the conflict with
 the antiparty group,  together
 with the strictures against
 the group by other Soviet
 leaders,  are intended as a
 testimony to the magnitude of
 his victory.   Equally important,
 Khrushchev is also proclaiming
 the validity of the policies
 which the group opposed.   As
 leader of the Communist party
 of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev
 has succeeded in molding the
 party, its policies, and its
 intended course in his own
 image.
 If Khrushchev's victory
 over the party is complete in-
 side the USSR, however, his
 position as leader of the
 international movement has been
 marred by failure.   The Chinese
 challenge to his authority,
 Albania's support for that
 challenge, and its own subsequent
 and successful defiance of the
 USSR had considerably weakened
 Moscow's authority in the Com-
 munist world.   In November and
 December 1960 Khrushchev had
 been forced to compromise in the
 interest of unity, but the fragile
 accord that was reached was
 clearly regarded by both the
 Chinese and the Russians as a
 temporary truce rather than a
 definitive settlement.   Khru-4
 shchev apparently has decided
 that the time has come to attempt
 to redress the balance.
 Sino-Soviet Relations
 The Soviet leaders' violent
 attacks on the Hoxha regime in
 Albania, which have completely
 overshadowed even the new So-
 viet party program at the congress,
 suggest that Khrushchev has
 deliberately' chosen this issue
 to impose on Peiping a new test
 of strength in the continuing
 struggle for leadership in the
 international Communist movement.
 With characteristic boldness,
 he has moved to turn to his
 advantage the embarrassing
 situation posed by Albania's
 successful defiance of Soviet
 pressures to strike a blow at
 the Chinese leaders.   He is
 attempting to place Peiping
 on the defensive at the outset
 by branding the Albanian leaders
 as deviationists, hoping to
 confront the Chinese with the
 alternatives of acquiescing in
 the  Soviet  indictment  or

 reaffirming their support of
 a regime declared to be hereti-
 cal and threatened with expul-
 sion from the "socialist camp."
 Khrushchev probably antici-
 pated that the Chinese would,
 in fact, have no choice but to
 respond to his challenge because
 Chinese silence in the face of
 the Soviet assault would rep-
 resent  a major victory for
 the Soviet party and confirm
 its unquestioned supremacy in
 the "socialist world."  He
 hopes to exploit Peiping's sup-
 port of the Hoxha regime, which
 he has accused of "departing
 from the generally agreed line
 of the whole world Communist
 movement" and reverting to
 Stalinist practices,  to dis-
 credit Peiping's claims to a
 co-equal voice in determining
 world Communist strategy and
 orthodoxy, and to demonstrate
 China's complete isolation in
 the "socialist commonwealth."
 Khrushchev also hopes the out-
 come of this new phase of the
 Sino-Soviet contest will make
 it more difficult in the future
 for Peiping to challenge Soviet
 leadership and to develop a
 rival center of authority.
 Although Khrushchev in any
 event would have felt obliged
 at the party congress to take
 up the question of Albanian de-
 fiance,  the concentrated vio-
 lence of the assault on the
 Hoxha regime far transcends
 the immediate issue of Soviet-
 Albanian relations.   It clearly
 points to a decision to force
 a showdown with the Chinese on
 carefully chosen terrain on
 which Khrushchev believes he
 will command a heavy advantage.
 The replacement of Soviet
 political, military, and
 economic influence in Albania
 by the Chinese posed a challenge
 to Moscow's authority and
 control in the Soviet bloc and
 the international Communist
 movement which could not be
 ignored indefinitely.  The
 failure of the Soviet attempt
 to overthrow the Hoxha regime
 in the summer of 1960 was a
 serious setback for the USSR
 which had far-reaching implica-
 tions for its hegemony in
 Eastern Europe.   China's sub-
 sequent actions in extending
 strong political support and
 increasing economic assistance
 to the Albanians made an eventual
 Soviet counter-offensive inevitable.
 Khrushchev now has decided that
 the opportune moment has arrived
 to reassert the unquestioned
 supremacy of the Soviet party
 over the bloc and the world
 Communist movement.
 He may believe China's
 grave economic difficulties and
 agricultural disasters have
 reduced Peiping's ability to
 resist Soviet political pressure.
 The Chinese industrialization
 program was seriously disrupted
 by the withdrawal of the Soviet
 technicians, and the USSR has
 declined to extend any significant
 assistance over the past year.
 Chou En-lai,  however,  intimated
 in his speech to the Soviet
 congress that the firmness of
 China's ideological position
 would not be affected by its
 need for Soviet economic as-
 sistance.   He asserted,as Chinese
 leaders have since the Soviet
 withdrawal of technicians in
 1960, that China could surmount
 its current difficulties by
 relying on the "work of our own
 hands."
 Despite Chou En-lai's
 calculated displays of dis-
 pleasure,  Khrushchev has gone out
 of his way to make a cynical
 display of politeness to-the
 Chinese delegation in Moscow.
 His motivation is probably two-
 fold: by ostentatiously shaking
 Chou's hand after his speech
 and seeing him off at the air-
 port, Khrushchev hopes to make
 it appear that his attacks are
 really against Albania and not
 China, and these gestures provide
 him with a basis for later claiming,

 if it becomes necessary,  that
 he "did everything possible"
 to maintain Sino-Soviet unity.
 At the same time,  Moscow has
 made it clear that Chinese
 behavior has not been that of
 a "comradely" country.   A tele-
 cast of the congress proceedings
 on 19 October showed Chou shak-
 ing hands with Kozlov and
 Kosygin,  ignoring Khrushchev
 who stood between them.
 Chou En-lai's reproach of
 Khrushchev at the party congress
 for airing the Albanian issue
 and his early departure from
 Moscow reflect the Chinese
 leaders' recognition of the
 gravity of the Soviet challenge.
 Chou was met at Peiping airport
 by Mao Tse-tung and seven other
 politburo members--apparently
 a deliberate move to show ap-
 proval of Chou's stand at the
 congress and to demonstrate
 Chinese solidarity.   The members
 of the Chinese delegation who 1
 remained at the congress are
 currently touring Leningrad,
 probably awaiting the outcome
 of politburo deliberations in
 Peiping to hammer out the
 details of the Chinese response.
 The decision now being
 worked out in Peiping may fol-
 low the lines set forth in a
 Chinese Foreign Ministry docu-
 ment sent last January to
 embassies for their guidance.
 It noted that since bloc unity
 was to be the regime's basic
 objective in 1961,  the Chinese
 would not take the initiative
 to reopen the debate but would
 not back down if again con-
 fronted with "erroneous thinking
 inside the international Com-
 munist movement."   It specifi--
 tcall y a f f firmed that Peiping would
 give "all-out" political and
 economic support to Albania.
 Chou En-lai's remark in
 his brief speech to the party
 congress that "open and one-
 sided" criticism of a fraternal
 party could not be regarded as
 a serious Marxist-Leninist
 approach was a clear rebuke of
 Khrushchev.   His further in-
 sistence that the principle of
 consultation and full equality
 among bloc members should be
 observed suggests the course
 that Peiping will probably adopt
 in its defense of Tirana.   This
 course will incorporate the high
 moral stand urged by Chou in
 March 1957 to "reserve differences
 while upholding solidarity."  If
 Khrushchev continues to force
 the Albanian issue, however,'.the
 Chinese appear ready to respond
 with the belligerence that
 characterized their arguments
 at the height of the Sino-Soviet
 dispute in 1959 and 1960.
 There are indications,  in
 fact, of a developing view in
 Peiping that Khrushchev has
 already pressed matters to the
 point where a strong response
 is necessary and that any further
 effort to cover up the dispute
 would be futile.   Up to 26
 October,  the Chinese while making
 their sympathies for Albania
 clear, had given little press or
 radio coverage to the Moscow
 conference, where attacks on
 Albania were the order of the
 day.   On 26 October, however,
 People's Daily publicized the
 full   e l a - 1 s of the charges
 against Albania made by Khru-
 shchev and delegates from other
 Communist parties, along with
 the angry reply. of the Albanian
 central committee.
 The next phase of the
 contest may be a post-congress
 meeting of bloc parties or all
 Communist parties, and Chou
 En-lai may return to Moscow
 after his consultations with

 claimed,   Reactions from other

 indication of the probable
 groupings that would develop at
 an international Communist
 meeting.
 The European satellites,
 Mongolia, and most Western
 Communist parties have associated
 themselves clearly and forceful-
 ly with the Soviet attack on
 Albania.  The European satellites
 in their domestic propaganda
 have made it clear that the
 preferred course would be for
 Albania to demonstrate the
 proper contrition and thus
 maintain bloc unity, but they
 have also indicated the improb-
 ability of such a course and
 have begun to prepare public
 and party opinion for whatever
 actions may be taken against
 Tirana.   Ulbricht's accusation
 in his speech on 20 October
 that Albania bad "grossly vio-
 lated ...joint decisions of the
 Warsaw Pact" suggests that
 Albania may even be formally
 expelled from that body.
 Many of the Asian parties,
 however,  have failed to give
 the Soviet Union this kind of
 support and have indicated
 varying degrees of reserve.
 On the basis of TASS summaries
 --which may not reflect all the
 nuances of the delegates' remarks
 --it appears that North Korea
 and North Vietnam among the
 bloc parties declined to echo
 the Soviet charges against
 Albania.  The Indian, Indonesian,
 and Japanese parties have also
 been silent on the Albanian
 issue.   The North Koreans,  how-
 ever, and perhaps some of the
 others as well, carefully
 hedged their silence on Albania
 with intimations of their
 interest in seeing a spirit of
 compromise and concession in
 Tirana.
 "Antiparty Group" Charges
 A major purpose of Khru-
 schev's revival of  charges
 against the Soviet antiparty
 group is to establish a clear link
 between this issue and the "cult
 of personality" indictment against
 the Albanian--and, by implication,
 the Chinese--leaders.   The speeches
 by Khrushchev and his top colleagues
 have centered on accusations that
 the antiparty group "fiercely
 opposed" de-Stalinization and
 desired a return to the repressive
 measures of the Stalin era.
 Malenkov, Molotov, Kaganovich,
 and Voroshilov have been charged
 with personal responsibility for
 many of Stalin's crimes.
 In addition, the antiparty
 group is indicted with failing to
 assess correctly the international
 scene, and the examples of their
 failure bear a striking resemblance
 to the positions held by the
 Chinese and Albanian leaders.
 Molotov, for example, was con-
 demned by Mikoyan for opposing
 the policy of peaceful coexistence
 and for conceding the inevitability
 of war.   Mikoyan's assertion that
 Molotov regarded peaceful co-
 existence as the  temporary absence
 of war and opposed personal meet-
 ings of top leaders of Fast and
 West is close to a description
 of charges against Mao's advocacy
 of a militant interpretation of
 peaceful coexistence.   Thus the
 present leadership's condemnations
 of the policies which Khrushchev
 defeated in the USSR when he
 foiled the plots of the anti-
 party group are but thinly veiled
 attacks on the vestiges of those
 same policies which continue to
 exist in Communist China and
 Albania.
 Pains are being taken,
 however, to deny that resurrec-
 tion of the antiparty group
 issue reflects a fresh challenge
 to Khrushchev's leadership.   First
 Deputy Premier Kosygin said,"We
 are doing this now to show again
 to the party and the people where
 the personality cult can lead....
 We want the lessons of history
 never to be forgotten."  Leonid

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Ilichev,  the party's agitation
 and propaganda boss, made it
 clear that criticism of the
 "cult of personality" should
 not be confused with the
 authority of present leaders.
 He flatly warned that the party
 would do its utmost to protect
 the authority of those who were
 "devoting all their energies"
 to the cause of Communism.
 This treatment is clearly
 designed to strengthen Khru-
 shchev's position as the supreme
 authority of Communist orthodoxy
 in the coming contest with
 Peiping by attempting to disarm
 in advance any Chinese counter-
 claims that Khrushchev himself
 is vulnerable to the same
 charges he has directed against
 the antiparty group.   At the
 same time,  the attacks on the
 old Stalinists have the effect
 of demonstrating to the Soviet
 people how much better off they
 have been under Khrushchev and,
 indirectly,  to pay tribute to
 the man who prevented a return
 to Stalinist terror by smashing
 the group.
 Both this and the open
 adulation of Khrushchev are
 aimed at bolstering still
 further the image of the Soviet
 party chief as the legitimate
 successor to Lenin.   Virtually
 all congress speakers have
 contributed to the burgeoning
 "cult of Khrushchev."  To
 date,  the  high point in the
 adulation of Khrushchev is
 Defense Minister Malinovsky's
 reference  to Khrushchev as
 "our supreme commander-in-chief"--
 an appellation no Soviet leader
 has enjoyed since Stalin assumed
 the title "Generalissimo" in
 the early days of World War II.
 Foreign Policy Implications
 While it is too early
 to assess the effects of this
 new demonstration of bloc dis-
 unity on Soviet tactics on Berlin
 and Germany, there is no indica-
 tion that it will cause Khrushchev
 to reduce his demands on the
 Western powers or retreat from
 his intention to sign a separate
 peace treaty with East Germany.
 The relaxation of his year-end
 deadline on a treaty will give
 Khrushchev greater freedom of
 maneuver in dealing with the
 West,  but it is unlikely that
 this move was dictated by his
 decision to join issue with
 the Chinese on Albania and the
 "cult of personality."..
 Khrushchev has firmly
 restated his commitment to the
 peaceful coexistence strategy,
 which includes negotiations and
 contacts with Western leaders.
 Any retreat from this general
 line would be interpreted
 throughout the Communist world
 as a concession to the Chinese.
 The high stakes involved in this
 intra-bloc struggle, however,
 may well compel Khrushchev to
 subordinate policy considerations
 vis-a-vis the West to the over-
 riding demands of prosecuting

 his new drive against the
 Chinese Communists.
 Economic Developments
 Economic   discussion  at
 the   congress   has continued
 to  center  on problems  of
 efficient   planning  and manage-
 ment   of the                 large and complex
 construction  program.   Kosy-
 gin's speech                  proposed   some
 new  measures  to  increase
 the  efficiency   of  the con-
 struction  program.                       The
 program  has  long   been  ham-
 pered           by the          fact that  the
 construction  material  and
 production  equipment industries
 have  not kept   pace  with
 the  volume of building;
 moreover, the system  has
 failed  to provide  incentives
 for  timely   completion of
 projects. Investment    has
 been  spread thinly  among too
 many   projects  instead of
 being   concentrated  on   the
 important ones; as a result,
 construction   is prolonged.
 Kosygin   repeated   some
 of   the  standard  admonitions
 of the  past:   planning of new
 construction will be closely
 linked  with   the provision
 of  supplies   of materials
 and  equipment; funds must be
 earmarked  primarily  for proj-
 ects about                                                              to be completed;
 new projects  will   be  allowed
 only  when  similar    projects,
 already  under way,  have   suf-
 ficient                                                                resources for     their
 completion; incentive awards
 will be tied to the completion
 of projects.
 Kosygin also   indicated
 some new measures  may be
 tried.   To ensure  timely
 receipt  of equipment   at con-
 struction sites,                                                                   payment may
 be withheld  until the  equip-
 ment  is actually                                                              placed
 in  operation.  He  also  sug-
 gests  as an                                                          "experiment" a
 transition  from budgetary
 financing  of capital  invest-
 ment  to long-term credits.
 Funds  could therefore  be
 firmly   earmarked   for specific
 construction  projects  rather
 than parceled  out  in an-
 nual  plans.                                                            Kosygin's  re-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SdJIM1,  RY
 Since 15 October,  the U1-
 bricht regime has made a syste-
 matic effort to force US offi-
 cials to acknowledge the right
 of East German guards at the
 Friedrichstrasse checkpoint in
 East Berlin to exercise control
 over US-licensed vehicles driven
 by civilians.   At the outset,
 Soviet authorities appear to
 have made an attempt to disso-
 ciate themselves from the East
 German actions; on 25 October,
 however, the USSR indicated that
 it was firmly backing the East
 German claims.
 US officials maintain that
 US official license plates are
 in themselves sufficient identi-
 fication as far as the East Ger-
 mans are concerned.   In accord-
 ance                 with long-established prac-
 tice and US rights under the
 occupation agreements, tine US
 takes the position that only So-
 viet officials may control move-
 ments of US personnel, whether
 uniformed or not.   In contrast
 to the Americans and the French,
 the British have been in the
 habit for several years of flash-
 ing identification documents when
 requested, but they have never
 actually handed them over to the
 East German guards.
 Sector Border Incidents
 The first serious incidents
 occurred on 15 October, when
 East German guards on four oc-
 casions refused to pass US-
 licensed vehicles operated by
 civilians.   In one case, they
 subsequently permitted one ve-
 hicle to pass the checkpoint
 after a uniformed driver took
 the wheel.
 On 17 October,  US political
 Adviser Howard Trivers called
 upon the Soviet political ad-
 viser,  Lt.  Col. Lazarev,  to pro-
 test the incidents and outline
 the US case.   Lazarev, unusually
 courteous, said Soviet authori-
 ties lacked adequate descriptions
 of US official license plates.
 He thought everything would be
 all right if US authorities
 would supply complete sets of
 descriptions and photographs
 of plates currently in use by
 US personnel.   He said he would
 undertake to see that facsimiles
 were provided to East German
 authorities at the Friedrich-
 strasse checkpoint as well as
 to Soviet officials at the
 Marienborn checkpoint on the
 Autobahn.
 In the light of Lazarev's
 implicit recognition of Western
 rights of free circulation in
 Berlin, Trivers after the
 meeting immediately forwarded
 the necessary information on
 US license plates.
 Despite Lazarev?s assurances
 to Trivers,  further incidents
 occurred in which East German
 sector border guards refused
 to permit US civilians to pass
 through the Friedrichstrasse
 checkpoint without showing
 identification,
 On 22 October, the East
 Germans demanded identification
 from E. Allen Lightner, assistant
 chief of the US Mission in Ber-
 lin,   After long delays and fail-
 ure by the East German guards to
 summon a Soviet officer, as re-
 quested by Lightner,  the American
 commandant in Berlin dispatched
 an armed escort of US military
 police to escort Lightner into
 East Berlin.   Lightner and his
 escort twice went into the Soviet
 sector and withdrew.
 Soon afterward,  Lazarev
 arrived at the Friedrichstrasse

 to pass only after showing their
 passports and claimed that "per-
 sons in civilian clothes"..were
 trying to evade these regula-
 tions without "proving" member-
 ship in the Western occupation
 forces
 On 24 October, East German
 guards on two occasions turned
 back US-licensed vehicles driven
 by officials in civilian clothes.
 On the second occasion,  the US
 provost marshal drove to the
 scene but was unable to induce
 East German police to let the
 automobile pass.  The following
 day the East Germans again
 halted a US vehicle.  When the
 US provost marshal demanded a
 Soviet officer be summoned im-
 mediately, the East German guard
 declared that the regime does
 not recognize US license plates.
 Trivers then telephoned So-
 viet headquarters to demand a
 Soviet officer.  A new Soviet
 political adviser, Col. Alekseyev,
 arrived, accompanied by.Lazarev.
 Alekseyev took a belligerent
 tone with US officials from the
 outset.  He told the US provost
 marshal that the East German
 government had made a decision
 not to recognize license plates
 of US forces and repeated  this
 assertion to Triversm  Lazarev,
 moreover,, denied he had given
 Trivers assurance on 17 October
 of no further difficulties.
 When the US provost marshal
 warned that an armed escort
 would be sent to shepherd the
 American vehicle into Berlin,
 Alekseyev declared:   "No, you
 won't!"  Nevertheless, US
 military police escorted the
 car into East Berlin and back
 without interference.
 Major General Watson, Ameri-
 can commander in Berlin, saw
 Soviet commandant Solovyev that
 afternoon to protest the series
 of incidents.   Solovyev strongly
 backed East Germany's claim to
 the right to exercise controls
 at the sector border and main-
 tained that Soviet authorities
 cannot influence or interfere
 with East German actions there.
 He rejected General Watson's
 contention that the license
 plate was adequate identifica-
 tion and demanded that civilians
 henceforth show their identi-
 fication documents.
 While Watson was conferring
 with Solovyev, the East Germans
 halted two US Army sightseeing
 buses and demanded that the
 civilian occupants identify
 themselves.  Although the East
 Germans heretofore have asked
 for identification from such
 clearly marked vehicles, they
 have not actually denied entry.
 On 26 October, the East
 Germans again attempted to deny
 entry into East Berlin to a US-
 licensed vehicle, and again mili-
 tary police escorted the car from
 the Soviet sector.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Bloc Comment on Berliai
 In contrast to the bellig-
 erent behavior of the Commu-
 nists at the Berlin sector
 border, Soviet and bloc leaders
 have continued to follow Khru--
 shchev's lead in avoiding ex-
 tensive polemical treatment of
 Berlin and Germany pending fur-
 ther exploratory talks with the
 US in Moscow.   In his speech
 to the party congress on 25
 October, Foreign Minister Gromyko
 stressed that the Soviet Union
 would spare no efforts to "find
 a common language with the
 Western powers on the question
 of a German peace treaty."  At
 the same time he warned that
 the bloc would conclude a peace
 treaty with East Germany if it
 proved. impossible to reach
 agreement with the Western
 powers.   His statements on So-
 viet policy also reflected the
 more moderate line toward the
 West which marked Khrushchev's
 initial address on 17 October.
 Gromyko emphasized that So-
 viet foreign policy had been
 successful because of its "flex-
 ibility and desire to take into
 consideration the interests of
 partners in talks."   He also
 claimed that the meeting between
 President Kennedy and Khrushchev
 in Vienna was "one of the most
 outstanding events o   our time,"
 and went to some lengths to
 point up "the great importance"
 the Soviet Government attached
 to the state of its relations
 with the US.
 Both First Deputy Premier
 Mi.toyan and East German party
 leader Ulbricht stressed the
 urgency of a peace settlement
 with Germany but without men-
 tioning a deadline.   Like Khru-
 shchev,  Mikoyan and Ulbricht
 claimed that there had been
 some shifts in the position of
 the West,  and Mikoyan attributed
 this to Khrushchev's efforts.
 Ulbricht stated that "it is a
 very good thing" that tallL;s
 had begun between the US and
 USSR.   He warned,  however,  that
 Paris and Bonn aimed at post-
 poning negotiations in order
 to gain time for equipping West
 Germany with atomic weapons.
 In line with the general de-
 emphasis of Berlin at the Soviet
 party congress,  the Polish and
 Czech party leaders, Gomulka
 and Novotny,  in their speeches
 mentioned these issues in a
 brief pro forma manner.
 A Soviet official in Paris
 who returned from Moscow on 20
 October told an American repre-
 sentative that the question of
 access to Berlin could easily
 be solved by a four-power agree-
 ment guaranteeing free access.
 He stressed that this was of
 minor importance to the "main
 interest" of the USSR in obtain-
 ing a peace treaty with both
 Germanys, which would confirm
 the Oder-Neisse line and recog-
 nize the existing border between
 East and West Germany.   While
 he noted the importance of an
 early four-power foreign minis-
 ters' conference,  the Soviet
 spokesman also stated that the
 conference could not be called
 to deal only with Berlin but
 should have as its main purpose
 the preparation of a German peace
 conference.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Several top officials are
 becoming more openly critical
 of Diem's methods of rule and
 apparently feel that reforms
 must be forced on him.   Vice
 President Tho commented to the
 Taylor mission that popular
 morale could easily be revived
 if the government worked prop-
 erly.
 Viet Cong activity during
 the week ending 20 October sur-
 passed the previous week's
 high, with most incidents occur-
 ring in the southern prov-
 inces.   Reports--still uncon-
 firmed--that guerrilla forces
 are concentrated around the
 Saigon area may be related
 to the rumors of coup plots
 as well as of intended raids
 by terrorists in connection
 with the National Day period.
 Rail sabotage near Phan
 Thiet on 22 October and a re-
 ported attack at An Kh6, on
 the highway linking Pleiku in
 the central highlands with the
 coast at Qui Ngon,  point to
 a continued drive by the Viet
 Cong against north-south land
 communications.   The Viet
 Cong's failure to hold key
 points gained in large-scale
 actions suggests that these
 are still largely diversionary
 raids and that the Communists
 continue to concentrate on
 erosion of government control
 at the village level.
 Boun Oum's rejection of
 Souvanna's proposal for a meet-
 ing of the three princes in
 Xieng Khouang has dimmed pros-
 pects for the early establish-
 ment of a coalition government
 in Laos.   General Phoumi ex-
 plained this action on the
 grounds that the royal govern-
 ment had made "all concessions
 possible" toward the achieve-
 ment of a satisfactory coali-
 tion,           and that it was "now up
 to Souvanna to form a govern-
 mento"   Once again, Phoumi,
 convinced that Souvanna is dom-
 inated by the Pathet Lao,  is
 doubting the wisdom of forming
 a Souvanna-controlled coalition
 government and would prefer
 to postpone--or,  if possible,
 prevent--the creation of such
 a coalition.
 Vientiane forces have
 continued limited sweep opera-
 tions in northern Laos,  and in
 the Thakhek region of central
 Laos are preparing to mount a
 counterattack in an effort to
 regain territory recently lost
 to the rebels.   Meo units have
 continued their harassment of
 enemy forces throughout Xieng
 Khouang Province.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Cambodia's decision on 23
 October to sever diplomatic re-
 lations with Thailand resulted
 directly from a thinly veiled
 public attack on Prince Sihanouk
 by Prime. Minister Sarit:', o
 Thailand on 20 October.   The
 Thai Government has closed the
 Thai-Cambodian border mili-
 tarily and reinforced its bor-
 der guard,   Cambodia, on its
 part,  has canceled all mili-
 tary leaves and recalled all
 military personnel to their
 units.   The break in relations
 gives the Communist bloc another
 chance to improve its standing
 in Cambodia.
 Prince Sihanouk, who con-
 siders himself anti-Communist,
 is more fearful of Thai and
 South Vietnamese aggression
 than he is of Communist  incur-
 sions from Laos and North Viet-
 nam or subversion by Communist
 China.   In his efforts to pre-
 serve his country's neutrality,
 he usually balances his periodic
 outbursts against Western in-
 stitutions, such as SEATO, with
 criticisms of the Communist
 bloc.  However, whenever his
 relations with his two neigh-
 bors become strained, Sihanouk,
 who considers the West closely
 identified with the interests
 of Saigon and Bangkok, tends
 to align his country more close-
 ly with the bloc.
 Since the Geneva Agree-
 ments of 1954, both Thailand
 and South Vietnam have made no
 secret of their view that Cam-
 bodia is a weak link in South-
 east Asian security.   In 1956,
 Sihanouk, accusing his neighbors
 of trying to strangle Cambodia
 economically, accepted a $22,-
 400,000 grant from Peiping.   In
 October, he expelled the Chinese
 Nationalist consular representa-
 tive from Phnom Penh.
 By November 1958, tensions
 over a disputed border temple
 and Thai criticism of Cambodia's
 relations with the bloc caused
 Sihanouk to "temporarily suspend"
 diplomatic relations with Thai-
 land for three months.
 During the period leading
 to an abortive coup attempt in
 early 1959, the bloc's standing
 in Cambodia was boosted by ef-
 forts of the Chinese Communist
 Embassy in Phnom Pehh to keep
 Sihanouk informed of South Viet-
 namese involvement.   Saigon's
 revival of South Vietnamese
 claims to small islands off the
 Cambodian coast in 1960 resulted
 in a carte blanche offer of aid
 from Peiping in the event of
 hostilities.   Sihanouk has used
 this offer as a diplomatic weap-
 on, but so far has refused to
 accept bloc military assistance.
 Penn Nouth,  Cambodia's
 first minister, has informed
 both the Chinese Communist am-
 bassador in Phnom Penh and Am-
 bassador Trimble that while
 Cambodia seeks no war with
 Thailand,  if the country is in-
 vaded the government will ask
 for help everywhere, even from
 the "Reds."  If Cambodians are
 forced to choose, he asserted,
 they would rather become "slaves"
 to Communist China than to their
 enemies, the Thais.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY`,.
 Tshombe on 24 October ac-
 cepted the UN's conditions for
 ratification of the cease-fire
 concluded on 13 October be-
 tween UN and Katangan forces
 The exchange of prisoners has
 taken place without incident,
 and UN and Katangan forces are
 in process of re-positioning
 their forces as agreed.
 Pressed by Premier Adoula
 and the Congo Advisory Com-
 mittee, UN officials in New
 York insisted that Tshombe
 acknowledge:   (1)   that the
 cease-fire agreement did con-
 travene existing UN resolutions
 on the Congo;  (2) that it was
 a military agreement without
 political implications;  (3)
 that it applied only to Katanga;
 and (4) that it in no way af-
 fected the Congo's territorial
 limits as previously under-
 stood by the UN.  These con-
 ditions induced Leopoldville
 to withdraw its initial re-
 jection of the agreement.   How-
 ever, differences over Article
 10, which gave Tshombd the
 right to defend himself from
 "external" attack and appeared
 to neutralize the UN forces in
 that event, seem  to have been
 glossed over.
 Strains betuaen Leopold-
 ville and Elisabethville are
 unlikely to be substantially
 lessened.  Adoula continues
 bent on bringing Katanga to
 heel and appears to be working
 to obtain a new UN mandate
 which would specifically permit
 military action by UN forces
 to end Katanga's secession.
 On 17 October, Foreign Minister
 Bomboko argued to UN officials
 that the cease-fire strengthened
 Tshombb and that Leopoldville
 would have to take military
 action, since the Adoula govern-
 ment could survive only if Ka-
 tanga were brought back into
 the Congo.
 Leopoldville has only
 limited military capabilities,
 however, and would have enor-
 mous equipment and transport
 problems in any Katanga
 invasion.   Successful action
 by Leopoldville would require
 close support from UN forces.
 Pressures for a new, more
 "energetic" mandate for UN
 forces in the Congo are re-
 portedly growing in the  UN
 General Assembly.
 Tshombg,  under pressure
 from the UN, sent two low-
 level emissaries to Leopold-
 ville on 18 October to pro-
 pose an economic and customs
 union and a union of mili-
 tary forces with no infringe-
 ment on Katanga's existence
 as a separate political entity.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Press reports indicate that
 Adoula gave them a flat re-
 jection, although privately
 he may have left the door
 open to further negotiations.
 Reports from Elisabeth-
 ville reflect a high de-
 gree of confidence on Tshombe's
 part.   He reportedly takes
 the attitude that if Leopold-
 ville or the UN insisted on
 a highly centralized govern-
 ment, Katanga would say,
 "Come and get us."   On 18
 October,  Tshombe's troops
 were reported restive,  hos-
 tile to discipline, and eager
 to renew the fight with UN
 forces.
 Nhil.e Tshombe has not
 carried slut his threat to
 take military action against
 the rebellious anti-Tshombe
 Baluba refugees,  30,000 of
 whom are camped on the out-
 skirts of. Elisabethville,
 he has reserved the right
 to maintain order "by all
 means possible."   A tight
 Katanga-enforced cordon
 rings the camp,  and no one
 is.permitted to leave except
 those who agree to return
 home.   Clashes between the
 Balubas and Katangan forces
 are frequent.
 The Belgian Government ap-
 pears reluctant to apply econom-
 ic and financial sanctions
 against Tshombe,  for example by
 holding up tax payments by Union
 Miniere to the Katangan govern-
 ment.   Foreign Minister Spaak
 told Ambassador MacArthur that
 the legal authority of the Bel-
 gian Government to take such
 steps would have to be studied.
 Spaak said he feared that such
 action would cause Tshombe to
 nationalize all Belgian indus-
 tries in Katanga.   Spaak claims
 that if the Belgian public should
 hold the government responsible
 for initiating an action that
 caused nationalization, the re-
 sult could be "disastrous" for
 the government.   Spaak argued
 that a rapprochement between
 Tshombe and Adoula could best
 be promoted by a moderate Afri-
 can nation or an individual with
 an understanding of Bantu psy-
 chology.
 Gizenga returned to Stanley-
 ville on 6 October, presumably for
 a temporary stay.   Adoula and
 Gizengists in Leopoldville have
 continued to express concern over
 Gizenga's delay in returning.
 Leopoldville's suspicions that
 Gizenga may be planning new moves
 against it will be increased by
 the reports on 25 October that his
 long-time foe, Orientale Province
 head Jean Manzikala, had been
 ousted and replaced by Gizengist
 Simon Losala.
 Gizengists in Leopoldville,  headei
 by Interior Minister Gbenye,
 feared army leader General Mobutu
 would arrest and execute them
 and were considering withdrawing
 to Stanleyville.   Gizenga's
 success in posing Stanleyville
 again as a competing center of
 power to Leopoldville would de-
 pend in large measure on the aid
 he could obtain from his outside
 supporters,  the Soviet bloc and
 radical African and Arab states.

 Algerian rebel premier Ben
 Khedda's statement on 24 October
 offering to renew negotiations
 with France presented a new ap-
 proach to a settlement--imme-
 diate agreement on independence
 without the formality of a ref-
 erendum,.  Apparently anticipat-
 ing French insistence on a ref-
 erendum, however, Ben Khedda
 expressed willingness to con-
 tinue working for a peaceful
 solution through this means.
 His preference that negotiations
 be limited to Algerian independ-
 ence and a cease-fire was linked
 with a proposed procedure that
 might allow for the negotiation
 of guarantees for the European
 minority and other vital French
 interests before an actual dec-
 laration of independence.
 The program outlined by
 Ben Khedda, although a reitera-
 tion of the establishment rebel
 position, could open the way
 for negotiations for independ-
 ence and a cease-fire and, simul-
 taneously, preparations for a
 referendum on the results of
 these negotiations.  Minister
 for Algerian Affairs Joxe indi-
 cated to a French parliamentary
 committee on 25 October that the
 French would stand by President
 De Gaulle's three-year-old policy
 on a referendum so that all the
 Algerian people--not just the
 rebel provisional government
 (PAG)--could express their de-
 sires.
 In agreeing to cooperate
 in a self-determination refer-
 endum, Ben Khedda stressed that
 such a process was unnecessarily
 time-consuming,since the Algeri-
 ans would certainly opt for in-
 dependence.  By presenting his
 preferred solution as designed
 to achieve an almost immediate
 solution, Ben Khedda was evident-
 ly attempting to place on De
 Gaulle the onus for continued
 hostilities.   In arguing that
 events have rendered a referen-
 dum unnecessary, Ben Khedda was
 also alluding to the responsive-
 ness of Algerians to the orders
 of the rebel government--as evi-
 denced by last week's Moslem
 demonstrations in Paris, for
 which the PAG has claimed credit.
 Although Paris has rejected
 the details of the rebel propos-
 al, the French appear to be en-
 couraged by the tone, which may
 indicate that substantial agree-
 ment has been achieved in secret
 exchanges reported to have taken
 place in recent weeks.   If full-
 scale negotiations are resumed
 they probably will be conducted
 secretly, since both sides re-
 portedly feel that another pub-
 licized failure would be disas-
 trous,
 De Gaulle presumably still
 intends to visit Algeria to make
 some move toward establishing.a
 consultative body which would be
 the forerunner of the provisional
 executive body to-organize the
 referendum.  According to the US
 consul general at Algiers, Joxe
 has consulted with presidents
 and dice presidents of depart-
 mental and regional councils,
 apparently in an effort to
 convene an Algerian assembly.
 The latter would designate a
 predominantly Moslem consult-
 ative committee, which itself
 would later comprise the exec-
 utive.
 Joxe's cabinet director
 expressed concern to US
 officials last week that the
 Algerian riots in Paris would
 make negotiations extremely
 difficult.  He felt that the
 riots had created anti-Arab
 feeling in metropolitan
 France which was producing a
 conviction that "the only
 thing they understand is
 force" and that negotiations
 with such people could not
 be fruitful.  He said this
 attitude - would become
 firmer if new riots-were to take
 place in connection with the

 ently intends to conduct in

 The American Embassy's com-
 ment on the Paris demonstrations
 noted that throughout France
 they had aroused indignation
 that Paris should be turned into
 another Algerian battleground,
 shock over the degree of rebel
 remote control,  and concern
 that the situation would degen-
 erate to the point of gravely
 compromising any Algerian set-
 tlement.   In addition to regular
 police,  the government has massed
 in Paris 10 Republican Securi-
 ty companies and 25 squadrons
 of mobile gendarmerie.   While
 apparently fully capable of con-
 trolling further demonstrations
 in metropolitan France,  the
 government is being subjected
 to a wave of protest from con-
 servative as well as liberal
 and leftist political elements
 concerning police brutality in

 eliminate the base for any

 tivists could quickly produce the

 Ben Khedda's offer to resume

 continuing reports of a rift be-

 reportedly been circulated and
 there have been persistent ru-
 mors of coup or assassination
 plotting, Nasir apparently has
 ordered an extensive security
 screening.  A number of officers
 considered "reactionaries", or
 dissidents of some other sort
 nave been arrested in what may
 be the beginning of a major
 snake-up of the officer corps.
 In reshuffling his cabinet
 last week, Nasir retained the
 same men in the key posts but
 tightened the organizational
 structure considerably.   Vice
 President Bagndadi, who now
 also heads the ministries of
 Planning and Treasury,  is the
 dominant figure in the economic
 field.  He may get significant
 assistance from the new minis-
 ter of agriculture, Nagib
 Hashad, a capable professional
 agriculturalist.   Vice Presi-
 dent Zakariyya Muhyi al-Din,
 also minister of interior,
 is again the key man in the
 police and security field,  in
 which he has performed effec-
 tively in the past.   Despite
 rumors that Field Marshal Amir
 would be ousted because of dis-
 agreements with Nasir stemming
 from Syrian secession, he con-
 tinues as a vice president and
 as minister of defense.
 This revised and stream-
 lined cabinet has neither a
 strong radical nor conservative
 slant; it does have some good
 technicians and will probably
 be more effective than its
 rather unwieldy predecessor in
 carrying out the socialist pol-
 icies already set in Egypt.
 Some additional cabinet shifts
 SYE CIR!; T
 are a possibility, and changes
 will be made in the bureaucracy
 and in the National Union,
 Nasir?s single-party political
 system.
 Nasir is continuing his
 efforts to get a major subver-
 sion program under way against
 Syria and Jordan.  The resig-
 nation of strongly pro-Nasir
 Prime Minister Saib Salam in
 Lebanon and ensuing government
 changes may, however,  inhibit
 the freedom of action of Egyp-
 tian agents there to conduct
 operations into Syria.
 Jordan
 Parliamentary elections took
 place last week without major in-
 cident, although pro-Nasir Jordani-
 ans, staged?'a few small demonstra-
 tions against King Husayn's govern-
 ment.  The results having been de-
 termined in advance by the govern-
 ments screening of candidates,
 only 10 to 15 percent of the elec-
 torate went through the motions of
 voting.  At least 57 of the 60 dep-
 uties elected are rightists and
 supporters of the government.
 The resulting resentment is
 particularly strong in the West
 Bank area, where the Palestinian
 population is large,  The regime
 may find it necessary to rely m,or;,
 and more strongly on the army to
 preserve its control.  Husayn?s
 concern over the loyalty of mili-
 tary units is suggested by a
 report that he gave personal
 orders last week for the dismiss,
 of 65 officers and men.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 STATUS OF SYRIAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH THE BLOC
 Although the USSR has
 made no offers of economic or
 military aid to the new Syrian
 Government, it probably would
 extend such assistance if re-
 quested.   Meanwhile, the USSR
 apparently will continue work
 on the projects scheduled un-
 der the existing $150,000,000
 economic credit.   The agree-
 ment providing for this credit
 was concluded in 1957 prior to
 Syria's union with Egypt in
 early 1958.   It calls for sev-
 eral land-reclamation projects,
 plus the construction of some
 small plants and factories and
 the Latakia-Aleppo-Qamishliya
 railroad.
 The major project was to
 have been a hydroelectric dam
 on the Euphrates River, but,
 largely 'because of Soviet hes-
 itation following the formation
 of the UAR and the Iraqi rev-
 olution, the project was as-
 signed to West Germany earlier
 this year. This has made avail-
 able about $70,000,000 of the
 Soviet credit for other projects.
 Some of the European sat-
 ellites have in recent years
 provided relatively small,
 medium-term credits to Syria
 for the construction of a
 variety of projects, but the
 Soviet credit is the only ma-
 jor one now available from the
 bloc.   The larger aid credits
 the satellites extended to the
 UAR apparently were designated
 mainly for the Egyptian region.
 One of the new Damascus govern-
 ment's criticisms of Cairo is
 that, with the exception of the
 recent West German credit for
 the Euphrates dam, Syria never
 benefited from foreign aid pro-
 vided to the UAR.
 The satellites now prob-
 ably                   would  be  willing  to
 increase their commercial credit
 extensions to Syria,   and some
 may offer long-term aid. Total
 satellite aid to Syria amounts
 to less than $30,000,000.
 The new government also
 has expressed its dissatisfac-
 tion with military assistance
 from the bloc under the UAR,
 claiming that arms and equip-
 ment promised the Syrian re-
 gion had been "stolen" by
 Egypt.   This is an apparent
 reference to the Soviet-Syrian
 arms deal concluded in early
 1958 just prior to the forma-
 tion of the UAR.    Some naval
 vessels, combat aircraft, and
 probably certain land armaments
 originally ordered by Damascus
 were delivered instead to Egypt
 at Cairo's request.
 Other bloc-UAR arms agree-
 ments concluded since 1958 have
 been designed basically to de-
 velop the armed forces of Egypt.
 As a result, Syrian military
 circles probably feel there is
 a need to make up lost ground
 by acquiring new arms supplies--
 a "need" which Moscow probably
 would be willing to fill if asked.
 Between 1956 and 1958, the bloc--
 chiefly the USSR--provided Syria
 with about $250,000,000 in mil-
 itary assistance, most of it
 prior to the creation of the UAR.
 The Soviet Union and the
 other members of the bloc prob-
 ably will also seek to revive
 trade with Syria.   In 1960,
 bloc-Syrian trade amounted to
 less than $40,000,000, with the
 bloc taking about 23 percent
 of Syria's exports and providing
 about 9 percent Q1. its imports.
 The USSR, Syria's chief trading
 partner in the bloc, for the
 most part exchanged oil for
 cotton.                (Prepared by

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 BLOC AIRCRAFT SALES IN UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES
 The bloc program to aid
 underdeveloped countries in
 the establishment and expansion
 of civil, air facilities has
 been gaining momentum in recent
 months.   Large numbers of sev-
 eral types of civil aircraft--
 both piston and high-performance
 turboprop--have been sold to
 Guinea, Ghana, Mali, Cuba, and
 India; in the three West African
 countries the majority of the
 transports operating on the na-
 tional lines were purchased from
 the bloc.
 Such aid, relatively srmiaIi
 in value, affords the bloc a
 disproportionately large oppor-
 tunity to enhance its prestige
 and increase its penetration
 in some areas of the non-Com-
 munist world.   Despite the fact
 that comparable Western planes
 are in many ways superior,  the
 underdeveloped countries have
 been receptive to bloc offers;
 this is primarily because the
 bloc's prices and terms are
 more favorable.
 Two types of Soviet high-
 performance commercial aircraft
 have been sold outside the bloc
 thus far--the IL-18,  a large
 transport capable of carrying
 75-100 passengers,       and the AN-12
 military transport.  The IL-18
 has been sold exclusively in
 Africa, where at least 12 now
 are in operation on commercial
 routes out of Conakry, Accra,
 and Bamako.   Additional IL-18s--
 reportedly five--ordered by
 Guinea will soon be delivered.
 The total cost of these planes.
 is estimated at approximately
 $30,000,000, and presumably all
 were purchased on credit.
 India has been the princi-
 pal customer for the AN-12 and
 is using it to airlift equipment
 to the Himalayan frontier near
 the Sino-Indian border.   Orig-
 inally India purchased eight
 AN-12s plus auxiliary equipment
 and spare engines for $21,000,000,
 to be repaid over a five-year period
 in Indian rupees.   These eight have
 all been delivered.   Despite serious

 problems with the aircraft,
 India now has ordered six or
 eight more--presumably for the
 same operation.            One AN-12 has
 been purchased by Ghana.
 The TJSSR has sold more IL-
 14s--light piston transports
 with a capacity of about 24
 passenger:;--than any other type
 of aircraft.   India, Cuba, Mali,
 and Cambodia have purchased a
 total of 41 of these planes from
 Moscow.   .[n India, 24 rebuilt
 IL-14s purchased at a cost of
 some $4,500,000 have now been
 delivered and are engaged in
 limited operations along with
 the AN-12; in the northern bor-
 der area.   Cuba apparently has
 contracted for some 12 IL-14s,
 but only a few have been deliv-
 ered.     Cambodia and Mali have
 recently received several of
 these aircraft and will soon
 have them in operation.
 The AN-2 biplane also is
 being seen in increasing numbers
 in the underdeveloped countries.
 This plane, which can be landed
 in a small space,  has numerous
 uses,  including crop dusting,
 cargo and mail transport, and
 aerial photography;  it is par-
 ticularly useful in countries
 where communication facilities
 are limiteed.   The USSR has sold
 these planes to Guinea, Mali,
 and Cuba.
 Helicopters are also be-
 coming increasingly popular
 because of their adaptability.
 The Soviet MI-4 is being ex-
 ported to Mali, Cuba,  and India.
 India's initial doubts about
 the capabilities of these heli-
 copters apparently were overrid-
 SE CRE T
 den by the favorable terms
 offered.
 The  USSR  has   in   the
 past   attempted  to    interest
 underdeveloped    countries  in
 buying   its   large  TU-104   jet
 transport, the   efficiency
 of   which   is   questionable.
 This   aircraft   was   offered
 to   India,   Egypt,  Iraq,  and
 Ghana,   but  no sales  were
 concluded.
 Czechoslovakia also has
 supplied several types of civil
 aircraft to countries outside
 the bloc.   An exporter of small
 light civil aircraft for many
 years,  Czechoslovakia has re-
 cently been offering a greater
 variety of designs on favorable
 terms.   The Czech variant of
 the Soviet IL-14  (neither ver-
 sion is any longer in produc-
 tion) has been sold to Guinea
 on credit terms and now is the
 major transport on internal
 Guinean air routes.   More re-
 cently Czechoslovakia extended
 a credit to Mali which probably
 will be used to buy several dif-
 ferent types of Czech aircraft.
 One of the methods used
 to popularize bloc planes has
 been to give specially outfitted
 IL-14s and MI-4 helicopters to
 national leaders for their per-
 sonal use.   During the Bulganin-
 Khrushchev trip through Asia in
 1955,  IL-14s were presented to
 the leaders of Afghanistan,
 India, and Burma.   Since then
 the leaders of Egypt, Yemen,
 Iran, Guinea,  Ghana,  Ethiopia,
 Cuba,  Nepal, and Cambodia have
 received such gifts.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 IUN 'DEBATE":ON SOUTH :AFRICA:
 The General Assembly's
 Special Political Committee
 began debate on 23 October on
 the Republic of South Africa's
 apartheid policy amid strong
 indications that the African
 states will succeed this year
 in their efforts to have the
 assembly recommend sanctions
 against the Verwoerd government.
 Ghana--which spearheaded an un-
 successful attempt to do this
 last year--has been privately
 circulating a draft resolution
 recommending breaking off dip-
 lomatic relations, imposing an
 economic boycott, and closing
 ports to South African ships and
 aircraft. The draft resolution
 also calls for expelling South
 Africa from the United Nations,
 but the Ghanaian UN delegate
 acknowledges that this provi-
 sion will probably be dropped
 in order to get moderate Afri-
 can sponsorship.
 against sanctions as they did
 last year. An Italian UN dele-
 gate says his government consid -
 era`x`it essential to avoid solid
 Western European opposition to
 sanctions as long as a solid
 Africani bloc approves such
 measures.
 The General Assembly has
 never yet recommended sanctions
 against one of its members.   Ac-
 tual sanctions were recommended
 against Spain in 1946--Spain
 did not become a member until
 1955--and in 1951 against Com-
 munist China.   However, on the
 initiative of its African mem-
 bers, the General Assembly sup-
 ported the unprecedented cen-
 sure of South Africa for the
 hard-hitting speech on 11 Octo-
 ber by Foreign Minister Louw
 during a general debate.
 South Africa's continued
 flouting of frequent UN admoni-
 tions -on its racial policy,
 plus the increasing reluctance
 of Afro-Asians to heed Western
 counsels of moderation, will
 probably lead to nearly unan-
 imous Afro-Asian support for
 sanctions.   The Japanese UN
 delegate reports that Tokyo
 will probably abstain on the
 Ghanaian draft but believes
 that most other Asian countries
 which abstained last year--
 such as India and Pakistan--
 will support sanctions this
 year.   The British UN delegate
 reports that Austria and the
 Netherlands have decided "for
 their own political reasons"
 to abstain rather than vote

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Antigovernment rioting that
 started on 16 October in Ciudad
 Trujillo and spread to other
 cities began to slacken after
 six days, although there was a
 new outbreak of violence on 25
 October in Santiago,  the second
 largest city.   According to the
 American consul general,  the
 rioters are mostly revolutionary
 minded youths acting without
 centralized direction.   Student
 leaders at the university, as
 well as the directors of the
 major opposition groups, have
 taken no public part in the dis-
 turbances, and the consul general
 sees no evidence that they have
 been clandestinely supporting
 the rioters.   Public sympathy
 was generally with the rioters
 at first, but after a few days
 there were indications that
 some elements of the public were
 coming to regard the youths' ac-
 tions as foolhardy.
 The police showed unaccus-
 tomed restraint in the early
 stages of the rioting;  even af-
 ter the clashes became more vio-
 lent there was not the wholesale
 bloodshed that probably would
 have occurred under the old re-
 gime.   At least four youths were
 killed, however, and many were
 injured.
 The rioting has probably in-
 creased pressure in the armed
 forces for action against the
 opposition and possibly, as in
 the aftermath of civil disturb-
 ances last summer, for the re-
 placement of the Balaguer govern-
 ment with a military regime.
 SECRET
 At present,  however,  there is
 no evidence of plans for an im-
 minent military takeover.   The
 government's replacement of the
 unpopular university rector,
 whose appointment had sparked
 the rioting, may help ease the
 tension.   According  to informa-
 tion of 23 Octobe
 however, many
 o   the s u en s are planning
 further disorders during the
 first two.weeks of November.
 The government made long-
 planned moves against the pro-
 Castro Dominican Popular Move-
 ment (MPD) on 22 October but
 with only partial success.  Gov-
 ernment press attacks on the MPD
 and fake MPD rallies staged by
 government supporters evidently
 warned most MPD leaders to go
 into hiding.
 In an address on 23 October,
 President Balaguer announced
 the departure from the country
 of leading members of the Trujillo
 family and appealed for an end
 to political hatreds in "this
 moment of conciliation and con-
 cord."   The departure of the
 two most prominent of the late
 dictator's brothers, Generals
 Arismendi and Hector Trujillo,
 should improve the political
 climate, but no change in the
 position of General Ramfis Tru-  25X1
 jillo appears likely for the
 immediate future.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Rioting broke out in La
 Paz on 21 October as a result
 of a government decree in-
 creasing domestic prices on
 gasoline and fuel oil.  The
 measure has been recommended
 by the International Monetary
 Fund for more than a year as
 essential to the government's
 economic stabilization pro-
 gram.   President Paz has re-
 ~tedly set a date for is-
 su.L    the decree, only to post-
 pone it as temporarily im-
 possible from a political point
 of view,   The national petro-
 leumcompany, which provides
 some export revenue and almost
 all domestic oil i?equirements,
 has been operating at a  loss.
 The government declared
 a state of siege in La Paz
 on the first day of the riot-
 ing,                    imposed domestic press
 censorship, and reacted to
 student participation in riots
 by ending the school year for
 high schools and universities
 throughout Bolivia.
 Clashes between govern-
 ment supporters and protest
 mobs apparently led by rightists
 and extreme leftists occurred
 on 23 October, despite a pro-
 hibition on all demonstrations
 under the state of siege.   The
 mob destroyed offices of the
 government newspaper,  two po-
 lice stations,  and one gasoline
 station and attacked other
 installations.  The national
 committee of the government
 party has authorized its
 members to capture subversives
 for delivery to the police and
 to use firearms in defensive
 action.
 The government paper announced
 on 24 October that some 4,000
 members of the rural militia had
 arrived in La Paz and more were on
 the way.   The rural militia are
 much feared,  particularly by the
 rightist urban elements who oppose
 President Paz Estenssoro, who was
 elected with 70 percent of the
 vote in June 1960.
 The government had evidently
 been hoping that recent news of
 political instability would dis-
 tract public attention from the
 gasoline price issue.   Paz on 19
 October had ordered the arrest of
 a heterogeneous group of rightists
 and leftists,  accusing them of con-
 spiracy against the government.
 This was Paz'   third major
 crackdown against his opposition
 this year;  the other two--in Feb-
 ruary and June--were followed by
 decrees of a 90-day state of  siege
 throughout the country.   While
 some of the men arrested were prob-
 ably                                                                    involved in the revolution-
 ary plotting which is almost con-
 stant in Bolivia,  opposition
 groups have not appeared to have
 a firm plan for overthrowing the
 government.
 The present rioting does not
 appear to pose any immediate
 threat to the Paz government,  but
 further violence is likely.

 BACKGROUND OF THE BLOC'S DISPUTE WITH ALBANIA
 East European represent-
 atives left the stormy meeting
 of world Communist leaders in
 Moscow last November more or
 less firmly committed to back
 Khrushchev in his dispute with
 China and its Adriatic ally.
 Since then their attitudes to-
 ward the Albanians have hard-
 ened perceptibly. Khrushchev's
 stanchest supporters last fall
 and subsequently have been
 Poland's Gomulka,  East Germany's
 tJlbricht,  and Czechoslovakia's
 Novotny,
 Immediately after the 1960
 meeting the European satellite
 party leaders took steps to
 forestall any possible opposi-
 tion within their own countries
 which might have derived from
 the compromise at Moscow with the
 Chinese,   They also initiated
 moves to force Albanian obei-
 sance to Moscow.   While they
 apparently succeeded in achiev-
 ing the former aim,  they have
 thus far failed to accomplish
 the latter.   The Bulgarian re-
 gime crushed an "antiparty
 group" which had Chinese sym-
 pathies,   East European lead-
 ers apparently feared internal
 party strife of this sort might
 erupt on a large scale.
 All the pro-Moscow satel-
 lites have widely publicized
 their stands against "dogmatism
 and sectarianism"--that is,
 Chinese and Albanian policies--
 although the attack on China
 appears for the most part to
 have been left to the Soviets,
 with the East European parties
 in a supporting role.   In the
 case of Albania,  however,  the
 satellites have joined Moscow
 in direct attacks.   As these
 attacks continued,  bloc unity
 became only a facade,  and
 Albania now is spoken of pri-
 vately by East European leaders
 as "Moscow's Cuba,"
 On 18 December 1960 U1-
 bricht fired the opening shot
 at Albania when he publicly
 criticized its position at
 Moscow.   Hoxha answered two
 weeks later in a public ad-
 dress in which he vowed he
 would not bow to pressure on
 'matters of principle."   In
 February 1961,  during the Al-
 banian party congress,  Hoxha re-
 affirmed his pro-Chinese atti-
 tudes and alluded to the Soviet-
 backed coup attempt in Albania
 in the summer of 1960.   Hoxha
 did not directly implicate Mos-
 cow,  however,  charging instead
 that the US, Greece,  and Yugo-
 slavia were behind the move to
 overthrow him.
 Chinese delegates to the
 Albanian congress received
 highly preferential treatment
 over that accorded other bloc
 delegations.   Gomulka, offended
 by Hoxha's personal attacks on
 him in Moscow, sent a delega-
 tion headed by a party hack and
 discredited Stalinist,  Roman
 Nowak, who lectured the meeting
 on the dangers of dogmatism,  For
 this affront,  the Polish delega-
 tion was snubbed in Tirana,  and
 Polish domestic and foreign
 policies were attacked on the

 conferences.   The attendance of
 both countries--Albania as a
 full member and China as an ob-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Albania's independent at-
 titude was further demonstrated
 when it sent a delegation which
 was headed by its defense minim
 ister to the Warsaw Pact meeting
 held in Moscow on 28 and 29
 March and attended by the party
 first secretaries and premiers
 of all the other East European
 states.
 On 3 April the bloc's
 clandestine radio beamed at
 Italy and located in Czecho-
 slovakia quoted in advance of
 publication an article by Ital-
 ian Communist party chief Tog-
 liatti, who said,    "    ..Questions
 of internal party life and de-
 bate in'Albania seemed to us
 erroneous and dangerous...."
 Perhaps in reply, Hoxha subse-
 quently announced that a trial
 of spies and traitors would
 soon be held--in effect calling
 for the consummation of the pre-
 vious summer's purge of pro-
 Soviet elements.   The trial,
 with' transparent anti-Soviet
 overtones, was held in May, and
 the chief conspirators were sen-
 tenced to death.
 During a major policy
 speech on 6 May, Hoxha again
 reaffirmed his position and
 castigated his bloc critics.
 In an anti-Western portion of
 his speech he said that Albania
 could defend itself against ag-
 gression, but his choice of
 words implied a threat from the
 East as well as the West.
 From 3 to 5 August the
 party chiefs of the Warsaw Pact
 states met in Moscow to discuss
 the Berlin problem.  Hoxha sent
 only a junior party functionary,
 and China, which holds observer
 status in the pact, sent no one.
 Ulbricht viewed the Hoxha rep-
 resentative's rank as a calcu-
 lated insult and demanded at the
 first session that he leave; the
 Albanian returned to Tirana on
 the following day.
 Neither Albania-nor China
 was represented at the 8-9 Sep-
 tember meeting of Warsaw Pact
 defense ministers in Warsaw--
 suggesting that those countries
 no longer participate in pact
 activities, at least not on the
 same scale as previously.
 Albania was the only Euro-
 pean Communist country which
 sent no special delegate to the
 celebration of East Germany's
 12th anniversary on 7 October.
 The Albanian ambassador in East
 Berlin attended the main cere-
 monies, but he was seated off
 the platform, away from bloc
 delegates, and left immediately
 after the Chinese representative's
 speech.
 Bloc Counteractions
 The political friction has
 affected Tirana's bloc relations
 in a variety of ways.   Polish
 party First Secretary Gomulka
 withdrew his ambassador from
 Albania last March and has
 since made no move to replace
 him.   In August, the Polish
 leader accepted a new Albanian
 ambassador to Warsaw after that
 post had been vacant for over
 a year.  Members of the Polish
 Communist  party  reportedly

 the few Albanian diplomats re-

 similar restrictions apply to
 the Poles in Tirana.   All news
 about Albania and China must be
 cleared with the press depart-
 ment of the Polish party cen-
 tral committee prior to publi-
 cation.
 The Soviet Union decided--
 apparently in the spring--not
 to permit Russians to visit
 Albania.   No Czechoslovak or
 Hungarian tourists have visited
 Albania in 1961.   Fifty Poles
 made a state-sponsored tour
 of Albania in May, but Warsaw
 has canceled all such trips
 scheduled since then.   Tours
 by  bloc   nationals  to Yugo-
 slavia,   Albania's   archenemy,
 still  are  available   for
 most satellite citizens except
 East Germans.
 The Czechs and the East
 Germans have withdrawn some of
 their technicians from Albania.
 Reportedly all Albanian students
 in Czechoslovakia returned home
 in June, and all Czechoslovak
 higher schools have been or-
 dered to deny admission to Al-
 banian students this fall.   Al-
 banian students also left
 Rumania in June.   The Czechs
 have granted political asylum
 to two Albanian diplomats in
 Prague.
 Soviet pressure on Hoxha
 has been continuous.   No Soviet
 representative attended the
 opening on 1 September of Al-
 banian-Soviet Friendship Month
 in Albania--a ceremony which
 provided the occasion for
 Tirana's spokesman to reaf ire
 the "correctness" of his party's
 line.   It has recently become

 infuriates the Albanians and
 Chinese, who regard the Yugo-
 slavs as enemies of Communism.
 Both Albania and Communist
 China, nevertheless,have them-
 selves continued state relations
 with Yugoslavia,  but these rela-
 tions have at times seemed close
 to the breaking point.   From
 mid-June to mid-August,  however,
 Albania refrained from its
 usual. propaganda attacks on
 Yugoslavia.
 The Military Situation
 Possessing few resources
 of its own, Albania is depend-
 ent on other countries for mil-
 itary aid.   In the past, arms
 and equipment have been supplied
 by the bloc,  especially by the
 USSR.   It is not known whether
 military equipment is still be-
 ing furnished by these sources,
 but one of the major effects
 of the dispute has been the
 isolation of Albania in terms
 of its former military rela-
 tions with the bloc.
 On 26 May the USSR with-
 drew eight of its W-class sub-
 marines which had been based
 at the Albanian port of Vlone.
 Subsequently the Soviets re-
 portedly evacuated the naval
 base entirely.   Both Tirana
 and Moscow have expelled each
 other.'s'military attaches.
 The USSR also sent home a group
 of Albanian naval trainees,
 and an unknown number of Soviet
 military experts were expelled
 from Albania in retaliation.
 Soviet trade with Albania
 has declined considerably since
 1960, but the full extent of the
 cutback is not known.   Some
 Russian grain is exchanged for
 Albanian petroleum and mineral
 raw materials.
 East European trade rela-
 tions with Albania apparently
 also have been maintained, al-
 though on a reduced scale.   In
 return for nickel ore, Czecho-
 slovakia has honored a commit-
 ment to aid Albania in the ore's
 extraction.   The Albanians
 apparently want to do their own
 refining,  however,  and have ob-
 tained aid from China to estab-
 1ish an ore processing plant in Arozo.ia.
 China has backed up its ally
 on the economic as well as the
 political front.    Last February
 Peiping agreed to supply the Al-
 banians $125,000,000 in economic
 assistance over the next five
 years--after Tirana's request
 for loans amounting to more than
 $160,000,000 (at official ex-
 change rates) had been turned
 down by the USSR and the Euro-
 pean satellites.
 Substantial numbers of Chi-
 nese technicians have been re-
 ported passing through Moscow en
 route to Tirana.   During the year
 ending June 196]., Albanian grain
 imports reached a new high of 319,-
 000 metric tons.                                                                     This is four times
 more than in previous years; 75 percent
 of it was supplied by China, itself hard
 pressed for grain.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 THE CUBAN INTERNAL SITUATION
 Domestic dissatisfaction
 with the Castro regime, spring-
 ing from the economic and polit-
 ical facts of life in Cuba to-
 day,                     is increasing, but in no
 case is it believed to have
 reached a level where a popular
 revolt seriously threatening
 the stability of Castro's gov-
 ernment is at hand.
 in Cuba genera 1-
 y agree that the anti-Castro
 forces now include more people
 than ever before from the lower
 classes--on which the regime
 depends for its domestic sup-
 port.  The majority of people
 in this group still support
 Castro, however, either because
 they have already benefited
 more under him than under any
 previous government, or because
 they still believe his promises
 of a materially improved future.
 The still-growing numbers
 in the vast bureaucracy and the
 militia, dependent on the regime
 for their livelihood and social
 status, furnish another impor-
 tant source of support.   The
 regime maintains a hard core of
 fanatical backers and a large
 and efficient apparatus of re-
 pression.
 The Opposition Forces
 Opposition activity vir-
 tually stopped after the mid-
 April landings and the regime's
 intense campaign of terror
 against all known or suspected
 dissidents.   Several small guer-
 rilla bands are still operating
 on the island, however, and
 there is evidence that acts of
 sabotage are again occurring
 sporadically and that individ.1
 uals or small groups of govern-
 ment troops continue to desert
 to the anti-Castro forces.
 For the most part, however,
 the active opposition is still
 handicapped by factionalism and
 a lack of organization, a short-
 age of supplies, the absence
 of a strong leader with Castro's
 appeal, and the need for a well-
 defined substitute for the Cas-
 tro program.   The chances of
 effective military action against
 Castro are constantly fading,
 while he continues to build up
 well-equipped,   well-trained
 military and other security
 forces.
 Public Discontent
 Of more significance in
 the long run are the numerous
 indications of increasing dis-
 content and disillusionment
 among the public.  The people
 are beginning to express their
 unhappiness with the degree of
 regimentation imposed on them,
 and regime leaders are publicly
 decrying worker absenteeism.
 Popular resentment flared
 into open demonstrations=.inHavana and several other Cuban
 cities in September when the
 government banned a religious
 procession and was forced for
 the first time to resort to
 firearms to disperse the riot-
 ers.                                                          The historically weak
 position of the Roman Catholic
 Church in Cuba and Castro's ex-
 pulsion of more than half of
 Cuba.'s clergymen make it unlike-
 ly that further major religious
 demonstrations will occur.
 that grumbling over shortages
 of food and other items is be-
 coming louder and more wide-
 spread.  There is no evidence,
 however, that Cubans are starv-
 ing or that shortages of lard,

 meat,  rice, and other products
 basic to the Cuban diet will
 become severe enough to encour-
 age a revolt.   The continuing
 delivery to Cuba of foodstuffs
 and other vital consumer goods
 from the bloc, plus an antic-
 ipated increase in domestic food
 production as scientific growing
 methods are enforced under the
 state-directed long-range eco-
 nomic plan, should prevent cur-
 rent shortages from assuming
 critical proportions,
 Refugee Flights
 The flow of Cubans leaving
 the island--some by legal means
 and a greater number by extra-
 legal means--has increased with-
 in the past few months.   By
 August some 700 Cubans had
 taken diplomatic asylum in sev-
 eral Latin American embassies
 in Havana;  only recently has
 the regime begun to permit some
 of these persons to leave Cuba.
 More than 15,000 Cubans with
 travel arrangements completed
 were reported by the US press
 to have been affected by the
 government?s mid-September
 measure requiring new travel
 documentation.   The number of
 Cubans leaving the island clan-
 destinely--usually by means of
 small, ill-equipped boats--has
 risen since last spring.
 Regime Reaction
 Castro and his lieutenants
 are reacting strongly to manifes-
 tations of unrest.   "Revolu-
 tionary tribunals" have inten-
 sified their activities, and
 firing squads executed at least
 26 persons in September alone,
 according to press reports,
 Military units in Oriente and
 Camaguey provinces were placed
 on alert in early October, and
 other general mobilization meas-
 ures were reported on the 17th.
 Cuban officials and prop-
 aganda media have intensified
 their violent anti-US campaign,
 charging that the United States
 is preparing "a new,  larger in-
 vasion."                                                            This campaign may
 stem from a real fear of inva-
 sion.   It is also probably de-
 signed to divert public attention
 from local economic and political
 problems--a tactic Castro has
 used in the past.   It may also
 presage a Castro effort to dis-
 credit the United States by
 staging a faked landing in ad-
 vance of any OAS consideration
 of the Cuban problem.
 New Security Measures
 The various measures taken
 by the regime up to last April
 to tighten internal security
 under the guise.of temporary
 expedients have since that time
 become increasingly institu-
 tionalized and have assumed the
 character of permanent instru-
 .ments of internal control.   The
 most-pervasive of these, the
 Revolutionary Defense Committees,
 comprise a nationwide informant
 network controlled by the Minis-
 try of Interior.   The goal, an-
 nounced on 30 April, of 100,000
 committees  throughout  the
 country comprising 500,000
 "revolutionary vigilantes"
 has, according to government
 announcements   in  early  au-
 tumn,   been  substantially
 accomplished.
 In early June, the regime's
 secret   police  organization
 was    transferred to a  re-
 organized                                                                       Ministry   of Interior.
 This   change probably resulted
 in  a  more  efficient   and
 centralized   internal   security
 apparatus  and also   in effective
 Communist  control  of   this
 function.  Ramiro  Valdes, a
 Communist, rose from chief of
 the old G-2 to head of the
 new ministry.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Simultaneous with the in-
 creased efficiency of the in-
 ternal security apparatus has
 been the development of a con-
 certed indoctrination program
 described by regime leaders as
 a campaign to eradicate illit-
 eracy from the nation before
 the end of this year and now
 frankly characterized by them
 as based on "Marxist-Leninist
 principles."
 Party, Government Reorganization
 The political and organiza-
 tional structure of the state
 is also rapidly  evolving toward
 a system similar to the party
 and governmental structure
 found in the Soviet bloc.   The
 old provincial and municipal
 governments are being replaced
 by Boards for Coordination.,
 Execution, and Inspection
 (JUCEI).   JUCEI have been
 formed since last June in all
 six provinces, and subordinate
 ones have been set up or are in
 the process of formation in the
 municipalities.  Local and pro-
 vincial JUCEI are subordinate
 to a national group headed by
 Fidel Castro called the JUCE-
 PLAN.
 The prototype JUCEI was
 formed in Oriente Province
 last spring under the direction
 of Raul Castro.  According to
 a speech on 4 June by the
 younger Castro, it consists of
 a "provincial congress," a
 1,200-member body which is to
 convene "two or three times
 a year"; a "plenum"--i.e., the
 provincial board--which meets
 every few months; and other
 units, which meet very fre-
 quently.   Membership is theo-
 retically,,  representative of
 all major economic entities in
 the territory of responsibility.
 The frequent references to
 JUCEI units in the Cuban press,
 however, indicate that their
 members are drawn exclusively
 or almost exclusively from the
 ranks of the political machine
 the regime now is organizing.
 In his 4 June speech, Raul
 Castro described the JUCEI as
 "instruments for applying plans"
 at the local level which had
 been decided upon by higher
 authority.   "Building socialism
 without planning is impossible,"
 he said, "and contrasts with
 the anarchy of the capitalist
 economy."  Cuban Communist
 leader Blas Roca described the
 JUCEI on 14 August as "a new
 form of state power, a step`
 forward in the procedure we
 are following for the direct
 establishment of the power of
 the people over all the country."
 Cells of the Integrated
 Revolutionary Organizations
 TORI),  the parallel party ma-
 chine now also emerging,  are
 being organized throughout the
 country as the first phase of
 an entity that is to be called
 the United party of the Cuban
 Socialist Revolution.   Commu-
 nist Secretary General Blas Roca
 has been the leading spokesman
 for and advocate of the new
 political organization.   His
 public statements foreshadow
 a party system'in which member-
 ship will be limited to the
 elite of the revolutionary
 struggle but will,  in turn, be
 a requisite to holding any po-
 sitions of economic or  political
 importance in the country.   It
 is clear from the statements
 of ORI leaders that the new
 party is to be controlled by
 the Communists and based on
 "Marxist-Leninist principles."

 In his talks next month
 with President Kennedy,  Jawa-
 harlal Nehru will be eager to
 explore international problems,
 but the line he takes on cold
 war issues is likely to be based
 firmly on the neutralist policy
 he has always felt best served
 India's national interest.   The
 Indian leader's emphasis on ne-
 gotiation and compromise as
 essential to ease cold war ten-
 sions stems largely from his
 fear that war--even if localized
 --would jeopardize what chance
 India has of attaining a reason-
 able level of economic develop-
 ment,
 Nehru, who will arrive on
 5 November, has visited the
 United States on three previous
 occasions  (1949,  1956, and 1960)
 during his 14 years as India's
 prime minister.
 "stirring" throughout the country
 as the pace of economic growth
 quickens and popular interest is
 stimulated.
 Building on the modest but
 substantial achievements of the
 First and Second Five-Year Plans,
 New Delhi's planners have set
 ambitious targets for the "bold
 and big" Third Plan (1961-66)
 in hopes of raising national
 income by 25 percent.   In con-
 trast to the uncertainty of
 previous years, New Delhi this
 spring received a tentative com-
 mitment from the consortium of
 Western nations and the World
 Bank--the "Aid-India Club"--
 to furnish nearly $2 billion in
 aid for the first two years of
 the plan,  and in addition has
 assurances of substantial assist-
 ance from Moscow.   Total for-
 eign exchange requirements for
 the plan period are estimated
 at nearly $6 billion.
 Nehru will be 72 on 14 No-
 vember.   His power and presence
 remains basically undiminished.
 While close associates report
 that the prime minister is slow-
 ing down and that his grip on
 the government and party has
 loosened,  he still shows re-
 markable vitality and command
 of affairs,  large and small,
 As Nehru surveys the state
 of the Indian Union today,  he
 probably feels reasonable satis-

 unspectacular, economic progress.

 India's chronic food short-
 age has been eased by the in-
 crease in annual food production
 of more than 35 percent during
 the First and Second Plans, as
 well as by large-scale imports
 of US surplus foods.   Barring
 major weather calamities, the
 increasing yields and build-
 up of reserve stocks should
 provide a basis for further prog-
 ress   in overcoming this old
 problem,
 Nehru can also look ahead
 to the national elections in
 February with reasonable ex-
 pectation that his Congress party

 yet of seriously threatening the
 ruling party's dominant position
 nationally.
 The weakened Communists
 may manage to hold on to their
 10-percent share of the popular
 vote but have little hope of
 improving their position; the
 socialists face eclipse.   A
 right-of-center Hindu national-
 1st'   party--the Jana Sangh--
 appears to have picked up
 strength in certain areas re-
 cently, but probably will place
 well behind the Congress party
 nationally.   The conservative
 Swatantra  (Freedom) party,
 founded in 1959 with strong
 backing from Indian private
 enterprise,  has attracted little
 mass support and seems unlikely
 to improve its position sig-
 nificantly.
 Problems of Leadership
 Major problems remain for
 Nehru, however.  The outlook for
 a successor to him and the pros-
 pect of an orderly transfer of
 power in the Congress high com-
 mand have become obscured in
 1961.   The death of Home Minis-
 ter Pant last March deprived
 Nehru of his chief deputy in
 government and party and one
 of his few remaining close
 associates among the old guard.
 The subsequent maneuvering for
 the office of deputy party
 leader--which has been called
 "the first war of the succes-
 sion"--was halted for the time
 being in August when Nehru
 created two posts of deputy
 leader,  neither of which has
 yet been :filled.
 Nehru has always found it
 distasteful to think of an heir,
 and he does not favor any of
 the remaining most likely candi-
 dates.   He particularly distrusts
 the preponderant conservative
 clique led by 65-year-old Finance
 Minister Morarji Desai.   Nehru
 thus limits his moves to check-
 mating all contenders, main-
 taining that a new national
 leader must not be chosen but
 must emerge spontaneously through
 mass support.   Desai's premature
 bid for formal designation as
 deputy has damaged his prestige
 and caused disparate elements
 in the high command to join
 forces against him, but he re-
 tains his place as second-rank-
 ing cabinet minister.
 The unhealthy condition of
 the Congress organization, partic-
 ularly   at the provincial level,
 casts increasing doubt on the
 party's ability to maintain its
 predominant position without the
 vast mass appeal of Nehru's
 leadership.   Efforts by the Con-
 gress high command to rid the organi-
 zation of chronic factional
 strife,  lethargy, corruption,
 and casteism have had little
 effect.   The party's power now
 is derived less from vital
 leadership and mass support
 than from the wealth,  social
 leverage,  and authoritarian
 controls it commands.
 Among India's internal prob-
 lems, the old question of nation-
 al  unity seems to fill Nehru
 with the greatest personal sense
 of frustration and foreboding.
 His struggle against regional,
 linguistic,  caste, and especially
 religious differences dates even
 farther back than his fight for
 Indian independence.   The mili-
 tant agitation for linguistic
 and regional autonomy which
 developed in many areas of India
 during the 1950s, added to the
 historic tension between North
 and South,  raised serious

 questions about the durability
 of India's unity.   The recent
 resurgence of communal senti-
 ment, pitting Hindu against
 Moslem and Sikh,  challenges
 Nehru's basic purpose of achiev-
 ing a secular society and en-
 dangers the stability he has
 maintained since 1947.
 In the economic field,  Nehru
 knows that despite its progress
 India has a long way to go be-
 fore it is "over the hump,"
 Such growing problems as un-
 employment,  inflation, and scar-
 city of industrial power give
 considerable cause for concern.
 Nehru feels that there may be
 just time to get India's econom-
 ic  development to the "take-
 off" stage before the crushing
 pressure of an expanding popu-
 lation makes it a futile exer-
 cise.
 Nehru's life-long interest
 in international affairs has
 developed notions of the world
 beyond India which are fairly
 fixed.   His frequent preoccu-
 pation with foreign affairs and
 his "meddling" in international
 problems have generally been
 misconstrued as representing
 merely the personal traits of
 Nehru the man and his desire
 to play the role of internation-
 al              arbiter;  the prime concerns,
 however, which have motivated
 Nehru's career are directly re-
 lated to India and its develop-
 ment.   The positions he takes
 in his official role usually
 conform to a consistent policy
 line,the sole test of which is
 India's national interest.   Mor-
 al or humanitarian considera-
 tions are subordinated.
 This premium on national
 interest provides a key to the
 rationale behind India's posi-
 tion on major cold war issues,
 and helps explain why New Delhi
 acts, or fails to act,  as it
 does,   Nehru is haunted by a
 fear that the cold war will
 turn hot, resulting in global
 economic  dislocation that
 would bring India's economic
 progress to a halt.   Thus, to
 reduce tension between the ma-
 jor powers, whatever its cause,
 becomes New Delhi's paramount
 need and objective,  and this
 often overrides questions of
 principle,  consistency,  and
 legal right.
 Nehru repeatedly calls for
 negotiations as the first step
 toward a compromise solution
 which will solve or at least
 cool a crisis.   Since he feels
 nothing should be done to harden
 attitudes and thus raise ten-
 sions,  he will carefully avoid
 making public judgments as to
 which party is right and resist
 pressure for India to join
 internationally in formal find-
 ings of guilt.   This accounts
 in large part for Nehru's re-
 luctance in public to go beyond
 expressions of "regret" over
 Soviet repression in Hungary,
 Khrushchev's  heavy handedness
 at the UN, and Moscow's resump-
 tion of nuclear tests.
 In seeking to influence
 the big powers to compromise,
 Nehru pragmatically tends to
 work hardest on the side he
 thinks most likely to make con-
 cessions, without regard to the
 merits of either position.   The
 West often gets the brunt of his
 pressure and criticism because,
 in the manner of a sympathetic

 colleague, he expects Western
 leaders to be more tractable
 and reasonable than the "boorish"
 Bolsheviks.   He is likely to
 concentrate his efforts else-
 where only when he is convinced
 that a position is not negoti-
 able and that a settlement can
 result only from concessions
 from the other side.
 It should be noted that
 New Delhi has other reasons for
 not wishing to antagonize the
 Soviet Government unduly.   Nehru
 feels the huge Third Plan will
 need all the credits he can get
 from the USSR.   He also feels he
 cannot afford to risk losing
 Moscow's support on the Kashmir
 question.
 The Policy in Practice
 Nehru's dread of cold war
 confrontations and his efforts
 at conciliation are illustrated
 in India's approach to Berlin,
 Laos,  the Congo, disarmament,
 and the United Nations.   Like
 many Indians,  Nehru lacks a
 clear understanding of the Ger-
 man question and appreciation
 of what is at stake.   He is
 less concerned with legal rights
 than with negotiations,  compro-
 mise formulas,  and a settle-
 ment based on present "realities"
 in which the interests of nei-
 ther side are seriously damaged.
 In Laos and Vietnam, Nehru
 sees India's role as chairman
 of the International Control
 Commission as one of neutraliz-
 ing and obstructing big-power
 intervention,   rather than one
 of investigating impartially
 and fixing guilt without regard
 to possible reactions.   For
 similar reasons,  Nehru was will-
 ing to abandon Indian precedent
 SECRET
 and give military support to
 the UN operation in the Congo.
 He estimated that only by
 interposing the UN between the
 opposing factions could either
 cold war power be prevented
 from gaining a decisive advan-
 tage and a direct clash be
 averted.   Rajeshwar Dayal,  like
 Krishna Menon in the UN or at
 Geneva,  frequently carried the
 balancing act well beyond Nehru's
 general instructions.
 Regional Problems
 National interest dictates
 a different policy when meeting
 a threat affecting India directly.
 India readily assumes the role
 of a big power in neighboring
 Nepal, where privately it feels
 intervention is justified in
 India's defense.   In its border
 dispute with Communist China,
 New Delhi places prime importance
 on the legal rights it  minimizes
 elsewhere,  and stiffly rejects
 Peiping's bids to negotiate a
 compromise.
 Similarly,  in India's
 dispute with Pakistan over
 the Kashmir question, the In-
 dian prime minister leans
 heavily on legalities, has
 repeatedly turned down offers
 to negotiate, and refuses to
 compromise.   Nehru clearly
 feels that his country's in-
 terests are best served by
 maintaining the status quo,
 which leaves India with the
 lion's share of the disputed
 territory.   Moreover, with
 the elections approaching
 and Hindu-Moslem tensions
 rising,  Prime Minister Nehru
 cannot afford to show any
 weakness on this issue.
