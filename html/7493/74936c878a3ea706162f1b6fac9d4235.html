 MAO'S RED GUARD DIPLOMACY:   1967
 For several months during 1967 Communist China's
 diplomacy was characterized by an extraordinary degree
 of irrationality.   In Peking, foreign embassies were
 violated and their personnel abused.   Abroad, Chinese
 diplomatic personnel staged provocative demonstrations
 and went out of their way to insult host ;;overnments.
 The purpose was to bring the benefits and therapeutics
 of Communist Chinas "cultural revolution" to foreign
 policy and the foreign policy establishment.   It was as
 though the Chinese, in their dealings with foreigners,
 were seized by a kind of madness; for a time Peking's
 usual non-diplomacy--or at best semi-diplomacy--gave way
 to outright anti-diplomacy.
 The injection of this aspect or the "spirit of
 Mao" into the foreign ministry and onto the foreign
 scene was resisted by Foreign Minister Chen Yi, a man of
 remarkable courage, outspokenness, and style.   No other
 ranking official has stood so openly and stubbornly
 against Mao's "cultural revolution" and survived.  Only
 the support of his long-time, close colleague Chou En-
 lai, seems to have saved him for the time being.   Although
 partially bent to Mao's will, Chen,  With  Chou's backing,
 won his struggle, at least for the present, to eliminate
 the irrationalities of the "cultural revolution" from
 the main stream of foreign policy.
 This Intelligence Report, produced solely by the
 SRS, reviews and analyzes these and other extraordinary
 aspects of Co                's conduct of foreign affairs
 during 1967.                   is the research analyst respon-
 sible for the UILUOY.

 MAO'S RED GUARD DIPLOMACY:   1967
 Conclusions
 The aberrations which appeared in Peking's foreign
 policy tactics in 1967 reflected Mao's desire to project
 his will to pragmatic subordinates in order to make them
 revolutionary diplomats.   The diplomacy they implemented
 had a revolutionary logic or rationality.   It apparently
 was viewed by Mao as a means to apply pressure to certain
 "unfriendly" governments to attain concessions or to
 retaliate for anti-Chinese actions.,   Beyond Mao's special
 view, however,  this diplomacy was in fact illogical and
 irrational.   The beatings of diplomats,  invasion of em-
 bassy grounds, and export of Mao's cult aroused national-
 istic sensitivities abroad,  and the adverse international
 reaction has been as harmful to Peking's foreign policy
 as Mao's 1958 blunders had been to domestic policy.
 Mao's motives in exporting his cult were political
 as well as egoistical.   He tried to prove to domestic
 critics that his "thought" was used everywhere.   In one
 respect, the burgeoning of the cult in 1966 was roughly
 similar, to the intensification of Stalin's cult when the
 Bolshevik Old Guard was being purged.   The purpose was
 to focus universal attention on the dictator and national
 leader as the only source of supreme power at a time of
 crucial hierarchy realignment,   But Mao's export of his
 cult went well beyond Stalin's practice.   It engaged the
 energies of Chinese diplomats including the Foreign Minister
 for months, detracting from their processional image.
 '.Molotov and his foreign affairs establishment had never
 been put through such a simplistic routine, and Mao's pro-
 jection on the international scene of his cult was a kind
 of peasant ultra-Stalinism which was an innovation on the
 domestic practice of the formed Soviet dictator.

 Dissemination in foreign countries of Mao's cult
 was opposed by Chen Yi in 1966.   In that year, Mao was
 willing to support Chen fi's rational view that foreign
 policy should be immunized from the effects of the domestic
 purge.   But Chen had to retreat early in 1967, when Mao
 apparently changed his mind and dispatched newly indoc-
 trinated diplomats overseas to proselyte his doctrines.
 Partly because he resisted irrationalism in
 foreign policy and partly because he disagreed with the
 methods of the purge as it. was applied to the Foreign
 Ministry, Chen 'ii has been subjected to a dialectical
 policy of criticism and protection.   He is still under
 criticism,  inasmuch as Mao's real aim is to break his will
 and make him accept the methods of the purge "voluntarily."
 Chen Yi and the Foreign Ministry have had in
 Chou En-lai a high-level defender.   Although Madame Mao,
 Chen Po-ta,  and Kang Sheng have also defended the Foreign
 Minister, Chou has been his primary defender and has,  in
 his own words, supported the Foreign Ministry "more than
 anyone else" in the leadership.   Chen's hostility to the
 activities of the Red Guards in his Ministry and to the
 export of Mao's cult have been tantamount to open conspiracy
 against Mao's "cultural revolution."   Other leaders have
 been purged for less,  and only Chou's ability to attain
 a special exemption for Chen can plausibly explain his
 political survival.
 The main consideration for Chou is that Chen is
 his most important and loyal supporter.   Chen apparently
 has a sizeable following throughout the foreign affairs
 establishment,   If Chen were to be purged, a significant
 number of his subordinates would be brought down with him.
 Such an extensive purge would be a clear loss of political
 power in Chou's government balliwick.   It is primarily
 for this reason that Chou has run the risk of antagoniz-
 ing Mao by defending an opponent of his domestic purge.
 Chou's prestige is now committed to the survival of Chen,
 and the downfall of the Foreign Minister in the future
 would be an ominous sign for the stability of Chou's own
 position in the hierarchy of leaders.

 Mao personally sanctioned the return to a degree
 of diplomatic caution in foreign policy in the fall of
 1967.   Only the Chairman himself had the authority to
 reduce the emphasis given to exporting his cult and to
 censure an ambassador for gauche ("revolutionary") behavior.
 He was persuaded, almost certainly by Chou En-lai, that
 governments should be influenced only gradually and at
 a rate of advance carefully adjusted to what the traffic
 of foreign national pride will bear.
 The partial return to more restrained and
 flexible tactics is only the beginning of a long road
 back to refurbishing Peking's influence overseas.   It is
 being undertaken against a background of considerable
 resentment in some of those countries whose governments
 were gratuitously antagonized.   Chinese diplomatic crudities
 probably will be resisted more promptly and vigorously
 than they had been prior to 1967.   In this sense, Red
 Guard diplomacy may continue to have an "irreparable in-
 fluence upon our country's international reputation and
 foreign relations work," as a Red Guard newspaper put it
 in September 1967 in an attack on foreign policy fanatics.
 Only by contrast to the wild fanaticism of 1967
 can Mao's present foreign policy be c haracte'ized as
 rational or normal.   In relations with other countries,
 a residue of militancy remains in Peking's revolutionary
 policy and it will be a constant source of government-to-
 government frictions.

 MAO'S RED GUARD DIPLOMACY:   1967
 1.   Foreign Policy Immunized from Mao's Purge
 In 1966, Mao Tse-tung seemed to be willing to
 wall off Peking's foreign policy from the effects of his
 domestic purge.   Chen Yi was permitted to argue against
 the view that Mao's cult, primarily his "thought," should
 be disseminated by Peking's diplomats.  He was also per-
 mitted to keep his Foreign Ministry personnel in their
 posts.     His rationality was to be tolerated only until
 Mao's "revolution" moved to the left at the end of the
 year.
 A.   The Issue of Exporting Mao's "Thought"
 The idea of reducing one's basic views on poli-
 tics to their core elements and presenting them as a
 capsuled body of doctrine (an "ism" or "thought"),  imbued
 with an aura of immutable truth, was the creation of
 Stalin.    He had to demonstrate to superior men that he
 was not an intellectual "mediocrity" (Trotsky's word).
 Beyond that, he had to demonstrate during his purge of
 former colleagues that he was the dominant leader as well
 as the only theoretical genius.   In the mid-1930s, during
 the first wave of repression which followed the assassina-
 tion of Kirov, the adulatory tone of public references
 to Stalin was greatly intensified and Stalin's image
 began to take on divine attributes.   A similar correla-
 tion between the beginning of a major purge and the burgeon-
 ing of the leader's cult took place in China in 1966,
 Mao's craving for adulation demanded it.   But he also
 seems to have recognized a political axiom:   in the course
 of a realignment of power relationships among top leaders,
 it is important to focus attention on the dominant man
 as the only center of supreme power.
 The idea of encouraging foreign tribute to a
 charismatic leader's cult was conceived by Stalin, and

 his official biography stated in 1947 that "Millions of
 workers from all countries look upon Stalin as their
 teacher,  from whose classic  wi,i tings they learn how to
 cope with the class enemy.,.'   But Mao apparently was con-
 sidering a cruder and more open foreign dissemination of
 his classic works,   In 1966,  the idea of using the diplo-
 matic establishment to take Mao's "thought" overseas ap-
 parently was deoat.eci in the foreign affairs establishment.
 Mao's cult continued to burgeon and even after the editors
 of the Peking People's Daily on 1 June 1966 declared Mao's
 "thought" to be the guide for "all oppressed peoples and
 nations," Chen in the same month told a meeting of Afro-
 Asian writers that "We cannot force them to accept all
 this Mao thought and Cultural Revolution stuff."  Signi-
 ficantly, the writers' communique of 10 June did not re-
 fer to the "thought" or the Cultural Revolution.
 Mao's willingness to keep the effects of his
 purge from damaging Peking's relations w'th other govern-
 ments continued into the fall of 1966.
 Two days after Chen
 declared, in his speech of 23 October, that Peking's
 enemies would not have tie satisfaction of using mainland

 developments to "sow discord" in China's relations with
 friendly countries, Mao seemed to sanction this line by
 including Chen and Chen's wife among officials who were
 present at the Chairman's meeting with Pakistan's visit-
 ing foreign minister.   In late October, Chen refuted Red
 Guard criticism of Peking"s friendly policy toward "reac-
 tionary" governments "such as Pakistan and Cambodia."*
 On 30 November, Chen was introduced to a mass meeting of
 workers by Chou personally, and he rejected the idea of
 establishing Red Guard units in foreign countries, imply-
 ing that the best way to proselyte Mao's "thought" to
 foreigners was to work on visitors to the mainland rather
 than taking it overseas.   In mid-December 1966, when Chi-
 nese envoys were recalled and Red Guards were permitted
 to "make revolution" in the Ministry of Foreign Trade,
 Chen had to retreat.   After personal harassment in January,
 he told                    on 6 February that "Mao Tse-       25X1
 tung's thought applies to underdeveloped countries... and
 I say it applies to Australia [as well]."
 B.   The Issue of Protecting the Foreign Ministry
 Chen's first effort to wall off the Ministry
 from the effects of Mao's purge was in the period from
 May to July 1966, when work teams were sent to each unit
 of the foreign affairs establishment,   He is accused of
 having received orders from Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-
 ping and to have protected the party committee of each
 unit.  According to later charges, in early June 1966,
 h.; reassured leading cadres that they would be permitted
 to retain their posts.   In late June, he directed cadres
 to seize their young militant opponents and he protected
 *According to a poster in Shanghai, Chen had rebutted
 criticism in a speech on 28 October 1966.   He also in-
 sisted that he was not to be placed in the category of
 Mao's political opponents.   "I am on the side of Mao, Lin
 Piao, Chou En-lai, and Kang Sheng, and not with those
 who oppose chem."

 deputy foreign ministers and other professionals.   Chen
 was also criticized for having suppressed militants in
 the Foreign Language institute by sending to the Institute
 work teams directed by the former vice director of the
 State Council's iox?eign Affairs Staff Office, Chang Yen.
 He is said to have subsided only when Chen Po-ta and Kang
 Sheng,  in mid-July and Chou En-lai, in late July, visited
 the  Institute and encouraged the young fanatics to denounce
 the work teams.
 Another major 'mistake'' of Chen's  in this period
 ,was his, desire to maintain a degree of personal integrity
 by not attacking Liu Shao-chi.   When he had to face Insti-
 tute fanatics on 4 August,  he courageously declared him-
 self' against opportunism,   "Chairman Liu's                        instructions
 have my full endorsement. Comrade Shao-chi has put it
 very correctly,  . he is my teacher.... T sent the work
 teams.-and the Central Committee nodded its approval."
 (Red Guard Combat Bulletin, 13 April 1967)   It was to be
 the primary reason for Chen's political survival that Mao,
 Madame 19ao,  and Chou En-lai apparently made a distinction
 oct:ween this expression of personal honesty and aliega-
 tions of disloyalty.
 Chen Yi's foreign affairs machine was moved a
 step closer to a major, overhaul of personnel when Mao,
 on 9 September 1966, declared that in all foreign affairs
 offices abroad there should be a "revolutionization."
 The immediate consequence of Mao's ambiguous instruction
 was an increase in study sessions,  concealment of signs
 of "luxury" living,  and more anti-social behavior during
 diplomatic functions for personnel of all Chinese Commun-
 ist overseas missions,,   It: was later to lead to the re-
 call of large numbers of Peking's diplomats for testing
 and reindoctrination,   It provided the atmosphere far the
 protracted self-criticism rituals which were imposed on
 professional foreign affairs personnel,   Liao Cheng-chih,
 the former chairman of the Commission for Overseas Chinese
 Affairs, was subjected to criticism and self-criticism
 in October 1966 and subsequently has not been rehabilitatea.
 Chen Yi had to engage in a similar ritual of self-disparage-
 ment, but, he seems thus far, to have retained his political

 C.   The Taming of the Foreign Minister:   Stage One
 Chen toad not wi.'lingly accepted the disgrace of
 former colleagues, and he had had the courage to defend
 Liu Shao-chi to the face of young fanatics.   In late sum-
 mer 1966, Mao apparently decided to destroy his ebullient
 spirit and make him slavishly obedient to the methods of
 the purge.   The first stage of this process was to extend
 from August 1966 to January 1967.
 Mao imposed a dialectical policy toward Chen,
 on the one hand encouraging criticism against him and,
 on the other hand, protecting him from a political death.
 On 25 August  Chen
 laccepted personal responsibility for
 "20 mistakes" in foreign policy.  That i;, he had to act
 the role of scapegoat for policies which his superiors,
 especially Chou En-lai, had formulated and implemented.
 On 21 October,  in the course of a general assault on the
 operations of government ministries and the behavior of
 ministers, Foreign Language Institute Red Guards pasted
 posters opposite tie Foreign Ministry building appealing
 for young fanatics to "bombard the Party Committee of the
 Foreign Ministry and burn Chen Yi to death."   Neverthe-
 less, as a protected person, Chen told Red Guards on 11
 November that t'.ere was "a limit to the object of revolu-
 tion when you come to Chung Nan Hai" where government
 offices are iocatcd.   "You cannot charge into a place
 just because you want to.   You cannot expect that a per-
 son will see you just because you want to see him, and
 you cannot refuse to leave just because you have not seen
 the person you want to see..."   Chen still had the authority
 to demand that the fanatics keep out of his Foreign Minis-
 try.
 Chou En-lai seems to have worked with Madame Mao
 to defend Chen's position as a minister loyal to Mao.

 When,  on 10 January 1967, a Red Guard publicly claimed
 that Mao had said that Chen was too pleased with himself
 and not loyal to the party, the Premier denied that the
 Chairman had said anything like that.  Chou said that he
 had not heard it.   Chou also said,  incongruously, that
 even if Mao had, it did not mean that Chen was not trusted
 by Mao.   Madame Mao personally defended the Foreign Minis-
 ter on the crucial matter of non-involvement in anti-Mao
 intrigue-
 Chen fi...has said some wrong things, written
 a few verses,  and said some incorrect things,
 but he is not two-faced.   Strictly speaking,
 he has made mistakes, but we have told him
 this to his face...
 Chen Yi has carried out the Chairman's line.
 He has fought some good battles, and fought
 extremely well in the capture of Shanghai.
 All the same, he has said some incorrect
 things.   He is not,  however, a plotter,  and
 when he has made mistakes, he has corrected
 them a bit... (Madame Mao's speech to Red
 Guards on 10 January 1967)
 It was in the context of defenses of Chen's loyalty
 that Mao permitted the critical half of his dual protect-
 criticize policy to proceed.   On 17 January, Foreign Langu-
 age Institute Red Guards put up a poster, in  he form of
 an open letter to Mao, attacking Chen for having incor-
 rectly believed that certain leaders, such as Ben Bella
 of Algeria, Keita of Mali, and Toure of Guinea could guide
 their countries toward "socialism,"
 Chen was impelled to make a self-criticism
 at a rally of "revolutionary masses" hold on 24 January
 and presided over by Chou.   At the same time, however,
 Chen complained that this self-criticism was made "under
 duress

 Chen said that he had made a mistake in follow-
 ing the "bourgeois line" of Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-
 ping at the start of the "cultural revolution."  He had
 been, he said, responsible for sending out 15 work teams
 to suppress revolutionaries in the foreign affairs depart-
 ments.   He also had to say that he had applied pressure
 to "mass movements" in trying to retain "order" in China's
 diplomatic activities.   Chou and Chen Po-ta appraised his
 self-criticism as "exceedingly good," and the implication
 was that Chen had been exonerated.   It may be conjectured
 that Chou and Chen Po-ta had in fact assisted the Foreign
 Minister in drafting his confession in the knowledge that
 Mao would permit Chen to survive politically only as a
 contrite minister.'"'

 The apparently deliberate foot-dragging of Chou
 and Chen on the matter of permitting foreign experts in
 China to participate in Mao's domestic purge reflects a
 basic difference between their caution and the. Chairman's
 rashness.   The Premier and the Foreign Minister, as ad-
 ministrative veterans, were aware of the complexities and
 risks inherent in carrying out a policy of struggle-par-
 ticipation among experts from different countries who
 have varying political views,  traditional ways of living,
 and contract obligations.   In his speech of 28 January,
 Chen had indicated that there might occur "situations
 where foreign experts are struggling against foreign ex-
 perts" partly because among the men from 60 countries
 who might participate, there were "different trends of
 ideologies among them."   Chen,  and Chou indirectly, had
 calculated correctly.   On 29 May 1967, the first issue
 of Red Star, a paper of the Marxist-Leninist Activists
 working in China as experts, was devoted mainly to a dis-
 pute which had developed between the French-speaking
 Activists and another group of foreign experts, the Rebel
 Bethune Yenan Group.   That is,  the administrators had
 made a pragmatic advance calculation and had been right,
 while the revolutionary all along had been unconcerned
 with pragmatic calculations about matters which satisfied
 his ego,  in this case the ego-gratification of encourag-
 ing foreigners, even on a voluntary basis,  to participate
 in his "cultural revolution."
 Chen Yi's apology of 28 January for delaying such
 participation was made after he had clearly failed to keep
 Mao's purge from radically affecting foreign policy.   By
 the time he had spoken, two irrational elements had been
 inserted into the implementation of foreign affairs, namely,
 the export of Mao's "thought", and the harassment of embas-
 sies.   At the same time, an organizational excrescence
 was grafted onto the Foreign Ministry to provide revolu
 tionary supervision of veteran professionals:  "the

 A sort of peasant, simplicity ma:a'ked the practice of im-
 pFlling trained ambassadors to repeat aloud quotations
 of remarkable banality and irrelevance.   Red Guards later
 rFported Chen  ri's attitude.  "Even as late as 1967, Chen
 Yi said-   '1 do not agree with reading Mao quotations
 abroad an-1 presenting Mao buttons. 111   Molotov had not
 been impelled to implement any absurdity of a similar
 nature by Stalin,  and this policy of Mao's may be char-
 acterized as ultra-Stalinism--that is, the cult carried
 to an irrational extreme.
 Regarding neutral countries, the  first group of
 reindoctrina.ted Chinese diplomats returned to the Chinese
 embassy in Burma in mid -January 1967,    and  in February
 and March,  the symbols of his cult were being disseminated
 in Rangoon and northern Burma.   Proselyting Chinese dip-
 lomats were active in Nepal and Ceylon starting in March,
 and in Cambodia starting in May.   Their actions provoked
 the leaders of these neutral countries to engage in an
 unprecedently vitriolic exchange of mutual recriminations
 with Peking in the spring and summer,  in some instances
 merely adding to already existing tensions and in other
 instances creating new antagonisms.   For example, diplo-
 matic relations with Indonesia and Tunisia were suspended,
 all Chinese aid programs in Burma were closed down, and
 frictions were increased with Cambodia, Ceylon, and Nepal.
 Regarding friendly countries,  neither Pakistan
 nor North Vietnam were made exceptions.       Mao's  "thought"
 was disseminated in Pakistan from the Cninese embassy as
 early as January 1967.   This policy cut directly across
 the grain of Chen Yi's continuing efforts  to placate the
 Pakistanis, at first in the summer of 1966 when he tried
 to mollify the Pakistan ambassador regarding the closing
 of the mosques in Peking after Red Guard rampages, and
 again in his speech of 23 March 1967 when  he pledged that
 Peking's enemies would not succeed in using the "cultural
 revolution" to "sow discord" in Sino-Pak*stani relations.
 The Pakistanis were so anxious to sustain a working rela-
 tionship witn the Chinese that they did not publicize such
 Red Guard outrages as the depredation of Muslim religious
 symbols.   For their part, the Chinese leaders had made

 an unprecedented military-aid investment in the non-Com-
 munist government and they continued to accord the enemy
 of India with a special status.
 The North Vietnamese acted more vigorously to
 prevent proselyting in their country.   They kept NCNA
 accounts of Vietnamese popular love for Mao out of their
 own propaganda media and they implicitly rebuked the Chinese
 Chairman by writing their criticism of his cult between
 the lines of an article in the Ma   13,946377 issue of the
 theoretical journal, Hoc Tap.
 Overseas Chinese
 refugees, who fled to Canton from North Vietnam, indirectly
 confirmed Hanoi's policy of censorship when they complained
 that they had not been permitted to study the Chairman's
 writings there.   Chou En-lai had to deny this:   on 14
 November, he told Red Guards that nonpermission to study
 Mao's "thought" had been an excyse of the refugees who
 were really afraid of being killed by U.S. air strikes.
 Nevertheless,  the Chinese-language newspaper in Hanoi,
 controlled by the Chinese embassy, continued to publish
 praise of Mao's writings in articles intended for local
 Chinese personnel and overseas Chinese.
 Mao apparently believed that the purge of his
 former lieutenants required a demonstration that his
 doctrines were not simplistic or archaic and that they
 in fact had validity for other countries.   Mao used Peking's
 propaganda media and his entire diplomatic machinery to
 act out an international charade and to make believe that
 his "thought" was accepted in all countries.   High-level

 sanction for this policy was implied in Hsieh Fu--chih's
 speech of 18 May (he complained of British efforts to
 restrict "the growing influence" of Mao's doctrines in
 Hong Kong) and in Mao's own statement (he complained in
 mid-summer of 1967 that internationally "there is fear
 of the influence of China, of Mao Tse-tung's thought,
 and of the Great Cultural Revolution").   Mao's persistence,
 throughout the summer of 1967,  in trying to demonstrate
 that his doctrines were acceptable everywhere suggests
 that he not only was unconcerned about foreign ridicule,
 but also that he was obsessed by the desire to attack
 domestic disparagers of his "thought."  Only after Mao's
 policy had created considerable tension in relations with
 Nepal and Cambodia (among other countries) was the Chair-
 man willing to permit Chou En-lai to send personal letters
 of reassurance to King Mahendra in mid-August and Prince
 Sihanouk in late September.
 B.   Embassies Harassed
 The policy of harassing embassies with mass
 demonstrations and temporary strikes by Chinese employees
 was not unprecedented in Communist China.   However, in
 the years prior to the "cultural revolution," diplomatic
 immunity of embassy grounds and personnel had been respected.
 In the fall of 1966, the old practice of abiding by diplo-
 matic restraints seemed to prevail.*  Madame Mao, carrying
 out Peking's reaction to Moscow's 26 August protest demand-
 ing protection of Soviet embassy grounds and personnel,
 told Red Guards on the 28th that "You should not enter
 foreign embassies and consulates, but you can legitimately
 demonstrate outside."  Demonstrations in front of "un-
 friendly" embassies continued within the limits of this
 guideline into 1967 and during the siege of the Soviet
 embassy from 26 January to 11 February.   The temporary

 lull in embassy harassment which followed the retreat
 from the siege of the Soviet mission corresponded roughly
 with the duration of a conservative period in Mao's
 domestic purge.*  Embassies of "friendly" countries (e.g.,
 Albania, North Vietnam, and Pakistan) were kept free from
 the policy of harassment in all periods.
 However, in the period between April and September
 1967, "unfriendly" embassies and their personnel were
 brought under attack.   Diplomatic immunity was transgressed
 in the course of a deliberate procedure and foreign diplo-
 mats were beaten and mission grounds were invaded.   But
 envoys from "unfriendly" countries who were beaten were
 protected from dismemberment or death by special guards
 assigned to them.
 Most of the harassment incidents were planned
 in nature and probably had the ultimate sanction of Mao.
 Demonstrations against the Indonesian embassy were supple-
 mented by Red Guard beatings of two expelled Indonesian
 diplomats in late April in violation of the usage of diplo-
 matic immunity.  Planned harassment was invoked against
 *The failure of Peking Radio, NCNA, and the press to
 carry Chou En-lai's speech which ended the siege on 11
 February may have been a reflection of Mao's displeasure
 with Chou's line of justification.   Following a ppssage
 in which Chou had declared that "there is no need to in-
 trude into the embassy" and that "we have also permitted
 their diplomatic personnel to engage in normal activities,"
 Chou provided a Maoist rationale.  He said that Chairman
 Mao had "taught us in each and every class struggle we
 must slight the enemy strategically and take full account
 of him tactically... This is what we have been doing in
 the current struggle against the Soviet revisionist lead-
 ing clique.   But this by no means illustrates that we are
 weak..."  Mao apparently refused to permit further dis-
 semination of the view that he had taught Red Guards how
 to retreat in the struggle with the Soviet leaders.   There
 was no justification for, or indication of, a retreat in
 the solidly hard anti-Soviet speeches of Chen Yi which
 were publicized internationally on 11 and 15 February.

 the British on the mainland in May in connection with Hong
 Kong, and this was followed by protests against alleged
 British support of  Israel in the war with the Arabs.   On
 16 May,  the British consulate in Shanghai was invaded by
 Red Guards and the charge, Hopson, was besieged on the
 same day in his office in Peking.   The two Shanghai con-
 sulate diplomats were beaten by Red Guards on 24 May.
 Mao's speech criticizing Britain during the Arab-Israeli
 crisis on 6 June was followed the next day by a Red Guard
 entry into the Peking embassy./
 Militants in the Cultural Revolution Group were
 permitted to act in  an extreme leftist way following
 Mao's directive of March 1967 that Red Guards "should not
 only be internal revolutionaries but should also be inter
 national revolutionaries."   According to a Red Guard news-
 paper, after a detailed examination by the Cultural Revo-
 lution Group, Kang Sheng, on 6 June, "formally termed the
 Liu-Teng foreign affairs line as 'three surrenders and
 one annihilation."'*   Wang Li, on 7 August, made an in-
 flammatory speech which encouraged fanatics such as Xao
 Teng-shan to stir up the extreme leftist attitude among
 the Red Guards regarding foreign affairs.
 It was in the context of this sanctioned leftism
 that embassy entry--prohibited by Madame Mao in August
 1966--was permitted.   The entry of British missions in
 May and June by Red Guards was not criticized by regime
 leaders.   On the contrary,  it seems to have been a sanc-
 tioned policy from May to late August, correlated with
 specific regime efforts to apply pressure on London and

 embassy on 5 August seems also to have been a regime-
 planned affair in retaliation for an earlier invasion--on
 the same day--of the Chinese embassy in Djakarta.   The
 regime tried to control the policy and succeeded in pre-
 venting Red Guard spontaneous initiatives from becoming
 unauthorized entries.   For example,  following the 13
 August release of a Soviet ship as a result of Kosygin's
 protest over its detention in Dairen since late July,
 Chinese troops on 14 August sealed off the Soviet embassy
 and kept stone-throwing Red Guards from breaking in.
 The policy of controlled invasion was implemented
 against the "unfriendly" Mongolians.   Following the humilia-
 tion of a Mongolian embassy chauffeur                          (who was badly beaten
 in mid-day on 9 August for having closed the ambassador's
 car door on a photo of Mao thrust at him by Red Guards
 in Peking), young fanatics sped in lorries to the Mongol-
 ian embassy.   Before PLA troops or police were dispatched,
 they entered embassy grounds, climbed up to the second
 story of  the mission building, and painted anti-Mongolian
 slogans on it.   But by early evening, PLA and public
 security forces moved in, surrounded the compound, closed
 the gates, and forbade anyone to enter or leave.   Sub-
 sequent protests by the Foreign Ministry on the 10th and
 demonstrations on the 11th and 12th were more restrained
 affairs.
 Invasion of the Soviet embassy seems to have
 been sanctioned by the regime's leaders.   On 17 August,
 PLA troops, which had been surrounding the embassy for
 several days, apparently acted on an order to led the
 Red Guards through .heir cordon.   The Red Guards stormed
 into the consular office building,  smashed furniture,
 and set fire to records.   In the center of Peking,  a
 Soviet embassy car was attacked and burned.
 Invasion of the British embassy also seems to
 have been planned.   It was part of the leadership's
 retribution against London's failure to capitulate to an
 ultimatum.    When, on 17 August, the Hong Kong authorities
 suspended the publishing permits of three major pro-Com-
 munist newspapers and arrested important staff members,
 Mao apparently was angered by this evidence that he had
 failed to cow the "imperialists."

 On 21 August, "revolutionary journalists" were
 used to launch a demonstration in front of the charge's
 office, and the Chinese leaders made the point clear that
 the British embassy was their primary target by reducing
 the size and virulence of  the demonstrations in front of
 the Ceylonese, Mongolian,  and Kenyan embassies.   After
 the British rejected the ultimatum and began prosecuting
 the arrested newspapermen, Mao was confronted with the
 choice of backing down from o_^ carrying through the threat
 to subject the British to "serious consequences."   Shortly
 after the expiration of  the 48-hour deadline at 10;00 PM
 on 22 August, Red Guards were let into the embassy com-
 pound by PLA troops and police who had surrounded it.
 Subsequent denials by Chou En-lai and Madame
 Mao (among others) that  the Chinese leaders had been
 responsible for the invasion and the burning of the
 charge's rffice failed to mention the crucial matter of
 the ultimatum committing them to some form of retribution
 against the British.   Nevertheless,  the Red Guards ap-
 parently exceeded their authority by burning the charge's
 office and beating members of his staff,  including women.
 The subsequent de-escalation of the policy of
 harassing embassies probably reflected Mao's acceptance
 of Chou's view that several governments were seriously
 considering a drastic reduction of their missions in Pek-
 ing, and that some were even prepared to suspend diplo-
 matic relations.                                   dates the eas-
 ing of tensions among worried diplomats in Peking to 29
 August.   On that day, a large-scale and carefully organized
 Red Guard demonstration near the Soviet embassy was in
 progress when PLA troops suddenly rolled up in trucks
 and dispersed the crowd with loudspeakers. From that time
 on                                diplomatic missions felt a

 the atmosphere among the foreign diplomatic community.*
 In early September, a Chinese Foreign Ministry protocol
 officer began to express "regrets" regarding the haras-
 sments of the spring and summer.
 Developments suggest that Mao had permitted the
 Cultural Revolution Group to continue on a leftist course
 against the embassies and that Chou reluctantly had ac-
 cepted this course.   That is, Mao had tolerated the ram-
 pages stimulated by such Group militants as Wang Li and
 Chi P.n-yu, who used Yao Teng-shan to stir up an extrem-
 ist attitude throughout the foreign affairs establishment
 in August.   Wang Lis speech of 7 August was made, and
 acted on by Yao, only because these militants believed
 they had Mao's sanction to be "revolutionary."   When Chou
 intervened later in August, it was Mao who had to be
 persuadel to withdraw his sanction.  The burning of the
 British charge's office provided Chou with the outrage
 to use in arguing Mao back to rationality at a time when
 he was willing to return to reason.  More importantly,
 Wang Li was a Cultural Revolution Group militant who had
 just committed Mao to a greater danger on the internal
 scene.   In the wake of the July Wuhan incident, Wang ap-
 parently had helped to incite a nationwide attack on the
 army, creating a real possibility of PLA disaffection.
 The retreat from the fanaticism on this internal matter
 made it easier for Chou to justify a retreat on the ex-
 ternal scene.
 *Following the 1 September meeting of the enlarged
 Peking Municipal Revolutionary Committee, wall posters
 in Peking carried Chou's "five prohibitions," which were
 (1) do
 not
 beat diplomats,
 (2)
 do
 not stone embassies,
 (3) do
 not
 burn embassies,
 (4)
 do
 not enter diplomats'
 houses,
 and
 (5) do not violate
 the
 boundaries of the
 diplomatic missions.
 On 7 October, with the issuing of a joint Central
 Committee-State Council directive, Red Guards were warned
 and embassies were reassured that Chou's prohibitions had
 become national law.

 There is some evidence that the immediate target
 of Wang Li was Chen Yi, and that the ultimate target was
 the prestige and position of Chou En-lai,   Wang's attack
 on the Foreign Ministry was made at a time when Chou "more
 than anyone else" had been supporting the Ministry.   (Chou's
 speech of 2 September 1967)
 Kang Sheng,  however, seems to have joined in the
 defense of Chou and Chen after the internal and external
 line moved to the right.   On 1 September he told Red Guards
 that they must make    distinction between the formulators
 of  the "three surrenders, and one annihilation" foreign
 policy line--namely,     Liu Shao-chi,  Teng Hsiao-ping,  and
 Wang Chia-hsiang--and Chen Yi;   "1f Chen Yi has errors,
 he can make a self-examination."   In this speech, Kang's
 ominous remark- '"it is certain that foreign relations
 circles have enemies;  I have evidence, but I shall not
 publicize it today"--suggests that the information later
 cited by Red Guard posters and newspapers in attacking
 Yao Teng-shan were supplied by Mao's foremost party police-
 man.   Kang may also have supplied the materials which were
 later used to disgrace Wang Li and finally Chi Pen-yu.
 Chou seemed to be protecting a base of personal
 j.ower. In his speech of 2 September, Chou not only com-
 plained that Yao 'Teng-shan had interfered in the work of
 the foreign policy specialists, but also he was angered
 b  Yao's effort to "to ple" Chen.
 Regarding the temporary seizing of power in the
 Foreign Ministry by the rebel "liaison station," Chou
 castigated the Peking Foreign Language Rebel Regiment for
 having instigated the attempt.   He also attacked Yao
 Teng-shan for certain wild actions in various sections
 of the Foreign Affairs establishment, but the subsequent
 Red Guard accusation that Yao had become the Foreign
 Minister for four days between 19 and 23 August is exag-
 gerated.   The context of his remarks suggest that it was

 the 7th, that he (Chou) had been the strongest voice raised
 in defense of Chen's ministry.   "I supported the Foreign
 Ministry in the Central Committee more than anyone else
 and I shall be responsible to the Central Committee."
 (Quoted in Reed Guard Newspaper, 15 September 1967)
 III.  Foreign Policy Restored to Normalcy
 The end of the em bass harassment policy in
 late August was abrupt.
 But Mao frequently has reversed a major line drastically.*
 Not only Chinese employees of foreign embassies, but also
 important Chinese diplomats were surprised by the sudden
 reversal of line on the matter of exporting Mao's "thought"
 and revolutionary doctrines.
 *He is the only leader with sufficient power in the
 regime to be able by fiat to change a basic policy.   This
 despotic and dictatorial power and this tendency to switch
 to new lines suddenly had been criticized privately in
 the CCP.   Mao reported this criticism of his Stalinist
 peremptory style of leadership:  "I have 'come to the de-
 clining years like Stalin.'   I am 'despotic and dictator-
 ial' giving you neither 'freedom' nor 'democracy.'   I
 am  'craving for greatness and success'  and being 'partial.'
 I have 'set a bad example to those under me.'   I am also
 one who 'would not change direction until he comes to
 the end of his wrong course,' and 'once he turns, he
 turns 180 degrees. 11'   (Mao's comment of 15 August 1959,
 presumably quoting from statements made at the time by
 Peng Te-huai or his allies)
 In late August 1967, the "end of his wrong course"
 was reached partly because of the prospect that foreign
 embassies would engage in a large-scale exodus from Pek-
 ing.

 A.  Chou's Major Role
 As a consequence of a top leadership conference
 held in Peking from 21 to 27 October to discuss ways to
 bolster their damaged image overseas and improve their
 hegemony over the world revolutionary movement, reassur-
 ing messages were sent out to certain friendly countries.
 In addition, Chou was permitted by Mao to be realistic
 about proselyting revolution and Mao's "thought" abroad,
 and in two speeches in late December 1967, he reasserted
 a degree of pragmatic realism into Peking's tactics.
 Speaking to workers in the foreign affairs field
 in late December 1967, Chou invoked the name of Mao to
 underscore the authority of the new line.
 In foreign affairs, we have to concentrate
 on revolutionizing ourselves and not others.
 In international relations there are certain
 norms which we must respect.   [A] majority
 of the countries we deal with are imperialist,
 revisionist, or reactionary, and not leftist.
 Chairman Mao said:   'Our embassy in the
 Congo (B) praised the Premier of the Congo (B)
 and not the President.   Again our embassy
 has emphasized certain things such as on
 invitation cards they have written Mao quo-
 tations.  As a result, relations have be-
 come tense.'   Therefore, Chairman Mao,
 while meeting with the Prime Minister of
 the Congo (B) [on 3 October] personally
 told him:   'Your President has acted cor-
 rectly  [in boycotting the Chinese embassy
 reception on National Day].   He has cor-
 rected for us our Great Power Chauvinism.'
 Chairman Mao said this three times.
 The export of Mao's "thought" was to be carried out in
 a more tactful manner and Red Guards need not be organized
 in foreign countries.   Speaking to an Afro-Asian Writers'
 Conference in late December 1967, Chou stated that Peking
 did not desire slavish imitation of China by other countries.

 Referring to Japan, Chou laid it down that such actions
 as forced readings of Mao's quotations by the Chinese-
 oriented friendship association was excessive and unneces-
 sary.   This retreat from the gauche aspects of export of
 Mao's '-thought'  was to be a temporary victory for Chen
 Yi.
 But before Chen was to resume his Foreign Minister
 duties, Chou worked with a small ad hoc staff in the Min-
 istry.            He apparently set up a "Supervisory Sub-Committee,"
 probably to restrict the role of the "liaison station"
 while it was engaged in "rectification."  He apparently
 restored the authority of the Ministry's Party Committee.
 The "Supervisory Sub-Committee'?--which stressed supervi-
 sion rather than operational control--and the Party Com-
 mittee were directed by Chou on 18 October to inform his
 Private Office and the Peking garrison in the event that
 Ministry archives ""both official and personal should be
 touched."   This was a warning against any repetition of
 the invasion of the Ministry and pilfering of some of its
 confidential files by militant members of the Foreign
 Language Institute or by any other unauthorized persons.
 Chou temporarily seemed to be depending on these two com-
 mittees to send along all major foreign policy matters
 for decision to his personal office.   That is,  they as-
 sumed the Foreign Minister's functions prior to Chen Yi's
 return to political and physical health.   They also seem
 to have acquired a watchdog function over personnel dur-
 ing the "cultural revolution."
 Ministry professionals were still subjected to
 criticism, but they were protected from personal abuse.
 Chou's directive of 18 October specified that the Minis-
 try's "four great movement"--i.e., 'struggle against self,
 criticize revisionism,  pay attention to affairs of the
 nation, and carry out the Cultural Revolution to the end"--
 was "permissible" provided that officials were subjected
 only to reasoning rather than "beating, dragging out,
 or 'plucking out."'   Some old professionals were exoner-
 ated and re-established official contacts with foreign
 embassies.   Others,  including Liao Cheng-chih of the Com-
 mission for Overseas Chinese Affairs, were beyond redemp-
 tion.            His Commission may have been absorbed by the Foreign

 Ministry.   Some Deputy Foreign Ministers resumed a fair
 degree of their former daily functions, but others, such
 as Wang Ping-nan, who wAs  'struggled" but not exonerated
 on 18 October, may still be  in trouble.
 B.   The Taming of the Foreign Minister:   Stage Two
 Mao's dialectical po;icy of protection-criticism
 toward Chen Yi reflects a special concern of Chou En-lai
 to sustain Chen in his post.   Mao and his wife apparently
 have sufficient trust in Chou to accept his sympathetic
 view of Chen.   The second stage of the criticism of Chen
 extended from April to September 1967.
 Only the hypothesis that Chou is the leader most
 concerned with preserving Chen in his posts can account
 for the fact that Mao has not purged a man who had at
 one time derided his "thought," who defended the integrity
 of men after they were condemned, and who criticized the
 methods of Mao's creatures.  the Red Guards.
 Chen's resurgence within the Foreign Ministry
 against the "liaison station" in the conservative period
 of February and March 1967 was made at a time when Chou
 had complained (mid-February) that the ignorant fanatics
 in the Ministry had gone "too far" in their supervision
 of professionals.   Chen later admitted that on 12 Febru-
 ary, he had "openly scolded the rebels."  Red Guards later
 revealed that in the conservative period Chen, at a For-
 eign Ministry cadres' meeting, banged on the table and
 shouted:   "In the past,  you have put up many big char-
 acter posters about me.   Now I am going to have my say."
 Chen proceeded to criticize the "liaison station" during
 its temporary retreat ("rectification") within the Minis-
 try and to put "pressure on the revolutionary masses" so
 that high-level Ministry officials could "recover their

 posts?"  Chen's basic goal was to protect Foreign Minis-
 try personnel.*   When the consei vative period was reversed
 and Chen was again brought under attack, starting on 2
 April, Chen Po-to--who had defended the Foreign Minister
 on the same platform with Chou on 24 January--acted to
 keep criticism within limits.   On 16 April, Chen Po-ta
 replied to the request of the "liaison station" for a
 face-to-face confrontation with Chen Yi by saying that
 Chen,  as the Foreign Minister,. is representing the state,
 that  they must not come to "drag out" Chen, and that they
 should give him a chance to correct his errors.   Chen Po-
 ta then evoked the name of Chou En-lai as the leader who
 was "presently and directly" in charge of the Foreign
 Ministry to deter the young fanatics from abusing Chen.
 The unmoll.ified "liaison station" nevertheless persisted,
 and on 19 April demanded that Chen be brought down.
 Under the dual policy of leadership protection
 and Red Guard criticism, Chen was permitted to participate
 in diplomatic functions in April.  Criticism was sustained
 throughout May.  a French embassy official reported the
 exultation of an "ignorant" young diplomatic guide who
 declared that Chen's influence in the Ministry had been
 reduced, and the British charge noted at the end of the
 month that Chen was constantly surrounded by "aides" and
 had a "haggard appearance,"  Chou had to swim with the
 tide of anti-Chen criticism.   He apparently believed that
 Mao continued to approve of the existence of the "liaison
 station" within the Foreign Ministry,   he gave "full sup-
 port, come what may, to the liaison station set up by the
 revolutionaries to lead revolution and supervise business
 *In general perspective, a primary crime of Chen Yi
 was his desire to preserve the veterans in his Ministry:
 "To sum up, Chen Yi wants to protect all the 'old revolu-
 tionaries,' all the old staff, all the old diplomats, all
 who have professional ability, regardless of their poli-
 tical coloration, and this is not a proletarian approach
 at all."   (Article by the Revolutionary Rebel Committee
 of the Foreign Affairs and Political Departments of the
 CCP Central Committee in Foreign Affairs Red Flag, 8

 operations"   (Chou speech of 26 May).   On the other hand,
 he apparently believed that Mao did not approve of Red
 Guard attacks on the Foreign Ministry;    in the same speech,
 he criticized outside Red Guard units for  invading the
 Ministry's confidential files on 13 May and for storming
 the State Council's Foreign Affairs Staff Office on 29
 May.
 Dialectically, Mao continued to protect Clhcii.
 The Chairman had Chen join him and Lin Piao during; t:a 1. 1:s
 with the visiting president of Zambia on 24 June.   The
 protective half of Mao's policy was sustained, and a wall-
 poster put up in Peking on 1 August stated that the CCP
 Central Committee had ascertained that "Vice Premier and
 concurrently Foreign Minister Chen Yi" as well as Li Hsien-
 nien and Yu Chiu-li "are men of Chairman Mao's command."
 The critical half was kept within limits in
 early August, primarily because Chou En-lai had laid down
 general guidelines for it.    But in late August,  the young
 fanatics temporarily exceeded these limits.   In August
 and September, Chen was subjected to seven criticism meet- 25X1

 This did not mean that Chen was permanently to
 be shielded from semi-public or private criticism sessions.
 Mao's apparent awareness that more than one year of per-
 secution is necessary to break the will of an ebullient
 and intelligent man was implied in the statement of Chou
 En-lai on 16 September that Mao had declared- "Chen Yi has
 still to be first criticized and then protected."  At a

 held in the Foreign Ministry on 18 September, Chen was
 impelled to say to young fanatics:   "Your criticism is
 fine and thorough.   I bow my head and admit my guilt be-
 fore Chairman Mao and before the revolutionary young
 fighters."   (Quoted in Shumchun Reference  News, 17
 November 1967)
 The formal reassertion of Chen's authority in
 the Foreign Ministry followed his self-abasement on 18
 September.
 Also in late November, NCNA referred to Cheri as "Foreign
 Minister" and he was reported                       to be        25X1

 hours a day.
 Mao's sustained persecution of Chen Yi was not
 merely motivated by a desire to test his political loyalty
 to himself, Lin Piao, and Madame Mao.   That matter had
 been ascertained earlier, as witness Madame Mao's and
 Chou En-lai's 10 January 1967 defense of the Foreign
 Minister on the important issue of whether Chen was an
 anti-Mao plotter.  Mao seems to have been motivated by

 a passion to break Chen's determination to be honest
 about comp ades, rational about foreign policy, and
 moderate in the persecution of the "cultural revolution.'"
 Chen was loyal to Mao, but he would not willingly accept
 the purge or professionals. He would not accept will-
 ingly the irrationality of imposing a supervision by
 ignorant young fanatics ('"ignorant" as attested to by
 foreign diplomats in Peking) on intelligent foreign
 policy veterans.   He had to be impelled to accept the
 egregious policy of exporting Mao's ego-cult.   Yet Mao
 wanted Chen to accept these matters "voluntarily," that
 is, under terror and psychological pressure.   Just how
 "voluntary' Chen's final submission had been, when Chen
 "bowed his head" on 27 Augus
 Chen is still to be "first criticized and then
 protected," as Mao put it.   This obviously is a course
 that Chou does not desire for Chen, but he may believe
 that it is better to have half of Chen than no Chen at
 all.  Chen is loyal to Chou and is therefore a reliable
 aide to have in the course of any future maneuvering for
 position in the hierarchy of leaders.  Chen apparently
 has a sizeable following throughout the foreign affairs
 establishment and these forces may well represent a reli-
 able source of support for Chou.   Nevertheless, Chou has
 to accept Mao's dialectical protection-criticism policy
 against Chen and the role of scapegoat for foreign policy
 "mistakes" that has been imposed on the Foreign Minister.
 Chou has had to resort to various flabby argu-
 ments to jistify retaining Chen,    He told young fanatics
 on 16 September 1967 that "This minister, Chen Yi, is
 different from other ministers.   This is a question af-
 fecting China's reputation and prestige in the interna-
 tional sphere."  He has also had to use flabby arguments
 in setting himself apart from Chen's "mistakes"--such
 as the "serious mistake in the question of Algeria.   He
 held that it was a revolution, but I saic' it was a coup
 d'etat."  While complying with the policy of using Chen
 as the foreign policy scapegoat, Chou apparently still

 hopes to preserve his political health.   Chen's fate will
 depend on how much Mao is willing to accept Chou's view
 of Chen as still loyal.   But it will also depend on Chen's
 willingness to demonstrate to the Chairman that he is an
 obedient captive who will accept the methods of Mao's
 domestic purge.
 C.   Prospects
 Although selective harassment of embassies sub-
 sided in late August,  the policy of selective holding of
 hostages has been sustained as a political weapon to
 retaliate for anti-Chinese actions abroad or to gain con-
 cessions on special issues.   The hostage policy is almost
 certainly viewed by the Chinese leaders as less likely
 to lead to a break in diplomatic relations than embassy
 harassment and physical abuse of foreign envoys.   Never-
 theless, even the more rational Chinese leaders indicated
 in the directive of 7 October that Peking will carry out
 demonstrations and other "political expressions of will"
 in front of the embassies "if it is thought necessary."
 Mao may now permit Chou and Chen to try to re-
 store Peking's prestige overseas by using a policy of
 "dosage."   That is,  he may now accept their view that
 gradual and cautious methods must be used to advance revo-
 lutionary policies, that advances must be made only with
 a view to what the traffic in each country will bear.
 "Friendly" countries once again are feeling the effects
 of relatively restrained and rational diplomacy.   But
 the list of "unfriendly" countries has expanded since 1966.
 Mao apparently has stopped deluding himself that
 a clear loss of prestige, indicated by Peking's isola-
 tion in 1967,  is really a clear gain.   However,  it is
 not to be expected that he will discontinue his long-term
 policy of supporting revolutions overseas. His comment
 on this policy in mid-1967 seems to be an indication of
 the course he will continue to pursue.  As he put it some-
 time after the Arab-Israeli crisis of June 1967:
 -29-

 Our China is not only the political center
 of world revolution, but also should be-
 come the military and technological center
 of world revolution.   We should give them
 arms and can now openly give them arms, in-
 cluding clearly inscribed Chinese weapons
 (except in certain areas).   We intend to
 give open support to become the arsenal
 of world revolution.
 Support of insurrections will be sustained because it is
 an obsession of Mao's that has not changed.   He obviously
 views himself as the leader of all leftist revolutions.*
 The return to a more flexible but still revolu-
 tionary policy is only the beginning of a long road back
 to refurbishing Peking's influence- overseas,   It is being
 undertaken against a background of resentment in some of
 those countries whose governments were gratuitously anta-
 gonized.                         Chinese diplomatic crudities probably will be
 resisted more promptly and vigorously than they had been
 prior to 1967.   In this sense, Red Guard diplomacy may
 continue to have an "irreparable influence upon our coun-
 try's international reputation and foreign relations
 work," as the Red Guard Newspaper put it on 15 September
 1967.   Although the paper attributed Peking's impaired
 overseas image to Yao Teng-shan,  the real responsibility
 for this policy aberration must be Mao's.
 *Mao's Stalin-awareness almost certainly is reflected
 in his desire to surpass the dead Soviet dictator in in-
 ternational prestige as the revolutionary leader par ex-
 cellence.  Mao has had Stalin praised for "greatly assist-
 ing the revolutionary struggles of all peoples," but it
 is necessary that the image of Stalin as an advocate of
 world revolution should not dwarf Mao's.   Whenever Mao
 permits his aides to defend Stalin, they apparently are
 required to sustain the pretense of Mao s superiority,
 pontificating on the merits "and mistakes" of the Russian.

 The morale of foreign policy personnel is prob-
 aibly at an unprecedently low point.   Leadership insist-
 ence that Peking's international situation is "excellent"
 apparently has not been accepted by working-level offi-
 cials.                                Signs of disillusionment were reflected in the
 December 1967 speech of one official:
 Some comrades will ask:   In what respect
 can the present situation be described as
 excellent?  Since China is opposed every-
 where and setbacks are encountered every-
 where, how can the situation be described
 as good?
 In addition to cynicism regarding policy failures, many
 diplomats are still being subjected to indoctrinatioli
 and testing, and this process in itself is sufficiently
 callous to terrorize the ranks.   But V.ao seems to be less
 concerned about morale than the perpetuation of his
 "cultural revolution" in all areas of the Peking regime.
