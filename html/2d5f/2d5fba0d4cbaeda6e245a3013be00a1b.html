 Guangdong: Hothouse for Zhao's Reforms
 Summary
 During January, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang called on China's
 coastal provinces to adopt an export-oriented growth strategy so they
 could serve as "engines" of growth for backward interior regions.  As part
 of -this strategy, Zhao has given Guangdong Province the green light on
 financial, land use, price, and foreign trade reforms:  We believe Zhao
 hopes Guangdong will not only take the lead in promoting his export
 strategy, but also serve as a reform showcase for other provinces.
 Given Guangdong's strong economy, its access to Hong Kong
 markets and capital, and Zhao's patronage, it should be able to push ahead
 with these reforms.  Other coastal areas will almost certainly try to follow
 suit, taking their cue from Zhao's call to "learn from Guangdong."  The
 introduction of these policies to more backward provinces is likely to be
 much slower, however.  Zhao will have to guard against the kind of
 foreign exchange drain and corruption similar trade decentralization
 This memorandum was prepared by              (Office of East Asian Analysis.      25X1
 Information available as of 21 January 1988 was used in its preparation.  Comments and
 queries are welcome and may be directed to the Chief, Political Assessments Branch,

 policies encouraged in 1983-85.  For the coastal provinces to act as a
 catalyst for growth in the interior over the long run, moreover, reformers
 will have to find more effective ways to break down internal trade barriers.
 Worried about shortages, for example, Hunan and Jiangxi recently placed
 embargoes on the sale of pork and other goods to Guangdong.  As the
 coastal areas grow richer, this kind of protectionism could grow worse.
 Learning From Guangdong
 Asserting that China's comparative advantage in labor costs gives it an historic
 opportunity to succeed South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan as a leading producer of
 labor-intensive export manufactures, Zhao recently called on China's coastal provinces
 to take the lead in pursuing an export-oriented strategy.  In the coming year, Zhao
 hopes Guangdong Province--already China's leading exporter--will serve as a model for
 the other coastal provinces by implementing an ambitious package of reforms.  Indeed,
 in a recent series of inspection tours, he urged the leaders of Shanghai, Jiangsu, and
 Fujian to go to Guangdong and learn from its example.
 According to Chinese and Hong Kong press sources, Zhao Ziyang presented his
 plan for further reforms in Guangdong to the new Politburo at its first plenary meeting
 on 14 November, after receiving the support of Deng Xiaoping.  Three days later,
 Guangdong Governor Ye Xuanping officially informed Guangdong's leaders that Beijing
 wanted the province to become an "experimental zone for overall reforms"--a hothouse
 for China's next round of economic restructuring.  In return, Beijing promised to grant
 Guangdong greater freedom in economic decision making.  These experiments will
 include price, management, wage, and foreign investment reforms, as well as a major
 expansion of Guangdong's export-oriented  Pearl River Economic Zone, according to
 statements by provincial leaders (see list of initiatives in appendix A).
 We believe Zhao chose this local hothouse strategy because the Beijing
 leadership is not. ready to proceed nationwide with a new package of economic reforms.
 The recently announced 1988 reform plan--which shied away from most
 market-oriented policies--reflects the clear lack of consensus among the top leaders
 about the direction of reform.  Beijing's agenda is also too full with the upcoming
 restructuring of central party and government organs to tackle a controversial new set
 of reforms.  Finally, the current central government emphasis on price stability is not
 conducive to radical departures that may exacerbate excess capital construction, deficits,
 and inflation.  For now, Zhao can promote major reforms in the friendly soil of provinces
 like Guangdong, while waiting for economic and political conditions to improve before
 pushing them nationwide.

 Guangdong's Assets Abound
 the reform program in Guangdong is far
 ahead of other provinces'.  In several key .areas of deregulation-such as price reform,
 managerial autonomy from official interference, and market allocation of both consumer
 and producer goods--Guangdong's reformers have been able to implement policies that .
 have stymied their counterparts elsewhere (see below).
 As Zhao's proving ground for the next stage of reforms, Guangdong enjoys
 numerous advantages:
 Guangdong's proximity to Hong Kong has provided a stream of investment
 capital, family remittances, managerial talent, and manufacturing jobs unmatched
 in the rest of China.  According to official Chinese statistics, 54 percent of all the
 paid-in direct foreign investment in China since 1979 has gone into Guangdong,
 most of it from Hong Kong and the overseas Chinese community.  Hong Kong
 manufacturers also see Guangdong as a convenient haven from the crown
 colony's high land prices and shortage of cheap labor.  As one put it, "Hong Kong
 is the storefront, and (Guangdong's) Pearl River Delta is the factory."  Hong Kong
 electronics industry analysts estimate that Hong Kong-financed electronics firms
 alone employ between 500,000 and 1 million of Guangdong's 62 million residents.
 Blessed with this constant supply of capital, jobs, and export markets,
 Guangdong's reformers face fewer unemployment worries than other provinces
 as they try to force local enterprises to either produce more efficiently or face
 closure (for a comparison of the economy in Guangdong and elsewhere, see .
 appendix B).
 ?   The current Guangdong leadership is stable and proreform.  It is also extremely
 well connected, not only to Zhao, but to .other Beijing- leaders-- many of whose
 children hold posts in the province.  Party Secretary Lin Ruo is the chief heir to
 Zhao Ziyang's network of "Northern Cadres," who have helped lead Guangdong
 since 1950.  Governor Ye Xuanping--eldest son of the late Politburo Member Ye
 Jianying--still enjoys great family prestige in both Beijing and his native
 Guangdong.
 ?   Because the local economy is prosperous--jobs are available, wages higher than
 elsewhere in China--workers have been able to pay higher prices for consumer
 goods and foodstuffs.  This has encouraged peasants and industries in other
 provinces to "export" their products to Guangdong in search of higher profits.  As'
 a result, Guangdong officials have faced less severe political problems from
 inflation, goods shortages, and worker discontent than other provinces.

 Guangdong's Reforms: A Strong Base
 Though reform in Guangdong has proceeded unevenly, Guangdong was
 the first province to seize the initiative in "opening up to the outside world,"
 and it remains China's leading reform province
 In 1979, with State Council approval, Guangdong opened three of China's
 four Special Economic Zones (SEZs)--in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou.  In
 1985, Guangdong also granted the Pearl River Delta region special authority to
 promote foreign investment.  By the end of 1986, over 65 percent of all the
 Sino-foreign and foreign firms in China were in ,Guangdong.
 According to State reporting, Guangdong leads most regions in wage and
 labor reforms.  The lifetime employment system, which makes it difficult or
 impossible for managers to fire unproductive workers, is less widespread in
 Guangdong than elsewhere.  Factories are also freer to adjust worker pay to.
 reward productivity..Temporary labor service companies in the province also
 help factory managers cut the permanent staff and control labor costs.
 Price reform has proceeded further in Guangdong than anywhere else in
 China, not only on foods and consumer goods, .but also on producer goods
 traded between enterprises.  According to both State and provincial estimates,
 over 70 percent of all prices in the province are now "market" prices--although
 many still float within officially fixed ranges.l As a rough benchmark, Zhao's
 most optimistic .statements to date call for 70 percent of China's economy to be
 market regulated by three years from now.  Resourceful local officials have
 avoided a return to rationing, recently revived in other provinces.  Instead, they
 have developed elaborate systems of subsidies, imports, and compensatory
 taxes to keep prices market responsive yet within reach of local consumers.
 Guangdong also has made substantial progress in financial reform.  State
 officers report that most industrial expansion is financed through bank
 loans--rather than government allocations--and banks insist more strongly on
 the creditworthiness of potential borrowers.  Several Guangdong cities have
 also established foreign exchange centers, whose exchange rates are close to
 local market (that is, black-market) prices.
 1  The 70 percent figure for price decontrol is measured by gross commodity value,
 rather than number of goods.

 ?  Guangdong's traditional emphasis on collectively or individually owned,
 small-scale, consumer goods enterprises--whose production is less controlled by
 Beijing's central line ministries--reduces central interference and leaves
 Guangdong freer to respond to market shifts.  Indeed, only about 17 percent of
 Guangdong's industrial workers are employed by state-owned enterprises, in
 contrast to heavy industry -oriented Shanghai or the Northeast, where figures as
 high as 50 percent are common.
 ?   Guangdong is permitted to keep a higher percentage of its annual revenues than
 other relatively developed provinces:  Guangdong has contracted with Beijing to
 remit 1 billion Yuan per year to the central government (less than one-seventh of
 total provincial revenues).  Shanghai, by comparison, has until recently been
 forced to remit about 75 percent of its revenues, a much heavier burden.
 But Reform Entails Risks
 Despite these advantages, we believe that Guangdong officials will proceed
 carefully in implementing further reforms.  Guangdong's inflation rate, for example, is the
 highest in China, prompting many delegates to the recent provincial People's Congress
 to complain publicly that prices for pork, vegetables, and other foods have risen too
 quickly.  Provincial reformers have already worked out elaborate price support schemes,
 as well as set aside over 400 million yuan in subsidy money, to ease the blow to
 consumers, according to State reporting.
 Further grants of local autonomy may fuel corruption and create severe,
 unintended economic problems that require Beijing to reassert control.  In late 1984, for
 example, officials in Guangdong and the SEZs--abusing relaxed foreign trade
 regulations--depleted foreign exchange reserves by importing large quantities of goods 25X1
 and reselling them illegally for private gain on the domestic market.
 many of these resale schemes were thrust upon Guangdong and the SEZs by                25X1
 Beijing ministries and other provincial authorities eager to cash in on the SEZs' special
 autonomy to make profits for themselves on the lucrative black market.  When Beijing
 conservatives attacked such transgressions, Deng and Zhao were forced to tighten
 controls on trade and foreign exchange                                                          25X1
 Looking at Guangdong's proposed 1988 reform package (appendix A), we see
 similar potential for abuse.  We expect, for example, that some local officials in the
 newly expanded Pearl River Economic Zone will take advantage of their new foreign
 trade and investment autonomy to divert resources to lucrative resale businesses or
 local pork-barrel projects.  We also believe it is likely that officials in other parts of
 China will again try to enrich themselves by taking advantage of Guangdong's new grant
 of autonomy.  Other provinces might, for example, attempt to establish bogus "joint
 ventures" with Guangdong firms to get access to liberal foreign exchange retention
 policies.

 Guangdong authorities will also have to contend with growing trade restrictions
 by neighboring provinces.  Officials in Beijing and the poorer provinces that border
 Guangdong maintain that Guangdong's reforms have succeeded at the expense of its
 neighbors.  Resentful of shortages in their own provinces, Hunan and Jiangxi recently
 restricted sales of such products as pork and grain to Guangdong, and have levied
 heavy fines on illegal exporters.  Precise estimates of the potential damage to
 Guangdong from such embargoes are impossible, but Guangzhou officials have noted
 that city markets receive between a third and a half of their pork supply from outside
 the province.  Further decontrol of industrial and consumer goods prices in Guangdong,
 and the price rises certain to follow, could, in our view, invite further reprisals against
 Guangdong.
 "The Great War of Live Pigs"
 Guangdong has recently faced political attacks from other provinces
 envious of its success.  The 1985 decontrol of pork prices in Guangdong, for
 example, drove market prices in Guangdong far above those permitted in Hunan.
 In early 1987, "floods" of profit-seeking Hunan farmers drove their hogs to
 Guangdong for sale, touching off what People's Daily called the "Great War of
 Live Pigs" between the two provinces.  Faced with declining supplies and rising
 pork prices at home, the Hunan provincial government "closed the borders" to
 pork exports, fining farmers 50 Yuan per hog if they were caught transporting
 hogs into Guangdong.  In its recent report lauding Guangdong's price reforms,
 People's Daily approvingly noted that Hunan farmers were undeterred, and
 continued to sneak out their hogs to more profitable Guangdong markets. ~
 Looking- Ahead
 Thus far, Zhao has been relatively successful in silencing high-level critics of
 Guangdong and the SEZs.  Since late December, for example, conservative leaders Peng
 Zhen, Bo Yibo, and Wang Zhen--who a year ago led the attack on "bourgeois
 liberalism"--have visited Guangdong and publicly praised its achievements in reform and
 opening to the outside.  Recent removals of conservatives in the party discipline
 inspection and propaganda sectors--both of which have harassed local reformers in the
 past--will further weaken reform opponents' ability to interfere in Guangdong.  Locally,
 recent personnel moves have further strengthened Guangdong's reform leadership.  The

 15 January election of the flamboyant reformer Lei Yu--purged in 1985 for his lax
 handling of the Hainan auto resale scandal2 --as Guangzhou Vice Mayor will doubtless
 upset conservatives such as Chen Yun, who pointed to Lei's case as an~ example of the
 corruption they argue is inherent in China's "open door" policies.
 Regarding the impact of the reform package in Guangdong itself, we believe
 Zhao's local hothouse strategy will be successful.  For example, the newly enlarged Pearl
 River Economic Zone--spurred by Hong Kong subcontracting orders and recently
 expanded foreign exchange retention rights--will accelerate Guangdong's "opening to
 the outside."  Also, despite recent public complaints about inflation in Guangdong, we
 expect local authorities to implement further reforms of wages and food prices this year.
 Finally, Guangdong has made some progress--which we expect will continue--in closing
 party offices that interfere in government economic work.
 Assessing the Broader Impact
 Guangdong's advantages ~ as a reform proving ground are so unique that we
 believe many of its new policies can be transplanted to only a few other economically
 advanced coastal areas in the near to midterm.  Wage reform, specifically the
 introduction of piece-rate wages; and reforms in the foreign investment system
 designed to cut red tape and improve foreign access to market information are likely to
 be easiest to implement.  The "foreign trade responsibility system"--designed to make
 exporting firms live within their own budgets--will require politically difficult subsidy
 cuts for many powerful firms.
 Implementing price reforms elsewhere, particularly in the interior provinces, will
 be extremely difficult, as reform leaders readily acknowledge.  The fear of inflation and
 shortages that prompted Hunan and Jiangxi to impose embargoes on the sale of .goods
 to Guangdong--rather than allowing the prices of these goods to rise and become more
 competitive--illustrates one of the problems reformers face in trying to decontrol prices.
 Even if the export strategy is modestly successful, it is by no means clear how
 Zhao envisions Guangdong and the other coastal areas serving as "engines of growth"
 for China's poorer interior.  If Zhao hopes coastal development will spark increased
 interregional trade, he will have to find more effective ways of breaking down internal
 trade barriers than Beijing has to date.  As the "war of live pigs" illustrates, the
 leadership of the interior provinces will often forgo the potential benefits of increased

 trade to protect themselves against price fluctuations and shortages of essential goods.
 Mao's policy of local self-sufficiency taught these officials an array of tricks to control
 trade in their bailiwicks, including the use of business permits, PXn~rt fees, and outright
 embargoes.                                          25X1
 At present, Beijing has few levers to force greater provincial cooperation, as its
 inability to control provincial capital construction investment demonstrates.
 Nevertheless, Beijing is promoting some measures that should encourage greater
 cooperation without seriously threatening local leaders' ability to limit disruptions
 caused by greater trade.  According to recent statements by a Chinese official, these
 include:
 ?  Encouraging economic agreements between provinces to promote interregional
 economic zones and integrated markets.  Thus far these agreements have only
 been partially successful in breaking down local protectionism, but they could lay
 the groundwork for greater integration.
 ?   Creating cross-regional and cross-industrial conglomerates, free of local
 government control, to handle trade in raw materials and other goods.
 Zhao must be careful to keep the gap between                 25X1
 the coast and interior from widening too far, to avoid increasing political and economic
 friction between these two disparate regions.. Zhao probably hopes his export strategy
 will expand coastal revenues, which he can then use to increase development subsidies
 for the interior.  In the meantime he has sought to reassure interior leaders that their
 provinces will not be "milked" to supply the coastal provinces with scarce raw materials
 and development funds for his export strategy.                                                     25X1

 Appendix A
 Guangdong officials have announced new reform initiatives, while others await
 final approval by the State Council.  We believe the final package will include:
 ?  A wage deregulation plan which, according to State reporting, will allow
 enterprises to set their own rates for employees.
 ?   Allowing Guangdong to keep a much larger share of the foreign exchange that
 provincial enterprises earn from exports-- 30 percent of the exchange made on
 sales of state plan products, and 80 percent on sales of non -state plan
 products.
 ?   Decontrolling grain and edible oil prices this year, and partially decontrolling
 sugar and sugarcane.  In December, Governor Ye told reporters Guangdong may
 also deregulate timber prices in 1988.
 ?   Extending the special reform policies of the Pearl River Economic Zone to an
 additional 29 cities and counties.  These polices--designed to attract foreign
 investors--include tax and tariff breaks for export manufacturers, as well as local
 government autonomy to approve joint ventures.
 ?   Raising the limit on foreign investment projects Guangdong may authorize from
 $30 million to $100 million, according to the PRC-controlled Hong Kong
 newspapers.  The limit had been raised from $10 million in 1987.  Very few
 potential investment projects are likely to exceed the new limit.
 ?   Authorizing Guangzhou and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone to experiment
 with land ownership and sales reforms.  In November, Shenzhen held China's first
 land auction since the early 1950s.
 ?   Allowing Guangdong export firms to deal directly with foreign firms instead of
 trading through government import-export companies.  In return, state subsidies
 to these export firms wilt be cut.
 ?   Abolishing government departmental party committees to lessen party
 interference in government affairs,. according to Hong Kong press sources. 25X1

 Appendix B
 Unique Guangdong in Perspective
 particularly dynamic in the Pearl River Delta region.
 Although, Guangdong accounts for only. 6 percent of China's population (ranked
 4th), the province is one of China's most dynamic economically- (see graphic).
 Guangdong is China's number-one exporter, leading number-two -ranked Shanghai by
 -about 30 percent.  Guangdong's share of foreign business in China--measured either as
 direct foreign investment paid in, or in numbers of firms--far exceeds that of all-other
 provinces combined (figure 1).  Like China's other fastest growing industrial
 provinces--such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu--Guangdong has emphasized smaller
 collectively owned and individually owned enterprises over large, state-owned industries
 (figure 2).  The performance of these smaller firms, which often subcontract            25X1
 labor-intensive manufacturing for Hong Kong and other foreign firms, has been
 over the last five years, industrial growth rates in this area have roughly    25X1
 doubled the already high national average (figure 3).
