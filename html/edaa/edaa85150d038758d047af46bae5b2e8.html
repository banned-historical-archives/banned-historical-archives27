 THE COMMUNIST ADVANCE TOWARDS POWER IN LAOS
 Techniques and Methods Used by the Pathet Lao to Achieve
 a Favorable Agreement with the Royal Laotian Government
 Summary
 to     The French return to Laos .after the defeat of Japan in World War II
 was opposed by an indigenous nationalist movement.  This group, which
 called themselves the Lao Issara, went into exile in. Bangkok after the
 reestablishment of French rule in Laos.       They included present leaders
 of both the Royal Laotian Government (RLG) and the Pathet Lao (PL) or
 Lao-Viet.  When the French, in 1949, decided to grant independence to
 Laos and set up the Royal Government, a majority of the Lao Issara decided
 to accept this offer and returned to Laos.  A minority group which had
 earlier been expelled from the Lao Issara because of its contacts with
 the Vietminh, rejected the offer as inadequate, and were promptly offered
 the support of the Communist Vietminh of North Vietnam, who found them
 a most useful instrument.
 2.     Under Vietminh direction, these Laotian dissidents were organized
 into the.Pathet Lao, a resistance movement against the RLG.  Vietminh
 propaganda made much of the existence of this movement and the paper
 governmental structure set up in its name.  During the later stages of the
 war between the Vietminh and the French in Vietnam, the Vietminh,
 ostensibly as "volunteers" with the Pathet Lao, extended their operations
 into Laos.  As a result, when fighting ended after the fall of Dienbienphu,
 the Pathet Lao/Vietminh held most of two northern provinces, Sam Neua
 and Ph.ong Saly which bordered on Vietnam,
 3.    At the Geneva Conference of 1954, the Communist negotiations suc-
 ceeded in securing for the Pathet Lao a sort of quasi-recognition when those
 two provinces. were designated as regrouping areas for the Pathet Lao forces,
 This provision was qualified by a statement that the sovereignty of the RLG
 in the provinces was to be recognized, a qualification which was promptly
 ignored by the Pathet Lao who proceeded to treat the provinces as their own
 territory.  The Conference also provided that elections should be held in
 Laos and a political and military settlement negotiated between the Pathet Lao
 and the RLG.  For this purpose, from early 1955, Pathet Lao delegates met

 NOW
 with RLG representatives to seek agreement on the basic issues.  One of
 these concerned the foreign policy of Laos.  The RLG was accepting military
 and economic aid from France and the U. S. , although not permitted by the
 Geneva. Agreements to join SEATO or make any formal alliances.   The
 Pathet Lao, in accordance with Communist policy, regarded this as
 unneutral and as evidence that RLG independence was only nominal Other
 issues involved the status of Pathet Lao adherents after settlement and
 guarantees, of their rights and liberties, the status of Pathet Lao military
 forces, and the question of the restoration of RLG .authority in the two
 provinces.
 4.     It soon appeared that there were irreconcilable differences.  In spite
 of the directive of the Geneva Conference, the Pathet Lao refused to recognize
 RLG rights in the provinces and would give no assurances as to their future
 attitude in this respect.  In this they were supported by Vietminh radio
 propaganda.  The RLG made this restoration a condition for negotiations
 on the other issues,  In consequence, negotiations dragged along without
 appreciable progress.     The Laotian Prime Minister, Katay Sasorith, after
 apparently at first regarding the Pathet Lao as "misguided borthers" and
 genuinely expecting that their ties with the Vietminh could be severed and
 .that they could be brought back into the national fold, became disillusioned
 and abandoned for the time the attempt at settlement,  The elections, which
 had been postponed from mid-1955 in hopes of agreement, were held in
 December with the Pathet Lao refusing to participate.
 5.     Neither the Pathet Lao nor the RLG desired the indefinite continuance
 of this stalemate.  A change in the RLG in March 1956, by which Prince
 Souvanna Phouma replaced Katay as Prime Minister, was. in part caused
 by pressure in the RLG for a quick settlement of the Pathet Lao problem.  It
 also offered the Pathet Lao an opportunity, which they quickly seized, to
 seek reopening of negotiations without loss of face by making a distinction
 between the old and new governments,  From late 1955 also, the new Com-
 munist line stressing legality, abandonment of armed struggle, and con-
 centrating on overt political action was making itself felt.  For the Pathet
 Lao this created greater pressure for ending their insurrection and securing
 a legal status for their party, while the RLG leaders could now point to the
 new Communist attitudes and hope that negotiations might be more successful
 in the new atmosphere than they had been in the old.
 6?     Outside Communist diplomatic assistance was furnished to the Pathet
 Lao when Communist journalist Wilfred Burchett paid a visit to Vientiane
 and secured a written interview with Souvanna Phouma.  It appears plain

 Approved F  Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R500200002-2
 that his mission was to find out what sort of reception would be given
 proposals from the Pathet Lao for reopening of negotiations and what
 sort of terms the RLG might be willing to consider.  This device avoided
 the risk of an embarrassing snub and loss of face by the Pathet Lao.
 7.     Souvanna Phouma's replies were apparently satisfactory.  Peiping
 and Hanoi radio propaganda urged negotiations.  Pathet Lao leaders approached
 the RLG and in August 1956, new talks were begun.    Out of them, in the
 form of two joint communiques, came agreements in principle which largely
 followed the line of the Pathet Lao proposals.  The Pathet Lao received
 guarantees that they would enjoy full rights as citizens, including the right
 to organize a political party and contest elections, assurances that Laotian
 policy would follow a neutral line, and somewhat ambiguous provisions for
 supplementary elections and the formation of a coalition government.  The
 Pathet Lao agreed to integrate its military and administrative personnel
 into the government and to order a cease-fire.  The extent of the RLG defeat
 in these agreements may be measured by the fact that in return for these
 concessions to the Pathet Lao, they got no assurances, in fact not even a
 mention, of the question of restoration of government authority in the two
 northern provinces.  Mixed military and political commissions were to
 work out the details and presumably the question of the provinces was to
 come up there.
 8.     While negotiations were going on, Peiping, through the Indian chair-
 man of the ICC in Vientiane, invited Souvanna Phouma to pay a visit to
 China.  He held that he could not go until the Pathet Lao issue was settled.
 However, he accepted the above agreements as meeting his condition, and
 with a RLG delegation made the trip in late August, stopping in Hanoi on
 the way home for talks with the DRV.  The Prime Minister insited on his
 return that he had made no commitments to either the (Chinese or the Vietminh
 concerning diplomatic relations, economic aid and missions and so on, but
 Communist radio propaganda exploited the trip and the Prime Minister's
 friendly expressions in his speeches to create a general impression that the
 RLG had gone a long way toward alignment with the Communist bloc,
 9.     The Communists had shown a good deal of skill and careful planning
 in the way in which they had maneuvered the RLG into these agreements.  The
 political influence and latent military threat of the DRV and even of the CPR
 had been utilized.   The International Control Commission (ICC) with its
 Polish member and its in dian chairman had been used to urge the RLG into

 concessions to the Pathet Lao.  The international machinery had been
 invoked to extricate the Pathet Lao from the stalemate in the negotiations.
 Internal opposition to the RLG, from possibly Communist-manipulated
 elements, from sincere seekers for peace and reunification and from
 opportunistic politicians had been mobilized to support the Pathet Lao aims.
 The result was an agreement which gave the Communist side most of what
 they wanted and from which, no doubt, they expect to go on to'their final
 goal, the Communization of Laos.

 THE COMMUNIST ADVANCE TOWARDS POWER IN LAOS
 Techniques and Methods Used by the Pathet Lao to Achieve
 a Favorable Agreement with the Royal Laotian Government
 1.   Review of the Pathet Lao Movement and the Problem
 The Pathet Lao Born. Out of Laotian Apposition to French Rule
 1.   Prior to World War II, Laos was a part of the French protectorate
 in Indochina.  As in other parts of the colonial world, a small indigenous
 nationalist movement had developed even before the war.  The defeat of
 France in Europe left her unable to protect her Asiatic possessions and
 Laos, with the rest of Indochina, fell before Japanese aggression.  The
 defeat of Japan in 1945 and the withdrawal of Japanese forces from Laos.
 brought the prospect of a restoration of French rule. Laotian nationalists
 prepared to resist this restoration.  They organized a resistance move-
 ment and government under the title Lao Issas or Free Lao.
 For a time the Lao Issara were able to maintain themselves as
 the government of the country.    However, before long, increasing French
 military strength drove the Lao Issara government from power.  Part
 of the nationalist group led in 1946 into exile in Bangkok, while other
 elements remained in Laos to carry on active resistance against the
 French sponsored (and controlled) Laotian government.
 Z.     The group in Bangkok carried on as a government in exile and
 exercised direction over the anti-French resistance within Laos. The
 membership of the exiled Lao Issara included Prince Souvanna Phouma,
 the present Prime Minister of Laos, his half-brother, Prince Soup-
 hanouvong, now one of the chief leaders of the Pathet Lao, and other
 members of both the Royal Laotian Government and the Path.et Lao.
 Also a member was Prince Petsarath who has in recent years been
 trying to function from Bangkok as a sort of Deus ex machina in
 Laotian politics.
 By 1949 the French had come to recognize the necessity of conceding
 a large measure of independence to the states of Indochina and conceived
 the idea of the Associated States of Indochina within the French Union.  In
 July, 1949, Laos was recognized as one of these Associated States.

 3. The Lao Issara did not present an entirely united front to these
 developments.  One  split in the movement had already occurred.  Some
 months prior to the French. proposals, a minority faction of the Lao Issara
 led by Prince Souphanouvong, had been expelled from the movement as
 a consequence of their contacts and associations with the Communist
 Vietminh of North Vietnam,  (Lao Issara resistance forces in Laos had
 engaged in hostilities with the Vietminh along the northern border.)
 Souphanouvong's Communist associations apparently dated back at least
 a year or two prior to 1949,
 Most of the remainder of the Lao Issara found the French proposals
 acceptable and returned to Laos to participate in politics and eventually
 to rise to the top positions in the new government.  Prince Petsarath
 however, chose to reject the policy of cooperation with the French and
 remained in exile in Bangkok,                                           +
 The Exploitation of the
 Pathet Lao by the Vietminh
 4.     Following their expulsion, Souphanouvong and his followers went to
 North Vietnam, where they were promptly taken in hand by, the Communist
 Vietminh.  Under Communist direction and guidance they organized a new
 anti-French, anti-Royal Laotian Government resistance movement under
 the title of Pathet Lao,    Until 1953, the Pathet Lao remained in Vietnam
 undergoing thorough training and indoctrination.  Whatever the Communist
 sympathies or convictions of the Pathet Lao leaders before 1949, it would
 ,scarcely be credible that they could emerge from such a training period
 anything other than reliable Communists.  Equally certain, so far as such
 things can be proved, is the fact that their "nationalist" movement is the
 creature of the Vietminh Communists.
 5.     It is scarcely necessary for the purposes of this study to recount
 in any detail the successive stages in the exploitation of the Pathet Lao by
 the Vietminh.  From time to time the Vietminh radio announced the forma-
 tion of a Laotian Resistance League, or a Coalition Resistance Government,
 or some other largely "paper" organization, referring to Souphanouvong
 variously as "Premier", "Chairman", etc.  For instance, in September 1950,
 The RLG has on some occasions labelled the Pathet Lao as the "Lao-Viet"
 to point up its connection with the Vietminh.  However, since the name
 Pathet Lao is more commonly used, it has been employed throughout
 this paper for the sake of clarity and consistency.

 the Vietminh radio announced the formation of a Lao Resistance League
 and referred to a National Assembly of the Pathet Lao.  Along with this
 was mentioned a Neo-Lao Issara Front with an Executive Committee and
 a Coalition Resistance Government.  Souphanouvong was described as the
 Premier of the Government and the Chairman of the Front.  In. March 1951,
 at a conference of the Laotian National Front, held in Vietminh territory,
 the Laotian movement was integrated into a Vietminh coalition called
 the Lien-Viet Front, "under the leadership of the Lao Dong Party"; thus
 making the Vietminh direction of the Laotians crystal clear.  The Pathet
 Lao were now described as the Laotian branch of the Vietnam, Cambodia,
 Laos Alliance Bloc.  Pathet Lao leaders, of course, insisted that this.
 association was voluntary on their part and that they were, in fact,
 independent.  The Vietminh also reiterated the view that the Pathet Lao
 were an indigenous nationalist movement by simultaneously publicizing
 the united front of Vietminh, Pathet Lao and "Khmer"  (Cambodians).
 In due time, the Vietminh said, these would be united to forma single
 Communist Party.
 It is obvious that the Vietminh were endeavoring to create an
 impression of an independent, nationalist, indigenous Laotian movement,
 which nevertheless, they took care to keep under firm control, and at
 the same time to set up the facade of a Laotian resistance government
 which could, at the appropriate time, receive the recognition and
 assistance of the Communist bloc.  Little support for these efforts at
 actual resistance activity appeared, however, in Laos, itself.
 Communist Exploitation of the Pathet Lao Takes a Military Form
 6.     In 1953, with the intensification of the war against the French, the
 Vietminh forces extended their operations to Laotian soil.  Under the
 color of an indigenous Laotian resistance force, strong Vietminh forces,
 accompanied by their handful of expatriate Pathet Lao, made several
 incursions into Laos.  The Pathet Laos, now on native soil, succeeded
 in recruiting some forces, although it is difficult to say first, which
 portion of these recruits were Laotian-speaking Vietnamese domiciled
 in Laos, which portion were voluntary recruits or which were impressed
 forcibly.  The military forces. of the new Laotian government were unable
 to control these incursions which at one point brought the Vietminh-Pathet
 Lao forces to within a few miles of Luang Prabang, the royal capital.
 The invading forces also captured and occupied for a time the town of
 Thakhek just across the Mekong River from Thailand.  In addition to the
 operations of the Vietminh forces themselves, guerrilla forces of Pathet

 Lao accompanied by Vietminh cadres as "advisers" began activity
 throughout Laos.  Prince Souphanouvong announced himself as the
 President of the Laotian Resistance Government which he described
 as the only legal government in Laos and in that capacity welcomed
 the Vietminh "volunteers" to Laotian soil,  The Royal Laotian Govern-
 ment (RLG) protested unavailingly to the U. N. against this violation
 of its territory.
 7.     This move on the part of the Vietminh was, of course, part of their
 overall military strategy in their war with the French.  It would be a
 diversion from the main front in Vietnam and if Laos could be overrun
 or brought to the Communist side by the establishment of a Pathet Lao
 government, one flank of the Franco-South Vietnam forces would be
 exposed.  Further, when a territorial settlement came to be made, Laos
 would be part of the area in Communist hands.  In this respect, the
 campaign fell short of complete success.  Laos was neither overrun nor
 subverted and the fgb.ting in Vietnam ended before the Vietminh-Pathet
 Lao forces could pose a threat to the main Franco-Vietnamese armies.
 But the Communist motives undoubtedly went deeper,than the above
 and they gained considerable advantage from these moves.  For one thing,
 they tested their puppet Laotian forces.  They had already created, as we
 have seen, the facade of an indigenous, anti-Western, Laotian resistance
 government, securely under their control..  Now they were in a position
 from which, were they to achieve anything less than a. complete Communist
 military victory and takeover in Indochina, they could provide their
 creature with a secure territorial base in the two northern provinces of
 Phong Saly and Sam Neua and with the nucleus, at least, of an underground
 organization for subversion and resistance in the rest .of Laos.  From this
 point of view, their campaign must be judged successful
 Effect of French Defeat at Dienbienphu
 8.     The military stage of the struggle for Indochina ended after the
 French defeat at Dienbienphu.  The French were weary of the profitless
 struggle.  The Communists., on their side, were perhaps apprehensive
 that if they continued the military push for complete victory, they might
 bring down the massive Western or American intervention which some
 had believed imminent before the fall of Dienbienphu and which would
 have made Indochina into another Korea.  The result was the Geneva
 Conference of 1954 and the Geneva Agreements,

 Geneva Gives the Pathet Lao Quasi-Recognition
 9.     The Vietminh government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
 (DRV) was, of course, present at the Geneva Conference even though it
 had not received recognition from any Western Power.  The DRV sought
 also to secure official representation. for the Pathet Lao, but in spite of
 the support of both Moscow and Peiping for this position, the Conference
 refused to go so far and denied recognition to Souphanouvong's "govern-
 ment".  The clauses of the agreement which applied to Laos and the
 Pathet Lao, however, took a considerable, if implicit, step in that
 direction?  Ignoring the fact that the Pathet Lao were in rebellion against
 a legitimate government and that they owed what position they had in Laos
 to a foreign military intervention, the Conference took the view that the
 Pathet Lao and its military forces had a standing which was subject to
 negotiation and instructed the RLG to negotiate this position with them,
 at the same time extending certain guarantees to the Pathet Lao.
 10.    The agreement in effect accorded a certain legitimacy to the
 Pah?t Lao military forces by giving them as "regrouping areas" the two
 northern provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua (adjacent to the DRV)The Communist negotiators, including Molotov and Chou En-lai, appre -
 ciated the value of a territorial sanctuary in which the scattered Pathet
 Lao forces could be assembled, secure from RLG attack after the with-
 drawal of the Vietminh. units.  (It could correspond to Mao Tse-tung's
 territorial base from which he expanded power.)  However, the Conference
 insisted this did not constitute a grant of territorial status to the Pathet
 Lao, since the sovereignty of the RLG in these provinces was specifically
 recognized.
 The agreement directed a ceasef ire between the forces of the Pathet
 Lao and the RLG.  But it was not left at that.  Negotiations were then to
 be carried on between the two looking to the settlement of the issues be-
 tween them and the reunification of the country with general elections
 to be held before the end of 1955.
 Specific issues between the Pah.et Lao and the RLG other than the
 connections of the former with the Communists, had developed since 1949.
 Domestically, the question was one of the terms on which the guerrilla
 war could be ended, the authority of the RLG restored throughout the
 country, and the Pathet Lao brought back into the community and their
 people integrated into the military and political structure of the country.
 The issue of Laotian foreign policy had also developed since the original
 RLG/Pathet Lao split.  The RLG insisted that its foreign policy was a

 neutral one--that it belonged to neither bloc.  But to the Pathet Lao, and
 in Communist terms, the continued presence of French, and American
 advisers, the dependence upon French and American economic and
 military aid, the French military base at Seno, even though authorized
 by the Geneva agreement, RLG acquiescence in SEATO protection, even
 while rejecting membership, the absence of diplomatic relations with
 Communist countries constituted violations of neutrality and evidence
 of the illusory nature of Laotian "independence",  It was to be expected
 that Pathet Lao negotiators would insist upon. revision of these policies.
 11.    The Pathet Lao were quick to provide their own interpretation on
 the Geneva agreement.  The agreement had designated the northern
 provinces as "regrouping areas" for the Pathet Lao, but specified that
 RLG sovereignty continued there.  The RLG therefore prepared to re-
 establish its administration in this area.  The Pathet Lao, however,
 aware of the value of a territorial base, . interpreted the agreement as
 giving them the right to. rule and administer the two provinces pending a
 settlement and treated the government attempt to restore its authority
 as a violation of the Geneva Agreement. Coordination of this stand was
 evident as the Hanoi, radio announced on March 5, 1955, that "All
 encroachments upon the territory of the two provinces, of Phong Saly and
 Sam Neua are at utter variance with the Geneva Armistice Agreement
 in. its letter and spirit.  The Pathet Lao forces are determined to oppose
 these acts of violation." It was plain that the Pathet Lao had no intention
 of giving up its "secure base" except on terms satisfactory to itself,
 Pathet Lao/RLG Negotiations Prove to be Desultory and Inconclusive
 12,    Under the circumstances it is not surprising that for some time the
 negotiations begun. in January, 1955 for the political settlement enjoined
 by the Geneva Conference made little progress.  A Pathet Lao delegation
 established itself in Vientiane and conferred from time to time with RLG
 officials.  This mission took advantage of its privileged status in Vien-
 tiane as had the Chinese Communist group led by Chou En-lai in Nationalist
 Chung-king in World War II, to make contacts, win friends and spread
 propaganda.  The Pathet Lao were determined to hold on to the secure
 territorial base in the two northern provinces and would agree to no
 arrangement which would endanger their control there.  On the other hand,
 for the RLG the essence of any agreement was naturally (1) the genuine
 unification of the country under its authority and.(2) the end of the guer-
 rilla. war.                            These aims being irreconcilable, the elections planned for
 the middle of 1955 could not be held.  A top-level meeting between the

 RLG Prime Minister Katay Sasorith and Prince Souphanouvong in
 October on the neutral soil of Rangoon made no better progress towards
 agreement.  Sporadic outbursts of guerrilla fighting still occurred in
 spite of the ceasefire order.
 13. In order to cloud the issues and to work against any possible hard-
 ening of the attitude of the Royal Government, the Vietnamese Communists
 were able to take advantage of several types of emotional ties between
 the leaders of the Royal Government and the Pathet Lao leaders.  Not
 only is the Pathet Lao leader Prince Souphanouvong a half brother of
 the present RLG. Prime Minister but the Pathet Lao, like Communists
 everywhere, have taken full advantage of the common ties of nationalism
 created by their common participation with the RLG leaders in the
 patriotic resistance against the French.
 The effect was to cause many Royal Government leaders to doubt
 the clear evidence that the insurgents had become converts to Com -
 munism and were directed from Hanoi.  This resulted in a mistaken
 feeling that the dissidents could not have placed loyalty to the Communist
 movement above national loyalties--the Pathet Lao were regarded as
 "misguided brothers", and apparently Prime Minister Katay felt the
 dissidents would prove amenable to persuasion if the intervention of
 the Vietnamese Communists in Laotian affairs could be ended,
 The Chinese and Vietnamese Communists were quick to arrange
 the assurances needed,  Taking advantage of the conciliatory atmos-
 phere and the emotional effects of the policy of Asian unity engendered
 by the Bandung Conference of April, 1955, the Chinese, aided by the
 Indians, persuaded Katay to issue a joint statement with the DRV Foreign
 Minister, Pham Van Dong,  (The joint action was in itself a diplomatic
 gain for Hanoi.)  In this statement, Pham Van Dong blandly pledged
 "good neighborly relations" between his government and the Royal
 Government and with complete cynicism undertook that the DRV would
 regard the settlement between the Royal Government and the Pathet
 Lao as a purely domestic concern of Laos.  In spite of these words,
 however, DRV support and direction of Prince Souphanouvong and the
 Pathet Lao continued,
 14.    Although, in accordance with the Geneva Agreements, the Viet-
 minh troops had been withdrawn from Laos, numbers of both political
 and military advisers had remained.  Strong Vietminh forces remained
 just over the border, in a position to intervene again, should the DRV
 so order, in the event that the RLG undertook strong military measures
 against the Pathet Lao.

 The DRV continued to insist that its policy towards Laos was
 in all respects "correct", but also continued active military and propa-
 ganda support of the Pathet Lao.  The Pathet Lao was described as the
 rightful government of Laos which had "liberated" the country from the
 imperialists; the U. S. was accused of aggressive aims and blamed for
 all the troubles in. Laos,  The RLG was charged with being the tool of
 the western imperialists.   This. propaganda was softened somewhat
 during the October, 1955 meeting between Katay and Souphanouvong,
 but stepped up again after its failure,
 The Chinese Communists made clear their support of the Pathet
 Lao as. propaganda from Peiping followed the same line as Hanoi, al-
 though somewhat more restrained.   They emphasized the danger for
 Asian and world peace from the situation in Laos, placin  the he blame
 upon the United States   The Kwangming Daily of Peking on December 24,
 1955, stated that "the CPR will never allow the US S. imperialist schemes
 to succeed. ""   Such hints of the possibility of Chinese intervention were
 no doubt calculated to increase the pressure upon the RLG for concessions
 to the Pathet Lao.  The Soviet Union maintained a "correct" attitude
 and in its few comments on the Laotian situation emphasized only the
 importance of settling the issue by peaceful means.
 Communist Efforts Receive Setback as Katay, Disillusioned, Suspends
 Attempts to Reach a Settlement
 15.    In spite of the intransigence of the Pathet Lao leaders, spasmodic
 efforts at negotiations continued and proposals and counterproposals
 bounced back and forth,  The Pathet Lao continued to insist stubbornly
 upon retaining control of their base in the two northern provinces.  An
 RLG proposal, for instance that a temporary solution be adopted by
 which each party would appoint the governor in one province and the
 deputy governor in the other brought forth only a Pathet Lao demand for
 a "Joint Political Council"  charged with guaranteeing democratic
 liberties throughout Lao and having the powers to intervene in any
 question involving Pathet Lao partisans, to revise the electoral laws
 and to gtarantee the formation of a true "national government" after the
 elections,.  All this was to come before any consideration could be given
 to the question of control of the two provinces.  Hanoi and Peiping prcpagand.a con-
 tinued to support this intransigent attitude and sporadic guerrilla warfare
 continued.
 The People's Daily warned in July, 1955 that the war in Indochina
 might be rekindled unless the "direct aggression by the SEATO
 countries against Laos." were thwarted.

 16. The attitude of the International Control Commission,` established
 under the Geneva agreements, was of use to the Pathet Lao, as it failed
 to act decisively to resolve this impasse.  The RLG was irritated by
 the tendency of the ICC, and especially of the chairman, to treat the
 RLG and the Pathet Lao as having comparable status and even "bending
 over backwardsr" to be "fair to the Pathet Lao.   The Commission made
 no effective effort prior to January, 1956 to enforce the Geneva  agree-
 ment that RLG authority should be restored in the two provinces, while
 urging the RLG to make concessions on political issues to the Pathet Lao.
 17.    The Communists had two additional. advantages which weakened
 the hand of the Royal Government.  The emphasis in the current inter-
 national Communist line on the peaceful solution of differences created
 a climate of world opinion which acted to deter the Royal Government
 from a resort to arms to settle the dispute.  The continued presence of
 Vietminh advisers with the Pathet Lao and the maintenance of strong
 DRV military forces just over the border also made it plain that the
 DRV would not acquiesce in the destruction of the Pathet Lao by military
 force and that such an. attempt would in all likelihood result in a new
 Vietminh intervention.  The memory of the pre-Dienbienphu invasion
 of Laos no doubt helped to impress this upon the minds of the RLG leaders.
 18.    Prime Minister Katay, in spite of lingering sympathies for the
 "misguided brothers" of the Pathet Lao and his reluctance to perpetuate
 the division of Laos, was becoming increasingly disillusioned with the
 Pathet Lao and aware of their determination to hang on to their base
 and their intention of eventually taking over control of the country.  In
 December, 1955, eighteen long months after Geneva, he declared the
 negotiations to be futile and abandoned for the time the attempt to
 reach a settlement.  Elections were held throughout the country except
 in areas under Pathet Lao control, without the participation of the Pathet
 Lao.  Katay stated that he regarded these elections as the "constitutional
 settlement"" enjoined by the Geneva Conference and that therefore the ICC
 would have little more to do in Laos.  Pathet Lao leader Prince Souphanouvong
 denounced the elections in a letter to Eden and Molotov, the co-chairman
 of the Geneva Conference.
 The International Control Commission, established by the Geneva Con-
 ference to oversee the implementation in Laos of the Geneva Agreements,
 was composed, as has been typical of such international agencies, of one
 member from each side, in this case a Canadian and a Pole, and a
 "neutral" to serve as a balance between them.  Since this last post was,
 in this case, held by an Indian whose view of the issues involved often
 paralleled that of the Pathet Lao, the majority in the ICC frequently
 seemed to favor the Communist side.

 19. With the elections over, the RLG without reopening talks with the
 Pathet Lao, man.i.fested its continuing interest in unification in a letter
 to the ICC, dated January 7, 1956,  It proposed that the Pathet Lao
 surrender their arms under ICC supervision by March, 15, with Pathet
 Lao personnel then being integrated into the Laotian community,  An
 ICC resolution of the same date (,with the Polish delegate abstaining)
 called for a prompt restoration of RLG control in the northern provinces,
 but no effort was made to compel. the Pathet Lao to comply.
 It also became apparent early in. 1956 that the Communists hoped
 to tie the Pathet Lao question together with the problem of a settlement
 in Vietnam.  It was suggested from their side that the Pathet Lao question
 should be taken up by an international conference together with the question
 of elections in Vietnam with the implication that concessions might be had
 on the Pathet Lao question if the United States, particularly,  would agree
 to early elections in Vietnam.
 II,    The Renewal. of Negotiations and the Agreement
 The Impassee Proves Uncomfortable for Both Sides
 20,    Neither the Pathet Lao nor their Vietminh masters were entirely
 happy with this stalemate.   The Pathet Lao still held control of their
 northern base, but without further Vietminh. aid their prospects of
 extending their control. over the rest of Laos appeared remote.  The
 RLG guerrilla campaign against them was a continual threat and it
 was not inconceivable that the ANL might mount a full-scale offensive
 against them which, without major Vietnamese Communist aid, they
 were probably not capable of repu.l.si.ng?  A prolonged stalemate might
 also be very damaging to the Pathet Lao cause in the political field.  If
 the RLG were in the meantime to stabilize the situation in the other ten
 provinces, to solve some of its economic problems and to cement its
 close ties with Western. powers, the Pathet Lao hopes of winning mass
 support in the rest of Laos would fade almost into nonexistence.    There
 were strong indications in the early part of 1.956 that Pathet Lao morale
 was declining.

 The Vietnamese Communists, on their part, were well aware of the
 weaknesses of the Pathet Lao position.  They knew that R.LC successes
 against the Pathet Lao, either of a military or a political nature would
 pose a dilemma for themselves.  If they did not intervene to save the Pathet Lao they might see a principal base for future subversion or con-
 quest of the rest of Indochina go down the drain, their investment in the
 Pathet Lao movement lost, and Laos, whether reunified or composed only of
 the ten non.-Pathet Lao provinces, more and more fi.rml.y committed to the
 West,  If the): did intervene, the Pathet Lao movement would be exposed to
 the world as a. DRV creature, a fact which the DRV had assiduously sought
 to conceal.  Intervention would constitute an undeniable violation, of the
 armistice, antagonize neutral, opinion and perhaps turn even India and
 the 1CC to a. more unfavorable attitude.  Communist claims to fulfillment
 of armistice terms for elections in Vietnam would become even more
 untenable.   A negotiated settlement which would avert the necess.i.ty of
 facing this dilemma was much to be preferred.
 2,.1.      The RLG on its side had reason. to be unhappy with the continuance
 of a stalemate.  No government can view the division of its country with
 complete equanimity.  Should the stalemate continue indefinitely, the
 RL:G feared,   .e division of Laos into North and South, might come to.
 be generally accepted as semi permanent on the model of Korea and
 Vietnam.            mu n.stt s i e`coiald count on. this desire  or uni icati.on

 The Path.et Lao establishment in the northern provinces would
 continue to be a base for subversion. and possible renewed attack.  It
 could always . serve as a pretext for a new Vietnamese Communist i:nterm
 vention against which. the RLG.. military resources -would be inadequate.
 Western military support in that event :might make Laos the battleground
 of another war.  These dangers would at least be minimized if the separate
 Pathet Lao to  itori.al status and military force could be eliminated in
 an agreement.
 22.      The Communists also made use of internal, forces in the RLG to
 exert pressure. for further negotiations.  They were aware of and en-
 couraged the lingering regret on the part of some R.LG leaders. over the
 chain of events which had set Laotian against Laotian and capitalized on
 the reluctance of certain RLG leaders to believe that old comrades in
 the Pathet Lao movement were really Communists.  The sentiment
 among the people for an end to civil, war and guerrilla fighting which
 was concerned more with getting an agreement of some kind than with.
 the terms and implications of such an agreement made them vulnerable

 Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000500200002-2
 to Communist propaganda.  The RLG could not but be responsive in
 some degree to this feeling among the people.  The excessive expendi-
 tures upon the army which the guerrilla war entailed crippled the budget
 and handicapped the RLG economic program       Complex factional power
 rivalries within the government also played a part, and Communists are
 old hands at exploiting such, rivalries.  There was always a temptation
 for the group or individual out of office to attack the one in office for
 being either too hard or too soft toward the Pathet Lao.  For example,
 Katay had to consider how his hardening attitude could provide fuel for
 charges by ambitious opposition politicians that he was standing in the
 way of a much-wanted. settlement,
 Although, up to early 1956 neither party had been willing to make
 real, concessions on any vital points and the above described stalemate
 had developed, it is apparent that both sides had valid reasons for new
 attempts to find a basis for agreement,
 The New Line of International Communism As It Applies to the Pathet
 23,    The attitude of the Pathet Lao had been perfectly in accordance with
 the international Communist line for dissident Communist groups.  Their
 insistence upon retention of the secure base in the northern provinces,
 adjacent to a, friendly Communist country, is according to doctrine, par-
 ticularly the Maoist version,  The creation of a Communist "government",
 maintaining its own military forces, claiming to be the "true" national
 government: and able to give, through its invitation, a certain legitimacy
 to an invasion. of Communist "volunteers" are part of the familiar pattern
 far wresting State power from a non-Communist government.  The Pathet
 Lao refused to recognize that independence secured by a gradual coopera-
 tion with the former colonial power was real independence; they denounced
 all ties or cooperation with, the West as unneutral; characterized the
 regime as an imperialist tool.; and insisted upon joining the "socialist
 camp".  These stands all identified the Pathet Lao movement as a follower
 of the old international, Line.
 "Thus, just as the Chinese people have done, all or at least some of
 the colonial peoples in the East can hold for an extended period big
 or small. base areas and revolutionary regimes, carry on aprotracted,
 revolutionary war to encircle the cities from the countryside, and
 proceed gradually to take over the cities and win nation-wide victory
 in their respective countries." Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung,

 The new line, becoming apparent after Stalin?s death and after
 the 20th Congress of the C:PSU entailed some changes in the Pathet Lao
 program. Recognition that some formerly colonial countries; such as
 Laos, were now,  in fact, independent even though misguided in their
 ties with the West, that neutrality was not a device of the imperialists,
 but an acceptable foreign. policy, that there are more roads than one
 to socialism, enabled the Pathet Lao to make previously impossible
 concessions to the RLG in the fields of both foreign and domestic policy
 for the country. Even more important is the emphasis of the new line
 upon legality, the abandonment of armed struggle in favor of political.
 action, the importance of the tactics of united fronts, "leftist" and
 r'nati.onal" unity, coalition governments, etc, , none of which could be
 implemented by the Pathet Lao while they were still illegal and in
 insurrection.  It was to be expected that, in obedience to the new dictates
 of the international Communist movement, the Pathet Lao would endeavor

 Cha.n.ges in th.e RLG Facil itate the Reopening of Negotiations
 24,    The Pathet Lao's problem of finding a basis for new talks with the
 RL.G without loss of face, was simplified by a change in the government
 which took place early in 1956,  The resignation of Prime Minister. Katay

 an opportunistic politician who was also motivated by personal ambition.
 Bong had consistently favored a negotiated settlement with the Pathet Lao
 and criticized the government for failing to come to terms with them.
 There was some reason. to believe that the morale of the Pathet Lao
 forces was low, following the suspension of the talks and the withdrawal

 of any of the opposition politicians, they were undoubtedly aware of them
 and counting on their weakening effect on the RLG position.

 25. The new Prime Minister was Prince Souvanna. Phouma, a n, ember
 of a cadet branch of the royal family and a half-brother of Pathet Lao
 leader Prince Souphanouvong.  While personally anti.-Communist, he
 could not ignore the desire in the country for a quick settlement of the
 Pathet Lao problem and the implications of the pro-Pathet Lao oppositio.n..
 Besides the possibilities of constitutional overthrow of the government
 over the Pathet Lao issue, there were rumors of an opposition plot for
 a coup d'etat in cooperation with the Pathet Lao forces.,
 Between the internal pressures and the external threat of the DRV
 and the CPR, plus the softening in the general climate of opposition to
 Communism which followed Geneva, Souvanna Phouma was placed in, a
 position in which he felt himself unable to avoid concessions to the Pathet
 Lao..
 26.      On 28 April, 1956, Prince Souphanouvong made a formal proposal.
 to the Prime Minister that they meet again to discuss the situation in Laos.
 There were increasing contacts between the Pathet Lao and the RLG and
 .arx` exchange of correspondence between the two half-brothers.  All. the
 indications in the next few months were of a reassessment by the Com-
 munists of their position with respect to Laos and of a new approach to
 negotiations.
 Burchett interview Signals New Negotiations
 27.     On 3 May, 1956, the Communist journalist Wilfred Burchett, arrived
 in Vientiane, travelling on a Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) passport.
 Another factor in the situation was the attitude of Prince Petsarath,
 another half-brother of the Prime Minister, in Bangkok.  As a member
 of the anti-French resistance, but one -who had neither accepted the
 French terms and joined the RLG in 1949, nor gone over to the Com-
 munists with Souphanouvong, he possessed inf luen.ce with both sides.
 Petsarath did not believe, or would not admit, the Communist nature
 of the Pathet Lao movement.  He urged the RL.G to regard the Pathet
 Lao as fellow patriots and to endeavor to bring them. back into the fold.
 It was widely believed that Petsarathrs influence could bring the
 Pathet Lao and RLG together. Many Laotians felt that a new govern-
 ment, headed by Petsarath, might have more success in dealing with
 the Pathet Lao.  Petsarath's position has undoubtedly helped to in-
 fluence the RLG toward, a, more conciliatory attitude in negotiating
 with the Pathet Lao,

 His visit had been arranged and his visa secured with the assistance of
 Samar Sen, the Indian chairman of the I:CC.  He was ostensibly in Laos
 as a special correspondent for Radio Peiping, but it soon became clear
 that he was also carrying out a mission for the international Communist
 movement
 Burchettas request for a personal interview was turned down by
 the Prime Minister who apparently had not been informed of the visit
 in advance.  He spent some time with the Polish member of the ICC.
 The Prime Minister then softened his refusal sufficiently to receive
 a set of written questions from Burchett and to furnish written answers.
 The questions foreshadowed what the Pathet Lao position would
 be in future negotiations.  They were concerned with the RLG. attitude
 on negotiations, the position of Pathet Lao forces after a settlement,
 the right of former Pathet Lao to engage in legal political activity and
 guarantees of their rights and liberties.  A series of questions dealt
 with RLG relations with the DRV and the CPR on the one hand and
 with the Western powers on the other, including one of the relationship
 between Laos and SEATO.  This unorthodox Communist diplomatic
 move was successful in that it brought about a revealing response from
 Souvanna Phouma, to the effect that the RLG. was willing and even
 anxious to resume talks looking to a settlement of the Pathet Lao problem.
 The Pathet Lao, after a settlement, he said, would be citizens of Laos,
 possessing the same rights and freedoms guaranteed by the constitution
 to all citizens, and with the same obligation to obey the laws.  Laos
 desired to maintain friendly relations with all countries.  She had no
 difficulties with the CPR, but deplored the violations of her territory
 by the DRV.  The Prime Minister said relations with the latter might
 be normalized if the DRV would withdraw her cadres and the arms and
 ammunition which she had supplied and give up the training and indoctrina-
 tion of Laos on DRV territory.  He explained Laos had no military
 obligations other than, those included in the U. N. charter and the Geneva
 Agreements, and that Laos was forbidden by the latter to join such
 alliances as SEATO and would request SEATO aid only in case of imperious
 necessity.
 Burchett had played a similar role during the Korean truce negotia-
 tions where he served as a channel for calculated "leaks" of informa-
 tion from Communist sources.

 28. It seems clear that Bu.rchett?s mission was to find out, in such a
 'way as to avoid any loss of face by the Pathet Lao and the DRV if the
 results should prove unacceptable, what the RLG: attitude to reopening
 of negotiations would be and what terms it 'would be willing to consider.
 It is significant that Burchett's questions included no mention of either
 the political or military situation in the northern provinces--an area
 in which the Pathet Lao did not want to make any concessions,
 Apparently Souvan.na Phou.mals answers met with Communist
 approval,  The Hanoi radio on May 7, broadcast the interview although
 the RLG had regarded it as secret and off the record,  Presumably Hanoi's
 intention was to publicly commit the RLG to negotiations along the lines
 indicated in the interview.
 New Talks in Vientiane and, an Agreement to Agree
 29.   From 1 August to 10 August, delegations of the Pathet Lao and the
 Royal Government talked in. Vientiane seeking an agreement which would
 end the civil war and the division of the country.  Prince Souvanna Phouma,
 with a number of the principal officials of the RLG represented the govern-
 ment side, while Prince Souphanouvon.g with some of his principal lieu-
 tenants, including Phoumi Vongvitchit and Nouhak, spoke for the Pathet
 Lao.  Most of the time in the formal meetings was devoted to speeches
 as much concerned with propaganda as with concrete proposals.  On the
 second day, Souphanouvong presented a five point agenda which, as
 reported by the Peiping radio on August 5, included the same Communist
 demands as those which Burchett's questions had emphasized and which
 the RLG implicitly accepted as a basis for discussions.
 The Pathet Lao urged first that the RLG. guarantee the freedom to
 vote and to stand for office to all and that the rights of freedom of speech,
 press and association, be assured, with universal suffrage which should
 include women,  The services of the Pathet Lao to the country should be
 recognized.  Since the election, of December 1955 was invalid due to the
 lack of participation by the Pathet Lao, new elections should be held.
 After  these points had been implemented, the Pathet Lao would be willing
 to discuss the question of the two northern provinces of Sam Neua and
 Phong Saly.  In the meantime they were willing that each side should
 appoint the governor of one province and the deputy governor of the other.
 TheE.LG should agree to recognize the titles and positions of Pathet Lao
 functionaries and to accept the Pathet Lao army as a unit of the ANL
 under ANL command.

 30, Souvanna Phouma stated the RLG positions informally at this
 meeting and more completely the next day.   He dealt with the first
 two items by pointing out that all these rights and freedoms were
 already guaranteed by the constitution.and existing law.  Once the
 Pathet Lao had given. up their illegal resistance to the government, they
 would enjoy these guarantees like anyone else.  They would then have
 the right to organize a political party and take part in political activity
 by the same procedures as other political. groups and the Prime Minister
 foresaw no difficulty for the Pathet Lao on this score.
 New elections could not be held at this time, since the constitution
 specified that they be held every four years.  The election had been post-
 poned from August to December, 1955 to give the Pathet Lao a chance to
 participate; if they had not availed themselves of it, the RLG. was not
 responsible.  However, the government was planning an increase in the
 size of the Assembly which would create a number of new seats.  In sup-
 plementary elections to fill. these seats, the Pathet Lao could take part.
 No promises could be made about a coalition government.  A change in
 government could take place only by normal constitutional processes.
 Such a change would undoubtedly take place after the supplementary elections
 and the composition. of the new government would be determined by both
 old and new deputies.
 As to foreign policy, the Prime Minister went on, his government,
 like that of Katay before him, was already committed to neutrality and
 peaceful coexistence and had joined with Nehru, of India in endorsing the
 Five Principles,  Laos had no military alliances and the only foreign base
 on her soil. was a French base at Seno which was approved by the Geneva
 agreements.  The incorporation of Pathet Lao personnel. into the administra-

 31,    It will be noted that the agenda offered by the Pathet Lao Communists
 and -which the Prime Minister by his answers implicitly accepted as a basis
 for discussion, places the question of the two northern provinces at the
 bottom of the list, to be considered after the other points have been imple-
 mented.  That is, when the shooting is ended, the Pathet Lao legalized as
 a political party with a guarantee of rights and freedoms, elections held and
 a coalition government established and Pathet Lao personnel. integrated into
 the army and the administration, then the Pathet Lao will be willing to talk
 about the basis for the restoration of R,LG authority in the northern provinces.

 The Pathet Lao had succeeded in focusinE the negotiations upon those
 issues, on. which it had s
 which i
 while subordinating those on
 omethin .  This order of priority is
 the reverse of that held by the RLG for which the reestablishment of its
 authority in the north had been the first essential..  Until. this time, the
 RLG had insisted on the effective restoration of its control of Sam Neua
 and Phong Saly as a prerequisite to any discussion of other issues.  Its
 acceptance of the Pathet Lao agenda represents a step back from its
 previous position and it may be said to have suffered a diplomatic defeat.
 The above is, of course, an example of a typical Communist
 maneuver in neeot:i!tions.  They have secured solid concessions on. the
 points of interest: to them
 the issues which are of first concern to
 reement to negotiate on
 32,   While these exchanges were going on in the formal meetings, back-
 stage conferences between the leaders were working out the actual agree-
 ments and on. 5 August, the first joint communique was released.  It
 dealt with the future foreign policy of Laos and the future status of the
 Pa.t:het Lao, following quite closely the line of the Communist proposals.
 Laos was to follow a policy of peace and neutrality.  It was to have no
 military alliances and permit no foreign bases other than those sanctioned
 by Geneva on. its soil.  It was to maintain good relations with all countries
 but particularly with its neighbors.  It will be noted that "neutrality" is
 _not defined, leaving the Pathet Lao free later to demand its own inter=
 pretation in Communist terms.  The '"neighbors"" with whom Laos is to
 maintain good relations can, oni.y be the CPR and the DRV and the Pathet
 Lao are likely to insist that '  ood relations" mean diplomatic relations.
 The communique also included a, guarantee that all Pathet Lao
 political organ izat.ions m-th.e party itself as well as all of its front organiza-
 tions for women., youth, labor, peasants, etc. , the cadres for which were
 already established in, the northern, provinces--should be allowed to
 operate legally throughout. Laos and, that, Pathet Lao cadres and "former
 resistance members"  should be allowed to participate in both the army
 and the administration, This was, of course, the principal objective of
 the Pathet Lao in a settlement, in addition. to retention of their territorial.
 base.  By this clause they were assured of their right to organize as a
 legal. party to carry on legal, political action..
 A second joint communique on. 10 August dealt with more specific
 points.  Supplementary elections were to be held throughout the kingdom
 ome

 by free and secret ballot.  A government of national, union with Pathet Lao
 participation was to be formed.  Mixed political and military commissions
 were to meet to work out the application of the agreements,
 33.    This is obviously more an agreement to agree than a concrete settle-
 me.nt of the issues involved.  The RLG has been driven from its previous
 stand on several. points.
 a)     Souva.n.n.a Phouma had repeatedly argued that RLG policy already
 included peace, neutrality, guarantees of rights and freedoms, absence
 of military alliances, and bases, etc. , and that there was no need to
 restate these.  In the communique, he has apparently yielded to the
 Communist view, and, by restatement, implicitly acknowledged that
 these items needed, further guarantee,
 b)     The RLG had insisted that any coalition government could only
 be established after the elections and that even then it would depend
 upon the result of the elections.  The communique pledged a coalition
 without reference either to the date or the result of the election,
 c)     The RLG had also insisted that the integration of Pathet Lao
 personnel into the army and the administration would be subject
 to the development of vacancies and to budgetary considerations.
 The communique pledges such integration without qualifications.
 In exch nge for these commitments, the RLG received no assurances
 whatever about the status of the northern provinces, although presumably
 this would be one of the questions to be discussed by the mixed political
 and military commissions.
 34.    The real. test of what these agreements amount to will. be found, of
 course, in what the mixed commissions are able to do to resolve the
 substantive questions which the communique dealt with only in principle.
 The Pathet Lao, having secured firm commitments in. principle on legaliza-
 tion, coalition government, elections, etc. , are now in a position to stall.

 the north and to insist, with some justification, that the implementation

 The vital points in the negotiations in the mixed commissions which

 a)     a political position in a new government based upon. its success
 or lack of success in. the elections; that is, to claim participation
 in a coalition cabinet only if they win a significant number of seats
 in the national assembly.
 b)     the bona fide restoration of the authority and administrative
 control of the RLG in the northern provinces.
 c)     the integration. of their military and political personnel in
 good faith with a bona fide acceptance of ANL and RLG command
 including the right to assign Pathet Lao functionaries and troop
 units to posts and bases in other parts of Laos.
 The Pathet Lao have delayed in sending their teams to the mix.gd
 commissions.  This has been. officially explained, as due to communication
 difficulties.  However, it has been suggested that some of the second-Level
 Pathet Lao leaders have not approved the agreements, perhaps in the
 fear that with. integration, their personal ambitions will suffer as a  result
 of their failure to qualify for integration.  It is also likely that the delay
 was to allow time for Prince Souphan.ouvonggs visit to Hanoi where he
 probably received i.nstructions from the Vietminh as to the line to be
 followed in the commission, talks,
 Prince Souvanna Ph.ouma., who had scheduled a trip to France for
 med.ical treatment and to report on the agreements with the Pathet Lao
 to the King, after first announcing that he could not go until the com-
 missions had begun. their work, changed his mind and departed for
 France prior to their first meetings.  It is not likely that any definitive
 solutions will be arrived at in. his absence.  The Pathet Lao, in any case,
 are probably not .n an .y h,u.rry to settle the details.  With the commit-
 _i
 they have already secured, the unresolved status of the remaining
 issues is probably satisfactory to them.
 36.     A complete evaluation of the Vientiane agreement and its implica-
 tions for Laos must wait upon the work of the commissions and the working
 out in practice of the arrangements.  At this point, however, it is apparent
 that the Communists have made substantial. gains.  Having conceded this
 much in principle,  it will be difficult for the RLG to avoid going even
 further in working out the details.
 The Pathet Lao are in a position to insist on the implementation of
 elections, legalization of the party, participation in a coalition govern-

 ment, etc. , as long as they fulfill their end of the bargain by continuing
 merely to negotiate the knotty problems of the two provinces and of
 integration of Pathet Lao personnel.  A legalistic basis has been laid
 for the Pathet Lao to demand, either as members of a coalition cabinet
 or as an opposition, the implementation of a neutral foreign policy in
 Communist terms--that is, a reduced dependence and eventual end to
 Western aid of all kinds, acceptance of Communist economic and
 cultural aid and missions, a public rejection of SEATO and the establish-
 ment of diplomatic relations with the CPR and the DRY.  A refusal
 of such demands by the RLG. would open the way to charges of bad
 d
 faith and violation of the Vientiane agreeents, when
 from the Pathet Lao group in coalition with other oppos
 eputies drawn
 groups
 might threaten to overturn the government.  Acceptance
 demands, of course, would leave Laos completely dep
 and at the mercy of the Pathet Lao, Vietnamese. Communists and China.
 Prince Souvanna Ph.ou.ma Visits Peiping and Hanoi
 37.   Prior to the resumption of negotiations in early August, the Chinese
 Communists set in motion another device to pressure or persuade the
 RLG into an agreement with the Pathet Lao.  Through the Indian members
 of the ICC, the Peiping government issued an invitation to the Laotion
 Prime Minister to visit Peiping.  Souvanna Phouma at first took the
 position that he could not visit China until the Pathet Lao problem was
 solved.  The Communists no doubt felt that Souvanna Phouma could be
 influenced by the red carpet treatment which they would give him and by
 being treated as a world statesman and also that he might be impressed
 with Chinas strength and progress.    They probably calculated that such
 a trip, while the Pathet Lao issue was still be ing negotiated, might bring
 the Prime Minister to a more amenable frame of mind.
 There was some opposition in. the RLG to the acceptance of this
 invitation, but Souvanna Phouma apparently felt that it should be accepted.
 Having taken the stand that the Pathet Lao question must be settled before
 he could go, he may have been influenced to agree to Communist terms
 in the joint communique in order to achieve a settlement which -would
 enable him to go.  At any rate, he, with a delegation of RLG officials
 departed for Peiping on 19 August.
 As soon. as the Chinese invitation was announced, the DRAT suggested
 that the RLG delegation also pay a visit to Hanoi.,  The RLG replied that
 while they could not make a formal visit under the circumstances, if their
 of such

 itinerary gave them sufficient time while in transit at Hanoi, they might
 talk informally.  Since the arrangements for the trip were in charge of
 the Indians and of Chinese representatives who came to Vientiane for
 that purpose, it was to be expected that sufficient time in Hanoi would
 be provided.  In fast, the RLG delegation spent about 48 hours in Hanoi
 on their way back from China.
 38.   The. RLG. delegation was royally received and entertained in both
 China and North Vietnam.  At luncheons and dinners, cocktail, parties
 and inspection tours,  5ouvanns. Phouma was called upon for speeches.
 Influenced by the deference accorded him and the courtesy due to a
 generous host, he apparently felt it incumbent upon him to speak
 repeatedly and at length about the friendship and historic ties between
 Laos and China, to pledge anew the close relationships which had
 existed. and which should exist again and to praise what he had seen
 in China.  Both the Peiping and Hanoi radios, from the beginning of
 the trip, devoted much time to it and went to every extreme, short of
 ,actual misstatement, to emphasize the Laotian Prime Minister's
 sometimes ambiguous and vague remarks about renewal of historic
 ties, the Five Prirciples, neutrality, the aid which China could give
 Laos, etc. , and to give the impression that Laos was moving over to
 the Communist side..
 Both Sou.vanna Phouma, upon his return to Laos, and othe r
 officials of. the RLG. were concerned about the effect which this trip,,
 coming on top of the joint communiques with the Pathet Lao, might
 have upon Laos a relations with the West, particularly with the U. S.
 on whose aid Laos was so dependent.  He insisted that the trip had
 been pruely a courtesy visit, that he had not agreed to the establishment
 of diplomatic relations, that no discussions had been held on Chinese
 economic aid or missions to Laos, that he had not denounced SEATO
 assistance to Laos in case of need and that Laos' neutrality was of
 the Swiss, not the Indian type.
 The RLG decided, as a counterbalance, to send a delegation to
 a. meeting of the Colombo Powers which it had previously decided not
 to attend.  Souvanna Phouma arranged that his stopover in Saigon,
 enroute to France, should be treated as a State visit to further offset
 his Chinese trip.
 r during his trip, the Prime Minister was technically
 by the nature of his speeches and the use made of

 them by Communist propaganda he had created an atmosphere and an
 impression which will make it more difficult for him to resist when,
 at some future time, proposals for exchange of diplomatic representa-
 tion, economic agreements and aid, and the like are made.
