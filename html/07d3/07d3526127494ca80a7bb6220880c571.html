 PLA Less Involved in Politics
 but Problems Linger
 After an extended period of political jockeying,
 Chinese civilian and military leaders in the past
 year or so seem to have managed to forge a tentative
 modus vivendi.   Residual mistrust exacerbated by con-
 tentious policy questions, however,  leaves the dura-
 bility of this arrangement open to some doubt.

 ably colored by his strong sympathies for the rela-
 tively pragmatic domestic and foreign policies asso-

 nant in Peking.
 expressed confidence that the party
 was in firm control of the army and was careful to
 point out that the army is solidly behind the poli-
 cies of Teng Hsiao-ping.   Indeed, he acknowledged
 that Teng had been personally responsible for the
 rehabilitation of a number of PLA officers who had
 come on hard times during the Cultural Revolution,
 including former chief of staff Lo Jui-ching.
 Teng's own appointment in January as chief of
 staff and the rebuilding of the high command with
 veterans who owe their return to the pragmatic coa-
 lition in char e in Pekin   is quite obviously the
 reason for                    optimism.  Moreover, there
 are no signs that the trend of the past two years of
 bringing back veteran cadres has abated.      Just re-
 cently, three rehabilitated officials were appointed
 as deputy directors of the influential General Politi-
 cal Department  (GPD).   This shifts the balance among

 leading members of the GPD in favor of those who op-
 posed leftist elements during the Cultural Revolution.
 In the view of                                     how-
 ever, the power game is not necessarily over.   he main-
 tained that the party has been able to control the army
 only because of the "loyalty and forbearance of a num-
 ber of responsible peo le"--obviousl  in the military
 establishment itself.                             went on to
 express his apprehension about officers wit in the
 military who want the army to retain a prominent po-
 litical role.
 Ever since Lin Piao's alleged coup attempt in
 mid-1971, party leaders have sought, with considerable
 success, to divest the PLA of the formidable political
 clout it accumulated as a result of the Cultural Rev-
 olution.   Despite the removal of many professional
 military men from leading civilian posts in the prov-
 inces and the unprecedented rotation in December 1973,
 of military region commanders out of their established
 power bases, there are signs that Peking is still
 uneasy about the military's political influence.
 said as much in discussing
 the dispatc   t is summer of PLA troops into Hangchow
 factories to quell worker unrest.  He indicated that
 the decision was taken in Peking with much foreboding
 that it might be a first step toward an expanded mili-
 tary voice in civilian affairs.  According to his
 account,  it was largely pressure from the army itself,
 coupled with the absence of effective alternatives,
 that forced Peking to authorize PLA intervention.
 This allusion to high level concern jibes well
 with other signs that civilian Chinese leaders want
 the PLA to keep its distance from civilian affairs.
 Senior Hong Kong cadres,  for example, were informed
 in late October that Teng had said that the army
 should return to its primary role as a fighting force
 and all non-military tasks should be taken away from

 Leadership turnouts during the past couple of
 months have shown that Peking finds it necessary to
 keep up its efforts to whittle down the political
 power of the military in the provinces.   Of late the
 focus seems to be at the military district levels
 where at least four commanders have been transferred.
 At a recent briefing in Canton, cadres were told
 that commanders and troops would be henceforth shifted
 periodically to prevent the re-emergence of "war-
 lor:dism."
 Peking's commemoration of the 40th anniversary
 of the Long March this month seems to encapsulate
 Peking's ambivalent attitude toward the military.
 On the one hand the unprecedented glorification of
 the Red Army went some distance toward polishing up
 the image of the PLA as a whole.   At the same time
 the media treatment clearly contained admonitions
 aimed at certain elements within the military estab-
 lishment who may favor some measure of accommodation
 with the Soviet Union.   In discussing foreign policy
 and without mentioning the army specifically, -
 implied that there are those in China
 who would like to see an improvement in relations with
 Moscow.                said that although China is cur-
 rently fighting the Soviet Union "tooth and nail,"
 this is  "not necessarily" a permanent situation.
 Turning to the question of military preparedness,
 expressed concern that China was
 ill-equipped to meet the Soviet threat and took to
 task those within the leadership who oppose the modern-
 ization of the PLA.                                      In an obvious swipe at the con-
 cept of a "people's war,"                   affirmed that
 the threat from the Soviets require   a conventional
 response and there was no room for "guerrilla ro-
 manticism."
 A debate over whether to modernize China's con-
 ventional forces or to invest more heavily in stra-
 tegic arms has surfaced from time to time in the Chi-
 nese press over the past few years.   The controversy
 seemed to become particularly strong during last
 year's anti-Confucius campaign.

 The debate appears to have come to a head at an
 enlarged meeting of the party's Military Affairs Com-
 mission last summer.   Following the session, the Cen-
 tral Committee issued Central Document No. 18 which--

 seem to reflect this
 outcome in that he stressed China's need for more
 conventional arms and commented that advanced weapons
 had been too costly.
 An article appearing in the People's Daily in
 early August made essentially the same argument, at-
 tacking unnamed figures who were said to advocate a
 significant increase in advanced weapons programs.
 The polemical tone of this lengthy article raises
 the possibility that Central Document No.  18 may not
 rest on as firm a consensus as its supporters would
 like.   The stumbling blocks at this stage may not only
 involve the residual influence of the advanced weapons
 lobby, but also budgetary constraints and political
 sensitivities.
 appeared to be keenly aware
 of these obstacles.   He claimed that the problem now
 was how to improve the PLA's military capabilities
 without appearing to go back on past doctrine and
 without too much expenditure.  According to him there
 are always difficulties in "going back too quickly
 and too publicly" on decisions made by Chairman Mao.
 This was apparently an allusion to Mao's concept of
 a "people's war" strategy for defending China.
 In discussing the expense involved in a modern-
 ization program, he remarked that this raised "seri-
 ous economic questions" and implied that the Chinese
 leadership was still puzzling over the question of
 financing.   One possibility which was discussed in
 Peking,                                      was the purchase
 of weapons technology a roa , possibly from the US.

 reflecting on succession and the impact it might have
 on remaining frictions in civilian-military relations.
 As the old guard passes from the scene, he clearly
 implied, this relationship will undergo its severest

 Learning from Tachai:         Agricultural
 Mechanization and Political Stability
 The month long national conference on learning
 from Tachai, China's agricultural model, ended in
 mid October and has received prompt provincial
 response.   Provincial propaganda, including
 speeches by some provincial party chiefs, has
 followed closely the line set out in a speech on
 October 15 by Vice Premier Hua Kuo-feng, the party
 leader in charge of agriculture.
 The main points in Hua's speech were:
 --mechanization of agriculture is essential
 for the longer term goal of modernizing
 industry, defense, science, and technology;
 --private plots larger than those permitted
 by party policy should be cut back, with
 the excess land turned back to the commune
 for collective farming;
 --at least 100 Tachai-type counties should
 be established annually for the next five
 years, one feature of a Tachai-type county
 being a steady improvement in the living
 standards of commune members;
 --another national agricultural conference will
 be held in five years to discuss the sixth
 five-year economic plan (China is scheduled
 to begin its fifth five-year plan next
 year).
 On the political front, Hua said responsibility
 for building Tachai-type counties rests with
 county party officials and warned that political
 factionalism should not be allowed to impede

 agricultural development.   Hua suggested that local
 officials who persist in factionalism be trans-
 ferred out of the area "as soon as possible" but
 that local officials who have merely made mistakes
 should be re-educated not transferred.   He called
 for annual "rectification" campaigns by local
 party organs to prevent political errors and
 ordered that those who engage in speculation,
 bribery, and theft be punished by law.
 Provincial response to the conference, while
 following closely the economic guidelines, has used
 the occasion to call for unity and stability and
 to condemn persistent factionalism.   The new leader
 of Yunnan Province urged all people to work
 together to modernize agriculture regardless of
 which faction they belong to.   Politburo member Wei
 Kuo-china, newly transferred to Kwangtung as party
 boss, used his maiden address to warn the
 traditionally independent-minded people of that
 province against arbitrarily changing policies
 established by the Central Committee or by the
 provincial leadership.
 Most provinces have called for studying the
 speeches at the conference made by vice premiers
 Teng Hsiao-ping, Hua Kuo-feng and Chen Yung-kuei,
 who himself hails from Tachai.   Kwangsi Province
 even mentioned a speech, otherwise not reported,
 by female Vice Premier Wu Kuei-hsien.   Interest-
 ingly, not a single province has so much as
 mentioned the "important speech" by Chiang Ching
 made at the opening of the conference but not
 published.    (CONFIDENTIAL)

 Promoting Pyongyang
 Peking has pulled out virtually all of the
 stops in its support of the pro-Pyongyang resolution
 during UN debate on the Korea question this year.
 China's objective is clearly to highlight the
 solidarity of Sino - North Korean interests,  especially
 in contrast with what Peking describes as Moscow's
 duplicity and deceptive designs on Pyongyang.   Never-
 theless, the Chinese have not closed the door to
 eventual adjustments on the Korea question.
 It has been clear for some time that Peking's
 essential concern in Korea has been to build the
 kind of relationship with Pyongyang that would help
 block any improvement in Soviet influence there.
 In order to satisfy the objective,  the Chinese
 have had to soft-pedal differences with the North
 Koreans.
 But there are differences.   Peking has long
 viewed disarray on the Korean Peninsula as inimical
 to its interests because of the possibility it
 could lead to Soviet "meddling" there.   As a
 result,  the Chinese have urged a cautious course
 on Pyongyang, most importantly by discouraging Kim
 Il-song from taking a more aggressive posture on
 the issue of Korean reunification.   Moreover,  the
 Chinese are persuaded that North Korean military
 action against the South would lead to complica-
 tions for Peking in its dealings with Tokyo,
 especially if the Japanese saw a need for rearmament
 in the wake of North Korean actions.   Nevertheless,
 the Chinese have increased their diplomatic support
 to the North Koreans over the past year or so in
 order to gain Pyongyang's confidence and, perhaps,
 in exchange for North Korean assurances that force
 will not be used against the South.

 demand the elimination of the US presence.   The
 US and Seoul have insisted that the UN Command
 cannot be dissolved until other means of enforcing
 the armistice have been created.
 Peking has expressed opposition,  "in
 principle," to the presence of foreign troops in
 other countries.   The Chinese have made it clear,
 however,  that they will not object to a continued
 US military role in countries where "special
 circumstances" exist--for example, Japan, Thailand,
 the Philippines.   Behind this view is the Chinese
 belief that hasty US withdrawals could result in
 Soviet attempts to "fill the vacuum," and the
 Chinese have implied privately that the same
 considerations influence their attitude toward the
 US military presence in South Korea.
 Despite such implicit Chinese support for a
 continuing US military role in Asia, Peking has
 felt compelled to provide firm public support of
 Pyongyang's case in the UN.   At the UN, both Foreign
 Minister Chiao Kuan-hua and UN Chief Delegate
 Huang Hua have characterized the US presence in
 South Korea as the key issue in any solution of
 the problem,. and both have expressed strong support
 for the resolution that calls for the removal of
 these troops.   Huang used unusually tough language
 in his denunciations of the US, describing as
 "downright deception" attempts to keep troops in
 the South and,  for the first time in three years
 at such a high level, accusing the US of "armed
 provocations" against the North.   Both Huang
 and Chiao dismissed as "impractical" Secretary
 Kissinger's recent'proposal to call a conference
 to discuss ways of preserving the armistice.
 The Chinese in the UN were at least as tough
 on the Soviets with regard to the Korea question.
 Huang accused Moscow of hypocrisy in its attitude
 toward Korean reunification and charged that the

 Soviets were,  in fact, attempting to "create two
 Koreas." Huang's comments marked the first time
 that the Chinese had used the UN forum to criticize
 Moscow's position on the Korea issue.  Outside
 the UN, the Chinese press has also drawn attention
 to Moscow's "flirtation" with Seoul, which Peking
 described as part of Soviet attempts to sabotage
 Korean reunification and to increase its influence
 in North Asia.
 In order to draw greater contrast between
 their own and Moscow's intentions in Pyongyang,  the
 Chinese this year buttressed their UN statements
 with forceful commentary on the 25th anniversary
 of the entry of Chinese "volunteers" into the
 Korean war.   The focus of these comments was on
 the historical importance of Korea to China's
 security.   In a joint editorial marking the
 anniversary, Peking asserted that the US had intended
 to invade China when it "launched" the war in
 Korea and that the Korean people's successful
 struggle "safeguarded the security of China."
 Speaking at an anniversary banquet in Peking,
 Politburo member Chen Hsi-lien made similar comments.
 These remarks are clearly designed to demonstrate
 the importance the Chinese attach to close relations
 with Pyongyang.
 Despite all the rhetoric, the Chinese have not
 painted themselves into a corner on the Korea
 question.   As in the past, Peking has not attached
 any special urgency to its call for the withdrawal
 of US forces in the South but has focused in a
 generalized way on the "unreasonableness" of the
 US position.   NCNA's account of the General
 Assembly First Committee voting on the Korea
 question--both the pro-Pyongyang and the pro-Seoul
 resolutions were approved--was remarkably low-key
 and suggests the possibility of eventual Chinese
 adjustments on the issue.   Criticism of the US role
 in the voting was limited and the harshest comments

 were saved for the Soviets.   The article concluded
 with a prediction that neither "superpower" will
 be able to obstruct "a reasonable solution" to the
 Korea question, a hint that future negotiations
 may be required in order to reach a solution.
 Another consideration that the Chinese almost
 certainly must be taking into account is President
 Ford's scheduled visit to Peking.   The full General
 Assembly will probably take up the Korea matter
 next week and heated debate could develop if both
 resolutions are voted on by that body.   Chinese
 leaders probably are persuaded that it would be
 prudent to avoid another bitter exchange on Korea
 just days before President Ford's trip to China.
 In, fact, Huang Hua last week said that Peking would
 accept a proposal that the General Assembly simply
 approve the First Committee report without either
 debating or voting on the two separate resolutions.
 This procedure would enshrine the pro-Pyongyang
 resolution in the UN record, but would not result
 in. any clear cut solution of the question,  a
 development that almost certainly would satisfy
 Peking.   (CONFIDENTIAL NOFORN)

 Two Strikes on Wang
 For the second time this year, stories are
 making the rounds in China that young party vice
 chairman Wang Hung-wen has failed to come up with
 an adequate answer to important questions put to
 him by Mao.   In both instances, the man who sup-
 plied the right answer was Teng Hsiao-ping,  although
 one version of the story credits Chang Chun-chiao
 with providing the satisfactory response.
 The most recent account, reportedly transmitted
 in a Central Committee document, is of a conversa-
 tion in which Mao asked Wang and Teng for their
 opinions about what China would be like in the next
 decade.  Wang's response was upbeat, saying that
 people would continue to give prominence to Mao's
 thought.  Teng, on the other hand, took a darker
 view, warning that changes must be made now to im-
 prove the people's living conditions in order to
 avert future problems.   Mao reportedly agreed with
 Teng's assessment and told Wang to learn from that
 response.   Another version has Chang Chun-chiao
 responding in much the same vein as Teng, with Mao
 expressing his dissatisfaction with Wang's reply
 and ordering him to undergo re-education in Shanghai.
 Wang has not appeared in Peking since May but
 has appeared in Shanghai on two occasions.   Reports
 that he has been in nearby Chekiang Province since
 July supervising the restoration of order in that
 troubled area are beginning to wear a bit thin in
 light of his prolonged absence from the capital and
 the stories now circulating about him--obviously
 at Peking's initiative, given the apparent inclusion
 of one version in a central document.
 The current story is almost an exact replica
 of an alleged earlier discussion in which Mao re-

 portedly asked Teng and Wang how to handle the
 Chekiang situation.   On that occasion, too, Teng's
 answer showed a greater understanding of the com-
 plexities of the situation and Wang was admonished
 by Mao to study Teng's response.
 Wang's alleged answers seem almost overly sim-
 plistic, perhaps a contrivance by Peking to show
 that, despite his rapid rise in the party hierarchy,
 Wang has much to learn before he is competent to
 handle the diverse and complex problems facing China.
 In. this, he is a perfect foil for the vastly more
 experienced Teng, whose answers leave little doubt
 that he is capable of running the country after Mao's
 death and that he has Mao's support.  That one ver-
 sion of the story substitutes Chang Chun-chiao for
 Teng may not be an accident.   Chang stands a good
 chance to succeed Teng over the longer term.
 The fact that these stories are circulating
 widely in rumor form suggests they are a gauge of the
 Chinese people's assessment of the three men.   Based
 on these stories, it would appear that the populace
 would be far more comfortable with Teng and later
 Chang as leaders in the post-Mao era, largely because
 they appear to be more sensitive and responsive to
 the needs of the people.
 More importantly, Peking's apparently deliberate
 role in portraying these men in such a manner says
 much about their relative political standing.  Teng
 and Chang, obviously, are doing very well, but Wang
 Hung-wen's status within the hierarchy seems to have
 slipped.   (SECRET NOFORN/NOCONTRACT)

 Concern that the current education system is
 inadequate for China's needs, first voiced by Pre-
 mier Chou En-lai at the National People's Congress
 in January, reportedly was reiterated in more spe-
 cific terms in a recent speech by Minister of Edu-
 cation Chou Jung-hsin.   The minister's criticism
 focused mainly on the educational reforms of the
 Cultural Revolution, reforms initiated at Mao's
 behest that emphasized politics at the expense of
 academic training.
 University educators have long complained about
 the poor quality of entering students, the lack of
 attention to studying basic scientific theory, and
 the inordinate amount of time spent discussing po-
 litical issues.   Chou Jung-hsin echoed these com-
 plaints and summed up the shortcomings of current
 educational policy by saying that university stu-
 dents, who ideally should be both "red"  (thoroughly
 familiar with communist doctrine)  and "expert" in
 their chosen fields,  are neither.
 Although problems with the education system
 have long been recognized, very little has been
 done about them over the years.   Lack of progress
 on this issue is due in part to the highly politi-
 cal nature of educational policy--any changes in
 the Cultural Revolution reforms have been staunchly
 opposed by the party's left wing--and perhaps by
 some uncertainty over where Mao stands.
 Mao's current position is becoming more clear.
 It appears that he is now prepared to endorse changes
 in the reform program that he himself introduced
 during the Cultural Revolution.   According to stor-
 ies circulating in Shanghai,  Mao believes that uni-
 versity education must be improved and that students

 need not study political theory in college but can
 learn it at work.   Chou Jung-hsin,  in his speech,
 claimed that Mao had ordered a symposium to be held
 in 1974 on the need to increase the study of basic
 scientific theory in the universities and,  in that
 same year,  instructed that some high school graduates
 be admitted directly into the universities without
 first spending a few years working in the rural
 areas.
 Not surprisingly, the physicist who chaired
 the symposium was subsequently attacked, undoubtedly
 by party left wingers, and none of the local offi-
 cials responsible for university enrollment responded
 to Mao's offer to accept high school graduates di-
 rectly into some universities.
 Chou Jung-hsin's speech linking Mao to pro-
 posed improvements in the education system has
 apparently been disseminated  throughout China.
 This firmer fix on Mao's views toward higher edu-
 cation may bolster efforts to improve the situation
 in the universities, which remain the weakest link
 in China's stated goal of modernizing agriculture,
 industry, defense, and science and technology.   The
 key to modernizing science and technology is to
 improve academic training in the universities.
 Steps have been taken toward modernization in the
 other areas, but thus far very little has been done
 to improve the sorry state of China's universities.
 In addition to Mao's backing for changes in
 the education system, which would provide short
 term justification for making improvements in that
 area,  there are signs that Peking is trying to en-
 sure that education be kept out of the hands of
 party left wingers over the longer term.   Politburo
 member Chang Chun-chiao, who probably favors improve-
 ment in the academic field,  recently met with the
 Venezuelan minister of education,  suggesting that
 the powerful Chang may have added education to his

 growing list of responsibilities.
 The high level attention devoted to problems
 in that area, Mao's own approval for changes, and
 Chang Chun-chiao's possible involvement are all
 signs that the logjam on educational policy may
 soon be broken.   (SECRET NOFORN/NOCONTRACT)

 West Germany:   No Wrinkles in the Red Carpet
 West German Chancellor Schmidt's recently con-
 cluded state visit to China, which he has declared
 a "success," was carefully stage-managed by the Chi-
 nese.   Schmidt postponed his scheduled visit early
 this year after the Chinese gave a high level re-
 ception to Schmidt's arch conservative political
 rival Franz-Josef Strauss.   The postponement clearly
 dismayed the Chinese who began working immediately
 to improve Sino-German relations and to smooth the
 way for the rescheduled state visit.   During the
 spring,   summer, and early fall, the Chinese:
 --ordered their embassy in Bonn to expand
 contacts with Schmidt's Social Democratic
 Party;
 --expedited preparations in Peking for a
 German technical exhibition, the largest
 and best attended foreign exhibition ever
 held in China;
 --completed negotiations for a Sino-German
 aviation and maritime agreement and for
 the establishment of a joint economic
 commission so that formal signing cere-
 monies could take place during Schmidt's
 visit;
 --gave Franz-Josef Strauss more routine
 treatment during his second visit to
 Peking in September;
 ---showed keen interest in expanding
 German imports while talking of modi-
 fying China's raw material export
 policy to allow sales of some coal
 and oil to West Germany.

 During his five-day stay in China, Schmidt
 had ceremonial meetings with Mao and with National
 People's Congress Chairman Chu Teh and was accorded
 the honor of being the first Western government head
 to visit Sinkiang Province on the Sino-Soviet border.
 The chancellor had indicated apprehension that pub-
 lic differences over East-West detente might mar his
 visit and give political ammunition to his critics
 at home--a concern that was undoubtedly heightened in
 the wake of Secretary Kissinger's visit.   But he came
 away openly pleased with Chinese awareness of his
 sensitivities in this regard.
 Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping gave heavy play
 to anti-Soviet, anti-detente themes in his welcom-
 ing speech but made no direct attacks on German
 Ostpolitik.   Teng apparently took the same tack in
 private discussions with the West Germans and his
 farewell speech was most noteworthy for its ring-
 ing endorsement of European unity rather than any
 anti-superpower vitriol.   The absence of a com-
 munique on Schmidt's departure was somewhat puzzl-
 ing:                       a formal joint statement might have been
 expected on the initial visit by the head of such
 an important government and there were some indica-
 tions that initial plans called for one.   Some fric-
 tion over wording may have arisen during preliminary
 discussions between the two sides, and mutual agree-
 ment may have been reached to dispense with a com-
 munique rather than risk a second postponement of
 the visit--a development both Peking and Bonn un-
 doubtedly wanted to avoid.   In any event, both
 sides pointed to the signing of the maritime and
 aviation agreements and the establishment of the
 joint commission as evidence of the visit's suc-
 cess and of warming bilateral relations.
 The Chinese may soon realize some welcome re-
 turns for their hospitality.   On the same day that
 Schmidt arrived in China, Bonn announced that it
 favored Peking in its dispute with Taipei over
 ownership of some real estate in West Berlin.

 The move adds substance to rumors that Bonn would
 not block a Chinese request to establish a con-

 Peking's request for permission to post Chinese
 military attaches in West Germany.   Peking has been
 pushing for action on both questions for nearly two
 years, recognizing that either step would irritate
 Moscow and provide further proof of China's expand-
 ing ties with Western Europe.   (SECRET NOFORN/N000N-
