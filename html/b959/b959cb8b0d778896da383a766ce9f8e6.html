 The major military activity
 in South Vietnam this week was in
 the central coastal region, where
 large Allied forces made sporadic
 contact with a Viet Cong regimental
 force which had battered two gov-
 ernment battalions on 8-9 December
 near the Quang Nam - Quang Tin
 border.   US B-52 Stratofortresses
 supported US Marines and Vietnam-
 ese ground troops by bombing
 nearby Communist base areas four
 times between 11 and 14 December.
 Heavy fog and rain occasionally
 impaired the effectiveness of
 other tactical aircraft as well
 as mobility on the ground.   Al-
 lied casualties during the ten-
 day operation totaled nearly 600
 killed, wounded, or missing.   Con-
 firmed Viet Cong losses were about
 250 killed and captured, although
 estimates of additional enemy
 dead are as high as 1,250.
 Government efforts elsewhere
 during the week were highlighted
 by generally successful search
 operations in the IV Corps prov-
 inces of Go Cong, Vinh Binh, and
 Dinh Tuong, where more than 400
 Viet Cong were killed, with only
 moderate government losses.   Con-
 tinuing Allied operations north-
 west of Saigon failed to engage
 large enemy forces near the Binh
 Duong - Tay Ninh border, although
 a sizable Viet Cong facility was
 discovered.
 slightly, but incidents of
 enemy harassment, sabotage, and
 'terrorism rose to the second
 highest level of the year.   Re-
 newed incidents of terrorism
 were directed against Vietnamese
 police in Saigon, and a large
 number of reports have forecast
 a spate of Viet Cong terrorism
 against both Vietnamese and US
 installations during the next
 two weeks to coincide with Com-
 munist anniversaries.
 Political developments in
 Saigon this week centered around
 the annual conference of the
 Unified Buddhist Association
 (UBA).   The opening address by
 aged monk Thich Tinh Khiet ap-
 parently did not contain the am-
 biguous remarks previously
 drafted by influential Thich Tri
 Quang.   However, the alleged
 clesecration of a Buddhist pagoda
 by US Marines in the Da Nang area
 this month was discussed.   A
 statement by Ambassador Lodge
 offering US assistance in restor-
 ing the pagoda  (without acknowl-
 edging  US culpability) satis-
 fied most UBA leaders, but younger
 and more militant monks are re-
 portedly still demanding a US
 apology.   The conference re-
 elected the moderate UBA leader-
 ship.
 Large-scale activity ini-
 tiated by the Viet Cong declined

 The basic economic guide-lines
 the USSR has set forth for next
 year indicate a moderate shift in
 the allocation of resources in fa-
 vor of military and space programs,
 consumer welfare, and the agricul-
 tural program adopted last March.
 The increased efforts in these
 areas will be at the expense of a
 recovery in the rate of economic
 growth, particularly in the in-
 dustrial sector.
 The increase in military and
 space expenditures is signaled by
 a 5-percent rise in the explicit
 defense allocation in the state
 budget.   More persuasively, a
 significant increase in production
 of military and space materiel is
 implied by the 9-percent increase
 in machinery and equipment output.
 When compared with a rise of less
 than 5 percent in the supply of
 such items to investment--the major
 nonmilitary consumer of machinery
 and equipment--it is apparent that
 considerable increases in the sup-
 ply of hardware to the defense es-
 tablishment are contemplated.
 Other appropriations for defense
 are probably concealed in such
 budgetary categories as science,
 the outlay for which is almost
 10 percent higher next year than
 in 1965.
 The regime's intention to im-
 prove consumer welfare next year
 is reflected in the 6.5-percent
 rise planned in per capita real
 income.  There will also be a con-
 tinued increase in pensions as
 well as in expenditures for health
 and education.   Much of the im-
 provement in consumer welfare,
 Page 5
 however, will depend on fulfilling
 the planned increase of 8 to l0
 percent in total farm output. Pres-
 ent; indications are that an increase
 of this magnitude will not be
 achieved.
 Production increases have been
 scheduled for both soft goods and
 consumer durables, but even if they
 are realized it is doubtful that
 next year will see any substantial re-
 lief in the inf4ationary pressures
 now present in the USSR.    Although
 money incomes of the population in
 1965 grew by 10 percent, savings
 deposits rose by 19 percent and in-
 ventories of unsold consumer goods
 continue to pile up in warehouses.
 The leadership recognizes the in-
 centive advantages involved in a
 larger supply of acceptable consumer
 goods, but it is apparently unwill-
 ing or unable to provide more than
 a modest improvement in 1966.
 In addition to a healthy in-
 crease of 16 percent in agricultural
 investment scheduled for 1966, other
 measures are consistent with the
 farm support program promulgated by
 Brezhnev in March.   The relatively.,
 low delivery quotas for the major
 agricultural products approved last
 March have been  maintained, and
 the I.2-percent rise planned in the
 income of collective farmers is
 probably aimed at increasing incen-
 tives,,.  Scheduled deliveries of farm
 machinery and trucks in 1966 cor-
 respond to the average annual rates
 of increase needed to attain the
 five--year goals contained in Brezh-

 Soviet standards.   In addition
 to the apparent decline in the
 rate of expanding new capacity,
 this projected decline reflects
 the mediocre 1965 harvests,
 which will deprive the light and
 food industries of some of their
 expected raw materials.   Although
 the current campaign for quality
 instead of quantity production
 may have contributed to the low
 industrial target, the industrial
 reform program approved in
 October for 1966 through 1968
 will not be a major disrupting
 factor next year.   Only selected
 branches of the light and food
 industries will be operating on
 the new system by the end of
 1966.
 Restrictions on the travel
 of US military attachds in the
 USSR, imposed by Moscow because
 of its displeasure over publica-
 tion of the Penkovsky papers,
 are continuing into their second
 month.   Earlier this month,  in
 a meeting with a high Defense
 Ministry official, the US at-
 tachds                             gained the impression
 that Soviet irritation over the
 papers was on the wane.   On 13
 December, however, when they asked
 when the  travel ban would be
 lifted,  they received a negative
 reaction.
 The restrictions were im-
 posed on 18 November.   Although
 the Soviets officially protested
 the publication of the papers,
 they have carefully limited
 retaliatory action to the mili-
 tary sphere.   In so doing, Mos-
 cow has chosen an approach that
 is relatively free from publicity
 and not so provocative as to
 cause Soviet-US relations to
 fall into complete disrepair.
 The reaction to the papers
 disrupted a four-month period
 of unusual cordiality noted by
 the US Army atta.ch8 in his con-
 tacts with high-level Soviet
 officers in Moscow.   The attache
 stated that "even Malinovsky has
 been pleasant."  He concluded
 that although the Soviets prob-
 ably desired to keep to a minimum
 public displays of US-Soviet
 friendship because of Vietnam,
 they wished to remain amicable
 in military relationships and
 other areas.   Shortly before
 publication of the papers, the
 Soviets had proposed that the
 USSR and the US exchange military
 information and maneuver observers.
 There are as yet no indications
 that the Soviet position on
 these exchanges will be affected
 by the papers' publication.
 The Soviet military attaches
 in Some, Ankara, Vienna, and
 Parris have also suddenly become
 friendlier to their US counter-
 parts.   The US attachds in these
 capitals have been impressed by
 the unusual frankness and friend-
 liness of the Soviets.   In one
 instance a Soviet assistant
 attache in Paris stated on 9
 November that his personal mis-.

 mote closer ties between the US

 SOVIET - EAST EUROPEAN LONG-TERM TRADE PACTS
 The increasingly business-
 like nature of Soviet trade with
 East European countries has been
 reflected in recently concluded
 trade pacts covering the period
 from 1966 to 1970.   Trade during
 this time will be less favorable
 for Eastern Europe than has been
 the case recently.   However,  both
 sides recognize that these coun-
 tries will continue to depend
 economically on the USSR.
 In the past two months Mos-
 cow has signed long-term trade
 agreements with Poland,  Czecho-
 slovakia,  East Germany,                      Bulgaria,
 and Hungary.   The pacts call for
 substantial,  although generally
 declining, rates of growth in
 exchanges.   Most of the basic
 raw materials and fuels that
 these countries need to import
 will still be supplied by the
 USSR.   Certain uneconomic prac-
 tices such as the supply of iron
 ore by expensive long-haul ground
 transport to Hungary and East
 Germany, however, are to be cur-
 tailed.   Because of changing re-
 quirements in Eastern Europe,  So-
 viet deliveries of crude oil--
 needed to expand and modernize
 petrochemical and energy indus-
 tries--and of rolled steel for
 machinery and equipment indus-
 tries are scheduled to rise rap-
 idly.
 There was hard bargaining
 throughout  1965 over Soviet pro-
 vision of foodstuffs and raw ma-
 terials,  particularly grain. De-
 liveries of these products had
 fallen sharply since the 1963
 Soviet crop failure.   In the
 case of Czechoslovakia, Prague's
 irritation over the Soviets'
 failure to commit themselves on
 future grain deliveries was so
 great that the matter came under
 top-level discussion during
 Brezhnev's visit to Prague in
 mid-October.   Subsequently, it
 was announced that grain ship-
 ments would rise over 1964-65
 levels and that the USSR would
 supply about two thirds of Czech-
 oslovakia's estimated import
 requirement of two million tons
 next year.
 A similar arrangement prob-
 ably has been worked out with
 East Germany, which also depends
 on the USSR for its basic wheat
 imports, but no amounts have as
 yet been announced.   However,
 the Soviets reportedly harshly
 rejected other East German trade
 proposals,  presumably because
 they did not conform to Moscow's
 intention to conduct its trade
 with more regard for its own
 economic interests.   East Ger-
 many's preliminary plans for 1966
 to 1970 indicated that it ex-
 pected more favorable treatment
 than was forthcoming.   (See also
 next article, on the Apel affair.)
 Despite Moscow's reluctance
 to expand exports of grain and
 some important industrial raw ma-
 terials and its greater selectiv-
 ity in accepting imports of East
 European manufactures,   exchanges
 between the USSR and Eastern Eu-
 rope will remain sizable--more
 than 50 percent of Soviet foreign
 trade.

 THE APEL AFFAIR IN EAST GERMANY
 Although the circumstances
 surrounding East German planning
 chief Erich Apel's suicide on 3
 December remain unclear, the un-
 confirmed West German accounts
 and explanations seem to be plaus-
 ible enough to cause confusion
 within the East German Communist
 (SED) party and among the people.
 If these accounts are accurate,
 furthermore, the Apel affair
 could have repercussions within
 the party leadership and in East
 German - Soviet relations.
 Sensational West German ac-
 counts of a violent argument be-
 tween Apel and the Ulbricht
 leadership over reported Soviet
 economic exploitation have been
 broadcast widely by radio and
 TV.   There is no confirmation,
 however, that Apel prepared a
 document detailing East German
 differences with the USSR or
 that any such document is in
 Western hands.   West German ac-
 counts have referred to a letter,
 one or two documents in the form
 of testaments, or a personal
 notebook kept by Apel.  No West
 German or Berlin official has
 admitted to US officials seeing
 any of these documents.
 East German sensitivity to
 the whole matter is reflected in
 the heavy propaganda labeling
 the Western accounts as fiction
 and the documents as nonexistent,
 and extolling the new Soviet -
 East German trade agreement.
 If, as some reports indi-
 cate, several East German "tech-
 nocrats" side with Apel against
 the majority of the leadership,
 a few demotions may be forth-
 coming.   No wholesale purging
 is expected, however, because
 these men are needed to run the
 economy, now undergoing a re-
 organization.   In any event, the
 Ulbricht regime may reconsider
 the wisdom of promoting apolit-
 ical  "technocrats" like Apel,
 or at least of circumscribing
 more carefully their role in
 top policy levels of the party.

 and the amounts extended have
 been calculated primarily for

 in Asia.   Since then, Peking has

 COMMUNISTS MAY STEP UP FIGHTING IN LAOS
 The Communists apparently
 plan to intensify the fighting
 in Laos, although they have made
 no significant new attacks in the
 past several weeks.
 On 8 December the Pathet Lao
 radio announced a "mobilization
 order" which described the mili-
 tary situation as "very critical"
 and claimed that "counterthrusts"
 would have to be made to preserve
 "our territory."  These actions
 are portrayed as defensive, but
 the Communists also refer to pos-
 sible thrusts in areas "held by
 the enemy."  The entire state-
 ment is reminiscent of similar
 Communist exhortations made prior
 to increased military activity
 in past years.
 In the panhandle area, mili-
 tary activity in the past week
 has been confined to small-scale
 skirmishes.   Government forces
 are continuing a cautious sweep
 south and east of Thakhek in an
 effort to regain positions lost
 JLn early November.   The Commu-
 nists apparently have strength-
 ened their positions along the
 Se Bang Fai River and have in-
 creased their probes in that
 the Commu-
 nists have made plans for an at-
 tack just north of Attopeu dur-
 ing the current dry season.
 There are indications that
 the Communists may also be plan-
 ning to step up their activity
 in northern Laos, where they
 have been generally quiet during
 the past ten months.   They may
 strike back in the Plaine des
 Jarres area, where a strategic
 Communist position has been un-
 der concerted attack in the past
 several weeks.  Roadwatch re-
 ports indicating very heavy enemy
 truck movements near Samneua

 INDONESIAN ARMY KEEPS INITIATIVE AGAINST SUKARNO
 The Indonesian Army is main-
 taining the initiative in its
 political sparring with President
 Sukarno.
 It registered a clear gain
 this week with the removal of
 Foreign Minister Subandrio from
 his position as deputy commander
 of the powerful Supreme Opera-
 tions Command (KOTI).   A trium-
 virate replaces him.    In the new
 arrangement,  Defense Minister
 Nasution will be responsible for
 military affairs,  the Sultan of
 Jogjakarta will oversee economic
 matters, and Minister for People's
 Relations Ruslan Abdulgani will
 handle social issues.
 Subandrio's ouster may indi-
 cate that Sukarno is reassessing
 the political cost of continued
 support for a man widely thought
 to be implicated in September's
 abortive coup.   The US Embassy
 in Djakarta reports a growing
 coolness toward Sukarno on the
 part of the Indonesian press;
 most papers have endorsed the
 army's recent actions at Sukarno's
 expense.
 Sukarno has devoted increas-
 ing attention to the country's
 growing economic crisis.   In an
 effort to stem rocketing infla-
 tion the President ordered an
 exchange of currency at the rate
 of 1,000 old to one new rupiah,
 combined with a flat confiscation
 of 10 percent of the new currency.
 This,  plus a ceiling on prices
 and a tight control of import
 quotas,  should have a measurable
 deflationary impact.   The army
 hopes to exploit popular dissatis-
 faction over the worsening eco-
 Inomic situation by placing the
 !blame at Sukarno's door.
 Suppression of the Communist
 Party (PKI) continues, and the
 army apparently is more hopeful
 than ever of eventually eliminat-
 ing it from the Indonesian politi-
 cal mosaic.
 Sukarno,
 however, may still hope

 he warned
 that "there would no

 without

 Subandrio, who remains for-
 eign minister,  has called for
 talks with Singapore and Malay-
 sia's component territories on
 their mutual differences.   This
 appears to be little more than a
 propaganda gesture, since it fails
 to recognize the integrity of the
 Malaysian Federation.   There is
 some likelihood,  however,  that
 Subandrio is genuinely seeking
 to improve relations with Singa-
 pore.

 YEMEN CONFERENCE IN DEADLOCK
 After over three weeks of
 intermittent conferring at the
 village of Harad in northern
 Yemen, Yemeni republicans and
 royalists remain deadlocked over
 the formation of a joint provi-
 sional government, as provided
 for in the agreement of last
 August between Egypt's President
 Nasir and Saudi King Faysal. The
 two sides are wrangling over the
 meaning of the terms of the agree-
 ment, which also outlined other
 steps for ending the three-year-
 old civil war.
 The republicans insist that
 the provisional government be
 republican in name, on the grounds
 that the present republican gov-
 ernment is internationally recog-
 nized.                    The national plebiscite
 scheduled for next November would
 then accept or reject it. The
 royalists, backed by Faysal, in-
 sist that the provisional regime
 be neutral, and suggest labeling
 it simply "the state of Yemen"
 or "the provisional government
 of Yemen."
 The Saudi and Egyptian leaders
 have already kept the conference
 going once when it was on the verge
 of collapse, and their views re-
 main crucial. The Saudis have urged
 again that the conference continue
 Elt all costs.   The Egyptians' posi-
 tion has been equivocal, although
 INtasir still seems intent on reach-
 ing a settlement, however precar-
 ious, that would enable him to take
 his more than 50,000 troops home.
 POLITICS REVIVING AFTER CONGO COUP
 Congolese politics are begin-
 ning to simmer again as the momen-
 tum of General Mobutu's coup runs
 down.   Most of the politicians are
 disappointed at Mobutu's assump-
 tion of power for five years, some
 important tribal groupings are
 restive,
 For the next few weeks at
 least, Mobutu and Premier Mulamba
 should be able to keep ahead of
 these disparate opposition ele-
 ments.    However, Mobutu's
 call for austerity and hard work
 seems unlikely to jolt the coun-
 try out of its traditional ways,
 Jockeying for position among
 civilian and military factions
 thus seems likely to increase
 gradually in intensity and to
 pose a steadily greater chal-
 lenge to Mobutu.

 ain into strong action against
 Rhodesia which were offered this

 ference,  this time with heads of

 President Kenyatta plans to re-

 cision for mandatory sanctions
 against Rhodesia under chapter
 VII   of  the UN Charter.
 President Kaunda continues
 in-
 to place Zambia's economic
 and
 terests above his personal political reasons for wanting
 to join the sanctions-against-
 Rhodesia club.   His government
 decided for the time being to
 meet Prime Minister Smith's
 requirement that all Rhodesian
 exports to Zambia be paid for
 in nonsterling currency.
 Kaunda continues to insist
 that Britain must station troops
 on the Rhodesian side of the Ka-
 riba dam.  Kaunda?is unlikely to
 accept the World Bank's reported
 offer to establish a small se-
 curity force at the dam.   In an
 apparent attempt to exert more
 pressure on London to station
 British troops there, Kaunda has
 decided-to dispatch delegations
 to Washington and Moscow to dis-
 cuss protection of the dam.
 In Rhodesia, -economic sanc-
 tions are being felt sooner than
 anticipated,  but there are no
 apparent breaks in the ranks of
 the white militants.   Rather,
 Smith's support--even among itiose
 not originally committed toini-

 Americans traveling and working in
 the remote areas risk  American
 casualties, although no deaths
 have yet resulted.   The embassy is
 concerned also that security prob-
 lems will impede US developmental
 projects.
 Various motivations stir the
 dissidents:   religious enmity,
 tribal rivalries, political dif-
 ferences, and simple brigandage
 as practiced through the centuries.
 The ruling Christian Amhara peoples
 have traditionally displayed a
 superior attitude toward the Mus-
 lim and animist tribesmen, the cen-
 tral government has failed to re-
 dress many of their long-standing
 grievances, and the pace of devel-
 opment in remote areas has lagged.
 In recent years a heavy in-
 flux of arms has reached the dissi-
 dent tribes, and occasionally given
 them an advantage over government
 security forces.   Some weapons
 have been acquired through capture
 from government-supplied tribes,
 from police and army units, and
 from travelers.   Others are ac-
 quired by smuggling from neighbor-
 ing countries, and still others
 come initially from Ethiopian of-
 ficials, including the Emperor, who
 seek thus to secure the loyalty of
 doubtful tribes.   In addition, the
 wide distribution of transistor ra-
 dios has increased the impact of
 propaganda broadcast from Cairo,
 Khartoum, Damascus, and Mogadiscio.
 In the view of the embassy the
 most crucial factor is the weakness
 of the Ethiopian security forces,
 which continue to deal with tribal
 dissidence in the traditional man-
 ner by burning villages, destroying
 or removing crops and cattle, and
 beating or killing the people. In
 addition, the Emperor, even while
 seeking further aid from the US, has
 obstructed  modernization of the
 forces lest he increase their poten-
 tial for staging a coup.

 FINNISH PROPOSAL TO NEUTRALIZE NORTHERN SCANDINAVIA
 There has been noofficial
 Norwegian reply to Finnish Presi-
 dent Kekkonen's proposal for a
 treaty between Norway and Finland
 neutralizing their northernmost
 provinces.   The proposal was made
 in a public address on 29 November.
 The Norwegian press and various
 Oslo officials have reacted in an
 almost uniformly negative fashion,
 but the Borten government has
 hesitated to reject the suggestion
 out of hand and is taking the po-
 sition that no immediate answer
 is required.
 The proposal was couched in im-
 precise terms,  but Kekkonen con-
 tended that the treaty would allev-
 iate tension along the Finnish-Nor-
 wegian border during periods of in-
 ternational crisis and would elimi-
 nate the threat to this area posed
 by the fact that NATO and Soviet
 forces face one another along Nor-
 way's 122-mile frontier with the
 USSR in the far north.   Kekkonen ap-
 parently has it in mind that both
 Norway and Finland would defend
 this territory against a move by
 either Warsaw Pact or NATO countries

 to use the area as a
 path of attack.In short,
 Norway--a NATO member--
 would be asked to remove
 all or a portion of the
 northernmost part of its
 territory from the pro-
 tection of the alliance.
 Norway has never per-
 mitted foreign troops or
 nuclear weapons to be
 stationed on its soil in
 peacetime, but NATO
 would be handicapped in
 other ways if the north-
 ern province of Finnmark
 were to assume a special
 status.   The Oslo gov-
 ernment, for example,
 has permitted NATO to
 hold military exercises
 in the area.
 There continues to
 be considerable specu-
 lation in Finland and
 elsewhere in Scandinavia regard-
 ing Kekkonen's motives in advanc-
 ing the proposal.  The US Embassy
 in Helsinki believes he was moti-
 vated by foreign policy as well
 as domestic political considera-
 tions.   Kekkonen may have ex-
 pected to gain some credit with
 the Soviet Union by the initia-
 tive, which he advanced along
 with his frequently proposed
 scheme for declaring Northern Eu-
 rope a nuclear-free zone.   Soviet
 propaganda, however, has thus far
 not commented on the proposal,
 perhaps in order to avoid strength-
 ening speculation that it was in-
 spired by Moscow.
 Kekkonen was probably also
 seeking to enhance the prospects
 of his Center Party in next year's
 national elections by reminding
 the voters of the importance of
 electing a government which has
 the confidence and support of the
 Soviet Union.   Faced with the con-
 tinuing decline of the rural popu-
 lation, the agrarian-based Center
 Party has sought to broaden its
 support by turning to the all-im-
 portant area of foreign relations,
 where it claims for itself a spe-
 cial competence and understanding  25X1
 of the USSR by virtue of Kekkonen's
 good relations with the Soviet
 leadership.

 The outcome of the Costa
 Rican national elections of 6
 February 1966 will be extremely
 close in the view of the US Em-
 bassy in San Jose.   At the pres-
 ent time, Daniel Oduber, standard
 bearer of the ruling National
 Liberation Party (PLN) is accorded
 a slight edge for the presidency
 over opposition coalition candi-
 date,Jose Joaquin Trejos.
 Oduber, a shrewd, pragmatic
 politician, is a leader of the
 PLN's sizable liberal wing.   The
 PLN ticket, which appears to be
 moderate and broadly based, was
 fashioned to please conservative,
 wealthy members of the PLN and
 to  nullify opposition attempts
 to link Oduber to Castro and the
 Communists.   Even if Oduber wins,
 the PLN may have only a thin
 majority in the 57-man unicameral
 Legislative Assembly.
 Political neophyte Trejos
 of the opposition National Uni-
 fication Party (UN), a coalition
 of the Republican and National
 Union parties,  is a moderate and
 highly respected university pro-
 fessor.   His candidacy has also
 been endorsed by a third faction,
 the United Republican Action
 Party of ex-President Mario
 Echandi.   The UN ticket covers
 the political spectrum.   Dr.
 Jorge Vega, its candidate for
 the first vice-presidency,  is
 wealthy and ultraconservative,
 while Calvo Sanchez, candidate
 for the second vice-presidency,
 is a member of the Republican
 :reformist wing.   Among the prob-
 lems Trejos has had to face are
 the strong organizational ad-
 -vantage of the PLN, and the
 fear of many of his supporters
 that the Republican Party would
 have "excessive" influence in
 a UN government.   Also it is
 unclear whether the Trejos ticket
 will retain the active support
 of Echandi and his backers now
 that they have failed to get
 the UN to run pro-Echandi legis-
 lative candidates.
 A Trejos victory would
 bring to power a coalition of
 disparate groups.   Their lack of
 a unified approach would impede
 government operations and might
 herald increased nationalism
 In Costa Rican dealings with
 the United States.
 The embassy believes Oduber,
 if elected, would spare no ef-
 fort to make his administration
 a successful one under the
 general framework of the Alliance
 for Progress.   The embassy also
 believes that an Oduber adminis-
 tration, although it might well
 take a somewhat more liberal
 and independent line on some
 :issues, would not depart sub-
 stantially from the pro-US cast
 of the incumbent Orlich govern-
 ment, and that the prospects for
 smooth transition and effective
 government would be better than
 in the case of a Trejos victory.

 Mounting labor unrest could
 provoke a new crisis in the Do-
 minican Republic.   President
 Garcia Godoy's decision to pay
 only part of the traditional
 Christman bonus to public employ-
 ees and his intention to enforce
 a November decree which forbids
 strikes by government employees
 are being put to the test by a
 wave of strikes in public offices.
 Civil servants demanding the pay-
 ment of back wages have joined a
 strike which started with a call
 by two of the country's three la-
 bor federations for walkouts at
 most of the government-owned
 sugar mills.
 The government's firmness
 in dealing with disorders by un-
 employed workers at a US-owned
 banana plantation near Azua has
 become a political campaign is-
 sue.                  In an effort to increase
 waning Dominican Revolutionary
 Party (PRD) strength in the la-
 bor movement, Juan Bosch has pub-
 licly taken the administration
 to task for using troops and ar-
 rests to prevent violence at the
 plantation.   Labor problems at
 the US-owned La Romana sugar
 central could also easily flare
 up as management faces an extrem-
 ist-controlled union in contract
 talks.
 Little remains of the
 vaguely defined political truce
 called for by the OAS peace
 terms.  Campaigning for the June
 1966 elections by the two major
 parties, the FRD and Joaquin
 Balaguer's Reformist Party (FR),
 has earnestly begun.   Bosch took
 to the airwaves on 11 December
 to answer charges by Balaguer
 and others of government  par-
 tiality toward the PRD.                                                                Employ-
 ing the style he so effectively
 used in the 1962 campaign, Bosch
 charged that everything that has
 adversely affected the PRD or
 the "people's" interests is part
 of a plot by reactionary sectors
 to rekindle the civil war. Bosch
 took the opportunity to lump
 such elements as the military
 terrorists, US news media, and
 the US-owned banana company into
 the reactionary category.
 The working relationship be-
 tween Garcia Godoy and military
 leaders has been maintained and
 the President continues to is-
 sue optimistic statements con-
 cerning the integration of rebel
 military personnel into the armed
 forces.  Over 300 former rebels
 reportedly have been paid off
 and have left the 27th of Febru-
 ary camp, according to Garcia
 Godoy.  He told US officials
 that he expects the remaining
 rebels who are eligible will be
 incorporated into the military
 this week--perhaps a too-optimis-

 An explosion on 6 December
 which killed a congressman's
 pretty,  young wife--she was Miss
 Venezuela in 1963--appears to
 have dispelled the government's
 hope that the Venezuelan Commu-
 nist Party (PCV) and its ally,
 the Movement of the Revolution-
 ary Left (MIR), might soon
 abandon violence in favor of
 legitimate political action.
 Congress, in a special
 joint session on 7 December,
 unanimously condemned both the
 PCV and MIR.   President Leoni
 also spoke out against the PCV.
 A subsequent Communist effort
 to shift the blame to uniden-
 tified rightists served only
 to infuriate the military.
 Sharp denials and countercharges
 were issued by spokesmen for
 those officers who feel the gov-
 ernment has not been sufficiently
 vigorous in pursuing terrorists
 and guerrillas of the PCV/MIR
 paramilitary group, the Armed
 Forces of National Liberation
 (FALN).   A secondary public re-
 action thereafter was a ripple
 of rumors that a military coup
 was imminent, but such rumors
 seem to have died down.
 Even before the bombing,
 efforts by PCV moderates to
 create a peace-loving image
 were being thwarted by MIR and
 FALN murders of policemen, na-
 tional guardsmen, and agrarian
 leaders.   A recent editorial
 in La Republica, a daily that
 often acts as the government's
 unofficial mouthpiece, cited
 these and other incidents in
 Irefuting a PCV claim that the
 ,government had rejected Commu-
 l nist overtures for rapproche-
 ment.  Among other things, the
 paper pointed out that the PCV
 had been offered "concrete op-
 portunities" for pacification
 since before the elections of
 December 1963.
 The paper repeated a state-
 ment from President Leoni's
 first message to Congress, in
 January 1964, that if the Com-
 munists would abandon violence
 and give proof of their new
 stand they would open the path
 to rehabilitation of their party.
 La Republica denied Communist
 h-arges of ideological persecu-
 tion, pointing out that the PCV
 is still legal and that captured

 than for political activities.

 At least temporary peace
 appears to be returning to the
 Uruguayan labor scene in the
 wake of a reported agreement
 between the government and both
 state and autonomous agency em-
 ployees.
 The government was forced
 to reimpose emergency security
 measures during the week of 6
 December in order to deal with
 the protracted labor
 unrest.
 Although wages were
 no longer
 at issue, workers had refused
 to accept penalties the govern-
 ment
 imposed on
 those who took
 part
 in strikes
 in October.
 Most
 government
 employees en-
 gaged
 in strikes and slowdowns,
 which
 on 9 December virtually
 paralyzed all but emergency
 services.   Scattered incidents
 of violence and sabotage occurred,
 and police arrested several hun-
 dred striking bank and press em-
 ployees.
 The majority faction of
 the government let it be known
 that it was considering break-
 ing relations with the USSR be-
 cause of alleged Soviet inter-
 ference in the labor crisis.
 The threat to sever relations
 appears to have been intended
 primarily to frighten the Uru-
 guayan Communists and to make
 them halt the labor agitation,
 for which they were in large
 part responsible.   Government
 leaders seemingly had little
 serious intention of breaking
 relations with the Soviets--
 with whom   they have just con-
 eluded a substantial wool sale
 --and were surprised at the in-
 ternational reaction to their
 threat.   The government may now,
 however,  consider limiting the
 activities of bloc diplomats
 and reducing the size of the
 large Soviet Embassy staff in
 Montevideo.
 The maneuver appears to
 have served its purpose,  as
 labor leaders reportedly have
 agreed to accept some pay sanc-
 tions.   The government reduced
 to suspension the penalty of
 dismissal which had been assessed
 against some workers and agreed
 to release jailed trade union-
 ists.   The Communist-influenced
 National Workers'  Convention sus-
 pended its planned 14 December
 general strike.
 Uruguay's labor difficulties
 are far from solved,  however.
 The cost of living has risen
 nearly 60 percent in the first
 eleven months of 1965 and unem-
 ployment is increasing.                                                                        Many
 workers in the private sector
 will probably press for wage
 agreements more favorable than
 the 26- to 30-percent adjustment
 made for the government employees.
 The governmentworkers themselves
 will probably become increasingly
 dissatisfied with their salaries,
 which are frozen until after

 UN FINANCING AND PEACEKEEPING PROBLEMS STILL AT IMPASSE
 No progress has been made
 in resolving the problems of in-
 itiating and financing UN peace-
 keeping operations in the four
 months since the US reluctantly
 agreed to drop further efforts
 to enforce Article 19 against
 delinquent members.   Following
 the failure of the current 20th
 session.of the General Assembly
 to find solutions,  the whole
 problem has been dumped once
 again on the Committee of 33,
 whose mandate has recently been
 extended.
 The UN is increasingly hard
 put to find ways of financing
 the peacekeeping operations it
 has already authorized.   Secre-
 tary General Thant has indicated
 it may be necessary to resort
 to assessments to save the Cy-
 prus operation, especially since
 the Scandinavian countries which
 have provided troops have been
 pressing for reimbursement of
 their expenses.   Contingency
 funds for the two UN missions
 in Kashmir are exhausted and
 Thant is seeking to have them
 financed under the regular budget.
 To overcome the expected Soviet
 and French objections, he may
 resort to the French formula
 whereby the Security Council
 would "invite" the General Assem-
 bly to inscribe the expenses in
 the regular budget.   However,
 the method of financing these op-
 erations may in the end be mod-
 eled after whatever compromise
 is reached for financing the Mid-
 dle East Emergency Force  (UNEF),
 one of the oldest UN operations
 which now is under close review.
 The current assembly's only
 specific move so far toward re-
 solving the precarious financial
 situation is approval of a French
 resolution for a year's study on
 UN expenditures.   Response to
 the UK's lead earlier this year
 in making voluntary contributions
 to alleviate the critical situa-
 tion has been poor.   Moscow and
 Paris,  the principal delinquents,
 have still not made contributions,
 although France may do so in the
 first quarter of 1966.
 Discussion on future peace-
 keeping operations in the as-
 sembly's Special Political Com-
 mittee has focused on the Irish
 proposal to revise the Uniting
 for Peace resolution which allows
 the assembly to take peacekeep-
 ing action when the Security
 Council is paralyzed by a veto.
 Irish Foreign Minister Aiken,
 author of the resolution, main-
 tains that it is necessary to
 reimpose mandatory assessments
 for peacekeeping if the UN is
 to operate at all.   The Soviet
 delegate, however, has maintained
 the traditional Soviet position
 that the proposal is at variance
 with UN Charter provisions giving
 the Security Council jurisdiction
 in peacekeeping.
 This Soviet opposition and
 reservations on the part of
 other countries caused the Irish
 proposal to be referred to the
 Committee of 33.   Past experi-
 ence has shown, however, that
 if the committee is to become
 more than a debating forum it
 will need firm guidelines on how
 to proceed and what should be
 accomplished before the 21st
 assembly.

 SOVIET MILITARY DOCTRINE FOR NIGHT OPERATIONS
 Soviet military doctrine has always emphasized
 surprise as a vital factor for battlefield success.
 To achieve this surprise, the Soviets stress that
 night operations must be conducted with the same
 efficiency and in the same magnitude and tempo  as
 daylight operations.   Soviet military training re-
 flects this by great attention to night exercises,
 and Soviet science equals the US capability to de-
 velop night vision aids.
 Doctrinal Change Since the War
 During World War II, the
 Soviets used darkness and fog
 primarily for troop movements,
 for preparation of large-scale
 daylight attacks,  for construc-
 tion of field fortifications,
 and for supply operations.   Night
 operations usually consisted of
 attacks in up to regimental
 strength, reconnaissance in force,
 and raids.   Tanks were regarded
 as dawn-to-dusk weapons.
 Current Soviet doctrine em-
 phasizes that operations at night
 are to be considered a normal
 phase of combat which provides
 maximum opportunity for achiev-
 ing surprise and reducing losses
 from enemy fire.   Full offensives,
 including tank units, may be
 initiated at night, and an of-
 fensive begun during daylight
 is expected to maintain momentum
 beyond nightfall.
 The Field Service Regula-
 tions of the         rme    orces
 --the    e          e    or    v Sion
 and regimental commanders--has
 a section providing detailed
 guidance for the conduct of night
 offensive operations.   This sec-
 tion states in part:   "Extensive
 use should be made of night con-
 ditions to conduct offensive op-
 erations with decisive aims.   A
 night offensive facilitates the
 delivery of surprise strikes and
 the continuity of combat opera-
 tions.   It also makes counter-
 measures more difficult for the
 enemy....   The success of combat
 operations at night depends on
 thorough planning and on the
 training of troops, and also on
 the skillful handling of night
 vision devices and illumination
 equipment."
 Training for Night Operations
 The Soviets recognize that
 the skills necessary for the ef-
 fective conduct of night opera-
 tions can only be attained by
 constant training.   Soviet units
 are known to conduct realistic
 night training exercises at all
 levels.

 Soviet military publications
 frequently publish articles dis-
 cussing night training and opera-
 tional techniques or praising
 units which have demonstrated
 proficiency.   For example, Mili-
 tary Herald, the major unclassi-
 ie   journal. for combined-arms
 commanders, had an article in its
 November 1965 issue titled "Train-
 ing in Night Firing."  This arti-
 cle praised and described in de-
 tail the training in night firing
 techniques conducted by a motor-
 ized infantry company.
 Night Vision Aids
 Soviet night combat doctrine
 emphasizes the employment of
 illumination and night vision de-
 vices by friendly forces and re-
 stricting enemy use of such equip-
 ment.   The Soviet ground forces
 now are equipped to overcome the
 lack of visibility at night and
 to detect and counter enemy use
 of infrared equipment.  (See photos
 on reverse of page)  .
 Although Soviet forces in
 the field are widely supplied
 with night vision equipment, most
 of it is not much more sophisti-
 cated than that which was avail-
 able to US and German forces at
 the end of World War II.   Never-
 theless,  infrared vision, driv-
 ing, and aiming aids are mounted
 as standard equipment on Soviet
 tanks and some other vehicles.
 Passive infrared detection equip-
 ment has been issued to Soviet
 field forces down to squad leve
 The Soviets also plan ex-
 tensive use of searchlights,  il-
 luminating artillery shells,     and
 signal and identification devices.
 According to the field regulations,
 "Aircraft... are brought in to
 create lighted reference points
 in enemy positions and to illumi-
 nate the most important targets."
 To aid in the concealment of
 Soviet forces,  the regulations
 state:   "In addition to its usual
 tasks, artillery destroys enemy
 radiotechnical  means and night
 vision equipment."
 The Soviets have demonstrated
 a determination to develop more
 sophisticated night vision equip-
 ment for their field forces.   Be-
 ginning with the German equipment
 and scientists captured during
 World Wax II, the Soviets launched
 an intensive developmental pro-
 ;ram that continues to the present.
 While this work is highly classi-
 fied, available information in-
 dicates a capability to develop
 advanced infrared equipment and
 low-level light amplification
 devices for tactical forces which
 is at least equal to that of the
 US.   Current emphasis appears to
 be on the development of less
 vulnerable passive systems which
 do not expose the user to detec-
 tion.   So far as is known,  none
 of these highly sophisticated
 systems has yet been issued to
 troops.

 POPULAR ATTITUDES AND MORALE IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 Until 1958, the Peking regime had the general
 approval of the majority of the Chinese people. Since
 the failure of the "Great Leap Forward" and the eco-
 nomic disasters of the years 1959 through 1961, the
 gap between the revolutionary goals of the leader-
 ship and the individual, materialistic goals of the
 people has widened.   The regime can command compli-
 ance and obedience but it Is unable to arouse the
 population from its political apathy.   The leadership
 would like to recover some measure of the former revo-
 lutionary elan, and has been conducting persistent
 and intense political indoctrination programs for
 this purpose.   At present, these programs appear
 largely ineffective.
 The morale of China's 600
 million peasants is closely tied
 to their current living situation,
 and their attitudes to the poli-
 cies of the regime that directly
 affect them.   The average Chi-
 nese peasant lives a spartan and
 localized life.   He is a member of
 a  commune where he works on col-
 lective farmlands and tills his
 own minuscule private plot. The
 average rural resident eats about
 2,000 calories a day--much more
 than in 1960-61, but still slightly
 less than in a "normal" year such
 as 1957.   About 20 percent of this
 is supplementary food which he has
 grown himself or bought on the
 open market.   He earns very lit-
 tle cash,                       but there is little
 need for money except to buy food
 to supplement his rations.   His
 greatest material need is prob-
 ably for cloth, and he has been
 limited to a cotton cloth ration
 of less than five feet a year
 for the past several years.  His
 well being depends to a large
 degree on the state of the har-
 vest, which has been barely aver-
 age since 1962.
 The failures of the "Great
 Leap Forward" and subsequent re-
 gime concessions to time-honored
 methods and individual enterprise
 have destroyed whatever belief
 the peasant might have had that
 the regime was infallible.    In
 fact, he probably resents its ef-
 forts to spur him on to greater
 political and economic achieve-
 ments from which there is little
 personal gain.   These feelings
 are essentially passive, however,
 and he would probably not do any-
 thing to express his dissatisfac-
 tion as long as he could somehow
 manage to exist.   If he lived
 close enough to Hong Kong or Macao
 and an opportunity to escape arose,
 he would probably take advantage
 of it.   He probably thinks or

 knows little about foreign af-
 fairs, except when he is called
 upon to make greater efforts,
 for example, for the war in Viet-
 nam.  He is probably somewhat
 skeptical of the regime's propa-
 ganda in general, and this skep-
 ticism probably extends to propa-
 ganda about US weaknesses and
 hostile intentions.
 The regime would like to
 overcome peasant apathy and has
 devoted considerable propaganda
 and organizational effort to this
 purpose.   The spring and summer
 of 1965 saw the renewal of Poor
 and Lower Middle Peasant Associa-
 tions, with hints that these or-
 ganizations would have some voice
 in local agricultural programing.
 Composed of the most "progres-
 sive" peasants and separate from
 the commune structure itself,
 these organs could serve as checks
 on the local party cadres as well
 as rallying points for the peas-
 ants.  They appear to be under
 the control of a new central com-
 mittee department called the Po-
 litical Work Department for Ag-
 riculture and Forestry, estab-
 lished in August 1965.
 By Mao Tse-tung 's own a m s--
 sion.  China's 130 million youth
 (aged 15-24) are a source of worry
 to the Peking leaders,  mostly be-
 Page 2
 cause the coming generation lacks
 the revolutionary zeal that brought
 the present leadership to power.
 Even worse, a large part of the
 young people apparently do not
 support the regime.   They were
 prominent in the May 1962 exodus
 of refugees from Kwangtung to
 Hong Kong, and 10,000 of the 11,000
 high school and college students
 who vacationed in Hong Kong in
 the summer of 1962 opted not to
 return to China.   Since then, the
 Communists have held the number
 of exit permits for students to a
 few hundred per summer.
 China's youth are probably
 most dissatisfied because there
 seems to be no future for them
 on the mainland.   Opportunities
 for schooling are extremely lim-
 ited.   In one high school in Pe-
 king, for example, only 20 per-
 cent of the junior high school
 students who wanted to could con-
 tinue their schooling in 1965
 and only about 30 percent of the
 senior high school students who
 so desired could go on to col-
 lege.   These proportions prob-
 ably are much lower in other cit-
 ies.  Peking itself announced
 in April 1963 that 100,000 of the
 170,000 college and university
 graduates of 1962 were required
 to return to rural areas for em-
 ployment.
 For the young person whose
 schooling has been terminated,
 there are few job opportunities.
 The regime has tried to accommo-
 date them by moving many to re-
 mote areas such as Sinkiang or
 enrolling them in "half-work,
 half-study" schools, from which
 a career as a farmer or factory
 worker is the most they can ex-
 pect.   The current stagnation in

 industrial activity precludes
 any extensive recruitment of
 youths by factories.
 Such dim prospects engender
 loss of faith in the regime's
 wisdom and purpose,  as well as
 personal disappointment. Low-
 ered standards of instruction
 and the forced migration to rural
 areas with their more primitive
 educational facilities are crit-
 icized
 Im -
 patience with political indoc-
 trination is widespread.   The re-
 gime's attempted remedies, in-
 cluding a revamping and expansion
 of party-affiliated youth organi-
 zations and increased indoctrina-
 tion, appear to be ineffective.
 There is no evidence either
 of any recent general overt ex-
 pression of dissatisfaction on
 the part of young people, or that
 they could express their dissatis-
 faction without expecting sharp
 reprisals from the government.
 It is unlikely, however, that the
 regime can spur them on to be
 true "revolutionary successors."
 The four million or more
 professional people who make up
 China's academic, artistic, and
 managerial intelligentsia have
 been a prime target of indoctrina-
 tion since 1949, and they prob-
 ably reciprocate the regime's
 distrust of them.   Their stand-
 ing in China has varied from the
 extreme low after the "100 flow-
 ers" movement in 1957 to the rel-
 ative high of the early 1960s
 when the regime openly acknowl-
 edged its need for them and told
 them that their expertise, even
 without "redness," would suffice.
 This policy again began shifting
 in 1964, and recent indications 25X1
 are that political indoctrination
 may again be intensified.   In
 June 1965, China's foremost rocket
 expert, US-trained Chien Hsueh-
 sen  publicly apologized for hav-
 ing belittled politics in the past
 and recommended that scientists
 study Mao's works more conscien-
 tiously.
 These people must find the
 regime's erratic industrial and
 economic policies frustrating.
 They must also resent the time
 "wasted" on political indoctrina-
 tion and labor stints in the coun-
 tryside.   The close party super-
 vision of their work, as well as
 the constant suspicion with which
 they are treated, have also been
 sources of private complaints.
 Since all top Chinese in-
 tellectuals were either trained
 in the West or had teachers
 trained there, they, more than
 any other segment of Chinese so-
 ciety, appreciate the wealth and
 power of the West and are able
 to contrast this with China's
 tremendously backward state.  They
 remain, however,  very much China-
 centered and furthermore tend to
 credit the regime at least with
 re-establishing China as a world
 power.

 Some cadres have become Increasingly corrupt
 and have trekked on a deviate path.... Some
 cadres have lost their great revolutionary, tradi-
 tional spirit....          This has become a very shame-
 ful and serious problem. (Secret directive on **socialist
 education" for cadres,  issued by the party central
 committee. November 1964)
 Medium and lower level party
 cadres are the officials who must
 carry out the regime's policies
 and as such are most often the di-
 rect recipients of blame or praise
 for failure or success from both
 the people and the government.
 Since late 1962, they have been
 receiving particular attention in
 political indoctrination from the
 Chinese leadership.
 Most conspicuous of the re-
 gime's efforts has been the "four
 clearance" phase of the socialist
 education movement, which centers
 on discovering cadres'  errors and
 misdeeds and which is to continue
 until as late as 1972.   Substan-
 tial numbers of infractions by
 local cadres have been found
 (4,000 in one county in Kwang-
 tung), involving embezzlement of
 funds, misuse of official posi-
 tion, promiscuity, and the like.
 There have been several reported
 instances of suicide by miscreant
 cadres,  indicating that at least
 some have reached the breaking
 point.
 The confidence of working-
 level party cadres in the rewards
 of absolute party fidelity has
 been gravely impaired by con-
 tradictory domestic policies of
 the regime as well as by their
 own observation of peasant hard-
 ships.   During periods of eco-
 nomic difficulties such as the
 serious food shortages of the
 winter of 1960-1961, reports were
 received  of  cadres purposely
 overlooking cases of theft of
 food from the fields.   The cadres
 have increasingly tended to dis-
 card the ascetic self-sacrifice
 of earlier days in favor of naked
 opportunism, which the current
 socialist education movement is
 meant to correct.   Indications
 are, however,  that the movement
 is counterproductive, and in fact
 has impaired the morale and ef-
 fectiveness of low-level offi-
 cials.
 The purification campaigns
 so far have been aimed chiefly
 at officials in factories and
 collective farms.   Since mid-
 October, county-level officials
 for the first time have been
 made the target of a "socialist
 education movement."  People's
 Daily has published several-e_7i'i-
 or als criticizing county-level
 leadership for being "out of bal-
 ance" and demanding that it be
 "revolutionized."
 Cadres are probably more
 cynical toward official propa-
 ganda on all subjects than the
 population generally.   They are
 for the most part, however, so
 committed to the regime that
 they would not seriously enter-
 tain any ideas,   or take any ac-
 tions,  significantly at variance
 with the  art  lin

 Party influence permeates
 all levels of the 2.5-million-
 man armed forces.   The senior
 political and military leaders
 are united by ties of comrade-
 ship in a long revolutionary war.
 Political commissars are assigned

 level.   Although the troops are

 1961 in reaction to ration cuts
 and adverse news from home re-
 gions, but the regime moved ef-
 fectively to counter this reac-
 tion by giving soldiers preferen-
 tial treatment while simultan-
 eously tightening discipline and
 party control.   Combat victories
 during the Sino-Indian border
 conflict in 1962 and China's nu-
 clear testing in 1964 and 1965
 also provided a psychological
 lift.   Military defectors are
 rare.
 Out look
 Among the officer corps,
 however, there appear to be per-
 sistent frictions with the party.
 The
 abolition of military ranks on
 1 June 1965 for the announced
 purpose of strengthening "revo-
 lutionary purity" of the People's
 Liberation Army was followed by
 an increase in indoctrination
 aimed at officers above regimental
 level.   These measures could ad-
 versely affect morale.   Many mili-
 tary officers probably believe
 that party interference is exces-
 sive and that the party is paying
 too much attention to Mao's guer-
 rilla war doctrines and not enough
 to problems of modernization.
 The over-all morale and dis-
 cipline within the armed forces
 is probably good, however.   Morale
 sagged in the lean years of 1959-
 gime is relying on to counter
 the negative attitudes and poor
 morale in Chinese society are
 The heavy political indoc-
 trination campaigns that the re-
 unlikely to have the desired ef-
 fect.   So long as the regime in-
 sists on "politics over economics,"
 emphasizes political and police
 controls over material incentives,
 and refuses to allow scope for
 the development of personal in-
 dividual goals for fear that this
 will replace state-oriented goals,
 'there will be popular disaffection.
 And the present leaders of the
 Chinese Communist  regime show
 no indication that they can es-
 cape long enough from their ideo-
 logical strait jacket to effect
 significant changes in their ap-
 proach.
 Under these circumstances,

 amelioration of their harsh
 lives and for a relaxation of

 the insistent pressures for po-
 litical conformity will increase.
 These demands are unlikely in
 the near future to lead to much
 active resistance, for the mili-
 tary and police controls are too
 strong for this.   But apathy,
 work slowdowns, and passive re-
 sistance to the regime's desires
 will result.
 Given the present  leaders'
 ossified views, an ascending
 spiral of counterpressures may
 result.   As popular morale sinks
 and negative attitudes grow,  the
 regime is likely to attempt even
 greater political oppression.
 This will bring in its wake more
 disaffection.   Such a cycle will
 not follow a neat mathematical
 progression:  the current regime
 has shown itself capable of tem-
 porary periods of relaxation when
 the weight of its programs has
 proven too much for the people
 to bear.   The net result over the
 years, however, has been for a
 gradual increase in the -oppres-
 sion.
 While the present regime
 seems unlikely to change even in
 the face of increased public pas-
 sive resistance, a new generation
 of leaders may well adopt a more
 pragmatic view.   This,  in fact,
 is what happened in the Soviet
 Union after Stalin's death. Al-
 though a similar development will
 not necessarily occur in Commu-
 nist China,  Mao Tse-tung himself
 has made it clear on many occa-
 sions that it is this adoption of
 Soviet "revisionism" that he most
 fears in those who are likely to
 reilace the men now in power.
