 Schools Now Open to Young People
 Following the rehabilitation and development of her economy, China's educational and cultural
 work has made unprecedented progress.  At present, there are about 202,000 college students; 3,090,-
 000 students in secondary schools; and 50 million children in primary schools.  These figures greatly
 surpassed the 1946's which were the highest before the liberation.
 All educational institutions now open their gates to workers and peasants, and many short-term
 secondary schools for workers and peasants have been specially established for them throughout the
 country.  Tuition fees and food expenses for all students of universities, technical, normal schools and
 other institutions of higher learning are provided by the Government, while the number of people's
 scholarships for secondary school students has also been  increased.  By these  measures, the broad
 masses of young people of China are now able to enter schools.

 students, over 3,000,000 middle school students and 49,000,000 primary school
 students in the country.  New school buildings are under construction, while
 the number of people's scholarships has increased.  All these measures have
 made it possible for the broad masses of youth to enter school.

 FOREWORD
 In the three and a half years since the birth of New
 China, the Chinese people have achieved historic successes
 on the economic, cultural and other fronts.  The young
 workers of China have contributed a considerable share to
 these accomplishments.  Educated and guided by 'their
 great leader Chairman Mao Tse-tung and the Communist
 Party of China, the youth of China are given every chance
 to devote their creative abilities to building up their great
 motherland.
 Chinese workers, highly conscious of their respon-
 sibilities as the leading class of the society, are performing
 heroic feats of labour and are leading their country towards
 industrialization.  Peasants, tilling their own soil, are
 reaping  bumper     harvests  and  are  advancing  steadily
 towards collective  farming.      Hand  in  hand  with  the
 working people, the intellectuals are doing their best to
 help make their country prosperous.
 In all these endeavours of peaceful construction, there
 have emerged from among the Chinese youth a great
 number  of  model workers,      labour  heroes,  innovators,.
 record-makers-all ardent patriots.      As China has now
 launched its first five-year plan of large-scale economic
 construction, the rank-- of these fine sons and daughters
 of the Chinese people will continue to swell.
 Within the compass of this pamphlet we can give only
 a few of the countless examples of creative energy of the

 the reader a general idea of how China's young people
 are working might and main for the prosperity of their
 country, for a happy future and for peace.

 CHENG HSI-KUN-THE BIRTH AND GROWTH
 OF A LABOUR HERO
 On the morning of August 18, 1949, a line of freight
 cars pulled by Locomotive MK 105 moved south from
 Kirin on the Chinese Changchun Railway.  At noon, it
 pulled up at Chingyuan, 196 kilometres from Shenyang
 (Mukden). Cheng Hsi-kun, the driver, jumped to the
 ground from the footplate, followed by his two mates,
 assistant driver Li Peng-tung and stoker Li Chen-hsi, all
 three of them sturdy young fellows in their middle twenties.
 They gave their engine its regular check-over.  Young
 Li Chen-hsi, with the bit of cotton waste he carried in
 his pocket, gave an extra polish to its shiny new brass
 plate that  proudly proclaimed:  "Youth  Crew."  Only
 four months ago, this engine had been taken, a heap of
 scrap iron in the railway yard, a bare skeleton of eight
 rusty wheels and a fire-box, and repaired by the workers
 at the engineering shops in their spare time to com-
 memorate the                       first  May  Day after the  liberation of
 Northeast China.  On July 1 of the same year-the 28th
 anniversary of the Communist Party of China-Cheng
 Hsi-kun and his three-shift crew of eight other youths-
 six among them Youth League members-took it out on
 its first official run. They treasured it as they treasured

 Cheng   Hsi-kun,   the
 young   engine  driver
 who initiated the move-
 ment  for  bigger                                                                             hau-

 their honour.  Its brass shone like gold. It had never
 once run late or had an accident.
 The inspection over, the three sat down in its shade
 and discussed the run and the engine's performance.  As
 they talked, a middle-aged man hurried towards them
 across the tracks.  He had learned that Locomotive MK
 105 was going to Shenyang.  Pointing to four wagons,
 covered with straw mats, he said that the two in front
 carried melons, and the other two carried his own goods-
 green beans.  They had been loaded the day before for
 Shenyang, but had been left behind, and he was afraid that
 if they didn't get off pretty soon, the melons and beans.
 might rot.... He was wondering whether Locomotive
 MK 105 could take them along.
 Cheng Hsi-kun explained that the4 trains were formed
 up by the despatcher, and that the engine driver couldn't
 decide these things.  But at the same time, he thought
 to himself that the Youth League had always taught him

 the people's railway should serve the people.  If these cars
 of produce really got spoilt, wouldn't that be a loss to the
 people?  He talked things over with his two mates and
 they went to look for the station master.      Just then, a
 telephone call came from the despatcher, notifying Locomo-
 tive MK 105 to take along the two cars of melons.  The
 beans were not mentioned.  After getting the station
 master's consent, Cheng Hsi-kun picked up the phone and
 asked if he could take the beans as well.  The despatcher
 was doubtful:  "Your engine's hauling all it can already-
 Those wagons weigh at least sixty tons !  You couldn't
 haul all that extra load. Yesterday, one engine was given
 only eight tons over its capacity. It had to leave a wagon
 behind !"
 Cheng Hsi-kun said: "There are lots of things we
 couldn't do before that we can do now!"  He pointed out
 that the rated load of each wagon included a sizable safety
 margin, so that an engine could quite safely haul a bigger
 load than the total rated load of its wagons.  There was
 also extra power in the engine that could be exploited.
 He added:  "We three Youth League members just can't
 shut our eyes to the fact that two wagon-loads of beans
 may rot here at this station.  I pledge that we won't be
 a minute late!"  His mates backed him up and the des-
 patcher, though somewhat hesitantly, agreed.
 It was a challenge to all the traditions of Chinese
 railways.
 Locomotive MK 105 whistled shrilly towards the opaque
 sky and started moving south, trailing a cloud of black
 smoke.  In the cab, the three mobilized their energies as
 for a battle.  Cheng Hsi-kun took the controls, planned
 how to attack steep gradients with his extra load, how to
 brake the unaccustomed impetus of the heavy wagons
 behind him when he came to stops.  The stoker fed fuel

 to the hungry furnace; assistant driver Li Peng-tung saw
 to the oil, helped whenever needed.
 The boundless fields of the Northeast plains stretched
 on both sides.  Kaoliang (sorghum) crops nodded with
 the rush of their passage.
 At 4 p.m.-three minutes ahead of scheduled time-
 the train pulled by Locomotive MK 105 reached Shenyang.
 Its achievement was doubly important:  it had hauled a
 bigger load than its rated capacity, and it had beaten the
 scheduled time.  It had broken the conservative traditions
 which had for many years shackled the productivity of
 China's railway workers.  It had started a nation-wide
 movement for capacity loads and bigger haulage.
 Cheng Hsi-kun had worked in the fields like a little
 slave of the landlords from the time he was seven years
 old. In winter, when there was no work in the fields, his
 father kept the family alive by making and selling straw
 mats.  Small as Cheng Hsi-kun was then, he had to carry
 mats weighing 20 or 25 kilogrammes on his shoulders,
 plodding behind his aged father from village to village,
 in knee-deep snow.  When he was sixteen, he went to work
 on the railways.  He found himself, like the other workers,
 treated worse than a slave.  It was the time of puppet
 "Manchukuo" rule.   In punishment for  "disobedience,"
 the Japanese militarists sent him to the barren Black River
 area of north Manchuria to build a railway.
 After V-J Day, he joined the Locomotive Section of
 Suchiatun Station.  But under Kuomintang regime, the
 life of the worker was no less bitter.  His main food was
 still bean-cakes and acorn powder.      Railway time-tables
 meant nothing to Kuomintang soldiers.   To get a lift, they
 often held his train up at gun-point.
 Then came liberation.  The railway workers became
 musters of their lives.  Under the leadership of the All-

 China  Federation  of  Railway  Workers,  a  democratic
 management committee was established by the workers
 and staff members on the line.  Safety measures were
 introduced
 and a labour insurance s
 stem was set u
 ,
 y
 p.
 Cheng Hsi-kun was elected to the democratic management
 committee.   Many of his suggestions concerning finance,
 personnel and technique were adopted.
 During the land reform, his family at Great Stone
 Bridge received over 10 mou of land, and his old father,
 who had suffered life-long poverty, became an activist in
 his village.  Cheng Hsi-kun's wages more than trebled,
 and what with the bonuses he received for economies in
 coal and extra haulage, he was soon able to be reunited
 with his wife in his own home.  In the past, they had
 lived from hand to mouth, but today, he is ordering his
 month's supply of flour and rice by the bagful from the
 ~co-operative, and his wife attends night school.
 In the old days when he reached the end of his run
 on a night shift, he would just throw himself exhausted
 on a lice-laden kang' of the hovel that served as a hostel.
 Today, hostels for train crews along the line are as com-
 fortable as first-class rest homes-clean sheets on spring
 beds, and a pair of white pyjamas folded on the pillow,
 hot and cold running water in the bathrooms twenty-four
 hours a day, and the canteen serving hot meals day and
 night.
 In the neighbourhood of Cheng Hsi-kun's own home,
 the Railway Administration Bureau has built for the
 workers' families a public bathhouse, a primary school, a

 weather. its connection with the stove is blocked off.

 nursery and a club with a hall seating five hundred.  It
 was in that hall that Cheng, for the first time in his life,
 spoke before a big meeting on his experience in breaking
 the haulage record.  After working hours, he likes best
 to rest for a space in the club.  He plays chess, reads
 newspapers there.  In his little front garden, he and his
 wife grow flowers and vegetables.
 Before the liberation, a question had often troubled
 him.   Why in this world were there the rich and powerful
 and the poor who suffered and starved?  Was it fate?
 He had wondered then.  But since July 1949, when he
 joined the New Democratic Youth League, he had found
 the true answer to that question.  He studied the structure
 and history of society.
 The education secretary of the section explained how
 "labour creates the world," and showed him the greatness
 of the power of the working class and the new world of
 justice it would build.  "The value of a man," he said,
 "is judged not by how much he is getting, but by how
 much he is giving to humanity."
 In the past, Cheng Hsi-kun felt, he was like a locomo-
 tive without fuel on a muddy, rail-less road.  The Com-
 munist Party had laid the rails for him and showed him
 the direction.  It had started a vital fire in his heart-the
 revolutionary outlook on life.
 Fighting on the Production Front
 Cheng Hsi-kun had fought conservatism more than
 once after the liberation.  But the most serious battle
 came when he first proposed bigger haulages.

 After he had successfully brought the two car-loads
 of beans to Shenyang, the grateful consignor wrote to the
 Shenyang Workers' Daily to thank the crew of MK 105
 whose public spirit had saved him from serious loss and
 assured a supply of fresh beans to the people of Shenyang.
 This clipping from the press and a laudatory note from
 the Youth League branch were posted on the station notice-
 board.  But some old railroad workers still were not con-
 vinced that his example was worth following.  "To haul
 an extra. sixty tons above the capacity haulage is impos-
 sible, or we have been crazy all the time!" they said.  An
 old engineer said to Cheng with a pat on his shoulder:
 "Young Cheng, don't go too far! I was already driving an

 engine before you were born.  Listen to me, the engine
 won't stand the strain of bigger loads !"
 Such "advice" was like a sudden douche of ice-cold
 water.  He might have faltered.  But the Party and the
 Youth League gave him timely and powerful support.
 "Study hard, consolidate and develop your achievements
 on a scientific basis," said the Secretary of the Party
 branch.
 In December 1950, he was admitted into the Com-
 munist Party.  He tackled difficulties with renewed con-
 fidence.  He learned from the Party how to rely on the
 masses and  achieved  outstanding  new  results.  By
 November 1951, Cheng Hsi-kun had made one hundred
 and seventy-one 500-km.-a-day runs, beating the haulage
 record by more than 85,600 tons.   In April 1952, his
 crew made a 1,216-km.-a-day record run. A locomotive
 pulled at most thirty-five cars in the past. Today, as a
 result of the work done by Cheng and others, two hundred
 cars can be hauled at increased speed, without accidents
 or damage to parts.  The sceptics were overwhelmed by
 these facts.
 All these achievements were inseparable from the
 assistance rendered by Soviet experts.  In the workshops,
 they drew rough diagrams of the curves of slopes or engine
 parts and passed on to Chinese railwaymen all the wealth
 of experience they had accumulated in their socialist land.
 In snow and wind, they stood together with their Chinese
 comrades on the footplate fighting the slippery rails.
 Cheng Hsi-kun paid the keenest attention to every
 detail of his work.  He learnt the value of forestalling the
 need for repairs.    He studied the lie of the rails and
 gradients so that he could adjust his speeds properly to
 take the hills and stop accurately at stations.  He learnt

 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 all the little professional "tricks" that help one get the
 best out of one's engine.
 The rout of the conservatives paved the way for the
 promotion of the movement for new records.  The main-
 tenance department thoroughly studied the possibilities to
 improve the railway lines and reduce the "slow" portions;
 the repair and inspection department offered to teach the
 crews the basic techniques of repair work; the engine
 drivers were determined to master repair and inspection
 work to the level of a fourth-grade technical worker. With
 this collective effort, the whole body of railway workers
 and staff developed the movement with a swing.
 In the autumn of 1950, at the time MacArthur was
 driving the U .S. aggressive forces towards the Yalu River,
 Cheng Hsi-kun and the other eight comrades of the crew
 all volunteered, like millions of young people throughout
 the nation, to go to the Korean front.  In November of
 the same year, though not accepted for service with the
 volunteers in Korea, they were sent to work in Antung.
 They saw the debris in that city on the Chinese-Korean
 border after the outrageous U.S. bombing raids.  They
 heard the roar of guns across the river. They again asked
 to be allowed to cross the river and aid Korea.  The Party
 secretary invited the young men and said:        "To resist
 American aggression and aid Korea does not mean that
 everyone must go to the front.  The 475 million Chinese
 are today at their different posts, all resisting American
 aggression and aiding Korea.  The movement to run faster
 and haul more is in itself an important battle in the
 campaign."
 Since then, they call their engine their "tank."  They
 don't say, "We created a new record today," but "We have
 won a battle."

 Honoured by the People
 In April 1950,  Cheng Hsi-kun and other model
 workers in the Northeast arrived in Harbin for a con-
 ference specially called to enable them to exchange ex-
 periences.
 He has attended several such conferences in Northeast
 China.  He has passed on all he knows to his comrades.
 In all his reports, he has stressed the point that an in-
 dividual's ability is limited: success in achieving new re-
 cords is the concrete collective expression of the patriotic
 productive enthusiasm of the entire body of railway
 workers, a concrete expression of the strength of the Party
 in the building of the people's railways.
 In early September 1951, while going through a
 training course in Tsitsihar, he was informed by the
 Harbin Railway Administration Bureau that he had been
 chosen as a representative to the forthcoming All-China
 Railway Workers' Conference to be held in Peking, where
 he would have to report on the campaign for bigger hauls
 and afterwards would attend the National Committee
 meeting of the People's Political Consultative Conference
 as a specially-invited delegate.
 On October 1, under the azure sky of the capital,
 Cheng Hsi-kun stood among the model workers on a
 stand before the Tien An Men Gate, and viewed the grand
 demonstration of 400,000 people of Peking.  It was an
 unforgettable day.
 After the National Day celebrations, Cheng Hsi-kun
 was making ready to go back to his engine when he
 received a note that Lu Chen-tsao, Vice-Minister of Rail-
 ways, wanted to have a talk with him.  Vice-Minister Lu
 said:  "The Central People's Government has decided to

 introduce your working methods throughout the country
 in 1952 and to carry through a wide-scale movement for
 capacity loadings, bigger hauls and a 500-kilometre run
 a day.  Railways throughout the country will send their
 best drivers to Suchiatun Station to learn from you and
 from the Soviet experts in preparation for the coming
 nation-wide movement for large-scale economic construc-
 tion."                     Cheng Hsi-kun was pleasantly startled, but he was
 worried, too, because he felt he was not equipped to explain
 problems in a theoretical way.  But Vice-Minister Lu
 reassured him: "Don't bother about bookish language.
 Explain things in your own words."
 Cheng Hsi-kun went away filled with what he had
 heard.  The coming industrialization of the country de-
 manded higher technical levels.  It was necessary to get
 the utmost out of every machine.
 Eighty drivers came from various railways and took
 part in the training course.
 The next month, it was Cheng Hsi-kun's turn to go
 to study again.  With over 1,500 of the best sons and
 daughters of New China at the Shenyang Experimental
 Secondary School specially established for combat heroes,
 old revolutionary cadres and model workers, he studied
 the Chinese language, mathematics, history, geography,
 physics and chemistry.  Now at last he had a chance
 of getting that general cultural knowledge of which he had
 been deprived by the old society.
 The classes divided into mutual-aid teams.  They
 challenged each other, drew up emulation contracts and
 concluded patriotic pacts.  They literally helped each
 other beat each other.
 "We started the movement for bigger hauls not for
 show, not for fame, but to serve the people better. The

 purpose of our cultural emulation now is not to get higher
 marks, but to equip ourselves better to fulfil the increasing
 demands of the Motherland and the people," wrote Cheng
 Hsi-kun in an essay.
 Study or work, one principle alone guides the thoughts
 of China's revolutionary working class-service to the
 people.

 MODEL SPINNER HO CHIEN-HSIU
 On an autumn day in 1951, a crowd gathered around
 a spinning machine at the No. 6 State-owned Cotton Mill
 in Tsingtao.  Notebook in hand, the visitors watched
 closely a 17-year-old girl in a checked gingham shirt at
 work. Every two and a half minutes, she would make the
 round of her machines, handling a broom and tending the
 spindles simultaneously with incredible deftness.  After a
 while, the humming machines stopped, followed by an out-
 burst of hand-clapping.  The girl came forward towards
 the spectators with her face flushed, partly from the heat
 of the work and partly from shyness.  Then she began
 explaining her working methods in detail.  Among the
 attentive listeners were technicians and skilled workers,
 some twice or three times her age.  They had come to the
 mill from various parts of the country to study the girl's
 advanced spinning method.
 The girl's name was Ho Chien-hsiu.  She had had
 less than two years' experience in spinning when she gained
 nation-wide fame as an advanced worker. She had come
 to the mill as an apprentice in November 1949, four months
 after the liberation of the coastal city of Tsingtao. After
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 three months' apprenticeship she turned out to be an
 excellent spinner.
 But her first shift as a licensed worker was an un-
 pleasant memory to her.  It was the day after the Spring
 Festival and she was to take up the night shift.  She had
 not slept in the daytime-how could she, or any girl of her
 age, go to sleep when all sorts of festivities were going
 on?  So she could hardly keep her weary eyes open when
 she worked through the wee hours.  Quantities of cotton
 were wasted on the rubber rollers.
 Ho Chien-hsiu regretted very much the excessive waste
 she had caused to public property.
 "This must be the first and last time," she said to
 herself remorsefully, determined to do better from then on.
 At first, she attempted to solve the problem of cotton
 waste within the framework of what was then the standard
 working method at No. 6 State-owned Cotton Mill. There
 seemed to be only one way to do it-keep a sharper eye
 on thread-breaks and waste on the rollers, to spot them
 as quickly as possible.  This meant darting here and there,
 faster and faster.  Ho Chien-hsiu tried it awhile, wore
 herself out, but did not get satisfactory results.
 Seeing that this would not do, the young worker ex-
 perimented boldly to revise the standard method itself.
 Instead of chasing breaks wherever they were noticed, she
 worked out a regular inspection tour of her working area,
 circulating constantly from left to right, looking over her
 spindles, cleaning the rollers with her right hand and
 sweeping the floor with her left.  When she came across
 a broken thread, she connected it, leaning her broom
 against her leg meanwhile.
 Her initiative was soon crowned with success. During
 the May patriotic emulation drive in 1950, Ho Chien-hsiu

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for

 distinguished herself as the best worker in cutting down
 the rate of waste.
 The chief motive force for Ho Chien-hsiu's progress
 was her heightened class-consciousness.  She often recalled
 the grim Kuomintang days when her father, a cart-driver,
 was unable to support a family of eight and she herself
 could not find any job.  It was only after the liberation that
 she could enter the factory, and that life began to get
 better and better for her whole family.  "If it were not
 for the Communist Party, how could we toiling people live

 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 a life of plenty today?  I must show my gratitude to
 Chairman Mao by studying and working hard," she thought
 to herself.
 In November 1950, Ho Chien-hsiu joined the Youth.
 League. She understood her duty as a League member-to
 set an example to her fellow workers in stepping up pro-
 duction.  She also wanted to express her patriotism
 through a contribution to the Resist U.S. Aggression and.
 Aid Korea Campaign. Finally, she realized her wishes. In
 April 1951, she made a national record by reducing cotton
 waste to 0.25 per cent of the total yarn spun (one-sixth
 of the average rate of waste) and by handling double
 the number of spindles.  Her new achievement astonished
 the whole plant.  Some old workers even refused to be-
 lieve it until they saw her do it with their own eyes.
 The success of Ho Chien-hsiu soon attracted the atten-
 tion of the Textile Workers' Trade Union of China, which
 despatched a team to Tsingtao to study and sum up Ho
 Chien-hsiu's experience.  In August of the same year, a
 national textile workers' conference was held in Tsingtao..
 It was decided at this conference to popularize Ho Chien-
 hsiu's working method which, as Chairman Chen Shao-min
 of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Trade
 Union of China pointed out, "would serve to push China's?
 textile industry ahead and be applicable to other branches
 of industry too."  It was calculated that the nation would
 be richer by 44,460 bales of yarn annually if the new
 method were universally adopted, without the installation
 of any new machines or increase of raw material.  Such
 an amount of yarn would suffice to weave 64 million more
 yards of cloth, enough for the use of four million people
 a year.  In value, these savings would equal 161,905 tons
 of grain for food.

 A spinning brigade

 lenges   all   the
 textile workers in
 the city to master
 Ho          Chien-hsiu's
 method
 Ho Chien-hsiu's method has by now brought great
 benefits to her country.  In the first two months of apply-
 ing her method, workers in Shanghai's spinning mills suc-
 ceeded in cutting cotton waste from 1.5 per cent to 0.835
 per cent.  The actual increase of output that resulted was
 944 bales of yarn per month, or 11,328 bales a year.
 Ho Chien-hsiu's method is no individual speed-up
 stunt, no feat of industrial athletics.  It is not based on
 intensified, but on more rational labour.  In other words,
 it is entirely possible for every worker to reduce waste,
 .and to tend more spindles, just as Ho Chien-hsiu has done.
 Among  the  250,000  textile  workers  in  the  country,
 nuf,ierous brigades of the Ho Chien-hsiu type have dis-

 tinguished themselves.  In Shanghai, for example, over 94
 per cent of the spinning workers. have mastered Ho Chien-
 hsiu's method.  Not a few workers have even outstripped
 her.  Another girl in Tsingtao hit a new waste low of
 0.068 per cent, and Yang Lan-hua in Shanghai can now
 tend 1,400 spindles!
 Ho Chien-hsiu's method has revolutionized working
 procedures not only in spinning, but in carding and
 weaving as well.  A new weaving routine, worked out
 collectively by 70 model workers, textile engineers and
 technicians and adopted as standard by the National Con-
 ference on Weaving Methods, is based on combination of
 her experience with that of the best weavers in Tientsin,
 Shanghai and the Northeast.  It raises productivity by at
 least 5 per cent, reduces the intensity of the work and cuts
 down spoilage of cloth.
 The example of Ho Chien-hsiu shows ho x the young
 workers of New China, led by the Communist Party, are
 improving their technical standards.  It shows that, under
 the social system of New Democracy, they are given full
 opportunity to develop their talents and devote their
 creative efforts to China's construction.

 A TECHNICIAN AT ANSHAN
 Going south from Shenyang (Mukden) by train along-
 the Harbin Railway Line (formerly the Chinese Chang-
 chun Railway), one reaches the nationally famous "Steel
 City"-Anshan-in two or three hours.
 Approaching Anshan in the morning one sees, against
 a background of dawn-tinted clouds, a forest of tall
 chimneys sending forth huge columns of smoke, pitch dark
 yet silver-lined, into the sky.  Veiled in the heavy smoke
 are the large blast furnaces, which rear their heads loftily
 above this smoky screen.     Here, unending streams of
 molten iron and steel pour out day and night.
 Scaffoldings of new construction projects can be seen
 everywhere in this industrial city.  For instance, there is
 one being built to house a plant that will manufacture
 high-grade  seamless  steel  tubes.  The  plant  will  be
 equipped  with  the  most  up-to-date  Soviet  machinery,
 operated by half the number of workers employed in the
 old-type plants.  Another project is a giant rolling mill
 which will put out huge quantities of steel products China
 could not make in the past.  Recently, workers completed
 the renovation of a blast furnace which is the first in China

 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 to operate automatically, from the charging with iron ore
 to the pouring of molten pig iron.
 Anshan is not just a producing centre.  It is also a
 big school, where everyone is learning and progressing.
 The hundreds of college graduates coming from all parts
 of the country, too, are gaining knowledge that they could
 have never obtained from textbooks.
 Chou Chuan-tien, Vice-Director of Anshan's Iron
 Smelting Plant, came here in 1949 as a technician on pro-
 bation.  In the more than three years since then, he has
 seen furnaces erected out of the ruins left behind by the
 Kuomintang reactionaries, damaged machines repaired and
 set in motion, and a huge quantity of molten iron tapped
 every day to meet the needs of the nation.  Coming fresh
 from college, Chou felt that he had to learn everything
 anew.
 The newly-installed au-
 tomatic blast furnace at
 Anshan Iron and Steel
 Works

 ICIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 The first thing he learned was that the workers, the
 worthy masters of the plant, were imbued with the most
 selfless spirit.
 One early morning, the smelters were about to be
 relieved by the next shift.  Suddenly, an accident occurred
 in the furnace.  Red-hot liquid burst through an opening
 and began to spread over the floor.   The fiery flood
 destroyed or swept away all that lay in its path.  Chou
 Chuan-tien and other young technicians stood awed and
 motionless, completely at a loss.  But the smelters, though
 quite tired after the night's work, wasted no time and,
 putting their work clothes they had just taken off on again,
 they dashed into the heavy smoke and fire to repair the
 furnace despite the solidifying liquid which scorched their
 clothes, shoes and hair.  Now and then they came out to
 a cooler place, sprinkled their bodies with water, only to
 rush back to their work.   In two hours' time, they had
 the furnace restored to production.
 Such heroism on the part of the workers was an
 invaluable lesson to the young technicians.  Chou Chuan-
 tien, for one, realized all the more the important role
 played by the workers in the build-up of the country.
 But brave and energetic as the workers were, they
 were  not  advanced  technically.  In  the   past,  skilled
 workers and administrative personnel had been mainly
 Japanese who were strictly forbidden by their authorities
 to impart technical knowledge or experience to Chinese
 workers.
 Chou Chuan-tien knew what big things the workers
 could do once they had mastered technique.  So he made
 up his mind to help them all he could in this matter.
 He was soon given the chance.  He was asked to help
 Li Feng-en, an old furnaceman, to become a technician.
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 "Is this possible?"  Some people were doubtful.  "In
 the old days, if you wanted to become a technician, you
 had to work as a signalman for seven or eight years after
 graduating from secondary school, and then as a brigade
 leader for nearly ten more.  And Li Feng-en has had
 only one and a half years' schooling before liberation!"
 they said.
 It is indeed very difficult for an ordinary worker to
 master  the  complex  production  processes  of  a  blast
 furnace.  But both Chou Chuan-tien and Li Feng-en had
 the will to overcome any hardships.
 The two had not known each other before, but now
 they became fast friends.  During working or recess
 hours, at the furnace or outside the works, in daytime or
 in the evenings, they were always seen studying together.
 Every day Chou gave his student and friend a lesson,
 checked the work he had done, and explained tirelessly
 whatever Li Feng-en was not clear about.  Li Feng-en
 displayed great enthusiasm for his studies, just as he did
 for his work.  There were times, however, when difficul-
 ties made him downhearted.  In such cases, Chou would
 maintain that it was his method of teaching that was to
 blame.  Finally, he drew up a compact with Li, under
 which he pledged to teach well and Li, in turn, pledged to
 study well.
 Li had rich practical experience, and this was a great
 help to him in his development.  After three months of
 intensive study, he was allowed to work on the blast
 furnace as an apprentice to Chou Chuan-tien.  But before
 he did anything, he always explained to Chou what he
 was going to do, and went ahead only if the latter said
 "correct !"  If he made a mistake, Chou corrected it then
 and there.   By the fifth month, almost all the technical
 work was placed on Li's shoulders.

 Anshan Iron and Steel Plant
 Thus, through the joint efforts of the teacher and
 apprentice, a thing formerly considered impossible had
 been achieved.  At the end of the sixth month, Li started
 to work as a full-fledged technician.  Moreover, it later
 turned out that he worked even better than many of the
 college graduates, and that the output of his crew was of
 the best quality.
 The workers' enthusiasm for their work and for
 knowledge was a great inspiration to Chou Chuan-tien,
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 who began to look upon his own work in the same way
 the workers did on theirs.
 For some time Chou had been pondering over the
 much-debated question as to whether it was possible for
 .Anshan to produce low-silicon pig iron from sintered ore,
 -instead of producing high-silicon pig iron from briquetted
 ore as it had been doing for years.
 The use of sintered ore lowers considerably the cost
 ,of production, and makes it possible to produce more
 .metal.  The  Soviet  experts  had  once  affirmed  that
 Anshan's development would depend on sintered ore, but
 had met with no immediate response from some people
 whose argument was that long years of experiments
 during the Japanese occupation had shown that sintered
 ,ore was not fit for smelting. Preliminary though not ex-
 haustive  tests  after the  liberation,  too,  proved  these
 claims.
 So it was taken for granted that any further attempt
 to use sintered ore would be useless.  But Chou Chuan-
 tien thought otherwise. Knowing how much the successful
 employment  of  sintered ore  would    help  the future
 development of Anshan, he insisted on a new test.
 First of all, Chou Chuan-tien led his crew to study
 the causes of the failures in the previous experiments, and
 on this basis drew up a plan which everyone pledged to
 follow strictly throughout the new test.
 As was expected, the experiment was fraught with
 difficulties.  For a long time, the solution in the furnace
 was of a poor quality, and no tapping could be done.
 Chou Chuan-tien spent many a sleepless night figuring out
 the problem.  Then one night as he was lying wide-awake
 in bed, he called to mind the conversation a Soviet expert
 had had with his crew at the furnace.  Watching the

 progress of smelting, the Soviet friend, pointing to the
 slag, said, "Too much limestone.  Must have caused you
 trouble, hasn't it?"  The Soviet expert's opinion was soon
 forgotten by everybody, for at that time the use of slag
 of high limestone content had been considered a "success--
 f ul experience."
 Early the next morning
 Chou Chuan-tien hurried to
 ,
 the works to tell his crew what he had remembered, and
 suggested to try out the Soviet idea.  As there was no
 other solution, they all agreed.
 The new process was put to the test.  Morning and
 evening, Chou Chuan-tien stayed at the plant, checking the
 work of the smelters and seeking solutions for the knotty
 problems that came up one after another.     The bell
 announcing the changes of shifts had lost its significance
 for the workers, who would not leave if things were not,
 in good order.
 Three months  passed-months  of tension and  of
 triumph.  The process was carried through.  The tradi-
 tion which had developed at the works and in people's,
 minds in the course of many years was smashed. The
 experiment was crowned with success!  Sintered ore could
 now be used to produce low-silicon pig iron which could
 be fed directly into open-hearth furnaces without passing
 through the active mixers.  As a result, basic iron account-
 ed for 90 per cent of the pig iron output in Anshan last.
 year, compared with only 25 per cent in 1950.
 Because  of  his  outstanding  achievements,  Chou
 Chuan-tien was promoted to vice-director of Anshan's Iron
 Smelting Plant.   He is proud of the task assigned to him
 by the people, arduous though it be.  Reviewing the past
 and looking forward to the future, he pledges, under the
 leadership of the Communist Party, to rely still more on

 KU FA-MING AND HIS COAL SHAFT
 In a coalfield in Liaotung Province, Northeast China,
 two head frames tower over an ensemble of wooden flats.
 This is the construction site of two new shafts.  Day and
 night, lifts are heard rumbling up and down the gaping
 pits; and carloads of rock, brick and machinery are seen
 racing back and forth along narrow-gauge railway tracks.
 Everywhere one hears workers talk about the future of
 their coal-pits:
 "In a few years the pit will produce thousands of
 tons of coal a day."
 "The output will equal that of the four mines of our
 .colliery put together."
 "Just think how many other new pits are now being
 built elsewhere in the country!"
 Only two and a half years ago, the present construc-
 tion site was a desolate expanse of grassland.  In October
 1950, there came a group of 120 youths, just graduated
 from a short-term course especially established by the
 colliery to train shaft builders.  Immediately on their
 arrival they set to work and were later joined by many
 other workers.  For them this work was completely new.

 They had to grope for experience and deal with a lot of
 obstacles.  But neither the torrents of water from the
 walls in the shaft nor dust from pulverized rock and
 smoke from explosions could dampen their enthusiasm.
 After half a year, the shafts had been dug 70 metres
 deep.  But the young workers were not satisfied.  Accord-
 ing to the original plan, it would take nine years to build
 the shafts and main haulages, and they were impatient to
 have the job done faster.
 "We can't wait that long," 21-year-old Ku Fa-ming
 thought worriedly.  "Our factories and furnaces are asking
 for more and more coal."
 Ku's worries were short-lived.  In March 1951, the
 Soviet "parallel working method" was introduced into the

 colliery.  According  to  this  method,  the  sinking  and
 lining of shafts can be done simultaneously.  In this way,
 the period of building the two shafts would be cut from
 :four years to two.
 "It's a good idea," the workers agreed enthusiastically.
 But when they tried it, they encountered a knotty prob-
 lem: lining could be clone much faster than sinking.  The
 trouble lay with rock cuuting.  The workers were called
 upon to improve their drills.
 After two months of trying out various methods, Ku
 Fa-ming succeeded in boring one-metre-deep holes with
 his improved drill.  But even this he considered unsatis-
 factory, so on the third day of his experiment he tried to
 bore deeper into the rock.
 The drill sank one metre deep, then 1.2 m., 1.5 m....
 At this point, Ku brought the whole weight of his body
 to bear on the jackhammer, which shook violently in his
 hands.  With bated breath, he stared at the hole in the
 making, from which the pulverized rock came flying.
 1.6 m., 1.7 m., 1.8 m.-then a hissing sound.  The
 drill jammed and stopped turning.  Big beads of perspira-
 tion stood on Ku's forehead.                     Ku's assistant came up
 with a log and began to help him pull out the drill, but
 failed.
 "Don't worry," Ku said smilingly to his companion.
 "This is only the beginning.  Human will is stronger than
 ,iron and rock."
 That day, the drilling brigade worked late into the
 night and cut about 130 holes.  But of these, fifty could
 ?          not be used to hold explosives, since each had a drill stuck
 in it.
 In one of the rooms of the workers' living quarters, a
 light often burnt into the small hours of the morning.

 One could see Ku Fa-ming sitting at the table, bending
 thoughtfully over a drill, while his wife was sleeping.  On
 evenings  when  she  was  out,  the  Communist        Party
 organizer and the team leader would be there too, turning
 the drill over and looking through the air passage in it
 against the light, then engaging in eager discussion.
 It was a sultry Saturday night.  Ku Fa-ming was
 making spring coils with a piece of wire wound around
 his bruised  forefinger.  At  midnight,  his  wife  was
 awakened by a rapturous outcry.
 "Wonderful!" exclaimed Ku Fa-ming, pacing up and
 down the room in great excitement. "This will certainly
 do the trick. Just put this in the bit and see if pulverized
 rock will fill up the air passage again !"
 He did not get a wink of sleep that night.  With the
 first streak of dawn, he got up and dashed to the con-
 struction site.
 A group of workers gathered around Ku, watching
 admiringly his jackhammer in operation.  The drill sank
 quickly into the rock to a depth of 2.4 metres and came
 out without a hitch.  The workers applauded enthusias-
 tically.  Some hugged Ku, others snatched the spring coils
 and rushed away, shouting:  "Hurray, the problem is
 solved! Let's try it, too."
 Ku Fa-ming was invited by the trade union to report
 on how he had improved his tool.  His method was then
 applied throughout the colliery.
 He was elected leader of
 a drilling brigade.
 Good results followed immediately, sharply raising
 the efficiency of the rock-cutting work.  While formerly
 it took more than sixteen hours to bore eighty holes and
 to fill them with explosives, the time now required for

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 the same amount of work was reduced to three and
 sometimes even to two hours.  Ku Fa-ming's drilling
 record rose to 4.7 metres.  In comparison with the first
 quarter of 1951, efficiency in excavation work during the
 corresponding period of 1952 rose by 232 per cent for one
 shaft and 269 per cent for the other.  This enabled the
 workers to apply the Soviet "parallel working method"
 and to extend the depth of a shaft 57 metres per month.
 The two shafts were originally scheduled to be com-
 pleted in October 1954.  But thanks to the advanced
 Soviet method and to Ku Fa-ming's initiative, they were
 completed in August 1952!
 Ku has since achieved further successes, after going
 to work at another colliery in Northeast China.  The
 application of his drilling method, the good work of his
 team and the assistance given by Soviet experts have
 enabled him to set a new national record-a monthly pro-
 gress of 75 metres in the sinking of a shaft.
 What is behind Ku Fa-ming's success?  To answer
 this question, it is necessary to know the young worker's
 life-story.
 Ku was born in a peasant family in Hopei Province.
 At the age of thirteen, he and his father were sent by
 the Japanese invaders to the Northeast (Manchuria) as
 coolies and forced to haul coal in a colliery then managed
 by the Japanese imperialists.  On the very first day, the
 boy collapsed after many hours' hard work in the pit and
 ?           was carried out by an old miner.
 "I won't go down to that hell any more," Ku Fa-ming
 pleaded with his father.  But the following day he had
 to return to work, or else go hungry since his father's
 meagre wages could not feed two mouths.  From then on,
 Ku's  life  became  one  of  suffering and  humiliation.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 Liberation put an end to this life of misery.  The cruel
 foremen were dismissed.  Under the care of the Com-
 munist Party, Ku Fa-ming, like all other workers, stood
 up and became master of his own destiny.
 Knowing that he was working for the people-for
 himself-Ku Fa-ming adopted a new attitude towards
 labour.  By learning hard from the older workers and
 developing his own creative power, Ku and his fellow
 workers became skilled in the technique of shaft sinking in
 less than  two years.  Formerly he  cut rock  with  a
 primitive hammer and chisel. Now he can handle modern
 machinery.
 With the increase of production, the workers' living
 conditions have improved. While he could barely keep
 himself going in pre-liberation days, Ku's wages now
 exceed 1,600,000 yuani a month.  He and his wife need
 only one-eighth of his income for their monthly food
 expenses.  With the balance, Ku Fa-ming has bought some
 nice furniture, a bicycle, a wrist watch and clothes-all
 within a few months.  And there is still a large sum left
 over, which he deposits in the People's Bank.
 After his shift, Ku Fa-ming and his fellow workers
 go to the bath-house and then to the medical centre for
 sun-ray treatment.  He spends half an hour daily playing
 basket-ball which has become his favourite game.  He also
 attends a spare-time school and can now read newspapers
 and write short articles.
 In August 1952, Ku Fa-ming had a fifteen-day paid
 leave at the sanatorium in Mutankiang, where he gained
 five kilogrammes in weight.
 Ku's success has not made him dizzy.  He often says:
 "I feel I've done very little for my people.  And there's
 so much to be done.  I'll double my efforts and do my
 little bit to help industrialize China."

 THE GIRL AT THE SWITCHBOARD
 The day shift had just begun at the Long Distance
 Telephone Exchange of the Tientsin Tele-communications
 Office.  As usual, 22-year-old Kuo Hsiu-yun was at the
 switchboard right on time.  She put on her earphones and
 began to operate the keys with her left hand even before
 she had time to sit down.  The nimble motions of her
 fingers reminded one of a skilled pianist.  There are quite
 a few things an  operator has to attend to:  calling,
 listening, operating the dial and the keys, connecting and
 disconnecting the circuits .... But to Kuo Hsiu-yun doing
 all this presented no difficulty.  As though magically, the
 thick files of tickets on her board were quickly dis-
 appearing, while she kept herself well at ease all through
 her work.  Whereas it took an ordinary operator on the
 average 237 seconds to connect a call, Kuo Hsiu-yun did
 it in only 81.78 seconds.
 Kuo Hsiu-yun has been working at this exchange since
 1945, when she was 1.5 years old.  In the days of reac-
 tionary rule, she was looked upon as something of a robot,
 a part of the machine.  Day in and day out she repeated
 the same mechanical movements at the switchboard and
 considered her work dry and dull.  In fact, constantly

 humiliated and threatened with dismissal, the girl had
 even begun to loathe her job.  Moreover, meagre wages
 coupled with soaring prices made even a mere subsistence
 difficult. _
 After liberation, Kuo Hsiu-yun began to notice a new
 world about her.  The gangmasters who had once tyran-
 nized the workers disappeared.                    The new foremen, elected
 from among the workers themselves, showed vital concern
 for the interests of the workers.  Whenever a problem
 arose, whether of administrative or technical nature, the
 workers were always asked to speak out their opinion.
 Prices became stable, and the workers' wages were con-
 stantly on the increase.  For the first time, Kuo Hsiu-yun
 tasted the joy of living, and with it the joy of working.
 In the N inter of 1949, Kuo Hsiu-yun was given a
 chance to attend a short-term training course, where she
 acquired fundamental knowledge relating to the history of
 social development and Chinese revolution.  She came to
 appreciate the meaning of labour and the noble responsibili-

 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 ties of the working class towards the society.  It was not
 true, she realized, that the work of a telephone operator
 held no future, as she had always believed.     Work that
 served the people was always valued highly by the people.
 As never before, Kuo Hsiu-yun put her heart into her
 work.  But at that time she still could not see any possibili-
 ties of going any farther than just connecting and discol.-
 necting telephone circuits in the same old way.                      "If you're
 to create or invent anything," she thought, "you've got to
 have lots of theoretical knowledge.  For an ignorant person
 like me, I don't think there's any sense in dreaming of such
 things."
 Facts, however, gradually changed her ideas.  After
 the liberation, countless numbers of model workers emerg-
 ed from among the ranks of the ordinary working- people,
 people who differed little from her either in age, intelligence
 or nature of the work they were doing.  What really mat-
 tered, she found, was that these model workers, spurred
 by patriotism, had a will to conquer difficulties, to exploit
 every and all ways and means to produce more for the
 nation.  So she decided that she could improve her work
 also if she only tried.
 One day, a man asked to be connected with a leading
 cadre of a certain government office in Peking.  Kuo Hsiu-
 yun kept trying for four days, but failed owing to some
 trouble with the latter's telephone.  Filled with anxiety,
 the applicant pleaded:
 "Comrade operator, mine's really a very urgent
 business call, but I'm too busy here to go to Peking per-
 sonally. Can't you find a way out?"
 Formerly, there was nothing unusual in that a call
 could not be put through for several days.  But now things
 were different from what they had been.     Kuo Hsiu-yun
 thought of the leading cadres of government organs who

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 toiled day and night for the good of the people, of the
 serious effects that might be caused by failure to keep them
 informed in time.  Urged by a strong feeling of respon-
 sibility, she racked her brains for a way out.  At last, she
 succeeded in reaching the person called through another
 telephone at his office.  The party calling up Peking could
 not thank her enough for her good service.
 For a long time afterwards, Kuo Hsiu-yun kept re-
 flecting on this incident.  She realized more clearly than
 ever before that she was doing something really very im-
 portant, something to be proud of.  For years, her ac-
 cordion had been her only joy in life.  But now she was
 just as happy with her old, once thoroughly disliked com-
 panion-the switchboard.
 In 1950, she was transferred to another position, re-
 sponsible for passing and receiving calls to and from
 Shanghai.  Traffic was much heavier here, and often more
 tickets piled up than could be disposed of.  Kuo Hsiu-yun
 was greatly disturbed by this situation.     At the end of
 each day, there always remained a few calls that had not
 been put through.  As she cancelled or postponed these
 calls to a later date, the anxious faces of the callers would
 float before her eyes.  She tried to work faster, but only
 made more mistakes.     Once she was even criticized by an
 operator at the other end for her inaccuracy in timing con-
 versations.
 The cause of the error, she later found out, lay in the
 fact that there was no proper system worked out of timing
 conversations.  So she began to pay particular attention
 to this matter.  Every time after a call had been put
 through, she would keep monitoring over the line in order
 to calculate more accurately the time elapsed.  This she
 managed quite well, but soon she encountered new difficul-
 ties.

 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 Kuo Hsiu-yun was in charge of four circuits.  Impor-
 tant as monitoring over these circuits was, it was after all
 but a part of an operator's work.  For instance, while
 monitoring over one of the circuits, she could hardly at the
 same time devote her attention to w-~-orking on another
 circuit, such as putting through a long-distance call. She
 often felt lost, especially when signal lamps flashed angrily,
 demanding to be quickly attended to. "If I could only at-
 tend to two circuits at a time!" she was wrapped up with.
 anxiety.
 After many a sleepless night, Kuo Hsiu-yun recalled
 an incident.
 It had happened some time ago. She was holding the
 key at the talking position to speak with a long-distance
 operator on the other side, when someone by her side
 suddenly asked her a question.  Turning about to answer,
 Kuo Hsiu-yun operated another key to the monitoring posi-
 tion, meaning to cut off the connection with the distant
 terminal office. Strangely enough, however, she could still
 hear the voice of the other operator.  This surprised her
 but she did not mind it very much then.
 Moved by a desire to improve her work, she now began
 to ponder over the matter.  "Doesn't this shoe- that it is
 possible to do two different things simultaneously over two
 circuits?" she asked herself.
 Her idea turned out to be practicable.  With one key
 in the monitoring position and another in the speaking
 position, she found that she could put long-distance calls
 on one circuit and simultaneously monitor over another.
 Similarly, she saw that she could do other things while
 checking on the circuits by turn.  Thus she got along with
 her work with far greater ease than before.
 But Kuo Hsiu-yun was not satisfied with what she had
 achieved.  She was now considering another problem: how
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 to make the best use of the limited number of circuits in
 order to meet the demands of the growing traffic.
 To achieve this, she decided to reduce the time needed
 to connect a call.  Before putting a call through, she would
 first notify the operator on the other side of the calls com-
 ing after, so that after the connection had been completed,
 the latter, making use of the time when the conversation
 was going on, might get the next call through.  Kuo Hsiu-
 yun then kept monitoring, and when she saw that the con-
 versation was drawing to a close, she would make arrange-
 ments for the next call.  In this way, calls were always
 promptly put through and followed one another without
 interruption.  The circuits were no longer wastefully
 engaged by the operators, but were available to long-
 ,distance callers almost all the time-52 minutes out of
 every hour when three circuits were in operation!
 Kuo Hsiu-yun is against everything that impedes the
 progress of work.  She opposes operators who pay less
 .attention  to  inward  calls.   These  people  care  only
 for the narrow interests of their own office, since in the
 cases of inward calls, the charges are collected by the other
 side.    Their reluctance to receive assignments, she con-
 siders, is a stumbling block to smooth tele-communications
 .service.
 Kuo Hsiu-yun holds that in the interests of the sub-
 scribers, the operators of both terminals should co-operate
 closely with each other.  She always tries her best not to
 inconvenience the operator on the other side.  Every time
 a call is over, she first turns the splitting key to the neutral
 position and contacts the other operator, and only then turns
 to the work left behind by the finished call.  As a result,
 the operator on the other side seldom finds any difficulties
 in passing calls to her.
 The whole nation followed Kuo Hsiu-yun's successes
 with keen attention.  Her working methods have been sum-

 marized after three months of systematic study by the
 Ministry of Posts  and  Tele-communications  and  the
 National Committee of the Chinese Postal, Telegraph and
 Telephone Workers' Trade Union.  Steps are being taken
 to apply her working methods to twenty telecommunica-
 tions offices in the major cities of the country. It has been
 estimated that the adoption of Kuo Hsiu-yun's working
 methods by a long-distance telephone circuit will enhance
 its efficiency by 22.62 per cent, and consequently, if her
 working methods are applied on all the trunk lines of the
 country, the effect produced will be equivalent to that of
 a 22.62 per cent increase in the equipment of these lines.
 In other words, it will mean a saving of 387,300 million
 Yuan in the state's expenditure for capital construction.
 Kuo Hsiu-yun's brilliant achievements have won her
 the title of Model Worker, apart from bonuses.  In October
 1952, she was admitted into the New Democratic Youth
 League.  Later, her fellow workers elected her member of
 the Administrative Committee of the Tientsin Telecom-
 munications Office as well as chief of the Women Workers'
 Department of the Trade Union Council.

 TO BUILD MORE QUICKLY
 In June 1950, a team of 21 masons headed by Su
 Chang-yu were working on a building site in Harbin,
 Northeast China.  They had been assigned to construct
 seven houses in a couple of months, involving the laying of
 two and a half million bricks.  This was a tough job to
 tackle, since only 14 of the team members were skilled
 workers who could at most lay 1,200 bricks a day, while the
 seven apprentices did not know the work at all.  Other
 teams also lacked skilled labour.  Thus, the construction
 company was confronted with the weighty problem of rais-
 ing the workers' productivity and training apprentices to
 become skilled workers in the shortest possible time.
 One day, Su Chang-yu attended a lecture on the Soviet
 sectional brick-laying methcd.  He had but a vague idea of
 what the lecturer was saying.   But there was one point
 which made a deep impression on him, namely, that a team
 could lay more bricks if that part of work which required
 less skill was done by the apprentices.  When he came
 back from the lecture, Su Chang-yu told his fellow workers
 with great excitement about the new method.  But many
 of them did not want to have anything to do with it.
 "Been a mason for twenty years but never heard of
 such a thing," said Wang Tsing-shan, an old-timer. "Section

 or no section, bricks are just bricks and you can't make
 them walk up the wall anyhow."
 "You young fellows are really hot-headed," another
 old worker chimed in, "always want to do the impossible."
 Su Chang-yu wanted to argue with them, but his
 words were cut short by the long whistle which announced
 the end of the shift.
 He was lost in deep thought on his way home, thinking
 not only of the new method, but also of his past.  He
 recalled the ominous voice of the landlord whom he had
 served as a swineherd; the grin of the Japanese foreman
 who hurled him down from a scaffolding, letting him lie
 unconscious for two hours; the tears of his family when
 they learned  that he had lost his job after V-J Day; his
 fruitless  pleadings  with  a  Kuomintang  soldier  who
 snatched away his axe and pole with which he had been
 cutting some wood, and rewarding him with a thrashing

 into the bargain; his narrow escape from conscription
 by a. Kuomintang gang; and at last the radical change of
 his life after the liberation-a mason again at Penki, then
 under reconstruction, for the first time with enough to
 eat and wear and enjoying human rights.  He recalled
 his promotion to team leader, his election into the man-
 agement committee of the engineering group, the call on
 the workers  to  increase  production  by  the  People's
 Government, and the Party organizer's words that this
 call must be answered with a courageous struggle against
 conservatism.  But now some workers didn't want to
 accept his proposal.
 That evening, Su Chang-yu was sitting at the table
 from which the supper dishes had not been cleared away
 although it was long after.  He was moving bowls, spoons
 and chopsticks here and there, as a boy does blocks.
 Early next morning, he and his apprentice Kao Chen
 put their heads together and settled down to an experi-
 ment at 6:30.  Instead of working in the customary way,
 Su only undertook to put up the guiding string and lay
 the bricks, leaving the other operations for Kao to do.
 At 10 a.m., the time for attending the literacy class, they
 stopped and counted the bricks they had laid.  3,700 in
 all, a number far exceeding the set quota!
 Wang Tsing-shan, who had come up to observe the
 result, looked at the long, trim wall with blinking eyes
 and mumbled in an undertone:  "Not so bad, eh?"
 This success was, of course, but the first kick against
 the conventional method of brick-laying.  In the follow-
 ing days, Su Chang-yu kept on with his experiments, and
 finally effected a more thorough division of labour among
 his   team.  Every  brick-laying group  contained  four
 members : one skilled worker each laying the exterior and
 another interior bricks, one apprentice laying the bricks

 in the middle and the inner bricks and filling in the mortar,
 and another apprentice passing on the materials.
 Good results were immediately cbtained. Productivity
 rose first 50 per cent and later 128 per cent over and
 above the set quota, and with less intensity of labour too!
 Nor N vas this all.  With bricks stuck fast together with
 more mortar, the walls erected stood as solidly as rocks.
 At the same time, the shortage of skilled labour in the
 building industry was thereby greatly relieved.  Working
 side by side with his master, an apprentice could now
 learn his trade more quickly and be trained into a skilled
 worker in three months' time, instead of three years as
 was formerly the case.  Through higher productivity, the
 building workers could also earn more on a piece-work
 basis.
 Su Chang-yu's method was discussed by the trade
 union, and recommended to other building workers first in
 Harbin, then elsewhere in the country.  It was further
 improved upon and developed by other advanced builders.
 What is more, it gave rise to a series of rationalizations
 in carpentry, white-washing and other branches of con-
 struction.
 On April 18, 1952, on a building site in Peking
 several teams of brick-layers and carpenters were giving
 a technical demonstration before 500 spectators among
 whom  were  workers,  technicians,  architects,  trade
 unionists, as well as representatives of the building
 industry of Harbin, Shenyang (Mukden), Tientsin, etc.
 This demonstration might well be described as a
 drama in six scenes, each showing the rapid development
 in New China's building techniques during the past few
 years.
 In the first scene, four skilled workers and four
 apprentices laid bricks in the old way.  They moved up

 and down the scaffolding, now bending over the wall, then
 straightening up again.  In the end, they registered a
 record of 2 bricks per minute per man, plus an aching
 back each and a lot of mortar wasted on the ground. This
 was followed by a demonstration of Su Chang-yu's new
 method, which marked a definite break with the old one.
 The team worked with ease and co-ordination.  Its record
 was 4 bricks per minute per man and evoked a prolonged
 ovation among the spectators.  Then a third team from
 Tientsin came upon the scene.  With the help of a mortar-
 spreader devised by the young team leader Fu Hung-ping
 and working in a way slightly different from that of the
 second team, the masons could lay six bricks per minute
 per man.  The fourth and fifth teams displayed what they
 could do with the mortar-spreader after it was twice
 innovated. Their records were 7 and 9 bricks !
 The last scene showed Hsieh Wan-fu's famous method
 in carpentry.  Inspired by Su Chang-yu's example, Hsieh
 Wan-fu had also effected a new division of labour among
 his team and raised its productivity 232 per cent.  The
 performance was taken up by Chang Shih-chen's team.
 Chang himself had invented a marking machine, with
 which 11 carpenters could make a door-frame of 2.4 metres
 by 80 centimetres in one minute and 18 seconds !
 What do all these performances signify?  The answer
 may be provided by the following facts and figures :
 According to preliminary statistics compiled early in
 1952, if all these advanced experiences in building-
 worked out under the influence of Su Chang-yu's initiative
 -are adopted by 500,000 construction workers alone, the
 manpower saved in a single year will amount to 1,000
 million standard work hours!
 At present, these advanced experiences are being
 extended to all parts of the country through technical

 demonstrations, film shows and other means of publicity.
 By the end of last year 200,000 workers in 8,000 building
 teams were employing these new methods.  In Tientsin,
 for example, a team of 8 brick-layers built 40 flats in 12
 days by the new method, whereas formerly it would have
 taken 40 workers half a month !
 To build more quickly does not only mean the saving
 of manpower.  It also means that more workers will
 move earlier into their new apartment houses, that Chinese
 students will have more classrooms, more laboratories and
 more hostels, that machines will be installed more quickly
 in new workshops and thus turn out more products.  Su
 Chang-yu and other building workers have, therefore,
 through their creative labour, made a great contribution
 not only to stepping up China's building industry, but the
 nation's construction and development as a whole.
 For his outstanding service to the people, Su Chang
 yu has received much commendation.  He was elected a
 Model Worker, invited to Peking to attend National Day
 celebrations in 1951 and sent to Poland in 1952 as a
 member of the Chinese delegation attending May Day
 celebrations there.
 Now Su Chang-yu attends a short-term secondary
 school specially set up for workers and peasants in North-
 east            China.  There, together with  many other young
 model workers, he studies the Chinese language, arithmetic
 and other subjects of general knowledge to which the old
 society had denied them access.  Su applies himself to his
 studies with the same burning zeal as he did for produc-
 tion.  He stands ready to play a still greater part in
 China's peaceful construction, to help build his homeland
 into a paradise on earth for all to live in.

 INVENTOR OF A METHOD WIPING OUT
 ILLITERACY
 In recent months, illiterates among China's people
 .have been equipped with the Rapid Method of Learning
 Chinese Characters. This new method was devised not by
 .a professor of linguistics, but by a young cultural rank-
 .and-file worker of the People's Liberation Army named
 ,Chi Chien-hua.  This new method enables an illiterate
 ,person  (naturally  only  one  whose  mother-tongue  is
 Chinese) to read popularly written books and to write
 .,simple sentences after only 150 hours of study.
 Just What Is This New Method ?
 In writing Chinese, thousands of ideographs are used.
 `There are many aids for memorizing these complicated
 -structures, but all so far have relied on a great effort of
 repetition.  According to the new method, the student
 starts by memorizing a set of 37 phonetic signs.  A picture
 or a short story attached to each helps him accomplish this
 preliminary task in two days.  The second step is to learn
 to use these phonetic signs.   A combination of any two

 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 or three of them (which are divided into vowels and con-
 sonants) is able to give a close approximation of the sound
 of any ideograph.
 In the second stage of study, the student begins to
 link up the phonetic signs with the actual characters. First
 he reads characters with the phonetic signs alongside them,
 and the teacher helps by explaining the meanings.  The
 work goes extremely fast.  A student is able to learn
 twenty and sometimes even more characters in an hour.
 Then the students divide into small mutual-aid groups,
 and help each other repeat the words learnt.  After re-
 peating each word four or five times, the phonetic signs are
 removed, and they start to read the characters indepen-
 dently.  Within 100 hours, they can learn to read 2,000,
 characters.
 In the meantime, they learn to read textbooks, and in
 a total study period of 150 hours they learn to write the
 2,000 words they now can read, and also to use a dictionary.
 This method is especially adapted for the use of adults,
 since their ears are familiar with the sound of the charac-
 ters they study and their eyes, too, know many of the
 characters.  When the students learn to associate un-
 familiar things with those which are familiar, the sound
 and sight of these characters impress themselves easily on
 their minds.
 The Man Who Started It
 Chi Chien-hua was born into a poor peasant family in
 Honan Province. Of his whole family only he and his mother
 escaped death through starvation.  From early childhood

 "Ah" Chi Chien-hua
 pronounces  one  of
 the  phonetic  signs,
 which adult students
 learn quickly    with
 the help of the pic-
 tures                      accompanying
 them
 he toiled and struggled against the old society and its
 backwardness.  At fourteen, he received his first lessons
 at a free night school in a neighbouring village and learnt
 the phonetic signs.  He mastered them in a few nights and
 was able to read the primary school textbooks of the time
 within a month.    Then he went on by making use of every
 spare minute.  After wood-cutting, Chi Chien-hua would
 sit in a mountain cave and read an 8,000-word dictionary
 with the help of phonetic symbols.  He went through it
 within 11 days and came fully to appreciate the use of
 the phonetic system.
 Chi joined the People's Liberation Army in 1948.
 How often did he hear his comrades say:  "To master the
 technique of modern warfare, we must raise our cultural
 level."  Just at that time, a new comrade who knew only
 a few characters joined his unit; Chi started to teach him
 according to the phonetic system, and in ten days the man
 had learned about 500 characters, while formerly he could

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 manage only three or four words a day.  The Command
 of this people's army of culture quickly took note of the
 fact.  Chi was made a full-time teacher, and conducted
 further experiments with other fighters.  At the beginning
 ,of each experiment, however, he would be up against the
 novices' incredulity about his method.
 "Learn forty characters a day?  That's impossible,"
 said Lu Kuo-ting, one of the soldier-students.  "Words
 aren't water that we can drink at one gulp."
 With much effort, Chi Chien-hua at last persuaded
 them to start with a list of 1,300 words in common use
 which he had selected.  In a few days the students learned
 quite a number of them.  "Almost unbelievable," Lu Kuo-
 ting exclaimed after he had attended the class for three
 days.  "I really drank forty characters on the very first
 day, and on the second and third I took bigger gulps: sixty
 characters and eighty.  I've become literate even before
 I know it!"  Some more days later, Lu memorized the
 whole list of words and was found reading the magazine
 Hero with great gusto.
 Later, many experts were assigned to help Chi Chien-
 hua perfect his method.  At the second conference of
 educational and cultural workers of the People's Liberation
 Army in November 1951, this method was discussed and
 endorsed.  It was then widely experimented on among
 workers and peasants, and the results proved equally suc-
 cessful.  In Tientsin, for example, an experimental class
 was set up by the textile workers' union in January 1952.
 After 195.5 hours' study, the students had learnt an average
 of 1,589 characters.   Another experimental class  in
 Kaopeitien, a suburb of Peking, also reported that the
 peasant students had mastered 1,638 characters in 164
 hours.  Records achieved in all sorts of places showed that,
 by adopting the rapid method, the period for learning

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 characters could be considerably shortened.  With the
 characters learnt, the students could read popularly-written
 newspapers and magazines.  Here is a letter written to
 Chairman Mao by a peasant after he had learned to read
 and write many characters by the rapid method :
 "Long ago I wanted to say so much to you, and to
 ask after your health.  But being illiterate, I couldn't
 write a single word.  Now I can write you these few
 lines since I've learned more than 2,000 characters after
 attending a literacy class for only a short time.  I'm sure
 you will share my joy. Our thanks to you for our cultural
 emancipation!  I'll learn advanced agricultural techniques
 for increased production now that I've mastered reading
 and writing."
 Significance of the Method
 Ever since its establishment, the People's Government
 has paid great attention to raising the working people's
 cultural level.  The Common Programme of the Chinese
 People's Political Consultative Conference provides that
 "universal education shall be carried out."  Remarkable
 results have been achieved in this field.  Statistics show
 that in 1952 over 3 million people were enrolled in spare-
 time schools for workers, and over 26 million in schools for
 peasants; another 42 million peasants attended winter
 schools in 1951-1952.  In order to be able to absorb know-
 ledge, the workers, peasants and soldiers have first of all
 to learn Chinese characters, which is no easy job.  For
 this very reason, Chi Chien-hua's rapid method of learning
 characters has played an important role in the literacy
 campaign.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :

 In December 1952, the Central People's Government
 established a Working Committee for the Liquidation of
 Illiteracy, of which Chi Chien-hua is deputy chief.  At
 present, branch committees have been set up in all adminis-
 trative regions and major cities to wipe out illiteracy
 through this new method.  Guides to the new method,
 textbooks and dictionaries are being printed in mass
 editions throughout the country.
 Thanks to Chi's method, illiteracy has already been
 wiped out in the main among army units in East and
 Central-South China.  Plans have been worked out to
 liquidate illiteracy first among the industrial workers, then
 among the young and adult peasants.  For the Chinese
 people as a whole, the day is not far distant when illiteracy
 -a heritage from the old society-will become a thing
 of the past.
 In recognition of Chi Chien-hua's great service, the
 Committee of Cultural and Educational Affairs of the
 Central People's Government awarded him a certificate of
 merit.  At the ceremony, Kuo Mo-jo, Chairman of the
 Committee, described Chi Chien-hua's invention as "an
 invaluable contribution to the cause of the Chinese people's
 culture and education, as well as to our nation's construc-
 tion."

 HOW HWANG JUN-PING MANAGES A
 WAREHOUSE
 There is an old Chinese proverb : "Eminent men can
 come from all trades."  But it was not until after the
 birth of New China that this proverb became a reality.
 Now it is a fact that workers in every line have every
 opportunity to develop their talents, even though their
 .jobs might have been considered "unpromising" in the
 past.
 Such, for example, is the case with Hwang Jun-ping
 of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory in
 Peking, who recently initiated a new method of warehouse
 management, thereby saving our national treasury an
 enormous sum.
 Though still in his twenties, Hwang has been a worker
 for over ten years.  All through the years before the libera-
 tion, under the exploitation and oppression by Japanese
 invaders and Kuomintang reactionaries, he was driven
 from place to place, contenting himself with whatever odd
 jobs he could find by chance.  But his life underwent a
 radical change soon after the liberation of Peking.  He
 became a lathe-operator in the newly-established North
 China Agricultural Machinery Factory. Owing to his self-
 less labour, he was soon elected deputy leader of a work
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 team that became later known as a model brigade.  To top
 its renown, Hwang created a record by trebling the output:.
 of a spare part of an insecticide atomizer.
 Last February, Hwang was promoted to vice-director
 of the factory warehouse.  To him this was a completely
 new job, and he was really at a loss how to tackle it,
 since he did not even know how to keep accounts.
 But he did not back out.  From a talk with the Com-
 munist Party branch secretary he learned that a layman.
 could train himself into mastery of any subject by relying
 on the masses.  Hwang buckled down to learning from
 his fellow workers.  When some materials and tools
 arrived at the warehouse, he would carefully watch how
 they were received and how their quality, standard and use
 were identified. He would often seek the advice of the-
 treasurer when he found difficulties in bookkeeping.  In
 this way, Hwang acquired the ABC of the professional
 skill he needed in three months.  At the same time, things
 in the warehouse began to look up soon after he had taken
 over.
 One day, Hwang joined his old mates in a workshop
 meeting.  They were discussing their plans to increase-
 production and practise economy.  Hwang listened care-
 fully to them and said to himself: "They really have an
 advanced and concrete plan.  Can't we warehouse workers.
 also map out our own plans and help the factory somehow
 in its production drive?"
 When he came back, Hwang voiced this idea to his
 fellow workers in the warehouse. But many of them did
 not agree with him.
 "After all, a warehouse is a warehouse," one demurred.
 "Its function is passive: to receive, keep and dispatch
 things."
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 "Absolutely," another joined. "Our work is dull and
 dry.  We can't create wonders here !"
 But Hwang was by no means affected by this refuta-
 tion.                   He continued to think:  "Is it true that the function
 of a warehouse is merely to receive, keep and dispatch
 things?  Even so we should, at least, try to do this in
 the most efficient manner."
 It happened one day that the purchasing department
 of the factory delivered 60 kilogrammes of nails to the
 warehouse for keeping.  There were already 170 kg. piled
 up in it. According to conventional practice, Hwang's duty
 was just to receive and store them away.  But his high
 sense of responsibility forbade him to be indifferent to any
 waste.   He thought it a crime to pile up stocks, especially
 at a time when the country needed to accumulate capital
 for large-scale economic construction.
 This episode set him thinking.   "The purchasing
 department should not buy anything without the consent
 of the warehouse!" was his conclusion at last.  He voiced
 this opinion to the factory management in the form of
 a suggestion and it was readily accepted.
 The warehouse man-
 ager             Hwang   Jun-
 ping keeps close con-
 tact with the work-
 shops, either through
 personal inspections
 or through the tele-
 phone

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 After this, Hwang worked out a new advanced system
 of warehouse management which knocked down all con-
 servative standards.   Formerly, stock-piling was con-
 sidered something inevitable.  Things to be used at the
 end of a month were purchased as early as the beginning
 of the month, and laid up in the warehouse all this time.
 Under the new system, aimed at ensuring a quick turnover
 of the factory's capital, materials and tools are purchased
 and dispatched to the workshops several times a month,
 according to the exact date when they are needed.  Thus,
 the warehouse becomes a transmitting centre where stores
 stay only for the shortest possible period.
 Another feature of the new system is that the ware-
 house workers take the initiative in satisfying the require-
 ments of production.  Take coke, for instance.  In the
 past, coke of various sizes lay mixed up in the warehouse,
 and the workers had to waste much time and labour before
 they could get the right size for any particular use such
 as larger lumps for casting shops, and smaller ones for
 forging shops.  To overcome this shortcoming, Hwang led
 the warehouse workers to sieve the coke and to divide the
 coke up according to different sizes, so that they could
 always find the right size easily.
 Before Hwang's new management method was intro-
 duced, the workshop workers had been unwilling to use
 second-rate materials and tools if they found better ones
 in the warehouse ; and the warehouse attendants always
 provided them with what they asked for.  As a result,
 second-rate materials and tools were piled up and remained
 unused for a long time, while first-rate ones were used in
 places where second-rate ones would have done equally
 well.  Today, the warehouse workers recommend second-
 rate            tools  and  materials  and  sometimes  substitutes
 wherever possible to the workshops, with the result that
 production costs have been considerably cut down without
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 lowering the quality of manufactured goods.  At the same
 time, Hwang has made the best use of materials accu-
 mulated in the long-neglected "rubbish room" of the ware-
 house.  Fine spare-parts have been carefully picked out
 and reassembled into perfect tools.  Heaps of worn-out
 emery wheels have been turned into substitutes for emery;
 the annual consumption of emery is thus reduced by 60
 per cent, which means a saving of 200 million yuan every
 year.
 In order to make maximum use of materials, the ware-
 house is exercising unified control over the tool depositories
 of all workshops.  Thus, tools in common use but not
 constantly needed by any single unit may be passed around,
 instead of lying idle in one workshop while they are
 urgently needed by another.  This system of unified con-
 trol has also the advantage of eliminating waste :  For
 instance, workers in a lathe workshop where only 10-inch-
 diametre emery wheels are used will no longer throw
 them away when these wheels are ground to a diametre of
 eight inches as was formerly the case, but hand them over,
 through the warehouse, to some other workshop needing
 8-inch-diametre wheels.
 Of course, to put this system into effect, the warehouse
 workers must be familiar with conditions in the workshops,
 as well as with the quality and use of all materials and
 tools.  Therefore, Hwang makes a point of inviting the
 workshop workers to the warehouse to give advice and
 explanations and examine stocks.  Workshop workers are
 quite willing to help in this way since it means they can
 always get the proper materials and tools from the ware-
 house.
 To serve the workshop better, the warehouse itself has
 effected a new division of labour by setting a specific task
 to each of the various sections.

 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 Under the new system worked out by Hwang Jun-
 ping, the warehouse has assumed a new character.  "It's
 like a treasure house now," the workers say of their ware-
 house.  There has been no more stock-piling in the ware-
 house since August 1952, and it has to a large extent
 assisted the factory in increasing production and practis-
 ing economy.
 Advanced experiences, in whatever field of work?
 spread like wild-fire in New China.  So does Hwang's new
 warehouse management method, which is being adopted
 by all industrial,  financial  and transport enterprises
 throughout the country.
 Hwang Jun-ping has become a well-known figure
 among the Chinese people, for his feat on the labour front
 and for his valuable contribution to China's build-up.  The
 2 million people in Peking are particularly proud of this
 labour hero and have elected him a member of their Muni-
 cipal People's Government Council.

 A MODEL PEASANT TELLS HIS STORY
 by Tsen Yueh-fang
 I had heard quite a lot about Chen Yi-ko, the young
 model peasant from Kiangsi Province who had made his
 name in increased agricultural production.  But it was not
 until he came to Peking recently, on his way to Vienna as
 a member of the Chinese delegation to the International
 Conference for the Defence of the Rights of Youth, that
 I had the opportunity to interview him.
 About twenty-five years of age, Chen Yi-ko is not tall
 in stature.  He has a plump, sun-tanned face, round smil-
 ing eyes, and the unassuming appearance typical of the
 Chinese peasant.
 Chen was the leader of a mutual-aid team in Shanhsia
 village in his native province.  Since its formation in 1951,
 his team had reaped good harvests, each one better than
 the last. In 1952, the team brought in an average rice crop
 of 721 catties per mou, about 62 per cent above the previous
 year's record.  Even more striking was the fact that the
 output on Chen's own 4.1 mou jumped from 320 catties per
 mou in 1951 to 1,431 catties in 1952!
 This was made possible by the untiring efforts of

 the People's Government.  I came to appreciate the full
 meaning of this only after Chen had told me about the con-
 ditions under which his team worked.
 "Our bumper crop was not bestowed by the bounty of
 Nature," Chen said very decidedly.  The soil in Shanhsia
 village is poor and crop failures were frequent before
 liberation.  Chen's 4.1 mou, for instance, were originally a
 piece of sandy land that yielded only 240 catties of rice per
 mou when it was in the hands of the landlord.
 Nor is this all.  Natural calamities had caused even
 greater trouble.  Situated at the foot of a hill, Shanhsia
 village is surrounded by a river on three sides.  When
 spring comes, the river overflows from heavy rains and
 causes serious damage to the crops.   In dry seasons
 droughts are aggravated by the sandy soil which does not
 hold water.
 However,  things  have  become  different. Natural
 calamities notwithstanding, the agrarian reform by con-
 fiscating the land of the landlords and distributing it among
 the landless and land-poor peasants aroused the latter's in-
 itiative and enthusiasm so that higher output was the result..

 Chen Yi-ko told the inspiring story of how he led his
 mutual-aid team in the battle with Nature.  Last year, a
 flood occurred after the spring sowing, and the turbulent
 waters came pouring in through a leak in the dyke built
 after the liberation.  The sprouts in the paddy fields were
 in grave danger of being flooded.  Chen, who was ill then,
 immediately led his team to stave off the danger.  Fighting
 the raging flood for two days and two nights without a
 wink of sleep, they finally succeeded in stopping the leakage
 and saved the tender sprouts.
 Summer was drawing to a close.  The crops began to,
 put forth fine, green ears.  This time there was a great
 shortage of rain.  Waterwheels were set in motion round
 the clock, but the river was running dry.  The situation
 grew more serious all the time, but the peasants did not
 lose heart.  Together with the inhabitants of the neigh-
 bouring village, they dug a sizable ditch which brought
 life-giving water to their thirsty fields.
 Two or three months passed.  The crops were ripen-
 ing, and the peasants had set their mind at ease, looking
 forward to a secure harvest.  Just then, a steady downpour
 of rain made the river swell again. Two-thirds of the land
 tilled by Chen's team remained inundated for over a month,
 and efforts to drain off the water were all in vain.  Seeing
 the ripe crops in danger, Chen decided to snatch the harvest
 from the flood.  Under his initiative, the whole team joined
 in, despite the chilly water which reached waist-high.
 "We managed to rescue only half of our crop," Chen
 remarked, not without regret.  "But still we reaped more
 than the previous year." His face was now lit in a smile.
 Our conversation turned to another subject when I
 asked how his mutual-aid team had come into being.
 The story dates back to 1951. In March of that year,
 Chen was elected a delegate to the Conference of Labour
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4

 Models of Kiangsi Province.  There, through reports made
 by government leaders and views exchanged with other
 labour models, he realized clearly which was the right path
 .for the Chinese peasants to take.  Land reform was but
 the first step towards prosperity.  A far happier future
 lay ahead-the age of socialism, and in order to reach this
 goal, the peasants must organize for collective farming.
 When Chen returned to his village, he found much of
 the land unploughed although it was high time for the
 spring ploughing.  The reason was the peasants' lack in the
 means of production-an aftermath of years of famine
 _prior to the liberation in 1949.
 But the peasants found a way out after Chen had told
 them all he had learned about mutual-aid teams.  After a
 few days of thorough discussion, they formed a "labour-
 .exchange team" on a temporary basis.  In this form of
 organization, the members helped each other as friendly
 neighbours, without payment in money or in kind. Draught
 animals and tools were lent by those who owned them.  The
 borrower compensated the lender by contributing his
 manual labour.
 This primitive form of mutual aid could not, however,
 fully meet the need of the poor peasants for a more rapid
 improvement in their livelihood.  Nor did it encourage the
 more well-to-do peasants to invest more for expansion in
 production.  The peasants soon became aware of the need
 to find a form of joint activity that would bring together
 for the benefit of all the small amounts of unused capital,
 the animals and equipment of the better-off peasants on
 the one hand with the unused labour of the poor peasants
 on the other.
 Chen then explained to the peasants the more advanced
 type of mutual aid.  The team members held full discus-
 sions and decided to develop a permanent mutual-aid team.
 In this type of organization, the work done by each member
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 was remunerated to stimulate labour enthusiasm. Draught
 animals and farm implements were used in common, and
 any member who did not own them paid a flat fee in grain
 for each mou of land he owned, the fee going to the owner
 of the animals or implements in compensation for their use
 and upkeep.  At times draught animals and equipment
 were bought outright by the team, each member paying a
 part of the cost proportionate to the amount of his land-
 holding.
 The advantages of mutual aid stood out in bold relief
 at harvest time.  As the peasants were organized, they
 could plan ahead of time.  Working together, they were
 able to improve their farming techniques.  For many of
 the team members, it was the first time their land was
 cultivated three times over and ploughed six or seven
 inches deep, something that would have been beyond their
 power when they worked all by themselves.  The fields
 were better fertilized, and seeds more carefully selected.
 Above all, their united efforts did not leave the peasants
 helpless any longer in the face of natural calamities.
 These convincing facts changed the views of sceptical
 peasants and the last of the individual peasants in the
 village applied for admittance to the team.  In this way,
 Shanhsia village became a model for all others in Kiangsi
 Province to follow.
 Chen's leadership was an important factor in welding
 the team members into unity.  General membership meet-
 ings were regularly held where production plans, the re-
 muneration of labour, patriotic pacts and other problems
 were discussed and agreed upon in a democratic way before
 they went into effect.
 Chen never slackened his efforts to stimulate a sense
 of patriotism in the peasants.  "Every grain of rice reaped
 will add to the strength of our motherland"-this was what
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 he said again and again to arouse the peasants' enthusiasm.
 Consequently, his team always responded immediately to
 calls by the People's Government.  It was one of the three
 mutual-aid teams in Kiangsi Province which first joined the
 nation-wide patriotic drive for bumper harvests in 1952.
 In the fall of 1952, the team completed the delivery of
 public grain within two days.   Their plan to donate money
 to the volunteers at the Korean front, too, was overfulfilled
 36 per cent.
 Owing to his selfless work, Chen was twice elected
 model peasant.  In April 1950, Chen joined the New Demo-
 cratic Youth League of China.  In October of the follow-
 ing year, he achieved the glory of being admitted to the
 Chinese Communist Party. These important events in his
 life gave fresh impetus to his endeavours in production.
 "I just can't tell in words how much we owe to the
 Communist Party!"
 In these words Chen expressed not only his own heart-
 felt gratitude to the Party, but that of the Chinese peas-
 antry as a whole.  And, as is the case with all the peasants
 in our country, the name of the Party is invariably linked
 to the significant change in his own life.
 "I  experienced  everything-need,  privation,  toil,"
 Chen said.  "My father died when I was six, leaving my
 mother not a single inch of land.  Since then, I had to
 support myself by tending cattle for other people.      At
 eleven, I began the worst part of my life.  My family then
 owed a landlord two and a half piculs of rice.  As we
 couldn't afford to pay it back-not because the amount was
 too big but because the landlord wanted it that way-I
 was bound to hire myself out to him.  For fourteen long
 years I slaved for him, right up to the time of liberation,
 but still we couldn't free ourselves of the debt."

 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 Recalling the past, Chen's otherwise warm and friend-
 ly eyes flashed with hatred for those who had robbed his
 childhood of all its joys.
 "How about life in your village as a whole?" I asked.
 "Everyone of us experienced the same fate.  In those
 days, we could hardly keep body and soul together.  We
 all subsisted on potatoes and wild vegetables, and hadn't
 enough rags to cover our bodies with.  In famine years,
 we even resorted to bark and grass-roots."
 Evidently embittered by these painful memories, he
 paused and remained silent for a while.  But he soon
 brightened up again as he began talking about the present.
 After  successive  bumper  harvests,  Shanhsia  has
 become a thriving village where, as the village folks them-
 selves put it, "every household has surplus grain and every-
 body wears new clothes."  Grandma Tu has smilingly put
 on new clothing for the first time since she married sixty
 years ago. Many families have repaired their houses or
 built new ones. The village has accumulated joint property
 (draught animals, ploughs, waterwheels, etc.) in increas-
 ing quantities.  The peasants are envious of their own
 children, all of whom are attending school.
 "We grown-ups, too, have the opportunity to receive
 education now," Chen added.  "A literacy campaign is in
 full swing in our village, and very soon everyone of us will
 be able to read and write. Our village regularly subscribes to
 five newspapers, including the People's Daily, which we read
 in groups every day."
 "What are you most interested in when you read news-
 papers?"  I interrupted.
 "Well, current affairs, government policies, agricultural
 science-anything that has to do with our life and produc-
 tion work.  But as peasants, we are naturally most con-

 cerned about the development of our country's agricultural
 economy.  We are greatly inspired by the growth of agricul-
 tural producers' co-operatives and collective farms in our
 homeland.
 "In October last year, with the help of the village gov-
 ernment, we further developed our mutual-aid team into a
 co-operative by pooling our land and utilising it system-
 atically. Since everybody's income depends now more on the
 amount of work he renders rather than on the area of land
 he has put into the pool we all are inspired with the great-
 est zeal.  Labour productivity has risen considerably, and
 we have more extra manpower available for subsidiary
 occupations.  With our increased income, we've bought a
 number of new farm implements.  Besides, we're going to
 build a reservoir with drainage pipes and an engine-driven
 pump.  Soon we'll be free from the threats of flood and
 drought.
 "Of course, all this is but the very beginning of our
 happy life.  Through newspapers and film shows, through
 reports from our peasant delegates who visited the Soviet
 Union, we've learned about the beautiful life of the Soviet
 collective farmers.  We know we've still to go a long way.
 However, we hold our present life very dear because, as
 once oppressed and exploited people, we understand what
 a great price we've paid for it.  For the same reason,
 we're deeply concerned with the struggle of the people of
 other lands who haven't yet secured a life as free and
 happy as ours.  I'm very glad to have this opportunity to
 attend the International Conference for the Defence of
 the Rights of Youth. It's indeed a grand thing for young
 people from all over the world to gather and to discuss the
 most important issue of the day-peace and the rights of
 youth.  For my part, I'll do my best to help the work of
 the Conference, in the name of peace and a better future
 of youth-for China and for the whole world !"

 YOUNG BUILDERS ON THE HUAI RIVER
 Most visitors to the exhibition of the Huai River pro-
 ject, held last year at Pengpu, Anhwei, the railway centre
 whence the project is easily reached, stopped for a long
 time before a picture in colours.  This picture showed a
 young worker talking to a peasant family, an old couple,
 their son and daughter-in-law and a little boy with a red
 scarf, probably their grandson.  Holding in his left hand
 a newspaper deseribing the plan of harnessing the Huai
 River, the young worker waves his right hand as if to say :
 "Look, this is what the Huai River will be like !"  Follow-
 ing the direction of his hand, the peasant family see a
 boundless stretch of wheat fields, with golden ears weigh-
 ing down the stalks.  Combines are harvesting in the far-
 away distance.  The Huai is flowing calm and quiet, only
 disturbed here and there by a steamer whose stern makes
 the water foam above the crested waves.  On the other
 bank of. the river stand rows of factories, their tall stacks
 puffing heavy smoke....  The peasants are listening atten-
 tively, their faces wearing an expression of both astonish-
 ment and joy.  They are obviously entranced with the
 prospects of the Huai River project, with the radiant future
 of their motherland.

 A Great Project to Conquer Nature
 The project to harness the Huai River is indeed one
 of the great epics of modern times.  When completed in
 1955, it will have transformed nature and freed 60 million
 people living on the 210,000 square kilometres of the Huai
 River Valley forever from the threat of floods.  About
 3,300,000 hectares of farm land will be irrigated; naviga-
 tion will be improved on 2,000 kilometres of inland water-
 ways ; and tremendous hydraulic power will be generated.
 Such prospects have inspired the people of the whole
 country.  In the first and second phases of the project
 (1951-1952), a total of 4,600,000 workers and peasants
 dedicated themselves to battling the calamities that were
 such common occurrences under the reactionary rulers of
 the past.   Forty  thousand  non-technical  government
 employees and 16,000 engineers and technicians also helped
 in this gigantic undertaking.

 Youth constitutes almost half of this mighty force.
 These young people, including hundreds of thousands of
 Youth League members, have played and are still playing
 an active role in the project, many of them having been
 elected model workers for their excellent performance.  In
 the second phase of the project, young people constituted
 over 50 per cent of the workers cited for achievement; and
 11,236 of these, or 31.5 per cent of the total, were Youth
 League members.
 King Hsiu-lan, a Model for All River Tamers
 Youth League member King Hsiu-lan is known as one
 of the initiators of the patriotic emulation drive now sweep-
 ing the length and breadth of the vast construction site.
 She is the daughter of a former poor peasant.  In pre-
 liberation years, her family was driven into destitution each
 time when floods caused crop failure.  Since the liberation,
 the life of her family has been improving all the time.  In
 1950, when Chairman Mao Tse-tung issued the call "The
 Huai River must be harnessed!" King Hsiu-lan responded
 immediately.
 Once she led a brigade of peasant labourers to dredge
 a stretch of swamp more than 650 m. in length, 50 m. in
 width and 5 m. in depth.  How could this be done when
 the bog would hardly bear a person's weight, let alone
 someone carrying a load? At first, logs were laid down for
 the diggers to walk on, but they would give very soon too.
 Then mats were tried, but they would not do either.  Yet
 all these failures could not dampen the spirit of the work-
 ers.   Following  King  Hsiu-lan's  initiative,  they                   ex-
 perimented in all sorts of ways, pledging not to leave the
 construction site until the 351,000 cubic metres of mud were
 dredged from the swamp.  Finally they succeeded by using

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 bundles of reeds, which floated more readily than any other
 available material.
 This method was immediately popularized among the
 15,000 people engaged in dredging the swamp, and many
 of them were able as a result to double their labour
 efficiency.  This was no small success.   Originally the
 dredging project required 1,170,000 work days, as each
 worker could excavate only 0.3 cubic metres of mud per
 day.  Now the average daily record rose to 0.75 cubic
 metres, so that a total of only 468,000 work days would
 suffice. In other words, the 15,000 workers would need
 702,000 work days less than originally estimated!
 "Drops of Water Make an Ocean"
 The Huai River project involves millions of cubic
 metres of earth to be excavated.  As machines are not yet
 widely used on the site, excavation has for the most part
 to be done with spades.  It would seem that digging, carry-
 ing, loading and unloading earth are very simple opera-
 tions.  This may be true if a peasant is digging a small
 ditch by himself.  But when it comes to collective labour,
 when hundreds of thousands of men are engaged at the
 same construction site, when canals have to be excavated
 and hills levelled, then even such work becomes a highly
 complex process.   The scientific division  of labour is
 required, and every single minute of work-time saved by an
 individual counts.
 "Drops of water make an ocean," was the slogan of
 Chu Huai-shun, a young brigade leader.      He gave much
 thought to improving working methods, combining the ex-
 periences of other brigades with those of his own, and
 popularizing them far and wide.  By careful observation
 and conscientious study, he worked out a series of methods

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :

 Chu Huai-shun, whose digging method has been widely
 adopted among navvies on the Huai River Project
 according to which a few seconds could be saved in every
 operation or movement.  But what a huge amount of labour
 was saved when these few seconds were multiplied with
 the number of people engaged in these operations !  By
 adopting these methods, Chu's own brigade consisting of
 20 members nearly doubled its excavating efficiency. It
 was estimated that when these methods were adopted by
 all the navvies on the Huai River, it would mean the ex-
 cavation of an extra 617,100 cubic metres of earth every
 day, or the saving of 15,950,000 work days by 1,100,000
 men in the spring of 1952!
 In the Thick of Battle with Floods
 The blind forces of Nature do not yield to Man's will
 readily.  As if in conspiracy with the river, torrential

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 rains often swell into floods that threaten to break the
 dykes. So the river tamers have to be especially vigilant in
 wet weather and be ready for a fierce battle in case of an
 emergency.
 On March 29, 1952, it rained cats and dogs when a
 dam was going to be completed on the Pangchiao Reservoir.
 Work was done more intensely than usual, lest a flood
 should wash down from the mountains and break the coffer-
 dam on the water detention basin.
 In the white mist formed by the heavy rain, a black
 figure was vaguely seen moving to and fro on the dam.  It
 was young peasant Chiao Chih-ping on sentry duty.      All
 the time, his anxious gaze was fixed on the ripples and
 waves on the surface.  Should a leak occur in the dam, the
 unfinished dam might be washed away and the labour done
 by 40,000 men in half a month be set at nought.
 Dusk was falling. The young sentinel was even more
 on his guard.  With no time for changing clothes or eating
 for a whole day, he was drenched to the skin and shivering
 with cold and hunger.  At midnight, he found the water
 level rising and the rock above the surface quickly submerg-
 ed.             A splashing sound came from below.  In the dark he
 saw a white column issuing from the outer part of the dam
 that was soon growing into a wide sheet.
 "A leakage!" was the dreadful thought that flashed
 through Chiao's mind.  He rushed down with a sackful of
 sand and earth which he had prepared beforehand.  He
 stuck it into the hole and then pressed his own body against
 the gushing water, but the torrent knocked him down. He
 struggled up and dashed toward the construction site to
 get help.  In very short time, people swarmed over the
 danger spot, with Chiao at the head.  Buckets of earth
 were thrown into the leakage.  By the crack of dawn, the
 intractable water was subdued. Building work was resum-
 ed and completed in time.

 Young Workers and Technicians
 The Huai River project naturally involves also an
 enormous industrial undertaking.  It requires huge sluice
 locks, concrete and steel bars, rail-tracks, pumps, genera-
 tors, boring machines, etc.   All these materials, which
 weigh hundreds of thousands of tons, are supplied by
 China's cities near the construction site as well as far away
 from it.  When workers in Shanghai or Taiyuan receive
 urgent orders for machinery, they always fulfill them on
 time or even ahead of schedule. Others come to the Huai
 River from all corners of the country, under the slogan :
 "Support to our peasant brothers!", transporting needed
 materials by railway or boat, installing electric wires on
 the construction site, setting up repair shops in the valley,
 or working day and night on bulldozers or suction dredges.
 Take, for instance, the Futseling Reservoir on the Pi
 River, one of the largest tributaries of the Huai in the
 middle reaches.  A multiple arch dam, 516 metres long
 and 74 metres high, is being built across the Pi River where
 it flows between two mountains, cutting a gorge 200 metres
 wide.  The reservoir, when completed this year, will en-
 close an area of 23 square kilometres and be capable of
 holding 500 million cubic metres of water.  A project like
 this  naturally  calls  for the most advanced  technical
 standards.  The calculations and designs required punctili-
 ous precision; but they were chiefly the work of Tsao
 Tsu-sheng and Wang Ming-lien, two young technicians not
 long out of college.    Drawing on advanced Soviet experi-
 ence and through persistent research on their own, they
 have already proved themselves promising specialists in
 water conservancy.      In fact, the Huai River is a great
 school for many young Chinese workers and technicians.
 In early 1952, when construction started on the Futseling

 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 Reservoir, there were only about 1,000 technical workers.
 A year later, over 2,400 newly trained workers joined.
 Among them was a boring team consisting of nine girls
 between 18 and 23 years of age, the first women's team of
 this sort in China.  Young People's Liberation Army men
 have stacked their rifles to take up pneumatic drills on the
 Huai project.  And young peasants have learned to handle
 concrete-mixers, drive tip wagons or lay rail-tracks.  This
 is the new personnel handling 210 machines of over 30
 different types !
 The workers are learning new techniques and invent-
 ing new ways of doing things all the time.  One team im-
 provised a shift for sorting stones and thereby increased
 labour efficiency from 0.55 cubic metres per work day to
 1.17 cubic metres.  Pneumatic drill operators have saved
 the country 900 million yuan by utilizing 100,000 waste
 bits.
 Fruits of Labour Already Seen
 It was through this boundless creativeness and labour
 enthusiasm of the river tamers that the first two phases of
 the project were successfully completed by July last year.
 The tremendous achievements to date include:  dredging
 of the channel of the Huai and its 70-odd tributaries for
 a total length of 2,880 km.; repairing of 2,193 km. of dykes ;
 excavation of the North Kiangsu Irrigation Canal, 170 km.
 long, and open for navigation by 900-ton steamers; build-
 ing of a 561-metre movable dam at Jenhochi ; three gorge-
 type reservoirs; 15 low-land flood detention basins; and
 more than 130 culverts.
 The work of the first two years of the Huai project
 involved the digging of 487 million cubic metres of earth-
 equivalent to two Panama Canals and one Suez Canal.

 Through the Yuntung Dam, the water of the Grand Canal flows into the
 North Kiangsu Irrigation Canal, which will assure the regular supply of
 water for 1,720,000 hectares of rice and cotton fields
 Already the Huai River Valley is changed beyond
 recognition.  Hundreds of thousands of once flood-stricken
 peasants are now settled happily in new locations and have
 begun a new, prosperous life.  Starting with the spring
 of 1951, each year has brought them bigger bumper crops,
 such as they never had before. In this one area with a
 total rural population of 18 million, the peasants harvested
 in 1951 1,650,000 tons of grain more than they had in the
 preceding year.
 Their labour having been richly rewarded, the river
 tamers are now undertaking the third stage of the project
 with fresh vigour.  This is on an even more colossal scale.
 Guided by a government of their own, the people of China
 are confident of their future, a future like that depicted in
 the exhibition on the Huai River project.

 Mon village
 Mon village avec ses bambous verts on dans le soir s'egrenaient les sons des cloches.
 les cloches de l'eglise qui sonnent ... la vie etait en pleine joie dans nos champs
 bien aimes, sur noire riviCre oil se refletait I'arequier et la nef d'un sampan.
 Mais tout est aneanti, rien n'est reste de ma terre natale. Un jour, des pillards
 franca.is sont venus raser le village, devaster les hameaux. Les routes etant
 jonchees de tant de sang, de debris de chair et d'os; les ricieres sont desertes, pas
 one & me dans les maisons abandonnees.
 Depuis le soir oil les troupes frangaises passaient, les soirs sont absents des sons
 des cloches, l'ancienne eglise etait completement detruite.
 Mon village s'est joint aux partisans, prend ses armes a l'ennemi meme pour venger
 les morts d'antan. Depuis le jour oil nous sommes contraints d'abandonner notre
 terre natale que de haine et de colere s'est accumulee dans mos ceeurs. Le soir,
 dans les forks, nous souvenons des soirs sur les rizieres d'antan.
 Depuis le jour oa nous abandonnerons notre village perdu dans les banians secu-
 laires, Ia nostalgie de Ia terre natale chaque jour etreint nos ceeurs.
 Le jour oa nous avons aneanti I'ennemi, ce fut le jour oa segrenaient les sons des
 cloches, oa tintaient les cloches de leglise.
 Mon village, les habitants de mon village, ensemble avec les partisans victorieux
 mettront 1'ennemi en pieces et rentreront au village d'autrefois. Le peuple en liesse
 abattrait les bambous, edifierait les passerelles, creusera les fosses, elevera des
 murailles, construira des abris souterrains profonds. L'ennemi nest pas encore
 completement detruit, la lutte n'a pas encore cesse, 'le village natal va au devant
 de I'avenir heureux ...

 Marche de la jeunesse sovietique
 Nous vivons sous le soleil d'or,
 Nous vivons en amitie,
 Nous sommes fiers de notre pays
 Nous aimons nos maisons.
 Nous sommes fiers de noire pays,
 ou toutes les voies sont ouvertes aux jeunes
 Le paysage est clair, mon pays,
 et to as des amis par tout.
 Nous tous pour la paix:
 C'est le serment des peuples
 Laisser verdir les semences,
 Nous tous pour la paix:
 Laisser flotter la banniere de la liberte
 Nous tous pour la paix:
 La jeunesse fleurit,
 La jeunesse appelle,
 La jeunesse avance:
 Travail en paix, printemps bruyant
 Dans notre pays,
 Jeunesse forgee pour la lutte dure
 Dana un feu brillant,
 Jeunesse forgee pour la lutte dure
 n'a pas besoin d'une guerre,
 Le paysage est clair, mon pays,
 et to as des amis partout.
 au refrain:
 La jeunesse porte dans son cur
 L'amour de son guide,
 C'est Staline qui nous conduit
 La bonne route vers l'avenir.
 C'est Staline qui nous conduit
 pour edifier le communisme,
 Le paysage est clair, mon pays,
 Et to as des amis par tout.

 L'Australie eat un grand pays et la liberte approche,
 Et la liberte eat en marche. Oh! ne l'entendez-vous pas qui appelle?
 Elie vient de recommencer la lutte, ells abattra lea tyrans,
 Elie allumera une nouvelle flamme, et fera eclater une nouvelle revolte.
 Nos pares ont peine pour un pain am6re, tandis que lee faineants faisaient fortune
 A cote d'eux.
 Mais leur pays ne leur donnait ni nourriture, ni vetements.
 Ainsi malgres leur patriotisme ils ont quitte leur terre natale.
 Et sont vennus (oii, s'ils ont vole, ils ont ete envoyes) en traversant l'ocsan.
 Ainsi que d'autres Pont fait avant nous
 Nous devons lever le drapeau revolutionnaire
 Et nous devons chanter une chanson revolutionnaire et nous unir dans un coeur
 revolutionnaire.
 Nous ferons sentir aux tyrans le dard de ceux qu'ils voudraient strangler,
 Its ne devront pas dire que la faute eat A nous si le sang va tacher lea mimosas.
 Alors la liberte n'a pu supporter 1'eclat de la royaute
 Elie a laisse les faineants IA ou ils etaient,
 Et elle eat venue en Australie.
 Mais maintenant lea chaines ont traverse l'ocean puissant afin de la ligoter.
 Elie n'avait pas cru revoir lee maux qu'elle avait laisses derriere elle.

 La jeunesse du monde combat pour la paix
 Ecrit par on jeune compositeur Danois pour le Festival de Berlin
 La jeunesse du monde combat pour la paix,
 L'unite est noire arme contre haine et violence,
 Le monde appartient a nous tous,
 La vie appelle, nous la suivrons.
 Nous anneantissons la guerre,
 La vie vaincra,
 Rien ne nous retiendra,
 Ce monde nous appartiendra.
 La paix nous demande
 De nous unit par-dessus les frontit res
 La terre verdoie et I'esperance croft,
 La jeunesse du monde demande la paix.
 Jeunes, levez-vous tous, accompagnez-nous,
 En avant vers un avenir claire et riche,
 Proclamez ceci dans tous les pays:
 Nous sommes des jeunes, nous voulons la paix!

 Jeunesse, emploie to force
 1. Voyez les fleurs,
 Voyez-les fleurir
 Le long de la route
 Ou nous passons
 Vers le clair matin,
 Vers le rayon de soleil
 D'un jour nouveau.
 Pour empecher de lourdes bottes
 D'ecraser ces fleurs
 Ainsi que le grain par nous seme,
 Emploie to force, 6 jeunesse,
 Qui forge la paix sur terre.
 Musique: Marcel Rubin
 Texts: Otto Horn
 2. Pour la paix it faut oser.
 Portons courageusement devant nous
 Le glorieux portrait des meilleurs d'entre nous,
 En exemple,
 Jusqu'a la realisation du grand reve des peuples.
 Enlevez leurs armes aux meurtriers
 Pour qu'ils ne puissent plus frapper.
 Emploie to force, 6 jeunesse, qui forge la paix sur terre.
 3. La force du travail, la force de la jeunesse,
 Ont vaincu la puissance du desert.
 La ou la lumiere de la liberte eclaire le jour,
 L'homme se sent grandir
 Et le monde s'epanouit.
 Pour que du sein riche et fertile de la terre
 Sorten partout des jardins florissants,
 Emploie to force, 6 jeunesse,
 Qui forge la paix sur terre.

 Le printemps reluit dans les champs.
 La neige blanche a fondu au soleil,
 Le vent West appais6,
 II s'est tu, etonne;
 Car un conte merveilleux West lev6
 De l'homme at d'exploits heroiques.
 La terre chance, la terre tonne,
 La terre veut remercier, par son travail,
 Celui qui, mort au combat, ne meure pas
 Et qui a aime la vie immortelle
 Dans ses magnanimes mots d'outre tombe
 it a dit a tous les vivants.
 Je vous aime, hommes victorieux!
 La paix, oh hommes, veillez sur la paix!
 Elie a une valeur sur toutes les valeurs.
 Paix - voila l'appel de Fucik
 Qui resonne par tout le monde.
 Paix, afin que les hommes vivent,
 Que I'homme heureux aime l'homme.
 La terre chante, la terre tonne,
 Elie veut promettre par son travail:
 Nous ne mendierons pas la paix aux meurtriers,
 Nous lutterons, por la paix, contre Is guerre.
 Dans ses magnamimes mots d'outre tombe
 it a dit a tous les vivants:
 Je vous aime, hommes victorieux,
 Je vous aime - veillez - hommes victorieux.
 La verite I'a mene au but!
 Hier it a combattu pour ce jour d'aujourd'hui,
 Et quand la colere monta,
 II etait debout, resistant comme une digue:
 Et quand it envoya son message A. son pays aime,
 11 salua l'Union sovietique.
 Nous serons comme des rochers, contre les meurtrier:
 Au nom de lui, que les hommes ont aime
 Et qui a aime la vie immortelle.
 Dans ses magnamimes mots d'outre tombe
 it a dit a tous les vivants:
 Je vous aime, hommes victorieux.

 Chant de paix de la jeunesse
 Nous, la jeunesse du monde entier,
 Pleins de joie, nous nous rencontrons a Berlin.
 Malgre les differences des convictions,
 Nous suivons fidelement et conrageusement
 notre but unique commun:
 Deux fois l'humanite a souffert
 Une guerre mondiale, dont la cruaute est manifeste,
 Et deja le ciel s'obscurcit
 De la menace d'une nouvelle guerre.
 Avangant comme si nous n'etions qu'un seul homme,
 Nous agissons d'accord,
 Pour emp6cher la cruelle guerre,
 Voila notre appel pacifique et fort.
 Nous, les jeunes, tendons nos mains
 A I'amitie fidele, qui est notre but.
 Voila la base de notre activite en faveur de la paix,
 Qu'aucun fauteur de guerre nous ravira.
 Nous ne voulons pas titre aspirants a la mort,
 Ni voir bombarder nos usines, champs et esoles.
 Notre devoir est, de generation en generation,
 De realiser un travail constructif en temps de paix.
 Au refrain!
 L'arbre de la jeunesse Porte des fruits doux,
 Mais it faut que beaucoup de mains 1'arrosent.
 Quand it sera grand, it nous abritera,
 Nous vivrons en paix et en ordre sous sa protection.
 De tout notre ceeur, nous devouerons
 Nos forces physiques et mentales
 A Ia delivrance de tous les peuples,
 Ce que sera Ia base de la paix a jamais.

 La colombe blanche survole, en deployant ses ailes,
 Un monde ou douleur s'accumule sur douleur.
 A Dixe, I Phong-Yang, les morts jugent
 De leurs yeux ch6ris ceux, qui d6mentent is raison.
 De nouvelles chansons vont autour du monde,
 Des espions ne peuvent plus 1'arreter, en ne peut bannir la paix,
 Les Quislings ne peuvent plus aider des conqu6rants,
 Aucun terreur ne d6couragera la main d'une mere.
 Nous produirons, et qui osera encore
 Renier ce battement de c(aur fraternel,

 Adieu ma belle
 (Chant dea partisans italiens)
 Un matin je me suis leve,
 Adieu ma belle
 Adieu ma belle
 Ma belle, adieu, adieu, adieu.
 Un matin je me suis leve
 Et j'ai trouve l'envahisseur.
 0! Partisan emmene-moi,
 Adieu ma belle,
 Adieu ma belle,
 Ma belle, adieu, adieu, adieu.
 0! Partisan emmene-moi,
 Car je me sens mourir
 Et si je meur en Partisan,
 Adieu ma belle,
 Adieu ma belle,
 Ma belle adieu, adieu, adieu.
 Et si je meur en Partisan,
 Tu devras m'ensevelir,
 M'ensevelir la-haut sur la montagne,
 Adieu ma belle
 Adieu ma belle
 Ma belle adieu, adieu, adieu.
 M'ensevelir la-haut sur la montagne,
 Sous l'ombre d'une belle fleur.
 Et les gens qui passeront,
 Adieu ma belle
 Adieu ma belle
 Ma belle, adieu, adieu, adieu.
 Et les fens qui passeront,
 Its diront: ?Oh! quelle belle fleur."

 Paroles et Musique de Wang Hain
 Le drapeau rouge aux cinq etoiles vole an vent
 Quand les chansons de la victoire resonnent
 En 1'honneur de notre patrie bienaimee
 Qui avance maintenant vers la prosperite et la force.
 Les chansons ont traverse les montagnes et les plaines
 A travers la Riviere Jaune precipitee et le Yangtse,
 De notre patrie bienaimee
 L'heroique peuple -s'est leve
 Unis dans ('amour nous sommes plus forts que I'acier.
 Nous sommes laborieux et braves,
 L'independance de notre liberte
 Nous aimons la paix, nous aimons notre patrie
 Quiconque oserait nous invader trouvera la mort.
 Le soleil se leve a ('Est
 La force de la Republique Populaire s'accroit.
 Notre chef Mao Tse-toung
 Nous guide vers la voie du progres;
 Notre vie s'ameliore chaque jour
 Notre avenir est infiniment lumineux.

 Paroles francaises de Gil-Renaud
 Muslque de V. Rotas
 Des montagnes la voix male
 De la liberte Devale,
 Et le peuple des villages
 Se meta chanter Sauvage.
 Refrain:
 E. A. M., E. A. M., E. A. M., E. A. M.,
 Toute la Groce a repris
 Ce cri d'appel: Liberte E.
 E. A. M., E. A. M., E. A. M., E. A. M.,
 Les champs, les villes ont lance
 Ton nom au ciel: Liberte.
 Que la brise si legere,
 La mer et l'oiseau EspCrent
 La violence qui va naitre
 Conduit an tombeau Nos maitres.
 Notre lutte fraternelle
 Nous rendra la vie plus belle:
 L'Esperance dans notre ame
 Au malheur survit et clame.

 Si j'avais une cloche
 Je la ferais sonner le matin
 Je la ferais sonner le soir
 Dana ce pays entier;
 J'annoncerais le danger,
 Je ferais sonner pour avertir,
 Je ferais resonner ('amour
 De tous nos freres
 Dans ce pays entier.
 Si je savais une chanson
 Je la chanterais le matin,
 Je la chanterais le soir

 Je chanterais I'amour

 Maintenant j'ai un marteau,
 Et j'ai une cloche,
 Et j'ai une chanson a chanter

 C'est le marteau de la justice,
 C'est la cloche de la liberte,
 C'est la chanson d'amour
 De tous nos fr6res
 Dans le monde entier.

 Un Camarade                                                 tue it Khouzestan                       La plaine brulante de Khouzestan - fut couverte de sang
 Le corps du tue comme le drapeau rouge - est couvert de sang
 Un Camarade fut tue a Khouzestan
 Son coeur chaleureux no bat plus.
 Mais notre sang s'echauffe - dans le cur de ce desert brulant -
 Nous ne pleurerons jamais.
 Comme - toi ils ont tue de millions
 Leurs yeux avides de voleur - sont fixes sur noire force de travail
 Hei - hei hei - hei
 Nous ne pleurerons jamais jamais.
 Des millions de poignees de fer se fermeront.
 L'etandard de feu brillera dans le ciel
 Et la tempete de fureur et de haine terrassera l'ennemi
 Nous ne pleurerons jamais jamais.
 Ton nom est le mot d'ordre de notre lutte
 Ton corps blesee et ensanglante
 est notre drapeau
 Nous de pleurerons jamais jamais
 Hei hei hei hei
 Un Camarade fut tue it Khouzestan
 Notre lutte s'est ravivee, son nom vivra plus que jamais
 comme le chant de la victoire brillante

 which was Gheorghe Lazar, the founder of modern Rumanian schooling early
 in the 19th century. It was thus that the impassioned eagerness of patriotic
 scholars to turn the treasury of culture into the property of the people was
 fostered and preserved. And the eager mind and inexhaustible enthusiasm
 of the great democratic revolutionary Nicolae Balcescu served the cause
 of the same aspiration.
 The revival in our country today, after centuries of slavery and oppression,
 the deep process transforming our people into a socialist nation capable
 of great achievements would not have been possible without the cultural
 revolution which is being unfolded in the Rumanian People's Republic   a
 revolution which is the crowning of the progressive traditions of the Ru-
 manian people. Assigning the tasks incumbent on the educators of the young
 generation of builders of Socialism, Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej
 said: ? Special attention must be bestowed in the schools on the study of
 the Rumanian language built up by the people through the efforts of scores
 of generations, on the study of progressive, classical and contemporary
 literature reflecting the aspirations of the people, their struggle and con-
 quests, and on the history of Rumania which depicts the century-old struggle
 of the people for freedom. ?
 One of the most important features of the spiritual progress of our country
 is the close link between original creation of our days and the cultural inherit-
 ance of the past. The new socialist culture takes up in a creative spirit the
 most progressive fruits of the efforts of mankind throughout the centuries,
 everything which is spiritually linked to the struggle of the working people.
 That is why the classical patrimony is inseparable from every cultural mani-
 festation, that is why the classics of national and world literature enjoy such
 wide popularity.
 The life and works of the great revolutionary democrat Nicolae Balcescu
 will never cease to inspire the generations to come with love and gratitude

 The victorious people look upon Balcescu as upon a pioneer and a leader
 devoted unto his death to the cause of the homeland and of mankind's
 liberation.
 The centenary of N. Balcescu's death constituted a rich cultural manifesta-
 tion within the framework of which the historical works of the revolution-
 ary leader of 1848 were brought out in large editions, edited by foremost
 academicians and writers. Among the homages brought to the personality
 of this great fighter and thinker is also the inspired and comprehensive poem
 Balcescu by Eugen Jebeleanu. The play of the same name by Academician
 Camil Petrescu, represented on the stage of the e 1. L. Caragiale ? National
 Theatre in Bucharest, was likewise published in a large edition.
 The poet Mihail Eminescu also enjoys immense popularity. His poetry,
 pervaded with deep love for the oppressed people and seething with relentless
 indignation against the oppressors, has been brought out in numerous po-
 pular and festive editions totalling 150,000 copies. The deeply resonant lyre
 of this Rumanian national poet vibrated most intensely, singing of the in-
 dignation of the masses at ? the cruel, unjust social system. ?
 The fourth volume (Posthumcus Works) of the complete works of Emi-
 nescu, edited by the Academy of the Rumanian People's Republic, came out
 half a century after the publication of the first collection of his Posthumous
 Poetry; and the printing of other volumes is now under way. The fruit of
 much effort and editorial experience, this volume, issued in most satisfactory
 technical conditions, is yet another homage which the Academy of the Ru-
 manian People's Republic brings to its honorary member post mortem,
 whose centenary in 1950 afforded the entire people the opportunity of pay-
 ing tribute to this slk F,{f'tdt?- t"};i, FI, i'ttt,llt tr!

 The Making of a Hero by Ostrovsky, The Storm by Ehrenburg, Days and
 Nights by C. Simonov, Far from Moscoit' by Azhaev, C. Fedin's novels,
 the poetry of Schipachov, Tikhonov and Dolmatovsky, and numberless other
 works which today are favourites with millions of working people, young
 and old, in the Rumanian People's Republic. The readers' preference for
 Soviet books accounts for the large editions in which such works are printed.
 In the past years, the s Cartea Rust ? Publishing House alone has brought
 out 1,468 books in total editions of 20,750,000 copies, 406 of these hooks
 being in the languages of the national minorities in the Rumanian People's
 Republic. The novel Virgin Soil Upturned by M. Sholokhov, which, being
 much required by the readers in rural areas, has so far been published in
 five editions with a total circulation of over 145,000 copies, is among the
 most successful translations.
 The interest and love of our people for Soviet books are accounted for
 by the impetuous strength with which these books inspire the people in their
 struggle for the victory of peace and friendship among the nations, as well
 as by their high artistic and educational value.
 Our readers also peruse with sympathy and interest the literature of the
 countries linked to the Rumanian People's Republic by brotherly ties, and
 the works of progressive writers the world over describing the struggles of
 their people for freedom and peace. The literature of the Chinese People's
 Republic is represented by the works of outstanding writers such as Lu Sin
 (The Native Village), the founder of realistic Chinese literature whose tra-
 dition is being successfully carried on in the works of contemporary Chinese
 writers from among whom Rumanian readers know: Din Lin, Laureate
 of the Stalin Prize for Literature (The Sun Rises user River Sangan), Chiu
 Li Bo, likewise Laureate of the Stalin Prize for Literature (The Kurricane)
 Chiao Su Li (A valuable Asset), Liu Bai Iui (Three Soldiers), and others.

 poets- has made a great impression upon our people, arousing a feeling
 of ardent solidarity with the great struggle of the Korean people.
 The literature of neighbourly friendly countries which is animated by the
 same ideals as our own literature keeps the Rumanian reader abreast of the
 achievements of the working people in the countries of people's democracy,
 of their progressive culture and tradition. Translations have been published
 of classical and contemporary Hungarian writers such as: Moricz Zsigmond
 (The Highwayman and His Prancing Bah Horse), Tarnas Aczel, Stalin Prize
 Laureate (Under the Banner of Freedom), Illes Bela, Ferencz Karinthy, etc.:
 moreover an anthology of contemporary Hungarian poetry is being prepared,
 the presentation of which will be at the same level as those of the poems
 by SJndor Petofi and Endre Ady. The commemoration of the revolutionary
 Bulgarian poet N. Vaptzarov has enjoyed wide popularity in the Rumanian
 People's Republic. Reading the collection of Poems published on thi- occa-
 sion, Rumanian readers have come to know and love the poetry of N. Vapt-
 zarov which is pervaded with the pathos of the struggle for freedom and
 peace. Bulgarian literature is also represented by the novels: The Gueratchi
 Saga by Elin Pelin, The Machine and Tractor Station by Andrei Guliasky,
 Laureate of the Dimitrov Prize, and by a volume of BuIsarian Poems. From
 the new Czech and Slovak literature which has been on the upsurge for the
 five years since the February victory of the Czechoslovak people, numerous
 works have been translated among which the famous A Feature Report at
 the Foot of the Gallons by the unforgettable Julius Fuchik, works by out-
 standing prose writers such as. Alois Jirasck and Jan Drda, and the novels
 New Fighters Rise by A. Zapotccky, The Vojachik Family by N. Spetova,
 The Proletarian by Ivan Olbracht, etc. From the literature of the builders
 of new, democratic people's Poland, valuable works, novels awarded national
 prizes have been translated such as: No. 16 Produces by Jan Wilczek, Plewa's
 Example by Bogdan t-camera, The Beginning of the Epic by Marian Brandys
 as well as other works by J. Putrament, S. Rylsly, T. Konwicky, etc. The

 FOREWORD
 The past three years have brought tremendous changes to the lives
 of the Chinese people.
 Such changes, first of all, are the fruits of the victory in the long--
 drawn-out struggle which the Chinese people, led by the Communist
 Party of China and Chairman Mao Tse-tung, had to wage against
 imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism.  These changes
 have been brought. by the restoration and expansion of the country's
 industrial and agricultural production, achieved under the guidance of
 a government that belongs to the people and works for the people.
 To'China's youth, as well as to the people as a whole, such changes
 open up a completely new world of political and democratic rights,-rising
 living. standards, higher wages for young workers, growing income for
 peasant youth, more schools for students, a better life for young people
 among the national minorities.
 Through the continuing improvement in the financial and economic
 situation which enables China to, launch her first Five-Year Plan, an even
 brighter tomorrow beckons to China's young people.
 This pamphlet is intended to give the reader a glimpse of the happy
 life which young people are leading in China today.  It is also to show
 their efforts to prepare a still better future, to show' their unity and
 solidarity with youth in foreign lands, in the name of peace-for China
 and the world!

 CHINA'S YOUNG WORKERS NOW LEAD
 NEW LIVES
 .  Today, when you see the happy life the workers of new China are
 leading, and the elation with which they are building an even better
 future, it is perhaps difficult to believe that, up till a little over three years
 ago, theirs was a miserable lot.  They toiled year in and year out then,
 but never had enough to eat or wear; they were haunted by unemployment
 and had always to worry about the next meal.  Abuses and beatings were
 common, and civil liberties unknown.
 But in new China, workers are the leading class in society.  They
 are represented in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,
 in the people's representative conferences of all levels and in all local
 people's governments.  Many workers have been promoted to leading
 positions in factories and mines.
 The workers have their own organizations-the trade unions.     In
 state-owned industrial or mining enterprises, workers take part in the
 factory administrative committees which have authority over all matters of
 production and management.  These committees are composed of equal
 numbers of representatives of the management and of the workers, giving
 the latter full voice in running the enterprise in questions like production
 planning, business transactions, administration, appointment and dis-
 missal of personnel, wages and amenities, etc.  In private enterprises,
 workers' representatives sit on the labour-capital consultative councils
 which settle disputes and make suggestions or improvements in pro-
 duction.
 The Democratic Reform Movement, carried out in all industrial
 enterprises, helped consolidate the leading role which the workers are
 now playing.  During this movement, the gangsters and bullies who,
 under the_ Kuomintang, had terrorized the workers' ranks, were exposed

 and removed.  With them went all unfair and insulting practices, like
 unequal pay for equal work, searching of workers after their shift,.etc.
 Improved Working Conditions
 In February 1951, the Central People's Government promulgated
 the Labour Insurance Regulations which came into force on May I of the
 same year.  The Regulations has paved the way to a final solution of
 problems that- used to cause workers the greatest'anxiety, i.e., maternity,
 sickness, old age, injury, disablement or death. The Regulations provides
 that "the management or owner of enterprises shall pay to the Labour
 Insurance Fund each month a sum equal to three per cent of the total
 payroll of all workers and staff members in the enterprise concerned;"
 in the case of sickness or injury incurred on the job, the costs of treatment,

 medicines, hospital fees and travelling expenses involved, are borne by
 the management or owners of the enterprise.  When a lineal dependent
 of a worker or staff member falls ill, he or she receives free treatment of
 a clinic or hospital, and the worker pays only 50 per cent of the cost of
 medicines for his or her dependent.  Workers and staff members receive
 old-age benefits on reaching the age of 45, 55 or 60 years, depending upon
 working conditions and whether these are detrimental to the workers'

 health.  Old-age pensions amounting to 35 'tb 60 per cent of the wages
 formerly earned by the worker, are paid until his (or her) death.
 The Regulations gives special consideration to old-age and maternity
 care for women workers.  A woman worker works fewer years and
 qualifies for an old-age pension at an earlier age than a male worker.
 Pregnant women workers receive 56 days of paid maternity leave.  Up
 to the present, 1,600 factory nurseries have been established, and special
 rooms set aside in all large factories for working mothers to breast-feed
 their babies.
 Up to the end of November 1952, 3,202,147 workers and staff
 members had benefited from labour insurance; if their lineal dependents
 are included, the total number is over ten million.  At the same time,
 51 sanatoria, 35 rest homes, 14 homes for the aged and disabled, and
 136 over night-sanatoria have been established in various parts of the
 country for workers and staff members.  The majority of these sanatoria
 and rest homes are located in well-known resorts and scenic spots.

 In January 1953, the Government Administration Council amended
 the Labour Insurance Regulations, raising the benefits and extending the
 scope of labour insurance to greater numbers of workers.
 .  The workers' safety and health receive constant attention.  The
 principle of "safety first" provides safety devices and installations for
 sanitation and hygiene in all industrial enterprises.
 The improvements in such measures achieved in coal mines stand
 out conspicuously.  Gas leakages are now effectively prevented. Safety
 devices have been installed on loading and hauling equipment. Ventila-
 tion systems have been installed in seventy-seven per cent of all active
 mine shafts.  All these have contributed to a decrease in the death rate
 in China's coal mines by 75 per cent, while injuries dropped 65 per cent,
 in the first half of 1951, as compared to 1950.  Not a single mine explosion
 took place during 1951.
 Violet-ray treatment after each shift keeps the miners in good health

 -  Rising Living Standards
 In new China, one of the most important guarantees for the workers'
 livelihood is full opportunity to work.  In pre-liberation days the workers
 suffered from chronic unemployment.      This was particularly true in the
 years of the People's Liberation War. (1946-1949) when, as a result of the
 wanton' destruction under the Kuomintang, the annual output of China's
 heavy industry fell 70 per cent, that of light industry 30 per cent, as
 compared with pre-war peak levels.       As a result, the unemployed and
 semi-unemployed grew to unheard-of numbers.  But, since the founding
 of the People's Republic of China, industry has been rehabilitated and
 developed at an amazing speed, and a large number of formerly unem-
 ployed workers have again found work.  Today, the level of employment
 is the highest in China's history.
 In the wake of this industrial restoration and expansion have come
 remarkable increases in real wages.  In Northeast China, the average
 wages of workers and staff members increased 27 per cent in 1949; 12.5
 per cent in 1950; and about.15 per cent in 1951.  In 1952, workers' wages
 rose in the whole country between 60-120 per cent over those of 1949.  It
 must also be noted' that workers in the new China are paid according
 to their work, irrespective of 'age or sex.
 Workers' real wages have further increased through reduction in
 commodity prices.  One price cut occurred in the period from August to
 October 1951.  Another took place from March to April 1952, when the
 retail prices of manufactured goods were reduced throughout the country
 by 2-40 per cent, with the average reduction amounting to 8 per cent.
 This price reduction meant a 5 per cent increase for the workers in their
 real wages.
 To illustrate the living standards of the Chinese workers, take Wang,
 Ling-hau, a 24-year old steel worker in the Anshan Steel and Iron Plant
 in Northeast China.  Before liberation, life was simply a long chain of
 sufferings for Wang Ling-hau, who for some time had to support his
 family by picking up bits of coal and selling them for a few coins.
 These grim days, however, ended with the emancipation of his plant.
 The constant rise of his wages has made his life better and better.  The
 present situation of Wang Ling-hau may be seen from his balance sheet
 for December, 1952, given in Chinese currency (one wage unit calculated'
 at 2,100 yuan).

 In other words, after paying all his regular expenses, Wing had a
 balance of 729,100 yuan, the greater part of which he put into his bank.
 When he needs anything particular, he dips into his savings. For instance,
 during the latter half of 1952, he bought, among other things, six suits
 of new clothes for himself, his wife and his child, and a new bicycle.
 Actually, Wang's expense account shows only a part of his real
 income.  Everyone who reads through it will note the striking absence
 of one item-rent.  The reason is that living in quarters provided by the
 plant, Wang does not have to pay any rent.
 Besides, the benefits accruing from the Labour Insurance Regula-
 tions must also be taken into account.
 New Quarters For Workers
 Since 1951, large-scale construction of workers' living quarters has
 been going on in the major cities of China.
 In Shanghai, for example, plans then called for building quarters
 for 21,000 families.  Of these, 1,000 families have already been provided
 with living space. Construction of the rest of this project began in
 August 1952 and is scheduled to be completed by May this year.  These
 new quarters are being built in suburban areas and will cover a total
 of 267 hectares, necessitating a total of 145 kilometres of road-building.
 Off they are for a weekend excursion-girls work-
 ing at a hemp mill are trying out their new bicycles

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 In Peking,  Tientsin,  Shenyang  (Mukden),  Wuchang,  Hankow
 and other cities too, tens of thousands of workers' homes are under
 construction, and some are already completed.
 The new tenants are very pleased with their new dwellings. The
 newly-built workers' quarters in Shanghai, called Tsaoyang Villas for
 instance, cover an area of some 13 hectares on the city's western outskirts.
 The project comprises a cooperative store, a clinic- and a primary school;
 a market and a club. The place around the Villas has been beauti-
 fully laid out with streams and small bridges.  Pavements are tree-lined;
 there are flower-beds and spacious lawns all around.  The Shanghai
 Municipal People's Government has established a new bus route . to
 connect the housing project with all parts of the city.
 What a striking contrast this project provides with the appalling
 conditions in Kuomintang -days, when so many workers had no place to
 live at all!  Now China's workers cannot admire their new cozy homes

 enough.  Many young couples have moved into these new quarters to
 start a happy, new life, such as they had never dreamed of before.
 As a result of their higher political and economic status, the workers'
 outlook on labour is completely changed.  This change manifests itself
 mainly in patriotic emulation drives which have developed into a mass
 movement.  In the first half of 1952, over 80 per cent of the workers
 throughout the country joined such patriotic emulation drives.  In these
 campaigns,  the workers have  not only  demonstrated  their  great
 enthusiasm for work now that its fruits are their own; they have also

 processes   and   to   lighten -;
 manual labour. They have put
 forward  altogether    400,000
 rationalisation  proposals, ' of
 which more than 240,000 have
 been adopted, often on a big
 scale. Thanks to the workers'
 growing enthusiasm for labour,
 their  initiative and creative
 abilities,  labour  productivity
 has risen  greatly.  In' coal
 mining, for example, labour
 productivity is now 88 per cent
 higher than before the libera-
 tion.         In Northeast China, a
 142 per cent increase has been
 registered  in  workers'  pro-
 ductivity.
 Young workers play an es-
 pecially active role in theses
 patriotic emulation drives. The
 names of many such young
 work enthusiasts are household words throughout the country.
 Young model worker Cheng Hsi-kun, chief of a locomotive crew in
 Northeast China, is known as one of the sponsors of the drive to have
 locomotives pull more railroad cars than was the practice.  With the new
 method adopted throughout the country, locomotive crews have effected
 tremendous savings for the nation.  Cheng Hsi-kun and his-crew alone
 saved 265 million yuan in' the course of the 2 years ending June 1951.
 Their first record in such extra-haulage was 4,174 tons; they bettered it
 to 8,000 tons and finally to 10,000 tons. On the basis of Cheng Hsi-kun's
 experience and that of many other advanced railway workers, the Minis-
 try of Railways called on railway men throughout the country to start a
 campaign of loading freight cars fully, have the locomotive pull more

 cars and run at least 500 kilometres per day.  At present, railway work-
 ers throughout the country are active in this campaign and have achieved
 tremendous successes.  For example, in May 1952, a youth locomotive
 crew in Shanghai created a new record by completing a daily 1,306.8
 kilometre run.  In the same month, the total extra-haulage in the coun-
 try reached 549 million kilometre-tons, i.e., double the figure hauled in
 March.
 The famous girl spinner Ho Chien-hsiu reduced roller waste to 0.25
 per cent.  It is estimated that her new working method, if applied
 throughout the country, can save 44,460 bales of yarn within a year.  Ho
 Chien-hsiu's working method is now being adopted in all the textile mills
 of China, and her record has already been overtaken by many other
 spinners.
 Twenty-five-year-old Youth League member Liu Li-fu is a brigade
 leader in a dockyard workshop in Dairen.  Under his initiative, his
 brigade put forward 52 rationalisation proposals and created 18 new
 records in 1951 alone.  Thirteen of these new records resulted in the sav-
 ing of 5,000 work-hours during eight months.           Liu Li-fu's brigade always

 overfulfills production targets.  In April 1951, it was already doing its
 norm for September of the same year.  By the end of 1952, it had finished
 the tasks originally scheduled for the 3rd quarter of 1956!  However,
 Liu's brigade maintains a standard of quality as remarkably high as that
 of the quantity of its output.  Since December 1950, its output has there-
 fore been exempted from the usual inspection.  Nevertheless, the brigade
 has not turned out a single defective item.  For this outstanding work,
 the Liu Li-fu brigade has been nominated three times "advanced brigade
 of Port Arthur and Dairen."
 Another fine example is Chen Yu-hua, a pneumatic driller of the
 Huainan Colliery, who has made a name for himself by smashing one
 record after another.  Out of the seventeen new records created in the
 very close emulation drive in the colliery from December 1950 to February
 1951, twelve were Chen's.  Later his national record was beaten.  In

 May 1952, however, Chen won the red banner back with another national
 record, by drilling 291.6 tons of coal in 5 hours and 47 minutes.
 Full Opportunities to Study
 Before the liberation, Chinese workers had little right or opportunity
 of education.  In those days, 60 to 80 per cent of the workers were
 illiterate.  After the liberation, the People's Government laid special
 emphasis on raising the workers' political, cultural, and technical level.
 In June 1950, the People's Government issued "Instructions for Develop-
 ing Spare-time Education of Workers and Administrative Staff" aimed
 at teaching all illiterate workers at least 1,000 characters (ideographs)
 within three to five years so that they could read simply-written books
 and newspapers.  The Trade Union Law stipulates that the manage-
 ments or owners of all enterprises allocate regularly a certain sum for
 the education of workers and staff members.  Thus, the workers are now
 assured the right to education.  At present there are 3,020,000 workers
 studying in 8,900 spare-time schools specially set up for them throughout

 the country.  Beginning from 1952, the plans of many district and
 national trade unions call for the eradication of illiteracy among their
 workers and staff members within two to four years.. In Port Arthur
 and Dairen, Northeast China, illiteracy is practically wiped out.  The
 "quick method of learning Chinese characters", evolved by cultural in-
 structor Chi Chien-hua of the People's Liberation Army, is a great help
 in accelerating the elimination of illiteracy among workers and people in
 all walks of life throughout China.
 Many short-term middle schools have been established everywhere
 in the country to train large numbers of intellectuals of worker and
 peasant origin.  Workers of higher intellectual level are sent to the
 Chinese People's University or similar institutions for advanced studies
 during which they receive 60 to 75 per cent of their original wages.
 Young workers are avid for the technical study the old society
 denied them.  In former days, apprentices did not learn anything but
 ran errands for their masters and received nothing but blows and curses
 as their reward.  Today, master and apprentice have a common goal in
 national development and construction, and are therefore getting along
 quite differently. Very often they conclude "master-apprentice con-
 tracts", under which the apprentice pledges to study technique very hard
 under the master who, in turn, pledges to teach his apprentices well as
 a contribution to the patriotic emulation drive.  In this way, apprentices
 can become skilled workers in a very short time.
 All  larger enterprises have set up regular spare-time technical
 classes, conducted by special teachers, for workers and staff members.
 In addition, many regular technical schools for workers have been
 established all over the country where technique and scientific knowledge
 are taught still more systematically.
 Recreation, the privilege of the few in the past, is now an integral
 part of a worker's life, especially for young workers.  After work, work-
 ers can go to their own clubs to play chess, card-games or ping-pong;
 they form glee-clubs, dance groups, or rehearse stage plays.  They read
 or write in the club library.  Many factories show films or hold dances
 regularly on weekends to enliven their workers' recreation.

 Cultural  Palaces  are  resorts  for  workers on  holidays.  These
 Palaces are mostly the former pleasure grounds of feudal rulers, bureau-
 cratic capitalists or foreign imperialists.                   The magnificent Working
 People's Palace of Culture in Peking, for example, was formerly part of
 the Manchu emperors' "Forbidden City".     Today, these premises afford
 many recreational and cultural facilities, while the tree-shaded park has
 plenty of space for folk-dancing and singing groups.  There is a library,
 a big recreation hall; you can go boating on the moat of the imperial
 palace; in winter, this turns into a skating rink.  A hall is set aside for
 exhibitions; a movie projection team shows films regularly; and the
 lovely, open-air theatre seats 1,500 people.  Workers see plays staged
 here or put on their own performances.  The Amateurs' Art School also
 has a workers' section  at the Palace, where well-known  writers,

 dramatists, musicians, painters and (lancers impart the knowledge of
 their art.  More than 601) worker-students are learning to write dramas
 which often are staged here as well.  Some of the amateur writers show
 great promise in their literary productions, and are sent to the Central
 Literary Institute; While promising actors are sent to the Central Cinemi
 School for advanced courses.  From this amateur school, many workers
 have graduated to become correspondents for newspapers and magazines.
 For the first time in China's history, workers have ample opportunity
 to take part in athletic activities.  There arc nearly 10,000 athletic teams
 organized by workers throughout the country.  In Shenyang (Mukden),
 for example, the 30 workers' basketball teams of 1949 had, by 1951,
 grown to 824.   The railway workers organized  their own national
 athletic association in 1952, and 380,000 of them took part in one or more
 sports during last year.

 Among China's outstanding athletes we now find many workers.
 For instance, workers and peasants took first, second, third and fourth
 places in a 10,000-metre race in the provincial track meet of Chekiang
 province in 1951; the Central-South Region Volley-ball Team, which
 took the first place in the national tournament in 1951, consists mainly
 of workers and peasants.
 Sports are a source of joy and well-being for the workers.  Improving
 their health and refreshing their spirit, they also give impetus to the
 peaceful endeavours of China's builders.
 This Is Only the Beginning
 It may be seen from the above that, in the short period of two or
 three years, the Chinese workers, led by the Communist Party of China,

 have made tremendous achievements on the production front and at the
 same time improved their own life.  But this is only the first step toward
 a brighter future.
 This year, China is beginning her first Five-Year Plan, which paves
 the way for her industrialisation.  The Chinese working youth, who
 constitute an important element of the huge labour force in China, are
 bending every effort to master technique and draw on the advanced Soviet
 experiences.  They are taking an increasingly active part in the nation-
 wide campaign to increase production and practise economy, so as to
 accumulate more wealth for the country and at the same time raise their
 own living standards.

 YOUTH IN THE CHANGING VILLAGES
 If you have ever seen the Chinese countryside before liberation and
 heard the tragic stories of Chinese peasants, then the radical changes
 that have since taken place will astound you on a visit today.  These
 changes can be seen in the thriving villages, in the peasants themselves
 whose looks show that they are on the way to prosperity, in their new
 confidence in life and its promise, and in the ineffable love and gratitude
 they bear for Chairman Mao, the Communist Party and the People's
 Government.
 All these changes have been brought about by the great land reform
 movement, through which millions of tillers, led by the working class,
 have won back their land and other means of production, instead of eking
 out a miserable living at the mercy of the landlords.  Now they are
 tilling their own land happily in order to make life still more prosperous.
 The Road from Poverty to Prosperity
 The land reform awakened peasants to the fact that farming scat-
 tered, individual plots of land was fettering the expansion of production.
 Therefore, with the help of the People's Government, increasing numbers
 of peasants have voluntarily organised mutual-aid teams, whose members
 still maintain the individual ownership of their land, but work it collec-
 tively to the benefit of one and all.
 To date, there are three principal types of mutual-aid organisations
 in existence:  the temporary, or seasonal, small-scale mutual-aid team;
 the regular year-round mutual-aid team; and the agricultural producers'
 cooperative, the last being the highest form in which both land and labour
 are pooled.
 As the peasants had long been accustomed to farming scattered,
 individual strips of land, it naturally took some time before they came
 to realise the advantages of collective farming. But young peasants, par-
 ticularly members of the New Democratic Youth League who can most

 An agricultural producers' cooperative of Tahming County, Hunan Province,
 is reaping a bumper harvest
 easily assimilate new ideas, have set the pace for the mutual-aid and
 cooperative movement, often being the first ones to join.  These young
 people also take the initiative to explain patiently to others the significance
 of collective labour for an increase in agricultural production.
 Actual facts too, have convinced many peasants that organised
 farming brings bigger harvests and incomes, and is therefore the only
 path to bring them from poverty to prosperity.  As a result, mutual-aid
 and cooperative organisations have mushroomed in rural areas.  At
 present, over forty per cent of China's peasantry are organised in 6,000.-
 000 mutual-aid teams, and more than 4,000 agricultural producers'
 cooperatives are in existence.
 Patriotic Bumper-Harvest Campaign
 For their own benefit, as well as for the benefit of the nation, the
 masses of China's peasants have launched a nation-wide patriotic emula-
 tion campaign for increased production.  This campaign has produced
 countless model peasants who, in groups or individually, have reached
 remarkable results.

 Tsui Yu-hsia, 20-year-old girl and Youth League member of Suining
 county in northern Kiangsu province, is one of those who have gained
 nation-wide fame through their record crops.  In 1951, her team brought
 in a wheat crop of 336 catties* per mout on arid land, about 100 catties
 more than the record crops in the locality.  In 1952, accepting the
 challenge of other teams, Tsui Yu-hsia's increased its general output to
 343.8 catties (or fifty per cent over that of local peasants), and even to
 527.5 catties on a few mou of land. For these outstanding achievements
 Tsui Yu-hsia's team was commended twice by the Ministry of Agricul-
 ture.  Through her influence, the villagers started a "Tsui Yu-hsia Mutual-
 Aid Movement," in the course of which the number of peasants organised
 for collective farming rose from ten to sixty per cent.
 Yang Ching-kuei of Peisui county in Kiangsu Province is another
 young model peasant famous for his bumper harvest.  By using high
 quality seed and improved farming techniques, his team scored a record
 :One catty is equivalent to about half a kilogram.

 harvest of 6,339 catties of potatoes per nrou, or three and a-half times
 the local record.  Yang Ching-kuei himself managed to harvest 7,476
 catties per rnou on his own land.  His team has received commendations
 from the Ministry of Agriculture.
 For the bumper harvest drive, the Government extends its assistance
 through huge loans.  To encourage increased output per unit area, the
 Government exempts from all taxes that portion of the crop which exceeds
 the average in a given area.  Fair prices have also been set on agricul-
 tural products, so as to assure a proper income to the peasants.  A large
 number of stations have been set up to popularise the use of new farm
 implements, and technicians at these stations stand ready to show
 peasants their use.  Some of these implements have been loaned to
 advanced mutual-aid teams so as to show others how to handle them.
 Furthermore, the peasants are given opportunities to pool their experience
 in agricultural production with the advanced agro-techniques of state
 farms, while their own experience is, at the same time, popularised all
 over the country by the People's Government.

 All these factors have made it possible to speed up the restoration
 and development of agricultural production. In 1952, the output of grain
 of China was nine per cent, and that of cotton fifty-five per cent higher than
 the highest pre-war record. It must be remembered that before liberation
 China used to import rice.  From 1951 onwards, however, she has been
 able to export one shipment of rice after another to India and Ceylon.
 The output of hemp, tobacco, silk, tea, fruits, etc. has also surpassed all
 pre-war levels.  Now China can meet her people's need for food and
 industrial crops completely without importations from abroad.
 At the same time that the bumper harvest campaign got into full
 swing, the peasants flung themselves into the great battle against floods,
 the centuries-old menace to their lives and property.
 In the interest of millions of peasants, the People's Government has
 undertaken great water conservancy works. The sum spent for this pur-
 pose was in 1950 eighteen times, in 1951 forty-two times, and in 1952
 fifty-two times the highest annual figure under the Kuomintang regime.
 Statistics reveal that 1,700,000,000 cubic metres of earth have been moved,
 an excavation equivalent to that of 10 Panama or 23 Suez canals. Repairs
 have been made on 42,000 kilometre of main dykes, and work to eliminate
 floods completely has begun on many rivers.
 The greatest water conservancy work undertaken by the People's
 Government is the Huai River project.  This harnessing job will trans-
 form nature, free within three to five years five and a half million people
 living on the 210,000 square kilometres of the Huai River Valley forever
 from the threat of floods, irrigate 40 million mou of farm land, improve
 navigation on 1,000 kilometres of inland waterways, and generate tremen-
 dous hydraulic power.
 Millions of peasant-workers have taken part in this project since its
 start in the winter of 1950-1951.  This labour army, inspired by the
 prospect of mastering Nature for the common good, has displayed great
 patriotism and obtained astonishing results.  Many new names have been
 added to the list of model workers through this gigantic project.
 Twenty-year old Youth League member King Hsiu-lan is the daughter
 of a former poor peasant.  In pre-liberation years, her family had been
 driven into destitution when floods caused crop failures. After liberation,
 the life of her family has been getting better every day.  In 1950, when
 Chairman Mao issued the call "The Huai River must be harnessed!"
 King Hsiu-lan immediately went to work on the project selflessly.

 Once  she  led  a  brigade  of  peasant  labourers  to  dredge  a
 heavily silted-up swampy stretch of more than 650 metres in length, 50
 metres in width and 5 metres in depth. This was a rather difficult job
 for the mud was so deep that it was almost impossible to get it out. But
 King Hsiu-lan led the brigade to try again and again until they had
 worked out a new method and succeeded in dredging 300,000 cubic metres
 of mud from the bog.
 This achievement greatly inspired the more than ten thousand
 workers engaged in the same type of work with new confidence.
 Thanks to the creative efforts of all the river-tamers, the first two
 phases of the project were completed by July 1952, involving 287 million
 cubic metres of earthwork, not counting another 220 million cubic metres
 which the peasants had moved to irrigate their own fields.  Already the
 changes brought about -in the Huai Valley are tremendous.     Since the
 spring of 1951, peasants have each year reaped crops such as they never
 had before.
 Life is Improving Day by Day
 The fruits of the peasants' free labour are their steadily rising living
 standards.
 This 1,054-metre sluice-gate is part of the vast water conservancy project
 completed in 75 days on the middle reaches of the Yangtse River.  This
 project includes a flood detention basin capable of holding 5,500,000,000
 cubic metres of water

 The improvement in the peasants' life can best be seen in their rising
 purchasing power. In the past, industrial goods had seldom reached the
 countryside. Now the peasants have become the chief customers for indus-
 trial goods. There is a daily increasing demand in the countryside for
 such items as toilet soap, flashlights, bicycles, and thermos bottles which
 the peasants could not afford before. Now they buy sugar, glassware,
 shoes, stockings, cigarettes, hand towels, etc., in large quantities.
 It is also worth noting that the peasants are able to invest an in-
 creasing portion of their income to expand production.  For this reason,
 there is a growing demand in the countryside for draft animals, farm
 implements, seed, fertiliser and other means of production.
 Culture Follows the Plough
 In pre-liberation days, peasants had no access whatsoever to educa-
 tion, and their overwhelming majority were illiterate. Since liberation,

 as a result of improved economic conditions, the peasants have an urgent
 demand for cultural enlightenment.
 Winter is a slack season for production, but a busy season for studies.
 In 1951 more than 42 million peasants attended winter schools; in 1952
 there were 50 million attending such schools.
 After these winter schools, the peasants can continue their studies
 in regular spare-time schools in their villages.  The total enrollment of
 this type of school was 14 million in 1951 and 24 million in 1952.
 Nowadays, cadres of peasant origin, like the workers, are enrolling
 in large numbers in primary and secondary short-term schools, the
 People's University, and other educational institutions.
 Aside from learning to read and write, peasants now study also
 current affairs, agricultural science, sanitation, government policies and
 other matters closely related to their life and productive work.
 They now have many cultural activities too.  Small libraries stocked
 with popular reading materials exist in many villages.  While there were
 only 4,939 such village libraries in 1950, their number increased to 15,000
 by 1952.  There are now 1,800 cinema teams dividing their time between
 shows in  factories  and  in  rural  areas.     Yangko  dance  groups,
 dramatic groups and clubs have been organised by the peasants them-

 selves everywhere. Through these activities, peasants both find entertain-
 ment and learn many things useful to know in the still more wonderful
 days ahead.
 Rural Women Now Emancipated
 For generations, Chinese women had been ground underfoot by
 feudalism.  But the agrarian reform has given them ownership of land,
 so that they are no longer economically dependent on men but on an
 equal footing with men.
 The Marriage Law is another boon to women, particularly in the
 rural area. In the old society, for a girl to have a love affair was a
 scandal, and marriages were arranged by parents and go-betweens with-
 out the young people's consent.  Married women were often ill-treated
 and many of them felt so unhappy in their marriage that they committed
 suicide.  But now the shackles with which feudalism bound China's
 women are being broken.  Young men and women in the countryside
 are free to choose their mates for life among those whom they meet
 through work and study.  Marriages and happy homes are now the result
 of love and mutual respect between the partners themselves.
 Life is happy for this young peasant couple, married through their own
 free choice, not by arrangement of their families as in the old feudal
 society.  Working together diligently, they have been able to buy a pony
 and build this house for themselves

 The emancipated women are doing their part in tilling the land
 side by side with the men folk.  Many of them have distinguished them-
 selves as model peasants or been chosen for leading posts in peasant
 associations and the people's representative conferences.  Women are
 being looked at with a new respect.
 The peasants of new China have made life worth living through
 their ardent labour so that they now can look forward to a brighter to-
 morrow.
 At present, there are 52 large mechanized state farms in China.
 These sprouts of socialist agricultural economy in a people's democratic
 society are growing with great vitality under the tender care of the people.
 With state farms setting the example, and tinder the leadership of the
 working class, peasants have begun to organise their own collective
 farms.  Now, more than ten such farms are in existence.  Their chief
 means of production such as land, farm implements and draft animals
 are owned by the people collectively who work in a spirit of collectivism
 and are paid according to the work done.
 The gradual mechanisation of collective farms means less and less
 heavy manual labour for the members, raises the productivity of the land,
 and thereby makes their life a much happier one than before.
 State farms and collective farms are now held up as the target to-
 wards which new China's agriculture must develop.  They point the way
 to a still better and more prosperous life for the masses of peasants
 throughout the country.

 CHINA'S STUDENTS FACE A BRIGHT FUTURE
 Chinese students have a glorious revolutionary tradition.  Under the
 leadership of the Communist Party, they have taken an active part in the
 people's struggle for national independence and liberation.  Today, when
 this struggle is crowned with victory, students are enjoying the full rights
 of citizens, thanks to the People's Government, the Communist Party
 and Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
 Education Open to Worker-Peasant Youth
 Old China had few schools and those that existed were poorly
 equipped.  The children of the wealthy naturally could get an education;
 but the masses of workers had little if any chance.  The fact that 80 per
 cent of the Chinese population was illiterate highlights the deplorable
 state China found herself, under the long years of reactionary regime.
 Today, the People's Government focuses its attention on education
 for the masses.  Chairman Mao has said, "We want not only to change
 a politically oppressed and economically exploited China into a politically
 free and economically prosperous China, but also to change a China
 which has been under the rule of the old culture and was thus kept
 ignorant and backward into a China that will be under the rule of a
 new culture and will thus become enlightened and progressive.  In a
 word, we want to build up a new China."
 In liberated China, therefore, though a thousand and one other things
 clamour for attention, the People's Government is making every effort to
 further educational tasks, to rehabilitate schools destroyed by the Kuo-
 mintang and set up new ones. At the same time, the success of the land
 reform, the development of our national economy and rising living
 standards enable the working people to send their children to school.
 Under such favourable circumstances, education has progressed in
 every respect.  A chart showing the increasing number of students will
 illustrate this fact:

 All educational institutions open their gates to workers and peasants.
 At present, students of worker or peasant origin constitute over 80 per
 cent of the total enrollment in primary schools; about 60 per cent in
 secondary schools; and more than 20 per cent in higher educational
 institutions.  This phenomenon, unprecedented in China's history, is
 the result of a series of measures taken by the People's Government to
 ensure that the labouring people's children have the opportunity to receive
 education.
 On October 1, 1951 the Government Administration Council announ-
 ced the "Decision Concerning the Reform of the Educational System,"
 one of the salient features of which is the reform of the primary school
 system.  In'the past, primary schooling was divided into two stages, the
 first covering 4 years and the second, 2 years.  Schools in the country-
 side were mostly of the first type only.  Accordingly, what many peasant

 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 children could get at the utmost were four years of education.  But the
 new system provides that primary school covers a total of 5 years (instead
 of six in two separate stages), and thereby enables the children of work-
 ing people, in both town and countryside, to complete their primary
 education.                  -
 In order to give government employees of worker or peasant origin
 the proper education that will provide highly qualified personnel for
 China's industrialisation, the People's Government has set up special,
 short-term secondary schools.  The school period covers only 3-4 years,
 but there the students can complete the main courses of regular secondary
 schools and go on to college.  In 1950, the People's Government began
 to set up higher educational institutions of a new type, the first being
 the Chinese People's University.  This University combines Soviet
 experience with China's actual needs, enrolling students of worker or
 peasant origin who now make up 78 per cent of the whole student body.
 Thirsty for knowledge, these students make very high grades in their
 studies.  Li Feng-lien, a famous model worker, for instance, came to this

 (CIA-RDP80501540R002900080004-4
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03
 CIA-RDP80SO154OR002900080004-4
 Li Feng-lien studies at the Chinese People's University together with Li
 Yung-chun, one  of those who completed the famous Long March from
 Kiangsi to Yenan in 1935
 University at the educational level of a second grade of primary school.
 After two years' study of preparatory courses, she reached the level of
 a second-year student in secondary school.  In other words, she finished
 a six-year curriculum in only two years! Carried by such enthusiasm,
 Li Feng-lien is bound to make a success of her college courses to prepare
 herself well for her place in the build up of new China.
 Since the liberation, the children of the labouring people have been
 provided with the material means to pursue their education.  As of 1952,
 the greatly improved financial and economic state of our country has also
 made for great improvements in the students' living conditions.  The
 People's Stipends have been considerably increased for students in
 secondary schools and above.  At the same time, while all students of
 technical secondary-schools, normal schools and institutions of higher

 CIA-RDP80SO1540R002900080004-4
 learning receive such monthly subsidies, cadres of worker-peasant origin,
 as well as industrial workers who attend school, receive larger amounts.
 The Government provides, therefore, not only the tuition fees and food
 expenses for all students in these educational institutions, but gives therm
 also pocket money to spend.  Now these students can concentrate on
 their studies without fear that economic difficulties will force them to
 leave school.
 Health conditions among students were appalling under reactionary
 rule. Most students were unable to stay healthy partly through poverty
 and partly because the reactionary rulers confined students to their
 classrooms in order to cut them off from the outside world, and overloaded
 curricula to the point where the students' health gave out.
 In the new China, children and young people are brought up to be
 self-reliant, intelligent and healthy, capable of shouldering the difficult
 tasks involved in building up their country. The students' health, there-
 fore, is a problem that receives great attention. The "Decisions Concern-
 ing the Improvement of the Health of Students" announced by the People's
 Government in September 1951 stipulate clearly the number of study
 hours allowed each day, so that the students are assured enough rest
 and sleep.  The Decisions also contain special instructions concerning
 measures of hygiene, sports and recreational activities in the school, as
 well as improvements in the students' diet.
 Sick students are given special care.  In Chiaotung University, for
 example, since the liberation students suffering from tuberculosis rest in
 special convalescence rooms, and receive the People's Stipends as usual,
 together with special  allowances  for  nutritious food,  cod  liver  oil
 and other medicines.  The University authorities have also set tip a
 special kitchen for the patients with a nurse looking after their diet and
 well-being.
 Theory Combined with Practice
 Apart from being provided with the afore-mentioned facilities, the
 Chinese students are also enabled in every way to acquire useful know-
 ledge for the task of national construction.
 Education in old China served the interests of foreign imperialists
 and domestic reactionaries.  What the students learned often had little
 to do with China's realities. Educational institutions were set up here
 and there without regard to actual needs of the locality or the country
 as a whole.  Many colleges had a variety of overlapping departments,
 so that man-power and materials were largely wasted.  Curricula were

 China's rich, underground resources have yet to be utilised.  These students
 of the Peking Geological Institute certainly know what they are studying for
 impractical, graduates were too few in number and their scholastic level
 too low to meet the needs of the country's industrialisation and build-up.
 In order to get rid of these irrationalities, readjustments have in the
 past three years been made in colleges and college departments, with
 special emphasis on engineering colleges so as to meet the country's
 urgent needs in large-scale economic construction.  Through these
 re-arrangements, departments of geology, mining, mechanical engineer-
 ing, metallurgy, aeronautics, etc. have been set up as special schools
 teaching these subjects.  This readjustment has already brought remark-
 able progress in our college education. The number of industrial colleges
 has increased from 33 to 44, their student body from 48,000 to 68,000.
 At the same time, engineering students now constitute a much greater
 proportion in the total college enrollment of the country.  While they
 made up only 18.9 per cent in 1946, now the percentage has risen to 35.4,
 the highest place among all branches of study.

 In order to bring about a more effective division of labour as required
 for large-scale capital construction, industrial colleges adopt advanced
 plans for college education in conducting special courses with definite
 aims, so as to train large numbers of specialists.
 Students are helped in many practical ways in their studies.  Every
 summer vacation, many students of engineering and technological subjects
 do practical work in large factories and mines.  Plans are mapped out
 beforehand by factory and mine managers and engineers and technicians
 appointed to guide these students in their practical work.  During the
 period of practice, workers are ready to extend the students a helping hand
 and pass on their own experience.  Thus, when they leave the factory or
 mine, the students find their store of book-learning much enriched by
 practical knowledge.
 Rest and Recreation
 Through solicitude for the students' health and spirit on the part of
 the People's Government, athletic and recreational facilities have greatly

 increased in all schools.  Recreational and athletic activities of all sorts
 and on a large scale are organised under the guidance of the student body.
 Physical culture is a required course in all schools.  The People's
 Government requires all students to do at least one hour of athletics every
 day.  The students themselves know very well that, aside from intellectual
 training, they need a healthy body to take part in their country's develop-
 ment.
 In many schools, sportsfields which formerly seemed excessive are
 now too few in number to hold the increased influx of players, and eager
 students have set up new playgrounds for themselves.  Regular athletic
 meets are held in all schools.
 The People's Government has also allocated large sums to build
 sportsfields outside of schools. Sportsfields large enough to accommodate
 100,000 spectators have been opened in Canton, Wusih, and Chungking.
 In the public parks of many cities, playgrounds are laid out for children.
 One such newly-built playground in Peking can hold 4,000 young players
 at the same time.  All these facilities help students and young people in
 general to build up their bodies, and provide them with health recreation.

 Summer vacation is the time for all students to go in for recreational
 athletic activities in a really big way; summer camps being the most
 popular. Summer resorts are filled with the students' songs and laughter,
 while they are dancing or hiking.  But they also attend lectures on
 literature and science; interview model workers, combat heroes, writsrs
 and scientists, combining serious endeavour with joyful living.
 Swimming on the beaches or in swimming pools has become a
 favorite summer sport among Chinese students.  The People's Swimming
 Pool in Peking accommodates 4,000 persons.
 It should be mentioned that students receive the People's Stipends
 during vacation time as well as during the school year, and special allow-
 ances are granted them for camping or trips.
 After such vacations, students begin the new school year with fresh
 vigour and in still higher spirits.
 Enjoying Democratic Rights
 Under the reactionary regime of former days, students had no demo-
 cratic rights, and social activities of any form were brutally suppressed.
 The reactionaries wanted students to be bookworms indifferent to social
 questions.
 Today, students are assured full rights. Apart from joining the Youth
 League which has its branches in all schools, students also have their
 own organisation  the All-China Students' Federation.  In schools, they
 elect students' associations as the basic units of the Federation.  These
 associations, aside from looking after the students' welfare, assist school
 authorities in matters of study.
 When the People's Political Consultative Conference opened in
 September 1949, the All-China Students' Federation sent nine representa-
 tives and one alternate on behalf of the students of the country.                     In
 various places students also send their own representatives to the local
 people's representative conferences and people's political consultative
 conferences.  All these representatives who are elected by the students
 themselves sit side by side with the people's representatives from all other
 walks of life in electing their own government, and discussing and
 deciding upon important policies of the State.
 Freedom of speech and publication being the right of all citizens of
 China, students' federations of various regional levels publish their own

 papers; students' associations in the schools also have their own papers.
 Through groups like broadcast teams, quick-verse groups, publicity
 groups, correspondents' groups, etc. the students express their opinions,
 make inquiries of, make suggestions to, and criticise, their own associa-
 tions, the school authorities and government organs.
 A Boundless Future Ahead
 In the days of reactionary rule, the students had a saying, "Gradua-
 tion means unemployment."  A vacancy for a small clerical job often
 brought college graduates, including students of engineering, into keen
 competition.  Beset by financial difficulties, fear of unemployment, the
 students floundered in the darkness of oppression, without a ray of
 hope.
 Today, graduates from higher and intermediate schools are serving
 on all sorts of projects in the nation's building according to their own
 capacities and the needs of the country.  Students find jobs arranged for
 them by the People's Government ahead of their graduation.
 Economic and cultural developments on an ever-growing scale make
 for a growing demand for personnel everywhere.  Within the next few
 years, educational institutions throughout the country are expected to
 turn out large numbers of specialists of all fields.
 To meet this demand, many new educational institutions have been
 founded.  Old ones have added to their libraries and laboratories and
 erected new buildings; Tsinghua University alone in 1952 built a total
 floor space of over 43,000 square metres, or 46 per cent of the total built
 in the past 40 years.  The new buildings include classrooms, workshops
 for mechanical, automobile, and gas engineering, a metal workshop for
 the civil engineering department, students' dormitories, quarters for the
 teaching staff, a mess hall seating 2,500 people, etc.
 This gives a glimpse of the tremendous development in the people's
 education and of the bright prospects in store for all young Chinese
 intellectuals who are ready to serve the people.
 The Chinese students of the Mao Tse-tung era are confidently
 marching towards a radiant future. They are studying hard for a common
 goal: to build up their Motherland to make it ever stronger and more
 prosperous.

 NEW PROSPECTS FOR NATIONALITIES
 Just off the highway on the western outskirts of Peking, several
 palace-like buildings house the Central Institute for Nationalities, in
 which young men and women of 34 national minorities are gathered
 from 23 provinces in China.  The atmosphere in this multi-national
 family is one of fraternal unity.  The young people wear their different
 national costumes, dance their own national dances, and sing in their
 own language, in praise of Chairman Mao Tse-tung whose leadership
 has made possible the joyous life they are now leading.  Small wonder
 that they are cheerful and smiling all the time!
 Equality and Liberty
 Like the Han people, the national minorities obtained a happy life
 only after liberation.  In the past, they were discriminated against,
 oppressed and exploited by the reactionary rulers.  They were backward
 economically and culturally; even mere survival was difficult under the
 high disease rate.
 Chairman Mao's policy towards nationalities brought liberty and
 equality.  In his opening speech at the first plenary session of the Chin-
 ese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949 he stressed: "Our
 conference is composed of more than six hundred delegates, representing
 all China's democratic parties and groups, people's organisations, the
 People's Liberation Army, various nationalities and overseas Chinese."
 This was a great event in China's history, the beginning of friendship
 and cooperation among all her nationalities.
 The Common Programme of the Chinese People's Political Consulta-
 tive Conference contains the definite stipulation that "Greater nation-
 alism and local nationalism shall be opposed.  Acts involving dis-
 crimination, oppression and splitting the unity of the various nationalities
 shall be prohibited."  And that "All national minorities shall have free-

 dom to develop their spoken and written languages, to preserve or
 reform their traditions, customs and religious beliefs."
 According to the Common Programme, all nationalities, under the
 unified leadership of the People's Government, are free to administer
 their own affairs in any way they like to adopt. At present, in most areas
 where national minorities are concentrated, regional autonomy has been
 established and autonomous organs set up through the convocation of
 people's representative conferences.  In places where different nationali-
 ties live together, democratic coalition governments have been established
 through people's representative conferences of all the nationalities con-
 cerned.  Available statistics show that, up to June 1952, 130 national
 autonomous regions and more than 200 democratic coalition govern-
 ments had come into being.  Of these, the Inner Mongolian Autonomous
 Region had been set up as early as May 1947.
 Life Changes
 In the past, the Kuomintang's reactionary policy of oppression and
 plundering left the national minorities in extreme poverty.  Reactionary
 government officials carried off their products for a mere song, but sold
 daily necessities to them at exorbitant prices.

 Young people in Inner Mongolia have a future as bright and boundless
 as their steppes
 Now the situation is quite different.  Local products fetch fair prices.
 For example, in Sining, Chinghai Province, 50 kilograms of local wool
 were formerly exchanged for only 8 yards of cloth; since liberation, they
 exchange for more than 80 yards.  In Tating, Kweichow Province, the
 Miao people used to get only 12.5 kilograms of table salt for as much as
 50 kilograms of twig oil, but now they can buy 80 kilograms of table salt
 for the same 50 kilograms of tung oil.  Thus, the national minorities'
 purchasing power has risen greatly.  That of the nomadic people in
 Sinkiang, Chinghai and Ningsia provinces, for example, is six or seven
 times what it used to be before liberation!
 The People's Government has also helped them improve their agri-
 cultural methods and livestock farming.                 In Inner Mongolia, in 1951,
 the average propagation rate of livestock reached 85.69 and the survival
 rate from 90 to 100 per cent, all new records without precedent.  In some
 places of this region, the number of livestock today is double, triple or
 even quadruple that of 1945.
 These factors have remarkably improved the economic life of the
 national minorities.  Needless to say that, through the rapid expansion

 of China's economy as a whole, life among her nationalities will grow
 still better and happier.
 Shedding the Shackles of Disease
 One of the worst evils of the past during successive reactionary
 regimes was the prevalence of disease among the minority people, which
 accounted for a decline in their populations.  Liberation is gradually
 eliminating this scourge of disease.  The Central People's Government
 has set aside special allocations for health work in minority areas.  In
 early 1952, health centers and clinics restored or newly set up in counties
 where minority people constituted 50 per cent or more of the local popula-
 tion numbered 187.  As the minority people are scattered far and wide
 or live a nomadic life, many medical, epidemic prevention and health work-
 ers' teams have been sent into their areas for curative and preventive
 purposes, as well as to help setting up basic medical institutions and to
 carry out propaganda work on sanitation and hygiene.  Furthermore,
 in order to make up for the scarcity of medical personnel in these areas,
 the Central People's Government, while sending in batches of health

 workers, is bringing many young intellectuals from among national
 minorities for study into medical colleges and schools.  Plans have also
 been worked out for the establishment of short-term medical classes and
 institutes in minority regions.
 Out of the Abyss of Ignorance
 Past reactionary regimes pushed minority people deeper and deeper
 into ignorance and backwardness.  Children and young people were
 deprived of educational opportunities.  After the liberation, the Central
 People's Government has done much to develop culture and education
 among national minorities.  Supplementary appropriations are provided
 for this purpose, aside from regular expenditures as schools elsewhere
 in China now receive.  In the past three years, education has greatly
 developed in national minority regions, and more and more of their young

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :

 people are enabled to attend school.  At present, the number of primary
 schools in Inner Mongolia alone is 4,084 with an enrollment of more than
 321,000 students, i.e. over three and a half times the peak level during
 the Japanese occupation.  In the Yenpien Region in Northeast China,
 about 92 per cent of school-age children among the Korean national
 living there are now attending school.  In the national minority regions
 of the whole country, there are over 9,100 primary schools with a total
 student body of 738,000; 92 regular secondary schools; 21 normal schools;
 3 technical secondary schools; and one short-term secondary school for
 workers and peasants.
 The language of the nationality concerned is used in all these
 schools.  The Central People's Government published more than 2,200,-
 000 copies of 176 books in the various national minority languages in
 1951, and another 4,300,000 copies of 376 books in 1952.  In the course
 of the year ending March 1952, the Sinkiang People's Publishing House
 alone brought out 1,730,000 copies for minority people, including trans-
 lations of the "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung," text books, magazines,
 literary, scientific and other works.  In Sinkiang, Inner Mongolia, the
 Yenpien Region, and other areas, the minority people read newspapers
 and listen in radio programmes in their own languages.  The Com-
 mittee of Cultural and Educational Affairs has set up the Committee for
 Research into the Spoken and Written Languages of National Minorities,
 which assists in creating written languages for those among the nation-
 alities which do not have any of their own, as well as in perfecting
 those written languages that need improvement.
 The national minorities have a rich cultural heritage, especially in
 music and the dance.  The Miao people are famous for their "moon
 dance" and the Uighurs are known as a "dancing nationality" for whom
 dances and songs have become inseparable parts of life.  The dances and
 songs of minority people, most of which describe romances, historical
 events or celebrate the harvest, are all characterised by simplicity and
 the expression of healthy, joyous emotions.  This invaluable artistic
 heritage receives great attention now, and its national forms have been
 enriched with new, democratic content.
 Since the people of national minorities have become their own
 masters, a large number of cadres from among their own people are

 needed for building up the various autonomous regions.  The scarcity
 of manpower caused by the reactionary rule of the past is now being
 overcome.  The Central People's Government is paying great attention
 to the training and promotion of cadres from among national minorities.
 To this end, eight branches of the Central Institute for Nationalities in
 Peking have been set up in Northwest, Southwest and Central-South
 China.  These institutions to (late have a total of more than 3,700 stu-
 dents from 50-odd different nationalities.  Training classes and schools
 have also been set up for the same purpose.  Colleges and schools in all
 parts of the country admit young people of national minority origin on
 a  priority  basis,  and make special allowances for them.  Korean
 nationals residing in the Yenpien Region have a university of their own.
 The inhabitants of Inner Mongolia, too, will soon have a well-equipped
 one.
 These young people show unparalleled enthusiasm and thirst for
 knowledge, coupled with love and admiration for the greatness and

 family, and this has given them greater faith in the unity and equality
 of all nationalities.  The rapid development of China as a whole presages
 the bright future that is in store for their own nationality.  Therefore,
 they are determined to work and study still harder so that, under the
 great banner of Mao Tse-tung, they like all others may contribute a
 growing share to their country's build-up, as well as to the prosperity of
 their own localities.

 FOR PEACE AND INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP
 The happiness of China's youth today is the result of long-drawn-
 out struggles for which many laid down their lives.  This happy present
 in peace and security is made precious by this sacrifice. But to say that
 the Chinese people love peace, does not mean that they are waiting for
 peace to drop into their laps.  Peace has to be won by action.
 Since October 1950, when U.S. imperialism fanned the flames of
 aggressive war closer and closer to China's border, the Chinese people
 in general, and youth in particular, have stood in the forefront of the
 struggle against the war-mongers.  To protect their motherland and to

 defend world peace, the Chinese people sent their best sons and daughters
 -the Chinese people's volunteers-to fight shoulder to shoulder with
 the Korean people and the Korean People's Army.  The volunteers, heirs
 to the revolutionary tradition of the Chinese people, have proved both
 their patriotism and internationalism in Korea.  The names of many
 heroes among them are on everybody's lips.  Take, for instance, young
 volunteer Kuo Chung-tien whose platoon, with only light weapons and
 hand grenades, heroically stood one whole day against an enemy force
 armed with 80 tanks and other heavy weapons and protected by large
 number of planes, killing hundreds of the enemy without a single casualty
 in their own platoon.  Or pilot Chang Chi-hui who shot down several
 U.S. planes including that of Major Davies, the "ace pilot" of U.S.
 imperialism. Or "The Chinese Matrosov", 21-year-old combat hero Huang
 Chi-kuang, who covered the advance of his comrades-in-arms by throwing
 himself against the fire-spitting loophole of the enemy's pillbox.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/03 :
 CIA-RDP80S01540R002900080004-4
 The heroism of the volunteers expresses itself also in their loving
 care for the Korean people.  Many fighters have risked their very lives
 to help them in an emergency.  One example is 19-year-old Lo Sheng-
 chiao, who dived into a hole in a frozen river to save a drowning Korean
 boy, but sacrificed his own life. There are many such stories of heroism
 coming from the Korean front all the time, too many to be all told in detail.
 The reason for the heroism of these young Chinese is that they know
 what they are fighting for: to defend and protect the happy life and the
 rights already attained by China's younger generation.  China's youth
 will never allow the U.S. imperialists to trample underfoot the fruits it
 has gained in more than thirty years of bitter struggle.
 The valiant fight of the Chinese people's volunteers alongside the
 Korean People's Army during the past two years and more has been

 Huang  Chi-kuang  throws  himself  against an  enemy  pill-box and stops
 the machine-gun fire
 dealing heavy blows to the U.S. invaders, thwarted their plot to enslave
 the Korean people and to encroach upon people's China.  This valiant
 fight enables us to carry out large-scale construction as planned in all
 parts of our vast country, to create and build an ever happier life through
 our own toil.  The victories scored by our volunteers also inspire the
 peoples in oppressed countries with confidence that their struggles for
 freedom and independence will be victorious.  They are the symbol of
 victory for people everywhere in the world in the struggle for peace.
 Active Peace Signature Collectors
 In 1950, when the Permanent Committee of the World Peace Congress
 first issued the Stockholm Appeal, China and its youth demonstrated
 their support with 223,730,000 signatures.  In 1951, the number of peo-

 ple, youth and all, who affixed their names to the Appeal for the Conclu-
 sion of a Five Power Peace Pact totalled over 343,800,000.  Simultane-
 ously, the Chinese people launched a campaign against the militarisa-
 tion of Japan and for an over-all peace treaty with Japan, the voters in
 which numbered over 339,650,000.
 China's youth flung itself into these campaigns and played a great
 rnie in advancing them.  For example, the young people of Harbin car-
 ried out extensive propaganda among the masses after the World Peace
 Council issued the Appeal for a Five Power Peace Pact.  As a result,
 19,000 Youth League members collected 213,000 signatures in that city
 alone.
 Another outstanding fact is that nearly all students in Peking signed
 this Appeal.
 International Friendship and Solidarity

 of youth in other lands, facts of which are widely popularised through

 various publications.  In order to strengthen the contact and under-
 standing between the youth of China and other countries, publications
 are exchanged with youth organisations abroad.
 The frequent exchange of youth delegations with other countries also
 helps to strengthen the understanding of other parts of the world and
 binds the young people of China to young friends in far-away lands, a
 great contribution to the world peace movement.
 So far, Chinese youth delegations have visited 20 countries, while
 47 countries have sent youth delegations to China.
 Soon after the founding of the People's Republic of China, in 1950 a
 Soviet youth delegation, headed by Mikhailov, and a cultural group
 visited this country upon the invitation of the New Democratic Youth
 League of China.  In the same year, upon the invitation of Soviet youth,
 a Chinese youth delegation also visited the Soviet Union.  This exchange
 of delegations has not only afforded China's youth an opportunity to
 learn from the precious experiences of young people in the Soviet Union

 in socialist construction; it has also further enhanced the friendship and
 solidarity between the youth of China and of the U.S.S.R.
 The biggest youth delegation ever to visit China was the delegation
 of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, comprising 42 delegates
 from 32 countries.  They came to China in 1950 on the invitation of the
 All-China Federation of Democratic Youth.   The delegation attended
 the National Day Celebration of the People's Republic of China, then
 visited eighteen of the country's major cities.
 In 1951, the Chinese young people sent a big delegation to participate
 in the Third World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace which took
 place in Berlin.  In this great demonstration of friendship and solidarity
 of youth, China's youth joined 25,000 youth delegates from over 100 coun-
 tries and 2,000,000 young German people and, together with them,
 pledged unanimously: " . . . to dedicate all our strength to struggle
 to prevent a new war. . . .
 The young people of China will continue to work for friendship and
 solidarity with the youth of other lands and actively participate in the
 struggle for world peace.  They warmly support the resolutions of the
 Congress of the Peoples for Peace held in Vienna in December 1952.
 They stand ready to support these resolutions with deeds.

 Chinese Youth Celebrated Youth Day
 On May 4th this year, the youth of China joyfully
 celebrated their own festival day, Chinese Youth Day.
 The May Fourth Movement of 1919, well-known
 in Chinese history, came about under the influence
 of the great October Socialist Revolution.  Two years
 after the Movement, in 1921, the Chinese Communist
 Party was founded.  From then on, the Chinese revo-
 lution has taken on an entirely new character.  The
 May Fourth Movement marked the close of the era of
 China's Old Democratic Revolution and the beginning
 of the epoch of the New Democratic Revolution.
 The May Fourth Movement fully demonstrated
 the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese youth. Hun-
 Areds of thousands of students took part in this move-
 ment, forming an important force in the revolu-
 tion.  Since then, under the guidance of the Chinese
 Communist Party, Chinese youth have played their
 part in all the historical periods of the revolution.
 For this reason, May 4th has been observed every
 year as Chinese Youth Day.
 The Chinese New Democratic Revolution, begun
 with the May Fourth Movement, has already won
 great victories under the leadership of the Chinese
 Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
 As a result, the People's Republic of China was
 established in 1949.  During the past three years
 and more, our country has carried out a series of
 social reforms; both industrial and agricultural pro-
 duction have been restored and developed; a funda-
 mental turn for the better, has been achieved in the
 financial and economic condition of our country.  All
 this has created favourable conditions for our large-
 scale economic construction.
 In the test of revolutionary struggle and con-
 struction work, very many young people have shown
 their excellent qualities of heroism in battle, skill
 in labour and diligence in study.  From among them
 there have emerged a multitude of brilliant heroes
 and models whose exemplary activities and creative
 labour have played a tremendous role in the cause
 of the revolution.
 Young workers have enthusiastically participat-
 ed in the patriotic emulation campaign to increase
 production.  A great' many inventions and creations
 of young workers are being adopted and popularized.
 Such young workers as Ho Chien-hsiu, the inventor
 of a scientific spinning method, and Cheng Hsi-kun,
 the initiator of the extra=haulage drive on China's
 railways, have made tremendous savings for the
 nation  through  their  conscious,  creative  labour.
 Among the 81,000 Youth League members working
 on the railways, nearly 19,000 were awarded prizes
 for their outstanding work last year.
 Young workers are particularly keen on studying
 techniques.  Young miner Ku Fa-ming, by learning
 from` advanced Soviet experience, has established a
 national record by sinking 75 metres of shaft in one
 month.  Young technical instructor Peng Hsung-fu
 has worked out a teaching method which enables
 an apprentice to acquire within three months the
 fundamental  knowledge  and  technique  of  lathe
 operating which used to take two to four years .
 formerly.
 Likewise, young peasants, who make up one-
 fourth of the rural population of China, are playing
 an important part in agricultural production.  Of the
 four million and more Youth League members in
 the countryside, three million have .joined mutual-
 aid and cooperative organisations, and many are
 entrusted  with  leading  responsibilities.  Together
 with the broad masses of peasant youth, they have
 plunged into the patriotic movement for        bumper
 harvests.  Young farmers are among the first       to
 apply up-to-date farming methods.  According to the
 statistics for the four provinces of Northeast China,
 some 200,000 young peasants received agrotechnical
 training last year.  The drive to learn advanced
 farming technique has resulted in remarkable in-
 creases  in                                                                        agricultural  output.  The  mutual-aid
 team led by the young model peasant Chen Yi-ko,
 for instance, has reaped one good harvest after ano-
 ther ever since its formation in 1949.  Its average
 rice crop in 1952 was about 62 per cent above the
 previous year's record.
 Young intellectuals are working energetically in
 workshops, laboratories and farms.  In Anshan alone,
 more than 1,000 college students have been assigned
 to different jobs.  Educated in New China, these
 young intellectuals know how to link theoretical
 knowledge with the workers' and peasants' practical
 experiences.  Chou Chuan-tien, Vice-Director of An-
 shan's Iron Smelting Plant, came fresh from college
 just three and a half years ago.  By cooperating
 with other technicians and workers, he has succeed-
 ed in producing, from low-grade ores, basic pig iron,
 the top quality material for making steel.  His ad-
 vanced method has contributed much to the metallur-
 gical industry in Anshan.
 While engaged in peaceful construction, Chinese
 youth always bear in mind the volunteers who are
 defending  their  homeland  by  resisting  the  U.S.
 aggressors in Korea.   Chinese youth know that it
 is the gallant fight of the volunteers that has created
 the conditions for the peaceful construction of their
 country.  The noble examples of such martyrs as
 the  19-year-old  Lo  Sheng-chiao,  who  dived  into
 a frozen river to save a drowning Korean boy but

 sacrificed his own life, and the 21-year-old Huang
 Chi-kuang, who covered the advance of his comrades-
 in-arms by blocking with his own body the fire from
 the. loophole of the enemy pillbox, have given great
 impetus to the constructive efforts of the tens of
 millions of young people at home.
 The May Fourth Youth Day this year was mark-
 ed by the fact that China has entered upon the first
 year of a new historical stage-the stage of large-
 scale, planned construction.  The commemoration of
 Youth Day, therefore, took on special significance.
 While celebrating this day, Chinese youth are active-
 ly preparing for the Second All-China Youth Con-
 gress and the Second National Congress of the New
 Democratic Youth League of China, which will be
 convened in June this year.  These congresses will
 define the orientation and tasks of the youth move-
 ment in the new stage of national construction, the
 tasks of educating the Youth League members and
 the broad masses of youth to develop their creative
 initiative under the leadership of the Chinese Com-
 munist Party and Chairman Mao, and, together with
 the whole people, to defend the great Motherland
 and strive for her industrialisation.
 Explorers of Hidden Riches*
 Over the vast territory of China, in places never
 before trodden by man, there are now often seen
 groups of travellers.  Climbing hazardous mountains
 .and wading through streams and living in the wilds,
 sometimes for months and months on end, these
 people have come to the remotest parts of the coun-
 try to probe the hidden riches that have `lain undis-
 turbed for centuries.                The people rightly call them
 "pioneers" of the country's economic construction, for
 in their footsteps will arise numerous new factories
 and mines, railways and highways, reservoirs and
 power stations, on a gigantic scale.
 The old China was described as "a beggar with
 a? gold alms-bowl."  Many people were bitter about
 the fact that, for all her vast territory and rich re-
 sources, China was unable to free herself from pri-
 vation and want.  True, there were some people who
 dreamed of exploring the underground treasures, and
 a few others who even carried out geological work.
 But all hopes could only turn into despair when the
 Kuomintang reactionaries were treacherously selling
 out the nation's resources to the foreign imperial-
 ists.
 Anyone who ever concerned himself with the
 mineral wealth of China can never forget the popular
 belief that China had but poor oil reserves.  Authori-
 ties were cited, and theories referred to, in affirm-
 ing this view.  Investigations made after liberation,
 however, have shown with ample proof. that China
 abounds in this essential material.  All the supposi-
 tions of the past had only one aim: to create a
 highly profitable market for the oil products of the
 imperialist countries.
 In semi-feudal and semi-colonial China, geologi-
 cal workers were shut behind academic doors and
 their studies confined to palaeontological researches.
 Practical work was almost unknown, so that up till
 three or four years ago, the real state of China's
 underground resources was still unknown.
 Three years is but a drop in the ocean of history.
 Yet during this time China's geological work has
 gone much further than in any other historical period.
 At the Tayeh iron mine, Hupeh province, for in-
 stance, as much geological work was done in eight
 months last year as in the sixty years since the
 working of the mine began.
 Fruitful results have already been achieved. New
 finds have been reported daily from various parts of
 the country.  The coal reserves in Northeast China
 alone have been proved to be ten times greater than
 the previously  accepted  estimates.  A  large  coal
 field has been discovered in the coal-mining area of
 Kiangsi province that will have great importance
 for industry in Central-South China.     One of the
 big iron ore mines of North China is now known
 to have a reserve ten times greater than had been
 supposed. . Extensive new data have been gathered
 about the iron ore and magnesium deposits in the
 Northeast, China's greatest steel centre.
 In their effort to locate the hidden treasures of
 the nation, geologists have found helping hands
 among the broad masses of the people. The. Ministry

 of Geology is constantly receiving letters from young
 and old, reporting new finds of ores.  In Northeast
 China, the search for minerals has grown into a
 patriotic mass movement.  Five shepherd boys in
 the mountains of Kirin province recently discovered
 a rich deposit of antiptony in that area and a new
 mine now stands on the site of the discovery.
 This year, with ? the commencement of China's
 first  five-year plan,  work in  the geological  field
 will be on an even bigger scale.  There will be ten
 times more drilling operations than in 1952, twenty-
 three times more trenching and twenty times more
 underground exploration, while the area to be geolo-
 gically surveyed will increase tenfold.
 This spring, an army of almost ten thousand
 geological workers set out to various parts of the
 country for a deep and far-flung investigation of
 China's mineral deposits.  The number of geological
 and palaeontological teams working in the field has
 increased to the present eighty or more as compared
 to the twenty-nine in 1950.  Many of these parties
 are equipped with the most up-to-date  machines,
 sometimes with laboratories to conduct experiments
 and workshops to repair the boring machines right
 on the spot.
 The geological workers are well aware of the
 great responsibilities placed on their shoulders, and
 they work with the utmost enthusiasm.
 Here we shall mention the story of Team No. 241,
 which belongs to the Ministry of Geology, and of which
 young people make up a good part.
 The  team  has  been  working  in  a  certain
 mountainous region  in  North  China, where    a
 rich iron ore mine is located. Life was extremely
 hard for these "pioneers" when they came here in
 1950.  There were neither houses nor water, and they
 had to set up tents and sink wells with their own
 hands.   The working site being quite isolated from
 the outside world, everything the workers needed
 had to be transported from a town over a hundred
 kilometres away.  In the rainy autumn season when
 the muddy roads made traffic more difficult, the
 workers had to live on short supplies, sometimes
 going without such essential food as salt and vege-
 tables.  Even more intolerable were the winter days,
 when the temperature fell far below freezing point
 and the field work had to go on without interruption.
 The "pioneers" have shown wonderful persever-
 ance             in  conquering all  these hardships.  In this
 respect, the seventy-odd Youth League members are
 highly spoken of among the team.  Nineteen-year-old
 League member Chiang Pei-ning is one of those well-
 known figures on the work site.                 Once, on a night
 shift, he led a drilling group to work on the derrick.
 It was in the depth of winter, the thermometer read-
 ing forty degrees below zero.  Though with their fur-
 lined coats and gloves on, the workers could not
 help shivering with cold.  Three big stoves were set
 up around the derrick, but the heat was too little to
 make itself felt.  It would be better if the drillers
 were working on the ground, in which case they
 could warm their hands every other moment at a
 stove placed by their side. But now they were work-
 ing on the derrick twelve and a half metres high to
 screw up the drilling rods, so that they had to take
 the trouble of coming down every two or three
 minutes to take the chill off their fingers.
 Work dragged on very slowly, and there was
 a danger that the task could not be accomplished in
 time.  At this prospect, Chiang Pei-ning was greatly
 troubled. Calling on his fellow workers not to lose
 any time, he himself stubbornly clung to the job and,
 his fingers having lost all sense of feeling, kept on
 turning the drilling rods with his palms instead.
 That night, altogether some twenty pieces of drill-
 ing pipes had been assigned to the group for screw-
 ing. Chiang alone had done more than ten pieces,
 each consisting of three 3-metre-long rods.
 The young workers are not only brave in work,
 but also keen in studying technique.  Again take
 Chiang Pei-ning for instance.  He came here as an
 apprentice  in  drilling.  After thirteen months  of
 diligent study, he showed remarkable competence in
 work and was promoted to group leader.      Further-
 more, he passed on his knowledge to two other ap-
 prentices,                                                                            who. thus  succeeded  in  raising  their
 technical level to that of a group leader within seven
 months-nearly one half the time it had taken Chiang
 himself to do so!
 The wat'kers ardently draw on the advanced
 Soviet  experiences.  The drilling  brigade      led  by
 young Liu Hsun has learned the Soviet high-speed
 drilling method, by which they overfulfilled their
 production quota.  Now they are making efforts to
 popularize the Soviet method of cleaning drill holes
 with clay fluids.
 As a. result of the selfless work of the "pioneers",,
 already fifteen drill holes with a total depth of over
 4,500 metres had been made by the end of last year.
 Up to' the present time, enough data have been col-
 lected to prove that the iron ores here are of a high
 grade, and that they are so deposited as can be
 readily explored by means of the up-to-date open
 face mining method.  It is being planned to erect a
 gigantic iron and steel plant in the vicinity of this
 mine area.
 Now the work site is no longer a place of desola-
 tion as it was three years ago.  Apart from the in-
 creased number of machines and equipments, there

 are a repair shop, a storehouse, a dining hall, a
 bath-house, a library, a cooperative store, dormitories
 and other establishments for the workers, as well as
 a road running to a nearby railway. *This year will
 witness an even more rapid development of work.
 The scope- of drilling operations alone will increase
 tenfold compared with last year.
 Thousands More to Join Their Ranks
 Although much has already been done by the
 geologists in the past three or four years, work in
 this field still lags behind the needs of China's large-
 scale economic construction.  To make up this deficit,
 thousands of new personnel are being trained in this
 branch of science.  New colleges of geology have
 been established in various parts of the country.
 Under the Kuomintang rule, the geological depart-
 ments of the universities were poorly equipped, had
 few professors and students were offered courses in
 general theory only. By contrast, the new Peking
 College of Geology alone already has a student body
 which far exceeds the total number of geology students
 of the whole country in the past.  It has departments
 of mineralogy and petrology, general survey and
 prospecting, hydro-geology, engineering geology and
 geophysical exploration.  Large quantities of labora-
 tory equipment have been ordered.  Ten teams of
 students led by experienced instructors have already
 brought back  120,000 specimens for the college's
 own use.  During the next few years, the student
 body will be increased manyfold.
 The eagerness with which the young people
 plunge into geological  studies promises a bright.
 future for China's geological development.  This is
 what Wang Yi-sheng, a student of the Geological
 Department of the Northwest University, has to say
 about his feelings:  "We love every inch of our
 homeland, and we're filled with confidence in our
 future career. ?We  feel proud that  we'll  become
 'pioneers' in our country's economic construction. . . .
 When we think that two years from now we'll be
 travelling over our boundless territory to explore the
 inexhaustible riches of our motherland, we are even
 more energetic and happier in our studies."
 Young Builders on Futseling
 A truck took me to the Futseling dill, about 17
 kilometres to the southwest -of Huoshan County town,
 Anhwei Province.  It was a sunny day in April.  The
 hillsides were studded with fiery red flowers in full
 bloom.  The Pi River, in which was reflected the
 cloudless sky, skirted the hills like a winding blue
 ribbon. Here a reservoir was being built, one of the
 many undertakings of the Huai River Project.
 The Futseling was a scene of seething activity:
 over ten thousand people engaged in intense labour,
 hundreds of roaring machines, trains "Of tip-waggons
 running on a network of narrow-gauge railways. Yet
 how could one imagine that this valley had been
 a haunt of wild animals only two years ago?
 "Inhabitants here were few and far between,"
 a young worker, who seemed to have lived some-
 where in these parts, told me during his break.
 "We often saw tigers coming down the river side
 in the mornings.  After nightfall, we'd shut our doors
 tight, for fear that the wolves might enter the house
 and seize the children.  But now the wild beasts have
 been scared away by the explosions and the roar of
 machines."
 The Pi River is a tributary to the south of the
 Huai River.  With its source in the Tapieh Mountain,
 it winds its way through many steep gorges, flowing
 gently for most of the year.  But beneath its calm
 surface danger lies. When the rainy season sets
 in, huge torrents will sweep down the mountains and
 pour into the river, overflowing the banks of its lower
 reaches and adding to the flood of the main water-
 course of the Huai.  Since time immemorial, this
 has caused repeated crop failures over a vast area
 of fertile land.
 Reactionary rulers in the past never thought of
 averting this disaster.  Today, under the people's
 regime, the blind forces of nature are being sub-
 jugated to man's will.  The dam now under construc-

 Lion at Futseling aims at forming a natural reservoir
 in the valleys.  Covering an acreage of 23 square
 kilometres, it will hold 500 million cubic metres of
 water, which, when needed, can again be used for
 irrigation.  Thus, more than 33,000 hectares of land
 will be guaranteed rice harvests and brought under
 winter  cultivation  for  wheat.  In  addition,  the
 harnessed water is capable of generating up to 8,000
 kilowatts of electric power for industrial and civilian
 purposes.
 The building of a dam for such a huge reservoir
 is naturally a complicated job, which requires high
 technical standards and has never been tackled before
 in ' China's history of water conservancy.
 With multiple arches, the dam will be 516 metres
 long and 70 metres high.  At first, some engineers
 doubted as to whether some precise calculations con-
 cerning this stlucture could be made at all.  But
 Tsao  Tsu-sheng and  Wang Min-lien,  two young
 technicians graduated from college not long ago,
 had complete confidence in the task. Drawing on
 Soviet experience and carrying out research work
 by themselves, they finally made the calculations with
 the help of the workers.
 I had the opportunity of meeting Wang at the
 construction site.  He is a thick-set, suntanned and
 taciturn youth.  I asked him how he could have coped
 with such a difficult job.  "By learning," he said
 laconically.
 Yes, all builders here are learning and working
 at the same time, and that's why
 they often refer to the construc-
 tion site as "Futseling Univer-
 sity." When work started in early
 1952, there were only about 1,000
 technical workers here.  In the
 course of a year, this "Futseling
 University" turned out a  new
 technical personnel of 2,000, who
 are now masters of hundreds of
 machines of various descriptions.
 "I  was a  peasant and    had
 never seen this sort of machine
 before," a young worker said to
 ine, pointing at a concrete-mixer.
 "I was not a little puzzled the
 first time I saw it.  Then the
 Party organizer came up  and
 said  to me, 'Learn while you
 work!'  After some time, I could
 handle the machine as easily as
 1 did the plough back home."
 And this was the same case with
 others at Futseling. I came across
 some young builders clothed in yellow-green uniforms.
 They were members of the People's Liberation Army.
 Many of them, I was told, had fought guerrilla wars
 in the Tapieh Mountain against the Japanese invaders
 and later in the world-famous Huaihai Campaign
 against the U.S.-equipped Kuomintang forces in 1948.
 Having wiped out these enemies, they were now
 waging another fierce battle, this time against Nature.
 With unmatched courage and perseverance, they have
 quickly learned how to operate pneumatic drills and
 lay narrow-gauge railways.
 A Women's Brigade
 My attention was drawn by a group of girls at
 work on a boring machine.  This is the nationally-
 known "March 8th" Boring Brigade, the first of its
 sort in China.                  It consists of 17 girls, all under
 the age of 23.
 A girl dressed in a greasy overall with two
 swaying plaits was lifting up the brake bar, while
 another jotted down some figures in her record book.
 A third was standing on the frame, shouting some-
 thing to her fellow workers above the din of the
 turning machine.  When she got down, I ventured
 to ask her how she felt at such a dizzy height.
 "Nothing different from on the solid ground," sh'
 said cheerfully. "But the first time I climbed, my legs
 felt rather weak. I held fast unto the frame, as if
 a light puff of wind would bring me down.  Now
 we've all got used to climbing."
 "These girls work just as well as men," an old
 technician named Liu Wen-ping told me.   "When

 me with questions: what's gone wrong with the
 drilling rod, how do you get it out, and so on
 and so forth.  I conducted a course on repairs
 right on the spot, and at such a time of the
 night!  When the class was over, it was already
 daylight."   I could see that the, old man was
 very proud of these hard-working girls.
 they came here last May, I must say that I wondered
 if this heavy job would suit them.  But in three
 months, they mastered the technique of boring, which
 had taken me three years to learn in the past!  They
 studied with such enthusiasm that on many occa-
 sions I had to stop them from overworking.  But it
 was no use.  One midnight, the boring machine broke
 ,down and I was woken up to repair it. When I
 set out for the working site, I heard footsteps behind
 me.  It was the girls, who had heard about the
 incident and got. out of bed!  `You aren't needed
 there.' I said to them. `Better go back to sleep. You've
 a lot of work to do tomorrow.'  But they followed me
 doggedly.   'Let's just watch how you repair the
 machine so we can learn a thing,or two.  How can
 we get to sleep when missing such a good chance?
 We won't interfere with your work, to be sure.' Weil,
 when I set the machine to rights, the girls showered
 The builders of Futseling are learning new
 techniques  and  creating  new ways of  doing
 things.  During the past year, they have put
 forward a total of over 400 rationalization pro-
 posals and thereby saved 7,000 million yuan for
 national economy.  For their outstanding feats
 of labour, 176.builders have been honoured with
 the title of model workers.  Shao En-lu, a young
 technician of the No. 1 Boring Brigade, improved
 the machine and increased threefold its rate of
 revolution.   A  brigade     of  pneumatic  drill
 operators utilized 100,000 pieces of waste bit and
 saved 900 million yuan.          A group of masons
 invented a machine for sifting stones and saved
 2,000 million yuan ... .
 I arrived at Futseling when all workers there.
 were in the thick of an emulation drive in honour
 of the coming May Day.  They were greeting their
 own festival with new labour records.  A group of
 workers  from  Shanghai had  just  completed  the
 installation of some sluice gates 12 days ahead of
 schedule.  A brigade of concrete workers, in close
 cooperation with the transport workers, could then
 fill in 30 cubic metres of cement in each shift, or
 one and a half times as many as they could before-
 The navvies had doubled, and in some cases trebled,
 the efficiency of their excavating work.
 As a result of this enthusiasm and creative Tabour,
 the dam is gradually rising from the ground, steady
 and foursquare.  After  a few months, there will
 stand in this valley a giant of concrete and steel,
 preventing floods from  destroying  crops,  lighting
 up men's happy faces and setting numerous machines
 in motion.

 The Girl at
 The day shift had just begun at the Long Dis-
 tance Telephone Exchange of the Tientsin Telecom-
 munications Office.  As usual, 22-year-old Kuo Hsiu-
 yun was at the switchboard right on time.  She put
 on her earphones and began to operate the keys with
 her left hand even before she had time to sit down.
 The nimble motions of her fingers reminded one of
 a skilled pianist.  There are quite a few things an
 operator has to attend to: calling, listening, operat-
 ing the dial and the keys, connecting and discon-
 necting  the  circuits. . . .  But  to  Kuo  Hsiu-yun
 doing all this presented no difficulty. As though
 magically, the thick files of tickets on her board
 were quickly disappearing, while she kept herself
 well at ease all through her work. Whereas it took
 an ordinary operator on the average 237 seconds to
 connect a call, Kuo Hsiu-yun did it in only 81.78
 seconds.
 Kuo Hsiu-yun has been working at this exchange
 since 1945, when she was 15 years old.  In the days
 of reactionary rule, she was looked upon as some-
 thing of a robot, a part of the machine.              Day in and
 day out she repeated the same mechanical movements
 at the switchboard and considered her work dry and
 dull.  In fact, constantly humiliated and threatened
 with dismissal, the girl had even begun to loathe
 her  job. Moreover,  meagre  wages  coupled  with
 soaring prices made even a mere subsistence dif-
 ficult.
 After liberation, Kuo Hsiu-yun began to notice
 a    new  world  about her.  The gangmasters who
 had once tyrannized the workers disappeared. The
 new foremen, elected from among the workers them-
 selves, showed vital concern for the interests of the
 workers.  Whenever a problem arose, whether of ad-
 ministrative or technical nature, the workers were
 always asked to speak out their opinion.  Prices be-
 came stable, and the workers' wages were constantly
 on the increase.  For the first time, Kuo Hsiu-yun
 tasted the joy of living, and with it the joy of working.
 In the winter of 1949, Kuo Hsiu-yun was given
 a chance to attend a short-term training course,
 where she acquired fundamental knowledge relating
 to the history of social development and Chinese
 revolution.  She came to appreciate the meaning of
 labour and the noble responsibilities of the working
 class towards the society.  It was not true, she
 realized, that the work of a telephone operator held
 no future, as she had always believed.  Work that
 served the people was always valued highly by the
 people.
 As never before, Kuo Hsiu-yun put her heart into
 her work.  But at that time she still could not see
 the Switchboard
 any possibilities of goi4 any farther than just con-
 necting and disconnecting telephone circuits in the
 same old way.  "If you're to create or invent any-
 thing," she thought, "you've got to have lots of
 theoretical knowledge.  For an ignorant person like
 me, I don't think there's any sense in dreaming of
 such things."
 Facts, however, gradually changed her ideas.
 After the liberation, countless numbers of model
 workers emerged from among the ranks of the ordin-
 ary working people, people who differed little from
 her 'either in age, intelligence or nature of the work
 they were doing.  What really mattered, she found,
 was that these model workers, spurred by patriotism,
 had a will to conquer difficulties, to exploit every and
 all ways and means to produce more for the nation.
 So she decided that she could improve her work also
 if she only tried.
 One day, a man asked to be connected with a
 leading cadre of a certain government office in
 Peking.  Kuo Hsiu-yun kept trying for four days, but
 failed owing to some trouble with the latter's tele-
 phone.                                                                         Filled with anxiety, the applicant pleaded:
 "Comrade operator, mine's really a very urgent
 business call, but I'm too busy here to go to Peking
 personally.  Can't you find a way out?"
 Formerly, there was nothing unusual in that a
 call could not be put through for several days.  But
 now things were different from what they had been.
 Kuo Hsiu-yun thought of the leading cadres of go-
 vernment organs who toiled day and night for the
 good of the people, of the serious effects that might
 be caused by failure to keep them informed in time.
 Urged by a strong feeling of responsibility, she rack-
 ed her brain for a way out.  At last, she succeeded
 in reaching the person called through another tele-
 phone at his office.  The party calling up Peking
 could not thank her enough for her good service.
 For a long time afterwards, Kuo Hsiu-yun kept
 reflecting on this incident.  She realized more clearly
 than ever before that she was doing something really
 very important, something to be proud of.  For years,
 her accordion had been her only joy in life.  But now
 she was just as happy with her old, once thoroughly
 disliked companion-the switchboard.
 In 1950, she was transferred to another position,
 responsible for passing and receiving calls to and
 from Shanghai.  Traffic was much heavier here, and
 often more tickets piled up than could be disposed
 of.  Kuo Hsiu-yun was greatly disturbed by this
 situation.  At the end of each day, there always re-
 mained a few calls that had not been put through.
 As she cancelled or postponed these calls to a later

 Model worker Kuo Hsiu-yun whose operating method is being spread
 throughout the country
 date, the anxious faces of the callers would float
 before her eyes.  She tried to work faster, but only
 made more mistakes.  Once she was even criticized
 by an operator at the other end for her inaccuracy
 in timing conversations.
 The cause of the error, she later found out, lay
 in the fact that there was no proper system worked
 out of timing conversations.  So she began to pay
 particular attention to this matter.  Every time after
 a call had been put through, she would keep moni-
 toring over the line in order to calculate more ac-
 curately the time elapsed.                 This she managed quite
 well, but soon she encountered new difficulties.
 Kuo Hsiu-yun was in charge of four circuits.
 Important as monitoring over these circuits was, it
 was after all but a part of an operator's work.  For
 instance, while monitoring over one of the circuits,
 she could hardly at the same time devote her atten-
 tion to working on another circuit, such as putting
 through a long-distance call.  She often felt lost,
 especially when signal lamps flashed angrily, de-
 manding to be quickly attended to.  "If I could only
 attend to two circuits at a time!" she was wrapped
 up with anxiety.
 After many a sleepless night, Kuo Hsiu-yun re-
 called an incident.
 It had happened some time ago.  She was hold-
 ing the key at the talking position to speak with a
 long-distance operator on the other side, when some-
 one by her side suddenly asked her a question.  Turn-
 ing about to answer, Kuo Hsin-yun operated another
 key to the monitoring position, meaning to cut off
 the  connection  with  the  distant  terminal office.
 Strangely  enough,  however, she
 could still hear the voice of the
 other operator.  This surprised her
 but she did not mind it very much
 then.
 Moved by a desire to improve
 her work, she now began to ponder
 over  the  matter.  "Doesn't  this
 show that it is possible to do two
 different things simultaneously over
 two circuits?" she asked herself.
 Her idea turned out to be prac-
 ticable.                                                                                            With  one  key       in  the
 monitoring position and another
 in the speaking position, she found
 that she could put long-distance
 calls on one circuit and simul-
 taneously                                                                                            monitor over    another
 Similarly, she saw that she could
 do other things while checking on
 the circuits by turn.  Thus she got
 along with  her  work with     far
 greater ease than before.
 But Kuo Hsiu-yun was not satisfied with what
 she had achieved. She was now considering another
 problem:  how to make the best use of the limited
 number of circuits in order to meet the demands of
 the growing traffic.
 To achieve this, she decided to reduce the time
 needed to connect a call.  Before putting a call
 through, she would first notify the operator on the
 other side of the calls coming after, so that after the
 connection had been completed, the latter, making
 use of the time when the conversation was going on,
 might get the next call through.  Kuo Hsiu-yun then
 kept monitoring, and when she saw that the conversa-
 tion was drawing to a close, she would make arrange-
 ments for the next call.  In this way, calls were
 always promptly put through and followed one an-
 other  without interruption.  The circuits were  no
 longer wastefully engaged by the operators, but were
 available to long-distance callers almost all the time
 -52 minutes out of every hour when three circuits
 were in operation!
 Kuo Hsiu-yun is against everything that impedes
 the progress of work.  She opposes operators who
 pay less attention to inward calls.  These people
 care only for the narrow interests of their own office,
 since in the cases of inward calls, the charges are
 collected by the other side.  Their reluctance to re-
 ceive assignments, she considers, is a stumbling block
 to smooth tele-communications service.
 Kuo Hsiu-yun holds that in the interests of the
 subscribers, the operators of both terminals should
 co-operate closely with each other.  She always tries
 her best not to inconvenience the operator on the

 other side.  Every time a. call is over, she first turns
 the splitting key to the neutral position and contacts
 the other operator, and only then turns to the work
 left behind by the finished call. As a result, the
 operator on the other side seldom finds any difficul-
 ties in passing calls to her.
 The whole nation followed Kuo Hsiu-yun's suc-
 cesses with keen attention.  Her working methods
 have been summarised after three months of sys-
 tematic study by the Ministry of Posts and Tele-com-
 munications and the National Committee of the Chi-
 nese Postal, Telegraph and Telephone Workers' Trade
 Union.  Steps are being taken to apply her working
 methods to twenty tele-communications offices in the
 major cities of the country.  It has been estimated
 that the adoption of Kuo Hsiu-yun's working methods
 by a long-distance telephone tircuit will enhance its
 efficiency by 22.62 per cent, and coasequently, if her
 working methods are applied on all the trunk lines
 of the country, the effect produced will be equivalent
 to that of a 22.62 per cent increase in the equipment
 of these lines.  In other words, it will mean a saving
 of 387,300 million yuan in the state's expenditure for
 capital construction.
 Kuo Hsiu-yun's brilliant achievements have won
 her the title of Model Worker, apart from bonuses.
 In October 1952, she was admitted into the New
 Democratic Youth League.  Later, her fellow workers
 elected her member of the Administrative Committee
 of the Tientsin Telecommunications Office as well as
 chief of the Women Workers' Department of the Trade
 Union Council.
 Kuo Hsiu-yun has set a fine example to her col-
 leagues all over the country, who are not only study-
 ing her advanced working methods but are also
 emulating  her  spirit  of  responsibility,  her  high
 enthusiasm for labour, her ardent desire to serve the
 people.
 Chinese Delegates Give Their Impressions of the International
 Conence for the Defence of the Rights of Youth
 I feel it a great honour to have participated in
 the great gathering of the world youth-the Interna-
 tional Conference for the Defence of the Rights of
 Youth.  The Conference enabled me to acquire a bet-
 ter understanding of the situation of our young
 friends in other countries, as well as to appreciate
 more fully the significance of the happy life we Chi-
 nese young people are living.
 During the Conference, we had friendly talks
 with some young delegates from other countries, who
 told us about their own life.  A Canadian girl spinner
 said that she was having a hard time at home.  Wo-
 men workers in Canada, she remarked, are paid less
 than men, though they do the same work.  With the
 meagre wages, they cannot even buy enough bread.
 Still worse are the conditions of youth, who are de-
 prived of the opportunity to study, and are made to
 toil all day long without knowing what will become
 of them in the future.  "To demand improved living
 conditions, we'd a strike some time ago," she said.
 "For that, I was arrested and jailed for over two
 months.  Since then, I've been unemployed."
 We shared her anger on hearing her story, which
 bore much resemblance to our own past.  Liberation
 put an end to our miserable days, and made possible
 a better and better life for us.
 Take the case of my working place-the Long
 Distance Telephone Exchange of the Tientsin Tele-
 communications Office.  Apart from the increasing
 wages, which are paid according to work done irres-
 pective of age and sex, we can say a lot about the
 welfare for the workers, particularly for the women
 Workers.  Here we have rooms specially set aside for
 working mothers to breast-feed their babies; a roomy
 nursery with a full staff of ten or twenty, including
 the doctor and the nurses; two mess halls, one for
 ordinary workers and the other for women workers
 after childbirth and for those who need special diet;
 a spacious playground with a variety of sports equip-
 ment; a cosy club which will be expanded before
 long; a spare-time rest home which is being set up.
 The management also pays great attention to our
 studies. Teachers have been specially employed to
 run our spare-time classes.
 And I thought of myself. A girl of only twenty-
 two, formerly a "low-bred" sort of person, and now
 a model worker hailed by the people!  Could this
 ever have happened if it were not for the leadership
 of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party?
 And could I ever have had the honour of taking part
 in such an important meeting as the International
 Conference for the Defence of the Rights of Youth?

 I remember the seeing-off party specially held in
 our office before my departure for the Conference.
 The responsible comrades of the Party, the Youth
 League, the Trade Union and the management all
 expressed their congratulations, bidding me to do my
 best in the Conference.  All my fellow workers asked
 me to bring to the Conference their desire for peace
 and their wishes for the success of the Conference.
 To express their support for the Conference, they
 pledged to redouble their efforts in work.
 But I learned entirely different experiences from
 young friends of capitalist and colonial countries,
 who
 had
 to break through all kinds of barriers to
 come
 to
 Vienna.  The Italian delegates said that
 thirty
 out
 of the forty persons who had wanted to
 come
 had
 been refused passports.  Only two Cuban
 delegates had managed to get to the Conference.  In
 Japan and Syria, none of the delegates could obtain
 passports.
 All this impressed me very much.  At the Con-
 ference, I gave a report on the happy life of the
 Chinese young people, their zealous labour for the
 building up of their country, their ardent desire for
 peace, their concern and support for the struggles of
 their brothers and sisters in other lands for a better
 life.  Those at the meeting listened with great inter-
 est.              After I had finished my report, they swarmed
 around me, kissed and embraced me warmly.  We
 were all deeply moved.  We had no words to express
 our feelings, but we understood what we had to say:
 peace, friendship, solidarity!
 It is with these important aims that we have
 returned from Vienna.   For my part, I will do all
 in my power to help consolidate the fruits of the
 Conference.  I will work even harder to make my
 motherland still stronger and more prosperous, as
 my contribution to the cause of peace, the creation of
 a better future for youth and all mankind.
 -Huo Hsiu-yun
 The reports I heard at the International Confer-
 ence for the Defence of the Rights of Youth give me
 much food for thought.  Being a peasant myself, I'm
 particularly concerned with the peasants' fate in
 colonial and dependent countries.  A Japanese dele-
 gate told how vast stretches of farmlapd in his coun-
 try had been turned into aerodromes by the U.S.
 occupationists and many young peasants recruited
 into the army to serve as cannon fodder for the ag-
 gressors.  In many other countries, diseases are rife
 in the countryside, taking heavy tolls.  Upon hearing
 all this, I couldn't help recalling my own past, which
 is comparable in many respects to the present condi-
 tions in these countries.
 Before the liberation, my family in Kiangsi pro-
 vince had toiled for the feudal landlords for genera-
 tions, without gaining an inch of land which might
 be called its own.  I myself had to serve the landlord
 as a cowherd from early childhood.  Undernourished
 and often spending the night on the dewy meadow,
 I once fell ill at the. age of eleven.  The landlord
 drove me home, lest I should die and thus "bring an
 ill omen" to his mansion.  Mother sat day and night
 by my bedside, weeping.    What could she do for me?
 There was no doctor around.  To send for one in the
 town was out of the question, for he wouldn't come
 down to an out-of-the-way village except by sedan-
 chair and we couldn't afford the travelling expenses
 and medical fees.  Fortunately, a relative of mine came
 up and brought me back to health with some sort of
 curative herbs.
 But such tragedies will not occur now.  There's
 a medical centre in our village and the two medical
 workers there are ready to go to visit the patient at
 a moment's call, free of charge.  Last autumn, when
 my wife gave birth. to a child, two mid-wives came
 to my house from the county town.  Wang Shu-ching,
 one of, the members of my agricultural producers'
 cooperative, had much to say on this occasion, for
 his wife died in 1947 in childbirth, together with her
 baby.
 "The reactionary regime brought us poverty and
 death, but the Communist Party brings us prosperity
 and life," Wang said with deep emotion.
 Yes, ours is a life of plenty, simply because we've
 become masters of the land and our own destinies.
 Since the agarian reform, I've harvested one rich
 crop after another, which no longer go to fill the
 landlord's barns.  With the surplus grain, I've built
 a new house and bought my family new clothes.
 While there was no educational service in my village
 in the past, now there are three primary schools and
 21 literacy classes, one of which I attend regularly.
 I've been elected a member of the County Peo-
 ple's Government Council and also a representative
 to the All-Circles People's Representative Conference
 of  Kiangsi  Province.  In  these  organs  of  state
 power, I can voice the peasants' opinions on produc-
 tion and on their own well-being.
 Of course, the economic and political rights we're
 enjoying did not drop into our hands by themselves.
 They were hard won, through long-term struggles
 led by the Chinese Communist Party.  To defend
 these rights, we need peace, which must also be
 fought for, so that the crops, the fruits of our free,
 creative labour, will not be destroyed in the flames
 of war!
 Upon my- return to Peking from Vienna, I came
 to the school where I teach. To my surprise, I did
 not find my students in the place where they used'

 to 'be.  They were studying in the 32 classrooms
 housed in a newly erected building!  I was less than
 two months absent from the school, yet it had chang-
 ed almost beyond recognition.  In front of this new
 building, I thought of many others that had also
 sprung up throughout the country in this short period
 of time.  Then my mind went beyond the boundary
 of my homeland.  I recalled what the delegates from
 many countries said at the International Conference
 for the Defence of the Rights of Youth.  This is the
 general picture of education in these countries: reduc-
 tion of expenditures for culture and education, school
 curriculums gradually adapted to military purposes,
 unemployment for college graduates, teachers dis-
 charged from school. . . .  This strikes a sharp con-
 trast with the state of affairs in China, where the
 number of students is increasing from year to year.
 Now there are 202,000 college students, or nearly 70
 per cent over the pre-war peak level.  The secondary
 and primary school enrollments are double those of
 1949, and all, college students and a great part of
 the secondary school students are now receiving
 stipends from the state.  Graduates do not have to
 worry about their jobs.  In fact, there is a shortage
 of intellectuals in every field of national construction
 now in full swing.
 We teachers are entrusted with a very responsible
 work, the work of educating youth to be patriotic and
 internationally-minded citizens and competent build-
 ers of the country.  I deem that the best way to de-
 fend the rights of youth is to do my work well, for
 a younger generation well-educated will add greatly
 to the strength of democracy and peace.
 -Shen Hsung-yuan
 I am a girl of Tibetan nationality.  We Tibetan
 people were discriminated against in the days of the
 Kuomintang rule, and it was the Communist Party
 of China that enabled its to get on our feet.  Recent-
 ly, as a representative of the Tibetan youth, I had
 the chance to attend the International Conference
 for the Defence of the Rights of Youth.  This is some-
 thing I never dreamed of before.
 At the Conference, I was particularly concerned
 about the problem of racial' discrimination which, as
 I learned through the reports given by some dele-
 gates, is of grave importance in the  capitalist,
 colonial and dependent countries.  In the U.S., for
 instance, young negroes doing the same work as
 whites can earn only 30-40 per cent as much as the
 latter.  In South Africa, the wages of young local
 miners are only about one-tenth of those of the
 white miners.  The imperialists want to foster ignor-
 ance among the minority nationalities.  In the U.S.,
 the proportion of illiteracy is ten times higher among
 the negro people than among the white. The colonial-
 ists forbid the people of the colonial and dependent
 countries to use their own language, in an attempt
 to obliterate the history and culture of these nations..
 These facts brought my memory back to the
 days of the Kuomintang regime, when we Tibetans
 suffered in very much the same way under the Greater
 Nationalism fanned by the reactionaries.  But things
 have completely changed since Liberation.  As a re-
 sult of the correct policy towards nationalities as
 laid down by the great Chairman Mao and the
 Chinese Communist Party, the areas inhabited by us
 Tibetans have taken on a brand new appearance...
 The People's Government has specially set up educa-
 tional institutions for the national minorities, so that
 we can have equal opportunities to study with the
 Han youth.
 Enrollment in these institutions is increasing day
 by day.  Apart from receiving People's Scholarships,.
 we students are also provided with food and cloth
 ing by the State.  The People's Government has
 also sent a good number of teachers to our areas to
 help in establishing primary schools for those among
 us who never had any chance to attend school.
 Now we have our own national  autonomous
 government.  United in the big family of the Mother-
 land, we Tibetans, like people of all other nationali-
 ties, have bright days ahead of us.

 The 1953 National Basket-Volleyball Tournament
 Immediately  after the May Day celebrations,
 Tientsin saw a big sporting event.  From May 2nd
 to 13th the 1953 National Basket-Volleyball Tourna-
 ment-the second of its sort since the liberation-
 was held in the city, accompanied by exhibition
 matches of lawn tennis and badminton.
 The Tournament  drew tens of thousands  of
