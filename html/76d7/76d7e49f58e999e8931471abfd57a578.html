 No `Novosty'Is Good Novosty
 (202) 347-8016
 Story of the Soviet Press Propaganda and Subversion System
 by Thomas Schuman
 This month, The Rising Tide is
 pleased to present this special fea-
 ture. Written by a former Novosty
 Press Agency IAPNj employee who
 also worked for the Information
 Department of the Soviet Embassy
 in India before his defection there in
 1970. Tomas Schuman (born in
 Moscow. 1939) details how he and
 his comrades perpretated Soviet
 subversion and ideological warfare
 in India. Schuman exposes just how
 Novosty-as an extension of the
 Soviet KGB in the form of its
 ideological subversion arm-serves
 the relentless and unchanging goals
 of the Central Committee of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet
 Union.
 "An information Agency of the
 Soviet  public  organizations",
 Novosty-APN was established in
 February , 1961. Hardly two years
 passed when it had become obvious,
 what  kind  of  "public  organi-
 zations" were using Novosty Press
 Agency and for which sort of
 "information".
 In 1963 the government of the
 Congo Republic (Kinshasa), today
 Zaire, expelled, allegedly for espion-
 age and subversive activity, a Soviet
 journalist by the name of Banik
 Beknazar-Youebashev, an employee
 of two Soviet organizations, both
 equally "public", Novosty and the
 KGB. In five years time he died I.
 Moscow,  officially  from  blood
 cancer. Unofficially, according to
 rumors circulated in Novosty, the
 cause of death was a strange incur-
 able disease inocculated into him in
 a Congo prison by the African
 "brothers" as a sign of their gra-
 titude for his far too active work
 towards Sovietization of the young
 African state, "independent" for
 the decadent West, but destined by
 the Kremlin theoreticians to become
 a part of the Soviet empire.
 In May, 1963 another African
 country-Kenya-expelled another
 "journalist"-spy, an employee of
 Novosty Press Agency, whose name
 was diplomatically not even men-
 tioned in the Kenya press. In March,
 1966 Kenya had to expell another
 Novosty-KGB man, this time his
 name was known to the media-
 Youri Kuritsin.
 In 1964, Washington received
 Soviet diplomat, deputy chief editor
 of the "Soviet Life" magazine, pub-
 fished by the USSR Embassy in the
 USA. His time was Boris Kar-
 povich and he was former deputy
 chairman of Novosty Press Agency.
 Comrade Karpovich lasted as a
 "journalist" only till January 1965,
 to be expelled as "persona non
 grata", which is a nice way to say
 "for espionage and subversion".
 In 1965, a humorous and ex-
 tremely sociable Soviet journalist

 While the Justice Department
 persists in its persecution of former
 FBI officials for alleged illegal
 eavesdropping  practices  during
 previous administrations, the KGB
 and other Soviet-bloc agents are
 steeping up their espionage ac-
 tivities in the United States.
 American intelligence sources, as
 quoted  in  the   American  in-

 Reader's Digest, estimate that "of

 percent are KGB and GRU of-

 But the FBI, by reason of new
 legal restrictions, faltering Bureau
 morale  and  an  understandable
 reluctance of American citizens to
 cooperate, are not tracking these
 foreign spies as they once did.
 George Hiscott IV, a member of
 the Association of Former In-
 telligence Officers, has put the
 number  of  "foreign  adversary
 agents on station" in the U.S. at
 1,400, not including "their U.S.
 contacts  and  sub-agents," and
 others posing as seamen, tourists
 and  visitors  from   Communist
 countries.

 However, because of its failure to
 monitor the movement of so-called

 the new measure will hardly affect

 Since the U.S. opened 40 of its
 ports to Soviet ships in 1972, KGB
 agents posing as seamen have been
 able to ply their trade on American
 soil. In 1976 alone, more than
 25,000 Soviet seamen came ashore.
 Furthermore, in 1977, with the

 how deep this liberationist ~r
 moralist impulse is in Marx - it
 .
 infused all his writings and was me
 ultimate   motivation for the Mon
 "scientific" economic, political and
 social investigations of the major
 later writings such as Das Kapital. If
 this moralist impulse controlt the
 science,   then the question arises as
 to just how scientific the so   called
 "iscience"   If   Marxism is. And if
 Marxism is not a science, then the
 application of this theory to
 political, and social affairs will be
 guided   not   by a passion for
 scientific truth. but by an adherence, -
 to purpose, property regarded as the
 natural domain of Une propagandist.
 If Marxism partakes as much of
 propaganda   as it doe, of science,
 these why should   we regard   this
 particular propagandistic stance to
 be a better one than any other, e.g.
 Christianity, or capitalism or
 fascism?
 The marriage of science and
 propaganda in Marx produces an
 evere   more virulent mixture, I
 submit, than either   false science or
 bad moralism alone.
 Sumly one important ,ease. that
 Marx and Marxists   want to   insist
 that Marxism is a science is this
 desire   to preserve the system from

 spiritualistic and as de-maturing
 man; as detracting from man's
 dignity and value as nown. Here-
 religion and spiritualism were men
 as essentially alien to man; ,he only
 real being is man himself.
 Seeking man's dignity or essential
 nature as somehow related to some
 spiritual entity or being or value
 outside of man is thus foreign to
 Man; in fact Man and Engels
 argued in the Communist Manifesto
 that religion only helped keep the
 proletariat in bondage. Therefore

 The very name of Novosty Press
 Agency is a beautiful example of the
 newspeak and reminds one of either
 of Orwell's "Ministry of Truth" or
 Evtushenko's "Ministry of Tender-
 ri-s". The fact is, that there is no
 news as they are erroneously and
 non-marxistlike understood in the
 West-as reports about the current
 events. This sort of news could
 easily contradict the prophesies of
 the founders of Marxism-Lemendism,
 and thus give a wrong and totally
 onset retific, picture of reality.
 Neither is there any "press" in
 Novoity Press Agency, at least in
 the meaning of the word accepted in
 the West and related to journalistic
 profession. But it does not mean
 th t th APN has no press. "Press is
 th: most potent weapon of our
 Party", and the Friend and Teacher
 of all the journalists Joseph
 Vissarionovitch Stalin-and he wiis
 right. In the APN the word press is
 understood mainly as a technical
 term-printing press, or as   an
 abstract term in a sentence:   ...   rha
 Soviet Press is the most truthful
 press in the world", a slogan that
 decorates walls of many editorial
 offices in the USSR.
 The only word most relevant to
 a   . ..
 the   ct vines of the APN is
 "agency". To   understand better the
 this trend in Marxism toward
 ignoring the individual, and even
 suppressing him if he gets in the way
 of historical progress, is over-
 whelming.

 Spiritualistic conceptions of man
 in which man's value is derived
 from or somehow relates to spirit or
 ~o God have the ability to snecify
 he value of the concrete indiv dual

 unit, operating in history, which is
 approximately what Man must say
 the concrete individual is. In,

 it may be true that it has be;rayed it
 more   often than it has recognized it,

 such cases one can speak of the
 betrayal   of basic principles. In the
 ...   e   I   ist states' suppression

 the betrayal of basic principles one
 can point to the anti-spiritualism   of
 Marx and the lack, therefore, of an
 independant concept of the value of
 a person based on his spiritual
 nature, and claim that this betrayal
 of   the eight, If individual, is e,ai

 circumstances, i.e. given the

 ideology the betrayal of the value
 of the ijviclual in favor of the
 state -- totalitarianism, in short -- is
 exactly what one should expect.
 Schaff, in trying to find a basis in
 Marxism for reaffirming the value
 of the human individual, reasserts
 Marx's humanism. This humanism
 is especially apparent in Marx's
 early writing. This point is correct
 (see above, the discussion of Marx's
 dual motivation), but not decisive.
 There are two kinds of humanism;

 one is a humanism blamed on
 spiritualism, in which man is
 valuable because he is given value by
 God (or a God-surrogate); the other
 is a humanism such   as that of
 Feuerbach and Marx which tries to   .
 separate man from any God or
 antecedent spiritual reality, feeling
 that to fail to do so is to derrim,
 man. It is worth noting as a
 historical trend that it is states bassed
 on the first kind of humanism, the

 One Liberal columnist has com-
 pared   the   pilgramage of ]- Smith
 to the United States with similar
 trips of Madame Chiang Kai-shek
 from Nationalist China and Diem
 from Vietnam. In each case, there
 was a nation sympathetic to the
 United States being threatened by z
 Communist force. There were other
 similarities. All three regimes had or
 .   hav problems within their own
 country that were viewed with dis.
 favor by certain Liberals in this
 cou try. Therefore, they did not
 have the full support of our State
 Department. Each pilgrimage
 received   considerable   popular
 support and in each case, pressure
 wa brought on our administration
 to give greater support to the
 current leadership in each country.
 Up to   here, them   is an   ....   t
 parallel with the current Rhodesian
 situation. The   columnist attempts to
 use these two historical events as a
 an interview with the French m-:-
 paper Le Figaro,   "Communi I
 North Korea continued to reject all
 proposals for peace   ...   Thus, con-
 tinued security cooperation between
 South Korea and the U.S. will
 remain as essential as ever to peace
 and freedom of the northeastern
 Asian region."
 we were caught in in the two prece-
 dents.
 According to this columnist who
 is typical of much of this kind of
 thought, our Slate Department
 yielded to the public pressure at the
 time, became involved in supporting
 corrupt and weak regimes. The end
 result was that the regimes we at-
 tempted to support failed because of
 their inherent evil nature. our
 support eventually pulled us into
 disastrous wars - the Korean War
 as a result of our China policy and
 the Vietnam War.
 I perceive that a different scenario
 took   place.   Admittedly,   both
 Madame Chiang and Diem received
 an outpouring of public support and'
 enormous pressure was put on the
 State Department, but the effect
 was minimal. While the career
 diplomats save lip service to support
 :hew regimes, they never really
 tied. In the case of China, the
 commitments made by Congress to
 support the Nationalist Chinese
 wen never carried out. The Under-
 secretary   of Treasury, Harry Dexter
 White who was unquestionably a
 menrvb~r of the Communist appara-
 tus managed to block the financial
 aid authorized by Congress that
 might have given financial stability
 to Chiang government and kept it
 fro fail,
 in   I'll
 in   the case of Diem, our State
 Department   virtually orchestrated
 his overthrow. First, they forced
 Diem to grant the extremists within
 his country the freedom to create
 turmoil and then used this turmoil
 to discredit him. The final straw was
 withdrawal of support which results
 in the overthrow and ressaaftation
 of Diem. The resulting chain forced
 the United States to commit far
 greater forces than we had intended.
 In the last forty years,   we   h ve
 wen ally after ally sink behind the
 Iron Curtain as a result of similar
 mishandling - Cuba,   Czerho-
 slovakia, Yugoslavia, all of eastern
 Europe, in addition to China and
 Vietnam   .
 The problem is not that our policy
 makers at State listen to the public
 and support unworthy and corrupt
 righ   t-ing   governments.   The

 If our   policy   maken and State

 sentiment generated by   Jan Smith's
 visit,   Rhodesia could no doubt be

 men'   .   If we follow historical prece-
 dent of China and Vietnam, our
 State Department will give token
 support   of Rhodesia to satisfy the
 public, but   will continue their
 program of undercutting any
 government that is sympathetic to
 the West. The end result will be
 another important gain by the Com-
 munists in their avowed goal   of the
 destruction of democracy.
 Will the World Take Note of Chinese Human Rights Viol&ions?
 Many Western intellectuals were
 so enthralled by Communism that
 they   refused to believe the stories of
 terror which slowly began emerging
 from the Soviet Union even before
 the death of Lenin. While some   de-
 .

 after the Hitler-St'alin pact, many

 murders and other barbarous acts.

 central thesis here is that Marx's
 theories, if put into practice as tee
 guiding ideology of a political in-
 stitution, will naturally lead to
 results such as we see in current
 Marxist states.
 This thesis cannot be proved by
 listing the ills of existing states
 because it may be possible that those
 ills are not the result of those states'
 adoption  of  Marxism  as  an
 ideology. Nor will it do to blame
 Marx for every excess committed in
 his  name (e.g.,  the events in
 Jonestown in Guyana carried out by
 Rev. Jim Jones, who according to
 press accounts, was much more of a
 Marxist than a Christian). But if it
 can be shown that important factors
 in  Marx's  thought  have  con-
 sequences that either naturally lead
 to bad results in practice, or that
 there is no way within Marxist
 ideology to prevent such outcomes,
 then this will show, I believe, that
 these outcomes are authentic to the
 Marxist theory.
