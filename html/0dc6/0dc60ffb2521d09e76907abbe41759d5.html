 FOREIGN TRADE OF PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 Vneshna    Tor  vl    foreign                                Ma Nai-shu, Director;
 Trade, No 5,           May 1956,                                   Foreign Trade Institute,
 Moscow, Pages 8-13                                      Chinese People's Republic
 1.   The Basic Problems of the Chinese People's       Republic         in the Transition
 Period and the Requirements of the  Flrst  Mw-Tear Plan
 In 1949 the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese  C6mmuriiat
 Party and its great leader,  comrade Mao Tse-tung,               completed the first stage
 of the Chinese revolution,  ousted the imperialist forces from the continent
 of China, overthrew the comprador bureaucratic bourgeoisie and its power,
 established a democratic people's dictatorship based on the alliance of
 workers and peasants under the leadership of the working class which com-
 bines the various democratic strata, and created the Chinese People's
 Republic.  Thus the fundamental question of the revolution, the question
 of power,  has been solved.
 Following the establishment of the Chinese People's Republic, the
 Communist Party of China and the central people's government immediately
 carried out a number of extremely difficult measures on the economic
 front.   To begin with, the centralisation of financial and economic
 operations on a countrywide scale was implemented.   The country's income
 and expenditures  were  balanced, inflation was halted, prices were
 stabilised, and a very energetic agrarian reform was put into effect.
 Much work was done toward the restoration of the national economy which
 had been subjected to severe devastation under the domination of the
 Kuomintang reactionaries; a radical change was achieved  In  the  financial
 and economic improvement of the country.   When the restoration of the
 national economy was completed, the Communist Party of China lost no time
 in providing a precise definition of the basic problems of the state in
 the transition period; it -%osed those problems before the people of the
 entire country.  These problems are defined in the constitution as
 follows.   "The period between the creation of the Chinese People's
 Republic and the building of a socialist society is a transition period.
 The basic problems of the state during the transition period are the
 gradual implementation of the country's industrialisation and the
 gradual completion of the socialist changes in agriculture, handicrafts
 industry, and capitalist industry and trade."
 With a view to dealing with the historical problems of.the country
 during the transition period,  the central people's  government,  basing
 its decision on the state of the national economy prior to its final
 restoration, outlined the task of planned economic construction to begin
 in 1953 and officially published the First Five-'car Plan for the develop-
 ment of the national economy (1953-1957) in.1955.
 The economic basis of China's national economy is still a backward
 one.   In 1952 the value of the overall output of the modern part of
 industry was only 26.7% of the total output of the industry and agri-
 culture; although China in 1952 attained or surpassed the previous
 highest production level in its history in regard to basic industrial
 products. China's heavy industry was still very weak; for example, the
 annum production of steel in 1952 was only 1.35 million t,-pig iron
 1.9 mill'an t,  electric power 7.26 billion kwh, and oil 436,000 t.   we
 were unable to produce large machines and automobiles.   Small,  individually-
 owned farms predominated in agriculture.

 STAT
 In view of this, the basic task of the First  Five-Year Plan is the
 Rcreation of primary bases for the socialist industrialisation of the
 country by way of concentrating the slain efforts on industrial construct-
 ion; including 694 above-plan projects based on the 156 construction'
 projects planned with the aid of the Soviet Union." Among the projects
 constructed in China with the aid of'the Soviet Union are  ferrous vind
 nonferrous metallurgical enterprises,' coal sines, various machine-building
 enterprises, oil and chemical industry enterprises, paver plants and
 others; all of them are in the field of heavy industry.   Having built
 these enterprises, China can produce a variety of machines, airplanes,
 automobiles, tractors, and other items which it could not produce before.
 Socialist industrialisation will create a base for China's further
 development.
 Foreign Trade Problems
 Foreign trade is one of the integral, inalienable parts of China's
 national economy.  According to the basic requirements of the First
 Five-Tear Plan of economic construction, the implementation of.foreign
 trade functions of exports and imports will guarantee the realization
 of the Five-Tear Plan.   The most important problem of the First Five-Tear
 Plan is the establishment of a heavy industry base.  It would be very
 difficult to establish such a base within a short period of time if we
 were to rely only on the resources and equipment now available in the
 crrvntry.  To accelerate the construction tempo of Chinas industry, we
 must utilise every possibility including the possibility of purchasing
 abroad electrical equipment, machine tools, machires, and other goods
 necessary for the establishment of Chinas heavy industry base which we
 are not yet able to produ-v at all or cannot produce in sufficient
 quantities.
 In addition to heavy industry, we must also develop transportation,
 communications and light industry in a proportional degree in the First
 Five-Tear Plan.  These branches of the economy are short of a number of
 types of production machinery; some of them can be produced in the
 country but in quantities far from sufficient to meet the current
 requirements, and others cannot yet be produced at all.   Certain types
 of industrial raw materials, though already produced in the country,
 cannot yet fully meet the raw material requirements  of  the daily growing
 branches of industry.   In view of ttis,  the existing requirements of the
 mentioned types of equipment and industrial raw materials are met through
 imports.
 Under way now in China is a powerful movement  for the cooperative
 type of agriculture; agricultural cooperatives are developing rapidly
 and the production enthusiasm of the  pea::ants has risen to new heights.
 The changes taking place in production relations have produced the need
 for new  agricultural equipment.   Particularly great are  the  requirements
 for mineral fertilizer.  And since domestic production is  still"  unable to
 supply this product in sufficient quantities, the existing requirements
 must be met through imports.
 All this shows that the main purpose of imports is, first of all, to
 facilitate the development of heavy industry as well as transportation,
 light industry, agriculture, and other important branches of China's
 national economy.
 Of great importance during the Five-Tear Plan also is the importation
 of certain types of essential consumer goods such as kerosene, medicines,
 sugar, cloth, and  so  on.  Although the importation of this type of goods
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/08: CIA-RDP81-00280R000200030038-2
 is not the main problem, it plays a definite part both in regard to
 meeting the needs of the people and the stabilisation of the domestic
 market.
 In order to import, China must export to a corresponding degree.
 Although China's national economy is still' backward, the country turns
 out a substantial quantity and variety of agricultural, animal husbandry,
 and mining industry products as well as those of the handicrafts
 industry.  Such Chinese products as tea, beans, tang oil, bristles,
 wolfram ore, natural silk, and silk products have long been famous on
 the foreign market.  Following the liberation, the production of most of
 these goods very rapidly reached the highest prewar level, while the
 production of some of them exceeded that level.  On the other hand, aa'a
 result of the rapid development of a number of light industry branches,
 the production of many types of industrial goods has been increasing
 gradually.  However, in view of the present domestic market capacity,
 some of these goods are not required in the quantities in which the.*
 are produced, while some of the other goods, which  are-In  great demand,
 can be used more economically, thereby increasing the quantities for
 export purposes.   All this constitutes a material base for the export
 of goods.  That is why much initiative should be shown in the export
 of these goods.   Since it is possible to pay for imports with the foreign
 currency realised from the sale of exports, these particular branches of
 production should be supported and developed.  This shows that the
 developee': of exports is a very important. task and that the problems
 in this field are enormous.
 The importance of foreign trade is not limited to the fact that it
 greatly contributes to the solution of the domestic problems facing the
 country.  Since foreign trade is an international exchange of goods, it
 also plays an important role in the solution  of  problems connected with
 foreign rplationt.
 The Chinese People's Republic has already established economic ties
 of an entirely new type with the Soviet Union and all people's demo-
 cracies.
 Acting on the principles of internationalism, the Soviet Union is
 offering the Chinese People's Republic disinterested, all-round, and
 long-term assistance.   Thanks to this aid, the construction of China's
 socialist economy is being carried out at a rapid pace.  The people's
 democracies are also giving China great economic assistance.   The
 Chinese People's Republic, in turn, does everything possible to support
 the economic construction in the countries of the socialist camp with
 the shipments of its various products.  This whole-hearted assistance and
 close cooperation in the field of economy are the basis of prosperity of
 the democratic world market, an important factor contributing to the
 general economic upswing of all the t.rother countries and to the
 strengthening of peace in the whole ww>rld.
 The first important international problem in China's foreign trade
 is the development and consolidation of the economic ties with the
 countries of the socialist camp.
 The Chinese People's Republic is successfully building a socialist
 system of economy.   However,  proceeding from the principle of the
 peaceful coexistence of 2 systems expounded by Lenin,  the great teacher
 of the revolution,  China has been and still is engaging in active trade
 with the capitalist countries since the establishment of it. new govern-
 ment.   The capacity of the Chinese People's Republic market-is very
 great. We hope to buy the various goods we need on the capitalist markets.

 The enterprise owners in the capitalist oaoatries will be able to get
 their profits while the workers in those countries will have better
 opportunities for work which will d4mi iah the threat of unemployment.
 These economic tics way improve the opportunity for drawing the peoples
 of those countries and the Chinese people closer together and for
 reaching a better mutual understanding which will contribute to an
 easing of international tension.  Guided by these basic premises, the
 government of the Chinese Peoikle's Republic and the Chinese people are
 striving for an active and energetic development of trade with
 capitalist countries.  This is the other important international
 problem in China's foreign trade.
 3.  The Role of Loreisn Trade in t.> Development of the National =ooncwm
 Thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and
 the central people's government of the Chines People's Republic, the
 country's foreigr, trade problems are being successfully solved.  In the
 first 3 years following the liberation of China. its foreign trade played
 a big part in the restoration of the national economy.  In the next 3
 years it also played an active part in the implementation of the plans
 for the first 3 years of the First Live Tear Plan for national economic
 development.
 China's foreign trade turnover has been increasing from year to
 year.  Taking the 1950 foreign trade turnover as 100%, the 1953
 turnover jumped to 181%.  In 1954 China's foreign trade turnover was
 more than double the 1950 volume; in the first 3 quarters of 1955 it
 was 15.1% larger than during the corresponding period of 1954.'
 According to the Five-Tear Plan, the 1957 foreign trade volume is to
 be 56.5% greater than in 1952.  The steady expansion of China's foreign
 trade volume reflects the upswing of industrial and agricultural pro-
 duction in the country as well as the further strengthening of its
 economic ties with different countries of the world.
 It should be pointed out that China's exports and imports have been
 substantially balanced since 1950.   This shows that the ties between
 China's national economy and that of other countries are q site normal
 and sound.   The conditions characteristic of old China under which imports
 exceeded exports over long periods of time have been eliminated for all
 time.
 The part of foreign trade in the national economy is determined not
 so much by the quantitative vol,,- of imports and exports as by the type
 of the imported and exported goods.   The bulk of China's imports over a
 number of years has consisted of means of production.  Only 10% of it
 consists of consumer goods.
 In China's imports of producer goods the value of machine aggregates
 has been increasing from year to year.  The importation of sets of equip-
 ment in 1951 was more than 33 times greater than in 1950.  This is how it
 grew in the subsequent years (1951 = 100).
 1952     286.3
 1953     477.1
 1954     993.9
 No less remarkable is the rapidly increasing import volume of varioas
 machine tools, electric generators, and other types of industrial equip-
 ment.

 The construction and rebuilding of various industrial enterprises
 call for a corresponding increase in production materials.  Although
 China's potential production of industrial raw materials is very great,
 it still must import a variety of raw materials such as nonferrous
 metals, rolled steel, oil, rubber, and others including cotton.
 Despite the fact that China's cotton production has longesince eiexc eded
 the prewar level, we still have to import cotton every year,
 China's production is as yet unable fully to m etc the raw
 requirements of the country s rapidly expanding
 Thanks to the large-scale imports of equipment, particularly sets
 of equipment,  China"s industry was quickly restored and began to
 develop at a swift pace.   In 1952 the value of the gross output of
 In
 China's modern industry was 178.6% as compared to that of 1949.
 1954 the value of the gross output of the industry (not including the
 output of the industrial cooperatives of the handicrafts industry or
 of the individual handicrafts workers) was 17% above the 1953 level,
 and the production of the means of production was increased by 20%.
 The output of means of production in 1954 was 42% of the gross indus-
 trial output.  Over 300 very important industrial projects were built,
 rebuilt, and under construction in 1954 alone; 19 of the 156 enter-
 prises under construction with the assistance of the Soviet Union were
 fully or partially completed and put in operation.   China is now able
 to produce many types of important industrial products which it could
 not produce before.   It can produce seamless steel pipes, high-test
 carbon steel, alloyed steel, heavy steel rails and others -- and the
 quality of production is steadily improving.   In 1954 China was able
 to produce, unassisted, more than 1,900 types of important machines and
 electric devices, including 6,000 kw hydroturbines, 110,000 v trans-
 formers, universal lathes with a maximum cutting speed of 1,500 rpm,
 and others.   The large quantities of machinery China imported enabled
 us to build many new light industry enterprises in various parts of the
 country, such as the Harbin Flax Combine and a number of cotton weaving
 mills.
 The above facts and figures show that China's import trade contri-
 butes to the development of production and the construction of a
 socialist economy in the country.  All this is as different as day
 from night when we compare the situation to the conditions prevalent
 in old China when the imports of large quantities of consumer goods
 and luxury items led to the stagnation and ruin of domestic industry
 enterprises.
 Agricultural products are the chief items of Chinese exports.   The
 sale of exportable products by the peasants has greatly increased their
 purchasing power.  This made it possible for them to acquire increasing
 quantities of the production facilities needed for the development of
 their economy as well as essential industrial goods which insured a
 higher living standard for the rural population and, to a considerable
 degree, consolidated the alliance of workers and peasants.
 It should be pointed out that the volume of China's exported
 industrial goods has been appreciably increased in the past 1-1/2
 to 2 years.   It is already possible to export large quantities of
 such industrial goods as cotton cloth, steel wire, nails, thermos
 bottles, and certain other items.   In 1955 China began to export to
 many Southeast Asian countries a variety of industrial goods which had
 never been exported in the past:   thin sheet metal, steel of various
 shapes, cast iron pipes, potassium chloride, white zinc, stained paper,
 and others.   These goods are favored by the customers.   Take the export
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/04/08: CIA-RDP81-0028OR000200030038-2
 through the port of Shanghai alone, for example.    About 2,000 different
 types of industrial goods have been exported through that port between
 the second half of 1954 and now.  Along with other goods, China began to
 export also certain sets of light industry equipment, particularly of
 the textile and match industries. The trade agreement we recently con-
 cluded with Egypt also testifies to the fact that the export of China*s
 industrial goods is already playing an important part.  According to
 preliminary figures summed up in 1955, the value of the export of
 industrial goods amounts to 1/3 of China's total export value.
 Such a change in the types of China's export goods not only reflects
 the speed of industrial development in the country but also shows the,
 increasing possibilities of acquiring foreign currency which, in turn,
 enhances China's solvency in foreign trade.
 In view of the necessity of developing China's heavy industry -- our
 mast. important task -- the volume of our imports.will be increasing from
 year to year.  This, in turn, calls for an all-round increase in the
 volume and range of exported goods.    We  already have  great possibilities
 for that.  China's foreign trade offialala are now working to expand the
 volume of exportable goods and improve the procurement organisation and
 the quality of such goods.  At the same time the Chinese  people- am
 making every effort to economise in the use of exportable goods, as they
 understand the importance of exports to the socialist industrialisation
 of the country.  This economy however does not affect the living standard
 of the people.
 4.  The Socialist Transformation of Foreigni Trade
 Before the liberation 80% of China's foreign trade was in the hands
 of the imperialists.  The bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie was in
 collusion with the imperialists and, banked by the government, seised
 part of the foreign trade, while the national bourgeoisie was at a dis-
 advantage in foreign                      trade.  Following China's liberation, the over-
 whelming majority of the imperialist elements fled{ the foreign trade
 enterprise*  of comprodor capital were confiscated.  A policy of government
 restrictions was adopted toward the foreign-trade enterprises of the
 national bourgeoisie and a small number of foreign concerns which abided
 by the law.
 In 1949 all the most important ports were liberated, one after the
 others and the government opened several government foreign-trade
 companies,  These companies have been frequently reo    ised and
 expended in the past 6 years in keeping with the growing foreign trade.

 The state foreign trade enterprises already enjoy an absolute
 superiority not only in the quantitative volume of exports and imports.
 The list of imported and exported goods also shows that the position of
 these enterprises has been strengthened.   The trade in all basic export
 and import goods which are important to the national economy is in the
 hands of the state enterprises.   In addition,  the state enterprises have
 from the very beginning monopolized the country's trade with the Soviet
 Union and the people's democracies; this insured the indisputable leading
 position of the state enterprises in foreign trade; this, also,  improved
 their service to the cause of building a socialist economy in the country.
 In regard to a very small number of capitalist foreign trade enter-
 prises,  not yet fully reorganized,  the government continues its policy of
 "utilization,  restriction,  and transformations which is designed gradually
 to change these capitalist enterprises into state capitalist enterprises
 of a semisocialist nature and later into fully socialist enterprises.
 The complete transformation of the capitalist foreign trade enterprises
 into socialist enterprises is a matter of the very near future.
 5.   Changes in Foreign Trade Distribution by Countries
 The changes in foreign trade distribution by countries is of enormous
 importance to new China.   When the Chinese People's Republic was formed,
 the single world market broke up and a new democratic world market emerged
 next to the  capitalist one. The Chinese People's Republic became one of
 the major members of the democratic world market.         This can be proved by
 the following figures on the changes in the part played by the various
 countries in China's foreign trade (in %):
 Total of the Chinese People's Republic's
 foreign trade turnover                     100       100        100       100
 Soviet Union's part of the total value
 of the foreign trade turnover                   30.89     48.72      57.34     56.39
 Part of the East European people+s
 democracies in the total value of
 foreign trade turnover                        1.99   13.24      19.02     16.58
 Part of the Asian people's democracies
 in the total value of foreign
 trade turnover                                0.60   1.32       1.72      2.52
 Part of the capit alist countries in
 the total value of the foreign
 trade turnover                               66.52   36.72      21.92     24.51
 It may  be  seen from the above figures that China's trade with the
 Soviet Union and the people's democracies accounts for the major part of
 China's foreign trade; this trade is developing at a very rapid tempo.
 Thus if China's trade with the USSR and the countries of the peoples
 democracy in 1950 is taken as 100%, its 1953 volume was 400% and its
 1954 volume was 500%.   This new type of trade relations is based  on  the
 equality of rights and mutual advantage of both parties and on mutual aid

 STAT
 and cooperation, which are implemented according to the possibilities
 and requirements of both sides.  For some years now the Sovf:et Union and
 the East European people's democracies have been supplying China with
 large quantities of equipment, machines, and other materials necessary
 for the various branches of construction.   China, in  turn,  has been
 supplying the Soviet Union and the people's democracies of East Europe
 with important agricultural and RLining products as well as other goods
 necessary for popular consumption:.'  The assistance received from the
 Soviet Union in the equipping of the 156 industrial installations is
 of particular importance.   All the equipment and materials for these
 projects are imparted by China from, the Soviet Union.   The very fact of
 such large-scale aid being offered in such a comparatively short period
 of time sets a new precedent in the history of international economic
 relations.
 Under the old Chinese regime, the volume of USSR trade with China was
 unusually small.   In the 20 years between 1917 and 1936, the Soviet
 Union's trade with China reached its peak in 1928 when it amounted to
 only 5.41% of China's total foreign trade; in some years it was even
 below one percent.   China's trade with Poland, Czechoslovakia,  Hungary,
 Rumania,  and the other countries of East Europe was quite insignificant
 prior to China's liberation.
 New China's trade with the Asian people's democracies has also been
 rapidly developing in recent years.   China, the Korean Democratic People's
 Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are brother countries
 which share their joys and troubles with each other and are tied together
 in friendship which was tested in hardship.   The Korean and Vietnam peoples
 have already made an outstanding contribution to the cause of the  struggle
 against imperialism and for national liberation and independence.   Their
 struggle is of great importance to the Chinese people; that is why China's
 relations with the Korean Democratic People's Republic and the Democratic
 Republic of Vietnam have been growing closer from year to year.
 China's economic ties with the Mongolian People's Republic have also
 been growing stronger from year to year.   The comparatively recently com-
 missioned China-Mongolia-USSR railroad has produced good opportunities
 for the further development of Chinese-Mongolian economic relations..
 China's trade with a number of Southeast Asian  countries  -  India,
 Ceylon,  Burma,  Indonesia, and Pakistan -- has also been steadily expanding
 in recent years.   The expansion of this trade is definitely important to
 .the development of the Southeast Asian countries' economy and to the con-
 solidation of their national independence; it plays'a significant-part
 in the construction of a socialist economy in China.   Chinas trade
 relations with these countries have been steadily expanding. since  the
 Bandung Conference of 1955.
 The recently signed trade agreement between China and Egypt laid the
 foundation for the normal development of Chinese-Egyptian trade.
 China's trade relations with the countries of Western Europe have
 been gradually restored and the trade volume with these countries has
 been increasing from year to year since the 1952 Moscow Economic Con-
 ference.   This shows that not only China is actively working for broader
 economic ties with the Western European countries,  but also that the
 industrialists of those countries are greatly interested in trade with
 China.   Incidentally,  those who are trading with China have already
 been convinced of the advantages of this trade.

 China took an active position also in regard to trade with Japan.  The
 Japanese people are now making great efforts to trade with new China.
 The econoadc ties of these 2 countries -- China and Japan -- ooald?be
 highly advantageous for their eaoooaia life.  The prospects for trade
 between China and Japan are therefore quite promising.
 ?ll that however does not   an that the restoration and development
 of trade between China and the different capitalist countries is pro-
 seeding quite smoothly; this trade in general has been opposed by the
 imperialists for a number of years.
 China cannot ignore the fact that the US "embargo and blockade"
 policy is affecting China's trade' relations with the capitalist count-
 ries.   However these artificial barriers wt..ll in the long run not be
 able to hold back the mighty will of the peoples of all countries who
 dimand the development of international economic relations and the
 maintenance of a stable and lasting peace in the whole world.  The
 "blockade and embargo" policy has been rebaffed by the peoples of the
 various countries.
 The Chinese People's Republic is steadily striving for trade with
 all countries based on the principle of equal rights and mutual advan-
 tage, mutual respect for sovereignty and scrupulous implementation of
 comi.tasnts.  This has been confirmed by past practises and will be
 confirmed on more  than one occasion in the future.
