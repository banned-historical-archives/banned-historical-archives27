 1.  Situation in the "GDR"
 a.  When, on occasion of the 5th Party Rally of the SID between
 10 and 16 July 1958, the new economic program had been
 announced, Ulbricht explicitly stressed that the socialization
 of still existing private industrial, trade and agricultural
 enterprises was one of the most important prerequisites for
 the fulfilment of the plan until 1961 (catching-up with West
 Germany in the per-.capita consumption of all important
 consumer articles) and until 1965 (stepping-up of industrial
 production to twice the 1957 volume). Ulbricht said that this
 socialization was necessary-since, because of their "backward
 production procedures", a sizable production increase could
 be expected neither of the "capitalisti;a" small industry nor
 of private trade or agricultural enterprises.
 Only 3 months later, in late September 1958, Ulbricht.had to
 dissociate himself from this socialization thesis and thus to
 revise his own economic policies.. When, with the beginning
 of the "sharp cpurse",, ' the mmnber of refugees from the GDR
 continued to grow' threateningly, and thus began to endanger
 the planned economic expansion by the resulting shortage of
 labor, Ulbricht launched the announcement that it would
 reverse the real development process if.the socialization
 of the still existing private enterprises would be made a
 prerequisite of the solution of. the,"main economic task",
 namely the catching-up with West Germany in the per-capita
 oonsumption of consumer articles by 1961.
 He said that, in reality, it was just the other way round: the
 socialization was nota.prerequisite to the solution of the
 so-called "main economic task" but "the solution of this task
 by 1961 will be a prerequisite to a victory of Socialism in
 the GDR and, later, the whole of Germany". In other words,
 the private industrial,, trade and agricultural enterprises
 were to increase their production until 1961 to such an
 extent that they will be able to contribute considerably to
 the realization of the abovementioned plan target,.whereupon
 they will be "socialized", i.e. expropriated.
 b.
 din view of
 the negative economic development, all    improvements" of the
 political structure of the SID concluded on occasion of the
 5th SED Party Rally must be considered illusive.-The Party
 continues to talk about plan fulfilment, however, without
 being convinced of the possibility of a realization of this
 program,
 the population was
 watching the situation with interest. An analysis of the
 general opinion of the population proved that the "bourgeois"
 elements have not yet given up and are by no means convinced
 of the final victory of Socialism. Major parts of the workers
 looked upon the predictions concerning the catching up with
 and surpassing of the West German standard of living as mere
 boasting. Concessions made toward the physicians were
 interpreted as indications ofreaknesa on the side of the
 Party                            . .

 concerning the outonme of the elections in Schleswig-

 up at the 5th Party Meeting of the SED should oat be taken

 the fact that, on higher as will as lover          el  one

 Ideological indoctrination of the population with the.aim
 of a hundred percent pall; and
 Activation of the entire political life with the aim of
 realisation of the decisions taken at the 5th Party Rally.
 In order to accomplish a large participation in election
 meetings, the, SED Central Ccmm ittes has ordered to add to
 the attraction of the latter by cultural performances aer
 w21 as coffee, cake, dances, etc.

 improve the general climate spong the population and to get

 f. According to a directive of the SID Central Committee on
 the execution of the resolutions of the 5th Party Rally,
 subordinate agencies prepared so-called "Perepektivplasne"
 (prospective plans) concerning the socialisation of
 agriculture, industry, trade, and handicraft. These plans,
 which have.proved Utopian, had the effect that lover-level
 party,and administrative agencies proceeded against still
 existing private enterprises with all kind. of pressure.
 These subordinate agencies are greatly shocked by the fact
 that they are-nor held reponsible for "exaggerations". In
 sbme cases,, Kreie headquarters pretested against such
 reproaches, emphasising that the Besirks headquarters were
 responsible for the whole program. In late September, all
 Perepektivplasve vare declared void while it was ordered
 that, in future, no pressure should be eisrted and complaints
 of the population should be, investigated
 Q. It appears that the SF.D has underrated the
 effects on the spirit of.the population Of the programme
 voiced on occasion of the ' 5th Party Rally and, before all,
 has not expected so large an increase of the flight- movement
 from the GTR. It is ;typical that )'osabw is now holding
 responsible for the "exaggerations" the GDR regime while
 the latter, in turn, holds responsible the subordinate party
 cadres. Yet, it is inconceivable that the points in question
 bad been announced at the 5th Party Rally without Moscow's
 consent.
 Concessions mad. toward the. intelligentsia, as well as a
 certain modification of the theses of the Party Rally, are
 aiming at an. approximation of. plans to the situation at
 hand.
 The present softer course toward the population in general
 may be explained by the desire to bring about a poll as high
 as possible. Particularly in view of the renewed Eastern
 activity with regard.to the German question - apparently. not
 a genuine looking for possibilities of a solution but a
 mere propaganda campaign   the regime must be interested
 in an election outcome as positive an possible. It must
 therefore be expected that the course of the SFD,will
 again became sharper after the elections.

 The previous Chief of the General Staff, Army General Su Yu, has
 hold this office since November 1954..He, too, has fought with Chinese
 troops since approximately 1927'and, from the beginning of the Chinese-
 Japanese war, has-held chiefly general staff positions with front
 troops and partisan units. He played a major role in the conquest of
 South China under Marshal Chen Ti. In'1954, he succeeded the latter
 as Commander of the Third Field Army and the Eastern MD. In the
 political field, he played no major part and was only mentioned as
 NVK Deputy.
 The fact that Su Yu was replaced by the politically more pronounced
 Huang Ke-tscheng may indicate that the Army is to be subjected to a
 still stricter Party control and that-it is increasingly to be
 employed for Party aims.

 According to press reports, fall maneuvers were held in the 4th

 concerning type and size of exercises, reports contain only
 general information: '
 A superior "Yorthern Group" attacked from march column a "Southern
 Group", which had to defend itself without any preparations..'The
 "Northern Group" succeeded in breaking through the enemy's position
 and to pursue the enemy during the night. The exercise ended with a
 river crossing by the "Northern Group" and thm forming of a
 bridgehead under employment of airborne troops. The reports stress
 the cooperation of all arms, including ABC, air force and airborne
 troops. The fQlla*ing points were indicated as training objectives:
 1.  Issuance of orders by unit or sub-leaders on the basis of own
 judgement of the situation; encouraging of own initiative and
 decisions;'
 2.  Tanking advantage of darkness and fog for military operations;
 3.  Control of QM units (supply of fighting unite with ammunition
 and rations; organization of maintenance and medical service
 in combat).
 On 7 Oct, Cyrankiewicz and Gomulka were present at the exercises.
 After having expressed their` satisfaction with the performance of
 the QK units toward Brig Gen Nowieki, thqrdeparted to a front

 activated frov the former 16th Inf Regt (former 2nd Inf Div Czestochowa).
 Airborne troops are also assumed to be stationed in Kolberg. "hile,
 during the 1957?fall, maneuver, the main aim of %he.ezereises was
 defense against an aggressor,'the 1958-training objective was the
 attack. The importande of combinedarma operations in the Polish
 Arnyr has already been pointed out                               The
 employment of nuclear weapons by both maneuver parties has been
 indicated by the enumeration of the individual branches of service
 involved. Especially noteworthy appears the importance attributed to
 the independence of suboleadsre and the organization of QM units
 during combat. Brig Gen Nowieki is being carried'as Chief of the
 Transportation Troop* in the MON.,
 The presence of Cyrankiewios and Qomulka at the fall maneuvers and
 the final critique by the tlinieter of National Defense tend to
 indicate that the'summer truing of the Polish Army has been completed.
