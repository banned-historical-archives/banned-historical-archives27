 China's Troubled
 Frontier Regions
 Key Judgments          Two years after its inception, Beijing's new minority policy appears to be
 stagnating. Chinese leaders have not, as they had hoped, been able to carry
 the policy far enough to overcome years of economic mismanagement,
 racial conflict, and leftist excesses, and thus to strengthen the security of
 China's border regions and contain local nationalism. Implementation has
 done little to integrate the minority areas more fully into the mainstream
 and reduce their drain on the national budget. The government believed
 that a moderate, constructive policy toward minorities could play an
 important role in improving relations with India and the moderate Arab
 countries, which have indeed been impressed with China's concessions to
 its Muslim minorities.                                        25X1
 The policy, announced in May 1980, granted minority regions a measure of
 increased autonomy, called for minority personnel to replace significant
 numbers of Chinese officials, and sought to spur economic development by
 increasing aid and implementing incentive systems. Beijing also loosened
 restrictions on minority cultures and appointed prominent minority mem-
 bers to prestigious, though relatively powerless, positions in the national
 and regional governments.                                   25X1
 The policy showed some initial success but now faces major obstacles. The
 ambitious economic program will almost certainly fall short of expectations
 because of the lack of infrastructure and the shortage of qualified
 personnel. The implacable hostility of most minorities toward the Chinese
 and the resilience of local nationalism make Beijing leery of permitting
 greater autonomy. In addition, ethnic Chinese and minority government
 officials and party cadre oppose the policy on a variety of grounds-
 including that of ideology-and they fear that their own positions will be
 Despite China's efforts, the border regions will remain areas of tension and
 a drain on the country's limited economic resources. The chronic and
 occasionally serious violence that has plagued the regions is certain to  25X1
 China's neighbors, particularly the Soviet Union.
 Party Chairman Hu Yaobang is closely identified with minority policy. A
 lack of progress in minority affairs or an upsurge in violence could be used
 by his rivals as part of a larger campaign to discredit him

 China's Troubled
 Frontier Regions
 Introduction
 China's vast, sparsely populated minority areas are so
 important strategically and economically that they
 are a perennial source of concern for the government
 in Beijing. These -regions contain important mineral
 reserves and sensitive military and intelligence facili-
 ties, including the Lop Nor nuclear test site. They
 share long borders with the Soviet Union and with its
 client states of Vietnam, Laos, Afghanistan, and
 Mongolia, as well as with its ally India. All Chinese
 regimes have been able to maintain only a tenuous
 grip on the border regions; the Communists are no
 exception. Beijing has failed to integrate these regions
 fully into the Chinese polity and economy. China
 does, however, strive to contain the tension so that
 hostile neighbors cannot exploit it.
 Particularly from the late 1950s, economic misman-
 agement and political excesses, culminating in a
 campaign for total assimilation, led to heightened
 tensions between minority peoples and ethnic Chinese.
 Frequent and occasionally large-scale armed clashes
 aroused leadership concern about political stability in
 the minority areas, particularly in the wake of the
 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The issue assumed
 sufficient importance that senior party leaders, in-
 cluding Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping, party Secre-
 tary Hu Yaobang, and Politburo member Wang
 Zhen, made troubleshooting trips to such areas. F_
 Xinjiang and Xizang (Tibet) are the largest and most
 important minority areas, and Beijing's problems
 seem more acute there than in Inner Mongolia,
 Ningxia, Guangxi, and Yunnan-other provinces
 with large minority populations. This paper concen-
 trates on Xinjiang and Xizang because they are
 testing grounds for a minority policy announced in
 An Intractable Problem
 Beijing's relations with its ethnic minorities would be
 difficult and complex under the best of circumstances.
 Whereas the heartland is populated by sedentary,
 relatively homogeneous, ethnic Chinese, the border
 areas contain an extraordinarily diverse and predomi-
 nantly non-Chinese population. China has some 56
 different minority groups practicing a variety of reli-
 gions and speaking a number of non-Chinese lan-
 guages. Yunnan alone has over 22 minority groups
 and Xinjiang has 13, predominantly Moslem, Turkic
 peoples with varyin traditions as traders, farmers, or
 nomadic herdsmen.                          25X1
 China's minority areas are backward and, for the
 most part, abysmally poor. In Yunnan local tribesmen
 still practice primitive, slash-and-burn agriculture,  25X1
 and the Chinese press reports that the basic literacy
 rate is less than 20 percent for adults. Even in the
 more developed areas of the northwest, the average
 annual per capita income of minorities is well below
 that of the interior; moreover, the social capital and
 economic infrastructure required for modernization
 are lacking.'                                   25X1
 Beijing's relations with its minority areas are compli-
 cated by the overwhelming influence of the People's
 Liberation Army (PLA) in frontier areas, especially in
 the far west, the most troubled area. Military officials25X1
 have generally been less sympathetic than civilian
 leaders to minority sensitivities, fearing that loosening
 control could undermine Chinese security. The Army
 has played the major role in managing and developing
 the economy of Xinjiang and Xizang, including open-
 ing state farms, setting up industries, building cities,
 25X1
 ' Peasants in the largely Uighur minority areas of southern Xin-
 jiang, for example, have an average annual per capita income of 70
 yuan (excluding income from private plots and sideline production),
 as compared to 107 yuan for the overall rural provincial average.
 Urban factory workers in Xinjiang, most of whom are Chinese and
 receive generous government subsidies in addition to their salaries,
 average 904 yuan per year. Embassy reporting, Chinese press
 reports, and the statements of Chinese leaders reinforce the fact
 that the minority areas are among the poorest in the country.=

 constructing roads and railroads, and overseeing the
 settlement en masse of demobilized Chinese troops
 and down-to-the-countryside youth. PLA cadre also
 established and staffed the party organization in both
 areas during the 1950s, and leading PLA command-
 ers with longstanding ties to the border areas-such
 as Politburo troubleshooter Wang Zhen-continue to
 play an important role in local politics.
 Beijing's erratic and often harsh minority policies
 during the 1950s and 1960s left ill will and suspicion
 that cannot be eradicated. During the Great Leap
 Forward (1958-60) and the Cultural Revolution
 (1966-76), advocates of a moderate policy that at-
 tempted to strike a balance between the interests of
 the party and those of the local peoples lost out to
 those favoring total assimilation. Minority cultures
 were viewed as subversive and antisocialist, and mi-
 nority leaders were labeled as class enemies. China's
 leftists sought to impose the Maoist vision completely
 and to rout the "special characteristics" of the minor-
 ity areas. Collectivization was imposed on sedentary
 25X1
 and nomadic peoples alike, Islam and Buddhism were
 suppressed as "feudal vestiges," and thousands of
 mosques and temples were destroyed.
 Maoist policies devastated the already weak econo- 25X1
 mies of the border areas. Economic mismanagement
 was aggravated by Chinese insensitivity. In Xizang,
 for instance, the radicals, insisting that "grain is the
 key link," forced the planting of wheat, which caused
 shortages of barley-the traditional Tibetan staple.
 Ideologically motivated crackdowns on private trade
 brought local commerce to a halt; yet the state proved
 incapable of providing needed goods and services.)
 The human cost of leftist policies was severe both in
 personal suffering and the loss of potential adminis- 25X1
 trative and technical personnel. Many minority intel-
 lectuals in Xinjiang, for example, were accused of
 having ties to the Soviet Union or of being "local

 than 20 years. Several generations of some of the best
 educated and most respected families were wiped out.

 The New Minority Policy
 After the purge of the Gang of Four in 1976, party
 leaders gradually began to modify the leftist policy of
 total assimilation. By 1980 Beijing was convinced that
 a massive new program was needed. The leadership
 was particularly alarmed by the continued intensity of
 anti-Chinese feeling as evidenced by the increase in
 minority-Chinese incidents and by the emotional re-
 ception given the Dalai Lama's elder brother during a
 visit to Xizang in 1979. Chinese leaders also seemed
 concerned that the upsurge in Muslim fundamental-
 ism in Iran and Pakistan might spill over into Xin-
 jiang, Ningxia, and Xizang. The Soviet invasion of
 Afghanistan intensified fears regarding the vulner-
 Although chiefly motivated by domestic political and
 security concerns, Beijing also saw possible diplomatic
 benefits from better relations with its minorities.
 Beijing hoped to enhance its standing with Islamic
 states and to create a climate conducive to improved
 relations with India. Accordingly, China began en-
 couraging visits by religious delegations from Saudi
 Arabia, Somalia, Iran, and Morocco, among others,
 and promoting stronger "people to people" ties be-
 tween Chinese Muslims and the Islamic world. Mo-
 roccan Prime Minister Bouabid, who visited Xian in
 early 1982, became the first leader from a Muslim
 country to attend public prayers in a Chinese mosque

 the Saudis and others to make large donations to
 individual mosques and to the Chinese Islamic Associ-
 ation. Muslim associations from China now attend

 ? A "policy of recuperation" and economic develop-
 ment to revive the traditional economy-specifically
 the handicraft industry and animal husbandry. This
 included an exemption from taxes and state pur-
 chase quotas for two years and an increase in
 central payments for five years.
 In 1980 China was also attempting to improve rela-
 tions with India and to make progress on the border
 issue. New Delhi has viewed Beijing's actions in
 Xizang-where Chinese treatment of its Tibetan mi-
 nority has been an irritant in Chinese-Indian rela-
 tions-as a gauge of its sincerity. A change in policy
 was clearly indicated.
 In May 1980 the new minority policy was announced
 amid great fanfare by Hu Yaobang, who was Party
 General Secretary at the time, during a trip to
 Xizang. The points made in his speech, which includ-
 ed specific proposals for Xizang, became the heart of
 Central Directive 31 of 1980. Beijing promised:
 ? Greater autonomy for minority areas and modifica-
 tion of central directives to fit the "special charac-
 teristics" of each region.
 ? Replacement of Chinese officials by minority offi-
 cials, with minorities to hold roughly two-thirds of
 all positions at the upper levels of administration
 and almost all posts at grass-roots levels. Those
 guilty of abuses during leftist periods were to be
 removed.
 ? Revival of traditional culture, including freedom of
 religion, provided that a fundamentally socialist
 orientation is maintained.                    25X1

 strate its sincerity and to right old wrongs. It appoint-
 ed prominent minority figures to prestigious, although
 largely symbolic, positions in the central and local
 governments. The Panchen Lama, second only to the

 As a corollary to economic development, Beijing has
 ordered greater attention to improving the education-
 al system in minority areas. The goal is universal
 elementary education by the end of the decade, with a
 lesser effort on the development of middle and techni-
 cal schools. Beijing has also announced plans to create
 more universities in the minority regions and to give
 minorities preferential admission quotas.

 culties the government has encountered in implement-
 ing its new policy. Beijing considered Xizang a show-
 case for the new program, and authorities acted
 quickly to institute the promised reforms. This, plus
 better and more complete source material, means the
 experience in Xizang is also better documented than
 that of other minority regions.
 Economic Development. Conditions have improved
 Dalai Lama in Tibet's religio-political order, for
 instance, was appointed to the Standing Committee of
 the National People's Congress. Beijing released
 scores of minority prisoners, including those con-
 demned as "local nationalists" in the 1950s, and
 Moslem and Tibetan dissidents whom the Chinese
 believed had participated in underground independ-
 ence movements. Perhaps the most dramatic gesture
 was Beijing's invitation to the Dalai Lama and his
 followers to return from exile in India. Beijing gave
 permission for four groups of the Dalai Lama's senior
 advisers and followers to tour Tibet during 1980. The
 Dalai Lama, however, refused to visit the region.
 The heart of the new minority policy is an ambitious
 economic recovery program whose announced goals
 include significantly improving the economies of
 "poor and backward" minority areas within two or
 three years, surpassing the best post-1949 showing
 within five or six years, and achieving "affluence"
 within a decade. The plan permits more use of private
 plots, traditional crops, barter, and a greater reliance
 on material incentives. In Xizang, traditional cross-
 border trade with Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim has
 been reopened.

 Beijing has begun projects designed to develop
 Xizang's infrastructure and has assumed complete
 control over the region's budget. It is funding new
 roads, power plants, and agrarian projects. Because of
 the central government's recent budget cuts, alloca-
 tions for these projects are far below the level expect-,
 ed. In fact, much of the planned rebuilding has
 stopped, and the reorganization or closure of factories
 and mines has added to unemployment and has
 lowered productivity. The Xizang Daily announced in
 late June that industry did not fulfill the state plan
 and that production costs had risen significantly. F_

 Regional Autonomy. Beijing began to transfer ethnic
 Chinese and appoint Tibetans to government and
 party positions soon after Hu Yaobang announced the
 new policy. Party First Secretary Ren Rong, a mili-
 tary man closely identified with the leftist period, was
 replaced with Yin Fatang, who, although an ethnic
 Chinese, is a Tibetan speaker with long experience in
 minority affairs. The Tibetan press also reports that
 leftists at lower levels are slowly being removed. F_
 Most of the appointments have been in the rural
 areas, although some local notables were named to
 senior government positions including that of Vice
 Chairman of the prestigious Standing Committee of
 the Xizang People's Congress. The lowest levels of
 rural administration now appear to be dominated by
 Tibetans.

 Beijing made some concessions to Tibetan nationalism
 by loosening restrictions on language, custom, cos-
 tume, and social practices but has moved cautiously in
 the area of religion. The regime has permitted monas-
 teries to reopen and encouraged pilgrims to visit holy
 sites in Xizang, but Beijing has not encoara ed the
 revival of a priesthood to serve those sites.

 Continuing deep concern about local nationalism is
 likely to preclude additional concessions to the Tibet-
 ans. These concerns were reinforced by the mass
 demonstrations that occurred in Lhasa in the summer
 of 1980 during visits by delegations representing the
 Dalai Lama. Beijing abruptly closed Xizang to outsid-
 ers and subsequently, in cooperation with Tibetan
 authorities, has sought to strengthen public order and
 to harness nationalist sentiments.
 The economic portions of the policy, by contrast, still
 remain largely unfulfilled. Two years after the policy
 was announced, a party work team sent to the region
 to assess conditions concluded that the standard of
 living remained far below that in the Mongolian
 People's Republic and in most Chinese provinces, and
 that Mongols were worse off than their Chinese   25X1
 neighbors. Chinese leaders believe living conditions in
 Inner Mongolia must eventually surpass those in the
 Mongolian People's Republic. Although admittedly a
 long-term goal, Beijing remains committed to devel-
 (Beijing has
 deemphasized regional autonomy when discussing mi-
 nority policy, and it apparently believes it has gone
 about as far as it can on this issue.
 The Situation in Other Minority Regions
 Implementation of the new minority policy seems
 most advanced in Inner Mongolia. Mongols, who
 constitute just 11 percent of the population of the
 region, now hold a disproportionately large share of
 both senior and lower level government positions.
 Ethnic Chinese, however, still dominate the local
 party organization. As in Xizang, the regime has
 made concessions on culture and language, and Mon-
 gols make up approximately 40 percent of this year's
 freshman class at Inner Mongolia University. The
 sensitivities of the large ethnic Chinese population
 will probably prevent many additional concessions.
 steps   being 2
 my. The lack of infrastructure and national budget  25X1
 constraints, however, make it very unlikely that the 25X1
 goal will be achieved.
 25X1
 As in Xizang and Inner Mongolia, Beijing has made
 more progress in Xinjiang with cultural than with
 economic matters. Probably because of the long bor-
 der with the Soviet Union and the history of racial
 violence, Beijing has moved more cautiously. Fewer
 minority officials have been appointed although
 Beijing has promised to begin withdrawing ethnic
 Chinese officials within three years. We have no
 evidence that large numbers of Chinese have been
 transferred so far. Beijing has allowed the mosques
 and bazaars to reopen, bolstered minority education,
 permitted the use of local languages, and, as a major
 concession to Muslim sensibilities, allowed use of the
 revered Arabic script.                        25X1
 Cadre Opposition                              25X1
 Several groups have an interest in seeing Beijing's
 new policy fail. Leftists generally oppose greater
 autonomy for minorities and object to the economic
 reforms on ideological grounds. Leftist sentiment is
 particularly strong in Xinjiang. Last August, 2,000 to
 3,000 wallposters reportedly appeared in Urumqi
 denouncing Deng Xiaoping and demanding the rein-
 statement of Hua Guofeng as party Chairman. The
 Xizang press indicates that entrenched leftists are
 causing problems for the provincial leadership there
 as well.

 Top Secret
 Many ethnic Chinese officials, regardless of their
 political biases, fear that increased recruitment of
 minority officials and their own consequent transfer
 out of the province will mean losing special privileges
 and hardship bonuses. Minority officials who have
 collaborated with the Chinese fear the consequences
 of a reduced Chinese presence. Tibetan officials in
 particular seem to believe that increased autonomy
 will lead to an upsurge of nationalist feeling that
 would not only undermine the stability of the region
 but threaten them personally.
 Security and Subversion
 Available evidence indicates that the military fears a
 reduced ethnic Chinese presence could jeopardize
 public order in minority areas and invite Soviet
 meddling. Some military leaders distrust Beijing's
 efforts to entice the Dalai Lama back to Tibet; they
 believe that the Soviets have undue influence in the
 Dalai Lama's camp and support Tibetan demands for
 independence.
 Military concerns about the impact of the policy on
 political tranquillity in the minority areas seem well
 founded. Since the introduction of the program, Chi-
 nese-minority tensions have increased in some areas.
 The most striking example is Xinjiang, where a wave
 of minority unrest swept through the largely Uighur
 oases along the southern rim of the Tarim Basin as
 well as in Aksu and Urumqi in the north following the
 inception of the minority policy. Minor incidents
 quickly grew into rioting, armed assaults on local
 officials and Chinese settlers, and occupation of party
 and army offices. In October and November 1981, for
 instance, communal violence between Chinese settlers
 and native Uighurs escalated, forcing the authorities
 to close the southwestern oasis city of Kashgar, 80
 miles from the Soviet border.
 In November
 1981                               minority
 villagers had beaten local officials attempting to bring
 more modern ways to Yunnan, had destroyed schools,
 tempts to improve their condition.
 and had generally worked against the regime's at-
 Chinese officials, particularly military leaders, blame
 the Soviet Union, at least partly, for the disturbances
 in Xinjiang. Soviet propaganda efforts increased over
 the past year, with daily radiobroadcasts in Uighur
 and in other Turkic dialects. The Soviets seek to fan
 minority fears of extinction and of forced intermar-
 riage with the Chinese. They also broadcast reports
 alleging the repression of minorities in other areas of
 China and paint a glowing picture of life across the
 cow's ally, Vietnam, also uses radiobroadcasts in
 efforts to stir up trouble between ethnic Chinese
 residents and minority peoples along the Sino-Viet-
 namese border.
 25X1
 Soviet propaganda probably falls on receptive ears,
 especially in Xinjiang. The Muslim peoples of western
 China are of the same ethnic, cultural, and linguistic
 group as the Turkic nationalities in the Soviet Union.
 Living conditions are generally better on the Soviet
 side of the border, and many older intellectuals were
 trained and educated in Soviet schools. Chinese offi-
 cials claim that Soviet propaganda is responsible for25X1

 the continuing emigration of Uighurs, Kazakhs, and

 family ties between Muslims in China and those in
 the Soviet Union to gather intelligence and interfere
 in Chinese internal affairs
 Despite a lack of firm evidence to document Soviet
 activities in the border areas, Chinese suspicions are
 at least partly justified. The Russians were always
 deeply involved in the Byzantine and sometimes cut-
 throat minority politics of China's northwestern bor-
 der regions, and there is every reason to assume that
 the present Soviet regime continues the practice.
 Chinese accusations that the Soviets are the primary
 cause of minority unrest, however, overstate the case.
 Improving relations with Moscow might relieve some
 of the stress, but the minority problem in the north-
 west, as well as in other minority areas, is based on
 grievances that are deep and longstanding.
 Outlook
 Two years after its inauguration, the new minority
 policy appears to be stagnating. Beijing has honored
 some of the promises made in 1980-loosening re-
 strictions on minority peoples, making symbolic ap-
 pointments of minority personages to senior govern-
 ment positions, and granting concessions to local
 interests. These have improved life marginally in the
 border areas, but no significant progress has been
 achieved in the more difficult task of rebuilding the
 economies. An enormous task in itself, the revitaliza-
 tion of the minority areas is further complicated by
 the lack of economic infrastructure, by a desperate
 shortage of qualified personnel, and by continued
 Chinese-minority tensions. Although minority areas
 receive a greater percentage of the total national
 budget than before, overall economic retrenchment
 means that the allocated funds will be far below the
 level expected when the policy was announced.
 The border areas, with the possible exception of Inner
 Mongolia, are likely to remain areas of tension and a
 drain on Beijing. The strategic importance of the
 border regions and the resilience of local nationalism
 make it impossible for Beijing to loosen its grip much
 more than it already has. Chronic and occasionally
 violent incidents such as those that erupted in Xin-
 jiang during the last two years will continue. Regard-
 less of its good intentions, Beijing is unlikely ever to
 win over the minority groups, whose hostility toward
 the Chinese is, in most cases, implacable.
 A resurgence of Chinese-minority violence in the
 border areas could complicate China's foreign rela-
 tions. China is already competing with some of its
 neighbors for the allegiance of minorities. An out-
 break of serious violence in the northwest or in the
 south could exacerbate already tense relations with
 the Soviet Union or Vietnam. Similarly, a new crack-
 down in Tibet would become an issue in relations with
 India, as such crackdowns have in the past. Any
 highly publicized incidents involving the Turkic peo-
 ples could set back efforts to win friends in the Middle
 East. Moderate Arab states, however, seem impressed
 by the lifting of restrictions on religion, and Beijing
 has used representatives of its Muslim minorities as
 ambassadors of good will.
 The minority problem could also become a factor in
 the leadership succession, especially after Deng leaves
 the scene and jockeying for influence intensifies. Hu
 and his supporters are closely identified with the new
 policy. Opponents, particularly. in the military, might
 use the lack of progress or continuing violence-
 especially if it occurred in conjunction with other
 policy setbacks-to criticize Hu and thus question his
 qualifications for leadership.
