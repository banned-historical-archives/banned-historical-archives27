 Mr.. SKUBITZ.  Mr.  Speaker,  this
 week the U.S. Department of Agriculture
 reported that the 'Commodity Credit
 Corporation had acquired $1.369 billion
 worth of farm commodities from July 1,
 1964, through`January 1965. During this
 same 7-month period, CCC disposed of
 inventories valued at $1.247 billion.
 This tremendous turnover of Govern-
 ment-owned farm surpluses is costly,
 wasteful, and destructive of free market
 prices received by farmers for the prod-
 ucts they sell in direct competition with
 CCC offerings.  Currently we have sub-
 stantial surpluses of wheat, corn, and a
 variety  of  agricultural  commodities.
 Whenever CCC sells a bushel of grain, it
 displaces a bushel which would other-
 wise be marketed by a producer. The re-
 sult is that for each of these bushels
 which CCC moves out of inventory
 through the front door, it acquires
 through the back door an equivalent
 amount under the loan storage program.
 The in and out charges, the acquisition
 'costs, the transportation expenses in-
 volved-hire are enormous. Moreover, the
 dumping of CCC-owned commodities de-
 presses the free market prices upon
 which farmers depend for their principal
 source of income. The Government loses,
 the farmer loses.  I have today intro-
 duced legislation which would prohibit
 CCC after July 1, 1965, from "making any
 sales-except sales offset by equivalent
 purchases-of wheat, corn, oats, rye, bar-
 ley, grain sorghums, soybeans, or flax-
 ,seed at less than 125 percent of the cur-
 rent support price for any such com-
 modity,   plus   reasonable .  carrying
 .charges."
 . During 1965 at the peak of the wheat
 marketing season, CCC sold millions of
 bushels of wheat in direct competition
 with producer marketings, thus penal-
 izing the farmer who signed up for the
 program as well as the ones who' did not.
 Since October 1, the beginning of the
 corn marketing year, CCC has sold about
 200 million bushels of corn in competi-
 tion with farmer marketings.~
 The restrictions on CCC sales which I
 am proposing would not only result in
 substantial savings to the Government,
 but it would also increase the free mar-
 ket prices for corn, wheat, grain, sorg-
 hums and other commodities by at least
 10 to 20 cents per bushel.
 CALL OF THE HOUSE
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, I make the
 point of order that a quorum is not
 present.
 The SPEAKER.  Evidently a quorum
 is not present.
 Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Speaker, I move a
 call of the House.
 A call of the House was ordered.
 The Clerk called the roll, and the fol-
 lowing Members failed to answer to their
 names:

 The SPEAKER.  On this rollcall, 389
 Members have answered to their names,
 a quorum.
 By unanimous consent, further pro-
 ceedings under the call were dispensed
 with.
 (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute.)
 Mr. HARRIS.  Mr. Speaker, I take
 this time to remind all Members of the
 House that this afternoon we will of-
 ficially open and have ready for use the
 new House gymnasium.  You received a
 notice from the gentleman from Mich-
 igan [Mr. CEDERBERGI and me as mem-
 bers of the gym committee about 2 weeks
 ago.
 The gymnasium will be opened at 4:30
 p.m. and at 5 o'clock sharp there will be
 a brief ceremony at which time we will
 give special recognition to our beloved
 and esteemed colleague, the gentleman
 from  Texas,  ALBERT  THOMAS, who has
 been chairman of the gym committee
 now for many years-almost 20 years
 I suppose.
 For those Members who perhaps do
 not know where the gymnasium is lo-
 cated, if you will go to the subbasement
 in the Rayburn Building and enter from
 the Independence Street side, where the
 four elevators are, it is on the east end
 of that corridor; or, if you wish to go
 from the Longworth Building, if you go
 down the escalator you will be on the
 subbasement floor and can go around the
 corridor to the south side of that first
 corridor, where you will find the entrance
 to the new gymnasium.
 The entire facilities of the old gymna-
 sium are being transferred to the new
 one.  This is for all Members of the
 House.
 The program at 5 o'clock will be brief,
 and I know all Members will want to
 take a good look at this new facility
 for the health and welfare of the Mem-
 bers of the House.  Everyone is urged
 to use these facilities.  The use will be
 good for all of us.
 We invite you to come. We hope you
 will be there for this occasion. I know
 you want to join us in paying special
 recognition to our colleague the gentle-
 man from Texas [Mr. THOMAS].

 The SPEAKER.  The gentleman from
 Ohio [Mr. HAYS] is recognized.
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. HAYS.  I yield to the gentleman
 from Iowa.
 Mr. GROSS.  There is nothing in the
 concurrent resolution to indicate the
 nature of the document.  Would the
 gentleman state the nature of the ma-
 terial to be printed.
 Mr. HAYS.   It is a flat, semihard
 sheet of paper, about the size of the
 tablet I am holding, containing a code
 of ethics for Government employees,
 drawn up some years ago, which was
 printed once and for which there seems
 to be some demand for reprinting. It is
 used for hanging in Government build-
 ings where Government employees work.
 Mr. GROSS.  I thank the gentleman.

 the committee amendment.

 Mr. WAGGONNER. Mr. Speaker, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. HAYS.  I yield to the gentleman
 from Louisiana, a member of the com-
 mittee.
 Mr. WAGGONNER. Could the gentle-
 man from Ohio clarify for the Members
 of the House who under the amended
 language of this resolution is entitled
 or authorized to sign the necessary
 vouchers?
 Mr. HAYS.  May I say to the gentle-
 man from Louisiana that this is exactly
 the same resolution, insofar as the com-
 mittee or subcommittee language is con-
 cerned, that the House reported 2 years
 ago.
 The Committee on House Administra-
 tion, I believe it is fair to say, did not
 feel that We could arbitrate within the
 Committee on Banking and Currency.
 They worked this matter out themselves
 2 years ago.
 The Committee on House Administra-
 tion does feel that the Housing Subcom-
 mittee is a very important subcommittee
 and that it should be separately financed
 and that the money should be used for
 that purpose.
 I would interpret the language to read
 that if the work is done by the full com-
 mittee then, of course, the chairman of
 the full committee would have the re-
 sponsibility of signing the vouchers, and
 if it is done by the subcommittee, then
 according to the language as I see it,
 either the chairman or the subcommittee
 chairman could sign the vouchers, sub-
 ject to approval of the Committee on
 House Administration.
 Mr.  WAGGONNER.  I  thank  the
 gentleman from Ohio.
 Mr. PATMAN.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. HAYS.  I yield to the gentleman
 from Texas.
 Mr.  PATMAN. I  differ  with  the
 gentleman's interpretation on this reso-
 lution. I will admit that it is the same
 as 2 years ago. Two years ago the chair-
 man of the Committee on Banking and
 Currency and the chairman of the sub-
 committee worked it out, and I feel sure
 it will be worked out this time.
 I think it should be left up to us to
 work it out rather than the interpreta-
 tion of the distinguished gentleman
 from Ohio, because the language itself
 is rather specific.  I agree with his in-
 terpretation that this committee can
 do it, or the subcommittee can do it, but
 in reference to the vouchers, of course,
 that is the responsibility in this case of
 two, the whole committee and the sub-
 committee.  I assume it will be satis-
 factory to the gentleman that whatever
 we do in working it out will be satisfac-
 tory to him.
 Mr. HAYS.  I may say to the gentle-
 man that is exactly what I tried to say
 to the House.          I said that the Commit-
 tee on House Administration felt that
 we could not arbitrate the differences or
 possible disagreements within your com-
 mittee, and we hoped your committee
 would work it out.
 Mr. PATMAN.  That is right.
 Mr. HAYS.  Just one word of admo-
 nition to the gentleman, however; that is,
 if you do not work it out you will have
 a rocky road to travel when you come
 back for more money.
 Mr. PATMAN.   I agree with the gen-
 tleman, we should work it out, and we
 will work it out.  I realize we would
 have a very difficult time if we failed to
 work it out when we came back and
 asked for more funds.  This is the big-
 gest program of the present administra-
 tion.  It involves more than $6 billion,
 and we will come back asking for more
 funds.
 Mr. HAYS.  I am not asking the
 gentleman to come back for more funds
 until the next session of the Congress.
 Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. HAYS.  I yield to the gentleman
 from Iowa.
 Mr. GROSS. In view of the substan-
 tial amounts of money, not only in this
 bill but in other requests, and in view of
 the substantial amount of money that
 is going to be appropriated in this and
 other funds to the Committee on Bank-
 ing and Currency, I am sure the Mem-
 bers of the House will expect some real
 development from this committee during
 the present year.  I am going to be in-
 terested in the results of a very substan-
 tial amount of money being spent.
 The  committee  amendments  were

 The resolution was agreed to.

 ployees of the respective Houses and officers
 and employees of the committees and Mem-
 bers of Congress; and the structure of, and
 the relationships between, the various stand-

 Congress:  Provided, That nothing in this
 concurrent resolution shall be construed to

 House: Provided further, That the language

 consolidations and reorganization of com-
 mittees.

 authorized subcommittee thereof, is author-

 Approved For Release 2003/10/10 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000300160024-6
 March 11. AR  oved For Rel  sR    UMA, FI -   RN00
 Mr.  SKUBITZ. Mr.  -Speaker,  this
 week the U.S. Department of Agriculture
 reported that the Commodity Credit
 Corporation had acquired $1.369 billion
 worth of farm commodities from July 1,
 1964, through January 1965. During this
 same 7-month period, CCC disposed of
 inventories valued at $1.247 billion.
 This tremendous turnover of Govern-
 ment-owned farm surpluses is costly,
 wasteful, and destructive of free market
 prices received by farmers for the prod-
 ucts they sell in direct competition with
 CCC offerings.  Currently we have sub-
 stantial surpluses of wheat, corn, and a
 variety  of  agricultural  commodities.
 Whenever CCC sells a bushel of grain, it
 displaces a bushel which would other-
 wise be marketed by a producer. The re-
 sult is that for each of these bushels
 which CCC moves out of inventory
 through the front door, it acquires
 through the back door an equivalent
 amount under the loan storage program.
 The in and out charges, the acquisition
 costs, the transportation expenses in-
 volved here are enormous. Moreover, the
 dumping of CCC-owned commodities de-
 presses the free market prices upon
 which farmers depend, for their principal
 source of income. The Government loses,
 the farmer loses.  I have today intro-
 duced legislation which would prohibit
 CCC after July 1, 1965, from "making any
 sales-except sales offset by equivalent
 purchases-of wheat, corn, oats, rye, bar-
 ley, grain sorghums, soybeans, or flax-
 seed at less than 125 percent of the cur-
 rent support price for any such com-
 modity,   plus   reasonable   carrying
 charges."
 During 1965 at the peak of the wheat
 marketing season, CCC sold millions of
 bushels of wheat in direct,, competition
 with producer marketings, thus penal-
 izing the farmer who signed up for the
 program as well as the ones who did not.
 Since October 1, the beginning of the
 corn marketing' year, CCC has sold about
 200 million bushels of corn in competi-
 tion with farmer marketings.
 The restrictions on CCC sales which I
 am proposing would not only result in
 substantial savings to the Government,
 but it would also increase the free mar-
 ket prices for corn, wheat, grain, sorg-
 hums and other commodities by at least
 10 to 20 cents per bushel.

 NEW HOUSE GYMNASIUM
 (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute.)
 Mr. HARRIS.  Mr. Speaker, I take
 this time to remind all Members of the
 House that this afternoon we will of-
 ficially open and have ready for use the
 new House gymnasium.  You received a
 notice from the gentleman from Mich-
 igan [Mr. CEDERBERGI and me as mem-
 bers of the gym committee about 2 weeks
 ago.
 The gymnasium will be'opened at 4:30
 p.m. and at 5 o'clock sharp there will be
 a brief ceremony at which time we will
 give special recognition to our beloved
 and esteemed colleague, the gentleman
 from Texas, ALBERT THOMAS, who has
 been chairman of the gym committee
 now for many years-almost 20 years
 I suppose.
 For those Members who perhaps do
 not know where the gymnasium is lo-
 cated, if you will go to the subbasement
 in the Rayburn Building and enter from
 the Independence Street side, where the
 four elevators are, it is on the east end
 of that corridor; or, if you wish to go
 from the Longworth Building, if you go
 down the escalator you will be on the
 subbasement floor and can go around the
 corridor to the south side of that first
 corridor, where you will find the entrance
 to the new gymnasium.
 The entire facilities of the old gymna-
 sium are being transferred to the new
 one.  This is for all Members of the
 House.
 The program at 5 o'clock will be brief,
 and I know all Members will want to
 take a good look at this new facility
 for the health and welfare of the Mem-
 bers of the House.  Everyone is urged
 to use these facilities.  The use will be
 good for all of us.
 We invite you to come. We hope you
 will be there for this occasion.  I know
 you want to join us in paying special
 recognition to our colleague the gentle-
 man from Texas [Mr, THOMAS]

 The SPEAKER.  The gentleman from
 Ohio [Mr. HAYS] is recognized.
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield? '
 Mr. HAYS.  I yield to the gentleman
 from Iowa.
 Mr. GROSS.  There is nothing in the
 concurrent resolution to indicate the
 nature of the document.  Would the
 gentleman state the nature of the ma-
 terial to be printed.
 Mr. HAYS.   It is a flat, semihard
 sheet of paper, about the size of the
 tablet I am holding, containing a code
 of ethics for Government employees,
 drawn up some years ago, which was
 printed once and for which there seems
 to be some demand for reprinting. It is
 used for hanging in Government build-
 ings where Government employees work.
 Mr. GROSS.  I thank the gentleman.

 of Representatives for a period of sixty days,

 ment Rooms".
 Mr. HALL.  Mr. Speaker, will the gen-
 tleman yield?
 Mr. HAYS.  I yield to the gentleman.
 Mr. HALL.  Mr. Speaker, I would like
 to ask the gentleman if it is the common
 precept and tradition that we print these
 in the Congress rather than have the
 Department downtown print such a
 document and distribute it?  I have no
 objection to this, but I am just seeking
 information.
 Mr. HAYS.  Mr. Speaker, may I say
 that the Department printed a number
 of these and made them available to the
 Members of the House; but the demand
 has gone beyond that.  This has been
 done in the past and I may point out that
 this does not necessarily represent the
 views of the House of Representatives,
 but is a . Department of State compila-
 tion.
 Mr. HALL.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate
 the statement of the gentleman and
 thank him.
 The SPEAKER.  The question is on
 the committee amendment.
 The committee amendment was agreed
 to.
 The concurrent resolution was agreed
 to and a motion to reconsider was laid
 on the table.
 Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of
 the author of this resolution, the gentle-
 man from New York [Mr. TENZER], I ask
 unanimous consent that he may extend
 his remarks following the passage of the
 concurrent resolution just agreed to.
 The SPEAKER. Without objection, it
 is so ordered.
 There was no objection.
 Mr.,TENZER.  Mr. Speaker, I want to
 compliment the gentleman from Ohio,
 Mr. WAYNE L. HAYS, the distinguished
 chairman of the Subcommittee on Print-
 ing of the Committee on House Adminis-
 tration, for the expeditious manner in
 which his committee dealt with House
 Concurrent Resolution 338.  Chairman
 HAYS and the distinguished 'gentleman
 from Texas, Mr. OMAR BURLESON, chair-
 man of the Committee on House Admin-
 istration, together with the members of
 the full committee and the Subcommit-
 tee on Printing have shown not only a
 recognition of the bipartisan aspects of
 our Vietnam commitment, but also a de-
 sire to insure the continuation of such
 bipartisan support by making certain
 that the American people are kept aware
 of the underlying reasons and the facts
 which justify this country's commitment.
 The white paper does not offer a solu-
 tion to the Vietnam conflict, but it does
 set forth in clear and concise form the
 case against Communist aggression in
 South Vietnam. This document provides
 the facts so #hat American citizens may
 judge the reasons for our role there and
 the future course of our defense of free-
 dom in that area of the globe.
 My colleagues in giving unanimous ap-
 proval of the resolution have likewise
 acted expeditiously in this matter of
 great importance to our democratic form
 of government and the American people
 will be fully apprised of all the facts.

 Page 2, line 15, following the word "com-

 Mr. WAGGONNER. Mr. Speaker, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. HAYS. I yield to the gentleman
 from Louisiana, a member of the com-
 mittee.
 Mr. WAGGONNER. Could the gentle-
 man from Ohio clarify for the Members
 of the House who under the amended
 language of this resolution is entitled
 or authorized to sign the necessary
 vouchers?
 Mr. HAYS.  May I say to the gentle-
 man. from Louisiana that this is exactly
 the same resolution, insofar as the com-
 mittee or subcommittee language is con-
 cerned, that the House reported 2 years
 ago.
 The Committee on House Administra-
 tion, I believe it is fair to say, did not
 feel that we could arbitrate within the
 Committee on Banking and Currency.
 They worked this matter out themselves
 2 years ago.
 The Committee on House Administra-
 tion does feel that the Housing Subcom-
 mittee is a very important subcommittee
 and that it should be separately financed
 and that the money should be used for
 that purpose.
 I would interpret the language to read
 that if the work is done by the full com-
 mittee then, of course, the chairman of
 the full committee would have the re-
 sponsibility of signing the vouchers, and
 if it is done by the subcommittee, then
 according to the language as I see it,
 either the chairman or the subcommittee
 chairman could sign the vouchers, sub-
 ject to approval of the Committee on
 House Administration.
 Mr.  WAGGONNER.  I  thank  the
 gentleman from Ohio.
 Mr. PATMAN.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. HAYS.  I yield to the gentleman
 from Texas.
 Mr.  PATMAN. I  differ  with  the
 gentleman's interpretation on this reso-
 lution.                                                       I will admit that It is the same
 as 2 years ago. Two years ago the chair-
 man of the Committee on Banking and
 Currency and the chairman of the sub-
 committee worked it out, and I feel sure
 it will be worked out this time.
 I think it should be left up to us to
 work it out rather than the interpreta-
 tion of the distinguished gentleman
 from Ohio, because the language itself
 is rather specific.  I agree with his in-
 terpretation that this committee can
 do it, or the subcommittee can do it, but
 in reference to the vouchers, of course,
 that is the responsibility in this case of
 two, the whole committee and the sub-
 committee.  I assume it will be satis-
 factory to the gentleman that whatever
 we do in working it out will be satisfac-
 tory to him.
 Mr. HAYS.  I may say to the gentle-
 man that is exactly what I tried to say
 to the House. I said that the Commit-
 tee on House Administration felt that
 we could not arbitrate the differences or
 possible disagreements within your com-
 mittee, and we hoped your committee
 would work it out.
 Mr. PATMAN.  That is right.
 Mr. HAYS.  Just one word of admo-
 nition to the gentleman, however; that is,
 if you do not work it out you will have
 a rocky road to travel when you come
 back for more money.
 Mr. PATMAN.   I agree with the gen-
 tleman, we should work it out, and we
 will work it out.  I realize we would
 have a very difficult time if we failed to
 work it out when we came back and
 asked for more funds.  This is the big-
 gest program of the present administra-
 tion.  It involves more than $6 billion,
 and we will come back asking for more
 funds.
 Mr. HAYS.  I  am     not  asking  the
 gentleman to come back for more funds
 until the next session of the Congress.
 Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. HAYS.  I yield to the gentleman
 from Iowa.
 Mr. GROSS. In view of the substan-
 tial amounts of money, not only in this
 bill but in other requests, and in view of
 the substantial amount of money that
 is going to be appropriated in this and
 other" funds to the Committee on Bank-
 ing and Currency, I am sure the Mem-
 bers of the House will expect some real
 development from this committee during
 the present year.  I am going to be in-
 terested in the results of a very substan-
 tial amount of money being spent.
 The  committee  amendments  were
 agreed to.
 The resolution was agreed to.
 A motion to reconsider was laid on the
 table.
 JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE ORGA-
 NIZATION OF THE CONGRESS
 Mr. MADDEN.  Mr. Speaker, by direc-
 tion of the Committee on Rules, I call up
 House Concurrent Resolution 4, and ask
 for its immediate consideration.
 The Clerk read the House concurrent
 resolution as follows:
 Resolved by the House of Representatives
 (the Senate concurring), That there is here-
 by established a Joint Committee on the
 Organization of the Congress (hereinafter
 referred to as the committee) to be composed
 of six Members of the Senate (not more than
 three of whom shall be members of the ma-
 jority party) to be appointed by the Presi-
 dent of the Senate, and six Members of the
 House of Representatives (not more than

 jority party) to be appointed by the Speaker
 of the House of Representatives.  The com-

 lationship with other branches of the United
 States Government, and enabling it better
 to meet its responsibilities under the Consti-
 tution.                                                                                                                                 This study shall include, but shall

 ployees of the respective Houses and officers
 andemployees of the committees and Mem-
 bers of Congress; and the structure of, and
 the relationships between, the various stand-

 Congress: Provided, That nothing in this
 concurrent resolution shall be construed to
 authorize the committee to make any rec-
 ommendations  with  respect  to the rules,
 parliamentary procedure, practices, and/or
 precedents of either House, or the considera-
 tion of any matter on the floor of either
 House: Provided further, That the language
 employed herein shall not prohibit the com-
 mittee from studying and recommending the
 consolidations and reorganization of com-
 mittees.
 SEc. 3. (a) The committee, or any duly
 authorized subcommittee thereof, is author-
 ized to sit and act atsuch places and times

 point and fix the compensation of such ex-
 perts, consultants, technicians, and clerical
 and stenographic  assistants as it deems

 RECORD   and  to include  extraneous
 matter,)
 Mr. LANGgN.  Mr. Speaker, it is time
 to clip the wings of the Commodity
 Credit Corporation before it flies away
 with more of needed national farm in-
 come,  That is why I am joining other of
 my colleagues in introducing a bill to
 strengthen the market price of wheat,
 corn, oats, rye, barley, grain sorghums,
 soybeans, and flaxseed by prohibiting
 the CCC from making domestic sales of
 such commodities at prices less, than 125
 percent of current support prices plus
 reasonable carrying charges.
 This action is desperately needed if
 we are to avoid a repetition of past un-
 wise manipulations by the CCC.  All too
 often we have seen this Government
 agency throw its stocks on the market
 at uncalled-for low prices, sometimes
 right in the middle of the harvest sea-
 son.  The resulting sag in the market
 price to farmers has been catastrophic.
 Mr. Speaker, I urge prompt considera-
 tion and passage of the bill.  Prohibiting
 the Commodity Credit Corporation from
 selling its commodities at prices less than
 125 percent of current support prices will
 .at least maintain some semblance of or-
 der and keep the market at a point that
 approaches a fair level.  It is time that
 the CCC became an instrument of Gov-
 ernment that helps the farmer rather
 than hurts him.
 TO ESTABLIS$ A JOINT COMMITTEE
 ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE
 CONGRESS
 (Mr. SKU13ITZ asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD, and to include extra-
 neous matter.)
 . Mr. SIUBITZ.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to
 commend my colleague from Indiana
 [Mr. MADDEN] on his excellent presenta-
 tion today, of the objectives and provi-
 sions of House Concurrent Resolution 4,
 to establish- a Joint Committee on the
 Organization of the Congress.
 The need fora full and complete study
 of the organization and operation of the
 Congress is long overdue.
 In this age of instant communication,
 computer  statistics,  and  the  growing
 complexities stemming from. the eco-
 nomic mobility of our population, Fed-
 eral dominion over many aspects of the
 daily lives of our citizens is a clear and
 present reality.
 Whether the flow of authority to
 Washington results from an inexorable
 tendency on the part of the Federal bu-
 reaucracy to expand itself in, keeping
 with Parkinson's laws, or rather results
 from a receding ability or willingness on
 the part of State and local governments
 to keep up with the needs of our citizens,
 it is not my purpose here to debate.
 I simply, state as a fact that the Fed-
 eral Government is more and more in-
 volved with the affairs of every citizen,
 as evidenced by the growing army of
 Federal wprkers in the executive branch
 and in.t4e sl}eer amount of legislation
 we,  the people's representatives,  are
 called upon to dispose of_in this Congress.
 Mr. Speaker, we tolerate the inefficien-
 cies in our democratic system of Govern-
 ment as a very small price to pay for the
 blessings of liberty. Certainly, no one of
 us wants to trade what we have, for all
 its faults, for the odious imposition of a
 totalitarian dictatorship or for the chaos
 which is the companion of anarchy.
 Still, acceptance of the weaknesses in-
 herent in any democracy gives us no li-
 cense to divest ourselves of the respon-
 sibility to improve the mechanics of the
 system to keep pace with the ever-chang-
 ing times.
 In the last session of Congress, I in-
 troduced a measure designed to eliminate
 a part of the legislative procedure that
 has been obsolete for many years. I said
 at that time:
 The growth of Government has made it
 mandatory for the legislative branch to mod-
 ernize its procedures.  If the Congress is to
 meet its responsibilities as regards efficiency
 and economy, a close relationship between
 the House and Senate tax raising and tax
 spending committees must be established.
 I repeat that statement today, as it is
 as valid now as it was then, and I have
 reintroduced my bill to create a Joint
 Committee on the Budget with the hope
 that it will be passed in this session of
 Congress.
 But there are additional operations of
 the Congress which deserve study with
 an eye toward modernization. It is my
 hope that a careful study by a Joint Com-
 mittee on the Organization of the Con-
 gress would define and illuminate these
 additional operations, and with that goal
 in mind, I pledge to work for passage of
 House Concurrent Resolution 4.
 Mr. Speaker, I urgently recommend
 passage of House Concurrent Resolu-
 tion 4.
 (Mr. SKUBITZ asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 [Mr. SKUBITZ' remarks will appear
 hereafter in the Appendix.]

 Mr.   MOELLER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I
 strongly endorse and support the admin-
 istration's policy of strength in Viet-
 nam-not because it is the best policy
 of my party but because it is so clearly
 in the best interests of my country.
 Let there be no misunderstanding or
 confusion as to why we are in Vietnam:
 We are there for the simple reason that
 the Communist strategy of conquest is
 "Vietnam  today-tomorrow  southeast
 Asia and the world."
 History tells a grim story of the chaos
 that almost always follows when free-
 men become too timid and too apathetic
 to resist aggression. World War II, with
 its millions of dead, might well have
 been averted had the great powers faced
 up to Hitler in the late 1930's instead
 of deluding themselves that the Nazi
 appetite for blood would be appeased by
 "just one more" victim.
 I say that we either continue to draw
 the line in Vietnam or we invite world
 war III by encouraging the Communists
 to stake out a progression of "final" vic-
 tims until, finally, the United States it-
 self becomes the direct target.
 So the withdrawal of U.S. assistance
 to South Vi t
 e n
 l
 since the founding days of this Republic.
 They will do no less today.
 Again, I support the administration's
 policy on Vietnam because it is right.
 Mr. GALLAGHER.  Mr. Speaker, I
 want to express my great admiration for
 the excellent presentation of the agoniz-
 ing problem of Vietnam and I want to
 express my warm regards for the gentle-
 man from South Carolina.  His presen-
 tation was an action that has seldom
 been equalled in this House.
 By expressing his knowledgeable sup-
 port of our President he has performed
 an outstanding patriotic service.
 I join with him in his expression of
 support and confidence in President
 Johnson.
 I recently visited Vietnam and I would
 like to state that we have our first team
 on the scene superbly led by Ambassa-
 dor Taylor, Ambassador Johnson, and
 General Westmoreland.
 Our military and civilian personnel are
 of the highest competence. They are do-
 ing an excellent job.  Perhaps, too, this
 is a time to make an observation about
 the Vietnamese soldiers. They are fight-
 ing and fighting well and they are being
 killed and wounded and they are doing
 this to repell the aggresssion taking place
 in their country.  The fatality rate is a
 staggering one. So let no one cast doubts
 as to the willingness of the Vietnamese
 to fight.

 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to take the
 floor this afternoon to inform the House
 that we have been joined by 18 other
 Members in filing similar legislation in
 this, the 89th Congress: the gentleman
 from Illinois [Mr. ANDERSON], the gentle-
 man from California [Mr. BELL], the
 gentleman from Utah [Mr. BURTON], the,
 gentleman from New Hampshire [Mr.

 today.
 Mr. Speaker, this, in my view, is a
 significant effort, because we believe that
 our Federal Establishment must give
 greater concern., greater attention to the
 problems  of the metropolitan  areas
 throughout the country.
 We believe that our approach is the
 right way to do it.
 Mr. Speaker, a principal element of the
 legislation filed by these 24 Republican
 Members, representing 13 of our States
 extending from Maine to California,
 would be the establishment of an Office
 of Community Development which would
 coordinate the many programs which
 have a major impact upon the Nation's
 metropolitan areas.

 be more welcome.  For 50 years we have
 been compelled to keep at least half an
 eye on the possibility of allout war. The
 exasperations Incident to efforts to find
 solutions for ever increasing problems
 have diverted energy which might better
 have been expended in more constructive
 ways.  In spite of our amazing progress
 in  general,  sore  spots  in  our  great
 society demand long-deferred medica-
 tion.                     There is too much crime and not
 enough education.  Extremes of wealth
 and poverty produce complaisance on
 one side and, resentment on the other.
 The reign of law and order has not been
 fully established in the land.  All around
 the fringe of an industrious and capable
 and benevolent corporate entity exist
 small groups of extremists who preach
 violence and disorder.  We need des-
 perately a clear and unharassed head to
 contemplate the means by which we may
 make ours a truly ideal society.
 In this year of 1965 the whole struc-
 ture of American Government has origi-
 nated a determined attack on our do-
 mestic, problems.  It may be that we can
 find strength to follow up that attack
 relentlessly and still keep our commit-
 ments to helpless people who are strug-
 gling to preserve their freedom in far
 corners of the earth.  It may be that
 other stabilized nations will come to our
 aid and help make, the whole task easier.
 Better still would it be if the only force
 that keeps the , world in turmoil would
 cease and desist.  So long as they con-
 tinue in their course, their own fate must
 be imperiled and our own progress must
 be impeded.  But whatever  happens,
 communism must be opposed or no good
 thing can possibly result.
 A UNIFORM PERIOD FOR DAYLIGHT
 SAVING TIME
 (Mr. FRASER (at the request of Mr.
 ALBERT)  was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. FR,ASER.  Mr. Speaker, today I
 have again introduced a bill to stand-
 ardize daylight saving time.
 This legislation is designed to provide
 a uniform period of daylight saving time
 and eliminate some of the confusion
 which results from variations in daylight
 saving time.  My bill would simply have
 all daylight saving time begin at 2 a.m.
 on the last Sunday in April and continue
 until 2 a.m. on the last Sunday in Octo-
 ber, of each year.
 The bill would not force any State or
 community to go on daylight saving
 `time, but would simply require that the
 cities and States which have elected to
 utilize daylight saving time would all
 shift on and off daylight saving time on
 the same day.
 This bill is a straightforward measure
 designed to eliminate needless confusion
 and is identical to the one I introduced
 in the 88th Congress.
 The need for standardization has be-
 come More 'Important with each pass-
 ing year.  Many local authorities have
 found themselves faced with a dilemma
 in deciding on the effective dates for day-
 In my own State of Minnesota last
 year, Duluth was torn between starting
 daylight saving with the other Minnesota
 cities at the end of May, or earlier, when
 Its twin city of Superior, Wis., changed its
 clocks.  Again this year the Minnesota
 Legislature was unable to reach an agree-
 ment on a measure to decide the effective
 dates for daylight saving time.
 According to a recent survey of the
 States observing daylight saving time on
 both a statewide and local option basis,
 all but five States switched to daylight
 saving time the last Sunday in April. For
 this reason, I have used this most com-
 mon starting date in my bill even though
 most of my own State of Minnesota cur-
 rently observes a later date.
 The most frequently used date to re-
 turn to standard time is also the date
 contained in this bill, the fourth Sunday
 in October-though a wide variety of
 dates exist.
 There seems to be no good reason for
 all this variance.  I am certain many
 States and communities choose their
 changeover  dates  without  any  real
 awareness of the confusion they are
 causing and the need for uniformity. We
 need to correct current practices and pre-
 vent further confusion in the future.
 My bill would provide for a standard 6
 months of daylight saving time for those
 States and communities which utilize
 daylight saving time. It would not im-
 pose any unwanted change to daylight
 saving time on those sections of our coun-
 try which prefer standard time.  It
 would only amend the existing Standard
 Time Act, enacted in 1918, to provide for
 a uniform period of daylight saving time.
 Standardization of daylight saving
 time would result in cost savings to air-
 lines, buslines,"and railroads, as the need
 to change schedules would become less
 frequent. It would eliminate some an-
 nosing, time confusion for the traveler
 whether he is going by automobile or
 public transportation. Broadcasting and
 communications in general would also
 benefit.
 We cannot afford to waste the re-
 sources of our country, particularly when
 the cause of the waste can easily be cor-
 rected.  For this reason, I have spon-
 sored this legislation and urge my col-
 leagues in the House to sponsor similar
 legislation to provide a uniform period
 for daylight saving time.
 ELDERHOAX, OR THE MASTERS OF
 ,DECEPTION
 (Mr. FULTON of Tennessee (at the re-
 quest of Mr. ALBERT) was granted per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr.  FULTON  of  Tennessee.   Mr.
 Speaker, for several weeks riow the
 House Ways and Means Committee has
 been considering a number of proposals
 designed to meet the mounting and
 pressing health care needs of our senior
 citizens.
 There are more than 100 such pro-
 posals now before the committee  But
 the two that have drawn the most public
 attention are H.R. 1, which is the admin-
 istration's bill to provide for hospital
 47
 and nursing home care through social
 security, and the eldercare plan to per-
 mit States to improve their Kerr-Mills
 medical assistance programs for the
 indigent.
 Both of these proposals have merit.  In
 our consideration of them. we are for-
 tunate that we will not be asked to de-
 cide which is good and which is bad,
 but which is best.
 There is, however, a campaign abroad
 today to. totally discredit one of these
 programs while attempting to beguile the
 public, and especially our senior citizens,
 into believing the other is something that
 it is not.
 I refer, of course, to the current multi-
 million-dollar propaganda campaign be-
 ing conducted by the American Medical
 Association to hoodwink the American
 taxpayer into believing that eldercare is
 the product of divine revelation while
 the medical care program was devised
 by Satan himself.
 This campaign is utilizing the slickest
 gimmicks in the Madison Avenue bag of
 tricks.   The techniques  employed are
 half-truth, concealed truth, sly infer-
 ence, and outright deception. Put them
 all in a pot, stir them with mass exposure
 on radio, television, and paid printed ad-
 vertising, season it with $4 or $5 million
 collected from the Nation's Ili and infirm
 and you have a nice little entree to be
 served up to the American public as
 though it were the inspiration of a mas-
 ter chef.
 I suggest that if we permit the Ameri-
 can public to bite into this tasty looking
 tidbit, they will be left with a very bad
 taste in their mouths for a long time.  It
 will not be the chef who is left with the
 blame, however, it will be the waiter who
 served it.  In this case the waiter will be
 the Congress of the United States.
 Eldercare is a better program, so the
 argument goes, because it is sponsored
 and endorsed by the American Medical
 Association.  Their argument is that if
 anyone knows the health needs of our
 senior citizens and how they should be
 met, certainly it must be the Nation's
 doctors.
 I submit that if this were the case, the
 Forand bill would have passed the Con-
 gress back in 1957.  As a matter of fact,
 the American Medical Association has
 step-by-step used every method at its
 disposal to oppose any medical care pro-
 gram for the elderly.
 AMA opposed the Forand bill.  AMA
 opposed the Kerr-Mills program. And
 now AMA opposes the administration's
 program.
 I must give them credit, though, never
 before in the AMA's history has that
 body even admitted the Nation's elderly
 have a health care problem.  At least
 today it does recognize this fact as evi-
 denced by its support of Eldercare.  I
 suggest this is a great step forward for
 this wise organization.  Today it sees
 what millions of Americans have seen
 and recognized for years.
 Now it is said again by the AMA that
 medical care through social security is
 "socialism."  But it does not suggest
 that this is true of Eidercare.  I submit
 that Eldercare is far more socialistic than
 any program we are considering today.

 EVENTS IN SELMA, ALA..
 (Mr. DULSKI (at the request of Mr.
 ALBERT)  was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this poirO in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. DULSKI. Mr. Speaker, all right-
 thing Americans are concerned by re-
 cent events in Selma, Ala.
 One of the basic principles on which
 our country was founded is the right of
 all of its citizens to vote and participate
 in their government.  America itself
 stands for law and order.
 All of our expressions of sympathy and
 denunciation of the deplorable situation
 in Selma will not solve the problem. Ac-
 tion is needed, and needed now, to put
 legislation on the books which will grant
 every 'qualified American in every State
 the right to vote without threat of harm
 or intimidation.;
 What has happened in Selma, Ala., has
 no place in our American way of life,
 and it is certainly not the America we
 are proud of.
 We pour millions and millions of dol-
 lars into programs designed to create a
 favorable image of the United States
 among nations abroad,. and one incident
 such as this does irreparable damage to
 our prestige and to our democratic way
 of life.  Recently, an article in a lead-
 RUN
 "You wanted to march, well go ahead, run
 now," the policemen yelled at them.  The
 youngsters, aged 9 to 17, were terrorized.
 Several of them, quickly winded, collapsed
 on the road.  A young girl, found alongside
 the road by some newsmen, was weeping.
 She held her hand to her head where she had
 a knot.  She told newsmen that a policeman
 had hit her, with an electric cattle cane
 because she did not want to run.
 VOTING RIGHTS LEGISLATION
 (Mr. PEPPER (at the request of Mr.
 ALBERT)  was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. PEPPER.  Mr. Speaker, most of
 us, I am sure, have been shocked and
 shamed by the. spectacle of the Governor
 of Alabama this last weekend ordering
 State troopers and others acting under
 the authority of the State to attack and
 brutally assault with clubs, trample upon
 with horses, and subject to tear gas, citi-
 zens of the State of Alabama and of the
 United States doing nothing more than
 making a brief appeal for their right to
 vote.  He has now given grist to the
 propaganda mill of the Communists all
 over the world to assert that ctitizens of
 this country do not have the protection
 of our' Constitution and that freedom
 for all the people of this country is not
 a reality.
 We can at least let the world know
 that the Government of the United
 States denounces. such tyrannical tactics
 and will take some steps, at least, toward
 the prevention of their repetition.
 The  heart  of  America  has  been.
 stirred by this tragic and horrible epi-
 sode. The conscience of America, as well
 as our Constitution, demands that the
 Federal Government take effective ac-
 tion to see to it that there is truth in
 that part of the Pledge of Allegiance
 to our flag when we say "One nation,
 under God, indivisible, with liberty and
 justice for all."
 Let us speed the enactment of legis-
 lation which will assure equal voting
 rights for all of our population without
 discrimination on account of race, creed,
 color, or national origin, and without
 the disfranchised having to give or risk
 their lives to enjoy this precious heritage
 which should belong inviolate to every
 American,

 Mr. TENZER. Mr. Speaker, it was my
 honor and privilege to attend the convo-
 cation at which three honorary degrees
 were conferred by Dr. Samuel Belkin,
 president of Yeshiva University, on the
 occasion of the university's 20th anni-

 The honorary degree of doctor of hu-

 Donald Frederick Hornig and upon Mr.
 Samuel Hyman Golding.
 The degree of doctor of Yaws was con-

 in 1945.  Its record of growth and
 achievement in 20 years is a tribute to
 its distinguished president, its officers,
 members Of the board of trustees and
 board of overseers.
 The outline of that period of growth

 The chronological growth follows:
 In 1945, Yeshiva became the first uni-

 United States.
 In 1954, Stern College for Women was
 established.
 In 1955, Albert Einstein College of
 Medicine was established.
 In 1957, graduate school of education
 was established, Wurzweiler School of
 Social Work was established, and Sue
 Golding Graduate Division of Medical
 Sciences was established.
 In 1958, Belfer Graduate School of
 Science was established.
 In 1961, 10-year $65 million blueprint

 Chief Justice Earl Warren received an
 honorary degree.
 In 1962, Sol and Hilda Furst Hall, main
 center was erected.
 In 1964, new residence hall, main cen-
 ter, was erected; Ullman Research Center
 for Health Sciences, Bronx Center was
 established.
 Outstanding amongst its schools is the
 Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The
 story of the medical school is one of
 vision, courage, and faith in our demo-
 cratic way of life. The college was built
 through the generosity of men and
 women of all faiths throughout the coun-
 try.                                                                                              It has advanced in a few years to
 the front ranks of American medical
 schools and is now embarked on a new
 program to meet the challenge of medical
 progress.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE           March -"I, -1965
 The next 10 years will be a decade of
 unprecedented scientific opportunity-
 not only in terms of the exploration of
 outer space but also in terms of inner
 space-the invisible world of cells, vi-
 ruses, and genes which hold the key to
 life and health.
 Dr. Joseph H. Lookstein, honorary
 trustee, when presenting Dr. Donald
 Frederick Hornig to the president of
 the university made the following state-
 ment:
 Mr. President, the realm of the scientist
 has widened and his function greatly ex-
 panded.  He has become the fearless explor-
 er of "the heavens above, the earth below,
 and the waters beneath the earth." Indeed,
 the universe is now his laboratory, man his
 primary concern and the Great Society is the
 goal of his researches.

 he joined the faculty of Brown University
 and soon became dean of its graduate school.
 Then he moved on to Princeton to serve as
 chairman  of  the  department  of  physical
 chemistry there.
 Those were happy academic years of in-
 spired teaching and creative research.                    He
 published some 70 scientific papers on a
 range of subjects that are an index of the
 versatility of his mind and the comprehen-
 siveness of his scholarship.
 Yet he could never be classified as a clois-
 tered scholar, preoccupied with mystic for-
 mulas and esoteric equations.  It was natural
 for him to respond enthusiastically to the de-
 mands of national duty and to the call for
 public  service.  Three  Presidents  of  our
 country in rapid succession availed them-
 selves of his profound knowledge and his con-
 summate skill as an administrator.
 He took leave of Princeton to direct the
 Office of Science and Technology.    In that
 office he is achieving distinction as a wise
 advisor to our President on scientific affairs.

 March 11, 1965          CONGRESSIONAL RECORD   SENATE
 A substantial reduction In imports is
 needed to prevent increasing and unneces-
 sary dependency on foreign oil. In addition,
 the resulting increase in domestic produc-
 tion would provide additional incentive to
 explore for and develop needed reserves.
 I am particularly disturbed by the enor-
 mous growth in imports into district V in
 relation to crude oil production.  I would
 hope that the Department of the Interior can
 take effective action to encourage the use in
 district V of the vast oil capability existing
 in the' Rocky Mountain area, particularly my
 State of Wyoming.  I would hope that it,
 would be possible to reduce greatly district V
 imports which now are running at the rate
 of to percent of the crude oil production for
 that area.
 The mandatory oil import program which
 was designed to implement this policy has
 been helpful in stemming the tide of foreign
 oil.  Without this program and the fine man-
 ner in which you have administered this pro-
 gram, Mr. Secretary, I am confident that the
 domestic petroleum producing industry-
 especially the independents-would be in
 shambles today.  This mandatory oil import
 program has served its purpose well.  But, it
 is a long way from its goal as laid down by
 our President when it was established in
 1059, as follows:
 "The new program is designed to insure a
 stable, healthy industry in the United States,
 capable of exploring for and developing new
 hemispheric reserves to replace those now
 being depleted.  The basis of the new pro-
 gram, like that of the voluntary program,
 is the certified requirements of our national'
 security which make it necessary that we
 preserve to the greatest extent possible a
 vigorous, healthy petroleum industry in the
 United States of America.
 In spite of the goal laid down in 1959, when
 the mandatory oil import program was es-
 tablished calling for reserves to replace those
 now being depleted, the domestic industry
 has suffered such a deterioration that, in
 4 of the past 7 years, this Nation has had
 'a deficit in crude oil reserves.  By that, I
 mean, we have found and developed less
 crude oil than we have produced in 4 of the
 past 7 years.  This is a serious situation and
 must be corrected.  One of the most impor-
 tant ways to restore the incentives needed
 to search for new oil reserves is to make
 meaningful adjustments in the mandatory
 oil import program.
 Mr. Secretary, we have a good broad based
 oil producing industry.  It is worth preserv-
 ing.                 As I mentioned earlier, there has been
 ar great sellout and merger trend over the past
 few years in this industry.  I am told that
 several billion dollars worth of oil properties
 have been purchased from the smaller oil
 companies by the giant oil companies in the
 past half dozen years.  This is not a healthy
 development.  This country needs the thou-
 sands of independent oilmen to scour this
 Nation in the search for oil,  This Nation's
 greatest oilfields, such as_ last Texas, might
 still be unknown were it not for the inde-
 pendent oilmen.
 Mr. Secretary;  our own report recently re-
 leased, states and I quote:
 "The independent has traditionally been
 the front-runner for the industry's explora-
 tion activities.                     He does most of the wildcat-
 ting and, according to industry' 'estimates,
 finds most of the oil, perhaps 80 to 85 per-
 This is good.                        Here is an 'industry that
 shows great competitive effort.  An industry
 where men still are willing to risk all of their
 economic wealth in the search of this vital
 commodity -petroleum,  We must maintain
 the independent if this industry is to meet
 the awesome future demands for crude oil
 and natural gas.
 How do ~ we', do it? -Si-ply by permitting
 the independent oil men to sell their prod-
 ucts at a fair price and in quantities suffi-
 dent to generate the funds needed to search
 for petroleum.  Today he is not able to do
 that, principally because of excessive im-
 ports of cheap foreign oil.
 Mr. Secretary, I have searched my mind
 on how best to restore some health to the
 independent.  I am sure you have also been
 scratching your head on what to do.
 I have talked with oil men back in Wyo-
 ming.  I have talked with my fellow Mem-
 bers of Congress, and we all agree that a
 substantial  reduction in  oil  imports will
 go a long way toward reversing the adverse
 trends in the domestic petroleum produc-
 ing industry.  I recognize that this-may not
 be a simple thing to do in view of our many
 international commitments, but it is a must
 if this vital national security industry is to
 survive and prosper.
 Finally, I wish to bring to your attention
 another situation which I consider uncalled
 for and one which needs to be rectified.  To-
 day, our military establishment purchases
 from  foreign sources over  200,000   barrels
 daily of jet fuel and gasoline which Is about
 35 percent of its requirements.  Of this to-
 tal purchased abroad, 35,000 barrels daily are
 imported into the United States where these
 products are readily available at reasonable
 prices.  These excessive purchases not only
 are harmful to the domestic petroleum in-
 dustry, but they also are aggravating our
 very serious balance-of-payments deficit.
 I believe that the military should:
 1. Forego the importation of 35,000 bar-
 rels daily.
 2. Purchase no more than 15 percent of
 its requirements from foreign sources, there-
 by resulting in increased domestic produc-
 tion and increased incentives to explore for
 .and develop needed reserves.  .
 I have studied the 11-point program sub-
 mitted to you by the Independent Petroleum
 Association of America.  To me it seems rea-
 4743'
 available that has put constant downward
 pressure on the price structure of domestic
 crude oil.  This has trapped the domestic
 operator between rising prices of materials
 and labor and the declining price for his
 product.  The recently released report of the
 Department of the Interior on the oil in-
 dustry recognized that under these circum-
 stances the position of the domestic operator
 is untenable.
 I wish to make the following recommenda-
 tions to the Department:
 1. That the level of imports of crude oil
 and crude oil products (except residual oil)
 into this country be fixed at 10 percent of
 domestic production.
 2. That the 10-percent figure be based on
 actual  production  during  the  preceding
 period rather than upon an estimate of the
 succeeding period.
 3. That the military branch of the Federal
 Government be required to increase their
 purchases  of  domestic  production,  thus
 stimulating the domestic market and at the
 same time assisting President Johnson's pro-
 gram to improve our overall balance of trade
 and arrest the drain on U.S. gold reserves.
 4. That no new foreign trade zone areas
 for petrochemical facilities be established, in
 order that the domestic industry might share
 in any increase in demand by virtue of petro-
 chemical operations.
 5. That overland importations be limited
 to actual certificated volumes rather than
 the nonrestrictive estimates currently in use.
 We believe that if these recommendations
 are followed, the domestic oil industry would
 experience a significant increase in activity
 which would benefit a large section of the
 Nation's economy.  Further, we believe that
 adherence  to  these  proposed  mandatory
 limitations would make a substantial contri-
 bution to improving our balance-of-trade
 deficits and dwindling gold reserves.

 tory oil import control program as now en-
 forced has been detrimental to the Interests
 of my State in particular, and to this country
 in general.
 Wyoming, like many other States, is highly
 dependent economically upon the level of
 oil  exploration  and production.   Table I,
 attached, shows the amount of money paid
 annually as property taxes on production
 within our State since 1959, and the percent-
 age of this figure to all the property taxes
 collected.  This table illustrates the signifi-
 cance of oil production to our State and
 county governments.
 Table II shows that production within
 Wyoming has steadily declined since 1961.
 It is even more alarming that the proven
 reserves within our State (table III) have
 also declined during the same period.  The
 reason for this decline in reserves is appar-
 ent from a study of table IV, which shows
 the number of exploratory wells drilled in
 Wyoming  since  1959.  Except  for  a  very
 modest increase in 1964, this trend has been
 steadily downward for the past 5 years.
 In the opinion of many experienced ob-
 servers of the oil economy, the reason for
 the decline iii domestic drilling must be tied
 directly to the oil import prograth "While
 allowable production from many domestic
 States is on the decline, the level of imports
 from. foreign countries is constantly in-
 creasing.              '

 urged that the issues there be brought to
 the conference table? It was little over
 a month since General Khanh's coup of
 January 30, 1964; and the New York
 Times was headlining the situation as
 "Vietnam Still Groping Month After
 Coup-Khanh Regime Fails To Justify
 Takeover by Military Gain." In the year
 since then, the headlines indicated in big
 type, day after day, week after week,
 month after month, the incompetence of
 the leaders of South Vietnam to form a
 government capable either of governing
 efficiently or of gaining the support of
 the people.  The same black headlines
 alternately signaled the ups and downs
 of the Khanh regime, his bickering with
 U.S. officials, with protest riots permitted
 and suppressed, and so on and on,
 through 12 dreary months of erosion of
 our position in that country.
 During this year, the facts fed to the
 American public were less than frank
 about the steadily deteriorating situation
 in South Vietnam.  The fact that the
 number of South Vietnamese becoming
 sympathetic with the Vietcong cause was
 growing daily was shrouded in the head-
 lines that Secretary of Defense McNa-
 mara was "optimistic over the outcome,"
 or "tells Johnson of gain in Vietnam."
 But both before the last year and dur-
 ing the last year, our own conduct-as
 well as that of the North Vietnamese-
 was not in accord with the provisions of
 the Geneva accord of 1954, which, among
 other things, limited the size of foreign
 military personnel  in Vietnam,  and
 promised elections to be held by July 20,
 1956.
 On the ground that the situation in
 North Vietnam would not permit the
 holding of free elections, the South Viet-
 namese Government has continued to op-
 pose the holding of the elections called
 for by the Geneva agreement.
 Our so-called military advisers in
 South Vietnam were steadily increasing,
 even before the current escalation. The
 pretense that our military men in South
 Vietnam were mere advisers was kept up
 before all the world, long after it became
 well known that they were in the front
 lines, fighting-and being killed and
 wounded-alongside South Vietnamese
 soldiers.
 Our actions in South Vietnam have
 tarnished our image before the world as
 a law-abiding nation.
 U.S. adherence to the United Na-
 tions imposed upon it certain legal ob-
 ligations under the charter of that or-
 ganization. That document, the primary
 purpose of which was to prevent war, im-
 poses  certain  prerequisites  upon  the
 parties to any dispute "likely to endanger
 the maintenance of international peace
 and security." There can be little doubt
 that the activities in South Vietnam con-
 stitute a dispute "likely to endanger the
 maintenance of international peace and
 security."
 What are the duties imposed by the
 charter of the United Nations upon
 parties to such a dispute?
 First, they must seek a solution by in-
 quiry.  This, the United States has not
 done.
 Second, they must seek a solution by
 mediation.  This, the United States has
 not done.
 March 11, 1965
 ONE YEAR LATER-"THE' UNITED
 STATES SHOULD GET OUT OF
 VIETNAM"
 Mr. GRUENING.  Mr. President, this
 is a speech which 1 year ago I had hoped
 I would never have to make.
 Exactly 1 year ago yesterday, I de-
 livered the first major speech in the Sen-
 ate an the subject of the tragic war in
 South Vietnam.  That speech was en-
 titled "The United States Should Get
 Out of Vietnam."
 Events in wartorn South Vietnam
 since I first spoke out on March 10 a year
 ago have served only to underscore the
 soundness of my original admonition.
 Twelve months later-after the expendi-
 ture of an additional $450 million, and
 after incurring at least 771 additional
 casualties in U.S. fighting men killed
 or injured-the United States is in an
 even worse position to take the war in
 Vietnam to the conference table than it
 was when I first urged that course of
 action on March 10 a year ago.
 In my speech at that time, I set forth
 a detailed analysis of how the United
 States had gotten itself mired in the
 steamy jungles of southeast Asia in a
 bloody foot war.
 I pointed out that up to 1954, during
 the time France had been fighting to re-
 conquer Vietnam after the war, we were
 helping France in that adventure with
 money.
 I pointed out then that Vietnam had
 been cruelly ruled and abused by China
 for a thousand years, and that those who
 predicted that, if the Vietnamese conflict
 were taken to the negotiating table, Ho
 'Chi Minh would immediately invite the
 Chinese Communists to refasten the yoke
 of subjugation around his neck, just were
 not taking into account the facts of his-
 tory.
 In my speech on March 10 a year ago,
 I pointed out that the war in South Viet-
 nam was a civil war, with South-Viet-
 namese relatives fighting South Viet-
 namese relatives.  The majority of the
 Vietcong are South Vietnamese.  That
 was true a year ago, and it is true today,
 even though in the interim the number
 of North Vietnamese infiltrators in South
 Vietnam may have increased even as has
 the number of so-called U.S. "advisers."
 I said then, and I repeat: The war in
 South Vietnam is not, and never has
 been, a United States war.  It is, and
 must remain, a fight to be fought and
 won by the people of South Vietnam
 themselves. The will to fight and to win
 must come from the spirit of the South
 Vietnamese.  The United States cannot
 instill that will in them.
 Since the fall of Diem on November
 1, 1963, there has been no stable govern-
 ment in South Vietnam.  And the dic-
 tatorship of Diem itself, before his fall,
 had become increasingly cruel and op-
 pressive.  No government anywhere can
 instill in its people a love of country and
 of government by wholesale deprivation
 of civil rights, through the harsh use of
 secret police or through the napalm
 bombing of women and children sus-
 pected of harboring the Vietcong, often-
 times their near relatives.
 What was happening in South Viet-
 nam on March 10 of last year, when I
 Third, they must seek a solution by
 conciliation.  This, the United States
 has not done.
 Fourth, they must seek a solution by
 arbitration.   This, the United States has
 not done.
 Fifth, they must seek a solution by
 judicial  settlement.  This,  the United
 States has not done.
 Sixth, they must seek a solution by re-
 sorting "to regional agencies or arrange-
 ments." This, the United States has not
 done.
 Seventh, they must seek a solution by
 resorting to "other peaceful means of
 their own choice."  This, the United
 States has not done.
 Instead, we have escalated the fighting
 by senseless bombings of installations in
 North Vietnam, which have succeeded
 only in frightening and alienating our
 friends and allies.  If the presence of the
 7th Fleet off the coast of North Vietnam
 cannot serve as a deterrent, how can
 strikes against military staging areas-
 easily replaceable-accomplish that pur-
 pose?
 In South Vietnam we are going it
 alone.  Only American fighting men are
 at the front, being wounded and getting
 killed, in addition to the South Viet-
 namese.  Our allies of the Southeast Asia
 Treaty Organization have not sent their
 troops to fight at the side of the U.S.
 troops. We do not see in the frontlines
 in South Vietnam the fighting men from
 Australia, France, New Zealand, Paki-
 stan, the Philippines, Thailand, or the
 United Kingdom-the other signatories,
 along with the United States, of the
 Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty.
 Of these signatories, only the United
 States has its men fighting along with
 the South Vietnamese.
 The voices of the people for a negotia-
 tion of the war in Vietnam are growing
 ever greater.
 In an excellent article published in
 the Long Island Press for February 28,
 1965, the columnist and radio commenta-
 tor, Bob Considine, asked the question:
 "Why Not Negotiate in Vietnam?"  He
 answered the question this way:
 It's time to fish or cut bait, a time to halt
 not doing either, and to hell with face.
 There is also a remarkable parallel
 between our actions in Vietnam and
 those of the French up until the disaster
 at Dienbienphu.  True, we are not, and
 never have been, trying to reimpose
 colonialism upon the Vietnamese people.
 But Diem was our man-we told the
 world so-and we were using AID money
 to propagandize the countryside, ttLus
 building up a false image for Diem, at
 the very time when his secret police were
 cruelly harassing the people, and the
 Vietnamese Air Force-in U.S. planes-
 was  bombing  women  and  children.
 Diem's image became our image.
 Is there any wonder why so many of
 the South Vietnamese lack the desire to
 fight-why South Vietnamese soldiers
 cannot be trusted to protect sleeping
 U.S.troops?
 In an interesting introduction to a new
 book, entitled "The Battle of Dienbien-
 phu" by the French author Jules Roy,
 Mr. Neil Sheehan, of the New York
 Times, sets out admirably the parallel

 1. The reaction to America's present pro-
 gram of airstrikes may be so intense in
 other  countries-in  the  United  Nations,
 Britain, the U.S.S.R. and France-that the
 United States will be forced by these third
 parties to come to a- negotiating table either
 at the United Nations, at Geneva or else-
 where.  There may be a strong call for a
 cease-fire and an attempt to get each side at
 least privately to indicate its basic condi-
 tions for negotiations.  Britain has sent one
 of  its responsible  Foreign  Office  officials,
 George Thompson, to Moscow for talks with
 the Soviet Government.
 2. A massive Chinese Intervention and a
 U.S. response could mean full-scale war in
 southeast Asia. It would be a ground war
 because Chinese intervention would move
 rapidly from air to ground since its air power
 is not great.
 This, it is believed, would force the United
 States into a ground response like Korea
 and would present it with grim decisions as
 to what weapons to use.  Here again, third
 powers would try to bring about a cease-fire
 and negotiations, but this would be far more
 difficult once Chinese and U .S. ground forces
 were committed.
 Chinese  interventions could  come  in
 phases: First, air support in attacking U.S.
 aircraft and air strikes against South Viet-
 nam; then the assignment of so-called vol-
 unteers to North Vietnam, freeing the North
 Vietnamese army to move south; finally, the
 Chinese themselves might move south with
 the North Vietnamese.
 3. South Vietnamese initiative could take
 the form either of a coup d'etat, replacing
 the present government with a neutralist
 regime that would invite the United States
 to leave; or South Vietnamese private con-
 versations with the Vietcong might arrange
 a settlement behind Uncle Sam's back and
 halt the war before it grows bigger.
 Informed authorities regard this alterna-
 tive as relative unlikely at the moment, since
 the country is enjoying a temporary unity
 and euphoria as a result of the American
 air strikes against the north.  However, it
 might come as a reaction to the second al-
 ternative-as the South Vietnamese became
 concerned about turning the whole country
 into a massive battlefield.
 4. This alternative-called "very unlikely"
 in Washington-would be for the United
 States to pull out under domestic, for in-
 stance, congressional pressure.
 Two lines of development are going on
 simultaneously.   One  is intensification  of
 U.S. strikes against the North, leading at
 some point  to Chinese Communist inter-
 vention and more general warfare.  The sec-
 ond is domestic and international pressure
 toward a negotiated solution,  The key ques-

 AFFIRMATIVE ALTERNATIVE IN VIETNAM
 (By SENATOR GEORGE S. MCGOVERN)
 To anyone taking a hard-headed, realistic
 look at the situation in South Vietnam it is
 somewhat puzzling that the  terms  "hard
 line" and "soft line" seem to be reversed when
 discussing that nation on the other side of
 the world.  Where Vietnam is concerned,
 those who discount the present and offer only
 hopes for the future are considered "hard"
 whereas those who look at the actual situa-
 tion and point to the current map of Com-
 munist-controlled areas of Vietnam are ac-
 cused of following a "soft line."
 It is both hard-in the sense of being diffi-
 cult-and hard-headed-in the sense of be-
 ing realistic-to admit honestly to ourselves
 what the facts are.
 We are not winning in South Vietnam.
 We are backing a government there that to
 incapable  either  of  winning  a  military
 stuggle or governing its people. We are light-
 ing a determined army of guerrillas that
 seems to enjoy the cooperation of the people
 in the countryside and that grows stronger
 in the face of foreign intervention, be it
 Japanese, French, or American.  In this cir-
 cumstance, the proposal to expand the Amer-
 ican military involvement would be an act of
 folly designed in the end to create a larger,
 more inglorious debacle.
 For nearly a quarter of a century, south-
 east Asia has been torn by military and po-
 litical conflict.  First, there was the Japanese
 invasion of World War II. Then came nearly
 a decade of struggle with the French culmin-
 ating in the collapse of the French army at
 Dienbienphu in 1954.  The French lost the
 cream of their army in an unsuccessful effort
 to reestablish French control over Indochina,.
 U.S. aid totaling $2 billion financed eighty
 percent of the French war effort.
 Then came the -radually deepening Ameri-
 can involvement in Southeast Asia in the ten
 years after 1954.  American expenditures in
 Vietnam, in addition to $2 billion in aid to
 the French, now approach $4 billion, and
 243 American have died trying to counsel and
 assist the Vietnamese forces.
 Yet we are further away from victory over
 the guerrilla forces in Vietnam today then
 we were a decade ago.  The recent confronta-
 tion of the Vietcong Communist guerrillas
 and the South Vietnamese army at Bin Ghia
 was a painful, dramatic demonstration that
 the struggle is going badly for our side.  Gov-
 ernment prestige was hurt seriously in that
 battle.   Communist  stock  has  gone       up.
 Concerned Americans are asking, "What has
 gone wrong?" and it seems a fair question.
 in my judgment, the first answer is that
 South Vietnam is not basically a military
 problem but a political one,  Neither the
 Diem regime nor its successors has won the
 political loyalty and active support of the
 people of South Vietnam, especially those
 who live outside town and city limits.
 There are rarely military answers to politi-
 cal. dilemma of this nature.  Military pro-
 posals in South Vietnam, whether for spe-
 cial forces, strategic hamlets, insurgency pro-
 grams, or more suitably-designed airplanes
 are not likely to overcome the political weak-
 nesses of the existing South Vietnamese
 Government.  Even the sophisticated weap-
 ons of the nuclear age cannot overrule the
 basic precepts of successful government.
 This is a political problem, and it is a
 South  Vietnamese  problem.   The  United
 States can accomplish much through foreign
 aid and military support, but we cannot
 create strong, effective, and popular national
 leadership where that leadership either does
 not exist or does not exert itself. That is not
 only expensive and impractical, it is just plain
 impossible.
 For 9 years the U.S. helped the Diem gov-
 ernment at a cost of $8 billion.                                                                          Diem's rule
 was marked by the  achievement of some
 measure  of  economic  stability, but  prin-
 cipally by an increasing political disaffection.
 That disaffection was encouraged by North
 Vietnam, but basically Diem's own arbitrary
 rule made possible Vietcong gains.     The very
 fact that Vietcong strength was and still is
 greatest in the Mekong Delta and around
 Saigon-more than a thousand miles away
 from North Vietnam-indicates that there is
 basic popular support for  the         guerrillas
 It is not isolationism, either of the old
 variety or the new, to recognize that U.S. ad-
 visers, however able, are simply no substitute
 for a competent and popular indigenous gov-
 ernment.  It Is not idealism either;  it is
 simply realism.  Only the Vietnamese them-
 selves can provide the leaders and the sus-
 tained support to defeat the Vietcong.  The
 United States can at most only hold a finger
 in the dike until the South Vietnamese find
 themselves.   Therefore,  even at this  11th
 hour, when there is mounting pressure to
 send more U.S. troops to South Vietnam and
 enlarge the conflict, we must be hard-headed
 realists.
 Americans in Asia are basically aliens, of a
 different race, religion, and culture.  More-
 over, the Vietnamese are nationalistic and
 race-conscious in their outlook.  As an on-
 the-scene observer pointed out, "If you imag-
 ine a Chinese sheriff speaking Cantonese
 and trying to keep order in Tombstone, Ariz.,
 in its heyday, you will begin to understand
 the problem."
 More American troops, in addition to the
 25,000 now in South Vietnam, would not
 necessarily mean more success, because vic-
 tory in the Vietnam countryside depends on
 accurate intelligence information, peasant
 support, and quick action by Vietnamese
 troops.  These factors cannot be controlled
 by Americans.  They must depend on the
 South Vietnamese, and we must recognize
 that fact.
 The more Americans are brought in to do
 what should be the responsibility of the Viet-
 namese Government, the greater will be the
 tendency of the Vietnamese Government to
 rely on United States advisers rather than on
 able Vietnamese;  the  greater will be  the
 prestige of the Vietcong and North Vietna-
 mese for holding at bay not merely their
 own countrymen but also the gathered might
 of the United States; and, finally, the greater
 will be the grassroots reaction against Amer-
 icans.  In theory, our Government has rec-
 ognized that the South Vietnamese bear pri-
 mary responsibility for the war and civilian
 policies.   In practice, Americans have  as-
 sumed roles of increasing influence and lead-
 ership with slight military gains but disturb-
 ing deterioration on the local political level.
 I for one am very much opposed to the pol-
 icy, now gaining support in Washington, of
 extending the war to the north.  I am dis-
 turbed by the recent reports of American air
 strikes in Laos and North Vietnam.
 Attacks on North Vietnam will not seri-
 ously weaken guerrilla fighters a thousand
 miles away, fighters who depend for 80 per-
 cent of their weapons on captured United
 States equipment and for food on a sym-
 pathetic local peasantry.  The principal foe
 is not the limited industrial capacity of North
 Vietnam, not the North Vietnamese who have
 remained at home, nor even their training
 camps and trails.  It is the 30,000 individual
 guerrilla fighters from North and South who
 have no trouble finding sanctuary within
 South Vietnam or the neighboring states of
 Laos and Cambodia.  Bombing North Viet-
 nam is not calculated to reduce their deter-
 mination, but undoubtedly it would antag-
 onize many other Asians and could easily
 lead to increased Communist Chinese in-
 volvement in the whole Indo-Chinese penin-
 sula.
 The  only  viable  policy  for  the  United
 States in Vietnam is negotiation and a po-
 litical settlement.                                                                                                                                   Until such time as ne-
 gotiation is possible and a settlement can
 be devised which does not surrender South
 Vietnam to communism, the United States
 would doubtless not find it feasible to with-
 draw.  But the aim of our current policy
 must be seen as a prelude to diplomatic
 settlement  and not  an occasion for war
 against North Vietnam, or, even worse, Com-
 munist China.
 There are many different ways to approach
 such a diplomatic settlement.  Last August,
 I suggested we might take up French Presi-
 dent Charles de Gaulle's proposal for an
 international  conference,  including  the
 United States, the Soviet Union,  Britain,
 France, China, Malaya, Thailand, Laos, Cam-
 bodia, Burma, Canada, Poland, India, and
 North and South Vietnam.  More recently,

 You cannot put yourselves in a position
 where you impose good works on the poverty
 stricken.   Such an approach is doomed to
 failure.
 The effective implementation of the com-
 munity action program will be based, in large
 measure, on the willingness of local com-
 munities to expand the base of decision-
 making for programs affecting the poor.
 Education, health, welfare, and manpower
 programs can no longer be developed solely
 by the social and economic elite and the
 professionals on behalf of the poor.

 Mr. SCOTT.  Mr. President, I ask

 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 peace in the Middle East depends on
 whether the Arab- States carry out their
 plans to choke off Israel's just share of
 water.
 Israel desperately needs more defense
 arms, in order to protect herself against
 the increasing threats and pressures of
 the Arab States.  Dictator Nasser, by
 threatening to recognize East Germany,
 forced the Federal Republic of West Ger-
 many into canceling its arms contracts
 with Israel. Approximately $37 million
 of the agreed $90 million of vital defen-
 sive  arms will not be shipped to the
 Israeli people at a time when the defense
 of their country against the Arab States
 is so urgently needed.
 Although in 1962 we loaned Israel the
 money with which to buy short-range
 Hawk missiles, to counterbalance Egypt's
 ground-to-air missiles and supersonic
 otherwise provided Israel with military
 equipment. The United States however,
 does provide arms for several Arab
 States.
 Since the present imbalance in the
 Middle East not only threatens the state
 of Israel, but also is a threat to peace it-
 self in that important part of the world,
 I make the following proposals:
 First. The United States should allow
 Israel to purchase additional defensive
 weapons for air defense.
 Second. Since Israel has no effective
 counter to Egypt's fleet of fast patrol
 boats carrying ship-to-shore missiles-
 which are capable of doing severe dam-
 age to Israel's coastal cities-I urge that
 the United States supply Israel with the
 needed arms with which to defend itself
 against these missile-laden boats.
 Third. The  United   States   should
 declare that it views as a threat to peace
 the present Arab "spite" plan to cut off
 Israel's water supply.
 Dictator Nasser has proven by his
 actions that his intentions toward con-
 quest go beyond the borders of Israel.
 He continues to back the Congolese
 rebels, and otherwise upset central Afri-
 can conditions. He is presently central escalat-

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. GEORGE D. AIKEN
 OF VERMONT
 IN THE SENATE, OF THE UNITED STATES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 Mr.  AIKEN.                          Mr.  President,  since
 snuffboxes and the quality of the snuff, as
 it used to be found in the senate, has
 been the subject of some discussion in
 and outof the, press, and since our old
 friend and former colleague, Ralph Flan-
 ders, was the Senate's foremost expert on
 snuffboxes and the quality of the snuff, in
 order to try to clear up the situation-al-
 though probably it never can be cleared
 up  satisfactorily to  everyone-I ask
 unanimous consent to have printed in the
 Appendix of the RECORD a column which
 appears in News and Notes, a publication
 of the Vermont Historical Society, issue
 of March 1965, the title of which is "Not
 up to Snuff."
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 NOT UP TO SNUFF
 As reported in a recent Washington news-
 paper the furnishings of the V.S. Senate
 Chamber includes two snuffboxes.  It ap-
 pears that the last user thereof was none
 other than  our former Senator, Ralph E.
 Flanders.  That gentleman, after 7 years' ab-
 sence, returned to the Senate, not to view any
 legislation but to check on the snuffboxes.
 He was mortified to find that the snuff was
 not fresh but dry and old.  Feeling that the
 Senate Members had drifted away from more
 elegant habits, he stomped out declaring,
 "Tradition is tradition."
 This note was contributed by tongue-in-
 cheek Charles Morrissey of the J. F. Kennedy
 Library.  The above is substantially the ver-

 ton Post.                   Below is the episode as recounted
 by Senator Flanders in a letter to Mr, Dixon:
 "DEAR FRIEND DIXON:  I was much amused
 by your reference to the snuffboxes and my-
 selt in your Saturday column.  It seems to
 me that you ought to know' a little more
 of the history of this Subject which until now
 has been kept a secret from the west side
 of the aisle of the Senate Chamber.
 "After I had been in the Senate long
 enough to feel at home, the thought occurred
 to  me that all  new Republican  Senators
 should be .ceremonially indoctrinated with
 the principles of  the Founding Fathers.
 What better ceremony could be devised than
 that of taking snuff as they did so habitu-
 ally?                                                                             With this thought in mind I led each
 new  arriving  Republican  Senator  to  the
 snuffbox and with him took a ceremonial
 pinch of the nose-tickling stuff, at the same
 time ceremonially impressing on him the
 duty of following the principles of those for
 whom the stuff was originally provided.
 "Indoctrination  was successful  in  every
 case except one.   Senator GORDON ALLOTT, of
 Colorado, refused to sneeze.  No matter how
 much snuff he sniffed he either would not
 or could not sneeze.  Just what this means
 doctrinally I have never been able to find
 out.  Physically it is unique.
 "When I left I draped the shoulders of
 Senator Keating with the mantle of freshman
 Republican indoctrination but learned to my
 sorrow that he had not at all times and
 with all candidates fulfilled his responsibili-
 ties.                                                                             He, alas, no longer is to be seen on the
 Senate floor except as a privileged ex-Sen-
 ator like myself.
 "This is the full story of the senatorial
 snuffboxes, so far as I am concerned, though
 you are right in saying that I insisted on
 the material being kept fresh and snuffable.

 Why oWe in Southeast Asia?
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. LESTER L. WOLFF
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 Mr. WOLFF.                                                        Mr. Speaker, I have
 just received an editorial from Mr. Harry
 F. Guggenheim, president and publisher
 of Newsday, one of the Nation's leading
 dailies, which I should like to call to the
 attention of this august body. Newsday's
 position is in consonance with mine and I
 am happy to see the leadership they
 have displayed in bringing our aims in
 southeast Asia to the attention of the
 people of Long Island.
 Mr. Speaker, under leave to extend my
 remarks, I include the following edi-
 torial:
 WHY ARE WE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA?
 Recently a highly respected and patriotic
 Senator,  ERNEST  GRUENING,  Democrat,  of
 Alaska, said: "All of southeast Asia is not
 worth the life of one American boy."   The
 life of an American boy is precious; so is
 the life of any boy the world over.
 From the beginning of time animals, in-
 cluding humans, have destroyed each other.
 The futility of such destruction is apparent,
 especially to such enlightened human beings
 as Senator GRUENING.  He, however, qualifies
 his position by implying that there may be
 places where Americans should fight-but
 not in southeast Asia. There are some who
 believe that life is so precious that it must
 never be subjected to loss in battle.  Others
 believe that there is one cause worth fight-
 ing for, and that is to preserve existence as
 freemen.  Most Americans are willing and
 ready to fight for their freedom.
 Are we fighting for freedom in Vietnam?
 A1115
 The world ' today' is half slave  under the
 tyranny of dominating war lords preaching
 communism.  It is free only in the democ-
 racies of free enterprise.  The material and
 spiritual wealth of the world lies outside
 communism's domain.
 The dictators who dominate the lands of
 communism exhort and drive their people
 to plunder the free world.  They want to
 communize the entire world-"a demand by
 the sick that the healthy be cured."  Khru-
 shchev  once  said:  "We  shall  bury                                                                                                                                           you."
 China's Mao holds: "There is no such thing
 as peaceful coexistence."
 Assuming that Communist world leaders
 would destroy us if they could, how does that
 justify our fighting in Vietnam 8,000 miles
 from our homeland?
 To preserve our continental United States
 we need allies and strong military bases for
 our survival.  We have protection for our
 Atlantic coast washed by a great ocean whose
 waters join us with our allies in the free
 world.  Our Pacific coast is washed by waters
 joined to our enemies of the Communist
 world.  In these waters we have strong ad-
 vance island bases and allies for the protec-
 tion of the Pacific frontier.  Australia, New
 Zealand, the Philippines, Japan, and Na-
 tionalist China are at our side.  Their good-
 will and their lands are available for our
 common defenses.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. MAURINE B. NEUBERGER
 OF OREGON
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 - Mrs. NEUBERGER.  Mr. President,
 problems facing the west coast lumber
 industry were analyzed in an article
 published in the monthly review of the
 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
 Although our domestic lumber industry
 is faced with severe competitive pres-
 sures, the Federal Reserve bank analy-
 sis does not discount its future prospects
 for growth and expansion.  The article
 emphasizes that efficient elements in the
 western lumber industry promise to
 maintain a healthy position, through
 better utilization and increased process-
 ing of timber.
 I ask unanimous consent that the-ar-
 ticle be printed in the Appendix of the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 LUMBER:  OUT ON A LIMB?
 The West long has been the dominant
 lumber-producing                             region  in  the  Nation.
 Nowhere In the world is there concentrated
 on such a relatively small area of forest land
 such a rich reservoir of old-growth timber.
 Yet, despite its wealth in raw material and
 its strong production record,                            the western
 lumber  industry  has  faced  a  number  of
 severe challenges over the last decade. Beset
 by strong and growing competition from
 other producers (foreign and domestic) and
 from other building materials    (wood and
 nonwood), the industry has seen prices fall,
 employment decline, and hundreds of small
 mills go out of business.  But current efforts
 to improve lumber's position-along with the
 trend toward greater integration with the
 pulp and paper and plywood industries-offer
 hope that the western forest products com-
 plex will yet reach new heights of production

 Sixty-three Congressmen Urge Full Use
 of Federal Powers To Prevent Further
 Violence in Selma, Ala., and Call for
 Legislation Protecting the Right To
 Vote
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR.
 OT MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, February 23, 1965
 Mr.    CONYERS.  Mr.  Speaker,  63
 Members of the House of Representa-
 tives, 52 Democrats and 11 Republicans,
 Joined on March 10, 1965, in sending a
 telegram to President Johnson urging
 him to use the. full powers of his office
 to prevent further violence in Selma,
 Ala.  The 63 Congressmen also sup-
 ported additional legislation which will
 provide Federal remedies to those citi-
 zens of Alabama. and elsewhere in Amer-
 ica who are,being denied the right to
 vote by discriminatory and arbitrary
 methods.
 I am using this previously granted
 permission to extend my remarks in the
 CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD  to express my
 great .admiration. and respect for these
 63  colleagues-and the  many  other
 Members who have sent similar messages
 to the President-for expressing their
 feeling that the recent events in Selma,
 Ala., have been so serious that Federal
 action is piecessary.
 Mr, Speaker, if you will excuse me a
 certain amount of parochial pride, I
 would like to point out that all the mem-
 bers of the Michigan delegation, Demo-
 crats               and Republicans, joined in a
 separate telegram to President Johnson
 urging the maximum use of Federal
 power to prevent further violence and to
 protect constitutional rights in Selma,
 Ala.  I and particularly proud to serve
 with a State delegation that is so con-
 cerned about finally winning the struggle
 to achieve human dignity for every
 American citizen.
 I also want to express my admiration
 for those Members who made such co-
 gent and eloquent remarks here on the
 floor of the House about the responsibil-
 ity of the Federal Government to protect
 Americans using  their  constitutional
 rights from the brutal use of power by
 local police officials.  I noted with great
 interest that so many Members have
 pointed out that the events in Selma
 illustrated the critical need for Federal
 legislation authorizing Federal voting
 registrars, in those areas where local offi-
 cials refuse to register qualified Ameri-
 can citizens,  Many Members have also
 ,discussed the need to eliminate the use
 of literacy tests as a means of arbitrarily
 discriminating against Negro Americans.
 Mr. Speaker, I ask that the telegram
 to President Johnson and the list of 63
 Congressmen who signed it be printed in
 the RECORD immediately following my
 remarks.
 We Members of the House of Representa-
 tives urge you to use the full powers of your
 office to prevent further violence in Selma,
 Ala., against Negro Americans, striving to
 gain their right to register and vote who are
 relying on the first amendment's guarantee
 of "The right of the people peaceably to as-
 semble and petition the Government for
 redress of grievances."
 We feel that local law and order has broken
 down in Selma, Ala., just as it did in Little
 Rock, Ark., on September 24, 1957, Oxford,
 Miss., on September 30, 1962, and various
 Alabama,communities on June 11 and Sep-
 tember 10, 1963, when two of your prede-
 cessors, one a Democrat and one a Republi-
 can, relied on their powers under sections
 332, 333, 334, title 10, United States Code, to
 suppress domestic violence, unlawful com-
 binations, conspiracies depriving American
 citizens of rights secured to them by the U.S.
 Constitution and Federal law.
 The disgraceful and arbitrary exercise of
 the State police powers in Selma, Ala., on
 Sunday, March S. 1965, dramatically de-non-
 strated that State and local officials not only
 permitted but participated in an illegal and
 brutal suppression of a peaceful assembly by
 Negro citizens protesting the denial of their
 right to vote.
 We feel confident that you will utilize all
 the resources of your office, both moral sua-
 sion and any Federal troops or marshals that
 might be needed, to remedy the violation of
 the Bill of Rights in Selma, Ala.
 We further urge you to endorse additional
 legislation which will provide Federal rem-
 edies to those citizens of Alabama and else-
 where in America who are being denied their
 right to vote by discriminatory and arbi-
 trary methods.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ROBERT E. SWEENEY
 OF OHIO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 Mr. SWEENEY.                                          Mr. Speaker, it is a
 sincere pleasure for me today to call the
 attention of my colleagues in tribute to
 a man who has made himsef a legend in
 his hometown and who is affectionately
 known there as "Mr. Broadway-55th,"
 my friend, Mr. Charlie Hronek, of Cleve-
 land, Ohio.
 The fine editorial in the. Cleveland
 Press under date of February 17, 1965,
 by its editor, Louis B. Seltzer, gives ex-
 pression to the warm feelings of the
 many people of Cleveland who know
 Charlie and have been inspired by his
 dedication to his community and his
 neighbors. _
 With your permission, I include the
 editorial as follows:
 It was something like 45 years ago and this
 was the first time he had ever presided at a
 meeting where there  was an "imported"
 speaker.
 And it was the first time that I have ever
 spoken formally before any public group.
 We were both about the same height, and
 weight, and age-and, as it turned out in
 noon-hour conversation, of the same tem-
 perament, and enjoyed the same interests.
 We became friends.
 "I will never leave Broadway and 55th," he
 told me.  "This is where I will make my
 entire life.  I love this 'Zizkov' area and want
 more than anything else to help build it
 along with the rest of the city."
 I. confided In him my own love for Greater
 Cleveland.
 "Like yourself, Charlie, I have determined
 never to leave Cleveland, my native city,"
 I said.  "Only the other day I was invited to
 go to Washington.  It was an attractive offer.
 Marion and I decided against it.
 "We want to stay here. You came to the
 Broadway-55th area almost before you could
 either walk or talk.  You love It.  The people
 love you.  Your work and interests will keep
 you here.  We both can make careers  in
 our own    community-and let us keep in
 touch with each other."
 Charlie Hronek gave me a better introduc-
 tion than my first speech deserved.                                                                                                                                       Never-
 theless, it was one of the most enjoyable
 experiences of my life.  And I had made a
 new friend--one who was to be a friend all
 of our mutual lives.
 That friendship has now lasted more than
 45 years.  We have met many times.      We
 have  reminisced  many   times.   We  have
 talked glowingly  about  the  future  many
 times.  With Charlie Hronek it was always
 about his beloved Broadway-55th area, and
 with an affectionate intensity that multi-
 plied with the passing years.

 The other Sunday night we were once
 more together, at a church sheeting (in'the
 church, Our Lady of Lourdes, over which
 our mutual friend, the late Monsignor Old-
 rich Zlatnal, presided for so many years).
 once again I was the scheduled speaker.
 Once again-as many years before--Charlie
 Hronek was at the speaker's table.  And
 once again two friends reviewed the past
 and attempted to visualize the future.
 After I had talked, "Mr. Broadway-55th"
 slyly remarked:
 "Louie, you've improved after 45 years."
 "Charlie," I replied, "I had to-there was
 a long way to go after that first one."
 the other day Charlie Hronek had a birth-
 day.  Broadway-55th turned out for it. The
 immigrant boy from Bohemia who has dedi-
 cated his whole life to the vast neighbor-
 hood he loves expressed its affection and re-
 gard for him.
 The people in the Broadway-55th area re-
 member the endless list of things Charlie
 Hronek  has  done.   They  remember  how
 Charlie and Leonard Smith organized the
 Broadway-55th   Association.    How  they
 helped the churches, the businesses, the pub-
 lic problems, inspired others to love and
 affection for Broadway-55th-stimulated a
 pride which has ruggedly reflected itself in
 the way homes and businesses and family
 gathering places have been maintained and
 protected.
 For 46 years Charlie Hronek has particl-
 pated in virtually every important civic, relf-
 gious and cultural event in the old Broad-
 way area.  He has been a friend to all of the
 old and new leaders there for a half century.
 People in old Broadway still talk about
 Charlie Hronek's valiant efforts to make sure
 no depositor in the  old Atlas Savings &
 Loan Association was hurt when it closed
 during the depression of the 1930's, along
 with other. banks and savings and loan com-
 panies.
 Honors have been reciprocally bestowed
 upon Charlie by "his people"-president of
 St. Joseph Society No. 156, Czech Catholic
 Union; vice president of the National Czech
 Catholic Union;  president of the District
 Alliance of Czech Catholics; past president
 of Ceska Sin Carlin Hall; president of the
 St. Wenceslas Day Committee, and a director
 of the National Alliance of Czech Nationals.
 He is recognized as one of the foremost
 Czech leaders in America.  Whenever  the
 subject of Bohemian culture is discussed the
 conversation usually turns toward the great
 Bohemian band organized by the young,
 dedicated, and enthusiastic Charlie Hronek
 46 years ago.
 Perhaps one of the foremost recollections
 of the people In old Broadway--and in all
 of Greater Cleveland, for that matter-is how
 Charlie Hronek conceived the original Idea
 for the great annual Czech pilgrimage to
 St. Anthony's Shrine in Chatham, Canada.
 They also talk about how Charlie went on
 the pilgrimage this past year and returned a
 well man.
 Out in the old Broadway area they do a
 great deal of talking about Charlie Hronek-
 the boy who came there, stayed, and gave
 his heart, and life, and devotion to the
 Broadway-55th area he has made so extrica-
 ble a part of his whole being.
 Some of us who have watched Charlie
 Iironek in his lifelong dedication and cease-
 less effort to make his beloved Broadway-
 55th area good in both the sight of men
 and God not only respect anti admire him
 for It, but venerate him, also, As does every-
 body In the whole old Broadway area.
 He truly Is "Mr. Broadway-55th" in every
 sense of the phrsase-in every part of his
 being.  As a lifelong friend I join in wishing
 Charlie Hronek a belated but earnest happy
 birthday-and many more in the future,
 The War in Vietnam-XIL
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. THADDEUS J. DULSKI
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 Mr. DULSKI.             Mr.  Speaker, under
 leave to extend my remarks, I wish to in-
 elude the 12th in a series of a report
 on Vietnam by Mr. Lucian C. Warren,
 Washington correspondent for the Cou-
 rier-Express, Buffalo, N.Y. Mr. Warren
 recently returned from Vietnam and part
 XII, which appeared in the Courier-Ex-
 press, on March 4, 1965, follows:
 THE WAR IN VIETNAM, 7 II-VICTORY POSSIBLE
 STILWELL ASSERTS
 (By Lucian C. Warren)
 (NOTE -Maj. Gen. Richard G.  Stilwell,
 who grew up in Buffalo and was graduated
 from Bennett High School, ranks third in
 command of the U.S. forces which are help-
 ing South Vietnam in its fight against Com-
 munism Infiltrators.   Here General Stilwell,
 a member of the 1933 class at West Point,
 discusses with Lucian C. Warren, Washington
 correspondent for the Courier-Express, the
 complicated military and political problems
 facing the Saigon Government.)
 SAIGON.-Buffalo's  Maj. Gen. Richard G.
 Stilwell feels that victory Is possible in south-
 east Asia.
 "I say the war can be won," the chief of
 staff of the U.S. Military Assistance Com-
 mand, Vietnam, declared in an exclusive in-
 terview.  "It can be lost, too, but there's no
 damn reason why it should."
 However, there are numerous pitfalls and
 obstacles that in some ways make this a war
 harder to light than World War II and Korea,
 the general asserted in two sessions with this
 correspondent, lasting well over an hour.
 The main problems, he indicated, were the
 sanctuary from which the North Vietnamese
 has operated to export supplies and men to
 subvert the independent nation to the south.
 and the political problems of a still unstable
 South Vietnamese Government.
 STAFF CHrer
 General Stilwell is the third highest rank-
 Ing officer with the U.S. military forces here,
 serving directly under the overall commander,
 Gen. William C. Westmoreland, and his de-
 puty commander, Lt. Gen. John L. Throck-
 morton.  He has been in South Vietnam for
 nearly 2 years, serving as assistant chief of
 staff for operations until last April, when he
 became chief of staff.
 He is the son of the late William G. Stilwell
 and of Mrs. Mina Stilwell Hamilton, of 352
 Parkridge Avenue, Buffalo.  His wife is the
 former Alice K. Simpson of Buffalo.  Mrs.
 Stilwell and their three younger children, act-
 Ing under orders from President Johnson
 directing all military men's dependents in
 South Vietnam to be evacuated, recently left
 for temporary residence in Honolulu.
 IN THREE  MAJOR  WARS
 An active participant in the three major
 wars which the United States has fought in
 the last 25 years, General Stilwell declines
 to say that this one is nastier than the other
 two.
 There were plenty of atrocities In the ear-
 lier wars, he said.
 Nevertheless, the present ground rules un-
 der which the war in South Vietnam is being
 fought complicates the task of winning it,
 he maintains.
 World War It, in which he was an opera-
 tions officer for a tough hombres division and
 a later assistant chief of staff for G-3 of the
 22d Army Corps, was described by Stilwell as
 a total engagement where our combat forces
 could be fully utilized In the simple objective
 of annihilating the enemy.
 KOREAN  STRUGGLE
 Korea, where the Buffalo military man led
 the 15th Infantry Regiment of the 3d Infan-
 try Division in combat and later was a senior
 adviser to the Korean Army Corps, was not
 a total engagement of the enemy forces, Stil-
 well points out.  Because of the sanctuary
 the Chinese Reds enjoyed north of the Yalu
 River, the war in Korea was limited as to
 battleground and weapons and on terms of
 overall forces engaged.
 "But even in Korea," he explained, "there
 was no limitation on  the employment of
 weapons in the hands of the U.S, forces."
 Incidentally,  the general  feels that the
 United States might have gotten away with
 bombing north of the Yalu River as far as the
 Korean war was concerned, but there might;
 have been repercussions by Russian military
 threats in Europe,  where NATO  was still
 weak.
 VIEW ON MAC ARTHUR CASE
 General Stilwell also believes that Presi-
 dent Truman had no alternative in firing
 Gen. Douglas MacArthur for insubordination,
 even though General Stilwell has the greatest
 respect for MacArthur as a "soldier, a com-
 mander, a war strategist, and a dedicated
 Patriot."
 Continuing with his war comparisons, Stil-
 well noted that even in Korea "we still were
 fighting a conventional war, with an Identifi-
 able enemy organization.  It was a war where
 we could plot our positions on the map and
 prepare strong defenses on the ground."
 The general paused, shook his head sadly,
 then commented:
 "But we do not have this situation in
 South Vietnam.  We are not directly con-
 fronting the enemy on the ground.  And we
 are providing operational support assistance
 in this battle, rather than directly engaging
 the enemy."
 COMPLICATED TASK
 The task is immensely complicated, the
 general declared, because the objective to
 knock out the enemy's armed capability is
 proving extremely difficult without the de-
 struction also of his political organization.
 As long as the North Vietnamese have their
 sanctuary north of the 17th parallel, the
 enemy's political organization cannot be de-
 stroyed.
 "Probably," Stilwell reflected, "the maxi-
 mum we can expect in this war is to force
 the enemy to suspend action if he finds the
 engagement has become too costly. However,
 I do not see how we can force him to de-
 mobilize under the present ground rules."'
 Frustrated by limitations on annihilating
 the enemy, the United States is also frus-
 trated by the nature of Its relations with its
 ally, South Vietnam.
 'PROBLEMS
 The United States cannot exercise full con-
 trol over the military or "pacification" opera
 tions of the South Vietnamese Government.
 A language barrier and differing cultural anc
 political traditions are also obstacles to a
 smooth joint conduct of the war against the
 Vietcong.
 Stilwell suggests the successful conduct of
 the war against the Vietcong is directly re-
 lated to the stability of the South Vietnamese
 Government.  He pointed out that the war
 was going relatively well until the Diem gov-
 ernment was overthrown in May 1963, after
 which there was a serious deterioration of the
 ,South  Vietnamese-United  States  military
 position and a resulting buildup of Vietcong
 strength.

 .. ,   VITAL FACTOR
 "I feel very strongly that one of-the indis-
 pensable conditions for an upward trend in
 our fight against the Vietcong is a stable and
 strong government apparatus at the national
 and provincial level," he maintains.  "In the
 long run, we cannot have an effective mili-
 tary machine without  a  viable political
 framework In which to operate."
 The general is in agreement with an as-
 sessment of the current military situation in
 South Vietnam that over the last year the
 United States-Vietnamese military political
 efforts have gone downhill in relation to the
 area and population under control by the
 Vietcong.
 HOPEFUL
 But he made it clear that the United States
 military strength has also increased and he
 has hopes that if the new civilian South
 Vietnamese Government becomes strong and
 stable, the military tide can well turn against
 the Vietcong..
 "The National Government must provide
 the resources with which to provide a good
 framework of Government if successful mili-
 tary operations are to be achieved," he in-
 sists.  And  by a  strong government,  he
 doesn't mean one controlled by the military.
 "I feel very strongly that the chief execu-
 tive must be a civilian," he said.
 Given a strong government, Stilwell sees
 the possibility of a stepped-up political-
 Military offensive against the Hanoi-directed
 war of subversion that might well force the
 main bulk of the enemy to withdraw, leav-
 ing only the so-called national liberation
 front to operate on a small, easily contained
 scale,
 SUMMARY OF VIEWS
 "This contest," says the general in sum-
 mary, "can be resolved in a manner compat-
 ible with U,S. objectives and compatible with
 the desires of the local populace.
 "It can be, but whether it will be or not,
 depends on the collective will and determi-
 nation and the energetic action of the people
 of South Vietnam and America.
 "Yes, the condition could arise where we
 would have to pull out of South Vietnam in
 defeat.  But this will only happen if we are
 weak and stupid in the execution of our
 policies."
 Not all the interview was about war.
 The general spoke with great affection
 about his Buffalo background.
 RECALLS. SCHOOL CHUMS
 A graduate of Bennett High School in 1933,
 he recalled that he was chummy with a group
 there that jncluded Paul J, Keeler, son of
 City Judge Patrick Keeler, Clarence Buch-
 wald and John. Sheldon,  Keeler is now a
 New York City attorney, Buchwald a Seneca
 Falls busjnessman, and Sheldon an executive
 of the Hewitt Rubber Co. in the Philadephia
 area.
 He also got to know his future wife at
 Bennett and she was graduated there the
 same year.
 "But I really didn't have a chance with
 her until I got my uniform," he said smil-
 ingly.  Their romance was carried on while
 she was a student at Beaver College, Jenkin-
 town, Pa., and he was at West Point, and
 they were married soon after his graduation
 from the Military Academy in 1938.  The
 general is proud that he later became com-
 mandant at West Point.
 ATHLETE
 The general remembers that he went out
 for track atBennett, but won no great dis-
 tinction as a high school athlete.  He did
 enjoy, however, being a member of the West
 Side Rgwin~g Club crew.  And he's grateful
 t0 the' late,Rppresentative WalterG, Andreyrs
 of Buffalo, for his West Point appointment
 after he had been recommended by a selec-
 tion board consisting of the principals of
 Buffalo area schools.
 General Stilwell was last innBuffalo in Jan-
 uary 1963, when he made the principal
 speech at the Eagle Scout recognition cere-
 mony.
 An insight into the love the general has
 for Buffalo is provided in the opening re-
 marks of this talk.
 REMARKS CITED
 He said then:
 '.'It is a great personal honor to participate
 in this ceremony.  It is an honor because
 my roots are in this, the Queen City of the
 Great Lakes.
 ",It is here that I, like you, participated in
 the wonderful world of scouting; attended
 elementary  and  then high school;  was a
 member of a church ?and. drew sustenapce
 from its activities; experienced all the chal-
 lenges and delights of youth, and, above all,
 was molded by a Christian homeenvironment
 and guided by the love and devotion of my
 two parents.
 "Through 5 years of college at Brown and
 West Point, and 25  years of Government
 service all over the world, I have become
 increasingly conscious that the cumulative
 intakes from my Buffalo boyhood have pro-
 vided  the  mental,                                                                                  physical,  and  moral
 foundations which  have sustained me in
 hours of crisis."

 17 EXTENSION TENSION N OF REMARKS
 HON. ROBERT W. KASTENMEIER
 OF WISCONSIN ,
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 Mr. KAS PENMEIER.  Mr. Speaker,
 much thought is being given to our policy
 in South Vietnam and many arguments
 are being offered almost daily in the edi-
 torial pages of the great newspapers of
 this country.  I found the thoughtful
 analysis of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch
 editorial which was reprinted in the Mad-
 ison Capital Times on February 26, 1965,
 realistic and helpful to me in evaluating
 our policy in southeast Asia.  I am in-
 serting this editorial in the RECORD SO
 that others can have the opportunity to
 study it:
 [From the Madison (Wis.) Capital Times,
 Feb. 26, 19651
 ILLUSIONS AND FALSE ANALOGIES
 Assuming that there is still time to think
 about Vietnam-that the deadly cycle of mil-
 itary escalation is not yet irreversible-Amer-
 loans should examine the validity of the offi-
 cial rationale for the "reprisal" bombings of
 North Vietnam.
 The rationale is that attacks on South Viet-
 namese and  American  bases are  planned,
 armed, and supplied predominantly from the
 north, and that the attacks will stop if we
 hit the north hard enough.
 The fatal flaw in this theory is that the
 major portion of the weapons used by the
 Vietcong are American weapons, captured,
 and turned against us.  While supplies from
 the north undoubtedly help the Vietcong,
 there is little basis.for supposing that they
 are indispenable, or that the Vietcong would
 fade away if supply lines could be cut-even
 if the lines could, be. cut by air action alone,
 which is most improbable.
 Should It not be clear by now that we are
 not .dealing with a simple case of external
 aggression, as the official policy of our Gov-
 ernment assumes? If after 10 years'of stead-
 ily increasing American aid the South Viet-
 A1125,
 names  Gov.@xnmerLt,ls, weaker,than, it.was
 before, then something other than externally
 supported subversion must be involved.
 All the evidence points to a high degree
 of local sympathy or outright support for the
 Vietcong as a major element in its success.
 The bombing of North Vietnam does not
 touch this source of conflict and probably
 strengthens it. '
 The false assumption of external aggres-
 sion as the essential element in the situation
 is strategic as well as tactical.  It is one of
 the major reasons our forces are in Vietnam.
 Apologists for official policy are fond of
 quoting Churchill's warning after the parti-
 tion of Czechoslovakia in 1938-"The belief
 that security can be obtained by throwing
 a small state to the wolves is a fatal delusion."
 Czechoslovakia, however, was a victim of
 direct external aggression.  What we face in
 Vietnam is the quite different problem of an
 indigenous revolution, 25 years in the mak-
 ing, which has succeeded in ending French
 colonialism and  withstanding  10 years  of
 American intervention.
 In such a situation even our great military
 strength does not give us power to decide,
 by a simple deicsion to fight, that a small
 state shall be "saved."  It is one thing to go
 to the aid of a nation under overt attack, and
 another to interfere in a local revolution, in
 which the essential element is not external
 aid but the people themselves.  Only they
 can "win the war," and after 10 years of not
 winning, South Vietnam's will and capacity
 to do so must.now be doubted.
 Some Americans, of course, believe that
 it is our national mission to police the world,
 particularly to police it against revolution.
 That belief, in our view, is as immature as
 Isolationism was, and Indeed may well be
 an overreaction to isolationism.
 The United States tried to turn its back
 on the world, and failed; participation in the
 second world war established firmly the com-
 monsense proposition that for America in-
 volvement in international affairs is unavoid-
 able.
 But what is involvement?  Some Ameri-
 cans evidently swung so far from their isola-
 tionist past that they regard involvement
 as deciding everything for everybody, and
 particularly deciding the nature and scope
 of social revolution anywhere.
 A role in world leadership certainly is the
 American mission, but we need a more sen-
 sible view of what world leadership really is.
 The truth is that Vietnam does not present
 a simple case of external aggression, direct,
 or indirect, and a policy based on that false
 assumption is bound to fail, as ours has
 failed for 10 years.  No matter how strenu-
 ously we may justify the bombing of North
 Vietnam to ourselves, and no matter how
 well it might be defended as pure reprisal or
 revenge, the fact remains that there is no
 military solution to the problem so far as
 the United States is concerned.
 If we step up our attacks and the degree
 of our involvement, and even if we do not
 provoke Chinese or Russian intervention, all
 we can really expect is  to take  over the
 whole war from the South Vietnamese-in
 other words, to occupy and govern South
 Vietnam indefinitely.
 What would such an occupation gain for
 us?  It would not serve our true national in-
 terests, it would poison our relations with
 half the world, and it would hamper our
 freedom  of maneuver  in  more  important
 areas of conflict.
 Our Vietnam policy is at a dead end.  Our
 interests can now be served only by a polit-
 ical rather  than a military solution,                                                                                                                                        one
 that will enable us ultimately to end a profit-
 less involvement in a profitless Asian land
 war.. Unless President Johnson is seeking a
 political solution, he is not only risking nu-
 clear                                                                                                                                    war  but  basing  national  policy     on
 dangerous illusions.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX         Marc 11, 1964
 Housing for the Elderly, Quincy, Mass.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. JAMES A. BURKE
 OF MASSACHUSETTS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 Mr. BURKE. Mr. Speaker, it was my
 pleasure, on March 6,1965, to be the prin-
 cipal speaker at, the ground breaking
 ceremonies of the housing for the elderly
 in Quincy, Mass.
 A new, multistory apartment building
 for senior citizens is to be constructed
 with a $2,583,000 senior citizens housing
 loan under Public Law 88-372 from the
 Community  Facilities  Administration.
 The project is being sponsored by the
 Quincy Point Congregational Church
 through the Quincy Point Congregational
 Church Homes.     The Reverend Bedras
 Baharian is the president of the corpo-
 ration.  This is the second such loan in
 Massachusetts under Public Law 88-372
 and is to serve primarily the Quincy,
 Weymouth, and Braintree areas in Nor-
 folk County.  Under leave to extend my
 remarks, I include an article from the
 Quincy Patriot Ledger, Quincy, Mass., on
 March 8, 1965, relating to this event:
 GROUND  BROKEN FOR ELDERLY HOUSING
 QuINCY.-Ground  was  broken  Saturday
 for the 216-apartment building for the el-
 derly which will be built at 100 Southern
 Artery by the Quincy Point Congregational
 Church Homes Co., a nonprofit corporation.
 READY NEXT YEAR
 Tenants in the new building, which will be
 ready for occupancy by April 1, 1966, will be
 from the middle-lower income group with
 weekly pay of less than $100.  Guest speaker
 Congressman JAMES A. BURKE, Democrat, of
 Milton, said that this group comprises 16
 percent of Quincy's population.  Residents
 from Weymouth and Braintree also will live
 in the new apartments.
 Congressman Buexa noted that the build-
 ing will be the largest direct-loan housing
 for elderly in the State.  He added that spe-
 cial technology will be used to make  the
 apartment  suited to the  elderly,  such as
 omitting steep stairways, narrow halls and
 polished floors.
 Apartment trustees were called builders
 with real roots in the business and commu-
 nity service units by Mr. BURKE.                    He also
 credited the Quincy Development Commis-
 sion and the Patriot Ledger with encourage-
 ment in the project.
 Other  speakers  at  the  groundbreaking
 were Quincy City Councilor President Joseph
 LaRaia; Robert Fitzgerald, who represented
 his cousin, Senator EDwARD  M.  KENNEDY;
 and  William A.  O'Connell, executive vice
 president of the Quincy-South Shore Cham-
 ber of Commerce.                Senator LEVERETT SALTON-
 STALL.sent greetings by wire.
 Mry Carl E,'Magnuson, who applied for the
 first apartment 2 years ago, turned the first
 sod at the ceremonies.  Taking part in the
 ceremonies were the Reverend Bedros Ba-
 harain, pastor of the Quincy Point Congre-
 gational Church; Herbert Hendry, treasurer;
 Everett Besse, clerk; and the Reverend Elden
 Zuern, associate pastor. The invocation was
 given by the Reverend John D. Banks, pastor
 of Bethany Congregational Church; and the
 Reverend Albert J. Penner of the Massachu-
 setts Congregational Society gave the bene-
 diction.
 Among the 150 guests at the groundbreak-
 ing ceremonies were city councilors and rep-
 resentatives of local civic groups, as well as
 State representatives.
 Work on the apartment project is expected
 to  begin  this  month  by  the  Tornabene
 Bros., of Newton, who bid $2,162,800.  The
 total cost of the project, including land,
 will be $2,583,000.
 My remarks at the ceremony follow:
 Mr. Chairman, reverend clergy, ladies and
 gentlemen, it is a genuine pleasure to par-
 ticipate with you today, in these ground-
 breaking ceremonies that I know mean so
 much to you.  On this site, you are about
 to build the largest direct-loan-housing-for-
 the-elderly project in this State.  Of course,
 it Is fitting, that with large problems, there
 arise large solutions.
 The Massachusetts study of our problems,
 presented to the White House Conference on
 Aging, said, and I quote:
 "The physical nature of many modern
 American homes and apartments is such that
 they are not appropriate dwelling units for
 older persons. - There are steep and narrow
 stairways,  narrow  halls,  highly  polished
 floors, weak and flimsy bathroom accessories,
 etc.  A special technology has developed
 around the most suitable physical stand-
 ards for housing for older persons."
 The report went on to suggest that there
 was an immediate need in Massachusetts for
 8,000 to 10,000 apartments for older persons
 in the low-income group, and approximately
 the same for those in the middle-income
 brackets.
 This project we are dedicating today makes
 a dent in the need for those In the lower-
 middle income group, those in the under-
 $5,000 bracket.  I would only hope that those
 listening and watching this event will take
 a lesson and imitate the concept, if not the
 details, of what is being created here.
 There are so many fine things to point
 out in this project, that I shall only remark
 on a few that strike me as an example of
 local  wisdom  and  thoughtfulness,  in the
 preparation of this program.  For one, it is
 located right where people live, not far out
 in the country, away from the general com-
 munity.                                                                              You may be insulating your elder-
 ly, away from some of the noises, by putting
 them in one building, but they are not iso-
 lated, away from everyone else.   In that,
 you have shown foresight and understand-
 ing of their real needs.
 You have planlred an activity center that
 Can absorb many of the elderly both in the
 building and in the surrounding neighbor-
 hood as well.  I would hope that some of the
 four Golden Age Clubs that meet in this
 area will consider sharing your facilities and
 services and possibly even provide tenants.
 I would hope that some of the displacees
 from the Quarry Street  project will find
 their way here to help resume their inter-
 rupted lives in a congenial atmosphere.
 You havd organized a fine board of trus-
 tees, building from strength, with real roots
 in your business and service community.
 When I look around and see sales managers,
 engineers, accountants, manufacturers, elec-
 trical contractors, Insurance men, ministers,
 and volunteers and service leaders of every
 sort, I am reassured, since I know that the
 strength of our community is represented in
 the project leadership.
 You have powerful encouragement from
 the Quincy Development Commission and
 the Patriot Ledger to further underline the
 extent of your roots.
 You are exploring relationships with a host
 of local service agencies to help provide the
 residents  with  the personal  services  that
 they will need In their daily lives, without
 turning the project into an all-encompassing
 home for the aged.  Rather, you are directing
 social and medical services into the proj-
 ect to meet individual need, instead of man-
 aging their lives for them.
 You have chosen your ground well, since
 this particular area of Quincy has one of the
 highest percentages of elderly in the State,
 16.4 percent over 60, as of the 1960 census.
 Yet you have planned large enough to help
 serve the needs of Braintree and Weymouth,
 as well.
 In the building, your efficiencies and one-
 bedroom apartments will help to satisfy the
 need for efficient, safe, and sanitary housing,
 far better adapted to the needs of older per-
 sons.
 You have turned to the Federal Govern-
 ment for financing,  but  this is no  dole.
 Rather, the elderly residents themselves will
 be repaying the  loan over a term  of 50
 years in their rent, paying taxes and con-
 tributing to Improving their neighborhood,
 while, at the same time, helping to meet
 their own housing needs.  This, to me, is the
 ideal partnership of people in a community,
 working together toward a noble social goal,
 yet helping themselves at the same time.
 In particular, I want to commend your
 leadership, especially Rev. Bedros Baharian,
 for his inspiration, persistence, and under-
 standing, in helping to make this project a
 reality.
 When this building is finished and ready
 to open, I want you to invite me back again,
 so that I can see for myself what you have
 created .
 May Almighty God shower His blessings
 on your good works.

 OF
 HON. PETER W. RODINO, JR.
 OF NEW JERSEY
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965 ,
 Mr. RODINO.                         Mr. Speaker, the Na-
 tional Council of Churches has long been
 an advocate of immigration reform and
 in this regard the council on February
 24, 1965, adopted a resolution reiterating
 this historic concern of the churches
 and  a  reaffirmation  that  essential
 change in our   immigration policy is
 vitally important to our national well-
 being.  In order that the Members of
 this House can be kept abreast of the
 general feeling on immigration policy I
 am proud to include this resolution in
 the RECORD:
 RESOLUTION  ON  THE  CHURCHES  AND  U.S.
 IMMIGRATION  POLICY, ADOPTED FEBRUARY
 24, 1965
 Whereas insights from Christian faith and
 from the nature of a free society suggest
 that people should be afforded the opportuni-
 ties to move voluntarily for economic and
 social reasons, for reuniting their families,
 or for availing themselves and their loved
 ones of greater opportunities; to seek asylum
 from religious, social, political, and racial
 persecution;  and  to  find  sanctuary  from
 natural calamities or oppressive occupation;
 the National Council of Churches in light of
 current governmental developments deems it
 timely to reiterate this historic concern of
 the churches and reaffirm its belief that the
 United States should make essential changes
 in its immigration law which will provide the
 opportunities here listed.
 Whereas the National Council of Churches
 and  constituent  communions  have  re-
 peatedly stated that the immigration policy
 of our land raises inequitable racial and via-

 Whereas the President of the United States
 called upon the country in his state of the
 Union address on January 4, 1965, and in his
 message to the Congress on January 19, 1965,
 to consider basic revisions to the Immigra-
 tion and Nationality Act of 1952, along the
 same lines that,. the National Council of
 Churches and constituent communions have
 consistently called for: Be it therefore
 Resolved, That the general board of the
 National Council of the. Churches of Christ
 in the U.S.A.  once again call  upon the
 churches to promote study and encourage
 action which will, lead to legislation to im-
 prove the immigration statutes of the United
 States, so that their provisions will be more
 in accord with Christian and humanitarian
 principles recognizing the inherent worth
 and dignity of the individual, a concept upon
 which our country is founded and to which
 it is dedicated; and so that their provisions
 will promote the national interest of our own
 and other countries as well as the welfare
 of the individuals who may benefit by migra-
 tion; be it further
 Resolved, That the general board of the
 National Council of Churches call upon the
 constituent membership  of  the  National
 Council of Churches to note and study fur-

 HON, ROBERT E. SWEENEY
 ?OF OHIO
 IN THE   -0
 .F REPRESENTATIVES
 Thl4rsda, March 11, 1965
 Mr. SWEENEY.  Mr. Speaker, I was
 saddened today..to, learn of the passing
 of one of Cleveland's fine citizens, Frank
 X. Cull, a celebrated civil trial lawyer
 for more than 50 years, who at the age
 of 77 had achieved the highest respect
 of his colleagues and of the citizens of
 Cleveland, Ohio.
 Early in his career, Frank X. Cull
 served on the Hill as secretary to former
 U.S. Senator Robert J. Bulkley before
 returning to Cleveland to build an en-
 viable record in a profession that is care-
 ful with its accolades.
 Frank X. Cull will be sincerely missed
 by the entire membership of the Ohio
 bar, and most particularly by his pro-
 fessional associates in the firm of Haux-
 burst, Sharp, Cull & Kellogg, with whom
 he has been in practice over a long period
 of years.
 Rescuing the New Haven
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN S. MONAGAN
 OF CONNECTICUT
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 Mr. MONAGAN.  Mr, Speaker, there
 have been many arguments and formu-
 las advanced in the effort to "rescue" the
 New Haven Railroad and to safeguard
 against the inconvenience to commuters
 that would result from the proposed
 abandonment of commuter service.
 There has come to me today an edi-
 torial which appeared in the March 8
 edition of the Meriden, Conn., Morning
 Record which contains recommenda-
 tions that I find interesting and which, I
 believe, are deserving of thorough study.
 With permission to extend my re-
 marks, I include at- this point the edi-
 torisl, "Rescuing the New Haven";
 RESCUING  THE  NEW  HAVEN
 In Hartford and in Washington, hearings
 are open and arguments are being heard on
 how  to rescue  the  New Haven  Railroad.
 The bankrupt line has been losing money
 steadily under its trusteeship management;
 it has petitioned the ICC to allow a curtail-
 ment of commuter service close to New York,
 and the shape of things to come clearly indi-
 cates a gradual closing down of all passen-
 ger service unless something is done.  What
 are the alternatives, and how would they af-
 fect Connecticut and the whole area served
 by the New Haven?
 LE'r IT DIE?
 What would happen if no subsidies were
 were provided, no help were given, the rail-
 road were allowed to go on Its way downhill?
 We could expect continuation of freight
 service with gradual elimination of passen-
 ger service as equipment deteriorated and
 income continued  to fall.   Eventually we
 would be forced to see takeover by the Gov-
 ernment or sale as distressed assets to the
 highest bidder.  At worst, we could expect
 complete collapse of all service with virtual
 disintegration of stock and real estate; at
 best, minimal operation after a period of
 standstill.
 New England can't afford this solution; on
 this there is general agreement.  Our high-
 ways can't stand the load that a dying rail-
 road would shift to them, our people can't
 staad the loss (4, public transportation, our
 businesses can't stand the attrition that
 poor railroad service would force on the whole
 northeast corner of the country.  The New
 Haven has got to be rescued.
 A1127
 THE R18'ICOF7 APPROACH
 Senator ABRAHAM RIBICOFF, of Connecticut,
 has proposed a rescue operation through a
 $100 million fund to be voted by Congress.
 It would be administered by the Interstate
 Commerce Commission which could use it
 to help the New Haven and other commuter
 lines which are in difficulty.  The figure
 of $10 million has been used hopefully as
 the New Haven's. probable Federal share, to
 be matched by Connecticut and New York
 which would each put in $5 million, to make
 a $20 million rescue subsidy.
 Subsidies are necessary to keep the road
 running, and they must be provided.  But
 the Ribicoff bill by itself is not enough. We
 are against any simple subsidy that will keep
 the road running on its present inefficient
 system without moving toward a construc-
 tive permanent cure for the things that cause
 the need for subsidy-it's just prolonging the
 agony.
 We also question the appropriation of $100
 million on a nationwide basis to cure ills
 that are basically regional-again on a sim-
 ple subsidy-to-deficit pattern.  The New Hav-
 en is the sickest of several railroads in many
 parts of the country which aren't as healthy
 as they should be.  Will the subsidy encour-
 age them to sit back and wait for help, in-
 stead of seeking more constructive ways to
 compete?
 MERGER
 The New York Central and the Pennsyl-
 vania Railroads would like to merge.  Both
 moneymakers at present, they aren't eager
 to include the losing New Haven in their
 plans, but they might be interested in buy-
 ing the freight operation.  Pressure could be
 brought through Congress, the ICC, and State
 agencies for an inclusion either of the New
 Haven freight operation or the whole rail-
 road.
 In effect, this would be a forced marriage;
 if it were carried out, the New Haven, and
 especially its passenger service, shouldn't ex-
 pect to get favored treatment in the new
 combine.  For a while, the big merged line
 would absorb the losses on the New Haven
 passenger runs.  But considering the prob-
 lem, it could hardly be expected to sink the
 necessary massive amounts of capital on a
 permanent basis into new equipment and
 improved service;  more likely would be a
 continuation  of the  present  gradual  de-
 terioration and a renewed petitioning for
 permission to curtail passenger service.
 THE NEW YORK PLAN
 New York is going to be squeezed the most
 and the tightest by any cutback.  If com-
 muter service is phased out, the traffic prob-
 lem is going to turn New York City into a
 shambles. For this reason, Governor Rocke-
 feller came up recently with a bold new plan
 for a takeover of dying railroads, beginning
 with the Long Island Railroad, under a new
 State  metropolitan   commuter   authority
 which would undertake a $200 million mod-
 ernization program.                                                                                                                                                There would be room
 for other railroads and other States in a tri-
 state  commuter  system,  which                                                                                                                                          would  be
 eligible for Federal aid under Washington's
 urban transportation program.
 It may be a fine plan for New York and
 the LIRR. But it begins by regarding the
 railroad as a commuter line, which is only
 part of its value to Connecticut. This State
 should be careful not to join in too quickly
 to provide funds and backing to solve prob-
 lems which are essentially those of New
 York City.
 REGIONAL APPROACH
 New York has  one a 'disservice to her
 neighbors  and  the  New  Haven  by  em-
 phasizing the commuter aspects of the New
 Haven.  Not just New York and Connecti
 cut but Rhode Island and Massachusetts-
 and Maine and New Jersey, too-are con-
 cerned with the flow ' of goods and people
 which  the  New  Haven  can  and  should
 strengthen. The whole northeast corner of

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX           arch 11, 1965
 the country will be made anemic if these
 vital arteries of travel and commerce are
 allowed to disintegrate or to bypass us.
 With increasing congestion over the decades
 ahead, our loss will become geometrically
 more serious.
 The long-term solution of New Haven's
 problems, and the long-term healthof New
 England and New York, depend on the crea-
 tion of acooperative agency or authority in-
 cluding at least the four States served by the
 New  Haven.  It  should  be  a  suprastate
 agency, quasi-public in nature, empowered
 to own and operate the railroad and to sell
 bonds to the public to finance the purchase
 and improvements, these bonds to be under-
 written by Federal funds.                    The States and
 Washington should undertake to underwrite
 operating deficits on a fair formula for a
 temporary transition period only.  The Port
 Authority of New York could serve to some
 extent as a model.
 Such an authority could, as part of its
 plan, sell the freight operation, or lease
 trackage and equipment to one or another
 railroad.  It could undertake the expensive
 modernization and improvement program
 which alone will enable the railroad to com-
 pete with other methods of transportation.
 With money and Imaginative management it
 could stand a good chance of making the
 New  Haven  again  New  England's  main
 artery---and a profitable one.
 This Is the direction in which our legis-
 lators and officials In Hartford and Washing-
 ton must turn if they are to rescue the New
 Haven.  This is the package of temporary
 subsidy plus long-term planning which they
 must put together for the good of the rail-
 road and even more for the good of the
 States it serves.
 The War in Vietnam-XIII
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. THADDEUS. J. DULSKI
 OF NEW YORE
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 Mr. DULSKI.                      Mr. Speaker, Mr. Lu-
 cian C. Warren, Washington correspond-
 ent for the Courier-Express, Buffalo,
 N.Y., has been writing a report on Viet-
 nam for his newspaper.  Under unani-
 mous consent, I include part XIII of this
 series which appeared in the Courier-
 Express on March 5, 1965:
 THE WAR IN VIETNAM, XIII=STABLE GOVERN-
 MENT Is KEY TO VICTORY
 (NOTE.-Lucian  C.  Warren, Washington
 correspondent for The Courier-Express, alter
 a visit to the combat zones in South Vietnam
 gives a closeup look at the war there which
 has left him with decided convictions about
 U.S. political strategy in that far-off un-
 happy land.)
 (By Lucian C. Warren)
 SAIGON, SOUTH  VIETNAM.--It  is popular
 here and elsewhere to be critical of the way
 the war against the Vietcong Communists is
 being run.
 Hugh Campbell, for 2 years a Canadian
 delegate on the three-nation International
 Control Commission that has tried unsuc-
 cessfully to make the 1954 Vietnam parti-
 tion agreement work, is openly scornful of
 the American military effort.  In a recent
 article he even took out after the average
 serviceman's  wife  in  Saigon, saying  that
 "she takes the fur-lined mug" for "boorish-
 ness, offensiveness and condescension to-
 ward her 'inferiors,' " meaning the South
 Vietnamese.
 In Congress, rarely a day goes by that some
 Senator, such as Senator WAYNE MORSE or
 Senator  RICHARD  RUSSELL,  doesn't  grab  a
 headline by saying, "we're fighting the wrong
 war at the wrong time and had best nego-
 tiate some deal with the North Vietnamese."
 CRITICISM
 The constant barrage of criticism had re-
 minded one briefing officer here of  what
 Titus Livius  (Livy), who died in A.D. 17,
 recorded in his history of Rome volume 7.
 about a Roman consul's attitude toward his
 armchair military critics.
 According to Livy, Lucius Aemilus Paulus,
 who conducted the war against the Macedon-
 ians in 168 B.C., sarcastically commented
 that in every circle and, truly, at every table,
 there are people who lead armies into Mace-
 donia, who know where the camps ought to
 be placed, when and through what pass that
 territory should be entered, when it is proper
 to engage the enemy and when to lie quiet.
 OPPORTUNITY
 The Roman consul ended his diatribe by
 suggesting thatif anyone was well qualified
 to give advice on the Macedonia war, let him
 come to Macedonia at public expense, where
 he shall be furnished with a ship, a horse,
 a tent-even his traveling charges shall be
 defrayed.
 But, Lucius Paulus concluded, according
 to Livy, if he thinks this too much trouble,
 and prefers the repose of city life to the
 toils of war, let him not, on land, assume
 the office of a pilot.
 In other words, this was the angered put-
 up-or-shut-up attitude of a criticism-stung
 general 2,000 years ago.
 The observations: Any war that is taking
 a toll in casualities among the enemy in the
 ratio  of  nearly  3  to  1  of  the  United
 States-South Vietnamese forces is not a
 failure.  It can and should be higher if the
 right side is to win eventually, but the
 United States and its ally are learning much
 about guerrilal warfare and captured Viet-
 cong documents and prisoners show recogni-
 tion that they are up against tough ad-
 versaries.
 As to the Campbell criticism of service-
 men's wives, we share with Buffalo's Maj.
 Gen. Richard 0. Stilwell, Army Chief of Staff
 here, resentment at an unfair comment. Mrs.
 Stilwell herself until her recent departure
 worked as a Gray Lady in the local hospital
 and as a volunteer helper In an orphanage.
 DEDICATED
 "The wives of career officers, be they em-
 bassy or military, are every bit as dedicated
 and hard working as their spouses," says
 Stilwell, and I'm sure he's right.
 The war is by no means won or nearly won
 and our forces on the scene would be the first
 to admit this.  In fact, there is general
 acknowledgement that even within the last
 year the Vietcong have gained in both popu-
 lation and area under their control.
 And the ratio of the enemy's casualties to
 ours is dwindling from 4.3 to 1 In 1962, to
 3.7 to 1 in 1963, to 2.4 to 1 in 1964. Further-
 more, the enemy's weapons are becoming
 more sophisticated every day.  The day of
 handmade  weapons  among  the  Vietcong
 seems to be over, and these days the Vietcong
 are being supplied with some of the best
 Chinese and Russian military weapons avail-
 able, including 60- and 80,pound mortars and
 59-millimeter cannons.
 IMPROVING
 Meanwhile our weaponry is improving, too,
 but notwithstanding the fact that the United
 States-Vietnamese  forces  have  total  air
 superiority over the enemy, the war on the
 ground is a hard-fought, close contest.
 And the U.S. casualties, while still small,
 are rising.  Figures for a recent week's toll
 showed more than 200 U.S. killed or wounded,
 highest of any week in the war.
 The political situation in South Vietnam
 Is still unstable and the Government still
 weak.  As this was written, a new civilian
 government had been in office only a few days
 when the military started its favorite past-
 time of initiating coups.
 The U.S. Embassy and soldiers here are
 guardedly optimistic, at least to the extent
 that the new Premier, Phan Huy Quat, for-
 eigh minister in. a former government, is con-
 sidered an able man and his cabinet shows a
 good balance in representation from various
 sections of the country and ethnic and politi-
 cal shadings.
 ACCEPTABLE
 The new civilian Government has been re-
 ported  acceptable to Buddhist leader  Tri
 Quang, whose displeasure has been a major
 factor in toppling earlier governments, in-
 cluding that of President Diem.   But Tri
 Quang is unpredictable, is definitely neutral-
 ist in sentiment and thinks the United
 States should negotiate with North Vietnam.
 If--and this is a big if-at long last Pre-
 mier Quat is allowed by the military and Tri
 Quang to stay in office for a sufficient time
 to develop stability and strength, this will
 be reflected in a much stronger political front,
 against the dedicated Vietcong.
 This is the hope both of intelligent South
 Vietnamese and United States forces.  Then
 when effective military action rolls back the
 Vietcong, strong local governments can be
 formed under direction from Saigon to keep
 the acquired territory safe for democratic
 government.
 BOMBING
 Along with a strong and stable civilian
 government, U.S. bombing of North Vietnam
 must continue, whether under the pretext of
 retaliation for Vietcong attacks or in support
 of outright military goals.
 From the U.S. Ambassador down, top rank-
 ing U.S. civil and military officials bend over
 backward not to criticize past U.S. hesitancy
 on this score, but once in a while a remark
 like "it should have been started 2 years ago"
 slips out.  And all the military analyses of
 eventual victory hint broadly that continued
 bombings of North Vietnam territory are a
 patr of the recipe for triumph.
 It is unthinkable that the United States
 should pull out, nor can it be a party to
 any negotiated truce that will let the Viet-
 cong takeover as soon as U.S. forces are
 removed.  Perhaps, if the United States and
 South Vietnam get stronger in a combined
 military political way and if the toll becomes
 increasingly hard for Hanoi to bear, then it is
 possible negotiations from strength might
 produce a settlement with sufficient safe-
 guards to maintain a democratic government
 in South Vietnam.
 WATCHING
 But until that time, the war must go on.
 The world is watching to see whether the
 United States is the paper tiger the Com-
 munist  claim.                                                                                                                                                                   If  it  becomes  convinced,
 then it will be Indonesia, and Thailand, per-
 haps Malaya, to fall next.  Communist take-
 overs in Africa and Latin America would be
 encouraged.
 A defeat for the Vietcong would immensely
 simplify the problem of the free world.  Vic-
 tory is possible with stronger U.S. military
 and South Vietnamese political offensives. It
 may take 5 to 10 years, but when the stakes
 are so high, there is no substitute for vic-
 tory.

 An estimated $15,440 Worth of livestock
 was lost in the flood in the county.
 It win cost $19,260 to replace destroyed
 buildings and another $11,777 to repair the
 damaged structures.
 Machinery lost during the flood or ren-
 dered useless because of water damage totals
 $5,035.  Repairing damaged machinery will
 cost $3,953.  As of a week ago $170 has been
 spent on machinery repairs.
 To replace washed-out fences in the county,
 $47,828 is needed.  Another $28,332 is re-
 quired for repair work.                                                                     So far only $150
 has been spent on fence repairs.
 The estimated crop lose for Grant County
 totals  $235,846.  Hay  lost  is  reported  at
 $119,322.  This estimated crop loss and loss
 of aftermath grazing and permanent pas-
 ture is for 1965 only.                                                                   Hay loss was figured
 at $30 per ton and grazing loss at $4.50 per
 animal unit per month.  Nearly 4,000 tons
 of hay was lost during the flood.
 Inconvenience cost amounted to $71,499.
 This cost is associated with flood fighting,
 loss of livestock weight, housing and feed-
 ing people during the flood and general in-
 convenience associated with or because of
 the flood.  Most people would not put a
 dollar value on this type of an item for the
 report.
 Loss of supplies such as lumber, fence
 posts, spools of wire, and firewood was esti-
 mated at $27,873.
 Bunch, former assistant county agent for
 Grant County, and who has recently com-

 Oregon State University, headed the damage
 report project.  Ray Brisbois handled much
 of the home and business damage survey.
 The county agent at large made up the

 FLOOD DAMAGE REPORT FOR COUNTY Hrrs
 $6,597,426
 Damages caused by the recent floods total
 $5,597,426 for Grant County.  River and agri-
 culture repair costs and flood loss amounts to
 $4,879,547.
 Home damage in Grant County is $222,-
 372.90; business damage stands at $557,069.
 Damages represents nearly one-tenth of the
 true cash value of $60,727,124 for the county.
 The cash value of the county will be less
 for the next fiscal year due to the flood loss,
 says James Allen, county assessor. Reduced
 livestock valuation and the loss of two mills
 in Mount Vernon will lower the cash value
 of Grant County for next year.
 An  extensive  survey  compiled    by  Tom
 Bunch, county  agent   at  large,  revealed
 heaviest  damages  were inflicted  on  the
 streambanks of the John Day River and its
 tributaries.   An  estimated  $2,413,256 is
 needed for new work for the streams. So
 far, $15,365 has been spent on channel work.
 The report has been used to acquire addi-
 tional Office of Emergency Planning (OEP)
 and Agriculture Conservation Program (ACP)
 funds.
 Replacing  the  washed  out  riprap  and
 levees that were installed prior to the recent
 flood will cost $165;740.  To repair damaged
 levees and dikes, to clean debris from the
 river and to reshape the channels will cost
 at least $628,829.
 Land eroded away or damaged, by sheet
 erosion was valued at $249,1053.  To fill in the
 newly created gullys across fields will cost
 $29,048.
 Another $217,440 will be needed to clean
 up debris and to smooth out the silt and
 gravel deposits on the crop lands.
 Cost to replace, and rebuild washed-out
 private irrigation ditches is $29,894. To clean
 the ditches that are repairable will cost
 $59,888.
 Company ditches damage figure is esti-
 mated  at  $100,000  to  :replace  destroyed
 ditches and to repair damaged ditches.
 Work needed to meet the potential weed
 infestation in areas covered with  silt or
 gravel deposits or that have been scoured will
 cost $185,000. This is the latest estimate as
 many people did not report potential weed
 infestation on their land.
 Stock water damage report may be low but
 the report indicates that it will cost $1,590
 to replace ,irrigation and stock water ponds.
 To clean up and repair the ponds will cost
 $21,591.
 Damage to private roads will cost $23,471
 to repair.  Replacement cost of the washed-
 out. roads is estimated at $7,237.-
 A total of $165,099 Is necessary to replace
 private bridges in Grant County.  An addi-
 tional $63,251 is needed to repair the par-
 tially damaged bridges and to reshape cross-
 ings.  As of last week when the damage re-
 ports were filed $4,490 was already spent on
 bridge repair.  Part of this figure includes
 work done following the Christmas flood.
 The cost to replace washed-out bridges was
 calculated at $6 per square foot.
 Another Citizen Does His Duty
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. JOHN B. ANDERSON
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 ANOTHER CrrIZEN DOES His DUTY
 (By Hal Nelson)
 Almost a year ago, on August 10, 1963, Joe
 Nash's curiosity was aroused by suspicious
 actions of a man in a telephone booth on
 Seventh Street.
 The next morning, when he saw news-
 paper stories about two Indianapolis men
 arrested  on  charges  of  robbing  a  North
 Second Street phone booth, Joe realized that
 one of the suspects might have been the man
 he had seen on Seventh Street.
 Joe was in Rockford at the time on a vaca-
 tion from Mexico City where he is travel edi-
 tor                                                                                                                             of  the  English-language  Mexico  City
 News.
 It would have been easy for Joe to have
 decided that the arrest of the two men with
 $2,376  in nickels, dimes,  and quarters in
 their Indiana-licensed car was none of his
 business.  In these days of apathy and fear
 of involvement in police matters, many a
 good citizen would have taken this course.
 But Joe has a strongly developed sense of
 citizen responsibility.  Rockford remains his
 hometown, his legal residence even though
 he has worked in Mexico City for many years.
 He felt he should report what he had seen
 to police.  He made a positive identification
 of one of the suspects, gave police a state-
 ment, promised the  State attorney's staff
 that he would return to testify if needed.
 The two suspects were indicted.  A trial
 date was set.  Joe arranged to leave his job
 in Mexico City long enough to fly to Rock-
 ford to testify.  But he learned the trial had
 been delayed when he  arrived here.  An-
 other trial date was set.                                                                                                                               Before he could be
 notified, Joe had left on a 2-week trip into
 sections of Mexico where primitive commu-
 nication made it impossible to reach him.
 The case finally came to trial last week.
 Joe had extended his vacation 3 days in order
 to testify.  He told his story in circuit court
 after spending hours in the stifling witness
 room.
 Defense attorneys objected to Nash's testi-
 mony-and the judge ordered most of it
 stricken.
 The jury deliberated 6 hours;  then re-
 turned a verdict of guilty.
 Was it worthwhile, this expenditure  of
 time, effort, nerve energy on the part of a
 private citizen in a matter which did not
 personally concern him in anyway?
 We didn't ask Joe this question.  His ac-
 tions revealed his answer.
 But what about the rest of us?  Would we
 have done it?
 That's a question we all should ask our-
 selves.  It's much easier to close our eyes and
 ears and stay out of such matters.
 Yet, if we want to live in a country of law
 and order, of freedom from fear, of liberty to
 move about without restraint, it's time that
 more of us follow the course that Joe did.
 Mr.  ANDERSON  of- Illinois.  Mr.
 Speaker, I wish to call the Members' at-
 tention to an editorial which appeared
 in the Rockford Morning Star, Rockford,
 Ill., on July 26, 1964. This editorial was
 written by Hal Nelson, associate editor
 of the Rockford Morning Star, who was
 just named as the recipient of a Free-
 doms Foundation medal. _
 In recent weeks we have heard several
 reports of witnesses refusing to become
 involved in arrests because of the "in-
 conveniences" that might result for
 themselves. Thus this story of a citizen
 going out of his way to aid in the arrest
 and conviction of persons involved in a
 robbery even though it meant consider-
 able expense and personal hardship
 affords a lesson for all who consider
 themselves good citizens.

 OF MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 Mr. VIVIAN. Mr. Speaker, we have all
 been dismayed and shocked by the bar-
 baric attack upon peaceful demonstra-
 tors in Alabama on Sunday.  Sunday's
 brutality poses a threat to all Americans.
 I wish to bring to the attention of the
 Members, the comments of the editors
 of a newspaper in my district-the Ann

 Work of law that the phenomenon of immi-
 gration has to take place.  If the law is not
 flexible enough to allow the problems of im-
 migration to be faced on the human level in
 a just and compassionate way, then the law
 should be modified.
 But' immigration is not only a matter of
 law; it is far more poignantly a matter of
 people.  The most direct problems that are
 faced are neither political nor technical; but
 questions which the human and social ac-
 tuality, pose.  As Pope John said elsewhere
 inPacem in Terris:
 "The sentiment of universal fatherhood
 which the Lord has placed in our heart
 makes us feel profound sadness in consider-
 ing the phenomenon of political refugees, a
 phenomenon which has assumed large pro-
 portions and 'which always hides number-
 less acute sufferings."

 who have been uprooted, who have to be re-

 Dr. King was in Washington at week's end
 to  discuss  the  proposed                       legislation  with
 President Johnson.                            Before the meeting, the
 White House announced that the legislation
 is "still being checked out" by the Justice
 Department before the President sends it
 to Congress in a special message.
 The  legislation  is  expected  to  place  a
 moratorium on the use of literacy tests and
 provide, as a last resort, Federal registrars to
 register Negroes where local officials won't.
 Such a bill has a good chance in Congress.

 Mr. Speaker, on March 5, the Honor-

 city of New York gave an address at the
 Third Annual Intercollegiate Urban Af-
 fairs Conference at Long Island Univer-
 sity in which he discussed urban renewal
 problems in New York and other cities
 and some of the solutions required to
 meet present and future challenges.
 I include the mayor's remarks below
 so that everyone concerned with urban
 renewal may benefit from his wisdom
 and insight into the subject:
 REMARKS BY  MAYOR  ROBERT  F.  WAGNER AT
 LONG  ISLAND     UNIVERSITY-THIRD  ANNUAL
 INTERCOLLEGIATE URBAN AFFAIRS CONFERENCE
 Not so long ago cities were considered the
 proudest product of civilization. They were,
 in fact, its birthplace. In ancient times,
 Babylon,  Alexandria,  Jerusalem,  Athens,
 Rome, and in later times, Constantinople,
 Paris, London, Budapest,  Warsaw, and fi-
 nally, San Francisco and New York were
 jewels in the crown of civilization.
 A hundred years ago, the American theo-
 logian, Theodore Parker, wrote: "Cities have
 always been fireplaces of civilization, whence
 light and heat radiated out into the dark,
 cold world."
 James Guthrie, the Scottish theologian,
 wrote: "I bless God for cities.  They have
 been His lamps of life along the pathways of
 humanity and religion.  Within them science
 has given birth to her noblest discoveries.
 Behind their walls freedom has fought her
 noblest battles.  They have stood on the sur-
 face of the earth like great breakwaters roll-
 ing back or turning aside the swelling tide
 of oppression.    Cities, indeed, have been the
 cradles of human liberty."

 problems today.  This is not only a nation-
 wide, but also a worldwide, phenomenon.
 Within the past 20 years millions of people
 have streamed into the cities from the coun-
 tryside and villages.  In the Western coun-
 tries, hundreds of thousands of pebple have
 simultaneously moved out of the cities into
 the suburbs.  The people moving into the
 cities have been, for the most part, the poor
 and the largely dispossessed.  Those moving
 out of the cities have been the emerging and
 the emergent middle class.
 This phenomenon has occurred and is oc-
 curring on every continent, in every latitude.
 As a matter of fact, it has been proceeding at
 a greater rate in Japan and the Soviet Union,
 for instance, than anywhere in Western Eu-
 rope or North America.
 In the first 50 years of this century, the
 total population living  in Asian cities of

 to 105.6 million, a gain of 444 percent.    In
 Africa,  the  population living in  cities  of
 100,000 or more increased from 1.1 million to
 10.2 million, a gain of 827 percent.
 Only 50 years ago, in the United States,
 S0 percent of the people lived in cities.  To-
 day that figure is creeping toward 80 percent.
 By 1980, only 15 years from now, it is reliably
 estimated that 90 percent of all the inhabit-
 ants of the United States will be living in
 urban areas.
 Turning again to the worldwide urbanized
 picture, the projection is that during the
 1960's, 200 million people will move into the
 cities of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  The
 rate of urban growth in Asia today is 400 per-
 cent higher than in the West, and the move-
 ment to the cities there is only beginning.
 What do all these figures mean for us in
 the United States, and especially for us here
 in New York City?
 They mean that the United States has

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN B. ANDERSON
 OF u,zxwoTS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 Mr.  ANDERSON  of  Illinois.  Mr.
 Speaker, in November 1963, the city of
 Rockford, Ill., held a communitywide
 Thanksgiving program.  To see a large
 city and its residents joined in a public
 display of thanksgiving was indeed an
 inspiration for all who participated and
 observed the program.
 Mr. John W. Grimes, then editor of
 the Rocktorcl Morning Star newspaper,
 now retired, wrote the narrative for a
 dramatic and musical production entitled
 "Our Heritage," which set the tone for
 the program. Over 500 persons were In-
 volved in this single production.
 Mr. Grimes' narrative has just been
 awarded a 1964 Freedoms Foundation
 Medal. Therefore, it is ' indeed a privi-
 lege, Mr., Speaker, to ask the Members
 to read and contemplate this moving
 review of our history and the promise
 it holds for our future.
 The narrative follows:
 Qua IimnVAO5
 In the bone-chilling cold of a winter dawn,
 a little ship stood at anchor off the New Eng-
 land coast, Its patched sails drooped in their
 rigging like the wings of a tired bird. It was
 not a pretty ship nor a romantic ship as it
 rode into the slow swell of the ocean, utterly
 weary from the long voyage.
 It was not a ship of discovery nor a ship of
 conquest.  No flags or pennons greeted the
 sunrise.  It was solitary in these uncharted
 waters. Behind it were leagues of wintry sea;
 before it lay a cold and unknown land.
 But had you been able to listen, you would
 have heard from the cramped and dingy
 space below decks the plaintive tune of a
 thanksgiving hymn.  And you would have
 heard a prayer of thankfulness uttered over
 a table, sparsely laid with food: "For these
 mercies, Lord, we thank Thee."
 Though weathered by the long and danger-
 ous voyage, its sails discolored by salt and
 storm, its rigging raveled, the Mayflower was
 a beautiful ship that morning, glorified by
 those prayers of thanksgiving that, rose from
 And the Mayflower became A beautiful ship
 in our national story, white of wing, and fleet
 on the water, a symbol of people voyaging to
 a new land, a free land, a fair land, and rais-
 ing their voices to God for His mercies and
 bounties,
 Countless Mayflowers have made their voy-
 ages to America's shores and anchored in
 myriad ports. Across the centuries, countless
 pilgrims, seeking freedom and opportunity
 and the_ right to worship according to con-
 science, have seen-, breaking day reveal a new
 land-this beautiful America. And countless
 hearts have raised prayers of thanksgiving for
 Approved For Release 2003/10/10 : CIA-RDP67BOO446R000300160024-6
 Whether the date of its sailing from an old
 world be remote or recent, a Mayflower, a Pil-
 grim ship, a ship with its bow set toward
 freedom, is in the heritage of each of us.
 So we are all joined together in a congrega-
 tion of thanksgiving, a thankful and devout
 nation, remembering alike the mercies of
 God and the sacred place our forefathers
 gave to the worship of God.
 Speaking of his nation, in Bible times, the
 Psalmist wrote, "God is in the midst of her;
 she shall not be moved."
 From America's. earliest history, God has
 been in our midst. Our greatest leaders have
 prayed to Him for guidance.  General Wash-
 ington, in the snow at Valley Forge; prayed
 in anguish when the fortunes of a new re-
 public were at ebb.  Lincoln, in the long
 night vigils, prayed when he awaited dis-
 patches from the battlefields.  As a Nation,
 in the torture of Pearl Harbor, we prayed.
 In our charters of Government, in our
 State papers, in the proclamations of our
 statesmen, we recognize the presence of God
 in our nationhood.
 Each November, we set aside a day of
 Thanksgiving.  There is no conflict here be-
 tween church and State.  By common con-
 sent, our Nation offers its thanks to God for
 His Goodness.  As a Nation, we "enter into
 His gates with thanksgiving and into His
 courts with praise."  Thanksgiving Day is
 an observance not of victories, not of proud
 events in our history, but of that sacred tie
 to God's providence which has been part of
 our national life from the beginning of our
 history.
 "God is in the midst of us," in our
 churches, our cathedrals, our temples; God
 is in the midst of us in our striving to make
 ours a better land.
 Our country won its political freedom in a
 long and cruel war, the American Revolution.
 Fifes shrilled and drums beat as the con-
 tinentals, in nondescript garb, assembled to
 learn the rudiments of military skill to give
 battle for liberty.  But hunger, anguishing
 cold,  division,  frustration, even treachery,
 marked the course of these long years of war.
 Human  fortitude        needed  the  sustaining
 power of God's hand; human sorrow needed
 His comfort. Men prayed, and it was as if
 their words addressed to God became the
 building blocks of a great temple memorializ-
 ing our faith in God.
 It was not poetic fancy that had inscribed
 on the Liberty 'Bell a verse from the Bible,
 "Proclaim Liberty."  That verse from Le-
 viticus was in the deep music of the bell as
 it spoke in courageous challenge when the
 Declaration of Independence was signed, and
 spoke again in solemn triumph after the sur
 render of Cornwallis at Yorktown.
 The sacrifices and suffering of that war had
 deepened America's faith in God, and at a
 divinely  propitious  time.  The  statesmen
 of a young Nation were meeting in conven-
 tion                                                                    to  give  constitutional  form to       the
 kind of government we should have.      And
 the pioneers were   already  on the march
 across the mountains to lay claim to the
 fair land that was now our heritage and our
 responsibility.
 Our deepened faith made us a God-fearing
 country.  That faith worked in the conven-
 tion to give us a constitution that made our
 government of the people, by the people, for
 the  people. It  worked  in  the  westward
 march of a young Nation to make our goal
 more than the appeasing of hunger for land
 and wealth; to make our goal the creation
 of an American civilization.
 In the halls where our charters of govern-
 ment were written, in the little wagon trains
 crossing the eastern mountains, we learned
 that freedom under God has responsibilities.
 Because  we  were  a  God-fearing  people,
 neither the oligarch in government nor the
 marauder on the frontier took command of
 A1141
 our fortunes. "-Our land, our' future, our
 destiny lay before us to be trusted wisely or
 to be wasted.  We learned restraint, and
 we learned that true democracy of working
 together.
 The  pioneers  who  marched  westward
 sought farms and homes and shops. They
 brought their skills, their inventions, their
 diligence.   Their homespun  goal was  an
 orderly and productive life. Their dream
 was a culture available to all men. They
 built schools and academies for their chil-
 dren and laid deep and lasting foundations
 for education.  Scholarship flowed westward
 in  an  increasing  stream.  Libraries and
 lyceums flourished. And colleges to which
 unsung and dedicated scholars gave their
 lives sprang up in such numbers that no
 ambitious youth was more than a day's
 horseback ride from academic groves.
 But always, there were churches, rude and
 humble in their beginnings, but rising in
 a thousand spires as men paid their tithe to
 God.  They were the symbols of God in the
 midst of us.
 But there grew up a great division among
 the States.  Debate became more angry.  A
 solution in debate failed and our Nation was
 involved in civil war.
 Our very nationhood was put to the test.
 There were prayerful men and God-fearing
 men on each side of the battle line.    We
 look back on that cruel war from the van-
 tage point of a hundred years, and we have
 occasion to give thanks that the wounds
 were bound up.  Because there were God-
 fearing men on both sides, we were spared
 the horror of a war without conscience.  Out
 of the.crucible of civil war, war between
 brothers, came the word of Lincoln's Second
 Inaugural address: "With firmness in the
 right as God gives us to see the right."
 Those  words  carried  us  through       the
 chaotic Reconstruction days. God was still
 in the midst of us, giving vision to those
 who  sought His guidance.  What Lincoln
 gave us in those words was a new theme of
 social  righteousness.  Not social  justice,
 which smacks of legalism, nor a social gos-
 pel which seeks to impose its dictate, but
 social righteousness which wells up in the
 God-fearing individual when he seeks God's
 guidance and fits his life to that inner chart.
 Lincohi's words are with us today as we
 face new problems which cannot be solved
 by compulsion or in anger, but as we are
 firm in the right as God gives us to see the
 right.
 The Prophet Micah said that God's re-
 quirements were these: that we deal justly,
 love mercy, and walk humbly with our God.
 Our great thanksgiving in this year and
 hour must be for that precious heritage of a
 God-fearing land.  And our great avowal
 must be that we continue as a God-fearing
 people.
 We are all voyagers, pilgrims, explorers,
 looking to the future.  As the mists rise, we
 see revealed the shores of a great land.  The
 once bleak coast now rises in towers.     In-
 land, a fair country stretches away rich with
 churches, homes, farmsteads, schools, indus-
 trial plants, railroads, and highways.                                                                                                                                             There
 are  myriad  cities  with  parks  and   play-
 grounds-and great halls of culture and the
 arts.
 This is our land;     the land God-fearing
 people built by keeping their faces turned
 toward the light.  This is the heritage cour-
 age and toil and prayer and self-discipline
 have given us.
 Our prayer of thanksgiving should be
 joined to a prayer of new dedication.  Our
 heritage shall not be lost.  This faith that
 God will stand in the midst of us, as we meet
 new problems, shall not be abandoned.
 God guided us as a nation toward ideals
 of education and culture and for that con-
 cord of high purpose which alone can make
 us act as good citizens for the common good.

 NSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 11, 1965
 Mr. RYAN.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to
 bring to the attention of my colleagues
 an article an the recently published State
 Department white paper on Vietnam.
 The following article appeared in the
 I. F. Stone's Weekly for March 9, 1965:
 [From I. F. Stone's Weekly, Mar. 9, 1965]
 A REPLY TO THE WHITE PAPER
 That North Vietnam supports the guerril-
 las in South Vietnam is no more a secret
 than that the United States supports the
 South Vietnamese Government against them.
 The striking thing about the State Depart-
 ment's new white paper is how little support
 it can prove.  "Incontrovertible evidence of
 Hanoi's elaborate program to supply its forces
 in the south with weapons, ammunition, and
 other supplies," the white paper says, "has
 accumulated    over the  years."   A detailed
 presentation of this evidence is in appendix
 D; unfortunately few will see the appendixes
 since even the New York Times did not re-
 print them, though these are more revealing
 than the report.  Appendix D provides a list
 of weapons, ammunition, and other supplies
 of Chinese Communist, Soviet, Czechaslovak,
 and North Vietnamese manufacture, with the
 dates and place of capture from the Vietcong
 guerrillas, over the 18-month period from
 June 1962 to January 29 last year when it
 was presented to the International Control,
 Commission.  The Commission was set up by
 the Geneva agreement of 1954.  This list pro-
 vides a good point at which to begin an anal-
 ysis of the white paper.
 THE PENTAGON FIGURES
 To put the figures in perspective, we called
 the Pentagon press -office and obtained some
 figures the white paper does not supply-
 the number of weapons captured from the
 guerrillas and the number lost to them in
 recent years:
 Captured from
 guerrillas   Lost to them
 Year
 1962 ----------
 4,800
 5,200
 Year
 1963 ----------
 5,400
 8,500
 Year
 1964 ----------
 4,900
 13, 700
 3-year total-- 15, 100
 27, 400
 In 3 years, the guerrillas captured from
 our side 12,300 more weapons than they lost
 to us.              -
 What Interests us at the moment is not
 this favorable balance but the number of
 guerrilla weapons our side captured during
 the past 3 years.  The grand total was 15,100.
 If Hanoi has indeed engaged in an "elaborate
 program" to supply the Vietcong, one would
 expect a substantial number of enemy-pro-
 duced weapons to turn up. Here is the sum
 total of enemy-produced weapons and sup-
 plies In that 18-month tally to the Control
 Commission: 72 rifles (46 Soviet, 26 Czech);
 64 submachineguns  (40 Czech, 24 French
 but "modified" in North Vietnam); 15 car-
 bins (Soviet); 8 machineguns (6 Chinese.
 2 North Vietnamese); 5 pistols (4 Soviet, 1
 Czech); 4 mortars (Chinese); 3 recoilless 75-
 millimeter rifles (Chinese) ; 3 recoilless 57-
 millimeter guns (Chinese) ; 2 bazookas (1
 Chinese, 1 Czech) ; 2 rocket launchers (Chi-
 nese); and 1 grenade launcher (Czech) for a
 total of 179.      -
 This is not a very impressive total. Accord-
 ing to the Pentagon figures, we captured on
 the average 7,500 weapons each 18 months in
 the past 3 years.  If only 179 Communist-
 made weapons turned up in 18 months, that
 Is less than 21/2 percent of the total.  Judg-
 ing by these white paper figures, our military
 are wrong in estimating, as they have in
 recent months, that 80 percent of the weap-
 ons used by the guerrillas are captured from
 us.  It looks as if the proportion is consid-
 erably higher.  The material of North Viet-
 namese origin included only those 24 French
 submachineguns "modified" in North Viet-
 nam, 2 machineguns made in North Vietnam,
 16 helmets, a uniform, and an undisclosed
 number of mess kits, belts, sweaters, and
 socks.  Judging by this tally, the main re-
 taliatory blow should be at North Vietnam's
 clothing factories.
 NOT ENOUGH FOR A BATTALION
 There Is another way to judge this tally
 of captured Communist weapons.  A Com-
 munist battalion has about 450 men.   It
 needs 500 rifles, four 80-millimeter mortars,
 eight 60-millimeter mortars, and at least 4 re-
 coilless rifles.  The weapons of Communist
 origin  captured in  18 months would not
 adequately outfit one battalion.  The figures
 In the appendix on ammunition captured
 provides another index.   We captured 183
 (Chinese) shells for a 60-millimeter mortar.
 This fires about 20 shells a minute, so that
 was hardly enough ammunition for 10 min-
 utes of firing.                                                                    There were 100,000 (Chinese)
 cartridges for 7.26-millimeter machineguns.
 That looks impressive until one discovers
 on  checking  with  knowledgeable military
 sources that  these machineguns  fire  600
 rounds a minute.    A machinegun platoon
 normally has four machineguns.   This was
 enough ammunition for about 40 minutes of
 firing by one platoon.  Indeed, if the ratio
 of Communist-made weapons captured is
 the same for weapons used, then only 121/z
 days of those 18 months were fought by the
 guerrillas on the basis of Communist-made
 supplies.
 If these figures were being presented in a
 court of law, they would run up against
 a further difficulty: one would have to prove
 the arms actually came from the Communist
 side.  There is a worldwide market in sec-
 ond-hand weapons.  One can buy Soviet,
 Czech, and Chinese Communist weapons of
 all kinds only 2 miles or so from the Penta-
 gon at Interarmco, Ltd., 7 Prince Street, Alex-
 andria, Va.  Interarmco, one of the world's
 foremost dealers, can provide more Commu-
 nist  weapons  than  we  picked  up  in  18
 months on Vietnamese battlefields. Inter-
 armco's East European Communist weapons
 come in large part from the huge stocks of
 Soviet and Czech arms captured by the Is-
 raelis in the Suez campaign.   It has Chinese
 Communist weapons captured by our side in
 the Korean War.  It also has, of course, a
 wide selection of our own military' surplus.
 This has turned up in strange places.
 For example, a book on the Algerian war,
 "Les  Algeriens  en  guerre,"  by  Dominique
 Darbois and Phillippe Vingneau, was pub-
 lished in Milan in 1960 by Feltrinelli.                                                                          It
 shows pictures of FLN (National Liberation
 Front) Algerian rebels wearing U.S. Marine
 Corps uniforms from which the "USM" and
 the eagle and globe insignia have not even
 been removed.  It shows Algerians carrying
 U.S. 80-millimeter mortars and U.S. .50-cali-
 ber machineguns.  Such photos could have
 been used by France to accuse the United
 States of supplying the Algerian rebels.
 The State Department's white paper says
 "dramatic new proof was exposed just as this
 report was being completed" in the discov-
 ery of a suspected Vietcong arms cargo ship
 on February 16.  The New York Times com-
 mented astringently on this in an editorial
 February 28:
 "Apparently, the major new evidence of a
 need for escalating the war, with all the
 hazard that this entails, was provided by the
 sinking in a South Vietnamese cove earlier
 this month of a 100-ton cargo ship loaded
 with Communist-made small arms and am-
 munition.  A ship of that size is not much
 above the oriental junk class.  The standard
 Liberty or Victory ship of World War II had
 a capacity of 7,150 to 7,650 tons."
 The affair of the cargoship is curious.  Un-
 til now there has been little evidence of
 arms coming in by ship.  A huge fleet of
 small vessels patrols the coast and there have
 been glowing stories in the past of its effi-
 ciency.  "About 12,000 vessels," the AP re-
 ported from Saigon (New York Times, Feb.
 22) "are searched each month by the South
 Vietnamese coastal junk patrol force but
 arrests are rare and no significant amounts
 of incriminating goods or weapons ever have
 been found."  This lone case of a whole ship-
 load of arms is puzzling.
 NEW NORTHERN INFILTREES CITED
 The white paper's story on the influx of
 men from the north also deserves a closer
 analysis than the newspapers have given it.
 Appendix C provides an elaborate table from
 1959-60 to 1964 inclusive, showing the num-
 ber of "confirmed military infiltrees per year
 from the north.  The total Is given as 19,550.
 One way to measure this number is against
 that of the military we have assigned to
 South Vietnam in the same years.  These
 now total 23,500, or 25 percent more, and
 1,000 are to be added in the near future.
 The number of North Vietnamese infiltrees
 is "based on information * * " from at least
 two independent sources."  Nowhere are we
 told how many men who infiltrated from the
 North have actually been captured.  There
 is reason to wonder whether the count of in-
 filtrees may be as bloated as the count of
 Vietcong dead; in both cases the numbers
 used are estimates rather than actual bodies.
 The white paper calls the war an Invasion
 and claims "that as many as 75 percent of
 the more than 4,400 Vietcong who are known
 to have entered the South in the first 8
 months of 1964 were natives of North Viet-
 nam.  But a careful reading of the text and
 the appendixes turns up the names of only
 six North Vietnamese infiltrees.  In part I
 of the white paper, section B gives "individ-
 ual case histories of North Vietnamese sol-
 diers sent south by Hanoi but all nine of
 these are of South Vietnamese origin.  The
 next section, C, is headed "Infiltration of
 Native North Vietnamese."  It names five In-
 filtrees but one of these is also from the
 south.  That leaves four North Vietnamese
 natives. Then, in appendix C, we are given
 the case histories and photographs of nine
 other Vietcong sent south by Hanoi.  The
 report does not explain which ones were orig-
 inally from the South but it does give the
 names of Provinces in which they were born.
 When these are checked, it turns out that.
 only two of the nine were born in North
 Vietnam.  This  gives  us  a  total  of  six
 northern infiltrees.  It is strange that after
 5 years of fighting, the white paper can cite
 so few.
 None of this Is dicussed frankly in the
 white paper.  To do so would be to bring
 the war into focus as a rebellion in the South,
 which may owe some men and materiel to
 the North but is largely dependent on popu-
 lar indigenous support for its manpower, as
 it is on captured U.S. weapons for its supply.
 The  white  paper  withholds  all  evidence
 which points to a civil war.  It also fails to
 tell the full story of the July 1962 special
 report by the International Control Commis-
 sion.                                                                                                                              Appendix A quotes that portion in
