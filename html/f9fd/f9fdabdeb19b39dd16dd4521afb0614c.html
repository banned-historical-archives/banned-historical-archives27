 SINAI AGREEMENT, ASSERTED ON MONDAY THAT SYRIA MOULD NOT ENGAGE IN
 .ANY FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS FOR A GOLAN HEIGHTS ACCORD UNLESS CONCURRENT
 NEGOTIATIONS ON THE PALESTINIAN QUESTION ARE HELD WITH THE
 PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION-Y
 THIS APPEARS TO REPRESENT A SERIOUS CHANGE IN SYRIA'S NEGOTIATIN
 POSITION AND ALL BUT RULES OUT ANY CHANCE OF THE US GETTING TALKS
 GOING SOON BETWEEN SYRIA AND ISRAEL?M
 SYRIAN PROPAGANDA ATTACKS ON THE SINAI ACCORD OVER     PAST
 WEEK HAVE BEEN LEADING TOWARD THIS SHIFT. SOME MIDDLE-LEVEL SYRIAN
 OFFICIALS RECENTLY INDICATED IN PRIVATE THAT SYRIA WAS NO LONGER IN
 ANY HURRY TO RECOVER A FEW MORE KILOMETERS ON THE HEIGHTS AND NEEDS
 SOMETHING FOR THE PALESTINIA!JS AS,',JELL BEFORE AN AGREEMENT WITH
 ISRAEL CAN BE POLITICALLY ACCEPTABLE?Y
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME, HOWEVER' THAT ASAD HAS INSISTED IN
 ?PUBLIC ON  A  DIRECT LINKAGE BETWEEN SYRIAN-ISRAELI NEGOTIATIONS AND
 THE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM- IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT TRIGGERED ASAD'S

 ABOUT-FACE. HE MAY HAVE CONCLUDED FROM FOREIGN MINISTER KHADDAM'S
 TALKS WITH SECRETARY KISSINGER LAST WEEK IN NEW YORK THAT THERE IS
 NO HOPE OF RAPID PROGRESS IN NEGOTIATIONS. ASAD MAY, THEREFORE,
 BELIEVE HE CANNOT AFFORD TO SETTLE FOR WHAT THE ISRAELIS WERE WILLING
 TO OFFER WITHOUT SUFFERING ACUTE PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENT AND STRONG
 ATTACKS FROM THE IRAQIS AND HIS DOMESTIC OPPONENTS?Y
 IT IS NOT CERTAIN WHAT POSITION DAMASCUS WILL NOW TAKE TOWARD
 THE RENEWAL OF THE MANDATE OF THE UN FORCES ON THE GOLAN HEIGHTS'
 WHICH EXPIRES ON NOVEMBER 30. ASAD MAY STILL FIND SOME WAY OF
 RATIONALIZING AN EXTENSION OF THIS MANDATE IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE US
 MORE TIME TO DEAL WITH THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE. IN THE MEANTIME,
 SYRIA IS LIKELY T4 REDOUBLE ITS EFFORTS TO OBTAIN THE SUPPORT OF
 OTHER ARABS FOR ITS NEGOTIATING POSITION.

 WHEN THE COMMUNIST PARTY ENDED THE-BACKING IT HAD OSTENSIBLY BEEN

 AZEVEDO AND HIS SOCIALIST-DOMINATED GOVERNMENT, THE COMMUNISTS
 APPARENTLY ARE SEEKING TO SHORE UP THEIR RELATIONS WITH LEFT-WING
 EXTREMISTS WHO ARE-LEADING THE CHALLENGE TO AZEVEDO. THE COMMUNISTS
 AND EXTREME LEFTISTS HAVE WORKED TOGETHER OCCASIONALLY, BUT THE
 LEFTIST FRINGE GROUPS.HAVE MORE OFTEN BEEN SHARPLY CRITICAL OF THE
 COMMUNIST PARTY.Y
 THE COMMUNISTS TOOK A NEUTRAL STAND WHEN THE MILITARY OCCUPIED
 RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS LAST WEEK. THEY WERE REPORTEDLY IR'fING
 ,TO AVOID BREAKING WITH THE NEWLY FORMED AZEVEDO GOVERNMENT. THE
 COMMUNISTS! ACTION ON MONDAY COULD FORESHADOW A DECISION TO WITHDRAW
 FROM THE GOVERNMENT.Y

 ROMANIAN JOINED TOLSTIKOV IN DEPARTING WHEN FIRST DEPUTY
 PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING SAID, "THE MOST DANGEROUS SOURCE OF
 WAR IS THE SUPERPOWER THAT IS MOST ZEALOUS IN PREACHING PEACE."
 THE LAST SOVIET PROTEST OF THIS KIND IN PEKING TOOK PLACE IN 1172.
 THE WALKOUT YESTERDAY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE TENG'S ANTI-SOVIET
 STATEMENT DID NOT GO BEYOND THE LANGUAGE HE HAD USED AT THE RECENT
 RECEPTION FOR NORTH VIETNAMESE PARTY CHIEF LE DUAN; TOLSTIKOV DID
 NOT LEAVE ON THAT OCCASION?Y

 FLAUNTING THEIR TIES WITH PEKING. EARLIER REPORTS FROM BELGRADEI4JAD

 OTHERS WHO CLING TO THE DEFENSE OF PRESIDENT PERON'S AUTH OITY?Y
 CALABRO, ALSO AN IMPORTANT LABOR LEADER WHO HAS FOR SOME TIME
 BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH THE OPPONENTS OF PERON'S RULE, LASHED OUT AT
 VIRTUALLY EVERY ASPECT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PERFORMANCE IN RECENT
 MONTHS.  THE PRESIDENT, HE DECLARED, HAS LOST ALL POWER BECAUSE OF
 HER SUCCESSIVE POLITICAL DEFEATS.  THE CRISIS IN THE ECONOMY
 CONTINUES, HE WENT ON, BECAUSE "NO PROPER MEASURES HAVE BEEN
 INTRODUCED."  HE FOUND FAULT WITH ACTING PRESIDENT LUDER AS WELL,
 SAYING THAT THE POLITICAL STABILITY THE COUNTRY NEEDS CANNOT BE
 SUPPLIED BY "INTERIM PRESIDENTS." "UNLESS RAPID SOLUTIONS ARE FOUND,"
 HE SAID,   "THE GOVERNMENT WILL FALL." t1

 GROWING DEBATE OVER HER FUTURE  TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE PRESIDENT
 AND HER SUPPORTERS.  HER RETURN TO BUENOS AIRES IS SCHEDULED FOR
 OCTOBER 1?. Y
 BY GOING PUBLIC WITH HIS CRITICISM, CALABRO WENT A LONG WAY

 PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRATIONS ASIDE, MIGUEL AND HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE
 PROBABLY INTERPRETED CALABRO'S OPEN BREAK AS SIGNALLING HIS INTENTION
 TO WREST FROM THEM CONTROL OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT.  THEY HAVE GOOD
 REASON TO BE CONCERNED. THE BUENOS AIRES GOVERNOR'S INFLUENCE IS
 GROWING, AT A TIME WHEN MIGUEL"S PRESTIGE AMONG LABOR HAS BEEN    25X1

 AMBASSADOR TOLSTIKOV LED A WALKOUT AT THE OFFICIAL RECEPTIuM.Y
 ALL AMBASSADORS FROM THE USSR'S EAST EUROPEAN ALLIES EXCEL'  THE
 ROMANIAN JOINED TOLSTIKOV IN DEPARTING WHEN FIRST DEPUTY
 PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING SAID, "THE MOST DANGEROUS SOURCE OF
 WAR IS THE SUPERPOWER THAT IS MOST ZEALOUS IN PREACHING PEACE."
 THE LAST SOVIET PROTEST OF THIS KIND IN PEKING TOOK PLACE IN 1972.
 THE WALKOUT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE TENG'S ANTI-SOVIET
 STATEMENT DID NOT GO BEYOND THE-LANGUAGE HE HAD USED AT THE RECENT
 RECEPTION FOR NORTH VIETNAMESE PARTY CHIEF LE DUAN; TOLSTIKOV DID
 NOT LEAVE ON THAT OCCASION.'
 THE SOVIET ACTION PROBABLY WAS INTENDED AS A DEMONSTRATION' OF
 UNHAPPINESS WITH THE YUGOSLAVS AND THE ROMANIANS, WHO ALSO HAVE BEEN
 FLAUNTING THEIR TIES WITH PEKING. EARLIER REPORTS FROM BELGRADE HAD
 SUGGESTED THAT THE SOVIETS ARE LESS THAN HAPPY WITH THE BIJEDIC 1TRIP,
