 ARAB-ISRAELI                  ISSUE
 USSR PRAISES TIES WITH SYRIA. SHOWS CONCERN OVER CAIRO SHIFT
 For want of more effective props to support its diplomatic posture
 in the Middle East, Moscow has continued to make the most of
 Syrian President al-Asad's recent visit to the USSR, presenting it
 as a symbol of Soviet-Arab friendship'and a token of Moscow's claim
 to play a role in a Middle Eastern peace settlemer:.  At the same
 time, Moscow has shown concern over the shift in Cairo's sympathies
 from a pro-Soviet to a pro-United States position.  While it has
 rejected charges that its support for Syria is serving to perpetuate
 the fighting on the Golan Heights, it has warned the Arabs against
 turning to the West for military and diplomatic support, and assured
 them that the USSR offers "comprehensive support, including arms."
 SYRIAN-ISRAELI     Routine comment on the Syrian-Israel issue has
 DISENGAGEMENT      kept up the criticism of "partial agreements"
 voiced by Brezhnev on the 11th in his speech at
 a dinner for al-Asada  Thus ZA RUBEZHOM, in an article reported by
 TASS on the 19th, cautioned against attempts being made, "under the
 guise of a search for a solution, to perpetuate the injustices
 engendered by Israel's aggressive policy."  Moscow brushed off
 Western press assertions that the Soviet-Syrian talks constituted
 an obstacle to Secretary Kissinger's peace efforts.  A broadcast
 to North America on the 19th insisted that the Soviet Union is not
 obstructing Syrian-Israeli disengagement, but that it does support
 Syria's position that troop separation must be part of an overall
 settlement.
 Ponomarev, touching briefly on the Arab-Israeli problem in his
 Lenin anniversary speech on the 22d, pledged that the USSR would do
 everything necessary to defend the Arab countries' legitimate in-
 terests, to make its contribution .to the liquidation of the crisis,
 and "not to permit a 'settlement"' that would encourage the "aggressors."
 A Middle East statement issued by the Warsaw Pact Political Consultative
 Committee on the 19th* declared that disengagement, a "first pre-
 liminary step" toward a general settlement,"must be followed without
 fail" by other steps aimed at implementation of Security Council
 resolutions 242 and 338.  The statement noted the "significance"
 *  The last such Warsaw Pact PCC statement on the Middle. East was
 issued on 3 December 1970; see the FBIS TRENDS of 9 December 1970,

 of the Geneva conference and said it should lead to solution of
 the "key problems"--complete Israeli withdrawal, insuring the
 Palestinians' rights, and guarantee of the security, integrity
 and sovereignty of all states of the area.
 ARMS ISSUE     Moscow has not acknowledged Egyptian President
 as-Sadat's recent series of public complaints of
 Soviet unresponsiveness to his requests for arms, or his state-
 ments that Egypt intends to end its arms dependence on' the USSR
 and seek other sources of supply.  But Soviet broadcasts in Arabic
 have been quick to warn the Arabs against relying on the West--
 particularly the United States--for military equipment and to
 reassure them that the USSR renders "comprehensive support, in-
 cluding arms," to the Arabs.  Arab audiences have been reminded
 that Washington remains the main arms exporter to Israel, and
 Moscow expressed "regret" over the placid reaction of "some Arabs"
 to the U.S. policy of continuing to arm and finance Israel and
 thus encourage its "aggressive, expansionist" policy.
 At the same tLuie, NorthAmeifcn listeners w. .: Lail, ire,,a.:brcad-
 Cal  bn"' the 19th, that`''~alIegaticns by''some `A eracans" that the
 USSR was encouraging the arms race in the Middle East were "absurd."
 A broadcast. in Arabic on the 18th, moreover, dismissed as a
 "hysterical reaction" an "allegation" by the British GUARDIAN
 that, judging from reconnaissance data reaching Washington, the
 Kremlin was actively encouraging the fighting on the Golan Heights.
 The true issue, the broadcast asserted, was the attempt by some
 U.S. journalists to turn the Arabs away from friendship with the
 USSR by convincing them that the U.S. attitude had changed and
 that Washington was even sending arms to the Arabs.
 An Arabic-language commentary on the 23d.denounced the BBC for
 attempting to undermine Egyptian-Soviet relations by talk  about
 Egyptian purchase of Western weapons, particularly from the United
 States, despite the fact that the U.S.. State Department "turned its
 back on this question."
 RELATIONS WITH     Moscow has shown increasing concern that the
 U.S., EGYPT         warming of relations between the United States
 and Egypt may encourage Cairo to adopt an in-
 creasingly hostile stance toward the USSR.  The broadcast to North
 America on the 19th cited columnist Joseph Alsop as writing that
 "influential U.S. quarters" would Me to induce Egypt to break
 off its "remaining ties" with the Soviet Union.  This certainly
 would not bring a Middle East settlement any nearer, the commentary
 said, and "it is diametrically opposed to the interest of peace as
 well as to the spirit and letter of the Soviet-American agreements."

 Broadcasts in Arabic have complained that "certain persons" were
 taking a neutral attitude toward both the Soviet Union and the
 United States.  A boadcast on the 23d referred cryptically to
 "certain diplomatic activities," in addition to "subversive pro-
 paganda," aimed at disrupting Soviet-Egyptian relations.  The
 commentary took the position that these relations had weathered
 difficult tests and subversive actions before and would withstand
 them again, and pointedly, recalled how Egypt in the past had re-
 jected British and American conditions attached to offers of help
 in building the Aswan data.
 Indications of diplomatic efforts to heal the Moscow-Cairo breach
 have recently been reported by Middle Eastern sources.  The MIDDLE
 EAST NEWS AGENCY said on the 23d that the Soviet charge, at his
 request, had been received by Foreign Minister Fahmi and had handed
 him a letter from Brezhnev "on the Middle East problem."  According
 to an IRAQI NEWS AGENCY report, the Cairo AL-AHRAM said on the 24th
 that Brezhnev's message included a reply to as-Sadat's expression
 of readiness "to meet with the Soviet leaders."
 SADAT STATEMENTS     Soviet media have virtually ignored as-Sadat's
 series of public statements outlining his troubles
 with Moscow.  A Moscow broadcast in Arabic on 29 March summed up in
 two paragraphs the Egyptian president's interview with the Beirut
 AL-ANWAR, published that day.  The Moscow account merely noted that
 as-Sadat called for complete Israeli withdrawal, described Israeli
 demands for secure borders as an effort to retain some occupied
 territory, and asserted that Egypt and Syria held identical views
 on Syrian-Israeli disengagement.  In the Cairo version of the
 interview, as-Sadat had also complained that the Soviets had tried
 to mislead him during the October war by falsely reporting that the
 Syrians were asking for a cease-fire.
 In a speech in Alexandria on 3 April, as-Sadat discussed at length
 his difficulties with the Soviet Union in obtaining arms, and in
 hl.s 18 April speech to the ASU and the People's Assembly he mentioned
 several aspects of the "misunderstandings" with the Soviet Union--over
 arms, Egypt's "abandonment of socialism," and its improvement of
 relations with the United States.  The latter speech was reported
 by Soviet media in one-line items:  TASS noted that as-Sadat submitted
 a working document on Egyptian domestic and foreign policy, and Moscow's
 domestic and Arabic services said he declared that without Syrian-
 Israeli disengagement there would be no progress in implementing
 Resolution 242.

 Moscow may have chosen to reply to as-Sadat's charge that it had
 falsely reported Syrian intentions during the war by way of cir-
 culating the Soviet side of the argument in the Beirut press. A
 document described as a statement by Ambassador Vinogradov to
 Egyptian "official and political personalities" was published in
 the Beirut AS-SAFIR on 16 April.  It would appear to have been
 given a stamp of authenticity by its-republication the following
 day in the Lebanese Communist Party organ AN-NIDA'.  In the state-
 ment Vinogradov, who was the Soviet ambassador to Cairo during
 the war, maintained that in his "daily" meetings with as-Sadat
 from 4 to 29 October last year there were no acrimonious debates
 or differences of any kind, and no criticism of the Soviet stand.
 The ambassador gave his version of the Syrian cease-fire request,
 suggested that there were some Soviet-Egyptian differences on
 military strategy in the Sinai campaign, and recounted the events
 of 20 October when he said as-Sadat urgently asked Soviet inter-
 vention to obtain a cease-fire.  According to the story attributed
 .to Vinogradov, the Soviet leaders on receipt of this request ,.
 "immediately issued, a decision for 'a partial  alert of the' Soviet
 forces and mobi: t a.a ' ven Soviet.miliLary,,,divisions" and, in fact,

 WARSAW PACT MEETING
 FBIS TRENDS
 24 APRIL 1974
 COMMUNIQUE REVEALS LITTLE NEW SUBSTANCE ON SECURITY ISSUES
 The communique on the 17-18 April meeting of the Warsaw Pact's
 Political Consultative Committee (PCC) revealed little that was
 new, either in substance or form, in the formulations on
 European security and force reductions.  It made the appropriate
 bow to the goal of easing international tensions and briefly
 noted  that the treaties and agreements reached with the FRG
 have contributed to "normalizing the situation" in Europe.
 This reflects the view of Moscow and its allies that the "German
 question" is now a matter of history and that the CSCE should
 signal an acceptance by all European states of the postwar
 status quo.  As usual, the communique reaffirmed the readiness
 of the Warsaw Pact to disband itself simultaneously with NATO,
 or as a first step, to liquidate their military organizations.
 The communique did not, however, reaffirm the unity of the
 Warsaw Pact, an omission which clearly reflects Romania's
 independent stance.
 SECURITY CONFERENCE     The-lengthy section of-the-communique. dealing with the CSCE repeated the call,
 long stressed in Soviet bloc comment and official statements,
 for a summit-level concluding session to be held at the "earliest"
 possible date.  Although Moscow has usually not been specific
 about the timing of the third stage summit meeting, tc has carried
 several recent reports which indicate that it may be miming for a
 mid-summer 1974 windup.  Moscow radio on 4 April cited a U.S.
 delegate to Geneva as saying that he thought the second stage
 would be "completed in June."  On 5 and 22 April TASS publicized
 statements by Finnish government leaders pointing out that
 Helsinki is ready to hold the third stage in July, or when
 necessary.
 The present communique pointed out that the conference's third
 stage should not be regarded as an end in itself but as a
 starting ioint for "the historic work of building new relations
 between all the states of the European continent."  It went on
 to call again for the creation of a permanent organ to oversee
 the implementation of the security treaty once the conference
 was over,
 Although the communique denounced what it called "attempts to,create
 obstacles, to drag out the work" of the conference, and to detour

 it from "solving crucial tasks," it avoided the harsher language
 commonly used in the denunciations of Western "obstructionism"
 on the CSCE's third "basket" of humanitarian and personal contacts
 issues.  The section of the communique dealing with these issues
 contained no reference to alleged Western attempts to interfere
 in the domestic affairs of the socialist states, nor any
 insistence on the need for respecting the sovereignty and laws
 and customs of states.  By contrast, the last previous joint
 summit statement by Soviet bloc leaders, the 31 July 1973
 communique on the third annual Crimea meeting,-declared:
 :'Approved For Release 1999/09/25: CIA-RDP85T00875R000300070017-0-
 The socialist countries proceed from the view that
 this cooperation must develop in the framework of
 strict respect for sovereignty of every state and
 noninterference in its internal affairs, while
 observing the laws and taking into account the
 customs and traditions of every country.
 The mellowing of the language on personal contacts and the exchange
 ,,,of ideas  reflects, the generally optimistic attitude that the Soviet
 and East ru.rope ii  routn 4Ao teas a ui~  sccci during, x1Lte CSLL Easter
 recess,'5_22"'April.  Tf is 'is clearly'related to the successful
 conclusion of the draft agreement on the principle of inviolability
 of borders on 5 April, which Moscow has described a3 the removal
 of a major stumbling bloc.;: to agreement. Chief Soviet delegate to
 CSCE Kovalev, in a recor:L-i statement broadcast by Moscow radio
 on the 6th, said that by adopting the agreed text on borders the
 second stage of the conference has overcome "a steep political
 obstacle in its work."  Warsaw PAP's special correspondent in
 Geneva, Mysae, asserted on 19 April that "now the wording of the
 principle of the inviolability of borders is such that the
 socialist states will be able to sign it without objection."  The
 full text of the agreement has not yet been published in Soviet
 or East European media.
 FORCE REDUCTIONS     The communique's one paragraph on the Vienna
 force reductions negotiations was routine and
 uninformative.  It stated that the Pact leaders again affirmed the
 position taken by the January 1972 PCC meeting, namely, that
 recognition of the principle of "undiminished security for all the
 parties to the talks, with due consideration for the security of
 all the European states," makes it possible to reach a "constructive"
 agreement.  Possibly with a nod to the Romanians, who have
 repeatedly stated publicly that talks on reductions of forces and
 armaments should also be extended to the Balkans, the communique
 declared that the success of the current negotiations would "create
 favorable conditions" for holding such talks in the future concern-
 ing "other areas of Europe."

 24 APRIL 1974
 East European media in recent weeks have openly acknowledged
 difficulties between Romania, on the one hand, and Moscow and its
 five orthodox allies,, on the other, concerning MBFR.  One bone
 of contention has been Bucharest's dissatisfaction with the
 unofficial meetings which have taken place in Vienna outside
 the framework of the formal conference.  AGERPRES publicized the
 Romanian delegate's remarks at the 21 March plenary session
 which criticized the unofficial contacts.  And Ceausescu
 personally, in an interview with a Vienna paper on the 23d,
 voiced his concern over the "framework" in which the talks were
 taking place.
 These signs of irritation by the Romanians were then followed by
 an item in the Hungarian press which implied that Romania in fact
 does not support the agreed Warsaw Pact position at Vienna.
 Writing in the Hungarian government daily MAGYAR HIRLAP on
 31 March, Imre Tatar said that the proposal of the four direct
 socialist participants--the USSR,. GDR, CSSR, and Poland--is
 "fully supported by Hungary and Bulgaria, countries attending
 the Vienna talks with consultative rights."  The only other
 socialist special participant, Romania, was not mentioned.
 BUCHAREST CONTINUES TO RESIST MOSCOW ON COMMUNIST UNITY
 Romanian obstructionism at the Warsaw Pact meeting was pointed up
 by the notable failure of the final communique to include any
 reference to unity, limiting itself merely to calls for strength-
 ening "friendship" and "cooperation."  By contrast, the communique
 issued at the end of the January 1972 meeting of Pact leaders in
 Prague had recorded the participants' determination to increase
 "the stability of the socialist countries' unity."  As was the-case
 in the communiques of the two Pact summit meetings that preceded
 the June 1969 Moscow international conference of communist parties,
 the 19 April communique failed to endorse current moves for a new
 world conference.
 Where the 1972 communique had called for "repulsing imperialist
 aggression," the current document merely noted, in connection with
 the 20th anniversary of the Warsaw Pact in 1975, that cooperation
 between the Pact member states "strengthens the defense capability"
 of the alliance.  The communique added routinely that, as long as
 NATO exists "and effective disarmament measures have not been
 implemented," the Pact members consider it necessary "to strengthen
 their defenses."

 BILATERAL MEETINGS     The continued tension between Moscow and
 Bucharest was reflected in the characteriza-
 tion by Soviet and Romanian sources of the 18 April talks between
 Brezhnev and Ceausescu as merely "comradely:"        By contrast,
 Brezhnev's bilateral talks with Zhivkov, Husak, Kadar, and Gierek,
 respectively, during the Pact session, were described as "friendly,"
 and his meeting with Honecker was depicted as "fraternal and
 cordial."  At the same time, the blunt "comradely" designation
 was not uniformly used in reports of meetings involving the-
 Romanian leaders:  TASS reported on the 18th that Kosygin had a
 "friendly" conversation with new Romanian Premier Manea Manescu,
 and the Bucharest radio the same day reported a "friendly" meeting
 between Ceausescu and Gierek.
 FOLLOWUP COMMENT     Perhaps because of the absence-of the unity
 clause in the communique, both Moscow and its
 orthodox allies have heavily stressed this themeS in. their followup
 comment.  Thus the 21 April PRAVDA editorial viewed the results of
 the meeting as "vivid evidence of the growing unity and cohesion
 of the fraternal states, and the inteneifiatsion of.coordination of
 their foreign policy-activities."  Ceausescu, presumably under
 .. heavy pressure, had` joined the other participants in subscribing to
 coordination  of foreign policy in the communique on the 31-July
 1973 Crimea meeting of Soviet bloc leaders, but was apparently
 successful in opposing its inclusion in the 19 April Pact communique.
 The only direct reference to Romanian obstructionism in the media
 of a participating country appeared in a Prague domestic service
 commentary on the 19th on the results of the Warsaw Pact meeting.
 In an allusion to the traditional Romanian posture of independence,
 the Prague commentator charged that Western analysts "exaggerated
 and blew up certain unimportant nuances in the Romanian attitude
 at certain international talks and expected, like the Peking Maoists,
 that a rift or at least a serious. difference of opinion would take
 place at Warsaw."  Contrary to such hopes, the commentary maintained,
 the Warsaw Pact countries' "highest" representatives approved "with
 complete unanimity all decisions" on their further mutual cooperation
 and on key world issues.

 CPSU  SLOGANS
 MAY DAY SLOGANS REFLECT CONCERN OVER WORLD TROUBLE SPOTS
 The CPSU Central Committee slogans for this May Day continue the
 recent practice of deemphasizing contentious issues in inter-
 national relations and communist affairs while focusing specifically
 on major world trouble spots.  Slogans calling for measures to make
 detente trends "irreversible" and proclaiming the "historic victory"
 of the Vietnamese over imperialism remain unchanged.

 the European security conference, the slogan on Europe adds a call
 to "strive for the successful completion of the conference on
 questions of European security.
 +                         The disarmament slogan adds a plea for "termination of the arms
 race" to previous calls for general and complete disarmament and
 the implementation of Moscow's 1972 nonuse of force proposal at the
 United Nations.
 + . An expression of concern about developments :in?,Chile?,- inserted...
 for the first time last October, has now been broadened to include
 a specific call for freeing Chilean Communist Party Secretary-
 General Luis Corvalan and "all prisoners of the fascist junta."
 +  Reflecting the evolving situation in the Middle East, the slogans
 replace a demand for an end to "Israeli aggression" with a call
 for "a reliable and stable peace for all states and peoples" and a
 routine call for elimination of the "consequences" of Israeli
 aggression.
 +  The most notable change in the domestic slogans reflects priorities
 set out in Brezhnev's speech to the December 1973 CPSU plenum in
 calling on agricultural workers to "develop specialization on 'the basis
 of the concentration of agricultural production and interfarm
 cooperation."

 MODERATES GAIN LEADERSHIP OF KEY SOVIET IDEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE
 The six-month deadlock over leadership of one of the Soviet Union's
 top ideological institutions, the Institute of Marxism-Leninism,
 was finally broken in mid-April with the identification of former
 KOMMUNIST chief editor A.G. Yegorov are new director of the institute.
 The post had been vacant since early November 1973, and the naming
 of an official with Yegorov's moderate credentials to head a key
 institution for interpreting Soviet doctrine appears to represent
 a victory for the forces of moderation in the leadership.*  Yegorov
 had authored a highly controversial article in the November 1973
 issue of the literary journal ZNAMYA, an article that expounded
 unusually moderate positions on a wide range of intellectual issues.
 By contrast, his predecessor as director, P.N. Fedoseyev, has been
 one of the prime movers of the recent ideological crackdown on
 the social sciences.
 Yegorov'had been abruptly removed in January as chief editor of
 KOMMUNIST'in circumstances suggesting he was in disfavor because
 of his ZNAMYA article.  Since then the top post in KOMMUNIST has
 remained vacant, and the journal has become a forum for sharply
 divergent viewpoints.  At a belated ceremony in Moscow on 17 April
 commemorating the 50th anniversary of KOMMUNIST, the journal was
 represented by deputy chief editor Ye. I. Bugayev.  The continued
 vacancy in the regime's principal theoretical journal indicates
 that the issues in dispute remain unresolved.
 The 66-year old Fedoseyev apparently surrendered the post of institute
 director in late October or early November, his last identification
 in this position being in the 24 October MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA.  Since
 13 November he has been identified in the central press only as vice
 president of the USSR Academy of Sciences, a post he had held
 .concurrently since 1971.  Apparently because of this vacancy,
 important conferences in the institute on 18 December and 18 January
 were supervised by first deputy director P.A. Rodionov, with neither
 Fedoseyev nor Yegorov in attendance.
 Yegorov was identified as institute director in PRAVDA on 16 April--
 the same day the leade7ship sent a belated message of congratulations
 and an Order of Lenin t:o KOMMUNIST on its anniversary.  The 54-year

 old Yegorov had not been mentioned for three months following his
 removal as editor of KOMMUNIST and the appearance of his ZNAMYA
 article.  In his new0post Yegorov will have overall responsibility,
 under the provisions of the 14 August 1967 CPSU Central Committee
 decree on the social sciences, for work in the field of party
 history--a field of study serving mainly to rationalize and
 authenticate current Soviet policies.
 FEDOSEYEV'S ROLE      In contrast to the moderate views expressed
 by Yegorov, Fedoseyev has in recent years
 been stressing the threat of ideological subversion.  After he
 became director of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism in May 1967,
 Fedoseyev allied himself with Brezhnev's Stalinist protege,
 S.P. Trapeznikov, head of the CPSU Central Committee section for
 science and higher educational institutions, against the forces of
 moderation led by A.M. Rumyantsev.  The latter had succeeded
 Fedoseyev as Academy of Sciences vice president in May 1967.
 Attempts by moderates to legitimize sociology in the Soviet Union
 succeeded in 1968 in having established the Institute for Concrete
 Social Research, with Rumyantsev as its director.  The new
 institute became one of the most innovative institutions in the
 Soviet social sciences as well as a prime target for criticism by
 advocates of orthodoxy led by Trapeznikov??and Fedoseyev.
 The reactionary campa:i.6n to discredit Rumyantsev succeeded in
 obtaining his ouster both as Academy of Sciences vice president in
 May 1971 and as director of the sociological institute several
 months later.  Fedoseyev then resumed the post of academy vice
 president, and M.N. Rutkevich, who in 1969 had echoed Fedoseyev's
 criticism of innovative, empirically-oriented sociology, became
 director of Rumyantsev's institute.*
 In December 1971 Fedoseyev assailed sociologists for copying Western
 methods.  In 1972 the Presidium of the Academy of-Sciences-censured
 the institute's former leadership for ideological shortcomings and
 ordered the institute to reorganize its work "on the basis of
 dialectical and historical materialism."  The institute was renamed
 the Institute of Sociological Research, dropping the word "concrete"
 from its title as smacking of empiricism.  In his role as social
 science supervisor Fedoseyev also keynoted the December 1971 founding
 congress of the new Philosophy Society, calling for intensification
 of ideological influences in the social sciences.

 CURRENT CRACKDOWN     In the spring of 1973 Trapeznikov began a
 renewed campaign against the dangers of
 ideological penetration from abroad in an era of emerging detente.
 At a May 1973 Central Committee conference of the Academy of
 Sciences division on philosophy and law, Trapeznikov, Rutkevich
 and others denounced ideological errors in philosophy, sociology
 and law.  On 28-30 November Trapezni.kov convened a similar
 conference of economists to reassert ideological orthodoxy in
 this field.  He was. joined by Fedosayev and others in- accusing
 the nation's leading economist, N., P. Fedorenko, of deviating
 from Marxist-Leninist ideology and.importing alien ideas--the
 same charges used to discredit Rumyantaev and the unorthodox
 sociologists in 1971.
 Fedorenko, director of the Central. -Economic .Mathematlcs .Institute,
 had become academic_secretary.of.the.economic diuision.of the
 Academy of Sciences at the same May 1971..academy.session which
 elected Fedoseyev as vice preside.nc. in place of Rumyantsev. .

 Although the editorial appeared to be a thinly disguised   ply
 to Trapeznikov's hardline speech at the May 1973 confer'nce on
 philosophy, sociology and law, its broad applicability to all
 of the social sciences was clearly evident.  Whereas Trapeznikov
 had complained that persons "calling themselves innovators"
 were "vulgarizing" Marxism-Leninism and that detente increased
 the need for tightening up controls against ideological
 subversion, the editorial emphasized the need to seek truth
 "no matter how bitter and mercilessly. critical it is" and
 the importance of objective research under conditions of
 increased contacts with the West.
 This remarkable editorial, as well as the prolonged stalemate
 over the choice of new leaders for the Institute of Marxism-
 Leninism and the journal KOMMUNIST, suggests the absence of
 a stable consensus in the top Soviet leadership.  The deadlock
 over the new chief editor for KOMMUNIST was apparently respon-
 sible for the postponement of the scheduled 5 April celebration
 of KOMMUNIST's 50th anniversary.  Even so, when the ceremony was
 finally held, the journal remained without a new chief editor.

 CYPRUS
 MOSCOW SEES TURKEYS FEDERATION PROPOSAL AS NATO PLOT
 Moscow, in sustaining its low-keyed but persistent comment
 supporting an independent Cyprus, has recently moved toward
 open disapproval of a Turkish-advocated "federal." solution which
 it suggests would amount to partitioning the island between
 Greece and Turkey,  Mindful of its relations with the various
 concerned states, Moscow itself has not directly attributed t,)
 Ankara the federation proposal, set forth in the program of
 Prime Minister Ecevit's government in January.*  Instead, it
 ha3 described the idea as a disguised ploy for partition in the
 interests of "NATO circles" which allegedly wish 1:o convert the.
 island into a military base. At the same time Moscow has continued
 to accuse the Greek regime of collaboration with the Greek Cypriot
 EOKA underground movement of the late General Grivas in furtherance
 of enosis, or union with Greece.
 Some years ago Moscow mentioned the idea of federation as a
 possible solution for the Cyprus problem, but only within the
 framework of a single state.  Following a Podgornyy visit to
 Turkey in January 1965, Gromyko in an IZVESTIYA interview later
 that same month had remarked that Cypriots might choose a federal
 structure, but that such a system presupposed the existence of
 a single central government, single defense organization, and
 centralized administrative and judicial system.  Since that
 interview the question of federation has not been broached in
 elite comment and only rarely in routine propaganda.
 In keeping with the USSR's contention that Cyprus' communal
 differences must be settled by the two communities without outside
 interference, Soviet propaganda has supported the inter-Cypriot
 talks since they began in 1968. The talks have been suspended
 since early April over the issue of Turkey's espousal of a federal
 solution, which according to the Makarios government altera the
 basis of the talks, which are premised on a unitary state.
 *  The Turkish-language communist clandestine "Our Radio" in a
 16 April broadcast did rebuke Ecevit for advocating a federal system
 for Cyprus, claiming this had annoyed "progressive public opinion"
 in Cyprus just as Greek support for enosis had done, and observing
 that Ecevit's suggestion "has been characterized as intervention."

 COMMENT ON     PRAVDA on 21 March foreshadowed the current impasse
 FEDERATION     on the inter-Cypriot talks when it critized EOKA
 demanQts for enosis as well as demi%nds for par~:ition
 "irrespective of their origin."  Encouragement of thesm demands,
 PRAVDA declared, could only be regarded Rs Interference in the
 internal affairs of the sovereign Cypriot state.
 A Moscow broadcast in Greek to Cyprus on 4 April, two days after
 the talks were broken off, pointed t:+ "foreign press" debate on
 the question of establishing a federation on the island ;=:nd charged
 that "leading NATO circles" were a couraging such discussions in an
 effort to thwart the talks.  The broadcast cited President Makarios
 as declaring that creation of a federal state was impossible because
 "in Cyprus there are no prerequisites for a federation," which
 would be unacceptable to a great majority of the population?  And
 a Greek-language commentary broadcast to Cyprus on 18 April asserted
 that the Cyprus Government was "absolutely justified" in rejecting
 any change in the basis of the talks.  The new difficulties in the
 talks had arisen, it explained, when the press of "certain NATO
 member countries" began propagandizing the idea of solving the Cyprus
 problem on the basis of federation.
 Moscow presented the same argument to the other side in a Turkish-
 language commentary broadcast. to Cyprus on the 19th.  After first
 routinely denouncing enosis, the commentary offered various arguments
 against the notion of a federal state being bruited about by "some
 authoritative NATO politicians."  For one thing, it said, Turkish
 Cypriots were scattered geographically, and separation would be
 "practically impossible," not to say unnecessary since Greeks and
 Turks could and did work and live together.  Capping its argument,
 the commentary added that "NATO's plans to partition Cyprus are
 hidden behind words of federation."
 PRAVDA took up the issue again on the 21st in an article exploiting
 Cypriot press agitation over the arrival at British bases of U.S.
 military personnel and equipment in connection with the assemblage
 of helicopters for use in mine-sweeping operations in the Suez Canal.
 The PRAVDA article, as reported by TASS, warned that this development
 was at variance with the relaxation of tension in the eastern
 Mediterranean and spoke darkly of "hostile intrigues of the NATO
 military and their agents" on the island.  PRAVDA pointedly went on
 to caution against plans for a division of the island or for "such
 a reform of its state system" as would lead not to stronger cohesion
 but to isolating Greek and Turkish Cypriots from each other.

 CHINA
 KIRIN LEADERSHIP CRITICIZED, TRADE UNIONS ASSUME MAJOR ROLE
 An 18 April Kirin radio report of 'a provincial trade union rally
 stated that the provincial party committee must be "held re.f,porisible"
 for errors committed during the previous stage of the campaign
 against Lin and Confucius and emphasized that workers must be the
 "major force" in implementing the current campaign.  The broadcast
 thus seems to be a response to a 2 February PEOPLE'S DAILY
 editorial, which warned cadres that the issue of criticizing
 Lin and Confucius would be "a test for every leading comrade" and
 that the .fitter would not be allowed to assume a passive role.
 The Kirin meeting report stated that some cadres "were afraid to
 mobilize the masses" and some even "suppressed the masses" out    y,
 of fear of criticism.
 The Kirin trade union meeting carefully stressed the need for
 unified party leadership at every stage of this campaign.  It
 also firmly reiterated guidelines contained in several recent
 PEOPLE'S DAILY editorials emphasizing the need for carrying
 out the campaign. without manifestations of factionalism and
 affirming  the overriding importance of stimulating production,
 with revolution relegated to "spare time."
 The trade union rally also added two more moderating injunctions
 to the list previously noted in central media.  It specifically
 prohibited "experience-exchanging" among various units and areas,
 which was responsible for much of the spread of the disorder
 connected with the cultural revolution, and it stated categorically
 that "mass organizations must not be formed within the armed forces."
 With the Shenyang military region, of which Kirin is a part,
 presumably in some disarray following the apparent purge of Li
 Te-sheng, the order may reflect actual, ongoing problems within
 PLA units in Kirin.
 While Kirin is the first province in which the provincial'. party
 committee has been criticized openly, other provinces have.called
 on mass organizations, especially the trade unions, to take-a more
 active role in the anti-Lin/Confucius campagin and have noted
 leadership problems at higher levels.  For example, a 12 April
 Honan broadcast noted that some leaders in Hopi municipality had
 doubted the ability of workers to serve as the main-force.in
 criticizing Lin, but that the party committee had attached great

 importance to the role of "mass organizations, particularly that
 of trade unions," had provided them with relevant central
 committee documents and had invited their participation.
 The first province to indict a provincial-level leadership
 organ for mistakes was Shansi, where the provincial cultural
 bureau was criticized last month for having encouraged the
 production of the opera "Three Trips to Taofeng."  While the
 provincial party committee was not attacked, Western press
 agencies have reported poster attacks on the Shansi first party
 secretary and one of 1;1s supporters.  The apparent victor in
 the provincial struggle' was Politburo member Chen Yung-kuei,
 who is also concurrently secretary of the provincial party
 committee and the Hsiyartg county committee and founder of the
 model Tachai production brigade.  A 19 April Shansi broadcast
 describing leadership activities in Hsiyang presumably reflects
 the recent victory in stating that county cadres no longer
 blindly follow instructions from upper levels but instead "ask
 'why?' about each instruction and see whether it conforris with
 reality and whether it is rational."

 INDOCHINA
 CAMBODIAN FRONT LEADER EXTENDS TOUR., REAFFIRMS FRONT UNITY
 Following its return to Peking from Pyongyang on 8 April, the
 Cambodian Front delegation led by insurgent armed forces chief
 Khieu Samphan spent two weeks visiting Peking and touring Chinese
 provinces before embarking on 19 April bn what appears likely to
 be a prolonged trip to several European and African countries.*
 Samphan's stay in China coincided with Prince Sihanouk's annual
 pl.lgrimage to North Korea on 11-23 April, to honor Kim II-song
 on his birthday.  Remarks by Sihanouk and Khieu Samphan during
 their i:avels have stressed the Front's unity in the face of
 alleged U.S. efforts to divide it, and have reiterated standard
 conditions for a peace settlement and denunciations of U.S.
 involvement in Cambodia.
 Following Samphan's return from Pyongyang and his welcome by PRC
 Politburo members Yeh Chien-ying and Wu Te, Peking was strangely
 silent about the Cambodian delegation's activities from 8 to 14 April.
 The sole reference to the, group.,was. NCNA!s. 12, April., report, that,
 on the previous day Samphan and his "special advisor" Ieng Sary
 had been present, along with Chou En-lai, to see Sihanouk off to
 the DPRK.  NCNA gave full coverage to the delegation's tour of PRC
 provinces.  The group left Peking for Szechwan, accompanied by
 Yeh Chien-ying, on the 14th, returned to Peking on the 17th, and
 was seen off for Albania by Yeh and Wu Te on the 19th,  NCNA reported
 that diplomats from Albania, Yugoslavia, Romania, Algeria, Mauritania,
 and Cameroon were at the airport--a good indication of the delegation's
 probable lengthy itinerary.
 The likelihood that Samphan's visit to Peking had provided an
 opportunity for high-level Front consultations was underlined by
 the appearance at the airport on the 19th of.the chief Front
 spokesman in Paris, Chau Seng.  The date of Chau Seng's arrival
 in China is unknown; he had not been reported to have been in
 Peking for several months.
 *  The delegation's earlier visits to Hanoi, Peking, and Pyongyang
 are discussed in the TRENDS of 3 April 1974, pages 9-11, and 10 April
 1974, pages 11-15.

 Kissinger is the target of criticism in both statements:  The DRV
 protest, for example, reiterates the charge--leveled at Kissinger
 in-connection with his 25 March letter to Senator Kennedy.-that
 he has distorted the spirit and letter of the Paris agreement to
 justify increased U.S. military involvement and interference in
 South Vietnam.
 REPORT ON DRV ARMY CAMPAIGN MENTIONS "PARTY MILITARY CONGRESS"
 Hanoi has begun a widespread "emulation drive" in the North Vietnamese
 armed forces, with the dissemination on 14 April of an instruction
 from the Standing Committee of the Central Military Party Committee
 and reports in the following days of meetings to launch the drive
 organized by military commands throughout the country,  Such campaigns
 are a regular feature of DRV military activities.  However, a surprising
 new element was introduced when Hanoi's report on one of the meetings
 raised the possibility of the convocation of an unprecedented nation-
 wide meeting of the army's political cadres:  A 16 April report on a
 meeting by the air defense and air force service quoted an unnamed
 "colonel political commissar-" as urging. emulation not. only., to. mark
 the May anniversaries of Ho Chi Minh'sbirth and Dien Bien Phu, but
 also to "greet the 2d party military congress."  There have been no
 other known references in Hanoi media to such a congress, either in
 the past or in the future.
 The instruction of the Central Military Party Standing Committee
 labeled the new campaign "the determined-to-win emulation drive"
 and cited as its objectives the education and encouragement of
 cadres and combatants, the development of the strength of the
 armed forces, and the motivation of the armed forces to participate
 in building the North and maintaining domestic order and security.
 To meet these objectives, the instruction advocated emulation in
 increasing combat strength, practicing self-discipline, developing
 the regular army, and stimulating"" production and practfcittg-' thirift:

 CHINESE LEADERSHIP:  CCP vice chairman Li Te-sheng has failed
 to join other party vice chairmen in sending a wreath to the
 funeral of a prominent PRC leader for the second time in succession.
 The 23 April NCNA account of the funeral of Fu Tso-i listed all
 other vice chairmen as having sent wreaths, as did the 27 March
 account of the funeral of Chen Yu.  Following Li's transfer to
 head the Shenyang military region at the end of last year, he was
 listed with other vice chairmen as sending wreaths to two funerals
 in January.  Thus his failure to send a wreath to the recent
 funerals is not explicable merely on the basis of his being the
 only vice chairman not resident in Peking.  His inclusion on the
 list for the second January funeral, on. the 30th, marked his last
 mention in PRC media.  Li has recently been the target of a wide-
 spread poster campaign.
 PEKINAON PRC. JAPAN AVIATION ACCORD:  Direct Chinese comment on
 the recently concluded' civil air agreement with Japan, a break
 through.on the most important issue facing the two countries since
 relations were normalized in 1972, has thus far been confined to
 brief welcoming remarks by Liao Cheng-chih, president of the China-
 Japan Friendship Association.  Liao predicted on 23 April, three
 days after the agreement was signed in Peking, that "no reactionary
 force on earth" can halt the historical trend for China-Japan friend-
 ship.  Peking's. strong interest in expediting the signing of other
 business agreements, as well as in a treaty of peace and amity with
 Japan, has, however, been revealed in several. NCNA reports publicizing
 carefully selected statements by various Japanese spokesmen on the
 accord.  An NCNA report on 23 April quoted a Japanese trade official
 as stating that Japanese businessmen are especially determined to
 support Diet ratification of the air agreement.  On 21 April-, two
 separate NCNA reports carried statements by several Japanese political
 leaders calling for the conclusion of a treaty officially ending
 World War II hostilities between the two countries.  Reflecting its
 sensitivity to the relationship now emerging between China and Japan,
 Moscow has not yet commented on the air agreement.

 PRC ON FRENCH ELECTIONS:  Peking's only report to date on the
 French presidential elections, a 19 April NCNA Paris dispatch,
 manages to suggest, by selective quotations, that each of the
 three main candidateO supports policies which Peking endorses--
 the development of European defense cooperation plus a continu-
 ing independent French foreign policy.  NCNA ignored French
 CP support for Francois Mitterand, noting only that he was
 "Jointly nominated by the opposition parties, including the
 Socialist Party."  NCNA applied similar disdainful. treatment
 to the French communists in reporting the Match 1973 parlia-
 mentary elections.  French communist leader Marchais had
 sharply criticized the Chinese leadership at the 26-28 January
 Brussels conference of West European communist parties, label-
 ling alleged PRC support for a West European political and
 military alliance as "an eloquent illustration of their
 desertion of the principles of proletarian internationalism."
 MOSCOW ON INTER-AMERICAN MEETINGS:  Moscow gave routine coverage
 to the 17-20 April Washington and Atlanta sessions of American
 foreign ministers attended by Secretary of State Kissinger, strtss
 ing that "sharp contradictions" emerged between the United States
 and other countries on major issues affecting inter-American
 relations.  Moscow described Kissinger as "sharply out. Oftune"
 with Latin American delegates-because he maintained silence on
 economic and trade policy and the status of Cuba and the Panama
 canal zone.  In a Spanish broadcast on the 18th by Soviet commentator
 Levchenko, Kissin.ger's.proposal for creation of a "new Western
 hemisphere community" was criticized as an attempt to "merely
 renew the facade" of.inter, -Amer ica.n.relations without instituting
 basic changes.  On the issue of Cuba, Moscow noted that the foreign
 ministers of Peru and Argentina called for an end to the blockade,
 and claimed that they and ethers opposed the embargo on the grounds
 that it contradicted present realities in Latin America as well as
 international detente. 'TASS prcmptl.y reported on the 19th the U.S.
 decision to authorize tha sale of automobiles to Cuba by Argentine
 subsidiaries.
