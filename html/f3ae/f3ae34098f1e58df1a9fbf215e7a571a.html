 SRI LANKA: Uneasy Calm
 Violence in Colombo has eased now that the government has
 toughened its stance toward the communal rioting.
 Following a week of indecision, President Jayewardene's
 government has curbed most violence with an islandwide, two-day
 curfew and increased military presence in major cities. There is still
 isolated looting and arson in Tamil neighborhoods, however,
 reportedly involving troops.
 Prime Minister Premadasa has appealed for calm and has
 claimed the violence is the result of "outside influences." The
 government has outlawed the three major leftist parties, as well as
 separatist political parties. Communist sympathizers, known
 terrorists, and criminals have been arrested.
 India publicly repeated its position that the crisis is an internal
 affair, following Foreign Minister Rao's visit to Colombo on Friday.
 New Delhi has denied plans to intervene but claims to be ready to
 send emergency relief help for Sri Lanka's Tamil citizens. According
 to the US Embassy in Islamabad, Colombo has called on Pakistan,
 Bangladesh, and the UK to be ready to send in peacekeeping forces if
 the need arises.
 Comment: The calm may not last. Jayewardene's government
 has yet to address several problems, including the care of over 73,000
 Tamil refugees now housed in camps around the capital.
 The severe damage to Colombo's food distribution network may
 lead to food riots as well. The islandwide curfew was lifted today,
 presenting the security forces with their first test at maintaining
 peace.
 In the past Colombo has often raised the specter of foreign
 intervention as a means of building national unity and diverting public
 attention from internal problems. Although Soviet support for both
 Tamil and Sinhalese extremist groups has long been suspected, no
 compelling evidence of direct involvement is available.

 USSR: Food Supplies Improve
 Shortages in the USSR of many quality foods have eased this
 year, but not enough to permit relaxing of the informal rationing
 system for selected food items that has spread widely since 1980.
 US Embassy surveys of private farm markets and state stores
 have shown increased supplies of most foodstuffs, as compared with
 last year. Meat production, for example, has risen substantially.
 some of the
 regions that have experienced substantial food shortages since 1980
 have rebounded somewhat.
 Comment: If meat production reaches the estimated level of
 16.2 million tons and imports approach the high level of 1982, per
 capita consumption would reach a record high. The record harvests
 of fruit and vegetable crops in 1982 have kept supplies plentiful. Milk
 production also has increased, and most of the lost per capita
 consumption of the last two years may be regained.
 During the past three years, the leadership has increased imports
 to maintain per capita consumption of some products. Import data for
 this year suggest that Moscow intends to sustain but not increase the
 import levels of the recent past.
 Food-related worker unrest has declined since 1981. This is
 largely the result of increased special food distribution to industrial
 installations and other worksites.
 The improved food supply in 1983 should ease the frustration of
 those without this special access. It also will allow the leadership to
 postpone decisions on hikes in the costs of food, which would be a
 departure from a longstanding commitment to stable food prices.
 Earlier this year the regime had indicated that it was considering price
 increases.

 CHINA-TAIWAN: Revival of Reunification Campaign
 Beijing has mounted a new campaign on reunification with Taiwan
 but is showing no willingness to broaden earlier proposals.
 The Chinese news agency reported on Friday recent comments
 made by Deng Xiaoping to a visiting US academician on reunification.
 The statements closely resemble the last authoritative Chinese
 proposal, issued in September 1981.
 Deng offered Taiwan the right to conduct its internal affairs as a
 special administrative region and to maintain separate armed forces.
 He also called for increased contacts and talks with Taipei between
 the ruling parties.
 Deng, however, said no foreign interference would be permitted.
 He also criticized US policies toward China as inconsistent.
 . Taipei immediately rejected the proposals by noting Beijing's
 broken promises to Tibet before that region was reunified with China.
 Comment: Beijing apparently wanted to put its official position on
 the record quickly after Western news reports suggested it was
 prepared to make significant new concessions to Taipei. Deng's ruling
 out of foreign interference almost certainly precludes purchases of
 foreign arms.
 The renewed emphasis on reunification over the past month puts
 Deng's stamp of approval on this issue publicly for the first time.
 Beijing wants to increase the pressure on Taipei to show more
 flexibility on reunification. The Chinese also intend to demonstrate to
 the US their continuing adherence to the principle of "peaceful
 reunification," which they promised to pursue in their communique
 with the US last August.

 Initialing of an agreement by Chinese and US negotiators in
 Geneva ends a yearlong effort to renew the textile trade pact that
 expired last December. The agreement permits moderate growth in
 Chinese exports of textile products to the US, which amounted to
 about $800 million last year. The five-year agreement places strict
 controls on 33 categories and provides a mechanism to negotiate
 further controls if Chinese exports threaten to disrupt US markets.
 Comment: Resolution of the textile issue removes political
 obstacles to Chinese purchases of US grain, which Beijing has
 prohibited since Washington imposed restraints on textile trade in
 January. Preliminary details of the agreement suggest a moderation
 in the Chinese position, probably due in part to improved Sino-US
 relations but also to protect the earnings derived from textile exports.
 Beijing appears to have been strongly influenced by the US
 restraints-which started to cut into sales this summer-and the
 reluctance of US retailers to place Christmas orders that might later
 be embargoed. China also has been unable to sell enough textile
 products to other buyers to offset the reduced US purchases.
 A pastoral letter highly critical of President Marcos's policy on
 human rights will be read throughout the country on 14 August. The
 letter is a plea to abolish the Presidential Commitment Order, a legal
 device the government has used to arrest and indefinitely detain
 suspected subversives among Church workers, the media, and the
 political opposition. The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the
 Philippines, which drafted the letter, is dominated by conservative
 bishops who traditionally have been reluctant to speak out against the
 government.
 Comment: This will be the second pastoral letter attacking the
 government in six months, and it may portend a more active
 antigovernment role for the Church. The new letter will complicate
 Manila's efforts to resume a dialogue with Church leaders. During the
 past year, Church-state relations have been unusually strained over
 the human rights issue and over the Church's alleged involvement
 with Communist subversives.

 POLAND: Interior Ministry Shakeup
 The recently announced reassignment of First Deputy Minister of
 Interior Stachura as the new Polish Ambassador to Romania reflects
 Premier Jaruzelski's continuing efforts to make the internal security
 ministry more res onsive.
 25X1
 25X1
 Legislation passed by parliament last month strengthened the
 ministry's central control over local police authorities.
 Comment: Jaruzelski will use Stachura's sacking and the recent
 legislation to tighten his control over the internal security apparatus.
 action also may be intended to demonstrate determination by the
 regime to deal with some of those responsible for overzealousness by
 police during martial law.
 TANZANIA: Separatist Sentiment on Zanzibar
 sentiment has become widespread
 on Zanzibar for abrogating the 19-year-old political union with the
 Tanzanian mainland, according to a fairly reliable source. Posters
 critical of President Nyerere began appearing on the island last
 month, and groups of Zanzibaris have been tearing down flags of the
 national political party.                      Zanzibaris
 increasingly see themselves as little more  an vassals of the
 mainland and also are angry over recent troop rotations in which
 mainland forces replaced some Zanzibari units on the island.
 Comment: Secessionist sentiment has been growing for some
 time as Zanzibar's predominantly Muslim residents chafe under the
 political and economic domination of the largely non-Muslim
 mainlanders. A national party conference scheduled for this fall will
 consider proposals to modify Zanzibar's constitutional relationship
 with the mainland. If Zanzibari grievances are not satisfied at this
 meeting, the prospect of major violence will increase, and Nyerere
 could be faced with a choice between allowing the island to secede or
 using military force to put down separatists. Either course would
 further tarnish the reputation of the Tanzanian President, who already
 is under growing criticism for his failure to halt the country's
 economic decline.

 Special Analysis
 IRAN: Planning for the Succession
 Top Secret
 Ayatollah Khomeini has taken steps to ensure that his policies will
 continue after his retirement or death. The 83-year-old leader recently
 revealed the existence of a sealed "will" that probably calls for
 continuation of the war with Iraq and unrelenting hostility toward the
 US and the USSR. Khomeini also has intensified pressure on clerical
 factions to resolve their differences. Although disputes among the
 clerics are the greatest threat to their continued control, a rapid
 disintegration of the regime after Khomeini dies is unlikely.
 Khomeini's health apparently is stable,
 His involvement in the
 government's business probably will decrease, however, as he grows
 more frail. As Khomeini declines, the power struggle among the
 clerics is likely to intensify.
 The Iranian leader and other influential clerics have already made
 some plans for the post-Khomeini era. The Ayatollah's 30-page "will,"
 which is to be released after his death, probably is similar to a "last
 speech" he reportedly videotaped in June.
 The Iranian exile media say that in the speech Khomeini calls for
 pursuing the war with Iraq until "final victory is gained in an all-out
 attack," recognizing that the US and USSR are both "satans," and
 strengthening the regime by choosing a single cleric to succeed him.
 After two years of delay, the clerical Assembly of Experts that will
 choose Khomeini's heir began meeting on 14 July.
 The clerical factions are loosely organized, and their membership
 varies with the issues under discussion. One faction, the "Line-of-the-
 Imam," wants to institutionalize the concept of combining political
 and religious leadership in the hands of a supreme "guardian cleric"
 similar to Khomeini.

 Parliamentary Speaker Rafsanjani, who probably is the country's
 second most powerful cleric, now supports this faction. Rafsanjani
 and the members of this faction are too junior to succeed Khomeini
 themselves, but they hope to preserve their power by installing a
 successor they can influence. They currently are backing Ayatollah
 Montazeri, regarded by many Iranians as Khomeini's choice as
 successor
 Montazeri is far less austere and intransigent than Khomeini. He
 supports continued war with Iraq and export of the revolution, is anti-
 Soviet, and has suggested that relations with the US are theoretically
 possible. No Iranian cleric will advocate actually opening contacts
 with the US, however, until the regime is certain of its ability to retain
 The other main faction-labeled "Hojjatieh"-has the sympathy
 of the most senior ayatollahs, who have tried to disassociate
 themselves from the Khomeini regime, and of influential clerics at the
 seminary in Qom. This faction has been growing stronger over the
 past two years. It is now supported by President Khamenei, a bitter
 rival of Rafsanjani.
 Supporters of Hojjatieh want a less autocratic regime with limited
 clerical involvement. They have sidetracked government proposals
 for major land reform and trade nationalization. The faction wants
 Western technology to rebuild Iran's economy, and it advocated the
 recent crackdown on the Tudeh Communist Party.
 Hojjatieh, however, has little chance of supplanting Montazeri
 completely. Its succession strategy probably is aimed at obtaining a
 "leadership council" rather than a single successor, and then having
 The faction's leading candidate is Ayatollah Meshkini, who
 recently was elected head of the Assembly of Experts. He takes a
 hard line on the war with Iraq and is antileftist.
 Prospects for Continuity
 At least initially, the clerics are likely to smooth over their
 differences in the interest of retaining power. Without Khomeini,
 however, they will have to rely more heavily on coercion of the
 populace. Even if the Assembly were to select Montazeri
 unanimously, he would not be able to evoke the same unquestioned
 obedience that Khomeini can command from the average citizens
 who are the mainstay of the regime.

 A power struggle among the clerics probably would focus on the
 question of their role in government. Each group is likely to try to
 impose its view as the authoritative interpretation of Khomeini's
 legacy.
 Although the groups probably would prefer to reach agreement
 through compromise, disgruntled clerics with ties to armed elements
 could provoke violence that would eventually threaten the regime's
 control. The Iranian press acknowledged in mid-June that supporters
 If Khomeini died suddenly, the senior clerics who head the
 Assembly of Experts would take the lead in ensuring policy continuity
 and a smooth transition. The foreign policy views of Montazeri and
 Meshkini suggest that Iran would remain at war with Iraq, and that
 relations with the USSR would remain cool.
 In Khomeini's absence, Rafsanjani, Khamenei, and other, more
 junior clerics would be able to argue more effectively for ending the
 war in the interest of economic recovery and consolidating clerical
 rule. Rafsanjani also might try to justify improving ties with the USSR
 as a balance to anticipated increased economic relations with the
 West.
 Whichever faction wins, the regime seems certain to remain highly
 ideological. The clerics will continue to pursue policies and activities
 identified with their Islamic revolution and with Iran's economic needs
 and interests. As a result, any rapid movement toward political
 moderation in Iran would be unlikely.
