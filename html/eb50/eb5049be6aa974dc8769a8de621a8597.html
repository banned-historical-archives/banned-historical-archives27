Synopsis 
1 Perspective�Growing Concerns Over Environmental Protection Costs 
The high price tag for protecting the environment is becoming more apparent as 
environmental issues attract greater political attention worldwide. Nevertheless, 
the momentum of international efforts to stem environmental degradation is 
unlikely to slow, and plans to address climate change, ozone depletion, and other 
environmental concerns will continue to develop at a rapid pace. 
5 USSR: Environmental Pressures Hurting Industrial Performance 
Over the past several years, numerous Soviet industrial plants have been closed for 
damaging the environment. Although the closings have helped reduce pollution, 
they also have led to shortages of critical products. Moscow has acknowledged that 
such closures endanger economic performance but has yet to develop an effective 
strategy to deal with the problem. 
11 Taiwan: Economic Considerations Outweighing Environmental Concerns 
Taiwan's growing pollution problems stem mainly from the government's "growth 
at any cost" economic policies over the past four decades. Although popular 
support for cleaning up the environment has increased in recent years, environ-
mentalists face an uphill battle because of Taipei's concern about the current 
slowdown in economic growth. We believe the issue will remain politically 
contentious, but environmental cleanup is unlikely to become a major part of 
Taipei's industrial policy, at least in the near term. 
17 EC: Impact of German Unification and East European Reforms on Agriculture 
Policy 
Although progress toward German unification and East European economic 
reform will gradually build pressure for reform of the European Community's 
protectionist Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), they are unlikely to significantly 
alter the EC's resistance to rapid liberalization of agricultural trade in the GATT 
Uruguay Round. By the mid-1990s, however, we believe rising East German farm 
output will increase CAP spending at a time when the EC will probably have to 
deal with mounting surpluses of such commodities as grain. Although budget 
constraints are likely to increase the likelihood of dramatic cutbacks in EC 
agricultural subsidies, EC member demands for some continued protection of 
agriculture might lead the Community to contemplate other policies troublesome 
to the United States

23 China: Seeking GATT Membership 
Beijing's desire to become a full GATT member has increased in light of the 
recent changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and China's need to boost 
exports because of poor prospects for foreign investment and tourism earnings. In 
addition to raising a number of thorny issues such as Soviet and East European 
membership, Chinese accession to GATT would offer Washington little in the way 
of leverage over further economic reforms in China. Moreover, it would probably 
accelerate the growth of Chinese exports to the United States but would have little 
impact on US sales, enlarging China's rapidly growing bilateral trade surplus and 
intensifying economic friction.

Perspective Growing Concerns Over Environmental Protection Costs 
The high price tag for protecting the environment is becoming more apparent as 
environmental issues attract greater political attention worldwide. Although West 
European countries generally remain firm advocates of strong environmental 
protection policies, some officials are beginning to have second thoughts. Japan 
believes environmental agreements offer opportunities to improve its image, but it 
also views such accords as potential threats to Japanese economic growth. East 
European and Soviet governments, meanwhile, are torn between domestic pres-
sures to clean up the environment and the impact of such action on their ailing 
economies. Although the newly industrializing economies (NIEs) are beginning to 
face up to serious environmental problems, they are largely unwilling to adopt 
policies that may impede continued rapid economic expansion. Similarly, some 
LDCs have already indicated they will oppose any global environmental protection 
agreements that compromise their prospects for economic development. Despite 
the growing concern over costs, the momentum of international efforts to stem 
environmental degradation is unlikely to slow, and plans to address climate 
change, ozone depletion, and other environmental concerns will continue to 
develop at a rapid pace. Economic issues nevertheless will almost certainly play a 
growing role in upcoming international environmental debates. 
Growing economic concerns about the cost of environmental protection may 
affect�albeit modestly�Western Europe's continuing determination to press for 
agreements on global environmental issues�particularly climate change. Al-
though most West European countries remain solidly behind efforts to develop 
agreements to address the climate issue and other concerns, economic ministries 
are becoming increasingly vocal in their criticism of greenhouse gas emission  
targets and may force governments to modify their environmental goals.( 
In Japan, economic considerations carry greater weight than in Western Europe. 
Japan, for example, has opposed the carbon dioxide emission targets favored by 
West Europeans because it sees such targets as limiting Japanese economic 
expansion. The Japanese trade ministry is attempting to divert attention from 
emission targets by promoting a 100-year plan to tackle climate change, ozone 
depletion, and other environmental problems through the development of new 
technologies. Although the plan lacks formal government approval or funding, 
Japan's final policies, which may eventually include loose emission targets, will 
carefully protect its economic interests.

In Eastern Europe, governments will have to face hard choices�balancing the 
popular mandate to clean up the environment with concerns over continued poor 
economic performance and rising unemployment. The GDR, Poland, Czechoslova-
kia, and Bulgaria already have announced plant closings or production cuts 
because of the negative environmental impact of specific plants. Some countries in 
the region also have begun to close coal mines as part of their effort to reduce their 
reliance on soft coal, which is particularly harmful to the environment. But 
demands for plant and mine closings on environmental grounds are beginning to be 
matched by union organization to defend jobs. Popular dissatisfaction with the 
environmental policies of the former East European governments helped bring 
about their downfall; the economic dislocation caused by policies such as plant 
closings could help crystallize discontent and lead to rejection of the newly elected 
governments. Although East Germany almost certainly will be spared this fate, its 
environmental problems are likely to become a significant economic burden for 
West Germany with the economic and environment union on 2 July. 
Moscow faces a dilemma similar to that of its East European neighbors. Despite 
growing grassroots activism that has forced Soviet central authorities to give 
greater attention to environmental problems, if additional plant closing further 
exacerbate shortages of key industrial and consumer goods, public pressure for an 
environmental cleanup may be subordinated to the goal of restoring economic 
growth. In any event, although Moscow is likely to be responsive to international 
environmental pressures, it will probably use its economic problems as a reason for 
not participating in many environmental agreements unless it can receive Western 
financial and technical assistance. 
Developing countries also demand aid and technology transfer as their price for 
participating in international environmental agreements. For example, some LDCs 
refuse to ratify the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone 
Layer until specific provisions are made to fund LDC acquisition of costly 
alternative technology needed to comply with the agreement's restrictions on 
common refrigerants, foams, and solvents. India is chief proponent of this view and 
recently sponsored a meeting of developing countries designed to build an LDC co-
alition that will pressure developed countries into providing aid in exchange for 
LDC acquiescence to environmental accords. LDC leaders also see environmental-
ism as a means to attract badly needed foreign investment. Countries such as 
Mexico, Brazil (in a reversal of its former policy), Paraguay, Ecuador, Chile, and 
Venezuela are actively seeking debt-for-nature swaps. 
The next several months, meanwhile, may indicate the extent to which China 
intends to enforce the sweeping environmental protection law it enacted early this 
year. It will likely further concentrate its efforts on cleaning up at least some of its 
worst polluted cities and rivers. Nevertheless, China admitted recently that it 
cannot afford to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among the NIEs, Taiwan is 
slowly beginning to face up to the environmental problems that arose from rapid 
industrialization, although its unwillingness to make significant economic conces-
sions will limit cleanup efforts.

The growing growing concern over the cost of environmental protection is likely to 
influence debates leading toward an agreement on climate change, in our 
judgment. In late August, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) will hold a plenary session in Sweden to thrash out the final version of its 
first assessment report on the causes, consequences, and policy responses to climate 
change. The report will be reviewed by the Second World Climate Conference in 
Geneva (29 October-7 November) and by the UN General Assembly. Both bodies 
almost certainly will make recommendations for a global climate convention, the 
negotiations for which could begin as early as December. Although economic 
issues such as targets and timetables for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and 
for providing aid to LDCs will probably be contentious, they are unlikely to delay 
passage of the convention. Nevertheless, economic concerns may prevent a number 
of countries from ratifying the convention or enforcing its provisions. 
Several other ongoing or upcoming environmental conferences also will almost 
certainly be affected by economic issues. The Conference of the Parties to the 
Montreal Protocol that began tlis week in London, for example, will devote a 
significant portion of the meeting to discuss the establishment of a financial 
assistance mechanism to help LDCs reduce their CFC use. Concerns over the cost 
of environmental protection also are likely to affect the second preparatory 
conference for the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development, in 
. 
August in Nairobi, and a  meetillig in Santiago in November on the Antarctic 
Minerals Regime Treaty.

USSR: Environmental Pressures 
Hurting Industrial Performance 
Over the last several years, numerous industrial plants 
throughout the USSR have been closed for damaging 
the environment. Most of the closures are a result of 
local initiative, with republic and national officials 
generally going along with local decisions. Although 
the closings have helped reduce pollution to some 
extent, they also have had a negative impact on 
already weak industrial performance. Indeed, the 
closure of polluting facilities has led to shortages of 
critical products�in particular, chemical and paper 
and pulp products. Although the leadership has ac-
knowledged that plant closings endanger economic 
performance, it has yet to develop an effective strate-
gy to deal with such closures. Gorbachev may believe 
shutdowns are less costly in the short run than 
devoting the resources necessary to clean up the 
environment�particularly at a time of large budget 
deficits and stiff competition for resources. 
Growing Environmental Concerns 
Although the central government has ordered some 
plant closings because of pollution, most of the pres-
sure has been at the local level. Soviet citizens�
joining together in informal groups�have seized upon 
glasnost to vent their anger at the environmental 
degradation in which they live. Local officials�no 
longer able to ignore the problem in the open political 
climate�have in most cases agreed to the demands of 
such groups. In an about-face, the central leadership, 
which once would have stifled such dissent, has 
acquiesced. Indeed, key policymakers now freely ad-
mit the country faces serious environmental problems. 
Prime Minister Nikolay Ryzhkov, for example, noted 
earlier this year that more than 100 large cities in the 
Soviet Union have air pollution 10 times the accept-
able levels set by the central government. The Soviet 
media�undoubtedly with Moscow's permission�also 
have encouraged the environmental movement by 
publishing disturbing stories on the human costs of 
pollution. As a result of the growing pressure, 70 to 
100 Soviet industrial facilities were shut down in 
5 
USSR: Environmental Horror Stories 
The Soviet media over the past year has helped fuel 
the nascent Soviet environmental movement with 
stories about the consequences of pollution. For 
example: 
� In Chardzhou, Turkmen SSR, children have been 
given gas masks to protect them from air pollution 
from a cotton-processing plant. 
� In Ufa, Bashkir ASSR, poisonous phenol leaked 
from a chemical plant into the river that is the 
city's main water source, forcing the people to rely 
on supplies brought in by truck. 
� In Ventspils, Latvian SSR�the site of a large 
chemical plant-40 percent of infants are born with 
serious congenital defects, such as blindness and 
mental retardation. 
� In Chernovtsy, Ukrainian SSR, children developed 
baldness because of pollution from a local chemical 
plant. 
� In Nizhniy Tagil, RSFSR, children's faces have 
been burned by smog caused by a 45-year-old coke 
oven at a steel plant there. 
1989, and almost twice as many have been closed or 
threatened with closure this year for violations of 
Soviet law on environmental protection, according to 
the Soviet press. Most of the closings involve chemical 
and timber-processing plants that have been polluting 
their surroundings for years. 
High Cost of Closures 
Plant closings have led to shortages of critical prod-
ucts and have contributed to the poor performance of 
the Soviet economy. The deputy chairman of the 
State Committee for Statistics stated in April, for 
example, that "mass shutdowns�owing to public

Soviet Popular Opinion: 
The Environment Comes First 
In a recent poll in the Moscow region conducted 
jointly by the Institute of Sociological Research of 
the USSR Academy of Sciences and a US university, 
those responding were more worried about domestic 
environmental problems than rising crime rates, food 
shortages, AIDS, and interethnic conflicts. More than 
three of four said they would refuse to tolerate 
environmental pollution for the sake of economic 
development. Moreover, respondents indicated they 
trusted "Green" groups more than any other institu-
tion in the Soviet Union apart from the church.

demand�of environmentally hazardous production 
units" were a major factor in the poor industrial 
performance during the first quarter of this year. For 
example: 
� Closure of the Nairit Production Association�part 
of the huge Yerevan Synthetic Rubber and Chemi-
cal Plant, in Armenia�has halted the USSR's 
production of a particular type of synthetic rubber 
and has led to a severe shortage of certain medi-
cines. Ryzhkov warned that closing the Nairit plant 
would result in shutting down 750 other industrial 
facilities that depend on it for materials, costing the 
national economy at least 14 billion rubles in lost 
output in 1990. As a result, he urged Armenian 
authorities to resume production despite the ecologi-
cal costs, but the plant remains closed. 
� The shutdown of several paper and pulp production 
plants has resulted in widespread shortages of vari-
ous paper products. For example, the Sloka Pulp 
Plant in Latvia�closed earlier this year because it 
had contaminated popular vacation beaches by 
dumping untreated waste into the nearby Baltic�
was the USSR's sole source of paper for computer 
punchcards, book and magazine covers, braille pub-
lications, and packaging for cigarettes and ice 
cream cups. The USSR Council of Ministers has 
predicted the closing of such plants will lead to an 
overall pulp shortage of 500,000 tons and losses of 
1 billion rubles per year.

� The closing�for environmental reasons�of three 
sulfuric acid plants in Lithuania before its declara-
tion of independence will mean that all-union pro-
duction of fertilizers is likely to be 1 million tons�
or some 3 percent�less than planned, according to 
Western reporting. 
The social costs of closing polluting plants�in partic-
ular, increased unemployment�also may be high. 
According to Pravda, more than 6,000 workers in the 
printing industry will have to find other jobs because 
of the Sloka closing. To help minimize the social costs 
of closures and reduce the threat of unrest, authorities 
in some cases have closed only small production units 
rather than the entire plant. In other cases, plants 
have been closed repeatedly because the ministries 
made either few or no changes. For example, the 
Nairit plant had been closed in 1988, and the Keme-
rovo plant had been closed in 1984 and again in 1989. 
Despite the economic and social costs, closing pollut-
ing plants is generally less expensive than moderniz-
ing or converting the facilities. Where the costs of 
conversion appear to be acceptable, the Soviets have 
7 
begun to make such changes. A chemical plant in 
Barnaul, for example, shifted from the production of 
paints and solvents to the production of medicines. 
Converting a plant from one product to another that is 
compatible with the facility's equipment, however, 
does not guarantee against further pollution. 
Moscow Lacks a Game Plan

(b)(3) 
Although the Soviet leadership has acknowledged 
that plant closings endanger economic performance, it 
has yet to develop an effective strategy to deal with 
such closures. To date, Moscow's response has been 
largely bureaucratic, calling upon a national commis-
sion, the ministries, and oblast and republic officials 
to work toward reopening the plants on an environ-
mentally sound basis. The two governmental agencies 
charged with protecting the environment�Goskomgi-
dromet, the State Committee for Hydrometeorology 
and Environmental Control, and Goskompriroda, the 
State Committee for the Protection of Environment�
have been jockeying for power since Goskompriroda

Shortages of Essential Medicines 
Soviet officials agree that an emergency situation in 
availability of medicines has developed as a result of 
chemical plant closings. The Ministry of the Medical 
Industry projected a 30- to 40-percent decrease in 
production in 1990 because of the shortages of raw 
materials. At least one-third of all Soviet plants that 
produced medicines and drugs were closed for envi-
ronmental reasons in 1989, according to a Western 
specialist speaking at an international conference in 
March. The Nairit plant in Armenia, which was 
closed earlier this year, produced cardiovascular 
drugs, muscle relaxants, fever retardants, pain reliev-
ers, and vitamins. Closing the production unit at the 
fertilizer plant in Kemerovo, meanwhile, halted the 
output of chemicals necessary for the manufacture of 
14 medicines, including antibiotics and gastrointesti-
nal and cardiovascular drugs, as well as medical 
supplies such as X-ray film. Shutdowns of chemical 
plants in Kiev and Dneprodzerzhinsk resulted in 
similar losses, and the copper-smelting combine at 
Kirovgrad was forced to stop production of an acid 
used in the manufacture of antibiotics and cardiovas-
cular medicines. 
According to Prime Minister Ryzhkov, the USSR in 
1989 was forced to buy some $954 million worth of 
medicines abroad�much of it for hard currency. He 
implied that the government would be hard pressed to 
meet similar expenses in 1990. Nevertheless, addi-
tional medicines have been purchased abroad, ac-
cording to an official in charge of distribution.

function as the monitoring agency and Goskomprir-
oda as the policymalcing and enforcement agency. The 
former, however, has not given up many of its activi-
ties that may be perceived as endangering the envi-
ronment such as damming and rerouting rivers, and 
Goskompriroda still does not have the constitutional 
authority to enforce all-union compliance. As a result 
Soviet Environmental Legislation 
Over the past 20 years, the Soviets have passed 
numerous environmental protection regulations in an 
effort to deal with their serious pollution problems. 
The legislation sets penalties for noncompliance such 
as: 
� Jail terms and confiscations of property for dam-
ages caused by mining. 
� Jail terms, correctional tasks, or fines for illegal 
deforestation. 
� Fines and imprisonment for release of industrial 
pollutants into water sources that supply the popu-
lation and agriculture. 
� Fees charged for disposal of industrial pollutants. 
The Soviets, however, have not enforced environmen-
tal protection regulations equally against offenders. 
Indeed, some industries�including the worst pollut-
er, the chemical industry�have been exempted. 
More recently, the Supreme Soviet in 1989 an-
nounced the "Urgent Measures for the Country's 
Ecological Improvement" that set standards for re-
duced levels of air and water pollution by the year 
2005. The legislation, however, is still under discus-
sion in the Committee on Ecology and Rational 
Utilization of Natural Resources. Even if it clears the 
committee, the legislation is unlikely to be passed by 
the Supreme Soviet because of its high price tag. 
Moreover, Goskompriroda, the national government 
agency created in 1988 to enforce environmental 
protection laws, still does not have the constitutional 
authority to carry out all-union compliance. 
of the bureaucratic wrangling, enforcement of exist-
ing environmental protection laws is weak, and addi-
tional empowering legislation languishes in the Ecolo-
gy Committee. 
Moscow also has failed to provide the economic 
incentives needed to motivate republics and industrial 
enterprises to clean up the environment. For example,

although the Soviets allocated only an estimated 
1 percent of GNP to environmental protection, the 
ministries and republics have been spending only 
about half to two-thirds of the funds they are granted. 
The Council of Ministers took a step in the right 
9 
direction recently by creating Ekoprom�a consor-
tium to produce ecologically mandated equipment. 
The Council hopes a proposed tax system that imposes 
large fines on polluters will encourage enterprises to 
buy such equipment. Moscow, however, would have to 
strengthen enforcement capabilities if it expects the 
legislation to be effective. 
Moscow's foot-dragging on environmental protection 
issues, to some extent, may be deliberate. Gorbachev 
probably views sporadic plant closings as a short-term 
way of dealing with environmental problems, with a 
cost less expensive than that of undertaking a com-
plete industrial cleanup. The longer he delays in 
taking the necessary steps to modernize existing 
plants, however, the greater risk he runs that addi-
tional unplanned closings will occur, lowering output 
still more and further worsening shortages of industri-
al and consumer goods.

Taiwan: Economic Considerations 
Outweighing Environmental Concerns 
Taiwan's growing pollution problems stem mainly 
from the government's "growth at any cost" economic 
policies over the past four decades. Popular support 
for cleaning up the environment has increased in 
recent years; the issue played a role in last Decem-
ber's legislative elections. Nevertheless, environmen-
talists face an uphill battle because of Taipei's con-
cern about the current slowdown in economic growth. 
Moreover, the government's plans to push ahead with 
several industrial projects to alleviate domestic short-
ages suggest that the environmental situation is likely 
to become even worse. We believe the issue will 
remain politically contentious, but environmental 
cleanup is unlikely to become a major part of Taipei's 
industrial policy, at least in the near term. 
Pollution on the Rise 
Although a dearth of information makes it difficult to 
assess the extent of Taiwan's pollution problem, it is 
becoming increasingly clear that pollution has become 
a serious problem over the past decade: 
� International environmental experts estimate that 
Taiwan produces at least 60,000 metric tons of 
industrial waste daily, which would rank it third�
behind Poland and Czechoslovakia�in the amount 
of waste produced per square kilometer, according 
to recent OECD statistics. 
� The island produces some 5,700 tons of sludge 
daily-40 percent of which is contaminated with 
pesticide residues and heavy metals. 
� According to press reports, more than half of 
Taiwan's pesticide factories do not use advanced 
pollution control technology�such as incinera-
tors�and fail to meet the Taiwan Environmental 
Protection Agency's (TEPA) ' air and water emis-
sion standards, which are more lax than their US 
counterparts. 
� Water pollution helped lower Taiwan's inland fish-
eries production by approximately 80,000 tons�
some 23 percent�during the 1980s. According to 
press reports, three of Taiwan's 15 rivers no longer 
contain any fish, except for very short stretches. 
Government Policies Largely to Blame 
Taiwan's "growth at any cost" economic development 
policies over the past 40 years and, to a lesser extent, 
the growing wealth of its citizens are largely responsi-
ble for the increase in pollution: 
� The government has encouraged domestic and for-
eign investment in "dirty industries," such as petro-
chemicals, pesticides, paper production, and leather 
tanning. For example, investment in such industries 
during the 1980s accounted for nearly 30 percent of 
total investment, with the chemical industry alone 
absorbing nearly 20 percent. 
� Taipei has done little to stem the growth of illegal 
factories. Roughly a third of Taiwan's estimated 
90,000 factories are not registered and thus are 
ineligible to take part in any government-assisted 
cleanup programs. 
'The cabinet-level TEPA was established in August 1987, replac-
ing the Bureau of Environmental Protection, which was under the 
Department of Health. TEPA employs more than 900 enforcement 
officers, and its budget for 1990 is approximately $360 million. (u)

Taiwan's Major Pollutants 
Inert and semi-inert substances include the nonbiode-
gradeable plastics, glass, and metal found in ordinary 
garbage. Taiwan's average daily output of household 
waste has increased 8 to 10 percent annually since the 
early 1980s, according to press reports, reaching over 
17,000 tons a day and bringing per capita garbage 
output close to the 2- to 4-pounds-per-day level of 
developed nations. A particular problem is the 250-
million plastic soda bottles Taiwan consumes annu-
ally, which, since becoming popular in the mid-I980s, 
have been blocking drainage systems and causing 
flooding in large cities.   
Biologically active wastes, such as food wastes, pa-
per, fertilizers, human and animal bodily wastes, 
often cause health problems. Only 2 percent of 
Taiwan's 20 million people receive sewer service, and 
less than 3 percent of Taiwan's human and animal 
sewage, which flows directly into groundwater, rivers, 
and the sea, is treated. As a result, approximately 
20 percent of Taiwan's population is infected with 
hepatitis B, the highest rate in the world, according to 
press reports. Hepatitis B causes approximately 85 
percent of Taiwan's cases of cirrhosis and cancer of 
the liver and causes some 4,000 deaths annually. 
Hazardous wastes include caustic chemicals, pesti-
cides, radioactive wastes, heavy metals, and a range 
of other substances used or produced by industry, 
agriculture, or people. The Taiwan Environmental 
Protection Agency (TEPA) lists 13 of Taiwan's 21 
rivers as heavily polluted, and eight others as lightly 
to moderately polluted. According to press reports, 
only 15 percent of Taiwan's groundwater supply is 
safe to drink. 
Atmospheric emissions consisting of gases, such as 
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and chloroflurocar-
bons, are produced by motor vehicles, factories, and 
aerosols. Some of the island's worst air pollution 
occurs in the Kaohsiung region because of its heavy 
concentration of petrochemical, cement, steel, and 
paper-processing facilities. Fifty-six percent of all air 
quality warnings in Taiwan in the first 10 months of 
1989 were issued in the Kaohsiung region. The TEPA 
issues warnings only when a given monitoring station 
records a pollution standard index (PSI) rating over 
200 or when weather in an area prevents speedy air 
diffusion; international standards rate PSIs under 50 
to be light, between 50 and 100 to be moderate, 
between 100 and 150 to be high, and PSIs over 150 to 
be medically dangerous. 
� The government's ambitious highway construction 
program has opened Taiwan's mountain interior and 
less congested west coast to illegal logging and 
waste dumping. The program also has encouraged 
auto ownership. 
� Taipei's rural industrialization policy�aimed at 
balancing regional development and discouraging 
emigration to overcrowded cities�has spread pol-
luting industries across the island and prevented 
centralization of waste treatment and recycling 
facilities. For example, Taipei's plan to ease 
Taiwan's severe shortage of industrial land by con-
structing its first offshore industrial zone on an 
undeveloped island near Yunlin County in south-
eastern Taiwan will introduce heavily polluting in-
dustries, such as petroleum processing. 
Seeret 
� Government regulations require the government-
owned Taiwan Power Company (Taipower)�a 
major polluter�to purchase locally produced coal, 
although it generates more smoke and sulfur than 
imports. Environmentalists and fishermen also 
charge Taipower with destroying aquatic life by 
dumping hot water from power plants into lakes and 
the sea. 
� The island's economic success, which has more than 
doubled annual per capital income over the past five 
years to about $7,500, has launched a buying spree 
that has played a significant role in Taiwan's pollu-
tion problems. Taiwan now has 2 million cars and 
7 million motorcycles�and the island is importing

more than 10,000 automobiles per month. Accord-
ing to press reports, Taipei's traffic density is 10 
times greater than that of Los Angeles. Taiwan's 
lack of an adequate public transportation system 
compounds the problem; major portions of the is-
land's $16 billion subway system are 10 years 
behind schedule. 
Despite Growing Support for the Environment... 
Public anger over the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT)�
or Nationalist Party's�failure to deal with pollution 
has risen in recent years. Indeed, environmental is-
sues, along with a host of other social problems, are 
sparking almost daily protests. According to Taiwan 
media surveys, 20 percent of the demonstrations held 
since the lifting of martial law in 1987, which legal-
ized open dissent, were linked to the environment; 
some 400 antipollution protests were staged between 
October 1988 and November 1989. Although the 
majority of these demonstrations are loosely orga-
nized outbursts over local issues�such as gas leaks, 
damage to fisheries, or the construction of new fac-
tories�concern over the environment helped reduce 
the KMT's share of the vote in last December's 
legislative elections to below 70 percent for the first 
time, according to the American Institute in Taiwan 
(AIT). Meanwhile, the victories of several Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) candidates�the major oppo-
sition party�stemmed in part to the party's pledges 
to prevent construction of environmentally controver-
sial projects such as a fifth naptha cracking plant and 
a fourth nuclear power plant.' 
... Environmentalists Face An Uphill Struggle 
Despite the groundswell of popular support, rising 
public demands for reform of Taiwan's outdated 
legislative system and jockeying for power within the 
'China Petroleum Corporation's fifth naptha cracking plant�
naptha is a petroleum product used in producing solvents, petro-
chemicals, and synthetic natural gas�and Taipower's fourth nucle-
ar power plant have met with stiff opposition and sometimes violent 
protests from residents of the areas in which they are scheduled to 
be built. These protests have delayed the government's plan to 
construct the facilities from the middle-to-late 1980s. (u) 
13 
KMT are preoccupying the leadership and pushing 
the environment onto a back burner. Moreover, recent 
changes in the government's leadership mean an 
especially tough battle for environmentalists. In his 
first interview after being appointed premier in May, 
Hao Po-ts'un pledged to push ahead with the con-
struction of several major projects�presumably the 
fifth naptha cracking plant, the fourth nuclear power 
plant, and the DuPont titanium dioxide complex �
that! have been delayed by environmental protests and 
to prevent such demonstrations from interfering with 
economic development. In addition, according to press 
reports, newly appointed Defense Minister Chen 
Li-an is an outspoken supporter of the progrowth 
philosophy and believes all environmental motivated 
protesters are seeking to blackmail government and 
private corporations rather than improve the environ-
ment. Although he has called on firms to give greater 
priority to controlling pollution, Chen and other KMT 
officials have threatened to use the military police to 
reopen factories during several prolonged protests. 
Even before these appointments, however, the depth 
of official support for environmental cleanup was 
questionable. In May 1989, for example, Taiwan's 
legislature cut TEPA's budget by some 5 percent�
$28: million�claiming that the Agency performed 
poorly. Meanwhile, other government agencies have 
opposed TEPA's enforcement of environmental pro-
tection laws. The Taiwan Board of Health, for exam-
ple, so far has successfully opposed TEPA's efforts to 
press hospitals to dispose of medical waste properly. 
According to press reports, the Industrial Develop-
ment Bureau (IDB)�which represents industry's in-
terests in government economic planning and admin-
isters the special economic zones�last year refused to 
pay a TEPA fine for illegally discharging hot water 
from one of its waste water treatment facilities and, 
subsequently, won a court case brought against it by 
the TEPA.

Secret 
Taipei's Cleanup Program: A Paper Tiger? 
During the past three years, Taipei has announced a 
number of ambitious plans it hopes will significantly 
reduce pollution by the year 2000. Although we 
harbor serious doubts about senior Taipei officials' 
commitment to many cleanup programs, TEPA direc-
tor Eugene Chien claims Taipei and the private sector 
will spend approximately $40 billion over the next 
decade to improve Taiwan's environment. The gov-
ernment is also considering new environmental pro-
tection regulations and incentive packages�including 
tax breaks and low interest loans�to encourage 
businesses to import antipollution equipment: 
� In an effort to strengthen Taiwan's antipollution 
legislation, the TEPA is drafting 60 new and 
amended laws and regulations. Although the TEPA 
will begin submitting the new measures to the 
Executive Yuan�Taiwan's cabinet�early next 
year, press reporting indicates they are unlikely to 
go into effect before 1993. 
� TEPA and Taipower are working on a plan to cut 
off electricity supplies to serious polluters because 
many ignore TEPA fines or bribe officials to look 
the other way. .1.1. Taipower cooperates fully, this 
program could become TEPA 's most important 
weapon against polluters because, according to 
press reports, the fines issued by the TEPA�$40 
million last year, double the 1988 figure�failed to 
deter polluters who accept them as a cost of doing 
business. According to AIT reporting, many corpo-
rations routinely budget funds for fines imposed for 
violating pollution regulations or refuse to pay fines 
because the TEPA has little enforcement authority. 
� To help reduce air pollution, Taiwan required 
catalytic converters on all domestic and imported 
cars beginning this year. 
The antipollution drive also has been hampered by 
overlapping authority and bureaucratic infighting be-
tween the various government agencies responsible for 
overseeing cleanup operations. For example, jurisdic-
tional ambiguities among the TEPA, the Defense 
Ministry, and the Communications Ministry delayed 
action for several days last April when a storm-
damaged freighter dumped more than 1,300 barrels 
of oil onto Taiwan's north coast. Currently, a dispute 
between the TEPA and the IDB over the number of 
factories Taiwan's first toxic waste disposal facility 
will serve is delaying construction of the facility. 
Environmentalists also face a formidable opponent in 
Taiwan's business community, which has argued the 
government should focus more attention on economic 
growth and less on environmental concerns. Industries 
point to Taiwan's economic slowdown over the past 
two years�industrial production grew by only 
4.1 percent annually during the 1988-89 period com-
pared with 13.9 percent in 1987, according to press 
reports�as proof that environmental protests and 
stricter government pollution standards are harming 
the economy. In particular, businessmen claim: 
� Environmental protests are partially responsible for 
domestic and foreign companies postponing or can-
celing investments.4 They point to Taiwan authori-
ties' willingness to give into environmentalists' de-
mands at the Linyuan petrochemical zone protest in 
1988 and the decision by Formosa Plastics�
Taiwan's largest private corporation�to suspend 
investment in Taiwan because of opposition to the 
firm's plans to build a petrochemical plant on the 
island. 
The Linyuan incident, Taiwan's first major environmental protest, 
was staged in October 1988 by local residents angered by heavy soil 
and water pollution caused by the zone's 18 petrochemical facili-
ties. To stop the protest and reopen the zone�which produces 75 
percent of Taiwan's petrochemicals and supplies more than 30,000 
secondary factories�government authorities awarded Linyuan res-
idents $45 million. Taipei then demanded that the Linyuan plants 
finance the compensation fund, a move that sparked a series of 
copycat demonstrations during the first half of 1989 that were 
largely motivated by hopes of similar settlements, according to AIT 
reporting.

Secret 
Exporting Pollution: The Case of Formosa Plastics 
Formosa Plastics is moving forward on a deal to 
construct a $3.5 billion industrial complex in Xiamen 
Special Industrial Zone in China, according to the 
US Consulate in Guangzhou, because Taiwan envi-
ronmentalists prevented such construction on the 
island. The complex, which would roughly triple the 
dollar value of Taiwan's mainland holdings, is ex-
pected to include a naptha cracking plant and related 
factories producing plastics and raw materials for 
synthetic fibers. Industry specialists estimate that 
total investment could reach $7 billion once second-
ary apparel, toy, and electronics-manufacturing facil-
ities are added. Increasingly eager to attract Taiwan 
investment as Western investors look to Eastern 
Europe and Southeast Asia, Chinese authorities are 
offering Formosa Plastics a number of incentives, 
including the use of roughly 100 square kilometers of 
land, $1.2 billion in transportation and communica-
tions upgrades, and more than $210 million in financ-
ing, according to US Embassy reporting. The project, 
however, faces several obstacles. Taipei officially 
bans investment on the mainland, and, although the 
ban has not been enforced, the high visibility of this 
project is causing concern among Taiwan authorities, 
who believe it would open the floodgates of large-
scale investment, further binding Taiwan's economy 
to the mainland. 
� The cost of pollution control equipment and plant 
startups delayed by environmental protests have 
helped push a number of industries offshore. 
(Taiwan's direct overseas investment in 1989 was 
more than $7 billion�equivalent to 5 percent of 
GNP�and is expected to reach $11 billion in 1990.) 
Even state-owned firms�such as China Steel Cor-
poration�are looking to build new facilities over-
seas because of antipollution protests against its 
construction plans. While China Steel is examining 
sites in Australia, Malaysia, and Canada for an 
$80 million factory capable of producing more than 
3 million tons of steel annually, Taiwan is relying 
increasingly on steel imports from South Korea and 
Japan�nearly 3 million tons in 1989�to meet 
domestic demand. 
15 
Little Relief in Sight 
Despite the growing public support for environmental 
protection, we believe concern over the economy 
makes it unlikely the government will take the neces-
sary steps to significantly curtail pollution. Indeed, 
barring a major environmental accident�such as an 
explosion at a petrochemical complex or the release of 
a significant quantity of radioactive material from a 
nuclear plant�Taipei is likely to make several deci-
sions in the coming years that will risk further 
damage to the environment: 
� Growing power shortages are likely to convince 
Taipei to move ahead on plans to build a third oil 
refinery. Environmentalists have delayed construc-
tion of the facility since 1988, but, with Taiwan's 
two plants falling short of daily consumption by 
70,000 barrels and government officials anticipating 
serious shortages of gasoline, low-sulfur fuel oil, and 
liquefied petroleum gas by the mid-1990s, construc-
tion is likely. 
� The Ministry of Economic Affairs is vowing to 
begin construction of a $5 billion, 2,000 megawatt 
fourth nuclear power plant next year, despite strong 
opposition from Taipei County residents and the 
DPP. Environmentalist are worried about 
Taipower's poor nuclear safety record. 
� 
The government is likely to move forward on the 
construction of a fifth naptha cracking plant. Tai-
wan authorities probably believe they must act 
quickly to avoid greater shortages of ethylene, 
which would cripple the island's petrochemical, and 
related industries. These industries account for 
37 percent  of Taiwan's gross national product. 
If economic growth rises, the government will proba-
bly focus more on environmental protection but is 
unlikely, in our judgment, to make it a major part of 
Taiwan's industrial policy, at least in the near term. 
In any event, environment issues are likely to remain 
contentious and to continue to play a political role�
particularly at the local level.

East European economic reform will gradually build 
pressure for reform of the European Community's 
protectionist Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), 
they are unlikely to significantly alter the EC's 
resistance to rapid liberalization of agricultural trade 
in the GATT Uruguay Round. In the near term, the 
CAP can readily accommodate East Germany be-
cause an increase in demand for food in the GDR is 
expected to exceed any rise in GDR agricultural 
output. By the mid-1990s, however, we believe rising 
East German farm output will increase CAP spending 
at a time when the EC will probably have to deal with 
mounting surpluses of such commodities as grain. 
Moreover, Eastern Europe's likely shift from a net 
food importer to a net exporter by the end of the 
decade will probably add to the CAP's subsidy costs 
by pushing down global food prices. Although budget 
constraints are likely to increase the likelihood of 
dramatic cutbacks in EC agricultural subsidies, mem-
ber-states are likely to demand some continued pro-
tection of agriculture. As a result, the Community 
may contemplate other policies troublesome to the 
United States, such as indirectly reducing US exports 
to the EC market by granting East European products 
wider access. 
Limited Impact in the Near Term but ... 
Over the next year or two, we expect continued 
German integration to provide more opportunities than 
problems for Western farmers. East Germany's de-
mand for more varied and better quality food products 
almost certainly will rise as economic recovery pro-
gresses, with the growth in demand likely to outpace 
the country's agriculture production. As a result, the 
imbalance is likely to create greater sales possibilities 
for European and US food producers and widen the 
GDR's $1.2 billion deficit in agricultural trade�
already one of the highest in Eastern Europe.

East European Food Exports: 
Knocking on the EC's Door 
East European countries view agriculture as an im-
portant sector of their economies and will emphasize 
it in their reform programs. Food production ac-
counts for about 20 percent of the region's GNP and 
employs nearly 22 percent of the labor force. This 
compares with 2.3 percent of GDP and 8 percent of 
the labor force for the EC. Moreover, exports of food 
and raw agricultural products have been both a 
major earner of hard currency on Western markets 
and important in barter trade with the USSR to 
acquire energy and raw materials. 
The East Europeans are pressing for increased access 
to the EC market�particularly in meat, dairy, and 
grains�in order to earn badly needed hard currency 
to modernize their economies. A Hungarian economic 
official, for example, has expressed concerns over EC 
protectionist tendencies, arguing that the EC needs to 
open its agricultural markets and abandon its agri-
culture subsidies if it is serious about aiding the 
East. The EC has always been a key market for East 
European agricultural goods, taking about a third of 
the region's agricultural exports. In fact, Eastern 
Europe is a net exporter of foodstuffs to the Commu-
nity despite protectionist EC policies, such as quotas 
on East European beef that were imposed in 1974. 
The EC probably realizes that it will have to make 
concessions to Eastern Europe in agriculture or face 
the anomaly of supporting liberalizing economic re-
forms in the East European countries while still 
protecting the EC's own highly managed agricultural 
system. In our view, the EC is likely to grant the East 
Europeans "controlled access" to its agriculture mar-
ket. Potential East European food exports are in 
sensitive EC sectors, and the Community is likely to 
negotiate new voluntary restraint-type agreements 
with the individual East European countries or ex-
pand existing quotas. These would most likely be in 
meat and dairy products, along with some grains. It 
already has increased the beef quotas granted to 
Hungary, Romania, Poland, and Yugoslavia and 
suspended import levies for sheep and goat meat for 
all the East European countries except Romania. 
The EC is likely to be generous when deciding how to 
adjust existing production quotas on dairy products 
and grain to take account of the GDR's entry, in part 
to avoid antagonizing Bonn at a time when most 
Europeans want to "anchor" Germany more firmly in 
the Community. In addition, with Europe's famous 
butter-and-cheese mountains now virtually eliminat-
ed, the EC has more leeway in raising its milk quota 
to accommodate most East German milk produc-
tion�currently equivalent to an estimated 8 percent 
of EC production. The EC also will probably have 
little trouble expanding the Community's grain pro-
duction limit by some 6-7 percent because the GDR 
at present is a large net grain importer. The Commu-
nity, however, is unlikely to agree to any West 
German demands to suspend the rules mandating 
automatic price cuts if the new production limits are 
breached. Offsetting these increased costs will be the 
likely expanded sales to the GDR of EC surplus 
products such as fruit, vegetables, and wine. 
. . . Competitive Challenge Expected Eventually 
By the mid-1990s, East German agriculture may pose 
a major competitive challenge to West German farm-
ers. West German agricultural specialists note that 
parts of the GDR were once considered the "granary 
of Germany" and that some of its land is still the most 
productive in Germany. More important, the econo-
mies of scale made possible by East Germany's large 
farm cooperatives confer significant advantages. Al-
though many of the collectives' component farms are

likely to be reprivatized as part of the reform effort in 
the GDR, we expect East German farms to remain 
much larger than those in West Germany. 
In light of economic reforms and modernization ac-
companying unification of the two Germanys, the 
GDR could increase its agricultural output 20 to 30 
percent by the middle of the decade because: 
� Market-determined prices will strengthen incentives 
for the production of goods in which East Germany 
is most efficient. 
� Western know-how will improve crop yields, which 
currently are roughly 20 percent below West Ger-
man levels. 
� Investments in transportation, storage, and distribu-
tion systems will remove bottlenecks that currently 
limit production and keep costs high. 
Embassy reporting, however, indicates that some East 
German officials are less optimistic and that they 
believe the emphasis being placed on the environment 
may limit GDR yield increases-or take land out of 
production-and dampen the anticipated competitive 
challenge.

If, as we expect, East Germany's agricultural output 
significantly exceeds the GDR's demand for food by 
the mid-to-late 1990s, a sharp rise in CAP spending is 
likely. Surpluses in commodities such as grain would 
grow, forcing the EC to spend larger sums to subsi-
dize exports-if still permissible under post-
GATT-Uruguay Round rules-or store the excess.' 
The size of the increase in CAP outlays will depend 
on world agricultural prices and the health of EC 
economies. The greater the decline in world food 
prices, the more untentable high EC support prices 
are in the face of rising surpluses. Increases in outlays 
for the CAP are restricted to 74 percent of the 
Community's GNP growth rate. 
A similar transformation of other East European 
countries into substantial agricultural exporters would 
add to the pressure on the CAP-by lowering world 
prices-even if the EC does not open its doors to 
Eastern agricultural products.

EC Agriculture Policy and the Uruguay Round 
Movement toward German unification is unlikely to 
have a significant impact on the EC's hardline posi-
tion on agriculture in the GATT Uruguay Round 
talks. The EC already has submitted its proposal for 
the talks, which are scheduled to end in December. 
The EC is pushing a minimalist "global approach" 
that would entail "rebalancing," a concept that would 
allow raising protection on some products while 
lowering it on others, as long as the overall level of 
protection is reduced: 
� The EC advocates a progressive reduction in do-
mestic support for farmers over five years with the 
goal left undefined, rejecting the US call for the 
elimination within 10 years of these subsidies. 
� Brussels, adamantly rejecting the US proposal for 
eliminating export subsidies, urges instead that 
they only be reduced in line with cuts in import 
levies. 
� The EC accepts only in part the US concept of 
"tariffication," a process that would convert all 
nontariff barriers to tariffs and then reduce them 
to near zero, but would permit a "corrective factor" 
to be added to allow tariffs to counteract 
changes in exchange rates and world market prices. 
In addition, Brussels has tied partial "tariffication" 
to acceptance of "rebalancing." 
The Community feels it already has made a major 
concession by accepting partial tariffication and ap-
pears to hope that a delay in serious talks at least 
until September will prompt concessions from GATT 
members concerned about meeting the December 
deadline for concluding the round. Indeed, the Kohl 
government is facing national elections in December 
and is loath to antagonize the crucial farm vote by 
making sweeping concessions. While the EC may be 
reluctant to make major concessions because of the 
uncertainty of incorporating the GDR into the CAP, 
we believe the Community still places a high value on 
successfully completing the GATT talks and will give 
them the high-level political attention necessary to 
make last-minute concessions when negotiations en-
ter the homestretch. 
According to a recent USDA study, the region has the 
capability to become self-sufficient in most foods and 
to become a substantial overall net exporter of agri-
cultural products by the end of the decade. For 
example, should the region close its agricultural pro-
ductivity gap with the West by half, it would become 
a net grain exporter, according to USDA 
Additional Pressures for CAP Reform 
In addition to growing agricultural surpluses, other 
factors are likely to sow the seeds for CAP reform 
during the last half of the decade. Unification is likely 
to shift the regional balance of power within Germa-
ny, changing Bonn's traditional opposition to agricul-
tural reform. At present, West German policy is 
shaped by the politically influential south�Bavarians 
Secret 
have held the Agriculture Ministry for over 20 
years�rather than the more efficient north. The 
addition of more efficient farmers in eastern Germany 
will eventually dilute Bavaria's influence on agricul-
tural policy and probably tip the balance in favor of 
greater market liberalization. Assuming northern 
Germany shares in the economic boom unification is 
expected to bring, northern farmers are likely to find 
common cause with their eastern counterparts and be 
more supportive of a more market-oriented agricul-
ture regime. 
Other Community members are also likely to view 
more favorably fundamental reform of the CAP�
that is, increased production quotas, and virtual elimi-
nation of the dual-price system�by the end of the 
decade. Indeed, Paris�a frequent hardliner�already 
20 
Approved for Release: 2018/08/22 C06280539 
Approved for Release: 2018/08/22 C06280539 
Seerct 
is indicating that it believes French grains are com-
petitive in a free market and occasionally espouses 
making the CAP more market oriented. Other factors 
will probably work to weaken political support for 
subsidization of agriculture in Europe: 
� Concerns over the environmental effects of agricul-
tural overproduction are likely to grow in coming 
years, pushing the EC to implement reforms that 
would reduce its agricultural surpluses. 
� Demographic trends�especially the expected re-
tirement of the majority of farmers during the next 
decade in both Germany and France�will reduce 
the farm lobby's political influence 
Even with reform of the CAP, the EC likely will 
remain committed to some protection for agriculture, 
as evidenced by its hardline position at the GATT 
Uruguay Round negotiations. Over the next several 
years, as the scope of Eastern Europe's challenge to 
21 
the CAP and world agriculture trade becomes clearer, 
we expect the EC to discuss options ranging from 
retargeting subsidy policies to market-sharing ar-
rangements. Community agricultural policy may 
move closer to US preferences, such as the EC ending 
its resistance to the US-favored idea of substituting 
direct income supports to farmers for price supports. 
US exports to Western Europe could face major 
obstacles, however, if the West German Government 
gives in to growing political pressure to limit the 
access of US agricultural products to the Communi-
ty--particularly soybeans and nongrain feedstuffs. 
Bolin presumably would try to persuade its EC part-
ners1 that such limits on US exports is an acceptable 
pride for reform of CAP subsidy mechanisms.

China: Seeking GATT Membership 
Beijing's desire to become a full member of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has 
increased in light of the recent changes in Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union and of China's need to 
boost exports because of poor prospects for foreign 
investment and tourism earnings. But China's case for 
GATT membership as an LDC on the basis of 
promised economic reforms has been weakened by 
Beijing's backtracking on decentralization and trade 
reforms. In any event, Chinese accession to GATT, in 
addition to raising a number of thorny issues such as 
Soviet and East European membership, would proba-
bly accelerate the growth of Chinese exports to the 
United States but would have little impact on US 
sales. As a result, China's bilateral trade surplus 
would grow at a faster pace and economic frictions 
would intensify. 
Membership Becoming Increasingly Important 
Beijing's sense of urgency that GATT members ap-
prove China's application for membership has grown 
this year because of: 
� Taiwan's application for GATT membership in 
early January. 
� Chinese fears that many Western nations will begin 
to consider China less important as a result of recent 
changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. 
� The need to promote exports has become more 
pressing as hard currency earnings from tourism 
have plummeted and prospects for foreign invest-
ment have dimmed following the crackdown last 
June on prodemocracy demonstrators 
GATT membership would provide several tangible 
economic benefits to China that observer status�
granted to China in 1985�does not. For example, 
membership provides China unconditional most-fa-
vored-nation trading status from other GATT 
23 
(b)(3) 
members, except those that opt to decline to apply 
GATT principles to their trade with China at the time 
of Beijing's accession. In addition, GATT membership 
would give Beijing recourse to the GATT's dispute 
settlement provisions to protect China from unfair 
adjudication of complaints by its trade partners. 
(b)(3) 
Key Stumblingblock: Applying as an LDC 
Beijing's insistence that it be admitted to the GATT 
as a less developed country (LDC) rather than as a 
nonmarket economy is a major impediment to China's 
accession. Since applying for membership in 1986, 
Beijing has argued that it is moving toward a market-
oriented economy and thus should be admitted as an 
LDC. This claim, however, has been undercut over (b)(3) 
the past two years as China has increasingly resorted 
to central plans and administrative measures�such 
as price controls and import licenses�to rein in 
inflation and halt a deterioration in China's trade 
balal nce. Moreover, China's economic problems and 
its weak and divided leadership are likely to prevent 
Beijing from undertaking any major economic reform 
initiatives in the near term. 
Almost certainly aware that its case for GATT 
membership on the basis of promised economic re-
forms has been weakened, Beijing is likely to increas-
ingly justify accession on foreign policy consider-
ations, arguing that the way Western nations treat 
China's GATT application is a test of their commit-
ment to China's full participation in the global eco-
nomic system. In addition, Beijing may try to over-
come resistance to its membership by offering other 
major Western members minor concessions similar to 
those extended to the United States. For example, 
Beijing is likely to offer to discuss more freely the 
policies and regulatory mechanisms that govern 
China's foreign trade regime�a key sticking point in 
the GATT negotiations thus far. In mid-January, 
Beijing authorized such discussions with a group from 
the US Embassy.

cla 
Implications of Acceding as an LDC 
LDC status would permit Beijing to use high tariffs 
and quantitative import restrictions to protect infant 
domestic industries or to reverse balance-of-payments 
difficulties. GATT membership as a nonmarket econ-
omy, however, carries stringent obligations. For ex-
ample, it generally enables other GATT members to 
retain quotas and other nontariff barriers on imports 
from the nonmarket economy to protect them from a 
flood of exports at state-set, often subsidized, prices. 
The issue is crucial to GATT members because 
China is the first predominantly state-controlled 
economy with a huge export potential to apply for 
membership under the preferential terms accorded 
less developed economies. Many GATT members fear 
China's accession as an LDC would significantly 
increase its access to foreign markets; China's ex-
ports have grown at a 13-percent average annual rate 
since 1980, a rate matched during the period only by 
Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, among major 
exporters. In addition, GATT members are concerned 
that the reduction of Chinese tariff rates, the normal 
requirement for LDCs acceding to the GATT, would 
not meaningfully improve their access to the Chinese 
market because central plans and administrative 
measures�rather than markets, prices, and duties�
largely determine the volume and composition of 
Chinese imports. 
Beijing also may reiterate its willingness to accept 
"temporary safeguards" as a condition of GATT 
membership; this would allow GATT members to 
treat China as a nonmarket economy initially and 
hold out the promise of full LDC privileges if Beijing 
makes substantial progress on reforms. Chinese trade 
officials objected to such "temporary safeguards" 
when US negotiators raised the possibility several 
years ago, but during bilateral talks in May 1989, 
officials agreed to incorporate these provisions in a 
draft protocol of accession to be considered by the 
GATT working party on China. 
--Secrisr 
Membership Likely To Raise Thorny Issues 
Chinese accession to the GATT would set a precedent 
for Soviet membership in the GATT and would lend 
credibility to efforts by East European countries such 
as Poland and Hungary to renegotiate the terms of 
their GATT membership on the basis of economic 
reforms they have undertaken recently. If China is 
granted GATT membership even though it has moved 
away from market-oriented reforms, Moscow almost 
certainly would argue it should be granted similar 
treatment; Moscow's application for GATT observer 
status was recently accepted. The incorporation of a 
large nonmarket economy such as China's on the 
basis of its promises to undertake further reforms 
would make it difficult for GATT members to turn 
down a Soviet bid�even if Moscow were to request 
special treatment as a reforming, rather than a non-
market economy. 
China's early accession also would complicate resolu-
tion of Taiwan's GATT application. If Beijing ac-
cedes to the GATT first, it would most likely support 
Taiwan's accession only if Taipei agreed to member-
ship as a customs territory under the governing 
authority of Beijing, which we believe Taiwan would 
be unwilling to do. Both Beijing and Taipei will expect 
the United States to take the lead in resolving these 
differences, and their lobbying efforts are likely to 
escalate this year. 
Limited Leverage for the United States... 
We do not believe granting GATT membership to 
China would markedly influence Beijing to implement 
further economic reforms. China's leaders are cur-
rently constrained by the country's economic difficul-
ties, particularly by the fear that�as in 1988�a new 
round of price reforms would release inflationary 
pressures and that decontrol of the trade sector would 
cause imports to balloon. The direction of economic 
policy in China, in our judgment, will largely be 
determined by the jockeying for position to succeed 
Deng Xiaoping as China's paramount leader. 
24 
Approved for Release: 2018/08/22 C06280539 
Approved for Release: 2018/08/22 C06280539 
In addition, Chinese membership in the GATT is 
unlikely to substantially improve US sales to China 
even if China reduced administrative barriers to 
imports and made dramatic progress on its trade and 
price reforms�a prospect we consider remote over 
the next few years. Foreign exchange will probably 
remain tight because of lower earnings from tourism 
and foreign investment, combined with the reluctance 
of China's orthodox leaders to take on more foreign 
debt. Growth in US exports to China in recent years 
has generally reflected gains in sales of wheat and 
agricultural chemicals�sales that are more influ-
enced by trends in Chinese agricultural production 
than by trade barriers. In addition, US sales of 
machinery, which have languished for several years, 
will probably continue to stagnate because China's 
sluggish domestic economy has depressed demand for 
industrial equipment and because the resumption of 
export credits by Japan and the European Community 
will reduce the United States' ability to compete. 
... And Formidable Challenges 
By facilitating Chinese efforts to boost exports to the 
United States, however, Chinese membership in the 
GATT could enable China's trade surplus with the 
United States to burgeon.' US Commerce Depart-
ment statistics indicate that China's bilateral trade 
surplus jumped nearly 70 percent in 1989 to about 
$7 billion, and, even without GATT membership, 
China's surplus could exceed $10 billion this year. We 
believe the surplus could grow even more rapidly if 
Chinese membership in the GATT gives Beijing more 
clout in efforts by textile exporters to eliminate the 
global quota system on textiles�the Multifibre Ar-
rangement�that, under a GATT waiver, now permits 
'We anticipate that even without GATT membership, China's 
exports to the United States may continue to average more than 30-
percent annual growth over the next few years. Beijing will 
probably achieve this rapid export growth by continuing to move 
into higher-value export product lines, boosting credit to the export 
sector, and directing scarce raw materials to export-producing 
factories. Targeting of the US market and continued growth in US 
demand for the products China exports will probably enable 
China's exports to the United States to grow two or three times as 
fast as its overall exports, continuing the pattern of the last decade. 
25 
China: Targeting the US Market 
The United States last year became China's primary 
export market, and Beijing has targeted the United 
States for rapid export growth in the 1990s. In the 
coming decade, Beijing plans to focus on the US 
market for sales of machinery and consumer elec-
tronics; China has invested heavily in these sectors 
with an eye to boosting export earnings, and, accord-
ing to diplomatic reporting, has found it much easier 
to sell these products to the United States than to the 
more heavily protected markets in Japan and West-
ern Europe. China's exports of labor-intensive manu-
factured goods such as televisions, radios, toys, foot-
wear, hand tools, and household electrical appliances 
are likely to grow most rapidly, in our view, because 
China's low wages give it a comparative advantage 
relative to producers in countries with higher labor 
costs and because foreign as well as domestic invest-
ment has been concentrated in these sectors.

the United States and the European Community to 
impose volume quotas on textile imports. Such a move 
would probably cause China's clothing exports to the 
United States to accelerate; they currently account 
for roughly one-fourth of China's sales to the US 
market. 
In addition, if the United States wishes to apply the 
GATT to China, it must grant Beijing unconditional 
most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status.' Such a 
move would require a Congressional amendment to 
the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 
1974, which withholds MFN status to nonmarket 
economies except through annual waivers by the 
President. If the United States fails to apply the 
'Article 35 of the General Agreement permits members to decline 
to accord new members GATT privileges�including most-favored-
nation trading status�at the time of accession provided that the

tions.

other GATT members would have to decide when to 
eliminate the interim measures. They would need to 
continually reevaluate China's trade system to deter-
mine when market forces had developed to the point 
where tariffs were sufficient to regulate trade with 
China. The reassessment process would be contentious 
and prolonged because the stakes are high for both 
sides. If Beijing cannot shed the safeguards, GATT 
membership would do little to improve China's access 
to foreign markets. If, on the other hand, GATT 
Civ 
members agreed to drop the safeguards before market 
forces played a predominant role in the Chinese 
economy, the Chinese market would remain largely 
closed to their products, and they could be subjected 
to Chinese targeting of their markets with state-
subsidized products. We believe that China would 
apply enormous bilateral pressure for the removal of 
safeguards because Beijing regards US support as 
critical to making headway within the GATT.

International Financial Situation: 
Update on LDC Debt 
Developments this week focus on Mexico, Egypt, and G-15 Summit issues: 
L 
Mexico City Anticipates Reprivatization of Commercial Banks. Mexico City 
expects a majority of the state legislatures to approve the constitutional 
amendment to begin reprivatizing commercial banks by the end of this summer. 
the first two banks to be put 
on the auction block will be Banca Serfin and Banorte� institutions that the 
Mexican VISA Group of Monterrey is interested in reaquiring. Foreign banks 
are likely to be permitted to play a larger role once new bank regulations are in 
place. According to press reports, foreign investors will probably be allowed to 
own up to 49 percent of the shares of the reprivatized banks. In addition, 
\the government intends to allow foreign 
banks to open branches in Mexico. 
� Cairo's US Military Debt Worries Mubarak. Last week President Mubarak 
informed a visiting US official that Egypt will be unable to meet its annual 
Foreign Military Sales (FMS) obligations of more than $1 billion. Cairo must 
pay $287 million from June through September to avoid triggering sanctions 
under the Brooke Amendment, which mandates the suspension of US aid to 
FMS debtors who are a year iii arrears. The US Embassy reports the 
government's foreign exchange resources are perilously low, and Cairo is 
scrambling to finance wheat iMports with the aid of Persian Gulf Arab states. 
Grain on hand and scheduled Shipments will last only until early August, but 
Egypt hopes gift wheat from the United Arab Emirates�and possibly Kuwait�
will stretch supplies through October. 
Mubarak's concern about debt service is well founded, in our view, although the 
Egyptians may be painting a bleak picture in the hope that Washington will 
forgive at least part of Egypt's $6 billion military debt. Cairo is seeking an IMF 
standby arrangement to facilitate debt rescheduling, but an accord may be 
months away. The IMF wants to see additional budget measures and a more 
flexible exchange rate regime before agreeing to a standby, according to an 
Embassy readout from the IMF team in Cairo. In the interim, Cairo may be re-
quired to take unusual steps to avoid Brooke Amendment sanctions. Possible 
measures to raise foreign exchange include halting imports by the Central Bank 
of nonessential rationed foods, buying dollars from commercial banks or private 
moneychangers, or drawing from foreign exchange accounts held by the Oil and 
Defense Ministries.

� G-15: Emerging Cautiously from Inaugural Summit. External debt dominated 
discussions at the G-15 inaugural summit in Kuala Lumpur in early June, but no 
agreement on a united position was reached. The delegates�whose countries' 
$600 billion external debt accounts for nearly half of the Third World's total�
want developed nations to lower interest rates, stabilize exchange rates, and 
provide better access to their domestic markets for developing countries exports, 
according to press reports. The G-15 also proposed that financial institutions link 
debt servicing capacity to economic performance. While some Latin Aamerican 
countries wanted a strong position on debt relief, others such as Indonesia, 
Malaysia, and India, were more moderate. G-15 representatives have publicly 
announced they will meet during the coming months to draft a compromise 
strategy for dealing with creditors. 
Three initiatives emerged from the summit that are designed to facilitate 
economic growth in the Third World. According to US Embassy and press 
reporting, the group agreed to create a data exchange center to distribute 
information on trade, investment, and technology-transfer opportunities among 
developing nations. An initiative to boost South-South trade by utilizing Central 
Banks to guarantee payment to domestic exporters and one establishing a forum 
of businessmen, investors, and government officials to boost trade and invest-
ment between LDCs were also approved. The group failed, however, to establish 
a permanent Secretariat�a move that would have capped its commitment to 
become a formal organization representing Third World:interests. Instead, the 
group established a steering committee of Foreign Ministers from Malaysia, 
Venezuela, and Senegal to coordinate the group's activities until next year's 
summit in Caracas, where the Secretariat issue is likely to re-emerge. Malaysia 
was appointed to present G-15 positions to the G-77, but the group elected not to 
approach G-7 countries before the Houston Summit, according to US Embassy

Energy 
Italian Nuclear Plant 
Closure Ratified 
The Italian Parliament last week ratified the decommissioning of Italy's two 
nuclear power plants, according to the US Embassy in Rome. The two reactors, 
with a combined capacity of 1,150 megawatts, were shut down shortly after the 
Chernobyl' incident but had been kept ready for use pending the expiration of a 
five-year moratorium on nuclearl power enacted after a 1987 referendum. Al-
though the parliamentary action is the death knell for the nuclear operation of the 
two plants�they might still be converted to traditional fuels�the Parliament 
refused to support environmentalists' calls to ban any future development of 
nuclear power in Italy. Rather, it recommended that the National Agency for 
Nuclear and Renewable Energies and the National Agency for Electricity 
undertake research for safe reactors that might be built after 1992. Embassy 
reporting suggests that the compromise seems to have satisfied the Italian Green 
parties�which believe that such safe reactors will be unavailable for at least 15 
years�and Italian energy and industry officials. These officials reportedly worry 
that, without the possibility of nuclear expansion, Italy will be unable to meet 
carbon dioxide emission targets being promoted by EC partners such as West 
Germany and France to help combat climate change 
International Finance 
Western Banks Western banks have reacted to increasing Soviet indebtedness and delayed 
Requiring Higher payments with tougher credit terms, including higher interest rate margins. Short-
Margins on Loatis to term loan arrangements completed in the first quarter of this year show that 
USSR Western banks increased their margins to 0.5- to 1.25-percentage points over 
LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, with long-term loans priced even 
higher. Some Western banks made offers with margins as high as 3.0- to 4.0-
percentage points over LIBOR. The Soviet Union, considered an impeccable credit 
risk until recently, had enjoyed interest rates averaging just 0.125- to 0.25-
percentage points over LIBOR on short-term loans since the mid-1980s, with 
slightly higher margins as debt exposure crept up at the end of the decade. The loss 
of such favorable terms will aggravate Moscow's foreign payments problem, with 
additional debt servicing from the increased margins alone likely to amount to over 
$100 million next year. Even if the Soviets were to clear up the arrearage problem 
in the near term, margins will remain high because of banker concerns about the 
poor performance of the domestic economy and continued ethnic tensions.

India Welcomes 
US Decision on

Indian officials were pleased with the US announcement postponing a decision 
involving retaliation under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Trade Act until af-
ter the Uruguay Round ends in December. According to the US Embassy in New 
Delhi, they view the move as part of a broader improvement in US-Indian relations. 
In our view, New Delhi now will try to address some of Washington's insurance and 
investment concerns in the Uruguay Round to avoid possible US action against 
India after the Round ends. In addition, New Delhi may even negotiate bilaterally 
with the United States if it can avoid appearing to bow to US pressure. 
 New Delhi may push some elite Indian 
businessmen to personally call for the government to negotiate with the United 
States, after which Prime Minister Singh would agree to talk� claiming that he is 
only trying to protect important business interests from possible US retaliation. 
Some Indian exporters have already stated that they fear the United States will im-
pose sanctions after the Uruguay Round and hope that New Delhi will move faster� 
to open up the economy, according to the US Consulate in Bombay.

Costa Rica Announces

Americas 
In an effort to ease pressure on interest rates and inflation, President Calderon late 
last month unveiled a plan to slash Costa Rica's domestic budget deficit, which has 
risen steadily from 2 percent of GDP in 1988 to a projected 7 percent this year. 
Calderon plans to cut the projected deficit by more than 60 percent with a 25- to 
30-percent cut in government spending and substantial hikes in utility rates, 
according to US Embassy reporting. Over the longer term, San Jose hopes to hold 
the deficit down by boosting revenues through higher consumption and business 
taxes, by broadening the sales tax base, and by reducing exemptions. The 
President's proposal enabled Costa Rica to sign a letter of intent with the IMF ear-
lier this month for a new standby agreement. San Jose sought to soften the 
package by allocating more money for social programs, but businessmen, farmers, 
labor groups, and the main opposition political party are protesting the new 
measures. Calderon probably will go ahead with the increase in public-sector 
prices, but securing legislative approval for the proposed spending cuts and tax 
changes may be difficult.

Nicaraguan Cuban-
Nicaraguan Shipping 
Activity Despite Ban 
Although Cuba suspended all commerical shipments to Nicaragua in mid-March 
following President Chamorro's inauguration, Havana is quietly arranging for 
other shippers to transport Nicaraguan-bound cargoes, and limited shipping 
activity between the two countries is continuing aboard flag-of-convenience ships. 
Havana probably wants to keep the door open for future economic trade with 
Managua, and its decision to pick up cargo in Nicaragua suggests that the Cuban 
economy needed those goods. If the economic situation in Cuba continues to 
deteriorate, Havana may rescind its self-imposed ban against trading with the new 
Chamorro government. Nicaragua�bolstered by the suspension of US sanctions 
and the ability to trade freely with US firms�no longer needs Cuban maritime as-
sistance. Now that the conflict between the Sandinistas and Contras is winding 
down, the Nicaraguans probably see no need to dedicate two ships to a liner service 
with Cuba, and they are hoping to lease these ships to earn hard currency.

EC Makes Progress on EC Finance Ministers last week broke a 20-year deadlock on tax problems 
Single-Market Corporate encountered in cross-border business within the EC, giving a significant boost to 
Tax Policy completion of the single internal market by the end of 1992. The measures, 
strongly supported by EC firms, will abolish withholding taxes on dividends paid 
by a subsidiary to a parent firm in another member state, abolish capital gains tax-
es arising from cross-border mergers, and establish the use of arbitration in cross-
border tax disputes. West Germany cleared the way for agreement�perhaps in an 
attempt to show its commitment to the Community�by dropping its longstanding 
opposition to the withholding tax measure after the other members agreed to give 
Bonn until 1996 to comply fully. Agreement on these tax issues may signal 
increased member-state willingness to resolve other deadlocked tax issues that 
threaten timely completion of the single market. Italy, which takes over the EC 
Council's rotating presidency in July, has said agreement on harmonizing value-
added tax rates will be a top priority. 
Italy Strengthens 
Antistrike Law 
Threats of wildcat rail strikes, which would have disrupted the World Cup soccer 
championship, spurred the Italian Parliament to pass legislation making it easier 
for Rome to issue back-to-work orders. Informal unions have disrupted rail 
transportation this spring, pushing for higher wages than Italy's three major labor 
confederations have sought. The 'three confederations�affiliated with the Chris-
tian Democrats, Socialists, and the Communists�have often agreed to lower wage 
rates in exchange for concession that further their political agendas. The specter 
of strikes during the World Cup united Italy's normally fractious political class be-
hind antistrike legislation covering essential public services. Under the new law, 
Rome can broadcast back-to-work orders on television; previously, such orders had 
to be hand delivered to each striker. The law will allow Rome to reduce Italy's no-
torious disruptions to public services, thereby cutting the cost of doing business and 
generally making the country more competitive in international trade.

Paris Proceeding

East German Uranium 
Industry's Bleak Future 
Kenya Presents 
Optimistic. Budget 
ca. c 
22 June 1990 
The French Government will proceed cautiously in efforts to alleviate a growing in-
come disparity between rich and poor in France. President Mitterrand views 
redistribution as a way of bolstering his sagging popularity and of fulfilling 
promises made when he first took power in 1981. He and other Socialists are 
pushing Prime Minister Rocard to devise plans to spread the fruits of prosperity 
more evenly, although the government recently had to back away from a Socialist 
parliamentary proposal to raise the corporate capital gains tax from 19 to 25 
percent when the stock market reacted negatively. Rocard warned fellow Socialists 
that the proposal would discourage investment from other EC countries, and 
Mitterrand and Finance Minister Beregovoy subsequently tried to reassure finan-
cial markets by promising to consider other ways of narrowing the income gap. 
Paris also is threatening to supplement :the annual minimum wage hike if private 
industry does not come up with suggestions to help low-wage workers. 
West German officials are almost certainly planning to shut down East Germany's 
uranium mining industry, although the fact that it is a joint GDR-USSR project 
will increase the political and economic costs for Bonn. The GDR's uranium 
mining operation�one of the largest in the world with over 40,000 employees�is 
causing major environmental and health damage in the southern GDR; mining at 
the site was initiated by the Soviets in 1946, and their contracts do not expire until 
2000. West German authorities normally would have no compunction in shutting 
dawn this environmentally unsound industry, but the Kohl government is commit-
ted to ensuring that Soviet economic interests are not damaged by unification�
and Soviet officials already have explicitly raised the issue of uranium mining in 
bilateral talks. West German negotiators, for their part, probably believe that the 
Soviets are merely looking for compensation. Since production costs are five times 
�that of world market prices, the Germans doubt the Soviets are serious about 
wanting to continue operating the plant, particularly after 1 July when GDR trade 
is to be on a hard currency basis. One compromise solution under active 
consideration in Bonn is an agreement to replace the uranium the Soviets receive 
from the GDR through German purchases on the world market. 
Africa! Middle East 
Kenya's budget for FY 1990/91�starting 1 July�is based on improved revenue 
performance, tighter controls on government borrowing, increased debt service 
capability, and stronger export achievement, according to the US Embassy in 
Nairobi. The government projects total expenditures to increase 10 percent and 
revenues to grow by 24 percent. As a result, Nairobi hopes to reduce the budget defi-
cit to 3.8 percent of GDP, down from 4.2 percent in FY 1980/90, and to cut the 
country's debt service ratio to 20 percent of export earnings by 1995 from the present 
level of 27.5 percent. Kenya also is emphasizing export promotion in its economic pol-
icy for FY 1990/91 to sustain the country's fairly strong 5-percent average annual 
economic growth rate since 1980. Toward this end, the government introduced a duty 
exemption scheme for horticultural exports�a growing product line�and plans to  
step up its initiatives on the operation of Export Processing Zones (EPZs).

We believe some of Nairobi's budget assumptions are too optimistic. For example, 
we concur with the US Embassy's view that the debt service projections are 
unrealistic because exports continue to stagnate, while imports�partly paid for 
with increased foreign borrowing�continue to rise sharply. In addition, foreign 
investors have shown little interest in Nairobi's EPZ promotions because of an 
unfavorable investment climate highlighted by bureaucratic redtape and corrup-
tion, according to diplomatic and press reporting. Moreover, Nairobi has on 
several occasions in the past been unable to hold projected government expendi-
tures within targeted limits. 
Asia/Pacific 
Tokyo Trying To Japanese officials are offering new incentives to try to revitalize the Technopolis 
Revitalize Technopolis program�a plan designed to encourage regional development and the decentral-
Program ization of frontier technology industries by creating high-technology centers 
throughout Japan. Existing incentives�corporate investments in technology cen-
ters have been tax deductible since the plan's inception�have not spurred large-
scale industry involvement. The project�officially launched in the early 1980s�
has not attracted much industry participation because many firms are reluctant to 
locate new research and manufacturing ventures far from established company 
facilities and trading centers. To get the program back on track, Tokyo has 
committed itself to match any Technopolis-related funds set aside by prefectural 
governments and provide marketing assistance for small and medium-sized 
companies. The Trade Ministry will also extend government support for the 
program through 2000, rather than the early-to-middle 1990s as originally 
scheduled.

finalized this fall that would stress reducing emissions of several greenhouse gases 
through technological innovation. The plan would supplement the 100-year plan to 
combat climate change currently being promoted by the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI). One report suggested that the target would likely 
permit at least some emissions growth before, and possibly after, 2000. As such, it 
would not be nearly as strict as the targets being promoted by several West 
European countries. Nonetheless, the reports suggest proponents of the target (b)(3) 
believe that by demonstrating some flexibility on the target issue�where it had ;.

The South Korean press observed that in the past the BOK has taken strong 
measures against Korean employees who have ignored regulations, but this is the 
first warning to foreign bankers. As Seoul prepares for the complete liberalization 
of its financial markets in 1992, authorities want to ensure compliance by both do-
mestic and foreign banks of remaining regulations. For example, Seoul is 
especially concerned about the foreign exchange speculation that has occurred 
since government officials partially liberalized the market earlier this year. 
Although US branches will be affected by this tougher policy, Seoul is probably 
most concerned about the potential for illegal behavior by the powerful Japanese 
banks 
South Korea Likely To The South Korean Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI)�striving to establish 
Adopt US HDTV high-definition television as a major export market�is likely to adopt the US 
Standard HDTV standard, which is scheduled to be established in 1993. 
MTI ruled out the adoption of the Japanese standard because it felt 
Tokyo would not allow South Korean manufacturers access to the Japanese 
HDTV market. South Korean concerns over access to the European market will 
also probably encourage MTI to adopt the US standard. Not only is the United 
States the largest potential HDTV market but also South Korean television 
manufacturers are already established here. In addition, adoption of the US 
HDTV standard would assist South Korean firms in their efforts to establish 
HDTV joint ventures with US companies. Waiting for the establishment of the US 
standard, however, means the South Korean HDTV effort�whose government 
funding was put on hold in late 1989�is not likely to make substantial progress 
until 1993. 
Hong Kong Unions 
Protest Foreign Labor 
About 1,000 members of the Federation of Trade Unions recently demonstrated 
against a government plan to import about 15,000 more craftsmen, supervisors, 
and construction workers from China, the Philippines, and Thailand. The trade 
unionists fear losing their bargaining power with employers and slower wage 
increases in Hong Kong's inflationary economy; retail prices rose about 10 percent 
last year. According to government statistics, job vacancies rose to about 85,000 in 
1989, in part because of emigration driven by fear of the territory's return to 
Chinese control in 1997. By allowing more foreign workers, the government hopes 
to ease the chronic labor shortage and sluggish economic growth; GDP grew only 
2.5 percent last year. Staffing difficulties and rising wages have fueled inflation, 
lowering the competitiveness of Hong Kong's exports and causing firms to move 
production facilities to other countries. We believe the government will probably 
face increasingly strong opposition to foreign workers after the legislative election 
next year; unions are politicizing the issue by joining with Hong Kong's first 
political party, which supported the rally.

Punjab Province 
Pressuring Islamabad 
for More Funds 
Soviets Improving 
Enterprise Taxation 
The Punjab provincial government, which is headed by Prime Minister Bhutto's 
main political rival, Nawaz Shari'', recently announced its budget for FY 1991 and 
is pressuring Prime Minister Bhutto to fund the province's deficit�projected to be 
over $88 million. Islamabad, however, is facing IMF pressure to cut its own 
federal budget deficit and will be unable to bail out the Punjab government, in our 
view. According to US Embassy reports, the province plans to increase operational 
expenditures by about 15 percent over last year's level, but, as in past years, will 
not tax politically powerful landowners. Instead, the Punjab government reported-
ly hopes to get more federal funds for its Annual Development Program, but the 
federal government has already increased the province's ADP allocation by 15 
percent over last year. If additional federal funds are not forthcoming, we believe 
the Punjab's government almost certainly will blame the federal government for 
cuts in provincial spending in an attempt to garner political support. 
USSR 
The enterprise tax bill the Supreme Soviet passed yesterday establishes a 
maximum 45-percent tax on the profits of most state enterprises. Currently, 
ministries often arbitrarily tax the most efficient firms at much higher rates. 
Foreign enterprises will pay a 30-percent rate; joint ventures, except for those 
engaged in services, will continue to be exempt from taxes for their first two years 
of profitability. The tax receipts will flow about equally into union and republic 
budgets, providing needed resources for republic autonomy. Profits in excess of a 
30-percent return on capital will be confiscated. The law is an important step in 
giving the government fiscal tools to regulate the economy and to pursue social 
goals as it dismantles administrative controls. It is also a victory for reformers, who 
lobbied against the government-proposed 55-percent rate. Nonetheless, a rate of 
45 percent and the confiscation of "excess" profits are still likely to discourage en-
trepreneurial activity.
