 ISRAEL:             Political Stalemate Continues
 President Herzog will begin consultations with party leaders
 today to determine whether he should give Labor or Likud the
 first shot at forming a coalition government.
 Comment: Despite press reports that an ultraorthodox religious
 party, SHAS, had decided to join a Likud-led coalition, SHAS officials
 met on Sunday with Labor leader Peres. Peres said after the
 meeting that he still believed the religious party might join a Labor
 government. If he is wrong, it will be highly difficult for Labor to put
 together a 61-member coalition government.
 Former Defense Minister Weizman, whose Yahad Party controls three
 Knesset seats, continues to favor either a Labor-led coalition or a
 government of national unity. Likud cannot form a government
 without his support.
 Weizman's opposition to Likud stems largely from his disapproval of
 its settlement policy in the occupied territories. He, nonetheless,
 might be willing to join Likud if Labor fails to form a coalition or if
 Likud makes a sufficiently attractive offer.
 Weizman is a former member of Likud, and he realizes that serving in
 a Likud government would give him the opportunity to-rejoin the party
 and perhaps eventually compete for the Likud leadership.
 A decision by Weizman to support Likud, however, would open up
 new problems for Prime Minister Shamir's coalition. The
 ultranationalist party, Tehiya, has stated that it would not serve with
 Weizman in a Likud government. If Tehiya withdraws its five seats,
 Likud would be unable to form a coalition.

 NICARAGUA:           Insurgent Accord
 Eden Pastora's denunciation of the unity agreement between two
 major insurgent organizations diminishes its political impact,
 but the accord increases the prospects for coordinated military
 actions
 The pact commits the Nicaraguan Democratic Force and the
 Democratic Revolutionary Alliance to oust the Sandinista regime
 but rejects a return to the politics of former President Somoza
 both organizations oppose Pastora's
 participation unless he rejoins the Alliance, which recently ousted him
 for rejecting the unity effort.
 Pastora charges that Alliance leaders are withholding aircraft and
 other equipment belonging to his forces and he claims that most
 guerrillas in the south are loyal to him.
 Comment: The unity agreement should help the Force's efforts to
 dispel charges that it is dominated by supporters of Somoza. The
 document's explicit rejection of Somoza's rule parallels a slogan that
 Pastora has used to describe his own movement. Nevertheless,
 Pastora is the best known Nicaraguan insurgent leader, and his
 continuing charges will cloud the Democratic Force's attempts to
 improve its image.
 Because of their division, the insurgent groups have fought in
 differing areas of the country and have not benefited from tactical
 coordination. The new agreement paves the way for local
 coordination in areas such as the Atlantic coast, where recent
 contacts between-Force and Alliance elements reportedly have
 occurred.

 USSR-EASTERN         Policies Encourage Hardliners
 EUROPE:
 Moscow's confrontational attitude toward the West reportedly
 has strengthened the confidence of conservatives in Eastern
 Europe who oppose domestic reforms and improving ties with
 the West, but the                    the upper hand except in
 Czechoslovakia.       ?
 Hungarian moderates are concerned that worsened East-West
 relations, which they attribute especially to the US-Soviet impasse
 over INF, have emboldened conservative opponents of the regime's
 policies                                         any further        25X1
 deterioration in relations would encourage hardliners to try even. more
 to increase their influence.                                        25X1
 Moscow's confrontational         25X1
 attitude has strength ned hardliners             and
 government.                                      he Soviets         25X1
 were creating a crisis atmosphere in order to demand greater Warsaw
 Pact cooperation and cohesion      "Western strategic and
 economic hostility."                                                25X1
 In Czechoslovakia, the attacks directed by ultraorthodox Party
 Secretary Bilak against domestic reforms of other East European
 states and their cooperation with the West reportedly may have been
 encouraged by Bilak's impressions of the Soviet leadership. A US
 Embassy source in Prague speculates that Bilak believes a regime led
 by General Secretary Chernenko would return to the conservatism of
 Brezhnev and Suslov and look favorably on his own hardline policies.
 Comment: East European hardliners do not appear to have gained
 the upper hand, except in Czechoslovakia where Bilak has regained
 the initiative he lost during Andropov's tenure.
 Poland's political amnesty and its decision to refrain from severely
 curbing Church activities suggest that hardliners there are not getting.
 their way. Moreover, the influence of conservative elements in
 Hungary and Bulgaria even.appears to be in decline. Proponents
 of a harder line are unlikely to increase their influence as long as
 moderates can point to benefits accruing from domestic reforms
 and cooperation with the West.

 Chancellor Kohl's governing coalition yesterday agreed on a
 series of environmental protection measures for a coal-fi
 power plant, thereby averting a crisis in the coalition.
 At the request of the opposition Social Democrats, the Bundestag-
 which last month unanimously opposed the opening of the plant
 before installation of sulfur dioxide filters-will meet in extraordinary
 session today to discuss the issue.
 The Free Democrats in the Cabinet opposed Interior Minister
 Zimmermann's decision to open the plant. In fact, before yesterday's
 meeting, Free Democratic Economics Minister Bangemann warned
 that a crisis was at hand and that coalitions had fallen over lesser
 issues.
 Comment: The Free Democrats, recognizing the importance of
 environmental issues with the public, clearly intensified this dispute in
 an effort to highlight their differences with the Christian Democrats.
 Kohl probably is prepared to tolerate some efforts by the Free
 Democrats aimed at improving their poor electoral prospects, but
 statements such as Bangemann's leave the impression of a weak
 government.
 The affair is likely to increase criticism of Kohl's leadership within
 his own party. Many members already are unhappy about the
 government's disregard for their views on opening the power plant as
 expressed in the Bundestag resolution and the perceived unreliability
 of the Free Democrats as a coalition partner.

 USSR-ETHIOPIA:       Protecting the Soviet Investment
 Recent Soviet financial concessions to Ethiopia reflect Moscow's
 efforts to reinforce already close ties at a time when its position
 in southern Africa is being challenged.
 A US Embassy source in Addis Ababa reports that the USSR will
 allow Ethiopia to delay repayment on its debt for military equipment
 until April 1986. The Soviets reportedly have also agreed to provide
 aircraft-probably MIGs-to replace those destroyed in May by a
 rebel attack on the Asmara Airfield. These agreements probably were
 completed late this month during the visit of Marshal Petrov, the Chief
 of Soviet Ground Forces.
 Comment: Despite the accords, Moscow and Addis Ababa still differ
 over longstanding issues, including strategy for resolving the Eritrean
 insurgency-which was reportedly discussed during the Petrov
 visit-and the composition of the new workers' art of Ethiopia to be
 unveiled in September                             the Soviets
 are unhappy that Mengis u s military clique will dominate the party.
 These differences, however, do not threaten the bilateral relationship
 and Moscow probably will continue efforts to improve ties with
 Ethiopia. Indeed, setbacks in Mozambique and the changing political
 and military situation in Angola make Ethiopia even more important to
 Moscow's position in Africa.

 ANGOLA-ZAIRE: Increasing Border Tensions
 A close associate of Angolan President dos Santos told a senior US
 official last week of Luanda's growing concern about Zaire's support
 for the UNITA insurgents.
 Angolan troops and MIG aircraft have made severs incursions into
 Zairian territory during the past month, and Zairian armed forces in
 the region have been ordered to engage the Angolans.
 Comment: Angola's belief that Zaire has renewed aid to UNITA stems
 largely from the spread of the insurgency during the past several
 months into northeastern Angola. In addition, Luanda's suspicions
 have been heightened by Soviet disinformation efforts that link Zaire
 and UNITA to alleged US,,South African, and Israeli efforts to
 undermine the regime. Zaire probably does not give direct military aid
 to UNITA, but it apparently has allowed the insurgents increased use
 USSR-US: Media Coverage of the Olympics
 A TASS report on Saturday cited a "dangerous situation" in Los
 Angeles and reported an alleged terrorist incident in which unknown
 persons fired on a bus carrying Olympic athletes. As staged in
 America, TASS reported, the Games are "an obvious political
 spectacle in the worst traditions of Hollywood: cowboys, wagons, and
 barelegged girls." Izvestiya yesterday ridiculed the Games as little
 more than "a diluted Pan-American event." The Soviet media are
 giving little domestic coverage to the Games.
 Comment: By playing up accidents and tragedies in Los Angeles, the
 Soviets are seeking to substantiate their claim that the US has failed
 to provide adequate security arrangements-the alleged reason for
 their boycott. The relative absence of domestic coverage of the
 Games may be intended to encourage Soviet citizens to look forward
 to the "Friendship '84 Olympics" next month in Moscow. Even though
 the Games in Los Angeles apparently are a barely visible event to the
 Soviet public. Moscow is still ea er to denigrate US handling of the
 events.

 INDIA-WEST GERMANY: Joint Helicopter Venture
 India's Defense Minister reportedly has announced that New Delhi
 and West Germany will collaborate in designing, developing, and
 producing 200 advanced light helicopters with the first operationally
 deployed by the early 1990s. New Delhi will use the helicopters for a
 variety of missions, including armed reconnaissance, antisubmarine
 warfare, and antitank and transport duties.
 Comment: India is finally moving ahead on a helicopter
 modernization program that was officially authorized in 1976 but
 hampered by various bureaucratic, design, and technical delays. New
 Delhi wants to replace the two types of single-engine helicopters it
 now manufactures, both designed by the French, with one that is
 more versatile and likely to survive combat. The agreement with Bonn
 reflects New Delhi's continued willingness to make selective
 purchases from the West, despite its dependence on the USSR for the
 bulk of its arms.
 A British court's decision yesterday to impose a fine on Welsh miners
 may begin a series of legal initiatives by the government against
 striking coal miners. According to the press, the court has fined the
 Welsh union $66,000 for illegally picketing a steelmill and has
 threatened to seize the union's entire assets unless it pays the fine by
 tomorrow. Arthur Scargill, head of the National Union of Mineworkers,
 reportedly has reaffirmed his intent not to cooperate with the courts.
 The government, meanwhile, has threatened to take Scargill to court
 if he fails to hold a nationwide strike ballot by September. The coal
 miners, who have been on strike since March, are protesting the
 government's decision to close 20 unproductive mines.
 Comment: The decision is the-first court action against the coal
 miners in their four-month-old strike, and Scargill may see it as the
 beginning of a general legal offensive by the government. Scargill,
 nevertheless, probably will refuse to abide by the court order and may
 seek help from the Trades Union Congress, which represents all
 British unions. The TUC has stayed neutral in the coal strike, however,
 and is unlikely to help him defy the law.

 Special Analysis
 SWITZERLAND-         Technology Transfer
 USSR:
 Switzerland is one of the most important conduits for illegal
 trade in high technology. Its desire to maintain unimpeded
 access to US technology, however, has resulted in some
 te on
 encouraging, if modest, ste s b Bern, to co7a
 technology transfer issues.
 Switzerland produces three key items controlled by COCOM:
 computer-controlled machine tools, semiconductor production
 equipment, and optical coating technology. Because Switzerland is
 not a COCOM member, the Warsaw Pact countries are able to
 circumvent COCOM controls by leaally gurchasina these items from
 the Swiss.
 Firms based in Switzerland rank third behind firms in West Germany
 and Japan in the number of documented diversions of COCOM-
 controlled technology to the USSR and Eastern Europe. The majority
 of these illegal transfers involve computers, peripheral equipment,
 and semiconductor production equipment.
 Swiss procedures governing controlled items imported into
 Switzerland probably are the most rigorous of any neutral European
 country. These procedures, however, have several weaknesses that
 are easily exploited by firms and individuals supplying the USSR and
 its East European allies with COCOM-controlled technology.
 Technology Flows
 Switzerland's strict laws on business confidentiality and its
 23 privately operated, bonded free-trade ports make it a haven for
 diversion operations. The bonded free-trade ports in Geneva, Zurich,
 and Basel together may be the principal European conduit for moving
 illegally acquired technology to the Warsaw Pact countries. There are
 at least four major diversion networks operating out of Switzerland.

 In general, the Swiss have been diligent in protecting COCOM-
 controlled technology imported under the provisions of the Swiss
 Blue Import Certificates. Swiss export control procedures, however,
 have several major weaknesses. The most serious is that, because
 intransit goods do. not officially enter the commerce of Switzerland,
 they do not require a certificate. The result is virtually unimpeded
 transit of a large volume of illegally acquired technology and
 equipment through Switzerland.
 Prospects
 Over the past two years Swiss authorities have become more
 cooperative on technology transfer issues. Bern recognizes that its
 access to US technology could be impaired if it is considered an easy
 route to use in sending illegally acquired technology to the East.
 Bern believes that it is complying, within the limits set by Swiss law,
 with US desires to restrict Soviet access to controlled technology, and
 it resents the extraterritorial application of US export control
 regulations. Above all, the Swiss Government is concerned that the
 more restrictive procedures for US general distribution licenses and
 the new authority granted the Department of Defense to review
 license applications involving seven key high technology categories
 will seriously impede Swiss trade and commerce.

 PHILIPPINES:         Impact of the National Assembly Election
 The Daily today prints the Key Judgments of the Special National
 Intelligence Estimate entitled "The Philippines: Impact of the
 National Assembly Election."
 The ,National Assembly election in May was a de facto defeat for the
 Marcoses, who have been struggling since the assassination of
 Benigno Aquino to preserve the illusion of popular support for their
 regime, and presents the President with three critical challenges in
 the next six months to a year. He must:
 - Limit the opposition's effectiveness in the new Assembly.
 Marcos has a good chance of outmaneuvering his opponents
 on most policy issues, but he will have trouble preventing them
 from limiting his authoritarian powers.
 - Maintain discipline within the ruling party. Marcos can no
 longer count on the unquestioning support of the ruling
 party-particularly on political reform issues.
 - Begin to right a teetering economy by undertaking crucial
 austerity measures-which he has so far resisted. At the same
 time, the Assembly-with the support of labor, business, and
 consumer groups-could dilute the austerity measures
 prescribed by the IMF, thus threatening a cutoff of new
 financing.
 In the absence of a precipitous decline in the economy, Marcos's
 short-term strategy probably will be to court and co-opt opposition
 figures where he can, while intimidating and discrediting those who
 defy him. These tactics will not be entirely successful, however, and
 Marcos probably will have to fight a series of rear-guard actions with
 his opponents that will leave him in a weaker position in the years
 ahead.
 One result could be that Marcos will be unable to secure another term
 in office, although his chances of completing his present term are
 better than even. A less likely outcome would see Marcos resorting
 increasingly to heavyhanded tactics-such as a major crackdown on
 opposition leaders or the reimposition of martial law-as economic
 and political pressures mount. Further pressures would be generated
 if the Agrava Board-investigating the assassination of Aquino-
 clearly implicates the military in a coverup. Marcos almost certainly

 realizes that an attempt to reassert his former authority probably
 would not be tolerated by the public, and he is unlikely to take this     25X1
 step.
 Marcos's unpopularity is unmistakable, but the durability of the
 moderate opposition's gains will not be known for many months and
 will not be tested again until the local elections in 1986 for mayors and
 governors. At present, his moderate opponents are divided into rival
 personality-based factions and will have difficulty agreeing on all but
 the anti-Marcos issues. Their ability to challenge Marcos on key
 issues will determine whether the left will be able to gain the initiative
 within the opposition movement.
 In the event of Marcos's sudden death or incapacitation, a succession
 struggle is likely to occur within the ruling party. The election results,
 however, have further weakened the prospects for an alliance
 between Imelda Marcos and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Fabian Ver
 coming to power in the near term.
 It is too soon to assess the prospects for a member of the opposition
 to succeed Marcos. The odds now favor the emergence of new
 political alignments-with support from the business community,
 untainted ruling party leaders, and the opposition-during the next
 few years.
 Any successor government will have difficulty managing the economic
 and political problems that will accompany the transition from an
 import- to an export-oriented economy. Under the most optimistic
 assessment, economic growth will average less than 1 percent a year
 through 1987. A more precipitous decline in the economy could take
 place later this year if IMF negotiations collapse or in 1986 when
 another round of commercial debt rescheduling seems certain.
 Economic problems and political uncertainty are likely to bolster
 prospects for the Communist Party of the Philippines, which leads the
 nationwide insurgency of roughly 13,000 to 15,000 guerrillas spread
 among 62 out of 72 provinces. The Armed Forces of the Philippines
 has yet to develop an effective counterinsurgency campaign and
 suffers from serious logistic problems and equipment shortages.
 The setback Marcos suffered as a result of the election will
 complicate the government's ability to combat the insurgency.
 Nevertheless, it is doubtful that the insurgency will be in a position to
 overthrow the government by 1985, or even by the end of Marcos's
 term in office. If present trends continue, however, by 1987 the
 insurgents could have the capability among other things to conduct
 multi battalion-size operations, disrupt the national economy, and
 expand violence into the capital region.
