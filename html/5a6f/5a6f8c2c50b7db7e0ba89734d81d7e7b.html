 This is a short annotated bibliography of publications for basic reading
 on the military and political aspects of insurgency and counterinsurgency.
 With the exception of Mao Tse-tung's classic work, On Guerrilla Warfare,
 all of the specific insurgencies described are in the post-World War II era.
 Mao's book is included because of its influence on this type of warfare in
 Vietnam, Cuba and elsewhere.  Certain books listed in the General section,
 which comprises Part I of this bibliography, contain material on earlier
 periods, but this is only incidental. to the material on the post-World War II
 period emphasized in those titles.
 The first section of this bibliography contains titles of a general nature.
 on this type of conflict, whether it be known as insurgency and counter-
 insurgency, guerrilla and counterguerrilla warfare, wars of national
 liberation, or, more simply, internal war.  The second section is given
 over to books on specific instances of insurgency and counterinsurgency in
 selected countries.  U. S. military manuals and studies have been excluded
 from both sections since these materials are readily identifiable and ac-
 cessible in official libraries.
 It is recognized that many of the books listed are biased in their
 presentation.  Even with this bias, which is largely in political viewpoint,
 there is much value in these books.  Insofar as they describe specific
 political and military actions, strategy, and tactics associated with
 insurgency and counterinsurgency as well as the interaction of the political
 and military aspects of given situations, they are useful.  In listing what
 are believed to be the most authoritative works available in English on
 these events, it is recognized that any one charged with the study of a
 particular situation will have to read in much greater depth, utilizing
 more detailed studies and bibliographical tools.

 Casebook on Insurgency and Revolutionary Warfare:  23 Summary Accounts
 Washington:  The American University, Special Operations
 Research Office, 1962
 607 p.  Maps.
 Foreword by Theodore R. Valiance, Director, Special Operations
 Research Office.  Bibliographical footnotes and a list of recom-
 mended readings follow each section.
 This volume is one of a series of studies prepared by SORO under
 contract with the Department of the Army.  It was prepared from
 unclassified sources, with heavy reliance on secondary sources, and was
 developed as a "reader" in insurgency and revolutionary warfare.  The
 23 cases are summary descriptive accounts of specific insurgency situ-
 ations, and a standard textual format is used.  The casebook illustrates
 the types of economic, social, political and military conditions under
 which the insurgency occurred, and includes a discussion, in each
 instance, of the insurgent movement and the countering efforts.  Among
 the country cases considered are Algeria (1954-62); China (1947-49);
 Congo (1960); Cuba (1953-59); Hungary (1956); Indonesia (1945-49); Iran
 (1953); Iraq (1958); Korea (1960); Malaya (1948-57); and Vietnam (1946-54),

 Research Office, 1963
 358 p.  Illus.  Maps.  Charts.  Index.
 Foreword by Theodore R. Vallance, Director, Special Operations
 Research Office.  Bibliographical footnotes at the end of each section.
 This volume is one of a series of studies prepared by SORO under
 contract with the Department of the Army.  The book includes chapters
 on the role of undergrounds in resistance and revolutionary warfare; the
 administrative function of undergrounds (recruitment, logistics, security),
 underground operational "functions and techniques; and the use of under-
 grounds by the communists.  The second part of the book is devoted to
 specific case studies--the French and Yugoslav resistance in World
 War II; and the post -war insurgent activities in Algeria, Greece, Malaya,
 Palestine and the Philippines.  Each case study in this section includes
 a description of the counterinsurgent measures used by incumbent govern-
 ments.                      With the exception of the sections on countermeasures, the
 study is written to reflect the insurgent's point of view, rather than that
 of the counterinsurgent.

 Conflict in the Shadows:  The Nature and Politics of Guerrilla War
 Garden City, New York:  Doubleday & Company, 1963
 180 p.  Index.
 Foreword by Stewart Alsop.  Bibliography.
 Cross served in the OSS during World War II and has had extensive
 governmental experience since that time.  He has also been a Research
 Associate at the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts
 Institute of Technology, and a Research Assistant to George Kennan at
 the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.  He is presently an
 associate of the Institute for Defense Analyses.  The book is a well
 written, panoramic examination of insurgency and counterinsurgency.
 Making liberal use of historical and current illustrations, the book
 describes the kinds of environments and the synoptic conditions in
 which insurrection may take root and flourish, the character of the mili-
 tary conflict between guerrilla and government forces, the critical
 struggle between the two for popular support, and the roles, problems,
 and ramifying burdens of foreign powers involved on either side.  He
 writes at some length on tactics, targets, weaponry, logistics and com-
 munications.  The weakest aspect of the book is the lack of detailed
 discussion on the role of intelligence in this type of warfare.

 Counterinsurgency Warfare:  Theory and Practice
 New York:  Frederick A. Praeger, 1964

 Galula is a graduate of the French Military Academy at Saint-Cyr
 and fought in the European Theater during World War II.  He had post-
 war service in China and Southeast Asia, served as a United Nations
 Military Observer in Greece (1949-50), as Military Attache in Hong
 Kong, and in Algeria.  The author examines the nature and general
 characteristics of revolutionary war, and the prerequisites for success-
 ful insurgency, including its growth patterns, environment and charac-
 teristics.  He then develops principles for guiding the counterinsurgent.
 These embody the orderly and systematic concentration, employment,
 and intensive use of all assets available to the political leadership of
 the counterinsurgency effort, as well as military superiority in unit
 strength and equipment.  The design is to take and hold the initiative
 and the mood is relentlessly on the offensive.

 13.       TRINQUIER, Roger
 Modern Warfare: A French View of Counterinsurgency
 New York:  Frederick A. Praeger, 1964
 115 p.
 [Introduction:] A Portrait of the "Centurion" by Bernard B. Fall
 Translated from the French by Daniel Lee
 Col. Trinquier was a regular French officer for about thirty years.
 Prior to World War II he served in Indochina, and during World War II
 he was in Shanghai with the forces of Vichy France.  In the late forties
 he was again in Indochina, and returned there once more in 1951, com-
 manding French behind-the-lines activities until the cease-fire in 1954.
 His subsequent military career was largely spent in Algeria.  Trinquier's
 doctrine highlights intense, highly professional military and police
 operations in counterinsurgency, the destruction of the insurgents' appa-
 ratus in the towns and villages, the restructuring of the inhabitants
 under local civilian leaders chosen carefully for their qualities of
 initiative and intelligence, and the development of self-defense units
 within an assuredly secure environment.  As the situation improves,
 civil action can be utilized.  The support of the people is emphasized.
 Trinquier lays considerable stress on the application of intelligence
 principles to counterinsurgency actions, and emphasizes the need for
 professional interrogators.

 This volume is one of a series of studies prepared by SORO under

 unclassified sources, and for the most part secondary sources were
 used.  The book gives the historical background to Algerian dissidence,
 and the factors on which it fed; then describes the organization, strategy,
 and techniques of the insurgent movement.  The French countering
 strategy and tactics are set forth. Basically, this is not a study of
 strategy and tactics; rather it concentrates on the character and dynamics
 of the insurgent movement in order to give a base for the development
 of policies and operations to counter similar situations.

 Appendix, containing maps of Algerian nationalist military activity.
 This book is based on Miss Gillespie's doctoral thesis at the
 Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  It was published after her death
 in 1959. Miss Gillespie served briefly as a U. S. Foreign Service Officer
 and subsequently became a journalist specializing in African affairs.
 As a journalist, she visited Algerian Nationalist Army units and terri-
 tory, as well as the French Army in Algiers.   The emphasis of this
 book is on the Algerian side and underscores the political development
 of Algerian nationalism and insurgency.  Comparatively little material
 on French counterinsurgent effort is included.
 Books on Algerian insurgency must be approached with great caution.
 Those that have been published contain varying degrees of bias and accu-
 racy, depending on the political point of view of the individual authors
 and the validity of their sources.  Some are strongly pro-French; others
 are prejudiced in favor of the French settlers in Algeria; still others are
 markedly sympathetic to the various Algerian national liberation groups.
 Several of the books are highly romanticized versions of the actual facts,
 even though ostensibly written from first hand knowledge.  Some cover
 the political background of Algerian insurgency and French counter-
 insurgency, with only a small section of the book given over to the
 military aspects; by and large those sections are, not useful. In short,
 nothing truly authoritative has as yet been published commercially on
 Algerian insurgency.  However, some of the more comprehensive books
 listed in the General Section of this Bibliography do discuss French
 counterinsurgency in Algeria with authority.

 16.  HENDERSON, Ian with Philip Carter Goodhart
 Man Hunt In Kenya
 New York:  Doubleday & Company, 1958
 240 p.  Illus.  Map end papers.
 Foreword by Mr. Richard Catling, Commissioner of Police, Kenya
 Senior Superintendent Henderson of Special Branch was a Kenya-born
 police officer and a key figure in British counterinsurgency activities
 against the Mau Mau.  Goodhart has been a newspaperman and is a Con-
 servative MP.  This book describes the actions leading to the capture of
 the militant Mau Mau insurgent leader, Dedan Kimathi, in which Super-
 intendent Henderson played a leading role.  It was a major incident of
 the British counterinsurgency actions in Kenya.  The book also describes
 the British "counter-gang" techniques used in the counterinsurgency in
 Kenya (1953-1955) and elsewhere.
 17.   KITSON,   Major Frank
 Gangs and Counter-gangs-
 London.  Barrie and Rockliff, 1960
 211 p.  Maps.  Charts.
 Foreword by General Sir George Erskine, formerly C. in C. , Kenya
 This book is an overall study of the British counterinsurgent effort
 against the Mau Mau in Kenya, written from the point of view of a District
 Military Intelligence Officer in Kenya during the Mau Mau uprisings (1953-
 55).                         The most interesting feature of the book is the author's description
 of the evolution of the "counter-gang" system of fighting the Mau Mau.
 The "counter-gangs" lived, dressed, ate and operated as Mau Mau in
 order to locate and ambush the real terrorists.  While the story is told
 from a relatively junior officer's level, and with a fairly localized point
 of view, the author exhibits an appreciation of the general insurgency
 situation and the overall intelligence picture in Kenya.
 For a detailed study on the development of the Mau Mau movement
 prior to the Emergency of 1953, see:  'The Origins and Growth of Mau Mau:
 An Historical Survey published by the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya
 (Nairobi, 1960).  It was written by Government Commissioner F. D.
 Corfield, a veteran British Colonial Officer.

 The Memoirs of General Grivas
 London:  Longmans, 1964
 226 p.  Illus.  Map.  Index.
 Appendices, including a Preparatory General Plan and EOKA leaflets.
 General Grivas was the military leader of EOKA, the Cypriot guer-
 rilla movement to liberate Cyprus from British rule during the 1950's.
 Charles Foley, who edited these Memoirs, was formerly Foreign Editor
 of the London Daily Express and founded and edited the Times of Cyprus
 during the Emergency there.  This English language edition is based on
 Grivas' original Greek text, together with additional material he has
 supplied the editor from his letters and diaries, official reports and docu-
 ments.  It is devoted almost entirely to Gen. Grivas' activities during
 the Cypriot insurgency, depicting his role as insurgent leader and the
 EOKA campaigns of terror and violence.
 Two other books on the insurgency have been written from opposing
 points of view.W   Cyprus Guerrilla by Doros Alastos (London.  Heinemann,
 1960) is written by a Cypriot who is strongly pro-Grivas and Makarios.
 Grivas and the Story of EOKA by Wilfred Byford-Jones (London. Robert
 Hale, 1959) is strongly anti-Grivas and is designed to correct any
 unfavorable impressions of British actions in Cyprus and the role of
 the British soldiers there.  However, these two books are not as useful
 as the others listed.

 A Term Paper for the Fifth Senior Seminar in Foreign Policy for

 Tams is a U. S. Foreign Service Officer with experience in Greece.
 Col. Chamberlin is presently assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  This
 study was completed while both were students at the Foreign Service
 Institute.  It is based in part on the writings of the Greek Communist
 Party and in part on the archives of the United States Military Mission
 to Greece.  The largest part of the study is devoted to the Greek com-
 munist insurgency of 1946-49.  The political and military aspects of
 the insurgency are detailed, together with the counterinsurgent actions
 of the Greek Government.  The role of American economic and mili-
 tary aid to the Greek Government is described, as well as the assistance
 afforded the insurgents by neighboring communist countries.  The role
 of the Greek communist units in World War II resistance is also
 assessed, particularly in the light of their 1944-45 activities which
 were the earliest stages of the 1946 insurgency.

 Chandler was a member of the British Political Warfare Executive
 in Cairo in World War II and in 1944 served in Greece as a member of
 the British Mission to the Greek Guerrillas.  He also served in the
 British Embassy in Athens.  He subsequently returned to Greece as a
 correspondent for The Economist and his tours there included observa-
 tion of the Greek insurgency of 1946-49.  This book not only covers the
 latter period, but also examines the earlier attempts of the Greek com-
 munist guerrilla forces to seize control of Greece in 1944-45.  The book
 is written more from the political view of the insurgency than from the
 purely military, and lends more emphasis to the British military
 assistance to the Greek Government than to the American role,

 Bibliographical footnotes.  Bibliographies.
 This volume is one of a series of studies prepared by SORO under
 contract with the Department of the Army.  It was prepared from
 unclassified sources, and for the most part secondary sources were
 used.  This book deals with the insurgency against the French rather
 than the current North Vietnamese directed civil war in South Vietnam.
 The book discusses the struggle of the Indochinese guerrillas with the
 French regular forces.  It gives historical background for this dissi-
 dence, the factors on which it fed, and the input of communist ideology
 into the Vietminh.  It then describes the organization and techniques
 of the movement.    Basically, this is not a study of strategy and tactics;
 rather it concentrates on the character and dynamics of the insurgent
 movement in order to give a base for the development of policies and
 operations to counter similar situations.

 28.  FALL, Bernard B.
 Street Without Joy:  Insurgency in Indochina, 1946-63
 Harrisburg, Pennsylvania:  The Stackpole Company, 1963 (Third
 Revised Edition)
 379 p.  Illus.. Maps.  Map end papers.  Charts.  Index.
 Foreword by Marshall Andrews.  Appendices, containing a glossary
 of abbreviations, a table ,of comparative French and U. S. losses in
 Indochina and Korea, and a: military bibliography of Indochina.
 Dr. Fall served in the French underground in World War IL  He
 covered the French war in Indochina, wrote part of his doctoral thesis
 at Syracuse University on this topic, and has continued to visit and
 write on Southeast Asia.  He is a Professor of International Relations
 at Howard University, Washington, D. C.   The first issuance of Street
 Without Joy (1961) covered the defeat of the French forces by the Indo-
 chinese insurgents (1946-54).  The present edition has been expanded to
 include the current insurgency and counterinsurgency in Vietnam and
 the American role there.  A revised fourth edition has been announced
 for publication in November 1964.  Dr. Fall knows a great deal about
 the area but is a French national by origin.  Consequently, his views
 reflect a French perspective which the reader should bear in mind when
 considering his interpretation of Indochinese affairs.
 For the history and background of what are now North and South
 Vietnam from the earliest times to the present, see:  The Two Viet-Nams:
 A Political and Military Analysis by Bernard Fall (New York:  Frederick A.
 Praeger, 1963).  This book includes material on the early rise of Ho Chi
 Minh and communism in the north, the insurgency leading to the ouster
 of the French, and the rise of insurgency and counterinsurgency in South
 Vietnam, ending with the Buddhist uprising in the summer of 1963.  The
 same caveat about Dr. Fall's outlook noted in the entry on Street Without
 _joy also applies here.

 Note by William L. Holland, Secretary-General of the Institute
 of Pacific Relations.       Preface by Rupert Emerson, Professor
 of Government, Harvard University.  Selected Bibliography.
 Published under the auspices of the Institute of Pacific Relations.
 A forty-page pamphlet by Dr. Hammer entitled The Struggle for
 Indochina Continues:   Geneva to Bandung (Stanford. Stanford
 University Press,  1955) has been published as an addendum to
 The Struggle For Indochina.
 This book describes the history of Indochina from the beginning of
 World War II to the convoking of the Geneva Conference of 1954 follow-
 ing the defeat of the French.  It discusses the interaction of political
 and military developments in the insurgency and the French counter-
 insurgency efforts.  The interrelations of the French, Emperor Bao
 Dai and Vietminh elements during this period, as well as the separatist
 aspects of Laos and Cambodia, are also included.  The slant of the book
 is anti-French, anti-colonial, and pro-Vietnamese.
 Another useful book, covering the period in Indochina from World
 War II through the aftermath of the Geneva Conference and the year
 1955, is The Emancipation of French Indochina by Donald Lancaster
 (London.  Oxford University Press, 1961) published under the auspices
 of the Royal Institute of International Affairs.  Lancaster served on
 the staff of the British Legation in Saigon, 1950-54.   The main portion
 of the book deals with the insurgency against the French and the French
 counterinsurgent effort.  The author stresses the interaction of the
 political on the military, and views armed conflict as only one aspect
 of the insurgency problem.  This book is written from a more impartial
 viewpoint than Dr. Hammer's and gives recognition to the odds against
 which the French were fighting.  Lancaster's book provides a particu-
 larly good summary of political developments in Indochina during and
 immediately after World War II.  These set the stage for initial com-
 munist successes in the early 1950's and constitute essential background
 for an understanding of subsequent communist political action there.

 political guidelines for enlisting popular support for insurgent action.
 It also analyzes the military aspects of the successful insurgency against

 General Nasution was a leader in the Indonesian struggle for inde-

 First Minister for Defense and National Security.  He has been con-
 sidered a moderating influence on the attempts of the communists to
 take over ,both the Indonesian Army and the Government itself, and
 has been -a leader in combatting communist subversion.  This is a
 translation of Nasution's work Pokok 2 Gerilja, originally published in
 Djakarta in 1954.  In his preface, the author states that this work is
 just an introduction to the book Indonesia's War of Independence, on
 which he has been working.  His purpose is to set forth information
 on Indonesian development of guerrilla warfare in its own struggle for
 independence from the Dutch (1947 -49), as well as tactics which must
 be used to combat rebel movements within the country or aggression
 from without.  This book is detailed and somewhat repetitious.  A
 large part of it is devoted to the text of instructions on organization
 and methods for Indonesian guerrilla use during the fighting against
 the Dutch.

 Brigadier Henniker commanded a brigade in Malaya, where he

 actions against the communist guerrillas in Malaya, together with the
 many problems encountered there.     Staff organization, small unit
 actions, and terrorist operations are all described.  The success of
 these counterinsurgent operations (as well as similar ones in Kenya)

 Pelagio A. Cruz, Vice Chief of Staff, Armed Forces of the
 Philippines. Appendices, including a brief history of the com-

 communists and Huk leaders.
 This book was originally published for instructional purposes,
 under the same title, at the Infantry School at Fort Wm. McKinley
 in the Philippines, 1956.
 Col. Baclagon was formerly Professor of Military Art,and Head,
 Department of Social Sciences, Philippine Military Academy and was
 former Commandant of the Infantry School, Philippine Army.  He was
 also Professor of History of Russia and Southeast Asia at the Far
 Eastern University.  He is the author of several books on military
 campaigns and tactics, largely in the Philippines.  This book is the
 result of the combined efforts of the members of the faculty of the
 Infantry School of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, who undertook
 a reexamination of the Huk Campaign.  The student officers at the
 school provided many of the analyses and theses which went into the
 writing of the book.  All were vetera~r.s of operations against the Huks
 during the Anti-Dissident Campaign.  Lessons from the Huk Campaign
 in the Philippines devotes a chapter to each of the twelve major lessons
 learned from the Campaign.  The students felt that the most important
 lesson they learned was the value of good and timely intelligence.  Other

 36. VALERIANO, Colonel Napoleon D. and Lt. Colonel Charles T. R. Bohannan
 Counterguerrilla Operations:  The Philippine Experience
 New York:  Frederick A. Praeger, 1962
 275 p.  Charts.
 The appendices contain material on patrol SOP for counterguerrilla
 operations and a suggested special warfare battalion.  A biblio-
 graphy is contained in Appendix III.
 Colonel Valeriano held active commands against the Huks during the
 counterguerrilla operations in the Philippines, 1946-1953.  Colonel
 Bohannan was JUSMAG advisor to the Armed Forces of the Philippines
 on unconventional operations at critical phases of the campaign.  Their
 book is a readable and authoritative study of counterinsurgency opera-
 tions against the Huks as well as including principles generally
 applicable in this field.  Of particular interest is the material on
 intelligence activities against the Huks and proposals for intelligence
 operations in future counterinsurgency programs.
 For a personal account of the Huk view of the insurgency, see:
 The Forest by William J. Pomeroy (New York:  International
 Publishers, 1963).  Pomeroy, an American living in the Philippines,
 and his Philippine wife joined the Huk field forces in 1950.  He lived
 and fought with them until captured by regular Philippine forces in
 1952.  This book gives interesting descriptions of Huk insurgency
 tactics as well as describing the impact of the counterinsurgent
 activities of the Philippine Government and its armed forces.

 37. THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.  SPECIAL OPERATIONS RESEARCH OFFICE
 Case Studies In Insurgency and Revolutionary Warfare:  Cuba 1953-1959
 Washington:  The American University, Special Operations
 Research Office, 1963
 173 p.  Illus. Map of Cuba.  Index.
 Foreword by Theodore R. Valiance, Director, Special Operations
 Research Office.  Technical Appendix, containing the conceptual
 frame of reference and summary of procedures for the study.
 This volume is one of a series of studies prepared by SORO under con-
 tract with the Department of the Army.  It was prepared from unclassified
 sources, with heavy reliance on secondary sources.  The book analyzes
 the Cuban Revolution from the standpoint of the economic, social and politi-
 cal factors inducing revolution.  It then describes the organizations corn-
 prizing the revolution and the techniques used to implement it by guerrilla
 and insurgency tactics.  Basically, this is not a study of strategy and
 tactics; rather it concentrates on the character and dynamics of the insur-
 gent movement in order to give a base for the development of policies and
 operations to counter similar situations.
 BAYO, Giroud, General Alberto
 150 Questions For A Guerrilla
 Boulder, Colorado:  Panther Publications, 1963
 86 p.  Illus.  Charts.
 Originally published under title of:  Ciento Cincuenta P_reguntas
 a un Guerrillero.  Havana:  1959
 General Bayo has a long record of revolutionary intrigue in the
 Caribbean area.     Born in Cuba, he was raised and educated in Spain (except
 for four years in New Orleans).    He served with the Republican Air Force
 during the Spanish Civil War, following which he returned to Latin America.
 In 1955, Bayo began training guerrillas in Mexico for Fidel Castro, and
 has been his main contribution to the Cuban revolutionary cause.  Because
 of his age, he did not take part in the actual fighting in Cuba, returning
 there only after Castro's victory in 1959.  Politically, Bayo is an extreme
 leftist and possibly a long-time communist.  This book, 150 Questions For
 A Guerrilla, is a general manual in question and answer form, for the use
 of Cuban guerrillas.  It is quite sound, insofar as theory is concerned, for
 those fighting in Cuba at the time of the revolution there.

 39. GUEVARA, Ernesto (Che)
 Che Guevara On Guerrilla Warfare
 New York:  Frederick A. Praeger, 1961
 85 p.  Illus.
 Introduction by Major Harries-Clichy Peterson, USMC Res.  Trans-
 lation prepared by the publisher, based on the U. S. Army translation
 and from a condensation prepared by Major Peterson.
 Guevara's book was originally published under title of:  La Guerra
 de Guerrillas.  Havana:  INRA, 1960.
 Guevara was born in the Argentine.  He joined Castro in Mexico and
 landed with him in Cuba in 1956. He was one of Castro's principal guerrilla
 leaders and was subsequently rewarded with high positions in the Castro
 government of Cuba, where he is ranked immediately behind Fidel and
 his brother Raoul.   This book includes such subjects as guerrilla organi-
 zation, administration, tactics and training.  Special attention is given
 to the guerrilla problems of the Cuban Revolution.

 The Bay of Pigs:  The Leaders' Story of Brigade 2506
 New York:  W. W.  Norton & Company, 1964
 368 p.  Illus. Map end papers,  Maps,  Index.
 Publisher's Note. Author's Note by Johnson.  Preface by the
 Brigade leaders.  Bibliographical Notes.
 Johnson was Assistant City Editor of the Washington Star, from which
 newspaper he took a leave of absence to write the story of the 1961 invasion
 of Cuba, in conjunction with the four leaders of Brigade 2506,  Johnson
 interviewed many of the members of the Brigade, as well as other Cuban
 exile sources and some members of official Washington who had knowledge
 of the events.  The kook covers the period from the start of the recruiting
 for the Brigade until the return of the prisoners from Cuba, following the
 successful negotiations for their release by James B. Donovan.  The Bay
 of Pigs is a useful book particularly in describing the insurgent training
 and operations of the Brigade.  However, the book is weak and sketchy
 about the planning and execution of the operation from the U. S. viewpoint.
