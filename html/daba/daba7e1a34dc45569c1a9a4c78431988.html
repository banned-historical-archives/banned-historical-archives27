 China: Foreign Trade Policy in the 1970s
 Central Intelligence Agency
 National Foreign Assessment Center
 Kev Judgments
 Policy and Politics
 ? A Chinese decision to expand foreign trade, made in the early 1970s,
 marked a return, on a larger scale, to the trade policies of the mid-
 1960s.
 ? Debate over this policy was one of the major features of the political
 struggle between the. radical and moderate factions within the Chinese
 leadership for the next several years.
 ? Leftist attacks were strongest during the Campaign To Criticize Lin
 Piao and Confucius (1973-74) and the Anti-Teng Hsiao-ping Cam-
 paign (late 1975 to autumn 1976).
 ? The trade debates aired genuine radical-moderate differences over
 foreign trade policy; they were also a vehicle for political opportunism.
 The real differences centered on the interpretation of self-reliance, but
 they were greatly magnified in the propaganda, as radicals sought to
 discredit their moderate opponents.
 ? The moderate faction's program, launched- in 1972, was highlighted by
 large-scale purchases of Western technology, increased use of credits,
 and an export drive to pay for imports.
 ? The strategy unraveled when the need for record agricultural pur-
 chases and Western inflation and recession led to a balance-of-
 payments crunch in 1974. Peking reacted by holding down imports in
 1975. Imports tumbled in 1976 as political infighting disrupted the
 economy and hampered planning.
 ? The basic policy still holds, however. It was reaffirmed repeatedly in
 1977, and trade levels recovered.

 ? Peking's traditional conservative reaction to economic forces, not
 politics, has been the dominant influence on the trade sector. Radical
 attacks may have slightly strengthened the reaction to balance-of-
 payments problems. Local dislocations stemming from political turmoil
 cut severely into imports in 1976. But the dominant influences were
 agricultural production and debt avoidance.
 ? A new major round of technology purchases will begin soon; the
 emphasis will be on lagging industries, such as steel, petrochemicals,
 electric power, and transportation. The better the agricultural situa-
 tion, the more funds will be available for industrial purchases.
 ? Concerted efforts are under way to increase exports, but they will bear
 fruit only slowly. One key to export earnings in the short run is the
 recently signed long-term agreement with Japan. For the longer run,
 the Chinese are seeking both to develop export industries and to
 improve marketing.
 ? Peking remains unwilling to admit to direct foreign borrowing but has
 adopted several techniques of obtaining only thinly disguised foreign
 credit. Further movement along this path is likely to be slow-but
 inexorable.
 ? China's foreign trade and financial policies nonetheless remain conser-
 vative. Trade is a small part of the economy-roughly 5 percent of
 gross national product. Self-reliance is the guiding principle which,
 since the Sino-Soviet split, has meant avoidance of dependence on any
 one country and cautious use of foreign credits. Under these circum-
 stances, dramatic changes in trade levels or patterns are unlikely.

 China: Foreign Trade Policy in the 1970s
 Background
 Since the founding of the People's Republic of
 China (PRC), foreign trade has been a small but
 important sector of the economy. The Chinese
 have always recognized the value and necessity
 of foreign trade as a means of making up for
 shortfalls in production, providing goods not
 available in China, and acquiring advanced
 technology.
 Economic and political necessity led to heavy
 dependence on the Soviet Union in the 1950s.
 The need to rebuild the economy amid the
 Western embargo on China led Mao to pursue a
 policy of "leaning to one side" by which China
 based its industrial and technological growth on
 a rapid buildup of trade with the USSR. Sino-
 Soviet trade-about one-half of China's trade in
 the first decade of the PRC-peaked in 1959
 when imports and exports totaled $2 billion.
 Imports from the USSR provided the major
 impetus to China's industrialization efforts, sup-
 plying both capital goods and industrial raw
 materials. Soviet aid provided $1.4 billion in
 credits and large amounts of technical assistance.
 The abrupt withdrawal of Soviet technicians-
 blueprints and all-in mid-1960 was a serious
 shock to the Chinese economy, already strained
 by the Great Leap Forward. Peking decided to
 reduce its dependence on the USSR. Sino-Soviet
 trade plummeted to 20 percent of the 1959 peak
 by 1965. China decided to pay off its Soviet
 debts ahead of schedule by running a hefty trade
 surplus with the USSR during 1961-65. The
 unhappy experience with Soviet economic co-
 operation left a deep impression on the Chinese
 that persists today in their reluctance to depend
 too heavily on any one country for trade or to
 incur large debts.
 After 1960 China reoriented its trade toward
 Japan and the West, shifting 80 percent of its
 trade to the non-Communist countries by the end
 of the decade. At first the principal impetus
 came from harvest failures that led to substantial
 grain imports. By 1962 the economy was recover-
 ing from the setbacks of the Great Leap and
 China turned to the West for increasing amounts
 of industrial supplies and capital goods. In mid-
 1963 Peking began to purchase complete plants
 and the services of 'Western technicians from
 Japan and Western Europe, financed in part by
 medium-term credits. By 1966 contracts for over
 50 plants worth more than $200 million had been
 signed.
 The Cultural Revolution (1966-69) cut short
 this resurgence in the trade sector. Economic
 disruption in 1967 hampered exports, and im-
 ports were cut in 1968, in part to correct the
 trade deficit. Trade relations with many coun-
 tries were strained by Red Guard harassment of
 foreign businessmen and technicians at plant
 sites. The plant import program was suspended
 and Techimport, the trade corporation for tech-
 nology imports, was dissolved in 1969.
 Foreign Trade Debates
 With the restoration of orderly economic plan-
 ning after the Cultural Revolution, the leader-
 ship-with Mao's approval-embarked on a pro-
 gram to accelerate economic development. The
 goals of this program, publicly revealed by Pre-
 mier Chou En-lai at the Fourth National Pco-
 . ple's Congress in 1975, were the Four Modern-
 izations: modernize China's agriculture, indus-
 try, science and technology, and defense by the
 end of the century. A key element of this pro-
 gram was a new emphasis on foreign trade,
 highlighted by large-scale imports of foreign
 technology, an export drive to boost foreign
 exchange earnings, and a more liberal credit
 policy. The apparent goals of the trade policy for
 the 1970s were:

 Approved For Release 2003/05/23 : CIA-RDP80T00702A000200060012-0
 ? Increased purchases of foreign technology to
 spur modernization and industrial supplies to
 meet the needs of the expanding economy.
 ? An export drive to increase foreign exchange
 earnings through expanded markets for tradi-
 tional goods and larger exports of raw mate-
 rials, particularly petroleum.
 ? Balancing total foreign exchange expendi-
 tures against total foreign exchange revenues;
 thus, a more liberal use of credits for capital
 imports and other forms of import financing.
 ? Expanded trade relations with all nations,
 regardless of social system, but without
 dependence on any one country.
 Debate over foreign trade policy in the 1970s
 has centered on the elusive Chinese concept of
 "self-reliance." While never officially defined,
 self-reliance has been described in such terms as
 "maintaining independence," "relying primarily
 on our own efforts," "keeping the initiative in our
 own hands," and "learning what is good from
 foreign countries." These ambiguous statements,
 of course, leave open a number of questions-for
 example, what is the proper level of foreign
 trade? What types of goods should be imported?
 How to balance technology imports with the
 need to develop indigenous technical capabili-
 ties? To what extent do export requirements and
 use of credits compromise independence?
 Throughout the foreign trade policy debates of
 the 1970s, it was possible to discern in the
 Chinese propaganda two opposing points of view,
 which, for the sake of simplicity, can be classified
 as "radical" and "moderate." It should be kept
 in mind, however, that the boundaries between
 these two competing persuasions have often been
 blurred and that the personalities allegedly sub-
 scribing to each view have sometimes changed
 sides owing to genuine conviction as well as
 purely political motivation.
 The Radical View
 In general, the radicals believe that large-scale
 imports of foreign goods undermine the faith of
 the Chinese people in the successof the revolu-
 tion. The radicals fear that exposure to capita-
 lists, capitalist-made products, and capitalist
 business procedures gradually erodes the "revo-
 lutionary will" of the masses, leading eventually
 to "revisionism." In addition, according to the
 radical view, China should never again rely on
 the outside world. China's leaders should rely
 instead on the "wisdom of the masses" in order
 to discover, develop, and master new technology.
 Reliance on foreigners, in the eyes of the radi-
 cals, would not only rekindle the latent sense of
 Chinese inferiority caused by a century of hu-
 miliation at the hands of the West but also
 make China vulnerable to future economic
 "blackmail."
 The Moderate View
 The moderates, who view China as a weak,
 vulnerable, and underdeveloped country, are con-
 cerned, above all else, with the ultimate goal of
 transforming China as rapidly as possible into a
 modern, industrialized state. Because the mod-
 ernization of a backward China requires the
 import of goods from the industrially and techno-
 logically advanced West, foreign trade is consid-
 ered by the moderates to be essential. Moreover,
 in contrast to the radicals, the moderates are
 concerned less about the possibility that China
 may become tainted with "revisionism" by deal-
 ing with the capitalist West and more about the
 much stronger probability that China will not be
 able to keep pace economically without the
 West's goods and technology.
 A brief review of the major foreign trade
 debates of the 1970s, which took place during
 two periods of intense political conflict among
 the Chinese leadership, provides much insight
 into the actual differences between radical and
 moderate foreign trade policies.
 The Campaign To Criticize Lin Piao and Confucius,
 1973-74
 During the course of the relatively brief but
 disruptive Campaign To Criticize Lin Piao and
 Confucius, many articles-usually allegorical in
 style-appeared in the Chinese media both at-
 tacking and defending the foreign trade policies

 Approved For Release 2003/05/23 : CIA-RDP80T00702A000200060012-0
 that were then being implemented by the moder-
 ates led by Premier Chou En-lai.
 In their rhetorical attacks, the radicals criti-
 cized the moderates' foreign trade policy, charg-
 ing the moderate leaders with such "crimes" as
 being "slaves of foreigners," "not relying on the
 masses," "trailing behind at a snail's pace," and
 being "agents of imperialism." The moderates, in
 response, defended their policies by emphasizing,
 usually with the help of a quotation from Chair-
 man Mao Tse-tung the importance of foreign
 trade in economic modernization.
 Perhaps the best defense of moderate foreign
 trade policies at the time was made in January
 1974 by Foreign Trade Minister Li Chiang in
 the lead article of the newly resurrected journal,
 China's Foreign Trade, which had ceased publi-
 cation during the Cultural Revolution. Although
 Li acknowledged the need for self-reliance in
 foreign trade and reaffirmed that China never
 intends to attract foreign investment capital,
 condone exploitation of domestic or Third World
 natural resources, or engage in joint ventures; he
 asserted that China does wish to participate in
 "negotiation by the two business parties in the
 light of common international trade practice"-a
 clear reference to more liberal financing proce-
 dures. To make his defense of "making foreign
 things serve China" legitimate, the Foreign
 Trade Minister quoted from a 1949 Mao Tse-
 tung statement which declared that the "Chinese
 people wish to have friendly cooperation with the
 people of all countries and to resume and expand
 international trade in order to develop production
 and promote economic prosperity." Interestingly,
 this obviously moderate statement was not again
 publicized in the Chinese press until after the
 purge of the "gang of four" (see below).
 The Anti-Tang Hsiao-ping Campaign (Late 1975
 to Autumn 1976)
 Radical critiques of moderate foreign trade
 policy, which had dropped noticeably in frequen-
 cy after early 1975, resumed in force during the
 campaign to discredit Teng Hsiao.-ping. The
 renewed upsurge in radical attacks undoubtedly
 reflected the rising influence of the "gang of
 four." Several of the "rightist" policies attribut-
 ed to Teng and severely criticized by the radicals
 were directly concerned with foreign trade. One
 Teng document, entitled, "Some Questions on
 Accelerating the Development of Industry" ("20
 Points," for short) proposed both the increased
 export of China's natural resources-especially
 oil and coal-in order to pay for advanced
 technology, and the signing of contracts with
 foreign countries "in accordance with accepted
 practices of international trade such as deferred
 payments and installment payments."
 The most common criticism of Teng's "20
 Points" made by the radicals was that Teng
 wanted to "sell China out to the imperialists."
 Rhetorically, these attacks usually took the form
 of charges that Teng attempted to turn China
 into a "raw material base," a "repair assembly
 workshop," and an "investment ground for
 imperialism."
 In addition, according to recent Chinese press
 accounts, the radicals extended their attack be-
 yond Teng Hsiao-ping to the Ministry of Foreign
 Trade, which they denounced as the "Ministry of
 National Betrayal." The radicals also criticized
 oil exports, denouncing them as "shifting the
 international energy crisis on the Chinese peo-
 ple." One report released in the Chinese media
 after the October 1976 purge of the "gang"
 accused the now-discredited radicals of having
 instructed their subordinates in Shanghai and
 Liaoning to convert certain coal-powered fac-
 tories to the use of oil, thereby creating an
 artificial "oil crisis" for which the moderates'
 export policy could be blamed.
 The Role of the Debates
 The polemical articles appearing in the Chi-
 nese media during the two periods of foreign
 trade policy debate appear to have served two
 purposes simultaneously. First, the articles aired
 honest differences between moderates and radi-
 cals over such issues as the type and amount of
 foreign technology to import, and the methods
 for financing these purchases. Second, the po-
 lemics provided a platform for the radicals to

 Approved For Release 2003/05/23 : CIA-RDP80T00702A000200060012-0
 attack moderate leaders through a frontal assault
 on moderate foreign trade policies.
 These two aspects of the foreign trade policy
 debates tend to cloud their role and purpose.
 Although differences between radicals and mod-
 erates did exist over certain foreign trade poli-
 cies, these differences were magnified in the
 media as each side attempted to discredit the
 other. On the other hand, the radical-moderate
 ideological disagreements cannot be entirely dis-
 missed as political opportunism.
 Foreign Trade-A Larger Role in the 1970s
 While the foreign trade policy debates were
 taking place, the moderates, led by Chou En-lai,
 continued to implement their newly formulated
 foreign trade policy. China improved relations
 with its traditional trading partners and opened
 trade relations with others, most notably the
 United States. Table 1 illustrates the rapid in-
 crease of China's foreign trade in the 1970s.
 Trade data in current US dollars, of course, show
 the effects of inflation and devaluation of the
 dollar as well as the growing volume. Neverthe-
 less, real growth in trade was substantial. The
 Communist countries benefited from the overall
 expansion of Chinese trade but did not improve
 their share.
 Technology Imports
 Signs of a more expansive trade policy began
 to appear in 1970-71 with a sharp upsurge in
 inquiries and negotiations for complete plants
 and increasing purchases of major items of ma-
 chinery and equipment. Techimport was recreat-
 ed as a separate trading corporation in Novem-
 ber 1972 and the first major plant contracts
 began to be signed that year. During the first
 half of the 1970s China purchased nearly $6
 billion worth of Western industrial plants, trans-
 port equipment, specialized machinery, and sci-
 entific instruments. These purchases have en-
 tailed the largest influx of technicians into China
 since the 1950s-some 3,000 Western techni-
 cians in the past several years. In addition, more
 than 2,500 Chinese have been trained abroad
 under these contracts.
 Complete plants have been the cornerstone of
 China's technology imports. Beginning in 1972,
 over 140 plants worth about $2.8 billion have
 been purchased. The pattern of plant purchases
 reflects Peking's wariness of becoming overly
 dependent on any one supplier. Contracts have
 been scattered among Japan, Western Europe,
 and the United States, with only Japan's share
 being more than one-third of the total. The plant
 program has concentrated on facilities for the

 petrochemical, metallurgical, and electric power
 industries with the twofold aim of acquiring
 advanced technology and permitting import sub-
 stitution for major commodities such as grain,
 fertilizer, steel, and cotton.
 Concealed Borrowing
 Since the repayment of its loans from the
 USSR in 1965, China has publicly prided itself
 on being a nation without debts. Although Pek-
 ing's financial policies are ultraconservative, this
 no-debt claim is a facade based on Chinese
 definition. Short-term credits of six to 18 months
 have been used since the early 1960s for pur-
 chases of Western grain and fertilizer, and sever-
 al plants in the mid-1960s were financed by
 medium-term credits from Japan and Western
 Europe. Use of five-year medium-term credits
 was resumed, but on a much larger scale, for i
 plant purchases in the 1970s. Contracts for com-
 plete plants totaling $1.5 billion have been fi-
 nanced under credits from Japan and Western
 Europe as of 1972. In line with China's conserva-
 tive financial policy, the financing has all been
 done with supplier credits-that is, the firm that
 supplies the plant borrows the money, and China
 repays the firm over five years with interest. By
 Peking's definition this method of financing is
 called "deferred payments," not loans.
 In addition to the plant credits and the con-
 tinuing grain credits, Peking began to tap other
 sources of short-term financing to support its
 increasing imports of industrial supplies.
 Export Drive
 China also launched a parallel drive to boost
 export earnings. Before the 1970s Chinese export
 goods were noted primarily for their low prices,
 which compensated foreign importers for the
 often frustrating deficiencies in style, quality,
 and delivery schedules. Beginning in 1972 work-
 ers were exhorted to increase production of ex-
 port goods and to improve the quality and pack-
 aging of these products. PRC trade delegations
 began to travel to many Western countries, trade
 agreements were signed with the growing num-
 ber of nations establishing relations with Peking,
 and China began to stage or participate in
 greater numbers oftrade fairs overseas. Empha-
 sis was put on increasing the proportion of
 manufactured goods in total exports and greater
 attention was given to raising prices to interna-
 tional levels. Finally, a major port improvement
 program was launched and China's international
 fleet was expanded to handle the growing trade.
 The export drive got added help in 1973 when
 the Arab oil embargo and OPEC price hikes
 created demand for China's newly available sur-
 plus of crude oil. Despite the relatively small
 quantities available, the premium prices asked,
 and the adverse refining characteristics of Chi-
 na's oil, oil exports soon became a sizable compo-
 nent of export earnings-11 percent in 1975-
 largely because of sales to Japan.
 The export drive was very successful, but not
 trouble free. The value of China's exports to the
 non-Communist world jumped sharply from $1.6
 billion in 1970 to $6.0 billion in 1976. Even in
 real terms, Chinese exports roughly doubled over
 the period. But problems arose in the course of
 the rapid expansion. Prices of some commodities
 at the 1973 spring Canton fair were set too high
 and had to be rolled back at the fall fair. A
 September 1973 NCNA article admitted that
 China could not produce enough to meet the
 needs of its growing foreign trade. Failures by
 the Ministry of Foreign Trade promoted criti-
 cism from Premier Chou himself.
 Trade Strategy Unravels
 Expansion of China's trade meant greater
 exposure to the vagaries of the world economy.

 bined with domestic agricultural setbacks to
 disrupt Peking's trade plans. by the, mid-1970s.
 Just as China began its major technology
 purchases,. poor harvests, especially in 1972,
 forced Peking to import record amounts of agri-
 cultural products at a time of tight world supplies
 and sharply rising prices. Imports of agricultural
 products jumped from $0.6 billion in 1972 to
 $1.4 billion in 1973 and then to $2.0 billion in
 1974. Meanwhile worldwide inflation was push-
 ing up the costs of China's imports of machinery
 and industrial supplies such as fertilizer and

 metals. Downpayments on the $1.3 billion in
 whole plant contracts signed in 1973 added to
 the financial burden.
 China's hard currency trade deficit hit $440
 million in 1973, more than five times the surplus
 level of the previous year but still manageable
 because of credit. financing. Although another
 substantial deficit was expected, Peking probably
 did not anticipate the deterioration in its balance
 of payments in 1974. The crunch came in the
 second half of the year as the bulk of repayments
 for grain credits from 1973 fell due and growing
 world recession cut demand for Chinese exports.
 Measures were taken to reduce foreign exchange
 outlays by canceling contracts and delaying de-
 liveries of agricultural products and scaling back
 purchases of machinery and equipment. Despite
 these measures the trade_ deficit with the West

 reflects not only a desire to trim back outlays for
 downpayments . and future machinery imports,
 but also the need for a breathing space to enable
 China to absorb the large amounts of technology
 already received or on order.
 In 1976 Peking probably intended to continue
 to restrain imports moderately in the face of
 lagging Western demand for its exports. Grain
 requirements were the lowest in years and equip-
 ment deliveries for whole plants were declining
 as the contracts from previous years were wind-
 ing up. Political turmoil, however, disrupted the
 economy, prevented agreement on the new five-
 year plan for 1976-80, and inhibited initiatives
 by the trading corporations. Imports from the
 West plummeted while exports continued to rise,
 largely unscathed by the disorders. The result
 was a record $1.1 billion trade surplus with the

 Trade in 1977
 Trade officials had cautioned foreign business-

 1977, despite the positive rhetoric, because it
 would be a year of rebuilding for the economy
 after the setbacks of 1976. On 15 January 1978,
 NCNA announced that exports and imports in
 1977 grew by more than 12 percent, reaching the
 highest total in PRC history with a favorable

 balance of foreign exchange. The trade surplus
 fell slightly short of the 1976 level. Imports
 rebounded, but remained well below 1974 and
 1975 levels. Agricultural imports-at least $1.5
 billion worth-and industrial supplies such as
 steel and nonferrous metals led the growth in
 imports. Exports, on the other hand, set a new
 record. Nonoil goods accounted for the bulk of
 export growth; petroleum deliveries probably
 posted only. moderate gains over 1976.
 The anticipated surge in new contracts for
 whole plants did not materialize last year-only
 three contracts worth about $60 million were
 signed. Delay in setting import priorities was
 probably the major factor, although the need for
 large-scale agricultural purchases may have
 raised concern over avoiding another balance-of-
 payments crunch as in 1974. Orders for major
 equipment did pick up steam, however, reaching
 around $200 million.
 An Assessment of the Impact of Economic and
 Political Factors on Foreign Trade Policy
 The interplay of global and domestic economic
 factors and Chinese politics is complex, and the
 relative impact of each of these forces on China's
 foreign trade policy and operations cannot be
 precisely weighed. The trade policy put forth by
 Chou En-lai in the early 1970s was still quite
 conservative by world standards. The share of
 trade in the overall economy never grew beyond
 6 percent of GNP-a small share even for a
 large country like the PRC-and China's foreign
 debt position was kept well within safe limits.
 Setbacks to trade expansion plans were due
 primarily to economic factors Peking could nei-
 ther anticipate nor control-the unfortunate
 combination of poor Chinese harvests and West-
 ern inflation and recession. Although the deterio-
 ration of China's balance of payments in 1974
 roughly coincided with the beginning of the
 Campaign To Criticize Lin Piao and Confucius,
 the resulting cutbacks in imports were typical of
 Peking's historically conservative reaction to
 large trade deficits. Criticism by radical leaders
 of imports may have strengthened this reaction,
 but the net effect was probably not great.
 This is not to say that politics did not play an
 important-albeit negative-role in China's for-
 eign trade policies of the 1970s. Many local
 political figures took advantage of the moderate-
 radical debates.- in -Peking in order to pursue
 disruptive factional causes at home. These local
 disputes frequently resulted in serious economic
 dislocations including factory work stoppages
 and railway workers' strikes, which indirectly
 affected the export industry. Although there is
 no evidence that ranking leaders within the
 Ministry of Foreign Trade were attacked by the
 radicals, there are reports that some lower level
 foreign trade personnel, both in Peking and the
 provinces, were intimidated by local followers of   25X1
 the "gang of four."
 The radicals, in short, acted as a negative
 rather than a positive political force in foreign
 trade policy. Despite the radicals' reported "con-
 trol" of the mass media, their domination of
 many local political organizations, and their oc-
 casional enlisting the support of Mao Tse-tung
 by playing upon the Chairman's fears that the
 moderates would eventually reverse his most
 "revolutionary" accomplishments (most notably
 the Cultural Revolution), the radicals failed to
 develop a positive policymak- i g force in the
 foreign trade arena. There were no purges of
 foreign trade officials; the foreign trade corpora-
 tions, including Techimport, continued routine
 operations; and foreign businessmen were con-
 stantly  reassured  that  basic  policy  was
 unchanged.
 According to several recent articles in the
 Chinese media, the radicals first went along with
 the moderates' foreign trade policies and even
 selected some of the future locations of imported
 complete plants, but subsequently "went back on

 their words" and attacked the moderates' trade
 policies "for ulterior motives," that is, power
 seizure.
 The failure of the radicals to develop or press
 an independent foreign trade policy reflects their
 lack of a power base within the foreign trade
 apparatus. Had they been able to seize power,
 they might have pursued a more restrictive. trade
 policy. Trade, however, would still be necessary
 and even the radicals admitted that some imports
 of technology were good if they advanced Chi-
 na's economic development. But, when the Hua
 Kuo-feng administration purged the "gang of
 four" in October 1976, the radicals were "nipped
 in the bud."
 Outlook for China's Trade Policy
 The Hua Kuo-feng regime was quick to publi-
 cize the important role foreign trade will play in
 the new leadership's overall developmental goals.
 Almost immediately following the ouster of the
 "gang of four," the New China News Agency
 released a dispatch from-the autumn 1976'Can-
 ton trade fair that quoted, for the first time since
 the January 1974 Li Chiang article in China's
 Foreign Trade, Mao Tse-tung's 1949 declaration
 of China's intention to trade with all nations in
 order to promote economic prosperity. Later, at a
 national agricultural conference in December,
 the new party chairman disseminated for the
 first time publicly a 20-year-old Mao speech
 entitled "On the Ten Major Relationships." This
 remarkably pragmatic speech, which was obvi-
 ously being used to place Mao's mantle on the
 new regime's moderate economic policies, includ-
 ed a section on foreign trade in which the
 Chairman declared that it is China's policy "to
 learn from the strong points of all nations and all
 countries" (emphasis added).
 During 1977, various articles in the authorita-
 tive party newspaper, People's Daily, and in
 other national media continued to reaffirm the
 importance of foreign trade to China's national
 economy. In addition, a national conference on
 foreign trade-the largest since the creation of
 the PRC-was held in July, both giving national
 attention to, and symbolizing the new leader-
 ship's -interest in,-Ioreign trade. Perhaps the
 clearest single statement on the foreign trade
 policies of the Hua administration was the article
 written by Foreign Trade Minister Li Chiang in
 the October issue of the party's theoretical jour-
 nal, Red Flag. Drawing on Lenin as well as Mao,
 Li restated the new regime's interest in foreign
 trade and remarked that, in accordance with the
 principle of "self-reliance" and with Chairman
 Mao's "Three Worlds Theory," China would
 export "our products in exchange for advanced
 technology, equipment, and materials that are
 needed in socialist construction in our country."
 Li broke some new ground in at least two
 areas: the production of export goods and trade
 practices. With regard to exports, Li stated that
 "bases" are to be established "at selected points"
 in order to increase the quality and stabilize
 delivery of "well-known brands." In addition
 foreign trade personnel will, according to Li,
 assume a more active role in supervising the
 actual production of export goods. Concerning,
 financial practices, Li suggested that China will
 loosen up its traditionally conservative policies by
 adopting "accepted practices in international
 trade," employing expanded use of deferred pay-
 ment financing, perhaps for longer terms.
 Overall, the Chinese have established clear
 priorities for imports and have decided to expand
 their exports of both traditional goods and natu-
 ral resources. Recently Li Chiang told a visiting
 delegation that China would import only the
 most advanced technology and a State Planning
 Commission official announced that "following
 development in industrial and agricultural prod-
 uct, China will sell more and more petroleum,
 coal, and other products to buy advanced equip-
 ment." In essence, these public statements reaf-
 firm the trade policies of the early 1970s. While
 these vague policy pronouncements leave room
 for liberalized interpretations of self-reliance, it
 is unlikely that the present leadership will go so
 far as to abandon the traditional ideological
 constraints on foreign trade.
 A gain in the political influence of the radical
 faction-an unlikely prospect in the near fu-

 ture-could affect trade if political turmoil again
 disrupted the economy. But, even if the radicals
 achieved power, trade would remain necessary
 and trade levels could not be cut substantially
 without damaging the economy. Any such cuts
 likely would be in the area of imported technol-
 ogy, and even here the radicals have admitted in
 their own propaganda the value of "some" for-
 eign purchases.
 Prospects for 1978 and Beyond
 Since the trade policies of the post-Mao re-
 gime are still essentially conservative, foreign
 trade is likely to expand at a relatively moderate
 pace-perhaps 10 to 20 percent per year-and
 not grow significantly as a share of the Chinese
 economy. Trade will continue its present strong
 orientation to the West. Even with improvement
 in political relations with the USSR and Eastern
 Europe, trade with the Communist countries will
 remain at around. 20 percent of China's total
 trade. The Communist countries cannot provide
 the types of advanced technology that China is
 seeking in the West, nor would they be willing to
 provide hard currency markets for Chinese
 exports.
 With a commitment to an active, albeit still
 cautious, foreign trade policy, economic factors,
 both domestic and foreign, will govern Peking's
 ability to expand trade. In general, China's
 success in increasing exports together with its
 willingness to use foreign credits will be the
 major constraints on import growth. In addition,
 year-to-year needs for agricultural imports will
 also affect the pace of technology purchases.
 Exports
 Concerted efforts are under way to improve
 export potential, but they will bear fruit only
 slowly. China's traditional exports of foodstuffs,
 textiles, light manufactures, minerals, and met-
 als face the twin problems of inadequate supply
 and limited foreign demand, particularly in the
 developed countries. Chinese trade delegations
 are roving the world seeking better knowledge of
 foreign markets; trading corporations are making
 efforts to produce goodsto      specifications
 and to ensure prompt delivery; two new trading
 corporations-China National Packaging Corpo-
 ration and China National Arts and Crafts
 Import-Export Corporation-have been estab-
 lished. There are even hints of intentions to
 establish specific export industries. But progress
 will be hampered by the fact that many of the
 products come from China's slowly growing agri-
 cultural sector. Higher levels of traditional ex-
 ports will also run into barriers from protectionist
 action by developed countries, particularly on
 sensitive products such as textiles and footwear,
 and from the growth of competing industries in
 the Third World.
 While increased sales of oil and coal have been
 discussed by Peking, the long-term potential is
 uncertain. Coal reserves are huge, but much
 investment is needed in this lagging sector. Cur-
 rent estimates point to declining supplies of oil
 for export by the mid-1980s. For the near term,
 exportable surpluses of oil exist; yet marketabil-
 ity is hampered by high prices, transport costs,
 _ and -undesirable refining characteristics. - More-
 over, Japan is the only viable major market. The
 long-term trade agreement (LTTA) signed. with
 Japan in February 1978 will secure a market for
 China's oil and coal although growth of these
 exports will be limited. Under the eight-year
 agreement, deliveries for the first five years will
 total 345 million barrels for oil and 9.2 million
 tons for coal. The quantities of oil and coal will
 rise slowly through 1981 to 1982 goals of 110
 million barrels and 3.7 million tons, respectively.
 Increased quantities for 1983-85 will be negotiat-
 ed in 1.981. Chinese exports of oil and coal under
 the agreement are to total $10 billion, with
 Peking purchasing an equal amount of Japanese
 plants and equipment in return. Yet to be settled
 are the knotty problems of Japanese interest
 rates for plant credits and sales of equipment
 restricted by the Coordinating Committee on
 Export Controls (COCOM).

 Although the ability to expand exports to pay

 Bank of China delegations to Japan and Western
 Europe in 1977 explored the possibilities of
 longer term credits. and direct borrowing from
 --Western banks. One area of particular Interest to
 Peking is the financing of plant imports through
 deposits by foreign banks with the Bank of
 China. This has been discussed with both West-
 ern Europe and Japan. The appeal, of course, is
 that this could be disguised as "normal banking
 practices" to enable Peking to maintain its no-
 debt facade. Financing of capital imports would
 make sense for the Chinese: larger amounts of
 plant and equipment could be purchased than
 current export levels would allow; higher export
 levels and any import substitution effects from
 the completed plants could ease the financial
 burden during the repayment period.
 Peking is in a good position to launch its
 import drive: the political situation has stabi-
 lized, the economy is recovering, trade has
 chalked up two years of record surplus, and
 repayments on the previous round of plants will
 begin to decline next year. Credit policies will
 probably be liberalized only gradually with Pe-
 king incrementally accepting slightly longer re-
 payment terms and adopting financing methods
 ports and exports and force Peking to make
 adjustments in its trade strategy.
 Ideological Limits
 The protrade rhetoric currently emanating
 from Peking raises the question of how far the
 foreign trade option might be pushed. Dramatic
 increases in trade would require an extremely
 broad interpretation, or even abandonment, of
 the Chinese concept of self-reliance. This devel-
 opment could only come about through a victory
 by an ultrapragmatic modernizer faction over
 opposition from both leftist and conservative-
 moderate rivals.
 The type of action that might be taken to
 expand trade would depend on the degree to
 which self-reliance is compromised. In ascending
 order Peking could decide to accept long-term
 credits but maintain the no-debt facade, openly
 accept direct loans, purchase plant and equip-
 ment on a compensation basis, or permit joint
 ventures in China. These, of course, are some of
 the very things cited by the Chinese as examples
 of Soviet revisionism. It would be possible, how-
 ever, for Peking to perform the proper semantic
 gymnastics to defend such actions.
 In recent months Peking has been pushing a
 line of new flexibility in foreign trade and fi-
 nance. Chinese officials have been considering
 trade and financing arrangements that they

 would not even discuss previously:
 ? Long-term credits and financing capital im-
 ports through foreign bank deposits with the
 Bank of China.
 ? Use of barter and compensation deals for
 plant purchases.
 ? Imports of materials for reprocessing for
 export.
 ? Plants producing goods specially for the Jap-
 anese market.
 ? Chinese compliance with international stand-
 ards on patents, trademarks, and copyrights.
 ? Cooperation with Japan on offshore petro-
 leum exploration.
 An NCNA article on the closing of the 1978
 spring Canton fair highlighted the "flexible prac-
 tices" used at the fair to promote exports. These
 included supplying goods under customer trade-
 marks and brand names, producing goods using
 customer-supplied designs and raw materials,
 bartering for some commodities, and flexibility
 in setting export prices and contract currencies.
 In expanding trade, acceptance of long-term
 credits probably presents the easiest ideological
 hurdle for Peking to overcome. Credits from the
 West are available and Western banks would
 likely cooperate with Peking suitably to disguise
 the loans. China appears to be taking the first
 steps toward accepting bank deposit financing.
 Barter and compensation deals would have
 appeal because export markets for Chinese pro-
 ducts could be secured when the plant contracts
 are signed. Chinese proposals for such deals,
 however, have met with lukewarm response.
 Joint ventures would be the most ideologically
 troublesome concept for Peking to accept be-
 cause they would involve direct foreign participa-
 tion in the Chinese economy. Having the foreign
 supplier bear the development risks in return for
 a share of the output would be very helpful to the
 Chinese, particularly in the area of raw materials
 and energy. In fact, Peking has approached
 Japanese and US firms on cooperation in exploit-
 ing its offshore oil resources.-While the extent of
 this cooperation. has not been detailed, foreign
 help with this costly and difficult task would
 make sense for China. Also, being "offshore,"
 such  foreign  cooperation  might  be  more
 palatable.
 While Teng Hsiao-ping and the other econom-
 ic pragmatists in the leadership appear to have a
 freer hand in pursuing more adventuresome
 trade practices, Peking continues to maintain
 that its basic policy of self-reliance is unchanged.
 Official statements still rule out direct loans,
 joint ventures, and foreign investment in China.
 In discussing China's interest in Japanese help
 with offshore oil development, Foreign Trade
 Minister Li Chiang made the point that China is
 willing to consider any form of cooperation with
 Japan, provided that these three principles are
 not violated. Also, on a recent visit to Austria,
 Tang Ko, the Minister of the Metallurgical
 Industry, tempered China's interest in foreign
 technology with caution over becoming depend-
 ent on foreign countries. He rejected loans, but
 noted that it is possible "to agree on a kind of
 installment plan." This need to square the new
 flexibility in trade with self-reliance may well
 indicate resistence by some members of the
 leadership.
 Despite the current pragmatic approach of the
 leadership to economic development, it does not
 seem likely that they would cast off their essen-
 tially conscrva"tive attitudes to embark on a
 massive increase in foreign trade. Economic con-
 straints-principally China's ability to expand
 exports'and to absorb technology-will be strong
 determinants of trade policy along with Peking's
 ingrained concern over dependence on trade and
 foreign participation and control of the economy.
 More likely, the leadership will pursue a policy of
 cautious trade expansion introducing more flexi-
 ble practices on a selective and limited basis. The
 definition of self-reliance will be stretched to
 justify their new practices, but the basic principle
 will not be abandoned.
