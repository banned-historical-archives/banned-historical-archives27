 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 Relations Between Communist China and Burma
 Summary
 Relations between Peking and Rangoon have been
 deteriorating steadily since last summer and are
 now worse than at any time since the border settle-
 ment in 1960.   This agreement ended a long period
 of tension marked by Chinese subversion in Burma
 and repeated small-scale clashes along the Sino-
 Burmese frontier.
 25X1
 Peking's shift in line last June--in large part-
 a reflection of domestic Cultural Revolution extrem-
 ism--has aroused increasing Burmese anxiety over
 Chinese intentions.   A full scale propaganda cam-
 paign in July denouncing the "fascist Ne Win clique"
 and a public declaration of Chinese support for
 Burmese Communist insurgents have apparently sparked
 new fears in the Burme:_;e Government that Peking is
 planning an intensified campaign of subversion or
 even military intervention of some sort.

 It was prepared by the Office of Current Intelligence

 Peking is probably now committed to a policy
 of hostility toward Burma and can be expected to do
 what it can to exploit the manifold domestic prob-
 lems besetting Rangoon.  The Chinese appear, how-
 ever, to have a sober and realistic view of diffi-
 culties they face in the situation and the evidence
 now available points to a long-range campaign con-
 ducted on a limited scale.  This could make serious
 trouble for Burma but would probably not threaten
 the existence of the regime.

 The Background of Sino-Burmese Relations
 1.   Prior to last summer, relations between
 Peking and Rangoon were outwardly harmonious, re-
 flecting a modus vivendi that had gradually deve-
 loped since 1960.   Burma retained its freedom of
 action without undue interference from the "co-
 lossus of the north" and was able to practice a
 foreign policy of neutrality and isolation.   China,
 for its part, benefited from an almost total exclu-
 sion of Western influence and presence in Burma,
 which served to create a buffer zone on China's
 southwest flank.  Ever mindful of a Burmese pro-
 verb that states,                        "When China spits--Burma swims,"
 Rangoon has traditionally taken great pains to
 avoid actions which could be construed as hostile
 to Peking, and has stoically accepted China's tend-
 ency to deal with Burma more as a vassal than as
 a sovereign equal. In 1961, Burma allowed Chinese
 military units to operate within Burmese territory
 against Kuomintang remnants that were eventually
 driven into Thailand.  The same year, Rangoon ac-
 cepted a credit of $84 million from Peking which
 made China Burma's primary source of foreign aid.
 The Chinese were probably further encouraged in
 1962 when Ne Win's new military dictatorship em-
 barked on a locally colored but highly inflexible
 variant of Marxist authoritarianism--the "Burmese
 road to Socialism."
 2.  Although Peking was, no doubt, initially
 satisfied by its accommodation with Ne Win, Chi-
 nese hopes for further benefits were quickly dis-
 appointed.                                 Under a facade of harmonious relations,
 repeated, and at times heavy-handed, Chinese ef-
 fort: to persuade Rangoon to lend itself to Chinese
 political and propaganda lines were almost com-
 pletely frustrated by Burmese xenophobia and devo-
 tion to noninvolvement in international affairs.
 Burma consistently refused to take an anti-US stand
 on Vietnam, limiting itself to a statement in July
 1964 of "concern" over the "grave situation" there.
 Rangoon was among the first to adhere to the par-
 tial nuclear test ban treaty, which Peking vehemently
 opposed, and also stubbornly refused to participate

 in the abortive Afro-Asian Conference of 1965 which
 the Chinese had hoped to dominate.
 3.   Peking also became increasingly dissatis-
 fied with the Burmese Government's internal pol-
 icies.  Among the first targets of Ne Win's drive
 to achieve state socialism were the approximately
 400,000 overseas Chinese in Burma.   In 1963 the
 two Chinese banks in Burma were nationalized and
 the assets of Chinese businessmen were seized.  Pe-
 king, however, adopted a tolerant attitude toward
 these moves and did not make a major issue over
 the plight of the overseas Chinese in Burma.  A
 far more serious point of friction emerged later
 in the year involving the pro-Peking Burmese Com-
 munist Party (CPB), which has been in insurgency
 against the government since 1949.   Although it
 withheld open support for the party, China had long
 harbored much of its leadership in Peking and had
 strongly advocated a settlement between Rangoon
 and the Communists which would provide for their
 participation in a coalition government.
 4.   In September 1963, Ne Win entered into
 talks with the Communist leadership, flown in from
 Peking by the Chinese.   His military regime, how-
 ever, had no intention of sharing governmental au-
 thority and the talks quickly broke down.   Pledg-
 ing complete destruction of the Communists, Ne Win
 began massive arrests of virtually every above-ground
 pro-Communist political figure in the country. A
 few months later Rangoon, fearful of possible Chi-
 nese support for the Communists,  closed down Peking's
 consulate in Mandalay for violation of propaganda
 restrictions while allowing the US consulate to re-
 main.
 5.   In spite of these affronts Peking continued
 to withhold public support for the Burmese Commu-
 nists and maintained the facade of close and friendly
 relations with Rangoon.   In July 1965, Ne Win paid
 a state visit to Peking and a month later hosted
 Liu Shao-chi and Chou En-lai in Rangoon.   In April
 1966, Liu made another trip to Rangoon accompanied
 by Foreign Minister Chen Yi.   The Chinese must have

 viewed these junkets, to some degree, as diplomatic
 failures since the discussions during the three
 visits produced bland and innocuous communiques at
 a time when Peking was making a concerted effort to
 win public support for its foreign policies from
 Asian "third-world" states.
 6.  In 1966, Chinese misgivings were probably
 strengthened by Burmese actions which indicated
 a desire to cultivate a more active relationship
 with the West.   Rangoon's new tactics, reflected in
 Ne Win's visit to the US in September 1966, were
 probably originally intended simply to reaffirm
 Burmese neutrality.  By early 1967, however, the
 Burmese Government was seriously considering the
 purchase of substantial quantities of relatively
 sophisticated US military equipment--a step the
 Burmese almost certainly realized would result in
 a deterioration in Sino-Burmese relations.  By the
 summer of 1967, Peking had few remaining illusions
 concerning the reliability or future usefulness of
 the Ne Win government.
 The Events of Last Summer
 7.  Last summer's sharp disruption in Sino-
 Burmese relations followed a general pattern of Chi-
 nese activity abroad that has marred Peking's rela-
 tions with most of the underdeveloped world during
 the past year and a half.   In Burma's case, the
 trouble stemmed directly from the Chinese Embassy's
 political activity among the local overseas Chinese
 population--a reflection of the Cultural Revolution's
 impact within the Foreign Ministry and on Chinese
 missions abroad.   Since early 1967, the embassy had
 been sending propaganda teams into the interior of
 Burma promoting the Cultural Revolution and distri-
 buting Mao Tse-tung books and badges.   Such overt
 interference among a local Chinese population repre-
 sented  a major tactical shift in the conduct of
 Chinese diplomatic missions, since Peking, hitherto,
 had been extremely tactful in its involvement with
 Chinese residents of ostensibly friendly nations.

 8.  When the Chinese Embassy ignored Rangoon's
 initial discreet complaints on the Mao propaganda
 issue, the Ministry of Education on 19 June banned
 the wearing of Mao Tse-tung badges at Chinese educa-
 tional institutions.  When the order was defied,
 apparently with the encouragement of the Chinese
 Embassy, various Chinese schools were closed as a
 disciplinary measure.   At this point, clashes be-
 tween Chinese and Burmese student groups quickly
 led to nation-wide anti-Chinese demonstrations and
 rioting.  The Burmese Government, which appeared
 to give silent approval to the demonstrations, was
 slow in restoring order and acted only after a
 member of the Chinese mission in Rangoon was killed.
 Although probably dismayed by the sudden turn. of
 events, the Burmese apparently wanted to impress
 upon Peking that the political activities of the
 Chinese Embassy were unacceptable.
 9.   Peking was quick to charge the Burmese Gov-
 ernment with responsibility for the anti-Chinese activ-
 ity and demanded protection for Chinese diplomats and
 nationals in Burma.   This was followed by massive
 demonstrations against the Burmese Embassy in Peking.
 The Burmese quietly rejected the Chinese protests,
 apparently hoping that Peking would eventually allow
 tensions to subside.   At this crucial moment, however,
 the Chinese launched a full-scale propaganda offensive
 against the "fascist Ne Win clique" and, most impor-
 tantly, for the first time gave public support for
 the Burmese Communist insurgents,  By taking such a
 step, Peking made it clear that its policy of accom-
 modation with Rangoon was being scrapped'in favor of
 an openly hostile stance toward "Burma's Chiang Kai-
 shek."
 10.   Relations between Rangoon and Peking grew
 steadily worse.   Approximately 450 Chinese aid tech-
 nicians were withdrawn from Burma in October at Ran-
 goon's initiative.   Only skeleton diplomatic staffs
 now remain in the two capitals and relations are
 virtually suspended.   Chinese propaganda since then
 has continued to call for a "people's revolution" in
 25X1
 Approved For Rele4se 2004/03/18 : CIA-RDP85T00875RP01100070007-2
 Approved For Releas
 Burma.   In addition to supporting the Burmese Com-
 munists, Peking has directed its propaganda at all
 discontented Burmese elements, hoping to capitalize
 on Rangoon's economic mismanagement and unpopular
 minority policies.   Faced with such hostility on the
 party of Peking and an increasing numb,:r of reports
 of Chinese support for both Communist and ethnic
 insurgents, the Burmese Government has resigned itself
 to the prospect of a complete break with Peking.
 The Impact of the Cultural Revolution
 11.  Peking's actions in the disruption of Sino-
 Burmese relations should probably be assessed within
 the context of the Cultural Revolution and the  Impli-
 cations it held at the time for Chinese foreign policy.
 Last June the Foreign Ministry in Peking had been lit-
 erally taken over by Red Guards and many of its respon-
 sible officials had been replaced by Maoi3t extrem-
 ists--fervent revolutionaries but inexpeir.enced in
 foreign affairs.  This development was reflected in a
 series of similar disturbances provoked by Chinese of-
 ficials in several other Asian countries.
 12.  Although Chou En-lai and the more moderate
 elements still remaining in the Chinese Foreign Min-
 istry probably would have preferred a more restrained
 response to Burma's "anti-Chinese" activities, thus
 preserving the status quo in Sino-Burmese relations,
 the long-growing  disenchantment with Ne Win probably
 undercut their opposition to the then dominant ex-
 tremists.   The destruction of the rdodus vivendi pre-
 viously existing between China and Burma can,  therefore,
 be viewed primarily as a by-product 'of the Cultural Rev-
 olution.   It probably did not signal a conscious, pre-
 meditated change in Chinese foreign policy and, in
 particular, does not seem to represent a new Chinese
 timetable for insurgency and "people's war" in South-
 east Asia.
 Chinese Support of Communist Insurgency in Burma
 13.   Peking has made it clear that the "people's
 war" it advocates in Burma is to be Communist-led.   The
 Communist Party of Burma  (CPB)'s 4,000-man guerrilla

 force, which operates primarily in the interior of
 Burma where government control and military capa-
 bility are greatest, has to date been little more
 than a nuisance to Rangoon.   Unlike Burma's ethnic
 insurgents, who fight for autonomy or independence
 from Rangoon, the CPB has,had no success in de-
 veloping a popular base.   In fact,  the open Chinese
 support for the party since last summer has prob-
 ably further lessened its appeal to the average
 Burmese peasant, who is generally anti-Chinese.
 14.   Despite the CPB's inef:E~ ctual record,
 Rangoon reacts with alarm to Communist insurgency
 since the Communists are ethnic Burmese who oper-
 ate in Burma's rice producing heartland.   It has
 been easier for the government to tolerate far
 more serious insurgency in the remote and sparsely
 populated minority areas.
 25X1
 The Chinese would find it extremely difficult to
 deliver aid to the CPB in that area because Bur-
 mese territory there is largely under the control
 of anti-Communist ethnic insurgents.   If the Bur-
 mese party can gain a significant level of coop-
 eration with these ethnic insurgents--something
 they have been unable to do in the past--and thus
 gain access to the Chinese frontier, the potential
 Communist threat to Rangoon would be significantly
 increased.
 15.   The relatively cautious approach Peking
 has taken with regard to the CPB since last sum-
 mer, however, indicates the Chinese see little
 prospect of developing an effectiv', Communist in-
 25X1                         surgency in Burma at present.   The Chinese have
 probably given the CPB only limited financial sup-
 port and some paramilitary training.
 and probably hopes that such low-keyed assistance
 will lead to a gradual strengthening of the Bur-
 mese organization.

 16.  A New China News Agency year-end status re-
 port on the CPB underscored this realistic assessment
 of tte party's immediate prospects.  While hailing
 a series of "brilliant victories," by the Burmese
 Communists, Peking stressed the lony-term nature of
 their struggle.   The Party was lauded for its 20-year
 effort to build a popular political base necessary
 for a successful "people's war."  It probably derived
 little comfort, however, from Peking's admonition that
 further "protracted struggles" lie ahead or from the
 implication that the CPB's bleak years of isolation
 and "self-reliance" were the correct environment for
 "party-building."  Peking's rosy picture of an "excel-
 lent revolitionary situation" in Burma seemed designed
 to cloak China's reluctance to commit itself to more
 active support of the party.
 in the Burmese Border Area
 Chinese Support for Ethnic Insurgency
 17.  Peking's potential for fomenting insurgency
 in Burma is much greater in the ethnic minority areas
 adjacent to the Chinese border.  This rugged and inac-
 cessible terrain is inhabited primarily by Kachin and
 Shan tribesmen who cling to a traditional animosity
 to Burmese rule.   In addition, there are a number of
 minor tribes in the area all of which resist Burmese
 rule to some degree.   The China Burma border has not
 been in dispute since the conclusion of a Sino-Burmese
 border agreement in 1960.   The boundary, however,
 winds through extremely rugged terrain and is virtu-
 ally impossible to police.                            As a result, the tribal
 inhabitants of the area are able to come and go across
 the frontier with relative freedom.  Except in major
 towns, Rangoon has never established control over
 this area, and much of the ter:itory has long been
 under the de facto control of insurgent armies.  Many
 of these insurgents, particularly some of the Shans,
 have degenerated into gangs of bandits or opium runners.
 The Kachin  insurgents, however, have maintained a
 relatively high degree of political motivation and prob-
 ably represent the most effective insurgent group in
 Burma..

 21.   There is no evidence, however, to suggest
 that the Chinese are trying to woo the ethnic insur-
 gents, such as by attempting to engineer the creation
 of a "liberated area" in northern Burma.  Even if
 Peking had the disposition and assets to undertake
 such action, the explosive political situation which
 now exists in Yunnan Province would probably seriously
 hamper such an ambitious 'undertaking.
 23.   Peking now appears committed to a policy
 of hostility toward Rangoon.   The Chinese may believe
 that the actions during the Summer and Fall have
 strained relations with Rangoon so severely that a
 return to the previous status of "friendly neutrality"
 is not possible in the near future.   There are indi-
 cations that moderate elements in the Chinese Foreign
 Ministry are trying to get Peking's foreign policy
 back into pre-Cultural Revolution channels.   They
 probably calculate, however, that even if they were
 free to adopt a conciliatory approach to Burma--which
 has recently affronted Peking again by ordering the

 expulsion of two New China News Agency officals from
 Rangoon--such a policy would offer little opportunity
 for Chinese exploitation.
 24.  The Chinese, however, do not appear as though
 they will embark on an adventurous course involving
 them in a major confrontation with the Burmese.   Peking's
 most recent public assessment of the situation in Burma
 took a sober view of the prospects for insurgency and
 avoided any explicit commitment to support the Bur-
 mese Communists.   The kind of small-scale assistance
 reportedly supplied by the Chinese suggests that they
 regard Burma's present mixed bag of insurgent groups
 as something less than a reliable and effective in-
 strument.  Peking is, moreover, diverted by serious
 domestic problems and by its efforts to support the war
 in Vietnam.
 25.   The evidence now available points to a long--
 range Chinese campaign conducted on a limited scale.
 The Me Win regime, like its predecessors over the
 pa:  c0 years, has always faced widespread insurgency.
 Al. ,,-,...gh a small Chinese-inspired and supported es-
 calation of subversive activity could impose a serious
 additional burden on the already thinly spread Burmese
 security forces, it would probably not pose a criti-
 cal threat to Rangoon.
