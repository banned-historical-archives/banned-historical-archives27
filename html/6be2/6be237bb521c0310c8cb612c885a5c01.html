 For, the fiscal year 1965, the Army "re
 quest for procurement of ammunition
 was $408 million.  In fiscal year 1966, in
 spite  of      Vietnam,  the  request for
 ammunition was $344.9 million. Even
 though` the fiscal year 1965budget re--
 quest for ammunition was made on the
 basis of real need for both current usage
 and to provide an adequate level of
 stocks,  during  the  hearings  it was
 brought out that only $272 million would
 be spent. This type of action has oc-
 curred in previous years. - Such large
 differences between what. is requested
 and what is finally spent raises serious
 questions as to what our actual stock
 level is relative to ammunition:
 Obviously this is a vital area and the
 current degree of action in Vietnam
 clearly dictates a high level of consump-
 tion.                   It has been reported that con-
 sumption of ammunition in Vietnam has
 quadrupled.
 A related area is spare parts and main-
 tenance.  During the course of the De-
 fense appropriation hearings, the Navy
 stated that the budget for the replenish-
 ment of spare parts is tight primarily
 due to stricter guidelines which were im-
 posed on them.  A principal Navy wit-
 ness stated:
 We will make every effort to operate with
 this level, but we are concerned and will
 have to watch very carefully any effect upon
 our ability to meet expanded requirements
 If those should come about as a result of
 the sputhgast A$ia operations in concern of
 the very long supply lines in that area.
 Certainly the problem of combat pay
 is particularly important, far beyond the
 basic fiscal considerations.  The Depart-
 ment of Defense issued a directive, No.
 134Q.6, on June 2, 1965, concerning the
 eligibility of military personnel to receive
 special "combat pay" for those subject to
 hostile fire.
 . Under the previous special pay policy;
 about one-fourth of the military per-
 sonnel serving in South Vietnam have
 been receiving hostile-fire  payments
 monthly. Under this new modified pol-
 icy, all U.S. military personnel serving
 in South Vietnam will be eligible for the
 special pay, unless certain areas are ex-
 cepted by the unified co4nmander. This
 new  policy is completely  warranted
 under existing conditions and if any-
 thing is overdue. In any event, this di-
 rective creates an increase. in personnel
 pay amounting to many millions of
 dollars, which was unprogramed and
 therefore not covered in the budget. We
 have been constantly told this is an ex-
 treinely tight budget, and in the area of
 pay there is not the flexibility as in
 other parts of the budget.
 Other items that further illustrate the
 inadequacy  of the fiscal year  1966
 budget, as they were either not pro-
 gramed or budgeted at the presently
 planned level include:
 The decision to significantly increase
 ground troops in South Vietnam.
 The Navy, it has been reported, has
 been spread thin, with the 7th Fleet
 now employing four and at times five
 -aircraft carriers off Vietnam and adding
 a new naval patrol command off the
 South Vietnamese coast,
 It ha:: been further reported that sur-
 face  shipments  of  material  have
 mounted to 125,000 tons a month, , while
 air shipments  have  reached  a  record
 35,000 tons a month. Imports of petro-
 leum products have increased to 500,000
 barrels a month.
 Also reported Is the probability that
 the new 1st Calvary "airmobile" divi-
 sion will go to Vietnam.  This is a new
 concept for which tests had recently been
 completed. The division will be larger
 than a normal Army division, having
 close to 16,000 men and will contain in-
 creased air capability particularly heli-
 copters for quick mobility.  There were
 no plans in the fiscal year 1966 budget
 to create such a division, much less to
 deploy it Into active combat in Vietnam.
 It has now also been reported that there
 is a distinct possibility that a second
 "airmobile" division will be created.
 This too was unplanned.
 It is a fact that we are carrying out
 added activities and that they must be
 funded. This should be accomplished in
 a timely, reasonable manner, completely
 in keeping with the right of Congress
 and the public to know how much is
 being spent, when it is being spent, and
 for what purpose.
 Considering the international situa-
 tion, we must be in a secure position mil-
 itarily.                                                                 This includes having an ade-
 quate budget which will provide for the
 current defense needs and equally im-
 portant, future emergencies.  Adequate
 money and adequate equipment must be
 provided for every unit at a proper level
 according to the table of organization
 and priority position. We have consist-
 ently been told the fiscal year 1966 de-
 fense budget is a tight budget.  Any
 budget manipulations to solve the prob-
 lems mentioned here must therefore have
 serious effects upon other programs un-
 less additional funds are provided. This
 must not be allowed to happen. For-
 tunately we have an opportunity to cor-
 rect this situation and maintain our high
 level of strength which now exists. The
 fiscal year 1966 Defense appropriation
 bill has not cleared the Congress and
 therefore the President can revise the
 defense budget, or submit a supplemental
 request Immediately.
 If this is not done, it will not merely
 be a question of having available ade-
 quate funds, but the additional question
 must then be raised as to what is this
 administration's approach to military
 preparedness.
 THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN
 .SPIRIT
 (Mr. MARTIN of Alabama asked and
 was given permission to address the
 House for 1 minute; to revise and ex-
 tend his remarks and to include extra-
 neous matter.)
 Mr.  MARTIN  of  Alabama.  Mr.
 Speaker, today I received a copy of a
 letter directed to a Member of the other
 body. The message it contained is so
 much needed today and so exemplifies
 the spirit of the true American char-
 acter, that I would like to share a part
 of this letter with you.  It was written
 by Mrs. Eva M. Harmon of Birming-
 ham, Ala., and contains this message of
 courage and indomitable spirit.  I in-
 clude this excerpt from Mrs. Harmon's
 letter as a part of these remarks:
 16433
 When i read of the rent subsidy proposal,
 I did not write.  I thought no Alabamian,
 no southerner would support it.  But I see
 by our local papers that you did.
 You mention housing for a number of
 groups.  What I want to know is, when is
 the Federal Government going to quit put-
 ting a premium on so-called poverty?  How
 many of our poverty stricken people will
 want  to try  to  better themselves  if the
 Government will do it for them, with no
 effort on their part?
 You spoke of the handicapped.  That is
 not exactly a foreign word to me. At 10
 months of age I had polio which left me
 handicapped, if you choose to call it that;
 at least it left me lame.
 When I was old enough to leave home and
 go out on my own, I chose a work that would
 be a real challenge to me-I wanted to be a
 linotype operator in a newspaper office.  At
 that time that was a man's job; in the past
 few years with more modern equipment, more
 women are employed.  When I went to Nash-
 ville, Tenn., for training, the instructor tried
 in every way possible to persuade me to take
 another course, even holding me up to ridi-
 cule before the entire class when I made an
 error.  Finally, at graduation time, he apolo-
 gized to me before the class.
 I say all that to say this: What's wrong
 with people working and taking care of them-
 selves without the Federal Government step-
 ping in with a handout?  There is a principle
 involved here, and I would like to see us get
 back to that good old American spirit of
 independence.
 I have always felt that it was my inalien-
 able right to work and take care of myself,
 and with God's help I have done it.  I had to
 work hard, I had to be better in my job than
 the men.  And now at 64 I think I still am.
 I have always enjoyed my work, and the
 fruits of my work.  Last December I fulfilled
 a  life-long  ambition-I  toured   the  Holy
 Land, going with a Billy Graham group.
 You say you have always voted for the aid
 programs and always will. Well, I just want
 to say I feel sorry for the people who will be
 denied the sasitfaction in their lives that I
 have enjoyed.
 Mr. Speaker, for this message from
 Mrs. Harmon, I say, "God bless her," and
 I express my deep thanks for giving us
 a message that should go to the heart of
 every liberty-loving American.
 YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE KEY CLUBS
 OF  THE  UNITED  STATES AND
 CANADA
 (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and
 was given permission to address the
 House for 1 minute and to revise and
 extend his remarks.)
 Mr.  DUNCAN  of  Tennessee.  Mr.
 Speaker, I would like to give special rec-
 ognition today to the young people of the
 Key Clubs of the United States and
 Canada.
 These high school clubs sponsored
 by Kiwanis International are render-
 ing valuable service to communities
 throughout our land.
 I know that my colleagues would like
 to join me in welcoming these young peo-
 ple to Washington, and I especially wel-
 come almost 100 Key Club members
 from Knoxville, Tenn.
 BETTS FINDS TAFT GRAVE ALMOST
 FORGOTTEN
 (Mr. BETTS asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1

 remarks.)

 Mr. BETTS.  Mr. Speaker, as you
 know, an Honor Guard is on duty at
 Arlington Cemetery in part to assist the
 many visitors who come there.  It was
 disappointing to learn that some of the
 Honor Guards do not know that Presi-
 dent William Howard Taft is buried
 there nor the general location of his
 grave.
 At several entrances to the cemetery
 large maps have been erected to guide
 visitors to particular points of interest.
 These maps list the Tomb of the Un-
 known Soldier, the Superintendent's Of-
 flee, Custis Lee Mansion, and President
 Kennedy's grave. Certainly the location
 of the graves of President and Mrs. Taft
 should be on such maps.
 Various trails have been established
 for visitors to follow in touring the
 cemetery and there are a number of
 signs pointing only to the Tomb of the
 Unknown Soldier and the Kennedy
 gravesite.  To my knowledge, nowhere
 in the cemetery is there any official rec-
 ognition of the Taft grave.
 If one finds the Taft grave and marker
 he is Immediately struck by the fact that
 the grounds surrounding it are not well
 kept, patches of grass are burned and
 the area needs to be raked and watere(L
 Perhaps a stone walkway up the hill to
 the grave would be in order and a small
 sign at the roadway pointing to the grave.
 This seems to the minimum attention
 that could be shown to a former Presi-
 dent of the United States. I would hope
 that such a proposal would be considered
 by those having responsibility at the
 cemetery.
 THE LATE HONORABLE ADLAI
 STEVENSON
 (Mr. REID of New York asked and was
 given permission to address the House for
 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. REID of New York.  Mr. Speaker,
 I believe that all Americans; indeed peo-
 ple throughout the free world and all
 Members in this House were deeply sad-
 dened at the tragic and sudden death of
 Adlai Stevenson in London yesterday.
 Mr. Speaker, Governor Stevenson died
 in the service of his country upholding
 the best Interests of the United States
 and the United Nations; man's best hope
 for peace.
 Mr. Speaker, his warm and enduring
 concern for the rights of man and for all
 these who are oppressed wherever they
 might be, and his eloquent voice on be-
 half of collective security and peace
 throughout the world, distinguished the
 efforts of the United Nations and will en-
 dure for many years to come.
 Governor Stevenson was a man of
 principle and of wit, a moving force for
 social and economic progress in our
 country, a voice of conscience at home
 and aboard, and a statesman who will be
 deeply missed in the councils of the na-
 tions of the world.
 Mr. Speaker, I join with every Mem-
 ber In this House in extending our deep-
 est sympathy to the members of his
 family.
 We shall not see his like again.
 "IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. BABY"-
 DISGRACEFUL AND DIGUSTING
 (Mr. BUCHANAN asked and was given
 permission to address the. House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. BUCHANAN.  Mr. Speaker, over
 2 weeks ago the CBS television network
 presented a 90-minute program entitled
 "It's What's Happening, Baby.- I have
 received letters, as I am sure many of my
 colleagues have, protesting against the
 contents of the program. "Disgraceful"
 and "disgusting" are two words which are
 repeated again and again in these letters
 of protest.
 It would appear that no Federal funds
 in any significant amount were expended
 on this program. The great part of the
 program was devoted to what passes for
 entertainment these days in some quar-
 ters.
 What concerns me is that the Federal
 Government apparently believes it must
 resort to this sort of perverted communi-
 cations because otherwise it would not be
 listened to by the Nation's young people.
 Mr. Speaker, I refuse to believe that
 this is the only way to communicate with
 teenagers, even with dropouts. Certain-
 ly, they are capable of understanding
 something more than the wafflings of
 "The Cannibals," and "The Headhunt-
 ers," two groups who cavorted about the
 stage that night.
 As I understand it, one purpose of the
 OEO is to improve, to raise the standards
 of the young. Well, you do not improve
 someone by pandering to his base in-
 stincts and by using the lowest possible
 denominator.
 Mr. Speaker, the commercials during
 the program urged the listeners to write
 to "New Chance, Washington." I suggest
 that unless the Office of Economic Op-
 portunity and Mr. Shriver and his aids
 reexamine their basic approach, it may
 be "Last Chance, Washington," to which
 the American people will be writing.
 We have one last chance, Mr. Speaker,
 to help these young by appealing to the
 best in them-not the worst; by Inspiring
 them, not entertaining them; by stretch-
 ing their minds and spirits, not numbing
 them. I, for one, refuse to accept the
 notion that the best way to communicate
 with young Americans is through African
 tribal rhythms.   It happened once.  It
 should not happen again.
 GALLAGHER INTRODUCES LEGISLA-
 TION  TO  VIRTUALLY ABOLISH
 THE USE OF "LIE DETECTORS" BY
 FEDERAL AGENCIES
 (Mr. GALLAGHER asked and was giv-
 en permission to address the House for
 1 minute with reference to a bill which
 he has introduced on prohibiting lie de-
 tector tests.)
 Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I am
 today  introducing  legislation  which
 would, In practical effect, prohibit the
 use of polygraph machines-the so-
 called he detector-by all agencies of, the
 Federal Government.  The only excep-
 tion would be in rare cases where there
 was extraordinary necessity to use such
 a device in protecting the national in-
 terest of the United States. Frankly, I
 doubt if these cases really exist or ever
 would exist. But the authority would be
 available in any event.
 It was more than 2 years ago that I
 requested the distinguished chairman of
 he House Committee on Government Op-
 erations [Mr. DAwsox], the gentleman
 from Illinois, to look into this practice.
 He responded immediately and directed
 the Foreign Operations and Government
 Information Subcommittee to sturdy this
 matter.  The subcommittee, under the
 able leadership of the gentleman from
 California [Mr. Moss], has done an ex-
 cellent job and is continuing to do so.
 In its report Issued March 22, 1965, the
 committee came to this conclusion on its
 very first page. Allow me to quote it to
 Members of the House:
 There is no "lie detector," neither machine
 nor human.  People have been deceived by a
 myth that a metal box in the hands of
 an investigator can detect truth or false-
 hood.
 Mr. Speaker, the committee found that
 the Federal Government has fostered
 this myth by spending millions of dollars
 on polygraph machines and on salaries
 for hundreds of Federal investigators to
 give thousands of polygraph examina-
 tions.  Yet research completed so far has
 failed to prove that polygraph interroga-
 tion actually detects lies or determines
 guilt or innocence.
 In addition, the committee found that
 the overwhelming majority of Federal
 investigators  who  operate  polygraphs
 have neither the qualifications nor the
 training for their work.  Most Federal
 agencies had such weak controls over
 the use of polygraphs that these opera-
 tors were permitted to give examinations
 without top-level agency approval.
 Individuals under interrogation are
 persuaded to disclose past indiscretions,
 and investigators often ignore the so-
 called voluntary nature of the examina-
 tion by noting in Government files any
 refusal to submit to the polygraph test.
 Compounding the injustice of these
 practices are the two-way mirrors and
 hidden microphones In these Federal star
 chambers.
 The committee further found that
 Federal investigators rely on these ex-
 aminations for everything from top
 security matters to minor pilfering cases.
 Thus, in the words of the committee's
 report:
 The polygraph examination has become a
 crutch in too many cases, replacing proven
 procedures  of  criminal  investigation  and
 serving as a weak link in our security system.
 Testimony before the subcommittee
 showed that the Federal Bureau of In-
 vestigation does not consider the poly-
 graph precise enough for screening its
 own personnel and job applicants.  Yet,
 other Government agencies and a num-
 ber of private industries use It for just
 that purpose.
 The committee's main recommenda-
 tion, in my opinion, was that the Fed-

 This is.a logical and reasonable solu-
 tion of our problem. The vast majority
 of countries in the world today produce

 'v jue ct tiie piece itself, but derive their
 Ah1e frpm, the credit of the Govern-
 ment which issues them. In this respect,
 they, are similar to paper money which
 constitutes a promise to pay rather than
 embodying any value itself.
 I support the solution recommended by
 the committee In this bill. -I believe that
 we are meetip.g a modern problem with
 modern means and that there will be no
 damaging effects on the commerce or
 credit of the United States. I will vote
 for this bill and I hope that it will pass.

 'HON..JEFFERY COHELAN
 Thursday, July 15, 1965
 Mr. CQHEL,AN.  Mr. Speaker, the New
 York Times, in its lead editorial of July
 14, has presented both a thoughtful and
 a sobering evaluation of the war in Viet-
 nam.
 l cgminend it to our colleagues for
 their attention:
 President Johnsen has confirmed what
 most people realize-that the United States
 is faced with"new and serious, decisions.." in
 meeting the challenge of Vietnam. Although
 it is still not officially acknowledged, the
 ITnited,~;tates is fighting a land war of stead-
 fly growing' proportions in Asia.  This is a
 momentous development In American history
 and it should be treated as such and not as
 a minor and soon-to-be-ended expedition to
 advise and i olrter,the Saigon government,
 A major effort, of great cost in men, money,
 and ,,materiel, stretching over a period of
 years, is now in sight. If North Vietnam and
 her Communist Chinese backer should give
 In after this monsoon or the next one, there
 will he reason fqr rejoicing; but this Is not to
 be expected. As a Times correspondent writes
 from Saigon, the South Vietnamese are close
 to, the point where they will be unable to
 carry on as the major fighting force.
 Until now this has been, largely a war of
 Vietnamese against Vietnamese. The general
 who ,commanded the Vietmi}3h against the
 k'renCh-I' guyen Giap  is commanding the
 Vietcong, and his tactics are proving as sue-
 cessfui today as they were then.  They are
 the salve guerrilla tactics that Mao Tse-tung
 -.used In defeating Chiang Kai-shek.
 :However, the United States is not going to
 be_worn down-and pushed out of Vietnam
 .as ,the French, were.., France., could not com-
 lnit the men,  lanes, ships, and materiel
 wh1q ,, tI   United States possesses in un-
 limifted, quantities.   At the same time 1_t is
 folly to send American troops to meet Viet-
 coll'g"gderrillas on their own terms in their
 chosen territory, far from their bases in tropi-
 cal  jungles.  Furthermore,  a  perennially
 shaky government in Saigon and poor Viet-
 nainese.Dill itary leadership at the top make a
 weak Ilsckstop.  There is always the possibil-
 itythat a future governmeiitin Saigon might
 as  the ,Americans toleave; thu's ending the
 to al'basis for the American presence; but at
 least this is one' problem that does not have
 to be faced now.
 At matters stand, the United States Is pre-
 sented with some difficult alternatives.  One
 is to establish. a series of unconquerable
 beachheads along the coast and a perimeter
 around Saigon, and then hold on until the
 situation changes and negotiations on hon-
 orable  terms  become  possible.     Another,
 which in our view would constitute a dis-
 astrous e'scalat'ion, would be tocarry'the war
 farther and more heavily into North Viet-
 nam, with the strong possibility of directly
 involving Communist China, not to mention
 the Soviet Union.  Another, equally disas-
 trous, faut. ior.,differerit :TeaBOrls, would, be a
 decision to get out now-an obviously un-
 acceptable  move                                                                                            under present  circum-
 stances.
 There are of course still other. alternatives;
 but of all these unpleasant choices, the best
 seems to be to dig in at a number of coastal
 strong points where the overwhelming Amer-
 ican naval and air superiority would be used
 defensively and with great effect.  This may
 in fact be shaping up as the American strat-
 egy; but if sb the American people should be
 prepared.  Corigreissought to be asked more
 definitively to face the fact that the country
 really is at war, and to take a greater burden
 of responsibility. The congressional declara-
 Von of last.sun.mer,and,the,$700,miilion_au-
 thorization-for Vietnagi seem almost irrele-
 vant at this stage.
 Vietnam is a different kind of war from
 Korea but it is a war, one that the Nation
 must recognize as such; and it Is time to say
 so.

 OF
 HON. CLARENCE D. LONG
 OF MARYLAND
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, July 15, 1965
 Mr. LONG of Maryland.  Mr. Speaker,
 a routine report by the Maryland State
 Police states that of the 37 persons in-
 jured in highway  accidents in 1 week,
 28 could have been saved from serious
 injury by the use of seat belts.
 The Community News, of Reisterstown,
 Md., published the summary of the re-
 port without comment.  The statement
 of Colonel Jarman, superintendent of
 State police,  whose men  investigate
 these accidents, is commentary enough.
 Colonel Jarman said:
 It is hard to understand the reluctance of
 the motorist to use seat belts.
 I include the story from the Commu-
 nity News in the interest of further
 motorist education:
 .FEW MOTORISTS USE SEAT BELTS
 Last week the Maryland State police in-
 vestigated 20 serious highway accidents in
 which 3 persons were killed and 37 Injured.
 The investigators are of the opinion that the
 seriousness of the injuries would have been
 lessened in 28 of the 40 cases, if seat belts
 had been in use.
 In only-1 of the 40 seats occupied by the
 persons killed or injured were seat belts
 a'eaiiable.  In* only two of these cases were
 they actually in use.
 "In  the_ light of the proven lifesaving
 capability of seat belts,"  'commented  Col.
 Carey Jarman, superintendent of the State
 police, "it is hard to understand the re-
 luctance of the motorist to use them.                                                                            I sup-
 pose a part of this reluctance is due to an
 attitude of "take a chance, it won't happen
 tome."'

 "The State trooper," continued the su-
 perintendent, "wants no part of this gamble
 with his life.  He knows the value of seat
 belts and he always buckles up before he
 starts."

 OF IDAHO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, July 15, 1965
 Mr. HANSEN of Idaho.  Mr. Speak-
 er, under leave for all Members to ex-
 tend their remarks on the Voting Rights
 Act of 1965, I wish to commend those
 who, acting in good faith, were not
 stampeded into supporting a measure
 which I consider to contain undesirable,
 unnecessary, and unconstitutional pro-
 'visions-and which discriminates not
 only against certain geographical areas,
 but even against the Negro who is now
 subjected to a numbers game based on
 an  arbitrary  50  percent participation
 figure.
 Mr. Speaker, I am not anti-civil-rights,
 nor ani,, I anti-vQtixlg-rights.
 On May 17, under previous order of
 the House, I took the floor to explain my
 position on the then pending voting
 rights bill.  In order that there may be
 nQ.,doubt as, to-my position, I repeat that
 statement at this point in these re-
 marks:
 AN ANALYSIS OF THE VOTING RIGHTS
 ---,--CONTROVERSY.         .  .
 (A speech by the Honorable GEORGE V. HAN-
 SEN, in the House of Representatives, May
 17, 1965)
 Mr.  HANSEN  of Idaho. Mr. Speaker, the
 honored and respected Mr. J. Edgar Hoover,
 Director of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
 tion, has recently made some remarks about
 civil disorders and civil disobedience-and
 zealots and  bigots and  racists-that we
 might well heed as we approach a decision
 on voting rights legislation.
 In the December 1964, FBI law enforce-
 ment bulletin, distributed to all law enforce-
 ment officials, Mr. Hoover said, in part: "Our
 society today is in a great state of unrest.
 Many citizens are confused and troubled.
 For the first time, some are confronted with
 issues and decisions relating to the rights
 and dignity of their fellow countrymen, prob-
 lems which? heretofore they had skirted or
 ignored,
 "We have In our midst hatemongers, bigots,
 and riotous agitators, many of whom are at
 opposite poles philosophically but who spew
 similar doctrines of prejudice and intoler-
 ance. They exploit hate and fear for personal
 gain and self-aggrandizement.  They distort
 facts, spread rumors, and pit one element of
 our people against another.    Theirs is a
 dogma of intimidation and terror."
 In a speech delivered in New York on De-
 cember, 12-1064, on crime, and subversion in
 the United States-and referring to some of
 the persons and groups involved-Mr. Hoover
 said, "And I include the false liberals of the
 extreme left, such aas,the Communist Party,
 as well as the counterfeit patriots at the fa-
 natic limits of the far right, such as the Thu
 Klux Man-, who not only take the law into
 their' own hands on,gpgasiop= but,who would
 use the Constitution and laws of the Visited
 States to defeat the very purpose for which
 they were drafted-liberty and justice for

 Also--in the words of Mr. Hoover In testi-
 mony, on January 29, 1984, before a House
 appropriations subcommittee: "Turning to
 the subject of Communist interest in Negro
 activities, the approximate 20 million Negroes
 in the United States today constitute the
 largest and most important racial target of
 the Communist Party, U.S.A.  The infiltra-
 tion, exploitation, and control of the Negro
 population has long been a party goal and
 is one of the principal goals today."
 After stating that the Communist has no
 honest desire to better the status or condi-
 tion of the Negro, Mr. Hoover said, "Com-
 munists  *  *  * capitalize on the adverse
 propaganda effect that reports of discrimina-
 tion and oppression in the United States can
 produce in the eyes of the rest of the world,
 particularly among the African and Asian
 peoples; that is, the idea that this country
 is against equal rights for all races."
 As to the number of Negroes who have
 joined the Communist Party, Mr. Hoover had
 this to say: "The number of Communist
 Party recruits which may be attracted from
 the large Negro racial group In this Nation
 is not the important thing.  The old Com-
 munist principle still holds: `Communism
 must be built with non-Communist hands.'
 "We do know that Communist influence
 does exist in the Negro movement and It is
 this influence which is vitally important.  It
 can be the means through which large masses
 are caused to lose perspective on the issues
 involved and, without realizing it, succumb
 to the party's propaganda lures."
 This, Mr. Speaker, I believe to be a sig-
 nificant part of the current controversy over
 civil rights and voting rights.  Unquestion-
 ably, the vast majority of those involved in
 the disputes are sincere, honest, and dedi-
 cated persons.  However, on both sides there
 are those who masquerade behind ill-founded
 social, moral, political, and religious concern
 to practice intolerance, provocation, intimi-
 dation,  and  even  downright  lawlessness
 which all too often plays into the hands of
 our International enemies. Racial bigots and
 human flotgam only serve to detract from
 legitimate causes and, by their actions, cloud
 the real issues at stake. And it is the actions
 of these minorities within the two camps
 which make a difficult situation almost im-
 possible.
 The trouble is compounded by the presence
 of Communists who, though not necessarily
 the originators of demonstrations, at times
 push them to extremes. Dr. James N. M. Na-
 brlt, Jr., president of Howard University, one
 of our country's leading Negro colleges, has
 said he has ,seen known Communists in a
 student picket line.  Of the infiltration of,
 Communists into civil rights groups, Dr. Na-
 brit said, "They are, people who cloak them-
 selves in the mantle of civil righters and,
 plot and plan in secret to disrupt our fight
 for justice and full citizenship.  They must
 be unmasked for 'the frauds they are,  They
 must be fought in every arena, and 'they
 must not be allowed to prevail."
 Some Negro leaders, unlike Dr. Nabrit who
 clearly recognizes the peril of Communist In-
 filtration of the civil rights movement, have
 admitted that Communists do exist within
 the organizations, but gay they have no influ-
 ence.  Unfortunately, the tactics and tech-
 niques of the Communists are not always ap
 parent to these leaders, thus enabling the
 Red agents to carry on their nefarious work
 undetected.
 The average person, in attempting to eval-
 uate the racial situation and pinpoint the
 real problems;, is frequently frustrated and
 puzzled by. contradictory contentions and
 overstatements.  It is obvious that critics of
 civil rights demonstrations are prone to min-
 imize any good elements in the movements,
 and emphasize only the sordid and ugly. On
 the other hand  supporters tend just as
 strongly to overlook the undignified and dis-
 graceful actions of some of the civil rights
 groups and emphasize only the altruistic and
 philosophic goals they themselves have set.
 Those supporting civil rights groups often
 tend to play to the hilt any acts of violence
 which occur, while, conversely, such violence
 has often been played down and even con-
 doned by those opposing these movements
 and the perpetrators let off with a slap on the
 wrist by "juries of their peers."
 To me, these positions appear to be un-
 tenable.  It is difficult for me to see the com-
 patibility between civil disobedience-which
 is advertised as nonviolent, but which is cer-
 tainly provocative of violence-and-the win-
 ning of the Nobel Peace Prize.  It is equally
 difficult for me to see the compatibility be-
 tween pleas for the sovereignty of local gov-
 ernment and the unpunished bombing of
 churches and the midnight rifle shot on a
 lonely road.
 Neither side, Mr. Speaker, is in a position
 to criticize the other for violations of the
 law. How can the one criticize the other for
 terrorist tactics when it, itself, decides which
 laws are "good" and which are "bad" and
 then obeys only the "good" laws?  And how
 can the other side criticize this course when
 some of its members apparently feel that
 laws against murder are not valid and need
 not be obeyed When such laws interfere
 with what they consider to be their "rights?"
 Ours is a process of law-of law and order.
 This process in America has never been both
 mother and stepchild of hysteria-which too
 often allows the rabble of contending sides
 to predominate in killings,  intimidations,
 immoral conduct, and the like.
 The Government of the United States,
 through its many years of growth from a
 small group of colonies to the greatest nation
 the world has ever known, has always placed
 the impartiality of law above the whims of
 man.   That  law  has  always  contained
 processes for meeting and correcting social
 injustices; including the right of petition,
 the enactment of legislation, and access to
 the courts.
 Contrary to the belief held by some, the
 United States is not merely a democracy, it is
 a constitutional Republic.  It is important
 to note that political philosophers over the
 centuries have held that a pure democracy
 is the worst possible form of government,
 leading to impulsive and precipitous action
 by a sometimes hysterical majority, or mob,
 triggered by emotional circumstances.
 . Our  constitutional  Republic,  with  its
 various checks and balances, provides the
 processes that help protect us from the worst
 in ourselves.  At times these processes may
 seem unduly slow and cumbersome-it may
 even seem that they are roadblocks prevent-
 ing progress.                                                             But it is. these roadblocks,
 lacking in a pure democracy, which give our
 constitutional Republic its strength and sta-
 bility and provide for lasting solutions to our
 problems.
 No one can deny, Mr. Speaker, that great
 strides have been made in the eradication
 of social injustices in the United States in
 recent years.  Some of the actions which
 have- attempted to give to all our citizens
 the rights and responsibilities inherent In
 our. Constitution have come voluntarily from
 the private sector of our social order; some
 have been accomplished through legislation;
 some by directives of the executive branch;
 and some by the various levels of our courts.
 'We are moving forward, but I believe there
 is still a long way to go.  I also believe that,
 when we speak of civil rights and'the equal-
 ity of all men, who too often confine our
 thoughts to the Negro and the problems he
 faces,  and  disregard    the  many  injustices
 heaped upon the American Indian and for-
 eign nationality groups concentrated in the
 shuns and ghettos of our larger cities. These
 groups, lacking. the.potent political poten-
 tial of the Negro, are often left to suffer and
 shift for themselves.
 By the same token, when we refer to vot-
 ing rights we are prone to think only of
 practices which deprive a man of his vote.
 Abhorent as this practice is, equally as ab-
 horent-and  almost  as  prevalent-is  the
 practice of negating a man's vote through
 fraudulent voting, ballot box stuffing, and
 other illegal election practices. While un-
 told numbers, particularly in the South, are
 denied the right to vote, there is also sub-
 stantial evidence that untold numbers, par-
 ticularly in large cities, have their votes can-
 celed by fictitious names and tombstones.
 Mr. Speaker, it is my firm belief that ade-
 quate machinery does now exist under pres-
 ent                                                                                                         laws  and  under  the  14th and  15th
 amendments to the Constitution-if properly
 implemented by conscientious officials-to
 correct voting injustices and to attain the
 goals which some are trying to accomplish
 through demonstrations involving civil dis-
 obedience which, no matter how well in-
 tended, subvert the very rule of law itself.
 In this connection, I am convinced that
 any administration, political party, group or
 individual exploiting civil disobedience for
 self-aggrandizement is toying with a very ex-
 plosive and possibly destructive force.
 This course of action makes us vulnerable
 to the designs of the cunning Communist
 who, by infiltration, deceit, and the perpe-
 tration of any crime in the name of Com-
 munist triumph, has subjugated more than
 half the people of the world.  The Commu-
 nists have perfected the technique of "divide
 and conquer" to a point never envisaged by
 another recent group who employed this
 method-the Nazis. Communist imperialistic
 designs  and subversive activities have set
 Chinese  against  Chinese,  Korean against
 Korean, Cuban against Cuban, Vietnamese
 against Vietnamese, and now are attempting
 to set American against American at every
 opportunity.
 Now-as stated previously, we already have
 the laws necessary for the eradication of
 social injustice.  Prolonged apathy by var-
 ious Departments of the Federal Government
 in seeing that these laws are applied is
 largely responsible for current controversies
 and  the  resultant  demand  for  drastic
 Federal action-action which I deem to be
 unnecessary and, in some cases unconstitu-
 tional.
 As an example--article I, section 2 of the
 Constitution and the 17th amendment give
 to the States the right to determine voter
 qualifications, and the 10th amendment pro-
 hibits the Federal Government from doing
 so.  By the same token, the 14th and 15th
 amendments provide that no discrimination
 shall occur.
 Hence, to me it is basic that the States
 can legally prescribe any tests or require-
 ments for voting, consistent with the Fed-
 eral Constitution, which the electorate of
 that State will approve.  Then, and to me
 this is also basic, it is up to each of us,
 beginning with the lower subdivisions of
 Government, to see that these tests are
 applied without prejudice or discrimination.
 If violations occur at the local and county
 levels, then the State should exercise its au-
 thority.  Only if the State refuses to do this
 (and obviously there are cases where this is
 so), should the Federal Government have the
 right and duty to step in.
 Emphatically, I believe that we, as citizens,
 should do everything legally possible at all
 levels of Government to overcome existing
 inequities.       Had more concerted action been
 previously taken, we would not now be under-
 going great emotional disturbances such as
 the current civil. rights demonstrations,
 Hasty, poorly conceived legislation de-
 signed to bridge the gap created by poor
 enforcement of existing laws, holds out false
 hope to those concerned.  Rather than pass-
 ing arbitrary legislation and resorting to un-
 constitutional processes in an attempt to
 cure the evils which beset us, I believe the
 more valid answer lies in proper enforcement
 of existing laws and adequate education.

 was understandable since they remem-
 bered Abraham Lincoln as the emainci-
 pator and the democratic strategy was
 still based on the solid South plus one or
 two of the larger Northern States.
 I am very sure that in those days no
 Republican Congressman from Michigan
 would have dared to join with Southern
 Democrats in watering down a ,voting bill
 intended to open the polls to Negro voters
 in States where now they are'all but dis-
 franchised.
 NEGRO VOTE KEPT ILLINOIS REPUBLICAN
 My adopted State of Illinois for many
 long years was hopelessly Republican,
 but this was largely true because the
 Negro vote was overwhelmingly Repub-
 lican.. It may come as a surprise to some,
 but it is worth noting, that in all the
 long years that Illinois was safely in the
 Republican column. the margin of. Re-
 publican victory as a rule was less than
 the Negro . Republican vote.  In those
 years no. Republican Congressman from
 Illinois would have dared to join with
 Southern Democrats in watering down
 a, voting bill intended to, open the polls,
 to Negro voters in States where now they
 are permitted neither to register nor vote.
 The first political speech that I made
 was in the African Methodist Church in
 Benton Harbor when I was a high school
 boy. I was courteously received and was
 accorded a bit of applause at the con-
 clusion of my remarks, the sort of en-
 couragement that good hearts give to
 beginners, but I doubt that I made any
 converts "to the democratic cause,
 The Negro vote was loyally, solidly in
 the Republican column, and it remained
 there year after year, election after elec-
 tion, despite the fact that Congress after
 Congress, overwhelmingly under Repub-
 lican control, did absolutely nothing to
 change the registering and voting prac-
 tices of Southern States that closed the
 door on Negro voters.
 BIPARTISAN CRUSADE/ OF MORALITY
 Mr. Chairman, interrupting briefly the
 continuity of what I have to say, I pause
 here to remark that in the legislative
 pursuit of objectives of morality there is
 no place for the play for partisan ad-
 I deeply regret that in the consider-.-
 tion of the present bill there has been a
 departure from that which we witnessed
 in this Chamber in 1964 and which gave
 thrill and inspiration to all mankind,
 Democrats and Republicans working side
 by side for a cause in which all believed
 and cherished so preciously that none
 would think to mar with partisan grasp-
 ing the purity of the crusade of morality.
 The plain blunt truth is that the wa-
 tering down of this bill would mean the
 defeat of, all for which good people of
 both parties have so long and valiantly
 been battling.  If this were not already
 apparent to everyone, certainly it became
 as plain as.the hand held before the
 eyes when opponents of civil rights and
 voting reforms-urged the adoption of the
 Republican substitute over the adminis-
 tration, b li

 It, is true the legislative medicine in
 the administration bill is strong,'but may
 I respectfully suggest that ills as deeply
 rooted as those we attack are not sub-
 ject to the aspirin treatment.
 INFLUENCE OF GROWING-UP YEARS
 Now, Mr. Chairman, I shall return to
 a narrative of the circumstances of my
 upbringing that afford the reason for my
 being what I am.  In my sincere accept-
 ance of all men as my brothers, I ap-
 preciate, too, that others who grew up in
 a different social climate cling loyally
 and with the same sincerity as do I to
 the order and the philosophy of their
 growing-up years.  In time they will
 come to accept the changes that have
 come and to know that it is all for the
 best.
 Change, Mr. Chairman, is life. With-
 out motion, which is change, there would
 be no life.
 There is no permanent status quo, al-
 though it happens that an established
 order endures through several genera-
 tions, its gradual diminution unnoticed,
 and. its adherents come to look at it as a
 permanent  and  sacred thing.  Then
 comes the revelation, of the change that
 has been taking form all the years, and
 it comes as a shock,
 The fact is, Mr. Chairman, that what
 the 88th Congress accomplished in the
 enactment of the most sweeping civil
 rights law in history and what the 89th
 Congress is on the eve of accomplishing
 with the enactment of a voting law that
 really and truly will open the ballot boxes
 to our Negro fellow Americans did not
 come of a sudden and unannounced.
 RIGHT  OUTLIVES  THE  FOOT THAT CRUSHES IT
 They were long in coming, but each
 year brought them closer.
 Right is immortal. It may be crushed
 to earth but it outlives the foot that
 crushes it.     That is the story and the
 history of mankind.  That is the lesson
 of the ages, illustrated in every upward
 push of man in his long climb from
 the caves, after. each slipping back, ulti-
 mately another forward plunge that
 reached heights never before attained.
 Mr. Chairman, I came to the Congress
 in 1949.  I then was 67 years old and
 had lived a full life. I resolved that in
 this body as long as the good Lord gave
 me the strength and my constituents at
 home in their goodness returned me I
 should never spare myself in combat
 against discrimination in every form and
 in  every  manifestation  whenever  it
 showed its ugly face.
 I have been in every fight for civil
 rights and for voting equality, for laws
 against lynching and poll taxes, and all
 the line of cruel and undemocratic prac-
 tices, since I have been a Member of this
 body.  In  several  Congresses I have
 served with other Democratic and Re-
 publican colleagues on bipartisan joint
 steering committees for civil rights legis-
 lation, I always have felt, Mr. Chairman,
 that the advancement of morality and
 equality knew no party lines, and, as a
 rule, such has been the case.
 IN JULY 9 YEARS AGO
 In the civil rights fight in 1956, now 9
 years ago, I made the following remarks,
 A3783
 which are as timely now as then, and
 which I'reiterate at this time:
 Mr. Chairman, when I walked in the
 sunshine to the Capitol today I was
 thinking that there was some seasonal
 significance in the timing of this historic
 debate. We are in the last fortnight of
 July and all the signs are of a summer
 in its full enraptment. Yet the change
 came on June 21, when the days started
 to shorten and since then summer has
 been on the path of death. That is the
 way of life. Life is change. There is no
 enduring status quo.  But the change
 from one order to another is not imme-
 diately discernible. Man is reluctant to
 embrace change until by nature it is
 forced upon him. He fears the unknown
 and the untried, but when it comes creep-
 ing upon him and engulfing him he finds
 in the climate of a new order the ex-
 hilaration of one who has climbed tedi-
 ously a mountainside and having at-
 tained the peak looks out upon the vista
 of a new world.
 I have listened to my colleagues from
 the Southland who have stood gallantly
 on the edge of a lost battlefield fighting
 for an order that they sense, if they do
 not know, is gone forever.  There have
 been many such instances in the long
 history of man's climbing to higher
 plateaus of human dignity and human
 contentment.
 Because I am older than many of my
 colleagues, I can look back further.
 There are two ways of understanding
 the present as it is related to the past.
 One way is by reading of the experiences
 of the yesteryears, another way, un-
 derstanding through the experience of
 having lived in those yesteryears.
 On this afternoon in late July, when,
 though the sun be shining, summer is
 already nearly a month on her path of
 death, may I take you back with me to
 the era when the 19th century was rush-
 ing onward, to be engulfed by the 20th
 century.  Political  philosophers  then
 were saying that wherever the banana
 grows man is incapable of self-govern-
 ment: A President of the United States
 publicly proclaimed that he had never
 broken bread with a Negro. John L. Sul-
 livan disclaimed being champion of the
 world because he said he would not lower
 the white race by entering the. same ring
 with Peter Jackson, a Negro.
 That was the era in which something
 transpired that left me with an ineffacea-
 ble memory.                                                                                      It was before the turn of
 the century. The memory that with me
 is ineffaceable is framed. with the vivid
 background of a gorgeously beautiful
 sunset in the tropics.   My father was
 talking to a great physician of South
 America, one. of the outstanding, physi-
 cians of the world at that period. This
 man had been eloquent in the expres-
 sion of his affection for the United
 States.  My father remarked that hav-
 ing such great admiration for our coun-
 try he hoped that this great physician
 someday would visit our shores.  The
 expression  on  the  physician's face
 changed.  "That I cannot trust myself
 to do," he said.
 "I want always to go on admiring the
 great contribution that the United States
 has:.madeto.all the world and,to, au, Of

 mankind, but if I went to New York or
 Chicago and were not admitted to one
 of your hotels because there is Negro
 blood in my veins could I understand?"
 Later a few years there was another
 experience. I was on duty with two Cu-
 ban Negro soldiers, penetrating within
 the Spanish lines at Santiago. We were
 lost in hostile territory.  We had one
 canteen of water and that one canteen
 of water we passed one to the other with-
 out the thought that some of the lips
 that touched the canteen were white and
 some were black. Never after that could
 I understand why in my own country,
 and in my own northland at the time,
 the dining rooms and public eating
 places were closed to those not of the
 white race.
 Mr. Chairman, we have come a long,
 long way.  The old order as far as the
 North is concerned is all but gone. The
 old order as far as the South is con-
 cerned is in the late July of a dying sum-
 mer. Industry in the South is expand-
 ing. Ahead of the South lies a future of
 prosperity beyond the rosiest dreams of
 the old plantation days.  The fears of
 the gallant little band of my colleagues
 making the last stand for the status quo
 will be proven as groundless as were the
 fears of countless other gallant little
 bands in the long history of the world
 making the last stand for the status quo.
 Again change is ushering in new orders
 advancing the dignity and the content-
 ment of mankind.  The bill we in the
 House will pass this week will mark an-
 other milestone in our country's march
 to meet her destiny as the servitor under
 God of all mankind.
 NEAR THE END OF LONG HARD FIGHT
 Mr. Chairman, those remarks were
 made in this Chamber 9 years ago this
 month of July. Even 7 years before that
 we had fought all through the day and all
 through the night until near 5 o'clock in
 the morning for some semblance of
 recognition of the civil rights of all
 Americans. I was happy and felt privi-
 leged that in this it was given unto me to
 play my part, small though it may have
 been, I then being in my first term.
 It indeed has been a long hard fight.
 With the enactment of H.R. 6400 I shall
 have a sense of security that the cause
 of equality in opportunity, in the enjoy-
 ment by all Americans of the blessings,
 responsibilities, and privileges of running
 this country of ours, at last is planted on
 firm ground.  This is a good bill and it
 will open the polling places to all Amer-
 icans of good repute regardless of race or
 color.
 Mr. Chairman, ours will be a greater
 and a happier country because of what
 now we are about to do.  Strength that
 is rested on morality is an enduring
 strength.  A representative democracy
 in which all citizens share according to
 worth and without distinction on lines of
 race, color, religion, station, sex, and may
 I add age, inevitably must produce the
 kind of government that never can be
 wiped from this earth.
 No race can live alone.  By all of us
 blessed with American citizenship work-
 ing together, one for all and all for one,
 voting together and working together on
 a basis of equality and mutual respect, all
 that the Lord of our creation intended
 for us will fall to our lot.
 I think, too, Mr. Chairman, that we
 have learned that in the world of today,
 narrowed as it has been by quick means
 of transportation, no nation can live
 alone.  Surely if we as-a nation have set
 the pattern in unity envisioned in the
 legislation we are here considering its
 influence cannot be lost on the world.
 JUDICIARY, A HARD WORKING COMMITTEE
 I cannot close without adding my voice
 to the universal acclaim of the great
 chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
 Mr. CELLER, whose stout championship
 of the cause of civil rights during many
 long years constitutes an epic in the legis-
 lative history of our country. I also join
 in expression of appreciation of the large
 contribution of  the gentleman from
 Colorado [Mr. ROGERS], the gentleman
 from New Jersey [Mr. RoDINO], and
 the others on the committee who worked
 so long and so faithfully in a difficult and
 complex field, and not forgetting William
 R. Foley, the able and dedicated general
 counsel of the committee. While I regret
 that the distinguished ranking minority
 member of the Judiciary Committee, Mr.
 MCCULLOCH, loaned his name to the wa-
 tered-down substitute here offered, I
 cannot forget, nor should the country
 forget, that he stood, shoulder to shoul-
 der, with Chairman CELLER in the stir-
 ring days in 1964 that ended with the
 enactment with bipartisan support of the
 greatest civil rights law of all times.
 I think, Mr. Chairman, all my col-
 leagues will- agree that the quality and
 character of the membership both Demo-
 cratic and Republican of the Judiciary
 Committee is extraordinarily high, a
 source of pride to all of us.
 Research Grant to Montana State
 University
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ARNOLD OLSEN
 OF MONTANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, July 15, 1965
 Mr. OLSEN of Montana.  Mr. Speaker,
 under leave to extend my remarks in the
 RECORD, I include the following KBMN
 radio editorial:
 [A KBMN (Bozeman, Mont.) radio editorial,
 July 15, 1965]-
 M.S.U. GRANT
 My fellow Montanans, recently the Na-
 tional Aeronautics and Space Administration
 has announced a grant of $100,000 to Mon-
 tana State University at Bozeman for research
 in space science and engineering.  This grant
 is to support a broad integrated program of
 space-related research activities which are
 being carried on at the Bozeman campus.
 The research supported by this grant will
 include projects in atomic physics,  astro-
 physics, botany, bacteriology, and chemistry.
 The grant is directed toward the progress of
 pure science in these areas and is a small
 example of the massive effort our Govern-
 ment is making in financing pure science
 research.  The money is well spent.  Pure
 science is the basis of tomorrow's inventions.
 Without this work, thepractical applications,
 improving our lives in the future, will not
 be forthcoming.
 A wonderful example of this type of de-
 velopment is the Early Bird Satellite which
 was recently put in space by the Communi-
 cation Satellite Corp.  We are now in in-
 stant  radio and TV communication  with
 Europe and Japan, and we are expecting
 commercial use of the satellite in the near
 future.  But this would not have been pos-
 sible if the road had not been paved by re-
 search and development sponsored by our
 Government.
 There is no direct profit to be derived from
 pure science research, and, because of this,
 the business community is reluctant to in-
 vest money for it.  Moreover, the amounts
 needed are far too great for even the largest
 businesses in the country.  Our Government
 must provide the necessary funds.
 The $100,000 grant to the Bozeman campus
 is a compliment to the fine educational in-
 stitution there, and it makes me proud to
 know that fellow Montanans are participat-
 ing in the American effort in space.  I want
 to congratulate those involved in the work,
 and I wish them the best of luck in their

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. RAY J. MADDEN
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, July 15, 1965
 Mr. MADDEN.            Mr. Speaker, the fol-
 lowing editorial from the Christian Sci-
 ence Monitor reveals in a few words a
 message, the spirit of which, if followed
 through will be the most sensible path
 toward the Vietnam settlement.
 A TALE OF Two TALKS
 We believe that American Ambassador at
 large W. Averell Harriman has done right to
 go to Moscow.  We also believe that British
 Prime Minister Harold Wilson was right to
 send his friend, Harold Davies,  to Hanoi.
 For, even though nothing concrete comes
 from either visit, each is an earnest that the
 English-speaking world is ready to talk, to
 talk again, and to keep right on talking in,
 the hope of reaching a negotiated end to the
 Vietnamese conflict.
 The United States, with the welcome help
 of its British ally, owes it to itself and to
 the world both to overlook no chance for
 peace talks and to keep on trying to bring
 them about.  These efforts are a, token of
 moral strength, not of weakness.  They are
 also wise statesmanship, for it is essential
 that Washington prove to the world that
 American involvement in Vietnam is on be-
 half of justice and not of neocolonialism.
 During the past quarter century there have
 been few Americans whom the Russians have
 gotten to know better or have a stronger rea-?
 st,n to trust than Mr. Harriman.  While his
 presence alone will not dispel the deep So-
 viet-American rift which has grown out of
 the Vietnamese crisis, it should serve as an
 indication to Moscow that Washington still
 values "peaceful coexistence" with the So-
 viet Union and continues to hope that the
 time will come when Moscow feels able to
 take some further initiative to bring about
 peace talks o-,, southeast Asia.
 Similarly, Mr. Davies' visit, which got short
 shrift in Hanoi, will help make it clearer to
 the Afro-Asian world which side it is that
 is seeking talks and which side is turning
 them down.  Prime Minister Wilson has not
 had an easy time over the Davies' visit and

 he is to be commended for having persisted.
 It is also to be hoped that Hanoi's cold-
 shouldering of Mr. Davies will help lay a per-
 sistent oversimplification widely held in Eu-
 rope and also believed in some American
 quarters: The American bombing of North
 Vietnam is what prevents peace talks.  The
 Communists refuse to talk because they be-
 lieve they will win.  Once let them lose that
 belief and the bombing in the north will
 speed their rush to the conference table.

 to continue support is reflected in the
 resolution which passed the House last
 Tuesday.  When the interim 20 years
 between foundation and maturity are re-
 examined, we must marvel at the rela-
 tive degree of stability which has been
 achieved in the world through U.N.

 Its detractors are quick to jump at its
 weaknesses and to obscure its accom-
 plishments.  They . ignore  totally  the
 humanitarian work done through the
 various social and economic programs,
 through UNESCO,  through UNICEF,
 through the Food `and Agriculture Or-
 ganization. Millions of children have re-
 ceived relief fund dollars and'diet staples
 in lands where there are no welfare pro-
 ,grams to help those with no means of
 support.  Millions of poverty stricken
 farmers have received technological help
 and scientific aid where their own gov-

 antagonists in the world council he
 served so faithfully as the U.S. Ambas-
 sador.  Another is the universal sadness
 and sense of loss felt around the world
 today.
 Ambasador Stevenson had the facility
 for cutting into the heart of any matter
 and the ability to express his ideas in a
 forceful manner.  He will long be re-
 membered as a champion of liberty and
 peace.  The memory of his mission, his
 loyalty to his country, his unceasing quest
 for freedom for all, and his humaneness
 toward all mankind will surely inspire all
 of us in some measure as we seek the ful-
 fillment of his goals.
 Eight Thousand Pounds of Killer Whale
 on a "Leash"
 Mr. PATTEN.  Mr. Speaker, as we
 commemorate the 20th anniversary of
 the United Nations we cannot help but
 look in retrospect at the state of the
 world 20 years after World War I and
 20 years,after World War II. It is neces-
 sary to compare the war-ravaged, total-
 itarian-ensconced world of 1939 with the
 prosperous and flourishing free world of
 today. In this way the effectiveness of
 the United Nations as a peacekeeping,
 world-stabilizing  organization  will be
 crystal clear. It is evident that the world
 is today troubled in southeast Asia and
 in the Carribean.  However, one must
 look at the world in 1939 to see the
 marked difference in international affairs
 since the inception of the world organi-
 zation.
 The powers never really straightened
 themselves out after Versailles at the
 conclusion of the war that was fought
 "to end all wars." A lack of cooperation
 both at home and abroad doomed the
 Versailles  settlement  to. failure and
 American refusal to cooperate trans-
 formed a potentially powerful League of
 Nations into a floundering and ineffec-
 tual debating _ organization, unable to
 halt the onslaught of the Nazi-Fascist
 tyranny.  Obstinancy and shortsighted-
 ness did irreparable damage to world-
 wide hopes for a peaceful future. The
 dream of avoiding, a second war was
 smashed on the rocks of party politics
 and ethnocentric narrowness,
 The German march into Poland, the
 Italian attack on Ethiopia, and the Jap-
 anese  takeover  of  Manchuria  were
 marked by a reproving word, but by lit-
 tle action. The impotency of the League
 unmistakeably brought nearer and ac-
 celerated the, horrors of World War II.
 In 1045 the executive, legislative and
 diplomatic leadership of the country
 were determined that such a tragedy
 must be averted in the future.  At San
 Francisco they designed the framework,
 of a united organization which would npt
 crumble helplessly as the League did,
 A bipartisan coalition insured national
 support for the, international program.
 Inactivity,in the twenties and thirties
 was, supplanted by intervention in the
 forties and, fifties. The United States has
 not swerved from its position of firm sup-
 port in the past decades and its desire
 institute programs of their own.  These
 accomplishments are real and are being
 perpetuated every day.
 Besides these achievements the United
 Nations has played the integral role in
 its 20 years of age as the peacekeeper of
 the world. U.N. mediation stopped fight-
 ing in Palestine in 1948 and in Indonesia
 in 1949. U.N. military action ended the
 Korean war in 1953 and a U.N. Emer-
 gency Force resolved the Suez crisis in
 1956. An observer task force negotiated
 a peace in Lebanon in 1958.  Each of
 these incidents could easily have been
 the catalyst for a third war-existence
 of the U.N., however, averted such dif-
 ficulty and resulted in a more peaceful
 world.
 There is no question in my mind, Mr.
 Speaker, that the world has been made
 safer and better by the existence of the
 United Nations.  Although there is ten-
 sion and conflict today in the Far East,
 it would be greatly intensified if there
 was no peacekeeping organization of all
 the nations.
 The 20 years under the leadership of
 Trygve Lie, Dag Hammarskjold and U
 Thant have been a testimonial to world
 cooperation. Let us hope that the mem-
 ber nations will continue to act in a
 spirit  conducive  to  permanent  peace
 through reason and justice.

 HON. FLOYD V. HICKS
 OF WASHINGTON
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, July 15, 1965
 Mr. HICKS.  Mr. Speaker, two enter-
 prising young gentlemen from my home-
 town of Tacoma, Wash., have under-
 taken a whale of a project.
 They have, to oversimplify it a bit, put
 an 8,000-pound killer whale on a leash
 and are leading him home.
 James S. Griffin, a Tacoma business-
 man, and his brother, Ted, who operates
 an aquarium in Seattle, bought the killer
 whale in Namu, British Columbia, and
 with great ingenuity, substantial outlays
 of cash, and the help of many people
 and organizations are moving the sea-
 going giant 400 miles south to Seattle.
 The whale and his escorts are expected
 to arrive at Seattle next Monday.
 There the whale,  whose  name is
 "Namu," will take up residence in Ted
 Griffin's aquarium for all to see. Namu
 also will be the object of intensive sci-
 entific study, for he is the only killer
 whale in captivity in the world.
 Mr. . Speaker,  Tacoma's  waterfront
 reporter, Don Hannula, has told this
 entire modern saga of the sea in the
 Tacoma News Tribune.  To permit my
 colleagues to share the thrills and vicis-
 situdes of the Griffin brothers, Namu,
 and others involved in this adventure, I
 am pleased to present Mr. Hannula's
 story in its entirety.

 EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS OF KILLER WHALE
 ON A "LEASH"
 Tacoma fuel dealer Jim Griffin will tell you
 frankly that he doesn't know the difference
 between a guppy and a goldfish.
 But all of a sudden, Griffin, vice president
 and  general                                           manager  of  Griffin-Galbraith
 Fuel Co., has a whale of a fish problem,
 Seems his brother Ted, a former Tacoman
 who now operates the Seattle Marine Aquar-
 ium, bit off more than one man could chew
 when he decided to bring a 22-foot, 8,000-
 pound killer whale 400 miles from Namu,
 British Columbia, to Seattle.
 The whale, accidentally caught by two gill-
 netters off Namu, June 1, was put on the
 block for sale after the fishermen constructed

 a gtllnet prison.  Griffin bought it for $8,000,
 but that was just the beginning of his
 financial problems.
 -               MONEY DISAPPEARING
 Already he has close to $20,000 sunk in the
 venture.
 Ted, 29, asked brother Jim, 28, for assist-
 ance in raising money to get the whale to
 Seattle.  Jim has a simple explanation for
 his involvement in Ted's killer whale adven-
 ture which has received nationwide atten-
 tion :
 "He's my brother."
 Another Tacoman, Point Defiance Aquarist
 Don Goldsberry, has been playing a leading
 role in the effort to bring the world's only
 captive killer whale to Seattle.  On leave of
 absence from his job, he has lent his expert
 advice to Ted Griffin since the start.
 "If it hadn't been for Don Goldsberry,
 they probably would not have the whale
 now," Jim Griffin said.
 Keeping the whale confined has been a
 struggle since the beginning.  As many as
 80 other killer whales patrolled the confine-
 ment area apparently waiting to make a
 rescue attempt.
 But they disappeared last Wednesday.  It
 is expected they will be back at the side of
 Namu  (Klingit  Indian  language meaning
 "many winds") the killer whale before the
 long haul south is over.
 IN THE BAG
 Friday, Namu was in the bag and en route
 to a new home.  lie was driven Into a spe-
 cially constructed pen of oil drums, nets
 and steel tubing.  The tiny Seattle tug Rob-
 ert E. Lee, operated by disk jockey and chan-
 nel 11 television personality Bob Hardwick,
 was unable to tow the big pen, so Griffin
 hired a 78-foot seiner, the Ch.amiss Bay, to
 pull the pen to Point Hardy, about 100 miles
 south on the northern end of Vancouver
 Island.
 It was expected to arrive in Point Hardy
 this evening.  There the whale will remain
 in calm, protected waters until the Griffin
 brothers are ready for their next move.
 GET ASSISTANCE;
 Saturday, the Navy and the Fish and Wild-
 life Service offered help, but they did not
 have facilities Immediately available.  Jim
 was able, however, to get help from Drew
 Foss, who volunteered the tugboat, lvar Foss.
 The tug left Tacoma Saturday and expects
 to begin hauling Namu from Point Hardy
 by Monday night.
 Even with the 55-foot tug and its 6-man
 crew pulling the whale, Foss said it probably
 could not make more than 2 or 3 knots
 without breaking up the pen which is con-
 fining the whale.
 A Navy floating drydock had been consid-
 ered to haul the whale to Seattle, or even an
 Air Force Globemaster, Jim said.
 In all it would take an estimated 7 to 10
 days for the trip.
 Meanwhile,  Namu,  the  friendly  killer
 whale, seems content to eat about 200 pounds
 of fresh salmon a day for a $100 daily food
 bill.
 Jim Griffin who talked to brother Ted by
 phone said the whale seemed to like its new
 pen.  It had been feared the whale wouldn't
 eat once inside the pen.
 But, Namu is consuming 200-300 pounds
 of salmon a day now, Ted told his brother
 Saturday.  He said fishermen come along
 side and throw fish to the whale to see him
 react.
 "Ted said the whale was eating fine inside
 the pen," Jim reported.  "But he'll only take
 fresh salmon.  If they throw him an old
 salmon, he throws it back."
 There had been rumors that Ted Griffin
 might want to put his killer whale tempo-
 rarily in the Titlow Lagoon here.  Presently
 the lagoon owned by the metropolitan park
 district but leased to the State fisheries de-
 partment is free of salmon fingerling.
 However, Ted Griffin said, if he can get the
 whale to Seattle that's as far as he will go.
 HAS TANK
 When he built a 100,000-gallon tank last
 summer for porpoise and seals, he con-
 structed one bigger than his needs demanded.
 He did this with the hope that he would
 someday realize his burning ambition to
 capture a killer whale alive.
 Griffin says the tank is suitable for the
 whale if he can ever get it to Seattle,
 Brother Jim related that Ted seemed "de-
 pressed" the last time they talked by phone.
 It's  understandable-with  $20,000  sunk
 into a whale which could break loose at any
 time. Then there's the matter of raising an-
 other $10,000 to complete the job-if no help
 is forthcoming from the Government which
 would like to do research on Namu.
 But a part of the some $30,000 the brothers
 have already spent Is safe.  Lloyds of London
 has agreed to Insure a substantial part of the
 whale's purchase price.
 _ Will Ted Griffin let $20,000 swim away if he
 comes up against a stone wall?
 Never, says brother Jim.  He says Ted has
 promised: "I'm going to get that whale to
 Seattle.  I don't know how, but I'm going to
 get it there."

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ALEC G. OLSON
 Or MINNESOTA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, July 15, 1965
 Mr.        OLSON'                                           of  Minnesota.  Mr.
 Speaker, a fine musical organization
 from my district, the St. John's Univer-
 sity Men's Chorus of Collegeville, Minn.,
 has just completed its third successful
 European tour.  I have just received
 word that the chorus won first place in
 folk singing competition at the Llangol-
 len International Eisteddfod in Llangol-
 len Wales.  In addition, it finished third
 in overall competition and was praised
 for a-"finely united performance" by Dr.
 Herbert Howells, head of the board of
 judges.  The St. John's Chorus is di-
 rected, by Mr. Gerhard Track who di-
 rected the famed Vienna Choirboys for 5
 years before joining the St. John's Music
 Department.
 I ask that a portion of a news story
 from the St. Paul, Minn., Dispatch, July
 7, be appended to my remarks:
 LLANGOLLEN, WALES.-The St. John's Uni-
 versity Men's Chorus from Minnesota won
 the first prize today in one of the major com-
 petitions at the Llangollen International
 Eisteddfod, a group singing competition,
 They took the first prize and an Interna-
 tional trophy in the contest for folk-song
 parties.  There were 24 choirs in the compe-
 tition,, representing  14 different countries.
 The St. John's team was awarded 180 marks.
 The St. John's choir from Collegeville had
 been on a European tour and Llangollen was
 Its last place of call.
 In giving the adjudication,  Dr.  Solon
 Michaeides of Greece said: "The St. John's
 music was beautifully graded with rhythmi-
 cal feeling.  The blending was                                                    excellent
 throughout.
 "It is a choir with very large vocal re-
 sources.  In their second song a tenor solo
 was very expressive and well supported by the
 rest of the choir. They built up a climax in
 a wonderful way.  They were alw  p,, ex-
 cellent without losing their tone color.  The
 choir is a virile ensemble,"
 SPEECH
 OF
 HON. RAY J. MADDEN
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, July 14, 1965
 Mr. MADDEN. Mr. Speaker, the fol-
 lowing editorial by Robert R. Brunn
 recollects some interesting but forgotten
 events in the life of the great states-
 man, Adlai E. Stevenson.
 ADLAI  E.  STEVENSON:  ADROIT  WARRIOR  FOR
 PEACE
 (By Robert R. Brunn)
 WASHINGTON.-Adlai E. Stevenson, who
 passed on in London Wednesday, was an
 extraordinarily deft and adroit representa-
 tive of the United States on the global stage
 at the United Nations.
 Free of the anguish of two grueling presi-
 dential campaigns in 1952 and again in 1956,
 Mr. Stevenson settled down to a spirited
 defense of U.S. foreign policy and action.
 No American  politician in this, century
 was ever to shape a phrase with more telling
 intellectual effect.  But in facing Dwight
 D. Eisenhower in two campaigns, he knew
 deep inside that it probably was a losing
 battle.
 Under President Kennedy he took up the
 struggle for peace with gusto--and an ele-
 gant phrase.  He spoke out for international
 justice  and for  wisdom in  handling  the
 global Communist threat.
 At the time of his passing Wednesday in
 London, he had been talking with British
 officials about southeast Asia and had seen
 Foreign  Secretary  Michael  Stewart  that
 morning.
 Looking back on his two campaigns Mr.
 Stevenson once said this:
 "There is evidence that those campaigns
 were worthwhile; that they saw a quicken-
 ing, an awakening, of political purpose in the
 minds of many thinking Americans:  that
 they aroused a new or broader sense of per-
 sonal responsibility in political affairs, a large
 respect for the political process, a sense of
 ideals attainable through political activity.
 "I like to think they reduced the snobbery
 about politics; that there is more realization
 that free society demands the wisest kind of
 political  leadership;  that  without politics
 there can be no democratic freedom, not
 even the freedom to be 'above politics.'
 "And I have never felt any sense of defeat
 for the ideas of talking sense, of tackling the
 hard issues, of telling the truth, in a political
 campaign.
 "It is extremely important that those who
 have taken part in this invigoration of the
 political process take up again now the
 cudgels they wielded so gloriously before."
 President Johnson was visibly moved by
 the news of Mr. Stevenson's passing as he
 went through the motions of shaking hands
 with members of a Japanese trade mission
 who were his guests.
 Senator GEORGE D. AIKEN, Republican, of
 Vermont, said Mr. Stevenson "did his work
 conscientiously and he did it  well."   He
 added it was unfortunate that "now, perhaps
 when he is needed more than ever, he has
 been called away."
 In campaigning in the 1960 campaign, Mr.
 Stevenson indicated his future role in the
