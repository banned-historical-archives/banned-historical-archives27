 "Dr. Zhivago"   Soviets Seek To Bar Films
 in India
 Press Comment, 17 April
 1967, carried an item from the 5 April
 New Delhi PATRIOT, somewhat misleading-
 ly headlined:   "No 'Advice' by the Soviet
 Union on 'Dr. Zhivago."'  The story re-
 lates that the Indian Minister for Infor-
 mation had stated in Parliament that the
 Soviet Embassy had "given no advice" to
 the Indian government on the exhibition
 of the film "Dr. Zhivago," but "had
 drawn Gas the Minister put it  'our atten-
 tion to the fact that the exhibition of
 the film would be embarrassing to the
 Soviet Union."'  After due consideration,
 the Indian government had decided "to
 pass the picture with such cuts as
 were considered necessary, keeping in
 view the susceptibilities of a friendly
 country."  In the case of another movie,
 "From Russia with Love," the title was
 changed to "From 007 with Love," and
 all references to the USSR were deleted;
 the Soviet Embassy had represented to
 the Indian government that the film
 "did not project the real character of
 the Soviet people."
 It seems likely that similar pro-
 tests will be made by Soviet diplomats
 when "Dr. Zhivago" comes to other
 countries; in many cases, where there is
 no parliament, the public may have
 difficulty learning that censorship has
 been sought.  Where possible, we should
 try to publicize Soviet efforts to limit
 distribution of such films.   Their efforts
 can be compared with Nazi efforts to dis-
 courage the showing of "All Quiet on the
 Western Front"; the story of Pasternak's
 later years and the Soviet prohibition
 of his acceptance of a Nobel Prize can
 be recalled; and the sensitivity of the
 Soviets on "Zhivago" can be tied in with
 their 50th Anniversary celebrations:
 evidently this is one major reason for
 Soviet displeasure at the circulation of
 this film.   Where some friction takes
 place and the film is cut, protests can

 Whatever its conclusions, the
 matter needs to be put into perspec-
 tive.             The Americans' bombing policy
 is based on two apparently contrary,
 yet complementary, principles.   In
 certain special zones or in areas
 where full-scale operations are being
 waged against the enemy the bombing is
 devastating and relentless.   But in
 areas which contain civilians, the
 most elaborate ground rules are in
 force to try to stop them being hurt.
 In such areas, the approval of the
 local province chief is required be-
 fore any air strike can be made.   This
 frequently results in delays which
 allow the enemy to escape.   British
 television viewers who are conditioned
 to regard the air war in Vietnam as
 an unrelieved exercise in American
 brutality could profitably observe
 this curious partnership between
 American pilots and Vietnamese
 officials.
 In the actual conduct of the air
 strikes, the target is pin-pointed in
 advance by forward air controllers,
 who reconnoitre the area for hours in
 slow-flying aircraft, often at great
 personal risk.  A common technique
 is to drop smoke flares on the precise
 Vietcong stronghold.  If there is a
 possibility of hitting civilians the
 whole thing is usually called off.
 In the Delta area certain sections of
 the waterways have been pronounced
 "friendly areas".   Even if the Viet-
 cong sneak in and fire a few volleys
 the river patrol boats must not fire
 back, for fear of hitting the "friend-
 ly civilians."  The B-52 bombers,
 which are used only in full-scale open
 fighting, are electronically controll-
 ed and have a remarkable degree of
 bomb-aiming accuracy.   It is claimed
 that in all their operations they
 have killed only one civilian.   The
 picture is reasonably clear.   Perhaps
 never before has a belligerent wield-
 ed such a preponderance of power with
 so much restraint.

 "REVISION-ism" New Edition Planned
 for Great Soviet
 Encyclopedia
 The Central Committee
 of the CPSU has just ordered a complete-
 ly revised edition of THE GREAT SOVIET
 ENCYCLOPEDIA, which one Western journal
 has sarcastically called "the reposi-
 tory of ultimate truth" - as far as
 Soviet citizens are concerned.   In
 recent years the present (1957) edition
 has been overtaken by such events as
 the fall of Khrushchev, and the break with
 Mao Tse-tung, both of which persons
 are described most favorably; also by
 the rise of Brezhnev, only named in a
 supplement,     and of Kosygin, who is
 given nodding recognition as a "notable
 statesman and minister of consumer
 goods."  The 1957 edition dismisses
 Charles de Gaulle as "a monarchist and
 clerical "who   openly calls for the
 establishment of a Fascist dictator-
 ship and for starting war against the
 Soviet Union and other socialist
 countries".  As the new edition is not
 scheduled to appear until 1974, there
 will undoubtedly be many revisions of
 draft articles meanwhile.  (If one can
 judge by the Soviet history of the past
 twenty years, Brezhnev may by that
 time become an unperson again, or at
 best receive minimal mention as a
 "former high Party official".)
 (Question - with tongue in cheek:
 Why don't the Communist produce major
 reference works as loose-leaf books?)

 Above all, the Delta  illus-

 not necessarily the inefficacy --
 of the Americans' bombing policy,
 which is again under severe criti-
 cisn. because of the bloody episode
 at the village of Lang Vei, where
 about 100 villagers were accidentally
 killed by American jets.   There are
 many features about this affair
 which are odd, to say the least.
 One possibility -- though it is no
 more than that -- is that the Ameri-
 cans really meant to bomb a village
 on, the Ho Chi Minh trail inside
 Laos,, the border of which runs very
 close to Lang Vei,   For the moment,
 American officials merely talk in
 general terms about navigational
 error; and a board of inquiry has
 been set up.

 SITUATION:  A meeting took place in Moscow on 16 February 1966 to
 discuss a book, 1941, 22 June by Dr. A.M. Nekrich.  The discussion,
 sponsored by the Institute for Marxism-Leninism and participated in by
 130 military and civilian historians, focused on Stalin. and Stalinism,
 and at times went well beyond the scope of the book; reports of this
 meeting have leaked out to the Free World in recent months.  With the
 exception of one apologist who was hooted from the scene, those speaking
 up expressed views strongly condemning not only Stalin's prewar and
 wartime leadership but also the very system of Stalinism; these views
 were vigorously supported by the audience.   In a brief debating match,
 one historian carried his point that Stalin was a criminal.  Some of the
 speakers indicted Stalin's collaborators and could well have been think-
 ing about some of the contemporary leaders of the USSR.
 The discussion also touched on a wide range of other smoldering
 issues.   For example, several complained about the suppression of his-
 torical data in the USSR and the consequent need of Soviet historians
 to refer to foreign sources when dealing with Stalin's era.   The murders
 of military leaders in the purges of the 1930's were poignantly drama-
 tized by the historian Yakir, the son of one of Stalin's victims.   The
 bitter experiences in the Kolyma forced labor camp, in the gold fields
 of the far northeastern region of the USSR, were recalled and     a
 former inmate used these as his credentials to speak.
 Stalin's foreign policies also came
 in
 for
 criticism. Historians
 asserted that Stalin facilitated the rise
 of
 the
 Fascists by weakening
 the Social Democrats.   Stalin was scored
 for
 his
 share in depriving the
 Poles of their freedom and for betraying
 the
 Spanish Republic and the
 Communists of all countries.
 All of the speakers but one praised the book as good, timely, honest,
 and useful.   To the surprise of some, Nekrich's book was approved by
 the Historical Section of the Great Fatherland War of the Institute of
 Marxism-Leninism.   However, the Committee on Publication Matters dis-
 approved of the book.   (Somehow, 11,000 copies of the book have been
 printed and distributed, but further distribution has been halted.)

 The lone apologist for Stalin, Professor G.A. Deborin,  tried to
 suggest that a critic was echoing the line of "the enemy camp" and said:
 "'It is necessary to determine, Comrade Snegov, to which camp you belongl"
 Snegov replied that he was from Kolyma camp, one of Stalin's slave labor
 camps. When Deborin said all this would have to be checked, the whole
 audience became indignant, and he was not permitted to speak further.

 case study in the Soviet distortion of history.   Copies are avail-

 Despite Stalin's unpopularity with historians, the regime has
 pushed a limited rehabilitation of his memory over the last year.  This
 may be in part a reaction to the 16 February 1966 meeting; although in
 mid-March 1966 a collective let-,er protested a rumored impending rehabil-
 itation, Moscow City party leader N.G. Yegory-chev on 30 March 1966
 denounced the "recent fashion of seeking out elements of Stalinism as a
 scarecrow to frighten the public, especially the intelligentsia."  The
 rehabilitation seems to be supported most heavily by     military lead-
 ers   whose articles, speeches, and memoirs (especially at the last
 anniversary of the October Revolution and at the various battle anni-
 versaries) have assigned Stalin once more a leading role as a military
 leader; the military appear to have resented Khrushchev's denigration of
 Stalin and exaggeration of his own accomplishments.   The whole issue of
 Stalinism is of course an especially sen.si~..ive subject this year,, during
 the! 50th anniversary celebrations.   it should. be remembered that, despite
 Khrushchev's speeches in party gatherings and various publications by
 liberal writers and poets, there never has been a full, open, public
 discussion on Stalinism within the USSR.  The regime has always, even
 under Khrushchev, handled the subject of Stalin's policies with some
 restraint -- a wise decision from the regime's standpoint, since Stalinism
 cannot be completely repudiated without repudiating also the regime,
 shaped in its essential features by Stalin,
 Comments on the basic material are in order.   ,:'here seems to be no
 reasonable doubt about the authenticity of the report.   Also, it has
 been accepted and spread by several publications, some of which can
 hardly be suspected of U.S. influence.   The record of the meeting repro-
 duced in POSSEV (from which the attached material is translated), was
 also described in LA SINISTRA, a. journal published in Rome (some of the
 staff members are Trotskyites) and by LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR in Paris.
 DER SPIEGEL, the West German TIME, has published long excerpts in its
 20 March 1967 issue.   In addition, Moscow correspondent Henry Shapiro
 referred to the meeting in his dispatch on the anniversary of Stalin's
 death in March 1967.

 SITUATION:  The Chinese boycotted the "splittist" Afro-Asian Writers
 Conference, held in Beirua 25-30 March,as they did the AAPSO meeting in

 25X1C10b
 was in effect split last year into Soviet- and Chicom-oriented groups,
 each holding meetings through the summer and fall.  An "emergency meeting"
 of writers in support of Vietnam, held in Peking in June-July 1966, resolv-
 ed to hold the Third Afro-Asian Writers Conference in Peking in 1967 but
 mentioned no date; in turn, a Soviet-sponsored meeting in Baku in September
 selected Beirut as the site for the AAWB conference in early 1967.   (See
 A Soviet-sponsored "extra-
 ordinary meeting" in Cairo in June had decided to move AAWB headquarters 25X1 C 1 Ob
 "teeoraril It from Colombo to Cairo.
 Before the Beirut Conference, Peking announced that preparatory work
 for the third writers conference "is being satisfactorily carried out";
 after the Conference Peking claimed that firm support has been pledged
 in statements issued by writers unions and "nationalist parties" in
 many Asian and African countries.  The 21 March statement further declar-
 ed that the Afro-Asian writers movement,  "after kicking out the Soviet
 revisionists who sneaked into the ranks of the Afro-Asian people," will
 develop with greater vigor and vitality.
 Peking: Cairo-based AAWB Led by  Alien, Imperialist-Connected Forces
 Peking assailed the Beirut meeting with the same sort of abuse it showered
 on the Soviet=-controlled AAPSO meeting in Nicosia.   It added to all the
 well-known charges relating to Soviet control ("engineered by the Soviet
 revisionist leading clique") that the AAWB meeting was "in the pay of the
 United Nations" -- apparently because of the Cairo-based AAWB's endeavors
 to obtain financial support from UNESCO--and questioned whether the Soviets
 are indeed an-Afro-Asian nation.  Peking also continues to publicize state-
 ments by various Asian and African "organizations" and individuals favor-
 ing Peking as the site of AAPSO and AAWB conferences.   The intemperate
 Chinese behavior contrasted at the Conference with a paucity of direct
 attacks on them (even these were rather restrained) and the diplomatic
 gimmickry of electing a Chinese representative to the executive committee
 in absentia.
 The Chinese insist that the legitimate AAWB headquarters
 is still in Colombo and that it has its executive secretariat in  Peking.
 Chinese Tactics.   Repeating a pattern established at Nicosia, the
 Chinese sent no official delegation, but Chinese representatives camouflaged

 as journalists were present; and the local NCNA office distributed handbills
 (in Arabic, English and French) -- according to a Soviet version, in 7 lan-
 guages -- alleging that the Conference was unlawful.   TASS commented that
 the Chinese tactics observe the following rule:   "Do not attend forums at
 which it is quite obvious that the Chinese representatives will constitute
 an insignificant minority; declare these conferences and meetings 'unlaw-
 ful'... and seek to obstruct any movement aimed at rallying the progressive
 forces in Asia and Africa."
 The Writer's Role:  Anti-II,erialist Activist.   Although seventy
 .countries" were expected to attend the meeting, about fifty were re-
 presented.   Speakers stressed the role of the writer in the national
 liberation movements and in the fight against imperialism.   S. Azinov, the
 head of the Soviet delegation, maintained that Soviet literature makes a
 contribution to better mutual understanding of the Afro-Asian peoples.   He
 made proposals concerning the publication, of an AAWB magazine, exchange of
 information on the publication of books, and assistance for writers "who
 live in difficult-conditions."  He claimed that book;, by writers of some
 40 Afro-Asian countries have been printed in the Soviet Union in 54
 languages in over 100 million copies since the Tashkent Afro-Asian Writers
 Conference in 1958.  A declaration stated that the AAWBB will. make Afro-
 Asian literature a vanguard of the champions of independence, national
 sovereignty, and happiness of the peoples; and. that imperialism. attacks
 the culture and literature of the Afro-Asian peoples and spends tremendous
 sums of monty to bribe the Afro-Asian intelligentsia.   The Soviets hailed
 Yevtushenko's presence at the Conference as.a great success.  The Chinese
 singled him out for special attacks:  The "beatnik poet" showed his  devotion
 to the "late chieftain of U.S. imperialism, President Kennedy" by laying a
 wreath at his tomb and he was generally characterized either as the tool
 or the exponent of Soviet revisionism,  (NCNA: "Yevtushenko presented him-
 self in the ugliest possible light....; he suffered from a hangover" the  latter apparently a true charge according to other reports.)
 Committees drafted documents to sum up the results of "this represen-
 tative forum of progressive writers"  (TASS).  The Beirut press, in partic-
 ular, treated the conference as a political one rather than as a meeting
 of representative Afro-Asian writers.
 Resolutions:   Vietnam Most Important Issue.    The  conference concluded
 by unanimously passing resolutions on Vietnam, imperialism and Israel.   The
 resolution on Vietnam denounced the "aggressive war of the U.S. against
 Vietnam" and the "barbarous air raids," and expressed solidarity with the
 "heroic" people of Vietnam and full support for the four points advanced by
 the DRV and the five points of the NFLSV.
 Another resolution condemned British, Portuguese, French and American
 imperialism ("the most, insidious and cruel form. of imperialism" [TASS])
 in Africa and Asia.   The resolution concerning Israel refers  -CO  it as a

 base for imperialism and neo-colonialism ("imperialism's obedient instru-
 ment for aggression against the Arab states") and calls on the progressive
 writers to resist the "big cultural plot concocted by the Zionist movement."
 Following the Nicosia example, a special resolution conveyed greetings
 to the Soviet peoples on the occasion of the "golden anniversary of their
 great revolution"; it noted the international significance of the October
 Revolution, its influence on the revolutionary and liberation movements
 and the social progress of the peoples; and it pointed to the Revolution's
 role in "opening up new horizons for the intellectual progress of mankind,
 which had been blocked for the peoples by the monopoly of imperialist
 culture".

 executive committee was increased to twenty-seven members (including the
 CPR),*  with Africa as a whole having 15 and Black Africa 11 members.     Ten

 Said ad-Dim (UAR) deputy secretary general.  No decision was made regard-
 ing the next Conference to be held in three years;   India's offer to hold
 it in New Delhi was considered.
 Reports that several participants (Syria, Senegal, Angola and Pales-
 tine) had threatened to walk out were officially denied by the Secretariat.
 The Senegalese delegation did, however, protest that the conference should
 not be solely Arab-Asian.   The conference ended a day early to enable the

 1118 EUR,FE.    REACTION TO CONTINUING COLLECTIONS IN EAST
 25X1 C 10b        EUROPE OF "AID" FOR VIETNAM
 SITUATION: On 13 March,a "Week of Solidarity With the Struggle of
 the Vietnamese People" and "collections for the Vietnam aid fund" were
 launphed,as Moscow's "Radio  Peace and Progress" told its Asian audiences
 on that day.   "The Soviet people will take an active part in this," the
 radio asserted, because"the cohesion of all the forces in support of
 heroic Vietnam is now very necessary."  Earlier in March Moscow radio
 had announced that the Soviet Red Cross Society was shipping more supplies
 to North Vietnam "purchased with money donated by various public organiza-
 tions and individuals."  This aid being sent to North Vietnam, the radio
 noted, includes foodstuffs, clothing, consumer goods, ambulances, medicines,
 and "many other" items.
 In an interview with the magazine SOVIET RUSSIA North Vietnamese
 Ambassador in Moscow Nguyen Tho Chan declared, according to the Soviet
 news agency TASS on 15 March, that "the support of the Soviet Union and
 other socialist countries adds to the combat potential of all the Viet-
 namese people."  On the same day Moscow radio quoted a statement in RED
 STAR that "at the request of the permanent mission of the NFLSV, the
 Soviet Red Cross is effecting the transportation of aid being sent to
 Vietnam by public organizations of foreign countries,"
 What has this meant to the "man in the street" in the USSR and,
 more to the point, in the East European countries?  Workers, already
 suffering from low wages and scarce consumer goods, have been forced to
 contribute sorely needed money from their pay envelopes.   Inadequate
 medical facilities in East Europe, further strained by a large-scale flu
 epidemic this winter, have had to be utilized for blood collections and
 have been shortchanged on their requests for medical supplies and equip-
 ment diverted to Vietnam.   Overcrowded training and educational installa-
 tions have been forced to take in thousands of Vietnamese poorly equipped
 by their own background to take advantage of the schooling in East
 Europe.
 Evidence of reaction in the Satellite countries is included in the
 attached unclassified paper.   Hinted at in this paper, but purposely not
 spelled out in detail, is what this Moscow-directed campaign means else-
 where:    despite propaganda, East Europeans send aid grudgingly,

 Approved For Release 200    21-07 -C-RDP78-03061 A000400060005-8
 an attitude which has implications for. quantity and quality of the aid.
 Furthermore, the Chicoms (at least according to the Soviets--
 and the accusation sounds plausible) stop a good percentage of it from
 reaching the Vietnamese.   It is doubtful that material or financial
 contributions collected in Eastern Europe are fully passed on to V:Letnam
 in the form of supplies; to the various regimes, the collections are
 mainly a way of mobilizing opinion against "imperialism", rather than
 aiding Hanoi.  All this should serve as a good lesson for the countries
 of the Third World who might be considering the acceptance of aid from
 Communist countries in the future.  Meanwhile, third world nationals
 studying in Communist countries are being squeezed out of their small
 allowances to make "donations" to the aid collections, and while the
 Communists softpedal the subject of their own people becoming "volun-
 teers" to fight at the side of the North Vietnamese they hint at the
 possibility of this being a good idea for the "oppressed people of
 Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

 SITUATION:   (UNCLASSIFIED)  In July, 1961., the Government of South
 Vietnam formally asked the Free World for material and technical assis-
 tance to help her fight the non-military sector of the Vietnam war.
 Within two years more than 30 countries in the Free World had come to
 the aid of this small Asian nation with over $50,000,000 in economic,
 technical, medical and social assistance.  As far as it has gone this
 Free World assistance has been heartening.   Equipment and personnel have
 poured into South Vietnam from Africa, Latin America, Europe, and the
 Near and Far East -- Iranian petroleum and Argentinian wheat have been
 unloaded in the Saigon estuary alongside a 3,000-ton hospital ship sup-
 plied by West Germany   At Tan Son Hut, pharmaceuticals airlifted from

 THE INDIAN ELECTIONS:  The Demand
 for a Chan e
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   The dust is still settling after India's fourth general
 elections, 15-21 February 1967, when some 175 million voters administered
 a stunning rebuff to the Indian National Congress (Congress Party).
 Congress maintains its rule at the national level, but only by an unex-
 pectedly slim margin.
 In the first nationwide elections since the death of Prime Minister
 Jawaharla7,y Nehru in May 1964, the Congress Party, which he organized and
 led, was stripped of the commanding parliamentary majority it had enjoyed
 since India achieved independence in 1947.   It suffered substantial
 reverses on both the national and state levels, reflecting the recent
 growth of popular dissatisfaction with twenty years of unbroken Congress
 rule.
 Over half of the Indian electorate of 247 million (75% of whom are
 illiterate, mostly rural and poor) in the world's largest parliamentary
 democracy apparently went to the polls and voted their frustration over
 drought, food shortages, soaring prices, low wages, serious unemployment,
 unfulfilled expectations...
 No clear right or left trend in Indian politics emerged during the
 elections; no concerted policy mandate is implicit in the results.   They
 are viewed more as a strong protest against the seeming inability of the
 (Congress Party) government to solve India's many crucial problems
 rather than as a vote for any particular alternative or ideology   The
 elections highlighted the most serious weakness of the Indian political
 system -- the lack of a strong nationwide opposition party which can serve
 25X1 C10b          as a viable alternative to Congress                                          25X1 C10b
 Perhaps the most definite pattern emerging from the elections is
 what appears to be the wholesale repudiation of established or ingrown
 political leadership -- primarily of the Congress, but also of opposition
 parties -- by an electorate which had had enough of party panjandrums who
 put political and personal interests above the national welfare,   (About
 one third of the 52 central government and state ministers lost their

 seats, many of them prominent party stalwarts.)
 Eight national and eleven regional. parties competed for the 521
 seats in the Lok Sabha ( the lower house of parliament;` enlarged from
 the 494 seats contested in the 1962 elections), and the 3,563 seats in
 the Legislative Assemblies of 16 states and 8 territories.
 Results of Lok Sabha Elections
 Returns for the Lok Sabha gives Congress control. of only 280 seats,
 or about 55 percent of the members, as compared to over 70 percent in the
 previous three elections.  The Congress popular vote slid from about 45
 percent in the last elections to about 39 percent this year.
 Opposition parties with left, right and. communal. biases all gained at
 the expense of Congress, although no single party has enough support to
 act officially, or in fact, as a national dppositior...* The opposition,
 although numerically strengthened, is still splintered and divided along
 ideological lines.  The major right-wing opposition parties - the con-
 servative free-enterprise Swatantra winning, 44 seats. and the Hindu
 nationalist Jan Sangh winning 35 - made the biggest gains, but each has
 less than ten percent of the Lok Sabha seats, and sc. far each shows little
 willingness to cooperate at the national level.
 The two rival Communist Parties, the pro-Moscow CPI/R and the pro-
 Peking CPI/L (See BPG #183, item #981, 3:L January 19?66:  "Effects of
 Sino-Soviet Rivalry on Communist Parties of' India"), improved somewhat
 on their previous limited representation, but fell behind the right-
 wing forces, with 24 seats for the CPI/R and 19 for the CPI/L.   (Leaders
 of the two parties have stated they will nct cooperate with each other
 in parliamentary matters: in fact, the CPI/L seems more interested in
 ruining the CPI7R than in opposing the Congress platform; each faction
 accuses the other of causing the failure of "democratic forces" by
 dividing the votes of the opposition,  Soviet comment on the elections
 reveals concern over the strengthening of the righting parties, alleged-
 ly 'backed by Indian and foreign capital, and presses its line calling
 for unity of leftist and "democratic" forces in the face of strong re-
 actionary and imperialist pressures).
 The Samyukta Socialists (SSP), which developed. an unsavory reputation
 for violence, won 23 seats.   The moderate Praja Socialist Party (PSP) won
 only 13, a gain of one seat.   The Tamil-nationalist Dravida Munnetra
 Kazhagam (DMK) won 25 seats, all from Madras.  Other minor parties and
 independents won about 60.
 Results of State Elections

 the complexity of India - a facade which the state elections in particular

 dented if not shattered.
 In the 16 State elections, where the opposition parties tended to
 concentrate their resources and the electorate vote was highly subjective,
 Congress suffered humiliating setbacks,  It failed to win a majority in
 half the contests, and its majorities decreased in the rest.  Here again,
 losses were not primarily at the hands of any one party or political
 grouping.  In several states issues of a peculiarly "Indian" nature -
 having their roots in religion, language and community - served as ready
 magnets for those disaffected from Congress,    Rightists, nationalists,
 regionalists and leftists rode the anti-Congress bandwagon and benefited
 to varying degrees.
 In Madras, the DMK won a majority of seats in the assembly.   In
 Kerala, a CPI/L-led coalition practically wiped out the badly split
 Congress party.   In Orissa, a coalition of the Swatantra Party and the
 Jana Congress (dissident Congressmen) gained a majority.   The capital
 district of Delhi was carried by the Jan Sangh, although Prime Minister
 Indira Gandhi scored a personal victory in Uttar Pradesh which greatly
 strengthened her position within the Congress.
 In West Bengal, the Bangla Congress ( dissident Congressmen) joined
 an improbable alliance of 13 parties, ranging from Gandhians to pro-
 Chinese communists, unseated the hitherto entrenched Congress Party lead-
 ers, and formed a government headed by a dissident Congress leader but
 heavily dependent on the support of the far left, particularly the CPI/L,
 the largest party in the coalition.
 In Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Punjabi Suba, Congress won
 only a plurality, 'but hoped to attract enough independents to form
 governments.
 Aftermath of Elections
 Some Congress Party members in two State assemblies (Haryana and
 Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state) have changed sides since the
 elections, bringing down two Congress governments and leaving the party
 with legislative majorities in only seven of the 17 States, in mid-April.
 (Rajasthan, where anti-Congress demonstrations occurred, was placed under
 Presidential rule on 13 March).   The loss of Uttar Pradesh, once the major
 stronghold of Congress political power, was a jolting setback for the party.
 Non-Congress governments now control not only the two southernmost states
 but also those spanning the entire width of northern India and including
 some of the most heavily populated and productive areas of the nation.
 The future stability of at least three more Congress state governments
 could be threatened by factionalism and personality clashes.
 Several of the non-Congress state governments are -inherently unstable.
 Only the communist-dominated regime in Kerala, the regionalist government

 in Madras, and the conservative Swatantra-led coalition in Orissa have
 fair prospects of some continuity.
 For the first time, the government in New Delhi must deal with a
 group of state governments controlled by opposition parties (some of them
 violently anti-Congress), with widely differing programs, attitudes, and
 sources of support, and for the most part, very little experience in
 governing.
 Mrs. Gandhi, again a compromise choice of Congress leaders, begins her
 second tour as Prime Minister, with Morarji Desai, her only rival for party
 leadership, as deputy.  Her new =_9-member cabinet contains a number of new
 and pragmatic younger men, although the major portfolios of home, defense,
 external affairs and planning remain in the old hands.
 Congress leaders have now been thrown off balance by a sudden agreement
 among the seven,najor opposition parties on candidates for the Presidency

 symbolic but the loss of the two positions would be another serious blow
 to Congress prestige and could threaten the stability of the central govern-
 ment.
 (See unclassified attachments for more details of election statistics,
 descriptions of opposition parties and leaders, etc.)
 The period of adjustment in the critical area of state-central govern-
 ment relations is likely to be unstable, volatile and at times even violent.
 A great deal of skill, patience and understanding on all sides will be re-
 quired to achieve the political maturity which can create unity from diver-
 sity.                                                             25X1 C10b

 ample of modern democratic government at work to bring economic and social
 improvement to its people.   The upheavals, political and economic, in
 Indonesia and Ghana are good to cite as examples of the ruinous policies
 of communist leadership which subvert independent nations in order to
 accomplish a communist takeover of the government.  The united fronts and
 politically-expedient alliances in several of the Indian States should be
 commented upon in discussing communist machinations, of both left and
 right, during and after the elections including the position of the.
 Soviets and Chicoms.   (Additional details for commentary can be found in
 the unclassified attachments.)
 Sympathetic duscussion of the economic and social problems facing
 India should be firmly underscored with a call upon Congress and opposition
 leadership to end internal party bickering and divisive maneuvering.   The
 opposition should be reminded, whenever appropriate, of the responsibilities
 that go with its newly acquired power: in the past the programs of the
 opposition parties were basically negative and anti-Congress.  All media
 should exert every effort to convince the opposition parties of the mutual
 necessity for sound cooperation among themselves and between them and
 Congress; that the opposition must outgrow their "opposition mindedness"
 and use their positions to contribute to constructive solutions rather than
 to agitate and destroy.
 The democratic processes which are employed to bring about social and
 political changes, such as those that resulted from the Indian elections,
 can and should be contrasted with the "cultural revolution" in Communist
 China--the unbridled violence  th e  Red Guards exerted when they
 arbitrarily took power in their own hands, and the ensuing economic, social
 and administrative damage wreaked upon Communist China.

 War Historians Condemn Stalin
 16 February 1966 Meeting of the Historical Section of the
 Great Fatherland War/VOV/ of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism (IML)
 Under the Central Committee of the CPSU
 From Moscow we receive the following record of the discussion on the
 book by A.M. Nekrich on the historical analysis of the German-Soviet war.
 The material is particularly interesting in connection with the social
 struggle against the attempts for re-Stalinization which cropped up at the
 23rd Congress of the CPSU and which has been continuing up to now.
 Bulletin board notice:  Discussion of the book 1941, .22 June by
 A.M. Nekrich.   There were 130 persons present.   The Presidium:  Major
 General Ye. A. Boltin, V.S, Tel'pukhovskiy, Professor G.A. Deborin, and
 Doctor of the Institute of Sciences A.M. Nekrich.
 Deborin: "The VOV of the IML approves the book.   The opinion of the
 IML differs with the opinion of the Committee on Publication Matters,
 which disapproves of the book.   Of course, the conclusions are right
 but there are a number of contradictions.   The chief question is the
 reason for our misfortunes in the early period of the war (Deborin con-
 siders that Nekrich gives an erroneous setting in the chapter "Warnings
 Which Were Neglected".   It was not only Stalin who was to blame.
 Marshal Golikov misinformed him on much).   The 14 June 1941 statement
 by TASS was a diplomatic maneuver to check the German reaction.   In
 evaluating Stalin one must not bank on Khrushchev, who frequently is
 not objective (for example, maintianing that Stalin was afraid of war;
 it is more proper to say that Stalin relied too much on the agreement).
 "About the factual inaccuracies.   The 45's (Note: 45-millimeter guns)
 were useless against the German tanks and therefore the Government took
 them out of production (voices from the audience:   "That is not right!
 Taking them out of production was a crime!   We met the German tanks
 with our fists!  At the beginning of the war there wasn't any kind of
 anti-tank artillery!")  Furthermore, from the book by Nekrich it can be
 understood that Stalin, Voroshilov, Blyukher and others knew about the
 innocence of Tukhachevskiy, Yakir and others but nevertheless condemned
 them (voices in the room:   "Of course they knew!").   It is not to be

 doubted that Voroshilov and Budenn:Ly, who were present at the trial,
 possessed honor and conscience..." (Indignation is displayed all over
 the room.  Voices are heard:   "What kind of honor and conscience do they
 possess?  They are cowards and scum!").
 In the general hubbub Deborin leaves the tribune.
 Anfilov (General Staff): "The book is a good one.   First of all,
 about the honor of Voroshilov and Budenniy.   They don't have and never
 had it.  Much material, which is preserved in our archives, as yet, un-
 fortunately, is not subject to publication...   (Voices:   "There are
 enough secrets!   Say what there is!"),..,   compels a decidedly negative
 conclusion about their activity.   Here is a small episode.  In the middle
 of 1937, at a highly representative meeting, Stalin said:  'Well, we
 arrived with Comrade Voroshilov in Tsaritsyn in 1918 and within a week
 unmasked all the enemies of the people.'     He said this about many officers
 of the (former) SKVO [North Caucasian Military District] staff and front
 honestly serving the Soviet power (voices:   "Arid all of them were drowned
 in a barge without a court trial!").  And Stalin further said:  ' And here
 you can't even unmask your own neighbors.'
 "Voroshilov supported Stalin in every way; he called for informing
 against all of his comrades and fellow-workers.  My heart bleeds when I
 see him standing on the mausoleum during parades..
 "Now, about the beginning of the war.   If our forces had been brought
 to a state of military preparedness, which entirely depended on Stalin, we
 would not have suffered such a destructive blow in the early period of the
 war; and, in general, the war would not have been so prolonged, difficult
 and bloody.
 "Of course, it is necessary to take into account the degree of
 responsibility of our foremost military leaders.   In their speeches and.
 memoirs Gulikov and Kuznetsov [       ] appear as heros....   But are they
 indeed?  Gulikov gave Stalin a war communique which contained the whole
 'Barbarossa' Plan, but he wrote that this was a provocation calculated to
 make us clash with the Germans.  Kuznetsov writes that, after having
 received information from the Military-Naval Attache Vorontsov in Berlin
 on the date of the German attack, he immediately gave all of this informa-
 tion to Stalin.   But how did he present it?  You should, see his presentation!
 .It is written there that the information - 'is a provocation and was
 sent through intelligence channels.'   The Okrug military advisers turned
 to Stalin with the request to disarm and dismantle fortifications along
 the old border even though they knew very well. that there was a smell of
 powder...
 "All of this happened.   But nevertheless, Stalin was the key figure,
 He.cannot be whitewashed.   He was the chief perpetrator of this tragedy.
 Recently, I spoke with Marshal Zhukov.   He said that Golikov actually
 placed himself under the command of Stalin.   Be :reported nothing to

 the Nachshtab [Chief of Staff]  (Zhukov( or the Narkom [People's
 Commissar]  (Timoshenko).   They knew nothing about the date of the
 assult.   I didn't get a chance to speak with Timoshenko; he doesn't
 let a fellow in..."
 Zastavenko (IML) approves of the book:   "The people around Stalin
 did not help him to evaluate the situation.   On 5 June, Kalinin made a
 speech at the Military-Political Academy:   'The Germans are preparing
 to attack us, and we are expecting this.   The sooner the better.  We'll
 ring their necks...'   (Voices in the room:   "The old twaddler!") This
 was the evaluation of the Politburo.   It underestimated the strength of
 Germany.   Stalin is not alone to blame for what happened...   (There is
 a hubbub in the room),"
 Dashichev (General Staff):   "Every historian who has taken up the
 investigation of the war ought to study not only the end but also the
 beginning of the war.   This is the significance of the book by Nekrich.
 Deborin is wrong when he speaks about the 'forty-fives':  at the beginning
 of the war this gun pierced any German tank.   Then the production of
 the other guns (82 millimeters) was not as yet ironed out.   The army
 was left without antitank artillery and missiles.
 "The worst thing there is, is the absence of Soviet source references.
 For example, in order to write about the report on the Soviet attache
 (that the war would begin on 22 June), one has to refer to the book by
 the English historian Erickson.   When will all the sources be finally
 opened and accessible?  Berezhkov mentions the meeting of the German
 Ambassador Schulenburg with Dekonozov where Schulenburg gave the in-
 formation that Hitler would attack the Soviet Union on 22 June.   He
 cried and asked that the Armed Forces of the USSR be brought into a state
 of readiness - perhaps Hitler would become frightened.   But they didn't
 believe him...
 "About the goings-on hovering over our military leaders:  the forgery
 was prepared by the Gestapo, but the idea stemmed from Stalin.   He tossed
 it to the Fascist leaders through General Skovlin,   Our misfortune is
 that these documents also are not accessible.   Golikov committed a crime
 not only by composing information pleasing to Stalin.   He overloaded all
 of our best agent cadres abroad (A. shout:   "And Sorge also!") and was
 one of the initiators of the repression in relation to the intelligence
 cadres of the USSR.   There is no use referring to him?
 "Are the reasons of the tragedy of 22 June 1941 fully disclosed?
 Stalin bears the chief responsibility for it.   He established in the
 country a situation of terrorism...   The greatest crime of Stalin is
 the usurpation of power and the destruction of our best military and
 Party cadres.  All of our leaders, although they knew about the inter-
 national situation, did not have the courage to come forth with measures
 for the defense of the country.   Their frightful guilt lies before the
 Party and the people because they didn't come forth.   There are still

 people who even now say:   'Bad things must not be said about Stalin.'
 But you know that Stalin had the audacity to lead the country by himself".
 And his guilt is enormous.   This has to be discussed, so that such a
 thing does not happen again!
 "It is necessary to pinpoint more accurately the positions of
 Churchill, Schulenburg, Raeder and Halder (the last two expressed
 opposition to war with the USSR in Hitler's staff).   By no means were
 they guided by love for our country.  Hitler greatly influenced the
 decisions of the military.  During one of these meetings Hitler said:
 'The Red Army is leaderless.  Eighty percent of its commanding cadres
 has been destroyed.   It has been weakened as never before.   This is
 the basic factor of my decision.  We have to carry on war while the
 cadres have not been replenished.'
 "Every historian must have the courage to speak the truth."
 Roshchin (Institute of Marxism-Leninism):   ".,.Who is to blame?  This
 is the most real question.   The book is a good one.   There is the opinion:
 it is necessary to speak only about the victories and play down the defeats...
 Without saying anything about the injury to h:Ls'orical science, such an
 approach causes enormous harm to our Government.   It is necessary to inves-
 tigate and know the reasons for our defeats in order to avoi>[ errors in the
 future.   Stalin is the chief culprit for the defeats in 1941.   I do not
 agree with Deborin on the question about the reports of TASS,    This is not
 a diplomatic maneuver, but a crime.   It morally disarmed the people.   Stalin
 and the people around him did everything to tear down the preparation of
 the Soviet people for war.  When Kuznetsov informed Malenkov on carrying
 out some defensive naval measures -- and this happened on 17 June 19+.1 --
 Malenkov laughed at him and said:                               'You want to operate as though there
 will be war tomorrow.'  Zhdanov, who was present, reacted seriously, but
 the matter did not go any further.  Malenkov called off everything.
 "The blame can also not be taken, away from the military leaders.
 The military do not have the right to be surprised by the enemy."
 Mel'nikov ( Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences USSR):
 "...The book is a good one.   Several, words about Hess.   Deborin is
 guided by old information.   Now, this question has been set aside long
 ago.  According to Deborin's speech it can be understood that the book
 by Nekrich overestimates the sinister role of Stalin.   This is not true.
 It even underestimates.   Let us touch on a question which even up to
 now cannot be touched, that is, it has been labeled 'taboo' -- about the
 November discussions of Molotov and Hitler in Berlin.   Let us examine
 the situation.   The "Barbarossa' plan was being completed.  A redistri-
 bution of the German armies began on the Soviet-German frontier.
 Hitler's diplomats increased their activities in the Balkans and in
 Finland.   In order to hide these preparations from the Soviet Government,
 Hitler proposed a meeting at a higher level.  Moltov went to Berlin as
 the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars.   Hitler presented to

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060005-8
 him a plan for dividing the world, but only in general outlines.
 Molotov specifically demanded the Straits, Bulgaria, Rumania and
 Finland.   Hitler did not want to get involved in details since he
 was afraid that the information would leak through to the future allies.
 In reply to the demands of Molotov he proposed that the USSR sign a
 tri-partite pact.  Molotov left for Moscow on 25 December 1940.   Stalin
 agreed to an anti-Cominternist pact, but he didn't come to any agreement
 on the payment.   This shows his face and principles...."   (There is
 indignation in the room).   "We have no right to skirt the problem of
 Stalin."
 Vasilenko (IML):   He evaluates the book positively.   "The appre-
 hension of Deborin is that the excessive emphasis laid on Stalin in the
 book is illegal.   This stems from the essence of the book.  According
 to all objective information, we could have repulsed the Germans, but
 Stalin blocked everything.  Later, in order to justify his disgraceful
 failure, he promoted the theory of the better preparation of the aggressor
 for war.   This is not only a mendacious theory, but a dangerous one.  The
 aggressor, convinced of it [the theory], can mount an assault and plunge
 the world into a catastrophe.
 "On 5 May 1941, Stalin spoke at the Academy imeni Frunze and said
 that we were not prepared for war at the moment.   He dampened and dis-
 armed not only his own ardour, but also that of others and even of the
 army commanders."
 Kulish:   "...The discussion has gone far beyond the contents of the
 book and is not so much about it as about the problem of Stalin.  The
 appraisal of the book is a good one.  We were present at the birth of
 the new conception of the reasons for the defeats at the beginning of
 the war, states Deborin,  'not only and so much Stalin...'   This is a
 regurgitation of the personality cult.  Whether Stalin is guilty or not
 very guilty -- it is nevertheless a personality-cult raising of the
 question.  Again, he is alone!   The question has to be studied more
 deeply.   Why did the situation develop thus?  How did our Government,
 headed by Stalin manage the country?  How did it defend our people from
 danger?   Did it correspond with the existing situation?  No!   It didn't
 correspond!
 "It is necessary to investigate the reasons which established Stalin,
 a man who went beyond the bounds of his position, who was not restrained
 by the Party and the Government.
 There is still another irregularity:   in all of our literature the
 annexation of the Western Ukraine and Western Belorussia is evaluated as
 a factor for improving the defense of the country.   However, this is not
 so.  We know by force of obvious reasons that the buffer area worsened
 the defensive ability of the border.   Therefore in evaluating the annex-
 ation of the Western oblasts it is better to speak of the liberation and
 international role of the Red Army.

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060005-8
 Raskat (IML):   "...They say that Nekrich did not write about the
 development of industry ( he enumerates facts), of agriculture (enumer-
 ates), and the cultural revolution ( there is rumbling and exclamations
 in the room:   "Well, they're going to write a six-volume work and it will
 contain everything!   Speak about the main thing - who is guilty!?").   Of
 course, Stalin is guilty!   (There is laughter in the room).
 Gnedich:  "...The book is a good. one."  He didn't want to speak,
 but the discussion forced him to mount the tribune.   "For two years
 I submitted information to Stalin and Molotov?   It passed through my
 hands.  Golikov, of course, is the m.isinformer, but this isn't the
 matter.   The  'authentic' part of the information usually was thus or
 otherwise reflected in our press.   But Stalin usually paid attention
 to that which was stamped 'doubtful'.   He knew everything but. taking
 measures was his policy.   Golikov is responsible for the repression of
 the GRU cadres, but Golikov is not to blame for not taking defense
 measures.   It was asserted in our literature that Stalin became the
 head of our Government on 5 May 1941 in order to prepare the country for
 defense.   But we don't have any information to confirm this opinion.
 Stalin didn't even raise a finger in the matter of strengthening the
 defensive ability of the USSR.  We have grounds to assume that Stalin
 did not become the head of the government in order to prepare the country
 for defense, but in order to come to an agreement with Hitler."
 Slezkin:   "...The book is timely.   It is a good one.  A former front-
 line soldier, I categorically speak on the erroneous statement of Deborin
 on the )+5-millimeter guns. Stalin created deeds which can be called
 completely criminal.  A vicious circle created the situation of the
 personality cult, provocation and repression.   Everyone strove to please
 only his chief, submitting only that information which pleased the latter
 or which ran down information that was not pleasing.   They strove not to
 state their own thoughts.  All of this led to immeasurable misfortunes
 for the country.   Everyone is to blame, but the blame varies.   One man is
 to blame in that he did not decide to say what he thought; another in that
 he worked against his his own views.  The further and higher you go the
 greater is the responsibility,  And whatever the level the refusal of
 truth in the name of personal welfare is a crime, and the higher the level
 the greater the crime.
 "Stalin is the chief culprit.   The 1939 Pact, perhaps, was necessary,
 but relying on it was foolish.  But to discontinue the struggle with
 Fascism on the basis of it - and this was being done on the instructions
 of Stalin - was a, crime."
 Yakir (Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences USSR): "...The
 book is a very good one.   Some people have touched on the matter of
 Tukhachevskiy, Yakir and other comrades.   I consider the discussions on.
 Fascist provocations and on the "Red. paper-case"' with the documents pre-
 served in it to be unnecessary and even harmful.   They stray from the
 facts.   There was no "Red paper-case" in the case. It does not appear in

 the matters of this hasty trial.  All of the accused were acknowledged
 guilty on the basis of the oral statements of Stalin in the Military
 Council of 1-4+ June 1937 and on the direct statement of the [his] desire
 to rid himself of them.   Some of the earlier speakers, in mentioning
 Stalin, said  'Comrade Stalin.'   This is not right!   He is not a comrade to
 anyone, much less to us!   (Exclamations:   "Right!"   There is approval in
 the room.   The word "comrade" is left out in further speeches.)
 "Stalin delayed the development of our army and killed many prominent
 designers, including men in our jet propulsion engineering:   Tikhomirov,
 Langemak (the originator of the "katyusha"), Kurchevskiy, and Bakauri.
 It is necessary to investigate the question of prison camps.   To inves-
 tigate it from the economic point of view.   There was a war going on,
 but millions of healthy people who were former specialists in all fields
 of the economic and military life of the country were imprisoned in the
 camps.   Furthermore, considerable forces were needed to guard them.  All
 of this made a heavy load for the country."
 Telegin:   "...The book is a good one.   But the author is not critical
 of the foreign sources, particularly of the memoirs.   They contain little
 that is true...  (Exclamations:   "And what about our memoirs!")...   Yes,
 there are many lies in them (laughter in the room).   It must be remembered
 that in the memoirs there is a touch of Khrushchevism(there is a rumble
 in the room.    Exclamations:   "Of what?!"  The speaker under the continous
 rumbling in the entire room gives several examples and then leaves)."
 Tel'pukhovskiy: "...The events have to be illuminated objectively.
 Almost all of the Government statesmen didn't evaluate Hitler.   However,
 after the fall of France, all of the criteria were re-examined.   There
 were many of them to be re-examined.   Stalin calculated that if Hitler
 did not break his neck, then he would become tied up in the West.   When
 France fell, the Western statesmen carried out a re-evaluation,   Stalin
 didn't.
 "It seems that, when the war began, Stalin still made attempts to
 prevent the conflict.   Otherwise it is difficult to explain three different
 directives of the Chief Command of the RKKA [Workers' and Peasants' Red
 Army] on the first day of war.
 "Stalin is the chief culprit, but also all of the rest in their own

 Petrovskiy  (Historical Archives Institute):   "...It must be remember-
 ed that Fascism arose in Lenin's time.   There was the seizure of Italy by
 Mussolini, the "Kapp Putsch" and so forth.   Lenin indicated Fascism to be
 the chief enemy.   Stalin ignored the instructions of Lenin and stated that
 the chief enemy was the Social Democratic Party.    His theory was broadly
 disseminated and it divided the working class of the whole world.   This
 made it possible for the Fasicsts to come into power.   Stalin is a criminal..."

 Boltin:  "Comrade Petrovskiy!  In this room and on. that tribune
 it is necessary to choose expressions!  Are you a Communist?"
 Petrovskiy:  "Yes!"
 Boltin:  "I have not heard it said anywhere in the directives of
 the resolutions of our Party, which are obligatory for both of us, that
 Stalin is a criminal."
 Petrovskiy: "The 22nd Congress of the Party directed the removal of
 Stalin from the mausoleum for crimes before the Party.  It means that he
 is a criminal."
 "Stalin can not be whitewashed...   It means whitewashing any dictator
 of the type of Mao Tse-tung.   To say to them - 'act as you wish, you will
 nevertheless be justified...."'
 Snegov:   "...The book by Nekrich is honest and useful.  When on the
 eve of battle there is unpreparedness in the regiment, the locks lie
 separately from the rifles, the breeches separately from the guns and the
 intelligence officers and sentries are asleep; the regiment suffers a
 defeat. On the orders of the superior commander.) the commander of such a
 regiment is executed.  And there would be no one to object to this.   Stalin
 was in the position of such a commander, only the regiment was the whole
 country.   Stalin should have been shot, but instead an attempt is made to
 justify him.
 "Why is the book of Nekrich, in which Stalin is entangled, granted
 a quick discussion and even a condemnation but a book of the known
 falsifier of history I. Petrov, in which Stalin is credited with good
 deeds which he never did, has to wait to be discussed for so many
 years?
 "Why did Deborin make the attempt to whitewash Stalin?
 "When Hitler prepared to attack Poland, Stalin helped him. He executed
 all of the Polish Communists in the USSR and declared the Polish Communist
 Party outlawed.  Why do they call the fourth :partition of Poland the
 Liberation Campaign?  How can one be a Communist and speak softly of Stalin?
 About the Stalin who betrayed and sold out the Communists, who shot almost
 all of the delegates of the 17th Congress and almost all of the members of
 the Central Committee elected by that Congress, and who betrayed the
 Spanish Republic and the Communists of all countries!"
 Deborin (in conclusion):   "...I have not developed any new doctrine
 and I have not tried to defend or whitewash Stalin.   It is necessary to
 examine profoundly all aspects of the personality cult.   It is this that
 I wanted to say.   Perhaps I was not quite understood.

 "One of the speakers said that Golikov knew that erroneous stories
 were being told, and recently he himself openly acknowledged this.   He
 feared submitting other information.  This is even greater than the crime...
 "In regard to the speech of Snegov.  We have often heard what Snegov
 told us about Poland, and so forth.   Except that it came to us from a
 camp inimical to us.   This is the way, for example, Professor Yakobson
 from the FRG and other people similar to him spoke.
 "It is necessary to determine, Comrade Snegov, to which camp you
 belong!"
 Snegov:   "I am from the Kolyma camp!"
 Deborin:   "It is necessary to check all of this!"   (The room is roused
 with indignation.   There are exclamations:   "Again the old stuff!   Give
 him telephone numbers!"  Deborin is not given a chance to speak).
 Nekrich:   "...I thank you for your comments.   Deborin assuredly does
 not hold those viewpoints which are ascribed to him.     But in the dust of
 polemics what is there that doesn't happen!
 "The chief guilt for the difficult situation and for the whole tragedy
 of the first year falls totally on Stalin.   But, in general, information
 contrary to the truth must not be given to the chief.   Stalinism begins
 with us little people.   Stalin wanted to outfox Hitler, but he outfoxed
 himself.  And the thing ended in a catastrophe.   He knew better than any-
 one else about the killing of the command cadres of the army and the weak-
 ness of our Armed Forces (he quotes the speech of the Chief of the Main
 Political Administration of the Army, Yepishev, at the conference of
 historians in December 1962).   There are omissions in the book, and they
 will be corrected."
 Snegov:   "...I thought that I was participating in a scientific dis-
 cussion.   But Deborin, instead of producing scientific proof, gave argu-
 ments in the style of 1937.   But he will not frighten us!  We  won't let
 ourselves be frightened!   This is not the past, and the past will not
 return!" (Applause).
 Boltin (conclusion):  "...The meeting produced much new and interesting
 [information] on the problem as a whole.   The speeches given by Comrades
 Petrovskiy and Snegov were very emotional.   One can agree with much that
 has been said, but not with everything.

 Polish Government cannot be ascribed to our country.   This is the viewpoint
 of bourgeois historians and White emigrants.   It was primarily we who defend-

 East European ."Aid" to North Vietnam
 When grumbling about enforced collections of money, blood, and other
 items for North Vietnam is reported in the press of East Germany, the
 most servile of the Soviet Union's satellite states in East Europe,
 there can be no question but that people throughout East Europe are be-
 coming increasingly disillusioned with the policies of their Communist
 governments.
 An American newspaper correspondent, Fred Sparks, who recently
 visited the Soviet Union, has written that even in the USSR there is a
 growing split among the Kremlin leadership on the subject of aid to
 North Vietnam.  In an article published in the March 22, 1967, WASHINGTON
 DAILY NEWS Mr. Sparks noted that the Soviet government and party bosses,
 Kosygin and Brezhnev, are caught in the middle on this split and as a
 result are sending only a dribble of hardware to Hanoi while at the same
 time making thundering speeches critical of the United States.  He con-
 tinued:
 "These warlike proclamations, winked at in sophisticated Mos-
 cow, are primarily directed at the rest of the Communist world
 where Soviet prestige is low.  The East European press, for example,
 much freer than Moscow's, has slyly made it clear that the Russians
 are standing by, hands and tongues tied, while a small Communist
 country is getting pounded by an 'imperialist."'
 In an apparent effort to stir up flagging interest in the Soviet
 Union and in the East European satellite countries in the subject of aid
 for Vietnam, on March 13 Moscow announced that a "Week of Solidarity
 With the Struggle of the Vietnamese People" was being opened and that it
 would coincide with collections for the "Vietnam aid fund."  Moscow
 Radio declared the same day that "the Soviet people will take an active
 part in this" because "the cohesion of all the forces in support of
 heroic Vietnam is now very necessary."  During the same period, Moscow
 media reported that the Soviet Red Cross Society, which had also been
 charged with "effecting the transportation of aid being sent to Vietnam
 by public organizations of foreign countries," was shipping foodstuffs,
 clothing, consumer goods, ambulances, medicines, blood plasma, and "many
 other" items "purchased with money donated by various public organiza-
 tions and individuals."
 How the people of the Soviet Union were reacting to this latest
 drive was not reported in the controlled Communist press.  A few months
 ago, however, a European returning from Soviet Central Asia reported
 that he had attended meetings in Karaganda where workers had shouted at
 Communist Party speakers:  "Sit down and shut up!  You give your own
 earnings to Vietnam.  We Russians have no business there." This is only
 one instance of indications reaching the Free World that a growing
 number of working people in the Soviet Union are coming to realize that

 they are being forced to work extra hours and contribute money from
 their already small wages not for the betterment of their own homeland
 but in order to give "aid" to Communists abroad.
 While one can surmise from Soviet reports that individuals were not
 happy with the demands being placed on them for "donations" (no doubt
 many of the young "Pioneers who collect scrap iron and use money from it
 to send aid to Vietnam," as a Moscow broadcast in Serbo-Croatian reported
 on December 17, 1966, or of the "well-known writers, artists, and
 scientists who have been 'donating' their royalties to send various
 supplies needed by North Vietnam," as a Moscow broadcast to Africa reported
 on January 12, 1967, have their own ideas about how the money could be
 spent for better purposes closer to home -- or at; any rate, would prefer
 to make the decision themselves), there are'definite reports of discontent
 ih ,East European media.
 Fast Germ~
 For the past several months there have been a number of items in
 the East German press which reveal unprecedented criticism of the Com-
 munist regime for its policies in regard to Vietnam.   A good example
 appeared in an article in the November 17, 1966 issue of the Leipzig
 student publication UNIVERSITAETSZEITUNG, which reported on a meeting
 held by the university's Communist Party committee at which the regional
 party secretary was forced to admit:
 "The false view exists that material support of the, Vietnamese
 people's struggle for liberation wi.ll~simp1  prolong this conflict
 and this war.  But he who is really serious about preventing an
 expansion of this conflict, about destroying the concept of American
 imperialism, he must, from conviction and with his whole heart,
 give every support to the liberation struggle of the Vietnamese
 people.   Only in this way will an expansion of this conflict be
 prevented, and only in this way will we meet our international
 obligations."
 Similarly, in the January 1.967 issue of the East Berlin NATIONALE
 DEMOKRAT there was this reader's question:   "In what way does our soli-
 darity with the struggle of the Vietnamese people not mean prolonging the
 war in Vietnam?"  The answer was as unconvincing -?- and as indicative of
 a widespread popular doubt --? as the statement carried in the UNIVERSI-
 TAETSZEITUNG six weeks previously.  As January wore on, the West German
 INFORMATIONSBUERO WEST began noticing a number of protests against the
 North Vietnam "donation" drive.   On 24 January it reported:
 "Protests by the Soviet Zone population are becoming more
 vociferous against SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany)-orga-
 nized donation drives for North Vietnam.   Numerous citizens are
 refusing to make donations and purchase so-called solidarity stamps

 requested by the SED and other organizations, by saying that this
 will only prolong the war in Vietnam unnecessarily.
 "For instance, the SED paper LAUSITZER RUNDSCHAU reported
 arguments by employees of the Vetschau Power Plant concerning the
 purchase of solidarity stamps for 'Vietnam.  An article published by
 the organ of the SED Bezirk Dresden Administration, SAECHSISCHE
 ZEITUNG, indicates that arguments were also raised against the North
 Vietnam donation drive at the VEB (People-Owned) Fortschritt Enter-
 prise in Neustadt.   In a long article, the paper explained that
 passivity and indifference will not help end the war.  Only active
 help will strengthen North Vietnam's defensive power and will force
 the United States to respect the Geneva Agreement and thereby bring
 about a solution of the conflict.  Replying to a question by a
 farmer, the East Berlin paper BAUERN-ECHO emphatically defended the
 Vietnam donation drive and declared that the purpose of such dona-
 tions was to bring U.S. aggression there to a timely end.
 "Despite these requests, a number of citizens still reject the
 Vietnam donations.   This was also reported by Young Pioneers  who
 were sent to make house-to-house collections for North Vietnam.
 Students also refused to donate blood or money for Vietnam.  For
 instance, according to an article published in BZ AM ABEND (Berlin),
 two engineering students declared:   Not a penny for Vietnam; after
 all, we don't want to prolong the war!   The SED paper FREIE ERDE
 reports that actors at the Friedrich-Wolf Theater in Neustrelitz
 also rejected donations for North Vietnam."
 In objecting to actions prolonging the war, East German citizens are
 turning an old radical German protest against their regime.  When war-
 weary soldiers saw fresh troops marching to the front in 1918, they
 called them "kriegsverl,engerer" - "war prolongers".
 On 22 March the Vietnam Committee Attached to the Afro-Asian
 Solidarity Committee in East Germany announced, according to the East
 Berlin news agency ADN, that a balance sheet of the recent International
 Solidarity Week showed that "since the summer of 1965 the people of East
 Germany had donated a total of about 27.7 million marks for the support
 of the freedom struggle of the Vietnamese people."   (In the other East
 European countries overall figures on the amount of aid are for the most
 part lacking -- leading to the suspicion that they have been too small
 for the exact amount to be revealed.)
 One of the main complaints against the enforced drives to give
 aid to North Vietnam, judging by newspaper reports, concerns blood dona-
 tions.   The February 1967 issue of the military monthly ARMEE RUNDSCHAU
 reported on the progress of this drive as well as the campaign to encourage
 East German servicemen to contribute part of their pay, and noted in this
 regard that a 22-year-old private, Heinz Pufahl, had expressed a "general
 dislike for all types of collections" and many other soldiers had demand-
 ed to know "`what is actually being done with our donations?"

 In the past East Germany has been one of the principal suppliers of
 blood for North Vietnam.   The effectiveness of the Communist regime's
 enforced collection campaign can be judged, perhaps, by a report trans-
 mitted on January 12, 1967, by the East German news agency ADN:   "Some
 100,000 East German citizens donated blood for Vietnam last year, the
 Secretary of the Vietnam Committee told ADN today.  A total of 15,000
 blood plasma units were sent to Vietnam.   Further shipments will follow
 in 1967."  The previous month, however, the North Vietnamese Ambassador
 in East Berlin had declared that "over 50,000 people from all sections
 of the population of East Germany have given their blood to alleviate the
 sufferings of our wounded men, women, and children; during a Solidarity
 Week your Interflug airlines flew 10,000 units of dry blood plasma donated
 by East German citizens to Hanoi."  There is a, strange disparity in these
 statistics.  Adding to this the report in the January 1967 issue of
 Berlin's DEUTSCHE FINANZWIRTSCHAFT that "because of objective and sub-
 jective difficulties our blood donor institutions up to now have never
 fulfilled their performance plan in a single year"  and a number of
 references in the East German press to an epidemic of contagious
 hepatitis, one can easily see that the blood collection drive has had
 its problems.
 East Germany has, however, found one way to solve some of its domestic
 troubles in meeting Moscow-set quotas for aid for Vietnam.   On January 10,
 1967, ADN reported that the East German Customs Office had handed the
 Viet Cong representative in East Berlin a "solidarity gift of 100,000
 :marks."  During the Christmas gift mailing season East Germany had imposed
 stringent regulations on packages being sent from West Germans to their
 relatives in East Germany, warning that if these regulations were not met
 the gifts would be seized and the contents sent -to Vietnam.   The Customs
 Office had apparently used the West German packages to finance its
 "donation."
 Czechoslovakia
 The attitude of Czechoslovak youth toward the demands being placed on
 them to aid the Vietnamese was perhaps most graphically illustrated last
 year during the observance of the 30th anniversary of "Czechoslovak
 Volunteers to Spain."  On several occasions, as reported in the local press,
 military leaders complained of the apathy of today's youth in contrast to
 the situation during the Spanish Civil War.   In comparison with those days,
 according to one Government spokesman, "today there is no interest, let
 alone fervor, among young people for the war in Vietnam.."  The Deputy
 Minister of Defense was quoted in the Prague press as accusing the young
 generation of becoming blind pacifists  which, he charged, "is carrying
 peaceful coexistence too far!"
 Further in this regard, speculation about sending "volunteers" to
 Vietnam has become an occasion for a considerable number of jokes in
 Czechoslovakia.   Some youth are reported to be asking "on which side
 would we fight?" while others pose the more serious question of "why

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060005-8
 support the yellow peril?"  It is perhaps significant that the subject
 of "volunteers" is no longer publicized on the home front but, for the
 sake of appearances abroad, is occasionally resurrected in propaganda
 intended for foreign audiences.  A Radio Prague broadcast in English
 beamed to Africa on March 18, 1967, for example, had this to say:
 "Today's weapons are incomparably more destructive than any
 weapons in the world's history.  A nuclear war would destroy the
 whole world... Czechoslovakia is well aware of the danger that the
 war in Vietnam constitutes and is not only giving the fighting
 people of that country material and moral aid but is willing to
 send volunteers if asked by the people of the DRV.   The people of
 Czechoslovakia are not indifferent to the struggle waged by the
 oppressed nations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.  On the
 other hand, the fate of the Vietnamese people is the cause of the
 people of all continents, no matter how distant they are from this
 small Asian country."
 Was this a veiled hint that perhaps "volunteers" should come from
 the other "oppressed nations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America"?  A
 fortnight earlier, in the March 3, 1967, issue of BRATISLAVA PRAVDA,
 the following brief news item gave this interesting picture of what
 Czechoslovak soldiers have "pledged" to do instead of "volunteering"
 to go to Vietnam themselves:
 "Czechoslovak military personnel assigned to road maintenance
 units have pledged to completely equip one North Vietnamese company
 with the necessary basic infantry weapons, antichemical protection
 devices, and medical supplies.   So far they have collected 108,000
 korunas and blood donations from over 2,000 soldiers assigned to
 road maintenance units."
 Collections of money to purchase medical supplies and individual
 "donations" of blood by civilians have been reported periodically in
 recent months by the Czechoslovak radio and press.   On December 17, 1966,
 for example, the news agency CTK announced:
 "The Central Council of Cooperatives has given various goods,
 mainly tools, worth 500,000 korunas.   The same amount has been given
 to the fund by the regional Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the
 Central Slovakian region.  A high average -- 23 korunas per worker --
 has been obtained in the Jihlava and Trebis districts.   The collec'
 tion was expected to end at the beginning of the year, but it will
 not be closed; the Vietnam account will not be closed at a time
 when the American aggressors are escalating their barbarous air
 raids on the territory of the DRV."
 Czechoslovak media does not, of course, give any details on the
 conditions under which these "donations" were extracted nor does it
 give any report on the reaction which followed the announcement that the

 collection campaign -- often enforced by deductions from payrolls in
 advance -- would not be closed at the end of 1966.  One can easily
 surmise, however, the reaction which must have greeted the announcement
 on 20 March (see section on "Training" below) that 2,100 Vietnamese
 apprentices would be straining already overcrowded Czechoslovak facilities
 "for the next three to five years."
 Poland
 Mindful of the Poznan workers' riots of 1956 and the widespread
 reaction against measures to suppress Catholic Church celebrations of the
 country's Millenium a year ago, the Polish Government apparently is not
 pushing the Moscow directed campaign to collect money, blood, and other
 items from workers and peasants throughout Poland to send to Vietnam.
 Last April, there were signs in the Poznan area that definite opposition
 to the aid campaign was growing to serious proportions, and this might
 well explain the paucity of references in Polish media during the past
 year to the collections.
 Prior to last April contributions to the Vietnam aid. fund at the
 large Cegielski Works were taken from collective funds, with only a
 very few individual donations added to them.  At this point the workers
 became increasingly irritated. with new compulsory collections of 100
 zlotys and more each which were imposed on them, and as a result their
 attendance at city-wide meetings was excused since local Communist Party
 leaders feared they would be unable to control the workers' reaction to
 an obviously unpopular campaign.
 This February, however, there were a few reports on Warsaw Radio
 which showed that students were now being pressed to lead the campa-ign.
 On February 15, for example, the radio announced that "a total of
 8,000 zlotys has been collected by students and 'ecturers of the Second
 Warsaw Teachers Conference to aid fighting Vietnam."  The previous week
 the radio carried another report which showed how youth had been organ-
 ized to run the campaign which the Government had apparently decided
 could no longer be imposed on workers' groups.   On February 11 it announ-
 ced:
 "A total of 30'T cases of medicines, dressing material, and
 surgical instruments have been collected in Pomerania for fighting
 Vietnam.   Taking part in the collection were Union of Socialist
 Youth Circles, committees of the National Unity Front, school social
 organizations, and youth teams in enterprises from all of Bydogoszcz
 Voivodship."
 There was another indication the same month of popular dissatisfaction
 with the Polsih Government's policies.   In addition to youth groups another
 organization which Communist regimes usually exploit for such campaigns
 is the Church.   In Poland, some aid-for-Vietnam-campaign responsibilities
 have been assigned to Protestant groups, as witnessed by a report dis-

 seminated by the Polish News Agency on the 18 February meeting of the
 North Vietnamese Ambassador to Poland with the Superintendent of the
 Reformed Evangelical Church and the Bishop of the Augsburg Evangelical
 Church in Poland.   It stated:
 "During the meeting the Ambassador was told of the charity work
 carried on by the Polish Ecumenical Council and churches affiliated
 to it on behalf of the victims of bombings in the DRV and of the
 assistance of the World Council of Churches in Geneva, which has
 transferred 20,000 U.S. dollars to the Polish Ecumenical Council for
 aid to Vietnam."
 Significantly, the Polish News Agency did not mention how much --
 or how little -- money the Church had been able to raise from the people
 of Poland themselves.
 Hungary
 Indications that the Hungarian people have been disillusioned with
 demands for contributions to Vietnam date back to at least late 1965.
 Jena Fock, a Deputy Premier and Member of the Political Committee of
 the Hungarian Communist Party, felt constrained to make the following
 claim, obviously in an attempt to refute rumors to the contrary, in a
 speech at a chemical factory reported by the Hungarian News Agency on
 November 29, 1965:
 "Anybody is mistaken who assumes that in the question of
 assistance the Hungarian working people are in disagreement with
 the Government.   The Hungarian workers are urging the leaders --
 and this is common knowledge here at home -- that we should send
 even more aid to Vietnam..."
 Other officials have made statements lamely attributing Hungary's
 small amount of aid to its limited capabilities, rather than to popular
 disinterest among youth and workers.   On November 1, 1965, for example,
 Hungarian Youth League Secretary Lajos Mehes declared that "we are proud
 of the fact that, according to its ability, Hungary is helping the fight-
 ing people of Vietnam both morally and materially."
 By the end of 1966, however, the Communist Party had hit upon a
 scheme for organizing aid collections for Vietnam without interfering
 too much with Hungary's own needs at home: it "encouraged" people to
 work overtime or on Sunday and to "donate" their earnings to the campaign
 to send school and hospital equipment to Vietnam.   On December 24, for
 example, the Budapest Radio reported:
 "As proof of the Hungarian people's readiness to help and their
 sentiments of solidarity, in a year 30 million forints have been
 collected to aid the people of Vietnam.   Following the initiative of
 students of Budapest Lorand Eotvos University and young workers of

 the Cespel iron and metal works, young people gave up part of their
 free time and put in overtime or worked Sunday shifts in order to
 donate their extra earnings to Vietnam aid, schemes.   Some 21.5
 million forints were paid into the Communist Youth League solidarity
 account, from which 10.5 million forints were drawn out last summer
 and converted into gifts taken by a youth delegation to Hanoi.  This
 month 9 million forints were collected through the National Peace
 Council's 'One School and One Hospital for Vietnam' drive, and
 2 million forints were contributed to the medical aid fund,"
 Rumania
 Judging by the amount of references to "aid" for Vietnam in the
 Ritnanian press and on the radio, very little is being done.   The
 Bucharest radio on March 19, 1967, carried a report on a statement by
 North Vietnamese Ambassador Hoang Tu at a meeting the previous day at
 the Students House of Culture.   He reportedly said in conclusion:   "We
 express our sincere gratitude to the Rumanian Party, Government, and
 fraternal people for the valuable political, moral, and material support
 and aid given."  The Ambassador did not, however, give any statistics.
 One indication of how the people have greeted these continuing demands
 to "donate" to such causes, and in particular the disillusionment of the
 professional people in Rumania who have been forced to give their time,
 was printed in the July 27, 1966, issue of the Bucharest newspaper MUNCA.
 Doctor Magdalena Ungureanu was quoted as stating that she did not mind the
 extra demands placed on her to coordinate health prevention campaigns in
 her own district, but:
 "I do not consider it reasonable that the physician is obliged
 to mobilize the citizens, ask people to attend lectures, or recruit
 blood donors."
 Bulgaria
 A lack of interest in the "aid" campaigns is also shown by Bulgarian
 media, where the few scattered references to it are invariably prefaced
 by remarks concerning the limited resources Bulgaria has for -this,   The
 February 15, 1967, issue of Sofia's RABOTNICHESKO DELO, denouncing in
 vivid terms the "barbaric" air raids of the "imperialists" on the
 Vietnamese, quickly added, however, that "despite_the difficulties which
 they encounter in assisting the heroic Vietnamese people, their friends
 will not abandon them."  One can only guess what those "difficulties" are.
 In a similar vein, a spo.esman of the Foreign Ministry in Sofia was
 quoted by the Bulgarian News Agency on March 16, 1.967, as stating:
 "The Bulgarian people must resolutely condemn this new and
 dangerous expansion of U.S. aggression and in the future will
 continue, according to their possibilities, to render moral, political,
 and material assistance to the fraternal Vietnamese people."

 Albania
 No popular dissatisfaction has been reported from Albania -- for
 apparently the Albanians are too poor to send any individual aid to
 North Vietnam themselves.  As a matter of fact, while the other East
 European countries were announcing the collection of blood and money to
 be sent abroad, the Tirana Radio on January 26, 1967, reported that the
 crew of the Adem Reka drydock in Durres port had just received a ship-
 ment of gifts from the Third Company of the 4llth military unit of the
 Chinese People's Liberation Army.
 And even if the poor Albanians did have anything to send they might
 find it difficult to do so because of the lack of shipping facilities;
 it is doubtful that the Russians would carry it on their ships because
 of Albania's support of the Chinese in the Moscow-Peking rift.
 Apparently Albanian "aid" to North Vietnam is limited to vocal expres-
 sions of comradeship, as evidenced in this Tirana Radio report of a press
 conference statement at the North Vietnamese Embassy on December 16, 1966:
 "The DRV ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary spoke about
 the assistance which the Albanian people have given and continue to
 give to the Vietnamese people in their just struggle.   He said that
 the Albanian  people are always following the struggle of the Viet-
 namese people with the feelings of comrade in arms.  The Albanian
 people are very happy about the successes achieved by the Vietnamese
 people and are greatly shocked by the crimes committed by the American
 imperialists against the Vietnamese people in the North as well as in
 the South.  On this occasion, the DRV ambassador, on behalf of the
 Vietnamese people, expressed his gratitude for this assistance."
 Training
 On March 20 the Prague radio carried this news item:   "For 2,100
 Vietnamese families the name of Czechoslovakia will now have a special
 meaning because members of their families will spend the next three to
 five years in Czechoslovakia.   The first group of about 500 apprentices
 will arrive in Czechoslovakia at the beginning of July.   In addition to
 the 2,100 apprentices who will be trained in Czechoslovakia, an additional
 20,000 Vietnamese have already left or will leave for other countries of
 the Socialist camp for similar training.   The entire program is understand-
 ably directed toward the postwar reconstruction of Vietnam."
 For all of the East European countries this means just one more added
 burden being imposed on them to support the already unpopular war in Viet-
 nam.   Furthermore, it will add a very serious strain on local school
 facilities.   The Soviet Government paper IZVESTIA on January 17 devoted
 a major article to the problems of education in the USSR, in particular
 the shortage of school accomodations.   On March 22 Moscow Radio noted that
 "during the past year alone 500 Vietnamese were graduated from Soviet high-
 er educational establishments and became doctors, agronomists, teachers,
 and engineers," and on February 13 it had reported that there were now 3,000
 Vietnamese studying in the USSR.

 What will be the reaction when the additional thousands of Vietnamese
 which Radio Prague mentioned have to be accomodated?  One indication is
 given in the February 12 issue of Budapest's MAGYARORSZAG which had these
 remarks, among others, to make about the caliber and cost of foreign
 students in Hungary:
 "This school year the largest number of students coming to our
 homeland is from Vietnam, 30 more than last year... It has been found.
 that secondary instruction in the developing countries is very different
 from Hungarian training.   The length of preparatory study courses de-
 pends on the quality of the secondary schools of the home country and
 on the linguistic abilities of the student... Students who qualify and
 are selected are invited by our homeland, which provides the money
 for their studies.   On the other hand, scholarship students from
 Socialist countries study on the basis of exchange agreements and their
 own homeland supports them..."
 Undoubtedly each East European country will have to pay the cost for
 educating the Vietnamese "scholarship" students, whose previous scholastic
 training is apparently regarded as insufficient by them?
 Volunteers
 In a report from the United Nations headquarters published in the
 2 April 1967 WASHINGTON POST, Robert Estabrook notes that East Europeans
 are expressing their fears in private, in contrast to their public state-
 ments, that the effect of continued conflict in Vietnam may be to damage
 their countries' independence from the Soviet Union.  Mr. Estabrook contin-
 ued:
 "Already Communist-bloc countries are feeling a variety of
 pressures from Moscow indirectly attributable to the wa.r.   Some repre-
 sentatives here are worried lest Soviet involvement in North Vietnam
 increase and a demand be made on them for 'volunteer.'"
 It seems unlikely, however, that the Soviet Union will chance the
 blow to its international prestige by making another vain bid to stir up
 enthusiasm in the East European satellites for "volunteers" to go fight
 the "imperialists" in Vietnam.   Earlier attempts to do this failed.   The
 few young men who did sign up did so., it later became apparent, in the
 hope that they would be captured in Vietnam and thus escape to the Free
 World.
 Note in the section on Czechoslovakia above that this country says it
 is "willing to send volunteers if asked" by North Vietnam;  Prague radio's
 listeners in Africa can infer, however, that Czechoslovakia hopes it will
 not be asked and that it would be a better idea for people in the Third
 World to "volunteer" instead.   This suspicion is borne out by the fact
 that the subject of "volunteers" for Vietnam is not publicized inside
 Communist countries today; it is apparently :;nly for export.  On 7 February
 1967 the Uruguayan Communist Party paper EL POPULAR printed an interview
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060005-8

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400060005-8
 with Vadim Nekrasov, the assistant director of the Soviet Communist Party
 paper PRAVDA who remarked in passing, but with no further details:
 "Our promise to send volunteers to North Vietnam, should it be
 requested, still stands.   Thousands of our youth are ready to go as
 volunteers to fight shoulder to shoulder with their Vietnamese brothers."
 Not only are the Communists merely paying lip service for foreign
 audiences to the "volunteer" offer, but they are also putting the squeeze
 on foreign students in their countries to "contribute" from their scanty
 allowances to the monetary aid collections.  A dispatch by. the Czechoslovak
 News Agency on 26 January 1967, for example, reported that "a gift of money
 to aid the struggle of the people of Vietnam was handed over to the
 National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam bureau in Prague today
 by a three-member delegation representing the Union of Syrian Students
 studying in Prague."  A somewhat similar "bite" was being taken out of the
 earnings of foreign artists, as became apparent when the East German news
 agency ADN reported on 29 December 1966 that the East German Artists Agency
 was holding a "solidarity drive" for Vietnam which had collected over
 8,000 marks from more than 400 artists from Britain, France, Italy, Greece,
 Cuba, Brazil, Japan, and other countries.
 Aid Material
 Finally, as if all the problems enumerated above were not enough, the
 quality and quantity of aid goods being sent from East Europe to North
 Vietnam pose a very large question.   Can the Vietnamese really count on
 reliable aid continuing?
 Some East European countries are reported to be sending as "aid" goods
 which they cannot sell on the open market to the non-Communist world.
 Others are using material which is produced "above plan" or by tired work-
 ers on overtime shifts -- in other words, that which is left over after
 the domestic needs of the East European countries are met.  What this
 means in terms of foodstuffs packaged in substandard metal containers and
 subjected to the heats and pressures of the long trip to Vietnam can only
 be guessed.
 In a lighter vein, the problems faced -- and one wonders how success-
 fully solved -- by workers in fashioning aid supplies to meet the special
 requirements of the Vietnamese were highlighted by Willi Zahlbaum, secre-
 tary of the East German Vietnam Committee, in the February 1967 ARMEE
 RUNDSCHAU:
 "I must mention the 'One Thousand Bicycles for Vietnam' drive,
 which required specially constructed bicycles to meet the relatively
 small size of the Vietnamese as well as the geographic conditions of
 the country.   We try very hard to support our Vietnamese comrades in
 maintaining their civilian production."

 But however much the Communist Party officials in East Europe try to
 solve the problems at home of collecting and producing aid for Vietnam, the
 much more serious problem of getting the material to the Vietnamese in its
 original condition -- good, bad, or indifferent -- and amount has been com-
 plicated by the recent moves of the Chinese Communists to interfere with
 all supplies coming through China from the Soviet Union.
 The LONDON TIMES correspondent in Japan reported on 8 March 1967 that
 there was an "almost total disruption of communications and intense short-
 ages of food and fuel" in North Vietnam.   He continued:
 "Specifically, it is said that there is a dire shortage of rice
 and no certainty that a million tons needed from. China will be forth-
 coming.. .Aid from Communist countries, it is stated with a shrug, can
 give little respite in this disaster. These statements are, of course,
 unexampled in that they come from Communist representatives sympathetic
 to Hanoi."
 More details of this problem appeared eight days later in a report by
 the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR correspondent in Saigon who did give a
 number of examples -- which the Communist sources cited by the London
 correspondent were seemingly unwilling to do -- of how the ideological
 dispute between Peking and Moscow was putting a "squeeze" on Hanoi.   The-
 MONITOR correspondent also noted:
 "When the Soviets recently charged China with slowing and even
 stealing aid goods being transshipped to Vie-;nam, Hanoi Radio blamed.
 the misunderstanding on fabricated stories by Western news agencies.
 'China has wholeheartedly helped transport to Vietnam adequately and
 according to schedule the aid goods from the Soviet Union,' the
 broadcast said."
 Of course Hanoi might have been only attempting to play both ends against
 the middle in this case by seeming to side with Peking, which it knows has
 not been sending sufficient aid of its own, and at the same time subtly
 calling to Moscow's attention its feeling that the Soviets and. East Europeans
 have not only decreased their aid but have also sent stocks of obsolescent
 material under the apparent pretext that the North Vietnamese are incapable
 of using better goods and equipment.
 Moscow has charged in a number of newspaper articles and in broadcasts
 for both the Soviet and foreign audiences that the Chinese Communists are
 interfering in the aid being sent to Vietnam.  A broadcast in Mandarin on
 5 February, for example, charged that the Chinese with "arbitrary hindrance"
 and "deliberate destruction" of aid supplies.  Two weeks later, the Prague
 daily RUDE PRAVO published a report of a statement by Soviet expert
 N. Federov, who had recently returned from North Vietnam.   One can easily
 imagine what the readers of the Czechoslovak Communist Party organ thought
 about the continuing demands being placed on them. to supply aid when they
 saw this in the article:                                                        they

 "Sometimes it happens that this or that equipment does get to
 North Vietnam but cannot be put into operation.  Why?  Because
 somewhere in China the curious Red Guards dismantled the equipment
 and then forgot to return some important component.   It is clear that
 such 'curiosity' must be paid for by the Vietnamese people themselves.
 Moreover, the transport of Soviet shipments for Vietnam over Chinese
 territory is delayed several weeks.. .My Soviet colleagues and Viet-
 namese comrades also know of some cases where the latest types of
 Soviet combat equipment, such as supersonic fighter aircraft, were
 replaced by Chinese officials with used, obsolete models from the
 Chinese Army."
 If, as one is led to believe by the question noted in the section on
 Czechoslovakia above and by an article in the November 1966 issue of
 DER NATIONALE DEMOKRAT of East Berlin, there is a fear of a better armed
 Communist China among East Europeans -- the paper noted that "in several
 party meetings the fear has been expressed for months of the so-called
 yellow peril... emanating from China's possession of the atomic bomb and
 the adventurist policy propagated by the Chinese leaders" -- then it
 seems highly likely that the East Europeans will be more and more reluc-
 tant to respond to future demands to supply aid for Vietnam which may be
 seized by the Chinese on the way.

 Miscellaneous from newspaper stories:
 Vietnamese and Free World experts are engaged in a growing effort to
 restore agricultural production so that the country may once again
 become one of Asia's major rice exporters.   Last year, 1.5 million acres
 (600,000 hectares) of crops were treated for insects and plant diseases.
 And 78,000 acres (31,000 hectares) were brought under cultivation.
 More than 30 nations have assisted South Vietnam to make great strides
 in education - even in the midst of war.  In 1966, 4,600 new school
 classrooms were built, 4,000 new teachers were trained and 8 million
 textbooks were distributed.
 In 1966 public health was given a boost by Free World nations and
 volunteer medical teams from several countries helped administer over
 12 million immunizations against contagious diseases.  These teams also
 treated more than 500,000 Vietnamese for various illnesses.
 By the end of 1966, 27,000 South Vietnamese had been specially trained in
 "pacification" or "revolutionary development" techniques.  Organized in
 59-man teeams, they are being sent back to their native provinces to
 restore order and to help bring back normal life in the hamlets.  More
 of these teams are being trained in 1967.
 The first Australian medical team arrived from Melbourne's Alfred Hospi-
 tal in early 1966.  It was headed by Dr. Ian Ferguson whose team took
 on abnormally large case loads of both civilian and military-caused
 casualties.  The Australians were operating morning and afternoon to
 handle the 200 or more surgical cases assigned them every month and
 within six months the post-operative incidence of infection was remark-
 ably low; also greatly reduced was the length of time required for
 patient recovery.   In addition to giving lectures at Saigon's teaching
 hospital, Cho Ray, the Australians gave on-the-job demonstrations and
 instructions, and treated many cases peculiar to the tropics such as
 tuberculosis.
 Australia was one of the first nations to respond to the need for
 medical services in Vietnam.   Staff members from the Royal Melbourne
 Hospital and from St. Vincent's Hospital, also in Melbourne, were the
 first to answer the Government of Australia's call for volunteers in
 October 1964.  Other volunteer medical teams and individuals have gone
 to South Vietnam from around the world including the Rupublic of China,
 Italy, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, and the
 Netherlands.

 rovincial capital in a station wagon.
 round them the countryside was un-
 der strict V.C. control. Under them,
 uried in the rutted road, was the possi-
 bility of V.C. mines.
 But, most important, ahead of them
 lay the district towit;of Son Tinh with a
 small dispensary and .r-'waiting line of
 patients ranging from shrieking infants.
 to wrinkled oldsters.
 Olivera nodded as Fenelon explained:
 "Everything around here on both sides
 of the'road belongs to the.V.C., but this
 is the only way to get to the dispensary,
 and the people will be expecting us."
 It appears that the V.C. tolerates medi-
 cal teams-and for a practical reason :
 Often the V.C. infiltrates its own sick
 and wounded into the dispensary lines.
 Iso, the V.C. knows that the I.R.C.
 Balers regularly treat V.C. prisoners in
 Vietnam camps.
 The day PARADE: accompanied Fene-

 ade  without  incident,  and,  sure
 nough, the one-story frame dispensary
 as jammed with outpatients - men,
 vonien, boys, girls, babies, old crones.
 There are plenty of:-problems:.

 Perhaps this comment from one of the
 ex-refugee doctors best explains not only
 the situation, but. the devotion of the
 mcdicnl team:
 "The V.C. prisoners are very 111, and
 after you give them care, their eyes, full
 of fear and hatred, change to an expres-
 sion of affection and gratitude.... The

 cally rotten with disease.... We cured
 him. You should have seen the look of
 gratitude ... for he was suffering hor-
 ribly. .
 "1 think taking care of the prisoners is
 terribly important as they don't know
 anything about us except what their
 Communist leaders tell them...."
 And so it goes with these Western
 refugees so devoted to helping Eastern
 refugees. Fenclon and Olivera    both
 university graduates in earlier days in
 their homelands-are in for at least an
 18-month hitch.
 After that, they can settle down at

 pital and 17 health centers have been
 built to combat, among'other ills, the
 cholera and plague that endanger the
 area. In all, some 200 projects are com-
 pleted or under way, and. the govern-
 ment estimates that the youths, with a
 budget of 10 million piastres ($84,-
 700), have generated 30 million pias-
 tres ($254,200) worth of construction.

 quarters, a stately home usually occu-
 pied exclusively by the district chief,
 has been converted into a campground
 for the new cadres, looks like an unsu-
 pervised fraternity house with its clut-
 ter of cots and guitars. The new district
 chief, Mai Nhu Manh, a. graduate of the
 National Institute of Administration,
 boasts only a corner bed with a mos-
 quito net. Says a young colleague, Law
 Graduate Doan Thanh Liem: "The only
 thing that is important to us is a change
 in mentality, a sense of community."
 Only  one  American,  a  24-year-old
 named Charles Sweet, is advising the
 youths, and he was not allowed into the
 district for three months.
 In an address dedicating the district's
 first student-built housing, a row of cot-
 tages freshly painted Dutch yellow with
 blue and green shutters, Ky said: "I
 can only hope to renew the govern-
 ment as your cadres have renewed this
 hamlet." Moreover, he has given the
 young reformers the go-ahead to take
 over two adjoining districts, which with'
 District 8 will comprise a boy-state of
 600,000 inhabitants. The ultimate com-
 pliment is that Viet Cong infiltration to
 and from the capital through District 8,
 thanks to a growing flow of informa-
 tion on Communist activities by its in-
 habitants, has been virtually wiped out. '

 example of Vietnamese self-help. It took
 root. a year ago, when a dozen youth
 leaders petitioned him to let them take
 over an entire province and demon-

 PRESS RELEASE
 External Aid Office, Canada                                       April 1967
 Canadian Government
 August 2, 1966
 The Honorable Paul Martin, Secretary of State for External Affairs,
 announced today that 165,000 Saigon schoolchildren will be immunized
 '
 s
 against poliomyelitis this fall with oral vaccine supplied under Canada
 External Aid program,
 The immunization has been undertaken by the Vietnamese Ministry of
 Health as a pilot project in a planned campaign to protgct all Vietnamese
 children from six months to 12 years against a disease which ranks with
 tuberculosis and malaria as a serious health problem ir}southeast Asia.
 (In Canada, following intensive vaccination programs, the disease
 has been virtually eradicated.  Complete eradication of the disease in
 Canada is considered by medical authorities to be a reasonable goal.)
 Mr. Martin's announcement marked the latest development in Canada's
 program of medical aid to Vietnam, to which more than a million dollars
 has been allocated this year.  Last month, Canada shipped the first of
 ten pre-packaged emergency hospital units for integration into South
 Vietnam's provincial hospitals system and work was begun on a tuberculosis
 clinic at Quang Ngai.
 Mr. Martin said that while the Canadian program of assistance in
 Vietnam has grown considerably in the past three years, "one cannot
 minimise the difficulties of mounting quickly a large and effective pro-
 gram in the circumstances which now-prevail in that country."
 Since 1953, Canada has allocated almost $6 million to development
 assistance in Vietnam.  A total of 339 students has been brought to Canada
 and 183 of them, the largest trainee group from any country, are now
 studying in academic and technical training institutes, working mainly in
 the French language.

 Faculty of Sciences at Hue University which will cost about $125,000.
 Canada is increasing its aid to South Viet-Nam and has allocated
 $1 million for medical assistance this fiscal year including providing
 ten 200-bed emergency hospital units.  The first two units  have arrived
 and have been installed at Phan Tiet and at Phu Tho near Saigon.  A
 Canadian doctor and technicians visited Viet-Nam in the fall to inspect
 potential sites.  Canada has sent over half a million doses of polio
 vaccine for Vietnamese school children, and another 150,000 doses are
 being prepared for shipment to Viet-Nam.

 Six other nations whose help does not fall under the Free World
 Assistance Program have provided valuable assistance to Viet-Nam 1h
 economic and humanitarian fields.
 France
 Since 1956, France has contributed about $111 million in assistance
 to South Viet-Nam.
 France has nearly 500 persons servl.ng in South Viet-Nam.  Among
 them are 65 experts under France's program of economic and technical
 assistance, including 32 physicians, professors and other medical person-
 nel.                 Under its cultural programs, 471 professors (350 French and 121
 Vietnamese) are teaching at 9 French teaching institutions, and 30
 French professors are at Vietnamese institutions.  France provided in
 1.965 for Vietnamese to study in France, 55 fellowships for technical
 training, and 85 academic fellowships.
 France has provided low-interest credits of iflO million francs
 (20 million dollars) for financing imports of French equipment for
 Vietnamese industry, a grant of 500,000 francs ($100,000) for equipment
 for L'Ecole Nationale d'Ingenieurs des Arts Industriels.
 .In 1960 France extended a low-interest credit of. 70 million francs
 ($12 million) to aid construction of the major coal and chemical complex
 at An Hoa-Nong Son south of Da Nang which is well underway.   It also
 provided a low-interest, five-year credit of 60 million francs ($12
 million) for construction of Viet-Nam's largest cement-producing complex
 with plants at Hatien and Thu I)uc.   In 1964, France provided a 930,000
 frsnc($186,000) grant for the installation of a training
 center for
 electrical technicians, and in 1965 a gift of 1.25 million francs ($250,00O)
 for teaching equipment, primarily in. the medical field.
 Ireland
 .The Irish people have contributed 4,1,000 ($2,800) for Vietnamese
 flood victims through their Red Cross.
 Israel
 Israel made a gift of pharmaceutical supplies for flood victims.
 Norway
 Norway sent a contribution through the International Red Cross for
 flood victims in February 1965,

 Pakistan
 Pakistan made a financial contribution for assistance to flood vic-
 tims and donated clothing for them.
 Switzerland
 The Swiss have provided microscopes for the University of Saigon.
 The Swiss Red Cross has sent an 11-man medical team through the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross to work in a provincial hospital in
 The United Nations and its specialized agencies are also making
 significant contributions to the social and economic development of Viet-
 Nam.  Under the UN Development Program at least 37 technical assistance
 programs are being implemented this year and more are being planned for
 1967 and 1968.  These programs range across such varied fields as maternal
 and child health, soil survey, labor administration, educational plan-
 ning, telecommunications and postal services.  Among the participating
 agencies are ILO, FAO, UNESCO, WHO, ICAO, ITU, IAEA, UPU, and the Depart-
 ment of Economic and Social Affairs of the UN.  In addition, UNICEF is
 lending financial support to a number of programs in the health and
 child care fields.
 Several major projects financed by the Special Fund of the.UN
 Development Program are about to get under way. A National Technical
 Center (total international contribution approximately $1.5 million),
 with UNESCO as the executing agency, has been approved by the Governing
 Council of the UNDP and is now becoming operational.  Near-agreement has-
 been reached on a Fisheries Institute including exploratory and experi-
 mental fishing in the waters of the South China Sea, to be executed by
 FAO, and on a Social Welfare Training Center to be executed by-the Bureau
 of Social Affairs of the UN.  ECAFE is also pressing ahead with projects
 of benefit to all the nations in the Mekong Basin, and has undertaken
 surveys of irrigation, hydro-electric facilities, and bridge construction
 projects in Viet-Nam.

 [NEW TIMES-Moscow-No. 10e March 8, 19671
 r~DIA   e    her   ourt  general
 election on February 15-21. Eight
 national and eleven regional parties
 eothpeted for the 52t seats In the Lok
 Sabha (House of the People) and the
 3,503 seats in the Legislative Assemblies
 of 16 states and 8 territories. There
 were no elections in Nagaland state
 and In two Union Territories.
 The final results are not yet known
 at this writing, but the general picture
 is clear enough. The !radian National
 Congress party has again won a major-
 ity and will form the new government.
 Bpt it is a greatly reduced majority: It
 has 278 seats in the new Lok Sabha,
 compared with 361 in the last one.
 Its losses were still greater in the
 state  elections.  It was defeated . in
 Kerala, Madras, West Bengal, Orissa,
 and Bihar, where the new governments
 will be. formed by opposition parties.
 In three . other states,  Uttar. Pradesh,
 Punjab and Rajasthan, it might be able
 to form a government In co-operation
 with other parties and independents.:
 This is the worst defeat the Congress
 has suffered in the twenty years since
 Independence. And not only because It
 lost so many seats, but also because
 some of its prominent leaders were un-
 seated. The list Includes the party's
 President,  Mr.  Kamaraj,  the  Chief
 Ministers of Punjab, Bihar, Madras and
 West Bengal, and ten Ministers of the
 central government. Among the latter
 are Choudhuri (Finance), Subratnanidm
 (Food  and Agriculture),  S. K. Patil
 (Railways),  Manubhai   Shah   (Com-
 merce). More than 50 Congressmen who
 held ministerial posts in the various
 stater were  defeated  too.  All the
 defea.ed Ministers have tendered their
 resignations.

 These elections were a serious tes
 for all parties. India has had to conten
 with many difficulties In recent years
 There  were  border  clashes.  whit
 weighed  heavily  on  the   nationa
 finances and increased political tension
 The reactionary forces have been more
 active, and ever since the .death o
 Nehru in 1964 there has been more
 confusion within the Copgress. Still
 another factor is the sharpening diva
 sion in the democratic mass   move-
 ment.
 Living standards, never high, have
 been further depressed by rising price
 and taxes. The position has been ag-
 gravated by chronic food shortages, and
 actual  famine In  some  areas.  As a
 result, the economic position has de-
 teriorated sharply; India's external debt
 now  stands at  about 50,000  million
 rupees.
 The election returns show how the
 people reacted to this and to the policy
 of the government party.
 I  wtttaelsed  the  three  previous
 parliament4ty  elections  and, frankly
 speaking, I did not expect the National
 Congress to lose so much or its prestige
 and authority, built up particularly In
 the struggle for Independence.
 However, the election figures are
 contradictory. Some prominent Right-
 wing Congressmen, among them S. K.
 Patti and Atulya Ghosh, were defeated,
 but so were prominent Left-wingers.
 Krishna Menon  (who withdrew from
 the Congress shortly before the elec-
 tions) and K. D. Malaviya. True, the
 Indian press emphasizes that the Right.
 Ists made a special effort to prevent
 their re-election.
 The results show a marked accretion
 of strength for Rightist parties both In
 the Lok Sabha and in several states, The
 Swatantra,   which  speaks  for  Big
 Business and  the big landowners, in-
 creased Its Lok Sabha representation
 from 18 to 43, and the chauvinist Jan
 Sangh from 14 to 35. They will probably
 try to form anti-Congress governments
 In Orissa and Bihar in alliance with
 other reactionary groups. The Congress
 sustained  a  heavy  defeat  also  in
 Madras,    where  Dravida    Munnetra
 Kazhagam, a South-Indian nationalistic
 party, will apparently form a one-party
 government.
 The Rightists adroitly exploited the
 widespread discontent over economic
 difficulties,  religious  and communal
 prejudices,    linguistic,  territorial and
 other issues, and in some areas also
 separatist trends. The Right-wing parties
 were financed by Indian and foreign
 capital  and supported by some  U.S.
 agencies. The Bombay weekly Blitz says
 these agencies used part of the rupee
 revenue  from the supply  of PL 480
 American wheat  to finance  obliging
 candidates.   The   Indian   Express

 Washington  correspondent  says .the
 U.S. wanted to see Swatanlra  strong
 ,enough In be reckoned with.
 It would he wrong, nevertheless, In
 .believe that these were the only factors
 ighich enabled the, Rightists to strength-
 en Ihcit position in the Lok Sabha and
 the state assemblies. There were other
 factors,  first of all the failure  of the
 Congress government to carry out its
 programme of raising living standards,
 effectively  checking  the      growth  of
 prices,      taxes and unemployment and
 solving India's formidable food problem.
 The          contradictory results  of the
 elections can be seen also in the fact
 that many leading reactionary candi-
 dates suffered de{cat. Mention might be
 made of Swatantra President,  N. G.
 Ranga, and one,o[ the more rabid anti-
 Communists,  Acharja Krlpaianl, who
 stood as an "independent."
 The Left democratic  forces made
 certain progress. The Communists in-
 creased their Lok Sabha representation
 from 29 to .10 (the Communist Parly~
 21  seats, and the parallel Communist
 Party I(j). The United Socialist Party,
 founded  in 1964,, won 23 scats.  The
 Uniled Left Front, which included the
 CPI and the parallel Party, won a spec-
 tacular victory In Kerala, gaining 116
 out or the 133 scats in the Legislative
 Assembly. In West Bengal the contest
 was won by the United Left Front, ithe
 People's United Left Front and the Po-
 polar Socialist  Party which after the
 elections agreed to form a coalition
 government.
 There is every evidence that the Left
 could have gained much more were it
 not for differences and division In Its
 tanks, including the Communist move-
 ment.                                                                    It will he recalled  that three
 years ago, In 1964, the Communist Party
 split nod a parallel party was formed:
 With the exception of Kerala, It refused
 to join with the Communist Party In a-
 united  Left  bloc.                                                                            More,  In  some
 constituencies    West   Bengal,   for
 Instance) It fought  the     Communist
 candidates, The Indian press says that
 this   disoriented   democraliaminded
 voters; worsened the position of Left
 candidates and played into the hands
 of reaction. Wherever the Left forces
 united,    they    scored impressive
 victories.
 The new Congress government will
 evidently  have  to  rerknn  with the
 lessons of the elections in shaping its
 policy. The election setbacks, the Hind-
 ustan Times says, do not mean that the
 Congress has entirely ,lost the confid-
 ence of the people, but they are sure to
 shake up the party.
 That is true, for though the Congress,
 still commands a majority in the Lok
 Sabha,  the election results  have in
 many    ways created  n new political
 situation to "lndia.

 March 13', 1967
 After the Fall-Who Will Lead?
 hough the echoes of its election crash suggested a moderation of factional ex-
 T were still reverberating from Madras  tremism which boded well for the future
 to Uttar Pradesh, the time came last of a genuine democratic opposition in
 week for India's once-proud Congress India. Jan Sangh spokesmen turned their
 Party to gather up the fragments. Pain- attention from the controversial slaughter
 fully, it began pulling itself together for of cows toward the critical housing short-
 what may well be the bitterest task that   age, and the pro-Peking Communists,
 can befall a badly battered political par- noted one American observer, "seem
 ty: continuing to govern the populace pathetically eager to get rid of their
 that has rebuffed it.
 The trouble was that India's voters,
 though clearly seized with a massive
 urge to "throw the rascals, out," had not
 been able to agree at all on whom to put
 in the rascals' place. In Kerala, the elec-
 torate turned to the Communists. But in
 neighboring Madras, a group of Tamil
 regionalists called the Dravidian Progres-
 sive Federation (D.M.K.) carried the
 day. And in Orissa, the nod went to a co-
 alition of maharajas centered around the
 conservative Swatantra Party. And so, for
 want of any real nationwide alternative,
 Congress crept back into power in Pare
 liament, chastened but still top dog.
 Its majority in the Lok Sabha (the
 lower house of Parliament), once a tow-
 ering 221, was lopped down to a mere
 35. But another statistic was far more
 telling: while Congress was reduced to
 278 seats, the second largest party,
 Swatantra, boasted a mere 44. Indeed,
 India's Parliament, except for the Con-
 gress Party, is still a tangle of factions.
 The Communists come in two flavors-
 pro-Moscow and pro-Peking. There are
 two types of socialists, r-fled Praja and
 Sarnyukta. There are two splinters of
 the right wing: the business-oriented
 Swatantra and the populist, fervently
 Hindu Jan Sangh. And there seemed
 little chance that on the national level
 all these factions could cooperate-ex-
 cept on negative propositions.
 Strange Embraces: In the state gov-
 ernments, however, things were differ-
 ent. In the balloting in sixteen of India's
 states, Congress lost its majority in no
 fewer than eight legislatures. And in
 these states, wherever a single anti-Con-
 gress party did not win outright control,
 elaborate coalitions were hatched to
 keep Congress out at almost any cost.
 This produced some strange and seem-
 ingly unholy alliances; in Rajasthan, the
 Communists joined hands with Jan Sangh
 and Swatantra while in Uttar Pradesh,
 Jan Sangh teamed up with the Sam-
 yukta socialists. Startling as some of
 these embraces were, however, they
 pro-Chinese tag.
 of less interest than the question which
 obsesses New Delhi: could Indira Gan-
 dhi hold on to her job? As Prime Minister
 during a year marked by food shortages
 and repeated outbreaks of mass violence,
 Mrs. Gandhi's record has been no better
 than indifferent, and such a pilot would
 normally be dropped after steering her
 party onto such a damaging electoral
 reef. Bqt it will not be easy to displace
 her from the helm. While other Congress
 leaders-including some of her main de-
 tractors such as party president Kumara-
 swami Kamaraj-were routed at the
 polls, Indira Gandhi scored a resounding
 victory in her home constituency.
 Cassandra: Mrs. Gandhi's potential ri-
 vals for the Prime Ministership, more-
 over, have handicaps of their own. For-
 mer Finance Minister Morarji Desai, a
 tough 71-year-old ascetic who twice be-
 fore has sought the top job in vain, has
 never concealed his contempt for Mrs.
 Gandhi's administration. "Present leader-
 ship has failed," he told NEWSWEEK last
 week. "If it continues along the present
 lines, it will be a disaster both to the par-
 ty and the country." But his self-appoint-
 ed role as Congress's Cassandra since
 1963 and his distinct lack of humility
 have never endeared Desai to the party.
 Perhaps the best man for the job
 would be the strong and skillful Home
 Minister, Y.B. Chavan, whom Nehru
 brought into the Cabinet in 1963 when
 V.K. Krishna Menon was forced out dur-
 ing the Chinese border debacle. But at
 53-which is young by Congress Party
 standards-Chavan is generally conceded
 to be Mrs. Gandhi's logical successor
 whenever she departs, and he is suffi-
 ciently astute not to jeopardize that sta-
 tus by overeagerness. "I shall support
 Indira Gandhi," he has announced re-
 peatedly in recent weeks. By the same
 token, Mrs.  Gandhi would probably
 throw her support to him if that ap-
 peared the only way to head off a vic-
 tory for Desai.
 Just a Reprieve: Most likely, how-
 ever, when the Congress Party's parlia-
 mentary representatives meet this week-
 end tp decide upon their leadership,
 Mrs. Gandhi will again be chosen. But
 this will be a reprieve rather than a final
 verdict. For the first time since she be-
 came Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi
 stands alone: most of the old Congress
 kingmakers are gone, and many of her
 younger advisers were also swept away
 in the electoral debacle. Urgent deci-
 sions have been long postponed, and
 now, many Indian pundits believe, Mrs.
 Gandhi must either prove her capacity
 for leadership or else face the prospect
 of being ousted from office within a year.
 End of an Epoch
 Inevitably, the dramatic changes in
 India's political spectrum have inspired
 considerable gloomy punditry. There has
 been talk of looming political stalemate
 in the world's largest democracy and
 even the nervous suggestion that India's
 cen'ral government may have been dan-
 gerously weakened in its authority. But
 from New Delhi last week, NER'SWEEK
 correspondent Edicarrl Behr, who served
 with the British Army in India in World
 War II and has revisited the country
 nearly every year since, filed the follow-
 ing rather different interpretation of the
 setback suffered by the Congress Party:
 Jawaharlal Nehru died in May 1964,
 but was buried politically only last week
 when the Congress Party he had or-
 ganized                                                                                                and  led  suffered  shattering
 losses in India's fourth general election.
 Congress's disaster was a triumph for
 neither right nor left; it was quite simply,
 a nationwide rejection of the monolithic
 party that has held power since India
 became independent twenty years ago.
 By rights, the defeat should have
 come years earlier. But this is a land of
 political life after death: leaders are
 revered long after they have fallen and
 their policies are preserved as a token of
 pious  respect.  Even  here,  however,
 memories pale as generations pass. The
 rout of the Congress Party had many
 causes, but not the least of them was
 that almost half of India's 250 million
 voters were babes in arms when Gandhi
 was killed in 1947. "The Congress image,
 with its constant references to the strug-
 gles of long ago, its emphasis on home-

 spun clothes; its' pious blend of quietism
 and socialism, just isn't relevant to India
 any more," reflected at  distinguished
 Indian political observer nList week.
 Indira Gandhi, elected to the Prime
 Ministership last year largely because
 she is Nehru's daughter and strikingly
 resembles him, has had more than her
 share of bad luck, including two dis-
 astrous crop failures within a year. Put
 the Congress leadership, as a whole,
 richly deserved its fate. Long before
 Nehru 's death, Congress had begun a
 steady  downward  slide.  "Somewhere

 party official, "we lost our idealism, our
 purity and our sense of dedication."
 'A11 Thieves': In recent years, the rule
 of the Congress Party has come to be de-
 rided as "government of the politician,
 by the politician, for the politician." At
 its best, the effectiveness of Congress
 leaders was that of manipulators rather
 than statesmen. With some notable ex-
 ceptions, the party's bosses-especially
 in the state governments-became tar-
 nished with corruption. "If you can point

 state," challe11 e(I the Rani of Gwalior in

 Before this election, many Congress
 politicians treated their constituents as

 India on the eve or elections
 S. A. DANCE [Chairman, Communist Party of India]      CPYRGHT
 INDIA'S  RULING  CLASS  politicians  are
 very fond of telling the world that India is
 the largest democracy in the world. They will
 not agree to qualify it and say that it is the
 largest bourgeois democracy.
 And due to realism or perhaps scorn, they
 will also not call it socialist democracy, de-
 spite the fact that for the last fifteen years
 they have been claiming to build "socialism"
 in Indiat
 No, it is just democracy-and the largest
 one. They advertise this particularly when in
 America.
 India touched the figure of 500 million
 population last year.
 Thus, it is the second largest population in
 the world, China's being the first.
 The most outstanding fact that makes it a
 democracy is that India is governed by a Par-
 liament, which is elected every five years on
 the basis of adult franchise. Since indepen-
 dence came in 1947 and the Constitution of
 the Republic of the Indian Union was adopt-
 ed on January 26, 1950 we have had three
 general elections-first, in 1952, second in
 1957 and third in 1962. And the fourth is
 coming in February 1967.
 We are a democracy in this sense. More-
 over, the Constitution guarantees to every
 citizen not only to vote and elect a Parlia-
 ment and Government. It also guarantees cer-
 tain fundamental democratic rights and lays
 down directive principles to guide state poli-
 cy. The rights and principles by themselves
 are no doubt good, if properly implemented.
 For example, it was because these rights came
 to be established in 1950 that the Commu-
 nist Party, trade union and other organiza-
 tions which had been declared illegal and sup-
 pressed in 1948 were legalized and thousands
 of our people were released from prison.
 But within the framework of this very Con-
 stitution and the Fundamental Rights, a new
 law called the Preventive Detention Act was
 passed in 1952 under which once again many
 political workers continued to be imprisoned.
 And since 1962 and the India-China con-
 flict, the country has been under a state of
 Emergency, by which, though the Parliament
 sits and deliberates as before, all the Funda-
 mental Rights, which were claimed to be the
 basic ingredients of this largest democracy,
 have been suspended, without any remedy
 befa- th. Supreme E;e"rt of the land:

 Defense of India Rules, the necessity for
 which vanished long ago, thousands have been
 sent to jail for the mere expression of politi-
 cal opinions or for conducting strikes or other
 struggles for the defense of people's rights
 and living.
 In short, we have a Parliament and we
 have elections to the Parliament despite the
 state of Emergency. You may say that elec-
 tions are free, as far as they can be in a bour-
 geois democracy, where the power of the
 purse, the press and the policy is in the hands
 of the ruling bourgeoisie and its landlord
 allies. You may form any political party and
 nominate candidates. And if your candidate
 gets the highest vote as against his other
 rivals, he is declared elected. The vote is cast
 by the name of each candidate and his sym-
 bol which is given to him for identification by
 illiterate voters. The vote is not for the Party
 as is the case in some countries. Nor is there
 proportional representation  in the voting
 system.
 Out of a population of 500 million people,
 240 million are registered voters in this year.
 In the 1962 elections they numbered 216 mil-
 lion. Thus one can see that the number of re-
 gistered voters in India is fifty million more
 than the total population of America, and ten
 million more than the population of the USSR.
 The vastness of this number itself would show
 how difficult it is for a party not In power
 and without the vast resources of the bour-
 geoisie to mobilize the people for the vote.
 We have direct elections to the Parliament
 of the whole country. But the country is di-
 vided into 17 States roughly on linguistic and
 historical basis. Then there are 9 territorial
 areas under the Union Government.
 The 17 State Assemblies also are elected
 on the same day by the same voter in the
 same booth but with a separate ballot box.
 The following table shows the number of vot-
 ers, seats and booths in the coming elections.

 Party and wielding influence from behind,
 have now split among themselves and some
 of them are standing for election against the
 Congress, which also has its own monopolists
 and princes in its fold and on its list of can-
 didates.
 The forces of extreme reaction have forced
 a split on the ruling Congress Party, in order
 to make it come out wholly on their aide and
 give up whatever of non-alignment or anti-
 colonialism and independent development is
 left in its policies. The forces of the Right
 are consolidating at a faster pace than before.
 At such a time, the democratic opposition
 should have united faster and better. But they
 have not done so. That is the most serious
 lag in the situation which, if not overcome,
 may lead to a situation detrimental to the in-
 dependence of the country and the well-being
 of the people. Some say that if this is the
 situation, would it not be wise for the left
 democratic parties to unite with those ele-
 ments in the Congress who are definitely op-
 posed to Right reaction who favor the mono-
 polies and the neo-colonialists? Such an al-
 liance with the Congress organization and
 leadership, as it is, would be quite out of
 place, as was decided by the Vijayawada Con-
 gress of our Party. There are hardly any crys-
 tallized Left forces in the leadership of the
 Congress, whether at top or lower levels. The
 Rightists in it have become powerful. But
 what remains of the centrist or "left" in its
 leadership is in confusion. This was very
 vividly seen when Krishna Menon, ex-Defense
 Minister and close friend of Nehru, was
 thrown out of his constituency by the Right-
 ist pro-American group of S. K. Patil and
 others and had to resign from the Congress.
 The Left Democratic Opposition Parties have
 declared  their  support  for  Mr.  Krishna
 Menon. They have also made an electoral
 front with that section of the Congress which
 split away from the Rightist group in West
 Bengal and formed the Bangla Congress.
 A general alliance with the Congress Party
 by the Left Democratic Opposition with the
 idea of saving it from the Rightist reaction
 would simply repel the masses and strength-
 en the hand of the reactionaries whom we
 wish to fight. The left Democratic Opposition
 forces must try to fight and defeat the Con-
 gress Party and in that process help the pro-
 gressive elements therein to expel the reac-
 tionaries or form a new organization.
 How is it that the Congress Party, which
 headed the anti-imperialist liberation move-
 ment and which ruled the country, under the
 leadership of the late Jawaharlal Nehru, faces
 the prospect of being defeated in three states
 by the forces of reaction, while elsewhere it
 will be severely weakened, though it may
 succeed in retaining its majority with depre-
 ciated strength in the Parliament and else-
 where? How is it that in two states the Left
 Democratic Alliance also may displace it from
 power?
 It has happened because the Congress, as
 the party of the national bourgeoisie, after
 attaining state power, pursued the path of
 capitalist development, betrayed its promises
 to the people, failed to develop the economy
 even as a fully developed capitalist economy
 and has been succumbing gradually to the in-
 fluence of U.S. imperialism, while retaining
 its economic links with the socialist camp
 and its verbal loyalty to phrases of socialism
 and democracy. The present crisis in the Con-
 gress Party and in the country is the inevit-
 able accompaniment of the growth of mono-
 poly capitalism. That is why even after at-
 taining independence and taking power as the
 leading party of the anti-imperialist struggle,
 the Congress never secured a majority of the
 popular vote in the three countrywide general
 elections. Nor will it do so in this election.
 Hence, the Election Manifesto of our Party
 describes the situation in the following words:
 "All objective conditions for the overthrow
 of the hated Congress.rule and for carrying
 forward the national democratic revolution
 to completion are now maturing as never
 before."
 But the greatest lag in the situation is the
 absence of a unified organized revolutionary
 leadership having a hold on the masses and
 capable of leading, boldly and yet soberly, the
 unprecedented mass movements, that  are
 sweeping over the country. Our Manifesto
 says:
 "The pre-election year of 1966 has wit-
 nessed the largest number of political strikes
 and bandhs. In defense of their wages, their
 :' ,;its and their living standards, the working
 people all over the country in their tens of
 millions have pone into massive political and
 economic actions. Middle class employees
 have been drawn into mass actions in ever
 greater numbers and in varied forms. One
 remarkable feature of the present-day mass
 upheaval is the country's student upsurge be-
 fore which the barriers of so-called discipline
 have collapsed. The heroic student commu-
 nity has faced the fury of the Congress and
 the bullets of its police during the just strug-
 gle for much-needed but long-denied acade-
 mic amenities so that the boys and girls can
 get proper education, secure gainful employ-
 ment and grow up as worthy citizens of our
 republic.
 "In rural India, the vast peasant masses,
 land-starved and stricken, are in a restless
 mood and in many places they too have moved
 "People's rightful protests and movements
 are, however, met with wanton police firings
 and orgies of violence. Even the army is call-

 the Manifesto says:
 "The record of Congress regime since the
 last general election five years ago has been
 one of dismal failures almost in eucry sphere
 of our national life. Our agriculture, espe-
 cially food production, is stagnant, notwith-
 standing heavy financial outlays. Famine and
 near-famine conditions, largely the creation
 of man, stalk the land. Even at this moment,
 starvation deaths are taking place in Bihar
 and in UP and in other parts of the country
 and the government refuses even to declare
 them as famine areas. It is the greatest in-
 dictment that after 19 years of uninterrupted
 power, the Congress has failed to ensure even
 the minimum food requirements for the mas-
 ses, who are either starving or live on the
 borderline of starvation.
 "Under Congress rule the plunder of India's
 wealth by imperialist exploiters continues.
 Foreign private investments in our economy,
 which are a source of this loot, today amount
 to nearly Rs. 900 crores and every year tens
 of crores of rupees are siphoned off from this
 country by British and American monopolies.
 leadership of the Congress Party and the gov-
 ernment has lost its prestige and it has no
 moral stature at all. The awe and terror in
 which the state machine seeks to hold the
 people is gradually ceasing to frighten them.
 All these years the Congress rulers have been
 pampering the reactionary monopolies. They
 are now making pirodigious concessions to
 American Imperialists. This line of appease-
 ment and surrender has been lately climaxed
 by the blackest national betrayal since inde-

 "American imperialists are today out to
 exploit the hunger of our people in order to
 cripple and sabotage our economy in crucial
 sectors. They are out to destroy our indepen-
 dence and humiliate our country.
 "In soite of India's friendly relations and
 economic cooperation with the Soviet Union
 and other socialist countries, which are un-
 doubtedly very beneficial to our nation, the

 countries; its external debts, mostly to the
 USA, stand around Rs. 5.000 crores, Involv-
 ing annual repayment liabilities in principal
 and interest of over Rs. 100 crores .. .
 "The Congress regime is unable to keep
 the industry running. Transport is in chaos
 and fatal accidents on the railways go on in-
 creasing.
 "The rate of growth in our national income
 has fallen and the rate of increase in per capi-
 ta income has declined still further. The rupee
 has drastically lost value due to runaway,
 sky-rocketting prices. People are groaning
 tinder crushing tax burdens. Rising prices, as
 well as taxes on the common man, are of
 course the inevitable result of Congress gov-
 ernment policies to fatten the millionaires
 and feed the greedy bureaucratic state ma-
 chine. Plunder of the toiling people goes side
 by side with colossal but unchecked adminis-
 trative waste.
 "The Congress regime is now a hotbed of
 corruption. The source of this rampant cor-
 ruption and graft is the unholy link-up be-
 tween the Congress Ministers and Congress
 leaders with the Birlas and other big business
 families as well as the corrupt top bureau-
 cracy that thrives on bribery .. .
 "The ruling Congress party is ridden with
 factions and power groups, each jockeying
 for position for self-aggrandizement. Their
 Indo-Pakistan conflict, the U.S. imperialists
 have been holding up supplies of machinery,
 raw materials and food, which they had pro-
 mised so far. Instead of utilizing the crisis to
 carry out independent and self-reliant deve-
 lopment and swift agrarian reforms, whose
 failures have been the cause of the food and
 raw material crisis, the Government of the
 Congress Party began to further vacillate in
 its postures of non-alignment. It has failed
 to condemn the American aggression in Viet-
 nam and lend firm support to the Vietnamese
 people. It has failed to give recognition to the
 German Democratic Republic for fear of
 West German and U.S, displeasure,
 Even then, during the food and industrial
 crisis, it appealed to the Soviet Union for
 aid, which was promptly given. The dispatch
 of 200,000 tons of grain as a free gift to the
 people of the drought-ridden areas came as
 a surprise and shock to the vilifiers of the
 Soviet Union, and within hours the Americans
 rushed to announce their "aid" which they
 had been so far holding back.
 But being tied to the apron strings of mon-
 opoly capital, the Congress regime is unable
 to utilize all the goodwill that India draws
 from people all over the world to forge a de-
 mocratic path of development, free from im-
 perialist, monopolist and landlord influences.
 Hence the need to defeat the Congress Party
 in the coming elections.
