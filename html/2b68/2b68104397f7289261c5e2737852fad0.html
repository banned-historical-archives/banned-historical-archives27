 ON QUESTIONS OF IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL WORK
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 pp 2-10
 [Article by Hu Yaobang [5170 5069 6721]]
 [Text]   Editor's note:  On 24 April 1982, Comrade Hu
 Yaobang met Comrade Deng Liqun and some other com-
 rades and made an important speech on the party's
 ideological and political work.  In this speech,
 apart from citing the party's historical experience
 to demonstrate the importance of ideological and
 political work, Comrade Hu Yaobang also proceeded
 from current realities and gave a detailed exposi-
 tion of the nature, aims and tasks of the party's
 ideological and political work, the special
 features of this work and the basic methods suited
 to it, and raised questions of building an ideo-
 logical and political work force and issues cur-
 rently meriting attention on the ideological front..
 This speech by Comrade Hu Yaobang is of great impor-
 tance for the whole party in summing up experiences
 in ideological and political work, overcoming laxity
 and weakness in leadership over ideological and polit-
 ical work and creating a new situation in ideological
 and political work.
 Our party's achievements in leading and uniting the masses to wage great
 struggles and constantly win victory are inseparable from the fact that the
 party has consistently attached importance to ideological and political
 work.  After its founding, the party used various types of newspapers and
 publications, books and other forms to extensively publicize Marxism-
 Leninism and the victory of the October Revolution in Russia.   This played
 an effective role in enlightening China's worker-peasant masses and intel-
 lectuals.                 We first set up a political work system in the Red Army during
 theJinggangshan period.   The cardinal link in political work was to
 educate the cadres and fighters in revolutionary ideology and arouse their
 revolutionary consciousness.   During the entire period of the 10-year land
 revolution, despite very poor material and other conditions, we defeated
 frequent encirclements by the enemy, expanded the Red Army and the bases,

 completed the unprecedented 25,000-li Long March, and in the end carried
 on.   After that we experienced the 8-year war of resistance to Japan and the
 liberation war, which lasted more than 3 years, and gained victory through-
 out the land.  What did we depend on?  Fundamentally speaking, our victory
 was gained because our party's line, principles and policies were correct,
 and our party closely integrated the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism
 with the concrete reality of the Chinese revolution; and because our party
 represented the interests of the people of the whole country, and our party
 members and fighters fought hard and made bloody sacrifices to liberate the
 people of the whole country, and were thus able to mobilize and lead the
 masses to wage victorious struggles.  An important method adopted by the
 whole party throughout this period was to enhance the masses' revolutionary
 consciousness by means of ideological and political work.  The entire his-
 torical experience of our party shows that the development and victory of
 our cause were built on the foundation of correct leadership and conscious
 masses; and after the condition of correct leadership had been gained, the
 masses' consciousness was the decisive factor.  We therefore say that skill
 in ideological and political work is an important characteristic distinguish-
 ing our party from other political parties and is an extremely important con-
 dition for winning victory in revolution and construction.
 At present, our party's ideological and political work is in many respects
 and links not done as well as in the past.  It could be said that many of
 the party's fine traditions have been discarded.  Failure to attach impor-
 tance to ideological and political work and an inability to do this work
 are universal phenomena.   Of course there are many reasons for this, and
 one of them is that we have not summed up well, systematically and pro-
 foundly, the experiences in ideological and political work in light of the
 practice of revolution and construction since the founding of the state.
 A major task that ought to be carried out by the party organizations of
 every place, department and unit is to investigate seriously and study, sum
 up the positive and negative historical experiences in ideological and
 political work, and form a complete set of correct viewpoints and methods.
 This task should in particular be grasped well by the party's propaganda
 departments.
 In a talk in July 1981, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly pointed out that
 there was laxity and weakness in party leadership over ideological and
 political work.   This criticism hit the nail right on the head and raised
 a key question on our ideological front.  The central authorities there-
 fore convened the forum on problems on the, ideological front and after-
 wards issued documents; these were conveyed and discussed in all departments
 and localities.   At that time, apart from tackling problems of bourgeois
 liberalization in a few aspects, including literature and art creation, the
 other fields were basically untouched. 'It is evident that it is by no means
 easy to solve the problems in connection with reality in all aspects in
 accordance with the Central Committee's demand.   That is to say, people did
 not think that the central authorities',guiding principles applied in their
 case.   Is this not called taking one's seat according to the ticket number?
 Certain comrades can often never find room for the central instructions in
 their units or implement them in their actions.   Right at the start of 1982,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 the Central Committee emphasized promoting the building of socialist
 spiritual civilization, hitting at serious economic crimes, and carrying
 out structural reforms.  As soon as:these three issues were tackled, the
 laxity and weakness in ideological and political work was further changed.
 Ideological and political work cannot be tackled in a general way; instead
 we should relentlessly grasp one or two main issues at a time.  In this
 respect, our party's ideological and political work has still not been
 properly implemented in many ways, and the problems of laxity and weakness
 still exist among the leaders of many departments and places.
 The work of many departments and places has improved in recent years, but
 ideological and political work has still not been well grasped.  This is a
 basic matter.   This does not mean that the comrades doing ideological and
 political work are no good; the great majority of them are good comrades.'
 Nor does it mean that our comrades have no standards; many of them do.   It
 seems that a main problem on the ideological front is that there is not
 enough systematic summation of experiences and not enough study of the
 current ideological state and characteristics of the cadres and masses,
 while the methods used are not very apt.   Hence the whole party must syste-
 matically and deeply ponder this question.   On this occasion I am just
 raising questions and giving a few personal views; I hope everyone will
 study them.
 What Is Our Party's Ideological and Political Work
 In order to sum up experience, we must first have a clear idea of what
 ideological and political work is.   There would seem to be no problem here.
 The targets of ideological and political work are people and their thinking,
 viewpoints and standpoint.   Our party's ideological and political work is
 aimed at solving problems in people's thinking, viewpoint and political
 standpoint, and mobilizing the cadres and masses to attain the current and
 the long-term goals of the revolution.   Is there anything unclear about
 this?  But actually there is.    In fact, the thinking of many comrades is
 still muddled and even stupid.   It is therefore extremely important to truly
 clarify this issue.
 We are faced with the problem of method in our study of things.  The method
 told us by Marx is to start with the most universal and basic things in
 order to reveal their essence.   In studying capitalist society, Marx pre-
 cisely started with the most simple, universal and basic relationship, that
 is, the exchange of commodities.  He wrote "Das Kapital," which became a
 classic in political economy.   The historical. materialism of Marxist
 philosophy began with people's food, clothing and housing needs, which
 meant that people have to engage in production, and reached the conclusion
 that productive force determines production relations and the economic base
 determines the superstructure.   It will be recalled that when Comrade Mao
 Zedong criticized dogmatism and subjectivism at the central revolutionary
 base, he said that people have to eat, roads are for people to walk on,
 after walking people need to sleep, and bullets can kill people.  Why did
 Comrade Mao Zedong say these things?  Because the dogmatists at that time
 issued an order requiring the army to march 120 li in 1 night and then wipe

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 out the enemy.   Was this possible?  And so Comrade Mao Zedong used the most
 universal and basic reasoning to refute them; this was using materialism
 to oppose subjectivism.  The theory of scientific socialism also begins
 with class analysis and clarifies the issues of how there were no classes
 at the start of human history, how classes formed, developed and changed,
 and how to eliminate classes and attain the communist society of the.pro-
 letariat, and so on.
 Therefore, when studying how to strengthen ideological and political work,
 we must grasp the fundamental and essential parts of this work by utilizing
 Marxist methods and analyzing phenomena and at the same time, we should
 point out and clarify many confused ideas.
 For example, is it right to say that ideological and political work is to
 organize people to study the central leadership's documents?  This answer
 of course includes some truth, but it does not touch the essence of ideo-
 logical and political work.
 For another example, some people say that ideological and political work is
 to commend good people and good things, advanced figures and deeds and to
 sum up and publicize advanced experiences.   This is also somewhat true, but
 it does not touch the essence of ideological and political work either.
 For another example, it is said that ideological and political work is to
 carry out criticism and self-criticism.   Of course, criticism and self-
 criticism constitute an important method in ideological and political work,
 but this definition again does not reveal the essence of this work.
 The above propositions do point out some important facts and forms of
 ideological and political work from different angles, but they fail to
 explain the most essential aspect of ideological and political work.   There-
 fore, it is necessary for us to discuss and study ideological and political
 work so as to enable people to truly realize the essence of ideological and
 political work, that is, the purpose and task of this work and the rela-
 tionship of this work with other work, and first of all, with economic work.
 Through study and discussion, we can correct various confused ideas about
 this question.
 What  Is the Purpose and Task of Ideological and Political Work
 In a word, the purpose and task of ideological and political work is to
 enhance people's capacity for understanding and remolding the world.   To
 say this in more detail, it is to educate party members and cadres, educate
 the broad masses, the working class as a whole and the people as a whole
 in revolutionary ideology and spirit, that is, in communist ideology, in
 Marxist basic theory and Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal
 truth of Marxism and the concrete practice of the revolution and construc-
 tion in China so as to enlighten and enhance people's revolutionary con-
 sciousness, to enable people to establish correct standpoints and view-
 points and master correct thinking methods and work methods and to improve
 people's capacity for understanding and reforming the world through
 repeated practice.

 In the essay "On Practice," Comrade Mao Zedong points out:  "The struggle
 of the proletariat and the revolutionary people to change the world com-
 prises the fulfillment of the following tasks,:  to change the objective
 world and at the same time, their own subjective world--to change their
 cognitive ability and change the relations between the subjective and the
 objective world."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 1, pp 272-273)  We
 communists, as the vanguards of the proletariat, should not only play an
 exemplary role in fulfilling the. tasks of changing both the objective and
 their own subjective world,, but should also, through ideological and polit-
 ical work, influence and attract more and more people to fulfill these
 tasks.  We should make more and more people understand:  "Discover the
 truth through practice, and again through practice verify and develop.the
 truth.  Start from perceptual knowledge and actively develop it into
 rational knowledge; then start from rational knowledge and actively guide
 revolutionary practice to change both the subjective and the objective
 world."   (ibid., p 273)  We must get a good grasp of this epistemology of
 dialectical materialism so as to ensure our party's ideological and polit-
 ical work is closely related around the fundamental purpose and task of
 understanding and remolding the world.
 It is of course not easy_ to enhance the capacity for understanding the
 objective world, including the capacity for observation, analysis and dis-
 tinguishing.  This is-because the objective world is so complex that nobody
 can acquire a clear knowledge of it in a short while.  Moreover, since
 social practice is developing continuously, as individuals, no person can
 have complete knowledge.  On this issue, we have committed many errors for
 a fairly long time.   For example, some people and some things were said to
 be constantly and absolutely correct.  Of course, this was at variance with
 the facts.  "The movement of change in the world of objective reality is
 never ending and so is man's cognition of truth through practice."   (ibid.,
 p 272)  All truths are relative in the long course of human cognition with
 absolute truth being included in relative truth.  Absolute truth is a sum
 total of innumerable relative truths.  Man's cognition can merely approach
 absolute truth through relative truths while the limits and degrees of the
 approach have to be conditioned by historical circumstances.  Therefore, it
 is impossible that some people are omniscient and omnipotent and it is not
 possible that some people are always correct.
 Our ideological and political work is to publicize the party's line, prin-
 ciples and policies for revolution and construction and struggle objectives,
 strategies and methods among the vast number of party members, cadres and
 the masses, and to educate them in these things so as to enlighten and
 enhance their revolutionary consciousness and enable them to consciously
 and willingly follow the party',s political leadership.   In this way, it can
 effect ideological-and political mobilization which arouses great strength
 so as to ensure the fulfillment of the tasks of revolution and construction.
 .Comrade Mao Zedong'underlined the great importance of ideological and polit-
 ical work in his essay "On Protracted War."  Apart from a special section on
 "Political Mobilization for the War of Resistance," he also pointed out in
 the section entitled "The Army and the People Are the Foundation of Victory":
 "The reform of our military system requires its modernization and improved

 technical equipment, without which we cannot drive the enemy back across
 the Yalu Jiang.   In our employment of troops we need progressive, flexible
 strategies and tactics, without which we likewise cannot win victory.
 Nevertheless, soldiers are the foundation of an army; unless they are
 imbued with a progressive political spirit, and unless such a spirit is
 fostered through progressive political work, it will be impossible to
 achieve genuine unity between officers and men, impossible to arouse to the
 full their enthusiasm for the war of resistance and impossible to provide a
 sound basis for the most effective use of all our technical equipment and
 tactics."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 2, p 478)  Though here Mao
 Zedong referred to war, the principle expounded by him still holds true in
 the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization.
 In order to build socialism, we should not only build a high level of
 material civilization, continuously develop and improve the material and
 technical foundation for the socialist system, but should also build a high
 level of spiritual civilization with communist ideology as its core, which
 is also an essential requirement of the socialist system.   Our construction
 will not be able to go on smoothly without improving the revolutionary con-
 sciousness of the vast number of workers, peasants, intellectuals and other
 masses, without enlightening their firm belief in communism, without
 encouraging them to show initiative, creativity and enthusiasm in building
 socialism, without arousing their senses of honor, pride and responsibility
 toward their work, and particularly without requiring the vast number of
 our party members, league members and cadres to play an exemplary role in
 these areas.   It will even be very difficult for us to achieve our goals if
 we fail to do a good job in the above areas, because there are various ideas
 in people's minds; both communist and noncommunist ideology exist simul-
 taneously.   There are capitalist ideology, feudal ideology as well as the
 backward ideology of the petty bourgeoisie.  All kinds of nonproletarian
 ideology will impede our correct implementing of the party's line, prin-
 ciples and policies and hinder us from carrying out unswerving struggle
 which is necessary for the realization of the tasks set forth by our party.
 It will also prevent us from remolding both the objective world and our own
 subjective world.   Without eliminating nonproletarian ideology, our revolu-
 tion will not succeed and our construction will not be successful.   The
 purpose of ideological and political work is to sweep away these things.
 This is also a sanitation and hygiene movement and a movement of general
 cleaning.  All of us should set to work and do cleaning every day and only
 by sweeping in a proper way can we achieve results.
 Thus, our party's ideological and political work should first function in
 strengthening, encouraging and arousing people's belief, enthusiasm, will-
 power and morale.   That is what we often say--firm and scientific faith,
 revolutionary enthusiasm, staunch willpower and high morale.   If ideological
 and political work remain only at the stage of understanding the world and
 fail to encourage people to change the world in practice, then it will only
 be empty talk.   Enhancing people's revolutionary consciousness means that we
 should, strengthen and enhance the revolutionary faith, enthusiasm, fighting
 will and resolution of a vast number of party members, cadres and masses.
 It should be noticed that in the course of revolution and construction,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 various erroneous ideas and actions will continually arise among the people,
 such as actions of excess, cowardliness and retrogression.  Our comrades who
 are engaged in ideological and political work should be good at promptly
 perceiving new situations and studying new problems so as to correctly and
 effectively educate and help people to promptly correct their erroneous
 understanding, standpoint and method in the course of understanding and
 changing the world.  They should even do this work in advance and take
 preventive measures so as to solve problems in their embryonic stage or
 enable people to have sufficient mental preparation before problems appear.
 Thus, through repeated practice, deepening our cognition and enhancing our
 capacity for changing the world are the fundamental purposes and tasks of
 ideological and political work of our party which take the changing of the
 world as its own mission.  All of our comrades engaging in ideological and
 political work must clearly realize this point and should never lump together
 some specific parts and methods of ideological and political work with our
 fundamental purposes and tasks.  The specific parts and concrete methods
 and means of ideological and political work may be diverse and changeable
 with different historical conditions, circumstances and specific objects.
 If we only pay attention to means and methods or only remember some indi-
 vidual and concrete items butforget the fundamental purpose and task, our
 ideological and political work will not reap good results and the comrades
 who are engaging in this work cannot improve themselves either.
 What Are the Features of Ideological and Political Work
 Any work or any department has,its own features.  To understand things, we
 must begin with their features.  Anyone who has a clear understanding of the
 features of his own department and its relationship to other things can do
 his work with good results.  The features of ideological and political work
 are derived from the object of its given tasks.  As mentioned above, the
 object of ideological and political work is men.  We must straighten out
 the thinking, viewpoint and standpoint of men.  This is different from
 economic work.  It is also not completely like the work of the organiza-
 tional department.
 The scope of ideological and political work is very broad.   There are people
 in every department or unit.  People think.  Therefore, every department or
 unit must do ideological and political work.  All work is done by people.
 In the process of physical or mental work, people would think this way or
 that.  Therefore, in doing anything, we must do ideological and political
 work.  Comrade Mao Zedong said that ideological and political work is a
 guarantee for economic work.  In a broad sense, ideological and political
 work should be the guarantee for all work.  Given a good performance in
 ideological problems, half the battle is won.  No department or unit can
 ever forget ideological and political work in doing any work.
 Ideological and political work calls for, first of all, the solution of the
 problem of ideological awareness and the problem of a political stand.   Lenin
 said many times that Marxism cannot automatically spring up in workers' minds
 but must be instilled into them.   Later, Comrade Mao Zedong also said on many
 occasions that we must enlighten and educate people.  We must advocate such

 virtues as love for the motherland, love for the people, love for labor,
 love for science and love for socialism and carry out education in
 patriotism, internationalism, collectivism, communism and education in
 dialectical materialism and the world outlook represented by historical
 materialism. We must resist capitalist, feudalist and other decadent ideas.
 We must imbue people with revolutionary ideals, moral principles and a
 sense of discipline.   We must raise people's consciousness as the masters.
 These are undoubtedly the most constant and most general contents of
 ideological and political work.
 In "On Protracted War," Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the three major
 principles of political work in the army--unity between officers and men,
 unity between the army and the people and the disintegration of the enemy
 troops.   What is meant here is actually the correct handling of the rela-
 tionship between men.   In building socialist material civilization and
 spiritual civilization, we must also pay good attention to the proper
 handling of relationships of this kind, such as the relationship between
 workers and peasants, the relationship between the worker-peasant masses
 and intellectuals, the relationship between cadres and the masses, the
 relationship among people of all nationalities of the country, the relation-
 ship between the Chinese people and the people of various countries, the
 relationship between the Chinese proletariat and the bourgeoisie in foreign
 countries, and so forth.  We must also correctly handle the relationship
 between various kinds of people in the political, economic, ideological and
 cultural fields and in social life.  Of course, also involved here are some
 fundamental policies of our party and state.   It is not just the business
 of the ideological and political work department.   But our ideological and
 political work must be conducive to unity among people of all nationalities
 of the country and people in all circles and to unity between the Chinese
 people and the people of various countries in the world.   Given firm unity
 at home and international unity, we can, in the process of socialist con-
 struction, overcome various difficulties, effectively resist domestic and
 external enemies and achieve our goals in a relatively short period of time
 and at a relatively small cost.
 Unlike economic, technical and other material things, changes in people's
 thinking are governed by different laws,.   Therefore, unlike the economic
 department, we, in doing ideological and political work, cannot formulate
 annual plans or 5-year plans and set clear-cut goals.  A few years ago, I
 told the comrades of the propaganda department that the work of the propa-
 ganda department could not be just a matter of calling one conference a
 year.  The planning department can call just one.conference a year and take
 care of such matters as what are the goals for the year, how much money is
 to be spent, how large are the supplies of things required and how to bring
 about a balance.   The organization department generally can also meet once
 a year.   If the propaganda department meets just once a year, setting forth
 several tasks in a sweeping manner, many problems cannot be properly solved.
 The propaganda department must call many meetings a year--large, medium-
 sized and small meetings.  Mainly small meetings must be called.  A meeting
 should be held with a particular  problem in mind.   The comrades concerned
 must be brought together for a joint discussion.   Concerning how to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 understand and approach things, how to carry out publicity and education
 and how to adhere to principle and foster a sense of propriety, we must
 seek actual results; and in a word, where there are existing problems and
 especially where an ideological trend.of a general nature is discovered,
 we must immediately call a meeting, make an analysis and work out a few
 rules for implementation.  The results of certain kinds of work must be
 summed up promptly.  For example, the "civilization and courtesy month,"
 "five stresses and four beauties" and other campaigns launched throughout
 the country must be summed up in time.  We must study what effects have
 been produced, determine if there is any typical example, if there is any
 problem and what are the future plans.  In my opinion, the propaganda
 departments at all levels must, in light of the progress of work and
 changes in people's thinking, tackle a number of problems in a given year
 and make studies to find five solutions.
 The fundamental principle of ideological and political work means conducting
 education and persuasion of people and does not mean adopting coercive and
 forceful methods or issuing administrative orders.  Concerning the problems
 of ideology and understanding among the people,. we must adopt  the prin-
 ciple of clearing the way and providing guidance and opposing the principle
 of blocking it.   The principle of clearing the way and providing guidance
 is the correct principle for ideological and political work.  We must guide
 while clearing the way and clear the way while guiding, and both clear the
 way and guide.   Clearing the way means providing wide opportunities for air-
 ing views and pooling the wisdom of the masses.   Guiding means teaching
 with skill and patience and conducting education by persuasion.   We must
 seek truth from facts, convince people with reason, and stress practical
 results.  We must go deep among the people and patiently conduct arduous
 and meticulous work in light of the ideological state of the masses.  If
 we rely on coercion and force regarding people's ideological problems, and
 if we rely on big and empty talk, boasting and lies over matters for which
 it is necessary to mobilize the masses, we are acting in a way totally
 opposite to all of our party's principles, including the correct principle
 of ideological education.
 Since ideological and political work means educating and persuading people
 and raising their revolutionary consciousness and their ability to under-
 stand things, apart from relying on the broad masses of party members and
 people to do it, we must rely on cadres to tackle the large amount of work.
 Therefore, the propaganda and political work departments' organizing and
 guiding such work must first properly do the work concerning cadres,
 educating and persuading them and raising their revolutionary consciousness
 and their ability to understand things.   The first four volumes of "Selected
 Works of Mao Zedong" mentioned the theory of the.Chinese revolution and
 pointed out the line, strategies and general and specific policies for work
 at all stages.  As far as the object of education is concerned, we must
 first carry out ideological and political work among cadres, educating and
 convincing them, so that they understand the principle of revolution.  Then
 through the cadres, we must educate, unite and guide the masses, thus
 achieving victory in revolution.

 Of the articles in which Comrade Mao Zedong systematically defined ideologi-
 cal and political work, the earliest was the Gutian congress resolution
 written in 1929.  At that time, subjectivism prevailed and nonproletarian
 ideas were rife.  This resolution enabled the worker-peasant Red Army to be
 built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and to basically eliminate the
 influences of the old-type army.  This was also first aimed at cadres.
 When it came to the problem of mistreating and beating and taunting
 soldiers, who was mentioned?  It was the cadres who were mentioned.   Such
 articles as "The Situation and Tasks of the Anti-Japanese War After the
 Fall of Shanghai and Taiyuan" and "On Protracted War" also first mentioned
 the need to convince cadres.  Given the correct thinking of cadres and a
 raised level on their part, the job of carrying out ideological education
 among workers, peasants and fighters is rendered relatively easy.
 The time our party did ideological and political work well was the period of
 the Red Army, the period of Yanan or the period shortly after the founding
 of the PRC.   Later, for a period of time, under the influence of "leftist"
 mistakes, ideological and political work was gradually turned into a means
 used by leaders in coping with ordinary workers., peasants, fighters and
 intellectuals.   The reputation of ideological and political work became
 stained, with very bad consequences.  To certain cadres, it seemed that
 only the common people had incorrect ideas and that they themselves were
 all right.   To them, it seemed that raising revolutionary consciousness and
 the ability to understand things involved only the common people and that
 this had nothing to do with themselves.   Certain leadership cadres also
 think that they themselves were many times wiser than ordinary ones and
 that there was basically no need for them to undergo transformation.   Com-
 rade Mao Zedong criticized this erroneous trend many times.   Facts proved
 to be the opposite of what they had thought.  Many kinds of work were not
 done well and even chaos and losses resulted.   This was first blamed on the
 problem of ideological awareness and political stand involving cadres and
 party members, or on the problem of style.  With the thinking of cadres
 raised and wrong things overcome, the job was made easy.
 Therefore, in doing ideological and political work, we must first solve the
 ideological problems among cadres.  To change the state of a lack of
 organization and discipline in the production of coal and charcoal, the
 leaders of the Ministry of Coal Industry first worked on cadres at all
 levels.   The first rule was for cadres to work side by side with the rank
 and file.   The second was to transfer those cadres originally working on
 the surface of the ground to work below the surface.   The third rule was to
 criticize the lethargic state of cadres.  Did not Comrade Mao Zedong often
 mention the need to "move the god"?  The god means the common people.   To
 "move the god" means doing ideological and political work, including the
 need for cadres to set personal examples by taking part in collective pro-
 duction and labor and mingling with the masses as one.
 After the founding of the PRC, we paid relatively serious attention in the
 first few years to the training of cadres on a rotating basis, their educa-
 tion and the elevation of their cultural, scientific and theoretical'levels.
 The pity was that we did not stick it out.  We missed many favorable
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 opportunities.  This was a great mistake.  Now, the party Central Committee
 is determined to carry out education and training for cadres, give them
 training on a rotating basis and improve their caliber.  It has called on
 all our cadres to think more of the affairs of the state and of the people
 and not to place their personal affairs first.  Those people who become
 obsessed with subjectivism all day can get nowhere.  We must encourage
 cadres to devote the great. part of their time after work to reading.  They
 must pick up some books on theory, on science and on particular trades and
 raise their cultural and ideological levels.
 Only by understanding and grasping the features of ideological and political
 work can we work out correct methods.  Without understanding China's
 features, our party could not have guided the Chinese revolution to victory
 and cannot guide socialist modernization to victory.  Without understanding
 the features of ideological and political work, we cannot possibly improve
 and strengthen ideological and political work and bring about the vigorous
 development of this kind of work to achieve marked new progress.
 Educators Must First Be Educated
 Since ideological and political work consists chiefly of education this is
 in fact a question of how to strengthen the ranks of ideological and polit-
 ical workers.  It is necessary for educators to have not only a correct
 ideological viewpoint and political stand but also correct ways and methods.
 There are two forms of education:  one is education by argument and reason-
 ing and another is education in terms of images (chiefly through literature
 and art).  It is necessary for educators to be familiar with these two
 forms of education and to be good at applying them in their work.
 How is our education by argument and reasoning at present?  The problem in
 this respect lies chiefly in the lack of conviction.  What is referred to
 as lack of conviction is that we do not sufficiently explain the truth,
 that it does not produce vigorous agitation and that it fails to move the
 people.   There are only two forms of education by argument and reasoning:
 one is orally, such as speeches, reports, transmission of documents, talks,
 arguments, criticism and self-criticism; another is by writing, such as
 resolutions, instructions, theoretical works, popular literature, commen-
 taries and news reports.   There are two major common failings in many of our
 articles and speeches:  The first is that we only apply the deductive method
 and that we do not or seldom apply the method of analysis.  We often infer
 from one concept what and how we should do without so much as presenting the
 the facts and reasoning things out or making concrete analyses according to
 facts or reasoning things out while recounting.  Lenin and Comrade Mao
 Zedong were different.  When we read their major works, we become aware of
 an outstanding feature, that is, they make concrete analyses of concrete
 problems and are very convincing.  Take Comrade Mao Zedong's article,."On
 Protracted War," for example.  First it analyzes and compares the actual
 conditions of both China and Japan and their strong and weak points and
 says that the theory of national subjugation is wrong and that the theory
 of quick victory is likewise wrong.  Then it amply presents the facts and
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 reasons.things out through detailed analysis, argument and reasoning.  The
 second common failing is that we load our articles or speeches with too
 many concepts, with one concept linked with another and big concepts linked
 with small ones.  Why is it that many people are unwilling to listen to a
 report or a speech or read a thesis or an editorial?  We should find the
 cause not only from the audience or readers but also from ourselves, which
 is chiefly because we do not penetratingly analyze and dissect problems and
 clearly reason things out.
 Our education in terms of images is chiefly reflected in the problems that
 exist in literature and art.   In addition to bad political tendencies,
 unhealthy ideology and feelings and a bad social effect in some works, there
 are also some works which lack appeal and have little social effect.  The
 CPC Central Committee pointed out before the "Cultural Revolution" that
 there was a defect of formalism and generalization in our literary and art
 creation.  This hit home as far as the literary and art features are con-
 cerned.  Our education in terms of images lacks appeal so that people do not
 want to read them.  It fails to strike a sympathetic chord in their ideas
 and feelings and in the depth of their souls after they read it and it fails
 to produce repercussions and exert a perceptible influence.
 Why is it that our education by argument and reasoning carries little con-
 viction and that our education in terms of images lacks appeal?  This is
 because our educators fail to master the laws governing these two kinds of
 education.   Therefore, it is necessary for all trades and services, first
 of all the propaganda, cultural and educational departments that have a
 direct relationship with ideological and political work, to receive some
 training in basic methods.  All trades and services, whether in party work
 or in ideological and political work, should have their own basic
 knowledge and professional skills.  We should not consider that only those
 who engage in economic and technical work face a problem of specialization.
 It will be impossible for our cadres in various trades and services, and
 the leading cadres in particular, to do their work well if they do not have
 some basic training in professional knowledge, do not have professional
 skills and do not become experts.
 Educators must first be educated.  As far as ideological viewpoint and
 political stand are concerned, there are three main requirements:
 1.   Our revolutionary consciousness, knowledge in various aspects and our
 abilities in recognizing some aspects of objective things should always be
 higher, greater and stronger than other people's and we should be a little
 ahead of them.   If you want to persuade other people to have confidence in
 socialism, you should first have conviction.   If you vacillate and have no
 conviction, how can you enhance other people's conviction?
 2.   It is necessary to understand the specific law governing ideological
 and political work, be familiar with the specific features of our work and,
 proceeding from practice, correctly apply the objective law in our work.
 This is not merely a professional question. for it is first of all a ques-
 tion of ideological and political standards.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 3.  We should set an example not only by giving verbal directions but also
 by teaching others by our own examples and by integrating both of them.
 If you do not match your deeds with your words, no matter how well you talk,
 people will not listen to you; if you talk about wholehearted service to the
 people but you do not serve the people even half-heartedly, this will exert
 a very bad influence.  Why is it that, at present, some people do not have
 strength and good effect in doing ideological and political work?  An impor-
 tant reason is that they do not set an example.   If a person can set an
 example, his speech can carry weight.  This is a most important condition
 in doing a good job of ideological and political work.  In mobilizing the
 masses to do something, all party members, particularly party cadres hold-
 ing leading positions, should first be able to do it.
 Some Problems We Should Pay Attention to on the Current Ideological Front
 The CPC Central Committee has repeatedly pointed out that it is still neces-
 sary to continuously eliminate "leftist" things on the political, economic
 and ideological fronts.  At the same time it is necessary to pay serious
 attention to and deal seriously with bourgeois liberalization and pay atten-
 tion to overcoming feudal things.  We should never lower our guard.   The
 idea that "leftist" things have been completely eliminated as a result of
 bringing order out of chaos is not correct.  Actually, we should still
 exert great efforts to fight against them in the future.   Some people who
 were extremely "leftist" during the "Cultural Revolution" are now extremely
 rightist.  They jump from one extreme to another. Of course, this kind of
 person is very few in number.  We should make a practical analysis that con-
 forms with principles in order to determine which are "leftist" and which
 are rightist things on the political, economic and ideological fronts and in
 various different tasks and. specific problems.  We should. oppose either
 "leftist" or "rightist" things, as appropriate.  We should not treat
 different things as the same.
 The open-door policy has brought us,many beneficial things.  But it has
 also brought us many germs.  Therefore, we should adopt dual tactics.   On
 the one hand, we should resolutely implement the open-door policy, because
 this policy is correct.   On the other hand, we should resolutely resist
 decadent capitalist things, including the bourgeois ideology and way of
 life.  There are at least two kinds of "sugar-coated bullets," including
 money, beautiful women, foreign goods and so forth, which corrupt us mate-
 rially.                          The other kind is spiritual "sugar-coated bullets," including
 decadent capitalist ideological viewpoints, culture, art, way of life and
 so forth, which corrode us ideologically, erode our fighting will and con-
 victions, and confuse our minds.   Every nation has its advanced and back-
 ward things.  With respect to all foreign things, we should acquire the
 concept of one divides into two. In other words, we should absorb good
 things from others, but resolutely resist those decadent and backward
 things. Socialism and capitalism are two different worlds.  We are building
 a socialist spiritual civilization which is, by and large, much. loftier
 than capitalism.  With respect to the open-door policy we are now imple-
 menting, there are also various comments from the outside world.  We should
 also adopt the attitude of analysis by adhering to our Marxist stand,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 viewpoints, methods and principles without being swayed by comments from
 the outside world.
 With respect to press reporting, first, we should not report news worship-
 ping things foreign; second, we should pay attention to policy; third, we
 should clearly check on things before publishing reports and avoid boast-
 ful and exaggerated reports.  With respect to reports from the capitalist
 world, our newspapers and periodicals should be very serious and careful
 and should adopt an attitude of analysis and criticism.  We should never
 eulogize them or engage in so-called pure objective reporting.  Being an
 ideological matter, the press cannot be without a class nature.  When class
 is eliminated in the future throughout the world, there will still be
 rights and wrongs, let alone not only when class struggle is still very
 acute and complicated, as at present on the world scale. With regard to
 the achievements of scientific research, advanced technology and rational
 methods of management in the capitalist world, we may report them and
 advocate learning from them but we should absorb, digest or develop them in
 light of the actual conditions in our country and according to our specific
 conditions.  As to its social system, its decadent ideological viewpoints
 and all things diametrically opposed to socialism, we should never eulogize
 them.
 With regard to literature and art, particularly films, operas and novels,
 we should avoid indiscriminate and excessive learning from the skill and
 art of the West.  We should not completely and uncritically accept artistic
 viewpoints of the West.   To deal with those who wantonly and brazenly spread
 bourgeois poison, the first step we should take is to criticize them.   If
 they turn a deaf ear to our criticism, we should transfer them to other
 posts.   If they refuse to mend their ways despite repeated admonitions or
 persist in their mistakes, the third step we should take is to take dis-
 ciplinary measures against them.   Those who deliberately spread ideological
 poison, slander our socialist system, instigate the worship of foreign
 things and fawning on foreign powers and carry out feudal and superstitious
 activities should be condemned by the public opinion of society.   Those who
 truly cause serious consequences should be legally accountable.  What do we
 rely on to maintain popular morale if we do not rely on Marxism in prac-
 ticing socialism and in building our country into a powerful modern social-
 ist country with a high degree of civilization and democracy?  Once our
 spiritual pillar of fighting for communism collapses and once the four
 pillars of abiding by the four fundamental principles collapse, will it
 still be possible for the great building of our Chinese nation not to
 topple?  Once a nation has collapsed spiritually, its politics, economy and
 culture will also break down completely.   There are many lessons drawn from
 such incidents.   Under the conditions of implementing the open-door policy
 toward foreign countries, Communist Party members and party cadres, our
 middle-ranking and senior cadres in particular, should keep a clear head.
 They should firmly believe in Marxism, pay attention to communist purity and
 apply the proletarian world outlook to observe and handle problems.  We
 should stick to the patriotic stand and the stand of the masses and prole-
 tariat.  We should never fall captive to bourgeois ideology.

 Finally, I would like to stress that since ideological and political work is
 so important, its task is so arduous and it is so indispensable to the vic-
 tory of revolution and construction, it is necessary for our party organi-
 zations at various levels to put this work in an important position, place
 it on the important agenda of the party committees, strengthen their
 leadership over ideological and political work, and attach importance to
 strengthening the ranks of ideological and political workers.  Comrade Mao
 Zedong said:  "All departments and organizations should shoulder their
 responsibilities in ideological and political work.   This applies to the
 Communist Party, the Youth League, government departments in charge of this
 work, and especially to heads of educational institutions and teachers."
 ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People")  "The first
 secretaries of the party committees in all provinces, municipalities and
 autonomous regions should personally tackle this question."  ("Speech. at the
 CPC's National Conference on Propaganda Work")  Only by paying attention to
 and studying this question will it be possible to energetically overcome the
 lax and weak situation that exists in the leadership over ideological and
 political work; to correctly solve the various problems that exist in the
 ranks of ideological and political workers; and to bring into full play the
 role of ideological and political work in mobilizing and ensuring the reali-
 zation of the party's tasks in the new period.

 DOING A GOOD JOB IN YOUTH WORK IS AN IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PARTY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 pp 11-13
 [Editorial]
 [Text] The 11th National Congress of the CYL which took place shortly
 after the 12th National Congress of the CPC was a meeting which had his-
 torical significance of great proportions.   The meeting illustrated the
 fighting spirit and the heavy responsibility of the youth of the nation to
 achieve the arduous guiding principles outlined in the 12th National Con-
 gress of the CPC, which they will do with one spirit and one heart under
 the guidance of the CYL with vitality and courage.  The youth of today are
 to be a new generation to carry forward the revolution and forge ahead into
 the future, making themselves milestones in the glorious annals of the
 Chinese youth movement.  We extend our heartfelt wishes for complete suc-
 cess to the congress.
 Our party has always stressed the importance of youth work.   Since the 3d
 Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, as more and more order
 has been brought out of chaos, youth work has become a task of increasing
 importance to the party and the people.  Many of the older generation of
 revolutionaries have with much thought and consideration been very con-
 cerned with the education and maturity of young people, illustrating their
 concern too with the future of the party and the state.   The party Central
 Committee has put a great deal of energy into youth work and the construc-
 tion of the CYL and it has produced directives many times over relating to
 guiding ideology, guiding principles, work methods and cadres' work
 approaches, the contents of which have been extremely profound and far-
 reaching and of great and long-term significance.   The 12th CPC National
 Congress drew up guidelines and directives relating to major problems
 facing the CYL at the moment, the quality and purpose of the CYL, ideologi-
 cal and organizational construction in party-league relations and league-
 masses relations, all of which were fitting to the requirements of the new
 historical era in socialist modernized construction.   On behalf of the
 entire party, the party Central Committee set up models for emphasizing
 youth problems and strengthening leadership in youth work.
 The concern and attention that the party is giving youth work has its roots
 in our party's deep understanding of its own mission and its conscious

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 understanding and appreciation of objective rules and laws.  The realization
 of communist ideals is a very long historical process requiring generation
 upon generation of constant struggle and a long, unbroken process of replace-
 ment and cooperation.  This, therefore, spurs on the party to invest more of
 its own vision in the youth of today.  The extent to which a party, an
 organization or a leader possesses strategic vision and political far-
 sightedness is reflected to a certain degree in his or its concern for
 youth and youth work. To win youth is to win the future.  Whoever wants to
 concern him or herself with the future of the revolutionary cause must also
 concern him or herself with youth work, working for the education and nur-
 turing of the younger generation.
 In order that the causes of the party be passed down from generation to
 generation, with their glory and luster never fading, not only is there a
 need for revolutionization in the cadre ranks as well as youthfulness,
 knowledgeability and expertise 'along with bold and timely selection of a
 batch of middle-aged cadres in their prime, equipped with talent and good
 morals to enrich every level of leadership groups.  What is also needed is
 special concern for the healthy maturity and growth of the younger genera-
 tion.  We must expend a great deal of effort in creating a new generation
 of people filled with ideals, morals, culture and discipline.   In accordance
 with natural and historical rules, the revolutionary causes which our party
 has initiated will unavoidably be passed down onto the shoulders of the
 younger generation.   Future causes will be initiated and constructed by them
 and the history of the future will be written by them.  Succession of duty,
 in the broadest terms, means succession. of duty by a whole generation, it
 is the succession of the new generation to the old, it is the succession of
 the revolutionary torch kindled by the older generation; it is the work of
 the revolutionary causes of the party passed down through generation after
 generation and it is not simply a question of taking over various positions
 of leadership or leadership duties.  Only on the basis of the emergence of
 hundreds and thousands of successors from amidst the masses, can true suc-
 cessors for positions of leadership be more effectively nurtured, prepared
 and selected.   Thus, carrying out good youth work on this younger generation
 so that even more young people will develop into aware communists is the
 fundamental construction on which the question of succession will be solved,
 it is also work which will increase the whole party's and the people of
 every nationality's confidence and aspirations in the future.  We must not
 on any account underestimate the importance of this work.
 Although youth represents "the future," it is also "the present."  Today's
 youth represents the most lively force in the development of our country's
 economy, culture and other causes.  As everyone knows, China is one of the
 world's oldest civilizations, but in terms of its population structure it
 is also a very young nation with young people today representing more than
 half of the total work force.   The vastness of the countryside is home to
 70 percent of China's youth.   In addition the numbers of educated or
 "intellectual" youth are constantly increasing.  The present generation of
 youth will see the best part of their lives during the next 20 to 30 years,
 and this period of time represents a decisive stage in our country's march
 toward socialist modernization.   Success or failure of the modernization

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 program depends to a very large extent on the drive and vitality of this
 generation of youth as well as the extent of their communist consciousness
 and the level of their scientific and cultural understanding and knowledge.
 In our march toward  the glorious targets of the year 2000, the party has
 thrown these important issues such as the training of young talent and the
 exploitation of the potential of youth into the very middle of this tactical
 "game of chess."  The complex and difficult construction and restructuring
 tasks facing this new historical era demand even more than before the
 increased awareness and struggling of youth, demand even more than before
 that the youth of today pass down the glorious traditions of the party and
 that they constantly open up and develop new vistas for our great cause,
 making further contributions and adding new luster.
 In our great cause to construct 'a modernized, highly civilized, socialist
 country with a high degree of democracy, the party and the people place
 great hopes on the young, eagerly hoping that the youth of today will be
 the heroic "shock brigade" and vanguard builders of a socialist spiritual
 and material civilization.  We trust that this new young generation with a
 passionate love and respect for the new socialist lifestyle, will be able
 to shoulder this historic task.   In the last few years the emergence of
 more than a million new Long March shock workers, more than half a million
 model youth teams and youth service brigades has already produced glorious
 records for the youth of China in construction of socialist material and
 spiritual civilizations.  In fact, all we must do is strive to arouse the
 spirit of historical responsibility in this new young generation, as well
 as the sense of being masters of their own society, and they will recognize
 the importance in this new era to commit themselves to the cause of
 modernizing the motherland and bringing prosperity and strength thus
 enriching national self-esteem and self-confidence, so that we may all
 heroically labor for the four modernizations program, steadfastly study in
 line with the demands of the four modernizations and develop new styles in
 line with the needs of the four modernizations,   Thus, realization of "the
 basic turns for the better" and the "quadrupling of production output" and
 the aims to revitalize China are given further hope and greater assurances.
 In the past few years, social problems of all kinds have been reflected to
 a large extent in the youth of today.  Problems relating to higher educa-
 tion, employment, housing, wages and marriage have become burdens for youth,
 affecting both their thinking and their vitality.   Implementation of the
 open-door policy and policies relating to injecting life into the domestic  `
 economy have resulted in some negative influences becoming apparent in some
 young people.   These influences and problems to be found amongst some of
 China's youth often affect society as a whole, leaving their mark on family
 life, in schools, organizations, work units, even affecting the party's
 style of work and the mood of society.   This only stresses the importance
 of giving more than average attention to youth problems and youth work.   In
 order to catalyse the stable, coordinated development of social life and
 bring about the smooth running of modernized construction, we must expend
 greater effort in the education of young people, setting up good conditions
 for youth work and solving more problems relating to young people which can
 be solved.  A few years ago problems of conviction and mood in some people

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 attracted general concern and discussion in society.  Because of the
 thorough attention that the party gave this situation by organizing strength
 in every area, steadfastly carrying out ideological work, actively solving
 objective problems, providing youth with encouragement, guidance and con-
 cern, and relying to a great extent on young people teaching and educating
 themselves, giving full rein to the use of positive models and "internal
 motive force," thus gradually creating a healthy public opinion and an
 upward, positive mood, and thereby helping the increasing firmness of com-
 munist conviction in the broad masses of the youth while the general mood
 continued to improve, positively influencing improvements in the overall
 mood of society.
 After positive affirmation of progress amongst youth and successes in youth
 work, the party's 12th national congress went on to clearly point out that
 youth work was still lagging behind modern requirements.  A change in this
 situation requires work in many areas and the key to this work is the
 strengthening and perfection of leadership in youth work. All levels of the
 party organization should come to a closer understanding of the youth of
 China, studying problems related to youth and carrying out the leadership
 work in accordance with the specific rules and regulations relating to youth
 work and in line with the characteristics of the youth of today.   Cadres of
 both the party and the CYL should go to factories, the villages and young
 students, in fact to all places where young people are to be found and get
 into close contact with the young people, discussing personal matters and
 listening to their opinions and feelings.  The cadres must make investiga-
 tions amongst the young people and must carry out propaganda work while
 getting a direct understanding, making direct-observations and analyses of
 the situation and feeling the ideological "pulse" of young people and open-
 ing up a heart-to-heart link road between the party and young people.   Only
 in this way may we hope to have any persuasiveness and attraction in our
 ideological work with young people and only in this way can we hope to win
 their confidence and their admiration.  We should make friends with the
 young people of China in order that we may overcome bureaucratism and
 improve our work style.  We must also organize our forces to carry out
 systematic investigations and research into the more outstanding and larger
 problems evident amongst the youth of today, such as ideological problems or
 those of a policy-making nature.   Upon making such investigations we should
 draw up various suitable solutions and solve the problems gradually accord-
 ing to their gravity.
 Today, in our struggle to open up a new era of socialist modernized con-
 struction we must pay special attention and show great concern for edu-
 cating young people in patriotism and communist ideology as well as ques-
 tions of studying culture, knowledge and the sciences.  We must make them
 fully understand that without the guidance of communist ideology and with-
 out modern scientific and cultural knowledge it is impossible to carry out
 socialist modernized construction.  We trust that as long as the young of
 today study the great works of Marx, Lenin and Mao Zedong as well as party
 documents, and as long as they adopt a scientific attitude in their handling
 of any social trends of thought, then they will be able to approach and
 imbibe Marxism through their own practical experience and they will be able

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 to constantly raise their communist consciousness.  As far as getting to
 grips with necessary scientific knowledge, production technology and
 specialized skills for modernized construction is concerned, this is even
 more a question of young people carrying out their own hard work and
 arduous study.  Here it is necessary that we help raise their consciousness,
 clear up their ideology and help and encourage them to take the correct
 ideological road.   Every level of the party organization should ensure that
 such work appears on their daily agenda and they should actively set up the
 necessary conditions for the healthy development and maturity of young
 people, using every measure and work method possible to encourage and
 assist young people to study Marxism as well as scientific and cultural
 works.  We must help young people establish a study mentality aimed at the
 motherland and the people, and teach young people to cherish labor and come
 to understand that today's studies will result in better laboring tomorrow
 and that study is in no way a means to shake off labor in the future.  We
 should place lofty aspirations in the hearts of young people and should
 teach them the need to go wherever they are most needed in the motherland.
 We must help young people to actively train themselves to become cultured,
 scientifically knowledgeable workers with a communist consciousness.
 As the mass organization of the advanced youth of China, the CYL is the
 party's right hand and also its reserve army with a direct responsibility
 to youth work.   Every level of the party organization should depend on the
 organization of the CYL to mobilize enthusiasm in every area so that youth
 work correctly becomes a socially related cause central to the CYL.   In
 accordance with the demands of new party documents, party organizations
 should steadfastly support the CYL's implementation of their work, mobi-
 lizing enthusiasm and creativity, based on the characteristics and needs of
 the youth masses, thereby giving full rein to the CYL's role as a shock
 brigade and its role as a bridge link with young people.  We must direct the
 CYL to serve young people by offering help in discussing major problems and
 working out their personal lifestyles, thereby actively helping young
 people to clear up any problems they may have connected with their thinking,
 their work of their lives in general.  We must provide CYL cadres with
 directives, offer them subjects to handle and work methods so that they may
 go straight into the practical situation, amongst the masses, opening up
 new phases in their work.   The party. organization should ensure that young
 cadres are selected for positions within the CYL to give them full rein and
 undergo suitable training.   We must actively help and encourage the CYL to
 improve and perfect the CYL's system of leadership, readjusting and recon-
 structing every level of the league, in particular the grassroots levels,
 and making alterations in certain areas, such as a certain slackness that
 exists in villages.   Thus the CYL may become a school for young people to
 study communism in a practical sense.
 Youth work is a kind of work with a very strong social nature to it.  The
 natural superiority of our socialist system provides reliable assurances
 that the whole party and the entire society will together express their full
 concern for the development and wholesome maturity of young people.  We must
 establish everywhere, throughout society, in every region and in every
 department a solid feeling of concern for youth work and concern for the

 descendants of the revolution.  Every region should ensure that construction
 work for youth education and youth activities enters construction planning,
 and should decide to invest more into this cause which is an embodiment of
 the future. All departments, organizations and work units should adopt a
 positive attitude and do their utmost in youth work.   Educational, propaganda
 and cultural departments should take on more work involving young people and
 make efforts to strengthen idealistic, moral, disciplinary, cultural and
 legal education in young people.  We ardently hope that artists, writers
 and journalists will turn out more healthy, inspirational work thus provid-
 ing an even better service to the nurturing of the new generation of social-
 ists.  We believe that so long as the party gives sufficient attention,
 leadership is strengthened, the organization of the CYL is made dependable
 and the forces of every area of society are mobilized, then youth work in
 China will see the flourishing development of a new era in the glorious
 implementation of socialist modernized construction.

 THE NEW CONSTITUTION IS THE GENERAL PROGRAM FOR RUNNING THE COUNTRY WELL AND
 GIVING THE PEOPLE PEACE AND SECURITY DURING THE NEW PERIOD
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 pp 14-17
 [Article.by Wang Shuwen [3769 0647 2429], Xiao Weiyun [5135 5588 0061] and
 Xu Chongde [6079 1504 1795]]
 [Text]  The Fifth Session of the Fifth NPC solemnly approved the "Constitu-
 tion of the PRC" and promulgated it for implementation.   This is a great
 event in the political life of our country.   The new constitution has
 scientifically summed up the historical experience of the prolonged revolu-
 tion and construction of the people of our country and stipulated the basic
 system and basic tasks for our state.   It meets the demands of the people,
 suits our national conditions, represents the fundamental interests of the
 people of all nationalities throughout our country and meets the require-
 ments of the socialist modernization.                        It is, therefore, a general program
 for running the country well and giving the people peace and security dur-
 ing the new historical period in our country.
 A Summary of Historical Experiences
 The reason why the new constitution can serve as a general program for run-
 ning the country well and giving the people peace and security is because
 it has conscientiously summed up the historical experiences since the
 founding of the PRC.   True, there must be political, economic, ideological
 and many other factors for a socialist cause to be prosperous, but undoubt-
 edly, one of the important factors lies in whether we attach enough impor-
 tance in our guiding ideology to the legal system.
 During the initial period after the founding of the new China, we did attach
 importance to the legal system.  At that time, it was impossible for us to
 formulate a constitution, but on the eve of the founding of the PRC in 1949,
 we drew up a "Common Program" which played the role of a provisional con-
 stitution.   This program was approved under the direct leadership of the
 CPC by a plenum of the CPPCC.   It served as a guiding principle that the
 people of all nationalities throughout our country had to observe and it
 played an important role in real life in the initial period after the found-
 ing of the PRC.

 In September 1954, the First Session of the First NPC drew up our country's
 first socialist constitution.  This was a relatively perfect constitution.
 It defined and stipulated the principles-of people's democracy and socialism
 in the form of a fundamental law.  At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong stressed
 that the constitution "must be implemented by each and every one of the
 people in our country.  Personnel of the state organs must especially take
 the lead in doing so."  Because at that time the guiding principles and
 basic policies of the party were correct, the constitution clearly reflected
 these policies and moreover all the party attached importance to the imple-
 mentation of that constitution, that constitution served as the legal system
 in promoting and guaranteeing the transformation from new democracy to
 socialism in our country.
 After 1957, along with the emergence and development of "leftist" mistakes,
 our sense of a socialist legal system weakened in.our guiding ideology,
 democratic centralism was undermined, the work of the state gradually left
 the orbit of the constitution and the legal system and even some correct
 principles of great importance in the constitution were wrongly criticized.
 During the 10 years of civil disorder, democratic life was very abnormal,
 the constitution lost its authority and there was nothing to guarantee the
 just rights and personal security of the people.  As a result, a basic-level
 general election did not take place for more than 10 years, sessions of the
 NPC were suspended for 10 years in a rota and our national economy incurred
 tremendous losses.  In 1975, the Fourth NPC held a session and approved our
 country's second constitution, in which among other things, clauses about
 "persisting in carrying on the revolution under the proletarian dictator-
 ship" and "enforcing an all-round dictatorship" were written.  Thus, the
 guiding ideology of that second constitution was wrong.
 In October 1976, the Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary clique was smashed.
 In March 1978, the First Session of the Fifth NPC promulgated our country's
 third constitution.  Because of the limitations of the historical condi-
 tions, that constitution could not be free from some of the influence of
 "leftism."  The 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee held
 in December the same year marked a great turning point of far-reaching
 historical significance.  One of the great contributions of that session
 was the emphasis that it placed on the development of socialist democracy
 and the strengthening of the socialist legal system.   It was mainly from
 that time on that all the party and all the people in our country began
 anew to pay attention to the constitution and legal system.  At the same
 time, the party and the state have done a great deal of work to strengthen
 the socialist legal system.
 Since 1979, the key to the work of the whole nation has been shifted onto
 economic construction.   Through 4 years of hard work, our country's economy
 has embarked on a path of healthy and sound development.  Education, science
 and culture have become initially prosperous, the unity between the three
 basic forces of workers, peasants and intellectuals has been strengthened
 and the relationships of equality and unity among all the nationalities have
 been strengthened, the patriotic united front has been further expanded, and
 the socialist democracy and legal system has undergone improvement and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 perfection. All these great achievements demanded reflection in our funda-
 mental law.  Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,
 we have fulfilled the arduous task of bringing order out of chaos in our
 guiding ideology, formulated many correct principles and policies and adopted
 many major measures that have been proved by practice to be effective.  All
 these need to be stipulated in the new socialist constitution, and thus we
 will make our constitution a powerful weapon for our socialist moderniza-
 tion.
 The 12th party congress has formulated a correct program for the creation
 of an overall new situation in our socialist modernization and put forward
 the goal of gradually achieving the four modernizations and building up our
 country into a socialist country with a high degree of civilization and
 democracy.  In the new historical period, in order to unite the people of
 all nationalities throughout the country, satisfactorily rule and build up
 our country, ensure the prosperous development of the cause of our socialist
 modernization and victoriously fulfill the general task and the magnificent
 strategic goal put forward by the 12th party congress, our state must have a
 new general program and a new fundamental cardinal law.   The recently
 promulgated new constitution is precisely such a general program and
 fundamental law.
 The New Constitution Is a Powerful Weapon for Running the Country Well and
 Giving the People Peace and Security in the New Period
 The role of the new constitution in guaranteeing the long-term good rule
 and stability of our country is mainly reflected in the following aspects:
 1)  It stipulates that the basic task for the state in the new period is to
 concentrate its strength on carrying out socialist modernization.   The con-
 solidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, the stability of social
 order and the improvement of the people's material and cultural lives must
 after all be determined by the success of the socialist modernization.  In
 order to ensure the vigorous development of the social productive force,
 the new constitution provides relatively perfect stipulations on the social-
 ist economic system in our country in the light of the actual level and need
 of the development of the productive force at present.  The new constitution
 enacts the principle of developing a diversified form of economy under the
 prerequisite of persisting in maintaining the leading position of the
 state-run economy and the implementation of the principle of taking the
 planned economy as the core and supplementing it with the regulation of
 market mechanism and stipulates the decisionmaking power and democratic
 management in our state-owned enterprises and collective economic organiza-
 tions.   Besides, it also provides that foreigners are allowed to invest in
 and carry out economic cooperation with China according to the law.  These
 important new stipulations reflect the guidelines and achievements of the
 reform in our economic structure and the objective economic law of social-
 ism.  They are of very great significance in promoting the overall upsurge
 of our socialist economy and ensuring our country's prosperous development.

 2)  It stipulates the construction of a high degree of socialist spiritual
 civilization.  This will ensure the correct direction of and provide a tre-
 mendously great motivation for the construction of socialist material
 civilization.  Apart from enacting that the construction of socialist
 spiritual civilization is a basic task of our country, it also makes clear
 and definite stipulations on the way of building the socialist spiritual
 civilization.  In the sphere of cultural construction, the new constitution
 enacts some special stipulations on developing by the state the undertakings
 of education, science, medical service, sanitation, sport and culture.  Con-
 cerning ideological construction, the'new constitution stipulates, "The
 state strengthens the building of socialist spiritual civilization through
 spreading education in high ideals and morality, general education and edu-
 cation in discipline and the legal system, and through promoting the formu-
 lation and observance of rules of conduct and common pledges by different
 sections of the people in urban and rural areas."  Furthermore, it stipu-
 lates that "the state advocates the civic virtues of love for the mother-
 land, for the people, for labor, for science and for socialism; it educates
 the people in patriotism, collectivism, internationalism and communism and
 in dialectical and historical materialism; it combats capitalist feudalist
 and other decadent ideas."  These stipulations facilitate raising the scien-
 tific and cultural level of the people all over the country, training all
 kinds of professional personnel and achieving the modernization of our
 science and technology.  They also facilitate turning our people into a
 people with ideals, virtues, education and sense of discipline, developing
 within the people relationships of unity, friendship and mutual assistance
 and stirring up their revolutionary spirit to jointly strive in the struggle
 for the fulfillment of the basic task of the new period.  These regulations
 are favorable to improving social order, changing the general mood of
 society, eliminating and cracking down on all kinds of unhealthy trends and
 practices, resisting the erosion of all kinds of corruptive ideology and
 establishing fine morality and the general mood in society.
 3)  It stipulates that we should strive to develop a higher degree of social-
 ist democracy, which is an important guarantee for the construction of the
 socialist material and spiritual civilizations.   The new constitution makes
 the following important stipulations on the development of socialist
 democracy:   (1) It enacts that our country is a socialist country with a
 people's democratic dictatorship.   Our people's democratic dictatorship is
 in essence a proletarian dictatorship.  However, the term, people's demo-
 cratic dictatorship, can more clearly show our country's class situation
 and the broad foundation and democratic nature of our state power.  This
 dictatorship guarantees the most extensive possible democracy within our
 broad masses of the people and dictatorship is only enforced against a very
 small number of enemies.   (2) According to the principle of democratic
 centralism, it has strengthened and developed our country's basic political
 system--the system of people's congresses, in order to ensure that the
 people can more satisfactorily exercise their state power through the NPC
 and the various levels of local people's congresses and that the state
 organs can more effectively lead and organize socialist modernizations.
 (3)   It extends the socialist democracy into all the aspects of our politi-
 cal, economic, cultural and social life.   It stipulates that the people can

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 manage the affairs of the state, the economic and cultural undertakings and
 the social affairs through all kinds of channels and forms in accordance
 with the law, including forming the basic-level autonomous mass organiza-
 tions such as neighborhood committees and village residents committees and
 including the democratic management in state-owned and collective economic
 organizations.   (4) It adds some new clauses on the basic rights of citi-
 zens to the stipulations in the 1954 constitution.   For example, it grants
 a citizen the right to criticize and give suggestions to the personnel of
 the state and prohibits any encroachment on the personal dignity of a citi-
 zen.   Moreover, it has made all these stipulations more. practical, clear and
 definite.   (5) It expands the power of nationality autonomy and the decision-
 making power of local governments and fully respects and guarantees,the
 democratic rights of the minority nationalities in managing their own
 internal affairs.   (6) It stipulates that we should continue to consolidate
 and develop the broad patriotic united front led by the CPC, participated in
 by all the democratic parties and mass bodies and consisting of all the
 socialist laborers and all the patriots who support socialism or who support
 the reunification of the motherland.  These stipulations are of ,great sig-
 nificance in safeguarding the unification of the state, the unity of the
 people and the unity of all nationalities throughout our country and in
 consolidating and developing the lively political situation of peace,
 stability and unity.  At the same time, it can really ensure that the
 people can act as the masters of the country and arouse their sense of
 responsibility as masters of the country and the creative spirit of the
 millions of our people in order to satisfactorily develop our great social-
 ist country.
 The new constitution closely combines socialist democracy with the develop-
 ment of the socialist legal system.  Thus, it serves as the legal founda-
 tion for perfecting the socialist legal system as well as the foundation
 for systemizing and legalizing socialist democracy.  The new constitution
 provides a series of new regulations of great importance for the perfection
 of the socialist legal system.  Among these regulations are the clauses
 related to earnestly ensuring the implementation of the constitution and to
 the safeguarding of the integrity and dignity of the socialist legal system.
 At the same time, in the chapter "The Fundamental Rights and Duties of
 Citizens," it has restored the principle of all citizens being equal
 before the law and stipulates that every citizen enjoys the rights provided
 by the constitution and the law and must, at the same time, perform the
 duties prescribed by the constitution and law and that in enjoying his
 freedom and exercising his rights, a citizen must not injure the interests
 of the state, the community or the collective or encroach on the freedom
 and rights of another citizen.  All these stipulations on the nature of the
 principle related to the perfection of the socialist legal system are of
 very great significance in ensuring the implementation and observation of
 the constitution and law, establishing fine production, work and social
 order and maintaining a permanent peace and stable rule in our country.

 Conscientiously Ensure the Implementation of the New Constitution
 Having formulated our new constitution, we must conscientiously implement
 it in our real life and really manage to strictly observe and enforce all
 the laws that have been promulgated and punish without exception all
 offenders against the law.  Only by so doing can we give play to the role
 of the constitution as a cardinal law.  In our country, because the con-
 stitution and law failed to be observed for a long time in the past, the
 broad masses of the people naturally show very great concern over the
 question of whether the constitution can be implemented and observed.  The
 new constitution has summed up both the positive and negative experiences
 in the development of the socialist legal system in the past 30 and more
 years since the founding of the PRC and provides a series of new stipula-
 tions on guaranteeing the implementation of the constitution.  This embodies
 the will of the people all over the country and reflects the general trend
 of events.   These stipulations are mainly on the following aspects:
 1.   The new constitution clearly stipulates that it is the fundamental law
 of the state and has supreme legal authority.  By the term of fundamental
 law, it means that it defines the basic system and basic tasks of the
 state in legal form and embodies the fundamental interests of the people of
 our country.   That is why it has supreme legal authority and no law or
 administrative or local laws or regulations are allowed to conflict with it.
 This is why all organizations and individuals must regard the constitution
 as the fundamental guiding principle for their actions, must observe the
 constitution and the law and must be held responsible for any violation
 against the constitution or the law.  Thus, we will be able to guarantee
 the supreme legal authority of the constitution and safeguard its dignity
 and prevent any violation against it.
 The new constitution furthermore stipulates the strict procedures for the
 revision of the constitution.  A revision must be moved by the NPC Standing
 Committee or one-third of the NPC deputies and must be approved by a
 majority of two-thirds of all the members of NPC deputies.   This strict
 provision on the procedure of revising the constitution is by no means a
 pure question of procedure or method.   It is aimed at enabling the consti-
 tution to fully reflect and embody the will and interests of the people and
 facilitating maintaining the stability of the constitution.
 2.  The new constitution strengthens supervision on the implementation of
 the constitution.  In order to guarantee the implementation of the consti-
 tution, it should not only clearly define its position and role in the law
 but should also set up an organ to supervise the implementation of the con-
 stitution and punish offenders who have violated the constitution, thus
 ensuring that all organizations and individuals really observe the con-
 stitution.  The new constitution stipulates that the NPC is entitled to
 supervise the implementation of the constitution and to change or cancel
 any inappropriate resolution of its Standing Committee.  At the same time,
 it stipulates that the NPC Standing Committee is entitled to explain the
 constitution, supervise the implementation of the constitution and delete
 any administrative laws or regulations formulated by and any resolutions

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 and orders issued by the State Council that conflict with the constitution
 and law and to delete any local laws or regulations or any resolution
 formulated by any provincial, regional or municipal organ of state power
 that conflict with the constitution, law or the administrative laws or
 regulations.  According to the NPC Organization Act, the NPC and the
 special committees led by its Standing Committee are entitled to examine
 and discuss the State Council's administrative laws and regulations and
 decisions and orders and the local laws, regulations and decisions formu-
 lated or issued by any provincial, regional or municipal organ of state
 power that are regarded by the NPC Standing Committee as being in conflict
 with the constitution and law and submitted by the committee for examina-
 tion and discussion.   It can furthermore report on these laws, regulations,
 decisions and orders to the NPC Standing Committee.  These regulations are
 more detailed, feasible and vigorous than those in the 1954 and 1978 con-
 stitutions.
 3.   Our 1 billion people are a tremendously great force for safeguarding
 and guaranteeing the constitution.   The new constitution attaches great
 importance to mobilizing the people throughout the country to safeguard the
 constitution and guarantee its implementation, stipulating that the people
 of all nationalities throughout the country, all the state organs, the armed
 forces, all political parties, mass bodies, enterprises and undertakings are
 endowed with the duties of safeguarding the dignity and guaranteeing the
 implementation of the constitution.   Relying on the people for strength in
 safeguarding the constitution and striking the root of the idea of guaran-
 teeing the implementation of the constitution deep among the people is a
 distinguishing feature of our country in guaranteeing the implementation of
 the constitution.   Of course, in order to give full play to the great
 strength of the 1 billion people in safeguarding the constitution, we
 should continue to carry out widespread propaganda of the new constitution
 among the masses of the people and organize them to study it in order to
 make the principle and system stipulated in the constitution strike deep
 root in the hearts of the people.   There are bound to be obstacles in
 implementing the new constitution.   Therefore, we should moreover mobilize
 the people to fight against any activities that violate the constitution.
 Thus, being safeguarded and supervised by the broad masses of socialist-
 minded people, the implementation of the new constitution will certainly be
 earnestly guaranteed.
 4.   The key to guaranteeing the implementation of the constitution lies in
 that the CPC and the people of all nationalities throughout the country
 jointly safeguard the constitution and guarantee its implementation.   The
 new constitution stipulates, "All state organs, the armed forces, all polit-
 ical parties and public organizations and all enterprises and undertakings
 must abide by the constitution and the law."  The "all political parties"
 mentioned here certainly include the CPC.   The party constitution also
 clearly stipulates, "The party must act within the limits of the constitu-
 tion and law."  This shows that the CPC attaches extremely great impor-
 tance to the constitution and is determined to fight for safeguarding the
 dignity of the constitution.   The CPC represents the interests of the
 Chinese people and beside these, it has no special interests of its own,

 It leads the people to formulate the new constitution and will also safe-
 guard the constitution and guarantee its implementation jointly with all
 the people in the country.
 Because of the leading position of our party in the state, if only all the
 CPC members, especially CPC leading cadres, can set examples by their own
 actions in satisfactorily observing and safeguarding the dignity of the
 constitution, they will surely produce a fine and great influence on the
 broad masses of the people and make them even more consciously observe it.
 When under the party's leadership, the people throughout our country make
 joint efforts to ensure the implementation of the constitution, we will
 be able to give full play to the role of the new constitution in running
 the country well and giving the people peace and security.

 COMRADE MAO ZEDONG INITIATED THE NEW STYLE OF MAKING INVESTIGATION AND
 STUDY--A STUDY OF 'MAO ZEDONG'S WRITINGS ON RURAL SURVEYS'
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 pp 18-22
 [Article by Wu Shengmin [0702 3932 3046]]
 [Text] At a time when the whole party and people throughout the country are
 firmly implementing the spirit of the 12th party congress, "Mao Zedong's
 Writings on Rural Surveys" edited by the CPC Central Committee Documents
 Research Office has been published.  The publication of this volume of
 documents has provided us with a powerful ideological weapon for upholding
 and developing Mao Zedong Thought in the new historical period and for
 investigating and studying new conditions and problems in socialist mod-
 ernization.   Comrade Mao Zedong made a great deal of rural surveys during
 the Northern Expedition and the agrarian revolutionary war.  Regardless of
 whether on the shore of the Xiangjiang River and the foothills of Jinggang
 Mountains, or the banks of Ganjiang River and the Wuyi Mountains, there are
 mementos of the glorious achievements of his investigation and study.  Dur-
 ing the agrarian revolutionary war in particular, in those war-ridden years
 and on the march fighting from the south to the north, he always made use of
 every opportunity to conduct investigation and study and wrote numerous rich
 and profound Marxist-Leninist survey findings.  During the war of resistance
 against Japan, he personally edited a part of the survey findings saved from
 the war into a book entitled "Rural Surveys" and also wrote the preface as
 well as the postscript.  The "Mao Zedong's Writings on Rural Surveys"
 (hereinafter referred to in brief as "Writings") published at present, is a
 revised and enlarged edition based on the book "Rural Surveys."  The whole
 book contains a total of 17 chapters divided into two parts.  The first part
 discusses the investigation and study articles and speeches, and the second
 part is on survey findings and land laws.
 In Chapter Four of Part I of "Writings," Comrade Mao Zedong collectively and
 systematically expounded his theory on investigation and study.  This theory
 was a systematic summary and generalization of the rich experience he accumu-
 lated in investigation and study.   In."Oppose Book Worship" written in May
 1930, Comrade Mao Zedong for the first time incisively expounded his theory
 of investigation and study and put forward his famous thesis "no investiga-
 tion, no right to speak."  The "Circular of the General Political Department
 on Taking a Census and Land Conditions" issued by Comrade Mao Zedong on

 2 April 1931, in the capacity of director of the General Political Depart-
 ment, was an important historical document.  It put forward for the first
 time the important slogan of "No correct investigation, likewise no right
 to speak."  This supplemented and developed the thesis of "no investiga-
 tion, no right to speak."  The two works, "Foreword.and Postscript to
 'Rural Surveys,"' and "On Rural Surveys," written by Comrade Mao Zedong
 in 1941, further summed up the experiences of the rural surveys he carried
 out during the Northern Expedition and the agrarian revolutionary war.
 After the publication of these two works, Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on
 investigation and study was found scattered in many of his works.  However,
 the four works included in "Writings" have clearly generalized and
 thoroughly expounded some of the basic points. of this theory.  This unique
 scientific theory is an important aspect of the valuable legacy he left to
 us and it is also an integral part.of the whole of Mao Zedong Thought.
 Part II of "Writings" contains 11 survey findings and two "land laws."
 "Examples of Chinese Tenant-Peasant Life" was one of the earliest of the
 unique rural surveys made by Comrade Mao Zedong that had been preserved.
 From the hypothetical condition of the expenditure and income of typical
 tenant-peasants, he arrived at the general conclusion that the Chinese
 tenant-peasants must be operating at a great loss under the heavy rent
 system in China at that time.   The Xinwu survey was the most ambitious
 survey carried out by Comrade Mao Zedong.   The work contained about 80,000
 characters.   It recorded in detail and analyzed such conditions as the old
 land relations and the agrarian struggle.   This work devoted an entire chap-
 ter some 30,000 characters long to "the commerce of Xinwu" and constituted
 the only systematic findings left by Comrade Mao Zedong from his urban and
 rural surveys.  The Xingguo survey carried out by Comrade Mao Zedong was
 only slightly smaller in scale, and it made up for what was missing in the
 Xinwu survey.   The contents of "Xinwu Survey" and "Xingguo Survey" were
 extremely rich and profound and contained many brilliant expositions.  They
 are Marxist sociological works of scientific value.  The famous works
 "Changgangxiang Survey" and "Caixixiang Survey" by Comrade Mao Zedong sum-
 med up and popularized the typical experiences of two model villages in the
 Central Soviet Area which made a success of the building of political power,
 economy, culture and education during the revolutionary war.   This is an
 example of the use of typical examples to direct work employed by Comrade
 Mao Zedong in the form of survey reports.  These two findings have provided
 valuable historical materials for the study of the building of central
 revolutionary base areas and the history of the Chinese revolution.  The
 many findings in "Writings" have unfolded before us a panoramic picture of
 the agrarian revolution of former years.  After reading through "Writings,"
 I closed the book and was lost in thought.  Undoubtedly I will be motivated
 by Comrade Mao Zedong's enthusiastic revolutionary spirit of conducting
 thoroughgoing and painstaking investigation and study and will obtain great
 inspiration and enlightenment.
 Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:   "The victory of the Chinese revolutionary
 struggle depends on Chinese comrades who understand conditions in China."

 ("Writings," p 7; hereafter only the page number of the quotation will be
 ,given.)  This sentence embodied the spirit of seeking truth from facts as
 well as maintaining independence and keeping the initiative in one's own
 hands, resisted the tendency of book worship prevailing at that time, and
 stressed the importance of understanding conditions in China by means of
 investigation and study.  According to him, maintaining investigation and
 study and having a practical understanding of conditions in China had an
 important bearing on the success and failure of the Chinese revolution.
 Precisely for the sake of finding out the real conditions in China, explor-
 ing the law and path of the Chinese revolution and charting a course for
 the Chinese revolution to the other shore of victory, Comrade Mao Zedong
 ushered in an era of new style of investigation and study and pointed out
 the correct orientation as well as basic method for the Chinese revolution
 to our party.
 In "Foreword and Postscript to 'Rural Survey,"' Comrade Mao Zedong said:
 "Without genuine and concrete understanding of the actual condition of
 classes in Chinese society, there cannot be genuine and effective leader-
 ship."   (p 15)  During the Northern Expedition, he went on many occasions
 to the countryside, towns, factories and mines to carry out investigation
 and study of the classes in Chinese society, and wrote the brilliant works
 "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Report on an Investiga-
 tion of the Peasant Movement in Hunan."  These two works analyzed the
 economic position of the classes in Chinese society and their attitude
 toward the revolution, discussed such basic questions as the essence,
 target and leadership as well as allied forces of the Chinese revolution,
 progressively evolved into the basic ideology of the Chinese revolution and
 laid the theoretical foundation for mapping out the general line of our new
 democratic revolution.
 After the failure of the Northern Expedition, under the guidance of
 Marxism-Leninism, Comrade Mao Zedong diligently searched for a revolutionary
 path in keeping with conditions in China.  On the basis of extensive inves-
 tigation and study, he summed up his personal experience in the struggle to
 open up the revolutionary base areas of Jinggang Mountains, southern Jiangxi
 and western Fujian, drew on the experience of our party in the struggle to
 establish other revolutionary base areas, and in October and November 1928,
 wrote "Why Is It That Red Political Power Can Exist in China?" and "The
 Struggle in Jinggang Mountains."  In January 1930, he wrote such important
 historical documents as "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire."  He
 expounded and proved the reasons and conditions why Red political power can
 exist for a long time in China and pointed out the future and aspiration of
 the Chinese revolution, which enabled the party members as well as the
 worker and peasant masses to strengthen their confidence in the victory of
 the revolution.  What deserves to be pointed out here is the brilliant idea
 of "an armed independent regime of workers and peasants" proposed by Comrade
 Mao Zedong, which in theory and practice pointed out that the path of the
 Chinese revolution, characterized by encircling the cities from the rural
 areas, was different from the Russian October Revolution.   This was also a
 flying leap of his in the ideological process of finding a correct path for
 the Chinese revolution as well as his new contribution to the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 Marxist-Leninist theory of the state.  This Chinese-type path of seizing
 political power with armed force brought about the victory of the Chinese
 revolution.
 During the agrarian revolutionary war, by means of investigation and study
 Comrade Mao Zedong also formulated policies and principles suited to the
 path of the Chinese revolution, such as agrarian revolution policies, poli-
 cies for the building of political power, economy and culture and education
 of revolution base areas, policies for the building of people's armed forces
 and proletarian political power as well as a complete set of strategic and
 tactical principles of guerrilla warfare.  The enormous amount of rural
 surveys conducted by Comrade Mao Zedong provided him with a reliable basis
 to more promptly and properly solve basic policies in the agrarian revolu-
 tion.  For example, in the Xinwu survey of May 1930, when he discovered
 that in taking from those who have too much and giving to those who have too
 little the rich peasants only handed over the poor land but were unwilling
 to part with the good land, he realized that "the method of solving the
 problem of rich peasants is not just taking from those who have too much and
 giving to those who have too little but also to take from the fat to pad the
 lean." (p 22)  Therefore at the Tingzhou meeting (also called the Nanyang
 meeting) which he called in the same year, a resolution on the problem of
 rich peasants was adopted which correctly stipulated that apart from "taking
 from those who have too much and giving to those who have too little," the
 principle of "taking from the fat to pad the lean" should also be added.
 This was an important policy decision restricting the rich peasants and
 benefiting the poor peasants, and thereby developed the agrarian revolution
 in depth.   Then there was also the case of the question of land ownership.
 Since the slogan of "State ownership of land" put forward at the "August 7
 meeting," regardless of whether in the "land law" of the Jinggang Mountains
 or the "land law" of Xingguo County, they both stipulated that land owner-
 ship belonged to. the government and not to the peasants, and the peasants
 were only entitled to use the land.  For a long time, because the ownership
 of the peasants over the land had not been determined, the enthusiasm of the
 peasants for production was seriously affected.  Comrade Mao Zedong dis-
 covered this problem as a result of investigation, and in a letter to the
 soviet government of Jiangxi on 28 February 1931, he clearly instructed,
 "The provincial soviet should notify local government at various levels"
 that the land already distributed could be "privately owned" by the farmers
 and was "inviolable," and "they could decide for themselves on its lend and
 lease and buying or selling."  This correctly solved the land ownership
 problem left hanging for many years, aroused the enthusiasm of the broad
 masses of peasants for developing agricultural production and greatly con-
 solidated the victory of the agrarian revolution.
 In short, the process of investigation and study was the process used by
 Comrade Mao Zedong to understand the Chinese revolution and to solve the
 problems of the Chinese revolution.  The fact that he could solve some of
 the important issues of the Chinese revolution and made tremendous contri-
 butions to the Chinese revolution during the Northern Expedition and the
 agrarian revolutionary war was inseparable from his long and persistent
 investigation and study.

 Investigation and study mean learning from the masses and seeking truth from
 the masses.  Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:  "The masses are the real
 heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, and without this
 understanding it is impossible to acquire even the most rudimentary
 knowledge." (p 17)  This is an irreversible truth.  The masses are practi-
 tioners of production struggle as well as class struggle and perceivers of
 social practice.   Therefore, the masses have most practical experience, most
 abundant knowledge, most profound wisdom and greatest creativity.  This is
 the basic reason why every one of us must go deep among the masses for
 investigation and study and to seek the truth.
 The practice of Comrade Mao Zedong's investigation and study showed that he
 respected the masses and regarded them as his teachers.   Each time he talked
 with the people who supplied him with information in investigation and
 study, the feeling of profound gratefulness could be found in his words
 and expressions.  When he talked about two old gentlemen who supplied him
 with materials on urban problems in "Xinwu Survey," he said:  "I thank the
 two gentlemen for their instructions.  They have enabled me like a young
 pupil to start learning something about the condition of urban commerce.  I
 am indeed extremely delighted." (p 56)  In "Foreword and Postscript to
 'Rural Surveys,"' he recalled calling on some cadres, peasants, scholars,
 prison officials, merchants and revenue clerks and called them his
 "esteemed teachers" for "they taught me many things I have not heard of
 before." (p 16)  The fact that Comrade Mao Zedong could respect the masses
 as teachers, earnestly learn from the masses, feel an urgent need to learn
 from the masses and consider learning from the masses a delightful experi-
 ence was because he had used the Marxist concept of the masses are the
 makers of history to guide his own action.  People who do not understand
 this viewpoint cannot look up to the masses.  They do not believe that the
 masses have infinite wisdom or that the masses are the best teachers and
 will definitely not learn from them.
 There must be a correct attitude of learning from the masses.   The correct
 attitude is to properly carry out the basic conditions for investigation
 and study.   What is the correct attitude of learning from the masses?  As
 Comrade Mao Zedong said, we must shed the ugly mantle of pretentiousness
 and become willing pupils.   In other words, we must modestly study and must
 not feel ashamed to ask and learn from our subordinates.  We must have the
 courage to acknowledge our ignorance and willingly learn from the masses
 with the attitude of pupils.   Otherwise, the masses will in turn fail to
 genuinely give their views and it will be very difficult to learn anything
 from them.   Comrade Mao Zedong said:   "My aspiration is to learn from the
 masses together with the comrades of the whole party and continue to be a
 pupil." (p 18)  Looking through the rural survey findings in "Writings," we
 can see that every chapter embodied the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's
 willingness to be a pupil.   In discussing his own experience of learning
 from the masses in rural surveys, Comrade Mao Zedong said:   "I must show

 without reserve." (p 16)  In every survey, he. always personally took notes,
 asked questions one by one and carried out discussions with people without
 the slightest inhibition.  His respectful and diligent as well as com-
 radely attitude of "asking questions and taking notes" left a lasting
 impression on the minds of the people interviewed.   The modest attitude of
 learning from the masses showed by Comrade Mao Zedong in the surveys is our
 best example and will always merit our emulation.
 In his "Circular of the General Political Department on the Census and Land
 Conditions," Comrade Mao Zedong proposed:  "Our slogan is: 1) No investiga-
 tion, no right to speak.   2) No correct investigation, likewise no right to
 speak."  This informs us that we must not only carry out investigation, but
 we must also carry out correct investigation.   If we carry out investiga-
 tion but not correct investigation, this will be like making no investiga-
 tion at all and the right to speak should be stopped.   From this, we can see
 the importance of whether correct investigation has been carried out or not.
 The correct investigation advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong is basically
 investigation carried out under the guidance of the basic concept of Marx-
 ism.  In carrying out social investigation in class society, we must use
 the method of class analysis.  This was the consistent advocation of Com-
 rade Mao Zedong.   In "Oppose Book Worship" he criticized the investigation
 mistakes of the Fourth Army because many people at that time did not know
 how to use the method of class analysis, and held that the result of the
 investigation.was as trivial as "a grocer's account."  He pointed out that
 ,the principal method of investigation is to dissect the classes in society,
 obtain a correct appraisal of the classes and formulate a correct tactic of
 struggle.   From an examination of the practice of investigation and study
 carried out by Comrade Mao Zedong, we will discover that the method of class
 analysis permeated the entire process of every one of his investigations and
 was reflected in every chapter he wrote.   The method of class analysis is
 the basic method of Marxism, and an effective weapon for carrying out cor-
 rect investigation in class society.
 Comrade Mao Zedong said:   "Conclusions invariably come after investigation
 and not before." (p 2)  This is an important premise as well as the minimum
 demand leading to correct investigation.   The method of sticking to an
 inherent preconceived idea and the mental "reference frame" to engage into
 investigation to find "evidence" for ourselves, is a bad subjective style
 that will not only deceive ourselves but also others.   Because this kind of
 bad subjective style is draped in the mantle of "investigation," it will be
 even more confusing, and therefore greatly jeopardize the cause of our party.
 Comrade Mao Zedong's rural survey findings informed us that the investiga-
 tion he had carried out was based on the given features of things, and that
 he had adopted an objective and scientific attitude regarding facts.  When
 he wrote about the pitiable plight of the peasants selling their children
 in the "Xinwu Survey," he said:   "All my investigations have been very care-
 fully conducted and I have not been excessive in my words.   I have always

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 suspected the truthfulness of the 'selling of wife and children' in the
 accounts of others, so I carefully asked the peasants of Xinwu this time
 whether or not such things happened?" (p 150)
 Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly stressed the need to carry out meticulous and
 thoroughgoing investigation and study.  Meticulous investigation means
 adopting a comprehensive attitude and carrying out systematic and historical
 investigation.  We must not only understand one side of a matter and prob-
 lem, but we must also understand the other side of a matter and problem.
 We not only must understand the history of a thing.   Looking at the sky from
 the bottom of a well, looking at a leopard through a bamboo tube and being
 satisfied with an isolated or one-sided view without being able to observe
 a thing in its entirely, we will not be able to find out about and solve
 the problem.   Thoroughgoing investigation means we must understand the true
 picture of a thing, find out about the essence of the thing and discover the
 law governing the thing.   If we only look at flowers while riding on horse-
 back, or like a dragonfly skimming the surface of the water, look at a thing
 from afar, we will only gain a superficial understanding through cursory
 observation, the findings collected will be sloppy and slapdash and the
 things we hear might be rumors and gossip.   Then this kind of investigation
 will only be a waste of time and effort.   In "Xinwu Survey," Comrade Mao
 Zedong said:   "Our study of urban problems is also like our study of rural
 problems.  We must concentrate on studying one place thoroughly."  "If we
 only look at flowers while riding on horseback, or, as certain comrade said
 '-drop in everywhere for a brief visit,' we will never be able to understand
 the problems in depth as long as we live." (p 56)
 Comrade Mao Zedong attached great importance to the detailed study of all
 available materials, but at the same time., he also laid emphasis on grasp-
 ing the main points.   "The more materials collected the better, but we must
 grasp the main point or characteristic (principal aspect of the contradic-
 tion)." (p 25)  Just as Comrade Mao Zedong said:   If there are 10 things
 and if you have investigated 9 of them, but if the 9 things you have
 investigated are only secondary things and you have cast away the principal
 thing, then you still have no right to speak.
 The objective world is constantly changing.   Investigation and study must
 be regularly and constantly carried out, and can never stop.  Man's
 knowledge of things must go through a process, and cannot be completed the
 first time.   Therefore, we must keep on making unremitting investigation
 and study.   Understanding the world is not an easy matter.  New things are
 constantly appearing and new problems are constantly emerging.   If investi-
 gation and study are not constantly maintained, man's knowledge will lag
 behind objective reality and the mind will gradually become ossified.
 Half a century has elapsed since the slogan of "No correct investigation,
 likewise no right to speak" made by Comrade Mao Zedong, but on reading it
 today we are still deeply touched.   It is still of guiding significance to
 our investigation and study.

 Investigation and study are important because they. are the central link
 integrating the universal principles of. Marxism-Leninism with the concrete
 practice of the Chinese revolution.  In other words, investigation and study
 are the bridge spanning theory and practice.  In the early days of our party,
 Comrade Mao Zedong attached great importance to investigation and study and
 to integrating the universal principles of Marxism-Leninism with the con-
 crete practice of the Chinese revolution.  He was the earliest of our party
 leaders to understand investigation and, study.   In the later part of the
 1920's and the early part of the 1930's there was a prevailing tendency
 within our party to dogmatize Marxism and to sanctify foreign experiences.
 Comrade Mao Zedong developed a school of his own, boldly and consciously
 advocated integrating Marxist principles with actual conditions in China
 and openly opposed book worship which divorced theory from reality.   By
 means of investigation and study, he thoroughly acquainted himself with the
 essence of Marxism and really mastered the stand, viewpoint and method of
 Marxism.   By means of investigation and study, he profoundly acquainted
 himself with conditions in China and correctly understood the law governing
 the Chinese revolution.   In the process of persistently carrying out
 unremitting investigation and study, he constantly pushed forward the great
 cause of integrating the universal principles of Marxism-Leninism with the
 concrete practice of the Chinese revolution.  He creatively developed
 Marxism-Leninism and founded Mao Zedong Thought, a guiding ideology of our
 party with Chinese characteristics suited to conditions in China, with him-
 self as the chief representative.   In a certain sense, investigation and
 study are the cornerstone for the formation and development of Mao Zedong
 Thought.
 The publication of "Writings" is of great important significance to our
 study and research of the practice and theory of Comrade Mao Zedong's
 investigation and study and to the study and research of Mao Zedong
 Thought as well as the history of the Chinese revolution.   Socialist mod-
 ernization is a brandnew subject.  Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism-
 Mao Zedong Thought, we must carry forward the fine tradition of investiga-
 tion and study initiated by Comrade Mao Zedong, keep on studying new con-
 ditions, solving new problems and creating new situations so as to pro-
 gressively achieve our grand goal and fulfill the arduous but glorious
 mission entrusted to us by history.

 HOW DO THE RURAL AREAS IN NORTHERN SICHUAN STAND UP AND BECOME RICH?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 pp 23-27
 [Article by Tan Qilong [6223 0796 7893]]
 [Text]  Editor's note:  This investigation report deals
 with the question of how the rural areas in northern
 Sichuan are to stand up and become rich.  Nevertheless,
 it touches at great length upon the universal questions
 of developing the economy in mountain areas, which the
 various localities can take as reference.   Ours is a
 country with numerous hills.  We have a lot of favor-
 able conditions in developing the economy in mountain
 areas.   The mountain areas are rich in natural resources
 and have great potential for production.  Speeding up
 the construction of mountain areas and changing the
 economic outlook of mountain areas is an important
 subject in rural work.   The various localities should
 emancipate the mind, use their brains and, on the
 basis of conscientiously conducting investigation and
 study, formulate an overall plan.  They should proceed
 from the actual situations in various localities,
 adjust measures to the local conditions, actively
 develop diversified undertakings and give full scope
 to the superiority of the mountain areas.   They should
 further implement the various policies of the party,
 mobilize the broad sections of cadres and masses, carry
 forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle
 and open up a new situation in the construction of
 mountain areas.
 Comrade Hu Yaobang once raised with me the question of how northern Sichuan
 can speedily stand up and become rich economically.  With this question in
 mind, I went on an inspection tour to 21 counties and cities in northern
 Sichuan.    My general impression was a sense of gratification mixed with
 anxiety.    I was glad because the situation was excellent, the people's minds
 were at rest, the way to abolish poverty had been found and there was every
 prospect to stand up and become rich.  I was anxious because our arable land
 was limited, we were short of grain and we faced a lot of difficulties in

 changing the situation which was characterized by destruction of forests in
 opening up land and a unitary operation.
 Geographically speaking, northern Sichuan can be divided into mountain
 areas and hilly lands.  The soil and weather in the hilly lands are suit-
 able for the growth of farm crops.  However, we have a huge population but
 limited land.  Forest cover is generally less than 10 percent and there is
 frequent drought.   The basic feature of the mountain areas is numerous hills
 and steep slopes with narrow valleys.  Arable lands are few and scattered.
 In addition, there are all sorts of natural disasters, particularly the
 threats of continuous heavy rain in autumn and low temperature.   For a long
 time, grain output has been low and unstable.   There are great limitations
 to agricultural development.  On the other hand, we have a vast territory,
 rich natural resources, ample rainfall and favorable conditions to develop
 forestry and animal husbandry.  In accordance with the different natural
 features and advantages, we should mainly engage in farming and all-round
 development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupation
 and fishery in the hilly lands.   In the mountain areas, however, we should
 resolutely implement the principle of "putting the development of forestry
 first, developing both agriculture and animal husbandry simultaneously and
 stimulating the all-round development of diversified undertakings."  Although
 there are certain differences in the principle of production, the common
 problem of developing the rural economy, in northern Sichuan is to cor-
 rectly handle the relationship between developing grain production and
 developing forestry and diversified undertakings.   In the light of the
 experience gained in a number of typical communes and brigades and after
 consulting on many occasions comrades from the prefectural and county CPC
 committees and some other grassroots levels, I think, in an effort to make
 the rural areas in northern Sichuan speedily stand up and become rich, it
 is necessary to solve the problems of forest destruction and the disruption
 of the ecological balance and thus remove the root of poverty; energetically
 develop diversified undertakings and thus plant the root of prosperity; and
 ensure the steady increase of grain output in order to gain a firm foothold.
 Protecting and Developing Forestry Is a Fundamental Policy for Getting Rid
 of Poverty in Northern Sichuan
 For a long time in the past, economic development has been slow in northern
 Sichuan.   The roots lie in the destruction of forests to open up land and
 the single development of grain production, which has resulted in a malig-
 nant circle economically and ecologically.  As a result of the movement of
 going in for steel in a big way in 1958 and the indiscriminate felling of
 trees as well as the practice of opening up land on steep slopes which has
 not completely stopped at present, forest resources in northern Sichuan have
 fallen drastically and the damage to vegetation is serious.   This has
 brought about serious consequences.  The first is frequent natural calami-
 ties in the mountain areas.  Little rainfall results in a drought and ample
 rainfall results in waterlogging.  The layer of soil has become thinner with
 erosion.   Grain production remains at a low level and the output of many
 forest, sideline, local and special products has also fallen by a great
 margin.  We are still unable to restore their production to the highest

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 historical level.  The second is the loss of water and erosion of soil,
 which has brought disaster to the lower reaches.  The Fujiang, Tuojiang
 and Jialingjing Rivers, the main tributaries of the Changjiang River
 originating from the mountain areas in northern Sichuan, wash away as much
 as 250 million tons of mud and sand every year.  If there is torrential rain
 in the upper reaches, it will result in flood and in exceptionally great
 flood peaks and flow in the mainstream.   The exceptionally great flood in
 1981 was precisely caused by this.   It can be said that the lack of forests
 in the mountains has resulted in the loss of soil and sand and that the root
 cause of floods in the basin lies in the upper reaches of the rivers.   If
 we fail to change the ecological imbalance, not only will it be impossible
 for northern Sichuan to become rich, it will still continuously suffer at
 the hands of nature.   Therefore, it is imperative to regard the development
 of forestry as a primary factor by which northern Sichuan will stand up and
 become rich.  We should adopt decisive measures and adhere to them
 unswervingly.
 There are many favorable conditions for developing forestry in northern
 Sichuan.   It has a vast area suitable for growing trees, and rainfall and
 weather are both moderate.  So long as we close off the hillsides, the
 forests will grow.   Some localities, such as Nanjiang and Jiange Counties
 and the Baisha industrial and agricultural district, closed off the hill-
 sides 7-8 years ago and the pine forest on the hillsides is now ready for
 selective cutting.   In Guangyuan County, the 400,000 mu of land afforested
 by aerial sowing has now grown into green forest.   In recent years, success-
 ful experience has been gained in the artificial planting of fast growing
 and highly productive commercial forests.   In developing forestry, we should
 adjust measures according to the local conditions.  We should develop com-
 mercial forests to a greater extent in remote mountains and hills.  Nearby
 hills are suitable for planting economic forests.   Bazhong County's Huacong
 District, which is situated in remote hills, has succeeded in planting more
 than 2,000 mu of forests.   There, the hilltops are green, trees grow
 between the terrace fields and the forests in the deep ravines are denser.
 This method of afforestation does not occupy grain land.   It can conserve
 water and soil and regulate weather.   In hilly counties such as Nanchong
 and Pengan, they plant a lot of economic forests, such as tangerine and
 mulberry trees, along roads and rivers and around villages and houses as
 well as on barren hilltops.   This can yield good and quick results and act
 as farm shelter-forest.  Whether in closing off the hillsides to facilitate
 afforestation or planting trees, it is necessary to strengthen management,
 consolidate and stabilize the right over the hills and forests and consoli-
 date the achievements of the forestry responsibility system.  With respect
 to acts in violation of the forest law and village code, it is necessary to
 adopt strict disciplinary measures.   In afforestation, we should promptly
 grasp the raising of seedlings and pay attention to science, such as the
 right trees in the right places, selection of improved varieties and the
 cultivation of mixed forests.   So long as we pay attention to the four
 measures, namely closing hillsides, afforestation, planting trees and
 strengthening management, and adhere to them for 5-10 years,'forestry in
 northern Sichuan will present a new outlook.

 Energetically Developing Diversified Undertakings Constitutes a Major
 Channel by Which Northern Sichuan Becomes Rich
 Northern Sichuan has little cultivated land on a per capita basis and can
 provide little commodity grain.  However, it has favorable conditions to
 develop diversified undertakings.  It is therefore necessary to go in for
 diversified undertakings in a big way on the basis of steady growth in
 grain production.
 Diversified undertakings in the hilly land of northern Sichuan consist
 chiefly of the following:  mulberry, fruit, paulownia, bamboo, hemp, oil,
 pigs, birds and fish.  Northern Sichuan has a predominant position particu-
 larly in mulberry, tangerine and paulownia nuts.   In Longcan commune,
 Pengan County, mulberry trees have been extensively planted along the paths
 leading to the fields and on hilltops.   The commune has an average of 207
 trees for each person.   The year before last, each household raised an
 average of 1.82 pieces of silkworms [refers to pieces of paper with silk-
 worm eggs on them] with an average income of 47.8 yuan from cocoons for
 each person.   In the No 6 production team of the No 13 production brigade,
 Qingxi commune, Pengan County, the 50 households only have 50 mu of grain
 fields.   The team gathers 600,000 jin of red tangerines each year, account-
 ing for 94.8 percent of the total income from agricultural and sideline
 occupation.   The per capita distributed income in this commune is 366 yuan.
 There are broader channels for diversified undertakings in the mountain
 areas.   Developing forests, bamboo, dried fruit, paulownia nuts, tea,
 medicinal materials, edible fungus, tremella, day lily, cattle-raising,
 goat-raising and mineral products can make people rich.   Over the past
 decade and more, the Liulinpo production team in Yudai commune, Wanyuan
 County, has afforested 2,000 mu of land by planting 7,000 fruit and
 paulownia trees.   Their per capita distributed income the year before last
 was 301 yuan of which 104 yuan was income from forestry.   The Dashuba pro-
 duction team in Hongxing commune, Nanjiang County, has taken advantage of
 the ample grass slopes to raise an average of 2.9 cows, 5 goats and 5.6 pigs
 per household.   Income from animal husbandry alone amounts to an average of
 102 yuan for each person.  Anchang production brigade in Changgui commune,
 Pingwu County, mined 31.9 taels of gold in the first quarter of last year.
 This income accounted for 185 yuan for each household, an average of 39 yuan
 for each person.  Moreover, there are great prospects for developing weaving,
 wine making, building materials and the processing of farm produce.   So long
 as the various communes and brigades proceed from their own peculiarities
 and engage in one or two key items for 3, 5 or 10 years, they will be able
 to become rich.
 In developing diversified undertakings, it is necessary to combine long-term
 plans with short-term. ones by using the latter to support the former.   It
 is necessary to give scope to our superiority and give prominence to the
 key points.   Some lines yield quick results and others have long production
 cycles.   Only by combining both of them will it be possible to develop them
 on our own efforts and open up more channels toward prosperity.   Guangyuan,
 Wangcang and Wanyuan Counties plan to greatly develop the production of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 poultry, eggs, milk, vegetables, fruit, flowers, plants and handicraft
 articles in order to meet the needs of people in industrial and mining
 areas and in cities and increase the income of the peasants.  At the same
 time, in light of the new demands of the peasants following the increases
 in their income, they develop the production of building materials, con-
 tract the construction of peasant houses and develop service trades in
 order to meet the needs of peasants in their livelihood.
 In developing diversified undertakings, it is necessary to bring into full
 play the initiative of both the collective and the individual.   In recent
 years, household sideline production has developed fairly speedily.   Income
 from this source accounts for 40-50 percent of the total income of the
 peasants and there is still a great potential for further development.  At
 present, over 80 percent of the production teams in northern Sichuan have
 instituted the "double-contract" system.  After the land is contracted,
 there is generally about 30 percent of surplus labor in the production
 teams.  We should find a way out for this through diversified undertakings.
 In the future, with the further implementation of the system of contracted
 responsibilities with payment linked to output and the development of com-
 modity production in the rural areas, there will be more labor force
 shifting to specialized production and the rural economy will gradually
 develop in the direction of specialization and mass production.   Therefore,
 it is necessary to attach importance to and support the various specialized
 households and households doing specialized jobs which have emerged in the
 rural areas, and promote various forms of joint operations and management
 so that those who have operational and technical skills can give full play
 to their talents.
 Diversified undertakings basically deal in commodity production.   It is
 necessary to solve the problems of circulation, processing, transport and
 storage.   Dazhu County has gained some experiences in this respect.   The
 financial and commercial departments of that county have made great efforts
 to help develop production.  At the same time, they have also tried by
 every possible means to push the sale of farm produce and sideline products.
 The supply and marketing cooperatives have developed various joint manage-
 ments by expanding the shares and revising the system.   In addition to the
 agricultural-commercial business joint management, they have also engaged
 in joint production with 48 orchards and in joint production, processing
 and sales of mushrooms with 739 production teams and 1 tin factory.  Along
 with banks, food companies, veterinary stations and the foreign trade
 department, they have also signed multilateral contracts with specialized
 households and households specializing in raising cattle, chickens and
 rabbits and supported them with funds,-fodder and the sale of produce.
 When engaging in processing trades, it ds gecessary to take the road of
 joint operation and break the bounds of different trades, ownership and
 administrative areas.   We should not build duplicate factories in every
 locality.   The Bazhong Tin Factory has developed the production of
 tomatoes, asparagus, mushrooms and green sword beans by setting up bases of
 raw materials production in the rural areas of Bazhong County as well as in
 Pingchang, Yilong and Cangxi Counties.   In lyear, the rural communes, pro-
 duction brigades and teams in Bazhong County have increased their income by
 4 million yuan.

 Ensuring the Steady Growth of Grain Production Constitutes a Fundamental
 Condition for Developing Forestry and Diversified Undertakings and Enabling
 Northern Sichuan To Get Prosperous
 In readjusting the internal structure of agriculture and speeding up the
 development of forestry and diversified undertakings, we base ourselves on
 the steady growth of grain production.  Due to grain shortage in some
 localities, the phenomenon of destroying forests to open up land has not
 been completely stopped and diversified undertakings have failed to make
 any headway.  Most counties in northern Sichuan have increased their grain
 production in recent years.   The peasants have basically enough food to eat.
 However, after fulfilling the quotas for the state purchase and extra pur-
 chase, the average amount of grain for each person and the grain ration
 distributed from the collective are still lower than the average level in
 the province.   In the hilly land of northern Sichuan, it is necessary to
 stabilize the area sown to grain and strive to raise per-unit output.   In
 developing diversified undertakings, it is necessary to refrain from
 occupying, or strive to occupy less, grain fields.  We should develop
 diversified undertakings along roads and rivers, around villages and houses
 and in the slopes and water fronts or develop specialized items which do not
 occupy cultivated land.   In making contributions to the state, the mountain
 areas should chiefly provide more and better forest, animal, local and
 special products but not in grain.  However, when these localities do not
 have a high grain production level and there is a transportation problem,
 they should not rely on importing grain to solve their food problem.
 Therefore, the counties situated in the mountain areas of northern Sichuan
 should strive to be more than self-sufficient in grain and make up for a
 crop failure with a bumper harvest and, on this basis, gradually readjust
 crop arrangements by planting trees and growing grass on the steep slopes
 which are not suitable for growing grain.
 In order to ensure a steady growth in grain production, it is imperative to
 tackle key scientific problems, do a good job of scientific farming and
 devote a lot of time and energy to the improvement of per-unit yield.   In
 Qingchuan and Pingwu Counties which are situated in a mountainous area,
 the average wheat output is less-than 200 jin per mu, corn output is less
 than 300 jin and rice output is a little over 500 jin.   In Yuechi and
 Nanchong Counties which lie in a hilly area, the average rice output is
 only a little over 600 jin per mu, about 300 jin less than Pengxi and
 Lezhi Counties in central Sichuan.  However, there are also models which
 achieved a high yield over a large area.  For example, rice output in
 Dazhu County is 805 jin per mu and corn output in Guangan County is 800 jin
 per mu.   This shows that there is still a great potential to increase grain
 production.   Their chief experience in increasing per-unit yield in the
 hilly area is to actively disseminate improved varieties, reform the farm-
 ing system and cultivation techniques and, where there are water facilities,
 transform winter paddy field and raise the multiple crop index.   Their
 experience in increasing per-unit yield in the mountain area is to adopt,
 in light of local specific and natural conditions, measures for utilizing
 the favorable and avoiding the unfavorable conditions in an effort to
 increase production; cultivate and promote crop varieties which-are

 resistant to low temperature and drought, mature early and are highly pro-
 ductive; improve the combination of varieties; and base ourselves on over-
 coming autumn frost, low temperature and other disasters.  While applying
 the scientific and technological achievements in modern agriculture, it is
 necessary to pay attention to integrating the utilization with maintenance
 of land by intensive cultivation, frequent application of organic ferti-
 lizer and soil improvement.  We should not discard the valuable experience
 of our traditional farming techniques.
 In order to raise grain production levels in mountain areas, it is impera-
 tive to change the practice of opening up land everywhere and that of
 extensive growing for a meager harvest.   It is necessary to concentrate
 our energy on cultivating the basic land, such as the flat land in the
 river valleys and the land at a slope of less than 25 degrees, and strive
 to achieve high and stable yields.   It is necessary to engage in farm land
 capital construction in a planned way, improve irrigation facilities and
 make the layer of cultivated soil thicker.  Some slope land can be trans-
 formed into terraced land.  In this way, we can markedly increase per-unit
 yield.   Under the existing conditions, it is impossible to stop cultivating
 land with a slope of over 25 degrees.   However, it is necessary to stop
 cultivating land which yields only a score or a hundred jin per mu but
 which brings about ecological imbalance.   This is a practice in which we
 lose more than we gain.  We should therefore plant trees and grow grass on
 the land.   Some peasants also note the advantages of this practice.   In
 Shanguoshi commune, Qingchuan County, a militia company commander made a
 contract for 7.5 mu of cultivated land.   He put in a lot of time on increas-
 ing the per-unit yield in the 5 mu of flat land and succeeded in gathering
 590 jin of wheat per mu. He planted trees and grew grass on the other 2.5
 mu of slope land.   The experiment of growing rye grass on the slope has been
 successful in that county.  The grass can be harvested three times a year
 with a per-mu yield of more than 20,000 jin.  The grass can be used to feed
 cattle.   Its annual output value is more than 300 yuan, much more worth-
 while than growing grain.                     Naturally, this readjustment can be gradually
 and specifically arranged according to the population in various localities,
 the degree of self-sufficiency in grain and the land area suitable for
 farming.   We should not act with undue haste.
 Adopting Correct and Vigorous Policies and Measures Ensures the Speedy
 Development of the Rural Economy in Northern Sichuan
 To speed up the rural economic development in northern Sichuan, in addition
 to conscientiously implementing and continuously carrying out the existing
 policies, we should also further study and solve some problems.
 1.   It is necessary to' appropriately expand investment in forestry.
 Since the founding of the PRC, the state has invested a lot of money on
 water conservancy construction, particularly on the construction of
 reservoirs.   However, investment in forestry has been next to nothing.'
 From 1950 to 1980, total investment on agricultural capital construction
 in our province came to 3,179 million yuan.  Of this, investment on water

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 conservancy projects came to 2,485 million yuan, accounting for 78.2 per-
 cent of the total investment, while investment in forestry construction
 came to only 97.11 million yuan, accounting for only 3 percent of the total
 investment. In 1981, the construction fund for water conservation was
 reduced to some extent and the fund for forestry construction was increased
 to some extent, but the latter accounted for only some 10 percent of the
 former.  Our experience and lessons over the years have taught us that, in
 dealing with floods and droughts, it is impossible to solve the problems
 once and for all by paying attention only to engineering measures without
 paying attention to biological measures of protecting the ecological bal-
 ance, such as planting trees and growing grass.  This will also result in
 serious soil erosion and the silting up of ponds and reservoirs, which
 causes a great waste.   For this reason, it is necessary for the state and
 localities to appropriately expand their investment on forestry.  In 1981,
 our province set up a forestry development fund system, which allocates
 several million yuan annually as subsidies for planting several hundred
 thousand mu of fast growing and highly productive forests.   Our province
 is situated in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River.   The serious
 situation of excessive felling of forests for many years in the past and
 the drastic reduction of forest cover has made it necessary to list the
 building of a shelter-forest in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River
 as a key construction project of the state.
 2.   It is necessary to further relax some rural policies, particularly the
 policies on mountain areas.
 Experience has told us that appropriate relaxation of policies can speedily
 increase social wealth.   Those barren hills and slopes which are unsuitable
 for the collectives to manage can be assigned to a greater extent to com-
 mune members as private or responsibility hills for planting trees.  Where
 conditions permit, we can give commune members a free hand in breeding
 cattle and goats.  We should energetically encourage commune members to
 develop small orchards and mulberry and tea gardens and to plant other
 economic forests in front of and behind their houses, in private plots and
 hills and in places designated by production teams.  The income derived
 from this belongs to the commune members themselves.  A retired disabled
 serviceman in Changxing commune, Tongjiang County, planted 120 pear, apple
 and tangerine trees in his family orchard.   He had an income of more than
 400 yuan last year.   There is nothing wrong in encouraging the peasants to
 speedily become rich by this method!
 3.  We should engage in essential construction through fund raising and
 joint ventures.
 Many comrades from the prefectures and counties said that the mountain areas
 are rich in natural resources and they will speedily stand up if communica-
 tions, small power stations and processing trades are developed.  At present,
 the state should appropriately concentrate funds on key construction pro-
 jects.  This is where our overall interests lie.   Under the guidance of
 state planning, the various localities should primarily rely on their own
 efforts in essential construction.  We should promote, on a voluntary and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 mutually beneficial basis, various forms of fund raising and joint ventures
 by breaking down the barriers between different regions and trades and
 between various forms of ownership.  We especially encourage Chengdu,
 Chongqing and economically developed counties as well as state enterprises
 with the necessary conditions to adopt various methods, such as economic
 combination and technological cooperation, to help counties in the mountain
 area and a small number of areas inhabited by the minority nationalities
 develop processing trades and engage in the primary processing and compre-
 hensive utilization of products.
 4.  Speed up the structural reform of secondary education by turning some
 ordinary middle schools into secondary vocational ones.
 The unitary structure of the existing secondary education is quite
 irrational.  After inspecting various localities in northern Sichuan, I
 felt all the more the seriousness of the problem.   The teaching in junior
 and senior middle schools in the rural areas centers around the objective
 of training students for university.   However, very few students can enter
 universities.  A large number of students have to take part in agricul-
 tural labor after graduation, but they do not learn professional knowledge
 and skills at schools.   On the other hand, with the development of produc-
 tion, the rural areas urgently need technical personnel with specialized
 knowledge.   For example, it is necessary to run a silkworm and mulberry
 school and a horticultural (orange) school in Nanchong Prefecture which
 is abound in tangerine, silkworms and mulberry.  After making some experi-
 ments and preparations, the various counties in the interior of the
 province can turn an ordinary middle school.into a secondary vocational
 school (practicing the principle of from the commune, to the commune with-
 out undertaking assignments of jobs) and ordinary middle schools can offer
 vocational and technical courses in senior classes.  After the ordinary
 middle schools have been turned into secondary vocational schools, their
 sources of outlay remain unchanged with the educational departments being
 responsible for unified management and assigning more teachers to
 Specialized fields.  The relevant departments should support them.
 5.  We should continuously implement the policy of reducing the grain
 burden of counties in the mountain area and give them more initiative in
 grain and finance.
 In order to implement the principle of production in the mountain area and
 help poor production teams and areas inhabited by the minority nationali-
 ties rehabilitate and develop production, the provincial CPC committee
 decided in 1980 to allocate 395 million jin of grain as a subsidy and
 reduce the grain burden of some production teams which were short of grain
 for many years.   This has promoted forestry, animal husbandry and the con-
 struction of bases for diversified undertakings and yielded very good
 results.   The policy was originally fixed to be valid for 3 years.   In
 accordance with the requests from various localities, it should be further
 implemented and will ,,remain unchanged until 1990.   In order to give counties
 in the mountain area more initiative in grain problems and thus facilitate
 the readjustment of agricultural structure, we can adopt the method of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 Gulin County by fixing grain output for counties in the mountain area.   In
 accordance with the existing differences in purchase and sale, some coun-
 ties can be given fixed subsidies, some can turn over fixed'quantities of
 grain to the state and some can keep their balance through their own
 efforts. This policy should absolutely remain unchanged for a few years.
 At the same time, with respect to some counties in the mountain area which
 have been unable to make ends meet. for years running, we can experiment in
 the method of fixed financial subsidies in order to speed up the economic
 development of the mountain area.
 In the current investigation, I visited scores of advanced communes and
 production brigades which had their own peculiarities in building material
 and socialist spiritual civilization.  All of them have something in com-
 mon, that is, they have a realistic plan and a good leading body.  This
 shows that in order to stand up and become rich, the rural areas in
 northern Sichuan should have correct principles and policies.  They should
 also formulate plans and consolidate the leading bodies.  Only in this way
 will it be possible for the broad sections of cadres and masses to have
 a clear-cut objective of struggle and the spirit of rousing themselves and
 thus speed up the building of material and socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion.

 IN NO WAY SHOULD THE CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION FRONT BE BLINDLY OVEREXTENDED
 ANYMORE!
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 pp 28-30
 [Article by Jing Ping [2529 1627]]
 [Text] Economic life in our country today has one problem well worth con-
 sideration, and that is that since the rational readjustments and cutbacks
 in the capital construction front during the last several years, there
 emerged last year a tendency of blind overextension.   The overall scale of
 investments in fixed assets last year surpassed all previous records and
 surpassed national plans by a relatively large extent.  Some regions added
 on additional projects to those already included in the plans of which a
 large number were processing industries.   In addition, a fairly large
 proportion of investments earmarked in state plans for use in renovation
 of enterprise equipment and technical transformations was in fact used for
 capital construction.   If this situation is allowed to continue unabated
 and without restrictions, then the scale of investments may actually exceed
 the limits permitted by the state's capacity with the result that the bal-
 ance of the national economy would once again be destroyed, thus presenting
 problems for future development.
 Some comrades react in such a way that as soon as they talk of the struggle
 for achieving the tactical target of quadrupling total production output of
 industry and agriculture by the year 2000, they immediately start to fran-
 tically add new construction projects, extending the sphere of essential
 construction and increasing new productive forces.   Such eagerness is
 totally understandable but  we cannot carry out our work on the basis of
 subjective wishes.   Instead we must base our work on the objective present
 situation in China and thus work in a planned and regular way.  We must
 strive for real economic results.
 Today, the level of national revenue in, China is low.   The many years under
 the influence of "leftist" erroneous thinking created low economic results
 and efficiency and this situation has as yet still not been essentially
 changed.  After the great successes achieved in readjustments to the pro-
 portions between agriculture, light industry and heavy industry, the
 internal economic structure of industry still illustrates some irrational
 areas and still needs further readjustments.   Restructuring of the economic

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 system of management has only just begun, and thus there are still serious
 problems of disorder in enterprise management, also needing speedy reorgani-
 zation.                        Other factors such as energy and communications shortages, outdated
 equipment in enterprises and backward technology have also meant that the
 present and future development for several years to come of the national
 economy is being hit by severe restrictions.  Working on the basis of an
 objective look at China's present situation, the 12th National Congress of
 the CPC has ruled that in the last 20 years of this century we must divide
 our development into two different stages.   Before entering a new period of
 economic prosperity we must undergo a 10-year period of preparation, during
 which time we can establish firmer foundations, gather together our strength
 and set up necessary conditions.   The Sixth 5-Year Plan places great empha-
 sis on improving economic results and stresses that we should not force
 ourselves to go all out for an unrealistically high speed of development.
 Thus, today we must put our hearts and souls into struggling to achieve the
 20-year tactical targets, and of primary importance are our concerted
 efforts to establish firm foundations followed by further implementation of
 readjustment, restructuring, reorganization and upgrading measures.   In
 addition, we must actively strive to improve and perfect management and
 administration, promote technological advances and use every way possible
 to raise the economic results of existing enterprises.  However, we must on
 no account eagerly but blindly overextend the sphere of essential construc-
 tion by setting up new projects.  Whether or not we can seek out limited
 funds for investment in fixed assets depends on planned and centralized
 utilization of the funds with larger amount being used for more important
 projects so that we may use the funds to establish firm foundations in the
 most needy areas.  This includes mainly emphasizing construction projects
 related to energy, communications and renovation of equipment in existing
 enterprises and technological transformations.
 The solution to problems of energy and transport shortages obviously lies
 to a very large extent in improving and perfecting management and in
 improving technology so that considerable savings in energy may be made, and
 in improving efficiency rates in transportation.  What is more, the poten-
 tial in this area is in fact enormous.   If we do not now begin to implement
 planned and emphasized essential construction so that in the next few years
 we may see continuous increases-in energy production capacity and transpor-
 tation capacity, then we will not be able to fundamentally solve contradic-
 tions between supply and demand of energy to be found in the further
 development of the national economy, nor contradictions between transporta-
 tion capacity and growth in transportation needs.   Similarly, if we do not
 now start to implement planned and emphasized renovation of equipment in
 existing enterprises as well as technical transformations, but continue to
 allow a situation to drag on in which enterprises are equipped with out-
 dated machinery and technology is backward, then there is no chance of a
 fundamental change in low levels of economic efficiency and results.
 While collectively using investment in fixed assets in these two main areas,
 we must restrict their use in other areas, in particular    in construction
 of processing industries not included in state planning.   In general, it
 seems that programs in the processing industry are worthwhile, especially

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 those involving small enterprises where investment for essential construc-
 tion is small, construction periods short, results quicker than in major
 construction programs involving energy or communications.  But, this is
 only taking a partial look at the situation.   The problems only become clear
 when we look at it in an all-round, comprehensive way.   The problems facing
 our processing industries are:  In some cases production capacity has
 already produced a glut (tobacco and alcohol), in some cases production
 capacity is restricted by short supplies of energy, transportation and raw
 materials so that they do not see full expression, in some cases there is
 an urgent need for technical transformations and improvements in economic
 efficiency and results.  Thus, from an overall point of view, essential
 construction programs in the processing industries should not be consid-
 ered as the most pressing matters of the moment and if work in this area
 is cut down a little bit it will not greatly affect the general situation,
 unlike construction work on energy and transportation and renovation of
 enterprise equipment and technical transformation, where if work is not
 carried out now, enormous damages will be incurred for a long time in the
 future which will prove difficult to put right.   If we do not make a dis-
 tinction between important and less important programs, and if we blindly
 overextend the scale of essential construction then our precious and
 Limited funds will be spread too thinly,, resulting in important construc-
 tion programs dragging on for long periods of time due to lack of financial
 and material guarantees, thus using up financing over a much longer period
 of time instead of being turned into production capacity.  And even if they
 do have potential production capacity, shortages of energy and raw materials
 may still prevent production, thus creating new damage.
 One response to this is,'well, I have raised my own funds and am not using
 state investments, so I can personally solve problems of supplies of build-
 ing materials and energy, therefore why can I not add on a few more
 processing industry programs that are needed in certain areas, in addition
 to the state plans?  Such an attitude reflects a lack of all-round apprecia-
 tion of the situation.   The socialist national economy is an organic whole
 and funds personally raised by a region, a department or an enterprise are
 also the funds of socialist construction.   If limited funds, energy and raw
 materials are overused here, then they will be underused in other areas.
 If too much funding is used in construction programs related to the
 processing industries outside state planning, then this will only aggravate
 shortages in supplies of energy, raw materials and communications and
 transportation and putting the squeeze on essential construction projects
 and technical transformations of a much more urgent and vital nature within
 the state plans or, alternatively, putting pressure on maintenance and
 upkeep of existing production and equipment and the needs of the people's
 welfare.   Under a situation of such imbalance, how would it be possible to
 continue implementing the principles of readjustment, restructuring, upgrad-
 ing and reorganization?  Working in this way can only obstruct the healthy
 development of the national economy focusing on improvements in economic
 efficiency.
 Since the founding of the People's Republic, the Chinese people have
 suffered more than once from the effects of dislocations in the national

 economy as a result of overextension of capital construction fronts.  In
 the last 2  years we have begun to feel.the relief produced by readjust-
 ments to proportions in the national economy.  Blind overextension of
 capital construction fronts, dislocations in the.national economy, setbacks,
 suffering, cutbacks on the scale of capital investment, readjustments to
 proportional relations, smooth development, relief, blind overextension of
 the scale of capital construction again...  This vicious circle causes great
 damage to the national economy.   The scar has healed so we have forgotten the
 pain, but have we forgotten our lesson too?
 Only if we firmly establish a way of thinking which reflects the concept of
 the country as a game of chess can we successfully solve the problems of
 limiting the scale of investments in fixed assets and correcting the areas
 of their application.  Things which seem profitable and feasible from one
 angle should be put on a more objective set of scales to see whether in
 fact they are a good idea.   If they are, then they should be implemented.
 If they are not, then they should on no account be implemented.  This is the
 objective demand put on every angle of the socialist publicly owned economy
 by itself.  It is also the correct attitude that leading cadres of every
 level should adopt.   If everyone works in this way, then as overall develop-
 ment takes place, there are even greater guarantees that each individual
 angle will also develop.  This is in fact exactly what Comrade Chen Yun
 said recently, "Only by successfully carrying out major revolutions and
 major construction work in the country can we ensure the realization of
 every small revolution and all small construction work."  If any work is
 carried out based on partial and uneven observation and one-sided interests,
 not only will it serve no interest to the overall situation, it will also in
 the long run be of no interest to the originally small part.   For in a
 unified socialist economy, things which are of no interest to the overall
 situation never come to anything.
 We must strengthen the concept of planning and underline the earnestness of
 state planning.   Proportional and planned development is the basic nature
 and inherent advantage of the socialist economy.  Expressing regional,
 departmental and enterprise enthusiasm must be integrated with submission
 to unified state planning.  We must inject life into the economy but, just
 as Comrade Chen Yun recently pointed out, "Injecting life into the economy
 must be done under planned guidance and should not be done independently of
 planning guidance."  The shortcomings that exist in the planning management
 system are at this moment being tackled with restructuring work, and progress
 has already been made in overcoming problems in such areas as excessive
 centralization of management powers.   Such work is very positive.  Neverthe-
 less, tendencies which undermine and destroy unified state planning have
 in fact been on the increase.  This is one of the reasons for blind over-
 extension of the scale of capital construction.   In order to ensure that the
 scale of investments in fixed assets does not exceed the load that the coun-
 try can actually bear and to ensure that such investments are used in such
 a way as to meet the demands of the development of the national economy, we
 must strengthen and improve unified state planning.   In his report relating
 to the Sixth 5-Year Plan, Premier Zhao Ziyang announced relevant State Coun-
 cil regulations which bear heavily on this subject and every region,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100450001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 department and work unit should strictly conform with and carry out these
 regulations.  All investments in fixed assets, regardless of whether they
 are included in state estimates, are privately and individually raised funds
 or bank loans, must all be entered into the unified state plans and may not
 transgress the plans without authority.   Capital construction programs must
 all, in accordance with regulations, be ratified by the relevant state
 bodies and no work unit or individual has the authority to approve or
 decide on a construction program.  Investments in capital construction
 should be organized together by the Construction Bank and the use to which
 the investments are put should be watched and checked according to planning
 by the bank.  All construction programs must be carried out strictly in
 accordance with the rules and regulations of capital construction, with
 thorough preconstruction feasibility studies and technological back-up as
 well as good surveying and design before construction goes ahead.  Making
 decisions too lightly, over-hasty actions, insufficient surveying, insuffi-
 cient design work, insufficient construction work, endless delays and exten-
 sions of construction deadlines, limitless additions to investment costs and
 lack of responsibility cannot be allowed to continue.   We must also restruc-
 ture rules and regulations which adversely affect the implementation of
 equipment renovation and technical transformations in enterprise, as well
 as adopting economic measures to motivate enterprise enthusiasm in carrying
 out technical transformation.
 We believe that if everyone comes to understand and appreciate that we must
 work on the basis of objective assessment of the actual situation, an over-
 all, inclusive view of the situation, aiming at raising economic results
 throughout the entire national economy, while strengthening our awareness
 of the need to submit to unified state planning, then we will without doubt
 be able to quickly put a stop to this tendency of blindly overextending
 capital investment fronts.   Thus, we will be able to gather together and
 use in important construction programs and technical transformations our
 limited investments in fixed assets, thereby laying a solid foundation for
 future, healthier development of the national economy.

 A BOATMAN AND A PHILOSOPHER
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 p 30
 [Article by Qi Hua [0796 5478]]
 [Text]  Marx told his daughter a "short and world-wise Arabian fable."  It
 reads:, "Once there was a boatman who got ready to steer a boat in a river
 torrent, on which there was a philosopher who wanted to go to the other side
 of the river.   Consequently, there transpired the following dialogue:
 Philosopher:  Boatman, do you know history?  Boatman:   I don't!  Philosopher:
 Then you have lost half of your life!   The philosopher again asked:  Have
 you ever studied mathematics?  Boatman:   I haven't!   Philosopher:  Then you
 have lost more than half of your life!   The moment the philosopher finished
 speaking, the wind blew and overturned the boat.   Both the philosopher and
 boatman were thrown into the river.  Accordingly, the boatman cried out:
 Can you swim?  Philosopher:  I can't!   Boatman:  Then you are bound to lose
 the whole of your life!"
 Marx vividly expressed his view on the relationship between science and
 reality with this minor fable.   He held that any science which cannot solve
 practical problems is useless and any person, no matter how great he is and
 how profound the knowledge he possesses, who can only indulge in exaggera-
 tion in a manner being divorced from practice and who fails to take root in
 the soil of reality in an earnest, down-to-earth and firm manner is doomed
 to 100 percent failure.

 THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE FOR GENETICS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan.83.pp 31-35
 [Article by Tan Jiazhen [6151 1367 2823]]
 [Text] Heredity and variation are the basic nature of life, they are
 natural phenomena that appeared simultaneously with the appearance of the
 .world of living things.   For a very long period, mankind has intentionally
 or not been probing into the mystery of, heredity.   But it was not until 1865
 when Mendel published his book "Experiments on Plant Hybridization" that the
 basic law of heredity began to be exposed.   Since then, the study of heredity
 began to be included in science to form a strict branch of natural science--
 genetics.
 During a period of more than 10 decades, genetics has experienced the
 development stages of classic genetics, cell genetics and molecular
 genetics.  At the present stage, more definite answers have been made with
 regard to some basic questions about genetics, such as the material founda-
 tion for heredity and variation and heredity features of how embryos change
 into complete bodies according to a certain sequence of time and space.  And
 on this understanding, people have actively reformed the features of some
 living things so that these things will serve certain goals of mankind.
 The Basic Principles of Genetics
 There is no movement in the world that departs from substance.  Life is the
 high form of the movement of substance, heredity is a basic nature of life
 and therefore heredity naturally has its own material foundation and this
 material foundation is termed as chemical molecules of DNA.   It has been
 proven that the fragment of DNA constitutes the basic unit of heredity--the
 gene.   Gene genetics represent a theoretical system for explaining heredity
 and variation from the point of the structure and variation of genes.
 People's understanding of the character of genes has developed deeper and
 deeper from the macroscopic to the microscopic level and yet continuous
 effort is being made to completely probe into the character of genes.
 Peas have either white flowers or red flowers while the peas themselves are
 either plump or shrunken.  After 8 years of experiments, Mendel found that
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 hybridization between the peas with white flowers. with those with red
 flowers resulted in peas with red flowers.  But when the new species are
 self-pollinated, they will bring about a new generation with white flowers.
 He was enlightened by this phenomenon and he pointed out that such a macro-
 scopic character of a living substance is determined by a suppositive hered-
 ity gene (it is now termed as the gene with concrete substance).  A heredity
 gene exists in twin within a cell but singly in generative cell and when the
 two sexes of generative cells are combined, heredity genes will become
 double again.   In addition to heredity genes there is also dominant gene
 and a single dominant gene which enables a living substance to show the
 character that is decided by itself such as producing red flowers.  Domi-
 nant genes will be able to show the character they decide such as producing
 white flowers only when they appear in pairs.  If we used "A" to represent
 the gene that is producing red flowers and "a" to represent the gene that is
 producing white flowers, the first generation of hybridization should be Aa
 and therefore the genes are still producing red flowers.  But when Aa is
 having self-pollination, male and female generative cells will respectively
 have two types of "A" and "a" and these two types have four combinations of
 AA, Aa, aA and aa.   The former three combinations produce red flowers and
 the last one produces white flowers, with a proportion of three to one.
 The work carried out by Mendel has opened up the correct way for exposing
 the law of heredity by starting from the study of the nature of gene.   This
 discovery shows that the gene is not an abstract symbol, it is a substance
 that really exists and it can be used as a target for experiment and study.
 For the majority of living substances, the only mutual relations between
 former and latter generations is generative cell. Therefore, it is no doubt
 that the gene is passed down through the generative cell.   The nucleus of
 the male and female generative cells are limited in size and the size of
 cytoplasm differs very much from each other.   For example, the human ovum
 is 60,000 times bigger than human sperm.   But parents have the same role of
 deciding the heredity features of their children.  And this situation shows
 that nuclei are the main carrying bodies of the genes.   But it does not mean
 that there is no possibility of the existence of.few genes inside the outer
 cells of the nucleus.
 In what part of the nucleus does the gene exist?  Early this century, people
 found that cells carry out meiosis to form generative cells and as a result,
 there appear with the nucleus cudgel-type structures that can be dyed--
 chromosomes.   These chromosomes change from pairs to singles and enter into
 two cells and consequently the number of chromosomes in a generative cell
 decreases by a half.  When the generative cells are from the two different
 sexes combine, one coming from the chromosome of the father and the other
 one from the chromosome of the mother, the chromosomes are again paired.
 There is a parallel relation between this movement of chromosome and the
 form of the transfer of gene to clearly show that the gene is above the
 chromosome.  American scientist Morgan and his students have made important
 contributions in proving that genes exist above the chromosomes in linear
 sequence.  Around the 1930's and influenced by Morgan's theory of genes,
 scholars in China carried out experiments on fruitflies and lady birds and

 made important and creative discoveries about the roles of gene in the
 growth of individual substance and its change during the variation of
 substance; up to now this discovery is generally accepted as having
 classic significance.
 Thanks to the development of science, mankind's field of vision has been
 expanded to space and has penetrated into tiny layers of the structures of
 substances.  In the early 1950's, Huasheng [5478 3932] and Kelike [9034
 6849 0344] put forth double-spiral structural model of DNA and consequently
 they have been able to explain the chemical structure and biological
 foundation of gene on the basis of molecules.   This discovery is not only
 an important breakthrough in the scale of biology but also a brilliant
 achievement of the whole natural science and its significance can be matched
 with any scientific discovery that has so far been made.
 DNA is an important part of the chromosome with the exception of few low-
 grade living substances such as virus and bacteriophage that have ribo-
 nucleic acid (RNA) and heredity substance, DNA is the carrying substance
 for transferring information of all the living substances that have so far
 been known.   DNA is a long-thread-type big molecule of living substance and
 it is formed by four different types of hydroxide ion and nucleotide.  A
 gene is a section of DNA molecules and includes several to tens of thousands
 of nucleotide.   Every three of the interlinked nucleotides constitute a
 heredity code to decide the kind of amino acid.   Amino acids are the basic
 unit for the composition of protein.  Mainly there are 20 different types
 of amino acid that are determined by different heredity codes.   In other
 words, the types, characters and function of the protein of the various
 macroscopic characters in the body of living substances are determined by
 the types and arrangement of amino acid, that is to say, they are deter-
 mined by the types and the sequence of arrangement of the amino acid inside
 DNA molecules.   Through heredity code, the heredity information that is
 brought by DNA controls the types of the synthesized protein and conse-
 quently this protein turns into the character of the living body.   DNA can
 reproduce itself and through the process of cell division and fertilization
 passes down the heredity code to the next generation.  A gene is subject to
 a certain readjustment and control and plays its own role in different cells
 and times.   Therefore the synthesis of the protein that is decided by a gene
 has a certain sequence of time and space to realize cell division and body
 growth.   Once the types and sequence of arrangement of the nucleotide
 inside a gene change, the heredity code will also change and consequently
 there will appear abnormal composition of protein to affect the normal
 metabolism inside the cells and cause abnormal characters such as the death
 of living substances or diseases.   If such changed genes exist in generative
 cells, there will appear variations in the next generation.   This biological
 evolution that is formed through a long chain of heredity and variation
 from one generation to another can be proved scientifically on the basis of
 molecules.
 Right from the beginning of the development of genetics up to now, various
 suppositions and definitions have been put forth in different periods while
 the tests on scientific experiments tell us that the nature of studying

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 genes and their reproduction, transfer and role should become the main line
 and orientation of the study of genetics.  Following the deepening of the
 understanding of the gene, greater development will be made in the study of
 genetics.
 The Important Roles of Genetics
 Genetics have a very close relation with industry, agriculture and medical
 science and other sectors.   Fine strains of bacteria that are needed by
 biological fermentation industries such as antibiotics and glutamic acid
 and high yielding and fine strains of livestocks and crops and the preven-
 tion and treatment of hereditary diseases, all these required us to select
 fine strains and put forth medical measures under the theoretical guidance
 of genetics.   As molecular genetics is developing, genetics will make
 increasingly greater contributions to the socialist modernization program.
 Reforms of the heredity of living things can be carried out not only
 through individual hybridization and selection of strains in a planned way
 but can also be realized through transforming different levels of nucleus,
 chromosomes and genes.   Gene projects in the 1970's included processing and
 transforming heredity substances at the molecular level according to the
 needs of mankind so as to enable us to produce the products of the outside
 genes within living bodies and create new species of living substances.
 Gene projects have provided effective experiment measures for basic study
 of such higher living things as the division of cells, growth and the
 appearance of tumors; these projects have also opened up a new road for
 major changes in such sectors as industry, agriculture, national defense
 and medicines.  The appearance of gene projects has helped prove the
 correctness of the theory of gene heredity and it means an important
 breakthrough of the heredity in bringing happiness to mankind.  At present,
 the use of the technology of gene projects has given rise to a new industry.
 Some advanced countries have set up organizations and departments for
 special study and production by using this. technology.  There are more than.
 100 pharmaceutical, foodstuff, energy and mining companies and factories in
 America that have already set up the departments of heredity projects.
 Active study in this aspect is also being carried out in China.
 The function of genes basically can be divided into two categories.  The
 first category is to determine the composition of protein.   Certain genes
 produce certain proteins and they are called structural genes.  Another
 category is to regulate and control the activities of structural genes so
 as to decide the timing of the activity and closing of structural genes and
 these genes are called regulating and controlling genes.   In the mid-1970's,
 some types of nucleic acid restriction enzyme (enzyme is protein) that are
 able to differ the order of certain nucleotide on the basis of DNA mole-
 cules and to cut off DNA molecules between two nucleotides.   Therefore the
 different types of nucleic acid restriction enzyme can be used to cut off
 different DNA fragments.   These fragments contain the required genes or a
 certain synthetized plasmid that is composed of the DNA that has departed
 from bacteria cells.   Sometimes it is also necessary at the same time to
 link the DNA order that has regulating roles with structural genes.   Plasma

 are able to move among bacterium, enter into daughter cells along the dif-
 ferentiation of cells.and to reproduce themselves without relying on bac-
 teria chromosomes.  Thus to make use of these features it is possible to
 make an outside gene plasmid enter into bacteria.  As bacteria are quick
 in generating while plasma are able to reproduce themselves, it is possible
 for outside genes to expand many reproduction in a short period and the
 products of genes will consequently be increased by many times.  According
 to this basic principle these features can be widely used in producing
 the proteins with scarce resources (such as enzymes) or peptides (such as
 hormones).   For example, human insulin can only be extracted from the
 human pancreas while the obstructive substance of the human body must be
 isolated from the cells of the bodies of those suffering from virus infec-
 tion.  These medicines are effective in various degrees in treating such
 diseases that are caused by diabetes and viruses and in treating tumors.
 But in the past, the production of these medicines was very limited.  Now
 the difficulty of producing these medicines has been resolved by DNA
 reorganization technology.   To link the genes of human body that are pro-
 ducing insulin and obstructive substances with bacteria plasmid and then
 insert them into the colonbacillus will enable them to expand inside cells
 and synthesize insulin with obstructive substances.
 Such technology can be used in agriculture by putting the genes charac-
 terized by disease-resistance, high yielding, fine strains  and nitrogen
 fixation into crops cells to produce new species that cannot be achieved
 under natural conditions or through normal breeding methods.
 Genetics is directly related to human health and birth control and its sig-
 nificance in this aspect has been increasingly demonstrated.   Following the
 liberation of China, diseases that seriously threaten the life of the
 people such as plague, typhus, cholera and smallpox have been basically put
 under control.   At the same time, owing to the fact that in developing
 industrial and agricultural production we did not pay enough attention to
 fully controlling the three wastes, environmental pollution is becoming more
 serious and this situation has resulted in higher disease recurrence rate
 and death rate of those suffering from malignant tumors and heredity dis-
 eases.   It has become an urgent subject of study as how to prevent such
 diseases.
 Present statistics showed that so far there are more than 2,800 forms that
 are determined by individual genes and many of these forms are heredity
 diseases and they do not include the forms that are determined by many
 genes. Malignant tumors are closely related with the structure and function
 of the genes inside cells and some are even determined by particular genes.
 Therefore the basic theory of heredity can be regarded as a theoretical
 foundation for suggesting prevention measures.   For example, all chemical
 substances that are able to induce genes to make a sudden change are
 basically the cause of cancer.   Therefore the sudden change of bacterium can
 be used to examine carcinogenic substances in a big way to replace the tra-
 ditional experiments on cancer through animals and this method is rapid,
 precise and simple and with less spending.   In addition, it has been
 encouraged in a big way in China that a couple of parents can only have one

 child and this measure is aimed at controlling the growth of population and
 stepping up the modernization program.  Under this condition, it is impera-
 tive to do a good job of preventing and curing heredity diseases and ensur-
 ing healthy physical and mental growth of children, and this work is an
 important matter that not only concerns millions of families but also
 relates to the future of the people of various nationalities in China.
 Statistics about other countries show that the percentage of the new babies
 suffering from hereditary diseases is in the range of 3 to 10.5 percent.  So
 far there are no such statistics in China; but if we calculate on the lowest
 percentage of 3 percent, of the more than 18 million babies born annually in
 China, more than 500,000 are suffering from heredity diseases!   Such
 patients are characterized by idiotic behavior, low mentality, malformation
 and inborn heart disease; some die prematurely, some lose their labor
 capability when they grow and they are not able to take care of themselves
 and some have heavy spiritual burdens.  This situation is a tragedy both to
 the families of the patients and to society.  Therefore it is imperative to
 popularize genetics knowledge so that the broad masses of the people will be
 able to avoid marriages among close relatives. because with such marriages,
 the percentage of the hereditary diseases suffered by children is much
 higher.   It is better for pregnant women whose family members have a record
 of heredity diseases to have checks before they give birth.   Even during the
 first 3 months of pregnancy, it is necessary to check whether a baby inside
 the womb has serious hereditary shortcomings so as to stop or terminate tine
 pregnancy and avoid the birth of a sick child.  If such children are
 detected when they are still babies, it is necessary to take medical
 measures by controlling the nourishment of their diet so as to control and
 cure the disease.   Of course, the best way is to use gene projects to mend
 `the roles of these defective genes.  This aspect is the orientation for real
 nucleus gene projects.  Although there is no example of success in this work,
 it is by no means beyond our reach.
 My Views on the Prospects of Genetics
 Genetics is an advanced branch of biological science and the study of. this
 sector is very active.  But the development of genetics in China was tor-
 tuous.   In the early days of liberation, we followed the so-called Miqiul:Ln
 [4717 6726 2651] theory that was advocated by Lishenke [2621 2773 4430] of
 the Soviet Union and consequently the theory of genes was labeled with
 political slogans such as "bourgeois," "reactionary" and "idealist" and it
 was prohibited in universities and research organizations.   In 1956, Chair-
 man Mao put forth the famous principle of "letting a hundred flowers blossom
 and a hundred schools of thought contend" and genetics was once again
 liberated in China and its situation gradually improved.   Heredity courses
 have been set up in universities, heredity specialties have been formed and
 college students and postgraduates have been enrolled to train a great num-
 ber of specialized staff in genetics.  Research organizations have been set
 up and workers in genetics with different academic viewpoints have their own
 scientific research bases.  Certain progress has been made in the study of
 basic sciences such as cell genetics, biochemical genetics, human genetics,
 microorganism genetics and developmental genetics.  These achievements have
 filled in some gaps to become closer to advanced foreign standards.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 During the 10 turbulent years, the "gang of four" went against historical
 trends to create a disaster to the whole revolutionary cause of China while
 the education and research work of genetics was almost completely stopped.
 Following the downfall of the "gang of four," genetics began to be active
 again and began its second "renaissance."  Through recalling the develop-
 ment of genetics in China according to the specific conditions of the
 country, I put the following views as how to further develop genetics.
 1.  It is necessary to uphold the principle of "letting a hundred flowers
 blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and the principle of
 having practice as the sole criterion of truth.
 Because of historical reasons, academic contention in genetics is always a
 subject that draws people's attention.  Therefore it is necessary to reso-
 lutely continue to display academic democracy and mobilize the initiative
 of various aspects.  At the same time, it is necessary to uphold the Marxist
 basic principle of having practice as the sole criterion of truth.   In
 appraising a theory or a viewpoint of genetics, appraising the level of a
 scientific research achievement, appraising the work of a unit or the
 achievements of a heredity worker, it is necessary to proceed from reality,
 display democracy and to let scientists to discuss freely and make conclu-
 sions according to objective effectiveness.  Academic contention is aimed at
 analyzing and clarifying what is wrong and right scientifically so as to
 foster a strict style of study.  Any theory that has been denied and dis-
 carded by practice, any viewpoint and conjecture without factual foundation
 can in no way be propagated by using "contention" as an excuse; nor should
 effort be made to seek foundation for such theory and viewpoint.  It is
 because the purpose of "letting a hundred flowers blossom" is to clarify
 truth and promote the development of science that strict and responsible
 attitude must be taken in this aspect.
 2.   It is necessary to persist in linking theory with reality and make con-
 tributions to the modernization program.
 In studying genetics it is necessary to pay attention to solving the various
 concrete problems in industrial and agricultural production, medicine and
 health and the construction of national defense.  At the same time, it is
 necessary to sum up and probe theoretically and pay attention to exposing
 internal laws.  At present, the key of the theoretical study of genetics is
 to really grasp the structure, function and regulating of real nuclei cell
 genes.   This work is the starting point for genetics and molecular biology
 in further exposing the nature of life.   In applied study, it is necessary
 to speed up the use of DNA technology such as reorganization outside body,
 gene Kelong [0344 7127] and combination of cells, concentrate finance and
 manpower, define certain units and make breakthrough in selected sectors of
 gene projects.   The subjects for making breakthrough must be defined
 according to the national conditions of 'China and it is not necessary to
 follow the experiences of other countries.
 3.   It is necessary to pay attention to mutual integration between genetics
 and other sciences and pay attention to training specialized staff in
 genetics.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 The history of the development of genetics over the past several decades
 showed that the rapid development of genetics is to a great extent caused
 by mutual integration of cytology, chemistry, physics and mathematics.
 Such integration has enabled people to develop from the understanding of
 heredity substances to abstract codes and then to objective bodies, from
 cells to nucleus and chromosomes and then into the inside of DNA molecules.
 In the future, the further development of genetics will no doubt require
 more from the part of science; the development of science will also promote
 the development of genetics.  In improving such scientific technology and
 concepts of mathematics, physics, chemistry and computers in the process of
 the study of genetics, it is required that people must have the basic
 knowledge of genetics and that specialized staff must grasp the technology
 and concepts of the above-mentioned sciences in carrying out research work.
 Therefore in training such staff, it is necessary to strengthen basic
 theory and basic operation and pay attention to the, penetration and exchange
 among scientific branches.
 The level of the genetics in China at present is still lagging behind the
 advanced level of other countries whether in basic theoretical study or in
 experiments.   But we have the leadership of the party, the advantages of
 the socialist system and spiritual encouragement from the 12th party con-
 gress.                         Therefore as long as we are able to learn from foreign experiences
 selectively, spare no efforts and avoid "working like a swarm of bees," we
 are sure to promote the genetics of our country into the world advanced
 level and make contributions to the great cause of the modernization program
 of the motherland.

 SEVERAL QUESTIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF LITERARY CRITICISM
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 pp 36-39
 [Article by Liang Dalin [2733 1129 2651]; passages within slantlines pub-
 lished in boldface]
 [Text] Literature represents an important component part of the construc-
 tion of a socialist spiritual civilization, as well as the construction of
 culture and ideology.  We should ensure that literature plays an even
 bigger role in the development of a new phase in modernized construction
 and hence it is vital that we strengthen and increase literary criticism.
 Since the smashing of the "gang of four," and in particular since the 3d
 Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, literary criticism has
 achieved great successes in terms of bringing order out of chaos in lit-
 erature and creating new prosperity.  However, there still exists one
 aspect of it which is not in line with the present trend of development in
 literature.
 Literary criticism should constantly research and solve new situations and
 new problems in the literary world.   In. order to do this, I feel that it is
 important to tackle the following few related questions on a  dialectical
 basis:
 /1.   It is vital that we strengthen the theoretical base of Marxism and also
 the intimate relation between this base and creative reality and day-to-day
 reality./
 Theoretical literary criticism is guided by Marxist-Leninist thinking.   How-
 ever, as a result of a lack of a solid theoretical Marxist foundation in the
 literary world from the very beginning, compounded by the 10 years of social
 turmoil wrought by Lin Biao, Jiang Qing and their cronies, as well as insuf-
 ficient work over the last few years in teaching the literary world the
 theories of Marxism, the standard of Marxist theory to be found amongst the
 ranks of literary critics has become even more obviously lacking in rela-
 tion to the demands of modern life in China.   In the case of some immedi-
 ately pressing important theoretical questions in the literary world, such
 as the question of the relation between communism and humanitarianism, ques-
 tions of truth and tendentiousness and questions of subjective and objective
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 aesthetics, there have been a great number of articles produced, with dis-
 cussion indeed animated.  However, discussion of these topics has lacked
 the appearance of articles with a higher standard of theoretical founda-
 tion.                     Comparative examination of the theoretical criticism in such areas
 as the cinema, the theater, music and art clearly compound these weaknesses.
 One important factor generating this kind of situation is a general lack in
 a solid theoretical foundation in Marxist philosophy.  Despite the fact that
 Marxist guidance is insufficient in certain areas of literary criticism, a
 few people show disregard and suspicion of Marxist and Maoist thinking and
 thus spread incorrect ideas about literature, which is hardly surprising.
 The situation in literary criticism and literary creativity make pressing
 demands on the world of literary theory.  All kinds of literary trends and
 schools of thought in the literary world must be systematically researched
 using ample material to produce a Marxist evaluation.  Thus, we must
 encourage the literary world to study Marxism so that it may strengthen its
 own theoretical basis.  This will be an important move in improving the
 quality of literary criticism.
 In addition to insufficient preparation and awareness of the basis of Marx-
 ist theory, another phenomenon exists, and that is a tendency toward dogma-
 tism in some theoretical research, of divorce from creative reality and day-
 to-day reality.   Some comrades are unable to shake off the influence of the
 concept that "words are truth," and thus are unable to comprehend new
 theoretical questions arising out of new trends and developments.  Some
 educational research departments do not put enough emphasis on studying
 literary creation and criticism and thus, in their comments on modern
 popular works, they class such things as."popular literature" of no artistic
 value.  Some commentators copiously quote the classics and various explana-
 tory notes relating to the classics to deduce that one cannot use Marxism
 to research and examine lively and vigorous questions relating to reality
 that are generated in the literary world, implying that it makes very dry
 reading and one gains even less from doing so.
 We can discern in the works of a few young writers of today, tendencies
 toward egoism, social-Darwinism, religious idealism and Western bourgeois
 modernism.  This is a new situation in literary creation.  Our literary
 critics should take note of this situation, research it and provide effec-
 tive guidance for these writers.   The works of these writers are different
 from those which directly depart from the party's leadership and the social-
 ist road and they are also. different from those which are commercial, vulgar,
 ridiculous and slipshod.  Most of these young authors are well-intentioned
 and their motivation is often to strive for deliverance from the pain of
 their wounds, reflecting modern man's struggles and aspirations.   However,
 because of their inexperience and their failure to use communist ideology
 in their examination and consideration of life, these writers' world out-
 look and moral thinking become confused.   Thus only reasoned literary
 criticism based in Marxist theory, making a deep and concrete analysis of
 present creative reality can be of any help in improving them and their
 work.

 Literary criticism should examine and research new situations with eager-
 ness, solving new problems at the same time.  The question facing us today
 is how literary creation can make still further progress in an even more
 glorious new phase of development?  Some people say that creative work
 cannot develop, that it is merely made up of criticisms of liberalization
 and that such criticism should stop.  Other people say that literary criti-
 cism now shows a fear of bringing up the former idea that literature should
 serve politics and that it is high time we returned to this doctrine.  We
 should throw some light onto both of these rather one-sided views.  What we
 must remember is that today's writers and readers are no longer satisfied
 with merely opening former wounds or wallowing in bygone "erroneous think-
 ing."  The party leadership has brought about an historic change and thus
 literature should also bring about a similar change by joining together
 yesterday, today and tomorrow, correctly integrating them with the demands
 of the new masses and the new era, making profound observations and experi-
 ences in this incomparably broad life of the four modernizations, and giving
 true reflection and embodiment to this new rainbow-colored world and its
 inhabitants.  Achieving this requires intense probing and practical experi-
 ence on the part of the writers and authors.   In addition, it requires that
 they breathe as one with the critics, sharing a common mission in life,
 thereby making great contributions to literary theory.
 /2.  We must emphasize the ideological content of analysis and strengthen
 the analysis of literary expression./
 In the last few years, there have been many articles written investigating
 standards of literary criticism.   Some of these have examined the formula-
 tion of political and literary standards while others have discussed Engel's
 standards of using aesthetic and historical viewpoints in assessing an item
 of work.   Some of these articles express the opinion that the standards of
 literary criticism should bring together truth, goodness and beauty.   Such
 discussions are without doubt of benefit in helping people develop their,
 thinking and tackle new problems and ideas, but literary criticism still
 needs a set of standards which everyone may agree on and which reflect the
 rules of literature.   In his article "Bourgeois Liberalization and Other
 Topics," Comrade Hu Qiaomu spoke of standards for criticism of literary
 works and said:   "A certain proportion of literary work requires an evalua-
 tion of both ideological content and artistic style."  This statement is
 very accurate and relevant to the question of standards for literary criti-
 cism.   Standards for literary criticism should integrate analysis of ideo-
 logical content and literary expression in a piece of work.  In a macro-
 scopic view of literature, the content of a piece of writing cannot divorce
 itself from politics.   The everyday life content of a piece of literary work
 cannot avoid being stamped with the brand of politics.   Literary criticism
 must take an accurate political viewpoint.   It is a question of politics and
 not society alone, and yet this does not mean that literature must contain
 political tendencies nor must political standards be taken to absolute
 extremes.   This however, does not mean that one can totally ignore the
 ideological content of a piece of literature.  To confine ourselves solely
 to discussing artistic style and ignore ideological content and social
 effects will not be of great use or benefit to the piece of literature under

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 discussion. Of course, having said this, we should be cautious not to over-
 look an examination of artistic skill and style.  The target of literary
 criticism is of course literature, thus, in addition to research into. the
 ideological content of literature, literary criticism should also stress
 artistic analysis.  It should make use of Marxist aesthetics to research and
 examine artistic and literary skill, probing the rules and guidelines of
 literature, pointing out shortcomings and artistic charm embodied in the
 literature.   Such criticism may also draw on literary skills in foreign
 literature, making use of the essence of its better qualities.   For a long
 time in the past, literary criticism of some works used to overemphasize
 political standards and ignore artistic considerations even to the extent of
 labeling discussion of artistic value as heresy and perniciously influential.
 Today, one finds some critiques which, while discussing widely the important
 topic of ideology and thus approaching more closely a political handling,
 still lack the strength of logical tightness to be found in true political
 discussions.  In their treatment of literary characters, they merely tend
 to discuss their ideological behavior or make a political appraisal of the
 characters, failing to dissect the artistic form of the work.  Even fewer are
 the good articles which carry out penetrating analysis into language, struc-
 ture and details of a piece of literature.   This tendency to ignore artistic
 analysis in literature is a big barrier to improving the quality of literary
 criticism and promoting creativity.
 /3.   Support the ideological struggle on two tactical fronts./
 In his report to the 12th National Congress of the CPC, Comrade Hu Yaobang
 urged that we develop the ideological struggle on two tactical fronts, and
 he said that this was entirely in keeping with literary criticism.  We must
 not misinterpret literary criticism as merely something to point out short-
 comings or mistakes.   In actual fact, Mr Lu Xun pointed out a long time ago
 the two tasks he defined as "destroying weeds" and "watering the sweet-
 scented osmanthus."  Accomplishments in literary circles in the last few
 years have been very much in evidence and indeed, such successes have formed
 our main trends.  Thus it is, that literary criticism should confirm and
 acknowledge such success and gather and collate experience from every aspect
 of literature.   Of course, mistakes have appeared in literature, but these
 have only formed a minor aspect although they should not of course be
 ignored.   Today, the problem is that support of broad trends and criticism
 of minor divergencies both display lack of depth and vitality.
 There has always been discussion in the world of critics about how the
 literary world should be viewed.   One of the main points in the discussion
 and argument has been whether "leftist" influence is most important or
 whether the influence of bourgeois liberalization is the most important.
 There is no simple answer to this question.   Correct principles tell us to
 start from an objective viewpoint and support an ideological struggle on two
 tactical fronts.   In the last few years, the main task of the tactical
 literary front has been to liberate literature from the shackles of
 "leftism."  For some time before the forum on the question of national
 ideological fronts, some leaders and commentators in the literary world
 displayed slackness and weakness in facie of the deviational influence of

 bourgeois liberalization, thus their vigilance dropped and some extremely
 serious situations involving liberalization were not forcefully criticized.
 Some individual comrades in the literary world even went to the extent of
 denying the objective existence of bourgeois liberalization.  At that time,
 the need and task of criticizing bourgeois liberalization was very obvious.
 Today, we should still get to concrete grips with the situation by basing
 ourselves on objective views of the situation as it really is.  It should
 be pointed out that there has been both underemphasis and also overexaggera-
 tion of the deviational influence of "leftism" and bourgeois liberalization.
 Even today, some comrades assume an ambiguous attitude toward criticizing
 bourgeois liberalization, illustrating a conflict deep within their hearts.
 Other comrades are unclear about where to draw the line, and thus enlarge
 and extend everything even to the extent of taking up a "leftist" stance
 in classifying some relatively good pieces of work and relatively new con-
 cepts and ideas (for example the idea of arguing against taking political
 standards first and literary standards second) as expressions of liberaliza-
 tion.   There is also insufficient correct attention paid to "leftist" ten-
 dencies and insufficient criticism for improvement.  On the other hand there
 are also cases of overexaggeration and even liberalized stands in fighting
 "leftist" tendencies.   Indeed, some individuals even go so far as to say that
 communist ideological education is "the utmost extreme.of leftism."  This is
 of course absolutely absurd.   Today, we-must make sure that "leftist"
 ideology does not raise its head.  Literary criticism should base itself on
 objective viewing of the actual situation, devoting itself to working for
 realistic results and supporting the ideological struggle on two tactical
 fronts, while ensuring that while concentrating on one kind of incorrect
 tendency, the other is not forgotten or ignored.  Nor should we become
 intangled in arguments as to whether "leftism" or liberalization is the more
 important or serious of the two fronts.  Different situations require con-
 crete analysis, which will result in different conclusions.   It is not a
 question of generalizing and lumping everything together.
 A.  We need militancy, scientific application and a healthy Marxist style
 of writing./
 This so-called militancy mainly means taking a clearcut stand and supporting
 our principles.   Our banner is Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, as is
 communism.   Literary criticism must without fail support the communist banner
 and support the four essential principles as well as the direction pointed
 out by the 12th National Congress of the CPC.  We cannot be ambiguous or weak
 when dealing with the banner, the principles and the direction.   The com-
 munist movement already has a glorious history of over 100 years, and Com-
 munist Party members are every day putting into glorious practice the causes
 of communism.  Naturally, in the preliminary stages of socialism and com-
 munism we cannot achieve or implement systems or policies of elevated stages
 of communism, but, while we construct the socialist modernized material
 civilization we must on no account slacken in our work to construct a
 socialist spiritual civilization centered on communist ideology.   Literature
 and art, as one of the important component parts of this spiritual civiliza-
 tion, should assume the responsibility of carrying out communist education
 to the people by means of art and literature and it should give rise to the

 emergence of idealistic, moral, cultured and disciplined new socialist
 citizens. Many writers have made gratifying achievements toward this end.
 However, a small number of works have incorrectly depicted bourgeois
 morality as communist morality, while others wrongly take the socialist
 world view as a feudal world view.  In terms of idealism, such works either
 advocate individual struggles for financial and status advancement or exag-
 gerate and play up uncertainty of the future, depicting life as essentially
 an illusion.  None of this corresponds to the requirements of a socialist
 spiritual civilization.  Literary criticism should raise high the banner
 of communist ideology, drawing clear distinctions between positive and
 negative and between good and evil, giving expression to the fighting
 tradition of revolutionary literature.
 Of course this kind of militancy should be integrated with a scientific
 backup.  Literary criticism is essentially a type of scientific research,
 an activity of art appreciation and should thus adhere to the rules of
 literature, experiencing and observing both the bitter and the sweet,
 pointing out the good and bad points in a piece of work.   It should commend
 but not allow the commended to rest on their laurels, it should criticize
 but not come down too hard on the criticized.   In both cubes, truth should
 be sought from the facts, taking care to examine the entire piece of work
 and thoroughly examining its tendencies and merits and demerits.  Attention
 should be paid to the author, linking up his or her historical and social
 conditions and making appropriate comments.
 Literary criticism in recent years has seen the emergence into the literary
 world of a new tendency of presenting the facts and reasoning things out.
 In the national playwriting symposium in 1980 this was fully embodied and
 endorsed.  In this symposium, truthful and factual criticism was carried out
 against incorrect tendencies in creative writing in line with the spirit of
 these principles, while the authors concerned were filled with warm feelings
 of respect and unity.  This new tendency has provided us with fresh experi-
 ence in correctly opening up discussion of literary criticism.  However, as
 a result of incurring unfair censure from a small number of people, these
 experiences have not been able to achieve full implementation or expression.
 As a result of the intense concern of the party Central Committee, the
 national symposium on questions of tactical ideological fronts was opened
 in 1981.   Criticism of "Bitter Love" satisfactorily concluded with a turn
 for the better and criticism in the literary world and self-criticism both
 saw development.  In terms of overall trends, odious practices such as jump-
 ing on people's mistakes and shortcomings, labeling people and coming down
 hard on people have all greatly improved, as too has the apathetic one-
 sidedness of "muting ten thousand horses."  Results have since been very
 good.
 In order to introduce science into literary criticism, in general the best
 method is to adopt free discussion.   Expression should be given to differing
 opinions, so that both sides of the argument are aired.  There should be
 criticism and countercriticism.  Using discussion and guidance, when the
 time is ripe, right and wrong will become clear and correct conclusions
 will be drawn.

 The principle embodied in "let a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred
 schools of thought contend" still holds true.  Disagreement among people
 is a common phenomenon.  In our discussions and disagreements we should
 uphold Mao Zedong's formula "unite-criticize-unite."  In this way, we may
 clarify our ideology and unite all comrades.   We must welcome people's
 criticism when mistakes and shortcomings appear and we must display even
 more courage in self-criticism and should not cover up or conceal our mis-
 takes and errors.  Activities such as deliberately complicating issues,
 making groundless accusations and exaggeration as well as tendencies
 toward strong division because of differing opinions, especially party
 divisions, do nothing to help the correct development of literary criticism
 and are also at odds with the demands of a socialist spiritual civilization.
 The literary world and the world of critics and commentators should work
 together to overcome these kinds of phenomena and, taking the spirit of the
 12th National Congress of the CPC as their foundation, they should unite
 together as closely as possible.
 Today, China's literary world is inspired with political enthusiasm, study-
 ing, propagating and implementing the spirit of the 12th CPC National Con-
 gress and actively involved in considering ways of opening up new vistas
 for socialist literature.  How may we construct and develop a socialist
 literature bearing the hallmark of the Chinese?  How should literary
 creativity adapt itself to these great historical changes and correctly
 reflect the social contradictions within modernized construction?  How
 should it, in its struggle, portray the new men and women who shine with
 the light of communist ideology and other similar models?  How may it
 intensify and develop revolutionary realism and constantly improve the
 quality of creativity?  How may help be given to writers to involve them-
 selves fully in life and improve their thinking and artistic mastery?  In
 general, how may expression be given to the role of literature within
 socialist spiritual civilization?  This is an important question to pose
 for literary criticism.   Under the encouragement and guidance of the
 spirit of the 12th CPC National Congress, literary criticism must and will
 follow in the footsteps of the whole literary cause and see the emergence
 of a fresh and new era.

 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 pp 40-43
 [Article by Qiu Dexin [6726 1795 2450] and Xu Zhongyuan [1776 0022 6678]]
 [Text] Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and proletarian revolutionary.   He
 was at the same time a learned and knowledgeable scholar well versed in
 both modern and ancient learning.   In his difficult job of leading the
 Chinese revolution and building new China he was constantly in close touch
 with the actual situation in China, maintained his studies of the works of
 Marx and Lenin, extending and developing into new spheres of knowledge,
 setting himself up as a glorious example for us.
 Comrade Mao Zedong often said that scholarly study and research offer no
 shortcuts or easy ways out but require that one values one's time and be
 hard working and thorough.  One can  eat less food, and sleep less, but.
 books must be read.  Even when burdened with pressing military duties and
 when the situation on the battlefront was tense, he fully exploited march-
 ing, resting and consolidation time for the armies with his reading and
 studying.   During the years of socialist revolution and construction,
 burdened with hard and arduous work he still made use of every moment,
 before meals, after meals and even while on the toilet to study and read.
 When he was busy during the day he simply cut down on his sleep time to
 study.  He cherished every single last minute and second of his time to
 seek truth so that he might solve the practical problems facing China's
 revolution and construction.
 In the summer of 1947,. during one especially arduous march before the
 battle of Shajiadian, Comrade Mao Zedong and some military advisers
 approached some trees to rest for a while.   Hardly had the comrades sat
 down than he suddenly recited with great zest the words of the Song dynasty
 poet Xin Qiji's poem "On the Mountain Road" and said:   "It is not enough to
 learn to fire a gun.   One must learn hard about culture and study the
 reasons for revolution.  When one has studied culture and the reasons for
 revolution, one will understand."  Having said this he then took up a book
 and began to read.

 Comrade Mao Zedong once said to a responsible comrade:  At the moment we are
 digging trenches in the mountainside, but in the future we will govern the
 towns and cities.   Read a book as thin as thin in 1 year, in 2 years you'll
 read two and in 3 years three!  If you go on like that then in several tens
 of years you'll read several tens of books. and thus you'll gradually grasp
 Marxism-Leninism, won't you?!  Not only did Mao Zedong say this, he also
 practiced what he preached in a laudable manner.  When the central govern-
 ment bodies evacuated from Yanan, most of Comrade Mao Zedong's books were
 sent to the eastern banks of the Huanghe River.  Because he wanted to study
 on the marches from one battle to another in northern Shaanxi, he personally
 drew up a list of books he wanted and had some Marxist-Leninist books, some
 philosophy books and some books by military authors sent back from the
 eastern Huanghe.  These books were ones that he often read, and among them
 was "Anti-Duhring" which was collected in the Red Army's 1933 attack on
 Zhangzhou, and which on the Long March he cherished so much that he kept it
 constantly at his side.  After this point,.wherever the armies went, so did
 these books.
 Among Mao Zedong's collection of books was "On the Development of Monism
 From a Historical Viewpoint" by Plekhanov.  Mao Zedong received this book
 on 24 December 1945, and the next day he had read 11 pages while by the
 following day he read as far as page 27.  Between the 27th and the 29th he
 only managed to read 14 pages since he was occupied with the drafting of
 central government directives for Dongbei.  By 31 December, he had read as
 far as page 43.   On 4 January 1946 he had reached page 59.  He spent half
 the night on 4 January reading another 6 pages and by 5 January he had
 reached page 92.   Thus, in a fairly short space of time he completed a
 book over 300 pages long.
 In the summer of 1947 the famous scholar Comrade Zhou Gucheng was invited
 to go swimming with Comrade Mao Zedong at Zhongnanhai.  Afterwards when on
 the shore again, Mao Zedong simply threw on an old pair of pajamas, picked
 up the book "Han Shu".and threw himself into discussion with Comrade Zhou
 Gucheng.   Comrade Mao Zedong turned to the "biographies" on page 39 and,
 pointing to a section in which Zhao Congguo advocated garrison troops and
 peasants opening up wasteland and growing food grain in the northeast, he
 said:  This man really knows how to stick to his convictions.  At the start,
 the number of people who praised and welcomed his ideas only amounted to
 about 10 or 20 percent, while his opponents made up the other 80 or 90
 percent.   But by the very end his supporters numbered around 80 or 90
 percent and his opponents only made up about 10 or 20 percent.  Whether in
 the past or today, man must accept the truth and this is a process.   Every
 time Mao Zedong went swimming, whether at Beidaihe, the Yangtse, the Lushan
 Reservoir or the Xiangjiang, he almost always read before taking his dip and
 of course afterwards as well.
 In March 1958 Comrade Mao Zedong presided over a meeting in Chengdu.  During
 the 20-odd days of the meeting, so that'his reading wouldn't be held up, he
 took his meals in his office.  When he ate he would push the documents,
 books and other reading materials to one side and raise his rice bowl to eat.
 Before the last mouthful of food had even reached his stomach he would
 already be engrossed again in his reading or studies.

 In the 1970's, Comrade Mao Zedong's physical condition constantly
 deteriorated, as he was affected by a constant stream of various illnesses.
 In the last few years of his life he still managed to continue his reading
 with amazing willpower and determination..  He was unable to read small print
 clearly and thus he turned to books with larger print.  From the end of 1973
 to the beginning of 1976 he read a total of some several tens of large print
 books.  For those books which did not exist in large print he resorted to the
 use of a magnifying glass.  He once ran a fever of over 39 degrees and for 2
 or 3 days he ate very little, was unable to get up and lay on his bed, still
 reading.  In the middle of July 1975, acting on the personal advice of Com-
 rade Zhou Enlai, he underwent an eye operation and for a while afterwards
 was unable to read, and so he asked other people to read to him.  When his
 sight was restored, he continued as usual to read books and documents.
 However, his doctors prescribed that he only read for from between 15 and 30
 minutes each day.   This was of course very frustrating for someone with a
 passion like his for reading.  In fact, the amount of time he did spend
 reading and studying each day far exceeded what the doctors had prescribed.
 Even in the last few hours before this man's heart finally ceased to beat,
 when he was too weak to speak, he still motioned to the staff to read to
 him and when he heard sections that to him were particularly satisfying,
 there appeared the very faintest traces of a smile on his face.
 Mao Zedong's life was a revolutionary life and a fighting life.  It was
 also a life of sincere ideals and addiction to work and study.   He was a
 man who lived his life to the very end, who studied to the end, who never
 rested and never ceased to study and learn.
 It is impossible to envisage someone who did not have a high theoretical
 understanding of Marxism-Leninism being able to lead the revolution in
 China, a country with such an enormous population and vast land mass and
 complex situation.   Thus, in the revolutionary struggle, Comrade Mao Zedong
 always read with indefatigable diligence everything he could of Marx, Lenin,
 Engels and Stalin as well as other Marxist-Leninist literature.  He used
 his reading to analyze and solve China's practical problems.
 Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out many times that if one wants to study
 Marxism-Leninism one simply has to read studiously, sit down and really
 bury oneself in it.   It is not like reading a novel, where one reads 10
 lines a day and only gets a very superficial understanding from quickly
 skimming over the book.  One must take a close look at and really study
 every word and every phrase, diligently grasping the meaning.  Mao Zedong
 read "Das Kapital" way back in the days of Yanan.  Reprints appeared in
 1953 and 1957 and a large print version came out in 1968 and each time,
 Comrade Mao Zedong reread several selected passages again.   Even up until
 a short time before his death he would'still read the book and make annota-
 tions in the margin.  The first time he read the "Communist Manifesto" was
 in 1920 when he came to Beijing.  He reread it countless times afterwards.
 He was able to recite almost all of the manifesto's most pertinent parts.
 When he died, two copies of the "Communist Manifesto" published during the
 war years were still lying by his side.

 Judging from the existing, extremely incomplete information that we have,
 Comrade Mao Zedong spent the last few decades of his life reading the works
 .of Marx, Lenin, Engels and Stalin.  Not only did this include the collected
 works, selected works, collated monographs and off-prints, it also included
 specialized reading of Marxist politics, economics, philosophy, military
 affairs, history and literature.  The Marxist-Leninist works that he read
 helped enrich and develop in a practical sense his application of Marxist-
 Leninist theories as a basis for solving concrete questions related to
 China's revolution and construction.
 Take, for example, "A Course in Dialectical Materialism" which he read at
 Yanan.  Comrade Mao Zedong spent in all around 6 months making a 33,000-
 word commentary and annotation on the two editions of this book, the longest
 of which was around 1,000 words long.  These annotations contained a con-
 cise outline of the original with the essential points intact as well as
 simplification of certain points.  They also contain criticisms and exten-
 sions of the original and correct propositions linked to the actual situa-
 ?,tion in China's revolutionary struggle.                     For example, in the case of the
 question of Chinese national unity in r'esi'sting Japanese aggression, he
 pointed out the confusion existing inside and outside the party at that time
 and in the relevant section of the book he wrote:   "The correct watchword in
 today's struggle is to unite in one front against Japanese aggression and
 the first problem is to achieve domestic peace and cooperation between the
 communists and the nationalists."  "National contradictions among the
 Chinese should be solved by unifying into one united front with the bour-
 geoisie."  He said that the Leninist party had also had a period of coopera-
 tion with the bourgeoisie and thus he held up the call for concerted attack
 by converging columns.   In principle the cooperation between the Chinese
 Communist Party and the Chinese Nationalist Party was a concerted attack by
 converging columns, although the way it was embodied was different.  The so-
 called converging columns were the political independence of class and the
 party while the concerted attack was the unified battle line.  He stressed
 that:   "Today, the question of whether the national calamity can be solved
 depends on whether the unified battle line is able to expand, develop and
 consolidate."  These annotations are an important embodiment of Mao Zedong's
 ideology of a nationally unified battle line to counter Japanese aggression.
 From the founding of new China until the beginning of the 1960's, in order
 to adapt to the new situations in the socialist revolution and construction,
 Comrade Mao Zedong read and studied, in addition to such tomes as "Das
 Kapital" and "A Critique of Political Economy," works by Lenin and Stalin
 dealing with political economy, as well as literature discussing Lenin and
 Stalin's leadership of the Soviet, people in carrying out socialist economic
 construction.   From 1958 until 1961 Comrade Mao Zedong read many times
 Stalin's "Problems of Soviet Socialist Economy."  He still mainly concen-
 trated on bringing together several comrades to read this work of Stalin's
 as well as the Soviet publication "Textbook on Political Economy" (Third
 Edition) and by integrating these works with the actual situation in the
 Chinese socialist revolution and construction both read and discussed the
 topic.  In 1958 he pointed out some mistakes of a "leftist" tendency in our
 party's work as well as erroneous thinking in some individuals and in the

 first Zhengzhou meeting of November of that year he personally publicized
 this work of Stalin's and, integrating it with the actual situation in China
 he pointed out that for a certain period of time we should not try and
 eradicate commodity production, but, instead, we should develop commodity
 production even more.  By this time we had already a socialist system of
 public ownership of the means of production and the system of exploitation
 had already been eradicated, thus at that stage in China the development of
 commodity production could not lead to capitalism.  This speech played an
 important role in unifying the ideology of comrades throughout the party
 and overcoming erroneous tendencies.
 Thus Comrade Mao Zedong may be called one of the party's great Marxists who
 made enormous contributions, one of the most important of which was his
 constant study of Marxism-Leninism, and his generalized use of the prin-
 ciples of Marxism-Leninism in practice in China's revolution and construc-
 tion.  Although he made mistakes in his later years he is still worthy of
 being a model for the party in how to study, use and develop the theories
 of Marxism-Leninism.
 Only by grasping all the spiritual wealth created by mankind can one become
 a true communist.   Reading was both.a habit and an addiction for Mao Zedong,
 and it was also an integral part of his revolutionary activities.   In the
 last few decades, his revolutionary enthusiasm and spirit as well as his
 scrupulous scientific attitude extended his reading to areas of knowledge:
 encompassing both ancient and modern, foreign and Chinese.  From the books
 remaining in Mao Zedong's former residence in Zhongnanhai we can see that in
 addition to the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, there are also all kinds
 of books on social sciences and the natural sciences.  He read in large
 quantities and he read widely, he was an inspiration and there are few
 university scholars who can compare.
 All his life, Comrade Mao Zedong had an ardent passion for the works of Lu
 Xun.   In August 1938 when the "Collected Works of Lu Xun" were published,
 his admiration was enormous and whenever he had time he would read the
 publication.  When in 1949 he traveled abroad for official visits, he took
 several of the books along with him.  Later, when off-prints were published
 he made annotations and comments in many of them.  At the end of 1973 the.
 large print, bound edition came out and once again he reread some parts.
 In August 1975 despite serious illness which weakened him, his trembling
 hand nevertheless wrote on one page of book five of volume five of the
 bound edition of the collected works, "Eat Rotten Apples."  This was
 originally from the passage "Concerning Translation (2)" which he had
 asked his staff to read to him.  Lu Xun had used the example of eating a
 rotten apple to explain how one should correctly treat the sick and the
 ill.  Mao Zedong was in complete agreement with his opinion.  When the
 staff who were reading to him reached this passage he repeated with a look
 of joy on his face, "That's right, that's right!"

 Comrade Mao Zedong was a mine of historical knowledge.  Among the books that
 he had was the 24 history books of the Wuying Palace edition of the 12th
 year of Qian Long.  From the notes and various diacritics he made in the
 book one can see that he read this enormous tome of 850 books from beginning
 to end.  The pertinent remarks and his careful reading are of great educa-
 tional benefit to one who might read the work now.   Toward the end of the
 1950's he urged everyone to read the section of "The History of the Three
 Kingdoms" entitled "Guo Jia."  Guo Jia was wise and resourceful and when-
 ever Cao Cao had a very important matter to settle, he always asked Guo Jia
 to oblige and thus a plan would be formulated on the basis of Guo Jia and
 other important strategists' opinions.  What Mao Zedong hoped for in asking
 everyone to read "Guo Jia" was that leading cadres on all levels would think
 more and plan more when talking and working and thus cut down on and oppose
 arbitrary decisionmaking based on little planning.  Under his suggestion
 many cadres thoroughly read "Guo Jia" and from it gained historical
 enlightenment and thus the book helped a great deal in correcting some of
 the headaches that existed within the party at the time as well as some
 erroneous tendencies to veer away from reality.
 Comrade Mao Zedong also loved to read ancient literature, and he read
 nearly everything from "The Water Margin," "The Journey to the West,"
 the."Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "The Dream of the Red Chamber."
 He once said that in reading the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" not only
 should one consider war and foreign policy but also organization.  Liu Bei,
 Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and Zhu Geliang were all northerners and
 organized troops to move southward.  When they reached Sichuan they estab-
 lished a very good base area with the "regional cadres."  Mao Zedong used
 this story from history to illustrate that cadres from other areas must
 without fail unite with local cadres before any productive work may be
 undertaken.   He lectured that Cao Cao, leaving for south of the river,
 needed to establish a commander to look after things and so he found a
 young member of the union called Zhou Yu to be superintendent.  No one
 was happy with the decision but later they won a great battle.  He used
 this story to explain that choice of cadres should not be according to age
 or finances but according to talent with both ability and political
 integrity.
 Mao Zedong once said that the natural sciences represent a weapon with
 which we may gain our freedom.  He read'Copernicus, Bruno, Sakata, Masalchi,
 Li Siguang, Zhu Kezhen, Yang Zhenning, etc.--the major scientific writers as
 well as much important scientific literature such as Darwin's "The Origin
 of the Species" and Huxley's "Theory of~Terrestrial Evolution."  Some of
 these he reread several times.  At the end of the 1950's he personally
 carried out research in agriculture, soil, machinery, physics, chemistry,
 hydrology and meteorology through his reading, thus setting himself up for
 us as a model of the student of the sciences.  His personal development in
 the natural sciences also produced some important views.   For example, he
 disagreed that the proton and the neutron together formed the most basic
 particle in the atomic nucleus.  He felt that the proton and the neutron
 were separable.  He wittily remarked, Do you believe me?   If you don't
 believe me then prove me wrong.  Later, of course, scientists were to dis-
 cover the antiproton and the antineutron, thus proving his theory.

 The 12th CPC National Congress has outlined the glorious target of opening
 up and developing a new aspect in socialist modernized construction.   Its
 realization requires thorough revolutionization, youthfulness, knowledge-
 ability and specialization of our talents.  Thus every party member, every
 cadre and every revolutionary comrade should heed the call of the party
 Central Committee and steadfastly study Marxism.  In addition we should all
 learn the necessary theoretical knowledge for out line of work as well as
 management know-how and technological knowledge.  If we can all emulate
 Comrade Mao Zedong and cherish every moment of our time, work hard, study
 and read over a period of many years then the level of Marxist theory in
 the party and the standard of scientific knowledge throughout the popula-
 tion will constantly rise.

 THE MORE WE STUDY, THE GREATER OUR CONFIDENCE AND THE HIGHER OUR
 ASPIRATIONS--UNDERSTANDING AND APPRECIATING THE 12TH PARTY CONGRESS
 DOCUMENTS STUDY CLASS FOR LEADING CADRES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 pp 44-46
 [Article by the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Provincial CPC Com-
 mittee]
 [Text]   In order to organize the leading cadres of organs at the provincial
 level to study well the 12th party congress documents and to simultaneously
 promote the study of the broad masses of party members and cadres, the
 provincial CPC committee, beginning the last 10 days of September last
 year, held study classes for leading cadres of organs at the provincial
 level.   The study class, lasting 3 weeks, has now been held three times.
 Altogether, 612 people have attended the study classes and 28 responsible
 comrades including secretaries, members of the standing committee of the
 provincial CPC committee, vice chairmen'of the standing committee of the
 provincial people's congress, deputy governors and vice chairmen of the
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Congress also participated in the
 study.  All the participants universally agreed that the methods which the
 provincial CPC committee adopted for running the study class attended by
 those who were released from work in a centralized way enabled the partici-
 pants to concentrate their efforts on study with their time ensured, thus
 yielding satisfactory results.   In the course of the whole study, the high
 upsurge of the enthusiasm of the participants, the seriousness of their
 attitude toward study and their lively presentation of speeches were
 unprecedented for many years.  Many comrades have said:   "Studying documents
 has never suited us as well as the present situation.   The more we study,
 the greater our confidence, the higher our aspirations and the fuller our
 drive."
 The contents of the study class are the 12th party congress documents, with
 stress being put on the 12th party congress report, and including the
 selective study of related important documents since the 3d Plenary Session
 of the 11th CPC Central Committee and part of the works of Comrade Chen Yun
 ,in q certain period after the founding of the PRC.   The aim of studying
 these documents and works in a selective way is to help the participants
 deepen their comprehension of the documents of relevant parts of the 12th
 party congress report and further understand the continuity and unanimity

 'of the spirit of the 12th party congress and that of the 3d Plenary Session
 of the 11th CPC Central Committee, understand that the principles and tasks
 formulated by the 12th party congress are the substantiation and develop-
 ment of the correct line of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
 Committee, which are based on a more profound understanding of the objec-
 tive laws of, and the more comprehensive summarization of the Chinese
 socialist modernization program.  In order to easily grasp the focal points
 and essence of the documents and arouse the participants to ponder problems,
 the focal points of the study of every part of the 12th party congress
 report have been pointed out and questions for deliberation have been set..
 The study class is run on the basis of widespread study with the aim of
 conducting the study intensively.  The provincial CPC committee demanded
 that the comrades who participate in the study thoroughly comprehend and
 grasp the major contents.and essence of the 12th party congress documents;
 and effectively unify their thinking in the spirit of the 12th party con-
 gress; earnestly sum up experiences and lessons in light of the realities;
 of specific affiliated organizations and departments; make earnest efforts
 to sum up experiences and lessons; and enhance revolutionary vigor and
 implement the series of guidelines and principles and policies formulated
 by the 12th party congress in an exemplary way.  Following this demand,
 the study class has laid particular attention on the following questions:
 1.   Understanding the correctness of the CPC's line, principles and poli-
 cies since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee.  All
 the participants hold that in acquiring an understanding of the great and
 historic change, of the fact that the present stage is one of the best
 historical stages since the founding of the PRC and of the unanimity of the
 spirit of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and of
 the 12th party congress, it is important to seek satisfactory solutions to
 understanding the correctness of the CPC's line, principles and policies
 worked out since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee.
 Reviewing the great changes which have taken place on various fronts and
 the course of the changes in their own thinking, the comrades attending the
 study class have profoundly felt that acquiring an early understanding of
 and achieving early and genuine unity in thinking in the CPC's line, prin-
 ciples and policies will produce the desired results early; having a late
 understanding of and achieving late and genuine unity in thinking will
 adversely affect the work.  One veteran comrade of the CPC committee of an
 organ at the provincial level said:   "Previously, I worried that the
 responsibility system would result in the practice of 'working alone.'
 Later, I made up my mind to go to the lower levels to see what had happened
 and was sincerely convinced by what I heard with my own ears from the
 masses while touring and inspecting many.places.   I was almost exhausted to
 illness, but I was cured of the 'illness' in my mind.  An important question
 of understanding has thus been solved."  In light of the profound changes
 in the four prefectures in northwestern' Shandong Province, such as Dezhou,
 Liucheng, Heze and Huimin, which have overcome being and and become pros-
 perous and made three big steps forward in 3 years, many leading comrades
 said that in the past,we became anxious at the mention of these four
 prefectures.  The provincial authorities sent work teams to help them many

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 times but the problems remained unsolved.  However, during the 3 years
 after the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and particu-
 larly by 1981, the total output of grain had increased by 440 million jin;
 that of cotton, by 480 percent; and the per capita distribution increased
 by more than 200 percent.  In 1982 there were again big increases in this
 respect.  In coming into their own, the four prefectures in northwestern
 Shandong Province depended on the correct line of the 3d Plenary Session
 of the 11th CPC Central Committee.  In the past some comrades had some
 worries and doubts about the spirit of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th
 CPC Central Committee and their problems were basically solved through the
 study of the "Resolution on Some Questions in the History of Our Party
 Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China."  It was through this
 study of the 12th party congress report that their problems were thoroughly
 solved.   Quite a few comrades have reported that people have "four
 unexpecteds" about the changes that have taken place. since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee:  1) They never expected the
 country to change so fast; 2) they never expected the country to change so
 much; 3) they never expected such real change; and 4) they never expected
 the country to change in such an orderly manner. Looking back at the
 changes in the country and making an appraisal of the CPC's line, the more
 we appraise it, the more correct it will be; looking back at the changes in
 the country and making an appraisal of the CPC Central Committee, the more
 we appraise it, the wiser it will be; and looking back at the changes in
 the country and making an appraisal of the four modernizations, the more we
 appraise them, the greater the hope we have.  All the participants have,
 through study, further understood that the great and historic. change since
 the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee is an absolutely
 true fact.   The fundamental reason for achieving this change lies in the
 correctness of the CPC's line, principles and policies.  In order to ful-
 fill the general task during the new stage, the leading bodies and leading
 cadres must take the lead in implementing in an exemplary way the correct
 program, principles and policies formulated by the 12th party congress.
 2.  Having confidence in quadrupling the annual gross value of industrial
 and agricultural production.   This is the question which everybody was most
 concerned with and discussed most enthusiastically.  At the beginning of
 study, there was a widespread lack of confidence in the realization of
 quadrupling output value.   In the course of study, the provincial CPC com-
 mittee paid attention to solving this problem by dealing with each case on
 its merits.   First, some comrades did not really know whether or not the
 quadrupling of output value could be realized due to a lack of understanding
 of the existing economic foundation and conditions of the whole province.
 For this reason, the study class invited responsible comrades in charge of
 the economic work to give guidance lectures and make an analysis of the
 conditions of Shandong Province.   Everyone came to realize, through such
 analysis, that in accordance with the requirements of quadrupling output
 value, the total output value of industry and agriculture throughout the
 province would increase to approximately 210 billion yuan by the year 2000
 on the basis of 52.3 billion yuan in 1980, or an average rate of 7.2 percent
 increase a year in the coming 20 years. The total output value of industry
 and agriculture of the province in the 32 years after the founding of the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 PRC showed a yearly increase of 8.7 percent.  Obviously, the quadrupling of
 output value is not impossible.  By making an analysis of the fairly sound
 material and technical foundation which we already had at hand and the
 favorable conditions for developing the economy, all the participants
 thought that we had good grounds for achieving an average annual increase
 of 7.2 percent.  Second, some comrades who worked in the economic depart-
 ments failed to see the potential for developing the economy because they
 proceeded from the existing conditions in energy and paid too rigid atten-
 tion to the figures in accounting books.   Therefore, the more they calcu-
 lated accounts, the more difficulties they saw and the lesser the confi-
 dence they had.                       For this reason, the provincial CPC committee demanded that
 we emancipate our minds, broaden our horizon and calculate active accounts.
 In particular, analysis of economic development since the 3d Plenary Session
 of the 11th CPC Central Committee has enabled all the participants to see
 the enormous potential for economic development.  After the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the total output value of indus-
 try and agriculture throughout the province increased at an average annual
 rate of 7.3 percent, significantly surpassing the average yearly increase
 of 4.4 percent in the previous 29 years; light industrial production
 increased at an average rate of 13.8 percent a year, also substantially
 exceeding the average yearly increase of 10.2 percent in the past 29 years.
 After its service orientation was readjusted, the production of heavy
 industry also increased.  The production of heavy industry in the first 8
 months of 1982 showed an increase of 7.8 percent over the same period in
 1981.   Many comrades have said that by exclusively calculating dead accounts
 no one could expect that production would have expanded so fast.   In the
 days to come, the CPC's correct principles and policies will take root even
 more in the hearts of the people, advanced science and technology will be
 popularized and applied at a faster pace and the potential for the develop-
 ment of production is still enormous.  Third, some units which fall into
 the category of strategic priority, such as coal and petroleum, had heavy
 responsibilities to undertake and great pressure to bear.  The provincial
 CPC committee emphatically helped the comrades of these departments to
 analyze their favorable conditions.  For example, previously, the provincial
 coal bureau paid too much attention to its difficulties.  But, through
 analyzing coal resources and the favorable conditions of Shandong Province,
 it came to realize that it would be entirely possible to realize a doubled
 output of coal by the year 2000.  The electrical power departments advanced
 that so long as their potential was brought into full play, annual electri-
 cal energy production by the year 2000 would possibly be over 400 percent
 more than in 1980.  The comrades on the fronts of science and technology as
 well as culture and education held that the 12th party congress had put
 science and education in the higher plane of strategic priority.   This was
 the first such endeavor ever made in all our party congresses and they were
 happy about it.   By comparing the requirements of the modernization program,
 they found where they lagged behind in work and thus enhanced their sense of
 responsibility and urgency.  Judged from the present situation, the leading
 cadres of the units directly affiliated to the provincial CPC committee have
 quite satisfactorily solved and achieved relative unity in confidence in the
 quadrupling of output value.

 3.   Building a socialist spiritual civilization with communist ideology as
 its core.  In the course of study, attention should be paid to the follow-
 ing three things:  First, we must acquire, from the higher plane of politics
 and theory, a better understanding of the importance and necessity of build-
 ing socialist spiritual civilization and enhance consciousness to grasp well
 the building of socialist spiritual civilization.  Through summing up our
 experiences and lessons, and in particular, through summing up the lessons
 in which there emerged such erroneous tendencies as "doing everything for
 the sake of money" as the result of some units neglecting the ideological
 and political work in the last few years, we must help all the participants
 realize that while building a high level of material civilization, we
 inevitably have to carry out the building of socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion.   If not, we will lose our bearings and not have the possibility to
 march ahead to the long-range objective of communism.   Second, we must have
 a correct understanding of the relationship between carrying forward the
 communist spirit and implementing the CPC's present principles and policies.
 Some comrades worry whether or not encouraging the communist spirit will
 deviate from reality.   Through study, everyone has come to realize that as
 a party member, from the very day he joins the party, he must foster the
 lofty ideal of communism and put into practice his pledge to struggle for
 the realization of communism.  Carrying forward the communist spirit is,
 therefore, the proper meaning of the subject, and moreover, implementing the
 CPC's present principles and policies in an exemplary way is a practical
 ;step in our endeavor to realize communism.   The two form an integral whole.
 The argument that sets the displaying of the communist spirit against the
 implementation of the CPC's principles and policies.is a method of approach-
 ing problems in a metaphysical way.   Third, we must stress that while
 building socialist spiritual civilization, we must prevent "leftist" things
 from gaining ground.  We had profound experience and lessons in this respect
 in the past.   It will not do to carry out the modernization program without
 paying attention to communist ideology, but we must not regard whatever can
 be done in the future as a reality. At present, particular efforts should
 be made to distinguish communism from egalitarianism and the practice of
 everybody eating "from the same big pot" and prevent some people from
 negating the effective principles and policies which have been implemented
 in recent years by taking advantage of spreading communist ideology.
 4.   Creating a new situation in the state of the spirit.   In the course of
 study, all the participants analyzed the incongruities between the present
 state of mind of the cadres and the modernization program, which find
 expression mainly in lack of the sense of responsibility and urgency; being
 satisfied with the existing state of affairs, not seeking to forge ahead
 and lacking the spirit of doing pioneering work; being "afraid" in con-
 fronting something, having no regard for principles and showing a serious
 lack of responsibility; the wane of revolutionary will and being seriously
 imbued, with individualist thinking; and in the indulgence of some unhealthy
 practices.  Many comrades dared to lay bare the ugliness in their innermost
 thoughts and to conduct self-criticism in light of their ideological reali-
 ties.   In particular, communist ideology--a thing which "gives oneself a
 lift"--was rightly grasped.   It was widely reported that the participants
 were shaken up a lot and, through study, they genuinely regained high

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 revolutionary aspirations and revolutionary enthusiasm.  Many comrades have
 showed that they should do what they say and from now on enhance revolu-
 tionary vigor, make a good start, set strict demands on themselves, and
 strive to stand before the party with a clear conscience when the day of
 the registration of party members comes.  Some veteran comrades have said
 with emotion:  "We old fellows are confronted with a test, that is, how to
 adopt a correct attitude toward ourselves.  We must not rack our brains on
 houses and positions, because when we die a natural death, we cannot carry
 our house to see Marx.  The only thing belonging to an individual is the
 people's evaluation  of his behavior during his lifetime.  Even if we leave
 a good name to posterity, we can, after all, see Marx without blushing and
 our heart throbbing in shame."  Some comrades who previously failed to
 understand why they should withdraw to the second line or completely retire
 have now been convinced through study.   They said:   "Making revolution as
 long as one lives does not mean holding lifelong posts.   Discard the word
 'I' and you will come round to everything."
 In terms of concrete organization and leadership and methods of study, we
 stressed the following' things:  1) Read the documents from beginning to end
 and thoroughly understand them.  Holding group discussions was also aimed at
 obtaining a deeper understanding of the documents.  Notes and outlines of
 speeches were encouraged.   2) Relate our study to the realities of our
 thinking and work.  Through study, everybody was encouraged to achieve a big
 leap in ideology, a new improvement in the work and a remarkable change in
 work style.   The provincial CPC committee has clearly pointed out that
 whether or not we can solve. our problems in light of actual conditions is
 an important indication of weighing up the quality and results of our study
 and also the key to carrying out our study intensively.  3) Do a good job
 in giving guidance in study.  We mainly adopted an elicitation method under
 which leading comrades talked about what they have learned in study and
 organized coaching teams to go right to the study groups to give the latter
 guidance in study in a manner of having an informed discussion.  4) Do a
 good job in organizational and leadership work.   In every term of the study
 class, the responsible comrades of the provincial CPC committee, the stand-
 ing committee of the provincial people's congress, the provincial govern-
 ment and the provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
 who took part in the study formed a leading group.   They participated in
 and offered leadership to the study.  In order to easily organize the study,
 the study class was divided into dozens of study groups according to the
 departments they are attached to and the responsible comrades of the vari-
 ous departments who took part in the study were appointed study group
 leaders.  The study class rigorously enforced study discipline, stipulated
 rules and regulations on asking for leave.  Those who are absent from study
 for a week should attend the study anew.  When a term of the study class is
 over, every study group writes a summary report on the study to the provin-
 cial CPC committee.   These measures have played-an important role in guaran-
 teeing and stimulating the running of the study class well.

 WILL VARIOUS LOCALITIES QUADRUPLE THE GROSS VALUE OF THEIR AGRICULTURAL
 OUTPUT BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 pp 46-47
 [Article by Zhou Dezhong [0719 1795 0022]]
 [Text] In the course of study, some comrades have raised a question, that
 is, will various localities quadruple the gross value of their agricultural
 output while realizing the objective of quadrupling the annual gross value
 of industrial and agricultural production throughout the country by the end
 of this century?
 The objective of quadrupling output value formulated by the 12th party
 congress is calculated according to the combined total output value of
 industry and agriculture rather than the separate total output value of
 industry and agriculture.  Whether or not the gross value of agricultural
 output should be quadrupled depends on our needs and capabilities, of which
 a concrete analysis should be made.
 As everybody knows, the harmonious development of industry and agriculture
 does not mean that industry and agriculture should go hand in hand.  We are
 now still constantly probing the problem of how to properly arrange the
 ratio between agriculture and light industry on the one hand and heavy
 industry on the other hand in accordance with the laws governing the
 socialist economic development of our country.  We have taken detours since
 the founding of the PRC.   Excessive priority was given to heavy industry
 and the growth rate of agriculture was low for some time in the past.   This
 resulted in imbalances in the national economy. Through a few years of
 readjustment, in the total output value of industry and agriculture in 1981,
 agriculture made up 30.9 percent and industry, 69.1 percent.   The ratio was
 leaning toward rationality.   In addition, industrial and agricultural pro-
 duction both have their own characteristics.   The course of the reproduc-
 tion of the agricultural economy and that of the reproduction of nature are
 integrated together.   Highly seasonal, agricultural production has a rather
 long production cycle and is significantly restricted and affected by
 environmental conditions, but there is not such a close relationship
 between the industrial economy and the environment.   Generally speaking,
 the growth rate of industry is higher than that of agriculture.   Seen from
 the rather long 1953-1981 period, China's gross value of agricultural

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 output showed an average yearly increase of 3.5 percent; that of industrial
 output, 10.8 percent, and the 2 constituted a 1:3 ratio.  This indicates
 that the increase of the output value of agriculture is a little slow when
 compared with industry.. The state has not demanded that the various
 localities throughout the nation quadruple the annual gross value of their
 agricultural output by the end of this century.  However, this does not
 mean that all the various localities cannot increase their output value.
 First, we must see that the vast rural areas of our country are undergoing
 a great change.   Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Con-
 mittee, the various policies which have enjoyed immense popular support,
 and in particular the introduction of the various forms of the production
 responsibility system, have put an end to the incongruities between the
 relations of production and the productive forces in the collective economy,
 brought about a new emancipation in the productive forces and a great
 upsurge in the enthusiasm for production by the masses of peasants.   In the
 3 years between 1979 and 1981, the total output value of agriculture
 increased at an.average rate of 5.6 percent, much higher than the average
 yearly increase of 3.5 percent recorded during the 1953-1981 period.  At
 present, changes have taken place in two ways in the rural economy:   One
 is the transformation from a self-supporting or semi-self-supporting
 economy to the increasingly developed commodity production and the other
 is the transformation from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture.
 We must fully realize that in the next nearly 20 years, with the reform of
 the economic system and economic structure in'the Chinese countryside, the
 agricultural production structure and layout will become more and more
 rational, advanced science and technology will be applied extensively and
 the agricultural productive forces will further expand.
 Second, we must still be clear about agriculture, including the farming
 industry, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery and
 the processing industry of farm produce and sideline products and others.
 Not only various industries have their own unique laws of development but
 the different sectors of the same industry also have their own charac-
 teristics.  We must therefore work out their growth rates in accordance
 with concrete conditions.   For example, grain production in'the farming
 industry between 1953 and 1980 showed an average yearly increase of 2.4
 percent; the total output of grain in 1980 amounted to 641.1 billion jin.
 If the average annual rate of increase in the first 10 years from 1981 is
 2 percent, and in the next decade is 2.1 percent, the total output of grain
 by the year 2000 will total.960 billion jin, or an increase of 50 percent
 within the next 20 years.   This demand cannot be considered high and can
 therefore be materialized or possibly even surpassed.   By the year 2000,
 there will be big increases in the production of most industrial crops,
 such as oil-bearing crops, sugar crops, tea and dried and fresh fruits, and
 meat, milk and aquatic products.  We must also see that China is very rich
 in land resources.  The existing cultivated land occupies only 1/10 of the
 total area of China's territory with the per capita rural population using
 no more than 2 mu.  Therefore, we must make an issue of the land all over
 the country, rather than set our eyes exclusively on the existing culti-
 vated land.  Apart from doing a good job in the farming industry, we must
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 simultaneously grasp forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations and
 fishery and vigorously chant the "scripture of land and sea."
 For quite some time, priority has been basically given to the production of
 raw material products in the rural areas of our country.  Transporting farm
 produce to the cities which are far from the producing areas and then being
 processed there has not only caused damage and waste to farm produce but
 also restricted the opportunity to employ rural workers and the compre-
 hensive utilization of farm produce.  In the days to come, we must grad-
 ually change this state of affairs and do our utmost to carry out rough
 machining or final machining of farm produce and sideline products on the
 spot or at the nearest convenient places and put them to multiple uses and
 thus achieve multiple increases in their value.   This will not only.solve
 the employment problem of the surplus rural labor power but will also
 increase social wealth.   This also means increasing the output value of
 agriculture.
 What we have mentioned above shows that taking the country as a whole, it is
 correct not to clearly define the demand of quadrupling the annual gross
 value of agricultural output.   The various localities should formulate
 their own objectives of struggle which are fit for the specific localities
 in the spirit of the 12th party congress and in a manner suited to local
 conditions.  Ours is a big country.  The natural and geographical condi-
 tions and the level of economic development of the various localities are
 not entirely the same and the leadership techniques of the leaders are also
 different.   Therefore, the agricultural growth rate of the various locali-
 ties cannot possibly be the same.   It is estimated that of the more than
 2,100 counties throughout the country, some counties, and in particular the
 existing counties which fall into the category of medium and low-yield
 counties, can quadruple their output value and even surpass that figure;
 on the other hand, due to various reasons, some counties may not be able
 to reach the objective of quadrupling their output value by the turn of this
 century.   In fact, over the last few years, there have emerged a batch of
 localities whose gross value of agricultural production has increased at a
 fairly fast pace.  For example, compared with 1978, in 1981, 43 counties in
 the northwestern regions of Shandong Province at least doubled their output
 value, and Xinyang Prefecture of Henan Province increased the total output
 value of its agriculture by 63 percent.   Compared with 1975, in 1981, the
 total agricultural output value of Ganquan County in Shaanxi Province
 increased by 144.8 percent and that of Yongqia County in Zhejiang Province
 by 102 percent and so on.   The experience of such advanced localities
 deserves our study.
 In order to quadruple output value, we must calculate accounts but we must
 not concentrate on making an issue of the word "calculation."  What is
 important at present is to make the objective of quadrupling output value
 the conscious demand and action of the masses.   The leaders must proceed
 from actual conditions, do the work in a down-to-earth manner and in par-
 ticular, with the county as the unit, draw up the plans for the development
 of the specific localities on the basis of the investigation of natural
 resources and the division of agriculture, seek effective ways for bringing
 into play the strong points in production of the specific localities and
 proceed to work out the measures which promise better economic results and
 to arouse the masses to work hard and do solid work.

 WHAT ARE ECONOMIC LEVERS AND HOW ARE THEY RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE
 MEASURES?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 pp 47-48
 [Article by Wang Jiye [3769 4480 2814]]
 [Text]   In order to effectively manage the national economy, we must not
 only adopt administrative measures but also put economic levers to use.   By
 economic levers, we mean such economic measures as pricing, profit, taxa-
 tion and credits which the state uses to affect and readjust social produc-
 tion, distribution, exchange and consumption.   The application of economic
 levers can encourage or restrict the production of some products and pre-
 vent some production units from concentrating on output value and profits
 at the expense of state plans and social needs.   In managing the economy
 with economic levers, the most important thing is that we must have a
 correct pricing policy and a correct tax policy.   For example, when the
 production of certain products is in excess of the normal market needs,
 apart from adopting mandatory planning to control such production, the
 state should readjust such production by means of such economic levers as
 pricing and taxation so as to strike a relative balance between production
 and demand.   Preferential treatment in terms of pricing and taxation should
 be granted to the enterprises which produce commodities which are in strained
 and short supply so as to encourage them to increase production and meet
 market needs. In this way, the enthusiasm of the enterprises for production
 can be guided in the direction of the requirements of state planning.
 In making use of economic levers, attention should be paid to the following
 things:   First, the application of economic levers has a bearing on the
 material interests of the state, the production units and the working
 people.   Effective use of economic levers can help the production units and
 the working people be more concerned about the operation and management of
 enterprises, raise product quality, stress economic results, fulfill the
 tasks of state plans in an overall manner and develop the socialist
 economy at a faster pace, but misuse of economic levers can also affect the
 material interests of the production units and their workers, dampen their
 enthusiasm for production and finally do harm to the development of the
 whole socialist economy.   Second, in readjusting production with economic
 levers, we must pay close attention to the flexible use of economic levers
 in light of concrete conditions.   For example, when some products have

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 changed from not meeting the demand to supply exceeding demand, some cor-
 responding alterations should be made in the existing economic measures
 which are designated for increasing production.  When we say that we must
 be flexible in making use of economic levers, we mean apply them in a
 flexible way within certain limits and under the guidance of state planning,
 rather than breaking away from state planning.   If we do not, we are bound
 to be operating blindly.  Third, since various economic levers interact
 with each other, while putting them to use, we must link one with another
 and put them under unified control and disposal according to the require-
 ments of state planning.                      For example, we must not encourage increasing
 production in terms of pricing on the one hand and restrict production by
 means of credits and taxation on the other hand, and vice versa.
 By administrative measures, we mean that administrative leading bodies
 manage the economy by means of economic decrees, economic policies and
 mandatory planning, and the transmission of tasks to the lower levels.
 In the economic life of our country, administrative measures are divided
 into three categories:  The first category consists of the administrative
 measures which have legal effect.   These include the laws governing economic
 planning, capital construction, pricing control, tax, the borrowing or lend-
 ing of money, the opening and closing of enterprises, economic contracts
 and so on.   The second category consists of the administrative measures
 which have a binding force.   For example, mandatory planning in management
 planning has final authority and a binding force.  The planning units and
 units responsible for executing plans at various levels must strictly
 observe and resolutely implement mandatory planning and ensure its ful-
 fillment.   The third category consists of the administrative measures of a
 policy character, such as the related economic policies stipulated by the
 state for practicing regulation by market mechanism.
 Fundamentally speaking, administrative measures and economic levers form an
 integral whole which is manifested in the following things:  First, in the
 objective of planning.   Both administrative measures and economic levers
 are put under state unity and application and must serve the operating of
 the planned economy.   Second, in economic bases.   In order to manage the
 economy in an effective and lively way, while adopting administrative
 measures and economic levers, we must have economic bases and act in
 compliance with the objective economic laws and pay full attention, in
 some circumstances, to the natural laws.   Third, in realizing the harmony
 of the interests of the state, the collective and the individual.  Being
 able to concurrently apply administrative measures and economic levers to
 the correct handling of the interests of the state, the collective and
 the individual is a major strong point of the socialist economy.
 There also exist contradictions between administrative measures and economic
 levers.   Concrete manifestations of such contradictions are as follows:
 The contradiction between centralization and decentralization.  In making
 use of administrative measures to manage the economy, it is relatively easy
 to practice centralized and unified management.   However, centralization
 must be appropriate and conducive to arousing the enthusiasm of all sides

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100450001-8
 concerned.  Managing the economy with economic levers is relatively right
 for proper decentralization.  If everything is handled by means of admin-
 istrative measures in a unified way, there will be limited room for making
 use of economic levers.  However, excessive decentralization and laying too
 much stress on economic levers can give rise to blindness, be harmful to
 the overall planned arrangements and even affect state plans.  We must sum
 up our historical experience and strive to seek a rational demarcation line
 between centralization and decentralization.
 The contradiction between unity and flexibility.   To adopt administrative
 measures to manage the economy, we must coordinate all the activities of
 the nation like moves on a chessboard.  For this reason, we must make
 satisfactory arrangements for the whole national economy, strictly control
 through planning the large-scale key enterprises and the important products
 which are vital to the national economy and the people's livelihood so as to
 ensure that the strong points of the whole economy can be brought into play
 and have a stable development strategy for the economy and society and make
 a rational distribution of the economy.  However, with the exclusive adop-
 tion of administrative measures, we very often fail to give consideration
 to the complexity of and differences in practical economic work.  Making
 use of economic levers to manage the economy requires flexibility and rela-
 tively easily suits the complicated and changeable situation in the economic
 work, but it is hard to practice centralized and unified management.
 The contradiction between relative stability and timely changeability.
 Managing the economy with administrative measures has the characteristic
 of relative stability.  This is because the arrangements of overall impor-
 tance cannot be changed.  However, social production and social needs are
 constantly changing.   The factors affecting such a change are multifaceted,
 and moreover, mingled with one another, they perform a function in such a
 change.  Economic levers are characterized by flexibility and changeability
 and can thus make up for deficiencies in this respect.  However, over-
 emphasizing economic levers is invariably apt to deviate from the course
 of the planned economy.   So the application of economic levers should
 serve the needs of the overall situation and the unified planned arrange-
 ments.  From a certain point of view, making use of some economic levers
 may be rational but from an overall point of view, consideration should be
 given to the capabilities of state financial strength and the influence
 upon the people's livelihood.
 It is no easy thing to organically integrate administrative measures with
 economic levers.   Our shortcomings in the.past were that our administrative
 measures lacked sufficient economic bases and furthermore the errors in
 some policy decisions resulted in excessively rigid control over the
 economy, and all this was not in conformity with the complicated economic
 activities and the fast-changing market demands.   Therefore, administrative
 measures should be perfected and well coordinated with each other.  That is
 also the case with economic levers.  Economic levers must link one with
 another and must also be well coordinated with administrative measures.

 Making use of administrative measures and economic levers to manage the
 economy is aimed, in the final analysis, at correctly handling the rela-
 tionships among the three--the state, the collective and the individual.
 Fundamentally speaking, in our country, the interests of the three are
 identical but contradictions also exist between them.  This kind of con-
 tradiction finds expression in the contradiction between partial and local
 interests and the interests of the whole and between immediate interests
 and long-term interests.  When a situation emerges in which overemphasizing
 partial and local interests and immediate interests has affected the
 interests of the whole and long-term interests, we must make more use of
 administrative measures so as to help subordinate partial and local inter-
 ests to the interests of the whole and subordinate immediate interests to
 long-term interests.  When there emerges a situation in which overempha-
 sizing the interests of the whole and long-term interests has interfered
 with partial and local interests and immediate interests, we must make more
 use of economic levers so as to integrate overall and long-term interests
 with partial and local interests and immediate interests.  When the economic
 development meets with difficulties and setbacks and results in structural
 disproportions in the national economy, we must put more stress on cen-
 tralized and unified management and carry out an overall readjustment
 mainly by administrative measures, but at the same time not neglect the
 role of economic levers.   In a situation in which the whole national
 economy is quite satisfactorily arranged and the economy develops rather
 smoothly, we must bring into fuller play the role of economic levers while
 perfecting the existing administrative measures.  The general principle is
 to integrate economic levers with administrative measures, combine cen-
 tralized and unified management with the mobilization of the initiative of
 the enterprises and the working people, practice the principle of small
 freedoms under a big plan, strive to grasp what is important and let go our
 hold on what is less important, bring about a situation in which there
 should be control but not rigidity and liveliness but not chaos and ensure
 the healthy growth of the socialist economy.

 STOP BEING 'SU MOLENGS'
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 1, 1 Jan 83 inside back cover
 [Article by Yu Shi [7183 2514]]
 [Text] The Chinese phrase "moleng liangke," or being ambiguous, was per-
 haps an art practiced in officialdom through the ages.  For example, as
 early as in the Han dynasty, there was this popular saying among offi-
 cials:                     "Do not be explicit; thrive on being ambiguous." A prime minister
 in the Gang dynasty called Su Weidao, who "behaved in a flattering and
 ingratiating manner," often said to others:   "In our approach to things, we
 should not express ourselves in clear-cut terms.   Rather, we should use
 doubletake."  Therefore, people at that time called him "Su Moleng."  By
 acting this way and following this "good formula for being an official,"
 some people, of course, kept out of trouble, preserved their jobs and
 prospered.  They muddled along, but ended up being the object of universal.
 condemnation and a target for ridicule throughout history.
 Communist cadres do not want to be officials.   They want to serve the
 people.   Therefore, there is no need for the art practiced in officialdom.
 But there is a need for skills and courage in serving the people.  Our
 attitude toward people and things should be put in the clear-cut terms of
 "yes" or "no," stern and serious, and indisputable.   It should in no way
 be ambiguous and equivocal.   However, there is no lack of people among the:
 ranks of our cadres who delight in being "Su Molengs."  There can be no
 other reason for this but a lack of skills and a lack of courage.
 So-called courage means that we should do whatever is good for the party
 and for the people and strive to achieve what should be done in a struggle.
 On the other hand, we should resist what is not good for the party and the
 people's cause in a struggle.  No matter who a person is, we must not
 repeat like a parrot what he says when he has said the wrong things or done
 bad deeds.  In fact, some of our comrades are not so muddleheaded that they
 cannot distinguish between right and wrong and cannot see where the crux of
 a problem lies.  They are hard put to broach a given subject in their talk
 and are weak and lethargic in their approach to things, chiefly because they
 lack courage.   They lack the spirit of being responsible to the party and
 the people and the spirit of making self-sacrifices.   They have too much to
 think of and great worries that bother them.   They are afraid of offending

 their superiors, of making themselves unpopular among colleagues and of
 losing votes in an election!  Therefore, they take an ambiguous approach
 to things and sacrifice principle.  The root of what is wrong with these
 people lies in their lack of spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people.
 It is quite natural that they do not win the confidence of the masses.
 In many situations, a person's lack of a clear-cut view also has to do with
 a lack of actual knowledge and a lack of an understanding of a relevant
 subject.   In spite of this, he may still assume airs and not show the least
 spirit of being humble "primary school pupils."  He just plays along not
 knowing what's what.   Or he makes believe that he knows the ropes.   In his
 talk, he keeps you guessing as to what should or should not be done.  Many
 things are thus held up, because things are put in vague terms.  A lot of
 precious time is wasted.   Therefore, to really do something for the people,
 we must seriously do some reading and learn something about useful skills.
 The best way is to take time out and set about making some systematic
 investigations and studies in the real world.   Only by enriching our
 knowledge can we gradually extricate ourselves from the plight in which we
 have found ourselves.   And only in this way can we think out ways and means
 in our approach to things.
 Being ambiguous is a decadent, vulgar and easygoing style.   Communist
 cadres should think out ways and means.   They must have guts to hold them-
 selves responsible to the people and the party and have the knowledge or
 ability to serve the people and the party's work.   They must combine
 courage and knowledge, and dare to act and to hold themselves responsible.
 At any time, they must "express themselves clearly in getting along with
 other people" and become guides in action and examples to be followed.   In
 no way may they fall into the bad style of a declining class which calls
 for being ambiguous and shirking responsibility.   In those revolutionary
 war years, being ambiguous and letting a good opportunity slip away was
 likely to cost a person his life.   So, all people did not dare to be "Su
 Molengs."  Now, in times of peaceful construction, though our lives may
 not be endangered, if we do nothing and remain indifferent, our cause will
 also suffer, as things go on.
