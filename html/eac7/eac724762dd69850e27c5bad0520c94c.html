 Government is "under heavy pressure" to recognize Communist
 China immediately and that he felt the move is imminent. Many
 regime officials are sympathetic to the Chinese Communists. Cu-

 recently had two audiences with Mao Tse-tung. According to the
 New China News Agency, Galvez said in Peiping on 12 May that the
 Cuban people want to intensify their "intimate relationship" with the
 Chinese people and to unite with them "in o  ositon to the im eri-
 alists of the US:'

 British- controlled territories are returned to the Union.  The

 agitation.
 New Zealand: [Prime Minister Nash's 13 May statement
 that he Commonwealth conference in London generally recog-
 nized "the early need for Chinese participation in. disarmament
 measures" suggests that he may be contemplating recognition o
 Communist China, partly to fulfill a pledge of the Labor party
 1957 platform, before the next elections in November. Nash,
 however, would presumably seek some prior consultation with
 New Zealand's principal allies, inasmuch as he considers recog-
 nition a question of timing, and would seek to avoid any timing
 damaging. to Western prestige.]

 Soviet=Iraqi Relations Continue Slow Decline
 The USSR and Iraq are "not as close as they were a few
 months ago" and Soviet leaders are increasingly less well dis-
 osed toward Qasim,
 is
 conclusion is in line with growing signs that; while Moscow and
 Baghdad remain officially on good terms ana bloc aid programs
 have not been affected, relations have slowly declined as a re-
 suit of the Qasim regime's moves against Iraq's Communists and
 indications that Baghdad would like to improve its ties with the
 West.  The visit to Iraq of First Deputy Premier Mikoyan in
 early April failed to counter these trends.
 Moscow is particularly irritated over Qasim's efforts to split
 Communist ranks by his continued backing of a splinter group
 which was licensed in February as the "Communist party of Iraq."
 This group, which is having difficulty in developing even a rudi-
 mentary political machine, was recently given a six-month ex-
 tension to fulfill Iraqi legal requirements for calling a party con-
 vention.  The Qasim government has also continued to refuse to
 give recognition to the Moscow=backed Communists as a legal
 party.

 During the past few weeks Qasim has placed anti---
 Communist officers in command of several air force squadrons, and
 the influence of the pro-Communist commander of the air force,
 Brig. Jalal. al-Awgati, has been curtailed.  Baghdad has also re-
 cently allowed two anti.-Communist papers, which had been previ-
 ously closed down, to resume publication.                         Both are strenuously

 Turkish Internal Situation
 The prestige of Tuirkish Prime Minister Menderes' regime
 is reported at an all-time low in Istanbul, and articulate opin-
 ion now is described as "universally anti-Menderes." Opposi-
 tion elements in the Republican People's party (RPP), the press,
 and the universities, according to the American consul general
 in Istanbul, are confident of their ability to resist and ultimate-
 ly defeat the government.
 Meanwhile, business is reported at a standstill in Istanbul,
 with businessmen uncertain about the future and general services
 totally dependent on continuation of martial law.  The city's re-
 turn to normal police control, the reopening of the universities,
 or the re-establishment of a relatively free press would result
 in new and probably more violent disorders, according to the
 consul general.
 The army on the surface.is maintaining its traditional role
 of aloofness from internal politics, but there are increasingly
 frequent reports of intervention by senior army officers to
 restrain the police or government from excessively repressive
 measures.  Many junior and middle-grade army officers, de-
 scribed as economically dissatisfied are believed sympathetic
 to the opposition.

 South Africa to Continue Authoritarian Policies
 The South African Government apparently intends to main-
 tain its present authoritarian policy, despite mounting criticism
 within the country's white community. In parliament on 16 May,
 Justice Minister Erasmus refused to yield to vociferous opposi-
 tion demands that the seven-week-old state of emergency be
 lifted. He said that 157 Communists were behind the recent dis-
 turbances and that 20 of these leaders had escaped to neighboring
 British- controlled territories. He said that the emergency regu-
 lations would remain in effect at least until the agitators were re-
 turned to the Union for trial.
 Conservative members of the ruling Nationalist party have
 renewed their campaign to establish closer control over the op=-
 position press. A leading Nationalist member of parliament
 warned on 16 May that the government "will have to be prepared
 either to close down newspapers or at least summon those re-
 sponsible for them and tell them what is expected of them a'  This
 statement brought an immediate denial. from Interior Minister
 Naude, a relatively moderate Nationalist.
 Although Prime Minister Verwoerd may move to moderate
 some of the harsher aspects of apartheid when he resumes lead-
 ership of the government, the Nationalists have shown no indica-
 tion of letting up in their drive to suppress the "agitators and
 gangsters" whom they consider responsible for the riots last
 March. Since conservative Nationalists usually characterize
 the opposition press and relatively liberal political parties as
 "agitators," pressure on these groups may be increased. In ad-
 dition, the American Embassy in Cape. Town notes an increasing
 tendency-typified by Erasmus' 16 May statement.- to blame the
 recent disturbances on Communist agitation.

 New Zealand Prime Minis er Possibly Considering Recognition
 Of Red China
 [New Zealand Prime Minister Nash's 13 May statement that
 the Commonwealth conference in London generally recognized
 the need for Communist China's participation in disarmament
 measures suggests that he may plan, before New Zealand's na-
 tional election in November, to fulfill a pledge in the labor
 party's 1957 platform to recognize the Peiping regime.  He
 stated that the policy of keeping China "at arms length is one
 of diminishing returns and may not be in the best interests of
 our peace and security..... "
 [Nash may feel that such a move would lessen current East-
 West tensions, at least in the disarmament field. During his
 visit to the USSR in April, Nash praised Khrushchev's disarma-
 ment policies, and his generally laudatory comments on the
 Soviet internal situation, raised considerable speculation in
 Wellington that he might follow up his trip with a policy shift
 toward :Peiping]
 Although there is comparatively little opposition in New
 Zealand. toward either recognition of Communist China or its
 admission to the UN, Nash has justified postponement of the
 move as a. question of timing and in deference to the United
 States' position. Responsible New Zealand officials have re-
 peatedly asserted that Nash would take no steps without prior
 consultation with New Zealand's principal allies, and the prime
 minister presumably would be reluctant to take. action damag-
 ing Western prestige following upon the collapse of the summit
 conference.

 South Vietnam
 [The Diem regime, despite a show of unconcern, realizes
 that the much-publicized "manifesto" for democratic reforms
 issued in Saigon last month by a group of former officials and
 civic leaders could lead to more serious criticism.  The gov-

 prestige, while seeking; to stigmatize its critics before popu-

 has decided on an organizational program designed to assure
 their loyalty. At the same time, under the pretense of protect-

 already arrested a number of youths suspected of antigovern-

 inspired." Stressing that the group's press conference was
 held before "foreign journalists" in a "foreign hotel"--Air
 France's elegant Caravelle in Saigon--editorials in progovern-
 ment papers have warned that this reliance on foreigners
 would lead to loss of Vietnamese sovereignty if the group had
 power Ji
 The government apparently is considering more direct re-
 pression of the group, 'which has just applied for registration
 as a legal opposition party.  Ngo Dinh Nhu, President Diem's
 brother and political adviser, has described the group's pub-
 lic criticism as illegal, and has stated that the government has
 little choice but to app]ly the law.  Thus far, however, the gov-
 ernment has maintained an official silence on the matter, with
 Diem taking stock of international reaction- -particularly Ameri-
 can- -before showing his hand.  In a rare presidential press
 conference held recently, Diem stated that "critics are always
 acceptable provided they are fair and impartial,"
