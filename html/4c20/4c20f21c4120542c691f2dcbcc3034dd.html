FOREWORD 
This issue of International Communism is devoted 
to a review of 1958 developments in the communist move-
ment outside communist-held countries. A single exception 
to this scheme is the inclusion of a special article on 
East Germany which was thought appropriate in view of the 
Soviet move to end the quadripartite arrangement" for 
Berlin. The "Introduction" contains some general remarks 
on the degree of success that attended Soviet attempts to 
re-establish control over the communist movement, and the 
section on the "International Front Organizations" deals 
with their major undertakings and their efforts to escape 
from behind the iron curtain. The major part of the 
review is devoted to fairly detailed analysis of the 
national communist parties, following the area breakdown 
indicated in the table of contents. For the convenience 
of the reader, an index of countries appears at the end 
of the report. A review of 1958 developments in the 
Asian communist-controlled countries will appear in the 
next issue of International Communism. A largely statisti-
cal report on the membership and voting strength of the 
communist parties will be issued as IR-4489R11: World  
Strength of Communist Party glaaniz.Itigaq, December 1958. 
And finally, IR-7927 will summarize 1958 developments 
in the Soviet Union and Eastern European communist states.

RETROSPECT 1958 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Any review of the international communist movement 
for a twelve month period is bound to present a static 
and therefore distorted picture. The construction of a 
"balance sheet" of communist gains and losses, however 
justifiable analytically, tends to obscure the dynamics 
of the movement and the divergent tendencies which have 
temporarily been overshadowed by compromise. The precise 
delineation of the point at which the communist movement 
has found its equilibrium in the past year is of utmost 
importance; just as important and more difficult to ap-
praise are those trends within the communist movement 
which have been submerged but which may come to the 
surface again and modify the structure and policies of 
international communism, as they have indeed been 
modified since the death of Stalin. 
Within this context the most significant develop-
ment in the communist movement as a whole was the re-
establishment of the prestige of 
SOVIET PRIMAT/ the Soviet communist party and 
REAFFIRMED the solidification of its basic 
organizational and doctrinal 
positions. The leading role of 
the Soviet Union was explicitly reaffirmed at the meeting 
of communist parties in Moscow held in November 1957 
during the 40th anniversary celebt'ation, and the "basic 
laws" applicable to communist parties everywhere were 
embodied in a declaration adopted by the communist state 
pgities. These "laws" bear repeating because they are 
the touchstone of current communistcorthodoxy; tampering 
with these laws in the name of national exceptionalism 
invites the charge of "revisionism," communism's chief 
bugaboo during 1958: 
The leading role of the party in effecting the 
revolution; 
The establishment of the dictatorship of the 
proletariat;

Alliance of the working class and the peasantry; 
Public ownership of the basic means of production; 
Socialist reconstruction of agriculture; 
Planned economy; and 
Proletarian internationalism. 
So intent was Moscow during 1958 to secure the unqualified 
allegiance of the communist parties (the anti-revisionist 
campaign) that it no more hesitated to drive out an as-
sociate of long-standing on the charge of revisionism 
(Axel Larsen of the Danish Communist Party) than to break 
once more with Tito for his refusal to accept the Soviet 
position on the nature of "imperialism," the leading 
role of the Soviet Union, and on the transition from 
capitalism to socialism. By the end of 1958 the "revision-
ists" had all been expelled or isolated not without some 
cost to the movement, particularly in Western Europe and 
North America; Moscow appeared to be firmly in control 
again.. 
The new orthodoxy is Stalinist in content but not 
in form or spirit. Or to put it paradoxically, the new 
,o:ethadoxy merely conceals and 
THE CHANGING almost sanctions heterodoxy. 
NATURE OF When Stalin was alive, obedience 
ORTHODOXY was on the line and control over 
the satellites was virtually 
direct. Today, under changed 
conditions, complete control of the communist areas from 
China to Albania and Yugoslavia is impossible to maintain. 
Reflecting the new geopolitical condition as well as 
internal Soviet conditions, the position of the U.S.S.R. 
as the head of the Communist Bloc -- 'which it, of course, 
still is for good military and economic reasons -- has 
undergone some perceptible change. 
Specifically, in contrast to the ironhanded rule 
over the Eastern European countries in the late 40's 
and early 50's, the present Soviet leadership refrains, 
for reasons of intra-bloc harmony, from dictating the 
timing and pace of collectivization and industrialization 
to the Polish Communists. Indeed, as far as China is 
concerned, the Soviet leaders stand by with scarcely

concealed distaste while Mao Tse-tung introduces new 
social institutions complete with new ideological 
trimmings. What is developing, therefore, precisely at 
the time that a new campaign has been successfully waged 
to secure ideological conformity and renewed expression 
of loyalty to the Soviet Union, is a de facto "revisionism" 
that will inevitably alter the pattern of inter-communist 
relationships and of the social institutions which have 
become identified with "communism." To put this another 
way, communist parties will be permitted considerable 
latitude in internal affairs if their loyalty to the 
Soviet Union is unquestioned and their essential orthodoxy 
beyond reproach. The most loyal of parties, the Chinese 
Communist, has not hesitated to set forth theories dia-
metrically opposed to the Soviet or to institute the 
commune" as a form of social organization that goes 
beyond anything devised in the Soviet European orbit. It 
is within the realm of possibility that had the Yugoslav 
Communists agreed to acknowledge the leading role of the 
Soviet Unij:m, other differences between the two countries 
could have been compromised; certainly the Soviet leaders 
would not have risked a break in relations over the 
Yugoslav's pet domestic institution -- the workers' 
councils. 
All this is to say that the Soviet-enforced 
orthodoxy within the international communist movement 
occupies today a restricted area by comparison to the 
Stalin period. What matters is solidarity with the 
U.S.S.R. against the West. If this solidarity is mani-
fested, much that would formerly not have been tolerated 
will be overlooked. Polish decollectivization is the 
bet example. In a word, the disturbances of 1956 have 
left behind a lasting effect. The U.S.S.R. has accepted 
the necessity to pay a price -- in terms of greater 
domestic autonomy for its satellites -- for the eturn 
to international orthodoxy which it successfully imposed 
in 1957. This distinction between international central-
ism and domestic autonomy is necessarily less clear for 
the communist parties out of power since they are not 
in a position to translate whatever peculiar national 
predilections some of them may have into government 
policy.

Just as the concept of natioLaJ roads to socialism 
appears to be gathering substance precisely at the moment 
the general and universal (that 
CtNTRALIZATION VS. is, Soviet) guidelines are being 
AUTONOMY IN INTER- stressed, so too has a decentral-
PARTY RELATIONS ized form of inter-party co-
operation won out over the pressure 
to centralize and coordinate the 
communist Tovement more effectively. The Cominform had 
been founded in 1947 to repair the lines of communication 
that had been disrupted by the war. Unlike the Comintern, 
the member parties were European: the communist state 
parties (with the exception of Albania) and the French 
and Italian Communist Parties. The composition of the 
Cominform reflected the twin policy objectives of the 
Soviet Union: consolidation of the_Eastern European 
countries and defeat of the Marshall Plan. For the 
guidance of the communist movement as a whole, the Comin-
form published a weekly paper called For a Las_ting Peace, 
For a js Democracy!. 
This weekly was .the only tangible_ evidence 
of the Cominform's existence from 1949 to 1956: the 
Tito-Stalin rift had destroyed any other usefulness 
the Cominform may have had. When Khrushchev dissolved 
the Cominform in 1956, in a gesture to Tito and to the 
spirit of the 20th CPSU Congress in general, he was not 
sacrificing much; nevertheless he took this decision 
with some reluctance -- or so it seemed. His reluctance 
was soon justified when the controversy in the communist 
movement precipitated by the 20th CPSU Congress and 
the Hungarian revolt demonstrated the need for a new 
coordinating mechanism. The Soviet Communists, sup-
ported by others (the Czechs and Germans) apparently 
wanted to establish a new organization; the other 
extreme (the Poles and Italians) argued that bilateral 
contacts were sufficient. The compromise that emerged 
in 1958 was an agreement to shelve the idea of a new 
organization and instead to hold bilateral and multi-
lateral conferences and to publish a,new journal. 
(It is interesting to note Ebert's "/E,P.,7 comment on 
the November 1957 conference of the communist state 
parties in Moscow that this was the "...first time in 
two decades that such comprehensive deliberations were 
held" -- that is, since the Seventh Comintern Congress 
in 1935). The journal, Pl'oblems of Peacl and Socialism 
(English edition called World Marxist Review: Problems 
CONFIDENTIAL 
CONFIDENTIAL 5 
of Peace and Socialism) published monthly in Prague, 
beginning with the September 1958 issue, in 16 languages 
also appears to be something of a compromise. Denying 
that the journal's purpose is to issue directives, the 
Communists have said it would be devoted to theoretical 
and informational matters and, indeed, this 100-odd 
page monthly magazine is unlike either the Comintern's 
International Press Correspondence or the Cominform's 
For a Lasting Peace, For a People's Ihmiluagyi. The 
four 1958 issues contain nothing that could be clearly 
labelled "directives" nor do they contain anything that 
could be recognized as theory or theoretical discussion. 
The closest approximation was Novotny's lead article on 
revisionism in the maiden issue which was cut and dried. 
Undoubtedly the journal under the editorship of A.M. 
Rumantsev, former chief editor of the Kommunist, will 
stand as a temptation to the Soviet leaders, but as of 
now it represents a compromise between the centralists 
and the autonomists. 
In writing our annual report this year we were as-
sisted by one B. Ponomarev -- unwittingly on his part 
who wrote an appreciation for 
THE SOVIET APPRAISAL Kommunist of the international 
OF INTERNATIONAL communist movement one year after 
COMMUNISM DURING the Conferences of the Communist 
1958 Parties in Moscow, November 1957 
(Kommunist, No. 15, October 1958). 
Stating that everything was good 
and getting better, he nevertheless conceded the stale-
mated and losing position of the communist parties in 
the western capitalist countries. For this he offered 
compensation through what might be called the law of 
the uneven development of communism: the admitted losses 
in Western Europe are offset by the development of the 
communist movement "on a much wider front than previous-
ly" and by the fact that "new centers of the revolutionary 
movement are constantly being created." Ponomarev has 
Latin America in mind where new conditions of freedom 
have permitted certain communist parties to make a 
comeback, and also the "East where the Syrian and 
Iraqi Communists have shown an unpredicted strength. 
It is also true that 1958 was notable for the 
general accretion of communist influence throughout 
the Far East, primarily as a result of the growing 
strength of Communist China as a national power and the 
weakness and division of noncommunist elements in many

countries. The activities of individual communist 
parties also added to the rosy picture presented by 
Ponomarev, principally in Indonesia where the Communist 
Party further solidified its position and in Laos where 
the legalized status of the Neo Lao Hak Xat enabled it 
to exploit the weakness of Lao' proximity to North 
Vietnam. In a formal sense it can be said that communist 
gains here "compensate" for the disaster the French 
Communists suffered at the polls. 
On the whole Ponomarev's analysis tells us nothing 
new: it is however important as corroboration of intel-
ligence analysis which pointed to the shift of Soviet 
strategy three years ago tomaprd the underdeveloped areas 
and away from the stalemated West. This shift has been 
carried on largely at the diplomatic level with the com-
munist parties trying to get into step with the national-
ist movements all along the way. As 1958 drew to a close 
there was every indication that the underdeveloped areas 
would continue to be a foremost target of Sino-Soviet 
diplomacy but there was somekvidence that the communist 
parties were being (Jelled upon to pursue a more active 
role as a result of'the Soviet Union's involvement in 
the Middle East where it found itself, as the Western 
powers before it, forced to make choices between rival 
J?trab leaders_. The Soviet Union's wholehearted support 
to Nasir as the embodiment of Arab nationalism was being 
replaced by selective support to Arab leaders in order 
to encourage the anti-Nasir Arab nationalist elements, 
particularly in Syria and Iraq. Nasir's close cooperation 
with the Soviet Union had since 1955 been rewarded by 
local communist cooperation. As a result of the Soviet 
policy shift, the communist parties are now being called 
upon to play an active role in the opposition to Nasir's 
policies. In the language of communist strategy, they 
are shifting from their undifferentiated support of the 
national bourgeoisie" against "foreign imperialism" to 
concentration on the "democratic" aspects of the national 
liberation struggle, that is, to achieving the pre-
conditions for the establishment of "socialism."

II. INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST FRONT ORGANIZATIONS 
7 
The international communist front organizations 
during 1958 actively pressed their current propaganda 
themes of anticolonialism, peace, and opposition to 
U.S. imperialism (when directed to Asian, African, and 
Latin American targets), and of nonpolitical desire for 
coexistence and nuclear disarmament (when dealing with 
the West). To extend their influence with the first 
group and allay the suspicions of the second, the "fronts" 
made increased efforts to expand activities of regional 
scope and to regain lost privileges or establish new 
rights to hold meetings or locate organizational head-
quarters outside the Soviet Bloc. In so doing they made 
certain demands that posed difficult political problems 
for governments neutral by treaty or tradition, or 
neutralist in sympathy, and evoked an unusual amount of 
official sand press dommentary on front organization 
tactics. 
In 1954 the Austrian Minister of Interior, 
protesting against the settlement in Vienna of the World 
Peace Council (WPC) under 
Soviet protection and with-
out permission of the Austrian 
Government, observed that 
"Vienna is becoming more and 
mre established as the head-
quarters of Cominform organizations plotting to undermine 
the free West." After regaining their independence, the 
Austrians succeeded in expelling from Vienna the head-
quarters of the World Federation bf Trade Unions (WFTU), 
the World Federation of Teachers Unions (FISE), and the 
World Peace Council (although the WPC continued to operate 
under the cover name "International Institute for Peace"). 
Only two front organizations -- the International Federa-
tion of Resistance Fighters (FIR) and (probably) the 
International Medical Association (formerly the World 
Congress of Doctors) -- were officially located in Vienna 
at the beginning of 1958. During the year, however, the 
identification of the International Institute for Peace 
(IIP) with the WPC became increasingly open, and a member 
of the WPC secretariat has stated that the organization's 
headquarters will be in Vienna in the future -- though 
presumably not formally known as such. A similar remark

has been attributed to a member of the secretariat of the 
World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY); the Federation 
is said to be planning seriously to move from Budapest to 
Vienna or Helsinki, the first choice being Vienna. (No 
confirmation of this report had appeared by December 1958.) 
The Austrian Government expressed willingness to have the 
WPC's Congress for Disarmament and International Cooperation 
meet in Vienna (the Congress actually convened in Stockholm 
in July 1958), and agreed to play host to the 1959 Seventh 
World Youth and Student Festival, sponsored by the WFDY and 
the International Union of Students (IUs) -- the first of 
the biennial Festivals to be held outside the Soviet bloc. 
Pressure has been put on Austria because the country 
is bound by Its 1955 State Treaty to observe complete 
impartiality in its foreign policy, a situation interpreted 
by the Austrian Communist Party organ Volkstimme as 
"neutral Austria's mission to act as a link between nations." 
In December 1957 representations were made by front organ-
ization functionaries to the Austrian Ministries of Interior 
and Foreign Affairs, to inquire whether the government 
would permit a WPC congress *an disarmament and international 
understanding to be held in Vienna in 1958, and also agree 
to harbor the 1959 Festival, The Council of Ministers 
decided in February 1958 to accept the WPC meeting, provided 
it would do nothing to compromise Austrian neutrality; but 
since the WPC regarded Vienna as second choice to Stockholm 
as the site, no formal WPC request appears to have been 
made. On the other hand, the "prior consent" of the 
Austrian Governmeht to holding the Festival, given in spite 
of the announced opposition of the People's Party's 
Austrian Youth Movement and of the Vienna City Council, was 
welcomed by the Festival sponsors in March. Chancellor Raab 
told the International Preparatory Committee (IPC) for the 
Festival that the government would have no objection (al-
though the Ministers of Education and Interior were opposed), 
but withheld the positive endorsement the IPC had requested. 
The Vienna City Council, seeing an opportunity to exploit 
Soviet financial support of the Festival, agreed in April 
to refit certain buildings at fees so high as to embarrass 
the IPC, which had no choice but to accept the terms. 
The independent newspapers Neuer 1,(urier and Die Presse 
vigorously attacked the decision on the Festival; the 
Austrian National Union of Students said it would not 
participate in any way; and Arbeiter Zeituqg reported that 
the Socialist leadership had instructed its members, of-
ficials, and branch organizations to refrain from any 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 9 
connection with the event. Faced with such public dis-
pleasure, Chancellor Raab, in an April radio address 
and in reply to a parliamentary question in May, defended 
the government's position by citing Sweden's hospitality 
to the WPC Congress. He mentioned the sponsors' claim 
that the Festival would be purely a sporting event and 
completej.y nonpolitical, and said that as a "free demo-
cratic state" Austria could not have turned down the 
request since the IPC had promised to observe Austrian 
laws and to "desist from any political propaganda." 
A member of the WFDY secretariat has been quoted 
to the effect that the organization believes staging a 
festival of a nonpolitical nature in the West will permit 
the WFDY to make significant gains in the next five years. 
The "nonpolitical nature" is made particularly unlikely, 
however, by a report that the Soviet member of the IPC 
recommended Vienna because atomic disarmament and the 
creation of a neutral zone in Europe, planned as two of 
the central themes of the Festival, would be more ef-
fectively propagandistic in Vienna than in other suggested 
sites, such as Prague and Colombo. The propaganda aspects 
of the Festival have disturbed Western members of NATO, 
and the matter has been discussed in both the Committee on 
Information and Cultural Relations and the Political Af-
fairs Division (POLAD). The British and French Ambassadors 
in Vienna conveyed to the Austrian Foreign Office in May 
their governments' opposition to the holding of communist 
festivals anywhere outside the Soviet Bloc, and were in-
formed that the Austrians have everything under control. 
POLAD members discussed the advisability of sounding out 
the Austrians on how strongly they feel they must ac-
comodate one communist-front function a year if requested; 
but in order not to give the appearance of a NATO bloc 
approach to the problem, POLAD decided to let the Committee 
on Information and Cultural Relations undertake any 
counteractive measures. 
In June the Austrian Youth Federation issued a 
statement signed by 12 affiliated societies of all 
religious denominations and political parties (except 
the Communists), to the effect that "there will be no 
participation in the communist World Youth Festival." 
The IPC, which met in Vienna June 23-24, attempted to win 
over the Austrian National Union of Students by claiming 
that the Festival organization is 75% composed of repre-
sentatives from neutral countries; when reminded that the

international Union of Students had promised never to 
hold an event in any country without the approval of 
the national student union concerned, an IPC member 
replied that the IUS is only one of the sponsors of the 
Festival and that the IPC is therefore not bound to 
observe this traditional IUS guarantee. In July the 
student union, in cooperation with various conservative 
and Catholic Austrian youth groups, formed an Action 
Committee to counter the plans for the Festival. Claiming 
to represent some 300,000 Austrian youth and students, the 
Committee planned to try persuading the Vienna City Council 
to cancel the building reservations and, failing that, to 
stage demonstrations and otherwise attempt to disrupt the 
Festival. Strong opposition of Austrian youth groups 
finally forced admission by the first secretary of the 
Komsomol Central Committee that such groups are boycotting 
the Festival, contrary to previous WFDY-IUS claims that 
Austrian youth welcomed the event. In September the 
Austrian Catholic Youth Federation announced that it would 
take every possible measure to prevent the holding of the 
Festival. A campaign of harassment, scheduled to begin in 
December 195p and intended to force removal of the Festival 
to a site within the Soviet Bloc, was planned in October 
by representatives of 13 Austrian consprvative and church 
youth organizations, including the Boy Scouts, and in 
association with the Socialist Youth organization. 
Communist-front meetings held in Vienna in 1958 
included a conference between the WPC Executive Committee 
and the Organizing Committee 
for the Stockholm Congress, 
May 31-June 2. The Fourth World 
Congress of the Women's Inter-
national Democratic Federation 
(WIDF) met in Vienna June 1-5. The "Third Pugwash Con-
ference of Scientists," which maintained that "mankind 
must set itself the task of eliminating all wars, including 
local wars," was held at Kitzbuehel, Austria, September 
14-19, and at Vienna, September 20-21. The "Pugwash Con-
ferences"(named for Mr. Cyrus Eaton's estate) have been 
prepared in part by the Communist front World Federation 
of Scientific Workers (WFSW), the president and several 
members of which were involved in this third meeting, and 
the "Vienna Statement," read at the final public session 
attended by the Austrian President and the Mayor of Vienna, 
was issued later in pamphlet form by the International 
Institute for Peace. Finally, the first part of the

International Federation of Resistance Fighters' Third 
Congress convened at Vienna, November 28-30, with the 
second and more important part of the Congress scheduled 
for March 1959, The FIR was refused permission to hold 
the Congress first in Milan, then in Copenhagen, then in 
Brussels (to take advantage of the World Fair), and 
finally had to settle for Vienna, its headquarters. 
Like the FIR, the WPC is said to have attempted at 
one time to hold its 1958 Congress for Disarmament and 
International Cooperation in Brussels, and to have been 
refused permission by the Belgian Government; instead, 
the WPC set up in Brussels an "International Club," under 
auspices of the IIP, to entice visitors at the World Fair 
to attend the Congress in Stockholm. According to the 
Swedish liberal newspaper guss,?,aga, the WPC tried also to 
hive the Congress meet in Oslo, which the Norwegian Prime 
Minister successfully opposed. In spite of public anger 
at the executions of Imre Nagy and other leaders of the 
Hungarian revolution, and of hostility shown by the press 
and by the Confederation of Swedish Trade Unions, the 
Swedish Government -- having once seriously considered 
withdrawing permission -- allowed the Congress to convene 
in Stockholm, July 16-22. On July 3 qgagas. Nvheter 
published an article entitled "Stockholm Exploited for 
Soviet Propaganda," and suggested that the aim of choosing 
a neutral capital in Europe as the site of the Congress 
was to impress the Asian and African delegates, who might 
assume that equally good living conditions prevail in the 
Soviet Union. Criticizing the reception of the WPC 
Organizing Committee by the Minister of Justice, temporary 
head of the government, Svenska la_421ac1et said on July 13: 
"The Government as a whole are responsible for the fact 
that their temporary head _has received propagandists for 
policies which resulted in the bloody sentences in 
Hungary." The liberal malag1=Lilaftgi remarked that "it 
is really kind of our Government to help to make Stockholm 
an international center for Communist propaganda," and 
g_ILLgaaga wondered whether the government had forgotten 
the ridicule and shame which the 1950 Stockholm Appeal 
had caused the capital of Sweden. A public meeting of 
protest was held on the opening day of the Congress, at-
tended by representatives of ten organizations of refugees 
from Soviet-conquered European countries, who asked why 
the problems of peace and independence are always dis-
cussed by the WPC only in terms of the Asian and African 
peoples. The WPC sought to present the Congress as

nonpolitical and nonideological in its emphasis on dis-
armament and cooperation, but was unable to hold inter-
national attention in competition with the Iraqi revolution 
and the Anglo-American landings in the Near East, and the 
Congress went almost unnoticed outside Sweden. 
Front organization efforts to stage events in the 
neutralist countries of Asia met with varying success 
during 1958. A WPC Bureau 
THE FRONT ORGANIZATIONS meeting was held in New Delhi, 
AND THE "NEUTRALS" March 22-24, but in July 
permission was refused the 
WFDY to hold an Executive 
Committee session in that city, in spite of the blandish-
ments of WFDY President Bruno Bernini who had paid a visit 
to India in June. Asked in the Upper House of; Parliament 
on September 11 why the Indian Government had taken this 
stand While permitting the noncommunit World Assembly of 
Youth WA/ to hold its Third General Assembly at New 
Delhi in August, Prime Minister Nehru replied that it was 
government policy to discourage meetings in India of 
organizations with clear political or ideological af-
filiations with regai'd to the cold war." Such ideological 
affiliation seemed to him quite clear in the case of the 
WFDY, while WAY has "a wide platform on which differing 
opinions meet and sometimes come into conflict" and "is 
not tied up with any ane particular ideology." The Foreign 
Minister Of Indonesia is reported to have rejected in 
Augusta request to permit the WFDY Executive Committee to 
meet in Djakarta, on grounds that no funds or housing 
would be available. Prime Minister Bandaranaike of Ceylon, 
however, approved holding the WFDY Executive Committee 
meeting in Colombo, December 7-10, and addressed the 
opening session, expressing confidence that the WFDY will 
play an important part in establishing mutual understanding 
and friendship between peoples. 
The Afro-Asian Writers' Conference, sponsored by the 
Soviet Union of Writers, planned in part during the WPC 
Stockholm Congress, and endorsed by the newest of the front 
organizations -- the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council and 
Secretariat located in Cairo, convened at Tashkent, Uzbek 
S.S.R., October 7-13. The choice of Tashkent for this 
conference and for the Afro-Asian Film Festival that 
preceded it illustrates the Soviet Union's effort to 
exploit the partly Asian character of the U.S.S.R. and 
thus extend its influence with the neutralist states of

the East. A strong appeal to the national pride of the 
participating authors and journalists was made by the con-
ference organizers, with stress laid on the alleged 
cultural affinity between Asia and Africa. Nikita Khrushchev, 
in an October speech at the Kremlin, hailed the emergence 
of a new propaganda slogan -- "the spirit of Tashkent" --
and noted that the Soviet people have "built a powerful 
multinational socialist state, a union of equal socialist 
republics" in each of which "has grown and developed new, 
unprecedently vivid cultures, national in form and social-
ist in their essence." In furtherance of the spirit of 
Tashkent, defined by a Senegalese writer as "a spirit of 
peaceful coexistence, a spirit of friendship between the 
peoples of the U.S.S.R., Asia, and Africa," it was decided 
to set up in Ceylon a Permanent Bureau or Standing Com-
mittee' of Afro-Asian Writers. The Ceylonese Govel'nment 
had not yet decided to grant permission, as of November 
1958, but following as it did the official consent to a 
WFDY Executive Committee meeting in Colombo, the prospect 
of harboring the headquarters of a communist-front organ-
ization had stirred up public opposition by that time. 
Even the admittedly anti-Western editor of Dinamina and 
political commentator of the Daily News, deploring the 
raising of this "thorny question for the Government," 
wrote: 
It will generally be agreed that Ceylon should 
have cultural exchanges and contacts with all 
friendly countries, irrespective of ideology, and 
that there are many benefits which Ceylon can obtain 
from such relations. 
But where foreign cultural organisations seek to 
operate within this country, the Government must 
make sure that their activities are confined to 
genuine cultural purposes, and that "culture" is 
not used as a cloak for building up political 
influence which would be dangerous to the inde-
pendence and integrity of this country. Once 
again, it must be emphasised that this principle 
applies to organisations sponsored by either of 
the great power blocs. 
Even when front organization gatherings are held 
in communist countries it is not always possible for the 
sponsors from the East European satellite states to 
control the proceedings or the physical circumstances as

tightly as they desire. The Fifth World Student Congress 
of the International Union of Students, held at Peiping, 
September 4-15, was a case in point. Coinciding with the 
international crisis in the Straits of Taiwan, the Congress 
dissolved at times into mass demonstrations against "U.S. 
imperialism" and "aggression" that were staged by local 
Chinese Communists. Propaganda themes that did not fit 
immediately into Chinese Government pronouncements tended 
to be overwhelmed by expressions of nationalism on the 
part of the host country. Transportation difficulties 
arising from choice of a site so far removed from IUS 
headquarters in Prague were accented by the comparatively 
small size of the Congress, and by the fact that 25 of 
the 231 participants were killed in the crash of a jet 
airliner en route back to Moscow. 
The 1958 activities of the World Federation of Trade 
Unions (WFTU) continued to reflect the output of the 
Soviet propaganda machine. as

SINO-SOVIET "ANTI- to expand the influence of

Afro-Asian area. The principal 
WFTU propaganda events were 
concentrated in the months of June and July. Two of them 
inaugurated a series of regional meetings in support of 
U.S.S.R. "peace" programs on which the WFTU decided at 
its Fourth Congress in October 1957. The first of these 
was the "Conference of European Trade Unions and Workers 
Against Atomic War and for Disarmament" held in East 
Berlin on June 20-22, 1958. This conference featured 
propaganda appeals opposing "atomic death," continued 
nuclear tests, and the nuclear rearmament of West Germany, 
demanding global nuclear disarmament, and propagating 
the forthcoming Stockholm "peace" conference. The 
second was an "International Conference of Workers from 
Baltic Countries" convened at Rostock, East Germany, on 
July 7-8 to publicize the communist "Baltic Sea of Peace" 
theme and likewise protest against the equipment of the 
West German Bundeswehr with atomic weapons. The same 
concentration on "peace" and the danger of West German 
rearmament was a feature of WFTU's "First World Con-
ference of Young Workers," held at Prague on July 14-20, 
1958. Among other topics treated in the speeches and 
resolutions of this conference that of "young workers" 
figured least and that of the Anglo-American intervention 
in Lebanon and Jordan most prominently. 
SECRET/NOFORN

The latter event and the Iraqi rebellion by which 
it was provoked provided a convenient occasion for the 
WFTU to step up its anti-Western campaign addressed to 
the Afro-Asian countries as well as its pro-Arab friend-
ship offensive. On July 26-27 the WFTU Executive Com-
mittee held a "special meeting" in Prague with the "Events 
in the Middle East" as the only agenda item. In the 
presence of specially invited representatives of the Nasir-
sponsored International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions 
(ICATU), this meeting protested the intervention in 
Lebanon and Jordan and "other aggressive plans against 
Arab countries.hatched by the British and American 
imperialists" and hailed the Iraqi revolution as well as 
the "peace initiatives" of the U.S.S.R. The WFTU/ICATU 
relationship was described at the meeting in glowing 
terms of "solid cooperation" and "joint action." One of 
the fruits of this cooperation was an "International 
Labor Conference in support of Algeria" jointly organized 
by the WFTU and the ICATU on September 12 in Cairo. 
Throughout the year the WFTU, in line with the 
"anti-colonialist" strategy of the Sino-Soviet Bloc, 
continued to direct the greater part of its efforts 
toward the Afro-Asian area, even outside the Middle East. 
The dissolution on March 4 of the WFTU's Asian-Australasian 
Trade Union Liaison Bureau in Peiping does not detract 
from this statement. Never more than a paper organiza-
tion, the Liaison Bureau had become a unilateral instrument 
of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and had long 
ceased to be directly useful to WFTU headquarters. More-
over, for several years the WFTU has exhibited a decided 
preference to work in the Afro-Asian area through un-
affiliated nationalist and ostensibly noncommunist organ-
izations, a tactic which permits it to operate behind a 
smokescreen of neutra3ist fronts. This development 
reflects the extent to which the WFTU has compromised 
its function as the leading and exclusive instrument of 
international communist labor for the sake of the new 
Soviet diplomacy in the underdeveloped areas. Thus the 
long-standing preparations for an "Afro-Asian Labor Con-
ference," a project especially dear to the WFTU, are now 
in the hands of the Japanese aghyo and of the ICATU. The 
latest word from Cairo, which had initially scheduled 
such a conference for February 1959, is that it will take 
place in April "at the earliest," while aghyg which is 
cooperating closely with the Chinese Communists on this 
matter aims for a date late in 1959. There is still talk 
in WFTU and "neutralist" Afro-Asian labor circles that from 
this conference there will emerge a communist-neutralist 
regional Afro-Asian Labor Federation.

III. WESTERN NORTHERN, AND CENTRAL EUROPE 
INTRODUCTION 
16 
The outstanding development in Western European 
communism in 1958 was the political emasculation of the 
French Communist Party (Parti Communiste Francais - PCF). 
Only the Italian Communist Party remains as a powerful 
tribune of communism in the halls of Western European 
parliaments. (The French and Italian Communist Parties 
are treated separately on pages 24-32 and 32-41, respective-
ly.) The reduction of PCF parliamer.itary representation to 
a mere handful, no more than what the party had over 25 
years ago on the basis of a much smaller electorate, is 
of more than passing importance. It is the result of 
certain internal social and economic developments of the 
postwar period as well as the doctrinal rigidity of the 
PCF. 
The plight of the PCF also epitomizes a more 
general development which has been in the making for over 
a decade, namely that growing Soviet power has been of 
little benefit to the Western European communist parties. 
While the Soviet Union's ultimate hope of seizing Western 
Europe has not changed, the instrumentalities for 
achieving this goal have become more diversified, making 
Moscow less dependent on Western European communism and 
therefore less apprehensive about its present decline. 
Moreover, Soviet strength supplemented by the still un-
shakeable belief in the inevitable crisis of the moribund 
capitalist system provides the necessary psychological 
backbone for the constantly shrinkirg band of the party 
faithful in the West. It permits tte Soviet Communists 
to impose upon the communist parties in the West the 
increasingly difficult task of maintaining contact with 
.010 Masses without straying from the narrow path of 
Marxism-Leninism which, in simple terrs, means un-
questioning loyalty to the Soviet Unicn. What is more, 
thq Soviet leadership seems quite prepared to discount 
the possib1SL ruinous effect of its :itrategy on Western 
European parties by pointing to the s=cesses of the 
communist movement elsewhere in which he hapless European 
comrades can participate vicariously.

Since the 20th Congress of the CPSU in February 
1956, every Western European communist party has been 
caught to a varying degree in a crossfire of internal 
disruption and declining electoral support. Subsequent 
events, particularly the Hungarian revolution, have un-
doubtedly increased and accelerated the attritional 
effect of these causes, but they did not start with 
them. These facts should be kept in mind because they 
still bear significantly on developments in the communist 
parties of Western Europe. 
ROUNDUP OF THE MINOR EUROPEAN COMMUNIST PARTIES 
The Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) is 
still sufferinQ badly from its slavish adherence to Moscow 
throughout the fateful year of 
1956, though membership losses 
during the past year have diminished 
somewhat in volume. However, an 
additional obstacle has arisen as 
the result of a more general notable lack of interest in 
socialist ideas on the part of the working and middle class 
population which has affected even the powerful British 
Labor Party. The British Communists continue to fare 
badly in elections as demonstrated by their exceptionally 
poor showing in the recent Wigan by-election, the first 
one which the party contested since 1954. In spite of a 
very sizeable effort on the part of the party, it polled 
only about 70 percent of the vote which it had attained 
in that constituency in the general election of 1955. 
Externally completely isolated, the party still managed 
to retain a few seats in the triennial borough and 
district council elections in May. These victories, 
however, were largely the result of the local popularity 
of the party's candidates and indicate no resurgence of 
the party as such. 
During the past year the CPGB expelled one of its 
few remaining distinguished intellectuals for having 
published a critical book on the state of the Jews in 
the Soviet Union. Professor Hyman Levy thereby joined 
the list of vocal party defectors who first began to 
protest in 1956 against the party's intolerant attitude 
toward its intellectuals. When the intellectuals first 
left the party it appeared that they were retiring to 
political obscurity, although their criticism of the 
CPGB was on bureaucratic rather than ideological grounds. 
THE BRITISH COM-
MUNIST PARTY

More recently, however, it has become clearer that many 
of these defectors have gravitated to the Trotskyite 
groups which, relatively quiescent during the past decade, 
seem to have perked up again in the last eighteen months. 
Trotskyite elements have penetrated certain local labor 
parties, particularly in South London, Manchester, 
Liverpool and Leeds, where their tactics have been to 
create - breakaway unions as part of a general campaign 
against "bureaucracy" and the provocation of illegal 
strikes. Former CPGB members and agliy Worker correspondent, 
Peter Fryer, joined other defectors and long-standing 
Trotskyites in the publication of T ewsletter, in the 
spring of 1957. This flurry of Trotskyite activity has 
already earned them rising attacks from CPGB leadership 
and recognition by the Trotskyite Congress in Paris which 
hailed the developments in Great Britain as one of the 
important recent successes of the Fourth International. 
With the 19ss of additional intiellictuals and the 
continuing coldnqs of the British OecAOle to communist 
efforts at recruitment, the CPGB seems to have turned its 
attention during the past year to the growing number of 
West Indian Negroes who have emigrated to Britain in 
recent years. The appearance of a new monthly, the West 
Indian Gazette, is suggestive of this new recruiting 
effort by the party. While the paper lacks the character 
of a typical communist publication, taking due note of 
the relatively non-political attitude of its prospective 
readers who are still more interested in news about their 
former and present home communities, its communist sponsor-
ship is reasonably certain. The paper's editor is Claudia 
Jones, a Trinidadian Negress and former official of the 
CPUSA who was deported to Britain in 1955 where she has 
been active in the CPGB. Another West Indian Communist 
graces the paper's editorial board and the paper features 
articles by Janet Jagan, co-leader of British Guiana's 
pro-communist People's Progressive Party. Furthermore, 
appeals to help boost the paper's sales and circulation 
have appeared in the official literature of the CPGB's 
London District Committee. 
The situation in the Benelux area presents little 
change from what it was in 1957 with the exception of the 
conflict that has convulsed the 
BENELUX Communist Party of the Netherlands 
(CPN) during the past year. This 
conflict, involving not only the 
CPN but also the communist-controlled labor federation

had been smoldering for a long time until it blew up in 
the spring of this year.1 In essence a power struggle 
between the Secretary General, Paul de Groot, who is 
attempting to regain complete control over the party, 
and several prominnt Dutch Communists in the EVC 
including its secretary, Berdus Brandsen, and the chair-
man of the CPN, Gerben Wagenaar, its outcome is still 
uncertain. The fight has already split the small com-
munist delegation in the lower house of the Dutch 
parliament and resulted in the suspension of the rebelling 
individuals by the party. De Groot has tried very hard 
to provide this struggle with the proper ideological 
trappings by tagging his opponents as "revisionigts,"

THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN current year to support the

equiQment of the West German 
armed forces with atomic weapons. 
In this connection the KPD has sought to join the West 
German Social Democratic Party (SPD) in its anti-atomic 
weapons campaign. These communist maneuvers were, for 
the most part, readily exposed and they had little success 
in bombarding the West German working class with the 
standard theme of class unity against the Adenauer govern-
ment. The communist front political party, League of 
Germans (Bund der Deutschen BDD) received only a 
negligible share of the vote in state (Land) elections, 
nor could the Communists advance their objective by 
running candidates as "independents? in these elections 
or, in some localities, by supporting SPD candidates. 
The Austrian Communist Party (Kommunistische 
Partei Oesterreichs KP0e) celebrated its fortieth 
anniversary this year. But the party had very little 
to celebrate. It still suffers from its identification

loyal followers have defected in the wake of the Soviet 
military intervention in Hungary in 1956. Membership 
dropped to a new low during 1958 and is now estimated at 
50,000 compared with 70,000, a year ago. In the elections 
on November 23, 1958 for seats in the Austrian province 
of Burgenland (which borders on Hungary), the KPOe won 
only twelve seats as compared with 51 in similar elections 
held in 1954, receiving fewer than 2,000 votes compared 
with 5,500 in 1954. In shop council elections covering 
about 40,000 employees of the Austrian postal, telegraph, 
and telephone services, held on November 11 and 12, of 
this year, communist candidates received only about 1,500 
votes as compared with some 2,500 four years ago. 
In Switzerland hostility against the Swiss Communist 
Party (Partei der Arbeit - PdA, or Parti du Travail - PdT) 
has been so intense since Hungary that there is active 
opposition to even relatively innocuous communist propa-
ganda attempts. For example, an exhibit on the life of 
Soviet workers which had been scheduled for late November 
in Zuerich, was greeted with anticommunist demonstrations. 
Anticommunist feeling has also been running high in the 
ranks of organized labor: in September the two communist 
members (G, Meyer of Geneva and A. Blanc of Lausanne) of 
the central executive board of the powerful trade union 
of public utilities workers (Verband des Personal 
oeffentlicher Dienste - VPOD) were forced to resign 
their positions.

function. Financial difficulties have led to the disap-
pearance of the Narvik provincial newspaper, leaving 
Friheten as the only, Communist daily. 
The Swedish Communist Party suffered heavily in 
two elections in 1958. In the special June elections 
to the lower house of the Swedish Parliament, the Com-
munists put up candidates in only 16 out of 28 electoral 
districts, deferring in the other areas to the Social 
Democrats. This tactic availed the party but little 
since it gained only 3.4 percent of the total vote -- the 
lowest the party has had since World War II -- and 
reduced its parliamentary representation from six to five 
seats. Popular support for the Communist Party also hit 
a low in the local elections of September 1958 when the 
party entered candidates in all electoral districts. It 
won only four percent of the popular vote, the party's 
weakest showing in the postwar period. Another indication 
of the Swedish party's declining fortunes was the amalga-
mation of the "Democratic Youth" (Demokratisk Unodom - DU) 
organization, a front group, with the officially defunct 
Swedish Communist Youth Organization (LygIigg.1 Kommunistiska 
Lludgmsforbund, - SKU) in May 1958. The latter group is to 
be the rallying point for Sweden's youth and probably is 
also intended to serve as a recruiting ground for the 
party. Finally, the distinct failure of this year's 
meeting of the World Peace Council in Stockholm, July 16-22, 
added little to the party's lustre. The congress of the 
World Peace Council, devoted to the problem of disarma-
ment and international cooperation, had been the party's 
greatest propaganda effort, but coming on the he015 of the 
execution of Nagy and at the moment when the Middle East 
seemed on the verge of exploding the intended effect of 
the meeting was completely spoiled. 
In spite of these setbacks and certain rumblings 
of disagreement within the party over its increasing 
subservience to Moscow on the "anti-revisionist" line, 
party chairman Hilding Hagberg has managed to keep things 
under control. Hagberg himself had at one time been 
suspected of sympathy for "revisionist" heresies but has 
since fallen into line and sought to suppress any 
heretical tendencies in his party. Aside from this 
struggle Set Persson's ultra-Stalinist splinter group 
continues unsuccessfully to seek to draw members away 
from the official party.

SECRET 22 
The Danish Communist Party (DKP), on the other 
hand, has experienced a spectacular rift this year which 
promises to have far-reaching consequences. By first 
removing its party chairman, Aksel Larsen, for "revision-
ist" views, and then expelling him when he refused to 
stop advocating them, the party bowed to Moscow's demand 
delivered to the assembld party members by N. Pospelov, 
Secretary of the CPSU and candidate member of the Presidium, 
at the extraordinary 20th Congress of the DKP in November 
of this year.. 
The malaise in the DKP is directly traceable to 
the ferment created in 1956 by the 20th Congress of the 
CPSU. The impact of that congress on the DKP followed 
by the events in Hungary was serious enough to result 
in significant losses in party membership and popular 
support. Demands for greater independence from Moscow 
were therefore voiced by a substantial element in the 
DKP which was led by many of the party's intellectuals 
who wanted to arrest the decline of the party. This trend 
found a spokesman in Akstl Larsen who argued in 1957 at 
the 19th DKP Congress for greater emphasis on the Danish 
character of the party and, by implication, for less 
subservience to Moscow. While this orientation received 
the overwhelming endorsement of the trade union element 
in the party and earned Larsen re-election to the party 
chairmanship -- he received nearly 90 percent of the 
total delegate votes -- it ran directly counter to Moscow's 
efforts to strengthen its control over the international 
communist movement. 
As a result the more orthodox elements in the 
party launched a counter-attack against Larsen personally 
and against "revisionism" in general. The struggle 
continued for months below the surface but erupted in 
June 1958 at a Central Committee meeting where Larsen 
was accused of being a Titoist by his opponents. Unable 
to defeat the Larsen group in the Central Committee, the 
rival factions then marshalled their forces for a final 
showdown at the special party congress which took place 
November 2. In the meantime Larsen compounded his 
guilt by submitting a long memorandum to the Central 
Committee in which he not only refused to change his 
views but also lauded some aspects of the Yugoslav party 
program, and worst of all attributed the decline of the 
Western European Communist parties to their excessive 
subservience to Moscow. This me-rriorandum was reportedly 
rejected by a majority of the Central Committee,

With the battle lines drawn, the Larsen group was 
subjected to withering fire from the Soviet communists 
and elements loyal to them VI the international movement. 
This pressure proved too much and made the removal of 
Larsen from the chairmanship a foregone conclusion. His 
expulsion shortly thereafter may have been provoked by 
Larsen himself whose refusal to keep quiet forced the 
party to get rid of him. 
Larsen's expulsion endangers the DKP's future 
representation in Parliament. The six seats which the 
communists now hold are due mostly to his personal 
popularity. Without him, it is doubtful that the DKP can 
win sufficient votes to share in the distribution of seats 
even by 1961, when the next regularly scheduled national 
elections take place. Larsen still enjoys the confidence 
of a large segment of the DKP and his newly formed 
Socialist Peoples Party (SPP) can count on the support of 
the small Left Socialist Party formed by old Communists 
and ex-Socialists following the Hungarian events. 
A deteriorating economic situation in Finland 
causing extensive unemployment, helped the communist-
front Finnish People's Democratic League (SKDL) to increase 
its vote from 21.6 percent to 23.2 percent and its seats 
from 43 to 50 in the July 6-7 parliamentary elections. 
The SKDL's vote exceeded by one-tenth of one percent 
its closest rivals, the Social Democratic and Agrarian 
Parties. While the main reason for this communist 
victory resulted from non-participation of the non-
communist voters rather than from a significant shift 
in the voting pattern, the Communists did gain in the 
underdeveloped northern regions of the country among 
unskilled workers and small farmers dependent upon part-
time industrial or other employment. 
The communist victory had the effect of consolidating 
the bloc of noncommunist parties and made them more dis-
posed to compromise and cooperate than was the case before 
the elections. The Conservative Party joined the govern-
ment coalition for the first time since the war and, as a 
result, the Communists were still excluded from the 
government which was formed on August 29 (Communists have 
not been members of a Finnish government since July 1948). 
This new coalition cabinet received the support of more 
than two-thirds of the deputies in the Parliament. The 
Soviet government, however, was displeased with the 
SECRET 
SECRET 24 
composition of the new Finnish cabinet because of the 
inclusion of right-wing Social Democratic and Conservative 
members. By a series of actions, or rather failure to 
act, in connection with economic matters Moscow brought 
indirect pressure to bear on the Finns, resulting in the 
resignation of the present Finnish government early in 
December. While the composition of the new Finnish 
cabinet is not yet known, it is unlikely that the SKDL 
will be represented in it. On the other hand, the 
stiffening Soviet attitude will undoubtedly influence the 
composition of the new government and possibly also its 
policies toward the East and the West. 
The Communists in Iceland held on to their positions 
by outmaneuvering the Social Democrats and taking advantage 
of the fisheries dispute which marred Anglo-Icelandic 
relations during 1958. By fanning Icelandic nationalism, 
the Communists generated sufficient pressure to force 
the government to make its unilateral declaration extending 
Iceland's fishery conservation limit to 12 miles. More-
over, the resultant dispute with the United Kingdom has 
served to strengthen communist support in the country. 
In collaboration with dissident Leftist Social Democrats, 
the Gommunists upped their percentage of the vote in the 
municipal elections from 18.5 percent to 19 percent. And 
in the labor field, the long-standing attempt by the 
Social Democrats and Conservatives to wrest control of 
the Icelandic Federation of Labor (IFL) away from the 
Communists failed again. It appears that the Social 
Democrats proved vulnerable to communist and progressive 
pressure tactics. The upshot of this most recent attempt 
was that Hannibal Valdimarsson of the Labor Alliance was 
re-elected President along with four Communists and four 
Social Democrats who constitute part of the Executive 
Council. This leaves the IFL under substantial communist 
imfluenqe.

FRANCE 
The past year has undoubtedly been one of the most 
disastrous in the history of the French Communist Party 
(PCF). After.a phenomenal growth in the early postwar 
period, the party finds itself now in total political 
isolation, deprived of much of its voting appeal, and 
reduced to almoSt complete impotence in the parliamentary 
arena. The causes of this diminution of communist

strength are intimately related to certain internal French 
social and economic developments of the more recent past 
as well as to the doctrinal rigidity of the PCF and its 
long-time close identification with the objectives of the 
international communist movement. Moreover, the PCF's 
electoral decline, by no means as precipitous as its 
actual reduction in political strength,' has brought into 
sharp relief the party's increasingly grotesque position 
of remaining doctrina-11y? revolutionary and yet accepting 
peacefully, in spite of its numerical strength, the 
sanctions imposed on it. 
For the remaining revolutionaries in the party the 
hardest thing to swallow may be this peaceful abdication 
of power,-- evidence- - impotence of French 
communism and its inability and ainwil.lingWe'ss to put 4p 
la.ny serious opposition to .deftnd itself-agalast pZlitical 
emasculation. Thus the claims of the Fifth Republic to 
have banished the specter of communism from France seem 
somewhat exaggerated and could under some special circum-
stances prove to be evun premature. The sole contribution 
of the new regime has been to relegate the PCF officially 
to a kind of shadow existence, merely accentuating a 
condition in which the party has found itself for a number 
of years. 
The year 1958 began uneventfully for the PCF. The 
narrow confines in which the party had been operating 
seemed unchanged from previous years. If membership 
lagged -- only about 31,000 new members were recruited 
up to the middle of May -- the results of a number of by-
elections compensated somewhat for it. For in each of 
four by-elections during the first half of 1958, the PCF '

18.9 percent (25.6 percent in 1956) of the votes, leaving 
it still the single largest political group in terms 
of popular votes. In spite of this sizeable return, the 
PCF dropped 38 percent in comparison with the 1956 
elections and lost 1.6 million voters in absolute numbers. 
More striking was the drop in the PCF parliamentary 
representation from 148 to 10, largely the result of an 
electoral law which also reapportioned all electoral 
districts so es to hurt the party. This is the lowest 
parliamentary representation the PCF has had in over 
a quarter of a century. In the second tour of the 
recent elections the party improved its popular vote 
somewhat,polling about 20.7 percent and gaining about 
200,000-300,000 votes.

managed to increase its vote over what it had been in 
1956. In the case of Marseille the party even succeeded 
in holding on to a seat vacated as the ?esult of the 
death of one of its deputies by profiting from a quarrel 
between the Socialist and Independent candidates. 
It was not until the fateful demonstration of the 
Paris police on March 13 before the Palais Bourbon (seat 
of Assembly) that a whole sequence of events began to 
unfold which seemed to provide the PCF with unrivalled 
opportunities for re-entering the political arena. The 
ill-disguised hostility against the Fourth Republic which 
the demonstrating police officers manifeste0 on March 13 
as well as the insurrectionary actions by military and 
civilians alike in Algeria, barely two months later, did 
not result, however, in a realignment of the forces on 
the left as the Communists had h*ed. On the contrary, 
the PCF suffered further ostracism. As the party was 
to discover very soon, its isolation was not the handi-
work of the "traitorous Socialist leadership" but, more 
alarming, the product of a resurgent nationalism which 
had seized a significant segment of the working class. 
This fact was driven home in the Aptil cantonal 
elections when the Communists failed to elicit any 
feelings of leftist solidarity and did not benefit from 
a strategy of unilateral withdrawal for Social candi-
dates. Not only did the PCF lose more than a third of 
its seats but there was an unmistakable rightist trend 
on the part of the Socialists and even its own electorate. 
Withdrawal by the PCF had not helped Socialist candidates 
in many cases and in addition the million or so new voters 
between the ages of 23 and 27 had voted for the PCF in a 
much smaller proportion than the electorate as a whole. 
The magnitude of this rightist trend became more 
apparent during the Algerian crisis. As the Communists 
found it to their interest to help the reluctant Pflimlin 
government defend the Fourth Republic by giving it the 
largest majority in the Assembly of any French govern-
ment in the past decade, it only seemed to hasten the 
flight of all other groups away from that moribund insti-
tution. Similarly, when the party's attacks on General 
de Gaulle went into high gear, his chances for becoming 
the choice of the vast majority of center and left-of-center 
deputies increased markedly. Thus the PCF's last minute 
attempt to block de Gaulle's investiture was designed to lay 
the foundation for possible future political exploitation and

not seriously meant to stem the tide in de Gaulle's favor. 
The party did succeed in punching a few holes into the 
stone wall which had separated it from the noncommunist 
left -- the Paris demonstration of May 28 and the more 
or less isolated contacts with splinter-left groups and 
a few individuals -- but these were largely isolated 
incidents that signified no outstretched hand, let alone 
any kind of embrace. Any illusions therefore, about a 
revival of a Popular Front, generously fostered by the 
communists, were consequently largely still-born. 
The virtually uncontested liquidation of the 
Fourth Republic, the relief with which General de Gaulle's 
arrival on the scene was greeted, and the growing -certain-
ty on the part of the PCF that his prestige was likely to 
overcome any specter of fascism in the public mind dulled 
the party's efforts. Worse yet for the PCF was the fact 
that its activities were under growing scrutiny by 
important members of de Gaulle's entourage who seemed 
intent on outlawing the party at the first opportunity. 
This placed the PCF leadership in the difficult position 
of having to maintain its opposition to the forthcoming 
referendum within narrow limits: it could not risk any 
action which might bring reprisals but its opposition 
had to be forthright enough to satisfy its militants who 
were growing increasingly restive under a policy that 
seemed to bear all the marks of a peaceful self-liquidation 
of the party. 
Without appearing too openly defeatist at the 
outset, the leadership was obviously well aware of the 
future threats to the party's survival at the hands of 
the government as well as the more indirect losses which 
the communists were certain to suffer from changes in 
the electoral law. Much effort was therefore expended 
to cushion these blows by various means and particularly 
by repeated attempts to reduce the hostility of those 
who were also against the referendum but even more dis-
inclined to collaborate with the PCF in opposing it. 
Conversely, much persuasion was cused1-1 on the party 
militants to convince them of the need for missionary 
work if they desired to overcome de Gaulle's popularity 
with many workers. The party made no bones about the 
serious inroads which the General had made in that quarter 
and sought to limit any friction there by cautioning its 
militants not to behave too aggressively against those who 
had voted "yes" in the referendum. 
SECRET 
SECRET 28 
The Ileavy PCF defeat in the referendum of September 
28 and the promulgation of a new electoral law coupled 
with the reapportionment of electoral districts in early 
October, designed specifically to reduce communist 
representation in the future parliament, seemed to have 
raised the possibility of wholesale PCF withdrawals in 
favor of Socialists and other republican candidates in 
the coming elections. In view of the bad relations which 
prevailed between the French Socialist Party (SFIO) and 
the PCF, however, it appears unlikely that such a tactic 
was ever seriously contemplated in spite of some possible 
support for it in the party. On the other hand,it is 
possible that there was some pressure within the party 
for taking the extra-parliamentary road, such as strikes 
and other forms of violence, once it became certain that 
the PCF would barely be represented in the new parliament. 
There is at least some indirect evidence that these 
questions gave rise to protracted discussions and even 
serious differences of views within the party that could 
not be easily reconciled. This may be the reason for the 
delay in the printing of Thorez's speech to the Central 
Committee on October 3-4, which- LI did not appear 
until October 10 in L'Humanite and the unforeseen pro-
longation of that meeting which was originally only 
slated to meet for one day. 
The not entirely unexpected conclusion to all this 
was, however, that the views of the party leadership not 
only prevailed but were also communicated to the members 
with unmistakable authority and finality by the Secretary 
General himself. In laying down the lines for the party's 
strategy in the forthcoming elections, Thorer1 rejected 
both an "opportunist" and an "adventurist" course. By 
announcing that the party would do everything possible 
on the second ballot to elect either Communists or those 
republican forces who were against the reaction and 
others equally responsible for the present situation, 
Thorez delimited also the nature and area in which the 
party would act and also, by the way, take revenge on 
the Socialists. 
The election strategy of the PCF suggests that 
the party has now become increasingly preoccupied with 
long-range considerations. Moreover, the results of 
that election leave the party with little else to do_ 
or to hope for. Hemmed in by a shrinking electorate, 
which would have reduced its representation in parlia-
ment even under the old electoral system, the party can

still derive some comfoit from the fact that it continues 
to command one of the largest electoral responses in 
France. Nevertheless it is the drop in votes, and not 
so much the loss in parliamentary seats, particularly 
in areas that have been considered communitt strong-
holds for three decades, which indicates a more serious 
weakening of French communism.1 
It is still an irony of fate that French communism, 
in its gradual but real decline, seems nevertheless to 
have achieved something of a victory. For the French 
government, in applying the new electoral system in 
France with a vengeance,2 not only has perpetrated a 
mild fraud but has also seriously distorted the natural 
distribution of political forces in the country. As a 
result, it may be asked if the PCF can benefit from this 
and can take comfort in the fact that its political 
emasculation entailed the destruction of the entire 
French left'. Are there any prospects now of a joining 
of forces on the left in Parliament, and if not there, 
on the extra-parliamentary level? Has the united front 
with the Socialists any more chance now after their own 
catastrophic reduction in strength in the Assembly? 
There is no evidence of any trend in that direction, nor 
does it seem that the PCF itself is under any illusions 
1. While the PCF suffered sizeable losses in the rural 
areas in the southwest of the Massif Central, its drop 
in the Paris area is of far greater significance. There 
the PCF lost 7.2 percent of its vote compared to 1956. 
This was similar to what happened in 1951 but more 
serious this time in the working class districts of 
Paris, particularly the 12th, 13th, 14th, 17th, and 
18th districts. The party elected only one deputy 
from the Paris area in direct elections, that is by 
absolute majority. In the 18 districts of the Seine-
Oise, another party stronghold, Communists lost every-
where, arriving only in four districts in first place. 
A similar development took place in Marseilles, 
Toulouse, Bordeaux, the North, and the Pas-de-Calais 
area. 
2. The new electoral system is really a reversion to the 
single member constituency system of the Third Republic. 
In order to win, candidates have to receive an absolute 
majority of votes in their district or a plurality in 
the second instance if no one wins the first time. 
This second go-round permits alliances. In the 
present case election districts were rearranged in 
such a fashion ) as to gerrymander the communist vote.

about recouping its losses in the near future. On the 
contrary, the party leadership seems prepared for the 
worst, hinting ggain at the possibility of extra-
parliamentary action and noting also that it is facing 
the most difficult phase in its history since the German 
occupation. 
Although the short-run and even more long-range 
prospects for an upturn in the affairs of the PCF appear 
rather dim, it is still _Unlikely that the party will 
resort to violence, thereby furnishing the present French 
government with a sufficient pretext for outlawing it. On 
the other hand, it is already evident that the party 
leadership regards it as virtually certain that many of 
its activities will be so seriously hampered by the 
authorities that it may have to operate in semi-
clandestineness. There is furthermore little doubt that 
the results of the recent election, coupled with the 
disappearance of the most skilled communist spokesmen 
from the halls of the Assembly, will hurt the party's 
propaganda efforts. The protective immunity which used 
to shield communist deputies will no longer be available 
to them as private citizens. 
A more serious problem for the PCF, however, is the 
fact that the present string of mishaps has come to an 
extremely inopportune moment. While the party's organ-
izational structure is designed to facilitate its 
operation even unyer extreme adversity, the likely need 
for cutting back on many of its open activities poses new 
and more subtle dangers for its continued existence. 
The disappearance of the PCF from the public limelight, 
for instance, would be an entirely new experience for 
many of the party's young hard-core members and is likely 
to subject them to rather severe personal strains. It 
remains to be seen whether these younger officials in the 
party have been sufficiently steeled psychologically to 
carry on effectively under these conditions. 
The present political retrenchment of the PCF is 
bound to heighten the party's sensitivity to any signs 
of weakening or manifestations of restiveness over the

the party. He was probably the last serious Marxist 
theoretician in the PCF who had some standing in the 
intellectual community. Lefebvre had been on bad 
terms with the party for over a year and had already 
resigned from the editorial board of La Nouvelle 
Critique in 1957, taking with him a number of other 
disaffected intellectuals. Lefebvre, in the past 
twelve months, had piled up a number of unforgivable 
offenses, such as writing for publications hostile 
to the PCF, publishing a book on Marxism critical 
of the party, and participating in a new Marxist dis-
sident discussion group which began to publish a new 
journal Voies Nouvelles (New Paths) in April for the 
purpose of re-examining the basis of Marxism in the 
light of the 20th CPSU Congress and current conditions. 
Along with Lefebvre the PCF expelled two other lesser 
known intellectuals,- also for having participated in 
the establishment of the new magazine and for having 
formed the Club de la Gauche (Club of the Left), a 
Marxist discussion group where former party members 
participated.

been executed. In any event, the party turned thumbs

this might occur kor the difficulties that will have to

ITALY 
The major problems of the Italian Communist Party 
(Partito Comunista Italiano PCI) in 1958 were es-
sentially the same as those of 1957: first, to re-
establish some order within the party after the disorien-
tation and disorganization that had followed the events 
of 1956 in Eastern Europe; and second, to control the 
'tendency of the Italian Socialist Party (Partito Socialista 
Italiano PSI) to become increasingly independent. 
This year, however, the relative importance of the two 
problems was the reverse of that of 1957, when communist 
leaders were primarily concerned with the party's 
internal difficulties. The Communists have managed to 
check the losses of the PCI, even if they have not 
succeeded in raising party morale significantly, and the 
internal conditions of the party are at least stable. 
The Communists have failed to check the growing "autonomy" 
of the PSI, however, and they now face a serious danger 
of increasing political isblation in the foreseeable 
future. 
Organizationally, the Communist Party managed to 
maintain its position during the year and even to

rose to 1,820,000 -- an increase

Electorally, also, the Communists did quite well. In 
the parliamentary elections of May 1958, the MI in-
creased its percentage of the total vote slightly as 
compared to 1953, although it declined slightly in areas 
where the party has been traditionally strong. 1 These

results tell only part of the story, however. The fact 
remains that the electoral appeal of the party is not 
growing significantly and that its membership is 
smaller than it was a few years ago. And even the 
numerical strength of the PCI -- in votes or members 
gives little idea of the deterioration the party has 
suffered in the past few years. 
There is, for example, overwhelming evidence of 
the rapidly diminishing capacity of the PCI to mobilize 
large masses for political agitation. At the peak of 
communist power, in 1948, an assassination attempt on 
Togliatti could bring the country to the brink of revo::: 
lution; and even three years later the visit of Dwight 
Eisenhower as NATO commander could evoke large scale 
lprotests. In contrast, during the Anglo-U.S. operation 
in the Near East in mid-1958, the Communists could 114rd1y 
muster a sizeable crowd to demonstrate before the U.S. 
Embassy. An a1m6st endless series of similar episodes 
could be cited to illustrate the apathy beneath the 
impressive numerical strength of the Communist Party 
and its electorate. Despite the PCI's capacity to stem 
the party's numhaLaillosses, it has not been able to 
put much spirit in its ranks. 
Nor has it been able to destroy the political 
influence of the hundreds of communist leaders and intel-
lectuals who abandoned the 
POLITICAL ACTIVITIES party during the past two and 
OF FORMER COMMUNISTS one-half years. During 1958, 
in fact, former .ommunists 
were increasingly active in 
organizational, moral and ideological attacks on the 
PCI. In November, for example, over 200 ex-communists 
leaders held a well-publicized meeting in Rome where 
they proceeded to create a "Socialist Alliance" whose 
ob4ective is to attack the PCI and to work for the re-
uniSication of the Socialist and the Democratic Socialist 
(Partito Socialista Democratico Italiano PSDI) 
Parties. Giorgio Amendola, in a report to the PCI 
Central Committee, called the meetdng "ridiculous"; but 
the communists apparently took their former comrades 
seriously enough, since the press reported that PCI 
activists had tried to prevent the meeting from taking 
place. The SocialAst Alliance has an effective weekly 
newspaper, Eugenio Reale's Corrispondenza Socialista, 
which is sent to thousands of communist a*vists. At 
SECRET 
?

34 
the same time, by remaining formally neutral between 
the PSI and the PSDI, the Socialist Alliance will act 
as a moderating influence on the more extreme elements 
of the two 'socialist parties. 
However, the organizational strength of the former 
Communists, particularly the intellectuals, is not 
nearly so important as the effect their departure has 
had on the moral status of the PCI and the ideological 
ferment they are encouraging in the noncommunist left. 
Numerically, the dissident intellectuals were a small 
part of the total communist membership, but they did give 
the PCI a certain aura of respectability, even a certain 
moral prestige. Part of the party's prestige, of course, 
came from the Communists' role in the anti-Fascist 
resistance, but memories of the resistance faded rapidly 
in the tumultuous atmosphere of postwar Italian politics. 
A more stable basis for the respect that the POI continued 
to enjoy even among noncommunists until recent years was 
the continuing presence in the party of some of the best 
of the country's younger artists, writers, scholars and 
political publicists. The wholesale resignation of such 
intellectuals after the events of 1956 deprived the PCI 
of whatever moral repute it had managed to retain over 
the years and it helped to ease the way for the ommunists' 
increasing political isolation. 
Some of the ex-communist intellectuals, however, 
are performing a more specific and positive role: they 
are stimulating the sort of ideological re-examination 
that communist leaders abhor and, that the noncommunist 
left finds increasingly necessary. One of the pernicious 
effects of the twenty-odd years of the "unity of action" 
agreements between the Italian Communists and Socialists 
was to blur the distinctions between the two parties. 
During the years of exile, the common effort of the two 
parties against the fascist regime led them to emphasize 
their similarities rather than their differences. For 
various reasons this tendency became more marked with 
the passage of time. In recent years, however, there 
has been a revival of interest in ideological questions, 
and for the Socialists of the PSI this has meant a 
growing consciousness of their basic differences with 
the Qommunists. Former Communists are taking a leading 
part in this process of ideological renovation;-, both 
in the older organs of the left and in such new journals 
as Corrispondenza Socialista, Passato e Presente and

Tempi Moderni. The results of such discussions may not 
be spectacular in the short run, but they are extremely 
significant for the long run development of relations 
between Communists and Socialists. 
...X.he-Subj-datof-te political role played by former 
Communists reads to what was really the most critical 
problem of the Par during 1958 --
GROWING "AUTONOMY" its deteriorating relations with 
OF THE PSI the Socialists, who continued to 
make their slow and tortuous way 
toward "autonomy." The term 
autonomy," as applied to the PSI, remains extremely vague. 
It must be remembered that for some time after World War II, 
particularly after the split in the socialist movement 
itself in 1947, the PCI and the PSI were so closely "al-
lied" that the Socialists almost lost their identity. 
The Socialists' efforts to regain their "autonomy" from 
the Qommunists, consequently, involve several aspects: 
a willingness to act according to their own views on 
specific political issues, even when these are opposed 
to those of the Communists; a willingness to elaborate 
and discuss ideological differences with the Communists 
and to emphasize that, regardless of PCI-PSI agreement on 
many and perhaps most of the concrete issues of day-to-
day politics, they hold different conceptions of the 
ultimate goal of socialism and of the appropriate means 
for achieving it; and a willingness to loosen or break 
their ties with the Communists if other political alliances 
seem more likely to advance the interests of democratic 
socialism. What is generally called the increasing 
autonomy" of the PSI, then, is a process involving 
movement along one or all of these lines. 
At its February 1957 Congress, the PSI had unani-
mously adopted a resolution confirming the dissolution 
of a formal alliance with the Communists and restating 
the party's devotion to democratic principles. At the 
same time it repeated its determination to mintain the 
unity of the "working class" -- in effect to collaborate 
with the Communists on some political issues and on 
labor questions. The resolution was broad enough to 
cover a multitude of views, and the apparent unanimity 
covered deep antagonisms between those who really favored 
a gradual loosening of ties with the Communists and those 
who maintained that the PSI must continue its old policy 
of close alliance with the PCI, even if under different

forms. During most of the next year and a half, the dis-
sensions between the Autonomists and the procommunists 
within the PSI were rarely aired publicly.1 After the 
May 1958 elections and the formation of a "center-left" 
government headed by Amintore Fanfani, however, the 
dissension within the PSI broke into the open. In 
October the Directorate and the Central Committee of the 
PSI rejected the report that Pietro Nenni, the party 
secretary, proposed to make to the PSI Congress scheduled 
for January 1959. Nenni, who by then had unequivocally 
placed himself at the head of the tiutonomists, refused 
to accept a compromise report. The result was the formal 
organization of three party factions: the Autonomists, 
led by Nenni; the Pro-Communists, led by Tullio Vecchietti; 
and a small "center" faction led by Lelio Basso, which 
attempts to mediate between the two major contenders. 
Each of the factions prepared its own analysis of the 
party's record during the past two years and each proposed 
a separate policy resolution for the coming congress. 
This is the first occasion since 1949 that a SPSRI:d1t 
congress will debate more than one report and resolution. 
By 1958, then, the autonomy of the Socialists had 
gone far enough to cause real concern to the Communists. 
The unity of action agreements 
COMMUNIST POLICY had enabled the Communists to 
TOWARD THE PSI control a large party and millions 
of voters who would never join, 
or vote for, the PCI itself. In 
the short run, the autonomy of the PSI necessarily reduces 
the capacity of the Communists to influence policy by 
1. The term "Pro-Communist" is used in this paper to refer 
o those Socialists who advocate maintaining close ties 
with the PCI, but it should not imply that all these 
persons accept communist doctrine or approve of communist 
regimes. Some of tie Pro-Communists of the PSI are, by 
almost any criteria, hardly distinguishable from Com-
munists; others -- and these are more numerous -- are 
fully conscious of their profound differences with 
the Communists but maintain that, given the present 
strength of the PCI -In'Jtaly; 
have PCI support in order to work effectively for
economic and political reforms. The Autonomists, in 
contrast, are convinced that the PSI must loosen or 
break its ties with the Communists if it is to become 
an effective force in Italian politics.

depriving them of a subservient ally. In the long run, 
the creation of a really independent 'Socialist party 
could even become a serious contender for the members 
and electors of the PCI itself. Consequently, the Com-
munists made an intensive effort during the past year 
to undermine the "autonomist" elements in the PSI. 
Communist policy toward the Socialists has varied 
considerably during the past several years. In 1956, 
while the PCI was torn by internal dissension and 
threatened by mass resignations, the Communists attempted 
to minimize their differences with the Socialists. The 
Communists, for example, did not object seriously when 
in October 1956, the PSI decided to break the Unity of 
Action pant that had, in various versions, bound the two 
parties since 1934. During that period the Communists 
insisted that different "evaluations" of developments 
in the Soviet sphere did not affect the relations of the 
two "working class" parties in Italy. Once the Communists 
had succeeded in containing the organizational crisis in 
their own party, however, they began an underground 
campaign against the Socialists. This continued until 
the national elections of May 1958, when the Socialists 
succeeded in gaining votes, many of them from the POI 
itself. After the elections, the Communists made 
increasingly severe and open attacks on the Socialists 
and by the 6r1d of the year the Communists and the 
autonomist wing of the PSI, at least, were close to a 
complete rupture. 
The Communists are now using a wide variety of 
tactics to try to restrain the autonomist development 
of the PSI. One of the most effective of these tactics 
is to involve the Socialists in joint actions with the 
PCI to achieve specific goals. The tactic works best 
in the trade union field. In. th.,1?Attqmplart_of-ctlie3wear, 
for example, the (Ommunist-dominated Italian General 
Confederation of Labor (CGIL) 1 s unleashed a country-
wide series of strikes, partly, at least, as a reminder 
tc5,.the autonomists in the CGIL of the advantages of 
labor unity. In a more strictly political area, the 
PCI recently made representations to the President 
of the Republic on the "illegalities" and "irregularities" 
of the Fanfani administration, and the documents were 
later published as a White Book. These and similar 
actions roit?W meant to demonstrate that only close co-
operation between Socialists and Communists can advance 
the interests of the working classes and safeguard 
democratic liberties.

The necessity of (communist and aocialist unity 
has also been the main theme in the communist discussion 
of the year's developments in France. Italian public 
opinion is extremely sensitive to developments in 
rance and the communists have made the most of this 
situation. The opponents of the PCI -- and chief among 
them the Democratic Socialists of Giuseppe Saragat --
have put the primary responsibility for the French crisis 
on the French Communist Party, whose existence, they 
contend, has weakened the left. The PCI, on the other 
hand, contends that the "prejudicial" anticommunist stand 
of the French Democratic Socialists (Section Francaise 
Internationale Ouvriere SFIO) is the major cause of 
the success of "reactionary" forces and predicts similar 
dire consequences for Italy if the noncommunist left in 
that, country -r primarily the PSI.-- should advocate a - 
"discriminatory" policy against the Gommunists. The 
Secretary General of the PCI, Palmiro Togliatti, made a 
rhetorical statanent of this theme at the most recent 
meeting of the party's Central Committee: "Anti-communism 
is the chain that the reactionary bourgeoisie in all of 
Western Europe has succeeded in throwing about the necks 
both of social democracy and of the Catholic movement 
and of other intermediate forces, in order to paralyze 
them and to tie them down. Anti-communism is the premise 
of any reactionary movement; it is a mortal arrow 
piercing the side of democratic institutions." 
It is difficult to assess the precise impact of 
the French situation on the Italian left. The PSI has 
not accepted the communist argument fully. Its most 
biting criticisms have been aimed at the SFIO; but the 
PSI has also reprimanded the French Communists, although 
mildly, for their alleged role in the collapse of the 
Fourth Republic. On balance, the French crisis and its 
exploitation by the PCI has probably helped those groups 
in the Italian Socialist Party which advocate establishing 
closer ties with the Communists; and it has given some 
pause even to the Autonomists, who fear the consequences 
to the Italian left if they "surrender" to what they 
call the "visceral anti-communism" of the Social 
Democrats. Nevertheless, the French situation is only 
one of many factors influencing the relations between 
Socialists and Communists and it is by no means decisive. 
The Communists are also intervening directly, if 
quietly, in internal PSI affairs in an effort to defeat

the party's Autonomists. During the national elections 
of May 1958, observers noted that the ._docialist candi-
dates whose cmapaigns seemed to be most heav4y financed 
were generally those who had procommunist leanings. 
Although there was no conclusive evidence on the matter, 
the obvious conclusion was that the procommunist cand-
dates were being aided by the POI, and it is generally 
assumed that-thesTracbminuhist factions.continue_to. receive 
financial support from the PCI. In addition, it is 
reported that the PCI is attempting to intimidate the 
thousands of Socialists who are employed in communist-
dominated organizations (cooperatives, labor unions, 
local government administrations, etc.) in an effort to 
defeat the Autonomists. On November 16, Nenni himself 
publicly stated that communist pressures on the PSI had 
become "almost intolerable." 
Finally, during the past few months, the Communists 
have opened a full attack on the Socialists' ideological 
statements and on their policies of the past two or three 
years. Togliatti himself published a lengthy article in 
the October issue of Rinascita, the PICT theoretical 
monthly, on "The Decisions of the Twentieth Congress and 
the Italian Socialist Party." According to the new GOM-
munist line, the Socialists' criticism of communist 
theory and of developments in the Soviet sphere are not 
simply differences in "evaluation" that do not affect 
the relations of the Socialist and Communist Parties in 
Italy, as the Communists maintained in 1956. Togliatti 
now says 
that "in the positions taken by the Socialist 
party above all through the efforts of its major leader 
glenni ) regarding the decisions of the Twentieth Congress 
and the successive developments Lin Eastern Europg7... 
there are, in sum, all the elements of a social demperatic 
deviation." The article goes on, in effect, to criticize 
the Socialists at length for not being Communists. Nenni 
and the Autonomists have reacted strongly and the polemic 
seems likely to become more serious in the immediate 
future. 
At the end of 1958, the principal concern of the 
Communist Party was not its own internal problems, al-
though these were serious enough, 
CONCLUSION AND but its rapidly deteriorating 
PROSPECT relations with the Socialists. 
The general objective of the PCI 
is, of course, to prevent thdo.PSI 
from developing into a truly independent Socialist Party. 
On the basis of the experience of the past few years the 
SECRET 
SECRET 40 
Communists may well have decided that this is probably 
an impossible goal in the long run. In any case, the 
PSI as it stands today is deeply divided, and if part 
of it is still closely attached to the idea of a united 
front with the Communists, a substantial part of the 
party is definitely hostile to such a policy. The Com-
munists have apparently decided to make the best of 
what is for them a rather unpleasant situation. 
While the general objective of the Communists is 
clear enough, the problem remains 4' why they should have 
chosen to attack the Socialists as strongly as they have 
in recent months, and to attack them, furthermore, largely 
on ideological grounds. Given the timorous behavior of 
the Socialists in the past, the Communists probably hoped 
to intimidate the Autonomists, and to force them, at the 
very least, to arrive at some compromise with the Pro-
communists in the PSI. Nenni's refusal to compromise 
and his insistence that each of the party's factions 
present its own report and resolution at the next Congress 
was probably the single greatest setback to the PCI 
since the Socialists broke the Unity of Action agreement 
in 1956. Nenni's action ended the Communists' hope of 
entangling the Autonomists in a compromise agreement. 
The Communists' next move was probably inevitable: they 
had to make every effort to prevent the Autonomists from 
winning a majority at the Socialist congress, or to dis-
credit the Autonomists if they did win. This explains 
the Communists' apparent decision to begin placing the 
Autonomists of the PSI in the same category with the 
much-vilified Social Democrats. 
The outcome of the Socialist congress remains in 
doubt. During the past few weeks a number of PSI 
federations have been holding provincial congresses to 
discuss and vote on the resolutions of the three main 
factions and to select delegates to the national party 
congress. The results available so tar are inconclusive, 
but the evidence indicates that neither the Procommunists 
nor the Autonomists are likely to win an overwhelming 
majority at the national congress. This means that the 
victorious faction will probably have to deal with a 
powerful opposition, probably one controlling about 40 
percent of the new Central Committee to be elected at 
the Congress.

If the Orocommunists should win a majority at the 
PSI congress, the Communists and Socialists will, probably 
collaborate more closely than they have in the past two 
years. The Autonomists, however, would remain in the 
party as open critics who would oppose any negotiation' 
of a new unity of action agreement with the PCI. It 
is conceivable that the Communists might press for such 
an agreement in a deliberate effort to split the 
Autonomists from the PSI. If the Autonomists were to 
split at a time when the party leadership, and consequently 
the party name and party machinery, were controlled by the 
Frocommunists, they probably would not carry more than a 
minority of the PSI with them, and the result would be to 
make the Communists the gift of a more pliable PSI. 
However, there is nothing to indicate that the Autonomists--
many of whom remained in the PSI during the years when it 
was hardly distinguishable from the PCI and when open 
debate had been largely eliminated -- would be maneuvered 
into such a schism. They would more probably remain in 
the PSI as a powerful opposition, and if the trend of 
the past few years is any indication, they would have 
every reason to hope thAt they could eventually capture 
the party majority. 
On the other hand, if the Autonomists should win 
a majority at the PSI congress, the result would of 
course be another serious setback for the Communists. 
The presence of a powerful procommunist opposition within 
the PSI -- and the practical advantages of Communist and 
Socialist collaboration in the CGIL, cooperatives, and 
local administration -- would place definite limits on 
the speed with which the Socialists could move away 
from the PCI; but the two parties would probably drift 
apart more rapidly than they have so far. Under such 
conditions, the PCI would probably expand its attacks 
on the Autonomists in an effort to shift the internal 
PSI balance back to the procommunists, and if this were 
not feasible, in an effort to discredit the PSI as a 
whole before the large electorate of the extreme left.

IV. THE NEAR EAST AND AFRICA 
THE ARAB STATES AND ISRAEL 
Since the commencement of a new, more active Soviet 
Middle Eastern policy in 1955, the fortunes of '.communist 
parties in this region have been 
INTRODUCTION incidental to the U.S.S.R.'s 
relations with the several local 
governments. Again in 1958, the 
single major development affecting the communist movement --
which at the moment is undergoing a strong resurgence of 
both covert and open activity -- was a product of inter-
governmental relationships, namely the gradual onset of 
mutual disillusionment between Egyptian President Abd 
al-Nasir and his Soviet "benefactors." 
The first open evidence of strain appeared when 
Nasir chose to visit Tito, amid every demonstration of 
mutual cordiality, in early July just after the U.S.S.R. 
had aired its displeasure with the Yugoslav leader. During 
the August UN special session on the Lebanese crisis, the 
Soviet delegation, which drove hard for a condemnation of 
the U.S. expecting full Arab-Asian support, did not conceal 
its chagrin that the resolution formulated by the Arabs 
themselves was so mild. A turning point was finally 
reached in late summer. Talks on further arms procurement, 
begun during a visit to Cairo by Soviet Air Marshal 
Rudenko in June (with the Egyptians reportedly pressing 
for MIG 19's), were continued in October by Nasir's trusted 
emissary 'Abd al-Hakim 'Amir in Moscow. The most widely 
publicized feature of 'Amir's visit was the announcement 
of the U.S.S.R.'s participation in the initial phase of 
the cherished High Dam scheme. On closer examination, 
the High Dam offer, although given maximum favorable 
publicity in order to avoid loss of face on either side, 
appears to have been in part an alternative to the 
Egyptian military shopping list, which was considerably 
scaled down. However, the several arms deals and the 
extremely popular High Dam offer are, in sum, a suf-
ficient obligation upon Nasir that the U.S.S.R. apparently 
concluded it could initiate wider Middle East operations, 
independent of him, without risk of a break with Egypt.

U.S.S.R. with a new avenue of approach to the area. A 
military delegation from the new Iraqi regime was in 
Moscow at the same time as 'Amir: since then, the 
Egyptians reportedly have been indignant that Soviet 
officials insist on dealing directly and privately with 
the Iraqis. It must have been a bitter revelation to 
Nasir, whom the Soviets at first flattered by prior 
consultation on each new move in the area, that he no 
longer enjoys acknowledged supremacy as the preferred 
channel for Soviet contact with the Arab world. 
Shortly after this development, communist 4oarty 
activity revived, especially in the Syrian region of the 
UAR, obviously with Soviet assent. This (dommunist renewal 
is openly inconsistent with Nasir's Arab policies, for 
in Iraq the Communist Party is now the leading element 
resisting the country's assimilation into the UAR, and 
in Syria the 'party has gone so far as to call publicly 
for separate parliamentary entities for Syria and Egypt, 
as well as "democratic freedoms" for party activity. In 
October, the Soviet anti-union position was obliquely 
endorsed in the non-Soviet (dommunist press. October 26 
L'Unita carried an article critical of Nasir and of 
regional mergers in the Middle East on the pattern of the 
UAR. Both Nasir and 'Abd al-Salam 'Arif in Iraq were at 
fault, the article wryly suggested, for wishing to "ignore 
the reality" of the importance of (communist and popular 
support to the Iraqi revolution, and for proposing "to 
apply to Iraq the same measures as in Egypt" (i.e., 
suppression). Coming more than a month after Presidium 
member Mukhitdinov's visit to Cairo, this article provided 
a blunt, if indirect, answer to a conversation which 
reportedly took place between the Soviet official and 
Nasir in Cairo, in which Nasir protested the U.S.S.R.'s 
obvious encouragement of renewed clandestine activity 
in Syria and 'Communist agitation among the Kurds. 
The break that has opened, in consequence, between 
communist and indigenous nationalist forces,such as the 
Ba'th movement, is fortunate for the West in that the 
Communists, by isolating themselves from the main stream 
of Arab nationalism and adopting an unpopular stance, 
have immeasurably weakened their appeal. Paradoxically, 
however, this situation does not lend itself in the short 
run to much improvement in Arab relations with the U.S. 
Since hyper-emotional anti-Westernism is the chief 
political welding tool of each group, a nationalist-
communist contest inevitably develops into a competition 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 44 
in baiting the Western powers, particularly the U.S. to 
which both have now assigned the role of chief "imperial-
ist conspirator." Ultimately, however, the U.S.S.R. 
stands to lose more than the U.S. from such infighting. 
To the extent that it supports its own protagonists, the 
U.S.S.R. jeopardizes its pose of disinterested champion 
of Arab nationalism. And in Iraq, where communist and 
pro-Egyptian forces are most evenly matched, the dead-
lock between them may yet give place to a third nationalist 
but more moderate -leadership. 
The most significant gains by any Middle Eastern 
Communist Party have been scored in Iraq the five 
. months of almost total political 
IRAQ license since the July 14 revolt. 
Capable, Moscow-trained leaders 
such as 'Aziz Sharif and 'Abd 
al-Qadir Ismatil returned during the first part of October 
from exile or hiding abroad (whence, though hampered by 
distance, they had all along exercised much direction of 
Iraqi (communist affairs). Subsequent reports identifying 
Syrian Communist and Tudeh Party leaders in Baghdad 
suggest that Iraq is for the moment replacing Damascus 
as a center of regional 'Communist liaison and planning. 
Such freedom of action is possible because the 
Communist Party of Iraq (CPI) and the Qasim government 
have discovered a common interest in resisting pressures 
from the Iraqi Ba'th party and other groups interested in 
assimilating Iraq to the UAR. Qasim is openly accepting 
Communist help, particularly in mobilizing the "street." 
He is allowing the party to organize and propagandize 
openly, and he has thus far overlooked the entry of 
numerous Communists into the government service itself. 
The actual extent and pace of this infiltration is 
difficult to assess: reports from pro-Western Iraqis 
(who want the US to intervene to redress the situation) 
and from Egyptian sources (who hope the U.S., out of 
fear of communism, will permit a similar action on their 
part) are obviously inflated. On the other hand, several 
crypto-Communists are sufficiently highly placed (one is 
in the Cabinet) to facilitate the placement of others. 
The Party is able to exploit the anxiety on the part of 
the new regime to replace everyone (even in the non-
political civil service grades) who held a post under 
the monarchy. Leftist and &ommunist sub-officials are 
also taking advantage of the preoccupation of their 
superiors with political infighting to assume active 
control of their departments.

Communists now, in effect, control the propaganda 
apparatus, have strong positions in the Education Ministry, 
bid have entered employment and begun organizing labor 
syndicates in the State Railway and Basra Port Adminis-
trations. This pattern suggests a calculated effort 
aimed at particularly sensitive areas of employment. 
Despite scattered reports (nearly all from Egyptian 
sources) that the CPI is rapidly expanding in the army 
and police, there is no evidence that significant inroads 
have yet been made in the security services. On avail-
able evidence, the maximum communist threat now lies in 
the CPI's undoubted control of the street mob, plus the 
fact that troop discipline, eroded by the aura of revo-
lutionary laissez-faire, might not hold in the face of 
vsevere civil disorders regardless of the loyalties 
(probably divided) of the officer corps. With the CPI 
impeccably supporting the government, turning out the 
mob on order and with full government collaboration, 
there has been no test as yet of relative strength. 
The immediate CPI tactic, supplemented by advice 
and false intelligence at the diplomatic level, has been 
to increase Qasim's sense of insecurity and isolation, 
feeding rumors of Western-inspired plots and, by a 
constantE'drumfire of hate propaganda, trying to preclude 
Qasim's turning to more moderate or pro-Western advisors. 
In frantic efforts to regain their own former position 
of major influence, pro-Egyptian elements have un-
intentionally contributed to this aim by resorting to 
hastily-concocted, abortive.;plots to remove Qasim himself. 
At the same time, there are some signs that the CPI may 
have overreached itself. The vigor and aggressiveness 
of the Communists' drive to influence the new regime has 
made them conspicuous, arousing both envy and alarm. 
Most politically knowledgeable Iraqis, including the 
upper officer grades, middle and upper-level civil 
servants and large commercial class, are fearful of 
internal communism (though not necessarily of the Soviet 
Union), while their admiration of Nasir stops short of 
desire to unite with the UAR. Inarticulate and un-
organized, this group, caught in the middle of an all-out 
fight between the pro-UAR militant fringe and the far 
left, is intimidated to the point of playing safe with 
vague leftist statements while privately speculating 
whether they could salvage more, after all, under the 
UAR. However, senior army officers of the division 
commander level, although non-political by training and 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 46 
preference, have repeatedly warned Qasim against going 
too far with the CPI and are reported to be /eady to take 
matters into their own hands if he does not heed. 
Qasim himself is probably sincere in his professed 
intention to turn away from the CPI as soon as dangers to 
his rule from other factions are reduced. Qasim is 
piobably also reluctant to move (although he has not 
admitted it) until all or most of the large Iraqi arms 
orders from the Soviet Bloc have arrived. Neither he nor 
his close advisers (notably Kamil al-Chadirchi, who is 
dangerously naive regarding communist aims and methods) 
seem aware of any danger in over-dependence on the CPI. 
Moreover, the problem of finding alternative support for 
the regime is compounded by economic stagnation, by the 
government's halting performance which has lost public 
confidence, and by tie fact that Qasimthimself does not 
display attributes of personal leadership. 
? Meanwhile the obvious opportunities offered by 
Qasim's dependency ard his complacent attitude toward the 
CPI are already being jeopardized by the pace of events 
and by the party's over-eagerness. By demanding arms for 
a ralommunist-controlled popular resistance movement, by 
directly challenging the army in a humiliating episode in 
Basra which demands redress, and by insistent pressures 
for specific policy lines (e.g., demanding execution of 
prominent figures from the old regime and efforts to 
prevent official U.S. visitors from coming to Iraq with 
the government's prior assent) the Communists are attempting 
to force their will upon the government too early, while 
Qasim and/or the army still apparently have the ability 
to resist or even to break them. Although these may be 
mere test maneuvers from which the party can recoil if 
unsuccessful, it appears likely that a test of strength 
with the CPI will be forced at communist initiative 
before Qasim wishes it, but at a time actually advantageous 
to the government. 
The Communists and Qasim have also developed a 
parallel coursd of action- in ' connection- ' 
with Iraq's largest ethnic minority group, the Kurds. 
Mulla Mustafa Barzani, Kurdish tribal leader who led the 
last large-scale armed uprising against the Baghdad 
government, self-exiled in the U.S.S.R. since the collapse 
of the brief Soviet-sponsored Republic of Mahabad in 1946, 
was allowed by Qasim and the Soviet government to return

to Iraq October 6. Barzani, whose name had become 
synonymous with Kurdish irredentism, was greeted with 
much excitement by Iraqi Kurds, who interpreted his 
return to mean that their long-cherished dream of an 
independent Kurdish state was on the point of being 
realized. Both official Iraqi and Soviet propaganda 
have been at pains since to play down this idea and 
stress limited Kurdish autonomy within the Iraqi Republic. 
Barzani's initial tour of the northern, predominantly 
Kurdish, provinces produced less stir than anticipated, 
and some anti-Barzani feeling on the part of the 
traditionally hostile tribes has shown itself: entire 
clans numbering in total over 100 people have decamped 
to Iran and claimed sanctuary there. 
Kurdistan is at present superficially quiet, but 
the feeling of malaise remains. In general, the deep-
seated desire for full independence, reawakened by recent 
events, seems to have outrun any present intent of either 
the government or the local Communists and is not easily 
put to rest. The attitudes and ambitions of Mulla 
Mustafa himself are not fully known; the sparse reports 
since his return suggest that he was not unduly influenced 
by his Soviet residence and is still dedicated primarily 
to Kurdish independence. Contacts between the Communist 
Party of Iraq, its Kurdish branch, and its wholly-controlled 
front, the Kurdish Democratic Party, have continued on a 
much increased scale since early September; in November, 
a common program for united action was worked out which, 
however, has the sound of a laborious compromise between 
the independence faction and the CPI proper. Much 
traktplling back and forth of deputations between Syrian 
and Iraqi Kurds also has been reported. 
There is no firm evidence that the U.S.S.R. (which 
almost certainly advised the Qasim regime on its Kurdish 
moves) intends for the present anything more than to 
weaken Iran and Turkey through nationalist appeals to 
their sizeable Kurdish minorities and to build up 'Com-
munist capabilities in the Kurdish areas. There is, 
however, obvious strategic utility to the U.S.S.R. in a 
landlocked small state, contiguous with its own Kurdish 
population, which contains Iraq's major oil fields and, 
in addition, is positioned to split Turkey and Iran and 
extend well down toward the Persian Gulf. These factors 
make an all-out 'ommunist drive for a "united, democratic 
Kurdistan" an attractive future possibility as a means of 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 48 
pressuring Arab leaders, or an alternative line if the 
Arab policy fails. 
The Egyptian communist movement, after a brief 
period of reunion in January 1958, is again torn by 
factional disputes. The of-
EGYPT ficial line remains one of support 
for the regime's foreign policy 
coupled with vigorous criticism 
of Nasir's handling of internal affairs. However, the 
party has begun to split more openly on the key question 
of how far to cooperate with Nasir and at what point to 
come into conflict. It is difficult to assess how much 
is ideological, as distinct from organizational power 
factors, in this quarrel, but there is some indication 
that the split may reflect, and be aggravated by, the 
hardening Soviet line toward Nasir. The arguments of the 
more numerous "loyalist" Communists, seem to parallel, in 
part, the rationalizations of the pseudo-communist national-
ists, while those who vigorously assault "Jamalism" as a 
bourgeois national.ist weakness are identifiable as old-
line party members, many of them from the former HADITU 
(Democratic Movement for National Liberation), one of the 
oldest of the Egyptian Communist groupings. They probably 
comprise, as a group, the hard-core and professional 
workers of the Egyptian movement; it is therefore significant 
that they are naN attacking Nasir and referring to his 
"Communist collaborators (who still dominate the movement) 
as "white collar Communists" who have been "bought" by 
soft jobs and fat salaries. However, there is fairly 
clear evidence that the disputes also reflect intra-party 
rivalries over questions of pay, position and authority. 
This wrangling, whatever its causes, has resulted in 
8 general breakdown of party discipline, marked by open 
disobedience to the high command and virtual cessation of 
external party activity. Two small activist groups which 
refused to join the union move in January are now working 
together as the "Communist Vanguard." The Vanguard was 
the only Egyptian Zommunist group tomise its voice against 
the "destruction of democracy" in Syria resulting from 
the union and has denounced the "loyal" Communists for 
"tailism," that is, for permitting themselves to be led 
by the nationalists.

The crackdown on internal communism anticipated 
in the wake of union did not materialize -- reportedly, 
Egyptians hoped to win the 
SYRIAN REGION majority of Syrian Communists to 
support of Nasir along the 
lines followed in Egypt. Instead, 
the SyVian Communists made use of the quiet interval to 
strengthen their clandestine organization and to heal 
an incipient Titoist split in their ranks. From abroad, 
Syrian and regional party dhief Bakdash issued statements 
in Rude Pravo (February 28) and L'Unita (March 2) en-
dorsing the UAR in lukewarm fashion but making plain the 
intention of the Communist Party of Syria and Lebanon 
(CPSL) to continue its "struggle" for "liberation." 
Speaking at the Seventh Conference of the Bulgarian 
Communist Party, he delivered the now-official endorsement 
of UAR foreign policy and criticism of its internal 
policies. At the Fifth Congress of the East German 
Communist Party on July 15, the day after the Iraqi 
revolution, he praised the revolt and attacked the U.S. 
landings in Lebanon. Even before Bakdash's return to 
Syria, on October 5, and the nearly simultaneous return 
of the key Iraqi dommunist leaders, Nasir reportedly was 
aware that the Iraqi Communist Party was in close touch 
with the CPSL, possibly receiving from the Syrian head-
quarters guidance for the conflict which soon developed 
over relations with Egypt. Just before his return, in 
an article in the September 1958 World Marxist Review, 
the new international communist journal, Bakdash posed 
for Arab Communists the problem of cooperation with the 
national bourgeoisie, in which he made plain the intention 
to resist dissolution of the Piarty and to work for Arab 
unity built not only on "liberation from imperialism" but 
also upon "democratic foundations." In the light of 
subsequent developments, and because of the authoritative 
quality of the journal in which it appeared, this article 
may have been the first official hint that the U.S.S.R. 
was about to resume support of local communist activity, 
and thus to challenge Nasir. 
Since his return, Bakdash appears to have concerned 
himself with redirecting regional strategy rather than 
with exclusively Syrian party affairs. Among other 
possibilities, the formation of a single party structure 
for the Middle East was hinted. By mid-July, Bakdash 
reportedly had concluded that "differences" in the 
political situations of Syria and Lebanon dictated the 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 50 
separation of the CPSL: possibly Lebanon is being written 
off temporarily in favor of more promising fields in Syria 
itself, Iraq and Jordan. The separation was announced in 
the December 14 issue of al-Akhbar, Beirut communist paper. 
The relatively minor role of the Communists in the Lebanese 
civil war may have justified such a step. On a more far-
reaching note, however, the same article also called for 
separate governing bodies for Syria and Egypt (in effect, 
an end to the union), fraternal relations with Iraq, 
closer ties with the Bloc countries, and an end to all 
Western economic aid. 
Communist 'party fortunes in Jordan have continued 
the decline set in motion, in mid-1957, by their over-
eagerness to grasp control of the 
JORDAN National Conference (a coordinating 
committee of nationalist, anti-
Western groups) at the zenith of 
nationalist strength and dommunist popularity. Many of 
the cadre members are still self-exiles in Syria, although 
many more have illegally reentered Jordan and, in hiding, 
are attempting to rebuild their organization against fairly 
effective governmental repression and under martial-law 
conditions of summary justice. Nevertheless, in September 
they were reported extending recruitment efforts to the 
Army and police. In the various attempts concoted since --
partly spontaneous, partly UAR-instigated -- to foment 
civil uprising or army revolt against the Jordanian throne, 
the activist element was plainly directed by hyper-
nationalists and/or UAR paid agents. The Communists have 
tried to associate themselves with these "popular" move-
ments but their role is clearly one of hangers-on. 
Meanwhile, among the political exiles in Syria who 
have waited in idleness for a year and a half for a 
triumphal return, the inevitable bickering has set in. 
The Communist Party of Jordan is further weakened by being 
now isolated from important segments of the Ba'th-Qawmiyin 
apparatus, and has itself developed a "Titoist" splinter 
movement. 
The communist party has made no gains in numerical 
strength in the past year, and has experienced a net loss 
in that the new Sudanese govern-
SUDAN ment is willing to take action 
against it while former Prime 
Minister Khalil contented himself 
with watching until what he considered to be a danger-point 
was reached. By mid-year the government-sponsored labor

organization (started in 1956 specifically as a counter-
attraction to a Communist-dominated labor federation) had 
been penetrated to the point that the ?ommunist element 
had taken control. The new government, however, abolished 
union activity in late November. More recently, the 
government has begun a crackdown on the party's major 
political front -7, synonymous with the Sudan Communist 
Party except in name -- the Anti-Imperialist Front. The 
Front lost its one parliamentary seat in the February-
March elections, and no eommunist-endorsed candidate 
succeeded, although there were some half-dozen Front 
aspirants who had Communist support. Collaboration between 
the Sudan Communist Party and the most prominent opposition 
group, the National Unionist Party (NUP) was active during 
the elections and reached a high point in June-July during 
debate on the U.S. aid bill. Although both the Communists 
and the NUP have been quiescent since the coup, clandestine 
liaison between them probably continues, and they can be 
expected in future to work together on specific common 
aims. 
? 
In Saudi Arabia there is still no evidence of 
organized -communist activity, nor would any such mani-
festation be tolerated. A brief, 
ARABIAN PENINSULA unprecedented visit to King Saud 
by the Soviet Ambassador to Damascus 
had no noticeable after-effects. 
Aden and the several principalities rimming the peninsula 
are likewise negative from the tommunist point of view. 
The riots of last year on Bahrain occasioned the seconding 
to the Shaykh's security forces of a number of British 
experts; taken together with the arrest and deportation 
of the ringleaders of the disturbances, this has guaranteed 
a year of unbroken calm, during which the local Communists 
have not raised their heads. 
Kuwait, with its large infusion of malcontent 
expatriates from all over the Arab world, has had a 
mscent but poorly organized ?Oommunist movement for 
several years. The inert nature of the local security 
apparatus does little to impede its growth: a more 
serious block, apparently, is the provincialism of the 
members who seem to have resisted the advice of a 
professional organizer reportedly despatched last year to 
weld the several cells into a centralized party structure. 
During the fall, with the several Arab parties from which 
these groups sprang presumably occupied with more pressing 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 52 
matters, the Kuwaiti Communists reportedly felt isolated, 
forgotten and dispirited. However, the renascense of the 
movement in Iraq, if continued, will soon be felt in 
Kuwait. Restless, frustrated nationalism in Kuwait is 
being largely directed, through press and radio propaganda, 
into pro-Nasir channels. Kuwait nationalist papers for 
the past eeveral months have deplored communist gains in 
Iraq as being inconsistent with Arab unity. 
The communist movement has not gained in either 
numbers or influence during the past year; on the other 
hand, there has been no burning 
ISRAEL issue dramatizing the U.S.S.R. 's 
pro-Arab policy, such as the Suez 
incident, which would occasion 
heavy losses. The chiei effort during the year waE the 
formation of the Arab Popular Front (formerly simply Arab 
Front), which began shortly after the May Day celehaTtions 
and is still going forward. Apparently fully endorsed by 
the Jewish segment of the MAKI (Israel Communist Party), 
the organization seems to have been intended both as a 
cover and as a means of reaching noncommunist Arabs on 
wider issues with specific appeal to them. It meant, in 
short, to restore the emotional quality of the old Arab 
Liberation Movement, this time under full communist 
auspices. For example, the Front endorsed the ending of 
military rule in the Arab-populated areas and the return 
of Arab refugees. The true nature of this grouping was 
known to the Israeli government from its inception, and 
the purely communist leadership disclosed itself so 
quickly to potential co-sponsors among the influential 
Arabs that they soon dropped out. At present, the Front 
is nearly synonymous with the Arab wing of MAKI, and has 
little influence or potential.

or poses a serious subversive threat, although they proba-
bly possess some trouble-making potential in the event of 
internal disturbances. By contrast, the Communists in 
Cyprus, where they are officially tolerated, and in Greece, 
where they operate under cover of a legal front organiza-
tion, improved their positions during the last year; the 
following section, consequently, will deal only with the 
Greek and Cypriot situations. 
During the past year, bommunist strategy has aimed 
primarily at expAnding the influence of its legal front 
organization, the United Democratic 
GREECE Left (EDA). Less emphasis has 
been given to the illegal Com-
munist Party of Greece (KKE) which, 
operating from headquarters behind the Iron Curtain in 
Bucharest, Rumania, has exercised control over EDA. EDA's 
long campaign to achieve respectability paid dividends in 
the May 1958 national parliamentary elections when, 
running independently, it secured 24 percent of the total 
vote and elected 79 members to Parliament. It is now the 
principal opposition party in Parliament. 
The following factors were probably responsible 
for EDA's:bnanticipated electoral successes: 
1. EDA campaigned more vigorously than 
any of the other participating parties and ap-
peared to have unlimited campaign funds. In 
contrast to the harassTentt of EDA candidates 
in previous elections by the Greek security forces, 
EDA was permitted a relatively free hand. 
2. EDA was able to exploit effectively the 
Cyprus controversy and the issues of economic and 
social reform. 
3. EDA apparently received a windfall anti-
Karamanlis protest vote which had no other quarter 
to which it could turn in view of the deterioration 
and generally discredited leadership of other left-
of-center parties. 
In its recent propaganda, EDA has sought to exploit 
a rising "neutralist" sentiment in Greece by opposing 
missile bases on Greek territory and by establishing 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 54 
"peace" committees to echo the Soviet line on disarmament. 
EDA has also sought to deprecate benefits accruing to 
Greece from its close friendship with the United States 
and its membership in NATO, by pointing to the allegedly 
unfavorable position of the U.S. and other NATO powers 
on Cyprus as opposed to that of the Soviet Bloc. Seeking 
further to 'enhance its newly won political respectability, 
EDA has carefully followed a moderate line, calling, for 
example, for a truly neutral Greece rather than a pro-
Soviet Greece. 
EDA activities in Greece at present encompass 
practically all political, economic and social sectors. 
An effective EDA political organization has been es-
tablished at all levels in the Greek administrative 
structure down to the basic village structure. EDA has 
capitalized on its control of the municipal administration 
in Kavalla, and several other smaller areas, and it 
continues to exercise strong influence over the Salonika 
municipal administration. 
Special groups have been established for women, 
students and youth. EDA has also recently put renewed 
emphasis on the labor movement. The Communists have long 
held considerable influence over such groups as the tobacco 
and maritime workers, and through them they have been able 
to gain control over various labor federations and labor 
centers. In the recent conference of the General Con-
federation of Greek Workers (GSEE), communist-controlled 
elements secured participation in the GSEE Executive 
Committee. EDA has also established a New Agrarian Move-
ment (NAK). EDA publishes the morning daily Avqhi  
(circulation about 10,000), and exercises considerable 
influence over Anexartitos aps,a, a new afternoon daily. 
During the past year an increasingly closer relation-
ship between the Soviet Embassy and EDA has been apparent 
and there is evidence that the Soviet Embassy is supplying 
the bulk of EDA's operating funds. Through Soviet ef-
forts, the Greek-Soviet League has been strengthened, and 
similar friendship societies have been established with 
most of the Soviet satellites, as well as a "Union of 
Friends of New China." Soviet-satellite embassies have 
spearheaded the establishment of various peace and anti-
missile committees utilizing EDA personnel, and these 
same channels are being increasingly used to promote 
expanded trade between Greece and the Bloc.

EDA's prospects for the immediate future will depend 
in large measure on how the Karamanlis Government elects 
to deal with it. Should the -?:)vernment chose to do so, 
it is in a sufficiently strong position to hamper severely 
EDA's activities. Since the elections, the .government has 
begun to follow a tougher line with respect to EDA and a 
number of EDA officials have been arrested on charges of 
affiliation with the outlawed KKE. Moreover, there are 
indications that harsher counter-measures against EDA are 
forthcoming. In any case, in future municipal and national 
elections it is extremely unlikely that EDA will be 
permitted the free hand it had in the last elections. 
Although the Communist Party in Cyprus, the Reform 
Party of the Working People (AKEL), has been illegal since 
December 1955, its tactics of 
CYPRUS moderation and non-violence have 
restored it to a quasi-legal status. 
Regarding the present Cyprus 
question, AKEL has contented itself with occasional state-
ments endorsing "self-determination," and periodic calls 
for a united front. To this end, AKEL has a number of 
times reaffirmed its support of Archbishop Makarios as 
the spokesman of the Cypriot people. Available evidence 
indicates that it has not engaged in any of the bombings, 
killings or sabotage which have occurred on Cyprus. AKEL 
has ref,fained from counter-attacking the Greek Cypriot 
Terrorist organization, EOKA, on the several occasions 
when EOKA has killed AKEL members, and has met_OKAI attacks 
with repeated calls for a united front. 
All the AKEL leaders who were imprisoned by the 
Cyprus Government have by now been released. The AKEL 
dailybnewspaper, Neos Democratis, which was banned, has 
been replaced by a similar journal, liarmalli, which is - 
published without legal restrictions. The mayors of three 
of the six largest towns are either communist or fellow-
travelers. AKEL control over the Pan-Cypriot Federation 
of Labor (PEO), which was not banned under the December 
1955 legislation, remains unchallenged. PEO now has a 
claimed membership in excess of 30,000, which represents 
well over half of all organized labor on the island. It 
is led by Andreas Ziartides, a Moscow-trained Communist 
who is regarded as a very capable and shrewd administrator 
and organizer.

SECRET/NOFORN 56 
Because of its excellent organization, its strong 
position in the municipal administration, and its influ-
ence in the labor movement, AKEL can be expected to 
improve its position under any kind of increased self-
government, unless the Cyprus Government should decide 
to suppress it. Because of its favorable position, AKEL 
apparently has decided that the wisest course under 
current conditions is to bide its time until the political 
future of Cyprus becomes more clearly defined, hoping to 
end up in a strong position whatever the ultimate solution 
of the Cyprus question.

AFRICA 
Aside from continued anti-government activity by 
'oommunist-oriented groups in the Union of South Africa 
and Cameroun, the main communist 
INTRODUCTION effort to penetrate Africa in 
1958 continued, on an increased 
scale, to take the form of 
diplomatic, trade, and cultural exchange overtures to 
the independent nations of Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana, 
Guinea, Liberia, and Ethiopia. 
Communist and Egyptian efforts in Africa apparently 
continued to coincide, insofar as they were directed 
toward the destruction of Western influence. The Cairo-
based Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee (sponsored by 
Egypt, with Soviet and Chinese Communist support) showed 
some promise of developing into a major channel of 
communist influence. 
A communist party was organized in Madagascar 
during the year, but other than this the only functioning 
parties are those in the Union of South Africa and 
Morocco (where they are legally banned but still active), 
and in Tuni:ia. The Moroccan and Tunisian parties are 
weak and ineffectual, and neither has benefited 
significantly from the Soviet Bloc's limited successes 
at the governmental level in both countries. Each 
numbers only a few hundred members and is still regarded 
by the dominant nationalists as essentially a foreign 
organization.

In the independent African states and in those 
territories where evolution toward self-government or 
independence has been permitted 
PATTERN OF by the colonial power, the ability 
COMMUNIST ACTIVITY of Communists to inspire or 
control nationalist movements has 
been severely limited. In both 
instances, dominant nationalist movements have virtually 
monopolized popular political activity, and the com-
munists have been compelled, as a rule, to operate within 
the framework of the existing nationalist organization. 
African radical na-6ionalist leaders, for their part, tend 
to have,'a somewhat ambivalent attitude toleard communism. 
Many if not most of them are at least partly Marxist in 
their ideological ancestry and 'some have, at one time or 
another, accepted communist collaboration in their fight 
against colonial rule. Yet most African political parties 
are concerned to establish their own unchallenged dominance, 
and, despite their affinity for the ideas of the left, 
they are jealous of competition from any source whatsoever. 
In the circumstances, they have tended to resist any ef-
forts to create indigenous communist movements. 
The Communists, since their present influence is 
so small, have concentrated on labor, youth, and student 
organizations from which the next generation of African 
political leaders will probably come. To some degree, 
the_tetill?ers of labor and youth organizations can be 
expected to form the radical opposition to the entrenched 
leadership when the post-independence "honeymoon" of 
national unity ends. 
In Ghana and Guinea, the unquestioned dominance 
and monolithic structure of the ruling nationalist parties 
have continued to prevent the emergence of organized 
communist activity. In both cases -- although more so 
in Guinea than in Ghana -- the extreme left wing of the 
nationalist parties lacks neither prestige nor respecta-
bility, but has remained within the bounds dictated by 
rigid party discipline and personal loyalty to Kwame 
Nkrumah and Sekou Toure, the Prime Ministers of Ghana 
and Guinea respectively. In Guinea especially, many 
present and potential leaders have been strongly influ-
enced by Marxism, and labor, youth and student organiza-
tions may be a potentially serious source of leftwing 
pressure on Toure, who at present holds almost undisputed 
authority. 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 58 
In Madagascar, the Communists are still weak, al-
though they have been somewhat stronger, perhaps, than 
elsewhere in French Africa, probably because they were 
able to identify themselves with the harshly-repressed 
nationalist uprising of 1947. An important element in 
the future prospects of the newly organized Madagascar 
Communist Party will be the attitude toward communism of 
the immensely popular "martyred" nationalist leaders of 
1947, who will probably return from exile during the 
coming year. The provincial government of Diego-Suarez 
is reportedly controlled by Communists, and Communists 
were probably present at the 1958 "Independence Congress" 
of groups demanding immediate secession from France. In 
the September 1958 constitutional refdrendum, however, 4 
the advocates of immediate independence -- who are by no 
means all Communists -- were able to muster only a 
quarter of the electorate. 
Elsewhere in French Tropical Africa, the main com-
munist political vehicle, particularly in Senegal, is the 
Parti de ilIncingLidence Africaine (PAI), an ultra-radical 
organization composed largely of returned students, which 
was established in 1957 in an effort to check the waning 
of the already small communist influence in the national-
ist movements. For the time being, at least, PAI is weak, 
but if the major nationalist parties lose momentum, it 
may eventually become a force to be reckoned with. 
However, a new movement, the Mouvement Africain de 
Liberation Nationale (MLN),also concentrated in Senegal 
which is strongly anticommunist but committed to immediate 
independence and African socialism, may counteract the 
appeal of and win converts from the PAI. In the September 
referendum on the De Gaulle Constitution -- the PAI 
(together with various student, youth, and labor groups) 
unsuccessfully campaigned for a "no" vote, i.e., for 
immediate independence. The only territory, Guinea, 
which chose -- practically unanimously -- to vote itself 
out of the French Community, did so not at the instigation 
of the PAI but under the influence of the historic 
nationalist radicalism of the Guinea section of the 
Rassemblement 122m2a.gligEg Africain (RDA). Sekou Toure 
is, indeed, the very person who led the nationalists 
against communist control of the labor unions in 1956-57. 
Although Communists have been able to maintain 
common cause with nationalists in the French West African 
labor movement, they have done so only by yielding the

control which they held until 1956 in favor of membership 
in the new, nationalist-dominated Union Generale des 
Travailleurs d'Afrique Noire (UGTATIT-- Efforts to penetrate 
trade union movements have continued elsewhere in Africa 
but thus far not with conspicuous success. 
In most independent African countries, official 
Soviet Bloc contacts at the governmental level were of 
considerably more importance --
OFFICIAL BLOC or potential importance -- than 
CONTACTS internal communist activity. The 
Bloc stepped up its political, 
economic, and cultural offensive 
in 1958, pushing for exchanges of diplomatic, trade and 
cultural representatives, urging African states to loosen 
further their ties with the West, and encouraging them to 
take up a neutralist position in the Afro-Asian bloc. 
During 1958, Communist Bloc overtures in Morocco 
and Tunisia achieved a measure of initial success. The 
first Soviet Ambassador arrived in Morocco, and the 
Moroccans have agreed to negotiate an exchange of diplomatic 
representatives with Communist China. At the same time, 
Tunisian and Moroccan trade with the Bloc increased sharply 
and both countries warmly welcomed Bloc cultural presen-
tations. At a time of rising North African dissatisfaction 
with the West -- over the continuing war in Algeria, over 
Tunisia's need for arms, and over the presence of U.S. 
bases in Morocco -- these Bloc efforts have apparently 
strengthened factions in both Tunisia and Morocco which 
advocate disengagement from a pro-Western orientation. 
By the end of 1958, Moroccans seemed virtually unanimous 
in support of "non-dependence." Even Tunisia's President 
Bourguiba has hinted at "non-alignment" and has sought 
arms from Yugoslavia and Czechcslovakia to supplement 
those offered by the West. He has, however, apparently 
dropped for the time being the intention (announced 
publicly on July 25th) of exchanging diplomatic repre-
sentatives with the U.S.S.R. and of recognizing the 
Chinese Communists. 
Although the expected exchange of diplomatic 
missions between Ghana and the U.S.S.R. did not materialize 
during the past year, it seems likely to occur during 1959. 
The two countries agreed in January 1958 to establish 
diplomatic relations at the Embassy level "in due course," 
and there is some evidence that the U.S.S.R. has shown 
impatience with subsequent delays in establishing missions. 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 60 
The reasons for Ghanaian delay are not altogether clear: 
aside from possible policy reasons..involvingCGhanaian 
relations with the West, they may involve practical 
administrative problems. Plans for establishing a 
Ghanaian Embassy in Moscow, hoever, reportedly have 
advanced to a point where the designation of an Ambassador 
has been discussed within the hierarchy of the Convention 
Peoples' Party. 
Because of financial stringencies and strained 
relations with France, the newly independent Republic of 
Guinea is probably moving somewhat more rapidly than Ghana 
did to establish diplomatic and economic contacts with 
communist countries. In general, however, the present 
Guinea government's attitude to communism and its pattern 
of relations with the Sino-Soviet Bloc will probably 
parallel those of the Nkrumah regime in Ghana. Communist 
efforts in Guinea are likely to focus on government-to-
government approaches with offers of trade, technicians 
and capital, the success of which will largely depend on 
the developing Western policy toward Guinea. 
The Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's 
Solidarity Council in Cairo emerged during the year as an 
important potential instrument for 
AFRO-ASIAN communist penetration of Africa. 
SOLIDARITY COUNCIL Founded as a continuing body by 
the communist-tinged Afro-Asian 
Solidarity Conference in Cairo 
in December 1957, the Council's Secretariat is slated to 
have representatives from a total of eleven countries, 
including the U.S.S.R., Communist China, UAR, and India. 
Three African countries are represented: Cameroun, Sudan, 
and Ghana. It is believed that not all of the repre-
sentatives have yet been named. The Secretariat is 
financed principally by the UAR, U.S.S.R., and Communist 
China, but the Egyptians have so far dominated its 
activities. The U.S.S.R. and Communist China also attempt 
to exert considerable influence, although they do not 
seem to have been particularly successful in the case of 
the Secretariat's day-to-day operations. 
From the communist point of view, participation in 
the Secretariat and Secretariat-sponsored activities of-
fers several advantages: the "respectability" which comes 
from identification with the Afro-Asian movement; the 
concomitant opportunity to help undermine the Western

position in Africa; and a foothold which may prove in-
creasingly useful for independent Soviet activity. Insofar 
as it is concerned with the liquidation of Western influ-
ence, the Secretariat offers the Bloc an opportunity to 
harionthize its short-term aims in Africa with those of 
Egypt. The UAR is aware that long-term Soviet objectives 
do not necessarily coincide with its own; hence its ef-
forts to maintain control over the Secretariat's operations. 
The Secretatiat's principal activities in 1958, 
most of which were focussed on Africa, consisted of: 
(1) issuing propaganda statemerts backing nationalist groups 
in dependent African territories and supporting various 
"protest days," e.g., "Imperialists Quit Africa Day" --
December 1; (2) assisting in preparing the violently anti-
colonialist output of Radio Cairo and Egypt's semi-
clandestine Voice of Free Africa; (3) supporting the 
activities of various African nationalists residing in 
Cairo, e.g., John Kale of the Uganda National Congress, 
Dr. Felix Moumie of the Union des Populations du Cameroun 
(UPC), and Africans from Kenya, Eritrea, Somalia, Zanzibar, 
and South Africa; and (4) organizing Afro-Asian conferences, 
such as the December 1958 Afro-Asian Economic Conference 
at Cairo, and the youth conference planned for Cairo in 
February 1959. 
The racial problem, which permeates every aspect 
of South African life and thought, continued to provide 
the country's proscribed but 
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA active underground communist move-
ment with opportunities for 
successful exploitation. The 
white parliamentary opposition has been discredited in 
African eyes, by its ineffectual resistance to the govern-
ment's apartheid program and by its own refusal to stand 
on a forthright platform of racial cooperation. The 
continued exacerbation of race relations now ironically 
suggests that the. Union's hard-core communists (mostly 
whites and Indians) may find it increasingly difficult 
to win acceptance for the multi-racial approach which 
is the basic element in the South African party's line. 
Communist efforts to consolidate control over the 
infiltrated African National Congress (ANC) led to an 
important split in the powerful Transvaal branch organ-
ization, in which the "Africanist" faction (advocating 
an exclusively African rather than multi-racial approach 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 62 
to politics) withdrew to set up a rival organization.1 
It remains to be seen whether this can become a real 
alternative to the Congress. If it does, the recent split 
may prove to have been a serious setback for the Communists. 
For the present, however, the defection of the Transvaal 
Africanists has weakened the anticommunists remaining in 
the other provincial branches of the ANC. Communist 
ascendancy in South Africa's other major nonwhite political 
organizations -- the Indian and Colored Congresses -- has 
continued unabated. 
The ineptly handled mass treason trial of 95 leaders 
of various anti-government groups collapsed during the 
year, although the government has promised to bring new 
charges against the leaders in 1959. The major beneficiaries 
of the proceedings so far have been the comparatively few 
Communists involved, who have gained a cloak of respecta-
bility and martyrdom by being lumped together with respected 
liberal figures. 
The ANC's communist-dominated leadership probably 
broke even on the two major mass protest campaigns which 
it organized during 1958. The three-day protest strike 
during the national elections was an almost complete 
failure. The ANC found an opportunity to recoup its 
losses, however, in the government's insistence on extending 
the pass system to African women. The demonstrations which 
followed -- in which hundreds of African women, many with 
children on their backs, deliberately provoked arrest --
restored the ANC's reputation for effectiveness and 
identified it with opposition to a policy which has 
probably created more bitterness among Africans in the 
Union than any other single apartheid measure of recent 
years. 
In the Trust Territory of Cameroun, the armed 
rebellion carried on at intervals since 1955 by the out-
lawed Union des Populations du 
CAMEROUN Camerorin?TOPerwas ended for all 
practical purposes by French 
military action which culminated in September in the . 
death in the field of the UPC's leader, Ruben Um Nyobe. 
1. Although there are several tendemies and groups within 
the ANC, control over the organization's local branches 
has been divided between Communists and Africanists.

In the meantime, the French administration has moved with 
some rapidity to introduce internal autonomy into Cameroun, 
and has now agreed to grant independence in 1960. 
It is questionable, however, whether the existing 
legal parties (which lack the UPC's distinction of having 
come up the hard way), would be able to survive a re-
surgence of the UPC -- either legalized in its own name 
or reconstituted under another. The UPC's long suppression 
has led it to continue to cooperate with the Communists 
long after other French African nationalist movements 
severed those connections, and its dependent position has 
made it all the more vulnerable to communist influence. 
Since the failure of its armed rebellion, however, the 
UPC has apparently sought to reorient itself away from 
its communist ties toward the "respectable anticolonialism" 
of, say, the Accra Conference of Independent African States. 
The sincerity of this shift is as yet uncertain.

V. SOUTH ASIA 
BLOC ACTIVITIES 
? 
The Sino-Soviet Bloc continued in 1958 to treat 
the neutralist countries of South Asia as important target 
areas. Members of the Bloc maintained their efforts 
toward economic and cultural penetration of India and 
stepped up their activities in the smaller countries of 
the region -- Afghanistan, Ceylon, and Nepal. Relations 
between Pakistan and the Bloc continued to be cool, and 
no significant improvement appears likely under Pakistan's 
Western-oriented military regime. 
New aid agreements between India and communist 
countries during the year included a $21 million credit 
by Czechoslovakia for the equipment of a foundry-forge 
and a loan of $18 million by Rumania to help finance 
construction of an oil refinery. Cumulative Bloc economic 
aid to India amounted to approximately $315 million by 
the end of 1958, the U.S.S.R. and Czechoslovakia con-
tributing about 98 percent of the total. Plimary emphasis 
in the Bloc aid program has been consistently on financing 
heavy industries, a policy which pleases the Government 
of India and also permits the Bloc to associate itself 
with large projects that have popular appeal. 
Two new economic aid agreements during 1958 added 
to the already extensive credits which Afghanistan had 
previously accepted from communist sources, particularly 
the U.S.S.R. In January the Soviet Union provided a long-
term credit of $15 million to finance oil exploration 
and exploitation activities in the northern portion of 
the country, and in March Czechoslovakia agreed to 
furnish coal mining equipment valued at about $500,000. 
Meanwhile, the Government of Afghanistan accelerated 
its use of funds from the $100 million Soviet line of 
credit extended in 1956; anEstimated $55 million had 
been utilized by September 1958. There are now an 
estimated 440 Soviet economic experts in Afghanistan, 
including a bureau of 30 Soviet engineers which has been 
established in Kabul to work with the Afghan Ministry of 
Public Works and the Ministry of Mines and Industries. 
Two hundred and thirty additional Soviet technicians are 
expected to be stationed in northern Afghanistan under

the oil exploration agreement. The Soviet experts con-
tinued to refrain from engaging in political activity in 
Afghanistan but were probably successful in enhancing 
the Soviet Union's prestige by their professional ef-
ficiency and in paving the way for further economic and 
technical penetration by the U.S.S.R. by their "correct" 
behavior. The Government of Afghanistan continued to 
expound the principle of welcoming aid "without strings" 
from any source, although early in 1958 it declared it 
would decline for the time being any further aid that 
would add to the country's heavy foreign debt. 
Various trade and barter agreements were still 
channeling a large portion of Afghanistan's foreign trade 
through Bloc markets at the end of 1958. Trade statistics 
for 1958 are not available, but there was probably a 
continuation of the trend observed in 1956-57 -- the most 
recent period for which data are available -- when the 
U.S.S.R. was Afghanistan's largest source of imports and 
a close second to India as a market for its exports. : 
Some Afghan officials have .expressed concern over the 
country's increasing commercial dependence on the U.S.S.R., 
and conclusion of a transit agreement with Pakistan in 
June 1958 (transit facilities for landlocked 'Afghanistan 
were interrupted by political differences with Pakistan 
in 1955) may permit some diversion of trade from the 
U.S.S.R. However, the U.S.S.R. will probably continue 
as Afghanistan's major trading partner during the coming 
year. 
In addition, in 1958 Afghanistan continued to 
receive substantial deliveries of military equipment 
from the U.S.S.R. under a special Soviet line of credit 
estimated at $25-35 million opened in 1956. The actual 
value of military supplies received by Afghanistan to 
date is estimated, however, at considerably more than 
the total Soviet credit because deliveries appear to have 
been made at substantial discounts. The two Soviet 
military missions in Afghanistan established to train 
Afghan forces in the use of Soviet equipment stepped up 
their activities in 1958. There were an estimated 100 
Soviet instructors in these missions toward the end of 
the year. In addition, an estimated 50-100 Afghan of-
ficers received military instruction in the U.S.S.R. 
during 1958. Heavy reliance on the Soviet Union for 
military equipment and training has already increased 
Afghanistan's vulnerability to Soviet pressure, and may 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 66 
compromise Afghanistan's continued policy of neutralism 
in the cold war. Soviet military and political influence 
appeared to be given a boost toward the end of 1958 by 
Afghanistan's sharply adverse reaction to the new 
military regime in Pakistan and to reports of new bi-
lateral military discussions by the U.S. with both 
Pakistan and Iran. 
As a corollary to its efforts at economic and 
military penetration, the (-communist Bloc has also stepped 
up its cultural offensive toward Afghanistan. Soviet 
President Voroshilov visited Kabul in October, and, a 
steady stream of Afghans were invited during the Yar to 
visit the Soviet Union. By playing host to small and 
carefully selected groups of journalists, government, press 
and radio officials, well-known artists an0 educators, the 
U.S.S.R. probably made headway in establishing closer 
cultural ties with key groups in Afghanistan. This policy. 
is already paying dividends for the Soviet Union in an 
increasingly leftist bent in the Afghan press and tbe use 
of a greater volume of Tass material. 
In Nepal, a key development was the King's three-
week visit to the U.S.S.R. in June, which ushered in a 
Soviet campaign to strengthen the U.S.S.R.'s position 
in this Himalayan kingdom. The King had several meetings 
with Khrushchev, and the Soviet leaders appear to have 
spared no effort to flatter and impress him. The U.S.S.R. 
offered the King a 50-bed hospital as a present for his 
birthday, which occurred during the visit, and this offer 
was accepted. As announced in the joint communique 
signed at the end of the visit, the Soviets offered an 
unspecified amount of economic assistance to Nepal. As 
the first step in working out the details of this agree-
ment, the Soviet Ambassador to Nepal, who is resident 
in New Delhi, visited Katmandu during December with a 
team of 22 technical experts. As an earnest of their 
good intentions, the delegation arrived in Nepal in an 
Ilyushin-14 airplane which will reportedly be given to 
King Mahendra as a gift from Voroshilov, expected to 
visit Nepal early in 1959. Soviet aid plans for Nepal 
are as yet unclear. However, there are indications that 
if it offers extensive assistance the Soviet Union runs 
the risk of antagonizing India which considers Nepal 
within its own sphere of influence.

In February 1958, the Soviet Union concluded 
economic aid and bilateral trade agreements with the 
Government of Ceylon providing for a credit of $28.4 
million to be repaid in 12 years either in Ceylonese 
goods or convertible currency, at 2.5 percent interest. 
This credit will cover development projects and flood 
rehabilitation, and the U.S.S.R. will also furnish 
technical assistance and training. Later in the year 
Ceylon accepted a loan of $10.5 million from Communist 
China to be used for flood relief. Since the Bandaranaike 
government came into office in April 1956, Sino-Soviet 
Bloc economic aid to Ceylon has totaled almost $60 million 
as against some $40 million from free world sources. 
PAKISTAN 
Internal developments during 1958 affecting com-
munist movements in the countries of South Asia were of 
importance primarily in Pakistan, Ceylon, and India. 
Pakistan's small and faction-ridden communist movement 
was given at least a temporary setback by the military 
coups d'etat of October 1958, but communist leaders hope 
eventually to turn this to their advantage. Prior to the 
L.9.11p.?, Pakistan's Communists, who were outlawed as a 
political party in July 1954, maintained their attempts to 
infiltrate other organizations. Although handicapped by a 
shortage of funds and reliable party workers, they scored 
some impressive results. Immediately following the 
imposition of the military rule, the Pakistan police 
arrested a score or more of the leading communist workers 
and journalists in both wings of the country, although 
some party workers in East Pakistan successfully evaded 
arrest by going underground or escaping to India. Com-
munists in West Pakistan have made no effort to organize 
resistance to the military regime, having apparently 
chosen to wait in the hope that the present government 
will eventually become discredited or weakened by 
internal rifts. East Pakistani Communists have been 
more active. In November they reportedly summoned a 
conference of party workers to meet in Calcutta to repair 
their organizational links and adopt a program of activity. 
Internal communist activity in the immediate future will 
undoubtedly center on East Pakistan (East Bengal), where 
political consciousness is much more deeply developed 
than in West Pakistan. The Communists in East Pakistan 
have a handy base of support in the adjoining Indian 
SECRET/NOFORN

states of West Bengal and Assam. They appear well placed 
to manipulate latent Bengali resentment against domination 
by Karachi, should the military regime fail to live up to 
its promises. 
CEYLON 
Certain leftists in Ceylon's coalition cabinet 
continued their pressure for radical economic measures 
during 1958, but these measures were not pushed as 
aggressively or as overtly as previously since popular 
support for radicalism and popular enthusiasm for closer 
ties with communist powers declined. Ceylon experienced 
the most marked internal instability it has known since 
independence. The shaky Bandaranaike government failed 
to provide effective leadership. The country's economy 
continued to deteriorate. Long-standing tension between 
the majority Sinhalese and the minority Ceylon Tamils, 
exacerbated in part by the government's pro-Sinhalese 
policy, exploded in 1958. Ceylon has been under emergency 
rule since late May following an outbreak of violent 
encounters between these two communities, resulting in an 
undetermined number of deaths (the government claims 159 
were killed but the actual figure is probably larger). 
Each of the three rival Marxist parties in Ceylon 
is trying to exploit this situation to its own advantage. 
These three parties, all of which depend mainly on trade 
union and other urban support, occupy different positions 
in the Ceylonese political spectrum. The one with the 
largest popular following, the Trotskyite Lanka Sama 
Samaja Party (LSSP) headed by N.M. Perera, is the leading 
opposition party and has consistently stood for equal 
treatment of Sinhalese and Tamils. It formerly supported 
some "progressive" governmental measures but in October 
declared its intention to bring the government down. 
The Moscow-oriented Ceylon Communist Party (CCP) 
previously gave the government even more support, mainly 
because of the government's avowed socialist aims, and 
at the same time soft-pedaled its own pro-parity stand 
on the communal question in view of the government's pro-
Sinhalese policy. Party leaders now recognize that the 
CCP's ambiguous position of neither wholly supporting 
nor wholly opposing the government inhibited party 
militance, gave the impression of lack of principle, and 
consequently reduced its popular appeal. After a period

69 SECRET/NOFORN 
of soul-searching, the party adopted a more critical at-
titude toward the government in late 1958 without quite 
demanding its downfall. By the end of the year the CCP 
still had not resolved its basic dilemma; unity and 
struggle, it finds, are a difficult combination. The 
smallest Marxist party, an independent communist group 
called the Revolutionary Lanka Sama Samaja Party, is a 
part of the government coalition. Its leader, the very 
able Minister of Food and Agriculture Philip Gunawardena, 
has thoroughly identified himself with the government's 
pro-Sinhalese policy. Recognizing the public trend 
against radicalism, in mid-1958 he publicly attacked 
communism and Communists generally and now appears to be 
soft-pedaling somewhat his pressure for radical economic 
measures. 
The Marxist parties can be expected to exploit the 
continued economic difficulties which are in prospect, 
and will probably place increased reliance on the strike 
as a political weapon. The pervasive communal question 
complicates the picture, since it cuts across traditional 
political and class lines. It is possible that, in the 
jockeying for position as the present coalition govern-
ment weakens, there may be new political alignments that 
will include or at least affect the fortunes of the 
Marxist parties. 
INDIA 
In 1958 the Communist Party of India (CPI) went 
publicly on record in favor of pursuing "socialism by 
peaceful means" and accepted, for the present at least, 
the position of a "loyal opposition" committed to 
functioning within the Indian constitution. By playing 
up its peaceful nature and denying foreign domination 
the CPI hopes to integrate itself more fully into the 
Indian environment and gain increased rk-,3pectability, 
thereby attracting mass support which will enable the 
party to capture India state by state in coming elections. 
However, Indian Communists realize that progress through 
reliance solely on the party's ability to poll votes is 
likely to be a slow process. Thus, they have maintained 
their covert organizations and stepped up their efforts 
to penetrate and form "united fronts" with other Indian 
parties in an effort, as one party spokesman put it, "to 
get them to alter their programs and policies to fit in 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 70 
with ou/s and finally, to adopt our methods on an all-
India basis." Despite its increased public emphasis on 
democratic means, the communist goal remains the same: 
the achievement of absolute power in India. Extensive 
reliance on democratic methods is likely to last only 
as long as this tactic furthers progress toward the goal. 
The trend toward using democratic means to destroy 
democracy -- a tactic which the CPI has followed with 
varying enthusiasm since 1950 --
THE PEACEFUL ROAD was given a fillip by the party's 
TO SOCIALISM success in the 1957 Indian general 
elections and by Moscow's an-
nounced support for this approach. 
It reached its hioghest point at the,Special Party Congress 
held by the CPI at Amritsar in April 1958. obAt this con-
ference the party laid the groundwork for attracting mass 
support by adjusting party policy to attract classes 
hitherto ignored or regarded as enemies and by playing 
down the party's international ties and its previous use 
of violence and subversion as roads to power. 
Under the new CPI constitution adopted at Amritsar, 
the party says that it "strives to achieve full democracy 
and Socialism by peaceful means." This constitution omits 
the clause in the former document that the CPI is part 
of the international communist movement and states that 
the CPI, while drawing on "the rich experience of the 
International Working Class Movement," formulates "its 
policies and determines its line of action in accordance 
with the interests and needs of the *(Indian) people." 
In addition, the CPI at Amritsar brought its administrative 
structure, superficially at least, into line with that 
of the Congress Party. Names such as "Politburo" and 
cell" were discarded in favor of branches and committees, 
and the party is now playing up its "democratic" organ-
ization. 
Although the major decisions at Amritsar were 
resolved in favor of the "rightists" within the party, 
agreement on the current tactical 
REVISIONISM line was far from unanimous. 
Few party members favor an 
immediate return to revolutionary 
activity, but many disagree with the extent to which the 
party has been committed to parliamentary methods. 
Factional bickering at Amritsar centered primarily 
around the degree of support to be given Nehru and the 
Government of India (GOI), the crucial question of whether

the CPI once voted into power would permit itself to be 
voted out, and the fear that the CPI would lose its dis-
tinctive character by aping other Indian parties. In 
view of this continuing disagreement within the party, 
the "rightists," who hold that the "national bourgeoisie" 
will join with the Communists as in China when a showdown 
comes, found it necessary to make certain concessions to 
the "leftists," who maintain that in the final struggle 
the "nationalist" and "imperialist" bourgeoisie will 
unite against the Communists. The leftists found solace 
in the firm restatement of Marxist-Leninist principles 
in the new party constitution and in the political 
resolution's flexibility and scattered contradictions 
which leave considerable latitude f6r interp?.etation. 
Some party leaders are aware that relaxation of 
membership requirements and the development of a "mass" 
Communist -Tarty may reduce intra-party discipline and 
ideological dedication. In this context, it is of 
significance that the CPI launched during 1958 a strong 
attack against "revisionism," which a party leader 
defined as an attempt to "turn the party to the path 
of class collaboration and reformism within the frame-
work of bourgeois society." Writing in the CPI monthly 
New Age in July, Bhupesh Gupta, leader of the communist 
bloc in the upper house of Parliament, made a strong 
case for Indian communists continuing to act and talk 
like classical Communists. What is needed, he said, is 
"not only a mass party, but a mass Communist Party.... 
Most of the newcomers to the leading organs of the party 
remain more or less strangers to the fundamentals of 
Marxism-Leninism." Gupta concluded with an attack on 
the two chief, inter-related pitfalls of communism today. 
"For the victory of socialism, both revisionism and 
bourgeois nationalism have to be ideologically and 
politically defeated and ultimately uprooted." This 
attack on revisionism was made part of CPI policy on 
November 13, 1958, when the party Secretariat issued 
a statement on this subject. Indian Communists, the 
Secretariat said, "are pledged to defend the principle 
of proletarian internationalism and reject all talks (sic) 
and action which disturb the unity of the world communist 
movement and world working class." Following a strong 
attack on Yugoslavia, the statement concluded, "The Com-
munist Party of India is pledged to fight revisionism 
and dogmatism in its own ranks and maintain the purity of 
the Marxist-Leninist principles." 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 72 
The fear of revisionism creeping into party ranks, 
the difficulties encountered by the communist government 
in Kerala State, Prime Minister 
OPPOSITION TO NEHRU Nehru's outspoken criticism of 
communism, and, probably, direction 
from Moscow induced a hardening 
of CPI policy and a shift toward the left by late 1958. 
General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh has reportedly reversed his 
previous opposition to the maintenance of an underground 
apparatus and has-given his approval to the formation of 
a standby mechanism for armed action if such a course 
should become necessary. Ghosh's switch followed his 
return from Moscow on a three-months' sojourn owing ta 
"ill health." 
Overtly, this shift to the left is most apparent 
in the party's attitudes toward Nehru, Indian foreign 
policy, and relations between Kerala and the Central 
Government. During recent years the CPI has refrained 
from personal attacks on the Prime Minister on the grounds 
that he is "progressive" and must be supported against the 
"forces of right reaction" within the Congress Party organ-
ization. This stand was reiterated at the Amritsar congress, 
but in August the CPI Central Executive Committee adopted 
a strong resolution denouncing the Prime Minister's 
critical comments on developments in Kerala. The resolu-
tion objected to Nehru's "partisan stand," his "scant 
regard for the truth," and his "sweeping charges and 
insinuations." Communist disenchantment with the Prime 
Minister increased following Nehru's critical comments 
on the regimentation of life in Communist Chiha and 
publication of his critical observations on international 
communism in an August issue of the Congress Party 
publication Economic Review. 
Previous CPI ariticism of Indian foreign policy 
was limited basically to India's membership in the British 
Commonwealth and the Central 
CRITICISM OF US AID Government's refusal to use force 
to end Portuguese possession of 
Goa. In a resolution adopted 
in October, the CPI National Council gave passing approval 
to the Prime Minister's stand on the Taiwan straits 
situation but was notably silent on other facets of GOI 
foreign policy. The CPI and the communist-line press 
have launched a concerted attack against acceptance of 
U.S. economic aid,which, they claim, is given with strings 
SECRET/NOFORN

attached and thus compromises India's foreign policy of 
non-alignment. In early October the party's Central 
Executive Committee criticized the GOI for not seeking 
additional aid from "socialist countries" where the 
"question of strings does not arise," and later the same 
month the CPI National Council warned against "the dangers 
to our foreign policy inherent in increasing economic 
dependence on imperialism." The actual motivation behind 
this strong stand against US assistance is probably two-
fold: this aid increases India's ties with the West, and 
it makes more likely the completion of a major portion of 
the five-year plan, thereby removing one of the Communists' 
major sources of criticism of the GOI. 
The Communist Government of Kerala -- the CPI's 
prime showpiece in India -- also encountered difficulty 
during 1958, and the lesson was 
brought home to the Communists 
COMMUNISTS' SHOWPIECE that ruling a state is far more 
difficult than irresponsible 
criticism as an opposition party. 
The CPI continued in Kerala its five-pronged attack 
designed to (1) infiltrate and tighten control over the 
governmental servi,Ces, including the police; (2) con-
solidate the party's position among teachers and mold 
the school curriculum toward the Communists' way of 
thinking; (3) strengthen "people's committees" as a 
potential parallel government apparatus controlled by 
the Communists at the local level; (4) enhance the party's 
prestige by publicizing Kerala's accomplishments within 
the state and throughout India; and (5) strengthen the 
Kerala branch of the CPI organizationally and financially 
through its present hold on the government structure. 
Under the communist-controlled government in 
Kerala, CPI members and party sympathizers have been 
installed in strategic positions in the state civil 
service and police force. "Advisory boards" and various 
types of committees have been formed, including many 
party supporters as members, to advise and guide the 
government in virtually all fields. Textbooks have been 
rewritten, and control over the state educational system 
has been tightened. Concessinns and benefits have been 
granted to depressed classes and castes in an attempt 
to consolidate the party's hold on these groups. In 
May 1958, the CPI demonstrated its organizational ability 
in one area by retaining its assembly seat in the first 
KERALA -- THE 
SECRET/NOFORN 
? 
SECRET/NOFORN 74 
by-election in Kerala since the Communists assumed office. 
Compared with their performance in the same constituency 
in the 1957 general elections, both the eommunists and 
the Congress Party gained at the expefte of minor parties 
and Independents, but the gains registered by the Congress 
were proportionally slightly greater. 
Set off against the Kerala Government's accomplish-
ments were certain difficulties encountered by the com-
munist regime which caused some party members to have 
second thoughts on the advisability of attempting to rule 
one Indian state while another party controls the strong 
Central Government. The Government of India, after 
following an indecisive policy toward Kerala for nearly 
a year, has apparently become aware of the danger which 
Kerala poses for the future stability of India and has 
begun to put pressure on the Kerala ministry. Three key 
bills formulated by the ministry and forwarded to the GOI 
were returned to the state government for clarification 
or alteration, and Prime Minister Nehru has publicly 
pointed to the "sense of insecurity" which exists among 
the people of the state. During November conditions in 
the state were the subject of heated debate in Parliament, 
and Kerala Chief Minister Namboodiripad's earlier charge 
that some members of Parliament had "slandered" his 
government was referred to a parliamentary committee to 
determine whether he should be held in contempt of the 
House for this allegation. 
In addition, the Kerala Communists have encountered 
difficulty over their inability appreciably to raise the 
basic economic level, and indications of popular im-
patience over the program made to date have grown in some 
quarters. In June and July a minor dispute between 
students and the state government over ferry rates was 
parlayed by the present opposition parties .Into a major 
agitation resulting in violence between students and the 
police. Later the same month, police were provoked into 
firing on a mob of workers near the city of Quilon in the 
first such attack on workers since the Communists assumed 
power. In October, police fired on striking tea plantation 
workers in another part of the state. This was a major 
setback for the present government in view of the Com-
munists' previous strong stand against sucloaction in 
Congress-controlled states and the fact that firing on 
workers was a major reason for the downfall of a Praja 
Socialist government in Kerala in 1955.

This violence, involving laborers and students, 
two of the Communists' major target groups, embarrassed 
the CPI, and several party leaders publicly suggested 
the Kerala Government should retire from office. However, 
the party has apparently decided not to resign at present, 
since to do so would encourage the impression that the 
0.ommunists are unable to govern effectively. The Kerala 
committee of the CPI expressed the opinion in early 
November that "we cannot throw away the right to rule 
the state" in view of the "present national and inter-
national importance" of this experiment with parlia-
mentary methods. Meanwhile, Kerala party leaders have 
stepped up their charges of discrimination and obstruction-
ism by the central government and irresponsible actions 
by the opposition parties in the state in an attempt to 
shift the blame for the ministry's difficulties. 
Despite these setbacks which the Government of 
Kerala h'as suffered, the opposition parties in the state 
are not sufficiently strong to defeat and replace the 
present ministry. The Congress, "Praja Socialists and 
Muslim Lgague have failed to unite and consolidate their 
efforts d'gainst the 6ommunists, and each of these parties 
suffers itself from internal factionalism. The CPI 
probably retains the base df its support in Kerala, and 
its infiltration of government services and consolidation 
of the party machine at the local level will make for 
continuing instability in the state even if the present 
ministry falls from power or voluntarily retires as a 
tactical move. The most serious results of recent 
developments in Kerala, from theaommunists' standpoint, 
are probably the impact which developments there may have 
had on potential party recruits in,other states and the 
intensification of internal CPI frictions which Kerala 
has produced.

the party's overt subscription to democratic methods

ASSESSMENT AND date, by year's end the CPI 
OUTLOOK had retreated once again toward 
the left. Its ultimate course 
remains uncertain. It hinges to 
a certain extent on developments beyond the party's 
control, e.g., the domestic and international policies 
followed by Nehru and the Government of India and the 
guidance which party leaders received from Moscow. It 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 76 
is likely, however, that the CPI's pragmatic approach, 
intra-party pressures, developments within India, and 
the influence of the Moscow example will induce the CPI 
to continue its present trend toward a somewhat more 
doctrinaire attitude. It will probably draw back 
slightly from its reliance on parliamentary means and 
concentrate to a greater extent on the covert organiza-
tions and activities traditionally associated with a 
communist party. 
On balance the CPI gained during 1958, and despite 
the ideological difficulties which the party faces it 
remains a serious threat to the future stability of India. 
On the liability side, the CPI failed during the year to 
groom Kerala into a showpiece which would unmistakably 
enhance the party's prestige throughout India; it failed 
to heal the breach within the party and, in fact, oc-
casional contradictory statements by CPI leaders called 
public attention to continuing factionalism; and the 
party's support (though somewhat delayed) for the 
execution of former Hungarian Premier Imre Nagy and the 
Soviet crackdown on Yugoslavia reflected the fact that 
the CPI, despite its claims to the contrary, is not a 
purely indigenous force. 
On the other hand, ideological confusion and 
factionalism within Indian political parties are not 
confined to the C6mmunists; virtually all parties suffer 
from these defects, and the ability of the democratic 
opposition to compete against the Communists is cor-
respondingly reduced. The CPI continues to grow at a 
more rapid rate than any other all-Indian political 
party. CPI officials claimed a party membership of 
218,532 in February 1958, and this figure is believed 
to be reliable. Membership is estimated to have reached 
250,000 by the end of the year. This doubling of party 
membership since the 1957 elections, when the CPI was 
estimated to have 125,000 members, was achieved in part 
through a relaxation in membership requirements and a 
concerted drive to enroll new members prior to the 
Amritsar party congress, and in part through expansion 
of party activities among new groups. But even this 
expanded figure does not accurately reflect potential 
party strength, since the CPI polled nearly 12,000,000 
votes in 1957.

During 1958. the CPI made gains in local elections 
in Bombay State and Bihar and maintained its strength in 
district boards and in village and municipal councils in 
parts of West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. The 
party continued to make its most striking gains among 
labor, particularly in the basic industries being 
established in eastern India, the defense industries 
centered around Bangalore in Mysore State, and the tea 
and coffee plantations in Kerala and Assam. In mid-1958 
the communist-controlled All-India Trade Union Congress 
(AITUC) claimed a membership of 1,455,488 -- a figure . 
which would make AITUC the largest labor federation in 
India. This membership claim is undoubtedly exaggerated, 
but it is nonetheless true that AITUC is the most dynamic 
labor federation in India and continues to grow in 
relation to the federations controlled by other political 
parties. 
Similarly, the communist-controlled Kisan Sabha 
(Peasants' Association, with 600,000 members, continues 
to be the largest and most effective peasant organization 
in India. The party has taken steps to increase its 
support among the peasantry and, of particular importance, 
has made inroads at the expense of the Congress Party 
among the rural population of West Bengal. These gains 
are particularly notable in view of the fact that West 
Bengal is one of the Communists' prime targets for the 
1962 elections. 
The CPI has a potential for becoming the only ef-
fective alternative to the present ruling party. This 
potential is increased by the apathy and lack of political 
realism so common among the Indian people. Many Indians 
continue to believe Indian Communists are basically so 
different from their brethren in Moscow and Peiping that 
the force of Indian traditions will make them non-violent 
and tractable. Even among these who are strongly anti-
communist, many believe that the inherent individuality 
and religiousness of the villager will deter the spread 
of communism in India. To this extent, at least, the 
Indian Communists have made progress in their attempt to 
Ave down their unsavory past and achieve respectability.

VI. SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THE FAR EAST 
INTRODUCTION 
A review of communist activities in 1958 in the 
noncommunist countries of the Far East reveals consider-
able diversity and little evidence of overall control 
from Communist China or the U.S.S.R. The Chinese Com-
munist regime, through its presence, influence, and in 
many cases direct pressure, colored the responses of 
all the noncommunist governments of the region, but seems 
to have had only indirect influence on the communist 
movements themselves (except in the special cases of 
Hongkong and Macau where the communist movement is merely 
an extengion of the Chinese Communist Party). The movements 
attempted with varying success to adapt themselves to 
Peiping and Moscow inspired orthodoxy, making little 
distinction between the two and in fact varying widely 
among themselves in organization, activities, and 
ideology. The official communist line for the region 
could be said to be "peaceful struggle" and "united 
front," but many of the communist movements remained in 
a state of insurrection against the government or existed 
purely in covert illegal capacities. Nor did those com-
munist movements that were engaged in "peaceful" pursuits 
feel compelled to adapt their tactics to the violence and 
bluster emanating from Peiping in conjunction with its 
belligerent foreign policy. The Chinese Communist regime 
gave guidance through its ever-present example, but 
generally avoided direct interference in indigenous 
communist activities, preferring to focus its attention 
on the governments of the countries concerned, whether 
neutralist or anticommunist. In fact, the Lao oOmmunist 
movement appears to be more closely controlled from 
North Vietnam than is any other Far Eastern communist 
movement from either Peiping or Moscow. Nevertheless, 
Peiping's increasing range of activities in Asia, high-
lighted during the year by the establishment of diplomatic 
relations with Cambodia and substantial offers and grants 
of aid to Indonesia, created additional channels for 
possible covert aid to communist and other left-wing 
movements. 
The communist movements of the Far East encompass 
the full range of communist activity from covert

intelligence operations through open rebellion to legal 
participation in parliamentary democracy. Most countries 
boast several categories of communist activity, notably 
Burma which has two insurrectionary movements, one semi-
overt party recently legalized and one grouping of legal 
parliamentary parties, and both a clandestine communist 
and a number of overt communist organizations among 
overseas Chinese. 
There are communist insurgent movements in Malaya, 
the Philippines, and Burma. The insurgent movements 
vary in orthodoxy and discipline, with that of the 
Philippines perhaps making the greatest effort to 
maintain a consistent ideological position. In Burma, 
the "Red Flag" insurgents are termed Trotskyists by the 
"White Flag" insurgents whose orthodoxy also leaves 
much to be desired from a strictly doctrinal viewpoint. 
The Malayan tommunist rebels are handicapped by their 
jungle j,solation and lack of interest in current ideo-
logical discussions, but occasional manifestos are 
sufficiently orthodo4 to be rebroadcast by the Peiping 
radio. None of the insurgent movements in these 
countries is significant in numbers, ranging from several 
hundred for the Philippine "Huks" to approximately a 
thousand for the Malayan and several thousand for the 
Burmese insurgent groups. The Burmese and Malayan move-
ments, however, continue to represent serious security 
problems. Although the insurgents have varying local 
support in the areas where they operate, all are attempting 
to make a transition to legal political activity, having 
failed to gain victory in jungle warfare. 
A second category of communist activity includes 
the wide range of clandestine political movements which 
are operating in Burma, the Philippines, and Malaya in 
varying degrees of coordination with the insurgent 
movement, and are active also in Thailand, South Vietnam, 
and Singapore. Covert communist operations in South 
Korea and Nationalist China have virtually no political 
content .and are presumably limited to intelligence 
functions. Limited communist intelligence or sabotage 
capabilities are of some importance in South Vietnam, 
but the covert and clandestine movements in Thailand 
and the Philippines are of themselves of limited 
significance. In Malaya and Singapore communist 
activities have been pursued with increasing effective-
ness through various not strictly communist left-wing 
front and trade union organizations and newspapers, and 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 80 
are presumably coordinated by a covert communist organ-
ization. 
A third category of communist movement encompasses 
the various legal communist parties, among which the 
Indonesian is outstanding, with its achievement of a 
degree of political power and influence unmatched by 
any other free-world communist party. The Indonesian 
Communist Party (PKI) was able to poll over seven million 
votes in regional elections in 1957. During 1958 it 
further extended its influence, although it aroused 
strong opposition from regional insurYent leaders and 
more recently from some elements in the army. In Burma, 
the Communists operate in the political arena through 
the National United Front (NUF), which commands consider-
able electoral strength and was put into a potential 
balance-of-power position by the split in the ruling 
coalition, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League 
(AFPFL). However, the assumption of the premiership 
by Ne Win has probably resulted in a set-back for com-
munist political prospects in Burma. (It is noteworthy 
that-Peiping, apparently more concerned with its relations 
with the government of Burma than with the communist move-
ment, tendered its congratulations to Ne Win at the same 
time that he was attacked by the NUF as a usurper.) In 
Laos, the previously insurrectionary Pathet Lao movement 
succeeded in making a transition to ovett political 
activity through implementation of the accords of 
November 18, 1957, assuming the name of Neo Lao Hab Xat 
and commanding a strategic position against the less 
well-organized and formerly badly divided noncommunist 
political groupings. The significance of legal communist 
political movements in other areas of the Far East was 
minor during 1958. The Japanese Communists, beset by 
factionalism, have lost electoral support and are not an 
important parliamentary grouping. However, in Japan, 
communist-controlled front groups and, more importantly, 
communist-infiltrated trade unions continue to wield 
influence and are probably the most significant expression 
of communist activity. In Australia, the Communists 
s,milarly have a minimal electoral following but control 
some important trade unions. Legal communist political 
activity is almost altogether lacking in Cambodia and 
New Zealand, although the former country's recent 
recognition of Communist China and acceptance of Bloc 
economic aid have increased its vulnerability to subversion.

For completeness, a fourth category of communist 
organization should be mentioned. In the countries 
possessing Chinese minorities there are covert Chinese 
Communist organizations; in Thailand and Cambodia there 
are-in addition clandestine communist organizations 
among the Vietnamese minority. Overt manifestations of 
communist activity among these minorities include the 
uswfl array of front organizations, with pro-Peiping 
Chinese schools and newspapers particularly significant 
as-opinion moulders. Although the majority of overseas 
Chinese in the Far East are by temperament cautious and 
apolitical, they have ties of family, language, and 
tradition with the Chinese mainland and thus are 
pOtontially more susceptible to infiltration and sub-
verdion than the bulk of the indigenous population. 
During 1958, however, no noteworthy advances took place 
in communist efforts to gain influence among the Chinese 
minority, largely because Peiping (like Taipei) found 
itself in a tactibally weak situation for aiding the 
overseas Chinese in grievances against the host govern-
ments. 
Despite the diversity of Asian communist movements, 
a few broad trends appeared to be in evidence in 1958. 
Several of the overt political movements, as in Laos 
and Burma, attributing the communist victory in China, 
with-Doestionable historical accuracy, to a "united 
front" tactic, and specifically inspired by the example 
of the Indonesian party, attempted to maneuver themselves 
into a position of influence between competing noncommunist 
factions. At the same time, the insurgent movements, 
having continued to suffer military reverses, pursued 
their efforts to emerge legally into the political arena 
without the crippling conditions that the governments 
concerned sought to impose. However, where communist 
or left-wing influence seemed to be increasing markedly, 
new vigor frequently appeared in anticommunist circles, 
sparked in several cases by military leadership. The 
result appeared to be a situation in which left-wing, 
communist and front organizations could exploit numerous 
issues, but have often run into anticommunist opposition 
when concrete gains seemed to be in the offing.

INDONESIA 
The Indonesian Communist Party (Partai Komunis 
Indonesia -- PKI) successfully exploited the turbulent 
events of late 1957 and early 1958 to become Indonesia's 
largest and most effective political party. Limited 
organizational changes were undertaken by the PKI, 
following the VIth Plenary Session of the Central Com-
mittee in April 1958, and emphasis throughout the year 
was laid on consolidation of earlier gains. There was 
evidence that elements in the government and the army 
were becoming increasingly alarmed at PKI activities, 
and several measures aimed at restricting a further 
growth of communist strength were undertaken. The PKI, 
while noting that there were both "positive" and 
negative" aspects to the growirig role Of the military 
in Indonesian political life, followed a "respectable" 
line of full support for President Sukarno, accompanied 
by generalized but more selective support for the cabinet 
and the political program of the army. 
In late 1957, Dutch-owned property in Indonesia 
was seized by communist-led or communist-inspired groups 
of workers, following which the 
SEIZURE OF THE Indonesian Government itself 
DUTCH PROPERTIES took over the property and has 
AND THE REBELLION administered it since. At the 
same time, a combination of 
threats and urgings led most of 
the 50,000 Dutch nationals resident in Indonesia in 
December 1957 to leave the country during the first 
half of 1958. This enabled the PKI to further its goal 
of destroying traditional ties with the West and 
establishing state ownership and control while assuming 
a nationalistic pose for the Indonesianization of the 
economy. 
The PKI also sought to increase its voice in the 
management of the Dutch properties in Indonesia. Through 
the PKI-controlled labor federation, All-Indonesia Labor 
Organizations (SOBSI), the largest and most effective 
labor organization in Indonesia, the Communists generally 
cooperated with the new managers of the factories, 
estates, and other enterprises now under government 
control to increase production. Labor agitation was held 
to a minimum both because it was still in the interest 
of the PKI to appear to be helpful and because the

Indonesian army could be expected to act to prevent any 
large-scale strike activity. 
In February 1958, a rebel government was proclaimed 
in Sumatra, claiming jurisdiction over the whole of 
Indonesia. The decision by the government to suppress 
the rebellion by force was strongly supported by the 
PKI, both in its self-proclaimed role as the most "patri-
otic" of parties and because its arch-rivals, the Muslim 
Masjumi Party and the Indoresian Socialist Party, were 
heavily involved in support of the rebel government. 
Support for the suppression of the rebellion from the 
point of view of the PKI constituted a heavy blow against 
its strongest opponents and an enhancement in the position 
of the PKI as a respectable nationalistrparty. 
With the military defeat of the rebellion in 
Sumatra in May and in Celebes in late June, the rebels 
were reduced to guerrilla activity. Although they still 
exercise effective control over considerable areas of 
the country, they are in no position to exercise any sub-
stantial influence in the central government. In the 
political sphere, the Masjumi and the Indonesian Socialist 
Party suffered a reduction in strength as a result of 
their involvement with the rebellion; the Indonesian 
Nationalist Party has been rent with factionalism; and 
the Muslim Teachers Party has been unable to provide 
national leadership. President Sukarno, the army, and 
the PKI have thus been left as the major political 
forces in Indonesia. 
The growth in strength of the PKI as a result of 
the events of 1957 and 1958 occasioned some counter-
measures, particularly by the 
PRESSURE ON THE PKI army. While President Sukarno 
appeared to be reluctant to 
speak out against the Communists, 
the army began to take a much more noticeable anti-
communist stance, particularly beginning in the spring 
of 1958, and has undertaken a limited program to reduce 
communist influence in Indonesia. In May and in July, 
the .ar*:prdhibited the PKI from holding mass rallies 
to protest alleged U.S. support of the rebels and U.S.-
U.K. intervention in Lebanon and Jordan. In June, the 
cabinet was reshuffled and the ministry headed by A.M. 
Hanafi, reportedly a secret Communist, was abolished, 
due to pressures brought to bear by the army and the 
SECRET/NOFORN 
1 
;1 
SECRET/NOFORN 84 
noncommunist political parties (although,through the 
intervention of President Sukarno, Hanafi was retained 
in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio). In 
September Prime Minister Djuanda announced in Parliament 
that the next general elections, scheduled for September 
1959, would be postponed for a maximum of one year, 
due to continuing difficulties in inter-island com-
munications and to persisteht insecurity in wide areas 
of the country. However, it was widely believed that 
this step, which had been advocated by the army and 
the noncommunist political parties, had been decided 
on because of the general view that the PKI was likely 
to emerge with a large plurality of the vote in 1959, 
if the elections had been held on schedule. There seems 
little question that President Sukarno must. have at 
least acquiesced in the decision, which in effect sought 
to curb a further growth in PKI strength. 
At the VIth Plenary Session of the Central Com-
mittee of the PKI, held in Djakarta in April, the 
Secretary General of the Party, 
ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES D.N.Aidit, presented a long 
AND POLICY LINES report which was a blend of 
prideful admission of progress 
achieved by the PKI, together 
with proposals for organizational and administrative 
changes in the Party. Reviewing the regic5nal elections 
of 1957, Aidit claimed that the PKI had moved up from 
the fourth largest to the largest political party in 
Indonesia. He noted a substantial increase in the 
membership of the PKI and called for more energetic 
action on the part of the PKI leadership to maintain 
the broadest possible contact with the mass of party 
membership and with potential party members. He urged 
that 1958 and 1959 be years of "consolidation" of all 
levels of the PKI. 
Limited organizational changes were approved at 
the VIth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, 
involving the appointment of a sixth member to the 
Politburo, the raising of all previous candidate members 
of the Central Committee to full membership, and re-
placement of a Central Committee member who had died. 
In addition, a Daily Council of the Politburo was 
created, consisting of Aidit, the Secretary General; 
Lukman and Njoto, the deputy Secretaries General; and 
Sudisman, an ordinary member of the Politburo. The task

SECRET/NOFORN 
of the Daily Council, which will devolve, in practice, 
on Sudisman, will be to provide support to the Politburo 
itself and relieve the pressure on the Secretariat of 
the Central Committee. To cope with the growth in size 
of the PKI in the last several years, creation of a new 
layer of PKI organizations was approved, providing for 
"Island Committees" and"Archipelago Bureaux" to supervise 
the work of PKI committees at the provincial level. 
These organizational changes will probably be reflected 
in amendments to the PKI constitution which will be con-
sidered at the VIth National Congress of the PKI, tenta-
tively scheduled for the middle of 1959. 
At the VIIth Plenary Session of the Central Com-
mittee, held in November 1958, Aidit presented a broad 
review of the international and domestic situation. This 
session of the Central Committee was largely devoted to 
the preparations for the VIth National Party Congress. 
In his report to the Untral Committee Aidit announced 
full support for President Sukarno and his program of 
"guided democracy," for the Djuanda cabinet, and for the 
Indonesian claim to West New Guinea. He spoke in cautious 
terms of the Indonesian army, which has taken over 
authority in civilian as well as military fields under 
the prevailing martial regulations. He noted that the 
participation of the army had positive aspects, in the 
sense that the army had undertaken energetic action to 
suppress the rebellion declared in February 1959. How-
ever, he added that it had negative aspects in the sense 
of prohibitions on the holding of public meetings, 
prohibitions on strikes, and other restrictions on the 
"democratic and progressive movement." The PKI, he said, 
would do all it could to prevent a "sharpening of contra-
dictions" between the army and the "people." 
Of greater interest, perhaps, was the presentation 
of "Draft Theses" to be considered throughout the PKI in 
preparation for the VIth National Party Congress. The 
draft noted that, although the Indonesian People have 
achieved substantial progress in the struggle for freedom 
and democracy, "Dutch imperialism is still the primary 
enemy of the Indonesian People." Remnants of feudalism 
in the form of landlordism are still found in the 
villages, and Indonesia remains a semi-feudal state. At 
the same time "intervention of American imperialists" and 
the foreign investment law, approved by Parliament in 
SECRET/NOFORN 
? 
SECRET/NOFORN 86 
October, were obstacles to the completion of national 
liberation. To deal with the existing situation, the 
theses propose to the Indonesian government: 1) to 
increase production by turning Dutch-owned enterprises 
into Indonesian government property; 2) to take over 
the import and export of important commodities and thus 
to lessen the influence of foreign captialists; 3) to 
redirect foreign commerce so that Indonesian industry 
can process Indonesian raw materials and so that the 
foreign exchange derived from exports of petroleum may 
be made available to the government; and 4) to attempt 
to obtain further foreign loans "without political or 
military strings" for domestic development purposes. 
The draft theses closed with an admonition to strengthen 
the "national unity front" and to "strengthen, broaden, 
and renew" the life of the party. They were approved by 
the VIth Plenary Session of the Central Committee on 
November 21. 
By the end of 1958, the PKI was actively engaged 
in consolidating the gains of the last two years and 
seeking to improve its organ-
PKI PLANS FOR THE izational effectiveness. To 
FUTURE protect itself against the 
possibility of the army's taking 
large-scale action against it, 
the PKI followed a soft and cautious line in public state-
ments on the army and sought to remain under Sukarno's 
protective wing. Meanwhile, with the support of the aid 
and trade offensive of the Soviet Bloc, it was seeking 
to exploit the deteriorating economic situation within 
Indonesia to increase its present membership of about 
1,400,000 members and to expand its voting support in 
anticipation of a new round of elections. The party thus 
remained committed to the legal struggle and will probably 
continue to be so committed until the development of the 
situation should bring it close to power or, alteYnatiVely,

THE FEDERATION OF MALAYA AND SINGAPORE 
The Malayan government during the past year has 
undertaken a number of strong measures directed against 
manifestations of communist subversion in labor unions 
and among school students, as well as communist efforts 
to expand their influence through trade and propaganda

activities. The government's counter-offensive under-
scored the changing pattern of communist activities 
in Malaya from emphasis on the armed insurrection of 
the Malayan Races Liberation Army (MRLA) to less 
obvious and more dangerous efforts at penetration of 
civilian groups. This year, which was the eleventh 
year of the communist guerrilla war against the govern-
ment (known as the Emergency), saw the ranks of the 
MRLA reduced to about 1,000. In the wake of major 
military and police operations in the states of Johore 
and along the Thai border, the armed activity of the 
guerrillas was changing from a major security problem to 
more of an annoyance to the population still living in 
so-called "black areas" under the onerous Emergency 
Regulations and an unwelcome economic burden to the 
government. 
A combination of relentless pressure from Common-
wealth and Malayan armed forces, a system of rewards for 
information leading to terrorist 
STATUS OF THE hideouts, and the internal 
EMERGENCY weaknesses of the MRLA itself 
have led to major losses in com-
munist armed strength, which has 
been reduced almost 50 percent since Malaya gained its 
independence in August 1957. In August 1958, the govern-
ment announced that during the first ten years of the 
Emergency the losses of the Malayan Commupist Party (MCP) 
totaled 6,500 guerrillas killed, 2,800 wounded, 2,100 
surrendered and 1,200 captured. The two most spectacular 
recent achievements were the surrender of 118 guerrillas 
in South Perak and the elimination of 183 terrorists in 
South Johore of whom 160 surrendered. These large-scale 
surrenders included some of the top MCP officials, such 
as Hor Lung, head of the MCP's South Malayan Bureau, as 
well as a regional secretary, eight regional committee 
members, and lesser MCP officials. 
More than half of the remaining 1,000 guerrillas 
are concentrated along the northern border and in Thailand 
where Chin Peng, MCP Secretary General, has his head-
quarters. It was in an effort to curtail communist 
operations in this area that the Malayan Defense Minister 
went to Bangkok in February. The subsequent agreement 
with the Thai permitted somewhat greater freedom of 
action in the border area to the Commonwealth and 
Malayan forces, but nothing comparable to the degree 
of pressure which enabled them to be so successful in 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 88 
rounding up the Communists on the Malayan side. Because 
of the nature of the jungle terrain, total elimination 
of the elusive communist bands probably cannot be 
achieved without closer cooperation on the Thai side 
of the border. 
In August, the Emergency Regulations, under which 
the campaign against the guerrillas has been prosecuted, 
were extended for another year without a dissenting vote 
in the Federation's Legislative Council. Nevertheless, 
these Regulations, which permit extensive curtailment of 
civil rights, are not popular, and their continuation 
undoubtedly will be exploited by the government's 
political opposition in the 1959 general elections. Op-
position parties generally favor coming to terms with 
the MCP, granting it legal recognition, and at the same 
time paving the way for abrogating the Malaya-U.K. Defense 
Agreement under which Commonwealth troops are stationed 
in the Federation. Chin- Peng doubtless recognizes these 
pressures on the government and probably is awaiting the 
outcome of the elections before deciding upon his next 
move. At least he has made no further offers to negotiate 
with the government since the end of 1957 and the new MCP 
manifesto (see below) gave no hint of a unilateral 
surrender at this time. 
The latest MCP manifesto, issued on the tenth 
anniversary of the beginning of the Emergency, calls upon 
the people to "uphold their 
MCP POLICY UNCHANGED glorious tradition by continuing 
? their vigorous support to the 
Liberation Army" and admonishes 
the latter to "be more united than ever, and persist in 
the struggle so that the military and political offensives 
of the Alliance Government shall suffer ignominious 
defeat...." The remainder of the document represents a 
time-worn recapitulation of the theme that Malaya.is not 
truly independent since foreign influence remains strong. 
It contains a long list of grievances against the Al-
liance government covering most of the current political, 
economic and social problems of the day. It also renews 
the demand for a national consultative conference, which 
would include MCP representatives, to lay down new 
policies for achieving national unity. 
Although Radio Peiping endorsed the manifesto, 
the MCP's relations with international communism a)ntinue 
to be remote. Chinese Communist influence in Malaya is

being exerted increasingly through economic channels, 
such as purchases of Malayan rubber and sales of low 
cost consumer goods to the Malayan market. Efforts to 
thwart this offensive, jointly undertaken by the Federa-
tion and Singapore governments, have included licensing 
of cement and cotton textiles from mainland China. These 
restrictions were followed by the Federation's announce-
ment late in the year of amendments to its banking laws 
which would make it virtually impossible for the communist-
controlled Bank of China's two branches in the Federation 
to continue in operation, and led in November to threats 
from Peiping of a trade embargo against the peninsula. 
Communist China's efforts at economic intimidation 
as well as the Soviet Union's earlier actions in sabo-
taging the operations of the International Tin Council 
seemingly were taken without regard for the domestic 
problems of the MCP itself. The estimated 5,000 MCP 
members are at least 90 percent Chinese. The rest of the 
estimated 50,000 subversives (a figure mentioned recently 
by the Prime Minister but not susceptible of close defi-
nition) in the Federation are also overwhelmingly Chinese. 
Party members and their sympathizers depend in major part 
upon the large Chinese community as their mass base of 
support, for they have made little headway among the 
Malays or the Indians. Yet those affected most adversely 
by Bloc economic subversion are also largely Chinese --
the tin miners, the importers and the booksellers. This 
is equally true for Singapore, where about 80 percent of 
the population is Chinese. 
Hampered by the continuing guerrilla war, Bloc 
economic manipulations, and by alert .government counter-
measures, the MCP's subversive 
SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES efforts in the fields of politics, 
AND GOVERNMENT student groups and labor were 
COUNTER-MEASURES relatively subdued during the 
year. Organizational efforts, 
expanding "study groups," and 
propaganda exploitation continued, but there was a notable 
absence of violent outbreaks which had marked recent 
years. The government used a combination of precautionary 
measures, judicious concessions and the example of stern 
discipline (including jail sentences, expulsion from 
school, etc.) of last year's demonstrators to head off 
further major student demonstrations. The major anti-
subversive sweep of the year occurred in October when 
SECRET/NOFORN 
90 
about 100 persons were arrested in the Federation; 
included were some members of the left-wing Labour Party 
as well as a number of students. Thirty-four of the 
latter were released shortly to enable them to take 
their examinations. At the same time (October), the 
government banned the Socialist Youth League, a 
successor to the communist-controlled Selangor Students 
Union which had been banned in 1955. 
Another significant trend among school-age Chinese 
was the decline in the number going to Communist China 
for further study. While precis d data are not available 
(there is no method of checking, for example, on those 
who go to the mainland from third countries), the trend 
is discernible from official figures which state that in 
the first seven months of 1958, about 67 students went 
froill the Federation in contrast to 511 and 297 for 
contarable periods in 1957 and 1956, respectively. Il-
lustrative of a parallel trend in Sihgapore was the 
November saifling of the liner Tjiwangi for Communist 
China for the first time in years without a single 
Singapore student abbard. Whereas Singapore's Chief 
Minister was reported considering a more lenient policy 
toward allowing disillusioned students to return from 
the mainland, the Federation continued to bar re-entry 
except for those who could prove they were citizens. 
Other than the large and strong National Union 
of Plantation Workers (NUPW), organized labor in the 
Federation remained fragmented and poorly led -- a 
situation inviting communist penetration. There were, 
however, no major labor outbreaks, probably attributable 
in part to the economic recession. The prolonged dispute 
between the NUPW and management over a new wage formula 
was conducted without strike activity. The volume of 
manhours lost through strikes declined drastically in 
both Singapore and the Federation during the first eight 
months of the year as compared with a similar period in 
1957. The Federation Government retained powerful 
controls over labor subversion through its ability to 
withhold registration of new unions or cancel old 
registrations. Outstanding in the latter category was 
the banning of the strong, communist-infiltrated National 
Union of Factory and General Workers in April and the 
subsequent arrest of its leader, V. David. The influ-
ential Malayan Trade Union Congress protested the 
government action vigorously, and while the union was

not reinstated, David was released after 56 days 
detention. He promptly undertook to evade the govern-
ment's admonitions by reorganizing his union under a 
new name. 
The left-wing Peoples Action Party (PAP) 
continued to make progress in its drive to take over 
the Singapore Trade Union Congress (STUC), the colony's 
principal union federation. The STUC annual delegates 
conference in March was attended by only 32 of 51 af-
filiated unions. Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock, who had 
once played a key role in STUC affairs, seemingly was 
preoccupied with his official role and his efforts to 
reorganize a moderate political coalition. Meanwhile, 
the PAP has been infiltrating its best unionists into 
positions on STUC permanent committees and was also 
making gains in its effort to win over unions supporting 
David' Marshall's left-wing Workers Party. The close 
connection between organized labor and the political 
parties in Singapore at the year's end appeared to be 
working in favor of tile PAP which has shown a greater 
aptitude for grassroots organization than have the 
moderate groups. Meanwhile procommunist elements within 
the PAP have confined themselves to organizational af-
fairs on the branch level of the party and among students 
and labor groups. They probably consider that efforts 
to influence party policy at this time are premature 
since, if the PAP wins the 1959 general elections, their 
chances for taking over control of the party would be 
greatly enhanced. In practical political terms, the 
communists' best chance for achieving legal power lies 
in riding on PAP coat-tails. 
The influx of communist propaganda from abroad 
as well as its local production, again largely Chinese 
in origin, continued despite government counter-measures 
In October, the Singapore government prohibited importa-
tion of the output of 53 publishing houses in Communist 
China and Hong Kong and also banned seven local 
"mosquito" papers. At about the same time, the Federa-
tion banned two Chinese newspapers and prohibited the 
publication of news from the China News Service (in 
early 1957 the Federation had issued a ban on imported 
literature similar to that recently taken by Singapore). 
Stringent though these measures appeared, they are un-
likely to be sufficient to cope with the propagandists, 
both paid and - volunteer: Legislation 
has not halted the dissemination of mimeographed 
SECRET/NOFORN 
4 
SECRET/NOFORN 92 
communist tracts nor changed the pro-mainland orienta-
tion of much of the news presentation in certain Chinese 
publications. Damning the flow of communist propaganda 
into an area with the heaviest proportion of Chinese in 
all Southeast Asia presents a formidable, if not impossible 
task. 
Both the Federation and Singapore extended 'the 
life of their major legislation covering anti-subversion 
activities for another year in acknowledgement of the 
fact that the battle against the local communists is far 
from won. As it has been from the origin of the MCP, 
communism in the Malayan peninsula remains essentially 
a Chinese problem; it can and is being contained at great 
expense by a vigilant anticommunist government but it will 
be a threat to the freedom of the Federation and Singapore 
as long as large concentrations of Chinese remain oriented 
toward the communist-controlled mainlvid. 
The political predominance of the Malays and the 
continued failure of the opposition parties to effect a 
strong working coalition have acted thus far to limit the 
opportunities for effective communist political activity in 
the Federation. However, serious internal schisms within 
the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA), the only legal Chinese 
political party, have further opened the Chinese to left-
wing exploitation. Also, the activities of the Socialist 
Youth League, which had ambitions toward aiding the Labour 
Party and was banned by the government, demonstrated that 
communist infiltration continues, particularly in the 
Chinese community, despite government attempts to curb it. 
Nevertheless, the failure of large numbers of new Chinese 
citizens to register as voters for the 1959 elections serves 
to limit an expansion of Chinese political influence in the 
immediate future. 
Similar barriers to Communist political success are 
not present in Singapore. The left-wing Peoples Action 
Party has a formidable organization as yet unmatched by 
Lim Yew Hock's newly formed coalition, the Singapore 
Peoples Alliance. Early general elections under the new 
constitution could well being the PAP to power. While 
the United Kingdom will retain the ultimate right to 
revoke the constitution, it may choose not to do so. 
Consequently, nowhere in Southeast Asia are the Com-
munists in a better tactical position to seize political 
power within the next few years through ostensibly legal 
means than on this strategic island.

Communist strength remained at a low ebb in 1958. 
Membership in the outlawed Communist Party of the Philip-
pines (CPP) is estimated at about 
CURRENT STATUS AND 1,000, with less than half under 
TACTICS OF THE CPP arms and two to three hundred in 
the Chinese wing of the party. 
The Hukbong Mapacipalava pg 132/An 
(HMB) or People's Army of National Liberation, has been 
reduced to scattered bands hiding in mountainous areas of 
Luzon. Although some communist influence exists in labor, 
tenant farmer, and youth organizations, there is no 
evidence of major subversion. 
During 1958, the CPP continued its efforts to build 
a covert apparatus capable of effectively infiltrating and 
subverting legally sanctioned organizations and institutions. 
"Legal struggle" has constituted the primary tactic of the 
CPP since 1952, when a general retreat from the policy of 
armed rebellion was ordered by the party leadership. The 
shift to non-violent political action with the intermediate 
objective of promoting anti-Americanism and a neutralist 
foreign policy was in accord with the international com-
munist line, and also reflected the success of the govern-
ment's vigorous drive against the communist HMB. 
Present tactics have involved a shift in the field 
of action from the rural to urban areas and a shift of 
emphasis from the peasants of Luxon to the Manila intel-
ligentsia. For political, economic, and various emotional 
reasons many educated Filipinos of the middle and upper 
classes have grown increasingly sensitive in recent years 
to the suggestion that Philippine sovereignty is restricted 
by the close Philippine alliance with the U.S. During 1958 
communist emphasis on a "united front" against the "imperial-
ist policies" of the U.S. has been aimed at these susceptible 
elements of the urban intelligentsia. 
CPP interest in Senator Claro Recto's Nationalist-
Citizens Party is evidence of the current focus of com-
munist attention. Recto, with his program of "filipinism 
versus colonialism," is the champion of Filipino chauvinism, 
deriving national support from professional and other intel-
lectual groups. The Nationalist-Citizens Party constitutes 
a point upon which the CPP can concentrate its efforts to 
infiltrate and influence the filipinist movement and, with 
its aura of patriotism, provides a useful and protective 
_screen for communist activities. 
The intra-party differences that led to the 
expulsion of Luis Taruc from the CPP in 1954 apparently 
persist. Party leaders have continued tp disagree over 
the extent to which the class struggle snould be 
? 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 
94 
abandoned in favor of the struggle for national "liber-
ation." The differences are of degree, however, and 
both sides concur that current emphasis should be placed 
upon a "united anti-imperialist front." The Taruc 
elements have been attacked by the party leadership as 
revisionists" of the Yugoslav variety. 
Inherent difficulties continue to hamper the 
government's legal action against the Communists. In 
1932, the Supreme Court of the 
GOVERNMENT COUNTER- Philippine Islands declared the 
MEASURES Communist Party illegal. This 
ruling was enforced with varying 
vigor by successive Commonwealth 
and Republic governments. In 1956, however, the' Philippine 
Supreme Court refused to recognize the charge of "re-
bellion complexed" under which most CPP and HMB leaders 
had been convicted. The Court ruled that other crimes, 
such as murder, arson, and kidnapping, could not be 
included in the rebellion charge in order to increase 
the maximum penalty of twelve years legally prescribed 
for rebellion. Moreover, as simple rebellion is not 
considered a major crime, the court ruled that communists 
charged with rebellion are eligible for release on bail. 
The government reacted by preparing new cases against 
at least some of the communist leaders, dropping the 
rebellion count and charging them instead with murder 
or other serious but common crimes. Thus, the govern-
ment succeeded in pressing new charges against former 
communist leader Luis Taruc, who in June 1958 was found 
guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. 
Similarly, the government has filed deportation proceedings 
against William Pomeroy, a prominent CPP member who was 
ordered released on bail in September 1958. 
To eliminate loopholes opened by these recent 
court decisions, new legislation was proposed and 
finally signed into law in June 1957 as the Anti-
Subversion Act. The act formally outlaws the CPP and 
its military arm, the HMB, and sets up specific penalties, 
including the death penalty, for communist activities. 
The provisions of the Act are not retroactive; and to 
date their effectiveness remains untested. However, 
Agaton Bulaong and Alfredo Saulo, two communist leaders 
taken in the latter half of 1958, reportedly will be 
prosecuted under the new legislation.

In a number of ways, "legal struggle" offers 
prospects of greater communist success than did former 
armed tactics. As a subtler 
COMMUNIST POTENTIAL form of attack, it is more 
difficult both to detect and 
counteract. Not only does 
the "legal struggle" lie more within the means of the 
CPP, cut off as it is from the direct support of foreign 
communist organizations, but it is aimed directly at 
the center of political power in Manila. Concentration 
on the urban intelligentsia may provide the party with 
a source of abler and more energetic membership than 
the, uneducated peasantry upon which the party formerly 
relied. 
Currently, the Communist Party's greatest potential 
derives from its exploitation of Philippine nationalism. 
Not only does it use the nationalist issue as a direct 
source of strength by posing as a champion of the 
"filipinist" cause, but in exploiting nationalism in 
an effort to exacerbate differences between the U.S. and 
the Philippines, it fosters a climate favorable to expanded 
communist activity. Frictions in U.S.-Philippine rela-
tions can by no means be attributed solely to communist 
influence. Nevertheless, captured documents reveal how 
shrewdly communist leaders evaluate Filipino attitudes 
and the astuteness with which they gear the party line 
to national sensitivities and aspirations. 
(SECRET) 
BURMA 
During the first three quarters of 1958 the 
parliamentary ifluence of the Burmese Communists increased 
to potentially dangerous proportions. This upturn of 
communist political capabilities came about primarily 
as a result of the splitting of the Anti-Fascist People's 
Freedom League (AFPFL) (which had been the political 
organization of the Burmese government leaders since 
the attainment of independence in 1948) into two rival 
factions during the spring of 1958. During late September 
1958, however, the top leadership of the Burma Army under 
General Ne Win assumed control over the government, a 
step which in effect checked the increasing vulnerability 
of the government to communist political pressure. Com-
munist and other insurgent factions throughout the year 
continued their guerrilla resistance to the government's 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 96 
armed forces, although their ranks were thinned 
during , the first three quarters of the year by 
a number of mass surrenders in response to the govern-
ment's liberal surrender terms. With Ne Win's assumption 
of the Premiership, U Nu's policy of increasingly liberal 
terms to the insurgents was reversed, and the government 
in November announced the launching of an attack designed 
to bring the rebellion to an end. However, despite the 
stronger anticommunist tone of the new government in 
internal affairs, there has been no change in Burma's 
neutral foreign policy or in the ostensibly friendly 
diplomatic relations with Communist China. 
The Burmese Communists. remained divided into an 
insurrectionary and a legal pprliamentary wing. Two)to 
thr4 thousand of tile some' 
DOMESTIC POTENTIAL 4,000-5,000 communist insurgents 
OF COMMUNISM belong to the Burma Communist 
Party (BCP), militarily and 
politically the strongest of 
the three communist insurgent groups, which engineered 
the first of the major insurrections in 1948 and has 
consistently claimed to follow the basic principles of 
the international communist line. Approximately 500-1,000 
adhere to a rival Communist Party (Burma) =- CP(B), which 
went underground after its formation in 1946 by defectors 
from the BCP. The CP(B) has frequently deviated from the 
international communist propaganda line by its doctrinaire 
and uncompromising adherence to violent revolutionary 
tactics (in contrast to the amenability of the other 
communist factions to temporary compromises with non-
communist elements). Remnants of a third communist 
faction -- the People's Comrade Party (PCP) -- have been 
operating in loose local military agreements with the 
other two groups, although the leaders surrendered with 
some of their followers during the summer of 1958 and 
were legalized as an above-ground PCP. In addition, 
guerrilla bands of the noncommunist insurgent Karen 
National Defense Organization, :which comprises dissident 
elements of Burma's Karen minority, continued to col-
laborate with communist bands in the delta area of Lower 
Burma. 
The above-ground wing of the communist movement 
comprises the Burma Workers Party (BWP), its allied 
front organizations purporting to represent students, 
peasants, urban laborers, and other key target groups,

and the recently legalized PCP. The BWP, which was 
formed in 1950 by extreme leftists who defected from 
the Socialist Party, has constituted a 'dommunist *party 
in all but name and has apprently followed the inter-
national communist line with a greater degree of 
consistency than any other Burmese communist organization. 
The BWP dominates a National United Front (NUF) parlia-
mentary coalition bloc which includes noncommunist 
elements as well as procommunist splinter parties and 
held 44 of the 250 seats in the lower house of Parlia-
ment as of mid-1958. The most important of the mass 
organizations dominated by the BWP is probably the Rangoon 
University Student Union, owing to the longstanding role 
of Rangoon University as the training-ground for the 
nation's future political leaders and to the fact that 
the franchise may be exercised at the age of 18 in Burma. 
The cleavage of the AFPFL in April -- resulting in 
the formation of a "Clean AFPFL" faction under Prime 
Minister U Nu and an opposition "Stable AFPFL" under the 
principal Socialist Party leaders, U Kyaw Nyein and 
U Ba Swe -- afforded new opportunities for the above-
ground communists. As the first step in its exploitation 
of the AFPFL rift, the communist-led NUF bloc modified 
its stand on "internal peace" terms to end the civil 
war to accord with Prime Minister Nu's principle that 
insurgents "should surrender prior to legalization of 
their political activities" (rather than "negotiate on 
an equal basis" for their surrender and legalization, 
which had been previously proposed by both the above-
ground and insurgent leaders). During June, actual 
parliamentary support by the NUF sustained Prime Minister 
Nu's cabinet against a no confidence vote proposed by 
the Stable AFPFL. The objectives of the Communists were 
clearly exposed by their leaders' proposal that the new 
Clean, AFPFL cabinet appointed by U Nu should work 
toward a "broader national Onited front" to include the 
insurgent leaders, although the Prime Minister denied 
that he would form a genuine alliance with the NUF in 
return for its parliamentary support. The Communists, 
moreover, continued their policy of generally refraining 
from attacks on U Nu's "neutral" foreign policy and 
commenced to assail the Stable AFPFL as "instigated by 
the U.S. imperialists." 
During late June, the BWP was, in effect, rewarded 
when U Nu modified the government's internal peace terms 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 98 
by deleting the provision for "disavowal of armed 
rebellion as a means of political action" :and7by aceording 
the surrenderiffg.insurgents t'blariket amnesty? The 
NUF now appealed to the insurgents to surrender in ac-
cordance with the government terms. The underground BCP 
and OP(B) nevertheless refused to capitulate; the BCP, 
in fact, attempted instead to take advantage of the 
AFPFL rift by stiffening its original peace terms. The 
PCP leaders, however, surrendered with some of their 
followers, and their organization was legalized. Never-
theless, many of their followers remained underground 
with the bulk of the organization's arms supplies. The 
government attempted further to conciliate the NUF by 
ceasing to 'apply its public order legislation against 
individual above-ground Communists suspected of complicity 
with insurgents and by:releasing-?uspects detained'under 
those laws. A plan was also put through for partially 
disbanding the Pyusawhti -- the rural militia utilized 
to defend villages against insurgent attacks -- which 
contained many Stable AFPFL supporters and had been a 
target of communist propaganda attacks for "abuses of 
its authority." 
During late September, General Ne Win, the supreme 
commander of the armed forces, and a small group of sub-
ordinate top-ranking army of-
CONSEQUENCES OF ficers, prevailed upon Prime 
ARMY TAKEOVER Minister U Nu to issue a 
proclamation inviting Ne Win 
to form a "non-political" 
cabinet at the end of October which would preserve "law 
and order" and hold "democratic elections" for a new 
parliament before the end of April 1959. The army 
leaders' decision to assume control was probably 
motivated primarily by their concern over the bargaining 
position in parliament occupied by the communist-led 
NUF, although the attempts by the Clean AFPFL to purge 
the police andEygagEh-li of Stable AFPFL supporters 
(which, in effect, weakened both organizations) and to 
reduce the influence of the army in the formation and 
implementation of internal security policies were ad-
ditional significant factors. The army leaders' had 
also been disturbed by what they regarded as U Nu's 
excessively lenient peace terms for the insurgents and 
by the slackening of the enforcement of public order 
legislation against suspected subversives.

The army's assumption of control was accorded a 
generally favorable popular reaction. Nevertheless, 
the above-ground Communists (including the PCP as well 
as the NUF) denounced it as a "coup" by a "clique of 
army officers instigated by the Stable AFPFL" and as-
sailed U Nu for "yielding to their pressure." When 
General Ne Win took office at the end of October at the 
head of a "caretaker" cabinet composed largely of non-
party civil servants with the acquiescence of both the 
Stable and Clean factions of the AFPFL, the NUF reverted 
to its parliamentary opposition role and abstained from 
voting approval of the new government. 
By the end of the year, Burmese communist political 
capabilities had decreased considerably from the high point 
which they had reached during the summer. Army control has 
ended the importance of the procommunist NUF as the organ-
ization holding the balance of power in Parliament between 
the AFPFL Stable and Clean factions. The political 
importance of the NUF has been further weakened by the 
defection in October of noncommunist elements who oc-
cupied 16 of the 44 seats held by the coalition in Parlia-
ment, as well as by continued unwillingness of the PCP, 
and of small fringe groups representing the extreme left-
wing of the above-ground Communists, to recognize the 
leadership of the BWP. Also, following the army takeover, 
Prime Minister Nu announced that the blanket amnesty for 
surrendering insurgents would expire at the end of October. 
The army has prepared for a vigorous military offensive 
against the insurgents during the dry season which lasts 
through May 1959. The government has already revived the 
application of the public order laws (which had been 
suspended during the summer) to detain lower ranking 
individual above-ground ommunists in the rural areas 
suspected of subversive activities, and is reportedly 
preparing more drastic counter-subversiva legislation. 
In the interests of maintaining friendly relations, 
the Chinese Communist and Soviet Governments have 
continued to avoid any overt 
FOREIGN COMMUNIST encouragement of subversive 
POLICIES TOWARD elements in Burma which might 
BURMA offend the neutral Burmese govern-
ment. The year witnessed ex-
changes of numerous political, 
economic and cultural missions between Burma and the 
Soviet Union, Communist China, and satellite countries. 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 100 
During October 1958, according to Burmese press reports, 
the Chinese Communist leaders actually expressed to the 
Burmese Embassy staff their hope that "friendly relations" 
with Burma would "be strengthened" under the future 
government to be headed by Ne Win. The Ne Win govern-
ment, moreover, has not indicated any changes in Burma's 
neutral foreign policy, notwithstanding its domestic 
aknticommunist policies and acceptance of U.S. military 
and technical assistance. 
Nevertheless, the Chinese Communists have continued 
not only to attempt to gain the allegiance of the over-
seas Chinese minority in Burma through propaganda and 
extension of loans- to local businessmen, but also to 
infiltrate their agents among the refugees flowing into 
northern Burma across the thinly-patrolled Yunnan border. 
The Burmese government has been incapable of effectively 
checking the influx of immigrants, owing to the dif-
ficulties involved in adequately patrolling the border 
and the absence of a conclusive settlement between Burma 
and the Peiping regime either to demarcate the long-
disputed Sino-Burmese border (which could clearly define 
the areas to be patrolled by the Burmese) or to provide 
for joint Sino-Burmese immigration controls. 
Burma remains unwilling to make a major issue of 
these border problems because of its avowed policy of 
cordial relations with, and fears of possibly offending, 
Communist China. The Burmese government has consequently 
been compelled to continue its lax enforcement of im-
migration control regulations by occasional arrests and 
deportation of individual illegal Chinese immigrants. 
It is noteworthy, however, that a large portion of the 
immigrants has included tribespeople as well as Chinese 
who have fled to Burma to escape the rigors of forcible 
collectivization of agriculture and other drastic measures 
imposed under the recently-inaugurated "leap forward" 
program in China. Their reports of communist persecution 
have apparently alienated many of the tribespeople in 
northern Burma who are ethnically related to them, thus 
providing an antidote, to some extent, to covert Chinese 
efforts during recent years to foster separatist 
tendencies among them through propaganda on the "benefits" 
of communist rule in Yunnan. 
Soviet propaganda concerning Burma was limited 
throughout the year to occasional press and radio ac-
cusations of "covet; U.S. intrigues in Burma" with

"disaffected feudal Shan chiefs," the Chinese Nationalist 
irregular troops within the border area of the Shan State, 
and the Stable AFPFL, with the objective of indirectly 
"undermining Burma's neutral foreign policy and dragging 
the country into the Western SEATO bloc." No significant 
official Soviet reactions to the Burma army takeover have 
yet been reported. 
(SECRET) 
CAMBODIA 
While the indigenous communist movement in Cambodia 
remained an insignificant political force, the Cambodian 
government during 1958 continued to pursue a tortuous 
foreign policy of "balanced neutrality," the net effect 
of which was to establish closer ties with the Sino-
Soviet Bloc. The most importartmove in this direction 
was cambodia's formal recognition of Communist China in 
July, followed by an exchange of ambassadors. Despite 
increasingly acrimonious relations with the two U.S. 
allies that flank Cambodia, the governments of Vietnam 
and Thailand, the Cambodian government expressed continued 
friendship for the United States, and indicated that it 
had no immediate intention of substituting Bloc military 
protection and assistance for that now furnished by the 
U.S. Domestically, Cambodian leaders maintained a hostile 
attitude toward the local communist party, easily blocking 
its efforts to elect candidates to the National Assembly 
in the March elections. However, the government's other 
actions to counter the increased communist subversive 
potential deriving from its flirtations with the Bloc 
were neither adequate in scope nor carried out in a 
consistent or determined manner. 
Cambodia departed in 1958 from its previous policy 
of avoiding formal diplomatic relations with either regime 
of a "divided" country. Despite 
RELATIONS WITH the growth of skepticism with 
COMMUNIST COUNTRIES regard to communist aims and 
alarm over evidences of foreign 
communist penetration of the 
Cambodian Chinese community noted in 1957, Cambodia 
formally recognized the Peiping regime on July 17, 1958, 
apparently in response to Chinese Communist diplomatic 
support during a border controversy with South Vietnam 
earlier that month. This action was followed by a formal 
state visit to ,Peiping by Prince Sihanouk in August, an 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 102 
exchange of ambassadors soon afterward, and the govern-
ment's closing of the Republic of China's only consulate 
in Cambodia in October. (Although the consulate had 
been accredited to the former French High Commissioner 
rather than to the Cambodian government, the latter had 
permitted it to continue to operate under an informal 
arrangement.) In November, Cambodia concluded a trade 
and payments agreement with the communist regime of North 
Vietnam. Although not related directly to these moves, 
the suspension of diplomatic relations with Thailand the 
same month, for reasons as yet unclear, maiked a further 
loosening of Cambodia's ties with the noncommunist world. 
In keeping with its concept of a "balanced" 
neutrality, however, Cambodia sought to keep the scales 
of its foreign relations from tipping too far to one 
side by taking several other actions favorable to the 
U.S. During September-October, Prince Sihanouk visited 
the United States, indicating upon his return that he 
had been most impressed by his reception and his observa-
tions. Apparently at Sihanouk's orders, the Cambodian 
government also began to enforce more rigorously its 
anti-polemic" press regulations, applying them particu-
larly to the anti-U.S. propaganda activities of the 
leftist press and the communist news agencies in Cambodia. 
Among other things, the government made the gesture of 
halting issuance of the New China News Agency bulletin, 
although it continued to permit circulation of the 
Chinese Communist ehabassy's bulletin. Also publishers 
of leftist papers were expressly warned by the Ministry 
of Information to moderate their procommunist and anti-
West tone or face suspension under the "anti-polemic" 
regulations. The government announced in December that 
it had no intention of establishing diplomatic relations 
with the communist regime of North Vietnam, despite the 
conclusion of a trade agreement with that regime and 
evidences of continuing distrust of the noncommunist 
government of South Vietnam. 
The communist diplomatic and economic missions 
in Cambodia generally have attempted to be very "correct" 
in their behavior and have tried not to give the 
Cambodians any reason to crack down on their activities. 
Initially, the Soviets were not as adroit as the 
Chinese Communists. Their lack of finesse and their 
propagandizing alienated the Cambodians and brought on 
attacks by governmental leaders, but they have recently 
emulated the Chinese and become more subtle and circum-
spect in their methods.

Communist China's economic aid program continues 
to dominate Bloc efforts. Prince Sihanouk reportedly 
received assurances of an ad-
COMMUNIST ECONOMIC ditional $5.6 million in aid 
ASSISTANCE during his trip to China, making 
a total of $28 million the 
Chinese Communists have contracted 
to give Cambodia in counterpart-generating aid goods. 
Although less than six million dollars have been received 
to date, the Peiping regime has derived considerable 
political and propaganda benefits from its aid. The 
willingness of the Cambodians to enter into closer 
relations with Peiping undoubtedly stems in great part 
from the favorable impression that Peiping's skillful 
handling of its limited economic assistance has created. 
The Chinese Communist aid program's effectiveness results 
from its emphasis upon various projects of high propa-
ganda impact, such as construction of schools, bridges 
and irrigation works, and upon the attention it gives to 
the creation of light industry, which Cambodian leaders 
and the Cambodian press continue to give much favorable 
publicity. 
Progress was also made by the Soviet Union in the 
construction of its major aid project, an $8 million, 
500-bed hospital scheduled to be finished in 1959. 
However, Soviet-Cambodian negotiations for a Soviet aid 
program have not moved forward because of the continued 
reluctance of the U.S.S.R. to extend aid to Cambodia on 
other than a loan basis, an arrangement which the 
Cambodian government is unwilling to accept. 
Other communist countries have offered only token 
aid to date. The Cambodian government continues to be 
receptive to Bloc offers of aid, although it reportedly 
acknowledges that Bloc personnel attached to the aid 
missions in Cambodia are supporting local leftist activity. 
Cambodia's establishment of formal ties with 
Peiping and the closing of the Nationalist Chinese 
consulate will undoubtedly 
COMMUNIST ACTIVITY facilitate communist penetration 
IN THE CHINESE AND of the commercially important 
VIETNAMESE COMMUNITIES Cambodian Chinese minority 
(about 300,000 in a population 
of five million). As in other 
overseas Chinese communities, the Cambodian Chinese, 
while preponderantly apolitical, are quick to accommodate 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 104 
to changes in the political climate in which they must 
work and live. Although the Chinese Nationalist consu-
late was relatively ineffective in stimulating positive 
local support for Taiwan or in protecting local Chinese 
interests from government exactions, its removal dealt 
a blow to the prestige of the Republic of China and 
left the field open to communist representatives. 
The Cambodian government has made some effort, 
however, to limit communist domination of the Chinese 
community. Its recent decision to issue laissez-maaps 
to those Chinese unwilling to carry Chinese Communist 
passports will at least allow uncommitted or pro-
Nationalist Chinese to travel without Chinese Communist 
sanction. In addition, the government has sought to 
bring the Chinese community more directly under its 
control. During 1057, pro-Communists had gained control 
of many of the leadership pcyit4.ons in the Chinese 
congregations into which the local Chinese were organized 
and through which they largely administered thair own 
affairs. The government attempted to arrest this trend 
by dissolving the congregations in May 1958, although it 
did not provide adequate machinery in their place to 
operate the various schools, hospitals, and other institu-
tions supported by the Chinese community. The Cambodian 
government reportedly plans, however, to reinstitute 
some type of self-administering organization for the 
Chinese and appoint non-Communists to head it. 
The Vietnamese community in Cambodia is approximately 
the same size as the Chinese community but less important 
economically. Communist activity among the Vietnamese 
is very guarded, partly to avoid arousing the latent anti-
Vietnamese prejudices of the Cambodians. Although most 
Vietnamese are considered to be pro-Hanoi and anti-Diem, 
actual Communists are undoubtedly a very small minority. 
Despite the noncommunist orientation of most Vietnamese 
groups hostile to the South Vietnamese government that 
now exist in exile in Cambodia (such as remnants of the 
Hoe Hao, Cao Dai and Dai Viet organizations), most of 
them maintain ties with Vietnamese communist agents who 
reportedly provide them with material and moral assistance. 
Communism continues to make only negligible 
progress among the Cambodian population at large. Among 
literate elite groups, however, 
THE LOCAL COMMUNIST especially the burgeoning 
PARTY student population and the 
developing unemployed "intel-

The Pracheachon (People's) Party, the small local 
Communist Party, is generally stigmatized as the tool of 
the Vietnamese Communists and has been so labeled by the 
Cambodian government. In the National Assembly elections 
of March 23, 1958 the Pracheachon was the only group to 
offer candidates in opposition to the ruling Sangkum 
Reastr Nivum (People's Socialist Community) of Prince 
Sihanouk. It was ruthlessly attacked by Sihanouk and 
his organization, and four of the five Pracheachon candi-
dates finally withdrew from the campaign. The fifth 
received less than three percent of the votes cast in 
his constituency. 
Since the elections the Pracheachon has kept its 
overt activities to a minimum. While now nominally 
voicing support for the alaghum, it has sought to 
infiltrate that organization, which, being an amorphous 
f grouping of widely divergent interests, is particularly 
vulnerable to such tactics. In addition, recurrent 
reports have been received of communist infiltration 
of various governmental agencies, particularly the 
Ministry of Information. Largely unsuccessful attempts 
to infiltrate the Cambodian army apparently have also 
occurred.

LAOS 
The agreements of November 18, 1957 between the 
Royal Lao Government and the pro-communist-directed 
Pathet Lao opened up the way for the latter to operoce 
overtly as a legal political party, the Neo Lao Hac 
Xat (Lao Patriotic Front - NLHX). The leadership, 
membership, and aims of the NLHX remain synonymous with 
those of the Pathet Lao, and the NLHX continues to take 
its ultimate direction from the Communist Lao 22na Party 
of the "Democratic Republic of Vietnam." Nevertheless, 
the NLHX gained considerable popular support by 
capitalizing on the prevailing neutralist sentiment in 
Laos, the government's failure to extend its programs 
effectively into the rural regions, and the disenchant-
ment with the largely discredited but still dominant 
conservative parties. As a-result, conservative leaders 
have attempted to put through a series of governmental 
reforms. At the same time, leaders and yoAger members 
of the civil service and bureaucracy have threatened a 
coup if the government fails to take effective action 
to check communist gains.

further emphasized by the lack

THE PATHET LAO period which ended in January, 
1958 when Pathet Lao troops were 
brought into the Royal Lao Army. 
However, members of the two Pathet Lao battalions (about 
1,500 men) who were integrated into the Royal Lao Army, 
although kept isolated from other army units, apparently 
were able to engage in extensive propaganda activity in 
the areas where they were stationed. Former Pathet Lao 
civil administrators inducted into the national admin-
istration have also enjoyed the opportunity to engage in 
proselytizing activities. This was particularly true in 
the provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua, where 50 percent 
of the Pathet Lao administrators were retained. While 
giving up its armed military base, the Pathet Lao was 
thus able to strengthea its political base through the 
medium of a legal political party which was free to 
operate openly in all parts of the country. 
The Neo Lao Hac Xat Party scored a substantial 
electoral victory in the May 4, 1958 supplementary elections. 
Nine NLHX candidates, representing 
THE MAY 4 ELECTIONS virtually the entire leadership, 
and five candidates from the 
fellow-traveling ?2n-liphab 
(Neutrality) Party, with which 
the NLHX was aligned in an election coalition, were elected 
out of a total of 21 contested seats. Although the NLHX-
dominated coalition gained only 40 percent of the popular 
vote, the disunited conservative parties split their 
vote by running 85 candidates for the seats at stake. 
The NLHX coalition ran especially strong in rural areas. 
Since the May elections, the NLHX has continued 
to try to strengthen its influence among Lao peasants 
and has also stepped up its 
NLHX ACTIVITIES activities in the towns where 
its candidates had been largely 
unsuccessful. Cadres integrated 
into the civil service and army have in the main been un-
able to subvert middle and higher echelon personnel, but 
they have reportedly gained some support among the lower 
ranks. Reports have been received of some penetration 
of the National Police and also more "progressive"

elements of the Buddhist priesthood. However, NLHX ef-
forts appear to have been most unsuccessful'at the village 
level, where reportedly 3,000 or more ex-Pathet Lao 
cadres have returned, set up NLHX cells, and apparently 
in some instances have been able to take over village 
leadership. Moreover, in the former Pathet Lao enclaves 
of Sam Neua and Phong Saly, the Royal Government has had 
repeated difficulties in imposing more than superficial 
authority, although Royal Lao Army elements are now 
stationed in both provinces. 
The NLHX has maintained a nationalist pose and 
has continued to attack corruption of government leaders 
and of the conservative parties. Further, the NLHX 
has attempted with some success to foster a concept of 
itself as having the real interests of the people at 
heart, which would contrast favorably with members of 
the Lao government who appeared to many Lao to be 
little concerned with the people's welfare. Little 
reliable information has been received about the actual 
organization of the NLHX or of the extent to which?it 
still receives direction from North Vietnam. Reports 
persist that a parallel covert Lao Communist Party 
composed of the hard-core cadres exists beneath the 
superstructure of the NLHX, but there is no reliable 
information on organization or membership. 
The dynamism of the NLHX and the growing possi-
bility that it might be able to gain control of Laos by 
legal, parliamentary means 
GOVERNMENT COUNTER- succeeded in shocking some Lao 
MEASURES conservative leaders out of 
their complacency. The tenacity 
with which some of the Lao held 
to the illusion that NLHX leaders were nationalists rather 
than Communists has been weakened, if not entirely 
eliminated, with the realization that the reunification 
has in fact been used by the former Pathet Lao to 
strengthen their position in the kingdom as a whole. 
Following the warning of the May election, the 
two dominant conservative parties, the Independent and 
Nationalist Parties, joined to form the Rally of the Lao 
People controlling 36 seats (out of a total 59) in the 
National Assembly. In mid-August, a new cabinet headed 
by Phoui Sananikone was formed from which the two former 
Pathet Lao members, who had been ih the previlous cabinet, 
were excluded. Nevertheless, the NLHX, ...alatipthgh, and a 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 108 
heterogenous collection of opportunist deputies, continued 
to constitute a militant opposition bloc, which with 
the potential assistance from disgruntled members of 
the conservative coalition, posed a threat to the sta-
bility of the cabinet. Another reaction to the growing 
strength of the NLHX was the formation of the extra-
parliamentary Committee for the Defense of National 
Interests (CDNI) in July 1958. The CDNI is militantly 
anticommunist and is composed of the younger leaders in 
the Lao bureaucracy, army, and police. With the support 
of the CDNI, four of whose members are in the cabinet, and 
the implicit backing of the army, Phoui has been able to 
push through a number of corrective measures. Some of 
the most notoriously corrupt members of the bureaucracy 
have been removed and the monetary system has been re-
formed, eliminating opportunities for trafficking 
in import licenses which had been a major source of 
corruption. 
The government also has under consideration elaborate 
plans for social and economic reforms reaching down to 
the village level as well as for various kinds of anti-
subversion programs, including the possible passage of 
an anticommunist law. These plans are pointed at 
defeating the NLHX in the next general elections which 
are scheduled for late 1959 or early 1960. At the same 
time, the army and the CDNI have threatened to stage a 
coup and suspend parliamentary democracy should the 
government or the Assembly fail to implement plans for 
effective counter-action to check NLHX advances.

SOUTH VIETNAM 
The illegal communist apparatus in South Vietnam, 
directed and supported from North Vietnam, continued to 
maintain a steady pressure of 'both terrorism and'nOn-violent 
subversion against the government of President Ngo Dinh 
Diem. However, effective security measures carried out 
by Diem have largely checked the immediate threat to 
internal security from communist activity and during 
1958 enabled the government to maintain a satisfactory 
level of public order in most areas of South Vietnam. 
There were practically no dramdtic highlights of 
the communists' 1958 campaign. High-ranking officials 
of the Diem government gave

similar to the bombings which occurred in October 1957. 
However, no such acts were carried out during the year. 
The typical pattern of communist activities during 1958 
was, rather, one of little-publicized assassinations, 
kidnappings, and robberies of local officials and 
private citizens at the village and district levels 
and of clandestine attempts to undermine the government's 
political bases and important programs by means of infil-
tration of strategic organizations and propaganda. During 
the first eight months of 1958, more than 125 local 
South Vietnamese officials and private citizens of pro-
Diem sympathies were assassinated. In addition, guerrilla 
forces which presumably were led by Communists conducted 
raids on two large rubber plantations in January and 
August. Communist propaganda in South Vietnam during 
1958 was directed against the government's programs of ? 
military conscription, land reform and agricultural 
credit, and resettlement of farmers in the strategic 
plateau areas in the notthwestern part of the country. 
No reliable evidence is available to indicate 
whether the total number of communist guerrillas (who 
possibly numbered 1,500-2,000 
COMMUNIST STRENGTH in mid-year) increased or 
decreased during 1958. Estimates 
of communist armed and unarmed 
strength in South Vietnam at any given time are of 
questionable validity because of the accessibility of 
South Vietnam's borders to penetration by communist 
agents coming directly from North Vietnam or from 
North Vietnam via Cambodia or Laos. Overt communist 
activity in 1958, as in 1957, was mostly restricted to 
South Vietnam's Military Zones Nos.I and V, which 
comprise the southwestern provinces near the Cambodian 
border and the southermost provinces of the country. 
However, President Diem has voiced concern over reports 
that the Qommunists have gained additional influence 
during 1958 among some of the tribal minority peoples 
who dwell in mountainous and plateau areas in the 
northern part of South Vietnam. Police officials also 
have been concerned that the Cambodian government's act 
of granting diplomatic recognition to Communist China 
in July might bring about an increase in communist 
subversive potential in South Vietnam, 
During 1958, there appears to have been some 
weakening of the communist leadership of those guerrilla

remnants of the formerly powerful, noncommunist politico-
religious "sects" -- the Binh ?Sum, Hoa Hao, and Cao 
Dai -- which are still in armed opposition to the 
government. According to South Vietnamese army sources 
of uncertain reliability, approximately 2,100 non-
communist guerrillas surrendered to government forces 
during the first half of 1958, and the total noncommunist 
guerrilla strength which was exploitable for communist 
purposes as of July was only 400-600. 
The Diem government continued to give first 
priority to internal security programs, although it 
also paid increasing attention 
GOVERNMENT to South Vietnam's economic 
COUNTER-ACTION development during the year. Its 
internal security apparatus --
consisting of armed forces and 
paramilitary and police organizations -- seems to have 
been strengthened during 1958, although some serious 
weaknesses were still apparent in the Civil Guard and 
the Self Defense Corps. In the fall, government security 
forces were conducting a major anti-dissident campaign 
in the areas between Saigon and the Cambodian border and 
parallel to almost the whole length of the Cambodian 
border. A "National Security Council" was established 
in the early fall to coordinate all government measures 
against communist subversive activities, and the govern-
ment continued to give vigorous support to anticommunist 
programs which had been begun in previous years, such as 
the anticommunist denunciation campaign and resettlement 
projects in the strategic plateau areas. 
While the communist regime in North Vietnam was 
covertly directing the communist subversive apparatus 
in South Vietnam during 1958, 
RELATIONS WITH it kept trying at the same time 
NORTH VIETNAM to create a propaganda image of 
itself as the only Vietnamese 
regime which favored the 
establishment of friendly relations between South and 
North and which championed national unification. Some 
of the communist propaganda maneuvers, such as a public 
letter in March from the North Vietnamese "prime 
minister" to President Diem which proposed "normalization" 
of relations, were disseminated by the subversive ap-
paratus in the South. For its part, the South Vietnamese 
government remained adamantly opposed during 1958 to

initiating any sort of relations with North Vietnam 
which might help advance communist interests. In May, 
it compelled a liaison mission from North Vietnam's

of the International Control Commission to leave Saigon, 
the apparent purpose of this move being to close all 
possible channels of subversive activities emanating 
from North Vietnam. In September, the South Vietnamese 
government publicly declared that it would hold ne-
gotiations with the communist regime of the North for 
the first time since the Geneva Agreements of 1954, the 
stated purpose of such negotiations being to settle 
minor administrative matters in the Demilitarized Zone 
between South Vietnam and North Vietnam. It is still 
uncertain whether such negotiations will actually be 
held; in any case, they are not expected to lessen the 
Diem government's strong anticommunist position.

THAILAND 
Communist activities have been outlawed in 
Thailand since the passage of the sweeping Anti-Communist 
Control Act in November 1952. A minuscule Thai Com-
munist Party and a Chinese COmmunist Party of possibly 
a few thousand members are believed to be operating 
covertly, but little is known of their organization or 
activities. The Thai government, while basically 
adhering to its anticommunist an' pro-Western foreign 
policy, had for the past few years shown some relaxation 
in its attitude toward Communist China and internal 
leftist activities. However, there appears to have 
been some hardening of the government's attitude since 
the assumption of power by a Revolutionary Council in 
October 1958. 
The Thai political scene during the past two 
years has been marked by change and uncertainty. In 
a little more than a year, the 
THAI GOVERNMENT Kingdom has undergone two extra-

October 1958 of a RevolutionaTy Council under Marshal 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 112 
Sarit's leadership, which is currently ruling under 
martial law after having dissolved the National As-
sembly and abrogated the Constitution. 
During early 1958, the somewhat ambivalent policy 
toward local procommunist groups pursued by the Thai 
government under former Prime Minister Phibun continued 
under the post-coup Thanom Kittikachorn government. 
While official spokesmen publicly strongly defended 
Thailand's anticommunist stand and adherence to its 
ties with the U.S. and SEATO, known leftists were named 
to the Thanom cabinet and held important posts in the 
government party, and Thai delegations continued to travel 
to Communist China with the implicit permission of the 
government. However, during the latter part of 1958, 
international developments, particularly in neighboring 
Laos and Cambodia and in the Taiwan trait Ei apparently 
stimulated an increased concern over the dangers of 
communist infiltration and subversion. Sarit also ap-
pears to have felt that toleration of leftist activity 
may have been a reason for his failure to get additional 
American aid during his trip to the U.S. in mid-1958. 
Finally, the Thai government reacted sharply to Cambodia's 
recognition of Communist China in July 1958, instituting 
extraordinary security precautions in the provinces 
bordering on Cambodia. In early October 1958, the govern-
ment took additional steps to counter communist subversion, 
the most dramatic being the expulsion of a Soviet 
diplomat and the deportation of the TASS correspondent 
for activities considered dangerous to the peace and 
security of the nation. 
Shortly after its assumption of power, the 
Revolutionary Council undertook a series of anticommunist 
actions, which included closing several leftist Thai 
and Chinese-language newspapers, and arresting numerous 
leftist politicians, newsmen, and businessmen. Ad-
ditionally, the Revolutionary Council has given evidence 
of making a serious effort to eliminate the security 
threat posed by the presence of some 40,000 Vietnamese 
refugees, the bulk of whom are pro-DRV, in the Laos 
border area of northeastern Thailand. A number of the 
procommunist refugee leaders have been arrested, and 
the Revolutionary Council apparently hopes to effect 
the repatriation Pf resettlement of the entire refugee 
group.

The prospects for the growth of communism in

attitude and the vigor and

leftist politicians and agitators and the closing of 
leftist newspapers, the Communists have been deprived of 
their principal propaganda media. These and other rather 
spectacular anticommunist measures recently instituted 
by the Thai government doubtless have made the atmosphere 
in Thailand less favorable for pro- and crypto-communist

Japan's 117 electoral districts) as it did in 1955, the 
JCP received a slight increase in ballots (1,012,036 votes 
or 2.6, percent of the popular vote, as against 733,121 
votes or 2.0 percent in the 1955 elections). Also, the 
party renewed attempts to secure the formal cooperation 
of ,the Socialist Party and Sohma (Nihon Rodo Kumiak 
fsliagikai General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), 
whose members include slightly more than one-half of 
the organized labor in Japan, in a "democratic united 
front." In both of these endeavors the party failed to 
make significant headway largely because it still suffers 
from a general lack of acceptance by the Japanese public.

Party membership, estiMated at roughly 70,000, 
remained stationary but there were numerous signs of 
decreased morale and lack of enthusiasm reflected in the 
dropping circulation of the party newspaper Akahata (Red Flag) 
(50,000 copies in May 1958 -- 1.6,000 below Lthe_July.1957 
figure), and the party's evident difficulties with dues 
and subscription collections. Dissatisfaction with the 
party's policies and leadership resulting in -new 
factional cleavages were further indications of internal 
malaise. 
Despite the failure of the JCP's formal overtures 
to the Socialist Party and .g.ghys., there was informal 
cooperation on the local level between the Communists and 
these two groups during the year, particularly in con- . 
nection with the storm of opposition that greeted the 
Kishi government's ill-advised attempt to force the 
passage of a bill designed to increase the powers of the 
police. When the government finally withdrew the bill 
from Diet consideration, the Communists claimed a victory 
because their actions had contributed to the government's 
decision. Frequent repetition of such incidents, which 
provide excellent opportunities for the Communists to 
propagandize on the benefits of "united front" action, 
might make it increasingly difficult for the Socialist 
leadership to maintain its present strong resolve, the 
more so as the left wing finds a certain ideological 
appeal in the current communist line of "peaceful" tactics. 
Communist and extreme leftist influence in ?shyg 
remained strong enough to keep apilm's policies very 
close to the communist line. Thus the procommunist 
faction of 5.121112 prevented the "mainstream" faction 
from sending a protest on the Nagy execution to the 
Hungarian government, thereby aligning ,ggilys with the 
Communists and against the Japanese public at large, 
which Shared the world's revulsion at the Hungarian 
action. The party's determination to step up its ap-
proach to organized labor is evident in the inclusion 
of a relatively large number of former labor leaders 
in the JCP's new Central Committee elected at the 
Seventh Party Congress in July and its adoption at that 
time of a new "labor movement" policy which fixes 
responsibility for guidance of unions in "key industries" 
in the Central Committee,

During the year the Japanese government continued 
its vigorous campaign to reduce communist and extreme 
leftist influence in Japan. With respect to the JCP, 
well-publicized attacks were made by the police against 
three illegal activities of the party. The Police raided 
key units of the "People's Fleet" (a covert maritime 
communications and smuggling network between Japan and 
Communist China or North Korea) and the "Truck Corps" 
(a secret organization first discovered in 1957 which 
engaged in illegal business practices, including embezzle-
ment and other types of fraud, to provide funds for the 
party), arresting members of the two organizations and 
confiscating organization assets. In addition, three 
government officials were arrested (although later, 
released) and three others questioned by the police on 
suspicion of having given classified information to the 
JCP. Also, the government's effort to curb leftist 
influences in education by establishing a teachers' ef-
ficiency rating system was at least partially successful 
and though the bill to increase the power of the police 
had to be withdrawn, the government continued to use 
the administrative powers it already has to discipline 
leftist leaders in the public service unions. 
The year saw no change in the JCP's willingness 
to accept Bloc "dictation" on foreign policy issues, a 
factor which contributed to the 
THE JCP AS A party's failure to win additional 
PROPAGANDA INSTRUMENT popular support. Thus, the JCP 
QNzIET denounced the "Kishi government" 
BLOC when the Chinese Communists broke 
off trade relations in May, 
denounced the government also for 
demanding from the Soviet Union a greater salmon-trout 
fishing quota for Japanese fishermen, supported the 
Chinese Communist position on the threat posed by the 
presence of the United States in the Taiwan straits area, 
and demanded that the Kishi government conclude an im-
mediate peace treaty with the Soviet Union. . ?. 
In carrying out its mission as an instrument for 
Chinese Communist and Soviet propaganda, the JCP 
suffered a setback this year when the Japanese public 
became aware, through press criticism, of the extent 
of communist influence in the Fourth World Conference 
for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held 
in Tokyo in August. Not only did the Conference have a

large proportion of delegates from international com-

followed the international communist line, i.e., the 
nuclear test resolution was crilical only of the United 
States and the United Kingdom. 
The Seventh Party Congress, the first since 
December 1947, was held in Tokyo from July 21 to 
August 1. Almost all the organ-
THE SEVENTH izational changes made at the 
PARTY CONGRESS Congress had been widely disk-
cussed for ten months before it 
was convened. The Congress 
elected an enlarged leadership group, enacted a reviseN 
set of bylaws, adopted an "action program:' accepted a 
"political report" which fixed responsibility for the 
1950-55 intra-party dissension on the party's late 
Secretary General Tokuda Kyuichi and some of his as-
sociates, and confirmed the expulsion of former Central 
Committee members Ito Ritsu, Shida Shigeo, and Stiliino 
Etsuro. But its main significance lay in the failure of 
the party leadership to end factionalism, evident in the 
Congress' inability to agree on and enact a revised 
party platform submitted by the leadership. 
The new 31-member Central Committee is slightly 
more than double the Size of the one that governed the 
party from July 1955. Despite the presence of many

majority of whom have held mid-echelon positions for a 
number of years; also, the average age of the new 
Central Committee (54 years) is exactly the same as that 
of the previous one. Selection for the Central Com-
mittee seems to have been made primarily on the basis 
of loyalty to the new and dominant "headquarters" 
faction, which was formed as a result of the 1955 
lAapilagtamtn-1 between Nosaka Sanzo and Miyamoto Kenji, 
the leaders of the party's two principal rival factions 
prior to that time. Despite the increased size of the

largely to give equal prominence to the leaders of 
the two groups which had split the party from 1950 to

elected by the party COngress rather than to be appointed 
by the Central Committee. Length of party experience 
was made a criterion for selection to various party 
posts, i.e., eight years for regular and candidate 
Central Committee members and Control and Audit Com-
mittee members, and four years for prefectural committee 
members. However, in an attempt to gain new members, 
the party eliminated its previous requirement of a 
probationary period for new applicants for membership. 
Strong opposition from the so-called "anti-
headquarters" faction was responsible for the failure 
of the party Congress to adopt 
FACTIONALISM the party's revised platform. 
For more than a year this faction 
has heen describing the Central 
Committee as "politically, ideologically, and morally 
decadent." This minority group is composed of dis-
gruntled younger members of the party, drawn mainly 
from the party's local apparatus in Tokyo (Tokyo 
Metropolitan Committee) but also from students, 
especially those affiliated with Zencakuren (Zen ausm 
Gakusei Jichikai -- All-Japan Federation of 
Student Self-Government Associations), the communist-
dominated organization for students. Disagreement on 
the revised party platform centered around the analysis 
and outline of future party strategy. The draft sub-
mitted by the party leadership and reportedly approved 
by MOSCOW and Peiping characterized Japan as an "ad-
vanced capitalist country under the partial occupation 
of the United States"; identified the "main enemy" as 
both "American imperialism" and its "subservient ally, 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 118 
Japanese monopoly capitalism"; and advocated a two-
step revolution -- a "people's democratic" revolution 
followed by a "socialist" revolution. The "anti-
headquarters" faction, on the other hand, contended 
that Japan could now be considered "independent't 
favored placing emphasis on the Kishi government 
("Japanese monopoly capitalism") as the main target 
for JCP efforts while continuing to work against 
"American imperialism," and advocated staging a one-
stage or immediate "socialist" revolution. 
Although factionalism thus continues as a per-
ennial problem within the party, at the end of 1958 it 
seemed to be less of a disruptive factor than at any 
time since 1950. The majority of the party now supports 
the "headquarter" group. The threat to the party 
leadership's power posed during 1936-57 by expelled 
? former Central Committee member Shida Shigeo (who had 
established the "National Communist League") subsided 
early in the year, and the Central Committee in mid-
July probably delivered the couo de arAgg to Shida's 
faction by expelling his close associate, former Central 
Committee member Shiino Etsuro, as well as other minor 
functionaries who had sided with Shida. 
The remaining faction, the "anti-headquarters" 
group, provided the greatest opposition to the JCP 
leadership in 1958, the action taken on June 1 by 
Zeralkuren having been perhaps the single most important 
challenge to the party leadership during the year. At 
Zengakuren's Eleventh National Convention in late May, 
despite its outwardly routine appearance, there was an 
undercurrent of uneasiness caused by apparent JCP 
support for the "minority group" instead of for the 
"majority group." (The "majority group" included the 
nominal Zgligicuren leaders, most of whom were JCP 
members and favored more militant action, whereas the 
"minority group" favored more passive activities and thus 
were more in accord with the party's current emphasis 
on "passive" tactics.) On the day after the convention 
adjourned, all party member delegates (about 130) 
attended a meeting at JCP headquarters to discuss 
.4gLig2ismall struggle policies, at which Presidium 
member Konno Yojiro and central headquarters officials 
connected with student "guidance" presided. The JCP 
officials soon lost control of the meeting and reportedly 
were even forcibly detained for a time while the

"majority group" passed resolutions, including a demand 
for the resignation of JCP Central Committee members 
and for the expulsion of "anti-4anaplmn elements" 
in the party. 
After conducting a special investigation of the 
meeting, the JCP in an editorial in Akahata on June 23 
described the "June I incident" (as it now was called) 
as the "most flagrant" violation of the party regulations 
in the 36-year history of the party. In extremely strong 
language, the editorial condemned the students for their 
"premeditated anti-party" action, and for the "deviation" 
of attempting to destroy the principle of "democratic 
centralism" and to replace it with unrestricted freedom 
of the individual. The students were also charged with 
having "petit bourgeois" attitudes and anarchist ideas 
traceable in part to "revisionism" and to "Trotskyism." 
On July 18, the JCP Central Committee announced that the 
chairman of Lgaaalluren and two members of its Central 
"Executive Committee had been expelled from the party and 
that disciplinary action had been taken against an ad-
ditional 13 members; Konno lost his Presidium post and 
was not reelected to the new Central Committee, probably 
because of his "deficiencies" in handling the meeting. 
Although troubled by the "serious deviation" 
itself, the party leadership also appears to have used 
the June 1 incident as a springboard for its attack on 
the lokyo Metropolitan Committee (TMC). The TMC not 
only shared responsibility with central headquarters for 
Zenqakuren guidance, but, forming as it did the backbone 
of the "anti-headquarters" faction, was regarded as 
primarily responsible for the failure of the "party 
Congress to adopt the revised party platform. At the 
fourth TMC Conference held in two sessions in late 
September and early October, the party leadership, by 
concentrated effort and clever maneuvering principally 
on the part of Secretary General Miyamoto, was able 
to secure a "satisfactory self-criticism" from the TMC. 
The party hierarchy was also successful in preventing 
the retention in the new TMC of some incumbent members 
who were also leaders of the "anti-headquarters" faction, 
such as Takei Akio (who had long played an active role 
in ZgLigAhuIgn), Katayama Satoshi, and Noda Yosaburo. 
To safeguard against a repetition of the "deviations" 
of which the TMC was charged ("liberalism" and 
separatism"), the TMC was enlarged to include one 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 120 
Central Committee member and one member of the Kanto 
Regional Bureau; Presidium member and chief of the Kanto 
Regional Bureau Kasuga Shoichi was subsequently ap-
pointed TMC chairman. 
The JCP did not make any "great leap forward" 
during 1958, and it cannot be expected to make any 
significant progress in the 
PROSPECTS near futuFe. It is not likely 
that the Party will be able to 
progress toward its goal of a 
"united front" with the Socialists in the immediate 
future, although it will undoubtedly continue to exert 
considerable leverage on !socialist oriented trade unions 
and mass organizations. Its heavy infiltration of many 
such groups, including the teachers', government 
employees', and railway workers' unions, will continue 
to enable it to exert an influence disproportionate tic) 
its size on Japanese public opinion, especially by 
exploiting already existing popular attitudes that 
parallel communist objectives. Such attitudes include 
opposition to rearmament, fear of involvement in war, 
and opposition to nuclear tests in the Pacific. Largely 
due to the party leadership's repressive actions during 
1958, overt factionalism will probably not be a serious 
problem in the immediate future, and the party hierarchy 
should be able to maintain effective control.

HONG KONG AND MACAU 
The year 1958 saw still another British refusal 
to allow the Chinese Communists to station an official 
representative in Hong Kong. 
HONG KONG This negative reply, given the 
Chinese charge d'affaires in 
London on February 27th in 
response to a Chinese request made in the fall of 1957, 
reaffirmed the British position. London does not want 
any official Chinese representative (Zommunist or 
Nationalist) in Hong Kong who might set himself up as 
the official spokesman for the 99 percent of Hong 
Kong's population which is Chinese; 
The Chinese Communists do have, however, numerous 
spokesmen in Hong Kong, and 1958 was a busy year for 
them. One of the chief fields of communist activity

was education, an enterprise which has been one of 
increasing concern to the Hong Kong authorities. The 
struggle was joined squarely in January with the passage 
of legislation designed to restrict political activity 
in schools. From the time this legislation was first 
proposed until after its formal adoption the many com-
munist front groups vigorously opposed it as an "attack" 
on all Chinese education, but without generating any 
effective organized opposition. New regulations not-
withstanding, some of the more openly procommunist schools 
continued with their political activities, apparently in 
a defiant attempt to test the strength of the new law. 
One result of all this was the temporary closing of 
several schools for violation of building codes and 
infringement of the new regulations, followed later by the 
deportation of the headmaster of one of the better known 
procommunist schools. These school incidents and matters 
arising from them have also been the subject of at least 
three formal protests from the Peiping regime to the 
British government. This indicates not so much the 
serious view Peiping takes of interference with pro-
communist schools in Hong Kong, but rather the desire 
of the Chinese Communists to maintain unremitting pressure 
on the British colony, and their readiness to utilize 
any pretext at hand. 
Perhaps the most widely-heralded communist campaign 
in the field of labor was that conducted in connection 
with the London decision to close down the Royal Naval 
Dockyard. One of the largest single employers in the 
colony, the Dockyard is to be closed down over a period 
of several years. Spearheaded by communist-led unions, 
the workers at the Dockyard were encouraged to make ever-
increasing demands for reemployment guarantees and in-
creased retirement payments. Efficient assistance by 
the authorities in helping dismissed workers find new 
jobs, together with prompt action by the police to 
forestall mob scenes from which trouble could have 
developed, combined to rob the Communists of any op-
portunity to embarrass seriously the Hong Kong govern-
ment or to stage a spectacular demonstration. Despite 
the rather unexpected failure of the Communists to 
capitalize successfully on this issue, their strength 
in the labor field remained undiminished, and their 
inability to profit by the Dockyard closure must be 
considered a lost opportunity rather than a damaging 
blow to the communist position within the labor move-
ment. 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 122 
Propaganda has always been one of the principal 
occupations of the Communists in Hong Kong; most of it 
is imported from the communist-held mainland, but some 
is written in Hong Kong under policy directives from 
Canton and Peiping. The American government and 
American policy have been favorite objects of abuse in 
these propaganda blasts, and few things delight the 
Communists as much as the opportunity to attack or 
ridicule the real and alleged activities of the American 
government in Hong Kong. Throughout 1958 the local 
communist newspapers intermittently carried such propa-
ganda, but with the build-up of tension in the Taiwan 
strait anti-American propaganda occupied an ever-increasing 
linage. Toward the end of November the combined pro-
communist press in Hong Kong opened up with a barrage of 
anti-American propaganda, charging the Americans in Hong 
Kong with using educational, religious and charitable 
institutions in the colony for espionage and other vile 
purposes. This campaign continued to develop throughout 
the lest few weeks of the year, and seemed likely to be-
come one of the major communist propaganda efforts in 
Hong Kong during 1959. 
The Communists also have regularly used Hong Kong 
as one base for the launching of propaganda campaigns 
directed at her international audience and particularly 
toward the Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan. One consistent 
theme has been the appeal by old acquaintances to Chinese 
"temporarily separated from the motherland" to return to 
the fold by deserting to the Communists. During the late 
summer and early autumn Hong Kong was filled with rumors 
concerning the activities of alleged political middle-
men who were putting forward purported terms for negoti-
ations between Peiping and the Chinese Nationalists. 
The circulation of such rumors appears to have been one 
communist tactic to demoralize supporters of the Chinese 
Nationalists. 
The Communists from mainland China have also 
conducted campaigns against Hong Kong with the double 
purpose of threatening the colony with economic dif-
ficulties and at the same time enhancing the prestige 
of the Peiping regime and of local front organizations. 
One such campaign was that designed to gather all 
fishing boats along the South China coast (including 
those operating from Hong Kong and Macau) into so-called 
"fishing cooperatives" which would market their catch

on the mainland of China and resell to Hong Kong at a 
marked-up price. For the first few months of 1958 the 
Communists appeared to be entirely earnest about carrying 
this through, but the pressure on Hong Kong and Macau-
based fishermen was relaxed about mid-year with the 
implication that it would be reapplied in 1959. Despite 
this respite the fishing industry has suffered serious 
damage in Hong Kong, and for several months was nearly 
wiped out in Macau. 
What is perhaps potentially the most serious threat 
to Hong.Kong's prosperity, or even its very existence, 
was the September announcement by Peiping that China 
intended to claim territorial sovereignty over waters to 
a distance of twelve miles from land. Since the twelve 
miles are to be measured from a base line connecting 
base points, including outlying coast41 islands, that 
were not precilely defilled, it is not possible to determine 
just how much open sea Peiping has claimed. By any 
measurement, however, the commonly used shipping channel 
between Hong Kong and Macau is in Chinese-claimed waters, 
and the only air and sea approaches to Hong Kong are a 
narrow channel from the southeast. How Peiping may chose 
to enforce this twelve mile claim in the future remains 
a question. There can be little doubt, that this un-
certainty has increased the prestige of Peiping's supporters 
in Hong Kong, and created doubt and apprehension among 
many of the uncommitted or pro-Nationalist Chinese. 
Communist carryings-on for 1958 in Macau seemed 
to have been characterized not so much by the accustomed 
bold braggadocio but rather by 
MACAU a quiet self-confidence. This 
did not preclude the usual 
publicity given by local propaw 
ganda organs to Communist China's claims of achievement 
"construction" and in the "great leap forward," and 
ai''?lompts to identify patriotism and the Chinese heritage 
with only the Peiping regime. In contrast with Hong 
Kong, however, communist propaganda in Macau seldom 
seemed designed to foment unrest and dissatisfaction 
among Macau's 99 percent Chinese population. Pressure 
was applied to Macau, at times through local procommunist 
spokesmen, at other timesby either the Kwangtung 
provincial officials or the central government officials 
in Peiping, and while this was known to both the 
authorities and the population at large it was not the 
occasion for loud fanfare. 
SECRET/NOFORN 
SECRET/NOFORN 124 
Developments of 1958 must have added to the Com-
munists' conviction that Macau exists at Peiping's 
sufferance; conversely, they must have added to the 
worries of the Portuguese and -anticommunist Chinese 
in Macau. In September 1958 the Government of Portugal 
abstained from voting on the question of Chinese member-
ship in the UN, thus continuing the stard adopted by 
Lisbon upon first entering the UN in December 1955. 
Although Portugal is firmly anticommunist and continues 
to recognize the Government of the Republic of China 
as the legitimate government of China, the desire to 
avoid placing Macau in any situation more delicate than 
the one it now occupies has led Lisbon to eschew scrupu-
lously any action which might unduly antagonize the 
Chinese Communists, 
During 1958 qere were several examples of the 
kind of pressure the Portuguese fear the Chinese might 
apply to Macau. One of these was the move .during the 
first half of the year to herd the fishermen of Macau 
and Hong Kong into "cooperatives." It became evident at 
that time that the Communists are able to cut off Macau's 
supply of seafood at any time they desire. In view of 
the tiny area of land and sea included within the Over-
seas Province of Macau, this is true not only of seafood 
but also of almost everything else the residents eat or 
drink. Toward the end of 1958 the Chinese undertook 
the construction of a dike which not only threatens to 
cut off Macau's supply of fresh water, but may also 
result in the silting up of Macau's inner harbor. It 
is quite likely that solutions to both of these problems 
will be found, but the fact that they will have to be 
reached in cooperation with the Chinese Communists il-
lustrates the extent to which the latter can influence 
Macau. 
Since the end of World War II the Chinese National-
ists have maintained an official in Macau, called the 
Special Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry. The 
presence of this official has for some time irked the 
Chinese Communists and their supporters in Macau. In 
1958, as on several other occasions, the Communists 
brought pressure on the Portuguese to expel this natural 
enemy of theirs. For a period of time it looked as 
though the Communists might succeed in this measure, 
but the Macau authorities eventually solved the problem 
by arranging for the Nationalist official to be absent

?from Macau during the period when his presence would have 
been most objectionable to the communists. Thus he was 
recalled to Taipei for "consultation" during the first 
half of October, a period of time spanning the national 
day celebrations of both the Chinese Nationalists and 
Communists; the Nationalists were left with the under-
standing that he could return to Macau when the pressure 
was off. In this tortuous fashion the Macau authorities 
managed to avoid an impossible situation, and in much 
the same manner as they have for four hundred years. In 
this particular case it might seem that the Chinese 
Nationalists had come off rather better than they might 
have expected to do. The Communists were able dratically 
to reduce the celebrations in Macau on the Nationalists' 
national day, while just ten days earlier the Communists 
had produced as 2avish a spectacle as they had wished for 
their own national day, and this- suggests again the very 
great extent to which the Communists already are able to 
manipulate events in Macau.

AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND 
In April 1958, the leaders of the Communist Party 
of Australia (CPA) held their 18th Party Congress (tri-
annual) in Sydney. The Congress 
AUSTRALIA adopted a new party program and 
constitution and elected a new 
Central Committee. However, 
the proceedings revealed no great change in the activities 
or potential of the CPA. 
The central point of the party's domestic policy 
was defined as a "united front" with the Australian 
Labor .Party designed to defeat the Menzies Government 
in the Federal parliamentary elections. Although the 
party participated in the November 1958 elections, it 
failed to elect any candidate while the government 
coalition succeeded in increasing its already, strong 
parliamentary position. 
The CPA has continued faithfully to echo the com-
munist line as determined by Moscow and Peiping. During 
the year, there were no signs of serious conflict with-
in the Iterty, although the Party Congress called for 
"tightened discipline" in order to stamp out the last 
vestiges of the "revisionism" that flowered after de-
Stalinization and the Hungarian revolution.

SECRET/NOFORN 126 
There have been no significant changes in CPA 
numerical strength, which remains at about 5,000. The 
Party Congress set ambitious goals for expansion of 
Temberahip,_ but efforts to tighten disci-
pline may well prove an obstacle to the policy of 
"party building." 
The CPA is primarily dependent on the Australian 
labor movement for the achievement of its objectives. 
It continues to profit from the split in the labor move-
ment and from the reluctance of the Australian Labor 
Party to enforce its ruling against Labor Party members 
appearing on "unity" tickets with Communists in union 
elections. Communists continue to control or influence 
important unions in stevedoring, transportation, building, 
coal mining, and heavy industry. 
Aside from its role in the trade union movement, 
the CPA engaged in certain propaganda activities. Through 
newspapers and other publications, it attacked the 
policies of the United States, Australia's close military 
and foreign policy ties with the U.S., the stationing 
of Australian troops abroad, and continued nuclear tests, 
while urging the recognition of Communist China, expanded 
relations with the Soviet Bloc, and a united labor front. 
The CPA's direct impact on public opinion is minimal. 
It has scored more notable successes through front organ-
izations; in particular, cultural exchanges and the 
travel of labor and other delegations to communist 
countries have contributed to popularizing to some extent 
the Soviet and Chinese Communist cause in Australia. 
An independent and legally recognized organiza-
tion like its Australian counterpart, the Communist 
Party of New Zealand (CPNZ) 
NEW ZEALAND is numerically weak -- member-
ship is currently estimated at 
several hundred -- and politically 
insignificant. It received less than a thousand votes 
in tkie 1957 national elections, a fraction of one percent 
of the total popular vote, and has no parliamentary 
representation. Internal dissension stemming from 
reactions to the Hungarian revolution has seriously 
weakened the CPNZ. In sum, the CPNZ has little direct 
political impact and concentrates instead on exerting 
influence through the labor movement upon the ruling 
New Zealand Labor Party.

A report of the Political Committee to the 
National Committee of the CPNZ in April 1958 reveals 
the Party's determination to gain wider influence 
within the labor movement through support of the Labor 
government and particularly of "positive points" (anti-
capitalist aspects) of the Labor Party program. The 
CPNZ report states that "this method is the key to 
consolidation of our influence among present Labor 
Party supporters, creating the conditions for the 
changing of their ideology. This way we ultimately win 
the ideological struggle and with it the leadership of 
the working class." Nevertheless, Communist Party ef-
forts are hindered by the steadfast opposition of the 
New Zealand Federation of Labor, and communist influence 
in industry and the trade unions remains minor. 
The CPNZ continued its propaganda activities 
during 1958. The New Zealand Peace Council, a communist 
front, concentrated its efforts on campaigning against 
nuclear weapons. Another front, the New Zealand Society 
for Closer Relations with Russia, sponsored a well-
publicized New Zealand-U.S.S.R. "Friendship Week" and 
arranged for a noncommunist delegation from the National 
Council of Women to visit the Soviet Union in August

VII, LATIN AMERICA 
128 
The climate for communist activities in Latin 
America -- generally favorable throughout 1957 --
tended to improve during the past year, particularly 
in the countries of South America. In the course of 
the year the overthrow of the authoritarian Perez 
Jimenez regime in Venezuela and important elections in 
fourteen republics gave the Communists in many of these 
countries an opportunity to play an active role in 
national politics and to test the effectiveness of their 
propaganda appeals. The Communists took full advantage 
of Vice President Nixon's visit and U.S. actions re-
stricting imports of key Latin American minerals to focus 
increasingly critical socio-economic unrest against the 
United States. There were indications of greater Soviet 
interest in the area and closer direction of the Latin 
American communist movement from Moscow. The sustained 
Soviet Bloc economic drive in Latin America strengthened 
local communist propaganda campaigns and probably in-
creased popular resistance to the type of solutions'for 
the area's economic problems favored by the United States., 
The Latin American Communists continued to present 
themselves as respectable, reform-minded nationalists, 
occasionally less radical than the indigenous noncommunist 
left. They echoed the Soviet line in denouncing revq-
lution as a political weapon and pressed for closer re-
lations with the Soviet Bloc and for Latin American 
neiltrality in the Cold War. Legalization of the Com-
munist Parties of Colombia (December 1957), Venezuela, 
and Chile stimulated Communists in neighboring countries 
to intensify their campaigns for legal status. These 
psychological gains were somewhat offset late in the 
year by the defeat of tommunist-backed candidates in 
Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, and 'Uruguay, and by fairly 
widespread disillusionment of leftist and communist 
intellectuals over the Pasternak affair. 
SOVIET DIRECTION OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNIST MOVEMENT

of growing Soviet concern over the lack of coordination 
within the communist movement in Latin America and 
determination to provide more immediate guidance to the

movement. Following the 40th anniversary celebrations 
in Moscow, representatives of the CPSU met with com-
munist delegates from eighteen Latin American republics 
to review questions of broad strategy and tactics. 
While no major innovations were introduced in the 
strategy followed by the Latin American Communists since 
1956, provisions were apparently made for closer co-
operation and coordination of effort between the Com-
munist parties of the area and for more frequent travel 
of party leaders to the U.S.S.R. It seems almost certain 
that the decision to establish a training school for Latin 
Ameri;an Communists in Buenos Aires was taken in Moscow. 
Repoirtedly plans were laid in Moscow fw!mthe secret a 
meeting of Middle American tommunist leaders, which was 
held in Mexico in March, and for the Argentine Congress 
for International Cooperation, General Disarmament, and 
National Sovereignty held in Buenos Aires in May. CPSU 
urging may also have prompted the holding of national 
congresses by four Latin American 6ommunist parties in 
1958. Representatives of virtually all of the Qommunist 
parties in the area attended one or more of these region-
al and national congresses to exchange information and 
experiences common to Latin America. 
Opportunities for high level coordination of Latin 
American communist activities with Soviet objectives in 
the area were increased during 1958 by the stepped-up 
travel to Moscow of secretaries-general and central 
committee members from 'communist parties throughout 
Latin America. In mid-1958 the secretaries-general of 
five Latin American eommunist parties -- those of Colombia, 
Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, and Venezuela -- were in 
the Soviet aoc, and probably in Moscow, simultaneously. 
Earlier in the year Pedro Saad, secretary-general of 
the Ecuadorann Communist Party, also visited Moscow. 
Soviet use of Latin American tommunist exiles as 
couriers and possibly as advisers to (communist parties 
in the area was revealed with the arrest of a Guatemalan 
Communist, Jose Manuel Fortuny, in Rio de Janeiro in 
October. After an extended stay in the Soviet Union, 
Fortuny was sent to Brazil and Uruguay in August. He 
was arrested en route to Caracas, where he was reportedly 
to work with the Venezuelan Communist Party in the final 
phase of the electoral campaign.

It seems likely that -- as in previous years --
instructions to the Latin American Communist parties 
were also conveyed by foreign Communists who visited 
the area during 1958. For example, in May members of 
the Soviet delegation to the Frondizi inauguration 
visited Uruguay, Argentina, and Mexico and a group of 
Soviet trade union leaders traveled to Chile, while in 
August the Soviet delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary 
Union meeting in Rio de Janeiro went to Uruguay to attend

commercial and cultural groups which visited Latin America. 
CULTURAL AILIQ_Eggig_g_g_ATIoti, 
Throuhout the year the USSR continued its practice 
of sending outstanding cultural groups to Latin America, 
principally to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay. 
Among the leading attractions were a ten-member ballet 
group, a large delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary 
Union meeting, a delegation of journalists, and a five-
member student group. The ballet received consistently 
favorable reviews and the student group enjoyed consider-
able popularity, due no doubt to the inclusion of Isolde 
Iavitskaia, star of the Soviet film "The 41," which had 
been widely exhibited in South America. The Zommunist 
Chinese culttral effort in Latin America, which -began 
in 1956, also gained momentum during the year with the 
extended visit of a 54-member acrobatic troupe to 
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay. 
The most striking innovation in the bloc cultural 
offensive in Latin America was the use of ten well-
publicized Soviet film festivals in six South American 
countries. Argentina and Ecuador were the major targets. 
There. had been no such festivals during 1957 and only 
one in 1956. The film festivals, which lasted one week 
and featured high caliber productions, were well attended 
and received favorable reviews. Since 1955, Soviet 
)Bloc film showings in series o "cycles,'! not advertised 
as festivals, have been held occasionally in Argentina, 
Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay, and individual Soviet and 
satellite films have been shown frequently in a number 
of countries. However, the festival technique is

the principal public entertainment for the urban middle 
and working classes. 
During 1958 Sino-Soviet Bloc attempts at economic 
penetration in Latin America increased, with emphasis 
focused on Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and, to a lesser 
extent, Chile. Elsewhere in Latin America bloc over-
tures met with limited response, and Cuban sugar sales 
to the bloc -- substantial in recent years -- declined 
sharply. The bloc trade offensive was carefully designed 
to exploit Latin America's need to dispose of surplus 
raw materials and to acquire petroleum products and 
capital goods for domestic industrial development. The 
bloc sold durables and petroleum to Argentina on a barter 
basis. The Soviet Union Isaugft a substantial part of 
the 1957-58 Uruguayan wool clip and suggested similar 
purchases from the current clip. However, in late 
November the U.S.S.R. suddenly dropped out of the 
Uruguayan wool market. Uruguay acquired fuel, cotton, 
and other important raw materials and semi-manufac?ures 
from the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe as dwindling exports 
to traditional markets caused a sharp drop in hard 
currency holdings. The bloc took advantage of Brazil's 
capital-deficit situation by offering developmental 
assistance and petroleum in exchange for coffee, cotton, 
cacao, and minerals. Chile sold a small quantity of 
copper wire in bloc markets, but failed to reach agree-
ment with the Communist Chinese for the sale of sizeable 
amounts of nitrates. 
Although trade with the bloc still accounts for 
only 1-2 percent of total Latin American world trade, 
receptivity to bloc offers is growing, as traditional 
markets and sources of financial assistance prove in-
adequate to satisfy mounting popular demands for rapid 
economic development. In a number of countries Soviet 
declaratinns of willingness to supply oil industry 
equipment appeals strongly to nationalistic elements 
opposed to foreign private exploitation of local 
petroleum resources. Bloc credit offers, on attractive 
terms, are especially tempting on purely economic 
grounds, and they set an unrealistic standard of "aid 
without strings" against which U.S. economic assistance 
may be measured. 
Soviet efforts to present the U.S.S.R. as a 
real alternative to dependence upon U.S. economic as-
sistance received signal support in November 1958 from

Brazilian official statements. In support of the thesis 
that U.S. economic aid to Latin America must be greatly 
increased, the Brazilian Foreign Office prepared a study 
purporting to show that in the absence of substantially 
expanded aid the Latin American economies will stagnate 
because western markets for their exports are limited. 
Significantly, the study accepted Soviet estimates of 
prospective income levels in the U.S.S.R., including 
per capita income levels higher than those in the U.S. 
by 1980, and concluded that Latin America would have to 
look to the bloc for expanded markets. This thesis was 
presented bluntly by the Brazilian D?legate to the Special 
Committee of the Council of the Organization of American 
States in a speech of November 25, and hinted at by 
President Kubitschek in a speech before the Brazilian 
National War College on November 26. It encountered 
wide criticism in major Brazilian, newspapers and by 
Church and military leaders, and no doubt will come under 
increasing fire in responsible government circles. Never-
theless, it has served to throw a mantle of respectability 
over the bloc campaign for retumption of diplomatic and 
formal trade relations, and doubtless has helped to 
raise public expectation of relief from a new quarter. 
THE NIXON VISIT 
The economic difficulties of Latin America that 
make for vulnerability to bloc trade approaches also 
provide the basis for a great deal of anti-U.S. senti-
ment which the local Communists have been able to exploit 
to their own advantage. Many responsible elements, and 
public opinion at large, tend to attribute the area's 
economic plight to the United States, blaming the United 
States for "neglecting" Latin America in favor of Asia 
and Africa in the apportionment of developmental loans. 
Friction over economic issues is re-enforced by political 
grievances -- chiefly alleged U.S. preference for 
dictatorial regimes and its long history of intervention 
in the area -- which tend to make Latin American audiences 
receptive to communist propaganda directed against 
"Yankee imperialism." 
The most striking demonstration of communist 
ability to capitalize on the latent anti-U.S. feelings 
occurred during the visit of Vice President Nixon to 
eight South American countries in April and May. The 
violent anti-Nixon riots in Lima and Caracas clearly

exceeded communist expectations and involved forces over 
whom the Communists exercise no direct control. Never-
theless, they served as a measure of the high degree of 
communist influence among student groups in those cities. 
It is significant that the Communists in all of the 
countries visited chose to use the universities as their 
forum for anti-Nixon protests rather than the labor 
unions, where their chief strength was generally 
believed to lie. 
The varied treatment accorded Nixon on his tour 
also revealed the limitations of communist capabilities 
and the absence of close coordination 'among.-. the Latin 
American 6ommunist parties. There were no indications 
of advance planning of communist-inspired incidents 
prior to the trip, and only in Peru was there evidence 
that Communists outside the country had hat any role in 
arranging the anti-Nixon demonstrations. The lack of 
an advance plan to disrupt the Nixon trip is suggested 
by the fact that his reception was mild in the first 
countries he visited -- Uruguay and Argentina, which 
have highly effective tommunist organizations. The 
inability of the Communists in Paraguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, 
and Colombia to provoke serious disturbances during 
Nixon's stay in those countries reflected poor organ-
ization, thorough police security precautions, com-
munist unwillingness to risk an open show of force, and 
the absence of an immediately explosive issue that could 
be directed against the United States. 
The anti-Nixon incidents and the absence of strong 
counter-measures by the host governments provided a 
great psychological boost to the Communists throughout 
Latin America and emboldened them to boast that future 
official U.S. travelers in the area would not escape 
unscathed. However, subsequent developments -- i.e., 
the uneventful visits of Presidential Envoy Milton 
Eisenhower to Central America in July and of Secretary 
of State Dulles to Brazil in August -- demonstrated that 
communist strength had been considerably overrated by 
most of the Latin American governments and by the Com-
munists themselves. In the anti-Nixon demonstrations 
the Latin American Communists proved their ability to 
direct mob action against the United States when all 
of the essential ingredients are present in the situation. 
Yet, they continue to lack the capability to generate 
by themselves the atmosphere in which anti-U.S. mob 
action can be fomented.

Communists in much of the area gained greater 
freedom of action, reflecting both the growing prestige 
of the U.S.S.R. and the continued trend toward a return 
to more liberal politics in Latin America. In the past 
thirteen months this trend has been particularly ap-
parent in Chile, Colombia, and Venezuela, where the Com-
munist parties were legaaized. In the two latter 
countries the Communists acquired legal status in the 
course of the overthrow of authoritarian regimes and the 
return to constitutional, representative rule. The 
December 1957 national plebiscite in Colombia annulled . 
the 1956 law outlawing the FCC in a blanket repeal of all 
constitutional amendments passed under the Rojas adminis-
tration. In Venezuela the PCV was accorded de facto legal 
standing as a result of its active participation in the 
revolt which deposed the Perez regime in January. The 
status of the PCV was clarified further by its inclusion 
as one of the parties recognized in the May 1958 electoral 
law, although no specific action was taken to invalidate 
previous anticommunist legislation. In August the out-
going Ibanez administration used growing popular pressure 
as an excuse to revoke the 1948 Law for the Permanent 
Defense of Democracy under which Chilean Communists had 
been denied the franchise. The timing of the repeal of 
the anticommunist law suggests that the action was taken 
in an effort to assure the election of the 'dommunist-
backed presidential candidate, Salvador Allende,

There is no question that the most spectacular 
gains in size and influence made by any Latin American 
tommunist organization in 1958 were registered by the 
Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV). Within the past 
year the PCV was transformed from a clandestine protest 
group into the most vociferous and fastest-growing legal 
:communist party in the Western Hemisphere. This remark-
able change was due in part to the efforts of the 
Venezuelan Communists themselves, but it was the result 
even more of a highly favorable combination of circum-
stances beyond their control. Members of the PCV played 
an impressive role in the popular uprising which toppled 
the Perez Jimenez administration on January 23. For 
several months prior to the revolt the PCV had been 
represented on the clandestine Junta Patriotica, which 
organized and directed civilian opposition to the regime. 
Communists were in the vanguard when the violence 
erupted and were recognized among the heroes of the

revolution by the noncommunist political groups. In the 
ensuing months PCV propaganda exploited this factor to 
the full. 
Of greater significance, however, was the political 
climate which prevailed in the general reaction to the 
end of a decade of authoritarian, military rule. The 
civilian political forces that had made the revolution 
were primarily concerned to prevent a resurgence of 
military rule and unanimously regarded the armed forces 
as the most immediate and powerful threat to the establish-
ment of a civilian regime. Under the circumstances, unity 
of the major political parties was regarded as indispensable, 
and an attack on one was considered as an attack on all. 
Moreover, in a situation in which the general strike and 
mob action were believed to be the only deterrents to a 
military coup, the noncommunists were unwilling to sacrifice 
the PCV's demonstrated capacity to organize mass demon-
strations. Collaboration with the PCV was fScilitated 
somewhat by the fact that the important noncommunist 
parties -- Accion Democratica, COPEI, and Union Republicana  
Democrata -- were all ideologically left-of-center and 
favored reforms which differed only in degree from those 
advocated by the Communists. Even those noncommunists 
who might habe preferred, dn ideological grounds or for 
reasons of 1A.actica1 politics, to minimize cooperation 
with the PCV insisted upon the restoration of.full civil 
rights and freedom of political expression and activity 
for all groups. The fact that many of the top PCV command 
were from wealthy Venezuelan families and had close ties 
with prominent noncommunists undoubtedly contributed to 
the favorable atmosphere in which the Communists were 
permitted to operate. PCV leaders such as Gustavo Machado 
Morales and Ernesto Silva Telleria were regarded locally 
as Venezuelans who could not possibly be subservient to 
a foreign power or political movement. 
The resurgence of the PCV again demonstrated the 
durability and recuperative power of communist underground

growth of communist influence in these sectors stemmed 
in large part from the personal abilities and strategic 
positions held by individual communist agents. For 
example, in the labor field a significant number of Com-
munists who had cooperated with the Perez Jimenez regime 
were already installed in key unions in the petroleum 
fields and in the Caracas area. Moreover, such capable 
labor organizers as Rodolfo Quintero, who returned from 
exile to represent the PCV on the newly-formed central 
labor committee (CSU), and Jesus Feria, who had been 
jailed by the former administration, commanded wide respect 
and popularity among the working class. A comparable 
situation prevailed in press and student circles, which 
were strongly influenced by Communists Hector Mujica, 
Dean of the Central University School of Journalism, and 
Carlos Augusto Leon, poet, journalist, and national 
coordinator of secondary schools and study centers.

guaranteed minority representation in the future congress.

of living costs, and labor unity -- closely resembled

time should avoid ties with either free world or communist 
international labor organizations. The PCV conducted a 
mild campaign for the resumption of diplomatic relations 
with the Soviet Bloc, but did not launch a vigorous 
drive for that purpose. The PCV, unlike other communist 
parties in the area, was unable to exploit the line that 
trade with the bloc offers a ready solution to Venezuela's 
economic problems. 
When the results of the election are measured 
against communist expectations, it may be said that the 
PCV suffered a serious setback. 
PCV SUPPORT AT Over 90 percent of the electorate, 
THE POLLS nearly 2.7 million persons, went 
to the polls, so it is unlikely 
that any significant number of 
Communists or sympathizers failed to vote. Yet, Junta 
President Larrazabal, to whom the Communists threw their 
support, was decisively defeated and the party failed to 
acilieve its hoped-for balance of power position in the 
congress. Moreover, nearly half of those who supported 
PCV congressional candidates were unwilling to follow 
party directives in the presidential balloting. The PCV 
polled 160,791 votes, or 6.2 percent, of the total valid 
count for congress as opposed to 84,451 or 3.2 percent, 
of the valid ballots cast in the presidential contest. 
Nevertheless, the PCV showing in the congressional 
race reveals spectacular absolute growth in communist 
strength since January and indicates that theiparty's 
influence over the electorate is higher than it has ever 
been in the past. During the previous period of party 
legality, in the elections of 1946 and 1947, the Com-
munists polled only about 50,Q00 votes, or less than five 
percent of the total, to elec-e.one senator and three 
congressmen. Subsequent population growth and the en-
franchisement of women enlar_ged the electorate by two 
and one-half times by 1958. In the same period the PCV 
vote more than tripled, and the party placed at least 
two senators and seven congressmen, as well as four 
members of the Caracas municipal council. A number of 
Communists may also be placed in the state and municipal 
legislatures in five other urban areas where PCV 
strength is concentrated. The most striking communist 
showing occurred in the Federal District, where the 
PCV ran second, polling over 70,000 votes for 17 percent 
of the total. Nowhere else in Latin America have the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
CONFIDENTIAL 
138 
Communists in recent years displayed comparable ability 
to attract such a substantial percentage of the elector-
ate. 
The split in communist ballots is probably a 
reflection of the intense campaign directed by the Church 
against PCV endorsement of Larrazabal. Since the Church 
concentrated its fire against PCV participation in the 
presidential contest and did not specifically single out 
PCV congressional candidates for attack, it appears that 
a great many communist sympathizers drew a legalistic 
distinction, voting for the PCV congressional slate while 
either abstaining in the presidential race or casting 
their ballots for Larrazabal on another party ticket. The 
Communists claim that the 84,451 PCV votes for Larrazabal 
represent hardcore party membership. While this claim 
is undoubtedly inflated, it provides a measure of communist 
strength in Venezuela. Up to half of the figure may well 
represent the ballots of sympathizers and rdommunist youth 
members of eighteen years or older who were entitled to 
vote. In any event it is apparent that PCV membership 
is now on the order of 40,000-50,000 persons, as opposed 
to less than 10,000 in January. The heavy concentration 
of communist strength in the Caracas area, where over 
half of the PCV congressional vote was cast, should en-
courage the Communists to attempt to exert even greater 
pressure on the government than their national member-
ship would warrant. 
CHILE 
The Chilean Communist Party (PCCh) also registered 
impressive gains in respectability and voting power during 
1958. The successful culmination of its sustained two-
year drive to re-acquire legal status -- which encouraged 
five congessmen elected on other party tickets to 
identify themselves as Communists -- was nearly over-
shadowed by the strong showing of the party in the 
September presidential election. Even before the party 
was legalized in August, the PCCh was playing a vital 
role in the electoral campaign, enlisting popular support 
for Socialist Salvador Allende, candidate of the Communist-
Socialist Popular Action Front (FRAP). In the five-Way 
race, Allende polled 29 percent of the 1,200,000 votes 
cast, losing to right-wing candidate Alessandri by only 
30,000 votes. Although the election had been hailed as 
a defeat for the Communists, the PCCh regarded it as a

moral victory, for the total vote for left-of-center candi-
dates far surpassed the vote for Alessandri. Moreover, 
a significant number of people from the lower class, who 
have never taken a direct part in national politics, did 
not vote in the elections. The Communists are currently 
engaged in a vigorous campaign to persuade this bloc of 
potentially procommunist voters to register for the 
forthcoming municipal elections, in which the PCCh will 
be able to present candidates on its own ticket for the 
first time in more than a decade. 
The party's newly-won respectability was prominently 
displayed at the Eleventh National Congress of the PCCh, 
held in Santiago in November. The opening session of the 
congress, the first publicly held congress in Chile in 
eleven years, met in the main salon of the Chilean Parlia-
ment, and the keynote speech was broadcast over the radio. 
The major purpose of the congress was to confirm the 
election of Luis Corvalan as Secretary General to replace 
the deceased Gab o Gonzalez, and to provide a public 
demonstration of the party's new strength and confidence. 
No major changes in strategy or tactics were adopted. 
BRAZIL 
The situation in Brazil during 1958 served to point 
up the fact that an improved climate for Soviet Bloc 
objectives does not necessarily benefit the local com-
munist organization. As indicated above, receptivity to 
SovietsBloc trade overtures increased noticeably during 
the year. Nevertheless, the Communist Party of Brazil 
(PCB) -- once by far the largest in the Western Hemisphere --
continued to decline in following and effectiveness despite 
the opportunity provided by congressional and state 
elections for the Communists to exploit worsening economic 
conditions and heightened social tensions. The inability 
of the PCB to hold its popular following was revealed in 
the steady drop in the circulation of the communist press, 
the closing of its major daily, Imprensa Popular, and the 
postponement of the party's long-scheduled Fifth National 
.1:ongress. The weakness of the PCB appears to arise from 
popular disillusionment with communist leadership and a 
drifting away of party members rather than from an ef-
fective anticommunist campaign. In fact, neither the 
dissident communist wing, which split from the PCB in 
1957, nor the professional anticommunists have succeeded 
in arousing popular sentiment against the PCB. Moreover, 
CONFIDENTIAL 
?

140 
since late in 1957 party leaders, who successfully 
challenged longstanding court charges against them, have 
enjoyed almost unlimited freedom to agitate openly as 
Communists for popular support. The Pasternak affair 
late in the year, which provoked serious criticism from 
such PCB intellectuals as novelist Jorge Amada, also 
served to stir up dissension in communist ranks, but 
the decline of the PCB had set in much earlier. It is 
difficult to determine the size of the current PCB 
following, but there is no doubt that the party now has 
fewer adherents than it did a year ago, and it may well 
have dropped below the Communist Party of Venezuela in 
numbers as well as in effectiveness. 
Probably the greatest disappointment to the Brazilian 
Communists in 1958 was the absence of popular enthusiasm 
displayed toward party chief Luiz 
ECLIPSE OF Carlos Prestes, who emerged in March 
PRESTES after a decade of underground activity. 
For many years the PCB had been 
exploiting the legend of Prestes as 
the Knight of Hope, a sobriquet he earned as a revolu-
tionary leader in the 1920's and as a prisoner of the 
Vargas dictatorship 1936-1945. In the immediate postwar 
period Prestes' popularity was widespread, and his 
return to underground activities in 1947 served to 
perpetuate his reputation as a popular hero for a time. 
Following the split in the PCB in mid-1957, the party 
leadership decided that Prestes would be of greater value 
to the PCB as an overt political leader, and an intense 
propaganda campaign was launched to generate a popular 
demand for his return to public life. This campaign, 
which appealed to the strong Brazilian belief in civil 
liberties, succeeded in March when an arrest order 
against him was revoked. Prestes immediately began to 
play an active role in the developing electoral campaign, 
endorsing ultranationalistic candidates on a number of 
noncommunist party tickets and arranging thinly-veiled 
alliances between the PCB and other parties. A majority 
of these alliances were with Vice President Goulart's 
Labor Party. For a few weeks large crowds were drawn 
to ,tommunist-nationalist political rallies, but Well 
before the October elections public curiosity about 
Prestes had dissipated.

THE POLLS in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, which 
the PCB had chosen for a show of 
strength. These defeats clearly 
demonstrated for the first time that communist support is 
not essential for victory in a close contest. As a 
result, prospects for the communist campaign to regain 
legal status were appreciably dimmed. 
Even though the electoral defeat came as a blow 
to communist morale, it was probably more psychological 
than real. While few known Communists were elected to 
public office, it is likely that the newly-elected legis-
latures at the national, state, and municipal levels will 
include more spokesmen for the communist cause than did 
the outgoing legislatures. In Sao Paulo, of 62 communist-
supported candidates, five were elected to the congress 
and eight to the state assembly, while eleven and three, 
respectiely, won positions as alternates. In the 
Fedenal District PCB member Licio Hauer and communist-
backed Waldir Simoes were elected to congress on the 
Labor Party ticket, and two other communist-endorsed 
candidates qualified as second and third alternates on 
the same list. It is almost certain that many such 
alternates will appear in the congress and in the various 
state legislatures in the coming four years. 
There are further indications that the communist 
position in Brazil may improve in the near future. 
Despite communist reverses in key areas, Labor Party 
leaders appear to plan continued collaboration with the 
PCB. Vice President Goulart, who controls the labor 
ministry, has reportedly decided to meet communist 
demands for trade union positions and patronage in 
exchange for political support. The combination of 
assistance from Goulart and continuing economic problems 
facing the country provides ample opportunity for the 
PCB to enhance its influence among Brazilian workers.

OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES

Elsewhere in Latin America the Communists general-
ly displayed limited political strength in the national 
elections held during 1958. The 
ARGENTINA Argentine Communist Party (PCA) 
remained easily the largest communist 
organization in Latin America and 
probably increased its membership slightly during the 
year. The PCA supported the successful Frondizi candi-
dacy in February, but failed to place a single candidate 
in national or provincial office because of the peculi-
arity of the Argentine electoral law which denies seats 
to all but the two leadingparties in each province. Even 
at ,the municipal level, where proportional representation 
prevails, the PCA placed only 17 candidates in the entire 
country. The Communists concentrated their efforts on 
the labor movement, where they sought to benefit from the 
administration's attempt to win trade union support. 
During the past few months, however, relations between the 
government and the Communists have coaled considerably, 
particularly as a result of the exposure of the inter-
national communist training school in Buenos Aires in 
September, and Frondizi's denunciation of the PCA for 
labor strikes in November. 
In Uruguay the Communist Party is obviously main-
tained in large part by support from Soviet Bloc diplo-
matic missions and expresses its 
URUGUAY dependent status through close 
identification with Soviet communism.

In Bolivia the communist movement, badly split by 
factionalism and weakened by its inability to find a 
suitable issue on which to attack the 
BOLIVIA administration and the United States, 
0 failed to register gains in the July 
congressional elections. However, 
in the latter part of the year the Communists found an 
appealing cause in the "defense" of the state petroleum 
corporation (YPFB) against "Yankee trusts," and demon-
strated that they still command a highly effective 
propaganda apparatus when there is a popular issue to 
exploit. Popularity of U.S. grant aid to Bolivia had 
previously inhibited the Communists from effectively 
attacking the United States, except by exploiting the 
slowly growing dissatisfaction over the inability of 
YPFB, in collaboration with private1U.S. oil companies, 
to increase Bolivian oil production. The Communists 
launched a vigorous anti-U.S. campaign with a "factual" 
and effectively-written book on the oil question which 
purported to show that the United States had extended 
grant aid to Bolivia in order to strangle YPFB. This 
book,and a rumored Soviet Bloc offer of financial and 
technical assistance for petroleum development no doubt 
helped to crystallize anti-US. sentiment among both 
right- and left-wing elements. By the end of the year 
even the Catholic press was giving space to communist' 
line and nationalist propaganda demanding a drastic 
revision of the petroleum code to exclude foreign oil 
companies and to empower YPFB to accept Soviet Bloc aid.

Thee groups concentrated their energies on the labor 
movement, substantially improving their position in 
the unions of miners, railroad workers, and teachers, 
where the established leadership had become too closely 
identified with the regime. In Guatemala the Communists 
suffered a setback with the election of President Ydigoras 
in January, and have had little success thus far in their 
attempts to infiltrate and take over the left-wing 
Revolutionary Party. The Salvadoran Communists appear 
to have enjoyed somewhat greater freedom to operate in 
the labor movement in 1958, but they continued to be 
ineffectual in national politics. The communist Popular 
Vanguard Party in Costa Rica, which had been handicapped 
by the reformist policies of the Figueres regime, gained 
increased freedom of action in domestic affairs. They 
supported the successful congressional campaign of the 
Calderonista party in February and were permitted public-
ly to back the new administration's drive to nationalize 
the electric power industry. Nevertheless, the Echandi 
regime has acted to limit opportunities for contact 
between the Popular Vanguard Party and foreign communist 
organizations. 
In Cuba the Communists appear to have sacrifi'ped 
opportunities to attract a popular following by avoiding 
identification with either faction

they sought, without fanfare and 
apparently with only limited success, 
to penetrate the rebel forces led by Fidel Castro, in 
order to be in a favorable position in the event of a 
rebel victory. They exerted no measurable influence in 
the November presidential elections. Communist tactics 
appear to have been dictated by the fact that under 
Batista they controlled a number of second-tier positions 
in the labor movement. They-were unwilling to sacrifice 
those positions, from which they apparently expected to 
be able to seize control of the entire labor movement 
when the regime fell.

where they will be in a position to resume party 
activities when the situation permits. In Honduras 
reformists of all shades have been encouraged by the 
policies of the Villeda regime which emphasize civil 
liberties and rapid economic development. There are 
no clear indications that the government favors com-
munist solutions to pressing socio-economic problems. 
Nevertheless, the fact that Villeda and a number of 
individuals in strategic positions in his government 
are former members of the Honduran Revolutionary Demo-
cratic Party (PDRH), composed of exiles in Guatemala 
during the Arbenz regime, may reveal a degree of 
tolerance for communism that will permit the PCH to 
exert increasing influence on the regime. 
THE PASTERNAK AFFAIR 
The Pasternak affair was unquestionably the most 
painful psychological blow to the Latin American Com-
munists since the 1956 Hungarian revolt. In intellectual 
circles it promises to be even more damaging to the com-
munist cause, for it focused attention on the lack of 
freedom for the individual artist that is so highly 
valued in Latin America. The issue captured the 
imagination of intellectuals and press writers who were 
overwhelmingly repelled by the Soviet Union's refusal 
to allow Pasternak to accept the Nobel Prize. Through-
out the area criticism was levelled against the re-
strictions placed on intellectual activity in the Soviet 
Union. Possibly the most damning attack came from 
Brazilian Communist Jorge Amado, outstanding novelist 
and Stalin Prize winner, who said, "Pasternak's expulsion 
from the Union of Soviet Writers demonstrates the fact 
that the schematic, sectarian, and dogmatic elements 
still dominate in the Soviet Union, attempting to 
impede literary creation and to impose a single school 
of thought, just as in Stalin's era." The perplexity 
facing those communist artists who conformed to the 
party line was illustrated by Chilean Communist and 
poet Pablo Neruda, who reacted first as an intellectual, 
expressing pleasure that the Nobel committee had 
broken its tradition of discrimination against Soviet 
writers and denouncing the "stupidity" of the Soviet 
wkiters' union. Neruda subsequently, however, accepted 
the communist position and publicly defended the Soviet 
Union's right to reject any threat to the socialist 
world. A number of lesser Latin American communist

artists were also quoted as "sad" and "perplexed" over 
the Soviet Union's disapprobation of Pasternak. Few, 
if any, Communists have actually broken with the movement 
because of the Pasternak affair, but in several countries 
disaffection in procommunist literary circles has been 
pronounced and is continuing. 
Developments throughout Latin America during 1958 
reveal some practical gains for the communist movement 
in its campaign to acquire political influence and freedom 
of action, and even greater psychological gains in prestige, 
respectability, and self-confidence. The fact that com-
munist influence over the electorate was still inadequate 
to determine the outcome of national elections is less 
significant than the growing confidence among Communists 
that their position is improving. Even the Pasternak af-
fair, which may continue to embarrass them in intellectual 
circles, is unlikely to have serious repercussions among 
the masses, and in any case cannot begin to compare with 
the lift they received from the anti-Nixon riots. It may 
be anticipated that in a spirit of renewed self-confidence 
the Communists will prove more effective in exacerbating 
popular demands for socio-economic reforms beyond the 
present capacity of the Latin American governments, and 
thus in serving as a major irritant in U.S.-Latin American 
relations.

VIII. SPECIAL ARTICLE: EAST GERMANY 
During 1958, the Socialist Unity Party (SED) of 
the Soviet Zone of Germany accelerated its evolution 
into the most effective single instrument of Soviet 
policy in Germany, replacing Soviet organizations in 
almost all major areas. Domestically, it displayed 
greater decisiveness and versatility in its continuing ) 
campaign to transform the social, political, economic 
and cultural habits of the population of the Soviet Zone. 
Abroad, it sought to be in the forefront of all satellite 
parties in undeviating loyalty to the undertakings of the 
U.S.S.R. within the Soviet Bloc itself, in the under-
developed areas of Africa and Asia and, most importantly, 
in the Soviet political offensive in Europe against the 
Western Allies and NATO. 
4 
Despite its own achievements, the most dramatic 
single event of 1958 involving Germany did not occur on 
SED but rather on Soviet initiative. This was Soviet 
Prime Minister Khrushchev's proposal of November 27, 1958 
to the Western Allies for the "abolition" of the quadri-
partite character of Berlin, the concomitant liquidation 
of Western Allied rights in the city and the creation of, 
a "fre0,, demilitarized" West Berlin. The SED, to whom 
the existence of West Berlin has always been a "thorn in 
the flesh,'! has of course enthusiastically supported this 
U.S.S.R. proposal. If Khrushchev's offensive succeeds in 
any form, the SED would be obviously a major beneficiary. 
The Party has therefore directed its propaganda, since 
then almost exclusively to the two themes of the "free 
city" of Berlin and of the danger to world peace should 
the Federal Republic's NATO forces acquire missiles and 
atomic war heads. 
The focussing of public attention on the magnitude 
of the current Soviet threat to Western security has, 
of course, reemphasized the disparity between Soviet and 
SED power in East Germany and demonstrated how much the 
SED is still only an instrument of Soviet policy. This 
obvious fact should not, however, obscure the additional 
reality that the SED, even though ultimately dependent 
on Soviet power, has gradually acquired an identity and 
considerable resources of its own. Khrushchev might not 
even have been able to launch his current offensive with

its specific threat to the Western position in Germany 
as a whole, had not the SED previously achieved signifi-
cant gains of its own in East Germany. 
Some measure of SED internal strength and capa-
bility is indicated by the number of complex and 
comprehensive programs which the 
THE REGIME'S party carried on during 1958. These 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS included a reorganization of the 
party apparatus; major changes in the 
structure of the government, especially 
in the previously highly centralized ministries; a de-
centralization of the financial, industrial and commercial 
institutions of the Soviet Zone; the reorganization and 
re-equipping of the mikAary forces, the expansion of 
military and paramilitary reserves, and the subordination 
of both to a new SED control mechanism; the expansion of 
polytechnical education into the entire school system; and 
the intensive drive against "revisionist" and "bourgeois" 
tendencies at the universities and in cultural and intel-
lectual ppoductions. ,In the religious field, the SED 
achieved several succ4ises: the population has on the 
whole complied with the 'communist "youth dedication" 
ceremony designed to replace religious confirmation, 
and the SED has been able to bring about the resignation 
of the Protestant Liaison Officer (resident in West 
Berlin) of the all-German Evangelische Kirche in 
Deutschland. The regime also abolished rationing, 
lowered prices on a wide variety of consumer goods, 
reversed other inflationary tendencies in the economy, 
expanded its role in the export offensive of the Soviet 
bloc in underdeveloped areas and, in general, inaugu-
rated with great energy a program to overtake West Germany 
in per capita production (not necessarily consumption) 
of consumer goods between 1961 and 1965. 
The event which most significantly marked the 
SED's progress during 1958 was the Fifth Party Congress, 
which met July 10-16. On the one 
PURGE, IDEOLOGICAL hand, this event initiated the East 
PURITY, AND German offensive to match West 
SOCIALIZATION Germany's economic gains; on the 
other hand, it marked the conclusion 
of six months of intensive party 
reorganization following, the demotion, on February 6, 
1958, of two Politburo members, Karl Schirdewan and 
Fred Oelssner, and Central Commitee member and former

149 
Minister for State Security, Ernst Wonweber. Schirdewan, 
who had been First Secretary Walter Ulbricht's most 
prominent assistant, was accused, with Wollweber, of 
"factionalism"; Oelssner, the party's leading ideologist, 
was disciplined for "failing to identify himself with 
the decisions of the Politburo." The purge which 
followed the announcement of these demotions resulted in 
the reassignment, between February 10 and June 30, of 
almost 10,000 intermediate and subordinate party function-
aries. Coincidentally, the relationship between political 
chiefs and party components within the military establish-
ment, as well as the relationship of both to the military 
commanders, was altered. The political chief of each 
military unit was taken out from under control of the 
militapy commander and made responsible instead to the 
political chief of the next higher echelon. In order 
to prevent the political chiefs from acquiring top much 
personal power, however, they were relieved of their 
former authority over the political directorates and 
party units at every military level. The political 
directorates at each military echelon, no longer responsi-
ble to the political chiefs of their units, were in turn 
made answerable to the political directorates of the next 
higher military echelons. The highest political chiefs 
and the highest political directorates were now made 
separately responsible to the Political Administration 
of the Peoples' National Army. This organization is, 
through Politburo member Willi Stoph, nominally under 
the direct supervision of the Central Committee of the 
SED. Actually, Stoph answers, as do Ulbricht and Matern, 
ultimately only to Moscow. 
The magnitude of the assault the U.S.S.R. was 
planning to launch during 1958 from East Germany against 
the Western Allied position in Europe was revealed in 
greatest detail between November 10, when Khrushchev 
first indicated his desire to "abrogate" the quadri-
partite status of Berlin, and November 27, when he 
despatched his note regarding Berlin to the three Western 
Allies. That Khrushchev had selected East Germany to 
become the main area in Europe from which to join his 
battle of economics and diplomacy against the West was 
apparent, however, already at the time of the Fifth 
Party Congress, when he addressed the SED as its principal 
guest speaker. 
As depicted then by Khrushchev, and echoed by 
Ulbricht, the SED was emerging as the major central

European collaborator of the U.S.S.R. in a political, 
economic, and social program designed to destroy 
Adenauer's West Germany and eventually to incorporate 
it in an atomically neutral, confederated Germany. Even 
before the Congress, Khrushchev had promised Ulbricht 
that during the next few years the U.S.S.R. would sub-
sidize the SED with as much aid as it could absorb. At 
the Congress he publicly stated the same. To this end, 
Soviet troop support charges which during 1958 amounted 
to DME 600,000,000 (more than $150,000,000 at official 
rates) were also to be abolished effective January 1, 
1959. The rate of U.S.S.R. assistance, according to 
Khrushchev, was to be greatest during 1959-60 in order 
to ensure that the standard of living in East Germany, 
and particularly in East Berlin, would improve signifi-
cantly by the erid of 1961. By that date the issue of 
the contrast between the living standards in the two 
Germanies would have been eliminated. Thereafter, the 
competition between the two German states for primacy 
would be on political, ideological, and psychological 
but not on economic grounds. 
In dOmmenting on this announced economic program, 
Ulbricht, with Khrushchev repeatedly nodding public 
assent, resorted again and again to the theme that the 
"GDR stands in the forefront of the socialist camp, at 
the exposed main fighting line between the two world 
systems in Europe. Socialism and capitalism stand face 
to face on German soil." Precisely because of this 
strategic location, the GDR had to assume major roles 
simultaneously not only within the Soviet satellite 
world and its CEMA-Warsaw Pact system, but vis-a-vis 
West Germany and the NATO alliance as well. These 
roles necessarily involved the SED in ideological, 
political, economic, social and cultural issues the 
successful formulation and solution of which -were' bound 
to have significance beyond the borders of Germany. 
Ideologically, the doctrine stressed most at 
the congress, and applied rigorously since then, was 
the reaffirmation of the unity of the communist world, 
involving the corollary concept of the primacy of the 
U.S.S.R., whose experiences and needs provided both 
the example and the program by which "socialism" was 
to be achieved in all countries. Although local 
national conditions obviously had an influence on 
socialist" development, the many "separate roads to 
socialism" could hot meaningfully lead away from the

U.S.S.R. but only toward it. "Modern revisionism," 
which had become primarily an expression.of "national 
socialism and national communism," served, therefore, 
in view of the existence of NATO, only "to smooth the 
path of counterrevolution in the people's democracies. 
If tolerated, "modern revisionism" would lead to the 
destruction not only of international communist but 
ultimately even of so-called national communist societies 
as well. This was the lesson, the congress decided, 
which Tito should have learned from the events in Hungary; 
this lesson was applied rigorously in East Germany during 
the remainder of 1958. 
As Ulbricht pointed out at the congress, the 
struggle against "revisionism" in East Germany during 
1956-57 had been more involved and complex than elsewhere 
because the goals of the SED included not only the 
consolidation of "socialism" in its own territory, as was 
the ease with the other peoples' democracies, but also 
the provision of an attraction to the bourgeois and 
proletarian elements in West Germany. The requirements 
of this latter task had in the past led some SED circles 
(represented by Schirdewan, Oelssner, Wollweber, Ziller, 
Vieweg) to seek to transcend the essential character of 
the "class struggle" and to evolve doctrines, not of 
Titoist revisionism, which is founded on ideological 
differences with Marxism-Leninism, but of a special 
pragmatic revisionism developed out of a preoccupation 
with the peculiar situation confronting the SED as a 
result of its dual role in a divided Germany. To these 
circles, the task of rigorously socializing East Germany 
had seemed to conflict with the other equally important 
goal Agarding the reunification of Germany in a "demo-
cratic social order." They felt the tempo of socializa-
tion should be decelerated in order to accelerate the 
tempo of reunification. The advocates of these views, 
although at times resorting to such dubious ideological 
expressions as the '"spontaneous evolution of socialism," 
may not have sought to evolve a new doctrine of revision-
ism; nevertheless, they had disturbed the internal 
harmony of the party by generalizing their wrong assess-
ments of the factual state of world affairs in incorrect 
formulations, leading to factional activity which 
violated the principle of "democratic centralism." 
According to Ulbrichttp the SED had met this danger 
successfully in the purge of late 1957 and early 1958, 
the most important feature of which was the elimination 
from the Politburo and Secretariat, on February 6, 1958,

of Schirdewan and Oelssner, and the dismissal of Wollweber 
from the Central Committee, The Party, as Ulbricht 
predicted it would be, was more unified as a result during 
the rest of 1958 than ever before in its history. 
On the basis of the SED's analysis of its dual 
role in German; and European history, Ulbricht announced 
further that the socialization of East Germany need not 
and would not be sacrificed to the cause of German re-
unification. "The tempo for achieving the reunification 
of Germany depends, in fact, directly upon the tempo of 
building socialism in the German Democratic Republic." 
It would be, moreover, only the earliest achievement of 
socialism" in East Germany which would guarantee that 
a "reunified confederated Germany" did not evolve in a 
way leading to the ul;timate destruction of the SED and 
of the "social achievements of the workers' and peasants' 
state." 
This thesis, which was pronounced by Ulbricht with 
conviction and accepted with enthusiasm by the congress, 
has been the basis of all subsequent 
CHANGE IN U.S.S.R.- economic and political development in 
GDR RELATIONSHIPS East Germany during 1958. The fact 
that the SED would be willing to proceed 
with such a program, despite repeated 
experiences in the past that accelerated socialization 
invariably resulted in lowered production, was due to the 
profound change in U.S.S.R.-GDR relations which began 
with Khrushchev's visit to East Germany in the summer of 
1957. This change, the impact of which reportedly would 
be greatest during 1959-60, involved the transformation 
of the Soviet Zone from an area primarily of U.S.S.R. 
economic and political exploitation to one of joint U.S.S.R. 
GDR cooperation. The economic plans presented at the 
congress, whj=ch. ax'o 
could take place only on the basis of major U.S.S.R. 
economic concessions and investments. In brief, the 
socialization as well as the economic expansion of the 
Soviet Zone had to be and was being underwritten by the 
U.S.S.R. as a part of the political battle for the 
neutralization of all of Germany. As a result, in 
1959-60, the increase in the production of the chemical, 
metal-processing, and light industries alone would exceed 
original plans by more than DM 6 billion (U.S. $2.7 
billion at official rates of exchange). Commensurate 
increases would be shown in agricultural production and 
in the construction of living quarters, of which 750,000 
were scheduled to be produced by 1965.

the SED, reinforced by the U.S.S.R. 
by Khrushchev in November against 
the Western Allied position in 
Berlin, and on the basis of the 
PROSPECT earlier decisions announced at the 
Fifth Party Congress, July 10-16, 
appears to have emerged from the 
serious ideological and other failings of 1956-57 with 
remarkable vigor and cohesiveness. The party is 
dominated completely by Ulbricht, who has a comprehensive 
grasp of the intellectual and organizational problems 
with which it is confronted. Because of the essential 
change in the relations between ?the GDR and the U.S.S.R., 
which began in mid-1957 after Khrushchev's visit to East 
Germany, the SED expects to play an essential role in 
both the diplomatic and economic offensives which Khrushchev 
has launched against the West in Europe. It estimates 
that the entire German question is now in the central 
focus of U.S.S.R. foreign policy. Because Berlin is 
geographically surrounded by GDR territory, the SED 
believes that the "Berlin problem" is the most effective 
instrument available to the U.S.S.R. for forcing the 
issue into channels favorable to itself and that the 
instrument of this coercion lies in SED hands. Under 
these circumstances, East Germany and the SED are of 
utmost immediate importance to the U.S.S.R. Consequently, 
the GDR anticipates receiving a volume of credits and 
other economic assistance from the U.S.S.R. during 1959-60 
sufficient to enable it not only to continue the social-
ization of agriculture, handicrafts and the building 
industry, but also to expand production in all these 
branches. Industrial output in 1959-60, as a result 
of the supply of U.S.S.R. and Soviet Bloc raw materials, 
is expected to increase by more than DM (East) 6 billion 
(U.S. $2.7 billion, at official exchange rates). On 
the social and cultural front, the party will seek to 
intensify the indoctrination of both its own and the 
West German and West Berlin populations; in the Soviet 
Zone, flpolytechnical" education will be the principal 
means used with the younger generation. The party is 
confident that, given its recent internal reorganizations 
and Soviet economic and moral support, it will, in the 
not too distant future, render totally impotent, even 
if it cannot eliminate, the fundamental hostility of its 
own population; and that, on the basis of this achieve-
ment, it will ultimately defeat the West German Govern-
ment in the contest for Germany.
