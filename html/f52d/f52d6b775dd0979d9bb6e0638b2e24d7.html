 UNGA  SESSION
 TENG SPEECH CONFIRMS PRC ACTIVIST, OPEN FOREIGN POLICY
 Teng Hsia.o-ping's 10 April. speech to the UNGA special session
 provided a new and broader framework for Peking's claim of
 kinship with developing countries while reaffirming that Peking
 is not turning away from its recent closer relations with the
 Went.  Teng also affirmed that the current PRC anti-Confucius
 ideological campaign will not cause a retreat from the international
 scene--as did the cultural revolution--but that it will instead
 serve to maintain the revolutionary activism of. PRC foreign policy
 during the current favorable period of "great disorder under heaven."
 Both the United States and the USSR come under attack as superpowers
 bullying the smaller countries, but Teng continued the recent PRC
 practice of treating the USSR in far harsher terms.
 In noting the "drastic division and realinement" in the world, Teng
 referred to the breakup of the "socialist camp" and the disintegra-
 tion of the "Western imperialist bloc," recalling the thesis of
 the authoritative 1972 New Year's Day joint editorial which had
 stressed the regrouping of international forces to rationalize
 Peking's invitation to President Nixon and other moves in foreign
 relations.  Reiterating Peking's premise that U.S.-Soviet rivalry
 is irreconcilable--the paramount "contradiction" of the present
 age, and the chief cause of world disorder--Teng implicitly
 reaffirmed that Peking sees ample opportunities for continued
 Chinese maneuvering in the triangular relationship..
 The circumstances surrounding Teng's presence at the United Nations
 serve to underscore his address as a major statement of PRC foreign
 policy aims.  The speech is the first by a member of the PRC
 Politburo in a Western country since the cultural revolution.
 Peking also acted to present Teng as the envoy of a united PRC
 leadership, not a particular faction, by providing him with a
 high-level farewell ceremon'y in Peking, attendee by almost all
 active, Peking-based Politburo leaders.*
 PRC-THIRD WORLD     Teng carefully stuck to the framework of the
 SOLIDARITY          flexible Chouist foreign policy of recent
 years, stressing that the present situation
 is one in which "international relations are changing drastically,"
 but added the notion that international regrouping has new reached

 17 APRIL 1974
 the point where "three worlds" have been formed:  one consisting
 of the United States and the Soviet Union; one, made up of China
 and other developing states; and one representing developed
 states that sometimes oppress developing nations but which in
 turn are subject to oppression by one or both superpowers,
 Teng's groupings represent a departure from Peking's previous,
 longstanding  framework which held that China and its socialist
 allies were on one side, the imperialist powers led by the
 United States and the USSR were on the other, and between them
 lay two "intermediate zones":  one made up of developing,
 non-socialist third world states and the other of developed
 nations such as France that were opposed to superpower dominance.
 Peking had been moving gradually in the direction of Teng's
 view over the past few years, with spokesmen noting in particular
 the growing unity of the "small and medium-sized countries"
 against the superpowers.  Chou En-lai in his 24 August 1973
 report to the 10th CCP Congress called on world. nations to form
 the "broadest united front" against the superpowers.
 An effect of Teng's new division is to drop Peking's former
 insistance on socialist credentials for its close allies, and
 thereby open the way for more intimate Chinese unity with the
 entire third world.  In portraying an attractive image for the
 developing nations, Tang was at pains to demonstrate PRC solidarity
 with them and all oppressed nations and peoples, and to show China's
 determination not to become a superpower.  In this regard, Teng
 referred to the cultural revolution and to the current domes.1c
 campaign against Confucius and Lin Piao as designed in part to
 insure that Peking, while pursuing a greater role on the inter-
 national scene through flexible policies, will not lose its
 bearings as a socialist state committed to third ward interests.
 On issues of specific import to the developing nations at the
 session, Teng lauded the Arab use of the oil weapon during the
 Middle East waras a model for third world struggles and broadly
 supported moves to safeguard political independence and sovereignty
 over resources.  He took a more moderate stand than some speakers
 by avoiding a blanket call for nationalization, but asserting
 support for steps to control. fore:tgn influence "up to and including
 nationalization,"  He also stated that developing countries should
 "gradually shake off control. of foreign capital."  Meng assumed a
 flexible attitude toward the role of trade and foreign exchanges--
 subjects of supposed debate within the Chinese leadership.  The
 vice premier stuck to Peking's stress on self-reliance but also
 affirmed the Chinese belief that this in no way means "self-seclusion"
 or rejection of foreign exchanges on an equitable basis.

 SINO-SOVIET ISSUES    While generally softpedaling criticism
 of the United States, Teng strove to
 isolate Moscow with a tough indictment of Moscow's international
 economic policies.     Teng attacked Moscow's advocacy of "inter-
 national division of labor," its economic domination in East
 Europe, Its use of joint enterprises abroad, its aid policies--
 especially in the Middle East--and its alleged thesis that a
 country's sovereignty over its resources depends upon its
 ability to exploit and use those resources..  Teng's criticisms
 cap a series of major PEOPLE'S DAILY and NCNA commentaries leading
 up to the special session that have been designed to show the
 developing nations that the Soviet Union is not, only a military
 and political threat to their security but an economic superpower
 as well.
 BACKGROUND     Teng's speech climaxed a period of increasing
 Chinese attention to and support for third world
 countries and oppressed peoples generally.  This emphasis became
 particularly manifest after the PRC leadership's consultations
 with visiting Algerian President Boumediene in February, following
 his call for the UNGA special session.  Since then Chinese
 leaders have taken pains to display to third world visitors PRC
 solidarity with their cause, suggesting that China may have been
 tailoring its recent foreign policy comment with an eye to making
 a splash at the UNGA session.  Chou En-lai, in a 24 March banquet
 speech for Tanzanian President Nyerere, strongly reaffirmed
 Peking's "bounden proletarian internationalist duty" to support
 oppressed nations and peoples, while Wang Hung-wen in a 3 April
 rally speech for visiting Cambodians disclosed a new Mao
 instruction regarding Chinese duty to help world struggles.
 Peking's effort reflects the continuing concern of Chinese
 leaders to balance China's various world constituencies and
 retain revolutionary credentials, while flexibly pursuing broader
 goals abroad.   From time to time over the past few years of
 developing detente with Washington and pragmatic international
 contacts, the %"hinese have striven to reassert their credentials
 as supporters of revolutionary movements.  For example, following
 public indications of movement in Sino-U.S. relations in late
 1970, Chou, in a March 1971 rally speech in Hanoi, reported a new
 Mao instruction testifying to Chinese support for revolution
 abroad.  Similarly, a month after President Nixon's visit in
 February 1972, Chou affirmed in a banquet speech for Prince Sihanouk
 that China regarded continued support for world revolution a "bounden
 internationalist duty."

 NCNA TREATMENT     NCNA and other Chinese media have given full
 OF SESSION         coverage to Teng's activities and to his
 UNGA address.    NCNA promptly reported
 Secretary Kissinger's 14 April banquet for Teng and his assistants,
 Vice Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua and Permanent UN representative
 Huang Hua.  Like NCNA's coverage of a comparable banquet given by
 Kissinger for Ch:iao Kuan-hua during the regular UNGA session last
 October, there was no 'characterization of the atmosphere.
 NCNA's coverage of Kissinger's 15 April UNGA speech routinely
 criticized his call for continued international "interdependence"
 and his remarks on the Arab oil embargo, charging that he had
 "threatened" third world countries with retaliation if they used
 control of resources to exert international pressure.  NCNA gave
 similarly critical coverage to Gromyko's 11 April low key address,
 rebutting his claim that Moscow is the natural ally of developing
 countries and noting his alleged unease over the exposure of
 Moscow's "superpower hegemonism" at the session,

 GROMYKO REAFFIRMS SOVIET VIEWS ON ENERGY, WORLD SITUATION
 Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's 11 April address to the UNGA
 special session, as reported iu PRAVDA on the 12th, broke no
 new ground on issues nominally on the agenda.  He restated
 previously announced Soviet positions on the causes of the
 world energy shortage, the right of developing countries to
 exercise full sovereignty over their natural resources and
 Moscow's willingness to participate in a broad international
 effort to examine energy problems.  Given the forum, the most
 siE;nificant aspect of Gromyko's remarks was rather his own
 affirmation of the continuity in Soviet foreign policy, as
 evidenced in his attempt to place the immediate resource issues
 under discussion in the context of broader Soviet concerns
 about detente and international economic cooperation.  Moscow
 had earlier shown signs of mixed emotions about the UNGA
 session, undoubtedly due in part to the expectation that
 Peking and a number of the nonalined states would use the
 occasion to attack Soviet policies.  Reflecting this concern,
 the thrust. of Gromyko's effort was to defend the Soviet role
 in the third world while shifting the focus of UN discus3ion
 to areas where Moscow has traditionally felt more comfortable
 and in which Soviet policies could be more easily defended.
 While responding only indirectly to Teng Hsaio-ping's earlier
 barbs and making perfunctory comments about the sinister role
 of "monopoly capital" and "neocolonialism," Gromyko moved on
 quickly to point out that the session was being held in condi-
 ticne of "deepen ng detente" and indeed that the improved
 international situation had made such a meeting possible,  He
 cautioned that any recommendations emanating from the session
 should "accord with the interest& of further improving the
 int.e.rnatio~ia.l situation,"  Echoing a persistent Soviet complaint
 at recent UN sessions, ~romyko urged that, in di'cussing narrower
 economic and social ts3ues, the delegates not lose sight of the
 fact, that. "concern for peace" remains the "main UN task."  In
 that regard it was noteworthy that his only specific recommenda-
 tion regarding any resolution adopted by the session was that it
 attach "due significance" to "tasks of preventing war and
 preserving peace,"
 Gromyko took advantage of the session's focus on international
 economic relations to reaffirm Moscow's interest in expanded
 in.ternarional economic cooperation.  Twice noting the need for
 a "restructuring" of international economic relationships,
 Gromyko pointed to Soviet industrial and scientific might and

 to a "large domestic market" as evidence of Soviet potential
 for participation in such expanded international exchange.
 Gromyko offered a guarded assessment of East-West economic
 exchanges to date, noting that while progress is being made
 While breaking little new ground on energy, Gromyko put an
 authoritative stamp on earlier Soviet statements and analyses.
 He argued that the origins of the recent energy shortage lay
 not in natural but in social and political causes--including
 Israeli policies in the Middle East and a history of Western
 "plundering" of the oil reserves of producing countries.  He
 pointedly observed, in this connection, that the socialist
 countries had been "hardly affected."  He also denied that
 the oil-producing states could be blamed for exerting sover-.
 eignty over their own resources and gave implicit support for
 the Arab oil embargo.  He did, however, say that Moscow does
 not favor an embargo "for its own sake" and conceded that "an
 aggravation of the oil problem" could cause a "new flareup in
 international tension."  Gromyko did not make more specific
 Moscow's rather vague hints about its own ideas fc'r a solution
 to energy problems..  He did, however, reaffirm earlier Soviet
 statements, including his own in Paris on 18 February, in
 arguing that any solution should combine the efforts of "a
 broad circle of states" and in stating Moscow's "readiness to
 participate both in bilateral and in multilateral discussions."

 Not surprisingly, Moscow has sustained a hands-off policy toward
 Secretary of State Kissinger's 15 April address.  A TASS report
 of that day's developments at. the session concluded with a brief
 report on his remarks.  Correspondent Yuriy Romantsev noted both
 Kissinger's "emphatic" point that a solution to these problems
 was possible under only conditions of detente and his "barrage
 of attacks" on developing countries for their efforts to unite
 to influence world prices for raw materials.  Commentary on the
 session has ignored Kissinger's remarks and gone on to attack
 only in general terms "imperialist" economic policy in the third
 world.

 al-Asad's 11-16 April "friendly official" visit to the Soviet
 Union at the head of a party-government delegation.  The treat-
 ment was presumably contrived to impress Washington and Cairo
 as well as al-Asad himself.  Brezhnev, Podgornyy and Kosygin
 showed up to greet al-Asad on his arrival in Moscow and
 the same leaders saw him off: cr., the 13th for visits to Volgograd
 and Tashkent en route home.  The airport ceremonies were
 carried live on radio and television---an unusual treatment
 not known to have been accorded previous Arab visitors.  And
 the concluding document was dressed up as a joint statement
 signed by Brezhnev and al-Asad, whereas most such Soviet-Arab
 documents have been issued unsigned.*
 PROGRAM      Apart from these csremon:ial extras, al-Asad's
 OF VISIT     visit followed much the same pattern as that of
 his last official visit in July 1972.**  On both
 occasions he was preceded by an economic delegation for
 advance talks. In 1972, he had been met by Podgornyy and
 Kosygin; Brezhnev did not join these talks until the second
 day.  On the current visit, all three Soviet leaders partic-
 ipat(:d in, the two sessions of the talks on the 11th and the
 12th.  Brezhnev spoke at a dinner on the 11th for al-Asad,
 greeting him as an "outstanding political leader of the Arab
 world," and Pcdgornyy spoke at a luncheon given by al-Asad
 the next day, also attended by Brezhnev and Kosygin.
 On both visits, agreements were signed on the third day and
 al-Asad left Moscow-in 1972, for an overnight stopover in
 Sochi on his way to Cairo, and this year for visits to

 Volgograd and Tashkent en route home.  The documents signed
 this year included the Joint statement, a plan of party ties
 for 1974, a long-term economic-technical cooperation agreement,
 a cultural-scientific cooperation plan for 1974 and a protocol
 on trade for 1974.
 Moscow also took the unusual step of providing al-Asad an
 opportunity to address the Soviet public in a speech over
 Moscow television--an honor that has been accorded President
 Nixon and West European, but not Arab, leaders.  According to
 Damascus radio, the speech was delivered on the 12th, and it
 was reported by TASS and broadcast by Moscow in Arabic on the
 14th.  On the 1972 visit he was interviewed by a Moscow radio
 and television correspondent; this interview was reported by
 TASS and Moscow's Arabic service, but there were no reports
 that it was televised.
 BREZHNEV SPEECH     Brezhnev in his dinner speech on the 11th
 warned against the substitution of "partial
 solutions" for an overall settlement, a warning that he had
 also voiced in his last remarks on the Middle East in a 30 January
 Havana speech.  He said in Cuba that the Egyptian-Israeli
 disengagement agreement was a positive step but "only a partial
 measure of purely military character" and that the Geneva
 conference should carry out its mission of achieving a cardinal
 political settlement.  Without mentioning the Suez disengagement
 accord in the current speech, Brezhnev cautioned that "against
 the background of a certain decrease in tensions, the aggressor
 and his patrons" might again try to avoid an overall settlement.
 It was not accidental, he said, that "ersatz plans" for a
 settlement had recently been launched, in effect replacing a
 general solution with "partial agreements of different kinds."
 Brezhnev supported Syria's position that agreement on troop
 disengagement must be regarded as part of an overall Mideast
 settlement including complete Israeli withdrawal from all
 occupied Arab territories.  A just peace, he reiterated, means
 Israeli withdrawal from lands occupied in 1967 "and later,"
 insurance of security and sovereignty for all states in the
 region, and respect for the Palestinians' legitimate rights.
 He claimed that the Soviet Union consistently pursued this
 course in talks with the United States, coordinating its
 actions with the Arabs.

 Brezhnev again underscored Soviet concern to get the diplomatic
 action back to Geneva, asserting that a settlement "can and must
 be" worked out within the Geneva framework.  He expressed
 appreciation that Syria shared the view--set out in the 7 March
 communique or), Gromyko's talks in Damascus and repeated in the
 joint statemeat--that the Soviet Union should participate in
 "all stages" and "all fields" of a Mideast settlement.
 Brezhnev appeared to pledge continued military assistance
 when he said, speaking of bilateral cooperation, that this
 the following day also mentioned that new agreements to be
 signed in economic, technical and cultural cooperation would
 help in strengthening Syria's "defense capacity," and the joint
 statement made three references to Syrian defense in a ?imilar
 vein.
 srread to the field of defense."  Podgornyy in his speech
 PODGORNYY SPEECH     In his luncheon speech on the 12th Podgornyy
 took up a common theme in current Soviet
 comment on the Mideast which has reflected Soviet misgivings
 over "liberalizing" political. and economic trends In Egypt.  He
 called for vigilance toward the intrigues of "imperialist and
 reactionary forces" in the present "acute political struggle"
 going on around a Middle East settlement.  It is important, he
 said, that the current situation be assessed "correctly and
 realistically" and that one should see "all the concealed
 plots" and be able to see the difference between friends and
 allies.  Echoing his call for vigilance, a Moscow commentary
 in Arabic on the 16th warned against machinations by Tel Aviv
 and its protecting forces which "appear to be seeking to
 establish peace" but are "drawing the Arabs into a trap" and
 imposing a settlement on their own terms.
 Along the lines of the 7 March Gromyko communique, Podgornyy
 declared Soviet support for the Arabs' use of "all the means" of
 struggle to establish peace.  The Soviet-Syrian joint statement
 tied this phrase to Syria's military strength, confirming the
 importance of strengthening Syria's "defense potential and its
 lawful, inalienable right to the use of all effective means" for
 liberation of its occupied lands.
 JOINT STATEMENT     The Soviet-Syrian ;statement was cast in an
 unusual format for a Soviet-Arab document,
 apparently to give it a more formal character.  It was divided

 East peace, and international security, preceded by what
 Damascus radio called a "preamble" anii TASS described as an
 "official report" listing those participating in the talks
 and summing up al-Asad's acttvities.
 The most notable substantive feature of the joint statement is
 the passage on detente.  It pledges efforts by both parties
 to oppose attempts by "aggressive and reactionary circles" to
 complicate relations between states and aggravate the international
 situation, and affirms that "international relaxation" should
 become irreversible and be expanded to encompass areas dangerous
 for peace.  This is apparently the first time that such a passage
 in support of detente has been included in a Soviet-Arab document.
 It would seem to signify that despite rloscow's displeasure at
 being cut out of the diplomatic activity for a Mideast settlement,
 the Soviet Union does not want the Arab-Israeli problem to affect
 adversely its overall relationship with the United States.  In
 obtaining Syrian agreement to this passage, Moscow might also
 be replying indirectly to Egyptian accusations that the USSR
 believes detente should be, restricted to the two superpowers,
 while small stales should be under the tutelage of one or the
 other great power.
 The section on "strong and invincible" Syrian-Soviet friendship
 contained the usual expressions of satisfaction with past
 cooperation and of interest in improving it in various fields,
 including unspecified steps for further strengthening Syria's
 "defense capacity."
 The section of the statement on the Middi.  East was similar to
 the 7 March communique on Gromyko's talks in Syria.*  Thus it
 reiterated that peace cannot be achieved without full Israeli
 withdrawal and guarantee of the Palestinians' lawful "national"
 right..  Reviewing "steps being taken" to settle the conflict,
 the s,tiatement reaffirmed that troop disengagement must be part
 of an overall settlement including Israeli withdrawal; it did
 not include the call., in the March communique, for a timetable
 for withdrawal.

 HPNOI1 PRG DENY 1 RAT COMMUNISTS OVERRAN SOUTH VIETNAMESE BASE
 A 13 April PRG vereign 11-1ALiStLy  eLutement promptly rejected
 Saigon charges that communist forces had overrun Tonle Cham
 base the day before and condemned South Vietnamese air strikes
 against the PRG-controlled area of Loc Ninh in retaliation for
 the alleged communist attack.*        The statement claimed that the
 base--located on the border of Binh Long and Tay Ninh provinces--
 had been shelled in response to ARVN "nibbling operations" and
 that the GVN troops finally withdrew "to avoid being used as
 scapegoats for the Nguyen Van Thieu clique's bellicose policy."
 The PRG's version of the incident was endorsed in a DRV Foreign
 Ministry statement on the 16th.  Later the same day', a spokesman
 for the DRV Foreign Ministry issued another statement assailing
 a 15 April. 3i:atement by a U.S. State Department spokesman that
 the base had been attacked by North Vietnamese troops in "one
 of the most flagrant DRS' violations" of the cease-fire since
 the peace agreement.  The DRV spokesman reiterated that the
 GVN troops fled of their own accord and charged that Saigon
 had "fabricated the so-called attack" as an "excuse to escalate
 the war."
 Communist reports claim that the South Vietnamese carried out
 bombing raids on the Loc Ninh area for four consecutive days--from
 the 12th to the 15th--and that schools, pagodas, and a hospital were
 hit.
 Early reaction by Vietnamese communist broadcast media to the
 Saigon announcement it was suspending GVN participation in the
 Paris bilateral talks because of the Tonle Cham attacks was
 confined to a passing reference to the GVN's intention to walk
 out, in the 16 April DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement,
 as well as in a 17 April NHAN DAN commentary.  The NHAN DAN
 commentator noted that Saigon had suspended the Paris negotiations
 "of its own volition" and reiterated standard charges of
 "intensified" U.S. military involvement in South Vietnam.  A

 DRV DELEGATION ENDS TOUR WITH MOSCOW, PEKING STOPOVERS
 A DRV delegation led by Premier Pham Van Dong returned home on
 16 April, via Moscow and Peking, from a month-long series of
 official visits to Cuba, Algeria, Yugoslavia, and Sweden to
 thank those nations for their wartime aid.*  The deputy head
 of the delegation, Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy Trinh, is not
 reported to have gone to Sweden.  And according to Moscow
 media, Trinh arrived in the Soviet capital from Budapest on
 the 11th, the same day that Dong arrived from Sweden.  Trinh
 had made a brief official visit to Hungary between the de-lega-
 tion's sojourns In Cuba and Algeria; the reason for his being
 in Budapest again has not been explained, and available DRV
 and Hungarian media have not reported any details of Trinh's
 second Budapest visit or his departure following it.
 Soviet Premier Kosygin met with Dong and Trinh during their
 11-13 April stopover in Moscow and held talks, in an atmosphere
 of "fraternal friendship and cordiality," on Soviet-Vietnamese
 cooperation, the situation in Vietnam, and "some international
 problems" of mutual concern.  TASS and VNA accounts of the
 meeting did not indicate whether the issue of alleged violations
 of the Paris agreement was raised, but they did note that the
 Soviet side offered conventional assurances of "firm and
 consistent" support for DRV-PRG efforts to secure strict
 observance of the accord.  The Soviets also reaffirmed their
 "high appraisal" of the 22 March PRG six-point proposal.  Kosygin
 had similarly met with the DRV leaders on 20 March during the
 delegation's stopover on its way to Cuba.
 During its 14-16 April stay in Peking the DRV delegation was
 duly feted on the 14th by Chou En-lai, who had a "very cordial
 and friendly" talk with the guests, acc~-~rding to NCNA.  Dong

 HANOI CITY PARTY CONGRESS ELECTS NEW SECRETARY
 The holding of the sixth congress of the, Hanoi municipal party
 organization from 8 to 12 April, reported by Hanoi radio on the,
 14th, brings to the fore the question oC Then the fourth Vietnam
 Workers Party Congress will be held.*  it would seem likely that
 the Hanoi congress--the pacesetter for party organizations
 throughout the DRV--will be followed shortly by other local party
 congresses.
 The Hanoi city party gathering devoted extensive attention to
 economic restoration, agriculture, and management tasks; elected
 a new executive committira of the municipal party organization;
 and named Nguyen Lam, a member of the VWP Central Committee, to
 the new executive committee.  Lam replaces Secretary Nguyen Van
 Tran, who "has been given a new assignment by the party Central
 Committee," according to the first Hanoi account, which did not
 specify Tran's new poeitiona  The first Hanoi report on the
 congress gave no indication that any VWP Politburo members
 attended, although Premier Phem Van Dong addressed the fifth
 Hanoi party congress in. April 1971.
 *  The date for the VWP's last congress, the third, held in early
 September 1960 immediately after observance of the DRV's national
 day on 2 September, was announced in March of that year, and pre-
 congress preparations, including the issuance of new party
 statutes, were publicized throughout the spring and summer of that
 year.

 Some indication of the timing of local preparations for the
 Hanoi municipal party congress was evident in the fo.Llowing:
 the city party newspaper HANOI MOI announced on 1.9 March
 that Hanoi districts and wards had completed between 11 and
 18 March the organizing of congresses of local party delegates
 to discuss the draft political report for'tlie'municipal
 congress, review 1973 tasks and the local tasks-for 1974,
 and elect delegates to the I aaoi' mturiicipgl ddngres's.  Thus,
 about',6ne' mouth elapsed between local preparations and the
 holdipg: of -the. .}janoi congress..
 CONGRESS PROCEEDINGS     Outgoing Hanoi municipal VWP Secretary
 Nguyen Van Tran delivered the-main
 report at the congress, according to Hanoi radio, and dwelt on
 the situation over the past three years and the tasks for the
 coming two years.  The short summary of his report available
 and reportage on the congress' activities su2est  that most
 emphasis was on economic matters and management.  The congress
 reviewed "shortcomings in economic management" and adopted
 five "major tasks" for 1974 and 1975, including overcoming the
 war's consequences, restoring and developing the economy and
 culture, socialist construction, and others dealing with
 improving management and leadership.  The congress also stressed
 the need to "vigorously develop agriculture" to supply Hanoi's
 food needs and to solve "urgent problems" in. living conditions,
 food, housing, and the like.
 The Hanoi congress elected a new executive committee composed
 of 35 permanent and 16 alternate members, the radio noted,
 pointing out that 10 of these are economic management cadres,
 scientific and technical cadres, and young cadres working in
 the economy.  Hanoi's first report on the election of
 Nguyen Lam to the new executive committee did not specify that
 he was replacing Tran, although the juxtaposition of their
 reassignments implied as much.
 The first available confirmation that Nguyen Lam also is
 secretary of the Hanoi municipal party committee came in
 Hanoi's list of officials greeting Premier Pham Van Dong's
 arrival back in Hanoi on 16 April after his European tour.
 Nguyen Van Tian, last identified as secretary of the Hanoi
 city party committee on 2 April, was identified only in
 his other position as a member of the VWP Central Committee
 Secretariat in the same listing of those welcoming home Dong.

 A 2 April announcement of changes in government positions had
 noted that Nguyen Lam was giving up his chairmanship of the
 State Planning Commission and the State Price Commission
 in order to assume an unspecified "new assignment."*
 Nguyen Lam had previously held the post of Hanoi party secretary
 in the early 1960's; he was identified in that position as late
 as December 1966.  In February 1967 Nguyen Van Tran evidently took
 over the party post at the same time that it was announced that
 he was relinquishing his job as minister of heavy industry.
 Nguyen Lam has not had a very active public role since 1966, but
 he served from 1967 to 1969 as vice minister of light industry,
 and in December 1969 he gave up `:hat post to become a minister
 and vice chairman of the State Planning Commission.  He was
 given the chairmanship of the Price Commission in 1971 and
 became the head of the Planning Commission in June 1973.

 YUG0SLA'1IA
 TITO REGISTERS DEFIANCE TO "PRESSURES" FROM ABROAD
 President Tito has added his authoritative voice.for the first
 time to the current chorus of Yugoslav defiance against foreign
 upressuresii and Italiau,cl_nims to Line Yugoslav-administered
 "Zone B" area south of Trieste.  Speaking on 15 April to'a
 meeting of the Sarajevo political aktiv preparatory to the LCY
 congress, Tito reflected sensitivity about those who would
 seek to exploit potential Yugoslav disarray under conditions
 of Tito's disability or death,  The Yugoslav leader charged
 that those exerting pressure from abroad "constantly wait for
 something to happen in Yugoslavia, for it to split and break
 up," hoping that they will "get something."  He went on immedi-
 ately to characterize the border dispute with Italy as a type
 of pressure and reiterated the standard Belgrade position on
 the border dispute with Rome.  While voicing aaope for good
 relations with Italy and denying any intent to indulge in
 "sabre-rattling," he portrayed the dispute with Rome as a
 lasting "scar" on the two countries' relations and strongly
 asserted Yugoslav sovereignty over the disputed zone.  The
 Yugoslavs, he. declared, view the territory in question not as
 Zone B but as an integral part of the Slovenian republic.  He
 ~,en.t: on to observe that the dispute involved not only Italy
 but also NATO, terming it "not an accident that [in Mar.h] the
 Americans held these maneuvers with them there, that is, here
 in the Adriatic under our noses, at our border."
 Tito seemed concerned to refute the notion that Yugoslav fears
 the Soviet Union.  Such a fear had been suggested by recent
 Yugoslav commentaries which cited Czechoslovak defector Sejna's
 claims--voiced in an interview aired on Austrian TV in
 February--of a detailed Soviet plan to invade Yugoslavia
 following Tito's demise,   Tito referred to "other pressures"
 and to propaganda in the Western and Austrian press.  In an
 "authorized" version of his speech carried by TANJUG, but not
 in the Belgrade radio recording of the speech, Tito was quoted
 as following the reference to the Western press by saying
 For instance there are also some calculations against
 the Soviet Union here.  They try to frighten us with
 the Soviet Union and constantly talk about a great
 danger threatening us from that side.  I know for
 certain that we do not need to fear the Soviet Union.

 As far back as the time of the war Soviet troops have
 been in Hungary.  And when we were in the most diffi-
 cult situation, in our quarrels with Stalin; when
 Stalin threatened us with troops, we were not afraid.
 We were preparing ourselves in the necessary manner,
 and in case of need we would have defended ourselves.
 Now we have good relations with the Soviet Union.  We
 have a tremendous amount of foreign trade with it.
 We have very good relations with Hungary.
 While Yugoslav media have in the past complained about joint
 Soviet-Hungarian maneuvers in Hungary, they have not commented
 on recent extensive military activities there.  Observers of
 maneuvers in March had included Lt. Gen. Andryushchenko, the
 Warsaw Pact high command representative in Hungary.  And on
 26-28 March Budapest was the site of a Warsaw Pact Military
 Council session presided over by Pact Commander Yakubovskiy.
 Presumably to reassure Belgrade, the early March exercises
 were followed up with a visit to Yugoslavia by Hungarian
 Defense Minister Czinege, who had talks with Tito on, among
 other things, "the broadening relations cf the armies" of the
 two countries.

 FRENCH  ELECTIONS
 MOSCOW RANKS FRENCH CANDIDATES:  CHABAN, MITTERRAND, GISCARD
 Although Moscow's general coverage of the French presidential
 election campaign has continued to be confined for the most
 part to brief, factual, and relatively straightforward reportage,
 some comment has made increasingly clear Moscow's caution in
 treating the possibility of a Mitterrand victory and the result-
 ing unknown effect this would have on Soviet relations with
 France and Europe.*  This was clearly demonstrated in the weekly
 Moscow domestic radio observers roundtable discussion program
 of 14 April, which in effect revealed Moscow's implied preference
 for the relatively known quantity of a Gaullist victory in the
 person of Chaban-Delinas and seemed to rank Mitterrand and 'Giscard
 d'Estaing-after Chaban, iii that order.
 Coming two days after Mitterrand's 12 April. press conference,
 in which he touched upon future French policy toward Europe,
 NATO, CSCE, and MBFR if he became president, the roundtable
 discussion refrained from commenting on the leftist candidate's
 foreign policy remarks, while readily evaluatng Chaban and
 Giscard in this field.  Regardi_:g Chaban, LIFE ABROAD deputy
 chief editor G. Kuznetsov favorably observed that Chaban had
 stated that he would follow de Gaulle's foreign policy of
 "independence in all forms," including the further development
 of Soviet-French cooperation,   On the other hand, Kuznetsov
 followed with a comment on Giscard portraying him as trying to
 establish a presidential majority around Independent Republicans
 and centrists, who are "ardent Atlantists and supporters of the
 political, not just economic, unification of the Common Market
 countries"--attributes that are damning in the vernacular of
 the Soviet media.  But as regards the foreign policy remarks of
 Mitterrand, who had so conveniently opened the door for the
 discussion, there was a striking silence by the roundtable
 participants.
 While Moscow has commented favorably on the leftist Joint Program,
 it has entirely ignored the foreign policy aspects, limiting its
 remarks to innocuous replays of PCF leaders' statements suggesting
 that implementation of the program would alleviate such internal
 French economic difficulties as inflation and unemployment.

 it has offered or, U.S.-European differences over the past half-year.
 On the one hand, it has presented these dcv-l.opments as a positive
 phenomenon, testifying to the willingness of the European countries
 to stand up to the United States, and hence--given Moscow's view
 of the issues, such as the Middle Eaat--to stand up for peace.  On
 the other hand, it has stressed the undiminished strength of the
 forces of reaction in the Western world, and it has interpreted
 some of the European actions, particularly the drive for European
 defense cooperation, as motivate,-11 by these sinister forces.  An
 article in the 3 April LITERATURNAYA GAZETA attempts to square the
 circle in this regard by suggesting that the U.S.-dominated
 "multinational monopolies" lie behind all the troubles in the
 Western world, exacerbating both the divisions among the European
 countries and between the European countries and the United States.
 THE MONOPOLIES     The article, written by veteran European
 commentator N. Molchanov, like virtually all
 recent Soviet comment on U.S.-European differences, is stronger
 on imagery than logic0  It likens the "crisis" in the Western
 world to the decline envisioned by Spengler and notes that Marxists
 have long predicted it,  The root cause of the problem, it says,
 is economic, and the culprits are the multinational monpolies
 which "have refined to the highest degree the parasitic art of
 extracting profits."  Although the article asserts that "all West
 Europe's present disorders" can be ascribed to the machinations
 of the msanopolies, it offers no explanation of how this is supposed
 to have taken place.
 The article is a little clearer in explaining the alleged relation-
 ship between the activities cf the monopolies and the current
 strains in U.S.-European relations.  It implies that the European
 revolt against U.S. "tutelage" is in effect a revolt against the
 domination of the multinational monopolies, long known to be
 controlled by U.S. interests.  Thus it says the links between
 U0S. firms and the multinational monopolies provided the "background
 against which the strongest outbursts of anti-Americanism in
 West Europe erupted."

 CSCE     Summing up this preliminary analysis with the bland
 assertion that the conflicts between the United States
 and the European countries are an "inevitable phenomenon
 arising out of the very nature of capitalism;" the article
 goes on to suggest that the CSCE offers a way out of the
 crisis.  It asserts that the talks in Geneva have reached
 a crucial stage on which the outcome of the entire conference
 depends. While it professes optimism about the prospects for
 agreement, it warns of the "stubborn efforts" being made to
 entangle the talks in the contradictions of the Atlantic
 alliance, the Common Market, the energy crisis, and the Middle
 East conflict. It describes as a "vestige of the cold war"
 the "hullabaloo in the Western press" about the free exchange
 of persons and ideas, asserting that it concealed a desire
 to frustrate the achievement of agreements.  The article is
 equally emphatic in insisting that not the "slightest ambiguity"
 could be allowed regarding the principle of the inviolability
 of borders.
 THE FRENCH     One of the more notable features of the article
 CONNECTION     and a sign of its topical character is the great
 stress it places on the importance of Franco-Soviet
 relations as a foundation stone of European security.  The
 article gives unstinting praise to General de Gaulle and the
 independent line he introduced into French foreign policy.  It
 recalls with approval his decision to withdraw France from
 the NATO military system, and it condemns those who are now
 allegedly pressuring France to abandon the "independent Gaullist
 line of its foreign policy and return to 'orthodox Atlantism. "'
 It gives equal praise to Pompidou and recalls that France, along
 with the Soviet Union, played an "enormous role" in bringing about
 the CSCE talks.  It asserts that the continued cooperation of the
 two countries is of "no less significance" in insuring the
 successful completion of the talks.

 KCMMUNIST CHIEF EDITOR REMOVED AMID SIGNS OF DISGRACE
 The circumstances surrounding the mid-January removal of
 A. G. Yegorov as chief editor of the CPSU Central Committee's
 key party journal, KOMMUNIST, suggest that he was fired
 suddenly in disgrace.  The likelihood that Yegorov's ouster
 was precipitate was clearly indicated by the fact no successor
 was named at the time of his removal and that KOMMUNIST has
 remained without a chief editor for more than two months.
 His removal evidently caused some delay and disarray in cele-
 brating the journal's 50th anniversary that fell on 5 April.
 While the immediate cause of Yegorov's removal as KOMMUNIST
 chief editor remains unclear, an article by him in the November
 1973 literary journal ZNA14YA may have outraged conservatives
 by its strikingly undogmatic formulations on culture and
 nationalism.
 Yegorov, a 54-year-old philosopher, was last listed as chief
 editor of KOMMUNIST in issue No. 1 for 1974, signed to the
 press on 14 January.  The succeeding three issues, covering
 February and March, list no chief editor in the masthead.  There
 have been no other changes in the membership of the editorial
 board.
 Evidence of disarray ensuing from Yegorov's removal surfaced
 in the confused and uncoordinated handling by the Soviet
 central and regional press of KOMMUNIST's 50th anniversary,
 which according to Soviet calendars was scheduled to be
 celebrated on 5 April.  Although the less prominent journal
 PLANNED ECONOMY had been awarded an Order of the Red Banner
 on its 50th anniversary on 18 March, as reported in the
 19 March PRAVDA, no award for the prestigious KOMMUNIST was
 announced on its anniversary.  In fact, the entire central
 press--except for the twice-weekly paper SOVIET CIJLTURE--
 completely ignored the 5 April anniversary.  The 5 April
 SOVIET CULTURE ran a long anniversary article stressing
 KOMMUNIST's role as a reliable guide in literature and art
 and indicating that the April issue would be the jubilee
 issue.  Yet, when PRAVDA on 6 April routinely announced the
 appearance of issue No. 5, its description of the contents
 did not mention the anniversary.

 Moscow's silence was underscored by the fact that a few regional
 papers--apparently uninformed of Moscow's decision to ignore the
 anniversary--on ,5 April ran a NOVOSTI agency article on the
 journal's anniversary.  This article, by Aleksandr, Bakin, was
 published in LENINGRADSKAYA PRAVDA, SOVETSKAYA KIRGIZIYA,
 SOVETSKAYA LITVA, and TURKMENSKAYA ISKRA.  The Bakin article
 struck an odd note, stressing the usually ignored 20th CPSU
 Congress, "in the work of which the question of overcoming the
 cult of personality occupied an important place" and after
 which, it declared, the journal had improved its work.
 On 16 April Moscow radio finally reported a belated message
 of cgngratulations from the Central Committee to the KOMMUNIS T
 editorial board on its anniversary.  The message stressed that
 a "high party attitude and uncompromising struggle against
 bourgeois ideology and right and left revisionism" are
 "characteristic" of KOMMUNIST articles.
 NOVEMBER ARTICLE     Although there has been no recent public
 criticism of Yegorov, he may have come
 under fire for expressing unorthodox views in his article on
 art and its national and international manifestations that
 appeared in ZNAMYA's November issue.  Avoiding a narrowminded
 or simplistic approach and customary stereotypes about the
 need for party loyalty and ideological. struggle, Yegorov dealt
 with the touchy subjects of artistic freedom, cultural exchanges
 and slavophilism.  He discussed art in terms of its value for
 all mankind, rather than as "class" art, cited talent and
 originality as criteria for an artist's work rather than
 ideological criteria, and declared that progressive art is
 not limited only to works of socialist realism.* He argued
 that the scientific-technical revolution and detente increase
 the need for exchange of "artistic valuables" with the West.
 While chiding slavophiles fcr their nationalistic idealizing
 of the "archaic," he defended the features of nationalities
 against "leftists" and their "national nihilism" and insisted
 that despite what internationalistic extremists say, nations
 and national languages are not dying out in the Soviet Union.
 Yegorov previously had written articles on art and nationality--
 in a mid-1954 QUESTIONS OF PHILOSOPHY  .nd in June 1956 and
 March 1960 issues of KOMMUNIST--as well as a number of books
 on art and esthetics.

 Yegorov's article, with its undogmatic approach and frequent
 use of the term "all-human" in discussing the value of artistic
 works, contrasted sharply with an article by ideological hard-
 liner V. N. Yagodkin, Moscow gorkom ideology secretary, that
 appeared in KOMMUNIST shortly after Yegorov's removal--in issue
 No. 3, signed to press in mid-February.  Yagodkin complained
 of increasing e2forts by bourgeois propagandists, revisionists
 and opportunists to label one-sided the class approach to
 social phenomena and to "replace it with an abstract, 'all-human"
 approach.  He did not deal specifically with the subject matter
 of Yegorov's article, however.
 Yegorov's article also appears at variance with the views, of
 KOML'IUNIST deputy chief editor E. A. Bagramov.  As reported in
 issue No. 2 of the journal RECENT AND MOST RECENT HISTORY,
 Bagramov delivered a speech in late October 1973 on the
 "Marxist-Leninist theory of national relations and the present
 ideological struggle," stressing the class approach and
 declaring that conflict between socialist and capitalist views
 of national relations io "sharper than ever before,"
 YEGOROV' S CAREER     Yegorov originally joined KOMMUNIST in
 1952 at the aga of 32 as deputy chief and
 then chief of one of its departments,  After serving as chief
 editor of the journal POLITICAL SELF-EDUCATION from :.956 to
 1961, he rose to deputy head of Agitprop under. Khrua+r. _heV' c
 ideological chief, L. F. llichev.  In July 1962, shortly after
 V. P. Stepanov replaced a Stalinist, F. V. Kon.stantinoir, as
 KOMMUNIST .:.hie" editor, Yegorov joined the journal's editorial
 board.  Ye.go-rov also became a men,'fer of the Central Cc;mai.t'cae's
 i:deologioai Commission when it wa created  by Ma ushchev in
 late 1962.
 Whe:,,, the ideological. apparatus was reorganj zec, in 1965 after
 Khrushchev's fall, Stepan  was demooted. and Ye or.?c.v appo;.nted
 KOMMUNIST chief editor.  Howe-_;rer, there were sig. .s c  cpposition
 to him prior to his appointment.  In. June 1965, while Yegorov
 was deputy Agitprop head and a member of KOMMUNIST's a t-! torial

 sharply criticize a character named."Stepanov" but who then changed
 his mind, for? opportunistic reasons  ..nd eulogized "Stepanov" instead.
 In:December of the same year Ysgovov became chief editor of the
 journal and. Stepanov was demoted to a member of the board.  Soon
 afterward, in late March 1966, PART"  LIFE chief editor Ye. I. Bugayev
 was removed and transferred to deputy chief editor. of KOMMUNIST under
 Yegorov, whom he had appeared to criticize in 1965.  Bugr:yev
 and Stepanov have remained on the board ever since,

 REHABILITATED CADRE NAMED TO PLA-VACATED MANGTUNG POSTS
 A 15 April NCNA report on the opening of the Canton trade fair
 identified Chao Tzu-yang as Kwangtung first party secretary and
 chairman of the provincial revolutionary committee.  Chao's
 promotion to provincial chief provides dramatic testimony to
 the success of Chou En-lai's party-oriented coalition, in
 divesting the PLA of the civil administrative tasks it Inherited
 during the turmoil of the cultural revolution and in restoring
 rehabilitated civilian cadres to power.  Chao, Kwangtung party
 chief prior to the cultural revolution, is the first person named
 to fill one of the vacant provincial party first secretary slots
 left by the transfer of all military region (MR) commanders who
 were also provincial party chiefs at the end of 1973.
 Chao's appointment is especially significant in that the new
 Canton MR commander is Politburo member Hsu Shih-yu, who had
 enjoyed the top military, party, and government posts in Ki.angsu
 before he took command of the Canton MR.  Hsu's failure to
 regain civilian authority over his new base suggests that the
 other rotated commanders, who are mostly of lesser rank, are
 unlikely to emerge as party chiefs in their new provinces.  More-
 over, the political future of at least one recently transferred
 MR commander appears to be even more troubled.  Han Hsien-cuu,
 commander of the Lanchow MR, has not made a publi: appearance
 since his transfer was announced early last January.   Han was also
 the apparent target of a recent RED FLAG article attacking regional
 supporters of a war memoir praising Lin Piao.*
 Chao Tzu-yang had slipped from public view in 1966 at the time
 of Red Guard  attacks.  He was charged with ueing a follower of
 Tao Chu, the purged head of the former Central-South Bureau, and
 with making mistakes in carrying out several rural work programs.
 Chao did not appear again until 1971, when iie surfaced in Inner
 Mongolia as a secretary on the newly rebuilt provincial party
 committee.  He moved to Cannon in March 1972 as a vice chairman
 of the Kwangtung provincial revolutionary committee and was
 identified as a provincial party secretary in January 1973.
 Chao's regaining of control over his old provincial bailiwick appears
 to be responsive to recently intensified media calls to correctly

 distinguish between aiming the anti-Confucius struggle more
 directly at a relatively small number of cadres designated as
 diehard followers of Lin Piao, while allowing "a second chance"
 to cadres who have corrected their mistakes.  An unusually
 frar% Chengchow broadcast on 10 April, for example, called
 for "punishing" those who opposed the cultural revolution, but
 at the same time firmly declared that a majority of cadres
 criticized during the cultural revolution should be allowed
 "to atone for their mistakes through meritorious service."  In
 a sweeping statement with far-reaching implications for speeding
 the rehabilitiation of many cultural revolution casualties, the
 broadcast stated that "we must realistically appraise all those
 cadres who were criticized and struggled against" during the
 cultural revolution.  The majority of these cadres were said to
 realize that the cultural revolution "redeemed them" and that
 criticism from the masses "did them much good."

 NOTE
 MOSCOW ON PRC DISARMAMENT ROLE:  Moscow appeared to move a step
 closer to requiring Chinese participation in multilateral arms
 control agreements at the opening session of the Conference of
 the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva on 16 April.  Soviet
 representative Aleksey Roshchin's opening remarks, as reported
 by TASS, included a call for "enlisting in the negotiations on
 disarmament all militarily powerful countries, including all
 nuclear powers and, first and foremost, the Chinese People's
 Republte whose negative stand provides one of the major obstacles
 to the implementation of disarmament programs."  Moscow has
 been persistently vague about Chinese participation in the
 past, but there have been signs of a possible reevaluation of
 this posture over the past year.  Roshchin raised Western
 eyebrows in his speech to the opening session of the disarma-
 ment conference last year on 20 February by arguing that "it
 is necessary for all nuclear powers to take part in talks on
 ending nuclear tests."  Several Soviet srms control observers
 have in recent months reiterated Brezhnev's remarks in his
 World Peace Congress speech on 26 October 1973 which seemed
 also to reflect concern about China.  Brezhnev had said:  "It
 is clear that the struggle to prevent nuclear war cannot for
 long be reduced to the efforts of two states alone., especially
 if others, first and foremost other nuclear powers, continue
 to build up these axins."
