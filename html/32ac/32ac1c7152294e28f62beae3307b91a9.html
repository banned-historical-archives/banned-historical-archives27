 Cambodia:   No major new enemy attacks have
 been reported.
 The latest South Vietnamese operation along
 the southern border has helped reduce Communist mil-
 itary pressure there.   In one of the stiffest bat-
 tles since the cross-border operations began,  the
 South Vietnamese claim to have killed 200 Communists
 in that area.
 South Vietnamese troops moved into the nearly
 deserted town of Takeo yesterday, meeting little
 resistance.   Some of the enemy troops who have be-
 sieged Takeo for the past few weeks apparently
 moved north toward Phnom Penh, where they may soon
 encounter Cambodian Army elements headed for Takeo
 on Routes 2 and 3.   In Kampot Province, heavy fight-
 ing was reported between South Vietnamese troops
 and the Communists near several towns on Route 161.
 Northeast of Phnom Penh,  government forces are
 consolidating their control over Kompong Cham city
 and are now fighting in the town of Tonle Bet, on
 the east bank of the Mekong.    The Communists appar-
 ently did not put up any stiff resistance at Kompong
 Cham, but they may be regrouping nearby.   Government
 losses in regaining Kompong Cham were light, and
 most of the casualties evidently were caused by
 South Vietnamese air strikes on the city.
 The morale of the armed forces is still very
 low, however  in spite of recent allied military
 assistance. rL'                the poor morale was in
 part a result of t o near-annihilation of a battal-
 ion of raw Cambodian Army recruits near the Neak
 Luong ferry before it was recaptured by South Viet-
 namese troops.
 Cambodians are having some trouble with the well-
 trained and aggressive Khmer Krom mercenary troops,
 refusin   to serve under the
 army's comman .

 Romania-USSR:   Party chief Ceausescu departed
 unexpectedly for Moscow yesterday for what may be
 a confrontation with the Soviets over basic policy
 differences.
 The announcement of his departure at the head
 of a ranking delegation stated only that the Roma-
 nian and Soviet leaderships had agreed to hold.
 "talks," suggesting that the trip was at Moscow's
 behest.   From the composition of the group, it ap-
 pears that the Romanians are prepared to discuss
 ideology, economics, and military affairs.
 According to the announcement, those who saw
 the delegation off included most national leaders
 and "many Bucharest citizens," thus demonstrating
 the support and unity of the Romanian people behind
 their leadership.   Such a. demonstrative marshalling
 of popular support indicates that Ceausescu expects
 to have difficult talks with the Soviets and wishes
 to display the strength of his backing.
 Romanian actions in recent months have put an
 added strain on the normally cool relations between
 Bucharest and Moscow.   Earlier this year Romania
 tabled its own proposals on European security and
 disarmament, which were designed to frustrate a
 bloc-to-bloc approach and. were deliberately at. cross
 purposes with Soviet policy.   More recently Bucha-
 rest clearly followed China's lead in recognizing
 Sihanouk's exile government rather than playing the
 USSR's wait-and-see game,
 Last week at the CEMA meeting in Warsaw, Roma-
 nia did not join the new CEMA investment bank, pre-
 sumably because the bank would tie the Romanians
 too closely to the Communist states and would in-
 hibit Bucharest from expanding ties with the West.

 a key place in the talks are Romania's good rela-
 tions with both of Moscow's main antagonists, the
 US and Communist China.
 The symbolic issue that probably holds prior-
 ity in Moscow's view is Romania's "obstructionism"
 within the Warsaw Pact, including its continuing
 resistance to holding Warsaw Pact maneuvers on Ro-
 manian territory.   This subject will probably be an
 important issue in Ceausescu's talks.

 Communist China - US:           Peking's decision not
 to.meet in Warsaw tomorrow represents a postpone-
 ment rather than a termination of the present round
 of talks o
 The Chinese obviously felt that to meet while
 US troops were engaged in ground operations in Cam-
 bodia would prove embarrassing and tend to undercut
 the image of militance and resolution Peking has
 adopted in response to developments in Indochina.
 In particular, the Chinese probably believe that
 signs they were "treating with the enemy" on a
 business-as-usual basis would raise questions in
 Hanoi at a moment when relations with the North
 Vietnamese were improving.   It would, moreover,
 tend to blur the distinction the Chinese have been
 at pains to cultivate between their reaction to
 the Indochina crisis and that of Moscow, which has
 been equivocating on the Cambodian issue,
 Although Peking waited until the last moment
 to announce postponement of the meeting scheduled
 for 20 May, the decision was almost certainly un-
 der consideration from the time US troops entered
 Cambodia,,
 Despite their strong verbal attacks on US ac-
 tions in Cambodia, the Chinese will probably be
 ready to resume the talks once US forces have with-
 drawn,   They have been careful to point out that a
 new date for the next meeting will be arranged
 through the normal diplomatic mechanism in Warsaw,
 and they definitely view the negotiations as an
 important source of much-needed political leverage
 in the dispute with the USSR.   Moreover, their pub-
 lic statement announcing that the meeting on 20 May
 had been postponed was couched in much milder lan-
 guage than a similar announcement in February 1969,

 USSR - Communist China:   Moscow has answered
 recent C hinese-poem cs w th a scathing, tit-for?-
 tat indictment of Peking's policies.
 An editorial in Pravda yesterday marked the
 USSR's most sweeping and authoritative condemnation
 of China since the Sino-Soviet border talks began
 last fall.   The editorial laid out Moscow's response
 to the anti-Soviet blast which Peking timed for the
 Lenin centennial last month.   The Chinese directly
 castigated Brezhnev and clearly hit raw nerves in
 the Kremlin.
 The Pravda article retaliated with personal
 invective ag inaina   st Mao Tse-tung and contained a long
 list of charges against him ranging from his irre-
 sponsible views on the inevitability of war and the
 militarization of China to his economic malfeasance
 and "forcible assimilation" of national minorities
 in border areas.   Using the familiar Soviet conten-
 tion that Peking's obstructionist and devisive ac-
 tivity weakens Socialist unity and thereby encourages
 imperialist aggression, Pravda implicitly laid on
 Peking's doorstep the blame for "the latest events
 in Indochina."   The Soviets can be expected to ring
 many changes on this theme over the next several
 weeks.
 Pravda used unusually specific language in de-
 nouncing            attempts to "undermine relations
 of alliance between members of the Warsaw Treaty."
 This reflects Moscow's extreme sensitivity to any
 design Peking may have to intrude into the USSR's
 East European preserve at a time when the Soviets
 are accelerating their own efforts to achieve a
 measure of bloc solidarity against China.
 The editorial made explicit reference to Pe-
 king's "unfounded territorial claims" and charged
 the Chinese with provoking border conflicts.   Pravda,

 however, avoided implying any recent change in the
 presently quiet military situation on the frontier,
 With respect to the Peking talks, Pravda reiterated
 the necessity for reaching an agreement, indicating
 that the article should be regarded as a statement
 of principle and not as an attempt to jeopardize
 Moscow's continuing interest in pursuing the talks.

 France:  A controversy involving the French
 Communist Party (PCF) will probably impair its cur-
 rent efforts to form an alliance with the non-Commu-
 nist left and further reduce its influence among
 youth.
 The controversy stems from the recent revela-
 tion by French Communist dissidents that the PCF has
 supplied the Czechoslovak Government with a document
 that allegedly "betrays" former premier Alexander
 Dubcek and could be used against him in a trial.
 The document is the transcript of a conversation be-
 tween Dubcek and PCF Secretary General Waldeck Rochet
 that took place just two months before the Soviet
 invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
 In response to questions from Rochet, Dubcek
 reportedly expressed little concern about either the
 possible formation in Czechoslovakia of a social
 democratic party or the activities of anti-Soviet
 groups.   These statements have been cited by
 some Czechoslovak party leaders as demonstrating
 Dubcek's "irresponsible" behavior.
 The present controversy poses serious problems
 for Georges Marchais, deputy to the ailing Rochet
 and the effective leader of the PCF.   Party dissi-
 dents,  led by the maverick Communist Roger Garaudy,
 who was recently ousted both from the politburo and
 his local party cell,  can claim with some justice
 that the PCF's decision to release the Rochet-Dubcek
 transcript to Prague is stoking the fires of Stalin-
 ism in Czechoslovakia, and is indicative of the basic
 Stalinist tendencies of the French party.
 The incident will also adversely affect the
 PCF's campaign to forge a new unity on the left.
 The Socialist Party would be the PCF's major partner
 in such an alliance, but the incident will strengthen
 the hand of those Socialists who oppose closer coop-
 eration with the Communists.

 EURATOM-IAEA:   The  five EURATOM members who
 have signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty
 apparently have reached an impasse with France
 on satisfying the treaty's safeguard require-
 ments.
 At the EURATOM Council meeting last week,
 France again refused to agree to a mandate for
 the Commission to open the negotiations with the
 International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA)  re-
 quired by the NPT.   French Foreign Minister Schu-
 mann told the other members that France did not
 believe an agreement could be reached that would
 not involve IAEA interference with EURATOM's own
 safeguards system. Because this would be con-
 trary to the EURATOM treaty, France would no
 longer feel bound to mandatory compliance with
 EURATOM's own inspection procedures.   The other
 members and the Commission disagree with the
 French position,  and the precise reasons why
 Paris has taken it remain unclear.   Should the
 French refuse to budge, the ensuing discord
 would severely strain EURATOM and embarrass some
 of the member governments.
 Even if the present deadlock is broken,
 there is an increasing possibility that the
 differences within EURATOM and the strategy of
 the Communist states will complicate any IAEA-
 EURATOM negotiations.   The East Europeans are
 pushing for a position that would support a com-
 prehensive IAEA role in the inspection of the
 facilities of nonnuclear weapon states.

 I Bolivia:   The army is renewing pressure on
 President Ovando to remove leftists from the cabinet.
 The cabinet met yesterday to consider the
 latest armed forces demand after Minister of Plan-
 ning and Coordination Jose Ortiz Mercado allegedly
 made statements that he was a Communist.   The left-
 ist radicals in the cabinet, minister of Energy
 Quiroga and Minister of Information Bailey, have
 been the targets of the army generals for some
 months.   According to an unconfirmed press report
 from La Paz, Quiroga resigned during the cabinet's
 deliberations.
 If the President refuses to make more than the
 minor cabinet readjustments carried out last week,
 the military may well mov  to oust him.

 Peru:   The cabinet is considering a new law
 that would discourage foreign investment and may
 force out some US companies.
 The proposed law calls for "decisive Peruvian
 participation" in foreign-owned industrial oper-
 ations after recovery of capital and a "reason-
 able profit."  The minister of industry and com-
 merce said that private or public Peruvian par-
 ticipation of at least 51 percent would be ex-
 pected and that an eight-percent annual return
 would be a "good profit" on large investments.
 A ministry official indicated that the law
 would be applied retroactively to foreign firms
 presently in Peru and that recently concluded
 investment contracts would be revised.   These
 statements further dampen an already dismal in-
 vestment climate.
 Although many Latin American countries have
 insisted upon ownership of extractive industries,
 only Mexico has previously applied this policy
 to nonextractive industries.   By limiting foreign
 investors to an arbitrary "reasonable" profit,
 Peru has carried its economic nationalism beyond
 that of other Latin American nations, except
 Cuba.   In this uncertain environment, little
 new foreign investment can be expected, except
 possibly for special copper development deals.
 Moreover, the $19-million artificial fiber
 factory to be built by a West German firm, the
 only significant foreign industrial investment
 to go forward since the 1968 military cou , may
 be delayed indefinitely.

 Colombia:   The government has lifted the state
 of siege and the restrictions placed on losing
 presidential candidate Gustavo Rojas Pinilla.
 The state of siege was imposed nearly a month
 ago to curb post-election disturbances by Rojas'
 followers, who were charging the government with
 electoral fraud.   The disorders were quickly and
 firmly put down, however,  and the country has
 since remained calm.
 The government's candidate, Misael Pastrana,
 will be inaugurated in August.   The official
 vote count is expected to be completed in early
 June.   Because he won by only a slim margin and
 lacks popular appeal, Pastrana will probably have
 difficulty in maintaining the relative tranquility
 that characterized President Lleras'  term of
 office.

 Guinea:   President Sekou Tours efforts to
 fashion a rapprochement with Ivory Coast and with
 France are evoking positive responses.
 In March, Toure invited France and Ivory Coast
 to send delegations to Guinea's annual cultural fes-
 tival, and both accepted.   Later that month, an un-
 publicized trip to Abidjan by a Guinean delegation
 was followed up by a return visit by Ivory Coast
 officials.   Toure's latest move came in a speech
 last week, when he extended an olive branch to
 France and told the visiting Ivorian officials that
 "our duty is to work for complete reconciliation
 between our two nations."
 These actions reverse previous Guinean policy,
 which has been critical of France and has long char-
 acterized Ivorian President Houphouet-Boigny as a
 stooge of French imperialism in Africa.   Toure's
 primary goal is to improve relations with Paris,
 but he realizes that this requires a reconciliation
 with Houphouet-Boigny because of the latter's in-
 fluence with the French.   Toure would like the
 French to resume technical aid and to release the
 more than $25 million owed to Guinea for veterans'
 payments that had been blocked since November 1965
 when charges of French involvement in anti-Toure
 plotting led to severance of relations.
 The reaction of Ivory Coast to Toure's initia-
 tives has been warm,   Government-controlled media
 in Abidjan headlined Toure?s  recent speech and pre-
 dicted that normalization of relations "is no longer
 distant."  French reaction has been more cautious,
 but it has also been essentially positive.   Follow-
 ing the return of French officials from Conakry in
 March, France agreed to release part of the payments
 owed to Guinean veterans

 Laos:  Military commanders in the southern
 panhandle are bracing for a North Vietnamese assault
 against the provincial capital of Saravane, which
 they expect shortly.   With reports circulating of
 three North Vietnamese battalions advancing on the
 town, the remainder of an already nervous populace
 has fled to a nearby government outpost.   In the
 north,  the situation in the Long Tieng area remains
 Latin America:   Uruguay has. rejected US-Soviet
 proposals to hold a conference on law of the sea
 matters, including the extent of territorial waters
 and fishing rights.    An Uruguayan Foreign Ministry
 official told the US Embassy on 15 May that Uru-
 guay's territorial sea zone of 200 miles is national
 law and not subject to foreign discussion.   He
 stated that the Uruguayan limit has precedent in
 similar claims by eight other Latin American coun-
 tries and indicated that some of the others con-
 cerned would re ].   in the same manner.
 Costa Rica: The new Figueres administration
 has made its dust move to improve relations with
 Eastern Europe by establishing diplomatic relations
 with Hungary.   Both ambassadors will be resident
 elsewhere,  as is the arrangement with Poland.   Fi-
 gueres, who was inaugurated on 8 May, is expected
 to formalize relations with the USSR and perhaps
 other East European countries in the near future.
 Costa Rica already has consular relations with
 Czechoslovakia.   The Polish trade mission, which
 has been in San Jose' for four years,  closed its
 office on 1 May because the commercial arrangement
 had not been profitable.
