 Foreign Trade in 1974
 China's foreign trade boors fell victim in 1974
 to the growing problems of the world economy. Total
 trade increased only 27 percent,  to roughly $12.5
 billion, well below the 67-percent increase in 1973.
 Most of the increase is attributable to higher prices,
 with little or no growth in volume. Worldwide infla-
 tion pushed up China's import bill while the economic
 slowdown in the West cut demand for Chinese exports,
 resulting in the largest trade deficit in China's
 history--perhaps $1 billion with the non-Communist
 world, and despite a surplus with the Communist world,
 about $750 million overall.
 Despite these difficulties, China's balance of
 payments is not in crisis. Reserves are well in excess
 of the trade deficit, the level of foreign debt is
 manageable, and Peking's credit rating is excellent.
 China began taking steps to relieve the financial
 squeeze last fall. Contracts for agricultural products
 were deferred or cancelled. Fertilizer deliveries were
 postponed. Peking also increased its use of short- and
 medium-term credits and sold a portion of its gold
 holdings.
 Trade with the non-Communist countries posted
 the largest gains, accounting for almost 85 percent of
 China's total trade.  Imports from the developed West
 shot up to about $5 billion from $3.4 billion in 1973,
 largely due to increased purchases of agricultural prod-
 ucts and machinery. China's deficit with the developed
 countries was roughly $2.5 billion.
 Sino-Japanese trade jumped 50 percent, to over
 $3 billion.  China's imports, boosted by sizable deliv-
 eries of machinery and equipment, exceeded exports by

 more than $500 million. China's exports of 4 million
 tons of crude oil worth about $380 million more than
 offset the decline in its traditional exports to Japan.
 US-China trade totaled $922 million, a smaller
 increase than anticipated at mid-year because China
 cancelled contracts for US grain worth about $300 mil-
 lion.                                Wheat, corn, cotton, soybeans, and other agri-
 cultural products composed   about. 80 percent of total
 US exports of $807 million. US machinery and equipment
 exports rose as delivery began on, equipment for the
 ammonia plants purchased in 1973 and the second half
 of the $150 million Boeing contract was completed.
 Growing purchases of cotton textiles helped boost US
 imports of Chinese goods to $115 million, up from $64
 million in 1973.
 US-China trade encountered several problems last
 year. Chinese complaints over the quality of US grain
 caused delays in wheat shipments and the cancellation
 of soybean contracts. US controls on scrap steel ex-
 ports prevented delivery on several contracts.   On the
 import side, shipments of Chinese shrimp were rejected
 by the Food and Drug Administration, and the Chinese
 at the fall Canton Fair were more vocal about the lack
 of most-favored-nation status for their exports.
 Purchases of agricultural products, machinery,
 and transport equipment were largely responsible for
 the growth of China's total imports.   China contracted
 for almost 10 million tons of grain in 1974, but ship-
 ping delays and contract cancellations dropped actual
 deliveries to just. over 7 million tons, down from 7.7
 million in 1973. Higher grain prices, however, pushed
 the cost up to over $1 billion.  Imports of soybeans and
 cotton were up substantially from 1973.   Machinery and
 equipment imports rose sharply as large-scale deliveries
 began on the $2.5 billion worth of whole plants and
 other equipment ordered in 1973.

 Peking signed contracts for $900 million worth
 of whole plants in 1974--down from the record $1.2
 billion level in 1973.  Rapid inflation and tight
 world credit markets, plus China's need for a breath-
 ing spell to absorb the large amount of technology
 already purchased, were the ma-jor reasons for the
 slowdown in purchases. Contracts worth $550 million
 for the Wu-han steel rolling complex composed much
 of the purchases, with the balance going for addi-
 tional synthetic fiber, fertilizer, and electric-
 power plants. Negotiations continue for a number of
 :Large plants, and new inquiries are being made for
 additional facilities. In contrast to the whole-plant
 program, major purchases of machinery and equipment
 in 1974 were off sharply from the record level of 1973.
 China's exports rose by roughly $1 billion in
 1974; petroleum accounted for almost half of the in-
 crease.   Sales of crude oil and petroleum products to
 Japan, the Philippines, Hong Kong,  and Thailand amounted
 to about 4.5 million tons worth $440 million.   Rice ex-
 ports benefited from high prices, but other traditional
 Chinese, exports, particularly silk and cotton textiles,
 faced declining demand.   Late in the year, even petro-
 leum exports met with problems when Japanese buyers,
 pleading full storage tanks, refused to take delivery
 of 900,000 tons of crude oil under a 1974 contract.
 The outlook for China's trade in 1975 is for
 slower growth as Peking attempts to reduce its trade
 deficit. Export growth will be small, reflecting poor
 sales of traditional products at the 1974 Canton fairs
 and recession-weakened demand in the West.   An expected
 doubling of petroleum exports may do little more than
 offset the decline in other exports.
 Imports of machinery and equipment will be sub-
 stantial as large-scale deliveries continue on 1973
 and 1974 contracts.   The successful 1974 harvest and

 declining textile exports will permit cutbacks in
 grain and cotton imports.   Other, less essential
 imports will be curtailed and the pace of new plant
 contracts may slow further.
 Sino-US trade in 1975 will be down, perhaps to
 less than $500 million.   Recent cancellations of con-
 tracts for US wheat and possibly cotton will severely
 curtail US agricultural exports unless large purchases
 are made later this year.    (CONFIDENTIAL)

 Cracking Down in Kwangtung
 25X1A
 Kwangtung leaders have finally cracked down on
 protesting workers and youths, ending the periodic
 disturbances that have plagued Canton since last fall.
 Demobilized soldiers employed as factory workers have
 been protesting discrimination in wage and bonus poli-
 cies.   Youth have been lashing out at the down-to-the-
 countryside program and the limited job and educational
 opportunities afforded them.   (See Chinese Affairs, De-
 cember 9,  1974.)
 After a clash in late November between protest-
 ing workers and Canton garrison troops, Kwangtung
 party boss Chao Tzu-yang banned all. further demon-
 strations and stationed militia units in each street
 to maintain order.   The militia enforced new restric-
 tions on poster criticisms, updated street registers
 to nab youths dodging the down-to-the-countryside
 program, and conducted criticism sessions for the
 most vocal dissidents.   A program of study sessions
 for the city's workers was instituted, and on January
 15 the demobilized soldiers issued a statement pledg-
 ing to comply with party policy and end all wage protests.
 Until the November incident, Kwangtung authorities
 had been steering a middle course, attempting only to
 rea-son with the unhappy workers and keep their demon-
 strations orderly.
 One reason Kwangtung did not adopt a "get tough"
 attitude earlier was because there was no consistent
 signal from Peking on how to deal with the problem.
 Despite the general emphasis in the national media
 since July on law and order, some articles seemed to
 sanction resistance to local authorities.   Some moder-
 ates in Canton apparently also believed that the pro-
 testers had the support of Chiang Ching and other radi-
 cals in Peking.

 Peking finally clarified its position last week
 in a People's  ')ai ly editorial and a series of arti-
 cles in Red El:czq,  the party's theoretical journal.
 The articles struck out at workers, among others, who
 are corrupted oy capitalist ideas and are in danger
 of succumbing to a "bourgeois lifestyle."   The arti-
 cles made it clear that future disturbances or work
 slowdowns would not be tolerated.
 Now other provincial leaders are likely to move
 to clamp down on their. dissidents.   Worker and youth
 problems have been widespread, and many areas have
 experienced an increase in crime.    Ningsia and Yunnan
 have also had problems with. their Muslim minorities.
 Many middle-level. cadre may find the People's
 Daily editorial and the Red Flag articles unnerving,
 since much of the tough language condemning bureau-
 cratic behavior could easily be directed against them.
 Cadre morale problems have been aggravated by the anti-
 Confucius campaign.
 According to                 Kwangtung leaders were
 disturbed to find in the course of their investigation
 into the protests that many party cadre and "progres-
 sive workers and youths"--not just. the usual rowdies
 and malcontents--were deeply involved.   A plot by 20
 factory cadres to escape to Hong Kong with the assist-
 ance of some militia members was discovered, according
 to                        A Public Security cadre reportedly
 was among    ose w o put up posters under a pseudonym
 attacking everything from special privileges to the
 sanctity of Mao's thought.
 Although apparently successful in curbing expres-
 sions of worker and youth discontent, leaders at all
 levels have been slow in coming to grips with its
 causes.                                           however, indicates

 that an effort may be under way now.   In at least
 one factory, promotion and job opportunities for
 junior workers have been improved, and workers
 even expect a wage increase for apprentices and
 lower grade employees  "in the near future."   (SE-

 Vice Foreign Minister Han Nien-lung apparently
 has replaced, at least temporarily, Vice Foreign
 Minister Yu Chan as chief Chinese negotiator in the
 Sino-Soviet border talks.   Han greeted Soviet ne-
 gotiator Ilichev on his arrival at Peking airport
 on February 12, and a Tass dispatch termed Han the
 new head of the Chinese delegation.
 Peking has not announced Yu Chan's whereabouts,
 but a Yugoslav press service ascribed Yu's six-week
 absence from public view to illness.   Yu has been
 in charge of Soviet and East European affairs in
 the Foreign Ministry for some time, and the Yugo-
 slavs could well be informed of his situation.
 Han, who is the senior vice foreign minister,
 led the delegation for a brief period beginning in
 late 1971 when Chiao F:uan-hua, who was then chief
 negotiator and is now foreign minister, left to
 lead the newly admitted Chinese delegation to the
 UN General Assembly/.   Yu Chan took over in the
 spring of 1972 following his promotion from de-
 partment head to vice minister in the Foreign
 Ministry.
 In the past, Peking has consistently rejected
 Soviet proposals to hold the talks at the expert
 or working level, insisting that the permanent heads
 at the vice minister level be present.  Thus, Han--
 who has long been associated with Asian affairs
 and has had very little to do with the USSR--may
 again be filling in temporarily, as he did in 1971-
 1972, until Yu Chan: returns or another official of
 suitable experience and rank is available.

 Han's tenure as chief Chinese negotiator, how-
 ever long it lasts, almost certainly has no bearing
 on Peking's negotiating position.   The Chinese have
 made it clear publicly and privately that they are
 in no mood to strike a deal with Moscow.   Indeed,
 Peking may even have signalled that its attitude
 toward a settlement has hardened.   After years of
 public silence, China has recently presented its
 terms for a border agreement on three occasions--
 the last in Chou En-lai's NPC speech--conditions
 that the Chinese first tabled in late 1969 and that
 the Soviets have subsequently rejected several times.

 Attacks on the Military Toned Down
 Peking's annual "support the army" circular,
 which routinely calls on the citizenry to support
 the military and enjoins the armed forces to cherish
 the government and the people, has often been a
 yardstick to measure the army's political standing.
 In Lin Piao's heyday,  the army was praised as a
 "pillar of the proletarian dictatorship," but such
 praise has not been used in the circular for the
 past two years. This year's edition gives some strong
 hints as to the course that party-army relations
 will follow in the short term, but, like many of-
 ficial pronouncements in China,  the message is ex-
 pressed more by what is left out than by what is said.
 Because the circular is such a bland and non-
 committal document,  it suggests that civilian mod-
 erates in Peking prefer to avoid an open confronta-
 tion with the military, at least for the moment.
 This does not mean that efforts to reduce the po-
 litical power of the People's Liberation Army will
 be phased out, but only that civilian authorities
 apparently believe direct and less visible tactics
 may prove more successful over the long run.
 Each province? military region, and military
 district usua.'.1y issues its own circular. The first
 circular issued by a military region contained an
 outspoken cal.1 for army obedience to party authority,
 and appeared to be a continuation of Peking's rela-
 tively hard line attacks on military political
 power. This document, broadcast in the Tsinan Mil-
 itary Region on December 16, said that military
 headquarters and units must "regard themselves as
 departments of military affairs of local party
 committees at the same level" and consciously accept
 the leadership of these committees. Moreover, the

 Tsinan circular stated that field armies must accept
 the leadership of the provincial party committees, a
 new theme obviously aimed at strengthening party au-
 thority over a rather hard-to-reach group--troops in
 the field.
 Since the Tsinan statement turned out to be the
 most far-reaching issued by any military region,  it
 may have been a trial balloon. The circulars issued
 by other military regions varied significantly.
 Some supported Tsinan by ordering units under their
 command to "obey" party authorities, but others
 said only that it was necessary to "respect" local
 party committees. A few regions did not comment
 at all on this subtle but sensitive difference.
 When Peking issued its circular,  it also ducked
 the issue. Moreover, the circular was broadcast on
 January 31,  almost a month later than in the past
 three years, when Peking's issuance usually set the
 tone for the provincial circulars which followed.
 Resistance to the extreme position taken by Tsinan
 was almost certainly the major reason why Peking
 did not follow up on the issue,  and appears to
 explain why Peking's circular was so late.
 Provincial radiobroadcasts seem to reflect the
 obvious lack of accord.  Some broadcasts extol mil-
 itary units that have sought guidance from party
 and government authorities, but the theme has not
 been heavily stressed.
 There are other straws in the wind. On February 3,
 Shantung reported that Tsinan Military Region com-
 mander Tseng Ssu-yu "presided over" a rally to transmit
 the results of the National People's Congress and the
 party plenum that preceded it. The rally was co-sponsored
 by the provincial party committee and the party com-
 mittee of the Tsinan Military Region.  It is not unusual
 for lower ranking leaders to preside over rallies,
 and provincial party first secretary Pai Ju-ping,
 a civilian, was present and gave the major address.

 TOE' SECRET UMBRA
 Since Tseng is, not known to hold a provincial
 party post, his prominence may be explained by the
 fact that the rally was co-sponsored by the Tsinan
 Military Region party committee, on which he does
 hold a high post.   Nonetheless, it is highly unusual
 for a military region commander to preside over a major
 political rally.   Since Tsi_nan was the author of the
 most anti-military "support the army"  circular, Tseng's
 prominent appearance is especially important.   There
 are at least two plausible interpretations.
 One explanation is that Peking is indicating
 support for Tseng because of his willingness to go
 along with efforts to reduce the political power of
 provincial military men. The other is that Peking is
 tacitly admitting that--for the moment at least--it
 has failed to force its will on provincial soldiers.
 Tseng's role at the Tsinan rally may indicate that
 an olive branch is being offered to the military,
 and that the relatively harsh tactics pursued by
 Peking prior to the National People's Congress are
 no longer in order.
 In any event, in the short term Peking is appar-
 ently soft-pedaling direct attacks on the military.
 Articles attacking Lin's erroneous military line are
 becoming less frequent,  for example.
 The door has by no means been closed, however,
 to a resumption of confrontation tactics at a later
 date.   Recent fed FZaq and People's Daily articles
 calling for continuing efforts to strengthen the
 dictatorship of the proletariat emphasize that class
 enemies still exist "within the party" and that these
 enemies tend to collude with foreign revisionists.
 Persons such as Peking Military Region commander Chen
 Hsi-lien were attacked through historical analogy on
 precisely these grounds as recently as last fall.

 The potential danger of this line of attack
 has certainly not been lost on.interested parties
 involved in the debate that preceded the National
 People's Congress. A Peking domestic broadcast on
 January 27 recounting the activities of an anti-
 chemical-warfare unit in Chekiang--a unit that has
 been closely associated with Chiang Ching in the
 campaign to criticize Lin and Confucius--noted
 that criticism of Lin's military line "is by no
 means aimed at investigating the individual's
 personal responsibility." This suggests that the
 political left sees dangers in unbridled attacks
 on military figures,  some of whom probably have
 recently had a working relationship with the ide-
 ologues.
 Peking will probably continue its carrot-and-
 stick approach to the military,  using pressure and
 persuasion to ease soldiers out of party posts.
 For those who see the light, there may be rewards.
 Chang Chung, who became military district commander
 in Kansu during the Cultural Revolution, is
 still the top-ranking party secretary there.   Chang
 was recently ranked ahead of three newly identified
 secretaries, at least two of whom are civilians.
 Chang's military title has not been mentioned
 publicly since October 1973, however,  and he may have
 taken off his uniform in order to hold onto his party
 job.   It is possible that a number of provincial lead-
 ers with military backgrounds will follow this same
 course.   Some military men may be persuaded to go the
 other way.   Wuhan Military Region commander Yang Te-
 chih,                              for example, appears to have dropped out of the
 running for a top party post in Hupeh.   Yang had
 headed some turnouts in which party and military
 leaders were lumped together, but in late January he
 was listed with his military title and apart from
 provincial party leaders.   (CONFIDENTIAL)

 Wrangling with Moscow over Tokyo
 Chinese Ambassador Chen Chu's return to Tokyo
 on February _`i, after a week of consultations in
 Peking, touched off a spate of pessimistic rumors
 in Tokyo about prospects for the proposed Sino-
 Japanese peace and friendship treaty.   Although
 the Chinese have yet to spell out. positions on
 specific issues that are likely to come up in the
 treaty negotiations, the Japanese press has specu-
 lated that Chen brought back a hard line from Peking.
 Much of the rumormongering in Tokyo apparently
 stems from a concerted Soviet effort to slow the
 quickening pace of closer Sino-Japanese ties.   Last
 week, Soviet Ambassador Troyanovsky delivered a
 letter from Party chief Brezhnev to Prime Minister
 Miki proposing that talks on a Soviet-Japanese
 friendship treaty begin soon.   Troyanovsky earlier
 made highly publicized representations to Liberal
 Democratic Party  (LDP)  and government leaders in
 Tokyo,  suggesting that agreement on the treaty with
 Peking would have an undesirable influence on Tok o's
 relations with Moscow.   According to
 the Soviets also provided pro-Taiwan ele-
 ments in the LDP with arguments against the proposed
 peace treaty and leaked distorted accounts of Foreign
 Minister Miyazawa's recent meeting with Gromyko in
 Moscow.
 The Chinese response to Soviet "meddling" has
 been sharp, reflecting the urgency Peking attaches
 to reinforcina Sino-Japanese relations with the
 peace treaty.   Both NCNA and the PRC-owned Ta Kung
 Pao in Hong Kong ran lengthy attacks on the Soviets
 for their "interferences" in Japan's internal af~=airs.
 The NCNA account argued that Moscow's concern over
 the Sino-Japanese treaty was a smokescreen to cover
 the Soviets'  "illecral occupation" of Japan's northern

 territories.   Other Chinese press reports have
 recounted alleged Soviet mistreatment of Japanese
 fishermen in that area.   NCNA has also continued
 to broadcast accounts claiming widespread popular
 support in Japan for the treaty with China.
 Both the Japanese and Chinese appear to be
 approaching the treaty negotiations with confidence
 that it can be concluded quickly.   Both sides
 have agreed not to bring up the potentially con-
 tentious territorial questions of Taiwan and the
 Senkaku Islands until after the peace pact is signed.
 No other important unresolved bilateral issues ap-
 pear likely to slow agreement on the treaty.  Poten-
 tial problems raised by the Japanese press--such as
 the earlier peace agreement reached between the
 Japanese and the Chinese Nationalists, or the
 existence of implicit anti-Japanese language in the
 1950 Sino-Soviet friendship treaty--are molehills
 that are not likely to become mountains.   Explana-
 tions for Peking's sharp reaction to Soviet attempts
 to exacerbate relations between Tokyo and Peking,
 therefore, must be sought elsewhere.
 There are signs that at least some Chinese
 leaders believe the new Miki administration will
 not hold firm over the long term to the general
 foreign policy lines laid down by former prime min-
 ister Tanaka, especially regarding Japan's good
 relations with China and the US.   Liao Cheng-chih,
 chairman of Peking's Sino-Japanese Friendship As-
 sociation, told a visiting Japanese in late De-
 cember that the "pro-Soviet tendencies" of some
 important members of the new administration in
 Tokyo made it impossible for China to be as trust-
 ful of Miki as it had been of Tanaka.   Liao said
 that the LDP was riddled with pro-Soviet elements
 on the one hand and with Taiwan "lobbyists" on the
 other.   Liao also expressed concern that relations
 between Japan and the US would decline under Miki

 and that Japan would make irrevocable concessions,
 especially on the northern territories issue, in
 order to improve relations with the Soviets.
 If these fears of long-range Japanese foreign
 policy instability are genuine--and they probably
 are--it would be to Peking's advantage to obtain
 Miki's commitment to continue the momentum of im-
 proving relations with the PRC as quickly as possi-
 ble.                             Institutionalizing close Sino-Japanese relations
 through a peace and, friendship treaty would be a
 major step in that direction.
 Successful conclusion of the treaty would also
 cast into sharp relief Peking's rapid progress in
 developing closer ties with Tokyo over the past
 two years, while pointing up Moscow's relative
 lack of movement since it opened relations with
 Tokyo in 1956.   The Soviets' recent clumsy attempts
 to create irritants in Sino-Japanese relations
 presented Peking with an. ideal opportunity to make
 this point.   Virtually all of the Chinese press
 attention to the Soviet campaign has focused on
 issues unrelated to the treaty negotiations--such
 as Soviet "hecemoni.sm" in the Pacific and Soviet
 "bullying" of the Japanese.  (SECRET NO FOREIGN

 Babies Are Peking's Business
 Since the beginning of February,  several prov-
 inces have referred to "recent" instructions from
 Peking regarding birth control.   Late last year, pro-
 vincial broadcasts mentioned a national conference on
 planned parenthood.   The latest instructions from the
 center on this issue undoubtedly grew out of last
 year's conference.
 In November,                                            hat
 Directive 27 from the Central Committee listed a par-
 tial agenda for the National People's Congress.                                   In-
 cluded on the agenda was a reaffirmation of the strin-
 gent birth control policies that have been in effect
 for the past two years.   These measures include the
 promotion of late marriage by denying permission to
 marry if the couple has not reached the stipulated
 age, reportedly over 27 for men and over 25 for women.
 An even harsher measure to control population growth
 is to deny food-ration coupons for a fourth child.
 dicate that medical teams have been sent to rural
 areas, where birth control measures have met with lim-
 ited success, to perform compulsory sterilization on
 couples with three children.   These forceful measures
 apparently are less necessary in urban areas because
 the more sophisticated city dwellers have been more
 cooperative in following birth control policies.
 Objections to stringent birth control measures
 surfaced in broadcasts from Kiangsu Province during
 the summer of 1973, but while these measures probably
 remain unpopular in the rural areas, no further com-
 plaints have appeared in provincial propaganda.   When
 the public objections were first raised, it was thought

 that then Kiangsu party boss Hsu Shih-yu, a mili-
 tary man and member of the Politburo, was behind
 them.   In any event, the complaints have evidently
 had no impact on Peking's determination to slow
 the growth of China's enormous population.
 Another vehicle used by the government to empha-
 size the importance of birth control was the creation
 in September 1973 of a special birth planning group
 under the State Council.   Until that time, birth con-
 trol came under the auspices of the Ministry of
 Health.    The birth planning group has not been men-
 tioned publicly since 1974, however, and none of the
 other groups under the State Council have been re-
 ferred to in Chinese propaganda since the National
 People's Cong=ress.
 With the emphasis on sound economic planning in
 Chou En-lai's speech at the National People's Congress,
 Peking obviously is anxious to prevent the growing pop-
 ulation from eating up future economic gains.   Logi-
 cally, one way to drive home the importance of birth
 control to the reluctant rural population would be to
 maintain the birth planning group as a separate entity,
 with its previous special status.   Regardless of
 whether Pekinq does in fact resort to this system, it
 is clear that firm, often mandatory birth control meas-
 ures are here to stay.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM)

 France and China apparently have agreed in
 principle on a visit to Paris this spring by Vice
 Premier. Teng Hsiao-ping. No official announcement
 has been made, but French diplomats and correspond-
 ents have been freely spreading news of the trip for
 some time,  and Peking has not discouraged this ac-
 tivity.
 Teng would be the most senior Chinese official
 to visit France;  the foreign and foreign trade
 ministers have made official visits to Paris, but
 Peking has not reciprocated President Pompidou's
 trip to China 18 months ago.
 This would be Teng's first state visit since
 his rehabilitation almost two years ago, and thus a
 feather in France's cap that does not seem entirely
 warranted by the state of Sino-French relations or
 by the importance of Paris to Chinese policy. The
 joint communique following Pompidou's trip reflected
 sharp differences over French detente with the USSR
 and over Chinese views on European political, eco-
 nomic,                       and military cohesion.   For some time, Peking
 has been dismayed over displays of French independ-
 ence in Atlantic alliance affairs, which the Chinese
 believe give Moscow comfort. Teng, who was in Paris
 last April en route to Peking from a special UN ses-
 sion, passed up an opportunity to attend Pompidou's
 funeral,  leaving China under-represented.
 More recently, the French have indicated dis-
 pleasure at Chinese slights. According to -
