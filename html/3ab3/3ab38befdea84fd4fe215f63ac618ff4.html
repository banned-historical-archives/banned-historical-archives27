 18 November 1963
 SUBJECT:   Recent Soviet Tactics in the Sino-Soviet Dispute
 Summary
 The open attack on the Chinese leaders in mid-July
 1963--primarily an attempt to place the CPSU in a better
 position to induce obedience in its camp--has provided Thru-
 shchev with a new advantage in the polemics but has not
 stopped the spread of Chinese influence in independent
 parties.   The Soviet leader has made an apparent gain in
 partially disarming the damaging Chinese doctrinal argument,
 making the Chinese look more chauvinistic than ever before
 in the eyes of Soviet supporters and thereby balancing off
 the image of the CPSU as a party led by revisionists with
 an image of the CCP as one led by hardboiled, self-seeking
 nationalists.   However, his effort to assert discipline
 among lukewarm Soviet supporters probably has been no more
 successful than his earlier attempt following the 22nd CPSU
 congress.   Since late 1961, and particularly in 1963, formal
 splits in some parties have confronted the Soviet factions
 with organizationally distinct and independent opposition
 groups (or parties); the Chinese are using these newly formed
 groups--now members of their minority camp--as organizational
 rallying points for various types of anti-Soviet dissidents.
 Chinese pressure and Soviet moves toward a friendlier rela-
 tionship with the U.S. have driven at least one  on-balance
 Chinese supporter.,, the Vietnamese party, to side more un-
 equivocally with the CCP.  The Russians are increasingly
 compelled to use varying degrees of delicacy and to make
 concessions to other on-balance Chinese supporters to prevent

 further erosion of Soviet influence among them.  Their
 inability to gain wide acceptance of a formal joint anti-
 Chinese declaration, which would be drafted at an inter-
 national conference of parties, appears to be the major
 consideration in the Soviet decision to avoid such a con-
 ference at this time, and their next move may be to engage
 the Chinese in bilateral talks--the lesser of two evils.
 Recent Soviet Tactics in the Sino-Soviet Dispute
 In the course of the Sino-Soviet dispute prior to mid-
 .1964 the Chinese scored more effectively than the Russians
 in the polemics during each of the vigorous stages of re-
 crimination.   The massive Soviet initiative carried forward
 at party congresses of Khrushchev's major allies--the Bul-
 garian in November 1962, the Hungarian also in November,
 the Italian in December, the Czech also in December, and
 the East German attended by Khrushchev in January 1963--failed
 to silence the Chinese.  On the contrary,  it spurred the
 Chinese leaders to another counter-attack,  implicitly but
 effectively directed against Khrushchev's revisionism and
 "betrayal" of the cause of world revolution.  The Chinese
 declared in February 1963 that the attempt of "certain com-
 rades" to attack the CCP and then call for an immediate
 halt to polemics in order to prevent the CCP from respond-
 ing "will never work."  That is, they refused to provide
 Khrushchev with the respite he desired from their damaging
 attacks and with the tactical advantage of saying the last
 word (at the East German congress in January) and then call-
 ing for bilateral talks (in the CPSU letter in February).
 As their counter-attack developed following receipt of the
 February letter from the CPSU,  the Chinese leaders seemed
 considerably self-assured that they still had the polemical
 weapons to hurt Khrushchev, and they proceeded to use'them.
 However, Khrushchev opened a new stage in the dispute with
 the publication of the 14 July CPSU "open letter;" ever
 since that stage was opened, the Russians have criticized
 Chinese policies more effectively than at any time during
 the various periods of polemics beginning in April 1960.

 The Russian attack has been facilitated by its new
 directness--open criticism of Mao and of the real Chinese
 motivation in the argument.
 The Russians have moved openly to deny Mao the sanc-
 tuary he has had as a "great" leader and theorist,  above
 public criticism.   (His ideas had been attacked privately
 since mid-1960.)   Ever since the 20th CPSU congress, Soviet
 open attacks on Stalin's personality cult had been only
 implicitly attacks on Mao's.  Not until November 1961 was
 the personality cult "in China" directly attacked, but
 even then in a relatively restrained way, by a Czech leader
 (Siroky), and without folloW-up, as the reference was de-
 leted before it was extensively publicized in the Czech
 press.  Even Khrushchev's indirect dig at Mao--a leader who
 believes he was "sent by God, and that the people are a
 mass who must listen and applaud""--was deleted from the
 public version of his 21 June 1963 speech to the CPSU
 Plenum.  However,  in the July "open letter," the Russians
 questioned Chinese motives in "openly exhalting the person-
 ality cult;" by September, they cited several of Mao's more
 ridiculous statements in a highly critical context; and by
 October, an editorial in Kommunist for the first time ex-
 plicitly linked his name with the personality cult in China
 ("the deification of Mao Tse-tung") and attacked his preten-
 sions to have "created" a distinct ideology ("Mao Tse-tung-
 ism"),               The Soviet effort,  in short, seems to be intended
 not only to heap ridicule on a man who has become a ridiculous
 figure, but also to reduce the international prestige that
 Mao, as a "contributor" to doctrine, has gained for the CCP
 in the last two decades.
 The Russians have made it difficult for the Chinese
 to defend Mao's statements.   The attempt of the Chinese to
 set the record "straight" regarding just what Mao had said
 in his confabulated speech in Moscow in November 1957* was
 decisively turned against them by the Russians in the Soviet

 This is what Mao Tse-tung actually,saide
 "In China construction has not gotten un-
 derway in earnest.   If imperialists impose
 a war, we shall be prepared to terminate
 the construction; let us first have a trial
 of strength and then return to construction."
 It will be clear to everyone that this pro-
 nouncement has an absolutely different mean-
 ing.  What does the call "let us first have
 a trial of strength and then return to con-
 struction" mean?  Is this a call to peace,
 to the struggle for peaceful coexistence?
 In essence this means exactly orientation
 toward an armed conflict, toward a military
 solution of the contradictions between soci-
 alism and capitalism.   And no one would suc-
 ceed in presenting this orientation as a slip
 of the tongue.
 That the Russian effort is apparently considered by the
 Chinese as damaging to Mao's image is suggested by the fact
 that they have not reprinted the Soviet Government State-
 ment thus far, they have refrained from further discussion
 of his November 1957 speech, and they are even wary about
 referring to his platitudinous "paper tiger" concept at this
 time.   In the 21 October 1963 joint People's Daily-Red Flag
 article, they were careful to avoid referring tothe  bi-
 wig" William II as a "paper tiger," resorting to a descrip-
 tion of him as "a snowman in the sun."  The Soviet effort
 to depict Mao as war-crazed has been almost as effective
 as the Chinese effort to demonstrate Khrushchev's complicity
 in Stalin's purges of the mid-1930s.
 The new Soviet attack has concentrated more on actual
 Chinese policies than doctrinal positions.  Whereas in 1961-
 62 the Russian follow-up of Khrushchev's 22nd CPSU congress
 assault on the Albanians was centered primarily on defending
 doctrinal positions which the Chinese were criticizing,
 since July 1963 the Soviets have probed to the roots of
 Chinese political motivation,  first hinting at a purely
 nationalist motivation and then demonstrating the nature
 of the motivation.   Thus, the CPSU has deprived the Chinese
 of the advantage they had gained in 1960 by exposing the

 CCP's "revolutionary" strategy as precisely concordant with
 such national goals as creating pressure on and sustaining
 tension with the U.S. at all times, eventually acquiring
 nuclear weapons, and justifying their actions along the
 Sino-Indian border by denegrating Nehru's claim to be non-
 aligned.  The 14 July Soviet "open letter" first indicated
 that the Russians had decided not to continue the argument
 as though it were merely a matter of doctrinal purity--a
 matter on which they were losing ground--but to turn in-
 stead to the realpolitik behind the Chinese positions, ham-
 mering away at the nationalist motivations:
 ... is it a fact that behind the rumpus about
 the 'world revolution' raised by the Chinese
 comrades there are other goals which have
 nothing in common with revolution?
 The 21-22 September Soviet Government Statement went a step
 further, making the point explicit:   "Facts show that, far
 from advancing the interests of the peoples fighting for
 soc t.alism and national liberation, the Chinese leaders pur-
 sue their own great-power aims."  The October 1963 Kommunist
 editorial made the most extreme accusation:  Peiping 's
 "peculiar... platform... in the sphere of foreign policy is
 an orientation toward maintaining international tension
 which is considered a propitious environment for the real-
 ization of hegemonic plans /among backward countries7 which
 are then camouflaged with slogans of 'world revolution.'"
 The Russians have had no difficulty in demonstrating their
 general thesis when discussing the matter of the partial
 test-ban treaty and the Sino-Indian border dispute, effec-
 tively turning Chinese charges of great-nation chauvinism
 against their originator by giving a "factual" account of
 China's special interests.
 To counter the explicit Chinese charge that the
 Soviet leaders are revisionists, the Russians have made
 the implicit accusation that the Chinese leaders,  in try-
 ing to "amend" Lenin, are in fact revisionists themselves.
 They were quick to turn the assertion made in the 4 March
 1963 Red Flag editorial--the assertion that the united front
 in some countries could include "certain patriotically minded

 kings, princes and aristocrats"--against the sanctimonious
 Chinese, commenting sarcastically in the CPSU "open letter"
 as follows:
 And after this, the leadership of the CCP
 teaches the world Communist movement that
 the proletarian, class approach to the prob-
 lems in hand must never, under any circum-
 stances, be forfeited!
 While you-are-revisionists-too is not a tactically strong
 line of argument, the Russians apparently believe that it
 bolsters their effort to expose the Chinese leaders as op-
 portunists hardly worthy of the self-designated title, "pure"
 Leninists
 Generally, the Chinese responses have not been as
 effective in countering the Russians on policy matters as
 they had been on the debate about Leninism.  They have been
 unable to credibly deny that they have opposed the test-ban
 treaty and attacked the Indians for reasons precisely rele-
 vant to China's interests rather than the interests of the
 entire movement.  When,  in combination with their attack
 on these Chinese policies, the Russians moved to make Mao
 look reckless on the matter of nuclear war and callous on
 the matter of the anticipated "ruins" of civilization, the
 Chinese leaders for the first time since the days of exalta-
 tion over the success of the Long Live Leninism articles
 began to act and speak in a manner which suggested they
 had been maneuvered out of position in the polemical quar-
 rel.   Although they tried to add more weight to their
 ripostes by issuing two statements in August attributed to
 Mao, and directed toward Soviet weak points--i.e., Khru-
 shchev's silence on the U.S. racial issue (Mao's statement
 of 8 August) and the situation in South Vietnam (Mao's

 statement of 29 August),* the international attention these
 statements attracted was soon dissipated as the Russians
 continued to hammer more explicitly on Mao's "urge for war."
 The Chinese leaders' self-confidence in their debating
 ability was sustained as late as 1 September, when Peiping's
 government statement declared:   ""...we hope you will have
 the courage to argue the matter out with us."  When, how-
 ever, by a clever selection of fanatical Chinese statements
 and by subtle distortion, the Russians moved to create an
 image of reckless leadership in China, Peiping's self-as-
 surance began to fall away.  The Chinese began to complain
 that they were being described, unfairly,  as "madmen ob-
 sessed with a war itch" by "Khrushchev and company, who are
 now playing dirty tricks with quotations."**  Almost pa-
 thetically, they suggested that the Russians "should not
 create confusion over the word 'ruins" and keep nagging
 about it," that "It is premature for the evil-doers to be
 beside themselves with joy,"*** and "Why do the Soviet
 leaders deliberately single out the relaxed situation on
 The Sino-Indian border to make such a fuss about? ...do not
 rejoice too soon.   Revolutionary China can never be
 *Mao's statements are not written in his usual lively
 and metaphoric style.  However, we believe they are from
 his own hand, or at least authorized by him.  On two occa-
 sions, Mao has struck out with considerable verve, trying
 to say something new on policy and doctrine (in February
 1957 and March 1958); but on both occasions, he was soon
 compelled to alter significantly or supress his original
 remarks because of disastrous practical consequences,   In
 August 1963, he apparently decided to be cautious and main-
 tain a sober tone, avoiding the type of metaphoric and wild
 assertions which since 1957 have contributed to the inter-
 national image of him as a blunderer.

 isolated."*     A further indication that the Soviet tactic
 begun in mid-July 1963 may have neutralized the previous
 Chinese advantage in the polemic is the Chinese decision
 to reply in an extensive series of articles, rather than
 just one or two.
 Despite gains in the polemic, the Russians have not
 been able to impede the gradual erosion of CPSU hegemony
 in the world Communist movement.  The tactic used in the
 open attack on the Chinese leaders in mid-July 1963 and
 thereafter was primarily an effort by Khrushchev to place
 the CPSU in a better position to induce obedience in its
 camp.   The concluding section of the 14 July Soviet "open
 letter," which discusses the specific splitting activity
 of the Chinese among various Free World parties, suggests
 Khrushchev's concern with Peiping's success thus far and
 his determination to deny the Chinese leaders any further
 *People's Daily,    November 1963
 Chinese depiction of Nehru as a "reactionary" has been
 brushed aside by the Russians as insufficient justification
 for China's policy toward India, and inaccurate in any case.
 The 19 September 1963 Pravda article on the Sino-Indian
 border dispute is a clear-cut attack on Chinese policy.
 It is virtually devoid of doctrinal arguments and grossly
 distorts the Chinese position, attributing to New Delhi
 rather than Peiping a desire to negotiate.   Privately,
 however, Khrushchev has indicated that he knows the real
 positions of both sides.   He told                                      25X6
 that "China wants to talk an  reach

 People's Daily editorial exposes Khrushchev's hypocrisy
 will not d.e     the Russians from pillorying the Chinese on
 the border dispute, and will compel Peiping to remain on
 the defensive regarding the dispute.

 opportunity to expand CCP influence in the movement.  The
 Soviet intention to reverse the trend unfavorable to CPSU
 authority by employing the weapon of open condemnation is
 clear from the following passage in the "open letter:"
 The splitting activity of the Chinese lead-
 ership in the ranks of the international
 Communist movement evokes rightful indigna-
 tion and rebuff by fraternal Marxist-Leninist
 parties.
 The subsequent "rebuff" by various parties showed not so
 much that the Russian camp was still the majority camp--a
 point not denied by the Chinese--but that this majority
 probably has not been increased.   By their own count,* the
 Russian majority is 65:
 Up to this time, already 65 Communist par-
 ties have condemned the views and actions
 of the Chinese splitters in the official
 resolutions of their leading organs and
 have expressed complete solidarity with
 and support for the principled position
 of the CPSU in its struggle for the ideo-
 logical purity of revolutionary theory
 and unity in the Communist ranks.
 However, this figure may not be accurate.   As of mid-November
 1963, the number of parties known to have supported the
 CPSU position in official resolutions, editorials, or spe-
 eches is 53.  The Russians in 1963 may have been no more
 successful in prodding their lukewarm supporters and the
 neutrals into public condemnations of the Chinese than they
 had been in the period 1961-62 following the 22nd CPSU con-
 gress regarding condemnation of the "Albanians."  On the
 contrary, since the congress, the Russians have lost some
 ground in the Venezuelan party, lost more ground in the
 Vietnamese and New Zealand parties, and failed to prevent

 splits in the Belgian, Ecuadoran,  and Australian parties
 from being formalized.*        In the Belgian party, pro-Chinese
 factionalists who were expelled in April 1963 are now us-
 ing Chinese funds and are creating more trouble for the
 Russians as dissidents than before the split.   In the
 Ecuadoran party, formal disciplinary action against the
 Chinese supporters in spring 1963 and government arrest
 of a Soviet supporter (Saad) in July has left the under-
 ground party machine virtually in the control of the pro-
 Peiping group.   In the Australian party, formal action
 against several central committee members in June 1963
 drove the dissidents into a group which, using Chinese funds,
 is now moving to develop a distinct organizational machine
 to compete with the Moscow-oriented party.   In addition
 to the three parties whose formal expulsion of dissidents
 has led to formation of separate opposition groups, the
 Brazilian party, which expelled its "dogmatic group" in
 November 1961,  aTd the Mexican, French, and Italian parties
 are other impor- a.r)t parties in which the Chinese have won
 significant support;  in fact, almost every party in the
 world movement now has a Chinese faction.
 The Russians are troubled by these and prospective
 splits.                                   is reported to have
 stated in August 1963 that the soviet leaders do not want
 a split in the Indian "or any other party," as they believe
 these splits strengthen Peiping's hand, enabling the Chinese
 to claim they have supporters in all countries.                25X1C
 the Soviet leaders were even willing to mace some
 concessions to the leftists in order to preserve the party.
 as a single organization, preventing the Chinese from com-
 pletely influencing any separate organizational group.   It
 is precisely this consideration which now serves as a guide-
 line for the primary Soviet tactical plan directed toward
 handling individual parties which have a strong Chinese
 faction but which are not formally split.
 *Expelled members of   he Paraguayan party apparently
 are also organizing a distinct opposition group (or party)
 loyal to Peiping.

 In their attempt to maintain some degree of Soviet
 influence in these parties, the Russians have been careful
 not to dictate but rather to make concessions, even in the
 face of opposition from CPSU supporters.   For example, when
 Communist members of the Italian delegation to the Congress
 of the Women's International Democratic Federation complained
 to Ponomarev in Moscow in late June 1963 that the Russians
 had not supported the Italians in their denunciation of
 reports submitted by the Japanese and Cuban delegations,
 this Soviet foreign party liaison official described his
 tactics
 `yhe leaders of the CCP are no longer to be
 considered as leaders of a Leninist party.
 They are engaging in a continuous action of
 provocation and of division in the world
 Communist movement.   Our principal concern
 today is to isolate the Chinese.  You /Italian
 Communists7 with your demonstration /ijainst
 the Japanese and Cuban reports7 have,, although
 involuntarily, played the game of the Chinese.
 We agree with you that the Japanese and Cuban
 reports are extremist and have no respect for
 the present historical situation, but we had
 both reports read and approved because if they
 had been rejected also with the vote of the
 USSR and the people's democracies, the Japanese
 and Cubans would have largely gone over to the
 Chinese side.
 Careful handling of a party with a strong Chinese faction
 --the Japanese--was also demonstrated by the Soviet dele-
 gation to the Ninth World Rally for the Prohibition of
 Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Tokyo in early August
 1963.    Delegation chief G. Zhukov is reliably reported to
 have refused to align his delegation with that of the Jap-
 anese Socialists because he hoped to avoid taking a stand
 in opposition to the Japanese Communists at the rally.
 Later, while attacking the Chinese vigorously, the Soviet
 delegation demonstrated considerable forbearance with such
 Chinese supporters as the delegates from Ceylon and North
 Korea, stating that the USSR was confident of their "good
 sense as Marxist-Leninists," and implying the need to

 isolate the Chinese on the issue of disarmament.   Regarding
 such neutrals* as the Cubans, the Russians have criticized
 their equivocation primarily by proxy, using statements made
 proxy, using statements made by their supporters in the
 French and Paraguayan parties, particularly the warning of
 the latter (publicized by Moscow on 30 September) that to
 refuse to take sides and to talk about "two groups" in the
 movements 'means to assist those who are trying to split
 our movement..."
 Reports regarding the probability of a Soviet-
 initiated international conference of parties being held
 in Moscow suggest that the Russians in September and October
 had discussed with their supporters the idea of invoking
 discipline on the CCP in the form of a joint declaration
 condemning Chinese opposition to the "common line" of the
 movement.   Although among the CPSU's allies the French
 desired a conference, the Italians reportedly opposed the
 idea privately on the grounds that a formal anti-Chinese
 joint declaration would represent "a return to Stalinism."
 Publicly,** they objected that a meeting would "inevitably
 lead to a break or an unsatisfactory formal compromise,"
 and the East Germans asserted***-tit "such a conference
 might do more harm than good, for if it were to result in
 eu ra sT 'reers to those parties, the Cuban and Vene-
 zuelan, which have balanced their lukewarm support for cer-
 tain Soviet positions with favorable references to certain
 Chinese positions, but which have supported neither camp
 entirely in 1963.

 a formal schism that would not be good."  There is some
 possibility that the Soviet leaders had decided by Sep-
 ember or or even earlier that an international conference
 with or without the Chinese present would work to Peiping's
 advantage, as CCP supporters and the neutrals would de-
 fend its right to reject Soviet and majority dictation.
 Although a conference without the Chinese could be more
 easily manipulated to Soviet advantage during proceedings,
 any resulting anti-Chinese joint declaration could not be
 imposed on the Chinese camp (or even on some Soviet sup-
 porters), and would therefore not carry the authority of
 a really international--that is, unanimously accepted--docu-
 ment.   Assuming Soviet awareness of these difficulties,
 publication in Pravda in September and October of state-
 ments made by various parties or their spokesmen may have
 been intended as a display of CPSU responsiveness to appeals
 for an international conference and to arguments against
 such a conference.  Thus the apparent decision to postpone
 an international conference, as expressed by the Italians
 and East Germans, may have been intended to' appear as one
 arrived at in a fairminded way, having taken into consider-
 ation the differing views.
 The next Soviet move in the dispute may be to accept
 the lesser of two evils by engaging the Chinese again in
 bilateral talks.  Failure of a second round of bilateral
 negotiations to result in any accomodation of the CPSU
 and CCP positions would then provide the Russians, who have
 on occasion pointed out to other parties the need for suc-
 cessful "preparatory work"--that is, CPSU-CCP talks--with
 another argument for postponing indefinitely an international
 conference.
