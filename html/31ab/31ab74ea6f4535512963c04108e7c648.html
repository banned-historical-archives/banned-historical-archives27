 CHINA'S VIETNAM VETS ATTEND NANJING ADVANCED INFANTRY SCHOOL

 [Article by Yang Genrong [2799 2704 2837]: "Nearly 100 Outstanding Cadres
 Enter the Nanjing Advanced Infantry School"]
 [Text]  Beginning on 15 April, 93 cadres from the Guangxi Border Troops
 have arrived one after another at the Nanjing Advanced Infantry School for
 study.  Among these outstanding commanders tempered in the self-defensive
 counterattack are some military cadres who led "dagger" companies in bravely
 penetrating the enemy lines and who directed one decisive victory after
 another in the battles of Tong Deng [Chinese pronunciation: 0681 4098] and
 Lang Son; some political cadres who always set a personal example in promptly
 and forcefully carrying out political work during the battle; and some
 leading logistics cadres who fear neither hardship nor death and who did an
 outstanding job of completing battle supply tasks.  Among the 93 students
 are 50 who have been cited for battlefield service.  The arrival of this
 batch of students has given the school brave deeds and battle experience
 for developing in-depth study of the self-defensive counterattack battles.
 This has raised the quality of instruction and provided extremely beneficial
 factors.
 The CCP committee of the Nanjing Advanced Infantry School has attached great
 importance to this batch of new students entering the school.  They drew up
 a resolution on studying the brave deeds and experiences in the battle of
 self-defense and counterattack, calling on the personnel of the school to
 study seriously the lofty patriotism and revolutionary heroic.spirit of
 the troops who participated in battle, study the valuable experience in
 doing battle which was paid for with blood, to utilize this experience
 thoroughly in reforming instruction, to strive to train outstanding command-
 ers and to greatly advance all items of work with instruction at the core.

 WUHAN TANK BATTALION EXPERIMENTS IN MULTIGRADE TRAINING
 Beijing JIEFANGJUNBAO in Chinese 9 May 79 p 1
 [Article by Kuang Zhaojian [2568 0664 1017], Liu Jinzhang [0491 6855 4545],
 Guo Chuangxing [6753 0482 5281] and Han Baoqing 17281 5508 7230], "Reform
 the Educational System, Raise the Quality of Training"]
 [Text] This newspaper received a great deal of response after
 we published the experiences of a regiment of units under the
 Nanjing Command with a "promotion grade system" of training
 in our 26 February issue.  Many units feel that this training
 method is a major reform which solves the long-standing
 problem of putting rookie and veteran soldiers in the same
 pot and that it helps raise the quality of training.  Some
 comrades, however, have raised the question of how can we
 solve the problems of inadequate teaching personnel, equip-
 ment and space if we act like that regiment and train each
 company in separated class grades.  The No 1 tank battalion
 of a certain division of the units under the Wuhan Command
 has experimented in carried out multigrade education taking
 the battalion as the educational unit and solved these problems
 relatively well.  Here we introduce how they have done this.
 The No 1 tank battalion is this year's pioneer training test-point. battalion
 in a certain division of the armored force of the units under the Wuhan
 Command.  Since the beginning of February, with the assistance of a divisional
 work team, it has adopted a new teaching system focusing on the battalion and
 joining the battalion and the companies according to the "promotion grade
 system" method.  The quality of training has improved markedly.
 The "Promotion Grade System" Training Method Carries With It a Reform in the
 Educational System
 In January of this year when they were studying the training plan for the
 training test-point battalion, some comrades put forth the daring proposal to
 carry out training on a specialized basis by separating higher and lower
 classes.  Of course this would be very good for solving the problem of putting

 novice and veteran personnel in the same pot.  But it also bore with it a new
 problem.  Everyone first counted things up:  a tank company has four kinds of
 personnel:  tank commander, driver, first gunner and second gunner.  If each
 of these has a higher and lower class, that makes eight classes.  Yet one
 tank company has nine cadres  including the quartermaster and in ordinary
 times at most two-thirds of these are available.  The teaching capability is
 therefore insufficient to use the company as the teaching unit to carry out
 multigrade training.  In addition, some comrades pointed out that so many
 training vehicles would be required for company-level training.  In the past
 when training was divided into four specialized squads there was a. chronic
 problem in practical operations of contending for vehicles and waiting for
 them.  If they split the four squads into eight classes the contradictions
 of contending and waiting for vehicles would become more intense and there
 would definitely be insufficient training grounds and materials as well.
 What could be done?  The division CCP committee considered the greater
 interests and after numerous studies and deliberations resolved to search out
 a way via reforming the educational system, changing from one in the past
 with the company as its basic unit to a multigrade training system organized
 in a unified way by the battalion.  Moreover Assistant Division Commander
 Chen and Vice-Corshissar Sheng led separate work teams to first go to the No 1
 battalion of a certain regiment for a trial run.
 Methods of Implementing the Organization of Teaching Using the Battalion as
 the Basic Unit
 How, concretely, can multigrade training be organized in a unified manner by
 the battalion?
 One, the personnel of the entire battalion are grouped into unified classes.
 Using the method of mass appraisal, review by groups of teaching personnel
 and examination and approval by the company CCP branch, they grouped the
 tank commanders, first gunners and drivers each into higher and lower classes
 according to time of service, technical grade and ability to learn.  The .
 second gunners were.grouped into one class, making a total of seven classes.
 Those whose professional techniques were relatively good went to the A
 classes while those whose technical level was a little lower or who were
 rookies went to the B classes.  The personnel of each company were like
 schoolmates going to their own classes at unified training times to listen
 to lectures or to drill.  In the course of training personnel were promoted
 and demoted in grade in keeping with the development of their professional
 qualities.
 Two, the teaching personnel of the entire battalion divided up their work in
 a unified manner.  The battalion organized and assigned the cadres and teach-
 ing personnel of each company in a unified manner.  Aiming at the technical
 specialties of each cadre and his level of teaching responsibility and acting
 in accordance with the principles of putting the capable in command and
 pairing up the strong and the weak, they put the specialized teaching person-
 nel of the entire battalion into four instructor groups, including

 communications, gunnery and driving, and separately arranged cadres at the
 levels of battalion and company to assume the responsibility of group leader
 or assistant group leader.  On the eve of the training, the four instructor
 groups divided up the work for the 85 basic   topics and operational topics
 involved in this year's specialized training.  This brought each subject down
 to the individual so that each instructor understood the topic, contents,
 time and methods of his own teaching responsibility and there was a primary
 teacher and a backup teacher for each topic in order to avoid the situation
 where there is no one to teach when an instructor leaves.  Battalion and
 regiment cadre experts were invited to teach the nine theoretical topics
 which were relatively difficult.
 Three, the entire battalion drew up a unified concrete implementing training
 plan.  They organized the battalion's instructors to act in keeping with the
 monthly plans of the regiment and collectively draw up a program for imple-
 menting the training topics, collectively prepare lessons and examinations.
 In drawing up this program they treat groups A and B separately according to
 their aptitudes.  For example, they increased the number of relatively deep
 topics for drivers in class A, including the extended utilization of tanks
 and basic knowledge for technical appraisal and minor tank repairs.
 Four, the battalion made unified arrangements for various kinds of training
 equipment.  While the instruction was being carried out, specialized training
 equipment was all managed and repaired by the battalion and distributed to
 each class in a unified manner for its use.  This not only brought the exist-
 ing equipment into full play, it also created conditions for joint specialized
 training.
 Five, the battalion and the companies join with both division and joining.
 While the battalion organizes specialized basic training and education in a
 unified manner, the company cadres cooperate on their own initiative and
 organize the soldiers of their own companies to go to class at the appropri-
 ate times, to do their studies well and to do good political and ideological
 work in the course of training.  The battalion makes unified stipulations
 for the times which should be used for training, taking the company as the
 basic organizational unit for concrete implementation.  Training competitions
 are also carried out between companies.  They also pay attention to joining
 organically separate training and joint training.  That is, after a stretch
 of separate specialized training they let the four kinds of personnel return
 to their own tanks and do a stretch of joint specialized training.  They then
 separate the training again in a repeated cycle.  This allows the company
 cadres to grasp promptly the specialized technical conditions of the soldiers
 in their own companies and facilitates the personnel of each tank in prac-
 ticing cooperative maneuvers.
 Advantages of Reforming the Educational System
 Although the No 1 tank battalion has not trial implemented the multigrade
 instructional system organized in a unified way by the battalion for a very
 long period of time, its advantages have already begun to become evident.

 FOR UFFIUTAL USA:  ULVLY
 "With the new educational system, rookie and veteran personnel both have a
 keen interest in study."  This is the general opinion of the soldiers.  Rookie
 and veteran personnel have separate drills and lectures in keeping with their
 different natures and there is both promotion and demotion.  The veteran
 personnel do not study "the same old stuff," so they take an intense interest
 in study.  The rookie personnel strive to be promoted to the higher grade and
 put out a bit more effort to study and drill.  The enthusiasm of the battal-
 ion's soldiers for training has been throroughly aroused.
 "With the new educational system we no longer worry about the instructor
 problem."  This is the impression of the company cadres.  The No 3 company
 is a prominent example.  During the first half of last year, the commander
 entered a training unit and the vice-commander was not qualified..  There were
 no cadres to handle the two main specialties of gunnery and driving.  The
 company ran around in circles in haste and the best it could do was to pick
 out four soldiers to act as instructors.  This affected the quality of the
 training.  At the begThning of training this year, one technical cadre of the
 No 3 company was in the hospital due to illness, two cadres were transferred
 and there was no leader for one platoon.  Yet because the battalion organized
 instruction in a unified manner, the training of the No 3 company not only
 was as bustling with activity as before, its quality was better than in past
 years.
 "With the new educational system the utilization of vehicles, training grounds
 and equipment has been raised."  When the company was the unit of instruction,
 vehicles and equipment were both guaranteed by the company.  A large number
 of vehicles were utilized and equipment was. in short supply.  With the
 battalion as the unit of instruction and classes divided into higher and lower,
 the battalion has alternated basic specialized and general topics and topics
 involving basic theory and practical operations.  Vehicles are transferred and
 equipment is guaranteed in a unified way by the battalion, overcoming in an
 effective way the above maladies, cutting down on the phenomena of idle
 vehicles, ('ontending for vehicles and waiting for vehicles and increasing the
 training time of personnel in actual operations.
 After more than two months the quality of training has improved markedly.
 Good results have been obtained in those classes which have already been held.
 For example, the overall evaluation of the theory test for the specialized A
 communications group was excellent while on basic drill No 1 the B group,
 with eight participants, had seven rated excellent and one rated.good, with
 100 percent passing.          The overall daytime evaluation was excellent for
 the 33 participants in the A and B groups of drivers in basic driving, with
 100 percent passing.          Basic drill No 3 was rated overall excellent
 for groups A and B of the first gunners.  In practicing initiating and termi-
 nating the battle with antiaircraft machine guns, 13 out of 14 second gunners
 were excellent and one did not pass.

 Remaining Problerris
 Some new problems have appeared with the implementation of the new educational
 system.  The main one is that once the rookie and veteran soldiers were
 separated into different training classes it has not been easy to promote
 movements for the veterans to lead the rookies.  In addition, once the
 battalion became the unit for instruction the cadres of the companies lacked
 a very deep understanding of the soldiers of their own company.  This has
 brought with it some problems in company political and ideological work and
 in company administration.  But they feel that these problems may be solved
 by uncovering new methods in the course of practice.  Towards the end of
 March the division had already held an on-site conference in this battalion
 and is promoting its experience throughout the division.

 MILITARY AND PUBLIC SECURITY
 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMANDERS, SUBORDINATES DISCUSSED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 25 May 79 p 3
 [Article by Pei Dingsan [5952 1353 0005): "'On Horse' and 'On Foot"']
 [Text]  During a rapid march to pursue and destroy the enemy during the War
 of Liberation, the troops marched day and night.  The commander of one  .
 regiment was anxious to annihilate the enemy and was continually blaming the
 troops for going too slow.  Because he was on horseback it was very difficult
 for him to comprehend how much tenacious willpower it took for the soldiers
 who were already completely exhausted to march one step forward.  In con-
 sequence some of the soldiers said, "Who does not want to lay hold of the
 enemy as quickly as possible?  Those who are on horse must know the
 difficulties of those on foot!"
 "Those on horse must get to know the difficulties of those on foot" is
 plain speech but there is truth in it which affords food for thought.  For
 example, comparing those "on horse" to the leaders and those "on foot" to
 the masses, this means that the leaders should attentively experience and
 observe the hardships and difficulties.  When they hand over tasks to the
 masses or when they supervise and urge the masses to complete tasks, they
 must take into account the difficulties which the masses encounter and,
 with earnest solicitude, handle matters in a fair and reasonable way.
 Numerous facts fromt.tM.war ytOrs,prove that when those !'on horse" can know
 the difficulties of those "on foot," the latter can follow the orders of
 those "on horse."  At present we must concentrate the thoughts and energies
 of the broad masses on socialist modernization and our "horseback" leaders
 must likewise "know the difficulties of those on toot."  Bureaucratic
 attitudes such as being unconcerned with the vital interests of the masses,
 not taking the sufferings of the masses to heart and being insensitive to
 the practical difficulties of the masses must all be resolutely opposed and
 rectified.  If not, the masses will treat you as badly as you treat them,
 and it will be impossible to genuinely get everyone to concentrate their
 thoughts and energies on modernization.
 There is another side to the matter, however.  Although that regimental
 commander grumbled about the soldiers, he also had his difficulties.

 If they did not pursue and attack the enemy rapidly, they would not strike
 them and might even affect the completion of the entire battle plan.  From
 this angle, that commander was also correct in saying, "Those who are on
 foot must know the difficulties of those on horse!"  So if we are to con-
 sider the problem from all angles, we must advocate "those on foot knowing
 the difficulties of those on horse" at the same time that we should stress
 "those on horse knowing the difficulties of those on foot." After the
 disaster of Lin Biao and the "gang of four," there are some genuine practi-
 cal difficulties at present among the masses.  When the masses present their
 own difficulties and demand that they be solved, this is understandable, and
 they should be satisfied to the fullest extent possible.  However, those
 "on horse" have difficulties just in the same way that those "on foot" have
 theirs.  The fact that there are problems which should be solved is not
 equivalent to having the wherewithal to solve them.  We cannot simply look
 at our own difficulties and present demands to our hearts' content by just
 looking out for ourselves.  We must also consider the difficulties of the
 state and show understanding and sympathy for straits of the leadership in
 not having the capability to fulfill all wishes.
 Actually, both those "on horse" and those "on foot" are good.  Their overall
 aims are the same and it is not difficult to unite them.  At present the
 fundamental interests of the people of the entire nation lie in carrying
 out the four socialist modernizations.  This is the big picture for the
 entire nation and it is our common overall goal.  In order to realize this
 goal, both those "on horse" and those "on foot" must focus their thinking
 and power on the four modernizations.  Those problems of livelihood for the
 masses which have accumulated over a long period of time must be grasped and
 resolved in order to facilitate whipping up the enthusiasm of the masses.
 At the same time we must look at the limitations of objective conditions.
 We cannot solve everything in a short period of time nor can we act with
 undue haste lest we block the four modernizations.  At present, although the
 course of events has already made a turn for the better, it is only an
 initial turn and is far from  a total turn.  Much remains to be tidied up
 and to be built and we must still rely on leading cadres and the broad
 masses to exert tremendous common efforts.   As for those matters which we
 do not have conditions to resolve for the time being, we must still promote
 a spirit of arduous struggle and vanquish the difficulties together.  Only
 if we fix-all our hearts and eyes    on the great goal of the four moderni-
 zations, join present and long-run interests (that-is, taking present
 interests into account while submitting to long-run interests) and join
 partial interests and those of the whole (that is, taking the-interests of
 the part into account while submitting to those of the whole), then the
 contradiction between those "on horse" and those "on foot" can entirely be
 unified.
 In order to better unify those "on horse" and those "on foot," both leaders
 and the masses. should adopt a positive attitude, increase their sense of
 responsibility and do their work with initiative.  Leading cadres must have
 a mass concept, that is they must be concerned about the masses and think of

 them in every regard.   They must also report difficulties accurately to the
 masses and publicize the Party's policies among them.  In addition they must
 discuss things with the masses and concentrate their wisdom.  The masses
 must have the thinking of protagonists and consider problems from the point
 of view of the overall situation.  They must not only show understanding and
 sympathy for the difficulties of the leaders but also propose. ideas and
 think of ways of dealing with them on behalf of the leadership so that they
 may work together to overcome these difficulties.  If only those "on horse"
 and those "on foot" work with one mind and one heart and forge a burst of
 energy, no difficulty can hinder the forward pace of our socialist moderni-
 zation.

 AGITATION., PROPAGANDA HELP MAINTAIN FIGHTING SPIRIT
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 27 May 79 p 1
 [Article by Zhao Gengqun [6392 2577 5028] of the political work teaching and research
 office of the political academy:  "Where Does the Fine Fighting Spirit Come From?"]
 [Text]  As far as the whole conduct of a war1s concerned, proper
 orders, slogans and written addresses to the troops are of the same
 important significance as first-rate heavy guns or first-rate fast
 tanks.
 After the victorious conclusion of the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam,
 we went to Yunnan and conducted a study among the frontier guards.  We were particu-
 larly impressed by the fact that in this battle the work of propaganda and agitation
 was well done, with clear-cut aims, strong militancy and broad mass support.  The
 simple but effective fighting slogans and propaganda and agitation of every descrip-
 tion helped the army units to maintain their fine fighting spirit all along.
 We have roughly summarized the contents and features of the wartime propaganda and
 agitation in a few points as a tentative outline for teaching.
 1.  Grasping well the education of "looking upon the enemy in.three ways," and arousing
 the troops' fighting spirit.  The comrades of army units taking part in the war said
 that this is the foundation of propaganda and agitation.  When.this foundation is
 laid, the fighting spirit will be ignited easily like dried firewood.  Before the
 battle started, all units carried out education in looking upon the Vietnamese aggres-
 sors with hatred, looking down upon them, and showing comtempt for them.             The troops
 were organized to read material on the crimes of the Vietnamese authorities in
 throwing in their lot with the Soviet revisionists, in carrying out aggression against
 Cambodia. and in pursuing regional hegemonism.  The comrades of local foreign affairs
 departments, were asked to explain to the troops the origin and development of fighting
 in the border areas between China and Vietnam.  Those.overseas Chinese who had been
 driven back to this country were asked to expose the crimes of the Vietnamese author-
 ities in opposing and boycotting Chinese.  The troops were taken to the sites where
 the Vietnamese army of aggression murdered our frontier guards and people, and
 meetings were held to denounce the enemy. These live facts showed the cadres and
 fighters clearly the  reactionary features of the Vietnamese authorities.  Shi
 Yuannan [0670 2266 0589], a fighter in a certain regiment, said:  "When I was born,
 my father was helping Vietnam with reconstruction.  To remember the friendship between

 the peoples of China and Vietnam, my mother gave me the name of 'Yuannan' meaning
 'Help Vietnam.' But now the Vietnamese authorities have broken faith with us and
 are using guns to kill Chinese people who have selflessly helped them.  We must give
 these gangsters a heavy blow!"
 2.  Instilling heroic images in the minds of the fighters.  The army units taking part
 in the war compiled and published "honor rolls" of their own heroic individuals and
 groups for circulation and study, and set the standards for the fighters to win honor
 in time of war.  All the fighters had these heroic images in their hearts, and became
 determined to "learn from and emulate the heroes, to become a hero with honor," and
 "learn from the heroes, translate into action, and make new contributions in defense
 of the four modernizations."  The 9th company party branch of a certain regiment
 called upon the whole company to imitate Huang Jiguang [7806 4949 0342] and Dong
 Cunrui [5516 1317 3843] in launching an attack, to imitate hero Wang Cheng [3769 2052]
 in holding fast to one's position, to imitate Qiu Shaoyun [6726 1421 0061] in carrying
 out orders and observing discipline, and to imitate Luo Guangxie [5012 0342 3610]
 in opening up a passageway.   The "Luoyang heroic company" of a certain Red Army
 regiment was unable to advance while attacking He     171.  Political instructor Lan
 Titang [5695 7555 1016] at once called out:  "Carry on the tradition of the 'Luoyang
 heroic company' and fight for the prestige of the 'Luoyang heroic company'!"  All
 the comrades of the company echoed loudly:  "We are the steel-sworded 5th company
 and we are determined to take Height 171!"  They charged forward bravely and took the
 height very quickly.  Then, fighting in coordination with other fraternal companies,
 they took two more heights in succession, and won new honors for their "Luoyang heroic
 company."
 3.  Doing a good job of agitation in the light of specific tasks.  A certain regiment
 was given the task of taking Height 230 by secretly crossing the Red River.  They
 raised the cry:  "Let's pull out the nail, make a breakthrough, and open the gate for
 the entire division!"  The troops were inspired to plant the Red Flag on Height 230.
 After the initial success, the higher command again gave them the order to advance
 toward Weijin and Gantang and, together with other fraternal units, to encircle and
 annihilate the enemy 345th division.  The regiment party committee also called upon
 them to "maintain the style of continuous fighting, take Weijin, cut right into
 Gantang, annihilate the 345th division, and win a big victory."  Under the stimulation
 of this slogan, the comrades defied fatigue and fought continuously.  During the
 advance they encouraged one another:  "Let's brace up, wipe out the 345th division;
 let's exert more effort, hit hard the '316' enemy (the Vietnamese 316A division)."
 Thus their fighting spirit was high.  The comrades of units taking part in the battle.
 learned from practical experience that when projaganda.and agitation work was inte-
 grated with the concrete fighting task, it exerted a force which was quickly trans-
 formed into fighting strength.
 4.  Shouting war slogans at the right moment.  All the fighting units agreed that
 shouting slogans at the critical moment changed the situation entirely.  They paid
 great attention to every phase of the battle and conducted effective agitation at the
 proper time.  When the 8th company of a certain regiment had taken Height 154 and
 built their defenses, the enemy carried out a surprise attack in the night and in-
 flicted some casualties on the company.  They immediately called out:                    "Turn our
 grief into strength and resolutely avenge our comrades-in-arms!"  When the enemy
 artillery bombardment destroyed our heavy guns, they called upon all comrades:  "Wipe

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100160001-0
 out the enemy with our rifles and handgrenades, don't let the enemy advance  a single
 step!"  When the enemy concentrated forces in a mass attack and the fighting became
 very fierce, they shouted slogans loudly:  "Never give in, and vow to live or perish
 at our posts."  "Live up to the trust of the fatherland and the people's expectations,
 and strike down the enemy even with a bayonet or a rock."  Thus, six times they re-
 pulsed the counterattack of the enemy.  When the supply of ammunition dwindled on
 the front, the 2d platoon of the 6th company sent over their own supply.  More slogans
 resounded along the front:  "Learn from comrades of the 2d platoon, give the enemy
 a hard blow, and swear to hold our positions."  Prompt propaganda and agitation
 inspired the fighters to become more and more courageous in fighting so that they
 were able to hold the in position.
 5.  Raising appropriate slogans according to the nature of the work of each unit.
 During the fighting period, all army units were guided by the general idea of doing
 everything to win the war, and raised agitation slogans appropriate to the nature of
 the work in their units.  The artillery units raised the slogan:  "Whereever artillery
 is wanted, we will go to fight."  They were not afraid of difficulty or danger,
 placed their guns at various points in complex terrain, carefully aimed at every tar-
 get, and made every shell fired explode in the midst of an enemy group.           The motor
 transport corps comrades raised the slogan:  "Wherever our troops are fighting, we
 will deliver them ammunition and supplies."  They endured the hardship of an arduous
 journey, traveled day- and night.  Some drivers did not leave the driver's cab for
 7 days and nights.  The medical personnel raised the slogan:  "Our heroic comrades
 win victories on the front; we will spare no effort to treat the wounded."  They ex-
 pressed their love for their class brothers by giving them meticulous medical care
 and surgery, worked hard day and night, and accomplished miracles in saving lives and
 tending the wounded.
 6.  The outstanding commanders are also exemplary agitators.  Among the cadres of
 troops which took part in the fighting, we fould a common characteristic, that is,
 they were both courageous in leading an attack and good at agitation, and they put
 agitation and command in perfect harmony.  Commander Liu Jianrong [0491 1696 2837]
 of the 4th company of a certain regiment led an attack to take a certain height.
 In the fighting he commanded his company and did the work of agitation at the same
 time.  When he was hit twice, in the leg and in the abdomen, comrades tried to give
 him first aid.  He told them:  "Don't bother about me, charge forward quickly!"
 Then, enduring severe pain, he led his fighters in continuing the attack.  When they
 reached a spot some 20 meters from the top of the hill, he was fatally wounded in the
 head.  He was still pointing at the enemy with his finger and with his last breath
 urged his fighters to charge forward.  Company commander Liu's words and gesture gave
 the fighters tremendous strength.  They shouted the slogan, "Avenge our company com-
 mander," captured the hill quickly and wiped out the enemy.
 7.  Through a mass network of propaganda and agitation with Communist Party members
 as its core, field agitation could become everybody's activity. In the attack on
 Height 148, communist Jiang Jinzhu [5592 6855 2691], a squad leader of the 2d company
 of a certain regiment, was seriously wounded in the head.  He said hoarsely to his
 deputy:  "We both are communists and must capture this hill to win glory for our
 party and to avenge our dead comrades.  If I die, you must lead the squad to
 accomplish this task!"  He endured severe pain in his wound, destroyed the enemy's
 last firing point with a handgrenade, and set an example for his comrades-in-arms

 with his own exemplary action.  Another comrade was wounded in both legs.  When he
 was carried down the hill on a stretcher, a reinforcement unit was passing by.  He
 called to his comrades-in-arms optimistically:  "I have some difficulty with my legs
 and have to go down and take a rest now.  I hope you will fight hard.  I will return
 soon!"  The fighters were moved by his words and said tearfully:  "Rest assured that
 we will certainly avenge you.11 Scenes like these were numerous in the battle.  It
 may be said that everywhere the cadres encouraged the fighters, the fighters en-
 couraged the cadres, the infantry men commended the artillery men, the artillery men
 praised the infantry men, the office workers encouraged the troops, and the wounded
 encouraged their comrades-in-arms. The situation was lively.
 8.  Not sticking to one pattern and using flexible methods.  During our tour of study
 we came to realize that the troops on the front used flexible methods of propaganda
 and agitation.  The brutality of the enemy, the people's support, the heroic deeds
 of the fighters in the battle, the victorious reports from the battleground, and the
 letters from families in the motherland were all good material for the work of
 propaganda and agitation.  Fighter Zhang Yuancheng [1728 6678 2052] of the 2d mechan-
 ized company of a certain regiment sprained his foot in field training, and it
 became very swollen.  The aged leader of a local production team saw him, opened his
 wound with a needle, and sucked the extravasated blood out bit by bit by mouth.  When
 the mechanized unit arrived at the front, the aged team leader again tramped over hill
 and dale for scores of li and brought gifts to comfort Zhang Yuancheng and other
 fighters.  The officers used this event to teach the fighters:  "The people give us
 support to fight the enemy, we must win a victory for the people."  The 8th company
 of a certain unit was holding fast to Height 250 during a battle when the company
 commander was wounded in the head.  Deputy political instructor Deng Guanglu [6772
 0342 4389] took the commander's service cap, which was smeared with blood, and wrote
 the following words:  "The hole was made by a bullet fired by the enemy and the blood
 was shed by our commander.  Comrades, we must avenge our commander!"  This cap was
 passed from one fighter to another along the entire position.  It aroused the fighters'
 concern for their commander and hatred against the enemy.  They were filled with rage
 and repulsed the enemy time after time in fighting back.  The entire company held the
 position firmly like a nail being driven into the ground.
 The field work of propaganda and agitation is the essential substance of political
 work in the time of war, and it is a fine tradition of the political work of our army.
 From the counterattack against Vietnam in self-defense we have again gained some new
 experience and enriched its substance.  Provided we can carefully learn from and
 apply this valuable experience, we will carry out our political work to better serve
 the modernization of our army.

 SHENYANG ARMY HOSPITAL ADOPTS NEW CLINICAL TECHNOLOGY
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 27 May 79 p 1
 [Article by correspondents Guo Jindong [6753 2516 2639] and Tang Wenjun [0781 2429
 0193] and staff reporter Yang Xuequan [2799 1331 3123]:  "The Successful Use of New
 Clinical Technology"]
 [Text]  How do army hospitals carry out modernization: by relying on foreign advanced
 equipment or by depending on available equipment and using both native and foreign
 methods?  The Shenyang General Army Hospital has carried forward the fine tradition
 of plain living and hard struggle, refrained from relying on others for help, and
 carried on its work and achieved "modernization" at the same time.  Under the guidance
 of this concept, it introduced 35 items of new technology in the first quarter of this
 year, 9 of which reach the advanced level in our country, including the treatment
 of congenital heart disease by repairing the closing tube of the tricuspid valve,
 and the making of a portable capacity-discharge grid-controlled.x-ray machine.
 In particular,.it has tackled the following three problems:
 1.  Correct handling of the relationship between importing and copying, and trying
 its best to copy whatever can be duplicated by relying on our socialist superiority
 and collective wisdom and displaying a spirit of broad cooperation.  In the past,
 the members of the hospital's radiology department had tried to fill in the gaps in
 the technology of diagnosing and locating pathological changes in soft tissues and
 nonmetallic foreign bodies.  After.seeing pictures of a patented molybdenum-target
 x-ray machine in foreign medical journals, they worked very hard to design and build
 their own soft x-ray machine, which won a special prize at the National Science
 Symposium.  Later, they visited a local hospital and saw an imported sample x-ray
 machine which was more advanced in performance and could take pictures in any position
 using a common power. source in hospital wards.  With the assistance of fraternal
 units, they again worked hard for 7 months, and in January this year they succeeded
 in turning out a replica of this machine as China's first portable-discharge grid-
 controlled X-ray machine of the advanced level of the 1970's.  The machine has been
 tested and used in clinical practice and found to perform well with satisfactory
 results.
 2.  Trying by all means to save foreign exchange for the state by doing our own re-
 pairs of imported equipment and making the necessary spare parts without waiting for
 and relying on imports.  Last July the hospital's number one internal medicine

 department imported a fiber endoscope, which was laid aside due to lack of a con-
 ducting wire for a gastroscope for high-frequency electric burning.  Some comrades
 intended to wait for the importation of spare parts before using the instrument in
 clinical practice.  Later, they all realized that it would cost the state's foreign
 exchange and take some time to import the needed conducting wire, so they decided
 to make one themselves.  With the help of the hospital maintenance team, they suc-
 cessfully made a replacement part and promptly used the endoscope in clinical prac-
 tice.          In the first quarter of this year, by using this instrument in nine cases they
 successfully carried out electric excision of gastric and colonic polyposis.
 3.  Setting high aims and lofty goals to catch up with and surpass the advanced level
 when we have imported equipment and technology, as well as striving to create condi-
 tions for catching up with and surpassing the advanced level when we do not have
 imported equipment and technology.  The hispital's number one surgical department
 last year performed 147 operations involving direct observation inside the heart in
 external circulation, of which 82 cases were Fallot's tetrad disease, with a success-
 ful operation rate of 97.5 percent, thus reaching an international advanced level.
 To develop in depth and breadth the surgical treatment of cardiac angiopathy, members
 of the department actively created the necessary conditions and took their own road
 of development.  In the early period when they used valve tubes in the surgical
 treatment of cardiac angiopathy, they encountered many difficulties.  However, they
 did not ask for assistance from the state and did not wait, but took the initiative
 to look for means to overcome the difficulties.  To make their own valve-frame, they
 approached a local factory to get some leftover bits and pieces of titanium alloy
 steel, and they did their own processing by hammering them little by little.  They
 had no biovalve, so every day they went to a slaughterhouse to pick out suitable
 valves from hundreds, sometimes even nearly a thousand, pig hearts for processing,
 and then very carefully sewed them stitch by stitch onto the valve-frame.  In
 January this year, for the first time in our country, they successfully performed
 an operation to repair the closing tube of the tricuspid valve in human bodies.

 "Beijing Unit Carries Out Combined-Arms Training for Better Joint Command"]
 [Text]  One of the Beijing PTA units has carried out combined-arms training at a
 preselected operations area to help its commanders at all levels become familiar with
 the various armed service branches and improve their ability for joint command.
 Before this combined exercise, the army unit used collective training as a means to
 have all armed service branches learn from one another, to have the infantry learn
 how to get into tanks and armored carriers, and so that the commanders at all levels
 could learn systematically about other armed service branches and the principles of
 combat.  During the exercises at various levels, the infantry was reinforced as much
 as possible by armed service branches with tanks, artillery, signal corps, engineers
 and antichemical warfare corps, so that all armed service branches could get prac-
 tical training.  When the regiments carried out exercises, the higher echelon set up
 a field situation based on the enemy's formation, equipment, firepower distribution
 and tactics to help commanders at all levels, in conditions close to actual fighting,
 to study ways of using their troops, disposing of firepower and setting up command
 posts, to study ways of adjusting the cooperation of various armed service branches
 at different times, and to become familiar with the organized command at their own
 levels.  The soldiers learned the order of battle, changes in combat formations under
 different conditions, ways of using topographical and surface features, alternative
 covering fire, and the advantage of launching an assault after a barrage of artillery
 fire.  They said that they learned a great deal from this practical exercise and
 greatly improved their technological and tactical level.
 At present, in the light of the weakness of its cadres in combat coordination, this
 army unit organized eight training groups of cadres from among its divisions, regi-
 ments, battalions, companies and staff officers, intensified study and training in
 the organization of command, and made the determination to achieve better results
 from the training of cadres this year.

 question:  to strive to study and research advanced combat methods.
 As a historical process, the rifle defeated the sword, and new advanced combat
 methods will ultimately replace out-of-date and backward combat methods.  This is
 an objective law of warfare development and must be the object of the consciousness
 and generals of any class who must conform to this law and not try to change it.
 In the history of warfare, battle by mounted troops negated battle by chariots;
 line formations of musketeers and lancers negated mounted armored troops; skirmish
 formations under cover of artillery negated line formations; and after the appearance
 of the tank, armored units took the place of skirmish tactics on the battlefield,
 etc.  These changes in combat methods and means prove the truth that "Soldiers do
 not have a constant situation and water does not have a constant form."  (SUNZI
 BINGFA, XUSHIPIAN)  The thinking of combat commanders must not get into a rut and
 take steps without regard to the circumstances.
 Some comrades ask, "Aren't our proletarian army's combat methods the most complete
 and most advanced?"  No.  There are two things wrong with this.  The first is to
 ascribe the "class" label to combat methods.  This does not conform to Marxist
 materialism and can only block our field of vision and bind us hand and foot.  The
 second is using the advance nature of class rather than the advanced nature of
 combat methods which departs from seeking truth from facts and becomes one of the
 theoretical bases of parochial arrogance.
 Does combat method have a class nature?  To answer this question it is necessary
 first to analyze its objective properties and clarify the fundamental factors
 which determine combat method.
 In proving that combat method has a class nature, many comrades cite Engels as
 proof:  "The entire organization and combat methods of an army and the victory or
 defeat related to it depends on material, i.e., economic, conditions; it depends
 on the human and weapon materials, that is, it depends on the quality and quantity
 of the inhabitants and on the technique."  ["Selected Works of Marx and Engels,"
 Vol III, p 210.]  Well in "Anti-Duhring" and other essays on military affairs

 Engels expressed this same idea.  Under the conditions prevailing at the time,
 Engels felt that the method of combat was determined by the two factors of men and
 weapons.  However, later, new warfare partice proved that this conclusion had to be
 corrected.  For example, to explain the fact that changes in the soldiers in the
 army determined the changes in combat methods, Engels used the American War of
 Independence as an example.  He pointed out that the reasons the combat method
 changed from line tactics to skirmish tactics was partly because the Americans had
 the rifle which was faster and more accurate than the musket, and partly because
 the insurrectionists lacked strict infantry training and it was difficult for them
 to master the line tactic.  The  insurrectionists fought for their personal in-
 terests and unlike the mercenaries who deserted in critical situations, did not need
 strict line formations to keep them in check.  At the same time, the Americans were
 hunters and marksmanship is suited to skirmish tactics.  Thus, Engels came to the
 conclusion that skirmish tactics were "a new combat technique produced by
 changes in the soldiers." ["Selected Works of Marx and Engels,"  Vol III, p 208]
 But based on this conclusion:  it is difficult to explain why later on mercenaries
 who were fully trained to serve the ruling classes and were neither hunters nor
 insurrectionists all used skirmish tactics.  In fact, after Napoleon, all the armies
 in the world, including proletarian armies, used skirmish tactics.  It is clear
 that changes in the soldiers were not the main reason why combat methods change.
 Here, the ultimate reason is the deadliness of the rifle.  In the face of its shower
 of bullets, all dense combat formations must disperse, otherwise it would be
 impossible to achieve the aim of self-defense and to destroy the enemy.  During the
 Franco-Prussion War, the armies on both sides used breech-loading rifles in the
 first engagement, but because the commanders followed the old ways and still used
 column formations, suited to the time of the rifled musket, a brief transitional
 step in the evolution from line formation to skirmish formation, the Prussians
 attempted to stop at this stage and make it the combat method suited to the new
 weapon.  As a result, they suffered great losses.   In less than 2 hours of battle,
 they lost over one-third of their guard army.  From then on the column formation,
 like the line formation, was completely discarded.  Therefore, the idea which Engels
 emphasized repeatedly that "once technological advances can be used and have been
 used for military purposes, they immediately become dominant and frequently go
 against the will of the commanders and give rise to changes and even revolutions in
 combat method."  ["Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol 3, p 211]  But Lenin
 summed up Engels' idea more accurately and succinctly:  "Tactics are determined by
 an army's technological level."  ["Selected Works of Lenin, Vol 1, p 6691.  That is,
 the basic factor which determines combat method is the development of weapons and
 equipment which accompanies the increase in productive forces, and all other factors,
 including the influence of brilliant commanders and changes in the soldiers, simply
 provide the external conditions for changes in combat method so that sooner or later
 the different armies of other countries will master the new combat methods.   (This
 is a general law of combat method change including even the selection and applica-
 tion of tactical techniques in specific battles, based, of course, on the flexible
 changes in the objective conditions of weather, terrain and intelligence, and the
 two cannot ever be combined.)
 Since the fundamental factor which determines change in combat method is the
 development of weapons technology and not man's subjective will or changes in the
 soldiers, we can say straightforwardly that combat method itself has no class

 character and even less can the class properties of an army be used as a norm to
 measure whether or not combat methods are advanced.  Armies made up of different
 classes but at the same stage-of weapons development may use the same combat methods.
 Armies of all classes may learn from each other in combat methods.  Of course we
 should acknowledge that whether or not combat methods are advanced is determined
 first of all by whether or not the weapons and equipment are advanced.  At the same
 time, we also should acknowledge that at the same stage of weapons development,
 those who discover new combat methods are not necessarily those who have created
 the new weapons technology.  Having advanced weapons and equipment is a precon-
 dition for having mastery of advanced combat methods but there is also the question
 of whether or not those with advanced equipment are good at finding the combat
 methods most suited to the new weapons technology.  There is also a question of
 smashing conservative thinking, getting rid of the force of habit, not rigidly
 adhering to outdated experience and an obsolete military science outlook, but
 upholding the practice of proceeding from reality, and seeking truth from facts so
 that one's thinking will constantly adapt to the objective laws of the development
 of warfare.  It is worth mentioning that when we discuss the fact that weapons
 determine combat method and that the technological level determines tactics, we
 are not answering the question of what determines victory and defeat in warfare.
 Therefore, acknowledging th objective law that changes in combat method are
 determined by the development of weapons we definitely cannot equate the issue of
 what determines the outcome of a war with the doctrine that only weapons are
 important.  If one studies the advanced combat methods of foreign countries, even
 less can one talk of any "bourgeois classification".  Today we want to accelerate
 the modernization of national defense, and not only must we vigorously develop new
 advanced weapons and equipment, we also must make an effort to study and master
 advanced combat methods.
 Our proletarian army of course has its own unique principles of tactics and strategy.
 But its "advancement" and "uniqueness" is only in the righteousness and popularity
 of the wars we fight, i.e., in the human-sea tactics of the people's war, it relies
 on the support of the masses and on flexible application.  All hegemonic armies are
 divorced from the people and have little support.  They can copy the tactical and
 strategic principles of people's war from our military specialists, but they cannot
 really learn to apply them.  But on the other hand, we can study completely the
 tactical methods of all the armies in the world from an understanding of the guiding
 principles of warfare in general, and with modifications use them to enrich and
 perfect the strategy and tactics of the people's war.  In the past, under the
 influence of the "leftist" line promoted by Lin Biao and the "gang of four," combat
 method and tactics were branded with a class character and the incorrect styles
 of parochial arrogance and the notion tht they were the only true revolutionaries
 were developed.  Furthermore, the carrying on of our army's traditional combat
 method and experience was also cut off at will according to the political needs of
 periodic "line struggles."  Even today some commanders do not dare to use "point
 formation" and "V formation" in troop training, saying that this is a tactical
 principle of Lin Biao, so it's better to return to the pre-Napoleonic era and use
 close-line formation to stop the hail of bullets from enemy machineguns.   This sort
 of old fashioned idea is unsuited to the situation as we modernize our army.
 That the development of weapons technology determines the changes in combat methods,
 should be said to be a basic understanding of Marxist military affairs theory.  No

 matter whether we study modern warfare or draw on foreign experiences, or even
 study battles from our own past, and study the strategy and tactics summarized by
 Comrade Mao Zedong, it is always necessary to adopt this viewpoint.  Otherwise, it
 is turning things upside down and pursuing the trivial rather than the essential.
 A few years ago, when Lin Biao and the "gang of four" were peddling their reactionary
 willfullness, this point of view was overlooked by people and many comrades studying
 military affairs and researching warfare were satisfied just to memorize everything
 uncritically and to copy down existing conclusions, and indiscriminately to accept
 intact the combat means and methods of the past.  They did not know that military
 affairs specialists should not be copiers but should be creators; the study of
 military theory is not "archaeology" but it is a field which should open up paths
 to the development of truth.  Are not many of our older comrades paying serious
 attention to helping out and setting a good example for young cadres?  This is a
 commendable spirit.  But helping out and setting a good example is not simply
 mechanically imitating the past, you cannot paint a modern day "ladle" according to
 the "bottle gourd" of the past, but must proceed from the new historical conditions
 and combine what is to be passed on and what is created.  Therefore, we propose that
 the basic Marxist idea that the level of technology determines the tactics and the
 weapons determine the combat method be restudied, with the aim of making our com-
 rades able to overhaul completely their thinking and understand how to explore new
 laws for directing war according to the cognitive line of materialism.
 In studying and researching new combat methods in accordance with the objective law
 that the development of weapons technology determines changes in combat method, we
 must start from the beginning--that is, we must study new military science knowledge,
 understand the capabilities, characteristics and uses of new weapons technologies,
 get a firm technological foundation and then tactical means can be used flexibly.
 A far-sighted military scientist also should note the world developmental trends in
 modernized weapons and equipment and see in them the direction new combat methods
 and means will take.  Those commanders who neglect to study military science and
 simply copy the existing combat methods of others are not smart commanders.  Many
 combined unit commanders lack the ability to "combine," and an important reason for
 this is their severe lack of scientific and technical knowledge.
 Our commanders also should look at another side of the question--changes in combat
 means and method also influence the development of weapons and equipment.  This not
 only appears in the proper use of tactics which can fully employ the existing
 technology and equipment, but even make up for inadequacies in the techology.
 Moreover, as soon as new advanced combat means and methods appear and are used,
 it is necessary urgently to demand improvements in obsolete weapons and equipment
 and point the way for new technological development.  For example, under the con-
 ditions of modern warfare, a clear characteristic of combat method is the dispersed
 arrangement of manpower and the concentrated use and camouflaged movement of fire-
 power, which demands in terms of technique, an increase in the range and accuracy
 of field artillery and at the same time also presents newer and greater demands
 with regard to the combat performance of aircraft and varying range antiaircraft
 weapons, and an improvement in existing communications, reconnaissance and
 engineering technologies and machinery, pointing out a general direction for the
 improvement of our weapons and equipment, to increase our self-consciousness and
 reduce our recklessness.  The negative attitude that existing equipment is adequate
 and that there is no point in studying new combat methods or that limits study of

 combat methods to those suited to existing equipment is the "myopia" of military
 science research.  The dialectical method is such that backward technological
 levels can lead to backward tactical thinking and backward tactical thinking must
 limit and constrict technological development.
 Studying and researching advanced combat methods also must promote change in our
 organizational and command methods.  Just as technology determines tactics, new
 combat methods demand new organizational and command methods suited to them.  This
 point we can see clearly in the staff planning in present military command agencies.
 In ancient warfare  weapons and equipment were simple, combat methods were basically
 close combat and organization and command also were simple.  By 1809 when Napoleon
 met the Austiran Army at Wagram, his command post was only 3 or 4 kilometers from
 the frontlines and he could still issue verbal orders personally to his troops (his
 orders could be sent directly to regimental commanders).  Later on, with advances
 in firearms, increases in the kind of soldiers and the use of skirmish tactics, the
 battlefield expanded and Napoleon could no longer issue verbal orders to command
 his troops, so a new type of staff officer appeared, i.e., Napoleon's chief of
 staff, Field Marshal Berthier.  And by the Franco-Prussian War, Berthier also
 created the general staff, then all armies in the world imitated the French Army
 in the creation of the organizational command.  Modern warfare is much more
 complicated than in the time of the Franco-Prussian War and the use of new military
 techniques on the battlefield and the production of new combat methods makes it no
 longer a basic premise to rely on increasing the staff personnel.  What is urgently
 demanded is to develop command tools, improve command methods, reform command
 organization, borrow from advanced experience abroad and gradually automate
 organization and command.

 ARTICLES EXTOL FLIGHT HEROES IN BORDER DEFENSE
 Heroic Air Defense Commander
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 9 Apr 79 p 2
 [Article by Pan Zongde [3382 1350 1795]]
 [Text]  "Follow me, charge!"      This is the code of action of Li Zhonglin [2621 1813
 2651], the commander of an air defense regiment on the Yunnan border and it is a
 true portrait of his revolutionary spirit and soldierly life.
 On 17 February, Li Zhonglin's regiment was responsible for security patrol duty
 in the battle zone in conjunction with a protective counterattack and defensive
 border battle by the army.  When Li Zhonglin laid out the order of battle at the
 regimental party committee meeting, he bravely put himself in the first echelon
 and demanded that the higher authorities give him the most arduous mission.  At
 7:15, four green signal flares rose into the sky and immediately there was the
 roar of engines on the airfield.  "Follow me, charge!"  Regimental Commander Li
 led the first echelon and flew majestically toward the battle zone, ever vigilantly
 patrolling the skies over the motherland's border.
 One time, in coordination with the surface units which were punishing the Vietnamese
 invaders, the upper echelons ordered Regimental Commander Li's regiment to help spot
 where our artillery's shells were landing in the battle. zone.  "Follow me, charge!"
 Again, Regimental Commander Li took the lead aircraft in the first echelon, and in
 close coordination with his wingmen vigilantly and nimbly circled and spotted.
 Suddenly, the radio in their aircraft malfunctioned in the microphone.  He
 quick-wittedly waggled his wings to signal to his wingmen.  Wingman number 3
 understood immediately and quickly moved to the front to continue spotting and
 successfully completed the mission.
 Patrol missions often set out and return before dawn and at twilight.   At such
 times the fog is very dense and visibility is low.  Flying under such conditions
 is very difficult.  So that everything would be perfectly safe, each time they had
 to fly under such weather conditions, Regimental Commander Li always shouted
 "Follow me, charge!"  and led everyone to battle through the difficulty.  Early
 one morning, Regimental Commander Li was in the first echelon returning from a
 patrol when unexpectedly the fog began to get thicker and they couldn't see the
 runways clearly.  Relying on mastery gained through many years of training, shortly

 before they reached the airfield, he alerted everyone to use their compass precisely
 and pay attention to getting a fix on the vertical ground markers on the field so
 as to determine their position.  Under his precise example and careful directions the
 entire unit landed safely and the pilots all respected Regimental Commander Li for
 being bold but cautious and commanding well.

 [Text]  On the morning of 20 February, as the fighting eagles returned from patrol
 one by one, the ground crew of the 20 Squadron carefully carried out a post-flight
 inspection.  The mechanic Liu Shahong [2692 3097 31631 nimbly finished inspecting
 aircraft number 73's intake and then inspected the jet.  At the time the jet was
 still over 63? C, so the acting master mechanic had little Liu inspect it again
 early the next morning.  Liu Shahong thought that the fighting eagles had to go into
 combat at any time and if when he inspected it the next morning he discovered some
 obstruction that couldn't be eliminated promptly.it would keep the aircraft from going
 into battle.  He decided that he definitely could not have a chance for combat
 bungled because he did not do his job well and so insisted on completing his task.
 He made his way into the jet and got soaking wet from sweat in the hot interior.
 Holding a light he conducted a careful inspection of the fuel ring and the flow
 regulator and discovered a carbon buildup about the size of a fingernail in the
 precombustion chamber.  He determined that this was the damaged part and promptly
 reported this to the leader.  Then along with the rest of the comrades in the crew
 he worked through the night until 5:20 changing the afterburner.  Because they
 promptly got rid of this serious obstruction, they guaranteed the fighting prepared-
 ness of this young eagle.  For this reason, the upper echelons awarded Liu Shahong,
 Merit Citation Class III.

 After the self-defense counterattack and defensive border war broke out, each day
 this group was on the spot for 19 hours.  Although the drain on the comrades'
 strength was great, everyone maintained high fighting morale and continued to
 fight without fear of fatigue.  Deputy Regimental Commander Xia Youcai [1115 0645

 One day they were on orders to patrol on China's side of the China-Vietnam border.
 Their flight suits were soaked with sweat but no one complained.  At 13,000 meters
 Deputy Group Commander Wu.Chunfa [0702 2504 4099] and pilot Chen Xiaodong [7115
 2556 2639] suddenly discovered something suspicious.  Wu Chunfa immediately alerted
 Chen Xiaodong to keep an eye out.  They kept careful watch, ready to fight at any
 time, until the suspected target disappeared and they victoriously returned.  At
 the same time that they were frequently going into combat, this group also took on
 training missions with other units.  In leading they came up with an idea and
 sent experienced pilots to four airfields to coordinate training and study tactical
 techniques for destroying enemy aircraft.  Through this training the air combat level
 of this and the other units was raised a great deal.
 In 20-odd days' time they completed all combat missions assigned by the upper
 echelons and received the praise of the leadership and comrades of the Yunnan Front
 Line Air Force units.
 Cargo Plane Crew Alert
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 9 Apr 79 p 2
 [Text]  Female pilot Wang Shuran's [3769 3219 5333] air crew of a regiment of the
 air force's air arm was cited for meritorious service 3rd class in carrying out an
 urgent airlift mission in the self-defense counterattack and border defense.
 During the 9 days that they were executing the mission, they.flew over 6 hours each
 day and the longest they were on the ground was 20 hours.  Sometimes before a mission
 was completed, and the aircraft was still in the air, orders for another were
 received over the radio.  Sometimes, just as a mission was completed and the air
 crew comrades had gone to bed to rest they were immediately recalled for a new
 mission.  However  complex and difficult the mission, however short the time, how-
 ever difficult the conditions, they were always filled with pride and enthusiasm,
 fearlessly, they thought single-mindedly of the needs of the'front and did everything
 to insure victory in combat.  One time, they had loaded their cargo at an airfield
 and were just ready to take off when suddenly they discovered that the braking
 parachute a fighter had used when landing had not yet been retrieved and at the
 same time a rear fighter flight was ready to take off for combat.  If they took
 off as usual on time, the braking chute might get wound around the propellor blades
 but if the plane did not take off promptly it would have an effect on the rear
 fighter flight taking off.  It was a critical situation and there could not be any
 delay.  The air crew comrades bravely, resourcefully and in close coordination
 took off along the side of the runway in between the fighter takeoffs.  They coped
 with this complex situation successfully and their cargo got to its destination on
 time.
 The good cooperative spirit and strong battle style of Wang Shufeng's air crew is
 inseparable from their highly developed sense of "liangzhang yiyuan" [0357 7022 0001
 0765].  Air crew leader Wang Shufeng, party group leader Feng Gaijin 7458 2395 0603]
 and safetyman Yang Qinglong [2799 7230 7893], were true to the great trust of the
 party organization and the confidence of their comrades.  They conscientiously did
 their duty, made strict demands on themselves and served as a model in everything
 they did.  Thus they spurred on all personnel in the air crew to stand fast at their
 posts, help each other, not fear difficulties, unite and fight, and relying on their
 collective wisdom and thus strengthen completely their mission in an outstanding way.

 SAGA OF YOUNG SOLDIER'S SACRIFICE FOR MOTHERLAND
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 9 Apr 79 p 1

 [0491 3134] and Wang Jianguo [3769 1696 0948]:  "Charges Ahead to Heroic Sacrifice
 for the Motherland and for the People; Cadre's Son Zhen Ping [3914 1627] A Fearless
 New Generation Hero; Zhen Wenlin [3914 2429 2651] Martyr's Father and Deputy
 Director of Political Section Says Zhen Ping Lived up to the Fostering of the Party
 and People and Died a Glorious Death"]
 [Text]  At 1643 on 27 February, two white signal flares rose over the peak of Kouma
 Mountain reporting that the gate to Liang Mountain was open.  Zhen Wenlin,  deputy
 director of a political section who was just then at the command post in the rear,
 received a message relayed from the frontlines:  His son Zhen Ping had led the first
 charge of the First Platoon, Company Eight on Kouma Mountain and herocially sacri-
 ficed his life.  Deputy Director Zhen thought for a moment then said calmly to the
 comrade beside him: A price must always be paid for revolution, and that's what his
 death was.
 To commend Zhen Ping's meritorious deeds in battle, the league and party committees
 have petitioned the higher authorities to bestow on him the title of Combat Hero.
 During his lifetime, Comrade Zhen Ping's behavior was commendable.  In 1974, after
 graduation from senior middle school at the age of 17, with the encouragement of
 and support of his parents he went to a rural area for labor training and in 1977
 he was recruited into the army from the hydroelectric power station where he was
 working.  In the army he was modest and prudent and studied hard to get ahead.  He
 was on good terms with soldiers from worker and peasant backgrounds.  In all things
 he took the lead and served as a model.  He was evaluated as a model member, a
 pacesetter who studied Lei Feng and a training pacesetter.  A year after joining
 the army he entered the party and was called a superior student.  In March 1978
 he was promoted to squad leader and this January he was made platoon leader.
 Zhen Ping was filled with righteous indignation over constant encroachments of
 Chinese border regions by the Vietnamese reactionary authorities.  He wrote many
 statements of determination to the party branch requesting that he be allowed to
 participate in the battle to punish severely the Vietnamese invaders.  In a letter
 he wrote to his elder brother he said:  "I will charge ahead for the motherland and
 the people even if it is to my death!"  He said to his father, "Please don't worry.
 I won't embarrass the party and the people.  You will hear news of victory."

 On 26 February, Company Eight took on the mission of the main attack on Kouma
 Mountain.  At the branch committee meeting at the front, three infantry platoon
 leaders vied for the mission to be the assault platoon.  Zhen Ping repeatedly
 requested the mission and finally was given the task of being the assault platoon.
 Zhen Ping was very much aware that his responsibility was a heavy one:  Kouma
 Mountain is 800 meters high, the slopes are densely wooded and the terrain is
 irregular.  It is the sort of position that is easy to defend but difficult to
 attack:  It is very strategically located but with difficult access.  It is the
 gateway to Liang Mountain.  Whether or not Kouma Mountain could be taken on schedule
 would affect the general situation of the battle for Liang Mountain.  That night, he
 called the squad leaders and squad cadres together and engaging in military democracy,
 they studied the various methods of attack and drew up a battle plan.
 On 27 February, under cover of our artillery, Company Eight launched an attack on
 Kouma Mountain which was held by the enemy.  At 1535, Company Eight launched the
 final attack on the Kouma Mountain peak and Zhen Ping led the.entire platoon
 throughout the attack right at the very front of the company. Each time they made a
 breakthrough he fired off a signal flare to report to the command post that the
 assault platoon had reached its position.  Our support fire crept up toward the top
 of the mountain and Zhen Ping bravely attacked at a distance of only about 20 meters
 behind the point where our shells were landing.  Sometimes he would crawl forward,
 other times he would bound, organizing the platoon's fire as they wiped out three
 enemy gun positions in succession, right up to the peak.  Our cannons had barely
 stopped when Zhen Ping charged to a point only 25 meters from the enemy entrenchment
 on the mountain top.  The enemy hiding in the gun emplacement had not expected that
 our infantry detachment could move this fast and without looking threw handgrenades.
 One by one the handgrenades flew smoking over the heads of the platoon comrades.
 Zhen Ping shouted:  "Wipe out the enemy gun position!"  The entire platoon opened
 fire together.  Just as Zhen Ping had.climbed over the entrenchment and raised the
 signal gun to fire a flare reporting victory a surviving enemy soldier hidden in
 the bunker fired a shot and Zhen Ping fell.
 With a cry of "Avenge platoon leader Zhen!" the comrades of Company Eight thoroughly
 destroyed the surviving enemy soldiers and took firm control of the main peak of
 Kouma Mountain.  At this time our infantry, artillery and armored units were
 struggling up along the winding trail of the lower part of Kouma Mountain.
 On 28 February, Deputy Director Zhen came from the command post to Youyiguan to bid
 farewell to the son who had lost his life for the motherland.  Beside his son's
 body he said resolutely, "You fought for the motherland and the people, you have
 lived up to the fostering of the party and the people.  Your death. is a glorious
 one."  Deputy Director Zhen requested that his son's body be buried on a hill
 beside Youyiguan where the border of the motherland could be seen, together with
 the other martyrs who had sacrificed for the motherland.  He took the uniform which
 had the hole of the enemy bullet and his son's bloodstains to give to his small
 grandson.

 MILITARY AND PUBLIC SECURITY
 YOUTH EXHORTED TO BE MODEL DEFENDERS OF MOTHERLAND
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 9 Apr 79 p 1
 [Article by Wu Zhang [0702 1757]:   "Two Generations of Heroes"]
 [TExt]  In the defensive counterattack, an army cadre went to the China-Vietnam
 border where he ran into his son who was a soldier in a border defense unit.  He
 spoke to his son in a sincere manner, "It is fitting that I should see you now. There
 is only one goal, and I hope that in battle you will not prove to be an unworthy
 son."  The boy replied with determination, "I'm worried about that too, and I've
 made a plan for winning honor."  The cadre then said, "The most important thing is
 to stick to your plan on the battlefield.  I just hope that in the battle charge
 you will be courageous and tenacious."  One of the leadership cadres from a forward
 unit learned of the son's brave sacrifice and said proudly, "The kid did the right
 thing.  He was not untrue to the training of the party."  In this self-defense
 counterattack, such leadership cadres have encouraged their children to win honor
 for the motherland and there are a great many children of cadres who have bravely
 killed the enemy.
 Hearing these heart-wrenching stories is like hearing a clear and majestic song:
 "Hark, the mother is calling the son to fight in the East...."  One cannot help
 recalling the lines written by Chen Yi exhorting sons and daughters:  "The people
 reared you, repay them by winning honor.  If the motherland is in trouble, you
 should be in the vanguard."  In this defensive border war, the glorious tradition
 of our party and army has burst forth with dazzling brilliance, too.
 What parent does not love his child, and what parent does not look forward to his
 child's future?  Yet there are different ideas on the kind of future and how it can
 be achieved.  In the view of a Communist Party member, children are not one's
 private property.  Only by educating children to make a contribution to the people's
 enterprise do parents feel they have fulfilled their responsibility.  They detest
 and reject seeking a way out for their children, proceeding from selfish motives,
 to spoil their children and even to use improper means to curry favor on their
 behalf.  Ordinarily, they demand that their children study and work hard to do their
 little bit to help build socialism.  Once it becomes necessary they generously send
 their children to the front, with the same lofty sentiments and aspirations they
 had when they joined the revolution in their youth.  They urge their children
 courageously to kill the enemy and not hesitate to lay down their lives for their
 country.  In particular they scorn the individualistic and mean behavior of those
 who hold back their children at the critical moment.

 Such parents are farsighted and know how to love and rear their sons and daughters.
 They definitely do not keep their sons and daughters under their wings but let them
 go and do battle with the wind and rain.  They understand that "A good sword comes
 from hardening; the fragrance,.ofplum flowers comes from the bitter cold."  If they
 want their children to make something of themselves, they should not begrudge letting
 them go into the furnace of revolution and be smelted in the fierce flames.  Of
 course, they hope that their children will become scientists, engineers and
 brilliant military commanders and make an even greater contribution to the four
 modernizations.  They also know very well that relying on a comfortable home, lots
 of money and high class furnishings cannot pave the way for seizing the "jewel in
 the mathematical crown."  Thus they encourage their sons and daughters to go to the
 difficult places. required for the four modernizations and to the battlefields to
 protect the four modernizations and be tempered in the flames.
 We extol the heroic older generation for being broadminded and farsighted; we also
 extol the heroic younger generation for its soaring aspirations and heroic vigor.
 Our promising younger generation understands that like father, like son does not
 necessarily mean that they are good people; one who relies on a "good daddy, good
 mama and good patron" in order to loaf about, can only turn into a good-for-nothing
 and be detrimental to the moetherland, the people and oneself.  The early realization
 of the four modernizations brings joy to working under hard conditions--making their
 home wherever they are and bravely shouldering heavy burdens.  When it is necessary
 to use their youth and ardor to protect the four modernizations, they step forward
 bravely and are honor-bound not to turn back.  A long time ago Gorki said "Because
 of their intense yearning for a happy life, one frequently sees among young people,
 those who do not treasure the things that others have won for them; one can also
 see some impetuous hawks who fancy too early that they have a comfortable roost.
 They are in too much of a hurry to enjoy the achievements of the present without a
 care for the future and they no longer strive to consolidate and strengthen this
 glorious thing which is beautiful but which still faces difficult times."  This
 message is doubly touching when read now.  At a time when these cadres' sons and
 daughters must be models among the soldiers in the border defense, have not many
 young people, including cadres' sons and daughters, gotten rid of the defect of
 "too early fancying they have a comfortable roost"?

 SOLDIER SUGGESTS IMPROVEMENTS IN TACTICS, EQUIPMENT
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 9 Apr 79 p 3
 [Article by Lo [7482] [given name unreadable]:  "Suggestions on Improving Tactics,
 Equipment"]
 [Text]  Comrade editor
 I am a soldier in the China-Vietnam border self-defense counterattack.  All of our
 officers and men are brave and tenacious in battle and have won great victories
 against the Vietnamese aggressors.  Through battle experience we have proposed a
 number of issues in strategy and tactics which should get some serious attention
 and should be improved in the future.  On the basis of my own experience I would
 like to discuss several suggestions here.
 1.  When fighting in hilly and forested areas against an enemy who has taken
 defensive precautions and can operate in a dispersed fashion, we should not use
 conventional daytime attack methods with large units.  In battle the Vietnamese
 soldiers holding hilltops were frequently few in number, but our armies attacked with
 concentrated units of company or even batallion strength, which is like hitting a
 flea with a fist:  It wastes manpower and increases casualties.  In a strategic
 campaign, "using an ox cleaver to kill a chicken" is undoubtedly correct, specifically
 each battle move should be applied flexibly on the basis of such objective factors
 as intelligence on the enemy, terrain and weather.  The reason our army fought
 better and better in the last stage of the self-defense counterattack is that we
 understood the enemy and had flexible command and tactics.
 2.  The most threatening thing to an attack in mountainous areas is an established
 enemy firing point.  It is difficult to wipe out an entire unit with patterned
 artillery fire; field artillery are numerically few and inconvenient to move;
 bazookas are not very effective against established firing points.  Frequently,
 demolition teams use satchel charges, torpedoes and hand grenades to destroy them,
 but this greatly delays the speed of attack.  If the explosive performance of
 bazookas were modified, it would greatly reduce casualties and speed up the attack.
 3.  The semiautomatic rifle's rate of fire is too slow and they are becoming less
 and less suited to modern warfare.  In terms of accurate firing, within 400 meters
 there is hardly any difference from the submachine gun (in single shots).  Due to
 the extensive use of cannons, light weapons are mostly used between 200 and several

 tens of meters and at such times, the submachine gun is the most useful and its
 power can be fully employed.  I propose that the semiautomatic rifle be replaced
 as soon as possible by the submachine gun or small-caliber high-speed, fully
 automatic rifle.
 4.  The present equipment for the individual soldier is of no advantage in combat
 and not just because it is heavy.  The crisscrossing of equipment straps and belts
 is very inconvenient.  Hand grenades, cartridge pouch, canteen, satchel, gas mask
 and submachine gun (or semiautomatic rifle), etc. brings to 6 or 7 the number of
 straps around the neck.  When on the march in the moutains, there is also a back
 pack and every so often they all have to be readjusted, otherwise the straps get
 so tight you can't breathe.  When we engage the enemy and jump forward under enemy
 fire, these equipment straps are extremely inconvenient.  Soldiers hope that this
 can be changed very soon.
 5.  Physically strong soldiers should be chosen to be frontline medics.  Those
 wounded at the frontlines cannot be sent to the rear promptly mainly because the
 medics are physically weak, so the soldiers have to help each other to the rear
 areas and this creates a group of temporary noncombatants and weakens the unit's
 fighting strength.
 6.  The steel helmut is a necessary piece of equipment for the soldier and should
 be provided.  Under enemy sniper fire, hand grenades and artillery attacks, some
 soldiers have suffered head injuries and some have even died of head injuries from
 stray bullets a thousand meters distant from the enemy.  If they had a steel helmut,
 many would have avoided such an injury.
 I believe that those who fought in this self-defense counterattack could recount
 more and better experiences.  So that our army can rapidly modernize to suit the
 demands of modernized warfare, we urgently hope that the higher leadership and
 revelant departments will pay heed to the experience of this war and rapidly take
 effective steps so that our army's tactical thinking and weaponry will be greatly
 improved.
