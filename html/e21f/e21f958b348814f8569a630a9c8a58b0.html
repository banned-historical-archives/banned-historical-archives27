 Briefly Noted
 Su`,,arno Decree Curbs "Subversives,l
 A new decree was ut into effect in Indonesia on 22 October
 providing for penalties ranging from 23 years in prison to death
 for any subversive activities against ''resident Sukarno's govern-
 ment.               The decree is one of the strongest ever issued by the
 Su`carno government and restores powers to the government that
 it had under martial lac,.  The decree carries a possible death
 sentence for:
 Distorting, deviating or undermining the ideology
 and policy of the State;
 Overthrowing, damaging or undermining the authority
 of the government;
 Creating unrest, chaos, and feelings of enmity
 among the rndonesian nonulation or between the Indo-
 nesian government and friendly nations;
 Expressing sympathy with an enemy of the republic
 or a state which is not friendly toward Indonesia.
 We call attention to the extreme harshness of this decree
 and particularly to the vagueness of its generalized terms
 which make it possible to punish anything except the most ser-
 vile attitude toward Sukarno and his government.   In those
 countries that will send teams to Ganefo, we warn the partici-
 pants that they must under no circumstances discuss politics
 or even listen to others discuss politics unless they want to
 run the risk of execution or of spending years in Sukarno's
 jails.
 Soviets Forego Race to Moon
 In a statement of 23 October, Ithrushchev said that the
 Soviet Union was not at present planning flights of cosmonauts
 to the moon, and he "wished the Americans success" in their
 efforts.  While the Soviets have always avoided committing
 themselves to reaching the moon first, competition with the
 US has been accented throughout the history of the Soviet
 space program.  Decause the US did not need such large rockets
 .or its more sophisticated bombs, and because American leaders
 c:id not at first regard themselves as competing with the
 Soviets in space activity,  the Soviets had an easy time to be-
 gin ti'ith in "outdoing" the US in space.  As Americans toots up
 the challenge, the competition became more intense.  Now
 ICIarushchev is de-emphasizing this competition.   It is likely

 (Briefly Noted Cont.)               4MOM
 that his space program, considered wildly extravagant by many
 Soviet citizens, is bein  cut back in favor of fertilizer and
 agricultural equipment Programs; Khrushchev said explicitly
 that there would be no diversion of funds from defense for
 agriculture, so presumably funds and resources had`  -be di-
 verted from other activities, apparently from space.
 We should realize, however, that (as 'resident Kennedy
 has pointed out) Nhrushchev did not renounce space activity.
 It is still possible that the Soviets may achieve a rendezvous
 in space, or something similar, and if they do this, they will
 of course make propaganda with it.   It is also possible that
 the renunciation may be a feint, designed to bring about a
 slow-down in the US space program.   Such a slow-down might en-
 able the Soviets to  be first to the moon after all; they may
 not be able to compete with an aroused US, but (as in the case
 of their first successes) they can easily outdo a passive US.
 In our assets, we should make continuing reference to
 T'hrushchev's denial that the USSP is engaged in a race to the
 moon, using it to ex-)lode the "wave of the future" concept.
 At this point we do not emphasize the possibility of a change
 in the US program, or-fhe oossibility that Xhrushchev may be
 trying to effect such a change, but we carefully avoid sug-
 gesting that the Soviet space program has been terminated.
 Similarly, if there should be a slow-down in the US progrmi,
 we are careful not to say that it has been discontinued.
 Chinese Question Soviet 17heat Purchase
 The 13 October issue of Phnom =enh's Chinese Communist
 daily Shen Huo V7u '?ao (Life Evening News) carries a front-page
 editorial under the headline:   "Why Doesn't the Soviet Union
 Buy 'wheat from China?"  The editorial wonders why the Soviet
 Union should buy wheat from a capitalist country rather than
 from "friends" such as Communist China, and adds that the USSR
 would be better off in getting the grain from China because
 China "understands mercy and morality."  '?ublicize this story
 as an example not only of Communist China's duplicity in offer-
 ing the Soviet Union grain which she herself does not possess
 in sufficient quantities to feed her own people, but also as
 an example of the wait that Communist countries are now busy
 playing the same dirty propaganda tricks on each other that
 they used to reserve for the capitalist countries.

 PROPAGANDIST'S GUIDE TO COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 #15
 Commentary
 12-25 October 1963
 Principle Developments:
 1.  The Chinese fired only one heavy round in the battle
 of polemics during this period, a 10,000-word article dated
 21 October entitled:   "Apologists of Neocolonialism," the fourth
 in the series of joint Red Flag-People's Daily editorials com-IMU menting on the 14 July       open letter . ree preceding
 articles were dated September 6, 13 and 26, respectively.)  In a
 further effort to establish their right to leadership of the
 Afro-Asian-Latin American world, the Chinese lambasted Soviet
 positions on revolution and national liberation -- and Soviet
 "peddling the 'theory of racism,"'-- accusing the cPSU leaders
 of being "mortally afraid of conflict with the imperialists"
 and thus set on "opposing the national liberation movement."
 In direct affront, they repeatedly cited Stalin, who in 1925
 had "fought the liquidationists represented by the Trotslsyites
 and Zinovievites"; his "warning is of serious, practical s nifi-
 cance for the present leaders of the CPSU."
 2.  Soviet media continued to pour forth a barrage of
 anti-Chinese materials (see Chronology, October 21, for a
 Chinese account of the scale and nature of the Soviet campaign),
 topped by another massive editorial in the CPSU theoretical
 journal Kommunist, October issue (see October 23), which accuses
 the Chinese o   Tana  empt to replace Leninism with 'Mao Tse-
 tungism,"' describes the Peking campaign as "an offensive against
 the very mainstays of Marxism-Leninism, unprecedented since the
 era of Trotskyism," and calls upon every Communist everywhere to
 "fulfill hi'nternational duty" by helping to stop the Chinese
 before it is too late.  The editorial charges that the Chinese,
 having decided to split the ICM and create some now movement
 to serve their special aims, are "inspiring and supporting" anti-
 party groups in other countries and trying to "knock together an
 international bloc" out of "all sorts of unprincipled and
 corrupt elements," mostly expellees from CP's.  Kommunist de-
 clares, however, that 65 Communist parties have already exTressed,
 in official decisions, their full support of the CPSU, while
 condemning the Peking splitters.
 3.  Two other Soviet items are worthy of note.   Izvestiya
 earlier (12 October) carried an article by an elderly M
 member, who, with the authority of one who "had worked under
 Lenin's direct guidance for many years," branded the present
 Chinese course as a "Trotskyite attempt to revise Leninism" and
 called on all CommuniSght against the   inese splitters."
 (Revisionism has been applied to the Chinese in several recent
 Soviet-attuned statements.)  And the Pravda Ukrainy article by
 Kozovoy on 16 October was distinguished  rom mos  soviet output

 by its (Albanian-like) sarcastically vitriolic style and its
 sharp argumentation. Kozovoy cited a statistical survey demon-
 strating the predominately "non-Marxist-Leninist" (and heavily
 Stalinist) origins of "Mao Tse-tungism," and also expanded on
 the theme (now appearing frequently in Soviet articles, see also
 Red Star, October 19, and Kommunist, October 23) that China's
 erroneous policies and attitudes s em largely from the "petit
 bourgeois element" in the CCP.
 4.  Western correspondents and other observers in Moscow
 have increasingly assumed that representatives of most major
 parties (estimates say 25) will meet in Moscow for the 7 Novem-
 ber anniversary of the Soviet Revolution to deal with the
 Chinese challenge, although the consensus seems to be that such
 a meeting will only prepare the ground for convening a confer-
 ence of the entire WCM early in 1964.

 t
 ppor
 neither the Soviets
 nor the Chinese."  Meanwhile, the Swedish CP daily Ny Dag carried
 a highly interesting article (October 15) expressing  ncependent
 criticism of certain characteristic features of Communism as
 practiced in Communist states.
 6.   In a surprise development the Central Committee of
 the Italian Cp issued a 12,000-word statement which, while
 criticizing a series of Chinese positions as distorted and utter-
 ly wrong, expressed strong reservations against holding a
 conference of world Communist parties at this time, since the
 necessary conditions should be created and complex preparatory
 work carried out first.
 Significance;
 At the time of our last issue, there was evidence that the
 Soviet leadership had decided to push ahead with preparations
 for a conference of the World Communist Movement which might
 have been intended to maneuver the Chinese into a position of
 excommunicating themselves.  Until the last day of the period,
 further evidence tended to confirm such an assumption, with the
 important October Kommunist article providing additional grounds
 for such action and cawing that 65 parties are already march-
 ing in formation with the CPSU.
 Although there has been conflicting reporting regarding
 specific Soviet plans, it seemed likely that they intended to
 take advantage of the customary attendance of representatives
 of most major parties at the anniversary of the Soviet Revolution
 in Moscow to get pro forma approval of plans for convening a
 conference of all part ei    a few months hence and for a "draft
 declaration" which would fulfill Soviet needs.

 However, the adoption on the 25th by the important Italian
 CP of its statement opposing such a conference at this time
 emphasized by Pravda's publication of excerpts of same on the
 28th -- introduced aew element of doubt, and some observers
 also saw significance in Khrushchev's simultaneous effort to
 gloss over the conflict and call for an end to polemics in his
 remarks to left-wing journalists.
 As of our cut-off date, then, we can only say that the
 state and future development of world Communism seem to be
 growing steadily more confused and uncertain, providing increas-
 ing opportunities as well as challenges for the alert propagan.

 12-25 October 1963
 October 12 - Izvestiya features an article by  Yelena Stasova,
 a Pay member since 898 who worked under Lenin's direct
 guidance for many years," showing how the present Chinese stand
 coincides with that of the Trotskyites, -- so much so that it
 has already earned a letter o  gra     de from the Fourth Inter-
 national.  The "all or nothing at all" thesis is a rehash of
 Trotsky's erroneous and dangerous thesis of "neither peace nor
 war," and the same is true of other Chinese theories.
 "All Party members familiar with the Party's his-
 tory and having extensive experience in practical
 activity can readily discern that the present
 course of the CCP leadership is a Trotskyite at-
 tempt to revise Leninism on an international
 sca e....    firmly  e  eve that all members of
 the communist parties will give a worthy rebuff
 to the Chinese revisionists, who are encroaching
 on the most sac-r-0 cause in the present stage of
 development -- the unity of the world communist
 and workers movement.   All Communists must fight
 against the Chinese splitters.   This struggle must
 be wage   with the utmost  .mp acability and consist-
 ency, just as Lenin and our entire Party waged it
 during the struggle against Trotskyism."
 Addressing a meeting in Melbourne, Australian CP Chairman
 Dixon condemns the Chinese leaders for their opposition to the
 test-ban treaty and their policy aimed at splitting the social-
 ist camp and world communism.  He also condemned the devisive
 and factional activities of E. F. Hill, a pro-Chicom leader and
 former ACp official who was recently expelled from the Party.
 (According to Tass.)
 October 13 - At a gathering of "nearly 200 Australian Marxist-
 in Melbourne to celebrate the CPR 14th anniversary,
 E. F. Hill  pays high tribute to "our Chinese comrades," who
 are defending "the great liberating role of Marxism-Leninism"
 against "fierce attack by the modern revisionists, at the head
 of whom stands Khrushchev ."   (NCNA)
 October 15 - The Swedish CP daily Ny Dag carries an article
 ai miming the fai ure o  die Communist party "in interest and
 maybe even abilT- y  to  ea  wa   certain basic
 problems,, out for special criticism such characteristic Soveti(and
 Chinese features as ri id centralization of economic planning

 Turning to "MAO Tse-tu  ism," Kozovoy notes that a survey of the
 list of sources use  in th6 six volumes of Mao's works shows
 Stalin infirst p ace with 24%.     "The works o     e  ounder of the
 nese na loner  re    g on,, Confucius, are second at 22%p with an
 additional 13% drawn from Chinese folklore, 12% from Lao-tse,
 and 7% from modern Chinese and foreign authors.     "References to

 Stalin s  ;ro  em's of Leninism' -- amount toon y     , an  those

 ing ad                       ona  gures on "the-peasant--clffaract er" of'Z ina and
 the CCP, B. Kozovoy says:   "Lenin always warned that the working
 class, particularly when in power, must with all seriousness
 reckon with a Petty bourgeois element in a peasant country..,.
 This is obviously also   a source not only of the bristlier
 militant nationalism of   a     nese leaders, but a so of their
 a veer urous econom c swoops.
 Among other Chinese "campaigns in connection with highly
 unexpected and whimsical causes," Kozovoy mentions "a peculiar
 crusade to exterminate sparrows" because they eat much grain,
 but now they have been "rehabilitated" because they destroy
 pests.: And finally, the writer d  tgi.`vely  relates how the Chinese
 leaders, despite Soviet warning that it was economically erroneous,
 "continue to proclaim their 'Great Leap Forward,' stat-
 ing irrevocably that the economy must develop by 'waves.'

 October 100 - Writing in Moscow's Trud on the Chinese "Trend to-
 war   equalization," V. SOrr~t_as that "Lenin considered
 mater 'Ia '- ncen ves and their combination with the enthusiasm of
 the working masses the only correct way to achieve concord between
 personal and public interests," and that "the Chinese leaders
 started to struggle against these Leninist principles asfar-"hack
 as 1955," when, 23 Oc o er,    eop e s      y appealed-to its
 readers:   'Ifyou wish Communism to come into being, renounce

 "How is it possible for the Titoite renegades to act
 so audaciously?  This is because certain persons, in
 flagrant violation of the 1957 Moscow declaration and
 1960 Moscow statement, are trying to mend for the
 Tito clique its threadbare cloak of pseudo-Marxism-
 Leninism, breathe life into this political =mom, and
 facilitate a renewal of its frantic opposition to
 Marxism-Leninism and its disruptive activities against
 the international Communist movement.  Nevertheless,
 no witchcraft, however "mysterious," can clear the
 Titoites of their crimes, turn these renegades into
 Communists and transform into an "advanced socialist"
 country one which is degenerating into a capitalist
 country."
 Moscow's Red Star features an article by one prof. M.
 Ukraintsev which  pro des a true explanation of the present
 economic difficulties in the PR" in reply to "attempts by the
 Peking press to depict Soviet economic aid to China in a dis-
 torted light and place blame ... directly on the Soviet Union."
 After rehashing familiar statistics on Soviet technical assistance,
 he says:
 "Unfortunately, successes in carrying out the social-
 ist transformation of the country and fulfilling the
 first 5-year plan went to Chinese leaders' heads.
 They decided that they could cope with the mos  fan-
 tastic and unrealistic tasks and embarked upon r sky
 econom c exper m::nts.... egan to ignore the experi-
 ence of other socialist countries... juxtaposed the
 law of planned proportional development with their
 'law' of the leap forward .... It was thus evident that
 the influence of petit-bourgeois ideology, which was
 also the source of leftist deviations an  attempts To
 s io the socialist stage of building, was affecting
 e     nese  ea ersh p.  Their nationalistic and
 avant-gardist tendencies were reflected in their
 efforts to prove that they had found the shortest
 path to Communism and therefore should stand at the
 head of the World Communist Movement."
 Why do the Chinese leaders blacken the USSR and blame it?  "The
 CCP leaders hope that by having provoked an anti-Soviet mood in
 their own country they will be able to justify the present turn-
 about in policy and escape responsibility for their serious mis-
 takes in guidance of the national economy."

 Neocolonialism.-  (First 3 articles dated September r5, 13, an
 begins with a di.3cussion of the evils of neocolonialism
 and of CPSU "Prescri:ptiors for Abolishing the Revolution of the
 Oppressed  ations:"
 "The first prescription is labeled peaceful coexistence
 and peaceful c%s etai.tion.      The seco` nd ... id-to
 backward countries... .   To speak plainly, the policy
 and purpose o  the leaders of the CPSU in their aid to
 newly independent countries in recent years are open to
 suspicion.  They often. take an attitude of great-power
 cha-uvinisnd and national egoism....
 The third ... disarmament....?.Ehrushchev here sounds
 like a preacher.  Down rodden people of the wor  ,
 you are bl_e_ss__e3! If only you are patient, if only
 You wait until the imperialists lay down their arms,
 freedom will descend upon you.... This is not just the
 fostering of illusions; it is opium for the people.
 The fourth ... elimination of colonialism through the
 United  a ions...."rn a speech at the      General
 Assembly ineptember 1960, Khrushchev asked:  'Who,
 if not the U-.N. Organization, should champion the
 abolition of the colonial system of government?' ...
 what he really means ... is looking to the imperial-
 ists for help."
 The article repeatedly cites Stalin, who in 1925 had
 "fought the liquidationists, represented by the Trotslkyites and
 Zinovievites," and uses his words in accusing the      leaders
 of taking "the path of nationalism and degeneration":
 "Stalin depicted the line of thinking of the liquida-
 tionists as follows:
 Support the liberation movement in China?  But why?
 Wouldn't that be dangerous?  Wouldn't it bring us
 into conflict with other countries?  Wouldn't it be
 better if we established 'spheres of influence' in
 China in conjunction with other 'advanced' powers
 and snatched something from China for our own bene-
 fit?  That would be both useful and safe ... etc.
 The present leaders of the CPSU have gone farther than
 the old liquidationsists.  Priding themselves on their
 cleverness, they only take up what is 'Both useful an
 sae     mortally afraid o  being  nvo ved in conflict
 with the imperialist countries, they have set    eir
 minds on opposing the national liberation movemen .
 They are intoxicated with the   ea of the two
 superpowers  establishing spheres of  n  uence
 throughout the world."

 October 23 - Tass summarizes a 30-page-plus editorial in the
 laces   ommunlBf-'on "the campaign launched in Peking against
 fratern-TaMmmunist parties," which it calls "an offensive
 against the very mainstays of Marxism Leninism.
 "Great damage is being inflicted upon the cause of
 socialian the entire revolutionary movement, and
 every Communist, no matter in what country he lives
 or     n what situation he is struggling for his ideals,
 must fulfill his international duty -- to do every-

 direction that    a people  n Peking want them to
 take.   If this is not done in time  the consequences
 for the en re Communist movement may  a very    ave."
 The article charges the Chinese with attempting "to replace
 Leninism with 'Mao Tse-tungism,t" and with having "decided to-`-"
 sp t e international Communist movement and to create some new
 movement un er their aegis in order  o ac ieve their aims.
 They consider discrediting the CPSU as the shortest road to this."
 The CCP's own political and ideological conceptions "in many
 respects coincide with those of the Trotskyites," it reiterates.
 The article accuses the Peking leaders of inspiring and
 supporting various anti-party, factional groups in other countries,
 obviously trying to knock together an international bloc out of
 such grooups and groupings, mostly consisting of people yr   were
 expelled from Communist parties -- all sorts of unprincipled ele-
 ments."  However, says Kommunist, "65 parties have already ex-
 pressed , in official decisions, their fu   solidarity with and
 support for the ... CPSU ... and condemned the Peking sp     ters."

 resses lilt mself to "the utter groundlessness of the claim of the
 Chinese leaders to speak on behalf of the people of Asia, Africa
 and Latin ?merica."  "Using demagogic ultrarevolutionary phrases
 as a cover," they have "sunk into the morass of narrow nationalism
 and renounced the principles of proletarian internationalism."

 October 25 - A CC plenum of the Italian CP adopted a 12,000-word

 in  rv3a on the 28th) which, while criticizing a whole series

 par  es at this time,  in tune with  og  a    s standing ca
 or   po ycen r sm,  the statement maintains that "Unity in
 diversity and autonomy are realistic and indispensable in present
 conditions."  But it would be impossible to discuss and analyze
 new problems which are emerging today in the present conditions.
 Thus it is necessary to create certain conditions not existing
 today and to carry out "complex preparatory work" first.

 These are but a few of the many manifestations showing
 that the Chinese Communists are going all-out in building a
 gigantic international propaganda network capable of supporting
 a full-fledged international Communist organization of her own.
 Whether or not the Chinese Communists will formally announce
 the creation of such an organization remains a matter for

 many of the preparations necessary to such a move.

 Indian Communism in Turmoil
 by Harry Gelman
 3)ITO S' NOTfi2:   In a r,3revious article for this journal
 ("`,he Indian C? Between Moscow and ?e'.in , " No.6, 1962),
 Mr. :'arry Gelman examined the impact of the Sino-Soviet con-
 flict on the internal unity of the Indian party.  Eere, he
 brings the story up to date, showing how later developments
 i : that conflict have split the C"11 wide open, leaving it
 te:.1Dorarily under control of the pro--Soviet faction.
 IN MID-OCTOB3 ,. of 1962, on the eve of the Chinese mili-
 tary offensive in India, the Communist ':arty of India C"?I)
 was  in n:?rilous straits.  Though its position as the second
 largest party in India had been reaffirmed in the national
 elections only eight months before, the CPI was desperately
 divided.  On one hand was the right-wing majority faction of
 the party, led by the new party chairman, S. A. ?range: this
 faction was still fairly loyal to the C'?SU; it was willing
 to carve Soviet foreign .policy interests by -preserving a mod-
 erate line toward the "national bourgeois" government of
 rime Minister Nehru; and it was anxious for the party to
 ta'.~e a position on the Sino-Indian border dispute which would
 not isolate it from outraged Indian nationalist opinion.  On
 the other side was a powerful left-wing minority, well repre-
 sented in the central party organs, and particularly well
 entrenched in control of certain orovlncial party committees
 (such as those of jest 3engal and ?unjab) which through long
 habits of CPI indis 3i:!;_.:...: had become       independent king-
 doms supporting policies often incompatible with those of the
 central party leadership.  The left faction was by now vo-
 ciferous in its criticism of the C'?S;J and its expression of
 sympathy for the CC?; it was openly sympathetic toward the
 hard, militant line on Nehru urged by ?eking; and it was ada-
 mant in refusing to admit that"socialist China could commit
 aggressions," no matter what this refusal cost the CPI.  The
 tension within the party seemed such  'gat a dramatic worsening
 of either the Sino-Soviet or the Sino-Indian conflicts might
 be  the  start of an open :party split.
 3oth conflicts indeed worsened dramatically in late Oc-
 tober:   and the beginnings of a split in the Indian party have
 since then become discernible.
 T}   CHINESE O31T311.AL ATTACK in the Northeast Frontier
 Agency (N":3FA) and LacW,h areas on October 23 marked a watershed

 for the C?I, both in its attitude toward the Nehru government
 and in its relations with the world Communist movement.  111,or
 the time being, this event left the  ?I no more room for equi-
 vocation.   If the party did not issue a forthright condemnation
 of  eking and pledge of support for the national government, it
 could expect most of the no'ular support it had painfully built
 up over the last decade to disappear rapidly; quite possible,
 the :arty itself might lose legal status.  Right-wing C?I
 leaders such as Dange and provincial party committees led by
 the rightist faction therefore responder immediately with pub-
 lic denunciations of the Chinese t--ression; but the CpI itself
 did not take an offical stand until the party's National Coun-
 cil issued a resolution on November 1.  :yuring the twelve days
 between October 2D and November 1 two momentous events occurred
 to affect that resolution.
 First, on October 22, the Cuban crisis began, and the
 Soviet Union apparently saw an overriding emergency touching
 on Soviet interest more vital than the need to preserve the
 Soviet position in India.  On October 25, for the first and
 last time in three years of Sino-Indian border controversy,
 Pravda published an editorial siding with ?eking.  This edito-
 rimplied doubt of the validity of the MacMahon line as the
 border in the rt3*'A area, explicitly praised and endorsed the
 Chinese proposals for a ceasefire, oiposed preconditions for a
 ceasefire (on which New Delhi was insisting) and called on
 Indian "progressives" (i.e., the C?I) to restrain themselves
 and their government.   It seems likely that Moscow took this
 drastic step as a gesture seeking bloc solidarity at a time
 of military crisis.   It is possible that a subsidiary motive,
 however, was a Soviet hope to buy Chinese forbearance in the
 event that a bacl;down on Cuba became necessary.
 If the Soviets did entertain such a hope, it quickly
 proved illusory, for when Yhrushchev did back down over Cuba
 the Chinese proceeded to scourge him unmercifully in their
 propaganda as an appeaser; they continue to do so to the pre-
 sent day.   In the meantime, the Chinese made it plain that the
 gesture of appeasement the USSR had made toward them over India
 ,was entirely insufficient.  On October 27 fen-min M--pao
 ,hinted an editorial attack on "Nehru's ph  osophy" which went
 much further than an editorial on this subject published by the
 Chinese party organ in May 1959, shortly after the Tibetan re-
 volt.  Whereas in the earlier case Nehru had been depicted con-
 descendingly as a confused and vacillating leader whose policy
 was nevertheless "generally favorable," now he was said to
 have acted all along as a conscious agent of "reactionaries"
 and "imperialism" on really important questions of domestic
 and foreign policy.  The Indian Communist '?arty was sternly
 admonished not to "trail behind" this reprobate by echoing his
 accusations against "eking, and S.A. mange was dgrogated as a
 "so-called" Marxist-Leninist for having done so.    Finally,

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000200040001-6
 with regard to the Soviet Union, the editorial made it clear
 that nothing short of a direct condemnation of Nehru and India
 (which "ravda of October 25 had not contained) would satisfy
 ?el;ing's conception of "?roletarian internationalism"2 that
 what was being demanded of Khrushchev, in fact, was the total
 abandonment of his India policy, of the fruits of eight years
 of Soviet cultivation of the Indian po-aulation and the Indian
 "national bourgeoisie."
 Thus, by the end of October, Moscow could see that it had
 blun-ered.   It had jeopardized its position in the eyes of the
 Indian public to no good purpose; ?eking was not appeased over
 Soviet policy toward India and had not been restrained from
 launching violent attacks on Soviet actions over Cuba.  Accord-
 in;;ly, in a November 5 :?ravda editorial and in subsequent Soviet
 comment, Moscow proceeded to edge away from the partial support
 it had given ?e'-.ing on October 25 and to reassume its earlier
 ;)osi lion.
 TV-3 INDIAN CQ~2i.~':lldI2T ?APTY, meanwhile fought a momentous
 internal battle in the last week of October, as a result of
 whack it disregarded the public advice given it by both Moscow
 and ?eking and adopted a podtion unacceptable even to the C`?STJ.
 a n re's su-iporters in the National Council forced through a
 resolution which condemned ?eking unequivocally and called on
 adians to unite behind Nehru "in defense of the motherland
 against Chinese aggression."  Although ?ravda of October 25
 had asked the C21 not to do this, such a statement may have
 been regarded by Moscow as inevitable.  The CSI resolution
 rent on, however, to say that the par tly was not opposed to
 1ia's'buying arms from any country on a commercial basis,"
 and this Moscow could not stomach.  By endorsing the acceptance
 of military aid f: om the "imperialist" :lest against Communist
 China, the C?I soon found itself at odds with many of Moscow's
 3uro_Dean adherents.  ?or example, the British party, former
 :ientor of the C?I, in October and November took a more and
 more openly anti-iindian position; the Czech _party at first
 went so far as to repeat -)eking's story that India had launched
 an
 an "extensive offensive" on October 2)and as late as Nov-
 S was continuing to attack the validity of the MacHahon
 Line;- and even the revisionist Italian party complained that
 "vre fail to understand easily the position of the Indian Com-
 raunist ?arty. 115
 Meanwhile, however, Moscow's retreat of November back to-
 ward a public posture of neutrality helped to make the ti711's
 domestic position more tolerable, and the .range leadership
 hastened to fortify itself at home and defand itself abroad.
 On the very next day, it was announced that Range had had a
 talk with Nehru in which he outlined to the ?rime Minister the
 iational Council resolution and assured Nehru of the C?I''s
 su-sport.  A few days later, the C?I weekly organ published a
 pugnacious defense of the Indian party leadership against the

 attack made by Jen-min j iii.-pao_ on October 27; the Chinese were
 accused of "national cha=uvinism," anf of having made a blatant
 appeal for Dange's overthrow on the eve of the National Council
 meeting.6  At the same time, the C'?I was reported to have writ-
 ten to all Communist parties of the world defending its posi-
 tion and asking for support.?
 3'.' THIS TI11.3--early November--the central C?I leadership
 was at last firmly in range's hands, and the recalcitrant pro-
 vincial party organizations were soon to succumb as well.  Al-
 though the vacillating C?I General Secretary, H.M.S. Hamboodi--
 ripad, apparently refused to sign the party resolution of iTov-
 eaber 1 (as Jen-min jilt-pao carefully noted), he was isolated
 and powerless; the three leading left-faction spokesmen on the
 Central Secretariat had resigned following the passage of the
 resolution.  T?hile it was the pressure of Indian public opinion
 u::on  the party that pushed the leftists out of the central C,?I
 achinery, 3ange apparently owed it to the Indian government
 that these leftists lost their organizational position in the
 7rovinces.   On 11ovember 7, the day after Dange spoke to Nehru,
 and again on November 21, the government made large-scale ar-
 rests of C`"I cadres; the overwhelming majority of those arrested
 were leaders of the Mt-wing faction in Hew Delhi and in the
 provinces who had opposed or who had shown a lack of enthusiasm
 for the National Council resolution.  Jen-min jih-pao has fur-
 nisbaed its own comment on what happened next :
 "The 3ange clique exploited the situation and sent their
 trusted followers, on the heels of thepolice, to take over the
 leading organs of the ;a.rty committees in a number of states.
 The purpose of these actions by Dange was to reconstitute the
 Indian Communist '?arty and wreck the Indian revolutignary move-
 ment so as to serve the ends of the big bourgeoisie:
 In November and 3ecember the right-wing faction apparently
 d_.c   in fact take advantage of the sudden departure of the  left-
 to seize the party machinery for the first time in the
 left-wing strongholds of ''Vest Bengal and the Punjab, and to
 consolidate its dominant position everywhere else.  This action
 seems to have evoked countermeasures on the kart of the party's
 left-wing which may mark the beginning of an organizational
 s=alt in the C'?I.   In the Punjab, the leftist provincial party
 first secretary, before being arrested, is said to have left
 instructions to his followers not to cooperate with the new
 provincial party leadership, and to have warned "against cer-
 tain weak links in the party" who "would speak the language of
 the government." 9   In `lest 3engal, an "underground" center is
 said to have come into being which similarly instructed party
 units to refuse to cooperate with the "usurping" right-wing
 leaders of the provincial party organization; according to the
 Indian press, many local party units in West Bengal have in
 fact  maintained contact with this "underf:co : d" center and have
 refused allegiance to the official party organization.10  The

 new management o-' the vest Bengal part;; news?a'er Swadhinata
 coiir lained nublicl-y that the outgoing leftist leaders had
 taIsen the organization's funds with them, mortgaged the
 Swadhinata tresses, and left the newspaper in a financial and
 legal aredicament in which it would be difficult to continue
 publication.11
 Pe'dng, of course, has sought to blame the growing organi-
 zational division in the C??I on "Dane and company," who are
 said to have "used the rower of the Indian ruling groups to
 push aside the people who disagree rith them...and to split
 the ?.arty wide open."12  At the same time,  ?eking's increasingly
 o.1er, calls in December, January and :?ebruary for all "true
 Marxist-Leninists" to revolt against the policies and the "bato$'
 of the C?STJ were transparently designed to encourage factional
 stile  in all Co munist 3arties, including the CPI.  As justifi-
 cation for its own position, the CPI leadership therefore ea-
 gerly reprinted all the anti-Chinese statements made by various
 ^ommunist parties as the Sino-Soviet polemic expanded,  includ-
 ing Ulbricht's lament at the East German congress that the
 "Chinese comrades" had not adhered to peaceful coexistence "in
 coaling with frontier questions with India."
 "TOSCOII, however, was by no means hap ny at the v rospect of
 a _~ormal split in the  ?I, and particularly unhanny at the
 means by which it was being brought about.  "Ihile remaining
 careful not to jeo?ardize relations with New Delhi., the Soviet
 press repeatedly protested the jailing of C?I members (parti-
 cularly that of General Secretary N=iboodiripad, who was de-
 tained for a wee?t in late November).  On December 30,  a Pravda
 writer deplored "attemuts to interfere in the internal affairs
 of tie Communist party," citing a statement by an Indian Mini-
 ster who was said to have declared that "the Communist party
 sl2ould clear its ran'.  of questionable elements." Such efforts
 "to divide the Co nraur1sts into the 'pure' and imniLre," "Iravda
 cozi 1ained, are nothing "but an attest jt to kindle internal
 strife within the Communist ?arty, to split it."
 In the light of this situation, Dange in December under-
 took a trio to consult with Communist leaders in the Soviet
 ~Jnion, ;astern Burone, Italy and Britain.   ?eking later claimed
 that Nehru and Indian Rome Affairs Minister Shastri had briefed
 mange before his departure, and that "D.nnae had acted as _n   at-t
 of flew Delhi;'  it seems likely, however, that Range's first
 concern, as always, was to defend the position of S.A.Dange,
 and to justify in his talks with Khrushchev the actions taken
 by the CPI under his leaders;%.f  .   It has been reported in the
 .Indian Press that Dange was not altogether successful in this--
 hat :chrushchev remonstrated against the National Council re-
 solution as being unnecessarily blatant in condemning Chinese
 ession, and that he criticized the C?I for not sufficiently
 qualifying its support of Nehru.14  After ?angels return, he
 a?e?orted first to ITehru, and then to the CPI Central Executive

 Committee.  The latter seemed to be responding to advice brought
 from abroad when on January 12 it adopted a resolution which,
 while continuing to support the bargaining position of the In-
 dian government and to place the onus for agreement upon ?eking,
 put greatly increased emphasis on the need for a peaceful set-
 tlement and on the'`clangerous machinations of the Western powers."1?`
 This shift in the emphasis of the  ?I line was reiterated
 in resolutions adopted by the party's National Council in Februaiy..
 At the same time, the National Council finally put the C,731 on
 public record with aunequivocal denunciation of the
 Chinese party's position in the Sino-Soviet conflict.16  Finally,
 it was at this National Council meeting that Namboodiripad, al-
 ready isolated within the leadership, resigned as C?I General
 Secretary and editor of New Age, leaving Range's forces in sole
 control.
 THAT MOSCC:7 has come to feel, however, that some of the
 ?I's right-faction leaders have carried a compliant attitude
 toward Nehru too far was demonstrated when the March 1933 4s-
 sue of the Soviet-controlled international Communist journal,
 ?roblems of peace and Socialism, published a review article by
 Hamboodiripad (identified-now as merely a "member of the C'?I
 Central Secretariat").   In this article Namboodirigad--and ore-
 sumably the _-"?SJ--reiterated the basic Soviet thesis that the
 Indian bourgeoisie had "not exhausted its '3rogressive role,"
 but also emphasized the need to support the Nehru government
 only when it did well, criticizing it when it misbehaved.
 iHamboodirihad chided "some comrades" for relieving it possible
 sIm 1y to "walk in step with the government."
 For 'Peking, of course, the matter is much more simple; and
 Jan-min jih-pao on March 9 made its -Position plain with an edi-
 tor a  denouncing the C?I leadership in the most violent terms
 to date, condemning :}ange as a Titoita revisionist who was now
 beyond the Communist 'Pale and as a traitor who had split the
 Cl?! by capitulating to Nehru and the Indian bourgeoisie.
 :Despite Moscow's apparent desire to restrain it, the right-
 wing faction now at last seems in firm possession of the machin--
 cry of the Communist ?arty of India throughout the country,
 while the leftist faction---its too leaders imprisoned---report-
 edly is vigorously contesting authority of the new leadership
 in certain areas.   it remains to be seen whether the leftists
 will eventually go on to create and announce a second Communist
 '=arty in India, as has already happened in Brazil.  At the moment
 (late March) both the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Indian conflicts are
 in a phase of relative quiescence; should either be reactivated,
 the development of a formal schism in the C:?I may be ex,,ected
 to accelerate.

 lChairman Dance thus became the second 02I leader to be
 so honored in a Jen-min jih-nao editorial, the first having
 been the late general secretary Ajoy 3hosh, on Dec. 7, 1961.
 2This was s'3elled out still more forcefully by Chou
 3nlai in a speech on November 4, when he thanked the North
 Zoreans for "upholding the stand of proletarian international-
 ism"; this he defined as "distinguishing right from wrong,
 u.3holding justice, denouncing the Indian aggression against
 China, supporting China's counterattacks in self-defense," and
 su,xoorting China's proposals for a border settlement.  (N^NA,
