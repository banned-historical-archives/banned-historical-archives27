Ethiopia and Djibouti are increasing their military 
cooperat-bon as part of Djibouti President Gouled's recent de-
cision to favor relations with Ethiopia at the expense of form-
erly close ties with Somalia. Gouled's successful effort to 
improve relations with Ethiopia has antagonized Somalia?which 
has longstanding claims to Djibouti--and will probably also 
offend neighboring Arab states that have worked to keep Djibouti 
free of Ethiopian and Soviet control. 
25X1   Ethiopian forces last week began intensive operations 
against Afar tribesmen, led by Sultan Ali Mirah, who have waged 
sporadic guerrilla warfare against the Ethiopian regime for 
three years. The Afar operations have been limited but do 
threaten the vital highway linking Addis Ababa to the port of 
Assab, which handles all of Ethiopia's sea-delivered military 
equipment and most of its foreign trade. The Ethiopians may 
have feared that the recent delivery of more Somali arms to the 
Afars presaged an upsurge in Afar guerrilla activity. 
25X1 
The Djibouti Government is apparently cooperating 
closely with the Ethiopian military effort. Some civilians 
have been removed from the Djibouti side of the border, and 
Djibouti security forces have apparently been instructed to 
ignore Ethiopian incursions across the border to seize Afar 
arms caches. 
25X1 I IDiibouti is also cooperating with Ethiopia against 
e Western Somali Liberation Front--the principal Somali-
supported guerrilla group operating in Ethiopia. Gouled has 
promised to use his security forces to guard the Addis Ababa-
Djibouti railroad against guerrilla attacks inside his country. 
He has delivered a strong protest to Mogadisico condemning 
Front attacks against the railroad inside Ethiopia and warning 
the Somalis against moving Front forces across Djibouti. 
25X1 Gouled's primary objective is to maintain Djibouti's 
independence and to ensure the operation of the railroad, the 
mainstay of Djibouti's economy. He has apparently concluded 
that in light of Somalia's defeat in the Ogaden this year 
Ethiopia must be recognized as the dominant power in the Horn 
and that closer ties to Addis Ababa better serve Djibouti's 
interests.

CHINA-VIETNAM: Negotiations 
25X1 I I A note from the Chinese Foreign Ministry to Vietnam 
yes er ay called for negotiations at the vice-ministerial level 
on the issue of ethnic Chinese in Vietnam. The talks, proposed 
for early August, could take place either in Hanoi or in Peking. 
The Chinese suggest that the talks replace at least temporarily 
the fruitless, month-long negotiations between the Chinese Em-
bassy in Hanoi and Lower ranking Vietnamese officials. Hanoi 
will probably agree to the talks but has given no sign of al-
tering the firm Line it has taken up to now with the Chinese. 
25X1 By suggesting talks at a higher level, the Chinese ap-
parently hope to put pressure on Hanoi to respond to Chinese 
conditions for repatriation of the overseas Chinese. They may 
hope that, by broadening the negotiations to embrace the status 
of Chinese in Vietnam, they can temporarily ease the refugee 
burden without losing face. 
25X1 I China may also hope that the new talks will enable 
it o withdraw its two ships now waiting off Vietnam to under-
take the evacuation. Hanoi has refused to accept Peking's char-
acterization of the evacuees as "victimized" and has refused 
to allow the ships into Vietnamese ports. 
25X1 
25X1 
The note contains no concessions from China. It 
ames the current stalemate on Vietnam and repeats use of the 
words "victimized Chinese." A Chinese news service commentary 
published the same day as the note, while not as vituperative 
as other recent Chinese propaganda, similarly contains no con-
cessions to Vietnam and strives to make China appear the ag-
grieved, but reasonable, party

place since then. 
SPAIN: Basque Disorders 
25X1 I Spain's Basque provinces are quiet again after the 
recent 1.sturbances. The Spanish Government is taking steps 
to mollify the Basques and to prevent the situations from up-
setting the legislature's work on the new constitution's pro-
visions for regional autonomy. 
25X1 The government launched an immediate investigation 
of police and governmental errors in dealing with the demon-
strations that led to general disorder throughout the Basque 
country last week. As a result, the civil governor of Navarra 
Province was dismissed, and the commanders of the two police 
units alleged to have killed two persons were fired as was the 
captain of a police unit that went on a looting rampage. 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
Interior Minister Martin Villa visited the region 
soon atter the violence subsided. Demonstrating Madrid's aware-
ness of the deep-seated hostility between the Basques and the 
national police forces, he announced that the government is 
considering formation of a Basque security force to police the 
troubled area. 
The government also approved a royal decree transferr-
ing to the Basque National Council a wide range of powers to 
regulate agriculture, industry, commerce, and town planning, 
but noted defensively that the decree was the result of three 
months of negotiations with Basque representatives. 
Police excesses during the demonstrations will make 
it difficult for the moderate Basque Nationalist Party to agree 
to the limited regional autonomy that the government believes 
is all it can offer; the Basque Nationalists make up the most 
important regional party in the Basque country, but they feel 
increasingly threatened by more radical Basque groups. 
The violence does, however, serve as a reminder 
to the Basques and to the government of what might happen should 
they fail to reach a compromise. The key question is whether the

government can make meaningful concessions to Basque demands for 
autonomy without opening itself to charges from the right and 
the military that it is jeopardizing the unity of the state. 
 t The Basque disorders, coming just as the legislature 
is about o consider autonomy provisions in the constitution, 
reportedly led to an agreement between leaders of the Basque 
Nationalists and the Socialist Party on terms for transferring 
additional authority to the regions. 
This, and the recent violence, might make the govern-
ment more receptive to Basque demands during meetings this 
week. Without support from the Basque Nationalist Party, a con-
sensus on the new constitution would not be possible.

BOLIVIA: Election Invalidated 
25X1 Press reporting indicates that last week's hotly 
e a es presidential election in Bolivia has been invalidated 
at the request of the government's candidate, Juan Pereda. 
25X1 
25X1 
Despite the regime's heavyhanded efforts on behalf of 
ere a, he outcome was still uncertain when the vote count 
was suspended earlier this week. Pereda may thus have seen 
his move to void the election as the best way to extricate the 
government from the almost untenable position created by its 
blatant rigging of the vote. 
There is great potential for further confusion and 
deterioration of the political situation in La Paz. President 
Banzer, for example, told the press yesterday that he would not 
continue in office in the event the electoral court ordered new 
elections. Banzer said that he would turn over the government 
to the armed forces, which would analyze the situation and 
decide what to do next. 
25X1 I I Outraged opposition candidates had denounced the elec-
tion and threatened to join forces in working against Pereda. 
Because the other contenders collectively have such a substantial 
following, it was clear to Pereda and the Army that he would have 
an exceedingly difficult task in governing the country.

ISRAEL: Fighter Aircraft 
Problems 
25X1 
//Israel's 
effort to produce modern fighter air-
craft remains trouble
-prone. High costs and technological 
shortcomings may prohibit further development of a follow-on 
fighter to the Kfir--a program of economic as well as military 
significance. The Kfir, in service since 1975, continues to 
be plagued by technical 
problems.// 
25X1 
//The 
follow-on fighter, called the Arye, is still 
in the design stage, but Israeli officials apparently believe 
that it will not have qualities better than those offered by 
the US-built F-16, which Israel will start receiving in 1981. 
Like the Kfir, the Arye would have to be powered by a foreign 
engine, most likely of US origin. This could restrict the air-
craft's export potential, without which the Arye production run 
would be shorter and costs per aircraft higher.// 
25X1  //The US defense attache believes that the Arye 
project will be ended if the government cannot obtain outside 
funding, either from the US or from a Kfir sale abroad. Can-
celing the project without a replacement would pose serious 
economic problems for the Israeli aircraft industry. Work on 
the Kfir will decrease gradually over the next few years as 
the domestic requirement is filled.//

//At least seven Kfirs have been lost in accidents 
early 1975, and several more have been damaged--many be-
of engine problems. Some engines apparently overheat and, 
the Israelis continue 
to have difficulties with some locally manufactured parts for 
the Kfir's US-designed engine.

CHINA: Pragmatic Policies 
25X1 I isigns of opposition to some of the pragmatic policies 
adoptedin China after the ouster of the four radical Politburo 
members in 1976 have surfaced in recent weeks. The implementa-
tion of the new policies has not been affected, nor do the "op-
ponents" seem strong or unified enough to mount a serious chal-
lenge anytime soon. Nevertheless, it is clear that some people 
in China?possibly including senior party officials?view the 
new pragmatism with considerable skepticism. 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
At issue are the priority given economic develop-
ment, the reintroduction of strict academic standards in 
schools, the reinstatement of scientists and other intellectuals 
purged as politically unreliable in the mid-1960s, and the 
greatly liberalized approach to foreign trade. Some footdrag-
ging no doubt is based on fear that these policies will be over-
turned in another political upheaval and that those who carried 
them out will be attacked, as they were during the Cultural Rev-
olution. 
 //In other cases, however, it is clear that some 
people regarl the new policies as wrong. In response to apparent 
sub rosa accusations, the party newspaper People's Daily as-
serted defensively that the current emphasis on economic mod-
ernization will not lead to "revisionism" and defended increased 
foreign trade as "patriotic" rather than "traitorous." The media 
have candidly admitted, moreover, that the renewed stiff criteria 
for enrollment in universities were hotly debated last spring. 
Students who failed last year's university entrance examination 
are reported to have put up a poster attacking Vice Premier 
Teng Hsiao-ping, who is regarded as the architect of most of 
these pragmatic policies.// 
In addition to those who are afraid to carry 
out, or who oppose, the new policies, there is doubtless a 
body of opinion that views the new policies as necessary but 
believes China is moving too fast and too far. //Some Chinese 
teachers reportedly regard the new education policies as "jus-
tified" but admit they are "elitist" in nature--precisely the 
criticism leveled at them during the Cultural Revolution.// 
People's Daily has acknowledged that some people fear that the 
reinstatement of intellectuals regardless of their political 
background "might be carrying things too far."

Judging from his speech to a science conference last 
winter, party Chairman Hua Kuo-Eeng could be one of those advo-
cating a more cautious approach, but it is not clear to what 
extent, if any, top party officials may disagree fundamentally 
over policy questions. Given the speed with which the new 
policies have been implemented, it seems unlikely they have en-
countered serious high-level opposition. Still, it is possible 
that those who have raised behind-the-scenes objections to 
these policies believe they have the support of at least some 
senior officials. 
The policies of the now-discredited leftists, who 
put more stock in political enthusiasm than in ability, remain 
attractive to many in China who lack particular skills but 
hoped to find upward mobility through political activism. Such 
people may eventually regain some political strength if they 
can find a spokesman in the upper echelons of the party and if 
the current pragmatic programs do not yield significant tangi-
ble results before the death of Teng Hsiao-ping.

IRAQ: National Day Celebrations 
The current tensions in Iraq's relations with the 
SSR were reflected in speeches and interviews by Iraqi leaders 
marking the 10th anniversary this week of the Baathist regime. 
President Bakr and strongman Saddam Husayn stressed their pur-
suit of an independent and nonaligned foreign policy and called 
for noninterference in Iraq's internal affairs. The Iraqi 
leaders gave no hint of interest in improving relations with 
the US. 
Relations between Iraq and the USSR deteriorated this 
spring as a result of differences over the Horn of Africa where 
Iraq supports the Eritrean insurgents fighting the Soviet-backed 
Ethiopian regime. The Iraqis are also concerned about the So-
viet role in the recent coups in Afghanistan and South Yemen. 
The Soviets are upset by Iraq's execution of at least 21 Iraqi 
Communists in the armed forces for allegedly conspiring to 
overthrow the government. 
In a Newsweek interview published this week, Saddam 
Husayn declared that the Soviets "won't be satisfied until the

times in the past three months. The two leaders have made it 
clear, however, that Iraq has no intention of disrupting rela-
tions with the USSR, their chief military supplier. 
A Soviet Foreign Ministry official acknowledged pri-
vately last Friday that relations with Iraq are "delicate," and 
Soviet press commentary on Iraq's national day reiterated So-
viet concern about Baathist treatment of the Iraqi Communist 
Party. 
Pravda's reference on Friday to the "difficulties" 
in Iraq's Baath-Communist national front suggests that Moscow 
expects continued Iraqi efforts to limit the political role of 
the Communist Party in Baghdad. Soviet broadcasts last week 
cautioned Baghdad against "complicating" relations between the 
Baathists and the Communists and suggested that further Baathist 
repression could prompt the Communists to withdraw from the 
front. 
The Iraqi statements suggest Iraq has no interest now 
in Improving relations with the US. Saddam Husayn acknowledged 
in his Newsweek interview that Iraq has noted with interest 
President Carter's Middle Eastern policy statements but that 
Iraq "is still waiting for deeds and that can only mean Israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied territories." 
Other remarks by Bakr and Saddam Husayn reaffirmed 
the thrust of Iraq's Middle Eastern policy. They reiterated 
their basic opposition to negotiations with Israel--and accused 
Egypt and Syria of following "capitulationist policies." They 
also denounced those states trying to keep Iraq isolated, pre-
sumably a reference to Syrian attempts to block recent Iraqi 
moves to improve relations with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. 
The Iraqi leaders also charged Syria with encouraging sectarian 
warfare in Lebanon. 25X1

BRIEFS 
One--and possibly two--US citizens convicted of vio-
lating Saudi Arabia's strict ban on alcohol may be flogged on 
Saturday. The recent flogging of two British citizens resulted 
in a loud outcry in the London press.

China 
China is taking another step toward resuming its 
participation in international research programs after a 20-
year hiatus. The World Meteorological Organization has announced 
that China will contribute to  its year-long Global Atmospheric  
Research Program during 1979.
