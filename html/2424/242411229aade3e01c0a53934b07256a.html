 The dispute involving Milovan Djilas appears to

 international orientation and foreign policy.  Any sub-

 weaken the stability of the Tito regime or to involve
 other top-level personalities.

 Hints of Soviet strategy at the Berlin conference h;ivp.
 emerged
 The Russians argued strongly
 That    e pro  em o   European security is one which can be
 solved by European states through bilateral nonaggression
 treaties.
 They also suggested that the Kremlin might accept free
 elections in Germany at the price of neutralization and the
 establishment of a government like that in Austria.   Recent
 Soviet propaganda, however, indicates continued inflexible
 opposition to the Western concept of free elections under
 foreign supervision.
 Foreign Minister Molotov stressed the need for European
 security in an interview on 12 January with French ambassador
 Joxe in Moscow.   He emphasized that the German problem was
 the key to European security but shed no new light on Soviet
 security proposals.
 Similarly, a note to Austria on 16 January failed to
 clarify Soviet plans for an Austrian settlement at Berlin.
 While the vaguely worded note supported the principle of a
 treaty settlement with Austrian participation, it gave no
 specific commitment to take up or settle the issue now.
 On Far Eastern issues the Communist world is intensifying
 its campaign to overcome the psychological and political
 defeat represented by the release of the unrepatriated
 prisoners in Korea.   The Communists apparently hope to inject
 enough confusion and doubt into the repatriation question to
 deprive the West of the full impact of its victory on the
 nonforcible repatriation principle and to generate strong
 pressure for renewed UN debate on the Korean issue.
 The attack is being conducted on three main fronts.
 The major attention is now being devoted to'an attempt to
 prove that the UN decision to release the prisoners on 23
 January, allegedly to avoid completion of the explanations,
 violates the armistice agreement.
 Secondary attention is given to demonstrating a genuine
 interest in resuming the preliminary talks at Panmunjom for
 arranging the political conference.   The Communists contrast
 their alleged willingness to resume talks without conditions
 with the "arbitrary conditions" raised by the US to block
 resumption.

 These first two lines of attack are used to support
 demands for the early resumption of UN debate on Korea.
 On 14 January, Vyshinsky formally approved reconvening th:,
 8th General Assembly to consider the Korean question, but
 he argued that "bearing in mind the situation in. Panmunjom,"
 the assembly should meet on 22 January rather than on 9
 February as suggested by Madame Pandit.   Moscow radio warned
 on 15 January that the UN must "take into its hands the
 peaceful settlement of the Korean question."
 Finally, this Communist campaign is also linked with
 Soviet objectives at the forthcoming Berlin conference.
 Molotov will probably attempt to use the widespread concern
 over the failure to reach a Korean settlement as support
 for his demands for a five-power conference to discuss re-
 duction of international tensions.   Moscow radio has warned
 that it will be impossible to solve the Korean problem without
 Communist Chinese and North Korean participation, and Chou
 En-lai has endorsed Moscow's proposal for a five-power con-
 ference.

 WESTERN HANDICAPS IN THE BERLIN TALKS
 The three Allied powers approach the Berlin conference
 handicapped by the strength of the widespread desire for a
 relaxation of East-West tensions and also by specific polit-
 ical considerations in several Western European countries.
 Britain seems fully determined to pay no excessive price for
 such a detente, but in France, West Germany, and Austria
 special national objectives make the governments vulnerable
 in varying degrees to possible Soviet overtures and pose po-
 tentially serious difficulties for the three Allied foreign
 ministers.
 For France the most sensitive issue is the Indochina war.
 Communist diplomatic hints and propaganda approaches to France
 have for some months capitalized on the growing desire to shed
 this burden; and Vice Premier Reynaud reiterated in the last
 fortnight that France must seek a suitable five-power confer-
 ence with this end in view.   Other members of the cabinet have
 called for ending the war on any terms short of outright with-
 drawal, and no French government can at present refuse to give
 serious attention to any Soviet proposals on Indochina.
 On European security questions, France's present indeci-
 sion springs mainly from unwillingness to make room for a
 resurgent Germany in the European and Atlantic communities.
 Most Frenchmen have lost their fear of Soviet aggression in
 the near future, but do fear that a unified and rearmed Ger-
 many would relegate France to a secondary role and eventually
 lead the West into war to regain Germany's lost eastern Prov-
 inces.  Consequently, they are likely to look with sympathy
 on any Soviet proposals for a disarmed or neutralized Germany.
 French representatives might well be susceptible to a
 Soviet "package deal" accepting a major Western demand such
 as free all-German elections, but coupling such acceptance
 with limitations on Germany's future armaments and alliarces.
 In particular,  the French would be attracted by a Continent-
 wide security guarantee implying restrictions on Germany's
 freedom of action.
 In West Germany, where progress toward unification re-
 mains the primary demand on the Berlin negotiators,  theiE, is
 still agreement among all political parties that free elec-
 tions are a prerequisite for unification.   The belief is grow-
 ing both in parliament and the press, however, that the USSR

 F
 Approved Fo$ elease 2004/0  C   A-RDP79-0092  1100200090001-2
 has legitimate grounds for assuring its own military security
 before relinquishing East Germany and withdrawing its occiipa-
 tion forces.   It is likely, therefore, that many West Germans
 would consider it entirely reasonable for Moscow to insist on
 some kind of agreement on the status of a united Germany be-
 fore agreeing to free elections, and many also would still ac-
 cept neutrality as the price of free elections.
 Sharp resentment would probably be aroused in West Ger-
 many if the Allies tried to terminate the conference at an
 early date because of Soviet refusal to agree on specific ar-
 rangements for free elections after Moscow had previously ac-
 cepted the principle.   Chancellor Adenauer's government,
 however, can be counted on to oppose any Soviet efforts to
 protract the conference, provided that initial Soviet conces-
 sions cause no great surge of unification sentiment.
 'West German opinion also is vulnerable to any possible
 conciliatory Soviet gestures early in the conference on sec-
 ondary issues such as the status of Berlin or East-West trade.
 Interest is increasing in the Federal Republic in expanding
 trade relations with the Orbit as a hedge against threatened
 economic recession;  and any Communist gestures on this or sim-
 ilar matters would be taken by many West Germans as evidence
 that concessions on more important issues were possible.
 Austria's growing insistence on obtaining a state treaty
 at almost any cost constitutes still another potential handi-
 cap for the Allied negotiators.   The Austrian government in-
 dicated to the American ambassador on 14 January that, if
 permitted to state its case at Berlin, it would adhere to the
 agreed Western position.   It would be prepared, however, to
 abjure all military alliances and even assume the burden of
 reparations specified in the present version of the treaty's
 Article 35.
 Allied failure to let Vienna accept Soviet terms it con-
 sidered bearable would have serious repercussions in Austria.
 Austrian acceptance of such terms, on the other hand, might
 cause West German opinion to blame its own failure to achieve
 a treaty on "obstructionism" by Adenauer and the occupying
 powers.

 The fall from power of Milovan Djilas, one of the four
 top Yugoslav party leaders, represents the first serious
 rupture within the top echelon of the Yugoslav party since
 1948.   The dispute appears to have been purely internal, and
 there is no evidence that Yugoslavia's international orienta-
 tion and foreign policy are involved.  Although a purge of
 some Djilas supporters can be expected to follow, it is
 unlikely to weaken the stability of the Tito regime or to in-
 volve other top-level personalities.
 The solidarity which has hitherto characterized the
 tightly knit Tito clique, the suddenness with which the pres-
 ent  crisis developed, and the special attention given
 Djilas' attack on the corruptive influences of bureaucratic
 authority suggest that personal differences as well as d--s-
 agreements on the form and timing of party policy were r4=---
 sponsible for sparking the Djilas dispute.   The personal
 factor remains an "unknown," however, and no further light
 was thrown on the subject during the central committee d_s-
 cussions on 16 and 17 January.
 According to charges by the Yugoslav central commit--ee,
 the views expressed by Djilas in a recent series of articles
 were "basically contrary to the spirit" of the decisions
 reached by the Sixth Party Congress in November 1952.   These
 decisions stipulated that the party's position of leadership,
 .its Communist identity, and the organizational principle of
 "democratic centralism" were to remain unimpaired, but that
 Communists were no longer to be considered "an exclusive part
 of the working class" or to claim for themselves a monopoly
 in the creation of socialism.
 The obscurity and lack of definition of this new line
 immediately gave rise to considerable confusion within the
 party, and contributed to a highly flexible interpretation
 of party policies on. the part of Yugoslav leaders. While it
 is true that Djilas has been more specific than other Yugo-
 slav leaders in his criticism of "bureaucracy," corruption,
 and "outmoded forms," he has heretofore been a faithful ex-
 ponent of the party line, and it was not until late in
 December that any ideological deviation became apparent
 his articles.

 Approved Foh$elease 2004/0IW-RDP79-009274p00200090001-2
 It became clear during the discussions of the central
 committee on 16 and 17 January, however, that Djilas had
 violated party discipline by publicly airing his persona._
 interpretation of the party platform, and that he had in-
 curred the wrath of other party leaders by interpreting that
 platform too broadly.   Particularly objectionable were
 Djilas' advocacy of a smaller party organization, his sug-
 gestion that the party's basic organizations be abandoned,
 his proposal that some state organs be "emancipated from
 every influence of the party," and his attack on "the qu:__te
 real monstrosity" and "fancied superior morals" of the
 "closed circle" of party bureaucracy.
 Although he clearly noted that "the struggle for de-
 mocracy must still be headed by the experienced Communis
 cadres," Djilas' articles were understandably interpreted in
 Belgrade as a threat to the authority and prestige of the
 party leadership.   The resulting attack on him may involve
 a return to a purer communist doctrine and lead to further
 attacks on "bourgeois liberalist forms" and the "formalistic,
 Western type of democracy," but there is no indication.thiat
 it will result in a weakening of Yugoslavia's political,
 economic and military ties with the West.   Tito has emphasized
 that the matter is a purely internal one, and that "it cannot
 influence the course of our foreign policy."
 There are indications, however, that Djilas' censure re-
 flects a certain "tightening-up" in Yugoslav domestic po:_icies
 and party discipline.   In any case, a review and clarifica-
 tion of the Sixth Congress line is long overdue, and the
 Djilas case is already being used as the basis for a strong
 reassertion of the mission and solidarity of the party.
 Although it has been announced that a new plenary ses-
 sion of the central committee will meet in six weeks to
 reassess the decisions of the Sixth Congress, there has as
 yet been no indication that Yugoslav policies will be basi-
 cally changed.   On 17 January Tito warned that the Communist
 Party should not make "new mistakes" by "going to the other
 extreme" as a result of the Djilas affair, but should continue
 to follow in its present path with greater vigilance and care
 "to avoid saying later that we have again been blind."

 FACTIONALISM EXPECTED TO WEAKEN NEW IRANIAN PARLIAMENT
 The elections now under way in Iran will probably give Prime
 Minister Zahedi temporary control of the new Majlis, which, how-
 ever, is expected to split quickly into the usual cliques based
 on special and personal interests.   These groups may often oppose
 Zahedi's policies and their votes on his program will be unpre-
 dictable.   Any reappearance of pro-British deputies will also
 increase parliamentary disputes.
 Contrary to an earlier official announcement that the elec-
 tions would be completed within 24 hours, it now appears that
 the balloting will be spread over several weeks.   This increases
 the government's chances for success in manipulating the voting.
 Zahedi and the shah are making strong efforts to influence the
 elections despite Zahedi's illness, which has kept him inactive
 for the past week.   Although they reportedly disagree over cer-
 tain candidates, they are supporting a joint list.
 Zahedi recently said that he expected 40 of the 136 candi-
 dates backed by the government to support him fully, while 40
 more would be friendly to the government but could not be depended
 on in times of stress.   The prime minister believes the remainder
 would in general support the government, except for perhaps a half
 dozen troublesome demagogues.
 The caliber of the candidates offers little hope that the
 new Majlis will be an improvement over earlier ones.   Many of
 those backed by the government were chosen more for their friend-
 ship for the shah or Zahedi than for ability and honesty.   Sev-
 eral are obviously being rewarded for past political suppcrt of
 the regime, although' their reputations are poor.   Men such as
 Zahedi's former deputy prime ministers Amidi-Nuri and DowJatabadi
 are considered thoroughly corrupt opportunists.
 There will probably be the traditionally large majority of
 deputies representing the entrenched landowning and tribal inter-
 ests, with a scattering of representatives from the professions,
 lawyers, journalists, clerics, and the military.   Some opposition
 deputies may be elected, although there seems to be little coor-
 dination between the various opposition groups.   Mozaffar Baghai,
 chief non-Communist opponent of Zahedi, apparently is trying to
 win election from Kerman, a district which twice before sent him
 to Tehran.   The shah and Zahedi in turn reportedly have decided
 to delay the Kerman elections in an attempt to block Baghai.

 The first test of Zahedi's control will come immediately
 after the Majlis is formed, when it is customary to give the
 prime minister a vote of confidence after hearing his program.
 He probably will win this initial vote but is likely to run into
 difficulties soon afterward.   Iran needs, and nearly every govern-
 ment including the present one has promised, financial, social
 and economic reforms.   The attempted reforms always meet opposi-
 tion from those groups in the Majlis whose special interests
 might be prejudiced by the action.
 The government will therefore probably have very unpredict-
 able backing.   Zahedi might receive a vote of no-confidence on
 any one of a dozen issues ranging from his handling of the oil
 negotiations with Britain to much-needed tax reforms.  His sup-
 port will almost certainly fade away if he is unsuccessful in
 his internal economic program and in his negotiations with Britain.

 Burma's decision not to renew the defense treaty with
 Britain which expired on 4 January leaves its armed forces
 with no regular source of supply.   The Burmese reached this
 decision largely because they felt that the agreement was
 incompatible with national sovereignty, and that Britain
 had exploited its position and interfered in domestic affairs.
 As a result, Burma's capability to meet the threat of Commu-
 nists and other insurgents in all likelihood will deteriorate.
 British arms will continue to be sold to Burma, but there
 are indications that unless a new relationship can be work=ed out,
 London will accord future Burmese requests a lower priority than
 heretofore.  While negotiations for a new agreement are continuing,
 the American army attache in Rangoon reports that an early settle-
 ment is unlikely and that the British mission is planning to phase
 out its activities as rapidly as possible.
 Burma's need for military equipment, meanwhile, is becoming
 acute.   Little of the materiel which the British turned over to
 the armed forces in 1948, when the country became independent, is
 still usable, and subsequent deliveries have satisfied only imme-
 diate operational requirements.  Thus even a slowdown in the trans-
 mission of arms will handicap military efforts to suppress the Com-
 munists and other insurgent groups, and to put pressure on the
 Chinese Nationalist forces in northeast Burma.
 To avoid dependence on Britain, the Burmese have long sought
 to buy arms in continental Europe, Asia, and the United States, and
 odd lots of small arms are known to have been purchased from France
 and Italy.   Such purchases, however, besides failing to sa-isfy
 Burma's needs, cause serious maintenance problems due to lack of
 standardization and an irregular flow of spare parts.
 According to the American embassy in Rangoon, Burmese offi-
 cials are irritated by their failure, to date, to obtain arms
 from the United States.  The Burmese commander in chief in Decem-
 ber told the American army attache, with whom he has been -friendly,
 that he did not trust Washington and indicated that he was resigned
 to getting along without American arms.   The embassy fears that the
 Burmese may turn to the Soviet bloc for assistance if they continue
 to be frustrated in their procurement efforts, and has recommended
 that they be given $10,000,000 worth of selected military items or
 that such equipment be made available at extremely liberal prices.

 There is no evidence that the Burmese are now seeking arms
 in the Communist world.  However, should the current trade nego-
 tiations with the Communists concerning the disposal of large
 surplus rice stocks prove satisfactory, it is quite possible the
 Burmese will seek to solve their arms problem in a similar manner.
 Although the Orbit is capable of exporting a wide raz-ge of
 military equipment, to do so would constitute a sharp departure
 from past policy.

 PROSPECTS FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT
 Since his inauguration on 30 December, President Ramon
 Magsaysay has moved rapidly toward reorganizing the Philippine
 government along more efficient lines and his announced policies
 have met with enthusiastic popular response.              The chief obstacle
 to his success appears to lie in the possible undermining of his
 program by conservative elements within his own Nacionalista
 Party.
 In his inaugural address, Magsaysay called for a re-
 examination of the feudal land tenure system,                                     for a wider dis-
 tribution of the benefits of economic development, and for
 administrative and judicial reforms.   Since then he has insti-
 tuted a major reorganization of several government economic
 agencies and corporations.  He has also ordered the armed forces
 to help in conducting a census of land ownership and in a large
 road construction project which is probably beyond Philippine
 financial and technical capabilities.
 These moves are in keeping with Magsaysay's election cam-
 paign, which for the first time gave the Philippine masses a
 feeling of personal contact with the government.  After the
 inauguration they overwhelmed the president's office in response
 to an invitation to send in by collect telegram any complaints
 they had about the government.  There is little doubt that they
 confidently expect a thorough overhauling of the Philippine
 social and economic structure.
 The entrenched Nacionalista politicians, however, who
 represent the conservative, land-owning elite which has dot_iu-
 nated every preceding administration, will resist any real
 challenge to the existing power structure.  They control the
 congress. and have maneuvered to influence key administrative
 appointments.
 Magsaysay's new cabinet members were nearly all selec-ed
 from a list of recommendations submitted by the party.  He
 withdrew his original choice for labor secretary, and appointed
 to a key post in the Department of Foreign Affairs a protege of
 Nacionalista stalwart Senator Claro Recto, who has often been
 critical of American policy.   A woman appointed as social wel-
 fare administrator appears to have as her chief.qualificat-ion
 that she is the daughter of a wealthy campaign contributor.

 The new secretary of commerce is a representative of the sugar
 interests.  The latter financed Carlos Romulo's Democratic
 Party, which supported Magsaysay.   Other appointees, however,
 appear to be well qualified and to have views similar to
 Magsaysay's.
 The progressive groups which helped to organize Magsaysay's
 landslide victory have heretofore never been close to the inner
 circles of government.   They include progressive Catholic groups
 and civic-minded business and professional organizations.   Their
 members,  some of whom are Magsaysay's closest advisers,  are
 mostly young men of a different generation from that which domi-
 nated Philippine political life from Quezon to Quirino.                      In his
 short time in office, Magsaysay has apparently attempted to get
 along'with his party and at the same time not to dim the hopes
 of these groups to which he must look for support of his program.
 So far he has been successful.
 The Philippine Congress meets in regular session on 25
 January.   Philippine presidents have broad and powerful pre-
 rogatives which when skillfully used have enabled them to
 exercise virtually complete control over the legislative arm.
 Magsaysay, however, has none of the political experience oL' the
 Nacionalista leaders in Congress.  He must move cautiously to
 avoid open conflict with them,  but if he moves too cautiously
 he risks the considerable popular disillusionment which would
 follow a failure to live up to the high hopes he has raised.

 POST-STALIN SHAKE-UP IN SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTRY
 The extensive reorganization and personnel shake-up
 within the Soviet Foreign Ministry over the past ten months
 apparently is aimed at revitalizing Soviet diplomacy rather
 than purging political undesirables  (see chart, p.18).                  The
 present regime is clearly interested in developing the Foreign
 Ministry as a more effective instrument of foreign policy than
 it appeared to be in Stalin's last years.
 Almost 70 percent of the top Foreign Ministry positions
 have figured in personnel changes since Stalin died and V. M.
 Molotov resumed direct administrative control of the foreign
 affairs apparatus.   This is the most extensive shake-up in
 the ministry since 1939, when Molotov became foreign minister
 the first time.   In contrast to 1939, however, the present
 changes consist largely of personnel shifts within the min-
 istry.,
 The relatively few individuals who have been brought
 in from other fields and assigned to leading positions art.
 mostly high party men.   These,added to the number of Foreign
 Ministry careerists already on top party bodies, place an un-
 precedented number of foreign service personnel high in the
 ranks of the party.   Since the party has always maintained
 close control over the Foreign Ministry, the increased number
 of ministry personnel also on top party bodies lends suppc'rt
 to the thesis that the party is now more actively interested
 in exploiting the traditional instrument of diplomacy as a.
 means of effecting its foreign policy objectives.
 The fact that most of the former party careerists in
 the foreign service are being utilized in Satellite affairs
 may indicate an attempt at closer control over the Orbit;
 but a more probable reason is that their experience will he
 most useful where similar ideological and organizational
 problems may be encountered and where ordinary diplomacy
 is less a problem.
 In addition to the personnel shifts, the Foreign Min-
 istry's central apparatus has been streamlined.   Evidence
 indicates that the number of territorial divisions has been
 reduced from twelve to nine.   A new American Division has been
 formed through the merger of the former Latin American and
 USA divisions.  The Fifth European Division has been abolished
 and its territorial responsibility transferred to the Third
 European.   There is a strong possibility, also, that the Balkan
 Countries Division has been abolished and its responsibilities
 assumed by the Fourth European.

 Soviet diplomatic relations with several foreign states
 have been regularized within the past ten months through the
 accrediting of ambassadors to Canada, Greece and Yugoslavia,
 where the Soviet embassies had been headed by charges foi
 several years.   In addition, embassies were established and
 ambassadors accredited in Austria and the German Democratic
 Republic, and diplomatic relations with Israel were resumed.
 The latest move of this nature was the announcement on 22
 December of the intention to establish an embassy in Indcnesia,
 which the.USSR recognized in 1950.
 Taken all together, the large number of personnel shifts,
 the influx of top party people, the streamlining of the cen-
 tral apparatus, and the regularization of relations with
 foreign states add up to an attempt to increase the ministry's
 effectiveness in the conduct of Soviet foreign relations.

 SPECIAL ARTICLE
 A SOVIET SURVEY:   I. FOREIGN POLICY*
 Jan 54
 The outstanding characteristic of Soviet foreign policy
 from the summer of 1953 to the eve of the Berlin meeting has
 been a clear effort to temporize on every major East-West dif-
 ference, steadfastly refusing to settle any of these differ-
 ences at the cost of major concessions.  The Soviet leaders
 thus have avoided unnecessary commitments which might reduce
 their future freedom of action.
 This stand probably derives from two basic considerations.
 The first is Moscow's determination to maintain intact the
 present frontiers of the Orbit which compels it to reject all
 Western proposals for settlements requiring a possible with-
 drawal from such advanced positions as East Germany, Austria,
 and North Korea.   The Soviet leaders are aware that this un-
 yielding stand places them at a propaganda disadvantage in nego-
 tiating with the West,   In order to offset this disadvantage,
 the Soviet representative at the forthcoming Berlin conference
 may attempt to avoid openly opposing those Western proposals
 which will command wide popular support, such as free elections
 in Germany, by means of injecting demands for a five-power con-
 ference and consideration of such issues as American foreign
 bases, international tensions, atomic weapons prohibition, and
 European security.
 The second basic consideration is Moscow's probable belief
 that the present world stalemate can be maintained without
 serious disadvantage to Orbit interests and with growing pros-
 pects for an eventual split in the non-Communist world.
 There have been no decisive changes in the Orbit
 which would impel Moscow to consider negotiating either a
 general settlement with the West or definitive agreements on
 specific questions.  The concession on the POW issue which
 opened the way to the Korean armistice has been the only notable
 one which Orbit leaders have made.
 * This is the first of two articles.   The second will deal
 with internal problems.

 The policy of postponement may be partly motivated in cer-
 tain areas by a desire to gain time for correcting the adverse
 effects of past policies, such as the pressing need to repair
 the damage to Soviet prestige inflicted by the June riots in
 East Germany.  The new leadership may also have regarded the
 series of moves initiated after Stalin's death as the necessary
 forerunners of the internal economic and political readjust-
 ments they wished to introduce.
 However, the over-all pattern of Soviet moves and propa-
 ganda in the international sphere suggests that this policy of
 postponement has been devised in the light of the Kremlin's
 present strategic estimate of its position vis-a-vis the
 non-Communist world.   It appears, moreover, at least since the
 concessions on Korea and with the exception of certain temporary
 tactical retreats, that Soviet foreign policy is free from any
 basically defensive motivation springing either from internal
 weakness or from fear of Western intentions and military pressure.
 The USSR is taking advantage of the period of stalemate to
 strengthen its position in areas which the Soviet leaders may
 believe are now vulnerable to Western pressure.   In particular,
 Moscow moved quickly and vigorously both to restore the authority
 and prestige of the East German regime following the June riots,
 and to speed the reconstruction of North Korea's industry and
 communications and the reorganization of its armed forces.
 The new regime has shown an awareness of the delicate prob-
 lems presented by Mao Tse-tung's unique stature in the Communist
 world and Peiping's special and recently enhanced position in
 the Soviet Orbit.   It has also taken steps to deal with these
 problems and maintain the solidarity of the Sino-Soviet alliance.
 In recent months Moscow has played up Communist China as a "new
 great power," has accorded China greater stature as an Asian
 model and leader, has given Mao unusual praise, has promised
 long-range assistance to Peiping's construction efforts, and has
 most rebently acquiesced to increased Chinese influence in North
 Korea.
 The present policy appears to rest basically on Moscow's
 belief that with the end of the Korean war, increasing pressure
 will be brought against the United States by its allies for a
 relaxation of trade controls, great power negotiations, and
 delays in rearmament and in European integration.  The USSR ap-
 parently hopes that such pressures and frictions                       will progress-
 ively reduce the West's capability for united action.

 This strategy was clearly defined by Malenkov on 8 August
 1953 when he said, "If today, in conditions of tension in inter-
 national relations, the North Atlantic bloc is rent by internal
 strife and contradictions, the lessening of this tension may
 lead to its disintegration."
 There was nothing in this speech which would indicate any
 impending changes in the present pattern of Soviet foreign
 policy.  Malenkov served notice that the present Soviet power
 position and the frontiers of the Orbit will be defended.   He
 devoted special attention to countering any tendency in the
 West to interpret the "peace-through-negotiations" line as a
 manifestation of weakness.  This was apparent in his hydrogen
 bomb claim and his references to the Beria purge and the current
 unrest in the Satellites.
 The "campaign for negotiations" was the predominant feature
 of Soviet official statements and propaganda for the first six
 months of the new regime.   It differed from previous propa-
 ganda offensives, such as the 1950 Stockholm appeal for a ban
 on atomic weapons and the 1951-52 appeal for a five-power peace
 pact, in that it was supported by concrete diplomatic moves.
 Malenkov's statement on 15 March 1953, repeated in his 8 August
 speech, that "there is not a single controversial or unsettled
 question which could not be solved by peaceful means on the
 basis of mutual agreement of the interested countries" was the
 pivotal slogan of the campaign.
 Moscow made most of its conciliatory gestures and conces-
 sions during the first four months after Stalin's death.  More
 recently, the USSR has been calling on foreign governments to
 meet it halfway, and Soviet propaganda is making much les3 use
 of the theme of negotiated settlement of international issues.
 In the course of the last six months, constant Western
 diplomatic pressure aimed at forcing Moscow to abandon its
 vague and generalized statements and to agree to serious nego-
 tiations on concrete issues greatly reduced the Kremlin's free-
 dom of maneuver.  This situation was registered in the note of
 3 November 1953 which made clear the Soviet leaders' strong
 desire to avoid meeting with the three Western powers and their
 unwillingness to settle any major East-West issue at the cost
 of concessions involving the present frontiers of the Orbt.
 This negative and inflexible stand produced a prompt and
 unfavorable Western reaction.   Molotov's unusual press confer-
 ence on 1.3 November apparently was an attempt to counteract such
 unfavorable comment, but he reiterated the note's unacceptable

 conditions.   This was followed by the 26 November note which
 proposed a four-power foreign ministers' conference in Berlin
 and the 26 December note suggesting the 25 January 1954 date.
 This tactical change probably represented an effort to repair
 the damage to Moscow's propaganda position without, however,
 modifying any basic substantive positions.
 The four Soviet notes which preceded that of 26 November
 clearly indicated that the USSR does not desire serious negotia-
 tions for a German settlement, except on its own terms, and
 then only in conjunction with five-power talks on "urgent inter-
 national problems having great significance for the lessening
 of international tension."
 The USSR refused to attend a meeting of foreign ministers'
 deputies on the Austrian state treaty and appeared reluctant
 to include this question on the agenda of a foreign ministers'
 conference.   Soviet statements have suggested that the conclu-
 sion of an Austrian treaty is linked with the settlement of the
 German question,
 With respect to a Korean settlement, so long as the Orbit
 leaders see no real danger of a resumption of hostilities;, they
 probably calculate that little will be lost by maintaining
 the present deadlock and the division of Korea.
 Indochina provides another example of the attempt to under-
 mine non-Communist resistance to Communist pressure by ex-
 ploiting hope of settling disputes through negotiation.  Ho Chi
 Minh's 29 November statement that he is "prepared to discuss"
 a proposal from France for a settlement was probably aimed at
 generating doubt and suspicion in the minds of non-Communist
 Vietnamese, and at exploiting war-weariness in France.   1o's
 move probably was intended to complement Soviet efforts to
 induce France to pursue an "independent" foreign policy.
 There is no convincing evidence that the Viet Minh urgently
 desires the prompt conclusion of a negotiated settlement    it
 is likely that Orbit policy will continue in the immediate
 future to be based on the belief that war of attrition in Indo-
 china offers greater advantages than either peace or an expanded
 Communist war effort.
 Moscow's policy of stalling for time and avoiding commitments
 has also emerged in its reaction to high-level suggestions from
 the West that the Soviet fear of attack might be relieved by
 some type of nonaggression pact.   The USSR has strongly implied
 that no European security negotiations could take place unless
 Soviet terms on Germany are met,

 r
 There have been several indications that the Soviet Union
 will develop the security theme at the Berlin conference, but
 the propaganda emphasis is likely to be placed on the dangers
 emanating from American foreign bases and "aggressive" alliances.
 Any proposals offered as an alternative to Western security ar-
 rangements are not likely to go beyond 'a Soviet-sponsored system
 of bilateral or multilateral security pacts which would be
 intended to supersede the EDC.
 In another field, Moscow's affirmative response to Presi-
 dent Eisenhower's widely acclaimed invitation to "governments
 principally concerned" to discuss his proposal for an inter-
 national atomic energy pool reflected an awareness that out-
 right refusal or delay would seriously damage its propaganda
 position.   Soviet propaganda has since attempted to utilize the
 President's proposal to intensify the campaign for "an unccondi-
 tional pledge by governments not to use atomic weapons."
 The present Soviet foreign policy may be no more than a
 device for stalling in the belief that the bloc's over-all posi-
 tion will grow stronger and its freedom of maneuver greater with
 the passage of time.  As such, it would be part of the campaign
 to isolate the United States by persuading the rest of the
 world that only American intransigence and aggressive ambitions
 thwart the establishment of secure peace.  Moscow may hope that
 this campaign will open the way to bilateral negotiations aimed
 at detaching certain countries from the American-led coalition,
 The recent overture to France offering an alternative to the NATO
 alignment as a means of preventing the renascence of German mili-
 tary power is a case in point.
