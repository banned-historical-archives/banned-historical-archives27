 December 1971
 CHILE'S DETERIORATING ECONOMY
 1.  Chile's growing economic problems were acknowledged by
 Allende himself in his first anniversary speech on 4 November.
 Although the bulk of the speech was devoted to claims of the
 government's material accomplishments, Allende did note a number
 of the problems.  He admitted there were scarcities of food and
 consumer goods, that mining production was off and that miners'
 wages would be tied to gains in production.  In foreign economics
 he said his goverment was the 'Snort heavily indebted in the
 world" on a per capita basis.  Five days later Allende announced
 that the Popular Unity government would seek to renegotiate Chile's
 huge foreign debt of some $4 billion and tried inaccurately
 to blame Chile's current-.balance-of -payments crisis on economic mis-
 management by previous administrations and "unilateral actions"
 by the U.5. government.
 2.  The real reason for this crisis in the Chilean economy
 lies in the fact the Allende government has continued expansion-
 type policies contrary to its own Central Bank recommendations
 that it curtail deficit spending (now estimated at thirty per
 cent of government expenditures), raise prices charged by
 nationalized enterprises, allow pr. ices on luxury goods to rise,
 reassure private investors and devalue the escudo to stimulate
 exports and reduce imports.
 3.  When the Allende government took over one year ago, Chile's
 foreign reserves amounted to almost $400 million, but because
 export earnings from the nationalized copper industry have declined,
 food import requirements have increased and foreign lines of credit
 have dried up, these reserves have now plunged to just above
 $100 million.
 a)  Large-scale foreign aid and credits during the past
 decade sharply increased Chile's external debt (to approxi-
 mately $2.3 billion), with the heaviest repayments scheduled
 during the next few years (an average $330 million annually
 during 1971-1973).  Nevertheless, Chile could have covered
 its debt service obligations if copper production had
 increased by some forty per cent as it was expected to do
 under the U.S. companies' expansion program.
 b)  Instead, the nationalized mine operations have suffered
 from inefficiency, absenteeism and a lack of labor discipline, and
 therefore the actual increase has been only a little over four
 per cent.  This, combined with a twenty-two per cent drop in
 international copper prices, has reduced the expected copper
 export earnings by about one-half billion dollars, with
 indications the gap will b~:;? even greater in 1972.

 CIA-RDP79-01194A000300020001-1
 c)  The administration's agrarian reform policies, with
 resulting shortfalls in agricultural production, have led to
 a sharp rise in import reQuirements.  There have been wide-
 spread embarrassing shortages of food and other consumer goods
 imports in spite o#: more than double the 1970 foreign exchange
 expenditures for these very items.
 d)  Chile's inability to meet its foreign debt obligations
 is also a result of the Allende administration's radical
 policies and the subseQuent decline ~n Chile's credit rating.
 Foreign lines of credit have dried up and few new loans have
 been extended.  The Communist loans have all been tied to
 specific projects and cover purchases of goods and services
 only from the creditor country.
 4.  Likewise, basic facts and figures belie Allende's alle-
 gation that U.S. "unilateral actions" are in part responsible for
 his country's foreign exchange crisis.  The U.S. ten per cent
 surcharge affects only 5.7 per cent of Chile's exports to the
 United States and less than 0.7 per cent of its total. exports.
 Although U.S. economic aid was substantial in the early years of
 the Frei government, it was reduced to less than $25 million in
 1970 because of Chile's high copper earnings and rapidly increasing
 foreign reserves.  Since no new aid projects were scheduled for
 1971, the aid cut-off has little economic effect.
 S.  Allende also erred when he claimed that Chile's per
 capita external debt is the world's highest.  Cuba has the
 highest foreign debt:  $3.3 billion or $390 per capita as
 compared to Chile's $2.3 billion or $250 per capita.  Furthermore,
 Chile might well bear in m~.nd that ninety per cent of Cuba's debt
 is with the Soviet Union, a~~factor which has limited Cuba's
 freedom of action in both the economic and political spheres.

 1'~1HE  international  politics
 A  or   extracting ,natural
 resources  is  rarely  tranquil,
 and  the  case  of  Chilean
 cropper may yet rival bhe oil
 of   the   Middle   East   for
 intrigue   and  complications.
 Besides the main adversaries,
 Chile and the United; States,
 the  French  arc peri~jherally
 involved 'and  the          Soviet
 Union has plaYCd  a fascina-
 ting if sa far limited role.
 The US Government came
 iuto conflict with Chi)e when
 President Allende made clear
 that  in  nationalising  copper
 lie  did  not  intend  to  pay
 American-based          cotrtpanics
 anything like what t)tey felt
 vvas the value of their hold-
 ings.     Senor     Allende
 announced this intention the
 day  that  Congress  unani-
 znously approved the Constitu-
 tional  amendment  enabling
 nationalisation.
 On what is now known as
 " the   Day    of   \Tational
 Dignity,"   July   11,   Senor
 Allende  accused  the  com-
 panies Anaconda and Kenne-
 cott  ~af  havin.g  misritanaged
 the copper mines and taken
 out excess profits. To sustain
 the  mismanagement  charge
 he  referred  exclusively  and
 exhaustively       to   investiga-
 t.ions  by a French  firm "~of
 indisputable        prestige "   as
 well as by a Soviet team.
 Ewer
 Senor AlIende's resumd of
 those studies gave  a  picture
 ~of bum?bling and breed by the
 companies  that  would  cost
 Chile  dearly  in  its  future
 development  of  the  topper
 mines.
 An  eager -press  was  told
 that the  French  and Soviet
 ,~~tudies  would  not  ?be  made
 Public.  The  team  of  the
 I~`rench il2ining Society - in
 vvhich  the  French  'Govern-
 rnent has a majority holding
 -- had departed iuithout leav-
 ing  a  .copy  with  lts  gown
 P~.mbassy.
 But  secret  -papers  are  a't
 lcas~t   as   vulnerable      in
 .Santiago  as In  Washington,
 ~a.nd  the  French  report  was
 passed   to   the   Opposition
 newspaper  " iVlercurio."  The

 went,     i~t   had      undergone              satisfaction in the role played   to be delivered.
 by tlto Soviet study in atflic-
 ting   the   American     com-
 panies, the Communists must
 have been perplexed by what
 .happened next.
 On Tuesday, Senator Frank
 Church   (Democrat,  Idaho)
 revealed   that  at  the  very
 moment     when  the        Soviet
 experts'   report  was      being
 used against the companies in
 July, Mr Iiosygin was propos-
 ing that the companies should
 extract copper from Siberia.
 The Soviet study had said
 "The decision taken by the
 Chilean Government to carry
 out  total  nationalisation  of
 the big copper companies and
 the creation, in this way, of a
 State  direction  of  copper
 activity,  is  a  transcendental
 step in the task of organising
 copper Production . . '
 But Mr Kosygin  was tell-
 ing David Rockefeller, of the
 Chase 1lnanhattan Bank, that
 American  companies  could
 come in alone in association
 with Soviet teams to thine the
 copper, anct could ta':c their
 pay in the copper itself.
 i~'or Chile, such a develop-
 ment  would  mean  contpcti-
 tian for major export, and a
 possible immediate  effect on
 the  already  weakened  price
 of  copper. 1t also  suggested
 that the Soviet expcri  had
 not found the ,perfort~t::r~cc I;~?
 the  American cotnpat~tes  so
 deplorable after all.
 The next day, the Chilean
 Minister of Mines said there
 was  piers ,y  of  room  in  the
 market for  everybody,  and
 added  that Chile's Ambassa-
 dors in Washington and 1los-
 cow  vverc  asking  for  more
 ini'ormation.
 D In  Washington i4Ir Itoget~s
 let it be known over the
 weekend that the US is pre-
 pared to invoke the so-called
 Hicl.enlooper Amendment if
 Chile persists in its re~Fasal to
 compensate the copper com-
 panics.
 Pf that happened - .and it
 would  be  the  first  time
 that the  US  had  used  the
 special Bowers voted by Con-
 gress  iq  1964  -  it  would
 mean that  all  direct Ameri-
 can aid and some aid given
 through            international
 organisations to Chile would
 be cu't off.
 At  the  moment  Chile  is
 expecting    same     $20
 millions of US aid that is now
 in the pipeline

 wish  to  cut  all  market  and       there is another six or seven
 praise of the mines. If Senor                credit  ties  with  tite  United      milllion  dollars  in  food  aid

 The  use  made   of  the
 >'rench report has become an
 issue in Paris as well ?as in
 Santiago (no one has denied
 the   authenttcrty   ~of   the
 " Mercurio "  text), and it it
 understood that this will be
 the last such undertaking by
 .the French tl4ining Society.
 In the partisan press it was
 suggested  that  the  French
 'experts were :few and were at
 the  mines  barely  a  month,
 and  their  firm  was  not  all
 that expert in topper anyway.
 At  this  point,  the  Com-
 munist  Party   paper,   "' El
 Siglo," published the text of
 the  Soviet  5nvestigation  of
 the  mines.  It  was  highly

 SANTIAGO, Chile, Oct. 28-
 . n ec nom
 political implications is being
 grudgingly  recognized    as  a
 reality  by  Chile's  left-wing
 Government,  as  well  as  by
 Opposition parties and business
 sectors.
 President  Salvador  Allende
 Gossens, in a sometimes angry
 talk to heads of  Government
 departments recently, said that
 without a greater sense of re-
 sponsibility in public 'manage-
 ment "we are headed for an
 irremediable failure in the short
 run."
 Luins Corval~, secretary gen-
 eral of the Communist party,
 which  forms  part  of  Mr.  Al-
 lende's Popular Unity coalition,
 said  there   were  signs  that
 Chile's  revolutionary  regime
 was losing public support.
 The National Council of the
 Christian   Democratic   party,
 Chile's major Opposition force,
 declared after a weekend meet-
 ing called to analyze the politi-
 cal situation that Chile faced
 "the worst economic crisis in
 her history."
 Businessmen Pessimistic
 An  assembly here  of  busi-
 nessmen and industrialists from
 all over Chile found prospects
 for the survival of private enter-
 prise  very  uncertain  even  in
 areas that Dr. Allende has said
 should remain outside of state
 ownership.
 The speakers who drew the
 most applause at a meeting of
 Chile's Confederation of Com-
 merce  and  Production  were
 those  calling on businessmen
 and workers who do not want
 to be state employes want to
 "political  action"  against the
 establishment of a full Marxist
 regime.
 The recent signs of official
 concern over the political con-
 sequences  of  the  economic
 crisis grow out of some situa-
 tions of which the public has
 been aware for some time and'
 of  others  that  are  perceived
 mainly by technical analysts.
 Economic stress is most ap-
 parent in  the  shortages  that
 have developed in some con-;
 Sumer goods. The problem is
 discussed  constantly  here  in
 markets,  in  homes  and  on
 buses, and is a daily topic in
 the Opposition newspapers .and;
 in radio commentaries.
 The   shotages   are   most;
 noticeable in markets. Beef is
 A p~ r~~-e dl ~ c~ ~ e ~e its
 month and poultry :.ud c~;hs are
 ently  not  to  be  found.
 Dai   products  and  canned
 goo s are often missing from;
 stor  shelves. Supplies of cloth;
 hav   been irregular since tex-
 the    ills were nationalized.
 Black  Market Is Busy
 ere are many signs of black,
 mar et  operations.  Chickens
 and   ggs are delivered at homes
 in  he  wealthier  districts  at
 pric s well above .those set by
 the   rice control agency. Small
 dre   makers .and producers of
 met 1 goods  are paying well
 abo a official prices for supplies
 the   obtain  from  middlemen
 wh   have access to unregulated
 sou ces.
 rlier this year,  after the
 Go ernment  authorized  wage
 inc   ased of 40 to 60 per cent
 an    put controls on the prices
 of    ost consumer goods, Chi-
 les swent on a buying spree.
 is was a period of great
 po    larity for Dr. Allende and
 his coalition. In April, Popular
 Un y  candidates  won  nearly
 50    er cent of the votes cast in
 mu icipal elections, well above;
 -the 36.3 per cent won by Dr,~
 Alt nde in the Presidential elec-~
 do  of September, 1970, in a!
 thr a-way race.
 e`Government's attempt to
 fro   prices down is now under
 se    re pressure because of in-
 fla ionary  money,  wage  and
 ere it policies that have been
 fol   wed since November. The
 m     ey supply has risen 75 per
 ce t since December and the
 Go ernment has an enormous
 de cit. The official cost of liv-
 in    index shows a 14 per cent
 ris  in prices during the first
 ni      months of the year, but
 thi  is not regarded as an ac-

 SANTIAGO, 'RTOV.  9-Presi-i
 dent  5alvadar  Allende  an-
 nounced today that Chile will
 call in .its creditors to renego-
 tiate $3 billion in foreign debt,
 over half of which is owed to
 the United States.
 Blaming  the  debt  service
 crisis on the borrowing poll-
 cies of past governments, Al-
 lende said his year-old govern-
 ment "has resolved to renego-
 tiate the external debt with the
 abject of satisfying adequate-
 ly the interests of the country
 and its creditors."
 The  $3 billion figure does
 not include another $728- mil-~
 lion in debts accrued by the.
 government when it national-
 ized  American-based  copper
 companies.  tyhile  Chile  in-
 tends to pay no indemnization
 for the major mines, it has in-'!
 dicated that most of their in-
 herited debts. would be hon-
 t ored.
 Allende made the announce-
 ment on television and later
 at a news conference dominat-
 ed by the one story absorbing
 all  of  Chile's  press-the  ar-
 rival Wednesday of Cuban pre-
 ~ mier Fidel Castro.
 Chile has the world's highest
 per .capita  debt  along  with
 Israel,  according  to  Allende,!
 and recent economic difficul-
 ties have made its renegotia-
 tion widely expected.
 Indeed,  the  more  militant
 wing  of  Allende's  Socialist
 Party includes many members
 who have called for repudi-
 ation of the debt.              i
 But Allende chose the con.l
 ciliatory stand of negotiation.?
 He put it this way:            j
 "'i'he   government     under-
 stands that any state, in ex-'
 ~Ci~~~~~~ ~Y ~~~~s
 else of its sovereignty, cant
 a   cl  oug~~t.  to  talce  measures.;
 t nding to protect its develop-?
 ent and level of living of its'
 p ogle. The United States, to
 c nfront  its  own  balance  of
 p ,yment  crisis,  has  adopted
 u ilateral measures with this
 a  the object.
 "The  government of Chile,'
 n vertheless, prefers not to use
 at approach"
 Thus, he said, Chile asks the
 c editors to negotiate to per-
 i  s of payment and to con-
 s lidate the debts.
 Attende referred to numer-
 o sprecedents for the action,
 i eluding  renegotiations ''by
 a   1968  by  Peru.  However,,
 ru  at  that time  was  on1y~
 a le to renegotiate  about 30
 p r  cent  of  its  outstanding,
 d bt.
 Negotiations  of  this  type
 u wally  are  drawn  out  and
 a e seldom satisfactory to the
 d bt-ria'r]en country. Frequent-
 ]  the result is that the debt.
 i  extended but the interest
 c arges are increased.
 Iowever, bankers point out
 t at given the widely held view:
 t at Chile might repudiate its
 d bt, the d5sposition to negoti-
 a emight find the lenders also
 f rthcoming. An official in the
 S. ATD mission termed Al-
 l ode's statement as concilia-
 t ry.
 An  official  ;overnment  ac-
 c unting  at the  end  of last
 y ar put the debt at $2.8 bil-
 l   n,  not  including  private
 d bt. Of that, about $550 mil-
 l   n  was in  AID  loans, $335
 illion in export-import Bank
 1 ins and $.400 million in lend=
 i   g  by  private  U.S.  institu-!
 t' ns to  the  Chilean  govern- ~
 ent.
 'Phere a;?e several precedents
 f r the A~
 renogatiating  debts   of  this.
 sort, and a Chilean opposition
 leader  just  back  from  New
 York said he found the private
 banks there disposed to take
 the same position.
 Among the reasons Allende
 gave  for  Chile's  difficulties
 were the closing of credit lines
 on the order of $190 million be-
 cause of failure to meet oblit;a-
 tions by the private Edwards
 Bank .here.  The, bank- denies
 -this allegatioa.
 Allende wore his most serf-
 ous expression  during his  ex~
 position of the debt situation,
 but he lightened up on the'
 question of Castro's visit.
 After arrival on Wednesday,
 the? Cuban leader is to leave
 Friday  for  the  northern  de-
 Bert to visit copper and nitrate
 mines.
 Ile then will turn south to
 Concepcion,  center  of  the
 steel industry and home of the
 most radical student  groups
 calling for violent revolution
 -Allende  pointed  out  care-
 fully  that  while  he  admires
 greatly the Cuban revolution
 it  is  not  the  same  as  that
 desired  here.  Finally,  Castro
 is to go> by boat through the
 channels of the extreme Chi-
 lean south to the city of Puntal
 Arenas on the Straits of Magel-';
 lan.
 Allende is an old friend of
 Castro and the. entire left of
 this ever more leftist country
 considers itself to be a friend
 equal.iy.
 Although  Allende  had  de-
 clared last Thursday that he
 would submit to congress to-
 day his~proposai for amending
 the  constitution  so  as  to  re-
 place -the bicameral congress
 with a one?house body, he failed
 to  put  that  bill  in.  It  ap-
 parently got cost in the rush
 to prepare for Castro.

 ran king economic o :cia
 President Salvador Allende
 Gossens's Government  re-
 cently took part in a semi-
 nar for lawyers discussing
 the  technical  ways  and
 means of expropriation in
 Chile.
 The official apologized to
 the lawyers for his lack of
 legal expertise, but he as-
 sured them of one thin;: the
 motivation behind every im-
 portant economic decision by
 Chile's Marxist-oriented Gov-
 ernment is political.
 That may be true in any
 country, but in Chile the pol-
 itics are socialist and the
 economy is still capitalist. As
 the country approaches its
 first anniversary under Marx
 ist management, the Chilean
 economy is an odd amalgam
 of relatively high  employ
 anent and consumer short-
 ages, price controls and infla-
 tion struggling to get away,
 high consumer spending and
 rapidly falling reserves of
 foreign exchange.
 To understand the some,
 times confusing picture of ah
 economy in transition from
 'capitalism to socialism with.
 ill a traditional legal frame-
 work, it helps to bear in
 mind the political uses of
 economic policy.
 President Allende's Admin-
 istration has used economic
 policy to make its electorate
 happy with more money to
 spend, as well as to destroy
 the economic power base of
 its political enemies in bank-
 ing, textiles and farming. It
 has declared its independence
 from ',.he United States, thb
 "imperialist enemy" that was
 once the prime source of
 Chile's  foreign  credit  and
 capital, by making it clear
 that little or no compensa-
 tion will be paid for Ameri-
 can equity in nationalized
 copper interests.

 PULP-PAPER INDUSTRY FIGHTS FOR FREEDOM
 Almost lost. amid the din and uproar sur?
 roundin  the visit of Cuban Premier Fidel
 Castro is a battle between the government
 a.nd opposition here for control of Chile's
 pulp and paper industry.
 In the long run, the issue could prove
 the most crucial encounter yet between
 supporters of Marxist President Allende and
 the coalescing opposition forces.
 Moreover, Chile's tradition of pluralistic
 free press could be at stake.
 The whole affair centers around govern-
 ment efforts to buy control of the Com-
 naxiia vianufacturera de Papeles Cartones,
 the last remaining major pulp and paper
 manufacturer in private hands in Chile.
 To opponents of the government, the bid
 by Dr.; Ailende's government to buy up
 enough shares to get control of the firm,
 amounts to a major threat to freedom of the
 ^ress. The government denies that this is
 w case, but says that key industries in Chile
 iould be under state control-and pulp and
 ap' r is one of those industries.
 The concern among government oppo?
 tints is that a free press will be dificuit to
 :?2intain if it must rely on the government
 or newsprint supply.

 he government bid to purchase shares in
 .u Papalera, as the pulp and paper firm is
 lied, has net resistance on the local
 stock market, although the government is
 offering a premium for the shares - paying
 up to 4.2 cents per share, while the stock in
 recent weeks has been trading at about
 seven-tenths of 1 cent per share.,
 it is estimated that the government now
 may hold about 15 percent of the total
 shares, having purchased some 5 percent
 in the first week of trading at the inflatcd
 price and Acquiring another 10 percent or
 so by ,default when it recently purchased
 controlling interests in most major banks
 here.
 Z', ork  s in La Papalerzt have voted to
 oppose the government and are buying up
 shares themselves to keep the firm from
 passing into government hands.
 Moreover, the Christian Democrats have
 introduced a aroad constitutional amend-
 ment into the Congress that, among other
 tl 7n-,s, would have the effect of nu lifying
 tie government's pJ.reha.se of shares in 11i

 purchased if the amendment passes and be-
 comes a part of the constitution.
 The government's action in La Papelera
 case becomes all the more critical because
 of other recent d::velopments here.
 This week, Chile's major news magazine,
 the respected #rcilla, ,announced that it
 would soon appear on nevasprint rather than
 the special imported glossy stock it has
 used for years. The magazine has blamed
 the government-controlled firm which prints
 the magazine for not maintaining an ad-
 equate supply of the imported paper, despite
 a contract.
 The opposition also points to the recent
 reassignment of radio frequencies which'
 last week resulted in the shutting down of.
 Radio Balmaceda for most of a day. The
 station belongs to the Christian Democratic
 Party. The Radio Balmaceda frequency was
 given a new station representing a Com-
 munist-controlled labor union, while Balma-
 ceda was assigned a less desirable fre-
 quency.
 There is some evidence that the shutting
 down of Radio 3almaeeda for the day may
 have been a mixup on the part of the gov-
 ernment. VJilile some opposition forces are
 prepared to accept the government's com-
 ment on the situation, they point out that
 the incidents, however, came at a bad time
 not to arouse suspicion.

 SOUTH VIETNAM AND THE QUESTION OF POWs
 On 28 October the South Vietnamese government announced that
 it was honoring National Day and the start of President Thieu's
 second term in office by releasing 618 Viet Cong prisoners now and
 2,284 more over the next few months.  Mr. Thieu's gesture, although
 dramatic, may not inspire the North Vietnamese regime to anything
 beyond the polemics which have historically greeted any initiatives
 on prisoner exchanges.  Even recently, when Saigon bettered its
 previous POW offers by promising to send badly injured prisoners
 back to North Vietnam without a quid pro quo, Hanoi showed very
 little interest,
 It is hard to accept the possibility that this most recent
 Saigon POW initiative may meet the same fate as its predecessors.
 Hanoi is demonstrably sensitive to world opinion on the POW issue
 and surely realizes that the release of some 3,000 Viet Cong
 prisoners cannot be effectively answered by Communist denunciations
 of "fraud" and "a meaningless propaganda gesture,"  To be sure,
 Thieu coupled his humanitarian act with considerable tub-thumping.--
 and why not?  As The Economist's correspondent pointed out in this
 connection, "a gesture  oesn t have to be ingenuous to be effective,"
 Regardless of the benefits to the Saigon regime, however, the
 importance of the prisoner release cannot be ignored, nor can the
 weak and waspish Communist reaction be justified.
 Hanoi's waspishness, in fact, could be taken in some circles
 as an indication that her leadership recognizes the Thieu govern-
 ment's sense of security in carrying out such a prisoner release
 as well as the government's assurance in announcing a programmed
 succession of additional releases over the next few months.  Saigon's
 demonstration of security and confidence is in the nature of a
 challenge and Hanoi's leaders, being no fools, may find it awkward
 to bypass the well-publicized release of Communist prisoners without
 a more closely equivalent response than polemics.  What's more,
 each successive prisoner release by Saigon over the next few months
 could make Hanoi's position even stickier.
 North Vietnamese leaders must also find it increasingly
 awkward to ignore the generous offers of neutral nations to serve
 as temporary internment areas for North Vietnamese and U.S. POWs,.
 Austria, Cyprus, Norway, Sweden and Lebanon have all made such
 proposals recently and Lebanon then repeated its earlier proposal
 through the United Nations Political. Committee.  There are signs
 that other neutral nations are likely to come forward with similar
 proposals for POW sanctuary in the near future.   Each time such a

 to respond positively.  Hanoi has not yet responded,  Both Vietnam and
 the U.S., incidentally, were signatories to the 1949 Geneva Con-
 vention on POWs which specifically permits third-country internment.
 International accords aside, the Hanoi regime itself is remiss
 with regard to North Vietnamese troops fighting in South Vietnam.
 Despite its admonitions to the North Vietnamese people (Hoc Ta , July
 1971) that "the policy towards the war invalids, demobilize  service-
 men, families of the war dead and families of troops consists of
 constantly insuring that they are materially secure and spiritually
 happy," the regime falls short of practicing what it preaches.  Should
 it seriously examine its own shortcomings, it might stumble upon some
 way of helping North Vietnamese fighting men who have been captured
 on South Vietnamese battlefields.  The regime could start, for
 instance, with a response to Saigon's October POW initiative honestly
 aimed at securing the release and repatriation of at least a few
 hundred of the 9,000 North Vietnamese troops now incarcerated in
 South Vietnam.
 In this connection it might be profitable for North Vietnamese
 leaders to speculate on 66 of their North Vietnamese Army troopers
 who recently came to public attention in one of Saigon's six POW
 camps.  It happened at the end of October when the South Vietnamese
 government permitted a group of foreign correspondents to tour
 Saigon's POW camp at Cantho in the Mekong Delta.  When the visiting
 newsmen inquired about the makeup of the camp's 3,007 POW population,
 they learned that 66 of the prisoners were North Vietnamese Army
 troops who had been captured in South Vietnam.,  These 66 men, like
 the remainder of the NVA personnel in POW camps, can hope for release
 only by Presidential order, or through the type of POW exchange the
 North Vietnamese government seems unwilling to undertake,  In
 discussions with newsmen on this possibility, members of the camp
 staff expressed the view that the North Vietnamese POWs would prefer
 the relatively comfortable existence of POWs in the South to the
 hazards and austerities of the North.  Newsmen may    ? have taken
 this view with a grain of salt, but it is a factor that Hanoi's
 leaders must take into consideration if they ever weigh out seriously
 the possibility of POW exchanges.
 The consensus of the foreign newsmen who visited Cantho was that
 although the camp had obviously been spruced up for their tour, it
 was generally well run and its 3,007 inmates better cared for and
 living better than they did as Viet Cong guerrillas.  Regular
 inspections by the International Red Cross are, of course, a factor
 in ensuring proper facilities and treatment for the camp's POW
 population.  Like other POW-related factors, International Red Cross
 scrutiny is one which Hanoi's leaders seem unwilling to risk.

 THE ECONOMIST
 30 October 1971
 Vietnam
 A gesture doesn't have to be ingenuous
 to be effective. The South Vietnamese
 government announced on Thursday
 that it will celebrate the start of
 President Thieu's second term on Sun-
 day  by  releasing  618                               Vietcong
 prisoners now and 2,284 more over
 the next few months. The idea of
 an  exchange  of  prisoners  between
 Saigon and Hanoi was floated a long
 time ago, but the North Vietnamese
 showed very little interest even when
 Mr Thieu bettered  his offer and,
 promised  to  send    badly  injured
 prisoners back without a quid pro quo.
 Now he has made an even         more
 dramatic unilateral gesture, and it is
 one of the few propaganda victories
 he has been able to pull off lately.
 Some come out
 1 November 1971
 App
 and mark the first major move toward
 settlement of the POW problem.
 The announcement from Saigon was
 followed immediately by rumors that
 some 200 American prisoners were on
 their way home from North Vietnamese
 .camps. It's a possibility, but a remote
 one. For one thing, the rumor was
 promptly and vehemently denied by var-
 ious interested parties in Washington.
 For. another, any such large-scale re-
 lease of Americans or South Vietnamese
 would be preceded by considerable beat-
 ing of the propaganda drums.
 It must be recognized, too, that Pres-
 ident Thieu has coupled the humani-
 tarian gesture with considerable politi-
 cal tub-thumping of his own. The re-
 lease was timed to serve as a part of his
 second inaugural gala. The 618 prison-
 ers who will, be released outright are,
 0
 It is hard to believe that the Com-
 munist characterization of the release
 of some 3,000 Viet Gong prisoners as an
 "impudent maneuver" is to be their only
 reaction to the South Vietnamese initia-
 tive. Despite the Paris negotiators' at-
 tempts to write off President Thieu's act
 as a meaningless propaganda- gesture,
 the mass release could looser the logjam
 CPYRGHT
 The sceptics will be quick Ito observe
 that the released men are a small pro-
 portion of the 4o,ooo-odd prisoners
 that the South Vietnamese have in
 their hands ; that 176 of the first
 batch are in very poor health ; and
 that most of the others are now prob-
 ably regarded as " rehabilitated." But
 this biggest release yet will help Mr
 Thieu. It could well make it a bit
 easier to get Congress in Washington
 to accept  the Administration's aid
 programme. And it will strengthen
 President Nixon's position if he plans
 to announce something short of a.
 programme  for  complete  American
 withdrawal when he makes his next

 through the "Open Arms" program,
 which means a brief period of ideo-
 lcgical indoctrination and a promise
 to work for the Thieu goverment a-s
 propagandists and intelligence gather-
 ers after their release.
 So the prisoners are being handed
 over with a few strings attached. That
 does not, however, negate its importance
 or justify the weak and waspish Commu-
 nist response. The move is a demonstra-
 tion of confidence and security on the
 part of the Thieu government. And for
 that reason alone, it seems unlikely that
 the Communists can let it pass without
 some more closely equivalent response.
 It is not impossible that Hanoi and
 the VC will decide that the, only way to
 save face is a reciprocal release of
 prisoners-an "anything-you-oan-do-I-
 can-do-better" maneuver. If so, a mu- ..
 tual exchange program could be es-
 tablished that would, sooner or later,
 involve the U.S. prisoners.  Such a
 program would, it is true, be based more,
 on bravado than on reason or humani-
 tarian considerations. But regardless of
 motivations, President Thieu deserves
 gratitude and congratulations for mak-
 ing g the first major move in a process

 The Pentagon said that the

 State Department specialists
 on Vietnam said that all signs
 at present suggest that the
 North  Vietnamese  have  not

 been that no American prisoner

 SHORT SUBJECTS
 Soviet Contempt for Yugoslavia.  Soviet contempt for Yugoslavia
 manifesto; itself aimost before tfie ink was dry on the joint state-
 ment issued after the Brezhnev-Tito summit meeting 22-25 September.
 Pravda's 4 October editorial comment on the meeting gave a grossly
 ls~' torted:interpretation of the significance of the encounter.
 Pravda portrayed Yugoslavia as no more, nor less a Satellite than
 Bu garia and Hungary, ignoring all references in the joint state
 ment to the importance of mutual respect for independence and
 sovereignty among "socialist" nations.  (See Pravda editorial
 attached.)
 When it suits the Soviets' purposes, they are willing to
 describe Yugoslavia as a "socialist" country, but it must be clear
 to all that this is little more than a verbal game.  The Yugoslav
 newspaper V'esnik (30 October) pointed out that Soviet Premier
 Alexei KoSygin omitted Yugoslavia from a list of countries he
 described as "having gained socialism."  Whether Kosygin's
 omission was inadverent or deliberate, it indicates how lightly
 the Soviets regard Yugoslav claims,
 Brezhnev's Paris Debut.  The recent visit of Soviet Party
 Secretary Leonid  rez  ev to France (25-30 October), though
 surrounded by an atmosphere of good will and accomplishment,
 produced few changes of position on either side.  However, as a
 high-level public relations exercise, it was useful politically
 to both parties.  Since General de Gaulle's trip to Moscow (1966),
 the French have claimed a special relationship with the USSR and
 East Europe.  This concept has fit in well with France's desire
 for a more independent role in Europe and, in turn, has been used
 by the USSR in an effort to drive a wedge in the Western alliance,
 Emphasizing his close relations with Paris at this time also suits
 Comrade Br.ezhnev's current efforts to portray the Soviet Union as
 the protagonist of pan-European detente.
 Brezhnev did not get French'agreement for the friendship
 treaty he sought and was obliged to settle for a joint statement
 known as "Principles of Cooperation."  The document produced no
 surprises.  Also signed was a ten-year agreement providing for
 each country to help build industrial plants in the other.  In
 this case, too, the document added little to an agreement on the
 same subject which has been in effect for five years.  Even if the
 meeting was short on substantive accomplishment, it did provide

 Brezhnev with a forum from which to hawk Moscow's latest wares,
 particularly the Soviet program for a general European detente.
 The French public was largely indifferent to Brezhnev -- in contrast
 to the welcome given Khrushchev in 1960 -- but Soviet media praised
 his initiative and exaggerated his accomplishments.  Meanwhile, the
 French Communist Party, which was unable to produce any mass turnout
 for their distinguished visitor, was generally ignored by the Soviet
 leader.
 For Pompidou, the visit provided an opportunity to exploit the
 special French-Soviet relationship in an effort to balance Bonn's
 Ostpolitik.  While conceding little of substance, the French Presi-
 dent, by his cordial reception of the Soviet leader, also made it
 more difficult henceforth for the French Communists to criticize
 his government.  President Pompidou, despite his accommodating
 attitude, made it clear -- as he did during his visit to Moscow a
 year ago -- that France remains firmly in the Western alliance.
 Where is the Dedicated Communist Warrior Of Yesteryear? A
 series o  articles in the o fIETEial Morietnamese Army newspaper,
 Quan Doi Nhan Dan offers an interesting counterpoint for the usual
 paeans to t He tireless dedication of Communist warriors.  On July
 7th the newspaper described the leaders of the North Vietnamese
 Army (PAVN) as "often lax in disciplining subordinates and failing
 to set a proper example."  The troops were described, in turn, as
 "unwilling to carry out orders or accept criticism."    Later that
 month   awn Doi Nhan Dan criticized "poor relations between leaders
 and men which le  to inefficiency and discord."
 Lack of enthusiasm was the theme of an article on August 5th
 and two days later the army newspaper complained that "PAVN troops
 are not training or studying hard enough, and are not showing
 enough resilience in the face of the difficulties and hardships of
 war."  Party members "have a duty to instill fervor and patriotism
 into the men and help them overcome erroneous and passive thoughts."
 By the 12th of August the newspaper had concluded that "worse than
 the lack of discipline itself is the fact that it is tolerated by
 the leaders."  Some men, even when they volunteered for certain
 duties, "fail to carry them out efficiently or even to understand
 fully the nature of the duties."  On September 17th the newspaper
 suggested that increased attention to the soldiers' physical and
 mental welfare might help to solve some of the problems for "if the
 men were physically fitter, morale might be better."
 In October   an Doi Nhan Dan's theme was the misuse of
 weapons.  Rules  a  been-Broken, men were using their weapons for
 hunting and fishing or lending them out without authorization.
 The newspaper urged that "equipment inspections be carried out
 regularly and thoroughly in order to avoid more accidents where

 weapons had not been properly maintained" and "to eliminate situ-
 ations where weapons needed urgently could not be found."  Either
 an unusually cantankerous staff is manning the editorial desks of
 Hanoi's axmy newspaper or the stories circulating in Vietnam are
 true about the concern among the North Vietnamese leadership
 regarding the lack of discipline and low morale among PAVN troops.

 PRAVDA, Moscow
 2 October 1971
 The socialist world is gathering new forces and developing with optimism and
 confidence in its.-historical prospects.   The socialist countries are united by
 community of-the sociopolitical system, coincidence of fundamental interests and aims,
 and loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.   By
 coordinating their actions and agreeing on positions on the main foreign policy questions
 the fraternal countries are exerting an increasingly active and decisive influence on
 the international situation and on the course of the modern revolutionary forces' common
 struggle against imperialism and for peace, democracy and socialism.  Cooperation allows
 them. by enriching each other's experience, jointly to solve the fundamental problems
 of socialist and communist building, to find the most rational forms of economic ties
 and colleetive];y to determine a common line in foreign policy activity.
 The recently concluded friendly visits which Comrade L.I. Brezhnev, CPSU Central
 Committee general secretary, made to Yugoslavia, Hungary and Bulgaria,were a weighty
 contribution to the cause of further strengthening the unity of the socialist countries.
 The talks in Belgrade, Budapest and Sofia were an important step on the path of the
 increasingly close coordination of the fraternal parties' and countries' foreign' policy
 activity and of their extensive and multifaceted cooperation.   Speaking to Yugoslav
 workers in Zemun, Comrade L.I. Brezhnev said:   "The Soviet Union has believed and
 believes that under modern conditions, when the antagonism between the forces of reaction
 and progress and the. forces of capitalism and socialism is not ceasing in the world
 arena, the socialist states' active and coordinated policy must be couuterposed to the
 actions of imperialism and reaction."
 The line of further strengthening the unity of the socialist community countries found
 its specific embodiment in the results of L.I. Brezhnev's visit to Yugoslavia.   New
 prospects for developing mutually advantageous and truly fraternal cooperation were
 revealed as a result of the fruitful talks.   As is noted in the joint statiement adopted
 at the talks, cooperation between the USSR and Yugoslavia is based on community of the
 bases of the social system and adherence to the principles of socialist internationalism.
 The results of the visit showed that the peoples of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are
 united by common class interests and by unity of ultimate aims.   In the worldwide
 historic struggle against imperialist aggression and for the consolidation of peace and
 the triumph of freedom and progress the peoples of our countries stand on the Name side
 of the barricade as comrades and brothers in arms.  The viewpoints of Yugoslavia and
 the Soviet pinion proceed from common vital interests in. creating a reliable system of
 European security, holding a pan-European conference and strengthening stable peace
 and security in the Balkans.
 The USSR and Yugoslavia support the heroic struggle of the peoples of Indochina, in-
 sisting firmly on the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops and those of their allies from
 this region, they confirm their decisive support for the Arab peoples, struggle to liqui-
 date the consequences of Israeli aggression, and they support the implementation of ~.: .'?
 practical measures in the field of disarmament and demand the liquidation of all  vestiges
 of colonialism.
 An important and, comradely exchange of 'opinions took place in Budapest and in Sofia.
 The meetings and talks, conducted in a cordial atmosphere, showed the strength and
 inviolability of the fraternal, friendly ties and the unity of views.   Soviet people
 are profoundly satisfied with the results of L.I. Brezhnevoa visit to Hungary and
 ,Bulgaria.

 combining rapid economic and scientific and technical growth with the flourishing of
 socialist culture and an upsurge in the people Is well-being.  With warm sympathy they
 follow the successful development of fraternal. Hungary and Bulgaria, the fulfillment
 by the communists.and all working people of these countries of the tasks set by the
 recently held party congresses, and the struggle to implement the Leninist ideas on
 building the new society.  They are truly gladdened by any success and any achieve-
 ment on the part of the fraternal peoples.  The numerous instances of constantly
 developing economic ties are making them aware of the creative enthusiasm with which the
 working peoples of these countries have entered into the fulfillment of the comprehensive
 program adopted at the 25th CEMA session.
 The community of socialist states is the reliable stronghold of the peoples in the
 struggle against imperialism and for socialism, peace and social progress.   Its role
 in preserving  and strengthening peace in Europe is particularly great.  The pan-
 European conference, the ratification of the treaties between the USSR and the FRG and
 between Poland and the FRG and the reduction of armaments and armed forces in Europe
 must become important landmarks on the path-of consolidating a stable peace on our
 continent.  The meetings in Budapest and Sofia demonstrated once more the unity of views
 on urgent problems of the international situation, and above all on problems of European
 security.                                                                                 _
 For peoples Bulgaria these fall days will remain memorable also because it's loyal son
 Todor Zhivkov was awarded the order of Lenin.  Todor Zhivkov was given this high award
 for outstanding services in the development of friendship and cooperation between the
 peoples of our countries and in the consolidation of peace and socialism. and for
 many years of active participation in the world communist movement.
 By creatively applying the teaching of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, and by interacting in
 an extensive and comprehensive manner and'strengthening their political and economio
 unity still further, the socialist countries are moving forward.  Our party ana state
 and the entire Soviet people are doing-everything to insure that they walk side by side,:
 as a united friendly family, helping each other, that the edifice of'fraternal coopera
 tion is bright and stable, and that an atmosphere of sincerity, cordiality,,and mutual"'
 and profound trust reign in it.
 Unity and cohesion multiply the forces of socialism.  The firmer this unity and the
 stronger and deeper the alliance and interaction of the world socialist system with
 the working class of the capitalist countries and the national liberation movement,
 the more effective its influence on the development of world history.

 December 1971
 KGB/GRU OPERATIONS ABROAD
 The Soviets' flagrant and clumsy abuse of their diplomatic
 privileges in England left the British authorities late last
 September no alternative to expelling 10S Soviets from the country.
 The Soviets were expelled for engaging in espionage and subversion
 as officers of the Soviet intelligence organizations known as the
 KGB and its military intelligence counterpart, the GRU.  The 105
 expellees represent about 20% of all Soviets posted to Britain.
 Although the British had twice warned the Soviet government to put
 an end to the activities of the KGB and GRU in England, the
 expulsions seem to have been precipitated by the revelations of
 Oleg Lyalin, a KGB officer in London who had defected a short
 time before.
 In mid-October, a similar case came to public attention in
 Belgium.  This, too, seems to have been precipitated by the
 defection and subsequent revelations of Anatoli Chebotarev, a
 high level officer in the GRU stationed in Belgium.  Chebotarev
 sought and found asylum in the United States.  Unlike the British,
 the Belgian authorities have revealed little of the case, but the
 Belgian press has ferreted out information which is proving
 reliable.  Out of some 120 Soviets stationed in Belgium under one
 cover another, Belgian newspapers confidently assert that from
 30-40 KGB or GRU officers, or more than 25% of the Soviet
 community there, have been implicated and will be expelled.  (As
 of this writing, ten have been identified; see list attached).
 The Belgian case is only the most recent in a growing number
 of instances where free' world governments have exposed Soviet
 subversion and espionage in their countries.  Still fresh in
 memory are the cases in the single year of 1971, which include
 subversion attempts in Mexico last March, in the Sudan and
 Ecuador in July, and espionage in the Congo, Ghana, and Italy.
 The recent British and Belgian cases are especially instructive
 in that they illustrate the massive scale of Soviet intelligence
 operations in the free world.  The two cases are instructive in
 a number of other ways as well, offering many insights into the
 real functions of the Soviet official representation in foreign
 countries, most particularly how this representation is used as
 a mechanism for hiding its primary mission of espionage and
 subversion.  Below are recounted some of the issues raised
 by the British and Belgian cases.
 The Soviet "Official" Representation in a Foreign Country
 Every Soviet abroad for a tour of duty or for an extended
 period is part of the official Soviet government representation,
 regardless of the organization or activity he purports to
 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300020001-1
 Approved Forl Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300020001-1
 represent.    ere is no such thing as a private  ovlet citizen
 living abroad for personal reasons (as is the case with tens of
 thousands of Westerners who reside abroad for private business
 reasons, for purposes of study, or merely for pleasure).
 Every Soviet citizen is abroad to accomplish a mission for the
 oo viet government.  These officials work for innumerable orgpn-
 izations, some of the more common of which are the Embassy,
 Consulates, Trade Missions, Aeroflot (the Soviet airline), press
 representatives, Inturist (tourist organization), various
 specialized Soviet export-import and other commercial organizations,
 and local "Friendship" societies.
 The Size of the Soviet Official Community Abroad
 Many, if not most, Soviet missions abroad are disproportion-
 ately large in comparison to the amount of legitimate diplomatic,
 trade, corrm~ercial, cultural etc. activity with which they are
 tasked.  The disproportion is accounted for by the large number
 of KGB and GRU personnel assigned to Soviet Embassies.  It is
 instructive, for example, to note that the total of 105 Soviet
 intelligence officers expelled from Britain exceeds the entire
 British official representation in Moscow.
 The Proportion of KGB/GRU in Official Missions
 In Britain, the 105 KGB/GRU officers expelled represented
 about 20% of the official Soviet mission, in Belgium, about 25%.
 But it should be remembered that there remain in each of the two
 countries a number of additional officers known to the authorities
 in the host countries as members of Soviet intelligence.  These
 officers will not be expelled for the time being.  Thus, the
 20-25% figure is merely a fraction of the total Soviet KGB/GRU
 personnel in each of the countries.  In addition to those members
 of the Soviet mission who are genuine officers of the KGB or GRU,
 an indefinite number of the Embassy personnel work for the KGB
 or GRU in addition to or instead of their nominal or real
 assignments.  Such persons are "co-opted" to work on intelligence
 tasks, determined by and under the control of the KGB or GRU.
 The famous Soviet GRU officer, Oleg Penkovsky, who was tried
 and shot in the Soviet Union in 1963 for smuggling secret information
 to the West, described this facet of Soviet intelligence operations
 as follows:
 "The proportion of KGB staff officers to the rest
 of Soviet embassy personnel is usually two men out of
 five.  GRU staff officers number one man in five.  There
 are generally fewer GRU men, but we must be counted separately
 because our 'neighbors' and we rarely work together. In
 most embassies it can be stated without error that 60 per
 cent of the embassy personnel are serving officers in
 intelligence, either KGB or GRU.  Obviously most of the other

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000300020001-1
 embassy employees are regularly co-opted for intelligence
 purposes."*
 Types of KGB/GRU Cover
 Soviet intelligence officers conceal their real missions by
 making a show of working in (i.e. under cover of) some legitimate
 capacity in the official Soviet cammunity.  Oleg Penkovsky gave a
 rather formidable list of cover organizations under which the
 KGB and GRU operated during his time.  The list will serve as an
 example of the variety and diversity of Soviet cover organizations
 used all over the world:
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 Byurobin (now the UPDK)--the office providing services for
 the Diplomatic Corps in Moscow
 Ministry of Foreign Trade
 Inturist (almost 100 per cent KGB, only a few GRU officers)
 All-Union "International Book" Association (almost 100 per
 cent KGB)
 All-Union Chamber of Commerce

 In short, there is no institution in the U.S.S.R. that does not have
 in it an intelligence officer or agent of either the GRU or KGB.
 Furthermore, the majority of the personnel in Soviet embassies
 abroad are KGB and GRU employees."*
 In light of the above, it would be well (as British businessmen
 are now doing) to act on the assumption that every member of the
 Soviet official community is a KGB/GRU officer (or co-optee)
 until convincing evidence to the contrary is forthcoming.
 Repercussions of Soviet Subversion Activity
 Soviet embassies and trade missions do have legitimate and
 non-intelligence functions, though their importance is apt to be
 small in comparison with the intelligence mission.
 One of the unfortunate consequences of these recent examples
 of Soviet abuse of the functions of official missions abroad is
 that it damages and undermines the necessary and useful interchange
 that is conducted between two nations via their foreign represent-
 atives.  Thus, Soviets abroad who actually have as their real
 missions the promotion of trade and exchange of goods, promoting
 cultural exchange, representing their government's political views,
 etc. etc, are understandably viewed with suspicion by foreign
 governments and by the population at large.  People who have dealings
 with Soviet diplomats and other officials are justified in questioning
 these same individuals' real work in the country.  And although
 the KGB and GRU exercise such power in Soviet embassies that
 little takes precedence over their espionage and subversion missions,
 the legitimate employees of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 (MFA) and of the Ministry of Foreign Trade (MIT) are understandably
 annoyed that they should be tarred with the KGB/GRU brush.  It is
 an open question whether MFA and MFT complaints will now or
 ultimately result in reducing the priority of the.;KGB'.s mission, abroad.
 An even more unfortunate consequence of the London and
 Belgian spy exposures, for the Soviets at least, is that the
 KGB/GRU's indiscreet operations carry the danger of vitiating
 the current Soviet detente campaign being pursued so assiduously
 in the worldwide travels of the top Soviet leaders.  (The spy
 scandals may indeed have contributed to French President Pompidou's
 firm refusal to consider a friendship treaty with the USSR, a treaty
 that Brezhnev was working very hard to achieve during his recent
 visit to France).  If the Brezhnev-Kosygin-Podgorny triumvirate
 of travelling salesmen either will not or cannot curb the sub-
 versive programs of their fellow Politburo member and KGB'Qhief,
 Yuri Andropov, there is good reason for the free world to
 question the good faith of Soviet detente policies.

 gence hierarchy, concluded that 3,000 of
 the approximately 5,200 Soviet repre-
 sentatives stationed abroad in 1961
 were professional intelligence officers.'
 This figure did not include employees,
 of the regular foreign service or of
 other non-intelligence agencies who
 were co-opted for intelligence work
 after having been recruited and sent
 abroad. Kaznacheez was such a regular
 diplomatic officer. He did not begin to
 work for Soviet intelligence until after
 he had already taken up a regular
 overseas assignment under the foreign
 ministry. In his case and in others like
 It, the co-opted officer remained on the
 regular foreign service payroll and re-
 ceived his promotions in the regular
 foreign service hierarchy, with appro-
 priate assistance from intelligence serv-
 ice headquarters in Moscow when
 needed.
 The general accuracy of these esti-
 mates of the size of the secret police
 presence in the regular diplomatic es-
 tablishment can scarcely he doubted.
 Nothing else could explain how numer-
 ous and how varied have been the dip-
 lomatic titles of Soviet embassy per-

 clandestine intelligence work by West-
 ern counter-espionage services. With

 associating freely with foreigners, and!
 so are cut off from access to essential
 non-secret information about condi
 tions in their country of assignment.
 The employees of the security services,,
 on the other hand, are encouraged to.
 roam about reasonabiy widely as a
 part of their Intelligence mission. Inev-
 itably, therefore, security service per-
 sonnel tend to be better informed than
 their regular diplomatic colleagues.
 The great lead which the collectors
 of clandestine intelligence have in pro-
 viding Moscow with foreign policy in-
 formation has this important conse-
 quence:.It makes the Soviet leadership
 depend for policy guidance on reports
 from the security services rather than
 from the regular diplomatic' hierarchy.
 The typical Soviet ambassador, there-
 fore, unless he be a man with the ex.
 ceptional professional expertise of Am-
 bassador Ivan Maiski in wartime Lon-
 don, is in no position to win the ear of
 his superiors, even were he inclined to
 look  at foreign matters differently
 from his nominal subordinates in the
 secret police. His political reporting,
 accordingly, can seldom be more than
 a pale reworking of such Intelligence
 material  as  his  surly  intelligence
 agency associates have allowed him to
 see.'
 The regular Soviet diplomat is also
 handicapped by his constant need, if
 he is to protect his career, to avoid in-
 curring the disapproval of the security
 hierarchy. Diplomats of all countries
 must occasionally guard against being
 thought excessively tolerant of foreign
 viewpoints, and Soviet diplomats more
 than most have reason to worry about
 such  suspicions.  In  Soviet  society,
 they can best protect themselves by es-
 pousing policy positions congenial to
 the institutional interests of the secret
 police.
 Such careerist considerations would
 be quite sufficient, for example, to ac-
 count for the notorious haste with
 which  Ambassador  Stepan  Chervo-
 nenko in Prague began to urge military
 intervention in Czechoslovakia when it
 became evident that the Czechoslovak
 party's reformers were beginning to
 move against Czechoslovak agents of
 the Soviet secret police. In Chervonen,-
 ko's case, an elementary careerist need.
 to take up a hostile attitude toward the
 Czechoslovak  deviation  must  have
 been particularly pressing, for Chervo-
 nenko could hardly have wished to
 have his Prague tour end as unsatisfac-.
 torily for the Soviet Union as had his
 The readiness of ambassadors, acting
 out of weak-minded regard for their
 own careers, to look to outside agen-
 cies for support and advancement is,.
 of course, no new thing in the Soviet
 service, as elsewhere. In the Soviet
 diplomatic service, however, this proc-
 ess has been taken one step further, by
 rewarding with ambassadorial assign,
 merits men who have had service in
 the intelligence apparatus. The new
 style Soviet amhassador is not just a
 man who can he counted on to per-
 form as the secret police hierarchy
 would wish; he may well be: a career
 intelligence officer. For there is strong
 reason to believe that a considerable
 minority of Soviet ambassadors are in'
 fact up-graded employees of the intelli-
 gence services rather than represents-.
 tives of the Ministry of Foreign Af-
 fairs.
 The best known example is Alek-
 sandr Paniushkin, who was Soviet am-
 bassador to Nationalist China from.
 1947 to 1952, and to Communist China
 from 1952 to 1953. Paniushkin's police
 connections were brought to light by
 Nikolai Khokhlov, an MVD agent sent
 out to assassinate a Russian emigre in
 West Germany in 1954. Khokhlov re-
 ceived the detailed instructions for his
 mission from Paniushkin at the secret
 police headquarters in Moscow. Sergei
 Kudryavtsev, who was Soviet ambassa-'
 dor i~ Havana in 1960, is another
 whose career, while nominally a suc-
 cession of regular diplomatic and for-
 eign ministry assignments, was proba=
 hly always with the intelligence serv-
 ices. Kudryavtsev helped set up one of
 the early spy rings uncovered in Can-
 ada with the defection of Igor Gouz.-
 enko from the Soviet embassy in Ot-
 tawa.
 For Little Gain
 I' is COMMONLY argued  in  non-
 Communist  countries                                                                  that   the
 intensive intelligence effort carried on
 by personnel assigned In Sovietcliplo-
 matic missions, though here and there
 overdone or done clumsily, has at any
 rate permitted the Soviet leadership to
 foresee the political future With. more
 confidence than their Western coun-
 terparts. In fact, however, this. is far
 from being the case.  The historical
 record suggests rather that Soviet in-
 telligence can have been little more
 successful than western in providing
 advance information on developments
 of political importance.
 For all their  massive  investment
 by. surprise qu.it.e as often as their
 Western rivals.  They did not expect
 that Nkrumah would be overthrown in
 Ghana or that Sukarno would fall from,
 power so quickly in Indonesia. They
 did not believe that Syria would break
 away from the United Arab Republic
 or that Israel would defeat Egypt.
 They did not foresee that the United.
 States would learn of the missiles In
 Cuba or would react to them as It did.
 They did not anticipate the June, 1953,
 uprising in East Berlin-Khokhlovf re-
 ported that the Central Committee or-
 dered a high-level, CIA-style post rmor-
 tem to find out why the MVD had
 known so little of what was going on in
 East Germany-and they have been no
 better informed about important devel-
 opments elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
 Yet in all. of these countries the Sovi-
 ets had large and expensive Intelli-
 gence collection programs and in some
 of them they even controlled the local
 intelligence apparatuses.
 Spectacular instances of Soviet suc-
 cesses in the recruitment of well-in-
 formed officials of other countries-of
 Alger hiss from the State Department,
 of Burgess and MacLean from the Brit.
 ish Foreign. Office, or of Philby from
 the British Secret Service-seems not
 to have saved the Soviets from politi-
 cal surprises.  The use which the Sovi-
 ets have been able to make of informa-
 tion  from such Informants appears
 most likely to have been limited to
 scoring points over Western intelli-
 gence agencies.
 Philby is said to have given away an
 Anglo-American intelligence operation
 against Albania. This was no douut an
 inconvenience for the Western intelli-
 gence  organizations  involved,  and
 worse still for the operatives sent to
 Albania, but the Soviet coup in un-
 covering  the  operation  w a s     not
 very profitable for the Soviet Union.
 Nor  wen Its failure any national
 hardship for Britain and the United
 States. Albania has gone its own way,
 as it would have anyway, and this is,
 pretty much what can he said of all of
 the causes and controversies In which
 knowledgeable officials turn out to
 have worked for the other side. As for
 the recruitment of Alger Hiss, the most
 that can be said for it from the Soviet
 side is that this particular espionage
 effort perhaps helped put the Demo-
 crats out of office in 1952 and, in the
 end, made Richard Nixon President in
 1968

 satisfactory is less certain. For in the
 evaluation of political probabilities, a
 bureaucratically organized intelligence
 organization, with even the best-placed
 agents, is still an unsatisfactory substi-
 tute for the judgment of the shrewd in-
 dividual observer who is intellectually
 Independent of the institution or or-
 ganization he serves. And it has been
 the misfortune of the Soviet diplomatic
 service that its upside-down internal
 organization almost guarantees that
 there will be a lack of such Indispen-
 sable, disinterested and objective ob.
 servers.
 The present generation of Soviet
 leaders presumably does not consider
 the absence of such observers to be a
 weakness  of  the  Soviet diplomatic
 service. In their operational concep-
 tions of the nature of the diplomatic
 profession, the prosperity of the Intel-'
 licence organizations h is s priority
 over the uncomfortabe and unflatter-
 ing kind of reports they might receive
 from old-fashioned kinds of diplomats.
 Khrushchev, it may be, saw the con-
 ventional and orthodox servility of his
 foreign affairs apparatus as a defi-
 ciency, for he made no secret of his
 scorn for Gromyko: If he were to ask
 his foreign minister to take off his
 trousers and sit on a block of ice, Gro?
 myko would have to comply, Khru-
 shchev remarked to Prime Minister
 Macmillan in Moscow in 1959.  But
 Khrushchev's successors are more com-
 fortable with the foreign affairs appa-
 ratus they inherited from ther prede-
 cessor. For them, the claims of the or-
 affairs establishment and of the Intel-
 ligence  cadres  who  constitute  the
 priesthood of this state church are ac-
 cepted without challenge.
 To compare Soviet intelligence
 with the priesthood of a secret re-
 ligious cult, a new kind of voodooism,
 is not at all far-fetched, for ritualized
 behavior of the professional intelli-
 gence officer has much In common
 with jungle magic..The intelligence of-
 ficer uses another name than his own,
 has a peculiar and stylized manner of
 communication with his fellows, and
 generally is obligated to conduct him-
 self in accord with a set of formal rules
 having little relation to the actual
 needs of the larger society which sup-
 ports him.
 When the MVD rezident at Rangoon
 decided that he needed to have Kazna/
 cheev translate stolen Burmese docu-
 merits for him, Kaznacheev was not
 told of the new assignment until he'd
 been called to come to a Moscow hotel
 room for an interview. And when he
 returned to Rangoon, it was explained,
 he was not to mention the matter to
 anyone, but to wait until some un-
 named person (who of course was the
 rezidert whom he'd known all" along)
 addressed him with the words, "Greet-
 ings from Peter." Kaznacheev was to
 answer, "Do you know him?", after
 which he could go to work making his
 translations. The hocus pocus of pro-
 fessional intelligence has thus added a
 new dimension of absurdity to the prac-~
 tice of foreign affairs,'much surpassing

 BRITAIN:
 The damage done to the effective op-'
 eration of the Soviet diplomatic mis-
 sion by this childish internal rigamo
 role is trivial enough, however, when
 compared with the harm done to So-
 viet Interests by Russian preoccupa-
 tion with the game of intelligence. Al-
 ienation of foreigners who might be
 friends of the Soviet Union by the
 clumsy and crude methods of Soyiet
 intelligence is perhaps not counted-I1s
 a loss in the Soviet calculus of costs,
 but an immense loss it nonetheless
 surely is. For any observer with experi-
 ence in these matters who is not pro.
 fessionally committed to the aggran-
 dizement of the intelligence profession
 knows very well that authentic infor-
 mation  about  other  countries-or,
 what is more important than detailed
 information, an accurate insight into
 the dynamics of the foreign govern-
 ment and society-is far more easily
 come by in frank and open exchanges
 of opinion with foreigners than In the
 furtive meetings favored by Soviet in.
 telligence professionals. And it is just
 this Soviet preference for secret police
 methods which makes it so difficult for,
 the bearers of Soviet diplomatic pass-
 port$ to acquire this essential under-
 standing of the ways of other. coun-
 tries.
 It is unlikely that the present Soviet
 leadership will learn anything from
 the mischief done by its operatives in
 London. It is not too late, on the other
 hand, for the managers of U.S. foreign
 policy to put a brake on the empire-

 WORLD CAPITALS
 Britain's crackdown on 105 Russian
 spies in late September was the biggest
 single strike ever made against Soviet
 espionage  agents-but it exposed only
 the tip of a massive iceberg.
 Western  intelligence authorities re-
 port that thousands of other Soviet "dip-

 spy missions.
 Top French security officers believe
 that 50 per cent of all 1,000 Communist-
 bloc representatives in Paris are espi-
 onage agents. Over the past eight years,
 France has tried 58 spy cases, 45 involv-

 Officials of West Germany estimate
 that 10,000 Communist informants are

 When 105 Soviet nationals,  all of them with more or less

 trade delegation in London.   What he has to tell the British ser-
 vices may w'Ji trigger quite a bit of agitation across the West-
 ern European espionage chessboard for some time to come.   In the
 view of the experts, though, the coverage of the British Isles by
 spies coming in from the cold is a long way from being disturbed
 by this super-sweep.   First, because there is every reason to
 believe that Moscow had more than twice that many agents on the
 job, and second, because in addition to the Russian spies proper,
 you have to reckon -- and very seriously -- with their Czechoslo-
 vak, Romanian, Polish, Hungarian, and Bulgarian colleagues.
 Two out of Five Are Spies
 The generally held opinion in Western counter-espionage
 circles is that one of every two Soviet citizens strolling the
 streets of our capitals is an intelligence agent on a mission.
 But this does not in any way mean that a Soviet national who is
 not officially a spy would hesitate to inform the USSR of what-
 ever he learns, discovers, and sees in those Western European
 circles where spies find it easier to gain admittance if they be-
 long to the sacrosanct ranks of the press, or tourism, or business.
 The rules of reciprocity require that Soviet diplomats request

 are posted in the West;   but these rules do not apply to spies
 whose cover is the press, tourism, or business.
 In Belgium right now, there are 113 Soviet officials, 45
 of them working in the privileged area of the embassy and 33 in
 the commercial representation.   It is not a very daring guess to
 say that a good 50 of these are full-time spies.   The others oc-
 casionally come up with some usefi25X h1~Obf      1r=Wkon.
 Turning-Point in History
 Whenever you meet two Russians, you are talking with at least
 one spy:    this axiom holds for the 45 comrades who live in the em-
 bassy and the Avenue de Fre, the 33 who serve on the trade delega-
 tion, the 11 attached to press offices, tourist bureaux, and air,.
 lines, and the 24 experts in the ways of mixed-economy corpora-
 tions.   This, in terms of numbers, is the official Soviet delega-
 tion on the job here ;..n Belgium, side by side with another 172 of-
 ficials from the other Eastern countries.   This representation has
 greatly expanded since 1967, when, although the staffs of the em-
 bassy and the economic mission were just about the same as they
 are today (42 and 30, respectively), the number of journalists,
 Intourist and Aeroflot agents was a great deal smaller (4 in 1967
 as compared with 11 today).   In those days there was a lot less
 Russian spoken in the mixed-economy companies (10 as against 24
 Russian-speaking personnel).'  So 1967 was a turning-point in the
 history of tie Soviet representation in Belgium.   The proof:   in
 1960, the staff strength at the embassy, the commercial offices,
 and the press office was 16, 25, and 2, respectively.  At that
 time there were no mixed corporations, and it is interesting to
 note that the official USSR delegation to Britain in those days
 amounted to 249 souls.
 Like Icebergs
 In the course of the last 10 years,   a number of espionage
 cases involving Soviet residents have come to public attention.
 This of course does not mean that the official published statis-
 tics account for all the spies our counter-espionage services
 have unmasked.   From 1960 to 1971, London expelled 27 Soviet
 nationals on charges of spying.  Here in Belgium, seven spies met
 the same fate.   They were:  Vladimir Cheretuni (of Aeroflot) who
 took too keen an interest in the Belgian army's affairs;   Anatoli
 Trifonovich Oborodnikov, a newsman with Tass; Vitali Dimitriy'eiich
 Balachov, second secretary at the embassy; Oleg Alekseyevich
 Semikov, a film expert who was caught red-handed on SHAPE grounds;
 Aleksandr Selikh, and Anatoli Kassolapov, who were deeply involved
 in a ring of "illegals" (agents who had no legitimate cover), all

 1970 was a commercial engineer with the Scaldia-Volga corporation.
 His sales area had a little tiny bit to do with trucks and a whole
 lot to do with SHAPE and our national defense.  The fact that no
 expulsion action was taken against Russian officials prior to
 1967 in no way indicates that the counter-espionage services
 had been indifferent to Soviet espionage activities in the years
 before NATO and SHAPE.   We might say that, at that time, these
 agencies-were just keeping a close and quiet eye on the [Russian]
 networks, and carefully refraining from anything that might up-
 set them, pending a broader sweep with far more important results.
 Besides, in the battle of the special services, the visible
 part -- like the tips of icebergs -- is the least;   the main part
 is underwater, invisible.
 Ahead of Paris and Bonn
 As you can well imagine, the way these intelligence people
 go about their business bears no resemblance -- in style or in
 resources -- to the doings of James Bond and his thriller peers.
 Intelligence of a military nature, if indeed it still interests
 their government, is no longer in the top rank of their concerns
 and quests.   it is still the exclusive domain of the GRU, which
 is the intelligence arm of the Red Army.  But intelligence and in-
 formation relating to industry or economics or politics are the
 choice tidbits that bring the big money to the KGB agents.   Before
 NATO moved into our country, estimates placed the number of men
 these two agencies had on mission at a round thirty or so officers
 among the 80 or so Soviet officials installed in Belgium.   It is
 a fair estimate today that there are at least twice as many.
 Their missions have to do primarily, of course, with the "areas"
 of SHAPE, NATO, and the Common Market.  This three-fold top-rank
 target explains why the post of ambassador to Brussels is consi-
 dered in Moscow as the most important in Western Europe, even ahead
 of Paris and Bonn.
 The fact is that the kind of espionage that marked the '40s
 is practically a thing of the past.   The whole concept has set,
 along with that of the cold war itself.   Since the planning now
 is for total war, espionage has grown and adapted to the new re-
 quirements.  Becoming an intensive, everyday operation, it looks
 into everything that might, in case of a conflict, ensure a people's
 survival, and from there into whatever enables that same people
 to live in time of peace.  This explains why espionage has been
 taken out of the hands of the military little by little, as its
 objectives gradually broadened into the areas of politics, econo-
 mics, industry, science, and sociology.

 It is just as important now to build up a construct of chaos,
 bit by bit, wl i_ch will maY:e it pU/.~siale to wipe the enemy out in
 a hidden, underground, but irreversible way.   This is psycholo-
 gical warfare in all its intensity and all its refinement.   The
 idea, to take just one of a hundred possible examples, is to in-
 filtrate demonstrations and protest marches  and, if need be, to
 provoke them in order to manipulate them more neatly in the de-
 sired direction.   This is why the facets of current-day espionage
 are almost innumerable.   It has become a subtle art, in which
 those great chess-players, the Russians, have had two generations
 to become past masters.   Their basic resources are the greed or
 vulnerability of their partners, the informers whose number the
 experts put at 10,000 in France.   On that basis, there ought to
 be between 1,500 and 2,000 of them here in Belgium.   They are
 generally in it because spying pays, or because they are being
 'blackmailed.   In the hands of the "legal" agents -- the diplomats,
 newsmen, officials, or export-import advisers -- they constitute
 an invisible network, but one which is both sturdy and effective.
 But we should have no illusions about these people:   agents are
 almost never recruited from the gutter or from the disinherited
 classes of the society.   The spymasters bar no class or stratum,
 so long as the would-be agent has access to information.   They
 are among us right now.   They are pleasant company, good listeners.
 They are eager to tap their business and personal relationships
 for information to be sent off to Moscow through their handler,
 whose only professional risk consists in perhaps having to pack
 his bags in a great hurry some fine morning, like his comrades
 Yuri Khozhayev, the film exporter, and Victor Karyagin, the cul-
 tural attache, both of whom were swept out of England with the
 other 103 undesirables.  After that, he will simply have to l.ie
 low till the time comes to pop up to the surface again,' somewhere
 else in the world.
 1967 - Vladimir Cheretuni - 35, deputy head of the Brussels office
 of Aeroflot (the Soviet airline), was arrested 25 January -:967
 at Hever just after he had taken delivery of documents cor.-taining
 military matter.   The Soviet agent's special assignment was a
 double one:   to get into the military control tower at Yelsbroak,
 and to open a cafe near the NATO installation at Evere designed
 to attract the patronage of personnel from NATO.   Cheretun  was
 neutralized before he could complete this assignment, and left
 Belgium on 3 February 1967.
 1967 - Aleksandr Selikh, Anatoli Ko.ssolapov    Selikh was the re-
 presentative of SOVFLOT in Belgium, and Kossolapov the Baltic Line
 delegate here.   On two occasions, they received the "illegal"

 top spy.  Had he not been taught by the great Russian master spy,
 Rudolf Abel?  Loginov's first trip occurred in 1964.  He landed
 from the Soviet ship    azin at Antwerp, posing as an ordinary
 seaman, and took rooms at the Hotel IJetropole in Brussels.   The
 second time, in December 1966, he landed again at Antwerp from
 the Soviet cargo ship Kamensk.   Selikh and Kossolapov put him up
 in Brussels in a quiet, out-of-the-way room.  When  ,oginov was
 neutralized in September 1967, Selikh and Kossolapov, their covers
 burnt, had to leave Belgium.
 1967 - Ogorodnikov - Balachov, Semikov   Anatoli Trifonovich
 Ogorodnikov headed the Tass news agency's Brussels bureau, and
 was known to the Belgian press corps as a very fine, very polite
 fellow.  Neutralized on 18 April 1967, near his residence at 85
 Rue General Lodz in Uccle.  While he was being held in Saint Gills
 prison pending expulsion, the USSR embassy in Brussels denounced
 his arrest as "an illegal provocation."  Two other Soviet nationals
 were taken with Ogorodnikov:  Vitali Dimitriyevich Balachov (whose
 come-over agent, Madame X, said of him: "He looks like a pig, he
 eats like a pig, and he behaves like a pig,"), third secretary in
 the Soviet embassy at Brussels, and Oleg Alekseyevich Semikov,
 commercial attache for the Soveksportfilm Company, she same that
 imported the Russian version of War and Peace to Belgium.
 Balachov left Belgium 2 May 1967 for a "vacation" from which he
 has yet to return.   The three Soviet agents were to work on "madame
 X," an embassy employee upon whom they hung that sobriquet, and
 who had been posted first to Turkey (where they had recruited her)
 and then to Brussels.   Ogorodnikov was the only one arrested, but
 the other two felt the heat of burning covers and quickly ?aft
 Belgium.  The Soviet target in this particular affair was SHAPE.
 1970 - Savich   Boris Savich, rharried and father of two sons, was
 born in Zhitomir (Ukraine) in 1934, and came to Belgium in October
 1967.  he lived at 56-68 Avenue de la Woluwe in Diegem.   Officially
 he was a specialized engineer, in charge of sales for the Scaldia-
 Volga truck firm.  His real job was espionage, and his inte ec-.s
 centered on Belgian military bases (including Florennes) and on
 SHAPE-NATO 9including its base at Baronville).  More specifically,

 Import - Export
 Espionage in Lace
 When two Soviets, comrades Oleg Ivanovich Gluchenko (34 years
 old, with an 11-year-old daughter) and Yuri Yefimovich Parfenov
 (40 years old, with a 17-year-old daughter), who were employed by
 the Brussels office of Aeroflot (Soviet air transportation company),
 left Belgium at the beginning of last week - having been made the
 subject of expulsion measures because of the revelations made by
 'Rhebotarev - a third Soviet, Konstantin I. Leontiev, was forbidden
 to reside in this country.  Officially, Leontiev was the commercial
 director of the Belgo-Soviet import-export firm of Belso.  Leontiev,
 by the way, is not an ordinary person.  Likehebotarev, he too is a
 high-ranking GRU officer, with one difference:  he was superior to
 the defector T:hebotarev.
 The cover which Leontiev had chosen - that of a businessman,
 the manager of Belso - made his work as an intelligence officer easy.
 In that way he benefited from complete freedom of movement, which is
 useful for any operational spy.  Such covers are becoming more and
 more commonplace.  It is worth mentioning that there are four com-
 panies of this "mixed" type in Belgium at present, including Belso
 and Scaldia Volga.  For the latter two, the mask has been ripped
 away.

 A proved  execut ve in a  ego- ov
 to his Soviet colleague over certain commercial policies which had
 been employed, and received the following answer:
 "We don't establish ourselves in Belgium in order to make a
 profit."
 Does this attitude also apply to Belso?  The statement of profit
 and loss for that company's 1970 operations reveals a net profit of
 135,621 francs (1969: 159,209 francs) for general expenditures of
 29,711,753 francs (1969: 22,903,621 francs), does it not?
 Since the disappearance, on 3 October 1971, of Anatolij Tchebotarev
 from the Soviet trade representation offices in Brussels, some people
 have seen a similarity between that affair and that in London, where
 Oleg Lyalin was the principal actor.  Oleg Lyalin, whose ostensible
 job consisted of selling feminine clothing - "babydolls", articles
 made of nylon and assorted negliges - for the Rasno firm, an Anglo-
 Soviet import-export company, was - secretly - the brain of the Soviet
 sabotage network in Great Britain.
 Konstantin Doesn't Answer Any More
 We now know that Anatolij Tchebotarev was not the equivalent
 in the hierarchy of the GRU in Belgium, of Oleg Lyalin, but that in
 reality that position was occupied by Konstantin I. Leontiev, the
 commercial director of the Belgo-Soviet import-export company Belso,
 the Belgian equivalent of Rasno.  We also know that, in addition to
 his official position, Leontiev was a colonel in the GRU (Soviet
 military intelligence service) and that he also worked under the
 cover of a buyer of textiles destined to be sold eventually in the
 Soviet Union.                                                         r
 Leontiev was born on 19 December 1921 - so he is 50 years old -
 and he previously held a position in Belgium from July 1957 to
 December 1963 as an engineer with the Soviet trade representation.
 He returned to this country in late 1969, and he and his wife - his
 two children (Olga, 14 years old, and Vladimir, 18 years old) remained
 in Moscow - occupied a luxurious apartment in the Pacific apartment
 building on rue Scaiquin, at Saint-Josse-Ten-Noode.
 When the gendarmes went to Belso last week to inform him of the
 .expulsion order to which he was being made subject, Leontiev had al-
 ready left Belgium.  He had left for Moscow.  However, he is forbidden
 to reside in this country, nevertheless.
 In the official portion of the work he did here, the Soviet
 colonel organized exhibitions and style shows on a number of occasions
 which were for the purpose of familiarizing the Belgian public with
 the Soviet products which are sold, more particularly, in the "Maison
 de Russie" (House of Russia), whose salesrooms are located on the
 ground floor of the Tour Madou (Madou Tower) in Brussels.  The "Maison
 de Russie" is also the retail outlet for products imported into Belgium
 by Belso.  This import-export company, with a capital of 10 million

 Belgian francs, is a Belgo-Soviet commercial firm founded on 4 May
 1966, with central offices at 31 chaussee de Gand, Molenbeek-Saint-
 Jean., which location it then left, moving to 1-2, avenue des-Arts,
 Brussels.
 Le Charme Slave (Slavic Charm)
 The business interest of the firm is principally the import-export
 business and the sale of Soviet products at retail.  Among the products
 it offers are samovars, porcelain from Leningrad, watches, radios, cameras,
 folk costumes, typically Soviet food and drink (vodka) specialities and fur
 coats made of furs of Soviet origin but styled by Italian and French
 specialists in order to make them more competitive with the products of
 the Belgian furriers.  The colonel, incidentally, was very proud of these
 fur coats, and he recently had four good-looking Soviet mannequins make
 the trip from Moscow to Brussels to present the winter collection.  A
 Brussels newspaper did not hesitate to entitle that occasion "Le Charme
 Slave" [Slavic Charm].  The four girls were natives of Riga, or at least
 that is what was said at the time.  Did the man who was responsible
 for "Slavic Charm" - like Lyalin in England - run a sabotage network in
 Belgium?  This is a question which may well be asked.
 In addition to the "Maison de Russie" in Brussels, Belso also
 operates a similar establishment in Anvers [Antwerp] which is called
 "Kalinka".  This branch was opened this year.
 Soviet government organizations hold 50% of the stock of Belso.
 They are the following:
 Vneshposyltorg, which sells a considerable range of manufactured
 products and Soviet food products at wholesale in small amounts, and it
 also sells orders for admission to nursing homes and rest homes in the
 USSR to foreigners on behalf of their relatives living in the USSR
 (address:  32/34 Smolenskaya-Sennaya, Moscow).
 Prodintorg, which, more particularly, exports food products (address:
 32/34 Smolenskaya-Sennaya, Moscow).
 Vostokintorg, which normally is an organization specializing in
 -import-export trade with the People's Republic of Mongolia, Afghanistan,
 Iran, Aden, Turkey and Yemen (address:  32/34 Smolenskaya-Sennaya, Moscow).
 It should be mentioned that a former engineer with the trade repre-
 sentation in Brussels, Mr. Yuri Straborovski, and the former director of
 Scaldia Volga, Mr. Vladimir Cherkasov, each own a share.
 The remaining 50% are owned by Belgians.  When the company was
 founded, the part of the capital in the hands of Belgians was represented
 by two Greeks and three Belgians (two of whom have since died).  The
 administrative council of the company at present is made up of five people:
 Anatoli Bobrik, Youri Kostrov,.Vladimir Kovalchuk and Konstantin Leontiev, all
 four of whom are Soviets, and one Belgian, Louis Loncin, former director

 Commerce exterieur  -  OBCE].  The committee members [commissaires] of
 the firm"are Dimitri Muratov, a Soviet from Moscow, and Henry Pirlet, a
 Belgian.
 As for Rasno, that company, the English equivalent of Belso, was
 established in 1969, with its creation being announced at a cocktail
 party given by the Embassy of the USSR in London.  The firm comes under
 the Soviet Department of Trade and Industry, which provides it with
 a capital of 5,000 pounds.  Thus, Rasno in London is entirely in the
 hands of Rasno, Moscow, a governmental commercial agency.  The last
 reports on the company presented in July 1971 reveal that three of the
 four directors are Soviets, that its capital reached'40,000 pounds in
 1970 with a profit of 8,326 pounds, taxes not deducted.  Oleg Lyalin
 was said to be one of the directors of the company.  One of the three
 Soviet directors of Rasno - he received 4,000 pounds per year - left
 the United Kingdom when the Lyalin affair was made public, and he did
 so in spite of the work which had been done very recently in his house
 on Makepeace Avenue in Highgate... Serge MONIER

 These Russians were on the list (much longer still) of Soviet

 Nine Soviet Spies Expelled from Belgium After the Revelations of
 Tchebotarev
 There will be some absentees from the big reception being given
 this evening at the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
 (66 Avenue De Fre in Uccle-Brussels) on the occasion of the anniversary
 of the October Revolution.  Nine Soviets (La Meuse - La Lanterne is
 able to disclose eight names today) have been expelled from Belgium
 as a result of the Tchebotarev affair:  two employees of Aeroflot,
 a director of the Belgian-Soviet Commercial Company ("La Maison de
 Russie" in Brussels and "Kalinka" in Antwerp), three emmbers of the
 Soviet trade mission (former colleagues of the defector Tchebotarev,
 two diplomats, and the representative of an important photographic
 products firm.  Other departures are expected within the next few days.
 Two employees of the Brussels agency of Aeroflot (the Soviet
 airline company) left Brussels-National--very discreetly-on Tuesday,
 26 October, on board a Tupolev aircraft of Aeroflot, bound for Moscow.
 They were thus the first Soviets hit by an expulsion measure taken by
 the Belgian authorities.  They were Oleg Ivanovich Gluchenko (34) and
 Yuri Yefimovich Parfenov (40).
 During the same week, a third Soviet--Colonel Konstantin
 Leontiev of the GRU (military intelligence service), a director
 of the "Societe commerciale belgo-sovietique, S.A.", or "BelsoSi
 for short (1-2 Avenue des Arts in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode) since
 20 May 1970--was forbidden to remain in our country.  The police-
 men assigned the duty of notifying Leontiev of his expulsion
 could not find him; he had already left Belgium.
 At the end of the week, five more Soviets returned to the
 USSR, thus lengthening the list of "undesirables".  They are:
 - Anatoly Mashine, attache of the trade mission;
 - Vladimir Krugliakov, delegate of "Sovflot" in
 the trade mission;
 - Aleksey Sereda, Embassy attache;
 - Boris Trichine, attache of the trade mission;
 - Valentin Zaitsev, counselor in the Embassy.
 In addition to these five Soviets and Parfenov, Gluchenko,
 and Leontiev, a ninth Soviet has also left Belgium.  He was a
 commercial delegate in an important firm specializing in photo-
 graphic products.

 "To see" and,"to see again"
 Thus the Soviet espionage strength in Belgium has been reduced
 by nine operational units.  Now Tchebotarev turned over to the
 American security services a definitely longer list of names of
 Soviet spies.  Thirty-three of them are of direct concern to Belgium.
 Therefore, there are still two dozen intelligence specialists sta-
 tioned in our country.  This evening they will. undoubtedly be at the
 Embassy of the USSR in Brussels, where many Belgians and foreigners
 have been invited.
 These are "selected" Belgians and foreigners, since the list
 of guests is always drawn up jointly by the chief of protocpl of
 the Embassy and the GRU and KGB "residents" (this is confirmed by
 all intelligence officers who have sought asylum in the West).
 The list of persons "to see" and perhaps "to see again", which
 each Soviet intelligence officer keeps memorized for such occasions,
 will be lengthened by several names.  That is all.  But the process
 will remain the same.  Spies have their traditions, and they stick
 to them.
 The departure of the nine Soviets from Belgium was prepared,
 it seems, by several actions undertaken by G. Korinfski, second
 secretary of the Embassy of the USSR.  These actions had taken the
 diplomat to several Brussels firms specializing in packing and
 baggage, particularly near the port of Brussels.  Moreover, he had
 not concealed the fact that he was a diplomat nor his intention of
 obtaining used crates at a good price.
 He pushed his car
 Shortly thereafter, Parfenov and Gluchenko left Belgium.
 Parfenov had attracted the attention of his neighbors by maneuvers
 which were "too discreet".  He would regularly leave his lodgings
 around 0500 hours and push his car for several tens of meters
 before starting it.   It is doubted that the purpose of this maneu-
 ver was to avoid disturbing the sleep of his wife.
 The measures of expulsion taken against the nine Soviets show
 the importance of mixed companies, tourist agencies, press agencies,
 and travel agencies for Soviet espionage,. which seems to prefer them
 for its cover.  Do not such activities permit their members complete
 freedom of movement?  For example, the personnel of Aeroflot claim
 both commercial status and semidiplomatic status, because they be-
 long to a government company.  There are many cases in which an
 Aeroflot employee crosses over into the privileged domain of diplo-
 macy and vice versa.
 The Soviets do not hesitate to assign to a diplomatic post one
 of their intelligence officers who has been previously compromised
 elsewhere.  This was the case with Konstantin Alekseyevich Aksenov,
 second secretary at the Embassy of the USSR in Brussels from 1952
 to 1955, who had to leave that post because of the discovery-of one

 infiltration of circles of anti-Communist Russian exiles.  The
 affair created a big stir at the time.  Nevertheless, the same
 Aksenov turned up as chief of Aeroflot in Morocco, where, from his
 office in Rabat, he applied himself to collecting information con-
 cerning American economic and military cooperation.
 "Lightning promotion"
 In Ceylon, Yan Akimovitch Grechko, in addition to his clandes-
 tine activities, was noticed because of his promotion which can be
 characterized as lightning-like--an ordinary commercial employee,
 he became overnight the first secretary of the Embassy of the USSR
 in Ceylon.
 It should be added that Grechko was a colonel in intelligence
 and that in 1950 he had been military attache of the USSR in People's
 China.
 This is not the first time in Belgium that an Aeroflot employee
 has been involved in an espionage affair.  In 1967 there was the
 Cheretoune affair, named after the deputy chief of the Brussels
 office of Aeroflot, who was caught when he was about to receive
 intelligence of military interest from his "contact".   .
 In 1969 did not Konstantin Parfenov, who was then chief of the
 Soviet trade mission in Brussels, declare that, among the fundamen-
 tal principles of Soviet trade policy in Belgium, respect for the
 sovereignty of the host state was in first place?
 A few weeks later, a Soviet engineer of "Scaldia-Volga" was
 expelled.  He was a spy;      1                                   i

 On the roof
 On 3 October, Anatoliy Tchebotarev (38), counselor in the Soviet
 trade mission in Brussels and field-grade officer of the GRU, disap-
 peared.                            Trace of him was lost for several days.  The Belgian author-
 ities state that Tchebotarev has not asked to enjoy the right of
 asylum.    In fact, he is in the United States, where he is talking
 very rapidly, denouncing his KGB and GRU colleagues whom he knew not
 only in Belgium from 1968 (when he arrived in our country) to 1971,
 but also those whom he knew throughout his entire career as a spy.
 Tchebotarev had the clandestine mission in Brussels of listening
 to NATO radio communications.  The antenna of his interception system
 is concealed in a small on the roof of the USSR trade mission, Boule-
 vard du Regent, and not on the roof of the "Scaldia-Volga" firm,
 where there also are antennas.

 The list of Soviets who have departed Belgium as a result of the
 Tchebotarev affair (Attache at the commercial representation who last
 3 October chose to defect to the West) has lengthened by six since we
 announced last week the "discreet" departure of three Soviet intelligence
 officers, the Comrades Oleg Ivanovitch Gluchenko (born 12 February 1937)
 and Yuri Yefimovitch Parfenov (born 2 May 1931), both employees of
 Aeroflot, and of Konstantin I. Leontiev (born 9 December 1921), Commercial
 Director of the Belgo-Soviet Import-Export Company Belso.
 These departures have in effect been followed by those of six; other
 Soviets:  one counsellor for scientific and technical questions at the
 Soviet Embassy (Valentin Zaitsev), one attache of the same embassy
 (Aleksei Sereda), one Sovflot representative attached to the commercial
 representation (Anatoliy Mashine and Boris Trichine) and one Soviet
 working as a commercial representative in an important firm producing
 photographic products.
 The strength of Soviet espionage in Belgium has been reduced by nine
 operational units, an appreciable reduction, but in reality clearly
 inadequate when one knows that there remain in our country twenty Soviet
 intelligence specialists directly compromised by the Tchebotarev affair.
 It is however probable -- according to some sources -- that in the
 next few days new departures from among the official Soviet representation
 in Belgium will be announced.  The nine departures for Moscow represent
 only a prologue to a series of departures either more important in number
 or directed at more important personalities.
 The number of Tovariches assigned to Brussels as of this date is
 102 (Tchebotarev and Volkov have been subtracted) -- 43 members of the
 Embassy, 29 from the commercial representation, 8 from the press, travel
 and airlines (two from Aeroflot), one intourist, one Tass, two Novosti,
 one Isvestia and one Pravda, 22 in the mixed firms (Scaldia Volga and Belso).

 A few months ago, a high-level British functionary  summarized in
 four points the precautions needed to limit the loss of industrial
 secrets during Soviet-British encounters.
 1)  All Soviets visiting factories and business offices
 must be considered "a priori" as intelligence officers and
 only "a posteriori" as commercial agents.
 2)  The commercial secrets and the details of industrial
 procedures should be locked up whenever Soviet visitors are in
 the area.  One should not permit delegations to enter design
 departments where new models are being prepared.
 3)  During the negotiations and even after the signature
 of export contracts, the Soviets should not be authorized to
 inspect anything more than the indispensable minimum of the
 different stages of production.
 4)  The Directors of firms should avoid showing prototypes,
 even if there is a promise of purchase.
 This same high functionary noted also the large discrepancy
 which exists on the one hand between the number of members of a permanent
 commercial representation and on the other hand the number of members of
 visiting commercial delegations.  "I have always noticed;'he added,
 "that the size of this latter delegation is always larger."

 A RUSSIAN MASTER SPY IN PARIS
 by Philippe Bernert
 105 Soviet spies expelled from Great Britain, 40 Soviet spies
 counted in Belgium and threatened with expulsion.  Might
 France be spared this sort of pollution?  Because of the
 special relationship between Paris and Moscow, and in consider-
 ation of the forthcoming visit of Leonid Brezhnev, might the
 Kremlin have decided:  "None of that for our French friends?"
 We may even imagine -- it is pleasant to dream -- that the Russians
 send us from time to time, at the end of a very full and slightly faded
 career, one of those good secret agents who has grown old in his job.
 Not to spy on us -- oh no! -- but to reaccustom himself to a more pleasant
 way of life, to forget his job somewhat.

 Let's take a very precise case.  On 30 August 7  t e new permanen
 delegate of the Soviet Union to UNESCO arrived in Paris -- His Excellency
 Serge Mikhaylovich Kudryavtsev.  We say His Excellency because Kudryavtsev
 was the Soviet ambassador to Cuba and to Cambodia before being appointed
 to Paris, to this very restful job.
 His name won't tell you very much, of course.  Yet in Canada it still
 makes certain high officials grow pale with anger.  And in the "White
 Paper" published in 1946 by the Ottowa government to disclose part of the
 atomic espionage conducted by the Russians between 1942 and 1945, you
 would find the name of S. E. Kudryavtsev listed quite frequently.
 For in Canada where he started as first secretary of the embassy,
 Kudryavtsev was one of the leaders of Soviet espionage.  He established
 contacts with the well-known English physicist Allan Nunn May, who stole
 uranium for the Russians, gave them many related secrets, and was finally
 sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1947.
 The Cuban Missile Man
 At that time a defector broke up the Soviet spy network.  A code
 clerk of'the USSR embassy in Ottawa, Igor Guzenko, went to the west with
 his wife and a bag full of documents.  All the Russian agents were
 identified.  Kudryavtsev did not wait to be expelled.  His chiefs appointed
 him to the embassy in London, where he remained for several weeks, long
 enough to see how the issue was taking shape in Canada, then he went back
 home to Moscow.
 At that time Kudryavtsev was "exposed," as the spies put it.  But
 the Russians felt he was too valuable to be retired to a Moscow office.
 "Impossible, for the moment,ito appoint him to another of our embassies
 in the west," said his chiefs.  "He might be declared persona non grata.
 But there is a way of getting around this."
 This way around which, as you will see, was to be used again much later,
 was to infiltrate a secret agent like Kudryavtsev into an international
 organization -- the United Nations.  For there each delegation is free to
 bring members of its own choice.  The UN is very agreeable.  Even crammed
 full of spies, its rules forbid it from getting rid of them.
 So it was under U,N cover that the astonishing career of Serge Kudryavtsev
 was to continue.  The United Nations sent him to Greece on an investigation
 mission.  lie held a desirable place on the UN commission on the Balkans.
 Then during the second session of the UN General Assembly, he was seated at the
 side of the Soviet delegate, Andrey Gromyko.
 1:haL was already a bit much.      But   tneu1 tnC~..,~
 well known to all the western secret services became an ambassador.  Not
 just anywhere, you will note, but in a capital that could not reject him,
 even if he were the devil himself -- Havana.  That was the time when-Castro
 was totally under the thumb of the Russians, and couldn't refuse them
 anything.  They 'set him up against the United States, they promised Castro
 missiles, and without their economic aid, Castroism could not have survived.

 This means that the real boss in Cuba was Kudryavtsev.  He set up a
 solid KGB apparatus there, got Kennedy, the CIA,-and the anti-Castro people
 to fall::. into'the?Bay of Pigs trap, and organized the installation of
 -
 nuclear -missiles aimed at the heart of the United States. .-He-was an
 extremely rare case -- he was both the representative of the USSR and the
 chief of its spies.  Normally Moscow tries to separate the two types, and
 it is often the doorman, the driver, or a vague attache in the embassy who
 is actually the real boss.
 Kudryavtsev is this rare bird, capable of playing all roles.  A
 performance that he was to renew, starting.in 1967, in Cambodia, where he
 watched very closely the too unsteady Sihanouk. -As-ambassador and'KGB
 chief, Kudryavtsev then conducted, at the same time*as his rivals in the
 CIA, a subtle game aiming at dumping the pro-Chinese Sihanouk in favor of
 General Lon Not.
 This was successfully done.  Would Kudryavtsev then rest on his
 laurels?  25 years after the Ottawa affair, his chiefs decided to try an
 experiment, and to test the "short memory" of the west.
 "We are going to try to infiltrate Kudryavtsev again in a western
 capital.  London or Washington would still be too difficult.  But Paris
 seems perfect.  Especially if we appoint him as the head of a delegation
 of an international nature, like UNESCO, for example.  The Quai d'Orsay,
 which is a real stickler for its rules,.can only approve, since we have
 the right to choose whomever we want."
 This explains why, when Soviet agents have been having a bad time
 in the west, S.E. Kudryavtsev was able to get settled along the Seine.
 In his "Brussels Letter," an information sheet published monthly in the
 Belgian capital, and closely followed in NATO circles, my colleague
 Pierre de Villemarest mentions this incredible matter. The Belgians
 are astounded.  But in Paris no one seems aware of what is going on.
