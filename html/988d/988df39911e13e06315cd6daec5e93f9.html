KEY JUDGMENTS 
China has the full range of military forces befitting a major power: 
the largest standing army in the world; a small strategic nuclear strike 
force; a large coastal defense navy moving gradually toward the open 
ocean; and large and growing air and air defense forces. Nevertheless, 
China's military forces and defense establishment are severely handi-
capped by an outdated technological and industrial base, which pro-
duces weapon systems roughly a generation behind those of modern 
Western and Soviet forces. 
Chinese defense policy will continue to emphasize maintenance 
of conventional and nuclear forces sufficient to deter attack from any 
quarter, or to deny an attacker success in the event deterrence fails. 
We believe that, in the event of a Soviet counterforce nuclear attack,  
sufficient Chinese ballistic missiles would survive 
to deliver 
a small but destructive retaliatory strike. While we cannot be confident, 
we believe this constitutes a credible deterrent to a Soviet attack. Fur-
thermore, we estimate that Chinese general purpose forces have !w-
imps an even chance of stalemating a conventional Soviet invasion 
somewhere short of Beijing. We believe, however, that the Chinese 
would probably be unable to halt a large-scale Soviet invasion supported 
by extensive use of nuclear weapons. 
China views Vietnam both as a surrogate for Moscow in Southeast 
Asia and as a rival in its own right for influence in the area. China 
has "reserved the right" to teach Mimi a "second lesson" and has in-
creased its strength in the border area sharply over the prewar level, 
but considerable reinforcements would be required for a major conflict 
with Vietvain. 
Beijing treats Taiwan essentially as a political and juridical ques-
tion and does not appear to anticipate hostilities there in the near fu-
ture. In any event, China is not capable at present of a successful 
amphibious invasion of Taiwan. 
The leadership recognizes China's inferiority in modern weapons 
relative to its main adversaries and has set comprehensive moderniza-
tion of its obsolescent forces as one of its key goals. I however, among 
its goals for modernization--of agricidture, industry, science and tech-

nology, and defense?defense clearly has the lowest priority. There is 
a broad consensus within the Chinese leadership that the civilian econo-
my must be further developed as a prerequisite to effective military 
modernization. 
Thus, significant improvement of China's military forces will de-
pend on political stability and the commitment to modernization, the 
availability of foreign technology, and the avoidance of a costly conflict 
with the USSR or Vietnam. We estimate that some progress will be 
made, especially in the late 1980s. 
? China's strategic missile force will grow slowly during the 
decade, but a couple of full-range ICBMs that can reach all of 
the continental United States will be operational within .he 
next year or two. 
? China will launch additional nuclear-powered submarines 
during the decade, and probably will have one or more oper-
ational SSBN/S1,13M units by the late 1980s. 
? A Spey-engined Chinese combat aircraft will become oper-
qtional sometime after 1985. 
NIereover, there are a number of critical gaps in China's capabili-
ties that will receive early attention and some remedy through introduc-
tion of new technology and equipment, some perhaps acquired from 
foreign sources. Among the pr i Wins are: 
? The need for good antitank guided missiles and low-altitude 
air defense weapons, particularly surface-to- air missiles. 
? Serious de;Iciencies in battlefield mobility and tactical 
communications. 
? The inability to design and develop modern airframes and 
engines for combat aircraft. 
? Acute logistical deficiencies in a wartime enviromnept. 
China's in doctrine--people's war under modern condi-
tions"?is for China realistic and practical as a defense against the 
USSR, and is likely to change only slightly in the nest I() years. Tlw 
Chinese will continue to rely on massive population, vast territory, aml 
defense in depth to counter Soviet advantages in technology, new 
weapons will only gradually be introduced into the forces. In sum, the 
Chinese perceive the USSR as a long-term threat and appear to believe 
that their current and future military capabilities and warming relathuis 
wit II the West will offer eiumgli of a deterrent to keep the I. at 
hay for die foreseeable future.

leaders. The supreme military authority, the Military 
Commission, is an organ of the Chinese Columnist

dealt with by the Politburo, the pinnacle of Chinese

Lin Mao had been designated Mao's heir, the military

has sought to reduce the influence of the PI.A In local

management of everyday affairs. Lven before  the de-

aerospace. to:clear. land armaments, shipbuilding, and

50 major military industrial facilities, made sweeping 
changes in the military scientific and technological 
structure, resumed testing a variety of weapons (after 
a hiatus of up to six years), and launched a massive 
program to study a broad smtrum of foreign military 
technology and equipment. 
39. The magnitude of the military industrial mod-
erni,ation effort, and the potentially disruptive effect 
of the program on other modernintion goals, appar-
ently was not immediately understood by the lead-
ership in Beibng because of the general lack of plan 
ning and ccpordinaVon of China's overall moderni7a-
lion activities In February 1974, however. Premier 
Ilua Guofeng in his report to the Fifth National 
People's Congress, called for -integrating military 
with nonmilitary enterprises and peacetime produc-
lion with preparedness against war.- This formulation 
suggested that some military production and research 
and development should 1)e devoted to nonmilitary 
purposes Subsequently, military industrial expansion 
declined, stronger civilian control was established 
within the military Industrial bureaucracy, and a 
larger share of existing industrial capacity Was de& 
cated to nonmilitary industrial production. 
40. Further restrictions on the scope and pace of 
China's military industrial moderni7ation effort began 
to emerge in early 1979. Preceding the shift to a 
three-year period of readjustment, criticism surfaced 
over the lack of good judgment and coordination in 
the importation of technology and equipment, includ-
ing imports with military application. A dramatic il-
lustration of the falloff in Chinese interest in purchas-
ing foreign military equipment and technology is the 
marked decline of high-level technical and industrial 
delegations going to and from China through 1979.

anti geographic assets: a ',ovulation larger (and more

NATO and the Warsaw Paul; the world's largest stand-

1910s when (:ommitnist forces fought the Nationalists 
and the Japanese. "People's %Var.' invols et the mo-

recogni7es that destruction of enemy forces is more

those forces. 
Stratogy

It has a small but credible deterrent force of strategic 
nuclear missiles that mould make any attack our China 
a risky and potentially costly prospect. It% conventional 
foal.% are deplosed according to strategies rangi ug

ern Imuder to a defense in depth in the ind 
northeast In the Urumqi Military Iligion in the north-
west. HA forces are thinly deplosed and probabh 
VI territory inure readily. 
39. Slain force units are trained and equipped to 
fight a clinventional war in any part of Chit, or at 
short distances bound China's borders. Regional 
forces augment main forces, and they often man (Red 
defensise ()millions within compact geographical areas. 
Militia units are trained and equipped to defend their 
immediate locale and to reinforce and support re-
gional or main force units as the need arises, The mi. 
lit ia together with stay-behind or los passed units of 
main or regnmal forces, would be espected to fight 
it guerrillas in territory occupied b, an invader. All 
three tspes of forces are trained to w.e available weap-
onry and to rely upon manpower and terrain as their 
primary means of resistance. 
60. The Chinese armed forces cc ill not, for the 
Foreseeable future, he suitably armed and organimd 
to discard the -People's War" concept and adopt a 
new strategic doctrine that would permit defense near 
all of China's borders instead of strategic withdrawal. 
Until such a chan,ce can be accomplished, we believe 
Chinese strategy will continue to require trading space 
for time, with the resulting loss of some key areas of 
the country. There are, however, indications that this 
policy is controversial withi u the Chinese military. 
Some military thinking app irently advocates a more 
Forward defense?especipdy in the northeast?
presumably to avoid the psychological and economic 
costs of allow ing deep penetrations. This thinking re-
flects grossing concern over the PLA's inability to re-
act to a variety of lionited-objective Soviet attacks, 
such as a strike at the Daqing oilfields. Such an al. 
(crow strategy ohs mushy would require a more rapid 
modernitation of the Chinese armed forces than the 
leadership now appears to contemplate. Indeed we do 
not see any consincing signs this point of sic st. is 
prevailing in leadership circles.

69. The Chinese also would be extreme's' vulner-
able to a large-scale chemical or biological warfare at-
tack. They lack mcxlern equipment to cope with such 
an attack, and the PIA receives only the most rudi-
mentary training in unit or individual protective prac-
tices 
70. A Sino-Soviet Conventional War. A limited 
Soviet incursion into China could be carried out with 
forces currently stationed in the border regions with 
considerable chance of success. However, a major So-
viet conventional invasion aimed at seizing Beijing 
probably would require at least 80 divisions, about 
double the size of the current force. Despite the prob-
ability of sizable losses and acute logistic problems, we 
believe the PLA has perhaps an even chance of stale-
mating such an attack short of its objective.

sh fend key territory from th,t? Shenyang Military Re-

would be able to deny a major port or beachhead to 
Soviet naval forces. 
73. The Chinese intend to provide air defense and 
ground attack support to their army. Over the bat-
llefiekl, it is unlikely that the Chinese could prevent 
Soviet tactical aircraft from effectively supporting 
Soviet ground forces. Chinese air defenses would be 
somewhat more effective against Soviet interdiction; 
this effectiveness would increase with the depth of 
Soviet attacks. 
74, Although lacking a close-air-support capability 
in the Western sense, the Chinese probably intend to 
conduct ground attack in the battle area and inter-
diction against Soviet supply lines. Ground attack op-
erations would be costly because of Soviet air- and 
ground-based Par defenses and difficult because of 
deficiencies In Chinese ground attack aircraft. These 
operations probably would not be effective. Interdic-
tion attacks probably would be more successful, but 
heavy Chinese losses would occur. It is unlikely that 
Chinese air attacks would seriously hinder Soviet re-
supply efforts. 
75. The Chinese Air Force is marked by obsolescent 
aircraft and armament, an unsophisticated ground-
based air defense system, and inefficient command 
and control. However, most of China's combat air-
fields are located more than 300 kilometers (200 miles) 
from the northern border, affording some protection 
from surprise attack -6d increasing the available re-
action time for Chinese fighters. In addition, China's

cupation of Chinese territory costly, 
78. A War in Southeast Asia. Chinese forces in 
the Guangzhou and Kunming NI Rs adjacent to Viet-
nam, Laos, and Burma could launch large in op-
erations across China's borders. The invasion of Viet-
nam in February 1979 is a measure of China's war-
fighting capability in the south.' During four months 
of preparation, China increased its strength near the 
border from 50,000 to 500,000 troops and from :300 
to 900 comkt aircraft; it integrated main lnd local 
forces, with militia units in sup9orting roles, into the 
operation The PLA built a 5:1 advantage in ground 
troops and pursued its military objectives cautiously 
and conservatively. Even so, the rate and depth of the 
11 .A advance were reduced by rugged terrain and 
tenacious Vietnamese defense, but perhaps even more 
by poiitical limitations and cautious tactics. 
79. Since the conflict, Vietnam has more titan dou-
bled its ground forces north of Hanoi to more than 
250,(tX). Most Chinese main force units have returned 
to their home garrisons, and as a result about equal 
numbers of Chinese and Vietnamese forces are now 
in the border area. Moreover, the Soviets have deliv-
ered large quantities of combat aircraft, tanks, ships, 
and other military equipment to 17ietnam since the 
WM% 
80. If China were to launch another attack against 
Vietnam, considerable augmentation of Chinese forces 
would again be required, especially for an advance 
deeper than in February 1079. A campaign to reach 
!fano' and the Red River delta would require stock-
piling additional supplies near the Aletriamese border 
to compensate for the limited capacity of the trans-
portation sy stem iii the area. China could penetrate 
more deeply into Laos but would be hindered by poor 
roads and long supply lines in any effort to reach

tain and improve its advantage over ?iietnam, but will 
continue to require extensive preparations prior to 
launching any major offensive. 
81. The terrain along the Sino-Vietnamese border 
is rugged and defendable on both sides. Thus, even 
in a defensive mode Chinese ground forces are de-
ployed well forward. 
82. Capabilities in Other Areas. The Chinese 
have a formidable naval, air, and ground coastal de-
fense capability. The Navy can defend the coast 
against any seaborne invasion. China will not have a 
significant opon-ocean war-fighting capability against 
a major adversary during the next decade, hut some 
progress in this area is being made. Its submarine force 
already can conduct significant antishipping 
operations. 
83. China is unlikely to initiate any major military 
action inn the East and South China Seas through the 
in with the possible exception of action against 
Vietnam over disputed islands or territorial seas. Both 
have claims to the Paracel (Xisha) and Spratly 
(Nansha) Islands, and dispute rights to some waters 
of the Tonkin Gulf and South China Sea. (See figure 
1-5.) In the case of Taiwan, Beijing had adopted a 
patient and limithreatening attitude even before the 
normalization of relations with the United States and 
certainly perceives little if any threat from Taiwan. 
81. China is not capable at present of a successful 
amphibious invasion of Taiwan.' The PLA has suf-
ficient ground troops in the military regions opposite 
Taiwan to invade the island without weakening those 
forces confronting the Soviet Union, but, to be success-
ful, China would first have to win air and sea superi-
ority around Taiwan. Such air operations would re-
quire a drawdown of fighter-brunber and bomber 
aircraft front the four northern military regions. 
Acquiring the command and control capabilities, land-
ing ships, means for naval bombardment, and (raining

Korea again, they could apply sufficient strength to 
overwhelm the forces now in South Korea. Today, 
however, China's military requirements along the 
Sino-Soviet frontier and the wide range of possible US 
reactions to Chinese military intervention in Korea 
severely limit Beijing's freedom of action, and the Chi-
nese would probably discourage a North Korean at-
tack. If the North should launch a major offensive, 
China probably would provide no more than token 
military suppmt. It might provide substantial simport 
if the course of a conflict threatened the survival of 
the North Korean regime. 
86. Central tia. PLA capabilities in Central Asia 
(including India) and Tibet (Xizang) are extremely 
limited, Mountainous terrain, the great distances in-
volved, and the relatively small size of PIA forces in 
the west would prevent China from conducting more 
than punitive expeditions against border incursions. 
Chiliese logistic. shortcomings in the I Iimalayas are be-
ing alleviated bv the comtruction of roads, a POI, 
pipeline, and a rail line into the area, but such im-
provements cannot overcome the problems inherent 
in maintaining forces in difficult, remote terrain, and 
severe weather. Tlw PIA would probably seek to keep 
open its highway to Pakistan and block the movement 
of hostile troops into Urumqi from Afghanistan. 
Outlook 
87. China will continue to try to improve its na-
tional security by countering Soviet influence, improv-
ing its ability to influence events in Asia, and generally 
expanding its role in international affairs. Achieving 
these goals will detwnd heavily on three variables: 
? The ability of the present leadership to maintain 
internal political stability and continue the 
commitment to the Four Mmkierili/al iOnS. 
- Thv successful implementation of current eco-
nomic policies, w hich depends in some measure 
on the continuing availability' of foreign 
techin/illgy. 
? The avoidance of major hostilities with the USSR 
or 1'ietnam that could divert limited resources 
away from modernization, 
88 We believe that the prospects for political 
stability' in China are better than at any time in the 
last two heath's . Younger leaders being des ated tmm 
key positions Hill gradually' consolidate their power, 
and debilitating INA% yr struggles appear unlikely.. In 
the last three ears leadership elements riot committed 
to the current line or to modernization have been 
quietly removed, and the Politburo and other top 
echelons are now relatively unified. However, social 
and political problems related to economic moderniza-
tion will create strains that could divide the leadership 
and factional infighting could increase. Debate over 
modernization policy is inevitable and at least some 
elements of that policy?but not i.e drive itself ? 
could be altered significantly. 
89. The major domestic concern of today's leader-
ship is the economy. While only modest gains are now 
being made, the Chinese economy eventually will be 
able to produce at higher levels and will be better able 
to absorb foreign technologies. Improved manage-
ment, foreign advice and equipment, and priority 
funding can be expected to produce gains in agricul-
ture and industry by 11985. The leadership hopes that 
deemphasis of heavy industry in favor of light industry 
will improve China's ability to earn foreign exchange, 
create more new jobs, and gain technical expertise. 
Sustained agricultural growth will eventually cause a 
decline in import costs for 1?0(1 and fibers and should 
allow for increased imports of complete plants, equip-
ment, and technology. Continued industrial expansion 
will diminish the need to import finished and 
semifinished industrial goods for defense and other in-
dustries. However, major setbacks in such key areas 
as population control, food supply, and energy produc-
tion would trigger short-term policy adjustments at the 
national bye!. The probability of major reverses ap-
pears remote at this time. 
90. Defense modernization currently has the lowest 
priority of the Four Modernizations, The Chinese per-
ceive the Soviet Union as a long-term threat and ap-
'war to believe that their present deployment of forces 
and warming diplomatic relations with the United 
States and I.:m(4w offer enough of a deterrent to keep 
the USSR at bay for the foreseeable future. In the face 
of a heightened Soviet threat, the Chinese obviously' 
would reconsider the priority of defense. The dilemma 
they face, however, is that they lack sufficient re-
sources to improve their overall defense posture in the 
short term, a lid evemu a major diversion of resources 
would In any case lw accomplished too late to affect 
the situation. China's military Ls eakuesses are rooted 
deficiencies in training and technology' that will re-
quire years to overcome. Ironically, the massive size 
of China's forces complicates the modernization drive 
since those resources committed to defense moderniza-
tion can benefit only small parts of the military' estab-
lishment at any' one (11114..

military nnxlernizaticon gradualls' and will supply new 
weajxms to the PEA as the defense Industrie., benefit 
from increased investment and from both Western 
and indigenous technology. Only a small number of 
new weapons are likely to be introduced into the 
forces by 1985, but in the later 19S0s increasing num-
bers of new sse31X)11S probably will become available, 
Perhaps most important, (Nu's research and devel-
opment will gain sophistication, enabling China to 
gradually resolve weaknesses in key technical areas 
such as metallurgy and electronics. The introduction 
of new industrial management techniques and the cre-
ation of a pool if trained technicians and engineers 
will enable defense modernization to gain momentum 
by the close of the 19S0s. 
92. The most dramatic achievement in the nuxl-
ernization of China's military forces will be the 
deployment of a small force of full-range ICBMs and 
the apjx?arance of a submarine-launched ballistic mis-
sile system by the late 19S0s. The numbers and types 
of weapons will not appreciably add to Cloina's ca-
pability to fight a nuclear war, but will improve the 
survivability and deterrent value of Ow force. 
93 The defense gaps most likely to receive early 
attention from the leadership?and w hich will be 
remedied by early introduction of new equipment?
are those that reflect serious Chinese sulnerabilities 
? Chief among these are weak antitank and low-
altitude air defense capabilities. There have been 
some attempts to correct these deficiencies, such 
as the reported development tof Chinese variants 
of the Sagger antitank guided missile (AU AI) 
and Grail shoulder-launched surface-to-air MiS-
Sile (SAI). A low-altitude SAM for both land-
based and shinborne air defense is under desel-
opment. More and Ix-Iter antitank and air 
defense weaponry can be expected in the near 
term. 
? Mobility and tactical communications also use 
problems ( bluest intereq in a sariety tof foreign

? Another critical problem has been China's inabib 
It s to build modern engines for aircraft The 
Spey engine purchase from the United Kingdom 
and extensive study of US and European engines 
should help resolve this problem. Gas turbine 
technology will also acquired from the West 
for naval application. 
94. New tactics and doctrine will have to be devel-
oped to make effective use of new weapons introc!uced 
in the P1 A. Chinese forces will be required to conduct 
frequent exercises to gain operational familiarity with 
the new weapons, and the services will develop in-
creasingly sophisticated training programs for heir 
personnel, including specialized technical training and 
joint service exercises. The Chinese probably will 
modify PEA organization to take better advantage of 
such weapons?for example, creating special, highly 
mobile units armed with antitank guided missiles. 
Also, the requirement for more sophisticated mainte-
nance and the increased flow of specialized parts 
through supply channels ss ill undoubtedly result in 
tkvelopment of a more onnplex military logistic 
In-Rani/Atm. 
95. China's military doctrine?which dictates how 
forces are organized and strategies developed?is 
likely to change only slightly in the next 10 years 
"People's War Under Modern Conditions" is for 
China a realistic and practical military doctrine. 
China's massive population, limited economic and 
technical capabilities, and vast territory suggest the ob-
vious?use of terrain and ininwnse manpower to over-
whelm enemy advantages inn technology. Defense in 
depth will remain the princiry strategy by which the 
Soviet threat will be countered. 
96. In uuui, Cliint'SC defense policy will change little 
in the corning decade. Nevertheless, aging in 
ctommanders will be replaced aml Chinese bones will 
become more professional and !miter trained, but the

II. CHINA'S MILITARY FORCES 
1. China has developed the full range of military 
forces befitting a major military power: strategic nu-
clear forces, a coastal defense IlaVy moving toward the 
open ocean, and large ground and air forces. Never-
theless, all of these forces are at the mercy of China's 
antiquated technological and industrial establishment, 
which can produce only weapon systems at least a gen-
eration behind those of modern Western and Soviet 
bloc forces. Just to achieve today's state of the art 10 to 
20 years hence, China must leap decades of 
technology. 
2. China's forces?collectively knovvn as the Peo-
ple's Liberation Army (PL/v)?also reflect a genera-
tion of Chinese isolation from the modern world and 
50 years of the supremacy of Maoist ideology. The 
military doctine and tactics, training, and organization 
that have evolved are consistent with the size and 
quality of China's armed forces and are well adapted 
to China's geographic and strategic situation, but are 
not suitable to modern, high-intensity conflicts. 
3. This section of the Estimate addresses the current 
state of China's forces, their missions and capabilities, 
and the prospects for their future through the 1980s. 
A. STRATEGIC ATTACK 
Current Forces 
4. China has deployed a small, 1960s-vintage force 
of ballistic missiles (see figure 11-1) and bombers for 
strategic offense. Although it could threaten US forces 
and allies in Asia, its operational delivery vehicles can-
not reach the- continental United States. The force is 
far too small to threaten the USSR with a disarming 
first strike, but its growing retaliatory capability is al-
ready a deterrent to Soviet nuclear atiack.I  
We believe that, in the even 01 a soviet 
nuclear attack on China, sufficient Chinese launchers 
would survive to deliver a small but destructive retal-
iatory' strike, principally against urban and industrial 
targets in the eastern USSR. 
5. Since 
1974, Ilcijitig slowly has increased 
the site and eapabil ty of its missile force and has In-
creased the emphasis on survivability. 
Tlw CSS-2 Intermediate-range ballistic' 
(11111M) now constitutes the bulk of Ilie force. 
? There has been an apparent decrease in activity 
associated with the CSS-1, China's first medium-
range ballistic missile (MR BM). 
? We believe China's first ballistic missile, the 
Soviet SS-2 short-range missile system (SRIA), 
has been dropped from the operational 
Inventory. 
Beijing still has not deployed a full-range ICBM sys-
tem or an SSBN/SLIIM system. 
6. For its Ixsinber force Beijing has continued its 
slow but steady production of TU-16 bombers that 
could conduct strikes along China's periphery'. 
Ha. Chinese 
have nude progress recently in some developmental 
programs that long have been under way. The sub-

will likely enable China to us ercimie problems vs ith 
spacecraft guidance, attitude control, power supply

and lighter spacecraft components 
Prospects 
55 We f.presee only a modest increme in the ca-
liabilities of Chitia's strategic nuclear attack forces 
during the nett five sears Several factors influence 
this estimate, 
? The Chinese almost certainly perceive that their 
nuclear forces already provide a credible deter-
rent against an attack by the USSR. and that mas-
sive growth of the force would be required to 
obtain a significant increase in the force's 
ss ar-f ight ing capability against the Soviets 
? Technological and economic constraints will in-
hibit rapid growth of the Chinese strategic strike 
capability. Only minimal Western technology is 
likely to be available for strategic weapons, and 
we expect the Chinese to subordinate expend-
itures for obsolescent strategic weapons to spend-
ing for the development of more capable future 
ss stems 
? We have detected no recent new starts on missile 
bases, which in the past have taken at least five 
years to build. 
56. We project gradual increases in deploy ment of 
the CSS-2 and CSS-3 systems. Deplosmeni of the 
limited-range CSS-3 at roll-out launch sites probably. 
will occur in small monk I'S, enhancing China's mini-
mal capability to cover targets in the western USSR. 
We expect Ile addition of some 10 to 20 PRIM 
launchers its er the nett few sears, hut no increase and 
perhaps a decline in the deplosment of the (:15-1 
S1111111 Production of the TU-10 liomber probably 
will continue at a rate 44 about three to five per sear, 
but vve see no lodicationv of appreciable change in 
the primr.ry mission of these aircraf fit of the 11,-28 
medhitn-range bondier. 
57. We estimate that those delivery systems now 
under development that will become operational in 
the 1980s will Ire deplosed only in modest numbers. 
The two CSS-X?4 silos 14 ill soon be externally com-
plete, and we think that these sites will be operational 
within a year. We expect the Chinese esentually to 
deploy additional CSS-X? Is 
tilina's first ballistic missile submarine probably will 
become operational tround the mid-to-late 1980s. A 
second unit may also become (gyrational late in the 
decade. 
58 We believe that those missile aod space sv sterns 
that become operational in the nett live years will 
provide the basis for additional systems that could 
reach operational status during the second half of the 
decade. They probably will include: 
A modified CSS-X-4 us ith improved guidance 
and reentry vehicle ss stems, 
-- A new space launch vehicle or an upgraded 
(;SL-2 launch vehicle to support expanding 
activities in space. 
? A land-based, solid-propellant missile 
59. The Chinese continue to espand their capacity 
to design, produce, and test o!id- and liquid-
propellant systems, and they are improving their 
weapon design technology an adding to their capac-
ity to prodoce fissile material 
In addition, the Chinese will 
have to overcome many chronic problems in educa-
tkm, research, industrial management, and technology 
that will continue to restrain progress in weapon ()s-
tem development throughout the decade. We do, how-
ever, expect an increasing emphasis on solid-propel-
lant R&D during the 1980s.

Trends and Developments 
97. We believe Ihat deployment of a new twin-jet 
fighter, the F-8 (Xian A), will improve China's strate-
gic air defense over the next five years. We estimate 
that this Chinese-designed aircraft will enter the oper-
ational inventory in the coining year. The F-8 will 
feature improved performance at medium-to-high al-
titudes and might be etiuipped with improved avionics 
and armament. 
O. The Chinese also are working on a new combat 
aircraft to be powered by the British-designed Spey 
engine, but we do not expect it to be introcluced into 
the forces until the mid-to-late 1980s. We believe it 
will be capable of both ground attack and intercept. 
Such an aircraft probably' will be more reliable, carry 
larger payloads, and have better performance than 
any now in the Chinese inventory. The Spey will help 
provide the base of technology necessary to produce 
other types of aircraft engines. 
09. me Chinese have deployed an indigenously de-
signed and Produced air-to-air missile with infrared  
guidance?the PL-2- 25X1 
 They have studied the Soviet Atoll, the 25X1 
American Sidewinder, and the French Matra, but we 
do not know which system has most influenced their 
new missile. Thus far, deployment has been to their 
F-7/ MIC-21 units and to selected F-6/MIG-19 units, 
primarily those that are radar equipped. I lowever, the 
bulk of their interceptors are still only cannon 
eqI ipped. 
III). We ('visec't the PI.-3, a larger sersion of the

101. The other improvement programs we have de-
tected would not add substantially to Chinese air de-
fense capabilities before the mid-to-late 19805. China 
probably has been working on improved models of 
airborne-intercept radars to permit all-weather opt-r-
ations, provide greater search and track range, and al-
low interceptors to engage targets at longer range. The 
Chinese probably also are developing improved 
ground-based early warning radars. They are devel-
oping a second smaller SAMI?the CSA-X-2?which 
we believe is intended for low-altitude air defense of 
ground forces and naval ships, but could be used in 
a strategic air defense role. There is no evidence that 
they are developing a follow-on to the CSA- 1. 
102. Despite China's expressed intereL., in several 
air defense systems produced in the West, there is no 
firm exidence that it actually intends to purchase any 
of them. We believe that large-scale purchases are un-
likely because of the high cost, China's traditional 
reluctance to become dependent on foreign suppliers, 
and the reluctancy or miwillingness of some foreign 
s4nirces to supply the systems. China may attempt to 
negotiate agreements that include production rights 
and techiliejl cosistance while restricting the purchase 
of end item 5 to those required for training or as proto-
types. The transfer of technology would take several 
years to absorb, however, and would not improve Chi-
na's air defense capabilities significantly before the 
mid-1980s. 
Prospects 
103. We estimate that China's strategic defenses 
will improve gradually over the next five years. 
? The Chinese probably will begin full-scale 
pp duction of the F-8, but we estimate that no 
more than 160 are likely to be operational by 
mid-1985. 
? Production of F-6 and F-7 aircraft probably will 
continue through 198:3, after which the upgrad-
ing with improved engines, avionics, and A Aixts 
for the aircraft may occur, 
? Deployment of the CSA-1 is likely to continue 
at a rate of alxmit five battalions (30 launchers) 
per year, along with steady production of existing 
models of antiaircraft guns. 
? We do not believe that the Chinese Wil I have 
an adequate capability for the automated han-
dling and processing of air surveillance data dur-
ing the next five years. 
104. On lire basis of these considerations, we project 
a force mix (see table 11-3) which assumes that: 
? A new SAM for strategic defense will not be de-
ployed in quantity. 
? The number of aircraft In the force will be main-
tained at about the cu.rent 
? The F-8 will first enter the force in 1081.

nortb, These garrison units now supplement die for-
midab:e array of l'imstal defenses estaldished in tile 
I960s. The ground forces still lack adequate tactical 
and strategic mobility, flexible command and control, 
and modern firepower and armor, and they rely on 
largely outmoded weaponry. Prospects for significant 
improvement in the 19S0s are not promising. 
114. The air forces also reflect a reliance on ill!"{-
hers, with about 4,500 air defense aircraft (see section 
II B) and about 1,200 ground attack aircraft. The 
equipment is largely a generation out of date, its ar-
mament is meager, and the proficiency Of its person-
nel inferior by Western or Sosiet standards. Some 
progress is likely in the 19SO, but additional air-to-
air missiles and better fighters will not substantially 
alter air force capabilities 
115. The Navy, ss bile numerically one of the larg-
est in the world, remains a coastal defense force, with 
large inventories of small patrol boats and diesel attack 
submarines. While the Navy has little capability for 
operations at present in the 19S0s we 
foresee?building on developments of the late I970s?
a grossing effort to develop such capability. The fleet 
lacks effective antisubmarine warfare (ASW) and air 
defelse capability, and dots not have the firepower 
:ogistics for significant amphibious operations. 
Nevertheless, China has made some progress toward 
building a more modern fleet: two nuclear attack sub-
IllarilICS have been launched; a ballistic. missile sub-
marine is under construction: several large oceangoing

116 China's regular ground forces are hacked up 
by more than 100 million paramilitary personnel. Most

Ground Forces 
Organization, Composition, and Disposition 
133. China's ground forces are the largest standing 
army in the world-3.6 million troops in some 270 
divisions and about 300 iirlependent regiments (see 
table 11-4). Although predominantly infantry, there 
are armored, artillery, airborne, and railway engineer 
divisions as well. Chinese units are divided into main 
and regional forces with separate and distinct roles. 
131. Main force units consist of tactical maneuver 
ele nents (armies, independent combat divisions, and 
incependent regiments) and combat support and serv-
ici, support units, and are Available for combat in any 
part of China or outside its borders. During peacetime, 
the highest combat formation is an army usually com-
posed of three infantry divisions. 
135. Regional forces?garrison, border de .(ense, and 
internal security units?defend relatively corn pact 
geographic areas with or without the assistance of 
main forces. They are less likely to be employed uU 
of their assigned area of responsibility than are Main 
force units. 
? Garrison units are assigned to defend territory 
r, particular importance to the overall defense 
of China. They normally occupy well-prepared 
positions, often in wigged terrain, along main ap-
proaches to key areas of China. They are well 
equipped with field and antiaircraft artillery, 
antitank weapons, and heavy infantry weapons. 
? Border defense units are primarily reconnais-
sance forces that provide early warning of an en-
emy attack and intelligence about the size and 
axis of an attack. They are trained and equipped 
to fight as light infantry. 
? Internal defense units?formed in large meas-
ure to contend with Cultural Revolution chaos?
serve essentially as heavily armed police. 
136. There are about 185 main force and 87 re-
gional force divisions. More than half the force?about

1.7 millionItql?is the four northern 
military regions opposite the USSR. In general, they 
represent China's best equipped and most prepared 
11 huts Anothe.r miilion troops are deployed along 
the CI USt and opposite V10113111. The central ITSCRC 
(the Withal' MR and portions of surrounding regions) 
has most of the remaining Main forces, including three 
armored divisions and China's only airborne forces, 
and is available for reinforcement of threatened areas. 
1:37. Although !WV: Units %t ert. created ill the %sake 
of the 1969 Sino-Soviet border conflicts, China has 
stressed qualitative rather than quantitative improve-
ment since that time. 11(4%st:en 197:3 and 1978 the 
number of ground force units increased little., suggest-
ing that Beijing believed its forces mere large enough 
to meet any crisis in C, . near future. Since late 197S, 
however, China has created or added units along is 
frontiers w ith Vietnam and Laos, and in the north-
west. 
13S. The People's Militia is a part-rime paramili-
tary organization found throughout China. Over 100 
million strong, it would provide substantial wartime 
in and logistic support to the PLA. Al-out 7 
million militia members are armed anti receive peri-
exlic training. 
Military Equipment 
1:39. Chinese ground force equipment is largely. 
bawd on Sus id t designs and production technology of 
the 195(h, ssith significant modifications esident in 
only a fess instances A large output of infantry w eap-
this and artillery pieces on er the years has provided 
large nurnLd?rs of thew systems in the force., and' the 
11MIlber of armored vehicles has grown gradually dur-
ing the past decade. In general, Chinese wvaporis are 
inferior to those in Soviet hands, and critical gaps or 
numerical deficiencies account for major weaknesses 
of the current force.: pow tactical mobility, limited 
organic air defense, limited antiarmor capabilities, and 
acute logistic problems. Present production levels are. 
sufficient to continue furnishing gradually increasing 
quantities of combat materiel to selected units. The 
introduction of more sophisticated weaponry is ex-
pected in the near future. (See table 11-5 for current 
major items of equipment.) 
Capabilities and Limitations 
110. Infantry arid Airborne Forces. Infantry units 
are. the backbone of the PLA and would bear the brunt 
of fighting in any conventional conflict. Main force 
infantry divisions have 12,000 to 14,000 men in three 
maneuver regiments and various ...,pporting units. 
About half ol the divisions have tank regiments and 
armored reconnaissance companies. There are. few ar-
mored personnel carriers (AII:s) organic to Chinese 
infantry divisions. 
141. Though China produces an All:, extensive 
medianization of forces does not appear imminent. 
China's APC, the M-1967, is similar to the US M-113 
and has been used primarily as a reconnaissance and 
tactical command vehicle in armored units. Since. se-
ries production began in 1967, between 1,:300 and 
1,10/ have. entered the force?nearly two-thirds de-
ployed in the military regions opposite the Soviet 
Union, but only two mechanized regiments?probably 
experimental?have been formed.

have 17 antiaircraft artillery divisions, some inde-

organic to the main force infantry divisions. Chinese 
AAA is based on Soviet moxlels of the late 19505. 
Most regiments have a battalion each of the 57-min,

role if the garrison' and main force units had to defend 
a major city such as Shenyang. Divisions of antiaircraft 
artillery would prombably reinforce main force infantry. 
divisions or garrison divisions as required. 
15:3. The Chinese are developing a new, low-to-
medium-altitude surface-to-air missile?the CSA-X-2?
presumably for both ground force and naval applica-
tions. Limited deployment of such mobile SAN1s ith 
the ground forces probalily will occur by 19S5 and 
will enhance defense against ground attack aircraft at

Trends and Prospects 
157. Gradual, systematic efforts at bircc improVe-
merit ss ill he aimed at ensuring that Chinese gommul 
forces, at a minimum, retain their current level of 
defensive capability against all potential threats. Al-
though the number of infantry and field artillery units 
will increase little, their operational proficiency ss ill 
improse ss ith more intensise training and better 
equipment. 
15S. Although ChinL has been increasing the 1111111-
her of border defense units along the Vietnamese fron-
tier since late 1978, the ()serail number of regional 
forces is unlikely to illCrejSt. markedly during the 
19S0s SIMIC new border defense and garrisonm (wits 
will probably be created--particularly along the SOH/-
Si/Viet and Sino- Vietnamese borders. 
159. By Ble end iii the decade, armored Units, anti-
tank capability, and infantry mobility probably will 
have been improved by introducing greater numbers 
of tanks and antitank guided missiles (perhaps 
I ncluding helicopter-mounted 1110(lels), mum lest 
amounts of self-propelled artillery., and more transport 
and bridging equipment. The selective incorporation 
of mechanized infantry units into the force also will 
enhance ground force capabilities. 
160. Barring a significant improvement of Sol iet 
forces facing China, the ability of FLA ground forces to 
counter a major Soviet conventional invasion ss ill im-
prove by the late 1111i0s. Enhanced mobility and fire-
pow er will enable Chinese forces to maneuver more 
effectisely against breaktimnighs, reinforce threatened 
areas, launch counterattacks, and conduct organized 
retrograde operationms. Furthermore, thew strengtheneti 
capabilities, supplemented by gains in supporting 
airpower in the latter half of the decade, will enable the

bomber, reconnaissance, electronic countermeasure 
(ECNI), and military transport aircraft (see table IF 
6). (See section II B for diSCUSS1011 of interceptors.) 
These aircraft are organized into 17 air divisions and 
nine independent regiments. 
Organization, Composition, and Disposition 
163. Ground Attack Forces. China's tactical com-
bat aircraft ?1)ombers, fighters, and fighter-bomb-
ers?are assigned to both the Air Force and the Naval 
Air Force, but there is no organization comparable to 
the IS Tactical Air Command or Soviet Frontal Avi-
ation. Air Force tactical units are controlled routinely 
by the Air Force commanders of the military regions 
in which they are based. There are seven Air Force 
bomber divisions and six fighter-bomber divisions, 
161. Naval aircraft are controlled by Naval Air 
Force Ifeadquarters in Beijing, which probably dele-
gates peacetime control of the aircraft to the fleets 
to which they are assigned. The Navy has three 
bomber divisions and orw regiment of fighter-bomb-
ers. Naval Air Force tactical aircraft suppmt naval 
forces through maritime reconnaissance, surface at-
tack, and minelaying operations. 
16,5. Tactical aircraft are assigned to support 
ground forces by interdiction and ground attack; they 
also train to support the Navy for coastal defense. Na-
val pilots are trained for surface attack and minelaying 
operations. Roth Air Force and Naval Air Force units 
would be assigned ground attack missions for defense 
against or support of amphibious operations. 
166. Most of the ground attack force is in northeast 
and east China, reflecting Beijing's priority for defense 
in these areas (see figure 11-10); ground attack require-
ments in southeast, south, and central China would be 
met by the relocation of aircraft. Ground attack forces 
have deployed to peripheral bases to support mit-of-
country operations?for example, before the Sino-
Vietnamese war. 
167. Transports and Helicopters. China has more 
than 550 transports and 430 helicopters assigned to the 
Air Force and Naval Air Force. Most are home-based 
in central China, but some transpotts support the 
Navy along the coast. Most of the force is for support 
of the national and regional headquarters, and for 
transport of military cargo and personnel and for sup-
port of airborne operations.

small number of land-based cinise missile sites dis-

019. Three fleets?north, east, and south?serve as 
peacetime operational commands for the Nass. (Fleet 
areas are shown in figure 11-9, on page 11-28.) Ships in 
each fleet are organired by (lye for administration 
and, in some cases, for operational control. Commands 
include those for submarines, main surface com-
batants, missile and torpedo attack boats, ausiliaries, 
and nasal coastal defense forces 
' The Nat al Air Pour is dittlittind in the Air rorve fledkm

since the mid-1970s the Navy's mission has mantled 
and now Includes ttruntering the Soviet presence in 
the Far East and establishing a greater Chinese politi-
cal presence there. 
Equipment and Armament 
191. A majority of China:: principal combat ships 
are less than 10 years old, but the designs of most slate 
from the 19505 or earlier. Nonetheless, the Navy is 
well trained and reasonably well equipped for its 
coastal defense mission, with its present inventory of 
some 100 diesel attack submarines and almost 240 mis-
sile boats. The Navy has more than 33 principal com-
batants; these add little to overall firepower?because 
of the limited number of antiship missiles per ship?
but have considerable importance because of their 
ability to operate at greater ranges and in more severe 
sea conditions than the smaller missile boats. 
192 The main weapon of the surface forces is the 
surface-to-surface cruise missile, 1k-skies producing the 
23-nm-range CSS-N-1, a (ivy of the Sosiet St$ s cruise 
missile, the Chin-se have developed and produced a 
lengthened version, the 15-nm CSS-N-2, perhaps with 
an infrared capability, These missiles, though based 
on Soviet technology of the 1950s, play a central role

slow . 
Capabilities and limitations 
191. The is y's capability to carry out its primary.

consentional surface attack?is substantial Land-
based and seaborne naval assets are designed to com-
plement one another effectiveh, producing a fully

their sheer numbers, are employed in a defense-in-
depth stratees %% Oh three osedapping perimeters. and 
could repulse or make eaceedingly costly any waborne 
attack (see figure 11.11). China's coastal geography. 
constrains the movement of attacking naval forces and 
enhances defense. 
196. Some 100 diesel submarines pros ide the outer 
Perimeter of China's fomard nasal defense awl %ill

shore guns serve as an additional backup should 
na's at-sea defenses be breached. 
199. Air Force and Naval Air Force aircraft, %stitch 
provide air defense for the fleet close to the coast. 
%sonic' also supplement the Navy's surface attack ca-
pability and supply some aircraft for maritime 
surveillance. 
200 
 The Chinese maintain their ships in ex-
cellent condition, and most units arc probably ready 
to put to sea on short notice. 
201. The lack of modern ASW and shiplxnne air 
defense systems currently present the most serious 
limitations to Chinese naval ssartitne capabilities, 
particularly as operating distance from shore increases

SINO?SOVIET MILITARY SITUATION 
Mutual Threat Perception and Force Buildup 
The Sino-sosiet dispute basically is a reflection 
of the clash of Chinese and Sm let national interests 
The bonds that lied China to the USSR began to un? 
rase' seriously in the late 1950s Sos let apprehension 
(net China's long-term reliability led to the refusal to 
I ros hie China nuclear %% capons, the withholding of 
military support during the Taiwan Strait crisis of 
193S, and the ss ithdraw al of Sosiet advisers In 1960 
Tensions increased over a series of national and kko-
IugkaI a border dispute?in the 
early 1960s China esploded its first nuclear Joke in 
October 1964 and Sino-Soviet border talks broke down 
in August 19M. The USSR then began to strengthen its 
forms in the border area,' reflecting Moscow's concern 
and uncertainty about Chinese intentions The buildup 
was not a reaction to an increased Chinese (Timer). 
Urinal military threat, because there had ken no 
discernible change in the strength of the Chinese. 
Forces in the border area, nor had there been serious 
military border incidents. 
2 From 1965 to 1969. Sosiet forces in the border 
area grew from 13 to 27 ground combat disisions, 
From 1,(XX) to 1,400 fisecl?ss ing combat aircraft (tac-
tical and air defense), and from )s73 to 1,000 strategic 
surface-to-air missile (SAM) launchers Moreover, in 
1966. the Sos lets signed a Trraty of Friendship. 
Cooperation. and NIntual Assistance with Mongolia, 
formalizing the Sor;et military prc7ence there and 
ensuring access to the frontier onls 6c,) kilometers 
from Beijing 
:3 The Chinese initially were slow to respond to the 
So% let Inn!dup. cc hich coincided roughls with the initi-
ation of the Cultural liesolution, and during the pe-
riod 1963-65 some Chinese units were moved out of 
northeast China for domestic seciirity arid political 
reasons ("Jana also ss as concerned at 'fiat time with

tars. buildup. Moscow's ins aslon of Czechoslovakia, 
and the enunciation of the Brezhnev Doctrine in 1965 
increased China's uneasiness, however, Border clashes 
along the lissuri River in 1969 dearly alarmed the 
Chinese and focused their at on the serious 
vulnerahilities of China's defenses. Chinese forces then 
began to shift from a defense oriented primarily 
against attack from the sea to a defense against a So-
viet thrust from the north. China also launched an 
estensIve effort to improve the capabilities of its Peo-
ple's Liberation Army (PEA) and enhance its 
SURIVahility* in the event of a Sos let attack. 
Trends in the Military Balance 
.1. Both Soviet and Chinese force levels in the bor-
der area have grown slowly but continuously since the 
early 197th (see figure A-1), although the majority of 
the ground forms and of the Soviet air forces now 
in place mere there by 1972 
3. Sot-let Detelopmenht. Sim, 1972 improve-
ments in the l'SSR's military isosture opposite China 
have been essentially qualitative, although there has 
been some numerical Increase, and far outstrip Chi-
nese improvements during the same period. Obsoles-
cent aircraft have been systematically replaced with 
more sophisticated models. On the ground, the Soviets 
have introduced new equipment, and Improved the 
rear sers ices. They also have expanded permanent 
fortifications in static defense areas at potentially 
sulnerable points. 
6. The general pattern of qualitative improvement 
was altered beginning in 1976 IA ith the addition of 
a tank disision in Mongolia and three, possibly four, 
new motorized rifle divisions in the Far East Military 
District. While the overall deplosment of Soviet forces 
in the Far East MD is defensive, the new divisions 
there are situated on likely Invasion routes into China. 
7. In 1979 the Soviets established an operational 
theater-level command?a Theater of Military Oper-
ations including at least the Par Fast, Trandraikat and 
Siberian Military Districts?in the Soviet Far East and

with an actise division, and each contains the critical 
combat equinment for a motoriml rifle disision. The

Current Militoty Options 
n In the event that the Sot let leadership decided 
that time protection of national interests requited mili-
tary action against China, a number of options would 
be available, ranging from limited conventional raids 
and demonsitations to nuclear strikes and full-scale 
invasion Most options, hoss ever. vioult1 provoke a Chi-
nese military response and tisk a prolonged 
including the use of nuclear vseamns. 
29. Soviet options involsing just conventional forces 
range from a contrived incident or series of incidents 
on the border to full-scale offensives aimed at gaining 
and holding Chinese territory. Small-scale forays in re-
sponse in Chinese incursions, or for the purpose of 
demonstrating Sot let displeasure and resolve, would 
entail only limited military tisk. Even a limited strike, 
however, would substantially raise the level of tension. 
A critical factor in Soviet decisionmaking would be 
the extent of the USSR's ability to control the level 
of military confrontation. Fot example, a limited So-
iet convectional attack aimed at major objectives in 
the Shenyang MR could be launched by forces cur-
rently in place, with some chance of success. It would 
risk a Chinese escalating response and prolongation of 
the conflict, 
30. A large Soviet conventional attack aimed at 
selling Beijing and northeastern China, would requite 
sending substantial Soviet reinforcements to the Far 
East. The combination of Chinese manpower, pre-
pared defenses, favorable terrain, and seasonal 
weather conditions, as well as the extension of the al-
ready limited Soviet lines of communication in the Far 
East into China proper, probably would :cad to a stale-
mated conflict?although the Sot lets could make ma-
jor territorial gains

demonstrative nuclear strike as a siable option, Ix-
