 Synopsis
 1          Perspective-Japan: Dawdling on Trade Issues
 Prime Minister Nakasone will find himself in the international spotlight in
 coming months, with Japan's massive trade surplus almost certainly holding
 the top position on his-and his trading partners'-agenda. We suspect his
 emphasis on longer term structural measures may be seen in some Japanese
 quarters as a way to "buy time" until 1987, when a strong yen may start to re-
 duce Japan's trade surplus with the United States.
 3          Prime Minister Nakasone's Political Agenda
 Prime Minister Nakasone's desire to extend his term as Liberal Democratic
 Party (LDP) president, and hence prime minister, will dominate both Japanese
 politics and policymaking through this fall. The common desire to ensure that
 the Tokyo Summit is a success will give the Prime Minister some breathing
 room until May after which the political battle lines will be drawn more
 sharply.
 7          The Rising Yen and Falling Oil Prices: Implications for Trade and Growth
 The actions of Japanese exporters and a sluggish domestic economy will blunt
 the impact of a stronger yen, and Tokyo's massive trade surplus is likely to
 grow through 1987. Falling oil prices, however, are unlikely to boost Japan's
 economic growth relative to that of its major trading partners, although the
 benefits of lower prices may save Tokyo from having to abandon its commit-
 ment to budget austerity.
 15         Japan's Import Promotion Program: How Effective?
 Unlike earlier efforts, the government's latest import promotion program,
 which began in April 1985, has some teeth-administrative guidance from
 MITI urging the country's 134 top exporters to boost imports. The program
 has met with some success but so far does not appear to have fundamentally
 changed the business community's attitude.

 Perspective           Japan: Dawdling on Trade Issues
 Prime Minister Nakasone will find himself in the international spotlight in
 coming months, with Japan's massive trade surplus almost certainly holding
 the top position on his-and his trading partners'-agenda. With a trip to the
 United States likely in mid-April and the economic summit set for Tokyo in
 May, no doubt he would like to promise that the recent strengthening of the
 yen will quickly slice the surplus. We do not believe such a forecast can be
 made in good conscience.
 Under the best circumstances, it will take at least a year for yen appreciation
 to reduce the trade surplus, and these are not the best of circumstances. Many
 large Japanese exporters are not adjusting prices to fully reflect the yen's new
 strength. Falling oil prices meanwhile will help exporters compensate for the
 toll a strong yen is taking on their competitiveness but will not be sufficient to
 generate a rise in domestic demand that pulls up significantly the level of
 Japan's imports.
 Nakasone will also face difficulty in portraying Tokyo's import promotion
 schemes and sector-specific trade talks as sure bets to reduce the country's
 surplus in 1986. The nearly year-old campaign to get top Japanese exporters to
 buy more abroad has fallen short of its unambitious target. Although Tokyo
 made numerous concessions in last year's sectoral trade talks with the United
 States, we do not expect similar talks this year to yield as much.
 Partly because of the difficulty of "selling" other approaches, we expect
 Nakasone will argue that structural adjustment of Japan's economy offers a
 long-term solution to trade problems. The commission formed by Nakasone to
 devise ways to reorient growth away from an export-led pattern will make its
 report by the end of this month. It appears unwilling, however, to advocate
 sweeping changes in the tax system that would encourage consumer spending
 and infrastructure investment or discourage investment in export-producing
 facilities. We expect the commission to endorse less dramatic moves that in the
 past have done little to remedy trade imbalances.
 Nakasone's role in pushing for a structural approach to the trade surplus may
 be viewed by future generations as an important legacy of the Prime Minister.
 But we are skeptical that most Japanese government and business leaders
 genuinely accept this solution. These leaders like the traditional rules of the
 game that put the burden for adjusting economic policies on the countries
 running deficits. Although such views have yielded to external pressures

 before, we doubt the commission's work will be followed by more rigorous
 proposals anytime soon, barring a resurgence of protectionist sentiment in
 Washington. We suspect the report may be seen in some Japanese quarters as
 a way to "buy time" until 1987, when a strong yen may start to reduce Japan's

 Prime Minister Nakasone's
 Political Agenda
 Prime Minister Nakasone's desire to extend his
 term as Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) president,
 and hence prime minister, will dominate both
 Japanese politics and policymaking through this
 fall. This struggle is certain to complicate some
 policy issues and to make others the objects of
 increased debate. The common desire among al-
 most all Japanese leaders, to ensure that the Tokyo
 Summit is a success, will give the Prime Minister
 some breathing room until May. After the summit,
 however, the political battle lines will be drawn
 more sharply. Nakasone is likely to argue for a
 more open Japanese economy, focusing on medium-
 to long-term proposals for changes in Japan's in-
 dustrial structure and macroeconomic policy. For
 international audiences, he is likely to advertise his
 policies as broad-based market-opening measures
 and to downplay sectoral trade issues, such as
 tobacco, that could expose him to a crossfire of
 criticism from his LDP rivals as well as foreign
 trading partners.
 Nakasone has publicly denied any plans to run for
 the LDP presidency when his term expires in
 October, but virtually all political observers believe
 he wants to change the party rules that bar him
 from a third consecutive term. To do so, Nakasone
 needs a two-thirds majority of LDP Diet members.
 To boost his chances, the press as well as political
 insiders speculate that he will call a general elec-
 tion, hoping to lead the ruling party to a major
 victory before the fall.
 Elections are already scheduled for the Diet's upper
 house this June, and Nakasone could argue that the
 party scored well in the past when upper and lower
 house elections were combined and that his person-
 al popularity makes such a gamble a good move. If
 the LDP regained the lower house seats lost in the
 1983 election, it would strengthen the Prime Minis-
 ter's hand. For Nakasone, however, this political
 strategy depends on the assent of the LDP's senior
 executives, including his leading rivals, and it is not
 yet clear that they would support a "double elec-
 tion."
 of the entire group.
 The Prime Minister also could seek a deal with one
 of his would-be successors-for example, by bar-
 gaining for a one-year extension rather than a new
 two-year term. An extension of his current term,
 which would allow Nakasone to pursue more of his
 plans for reforming government operations, would
 only require a simple majority of party members
 and conceivably could appeal to other party leaders
 who want to avoid an all-out succession fight.
 Finance Minister Takeshita appears to be the most
 likely collaborator. He commands a majority of the
 Tanaka faction-the LDP's largest-and is angling
 to succeed former Prime Minister Tanaka as leader
 A standoff among Nakasone's opponents represents
 his best chance to extend his term. His rivals
 continue to cooperate on most policy issues, but
 there is no indication that they agree on an orderly
 succession:
 ? Party Vice President Nikaido, the acting head of
 the Tanaka faction, appears to believe that he can
 keep control of the faction and compete for the
 LDP's top job.

 Legislative Scenarios
 Nakasone's political prospects will also be shaped
 by his ability to deal with a number of thorny
 problems now before the Diet. A Supreme Court
 decision has again forced the ruling party to face
 the problem of reapportioning seats in the lower
 house. The breakup and privatization of Japan
 National Railways (JNR), tax bills, and possibly
 education reform are also tough agenda items.
 For Nakasone, failure to secure passage of a bill to
 reallocate Diet seats by the close of the current
 session on 22 May would weaken his position
 within the LDP as well as undermine his chance to
 call elections and extend his term. The debt-ridden
 JNR also presents a serious obstacle for Nakasone,
 particularly if the LDP fails to reach a consensus
 on a privatization scheme. Public-sector unions will
 be affected by the railway reform, raising the
 possibility that the Socialists-who depend heavily
 on organized labor-will make the bill a rallying
 point.
 With the opposition already calling for large per-
 sonal income tax cuts in the fiscal 1986 budget, tax
 issues are certain to prove contentious. Income tax
 cuts would be politically popular, but Nakasone, his
 political advisers, and the Ministry of Finance are

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/12/12 : CIA-RDP88-00798R000300060004-1
 likely to argue that the government's commitment
 to fiscal austerity precludes this option on anything
 but a token scale. Instead, we believe Nakasone
 would prefer to offer an investment tax credit and
 new incentives for housing construction, which
 could be portrayed both at home and abroad as
 economic stimuli. We expect the Prime Minister to
 unveil such proposals before the June upper house
 election.
 Beyond the Summit
 Nakasone will also need to deal with the political   25X1
 consequences of a stronger yen.'
 On the World Stage
 Nakasone has maintained both the political initia-
 tive and his high popularity by playing an adroit
 diplomatic hand. The Tokyo Summit represents his
 next potential triumph and the linchpin in his
 strategy to translate his own popularity into anoth-
 er mandate. The recent appreciation of the yen will
 help Nakasone by taking some of the edge off
 Japan's trade problems with the United States and
 other major trading partners. We expect Nakasone
 to capitalize on the currency issue by emphasizing
 the need to coordinate international macroeconom-
 ic policy at the summit and to downplay sectoral
 trade disputes.
 Given the continued calls by LDP politi-
 cians as well as Japan's trading partners for Tokyo
 to expand domestic demand, we expect Nakasone
 to respond by supporting an easing of monetary
 policy and by highlighting the benefits of any
 proposed income tax reductions. The Prime Minis-
 ter is already under pressure from Finance Minis-
 ter Takeshita on the growth issue. Takeshita re-
 cently captured the limelight-and the credit-by
 disclosing that the bulk of public works spending in
 the new fiscal year, beginning in April, will be
 disbursed during the first half of the year.
 25X1
 25X1
 Leading up to the summit, Nakasone will encour-
 age the bureaucracy to make efforts to conclude
 ongoing trade negotiations, such as those on alumi-
 num tariffs, electronics, and pharmaceutical
 Nakasone must keep a step ahead of Foreign
 Minister Abe in foreign policy as well as deal with
 competition from Takeshita over economic policy.
 Nakasone and Abe both are contending for the
 spotlight in dealing with Moscow, which has moved
 to warm its relationship with Tokyo. Nonetheless,
 we expect the Prime Minister to be cautious.
 Although a Nakasone-Gorbachev summit could
 further boost Nakasone's popularity, the Prime
 Minister is well aware that unseemly haste in
 striking bargains with Moscow would expose him to
 Given the political season
 in Tokyo, we expect the Prime Minister to seek
 something in return for any Japanese concessions.
 Nakasone is also likely to attempt to deflect atten-
 tion from trade problems at the summit by playing
 up strategic political issues. He probably will make
 a statement backing some form of participation for
 Japanese corporations in the strategic defense ini-
 tiative program (SDI) before then. If the trade
 discussions become divisive, Nakasone may redou-

 The Rising Yen and Falling
 Oil Prices: Implications for
 Trade and Growth
 The actions of Japanese exporters and a sluggish
 domestic economy will blunt the impact of a stron-
 ger yen, and Tokyo's massive trade surplus is likely
 to grow through 1987. We expect Japan's current
 account surplus-bolstered by falling prices of oil
 imports-to approach $60 billion this year, while
 its trade surplus with the United States ' may reach
 $45 billion, a $6 billion increase over 1985 levels.
 Falling oil prices, however, are unlikely to boost
 Japan's economic growth relative to that of its
 major trading partners, although the benefits of
 lower prices may save Tokyo from having to aban-
 don its commitment to budget austerity.
 Meeting One-Half of a Policy
 Prescription: The Yen
 Economists have long argued that a combination of
 a strong yen and rapid economic growth, similar to
 that experienced in 1978-79, is needed to reduce
 Japan's trade and current account surpluses. The
 currency appreciation would-after a lag-in-
 crease the dollar price of exports and reduce the
 yen price of imports. An acceleration of economic
 activity in Japan relative to other nations, more-
 over, would rapidly boost Japanese imports-espe-
 cially manufactures-and also divert sales of some
 Japanese firms from the export to the domestic
 market. This combination of policies would be
 especially effective because Japanese exports, ex-
 cept for automobiles, respond relatively quickly to
 price increases, while Japanese imports respond to
 increased economic activity.
 The first half of this policy recipe is well underway.
 Since last fall's joint currency intervention by the
 Group of Five, the yen has appreciated by 25
 percent against the dollar and is close to its 1978
 record of 176 to the dollar. Small exporters, espe-
 cially hard hit by the stronger yen, are having

 Nonetheless, we expect the stronger yen to take a
 smaller bite out of Tokyo's trade surplus than it did
 in 1978-79:

 share gains of recent years, are passing only
 about half the increase in the yen's value to dollar

 Even Falling Oil Prices Cannot Save
 Economic Growth
 We do not expect Japanese economic growth to
 complement yen appreciation; instead it will proba-
 bly slow in 1986 relative to other OECD countries.
 The factors behind growth over the past two
 years-booming exports to the United States and
 China and investment in manufacturing capacity to
 supply these markets-were slowing even before
 the yen strengthened. The appreciation has there-
 fore reinforced these deflationary pressures. Be-
 cause government measures to offset this slowdown
 are not expected, most private Japanese forecasters
 believe the official growth projection of 4.0 percent
 for fiscal 1986-versus 4.4 percent last year-
 cannot be met. Despite recent promises by Prime
 Minister Nakasone and other politicians to use
 fiscal stimulus, any pump-priming measures are
 likely to be small. The stronger yen has allowed the
 Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy somewhat,
 but we doubt lower interest rates will do much to
 spur economic growth in a country already awash
 with surplus funds.
 Some Japanese policymakers have publicly hinted
 that a major effort to reflate the economy is
 unnecessary because the sharp drop in oil prices
 Japanese studies showing growth rising by a full
 will do the job. They cite
 percentage point in both 1986 and 1987-assuming
 average oil prices of $20 a barrel. We believe such
 estimates overstate the impact of falling oil prices
 on Japanese growth even though Japan depends
 more on oil imports than any other OECD country.
 Unless modified, government conservation mea-
 sures-including heavy taxes on energy use-will
 limit the drop in retail prices. Japanese utilities also
 are refusing to pass along to consumers most of
 their windfall gains from lower oil prices.

 Private Japanese forecasters expect the combina-
 tion of slower growth and the delayed impact of yen
 appreciation to push up both the current account
 surplus and the trade surplus with the United
 States in 1986, and we agree with this assessment.
 According to Japanese estimates, the bilateral
 trade surplus will reach $42-45 billion, while the
 global current account surplus is expected to jump
 to $60-65 billion. Any increase in Japanese imports
 from the United States because of the stronger yen
 will be muted by the economic slowdown. A sub-
 stantial portion of manufactures imports, moreover,
 are used in investment-which is slowing. Consum-
 er spending-another potential source of increased
 imports of manufactures-is sluggish and is unlike-
 ly to revive unless retail oil prices are cut sharply.
 If the yen stays at 180 and oil prices average $20 a
 barrel, our model indicates that Tokyo's current
 account surplus will widen to about $65-70 billion
 in 1987. Next year will probably be the first time
 the services account goes into surplus, reflecting
 interest earned on assets abroad.
 The model indicates that Japan's trade surplus with
 the United States will level off at about $45 billion
 next year. This forecast may be too optimistic:
 ? Falling energy costs will make Japanese exporters
 relatively more competitive, benefiting heavy en-
 ergy users such as automobile producers. The
 demise of energy-intensive sectors such as alumi-
 num may also be postponed.
 ? The investment boom of the past two years has
 decreased the production costs of major
 exporters.
 ? Growing Japanese equity investment in the Unit-
 ed States will, at least in the early stages, acceler-
 ate imports from Japan.

 Japan's Import Promotion Progra
 ri.._-.                     I                       __1           Japan: GNP and Import Growth,
 Japan has responded to foreign criticism about the
 low level of its manufactures imports-roughly half
 the US level of 5 percent of GNP-by periodically
 mounting import promotion campaigns. Unlike
 some earlier efforts, the government's latest import
 promotion program, which began in April 1985,
 has some teeth-administrative guidance from
 MITI urging the country's 134 top exporters to
 boost imports. The program has met with some
 success but so far does not appear to have funda-
 mentally changed the business community's atti-
 tude. Indeed, the mixed results raise some doubt
 about whether administrative guidance could play
 an effective role in boosting imports if Tokyo
 reversed its current position and decided to adopt
 formal import targets.
 Many of the trade packages unveiled by Japan
 since 1978 have included programs to increase
 manufactures imports. Some measures were merely
 cosmetic, such as exhibitions of imported products
 and government-sponsored missions to the United
 States and elsewhere to look for possible purchases.
 Others, such as "emergency imports" of uranium
 ore in 1978 and subsidies for raw materials pur-
 chases in 1982, were more substantive. Even so,
 these policies had little impact on Japan's overall
 import demand.
 This track record led Tokyo in 1985 to devise a new
 plan calling on the country's top exporters to boost
 their imports of manufactures. The initial adminis-
 trative guidance, issued in April 1985 by MITI,
 applied only to Japan's top 60 exporters but was
 expanded three months later to include 134 compa-

 generous. To support its case, MITI has spotlighted
 specific big-ticket purchases by key exporters, such
 as Nissan's purchase of a US supercomputer, and
 other companies' import plans.' In addition, the
 Ministry claims the ratio of manufactures imports
 to total imports of 31 percent recorded in 1985-a
 postwar high-is due to its promotion efforts. In
 fact, the ratio improved primarily because of the
 decline in dollar terms of overall imports-manu-
 are counting components made in the United
 States by their subsidiaries as fulfilling import
 targets.
 ? Many other purchases are from traditional US
 suppliers. A Toshiba official told the Embassy
 that only one of the 10 US companies with which
 it signed contracts on an October 1985 shopping
 trip was a new supplier.
 Worrisome Implications for Import Targets
 The current import promotion exercise is an impor-
 tant harbinger of the success of any more general
 import target program. Tokyo remains adamantly
 opposed to import targets, but, if that policy ever
 changed, we believe administrative guidance would
 be forced to play a key role in implementing a
 target scheme. For example, a strong yen and
 significant government pump priming by them-
 selves would be unable to boost Japan's share of
 manufactures imports to the US level of 5 percent
 of GNP. On the basis of our model of the Japanese
 economy, we estimate that a 10-percent nominal
 annual increase in government spending and a yen
 exchange rate of 180 to the dollar would push

 Restraint                                       ducers is in the offing. Non-OPEC free world production, including net
 Communist exports, has reached 27 million b/d and net exports are now 6.5
 million b/d. For OPEC to maintain current output without causing further
 price declines, non-OPEC producers would have to slash net exports by more
 than one-third, an unacceptably large reduction. Non-OPEC producers are a
 disparate group with a relatively small share of world oil trade and no formal
 mechanism for communication or coordination. The United Kingdom and
 Norway continue to be the focal point of OPEC criticism. Both, however, are
 sticking by their longstanding policies of not interfering in the oil market.
 LDCs, striving for energy self-sufficiency and needing the oil export earnings,
 are also unlikely to reduce output significantly. Competitive pressure and
 marketing problems may nevertheless cause some involuntary production cuts
 in the months ahead and force more flexible pricing arrangements. The
 impending seasonal decline in demand of up to 3 million b/d could temporarily
 push spot prices for some crudes as low as $10 per barrel in the next few
 months. Consequently, world oil prices are likely to average below $20 per
 barrel this year.

 difficulties-nearly ceased when Moscow refused to make its price competi-

 than $18 per barrel to at least two West European contract customers.
 Moscow's initial refusal to lower its price probably reflected hopes that world
 price declines would be temporary. Slightly increased Soviet oil production
 during January, the pressing need for hard currency, and recognition that
 crude oil prices might fall even further probably caused the USSR to accept a
 lower price. Moscow nevertheless may still resist offering its other contract
 customers similar terms or reentering the spot market.

 pending contract renegotiations, but Algiers will probably sue under interna-

 1985 earned Algiers nearly $1 billion and accounted for more than one-third
 of total Algerian gas exports and about one-fourth of French consumption.
 China Delays          According to the US Embassy, Chinese nuclear officials recently stated that a

 The delay represents a constriction of China's ambitious nuclear power

 however, that talks will continue with potential suppliers to find ways of

 Zambia Receives        Lusaka's adoption of an austerity budget probably was instrumental in

 reporting. The loans include a $265 million, two-year standby agreement and
 about $80 million in compensatory financing to help offset low copper export
 prices. The new budget, which was announced on 31 January, calls for steep
 cuts in recurrent expenditures to offset falling revenues and rising debt service.
 As a result, the deficit is budgeted to decline by one-third, compared with
 1985, to $275 million. The budget caps a string of major reform measures-
 highlighted by a foreign exchange auction and steep reductions in consumer
 subsidies-enacted since last fall in conformance with IMF recommendations.
 Despite these measures, Zambia continues to face massive foreign debt
 problems and on 5 March reached agreement with the Paris Club to
 reschedule its debts over a 10-year period with five years' grace.
 OECD Reaction to       OECD governments were cautious in their initial comments on the recent US
 US Investment          demarche for including investment issues in the new GATT round. The EC
 Initiative             Commissioner for External Affairs stated that a system of protection for
 investment is needed. Among the nations responding, Spain has been one of
 the most supportive. A member of the West German Government said,
 however, that most EC members believe the US proposals go too far, too
 quickly and cannot win acceptance by developing countries. Bonn and London
 also are concerned that hostile reaction toward investment by the developing
 nations will adversely affect New Round negotiations covering services issues.
 Most governments believe that if the United States is determined to bring up
 investment, it should concentrate on those issues related to trade-incentives,
 local content, and export requirements-rather than on the more contentious
 areas such as expropriation or entry barriers to investment.

 EC Farm Price         EC agriculture ministers will probably have an even more difficult time than
 Program in Disarray   usual reaching agreement on farm support prices this year. The EC Commis-
 sion's proposal to freeze most prices and reform provisions of the beef and
 grain sectors was greeted with universal hostility. West Germany, with
 elections looming, fears that the grain reforms-a 3-percent tax on production
 to finance export subsidies, tighter quality standards, and a shortened season
 during which the EC buys surplus farm production-are tantamount to a price
 cut that would lower farm incomes. Last year, the EC price negotiations were
 stymied by a German veto of a small cut in the price of grain. Italy complained
 that proposed cuts in the prices of Mediterranean products force southern
 member states to pay for the continued overproduction of northern crops.
 Despite the opposition, most of the price freeze, if not the reforms, is likely to
 be approved because of the need to reduce agricultural spending. The EC will
 still face a $670 million deficit in the agriculture budget caused by the impact
 of the falling dollar on EC export subsidy costs.

 resolve, including differences over intellectual property rights and access to
 Korea's insurance market. In addition, negotiations for renewal of the Multi-
 Fiber Arrangement (MFA) will begin in April. Although Hong Kong and
 Taiwan have agreed to discussions, it is unclear how they will respond to the

 growth in exports of cotton, wool, and manmade fibers from Taiwan.

 pensatory tax on foreign goods and adoption of the EC's less stringent value-
 added tax has made imported steel more competitive. EC officials blame the
 surge on Madrid's slowness in installing new customs registration and control
 mechanisms required by EC membership. This will probably be only the
 beginning of steel disputes betweeen Spain and its EC partners. The Spanish
 steel industry is undergoing a major and painful restructuring marked by
 major plant closings and layoffs. Under the EC accession accord, the Spanish
 steel industry may continue to receive government aid for three years but also
 faces quotas on sales to other EC countries. As yet, there are no Spanish
 import restrictions against EC steel.

 Cocoa Agreement        down in Geneva with the announcement by Ivory Coast, the world's largest
 Talks Collapse         producer, that it would not join the proposed new pact.
 (Negotiators also failed to resolve the split between producing
 and consuming nations on price stabilization levels and price adjustment
 mechanisms. The collapse of talks is likely to further weaken cocoa prices, now
 under $1 per pound. Failure to reach an accord before the current agreement
 expires on 30 September will force liquidation of ICCO stocks-estimated at
 100,000 metric tons or about one-fourth of global stocks-putting additional
 pressure on prices.

 suppliers of supercomputers worldwide.
 Japanese supercomputer sales increased sharply last year-in 1984 only four
 systems were shipped. Fujitsu, the leading Japanese vendor, has a total of
 about 20 systems either delivered or ordered to date. Last year, NEC claimed
 to have sold four systems, of which one has already been installed. In addition,
 Hitachi installed three supercomputers last year and has orders for at least two
 more. These sales have been to domestic as well as European and US buyers.
 By comparison, US firms shipped 38 systems in 1985. Because the Japanese
 supercomputers are roughly comparable to US systems in performance, we
 attribute some of the Japanese sales success to their willingness to underprice
 their US competitors. US supercomputer firms, which are small or lack the fi-
 nancial base to compete successfully in a price war with the Japanese, must
 maintain a clear-cut performance lead if they are to remain the major
 Italy Taxes Gasoline  The Italian Government decided late last month to allow businesses to reap the
 To Offset Lower       benefits of falling world oil prices but has raised taxes on retail sales of
 Oil Prices            gasoline, diesel fuel, and home heating oil to restrain consumption by
 households and raise public revenues. Italy still depends heavily on oil imports
 and stands to benefit more than other industrialized countries from the drop in
 oil prices. In early February, the Bank of Italy estimated that oil at $18 to $20
 per barrel would result in a $9.5 billion savings in Italy's energy import bill in
 1986-enough to put the current account into surplus. Although Rome is
 keeping retail prices high so as not to weaken an already lethargic oil
 substitution policy, it hopes industry will pass its lower costs on to the
 consumer to help bring down the annual inflation rate to the targeted 6
 percent.

 New Swedish            The Minister of Trade last week announced a new export control decree,
 Export Controls        effective 1 May. It will require exporters of certain foreign high-technology
 items with civilian and military applications, such as computers and data-
 processing equipment, to show permission from the producing country for
 reexport. Established Swedish firms with a record of protecting COCOM-
 controlled technology from diversion will be exempt. The decree is designed to
 stop diverters who use small trading firms to transfer COCOM-controlled
 equipment through Sweden to proscribed countries. Some Swedish officials
 fear that this accommodation to the West-particularly the United States-
 endangers Swedish neutrality. Customs officials and industry, however, favor
 the controls, which Stockholm hopes will protect Sweden's access to US high
 technology that is crucial to Sweden's industries, especially the defense sector.

 Small Salvadoran      US Embassy sources claim the 1985/86 crop amounts to just 200 million
 Coffee Harvest        pounds, almost 30 percent below last year. The coffee harvest-which may be
 the lowest in 30 years-has suffered because of continued depressed internal
 prices paid to producers, poor weather, and stepped-up guerrilla destruction of
 the crop. The Embassy reports that existing stocks and high world coffee prices
 should keep export revenues about equal to last year's level, but the poor crop
 would eliminate any possible windfall from the price increases. The poor
 harvest further weakens President Duarte's austerity program-already under
 attack from leftist labor and conservatives-which imposed additional taxes on
 coffee this year to benefit from increased export earnings.

 Economic Team          confidence in the new government. The US Embassy reported that Azcona's

 further reported that the cabinet's lack of technical expertise suggests the
 government may pursue populist policies. The first meeting of the economic
 cabinet reportedly was spent planning expanded public works projects and new
 housing construction. The lack of skillful advisers makes it unlikely that
 Azcona will face pressure from within his government to undertake needed
 austerity measures and weakens prospects for coherent economic decision

 Ugandan Economic       President Museveni has declared that his new government's primary economic
 Policies Take Form     objective is self-sufficiency. Although citing the importance of economic
 efficiency and the private sector, Museveni also has said that the government
 will continue to play an important role in the economy. Cabinet members in
 discussions with the US Embassy have advocated increases in agricultural
 producer prices, reductions in government spending, devaluation of the
 shilling, and a review of all parastatals. The US Embassy reports increased
 economic activity and business optimism since Museveni took over in January.
 Nonetheless, coffee exports-which generate about 90 percent of Uganda's
 foreign exchange earnings-are still lagging because of inadequate transport.
 Economic recovery is likely to proceed slowly despite the new regime's
 willingness to cooperate with donors and to encourage private enterprise. The
 regime must deal with resettlement of thousands of displaced persons,
 economic rehabilitation of areas savaged by previous governments, and
 continued violent opposition in the north.
 Mozambique Facing      Mozambique needs almost 200,000 metric tons of additional food aid deliver-
 Critical Food                                   ies between now and the end of June to avoid severe food shortages in urban
 Shortages              areas, according to US Embassy reporting. Because deliveries of this size-
 over and above the amounts already committed-are unlikely on short notice,
 the Embassy projects that wheat consumption will have to be reduced by two-
 thirds in March and April, and corn sales will have to be cut by one-half dur-
 ing March through June. The impending shortages are a result of natural
 disasters in recent years and heavy insurgent activity, which made the 1985
 crop one of the worst in 30 years. These factors will continue to depress
 harvests in 1986, even though rainfall has been only a little below average. As
 a result, Mozambican requirements for grain will total roughly 600,000 tons
 for the marketing year beginning in May.
 Indian                 India's FY 1986 (April-March) budget announced last week gives increased
 Budget Shifts          spending priority to India's poor and raises duties on some imports. The budget
 proposes an estimated 65-percent increase in spending on social welfare
 programs such as employment, education, housing, and rural development.
 Last year's "supply-side" budget emphasized lower tax rates, which paid off in
 higher revenues from greater economic activity and tax compliance. This year,
 New Delhi proposes to increase income tax deductions and ceilings, introduce
 value-added taxes, and revise the direct tax code in June. Although pleased
 with the tax measures, the business community is disappointed in proposed
 increases in duties, higher taxes on foreign joint-venture royalties, and the
 continuance of a surcharge on corporate income tax. The changed emphasis in
 this year's budget reflects both the administration's need to burnish its
 battered populist image and growing concern over the trade balance.

 Additional Indonesian  Finance Minister Prawiro last week stated publicly that the continued slide in
 Budget Cuts            oil prices may force the government to revise an already severe budget for the
 fiscal year beginning 1 April. According to US Embassy reporting, Prawiro
 has targeted further reductions in development expenditures and proposed
 canceling selected large capital-intensive projects. He also suggested that
 Jakarta might request aid donors to allow more funding of local costs. In
 addition, he firmly opposes foreign assistance tied to imports from the donor
 country. Prawiro's comments reflect the fact that oil revenue shortfalls-oil
 provides about 70 percent of tax revenues-have effectively curtailed Jakarta's
 ability to stimulate the domestic economy through expansionary fiscal policy.

 Future                 without significant drawdowns of foreign reserves-provided Jakarta contin-
 ues fiscal austerity. On the other hand, they argue that, if prices remain
 depressed for two years or more, the government could come under consider-
 able pressure to reschedule its $37 billion external debt-debt service pay-
 ments could reach $4.6 billion by 1988. Although we agree that low oil prices
 will seriously strain Indonesia's external accounts over the next few months, in
 our judgment Indonesia should experience gradual improvement in its overall
 financial position after 1987 as nonoil exports rally following increased
 economic activity in the industrialized countries spurred by lower energy costs.
 Although miffed that its creditworthiness is being questioned, Jakarta never-
 theless has no interest in joining a debtor cartel or tightening controls on
 foreign exchange flows, according to the US Embassy.

 Beijing Streamlines    Beijing has conducted a shakeup of the Ministry of Foreign Economic
 Trade Ministry         Relations and Trade (MOFERT), China's highest trade authority, probably to
 Leadership             help it reassert control over the foreign sector. Two of three vice ministers, two
 of three minister's representatives, and all five advisors were sacked. Minister
 Zheng Tuobin and Vice Minister Lu Xuejian held their positions, and
 Representative Wang Pinqing became one of two vice ministers. These
 changes may be a result of widespread dissatisfaction with MOFERT's
 inability to manage foreign trade. Critics of Deng Xiaoping's market-oriented
 economic reform policies blame China's record trade deficit-which reached
 $13.7 billion in 1985, according to Chinese Customs statistics-on the
 decentralization of trade authority. MOFERT's high-level personnel changes
 will have little effect in the near term on China's trade imbalance, however.
 Many of China's leading state corporations are not subordinate to MOFERT,
 making it difficult for the Ministry to rein them in.
 China Pushes           China's leadership has praised the successes of last year's rural reforms and
 Rural Reform           stated its determination to continue these policies. A report published by a
 joint Central Committee and State Council forum on rural work last
 December emphasized that "there must be no going back" despite problems
 such as declining grain output and increasing corruption. While no major new
 reforms were introduced, the document reaffirmed the government's commit-
 ment to agriculture, promising that the state will increase its investment in
 agriculture, channel rural industrial taxes into agriculture, and offer preferen-
 tial loans and fertilizer subsidies to grain producers. It also encourages the
 concentration of land into the hands of competent farmers and called for
 increased aid to poor areas.
 Chinese Feed Grain     Because of record feed exports from the north last year, southern China has
 Trade                  had to import considerable quantities of animal feedstuffs in the past few
 months. According to Chinese statistics, China exported more than 7 million
 metric tons of corn and soybeans in 1985, most of it to the USSR, South Ko-
 rea, and Japan. To fulfill these contracts, northeastern grain-producing
 provinces restricted interprovincial grain sales, which resulted in a shortage of
 animal feedstuffs in southern China. To counteract the impact on southern
 China's expanding livestock industry, Beijing has purchased 153,000 tons of
 US soybeans and 230,000 tons of Thai corn in the last three months. Industry
 experts expect the Chinese to purchase more soybeans and corn during the
 coming months.
