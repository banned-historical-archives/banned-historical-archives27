 The Third World War   CPYRGHT

 History a la Deutscher  F0IAb3b
 CPYRGHT
 On July 2 the Sunday Times of
 London  published  a  long  article
 under the head, "Dipw, Russia- China
 Clash Revealed," with the subhead:
 Khrushchev Accuses Mao: "Inciting
 World War." The author; in whose
 name a World
 Copyright,is
 'claimed, is given
 asZ
 sc,?_. author of
 talin, a Political
 Biography,' and a
 leading authority
 on Soviet affairs."
 This article was
 publisd  simul-
 taneously in the
 Washington Post
 & . Times - Herald
 and (in an abridged translation) in
 the most influential Italian news-
 paper, Corriera delta Sera of Milan.
 A complete French translation was
 carried in the July 4, 5, 6 issues of
 F7nce?-,Soir.  Headlined news dis-
 patches about the article appeared
 in most of the leading newspapers of
 the non-Communist world, including
 those in the United States. It may
 be presumed that copyrighter Deut-
 scher raked in a pretty penny for
 this latest scoop in the most im-
 aginative serial of the decade: The
 Myth of the Sino-Soviet Split (to be
 continued, and continued, and con-
 tinued).
 I ,ac Deutscher, a   rij;,citizen,
 is indeed a well-known writer on
 Soviet affairs, and undoubtedly is
 regarded by most persons active in
 these matters as "a leading    au-
 thority." He has written a political
 biography of Trotsky as well as of
 Stalin,  and numerous        other books
 on Soviet and Communist matters.
 These have been published by the
 Oxford University Press and other
 reputable  houses,  respectfully re-
 viewed in the scholarly as well as
 commercial media, and assigned as
 texts to students seeking enlighten-
 ment on things Soviet. Deutscher has
 been a visiting lecturer at Harvard
 ~s
 JAMES BURNHAM
 and other American universities. (A
 grant from the Rockefeller Founda-
 tion enabled him to pursue his re-
 searches at Harvard and the Hoover
 Library for his Trotsky biography.)
 His  articles,  which  have  been
 printed in many magazines, have
 lately been appearing in The Report-
 er, the English New Statesman, and
 in Encounter, published in London by
 the  American-supported  Congress
 for Cultural Freedom.
 It should be added that acceptance
 of Deutscher's role as a leading au-
 thority is not quite universal. The
 French magazine, Est & Ouest, which
 is as precise in its language as in its
 scholarship, comments on his achieve-
 ments as follows: "What above all
 characterizes  the  works  of  this
 `Sovietologue' is the distortion of the
 past by the falsification of facts; and
 of the present, by fictions. As for his
 predictions, they are systematically
 refuted by events." In witness there-
 of, Est & Ouest cites Deutscher's
 finding,  after  Stalin's death,  that
 Beria was the leading "liberal re-
 former," and Khrushchev the die-
 hard chief of "the Stalinist wing." At
 the close of the 20th Congress of the
 Russian Communist Party, Deutscher
 reported (on the basis of his ever
 mysterious, s cret, and always un~.
 named sources) that Khrushchev had
 "fiercely refused" to "repudiate his
 dead leader." The 20th Congress was
 the gathering at which Khrushchev
 was in actuality delivering the his-
 toric attack on Stalin and Stalinism
 that  became  public  a  couple  of
 months later.
 Eeny, Meeny, Mao
 More recently, Deutscher told in
 The Reporter exactly what the Al-
 gerian FLN leader, Ferhat Abbas,
 and Mao Tse-tung had said to each
 other during Abbas' visit to Peiping.
 That the Deutscher account differed
 totally from that which Abbas him-
 self printed somewhat later in the
 Tunisian magazine Afrique-Action is
 scoop is a fierce attack on Mao Tse
 tung  which  Khrushchev compose
 and circulated among the leadershi
 of a number of Communist parties
 The Sunday Times (et al.) article s
 characterizes the secret document
 and presents, partly in direct quote
 partly  in seeming paraphrase,  th
 secret content.
 "A new and momentous quarrel,
 announces Deutscher in his introduc
 tory paragraph, "has broken out be
 tween Russia and China, and Nikit
 Khrushchev has been directing a hug
 ricane fire of accusations against Ma
 Tse-tung. He charges the leader o
 Chinese Communism with `disloyal
 ty,' `subversive agitation,' and `incite
 ment to world war.' He also threaten
 Mao that he will at last bring into th
 open their protracted and hithert
 secret or semi-secret dispute."
 Within a couple of days after pub
 lication-too late to counteract th
 political effect of this latest chapte
 of the Sino=Soviet myth, or, pre
 sumably, to interfere with Deutscher'
 fee-several  French  observers ha
 remarked  a  curious  coincidence
 Deutscher's secret Khrushchev docu.
 merit read just like a free Englis
 translation of a text printed severs
 weeks earlier in the June-July issu
 (prce,_. one New Franc)  of Voi

 position  Trotskyite-'I'itoist) Frenc
 Communists. This text, in turn, wa
 traced 'back to a semi-secret pam-
 phlet called "For Ideological Unit
 in the World Communist Movement,'
 which ' (with specific references t
 certain French Communists not four
 in the subsequent versions) was cir-
 culated  among  oppositionists  an
 French Party members just befog
 the May  Congress  of the French
 Communist Party.
 In a key passage, for example, th
 French (VC) text reads:
 Lorsque  l'interet des forces so
 cialistes du monde entier et de
 peuples exploites des pays capitaliste
 rendait plus necessaire que jamai

 As far as it goes, .the new m ' al law sounds reason-
 able, but can it go far enough? he problem of ethical
 conduct in high places will re . ain with us as long

 the problem is proportional to th power enjoyed by
 the officials involved. As more      more inside in-
 formation seeps into Washington;                     more and more
 business is transacted through re  latory agencies;
 as larger and larger sums of money re dispersed by
 off=icials earning Civil Service wage  as more and
 more commercial decisions rest up   federal ap-
 proval; so more and more temptatio   rise up to
 distract the Washington 'officialdom. It the swell-

 an underground river, feeds the rotting 'ungle we
 see above ground. The. White House wo d attack

 point by the Village Voice, both Mrs. Rosemary
 McGrath, chairman of the YAF chapter, and George
 Sokolsky, its elder statesman, answered "Yes," and
 gave their reasons. Came quickly a letter of pro-

 chinois comme une trahison, comme

 intdrets de la Chine populaire a ceux

 And  the  corresponding  Sunday
 Times text: "'When our interests
 .. . ,' Moscow goes on to say, `more
 than ever demanded from us a de-
 termined policy of coexistence with
 the countries hostile to socialism, the
 leadership of the Chinese Communist
 parties denounced our every initia-
 tive in this direction as treason, as
 appeasing the invaders of Formosa,
 or as a sacrifice of the interests of the
 USSR.' "
 By one more coincidence, the same
 issue of Voie communiste printed
 an article by Deutscher himself.
 Deutscher was caught so far out
 on his limb that on July 23 he had
 to make public an "explanation." He'
 admitted that VC had printed a
 document closely similar to "the one
 he had cited." But he denied that
 the  VC  text  was  his  "principal
 source." He had got hold of another
 most secret document from some un-
 namable spot, and had learned the
 background from an unnamed "im-
 portant Communist," etc.
 Branko Lazitch, one of the few
 serious scholars of Communist and
 Soviet history, has placed a number
 vincing that they might be, but all
 things are possible in the fairyland
 of Sovietology.
 The last, big similar sensation in
 the construction .of. the Sino-Soviet
 'myth was launched last February
 over the by-line of another "leading
 authority on Soviet affairs, Edward
 Crankkshaw, in The Observer (Lon-
 don),  and. escalated  by  Harry
 Schwartz in the New York Times.
 The document in that case-wherein
 Crankshaw and Schwartz quite prob-
 ably acted in good, if too uncritical,
 faith-showed on analysis such ig-
 norance of Communist ways that we
 may, infer a non-Communist origin.
 CIA, an early convert to the Sino-.
 a'oviet myth (partly thinking it truth,
 partly  hoping  that getting  people
 to believe it will make it truth), has
 been suggested as a likely source.
 M.      Lazitch shows  by     textual
 analysis that the document which
 Deutscher borrowed was probably
 prepared by Titoists. This hypothesis
 is further indicated by the circum-
 stances of its pre-Deutscher appear-
 ances, and has been explicitly af-
 firmed by Auguste Lecoeur, a well-
 known French oppositionist.
 The few emendations that Deut-
 scher has made in the earlier text
 are not without their political in-
 terest. He has shifted the language
 somewhat, to play up the friendly
 and politically close relation which
 the VC text declares to exist be-
 tween Tito and Moscow as against
 the provocateurs, wild men, and war-
 mongers'of China and Albania. And
 he has strengthened the language in
 which the VC text refers to Mao's
 bellicosity. The VC text, for example,
 states that according to Mao "there
 has been no change whatever in the
 nature of imperialism since the end
 of the second World War," so that
 "the threat of war" (le danger de
 guerre)  is still present-orthodox
 truisms with which no Communist of
 any tendency would disagree. Deut-
 scher upgrades the formulation to
 read that "an armed conflict between
 capitalism and Communism is inevit-
 terms, "even if that should lead to
 war."
 But the most significant and im-
 aginative addition updates the text
 by adding a reference to Berlin-
 which was not of course in sharp
 focus when the original texts were
 prepared. It is "in part because of
 the Chinese pressure" that Khrush-
 chev has adopted the "hard foreign
 policy" expressed by the demands on
 Berlin. "The necessity of competing
 with Mao Tse-tung for leadership in
 the Communist camp is an important
 factor  in  the  decision  taken  by
 Khrushchev" to act in relation to
 Berlin.  This  "difficult  and  com-
 plicated" Berlin maneuver is "os-
 tensibly directed solely against the
 West, but in reality is also directed
 against China."
 The underlying political meaning
 of the whole operation is summarized
 by M. Lazitch: "Thus, they are trying
 to shut the West in a false dilemma:
 choose between Mao, who presses
 toward the Third. World War, and
 Khrushchev,  who,  modestly,  asks
 only a change in the status of Ber-
 lin."
 Two final notes:
 1) With only one or two excep-
 tions, the great newspapers of the
 Western world, which once more
 allowed themselves to be used as
 propaganda  megaphones  for  the
 Communist enterprise (and dupes of
 unscrupulous journalists), have made
 no correction or apology, or-we may
 safely guess-any plans for caution
 in the future.
 2) Some of the most thoroughly
 of paragraphs from the VC and Sun-  able in the future.' Therefore the  informed observers of these matters
 day Times texts, comparable to the  USSR should "make use of its pres-  believe that  IA  learning nothing

 probably dominate the political scene
 today. This issue affects only a small
 area, the -central part of the Tyrol
 (misnamed the South Tyrol), but
 deeply disturbing events often have
 modest origins.
 The origins of this
 quarrel, seeming-
 ly affecting only
 small, happy-go-
 lucky                     Austria
 (pleasantly pre-
 occupied with its
 sudden  prosper-
 ity)  and                 Italy,
 with a population
 seven  times  as
 large, are simple.
 In 1919 Italy was given the Italian-
 speaking                       South  Tyrol  (Trentino)
 and  the  German-.speaking     Aus-
 trian Tyrol very much against the
 wishes  of the    latter population.
 During the  thirties,  Fascist Italy
 brutally oppressed.  the    German-
 speaking people of the Central Tyrol,
 this time with the connivance of Hit-
 ler, who had the renegade's hatred
 for his native Austria plus expansio
 toward the East in his mind.

 tral Tyrol resettled in the Ca
 regions and in the Crim
 After World War II,
 high-flown ideals of
 Charter were so prom
 played, the Central Tyroleans, with
 a fine record of resistance against
 Fascists and Nazis alike, hoped for
 liberation and reunion wit} .the Aus-
 trian Tyrol. But Britain, then- under
 a Labor government, and Moscow,
 fearing  that  reintegration  of  the
 staunchly conservative and religious
 Central Tyrol would strengthen the
 Right in Austria, vetoed this terri-
 torial adjustment.
 The denial of freedom to the Cen-
 tral Tyroleans was so flagrant that
 treaty was signed between defeated
 Italy and liberated Austria, granting
 to  the  German-speaking  Central
 Tyroleans the right to manage their
 own affairs.
 Italy, however, fearful that au-
 tonomy might be the first step toward
 a reunification with Austria, "inter-
 preted" the autonomy status in an
 exceedingly clever way. It lump
 together the Central Tyrol and
 Italian-speaking Trentino and   Ave
 autonomy to the entire region/-This
 looked magnanimous at firs p4gkance,
 but in practice it made for Italian
 majority in the Diet-a s `ndid ex-
 ample of gerrymanderi   The Cen-
 tral Tyroleans, cheat   of true au-

 Socialists, part   s in the coalition

 patriotic  ustrians, and joint confer-

 ment  is  willing  to  grant  every
 imaginable minor concession save
 autonomy and to encourage by any
 and all means the further immigra-
 tion of Italians into the artificially in-
 dustrialized Central Tyrol.
 Since we are living in a democratic
 age, the aim of the Italian Govern-
 ment is to create an Italian majority.
 Once the valleys of the Central Tyrol
 will be filled with Italian factory
 hands, it will be easy enough to stage
 a plebiscite demonstrating that the
 people of this area no longer desire
 local autonomy. The Italian popula-
 tion has risen from three per cent in
 1919 to 36 per cent in 1961, and it is
 against these figures as much as any-
 thing that the SVP, the Party of the
 Autonomists, is waging a desperate
 battle.

 stations,  and

 ter all, is led by the moderates-
 the truly radical elements among the
 Tyroleans have come to the fore and
 have  resorted to  a reprehensible
 "propaganda of action." It must, how-
 ever, be said in the latter's defense
 that world opinion ignored the entire
 issue until the first dynamite sticks
 went off, the first high voltage pylons
 crumbled, and the first hydroelectric
 plants were damaged.
 In countering these terrorist tac-
 tics, the Italians, so far, have only
 killed accidentally' a couple of in-
 nocents, but it seems now that they
 are  out  to  make  martyrs;  every
 measure they have taken up to now
 has led to further alienation, further
 loss of friends or well-wishers. The
 arrest and keeping in jail for 42 days
 of an Austrian civil servant on vaca-
 tion, a woman and a true moderate
 in Central Tyrolean affairs; the cur-
 fews; the reintroduction of visas for
 Austrians (a measure ruinous to the
 talian tourist trade) ; the refusal to
 admit an international investigation
 commission;  the proposed law to
 exile the victims of the Hitler-Mus-
 solini agreement for "anti-national"
 behavior-all this has weakened their
 position.
 The attitude of the Italian Govern-
 ment not only has forced the rather
 reluctant hand of the Austrian So-
 cialists; it has invoked the specter
 of something infinitely worse: Ger-
 an intervention. This does not mean
 that the Bonn Government will step
 in because the big parties of Ger-
 many  (with the exception of the
 Liberal FDP) are fearful of being
 ccused of Pan-Germanism. But in
 Europe people of the same (or even
 f a closely kindred) language have
