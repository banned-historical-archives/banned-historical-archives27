come and good wishes for the outstand-

INTER-AMERICAN BAR 
ASSOCIATION 
Mr. PEPPER. Mr. Speaker, I com-
mend and thank my colleagues for the 
adoption of House Concurrent Resolu-
tion 349 of which our distinguished col-
league, Mr. SANTIAGO POLANCO-ABREU, 
the Resident Commissioner of Puerto 
Rico is the author, and of which I have 
a companion resolution, House Concur-
rent Resolution 354, expressing the wel-
come of the Congress of the United 
States to the Inter-American Bar As-
sociation to its 14th conference to be 
held at the beautiful city of San Juan 
In the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
May 22-29. The Inter-American Bar 
Association composed of members of 
the bar of the United States and all 
the Latin American countries except-
ing Cuba, of course, while it retains its 
Communist character, who banded to-
gether for the development of the law 
and legal institutions to forward the 
Peace and the prosperity of the Ameri-
cas. I am proud to be a member of the 
Inter-American Bar Association and to 
haVe attended the Inter-American Bar 
Association Conference in Bogota some 
4 years ago. I look forward with par-
ticular pleasure to attending the im-
pending conference in San Juan. 
Today, as we seek to establish peace 
through law and to build a world gov-
erned by law it is essential that we em-
phasize the role of the law in the build-
ing of a peaceful and a better world. 
Lawyers have always been the architects 
of institutions to progress the cause of 
peace and a better life for mankind. To-
day the troubled and still, I regret to 
say, lawless world challenges the genius 
of the lawyers of all lands who believe 
in the supremacy of law over the con-
duct of nations as well as men. The 
lawyers of the Western Hemisphere have 
much to offer in the building of such in-
stitutions. The Honorable Roy Ballant, 
of Washington, D.C., founder of the In-
ter-American Bar Association, is to be 
commended for bringing the lawyers of 
the free nations of our Hemisphere, ex-
cept Canada, into this Inter-American 
Bar Association. Much good has this 
association accomplished. Greater ac-
complishments lie ahead for it. 
I am sure the San Juan Conference in 
the inspiring Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico will do much to hasten the day of 
which Mr. Justice Jackson spoke in his 
opening statement at the Nuremberg 
trials when "every man shall live by no 
man's leave underneath the law." 
SITUATION 
(Mr. BO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 min-
ute and to revise and extend his re-
.) 
Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Speaker, I com-
mend the attention of the Members of 
this great body to the remarks made by 
the President of the United States on 
yesterday at his press conference rela-
tive to the crisis in Vietnam. This, of 
course, has been a subject of continuing 
discussion on the part of the American 
People. 
The President on yesterday, Mr. 
Speaker, spelled out the policy of this 
Government to maintain freedom in that 
part of the world and elsewhere against 
Communist aggression. He restated the 
policy first laid down in his speech at 
Baltimore recently. To those who have 
been critical of our policy, I suggest that 
they read the press conference statement 
In full. I know that Members of this 
body, on both sides of the aisle, have gen-
erally supported the position taken by 
the President. And I am happy to note 
that in public opinion polls taken in 
depth throughout the Nation very re-
cently, the American people support the 
President of the United States. 
The foreign policy of our Government 
must indeed be a bipartisan foreign 
policy and I hope the American people 
generally will read this statement and 
understand the issue before our Nation. 
Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. BOGGS. I am happy to yield to 
the distinguished majority leader. 
Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Speaker, I join the 
distinguished gentleman from Louisiana 
in the statement he is making and I 
associate myself with his remarks. In 
his statement yesterday the President 
once again enunciated the aims and as-
pirations of the United States with re-
spect to the crucial struggle in Vietnam. 
He stressed our determination to help a 
free country remain free. He stressed 
yet again that our fundamental purpose 
Is to achieve a peaceful settlement that 
will permit the people of this area to 
live their lives in freedom and security. 
I would like to associate myself with this 
objective and under leave to extend my 
remarks I include the statement made 
by the President on yesterday: 
STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT 
We are engaged in a crucial struggle in 
Vietnam. 
Some may consider it a small war. But 
to the men who give their lives, it is the last 
war. And the stakes are huge. 
Independent South Vietnam has been at-
tacked by North Vietnam. The objective of 
that attack is conquest. 
Defeat in South Vietnam would be to 
deliver a friendly nation to terror and re-
pression. It would encourage and spur on 
those who seek to conquer all free nations 
within their reach. Our own welfare and 
our own freedom would be in danger. 
This is the clearest lesson of our time. 
From Munich until today we have learned 
that to yield to aggression brings only great-
er threats?and more destructive war. To 
stand firm is the only guarantee of lasting 
peace. 
At every step of the way we have used our 
great power with the utmost restraint. We 
have made every effort to find a peaceful 
solution. 
We have done this in the face of the most 
outrageous and brutal provocation against 
Vietnamese and Americans alike. 
- Through the first 7 months of 1964, both 
Vietnamese and Americans were the tar-
gets of constant acts of terror. Bombs ex-
ploded in helpless villages, in downtown 
movie theaters, even at a sports field. Sol-
diers and civilians, men and women, were 
murdered and crippled. Yet we took no ac-
tion against the source of this brutality?
North Vietnam. 
When our destroyers were attacked in the 
Gulf of Tonkin, we replied with a single 
raid. The punishment was limited to the 
dead. 
For the next 6 months we took no ac-
tion against North Vietnam. We warned of 
danger; we hoped for caution in others. 
The answer was attack, and explosions, and 
Indiscriminate murder. 
It soon became clear that our restraint was 
viewed as weakness. Our desire to limit con-
flict was viewed as a prelude to surrender. 
We could no longer stand by while attack 
Mounted; and while the bases of the attack-
ers were immune from reply. 
And so, we began to strike back. But we 
have not changed our essential purpose. 
That purpose is peaceful settlement. That 
purpose is to resist aggression. That pur-
pose is to avoid wider war. 
I say again that I will talk to any govern-
ment, anywhere, and without any conditions; 
if any doubt our sincerity, let them test it. 
Each time we have met with silence, slan-
der, or the sound of guns. 
But just as we will not flag in battle, we 
will not weary in the search for peace. 
I reaffirm my offer of unconditional dis-
cussions. We will discuss any subject, and 
any point of view, with any government con-
cerned. 
This offer may be rejected, as it has been 
in the past. But it will remain open; wait-
ing for the day when it becomes clear to all 
that armed attack will not yield domination 
over others. 
And I will continue along the course we 
have set; firmness with moderation; readi-
ness for peace with refusal to retreat. 
For this is the same battle which we have 
fought for a generation. Wherever we have 
stood firm, aggression has been halted, peace 
restored, and liberty maintained. 
This was true under President Truman, 
President Eisenhower, and President Ken-
nedy. 
And it will be true again in southeast 
Asia. 
Mr. GERALD R. FORD. Mr. Speaker 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. BOGGS. I am happy to yield to 
the distinguished minority leader. 
Mr. GERALD R. FORD. As the gen-
tleman from Louisiana has noted, both 
privately and publicly I have supported 
the President's present firm policy in 
Vietnam. It is also fair to state that 
all Members of our party on this side of 
the aisle in the House have supported 
the present course of action in Vietnam. 
This is a critical and serious situation 
that demands our MaxinIUM; strength 
both at home and in Vietnam. In this 
instance particularly, I feel we should 
have a very high degree of bipartisanship 
In order to convince the opponents, the 
Communists, that they should not mis-
calculate the intentions of America. If

his colleagues of his party for their 
statesmanship.

BIRTHDAY GREETINGS TO AN 
ELDER STATESMAN 
(Mr. MATSUNAGA asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and tO revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MATSUNAGA. Mr. Speaker, al-
though this day has not been declared a 
national holiday, it should not go by 
without our observing that it was on this 
day, April 28, 83 years ago, that a great 
Americaniand An elder statesman was 
born?a man younger and more agile in 
mind and spirit than many a man half 
his age?our eminent colleague, the gen-
tleman from Illinois, the Honorable 
BARRATT O'HARA. 
A man of tremendous driving force and 
energy, he continues to serve his Na-
tion and his constituents with amazing 
vigor. He possesses those indispensable 
elements of statesmanship, independ-
ence, and personal courage. He never 
hesitates to speak out on his personal 
convictions, whatever the trend of cur-
rent public opinion may be. 
We in, this Chambey have often sat 
spellbound by the force and eloquence of 
his speeches. 
Few men in public life possess the 
wealth of experience in diverse fields that 
BARRATT O'HARA possesses?in journal-
ism, radio broadcasting, law, politics, and 
BARRATT O'HARA has distinguished him-
self as one of the greatest criminal law-
yers this country has known, a reputable 
magazine editor, a well-known radio 
commentator, the youngest Lieutenant 
Governor in the history of the great State 
of Illinois, and as the only veteran of 
the Spanish-American War now serving 
In Congress. He is also a veteran of 
World War I. 
As Lieutenant Governor of Illinois and 
as the presiding officer of the State sen-
ate, he commenced an investigation into 
the wages paid to working women,. This 
pioneer work in the field of women's 
rights resulted in giving the whole mini-
mum wage movement its impetus. The 
'administration, in which he played a 
major role, established the first public 
utilities commission in Illinois. 
BARRATT O'HARA entered his career 
the Congress of the United States at an 
age when most men think only of re-
tirement, at a youthful age of 66. He 
has singe_ then given to the Nation in-
valuable service as a legislator totally 
committed to the public good. 
As a Representative from the 50th 
State, I feel deeply indebted to BARRATT 
O'HARA for his eloquent and moving pleas 
which he made in support of Hawaiian 
statehood. The Honolulu Star-Bulletin 
singled out his speech delivered on this 
floor in 1950 as the most effective made 
in behalf of Hawaiian statehood in the 
81st Congress and printed it in three in-
stallments, He eloquently stated at that 
time: 
The pattern of the Old World of the horse 
and buggy should be modernized even in the 
matter of selecting territories to be taken 
into the Union of the States. My faith is 
in my country and the purity of its purpose 
to ask nothing for its own people that it 
does not seek to make possible for all men to 
attain in a world of brotherhood. 
Mr. Speaker, BARRATT O'HARA 011 his 
83d birthday abounds in spirit and imag-
ination which the young in age can well 
emulate, as we struggle for the attain-
ment of the Great Society. 
As one who has enjoyed a close per-
sonal friendship with BARRATT O'HARA, I 
fervently hope that he will continue to 
serve his country and his constituency in 
Congress until he is 100?as he has vowed 
to do. God knows the world needs men 
of BARRETT O'HARA'S caliber, integrity, 
understanding, and foresight. 
Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. MATSUNAGA. I yield to the dis-
tinguished majority leader. 
Mr. ALBERT. I am happy that our 
colleague from Hawaii has taken this 
time to pay tribute to one of the finest, 
noblest men I have ever known. I as-
sociate myself with the remarks of my 
friend from Hawaii. BARRATT O'HARA's 
careers have been as distinguished as 
they have been varied. I doubt that 
there is a single other person in public 
life in America today who has seen life 
from so many angles and who has appre-
ciated its challenges as much as the 
gentleman from Illinois [Mr. O'HARA]. 
One of the most articulate men I have 
ever known, one of the most courageous 
men, one of the sweetest characters on 
earth, BARRATT O'HARA?may he live long 
and may his ideals continue to prosper. 
Mr. MATSUNAGA. I thank the 
majority leader. 
(Mr. PEPPER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. PEPPER. Mr. Speaker, I merely 
wish to associate myself with the de-
served tribute which has been paid to 
this noble colleague of ours, Mr. BARRATT 
O'HARA, from Illinois. His eloquence, his 
nobility of spirit, his lofty idealism con-
stitute an example and an inspiration 
not only for his colleagues but also for 
his countrymen. May his days continue 
to be long and fruitful in this Chamber 
and upon the earth. 
Mr. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. PEPPER. I yield to the gentle-
man from California. 
Mr. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I should 
like to associate myself with the remarks 
of the distinguished gentleman from 
Florida. I cannot express them as well 
or as eloquently as he, but I join him in 
paying tribute to my great leader, the 
great BARRATT O'HARA. 
Mr. EDMONDSON. Mr. Speaker, will 
the gentleman yield? 
8359 
Mr. PEPPER. I yield to the gentle-
man from Oklahoma. 
Mr. EDMONDSON. I thank the gen-
tleman. 
I, -too, welcome the opportunity to join 
in this expression of love and admiration 
for the great colleague from Illinois 
whose eloquence continually stirs this 
legislative body. 
I believe if there could appropriately 
be given a name to this outstanding 
Member of the House, it would be "the 
happy warrior of the Congress of the 
United States." 
Congressman O'HARA is a great legisla-
tor, a great humanitarian, a great 
speaker, and a great individual. It is a 
continuing source of pleasure and in-
spiration to serve with him in this body. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, will 
the gentleman yield? 
Mr. PEPPER. I yield to the gentle-
man from New Jersey. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I 
should like to associate myself with the 
remarks of the distinguished gentleman 
from Florida. As a member of the House 
Committee on Foreign Affairs who has 
served on the committee with Congress-
man O'HARA, I want all Members to know 
and the RECORD to include that no one 
makes a finer contribution to the com-
mittee and no one engenders a more 
?humane spirit in the legislation which 
emanates from the House Committee on 
Foreign Affairs than BARRATT O'HARA. 
BARRATT O'HARA served in the great 80th 
Division during World War I. Its motto 
was "The 80th Only Moves Forward." 
One of the reasons it always did was 
BARRATT O'HARA. BARRATT has always 
moved forward for his fellow man and 
still does. I hope he continues to do so 
for many years to come. 
Mr. JOELSON. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. PEPPER. I yield to the gentle-
man from New Jersey. 
Mr. JOELSON. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to associate myself with the remarks 
made. The thing which has always im-
pressed me most about Mr. O'HARA is his 
youthful spirit and his youthful outlook. 
I know how many years he claims, but I 
also know he is not a man who looks 
back. He always looks forward. I think 
some "young fogies" could well benefit 
from this youthful, effervescent spirit. 
It has been a pleasure to work with him. 
(Mr. WRIGHT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I simply 
want to join our colleagues in this well 
deserved tribute so deeply felt by all of 
our Members for our colleague, BARRATT 
O'HARA. His alert, inquisitive mind 
and his high-spirited idealism mark him 
as a young man. BARRATT O'HARA will 
always be a young man. 
As one Member of this House, I shall 
treasure always the opportunities I have 
enjoyed to visit With BARRATT O'HARA 011 
numerous occasions. I feel myself richer 
for having been exposed to his wealthy 
store of knowledge and his magnificently 
charitable spirit. 
His mind and his heart are big. His 
vision is broad. And his friendship is 
truly a thing to treasure. ,

(Mr. CONTE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CONTE. Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to join with my colleagues in extending 
my greeting to the gentleman from Illi-
nois, BARRATT O'HARA, on his birthday. I 
think one of the finest things that can 
be said about a man is that he is a good 
man. In my book BARRATT O'HARA is a 
good man. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to wish him 
many, many decades of good health, hap-
piness, and success so that in the golden 
years of life he may harvest the rich divi-
dends and spiritual satisfaction which he 
has so ably earned in a lifetime of dedi-
cated service to his State and his country. 
Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Speaker, will 
the gentleman yield? 
Mr. CONTE. I yield to the gentleman 
from New Hampshire. 
Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to associate myself with the re-
marks of the gentleman froin Massa-
chusetts [Mr. CONTE] and the other 
Members here who have paid well de-
served tribute to the gentleman from 
Illinois, my distinguished and indomi-
table calleague [Mr. O'HaRal. His ready 
wit and perceptive comment have added 
much to our deliberations and I am 
grateful to him for his constructive con-
tributions to this body. 
Mr. REID of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. CONTE. I yield to the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. REID of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to associate myself with the 
remarks of the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts and the gentleman from New 
Hampsbtre and the gentleman from 
Hawaii and very simply say to My good 
friend and distinguished colleague BAR-
RATT O'HARA that-I greatly value his 
friendship. He is a man of principle, 
conviction, and courage. He has en-
nobled this House by his courage and 
his actions. 
I might say he has always been 
a stanch friend of Israel, the only democ-
racy in the Near East. His support of 
that country has meant much to the 
course Of freedom in the Near East. 
I would merely add, BARRATT, I hope 
that you not only prosper in your im-
portant work in this House for many 
years but in congratulating you on your 
birthday, may I wish that you live to 
be 120 years young. 
Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. CONTE. I yield to the gentleman 
from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts yielding to me. I wish to join 
in paying tribute to BARRATT O'HARA to-
day. He and I belong to a rather exclu-
sive club, I think, perhaps with one or 
two other Members, not the Spanish-
American War veterans but, rather, the 
former lieutenant governors of our re-
spective States, which we were at almost 
the same time. Of course, BARRATT and 
I are about the same age? give or take 
20 or 30 years. However, for a time when 
he first came to Congress--and I think 
I should say this for the benefit of the 
other Members of the House in case there 
is any question in your mind as to his 
ability?I managed him. When I say I 
managed him I mean I was in charge of 
booking all of the various prizefights 
and fisticuffs in which he engaged. He 
was known in the prize ring and up and 
down the eastern seaboard as "Kin" 
O'HARA. He packed a very great wallop 
and we had a lot of fun out of it. "KID," 
I hope you continue in good shape and 
in good condition and that you do your 
roadwork regularly and keep your legs 
sound and hold your left out in Lout of 
you a little bit and watch out for those 
right uppercuts. I think you will finish 
the course all right. Congratulations.

GENERAL LEMIE TO EXTEND 
Mr. MADDEN. Mr. Speaker, I, too, 
wish to join the many Members of Con-
gress who would like to pay tribute to 
the gentleman from Illinois, BARRATT 
O'HARA, on his 83d birthday. I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members who 
wish to pay tribute to him may extend 
their remarks at this point in the RECORD. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. AL-
BERT) . Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Indiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MADDEN. In addition to what 
my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio, 
Congressman BROWN, has stated as to 
being a member of the exclusive club of 
former Lieutenant Governors, I want to 
point out that BARRATT O'HARA was 
elected Lieutenant Governor of Illinois 
in 1912. A great number of Members 
do not know that he was the first public 
official in the Nation to expose the slave 
labor conditions in the child labor sweat-
shops. 
Lt. Gov. BARRATT O'HARA pioneered the 
first public hearings that exposed to the 
Nation the fact that children were work-
ing in those days at starvation wages in 
the sweatshops of the city of Chicago 
and also throughout the Nation. He 
was the pioneer public official who spon-
sored legislation that did away with the 
sweatshops in that early day. 
He not only accomplished a great deal 
as Lieutenant Governor of Illinois, but 
he was also one of the great lawyers of 
the Middle West and was associated for 
a number of years with Clarence Dar-
row in the practice of law. 
He also was nationally known as a 
newspaperman and his writings were 
published by newspapers and magazines 
throughout the Nation before and dur-
ing World War I. 
Mr. Speaker, he is the only Spanish-
American War veteran in the Congress 
of the United States. We all hope that 
BARRATT O'HARA will be a Member of this 
body for many, many years to come and 
we congratulate him on his 83d birthday 
today. 
Mr. HUNGATE. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. MADDEN. I yield to the gentle-
man. 
Mr. HUNGATE. We, from Missouri, 
are proud to offer the gentleman from 
Illinois, BARRATT O'HARA, as an example 
of the benefits to be derived from attend-
ing Missouri University. He was not 
only a great fighter, but he was the best 
football player pound for pound that at-
tended that school. We commend his 
career to everyone. 
Mrs. KELLY. Mr. Speaker, the great 
State of Illinois is known as the Land 
of Lincoln and, in this day, it has given 
other great men to our Nation and to 
public service. 
I refer to two gentlemen whom I have 
the good fortune to have as my friends 
and' colleagues, the Honorable WILLIAM 
L. DAWSON and the Honorable BARRATT 
O'HARA. Both of these Representatives 
serve their country well and both of them 
have celebrated their birthdays this 
week. 
I join my colleagues in wishing them 
the best of health, happiness, and all 
good fortunes for many years to come. 
Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to take this opportunity to join my col-
leagues in paying tribute to an outstand-
ing Member of this body, the Honorable 
BARRATT O'HARA, on the occasion of his 
83d birthday. 
We in the House are fortunate indeed 
to have among us a man whose outstand-
ing career is certain to merit him a place 
in American history. There are few in-
deed who are privileged to have had so 
much adventure and to have given so 
much service to their fellow men in one 
lifetime as BARRATT O'HARA. 
Youthful explorer, Spanish American 
War and World War I soldier, news-
papermen, youngest attorney general in 
Illinois' history, motion picture execu-
tive, brilliant defense lawyer, author, and 
Congressman?each of these careers and 
achievements would require a lifetime of 
an ordinary man. BARRATT O'HARA has 
accomplished them in 83 short years. 
It is a measure of the stature of this 
outstanding American that he first came 
to Congress at an age when most men 
have retired. Since his election from the 
Second District of Illinois to the 81st 
Congress, he has earned the respect of 
his colleagues for the depth of his wis-
doM and the breadth of his vision. 
It has been my distinct privilege to 
have served with Mr. O'HARA on the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee. He 
has never ceased to amaze me with his 
energy and abilities. His counsel and ad-
vice to me have been of inestimable 
value through the years. 
Today in congratulating BARRATT 
O'HARA on his birthday, I want to add my 
sincere best wishes to him for many more 
years of fruitful service to his constitu-
ents and to our Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 8411 
Apra 28, 1965 
undertaken, especially aimed at employing 
the unskilled and the semiskilled, , 
A month later, in an address to the City 
Council of New ork, I proposed that New 
York City launch a broadscale attack on 
hardcore poverty in our city?to be aimed at 
the roots...of tl problem and its contribu-
tory factors. 
Immediately some critics asked us to de-
fine precisely the poverty we were going to 
attack. During the ensuing discussion, I felt 
like saying what klumpty Dumpty said in 
"Alice in Wonderland": 
"When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty 
said, "it mearfs just what I choose it to 
mean?neither more nor less," 
I think most of us know, today what we 
mean by poverty. The figure used nation-
ally?which we found to fit New York City, 
too?is one out of every five. In New York 
City about 1,800,000 individuals, belonging to 
389,000 families, live in conditions approxi-
mating poverty. Of course, the dictionary 
definition of poverty?"having little or noth-
ing in the way of wealth, goods, or subsist-
ence" ha z little practical application to 
'America in 1965. Most of the poor today 
have Some goods, and almost all have or re-
ceive some subsistence. 
, 
But really, when we speak of the poor, we. 
know whom we are talking about; But the 
entire range of the poor are hard to define 
precisely. They range from completely nor-
mal and law-abiding New Yorkers to some 
who have what the experts call a deep social 
pathology?with a sense of total alienation 
from existing social institutions as well as 
from the positive elements in their own com-
munities and neighborhoods. 
Most of this latter group have no respect 
for law and order. They include the drug 
addicts, the addict pushers, the numbers 
runners, the petty thieves, the muggers, and 
others who form a, special underworld of the 
poor?which preys primarily upon the poor. 
It is this underworld whose members con-
stitute our greatest single social liability who 
are the greatest menace to their own corn-
=Mites as well as a source of endless social 
cost to society as a whole. These elements 
were responsible for most of the evidence and 
perpetrated most of the looting in last sum-
mer's convulsive riots. This subgroup gives 
a bad name to Negroes and to Puerto Ricans. 
It is our city's worst blight. 
This is not the true underworld. The 
underworld f itm now defining belongs to 
the poor. Its denizens come from the poor. 
They are poor. 
It is not generally known, but these crimi-
nal poor prey most of all on other poor. The 
law-abiding poor are the easiest victims. 
They have the least security for what they 
own. Their property is the most accessible, 
and also the most disposable and the least 
traceable. 
This victimization of the poor is one of 
the main indignities of poverty. Most of the 
poor think that they get less police protec-
tion than others do, In New York City, at 
least, this is not deliberately so, but it prob-
ably works out this way because of the greater 
difficulty of policing_poor neighborhoods. 
I dwell on this subject because it often 
goes unnoticed by those concerned with the 
problem of poverty. Yet it is a major aspect 
of the rising crime rate in our cities. 
The underworld of poverty, while only a 
tiny part of the poverty population, plays a 
Major part in the world of the poor, as an 
ever-preSeht Menace and symbol Of the degra. 
dation of poverty. This underworld must be 
an object of our sPecial attention in the war 
on poverty. None of our present programs 
confront it, It must be confronted, 
? The basic challenge is to give all the poor 
the opportunity and the wherewithal to bet-
;er, their ,reep,nornic condition. They must 
No.15-8 
also be given the hope and the desire to 
do so, 
New York City and the Nation have ac-
cepted the challenge. The question is: How 
are we meeting it? What is our plan? 
Our plan consists of many parts, in order 
to meet the many-faceted problem. We in-
tend to do a great many different things, de-
signed to meet the needs of different groups, 
as well as different factors in the causation 
of poverty. 
Unfortunately, thus far, we have been able 
to start only a few of the things we must do. 
We have begun to work on the special pro-
grams authorized under the Economic Op-
portunity Act, the Neighborhood Youth 
Corps, the Job Corps, and the activities that 
fall under the community action plan pro-
vided under title II of the Economic Oppor-
tunity Act. 
All these programs are now in the begin-
ning stages of implementation. In New York 
City our expectation for 1965 is to involve 
approximately 25,000 people?mostly youth?
as direct beneficiaries and participants in 
the various programs under the Economic 
Opportunity Act. 
Preschool training programs will be pro-
vided for approximately 7,000 children from 
disadvantaged neighborhoods. 
Special loans and other aids are to be made 
to small businesses to enable qualified indi-
viduals from these disadvantaged neighbor-
hoods to start ,and to conduct businesses of 
their own. 
For the aged, there will be basic services 
including employment opportunities. 
Most of these sample programs I have just 
mentioned will be operated and conducted 
from the disadvantaged neighborhoods. Ex-
cept for the professional experts required for 
training, counseling, and administration, all 
the personnel required for these programs 
will be solocitcd from the neighborhoods. 
I want to refer hereto the two trailblazing, 
neighborhood-based poverty programs in New 
York City which have served as prototypes 
for others throughout the country: Haryou-
Act in Central Harlem, and mobilization-f or-
youth on the Lower East Side. 
Although these programs were originally 
designed to combat juvenile delinquency, 
experience soon dictated that their scope 
should be enlarged to include a broad-scale 
attack upon the conditions underlying 
poverty. 
Much has been learned from these two 
pioneer undertakings. We, in New York City, 
are trying to apply what has been learned. 
Meanwhile, we will continue to support mo-
bilization-for-youth and Haryou-Act with 
New York City funds. The mobilization-for-
youth program is, of course, of special in-
terest in Puerto _Rico because one of the 
major population components in the 67-block 
area covered by mobilization-for-youth is 
Puerto Rican, 
Now, I want to turn to the special Puerto 
Rican aspects of our antipoverty program. 
You might be interested in a few facts and 
figures about the Puerto Ricans in New 'York. 
Puerto Ricans born in New York get more 
education than those born in Puerto Rico 
who come to New York. The avera,ge is 2 
years more education for Puerto Rican men 
and 3 years more for women. Nevertheless, 
compared to the rest of the population, 
Puerto Ricans are still at a disadvantage. 
According to the 1960 census, Puerto 
Ricans 25 years old and older averaged 3 
years less education than the comparable 
figure for the total population of New York 
City. 
Almost 30 percent of Puerto Ricans 25 
years old or older had less than 5 years of 
education, compared to only 9 percent for 
the entire population of the city: In the 
same age group, only 10 percent of Puerto 
Ricans had completed high school, and only 
a percent had gone on to college, compared 
to 24 and 18 percent for the total population. 
The unemployment rate for Puerto Ricans 
is double that of the city average. 
In 1960, 33 percent of all Puerto Rican 
families in New York City had incomes of 
less than $3,000, compared with 13 percent 
of all families in New York City. 
Only 3 percent of Puerto Rican families 
had incomes of $10,000 or more, in contrast 
to 22 percent for all New York City families. 
Even these statistics have their bright side. 
The fact is that more than 5,000 Puerto 
Ricans have jobs with the city government. 
More than 100 auxiliary teachers, who are 
completely bilingual, are working for the 
board of education. Almost all of them are 
graduates of the University of Puerto Rico. 
More than 6,000 Puerto Ricans own their 
own businesses. 
These are just sample figures which help 
in drawing a profile. 
All the programs to which I have already 
referred are aimed at expanding the horizons 
of opportunity and lowering the barriers of 
discrimination for the benefit of New York 
City's Puerto Ricans, as well as for Negroes 
and other disadvantaged groups. In the pre-
school training program, special emphasis 
will be given to the language barrier. Bi-
lingual teachers will be employed. 
Puerto Ricans from among the ranks of the 
poor will be trained in subprofessional 
capacities for service to the poor?as assist-
ants to visiting doctors and nurses, as at-
tendants in hospitals and nursing homes, as 
itinerant helpers in the households' of the 
aged, as maintenance personnel for apart-
ment houses. 
This kind of training can and will be pro-
vided in neighborhood centers for the un-
skilled, untrained, and unlettered. 
We plan to mobilize Puerto Rican profes-
sionals?or at least Spanish-speaking profes-
sionals?to train these subprofessiOnals. 
It is our belief that one of the expanding 
areas of employment opportunities for the 
future is in providing increased services to 
the/sick, the disabled, the young, the aged?
indeed, to all who need the kind of help 
which must be furnished by human hands 
and cannot be automated. 
Late last summer a group of Puerto 
Ricans, acting through an organization 
called the Puerto Rican Forum, asked me to 
arrange a financial grant from the city gov-
ernment to enable them to plan a compre-
hensive anti-poverty program based on the 
special needs of Puerto Ricans in New York. 
I approved a $70,000 allocation for this pur-
pose. Additional funds have since been 
granted. Recently, the Puerto Rican Forum 
submitted a comprehensive multimillion-
dollar program. The proposals of the Puerto 
Rican Forum, which are complex, are under 
active study and consideration. Other 
Puerto Rican groups in New York have sub-
mitted alternative proposals. From all these 
proposals, a program will be worked out 
which can be fitted into the overall frame-
work of the city's anti-poverty plan and 
provide an adequate reflection of special 
Puerto Rican needs. 
One of the ideas proposed by the Puerto 
Rican Forum especially intrigued me. It 
was proposed to subsidize the maintenance 
and spread of Puerto Rican culture in New 
York City through a network of existing 
Puerto Rican organizations. This is linked 
up with the war against poverty. Actually, 
it would be difficult to allocate governmental 
funds for this purpose. However, we are 
still studying this approach, and are try-
ing to find a way to get fiscal support for 
a Part of this undertaking. 
In any event, fwant to tell you that I am 
determined, as mayor, to insure that the

8412 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE April 28, 1965 
Puerto Ricans of New York receive a full 
share of the benefits of the poverty pro-
gram?the share to which they are entitled 
by virtue of their numbers and by virtue 
of their need. 
The full scope of the powers, authority, 
and resources of every department of the city 
government is to be focused on the achieve-
ment of this objective. 
I would like to underline this point, be-
cause I believe that the uniqueness of New 
York City's poverty program lies in the fact 
that the entire range of city government 
resources has been placed, by executive or-
der, within the orbit of the poverty pro-
gram. To head up the poverty program, I 
selected one of the highest ranking officials 
of the City of New York, the president of 
the city council, Mr. Paul Serevane, who is 
also one of the most accomplished admin-
istrators to come up through the ranks of 
the city government in my memory. 
My purpose was to give the poverty pro-
gram a top priority among all the programs 
of the city government. Li a real sense, 
the entire city government is engaged. in 
the poverty program, and deeply committed 
to it. 
I consider each Puerto Rican in New York 
a New Yorker like other New Yorkers?a 
New Yorker equal in all respects, in his 
rights and his claims for privilege and op-
portunity. 
We certainly welcome the Commonwealth 
and its office in New York as the interpreter, 
advocate, friend, and defender of the Puerto 
Ricans in New York. There are, in fact, 
many individuals and organizations claim-
ing to be the spokesmen of all Puerto Ricans 
in New York. That is natural. I honor and 
recognize them all for their efforts. How-
ever, I want recognition, too, as one who 
speaks and works for the interests of the 
700,000 Puerto Ricans in the 5 boroughs of 
New York City. 
In-this connection, I want to pay tribute to 
the activities of the Commonwealth in New 
York City, particularly through its migration 
division. I want to express my appreciation 
to Labor Secretary Frank Zorilla, under whom 
the migration division operates. Secretary 
Zorilla deserves praise for his supervision 
of this fine activity. And of course, I want 
to mention the director of that division, a 
true friend, although he frequently presses 
us hard, Joe Monserrat I was very happy 
to approve recently the appointment of one 
of the key employees of the migration divi-
sion, brilliant young Joe Morales, to one of 
the top positions on the staff of the anti-
poverty operations board. 
If I were to summarize the prescription to 
meet the needs of the war against poverty, 
it would be a prescription for most of the 
things that are being done today. But I 
would prescribe a much bigger scale, with a 
much broader sweep. And there are many 
additional programs which cry to be 
launched. 
Emergency actions are needed now to fore-
stall emergency situations later. 
We need that public works program I pro-
posed 15 months ago. We need it now more 
than ever. Of course, the cast would be very 
great, and the cost of stepping up all the 
other programs I have been talking about 
would be very great, too. 
Yet the money must be found, as it cer-
tainly would be found if We faced a military 
emergency abroad. 
There must be substantially greater Fed-
eral grants directly to the localities for edu-
cation, for training, for housing, for all the 
programs I have been talking about and that 
have been discussed at this conference. But 
the local and State governments must be 
ready to strain their resources, too. This 
means more taxes, which is not easy to con-
template and even less to institute. But it 
must be done. The people must be con-
vinced that it must be done. 
Will the sum of all the programs I have 
discussed cure poverty? Frankly, I don't 
know. Neither does anybody. I know one 
thing: we must try everything. We cannot 
afford to stop. 
There are lions in the streets, angry lions, 
aggrieved lions, lions who had been caged 
until the cages crumbled. We had better do 
something about those lions, and when I 
speak of lions I do not mean individuals. I 
mean the spirit of the people, those who have 
been neglected and oppressed, and dis-
criminated against, and misunderstood and 
forgotten. Some of them now have the 
spirits of angry lions. We must promptly 
set about to remedy the conditions which 
brought them into being. And we have no 
time. The time is now. It is already after 
midnight on the clock of history. We can 
only pray that the clock will stop awhile 
and give us the breathing space to work our 
Wills in accordance with our consciences, to 
the best of our abilities. 
THE PRESID POLICY IN 
(Mr. MOR and was given 
permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD.) 
Mr. MORGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to commend President Johnson for his 
course of action in Vietnam and to ex-
press my appreciation for his frank and 
open statement to the American people 
and to the peoples of the world in ex-
planation of U.S. policy in that area. 
Public opinion polls have shown that a 
vast majority of the American people 
support the President's policy in Viet-
nam. After his press conference yester-
day, that support should increase, both 
here and abroad. The President empha-
sized again that we have learned the 
lessons afforded by the appeasement of 
Munich. He could not have been more 
right when he said that failure to resist 
In Vietnam would deliver a friendly na-
tion to terror and repression, encourage 
those who seek to conquer other nations 
In their reach, and endanger American 
welfare and freedom. 
I am also proud of the restraint being 
exercised by our President in his deter-
mination to provide the maximum 
amount of deterrent with the minimum 
cost. The carefully controlled bombings 
which the President has authorized are 
coupled with his desire to stop the loss 
of lives and end the conflict. I was 
pleased to read his words: 
I do sometimes wonder how some people 
can be so concerned with our bombing a 
cold bridge of steel and concrete in North 
Vietnam but never open their mouth about 
a bomb being placed in our Embassy in South 
Vietnarn. 
President Johnson repeated that our 
bombings of their bridges, radar stations, 
and ammunition will cease the moment 
the North Vietnamese end their aggres-
sion. In renewing his offer for uncondi-
tional discussions and reemphasizing the 
firmness of our position, the President 
not only deserves the fullest support of 
every American, but that of freedom-
loving people everywhere. 
TIME FOR A SPECIAL COMMITTEE 
ON THE CAPTIVE NATIONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
previous order of the House the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania [Mr. noon] is 
recognized for 60 minutes. 
(Mr. FLOOD asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
-Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that various other Mem-
bers be permitted to extend their re-
marks in today's RECORD at the end of 
my remarks on this subject. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
GENERAL LEAVE TO EXTEND 
Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to extend their 
remarks upon this same subject. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, present de-
velopments in various parts of the world, 
particularly in Vietnam, make the es-
tablishment of a Special Committee on 
the Captive Nations a definite necessity. 
Let us not forget that the captive people 
of North Vietnam also have a stake in 
the outcome of the current crisis there. 
Despite the eased tensions in Eastern 
Europe, let us not forget that the various 
totalitarian Red governments do not 
represent the underlying captive nations 
and in a variety of ways continue to op-
press and exploit the captive peoples. 
Let us also not forget that Moscow's de-
ceptive policy of peaceful coexistence 
cannot conceal the realities of Soviet 
Russian imperiocolonialism in the cap-
tive non-Russian countries of the em-
pire-state called the Soviet Union. And 
let us not forget that the captive nation 
of Cuba is still off our shores and is being 
systematically exploited by Moscow and 
Peiping alike for Red totalitarian pene-
tration of Latin America. 
In short, Mr. Speaker, as our interest 
and energies are being absorbed by cer-
tain particular events, let us not forget 
the general and basic state of the captive 
nations in Eastern Europe, Asia, and 
Latin America. And the best way in 
not forgetting them at this time is to 
create now a Special Committee on the 
Captive Nations. This is the time for 
such a committee. 
A BRIDGE TO TRUE UNDERSTANDING 
As Representatives of the American 
people, we have now a wonderful oppor-
tunity to construct a bridge of true un-
derstanding between ourselves and the 
neglected captive nations and peoples. 
Diplomatic bridges with totalitarian 
governments in the Red empire are not 
necessarily bridges with the underlying 
captive nations. We need more than one 
type of bridge for the terrain is sub-
stantially different between the oppres-
sor and the oppressed, the colonialist and 
the colonial, the exploiter and the ex-
ploited. A Special Committee on the 
Captive Nations in this Congress would 
be our bridge of true understanding of, 
and abiding faith in, the close to 1 bil-
lion captive people. 
It has been my privilege to introduce 
the original resolution proposing thit 
bridge of true understanding. Dozen:

April 28, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 
Although the buildings' and health de-
partments list some of the violations as haz-
ardous to the lives and health Of he Men, 
wQmen, and children who live the build-
ings concerned, the landlords do hot consider 
themselves -or-fin/pals. 
What is more important, however, is that 
the courts and the judges themselves do not 
consider them criminals, nor their acts more 
serious than MAZY parking violations. 
Despite the fact that the penalty for con-
viction for a hosing misdemeanor can run 
as high as a $500 fine and 30 days in jail, 
it rarely does. In fact, many violators con-
tinue to find it far less expensive to pay 
their fines than to fix their houses. 
In 1964 there were a total of 20,613 con-
victions in housing court and of these, 19718 
were fined a total of $332,498?an average of 
$16.86 per case. In January of this year, 957 
cases were reported as convictions and 892 
persons were fined $17,220, an average of 
$10.90 per case. 
To put the court's attitude toward hous-
ing violations and the slumlords into proper 
perspective, one need look no further than 
traffic court, where the standard fine for 
parking a car in a restricted area is $15. 
Even the amount of the fines in housing 
court is not an accurate barometer for meas-
uring the punishment of housing violators. 
The average fine per case does not take into 
consideration the total number of violations 
per case. 
In many instances, the fine averages out to 
no more than $4 a violation. For this reason, 
it is not difficult Jo see why many landlords 
find it far more economical to pay a small 
fine rather than have the violation fixed be-
fere the matter falls into the jurisdiction of 
the housing court. In some cases, landlords 
even save money by paying the fine. 
For instance, yesterday one of the land-
lords convicted for failure to provide heat 
for 2 days to his 60-family apartment house 
In Manhattan was fined $25. 
After paying his fine he told a reporter 
that the boiler was broken for the 2 days, 
but that during that time he saved almost 
5,000 gallons of fuel, at 6 cents a gallon?
$300. 
Despite the high percentage of convic-
tions?more, than 90 percent?the criminal 
prosecution of housing code violators does 
not function, as a deterrent to continued 
abuse. Landlords plead guilty to violations, 
but then appear at another time to make the 
plea to other charges. 
The procedures of the court do not usually 
'help the tenant who must endure the viola-
tion While the court action is taken. 
At present there are often delays of as long 
as 3 months between the time an inspec-
tor makes a recommendation for Court ac-
tion and the first appearance of the violator 
in court. The matter does not usually end 
there, because in many cases there are con-
tinued adjournments and it may be a year 
before the case is finally settled. 
For many landlords, housing court has 
taken on, the flavor of traffic' court, where, 
despite a person's feeling that he is not 
guilty, he will often plead guilty and pay a 
fine. If he were to plead not guilty, he would 
then have to appear on another day for trial, 
and even then he, could not be sure the city 
Would be ready with its case. If his time is 
more Valuable, he pleads guilty and is fin-
ished witia, it. 
' ItOWOVO the "operators"?landlords who 
buy and sell slum buildings for profit, and 
Who milk' them for every penny they can get 
out of them?will often "shop around" for a 
more lenient judge and will plead not guilty 
on a clay when a strict judge is on the bench. 
On the day for trial, before the lenient judge, 
they will change their plea to guilty and 
accept the low fine imposed. 
No. 75-12 
The "operators" also manage to avoid hav-
ing their names sullied with convictions by 
having the name of a corporation substituted 
on the court records, 
Another factor that works against the ad-
. 
ministration,. of justice in housing cases is 
that in the cases of flagrant violators, it is 
often difficult to find out who is the legal 
owner of the building. 
Although "managing agents" usually col-
lect the rent, when it comes time to appear 
in court for a series of violations they are 
frequently "fired" and no longer work for 
the owner. 
The department issuing the summons for 
the violation must then try to find the true 
owner of the property. This is often more 
difficult than it may seem. The person who 
is -held legally responsible for the building 
often maintains that he is still not the 
owner. 
In these cases, the true owner hides behind 
a facade of corporation names and post office 
box numbers, or uses a telephone answering 
service so that he can screen his calls. In 
this way he "cannot be contacted" for the 
service of summonses_ or for complaints to 
be registered with him. 
A typical day in housing court begins with 
the crowded corridor and the usual press of 
bodies trying to get into the courtroom. 
Yesterday there were 44 cases on the docket 
and the courtroom was half empty. The 
court clerk?the "Bridgeman"?called off the 
name of a defendant, who would approach 
the bench. The clerk would ask if he was 
acquainted with the charges, rattle off the 
defendant's rights and then ask for a plea. 
It was a bad day for the defendants. 
In 20 cases, they pleaded guilty and were 
fined an average of $32 a case. One defendant 
paid $110 for four cases involving a total of 
16 violations?or an average of $6 per 
violation. 
Another landlord paid a $50 fine for a vio-
lation consisting of a faulty elevator. 
Another claimed his tenant refused to al-
low his apartment to be painted and that an 
Inspector Issued a summons anyway. He re-
ceived a $10 suspended sentence. 
Of the rest of the cases, 20 were adjourned 
for trial. In the four others, warrants were 
issued for the defendants' arrest for failure 
to appear in court. 
When the name of the landlord for 286 
Fort Washington Avenue was called, 16 peo-
ple rose and approached the bench. They 
were the landlord, his attorney, and 14 ten-
ants from the building. 
After pleading guilty, without an explana-
tion, the landlord, W. Genuth, of 273 Have-
meyer Street, Brooklyn, was fined $25 for 
failure to provide heat in the 60-apartment 
building. As the judge pronounced sen-
tence, the tenants walked out quickly?ob-
viously not satisfied. 
Outside the courtroom they got into an 
argument with Mr. Genuth because they 
claimed that he had harassed them. 
John Churko, a spokesman for the tenants, 
claimed that for the last 4 years they have 
had trouble with him. He said that the 
landlord had continually refused to make 
repairs or to paint the apartments. He said 
that for a period of 7 weeks early this year, 
the tenants had to walk to their apartments 
In the six-story building because the ele-
vator was not working. 
Mr. Genuth denied g).e charges of harass-
Merit but admitted that the elevator was 
not working for that length of time. 
"Vandals broke the control panel on the 
elevator," he said, "and it took 7 weeks to 
the day to have it repaired. It cost me more 
than $7,000, but they don't want to listen 
to me." 
As for the no-heat violation, Mr. Genuth 
agreed that the building was without heat 
8443-
for 2 days but said someone had broken 
the boiler. He showed a bill for $900 for 
repairs to the boiler, and for rusted bolts 
that allowed the water to seep out. 
He blamed labor troubles for the "vandals" 
who had destroyed his property. 
"It cost me more than $12,000 for all the 
work on the building so far this year," he 
said. "I try but I just can't keep up with 
it all. I have tenants in the building who 
are paying $65 a month for six rooms un-
der rent control. They should have rent 
controls but they should make it like $25 
a room instead of about $19. For me it's 
an investment, but I can't make money on 
this." 
A half hour later, at 12:20, another day 
in housing court had drawn to a close. 
Judge Maurice Downing, graying and re-
served, refused , to talk with a reporter and 
left immediately. 
Long criticized by civic groups for many 
reasons, the housing court and its judge re-
main unchanged. 
Not too long ago, a city official, who is deep_ 
ly concerned about the dual failure of the 
housing code and the housing court to bring 
about a solution to the problem of slum-
lords, brought up the topic with a criminal 
court judge, who sits on housing court. 
According to the city official, the judge 
maintained that he just didn't feel that 
most housing violations were true crim-
inal acts. According to this judge, most 
housing problems should be settled by the 
tenants and the landlords, not by the crim-
inal courts. 
As long as judges feel this way?and 
more than one certainly does?the housing 
court will continue to offer little relief to 
the thousands of New Yorkers being victim- * 
ized daily by landlords who operate freely 
as slumlords within the framework of the 
law. 
NEW YORK CITY IN CRISIS?PART 
LIII 
(Mr. MULTER (at the request of Mr. 
SCHEITER) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, the fol-
lowing article on New York City's slum-
lords appeared in the New York Herald 
Tribune on March 10,1965. 
The article is part of the series on "New 
York City in Crisis" and follows: 
NEW YORK CITY IN CRISIS--CITY ARMED WITH 
POPGUNS IN ITS WAR ON SLUMLORDS 
(Norz.--In the greatest city in the world, 
perhaps the basic ill is slum housing. As 
part of the Herald Tribune's continuing in-
vestigative series, "New York City in Crisis," 
Reporters Martin J. Steadman and Alfonso 
Narvaez have spent 1 month intensively ex-
amining the problems of the slumlords and 
the dwellers. Today, in the fourth article, 
the Tribune offers possible?and vitally nec-
essary?solutions.) 
(By Martin J. Steadman, of the Herald 
Tribune staff) 
The New York City Buildings Department 
is fighting the growing slum problem with 
one hand tied behind its back. 
A month-long Herald Tribune investiga-
tion found that loopholes in the law, lenient 
judges, and an outmanned buildings depart-
ment let hard-core slumlords milk old-law 
tenements at the expense of the tenants. 
Here are some of the problems the build-
ings department faces: 
No legal staff. Cases against slumlords are 
prepared by clerks.

8444 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE April 28, 1965 
Delays of as long as 3 months from the 
time court action is recommended and the 
scheduled court appearance of the defendant. 
Penalties imposed on landlords by judges 
in housing court are extremely lenient. 
? Rarely does a slumlord go to jail. The aver-
age fine last year was $16.86, far less than 
what it would cost a landlord to make the 
repairs demanded by the buildings depart-
ment. 
Only eight process servers are available to 
try to track down the hard-core slumlords. 
The buildings department is forced to resort 
to service of summons by mail, a dubious 
legal maneuver. Result: There are now 1,600 
cases pending where the landlord has not 
appeared in court following mailed service of 
the summons. The backlog of cases is 
growing. 
The department tried to hire a private 
process service agency last year, paying first 
$1.50, then $2.50, per summons. But the 
agency found it unprofitable and notified the 
city that it would not do the job any longer. 
The buildings department does not have 
statutory potver to subpena witnesses, take 
testimony under oath, and compel the pro-
duction of books and records of slumlords. 
Each year since 1960, a bill has been intro-
duced in the legislature to give the depart-
ment these powers. Each year the bill has 
died in committee. 
The receivership program, which allows the 
city to seize a slum tenement, fix it up and 
collect rents until the job is paid for, is just 
limping along. To date, only 74 buildings 
have gone into receivership, The buildings 
department considers receivership a potent 
weapon in code enforcement. The mere 
threat of seizure has brought compliance by 
reluctant landlords in 154 buildings. But 
the staff for this highly touted program 
numbers only 17 people, with just 1 attorney, 
borrowed from another department. The 
entire receivership staff boasts three clerks, 
two typists, a stenographer, eight inspectors, 
and two process servers. 
Overlapping jurisdiction. Lack-of-heat 
violations come under the jurisdiction of the 
health department. Lack-of-hot-water vio-
lations come under the jurisdiction of build-
ings. Usually both violations are traceable 
to. a defective boiler. Though civic groups 
have clamored for consolidation of housing 
enforcement agencies for years, New York 
City still clings to the old way of doing 
things. 
The shortcomings in budget and staff of 
the buildings department were recently 
pointed up by the Community Service So-
ciety, a quietly effective nonprofit civic group 
which keeps a close watch on housing prob-
lems. The agency wrote: 
"No substantial improvement in code en-
forcement can be expected until the Depart-
ment of Buildings receives a budget com-
mensurate with its responsibilities." 
CSS also took the occasion to criticize the 
courts. "Until fines are greater than the cost 
of repairs, it is not likely that this method of 
enforcement will be as effective as it should 
be." 
The buildings department has been shaken 
by scandals many times over the years. 
Inspectors have been dismissed and jailed 
over taking graft. After the last grand jury 
report, in 1959, Mayor Wagner reached out 
for a cop to head the department. He got 
Harold Birns, a former assistant district at-
torney in Prank Hogan's rackets squad. 
Since then the buildings department has 
been functioning in relative quiet. Commis-
sioner Elms has fired 30 inspectors sum-
marily, but no major scandal, or charges of 
organized graft collecting have disturbed his 
administration. As for enforcement of the 
housing code by the buildings department, 
statistics indicate It is doing a greater 
amount of enforcement each year. 
Inspectors reported 425,526 housing viola-
tions on 30,562 buildings in 1964. The pre-
vious record high, in 1983, was 307,716. That 
figure was considerably higher than the 195,-
585 violations reported in 1962. 
Most of the increased inspection activity 
was caused by the "cycle survey," a cellar-to-
roof inspection of every building in a slum 
neighborhood, instituted July 15, 1963. The 
cycle survey teams do not wait for tenant 
complaints. 
To date, cycle survey teams have visited 
30,105 buildings, containing 157,209 apart-
ments. When the program began, 40,208 
violations were pending on those buildings. 
The inspectors handed out an additional 
227,925 violations. 
All this inspection activity shows up in 
housing court, of course. There were 22,411 
cases brought by the buildings department in 
1964, up from the 16,086 in 1963. More than 
90 percent of the cases end in convictions, 
and last year 20,613 landlords paid $332,498 
In fines. 
The last figure is disturbing to civic groups 
as well as law enforcement officials. The 
average fine in 1960 was $26.67. Each year 
since, it has declined, until last year the 
landlords were walking out of housing court 
with average fines of less than $17. 
In 1964, only 10 landlords went to jail. 
In 1863, only seven jail terms were handed 
down. 
But many observers feel that even with 
the increased activity, the buildings depart-
ment is losing the fight against spreading 
slums. 
City Councilman J. Raymond Jones, speak-
ing at a budget hearing last DeceMber, re-
marked: "We give the buildings department 
a teacup and expect it to stop the Hudson 
from flowing Into the bay." 
The buildings department budget for this 
fiscal year is $10.2 million. Commissioner 
Birns Is asking $15 million for next year. 
Almost the entire buildings department 
budget goes for the salaries of 1,642 em-
ployees, including 866 building and housing 
inspectors. The payroll amounts to $9.9 mil-
lion of the $10.2 million budget. 
The budget for the executive staff of the 
buildings department has always been rather 
niggardly compared to the plush budgets for 
other city departments. 
There are only 20 lines in the budget, in-
cluding the commissioner and two deputies, 
for the administration of a central office and 
five borough offices. Two of the lines are 
unfilled, which means two of the officials are 
doubling in their jobs. There is no public 
relations officer attached to the buildings de-
partment, perhaps the only major city de-
partment without one. 
There are 43,000 old-law tenements on the 
city streets. Built before the turn of the 
century, many of these buildings would have 
been ordered battled up long ago if there 
weren't a housing shortage in the city. 
The vacancy ratio at present?the key 
figure in determining just how much leeway 
the city has in getting tough with land-
lords who do not comply with the law?is 
now at a very low 1.7 percent. In effect, this 
means that even if the city wanted to vacate 
a bad building, vacancy ratio figures insist 
that officials must go slow?there is no place 
to move the ousted tenants. 
The vacate order is the ultimate weapon 
against the slumlord. His tenants are 
ordered out and the premises bearded up. 
But because there is no place to put the 
tenants, the buildings department Could 
close only 27 old-law tenements in 1962, 34 in 
1963, and 51 in 1964. In the 4 years between 
1934 and 1937, the city boarded up over 2,000 
slum buildings, an average of over 500 a 
year. 
But it was easier for Mayor La Guardia, 
brandishing a hatchet or a flit gun, to order 
a slum building boarded up immediately. 
The vacancy ratio in the 1930's ran well up 
to between 12 and 17 percent. Adding to the 
enormity of the problem faced by Mayor 
Wagner and his building department is the 
simple fact that these tenements are now 30 
years older than when Mr. La Guardia was 
crusading against them. 
Last,May, the city commissioned a study of 
the present housing code by the Columbia 
University Legislative Drafting Research 
Fund. Headed by Prof. Prank Grad, the 
study team is expected to take 3 years, at a 
-Cost of $255,000, to analyze the deficiencies 
in the present code, and return recommenda-
tions. 
Professor Grad said yesterday that he filed 
a preliminary report on consolidation of 
housing enforcement agencies several months 
ago, but the city has not yet released his 
recommendations. 
The professor declined to discuss his find-
ings, but it was learned that he urged con-
solidation as a long-overdue measure. 
Reforms in the tenements come in fits and 
starts. In 1901, the legislature passed the 
sweeping tenement house law, outlawing 
any more construction of the dingy, unsafe 
buildings. Toilets were moved into the 
houses from the backyards. 
In 1929, the legislature mandated fire-
retarding of cellars and halls, and in 1955, 
the multiple dwelling code was amended to 
require central heating in every apartment 
house. 
This could be the year for greater tene-
ment-house reform?perhaps a tightened 
multiple dwelling law and city housing code 
If the people and their elected officers want 
it.

TUE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF PUERTO Rico 
(Address by Santiago Polanco-Abreu? Resi-
dent Commissioner of the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico) 
I am greatly honored by the invitation of 
the Inter-American Bar Association and the 
D.C. Bar Committee on Inter-American Rela-
tions to join with them here today to speak 
on the economic development of Puerto 
? Rico. It is extremely rewarding to me that 
this distinguished group is interested in the 
problems of Puerto Rico and how we are 
handling them. And, with your permission, 
would like to look at the Commonwealth 
against the larger backdrop of the two-thirds 
of the world which lives in deep poverty. 
Certainly all of us are perturbed by the 
enormous gulf which separates the "have" 
from the "have not" nations, and even more 
perturbed by the fact that this gulf seems to 
be growing, rather than diminishing. 
Happily, there have been some noteworthy 
exceptions to this trend of the rich getting 
? richer, while the poor get poorer or barely 
hold their own. The rates of economic 
growth in Japan, Israel, and Puerto Rico, for 
? example, are now much higher than the 
growth rates of more highly developed coun-
? tries. In contrast with most underdeveloped 
countries, moreover, their growth has been 
nothing short of spectacular. Today, Japan, 
Israel, and Puerto Rico are on the other side 
of the fence, sending their technicians and 
providing technical assistance to their less 
fortunate neighbors. 
Recognizing that Puerto Rico is no more a 
typical case than Japan or Israel, it is never-
theless worthwhile, I believe, to understand 
something of its economic development his-
tory in order to see more clearly some of the 
problems characteristic of underdeveloped 
countries and some of the solutions that 
have proved workable in Puerto Rico. 
In. 1898, when Puerto Rico was ceded by 
Spain to the United States, the island was 
indeed underdeveloped. Most people lived 
in poverty on small subsistence farms. 
Families were large and few children could 
be educated. Coffee was the only important 
export, and the total volume of oversea 
trade was small, indeed. The beginning of a 
modernized Puerto Rican economy was the 
development of sugar as a major export in-
dustry. 
Growth of the sugar industry provided a 
necessary base for the more diversified eco-
nomic development that was to come much 
later. The method of its development, how-
ever, was most damaging to the people of 
Puerto Rico. The sugar industry, largely 
owned by U.S. interests, took out from 
Puerto Rico far more in profits than the 
amount it invested or reinvested. 
The depression of the 1930's hit Puerto 
Rico with great severity, Sugar and coffee 
prices tumbled to ruinous levels. Many cof-
fee plantations, which had been severely 
damaged by hurricanes in 1928 and 1932, were 
not replanted. , Everywhere there was deep 
social and political unrest. Puerto Rico was 
on the brink of revolution. Federal relief 
programs, although substantial in size, were 
not sufficient to offset the collapse in the 
economy. 
When it did come in 1940, the revolution 
was a peaceful one. A newly formed political 
party, led by Luis Mufioz Marin, won a slim 
victory at the polls. Mufioz had cam-
paigned, not on the traditional basis of 
Puerto Rico's political status, but on immedi-
ate and pressing economic and social issues. 
He promised bread 'for the hungry; land for 
the landless peasant; and freedom from po-
litical domination by the absentee sugar 
companies. His victory brought hope to a 
people that had for many years been mired 
in hoplessness. 
During the war years, Mufioz and his new 
Popular Party administration laid the 
groundwork for the economic and social de-
velopment programs which were later to be 
put into high gear. They also had a revenue 
windfall of $160 million from countervailing 
excise taxes on rum, which sold in large 
quantities in the United States during the 
war. And although this was badly needed 
for public assistance and a score of urgent, 
immediate problems, the government made 
the decision to invest this revenue in a num-
ber of public corporations intended to spear-
head Puerto Rico's economic development. 
Included among these publicly owned cor-
porations were utility companies in the fields 
of power, water supply, transportation, and 
communications. There were five others 
that had specific economic development ob-
jectives?the Government Development Bank, 
the Industrial Development Co., the Land 
Authority, and the Agricultural Co. Today, 
there are 22 public corporations in operation. 
Most of the larger ones are self-financing 
and today their assets total well over a 
billion dollars. Their establishment early in 
the program and their continued record of 
sound and constructive management have 
been major factors in the success of the 
development program as a whole. 
To appreciate the strategy of the develop-
ment program that was being planned and 
started in the 1940's, one needs to know some-
thing about Puerto Rico and its resources. 
The island Is only about 100 miles long and 
36 miles wide. We hays sunshine, beaches, 
and the sea, mountains, a tropical rain 
forest. 
Coffee and tobacco, and fruits and vege-
tables are grown in the mountains; and we 
have a rapidly expanding livestock and poul-
try industry, which produces about as much 
farm income as Sugarcane, our traditional 
crop. 
It began to be clear even in the 1940's that 
Puerto Rican economy could not depend pri-
marily on agriculture. The entire surface of 
the island has less than an acre of land per 
person and only about a third of it is suit-
able for crops of any kind. Even forestry is 
limited by the rugged terrain and by the 
great variety of trees and undergrowth typical 
of forests in the tropics. Prospecting for 
minerals started years ago and continues ac-
tively, but none has yet proved exploitable. 
With limited land and no commercial re-
sources of fuel or minerals, industrial devel-
opment has had to be the key element in 
Puerto Rico's economic development program. 
But there were many people in the 1940's, in-
cluding some of the experts, who believed 
that an industrial program was doomed to 
failure in a small agricultural country with 
such limited physical resources. In any case, 
it seemed quite clear that private investors 
would not initially undertake so rash a ven-
ture unless the Government functioned as a 
very active catalyst. 
At first the Government constructed and 
operated five factories, but it soon became 
evident that it would be impossible for the 
Industrial Development Co. to create jobs for 
Puerto Rico's rapidly rising population by this 
method. Some way had to be found to enlist 
private capital on a large seale in the indus-
trial program. A sound program of tax ex-
emption, Which was legislated in 1948, has 
proved to be the key incentive necessary for 
the development of private industrial enter-
prise in Puerto Rico. 
Puerto Rico's program of tax incentives 
and assistance to private industry rests on 
two basic elements in Puerto Rican-United 
States relations. In accordance with its as-
sociation with the United States, Federal 
taxes (with minor exceptions) do not apply 
in Puerto Rico and there are no tariffs or 
other restrictions on the flow of trade and 
money between the two areas. since most 
Federal taxes, including the Federal corpo-
rate income tax, do not apply in Puerto Rico, 
the Puerto Rican Government, by exempting 
corporation from its own taxes, is able to 
grant complete tax freedom. Under present 
legislation, it does so for manufacturing and 
hotel enterprises for a period which ranges 
from 10 years of tax exemption in the San 
Juan metropolitan area to 17 years in less-
developed parts of the island. 
Free trade with the United States, the 
other key element in United States-Puerto 
Rican relations, meant that a manufacturing 
operation in postwar Puerto Rico was not 
limited to what was then a very small local 
market. A plant, efficient enough to com-
pete with U.S. producers and also able to 
pay ocean frieght costs, was in a position to 
sell without any other restrictions in what 
was, and is, the world's largest common 
market. 
Our promotion efforts were at first slow in 
yielding results. By 1950 only about 80 new, 
privately operated plants had been promoted, 
and most of them were relatively small. By 
1955, 300 new privately owned factories had 
been established. Today, 10 years later, 
there are more than a thousand new,\ pri-
vately owned factories operating in Puerto 
Rico. Most of them are affiliates of U.S. 
manufacturing concerns. 
These factories produce over 300 different 
products. Apparel, textiles, electronics, ma-
chinery and petrochemicals are among the 
largest and fastest growing of the new Puerto 
Rican industries. About three-quarters of 
their output is exported, mostly to the 
United States. Last year (1963-64), exports

of the new industries totaled 6556 million, 
more than three times the value of our ship-
ments of sugar and other agricultural prod-
ucts. Manufacturing industries now employ 
105,000 workers at an average wage of $1.16 
an hour. 
Puerto Rico is no longer a one-crop agri-
cultural economy, moreover. Agricultural 
production has continued to expand and di-
versify. The value of livestock and poultry 
products, for example, is now about equal to 
sugar. But even with a growing total of 
agricultural production, manufacturing is 
today more than twice as important as agri-
culture as a source of income and as a stim-
ulus to the general economy. 
To develop manufacturing to the point it 
has already reached has taken considerably 
more than tax exemption, free trade, and 
promotion. The Puerto Rico Economic De-
velopment Administration and our voca-
eational education system have had to train 
thousands of workers and supervisors. 
Many manufacturers have needed and have 
received marketing, engineering and other 
forms of technical assistance, as well as lab-
oratory and testing services. For nearly a 
decade, the Industrial Development Co. has 
maintained a stock of about 50 new factory 
buildings throughout the island ready for 
immediate occupancy. The company and 
the Government Development Bank stand 
ready to participate in almost any kind of 
financing arrangement that seems mutually 
beneficial to the prospective manufacturer 
and to the people of Puerto Rico. 
Tourism development VMS another logical 
target for Puerto Rico. The island's kind 
climate, its golden beaches, and its beauti-
ful scenery provided the natural resources 
on which a major tourist industry could be 
built. Nevertheless, tourism, was a relatively 
slow starter. 
But in the past 7 years the growth of 
Puerto Rican tourism has been spectacular. 
We have about 7,000 hotel rooms, two-thirds 
of which have been built within this 7-year 
period. 
Primarily because of the swift expansion 
of manufacturing and tourism, the growth 
of the Puerto Rican economy as a whole has 
been among the most rapid anywhere in the 
world. Discounting price increases, the in-
crease in real commonwealth gross product 
during the past 5 years was 68 percent, an 
average of 9.5 percent, compounded annually. 
The largest gains in real gross product or 
real national income recorded elsewhere by 
the United Nations were 9.13 percent for Is-
rael between 1952 and 1960, and 9.6 percent 
for Japan between 1954 and 1960. 
It is, of course, a great flow of capital in-
vestment that accounts for Puerto Rico's 
record, or near-record rate of economic ex-
pansion. For 7 years, gross investment in 
fixed capital has been 20 percent or more of 
Commonwealth Gross Product. Last year it 
was 24.6 percent. Such a high rate of in-
vestment is characteristic of highly-devel-
oped countries like Holland, Sweden, Canada, 
and the United States but not of underde-
veloped countries where capital is ordinarily 
very scarce. 
Recognizing the high productivity of new 
investment in our economy, Puerto Rico has 
not only welcomed but actively promoted 
the investment of outside capital. As a re-
sult, about half of the funds invested in 
Puerto Rico have come from external sources, 
mainly the United States. There are three 
principal channels through which these 
funds flow in: First, direct investment, 
mainly in factories, hotels, and commercial 
establishments; second, the sale of bonds and 
other obligations of the Commonwealth and 
municipal governments and of the public 
corporations; and third, the purchase of 
Federal Housing Administration guaranteed 
mortgages by the Federal National Mortgage 
Association (called Fanny May) and other 
investors outside Puerto Rico. 
Direct investment of externally-owned 
funds in Puerto Rican factories already ex-
ceeds half a billion dollars. Outstanding ob-
ligations of the Commonwealth and munici-
pal governments and of Puerto Rico's public 
corporations total nearly a billion. Nearly 
two-thirds of this is accounted for by the 
public Corporations, of which the Water Re-
sources Authority is the largest. 
I have been speaking in economic abstrac-
tions. Now let me translate this into human 
terms. In 1940, Puerto Rico's per capita in-
come was $121. By 1960 it had inched up to 
$279. In 1964 it reached $832, almost triple 
the figure of 14 years earlier. Even allow-
ing for price increases, this meant that real 
per capita income had more than doubled in 
the past 11 years. In 1950, per capita income 
in Puerto Rico Was barely 18 percent of the 
U.S. average, but by 1960, it had risen to 30 
percent. So even in comparison with the 
United States, the gap has been closing 
rapidly. These per capita figures have, of 
course, deep human meaning. They mean 
that a man who was worried about being 
able to afford a pair of shoes 25 years ago, 
now worries about finding parking space for 
his Chevrolet; and that the woman who then 
wondered if she could feed her children, now 
is concerned with providing them with high 
school or college education. 
Let me cite some revealing indexes of this 
new, relative prosperity. In only six years, 
the people of Puerto Rico raised their per 
capita consumption of animal proteins from 
54 percent of the United States average to 
82 percent. In these same six years, the 
registration of motor vehicles increased two-
fold, while the number of telephones has 
doubled in only 3 years. University enroll-
ment is twice that of 9 years ago, and per 
capita expenditures for public health are 
now about the same in Puerto Rico as in 
the United States. One of the most drama-
tic results is that a Puerto Rican baby at 
birth can now expect to live to 70 years. 
All these are impressive gains, but it is 
certainly logical to ask how much of Puerto 
Rico's experience has any relevance to the 
needs of other developing areas, and how 
much is peculiar to its own special condi-
tions. Primary among these, of course, is the 
special economic-political relation with the 
United States. 
Let it be said from the outset that Puerto 
Rico's spectacular growth could never have 
been achieved without its special relation-
ship to the United States. But it is equally 
true that this relationship did not automa-
tically give Puerto Rico a passport to pros-
perity. The fiscal and trade relations with 
the United States which exist today are 
almost precisely the same as those which 
existed from 1898 to 1940. Yet prior to 1910, 
the economic situation of Puerto Rico was 
desperate. The great change in productivity 
and per capita income has taken place only 
in recent years, and despite the fact that 
the economic intrinsics have not changed. 
"Why?" you may ask. 
And here let me say frankly that I will 
give you a personal opinion, rather than a 
scientific evaluation. I believe that the 
heart of Puerto Rico's spectacular growth 
lies in the very high quality and notable 
stability of its government; in its true, 
genuine concern for social as well as eco-
nomic development, and in its constant con-
sideration of the human element. 
Puerto Rico has been fortunate in having 
a stable, dedicated, democratic local govern-
ment, whose chief executive and leading fig-
ure was Governor Luis Munoz Marin until 
his retirement this year. It has been a gov-
ernment characterized by unfaltering devo-
tion to the public welfare, by noteworthy 
sentiment of honesty, and by the tireless 
participation of a number of men of unusual 
competence and imagination. 
Secondly, the Puerto Rican Government 
never lost sight of the fact that its economic 
development programs were for people, and 
that they had to be translated into social 
and economic benefits for people as rapidly 
as possible. The people, in turn, having 
confidence that the government was deeply 
responsive to their needs and hopes, were 
willing to make necessary sacrifices over 
many years while the development programs 
were getting slowly underway. It was es-
sentially a political challenge and, in all de-
veloping areas, one of the most critical and 
most difficult?to provide inspiration and 
hope of the type which unleashes a sustained, 
creative outpouring of energy, even when 
early, visible returns are meager. Providing 
this kind of inspiration was one of the out-
standing accomplishments of Governor 
Mufioz and his government. 
Finally, both in government and in other 
fields, there has been an extraordinarily rapid 
accumulation of education, of expertise, 
and of skills. Barely 16 years ago, there were 
virtually no industrial skills or tradition in 
Puerto Rico, for example. Today, most of 
the highly sophisticated industrial plants 
have Puerto Rican managers, to say nothing 
of Puerto Rican engineers and technicians. 
A whole new generation of industrial and 
commercial entrepreneurs has sprung up with 
astonishing speed. This is only one facet 
of Puerto Rico's vast effort in education. 
In sum, the basic reason for Puerto Rico's 
rapid growth has been good government, a, 
genuine concern for people, and a passion 
for education. Stirred together, these have 
accounted for the explosion of energy which 
has allowed Puerto Rico to tackle successfully 
a job which many regarded as impossible. 
Indeed, It is fair to say that the economic 
benefits of Puerto Rico's special relation-
ship with the United States have barely 
compensated for its dearth of raw materials. 
lack of local market, and its former lack of 
industrial tradition or capital. These special 
benefits merely gave Puerto Rico a fighting 
chance. Many other developing countries 
have, on balance, a fax more promising 
pattern of intrinsic circurdstances than 
Puerto Rico has, even today. 
In final analysis, which countries succeed 
and which ones flounder, usually reduces it-
self to the human element. The great nat-
ural riches of any country, in the absence of 
good government, are only a mockery. Yet 
basically poor countries can, with good gov-
ernment, achieve remarkable feats, seemingly 
in defiance of the laws of economic gravity. 
Although perhaps the case of Puerto Rico 
is unusual, this, in my opinion, is the really 
important lesson of Puerto Rico's develop-
ment. There are, of course, a number of 
specific Puerto Rican techniques and ex-
periences which could be studied--and are 
studied?by other developing countries. I 
refer, for example, to Puerto Rico's highly 
effective promotional techniques for attract-
ing maximum amounts of investments and 
tourists, and the mechanisms of the Eco-
nomic Development Administration for 
translating these into income and jobs at 
an accelerated rate. But in essence, these 
techniques are meaningless unless there is 
honesty, dedication, and competence in gov-
ernment, to provide overall planning and 
leadership. Alongside such prime require-
ment, all else pales into insignificance. 
While the Puerto Rico experience merits 
the study of underdeveloped countries, in my 
belief, it also illustrates a very valuable les-
son for developed countries. It is these 
countries which are asked, through various 
channels, to help finance the development of 
the poorer countries. For them to do so will-
ingly and enthusiastically it is useful to be 
able to appeal to their self-interest, as well 
as to their conscience. 
For years the theory of development has 
been that, once an area was well on the way 
to higher income, it would become a suffi-
ciently attractive market that the countries 
contributing to its development would profit

economically, as well as morally and polit-
ically. Here Puerto Rico has become a telling 
example. 
In 1940, when its per capita income was 
only $121, Puerto Rico's outside purchases 
were negligible; it bought an insignificant 
$107 million a year from the United States. 
But in 1864, as a direct result of its growing 
prosperity, Puerto Rico purchased nearly 
one and a quarter billion dollars from the 
continental United States?an increase of 
more than 10 times. 
This level of purchases makes puerto Rico 
one of the most important U.S. markets in 
the world, moreover. Though it is difficult 
to believe, little Puerto Rico?with only 
2,500,000 people?now is a more important 
market for U.S. products than 17 European 
nations combined. it buys more from the 
United States than all 44 countries of the 
African continent. It purchases more than 
all the east coast countries of South Amer-
ica, including Brazil and Argentina, plus all 
the Caribbean Islands combined?a total of 
14 countries, 
In the entire world, only Canada and Japah 
buy substantially more from the United 
States than Puerto Rico; Great Britain, and 
West Germany purchase slightly more. But 
on a per capita basis, Puerto Rico is far 
ahead of all these important markets, buying 
8490 per capita per year of U.S. products. 
This has become an important factor in 
the economy of 47 States and there are now 
150,000 jobs in the continental United States 
which are dependent on Puerto Rico's high 
level of purchases. 
In sum, a formerly poor area was an 
insignificant market. As a direct result of 
its rapid economic development, however, 
it has become one of the really imoprtant 
World markets, despite its small size and 
popultaion. This suggests that, if other 
underdeveloped conutries could also increase 
their per capita income, even at a much more 
modest rate, the growth in new and profita-
ble markets for the developed nations could 
'become almost staggering in scale. 
I would like to end on a frankly political 
note. In the Caribbean, historically, Cuba 
has been a rich island, happily endowed with 
great expanses of fertile fields, raw materials, 
and other natural blessings. Puerto Rico 
has been the poor cousin, whose heavy popu-
lation pressure against scarce natural re-
sourCes is one of the most unfavorable in 
the world. Yet in the 5 years since Castro 
has ruled rich Cuba, its per capita income 
has declined by 15 percent. During these 
same 5 years, Puerto Rico's per capita in-
come has risen by more than 50 percent. 
can think of few statistics which are more 
sobering. And, for developing areas, I can 
think of none that are more meaningful.

Mr. ADDABBO. Mr. Speaker, Queens 
County, N.Y., has lost a distinguished 
citizen, a former Member of this body, 
the Honorable William F. Brunner. 
Mr. Brunner gave a lifetime of service 
to his community, State, and Nation. 
This man will be sorely missed, and I ex-
tend my heartfelt sympathies to his loved 
ones. 
Following is the article outlining the 
life and service to, his fellow man of Mr. 
Brunner as it appeared in the Long Is-
land Daily Press: 
WILL/AM BRUNNER FUNERAL TUESDAY 
Former Representative William F. Brunner, 
of Neponsit, is dead at 77. 
He died yesterday in Peninsula General 
Hospital, Edgemere. 
Mass will be offered Tuesday at 10 a.m. in 
St. Francis de Sales Catholic Church, Belle 
Harbor. 
Burial will follow in St. John's Cemetery, 
Middle Village. 
Mr. Brunner died yesterday at 1:45 p.m. in 
the hospital which he served as president 
of the board of trustees for the last 19 years. 
He relinquished the presidency earlier this 
month. 
Already a patient in the hospital, Mr. 
Brunner left his hospital bed to attend a 
dinner in his honor on April 12 when he 
announced his retirement as president. Ile 
was named president emeritus and was 
presented with a plaque. 
The plaque has been set up in the hos-
pital's lobby. The next day, Mr. Brunner 
was back in his hospital bed. 
Mr. Brunner was born in Woodhaven, 
September 15, 1887, and moved with his par-
ents to Rockaway Beach in 1908. 
Throughout his lifetime, his major inter-
est was the Rockaways. 
He married the former Theresa Poggi in 
1919, and they have a son, William Brunner, 
Jr., and four grandchildren. Mr. Brunner 
lived at 145 Bch. 145th Street. 
Mr. Brunner graduated from Public School 
44, Rockaway Beach in 1902, and attended 
Far Rockaway High School until 1906. He 
then attended St. Leonard's Academy and 
graduated from Packard Commercial School. 
At the age of 13 he delivered bread and 
rolls at 4 a.m, before school, and then again 
after school for his parent's bakery. He 
managed and played with the New York 
Nationals, one of the outstanding profes-
sional teams of the era. In 1912 the team, 
traveling between New York and ,Minneapolis, 
won 42 of 45 games. Three years later the 
team compiled a 45-to-1 record and played at 
the San Prancisc0 World's Fair. 
Before World War I, he engaged in gen-
eral contracting, trucking, and the ice busi-
ness under the name of Consolidated Ice 
& Trucking Corp. He served for 18 months in 
the Navy during World War I and saw duty 
abroad the flagship, U.S.S. Seattle. 
After his discharge he started a sightseeing 
bus route between Rockaway Park and Rock-
away Point. 
While driving a bus, his friendS talked him 
Into, entering politics. Brunner was elected 
to the assembly as a Democrat for seven terms 
beginning in 1922. 
As an assemblyman he had legislation

RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. HERLONG. Mr. Speaker, under 
leave to extend my remarks, I offer here 
a letter received recently by a doctor in 
this country from Americans now living 
in Germany. 
I think this is another example of the 
end of the road with socialized medicine: 
MUNICH, GERMANY. 
DEAR DR.  : I am sitting around 
the house recuperating from an appendec-
tomy and naturally our conversation has 
been related to things medical and eventu-
ally we got around to discussing you and 
medical practices in the States. Therefore, 
I thought I would take this opportunity, 
since I have the time, to bring you up to 
date on the adventures of   clan in 
Germany. 
As you probably remember, almost 3 years 
ago, my wife transferred over here in a preg-
nant condition. How, I understand, but 
why, I will never know. To say that she 
was emotionally distraught by the situation 
would be an understatement. She had vi-
sions of torture chambers and SS doctors 
experimenting on her. She refused to even 
see a doctor for the first 7 months. I think 
we both sort of hoped that if 'we ignored 
her condition long enough it might possibly 
go away. We finally faced the facts and she 
collected names of several doctors from our 
English-speaking friends. 
The first one we tried had an office in an 
old building straight out of a Charles Adams 
cartoon. The doctor himself fit the part. 
He was shorter than my wife but when he 
met her he clicked his heels, bowed low, and 
kissed her hand. There was no physical 
examination. Just information as to what 
hospital and the revelation that she would 
probably not see him again until after the 
baby was born since a midwife at the hos-
pital took care of all this nasty stuff. As 
you may well imagine, this just about did 
it. I was now searching for a competent 
psychiatrist as well as an 0.B. 
The Second doctor we tried was reCom-
mended by a German friend. She was a 
"Frauen Arzt" who spoke limited English. 
She Was highly recommended as a surgeon 
and an O.B. Her office downtown was very 
modern even by stateside standards. She 
turned out to be quite a character. Her 
practice was most "privet" which means 
she had to be good since the Deutschers 
would never spend their own money for 
something they could get free from the so-
cialized doctors. She made frequent trips to 
the States for research and is supposed to be 
quite famous for a plastic surgery operation 
on the uterus. She gave my wife an exami-
nation and put her on calciurn pills. She 
also gave her the address of a gymnasium 
where She was supposed to take exercises to 
prepare her for a "natural childbirth." She 
promised that she Would be at the hospital 
even though the hospital had an around-the-
clock midwife for such things. Claire decided 
to string along with her since the was the 
best we had found. That is, everything ex-
cept the gymnasium. 
As it turned out, Claire never really con-
vinced herself that she was going to have this 
baby in Deutschland. She was 3 weekS late 
when Dr.   put her in the hospital to 
induce labor. It didn't work and several 
days later it started itself. / took her to 
the hospital and into the labor room. They 
are quite democrtic about things like that in 
a "privet" hospital. In fact I could have 
spent the afternoon watching the whole show 
if I so desired. 
Her labor was in bed with a pillow. When 
Claire asked Dr. when they were going 
to the delivery room she tinEwered that the 
baby would be delivered right where she was. 
"What, in a bed?" "Of course," Dr.   
answered, "where else would you expect a 
baby to be delivered?" When Claire told 
her that all previous babies had been de-
livered on an operating table she answered, 
"How horrible." Of course this was no ordi-
nary bed since the foot eventually broke away 
and there were fittings for stirrups. 
All did not go well, however, since Alex-
ander "Der Gross" not only had knotted his 
cord but also had it wrapped around his neck. 
It was impossible to knock Claire out com-
pletely since every bit of oxygen they could 
get was needed. He was quite blue when he 
was finally delivered but fortunately he sur-
vived with no ill effects. Dr. explained 
that Claire had an emotional block that pre-
vented her from delivering the baby on 
schedule. She said the sac was loaded with 
excess calcium. 
The hospital for a "privet" patient is run 
quite similar to a hotel. The door is kept 
closed and nurses come in only for the bare 
essentials. Visiting is unlimited day or night. 
No water is ever provided the patients since 
they are very down on drinking water over 
here. Claire could have all the beer and 
champagne she wanted, but no water. "Sekt 
macht Mulch." You ought to try that on 
your patients if you could run it by the AA. 
The price of this "privet" room was about 
$9 (United States) a day. In winter they 
have a Heizung charge of about 75 cents they 
add on to this. The use of the nursery and 
the delivery room was about the same or a 
little cheaper than the States. My Travelers 
insurance paid for everything except about 
$17 of the total bill. Dr. charged $200 
for her fee. This you must realize is about 
top price here since most people use the 
government facilities. 
We have lived over here almost 3 years 
and I think I have seen enough to say a few 
competent words regarding socialized 'medi-
cine. I feel that Germany is not only 50 
years behind but I can't see how they can 
ever catch up under the present system. The 
first thing that strikes you is the great num-
ber of amputees you see. At first I thought 
this was due to the war but it suddenly 
dawned on me one day that most of these 
people were young and born after the war. 
The cause of this, and German doctors I have 
spoken to about it have admitted the same, 
is that doctors do not have the time, for 
reasons I'll explain later. They can only go 
so far and then they amputate. They get so 
much money for each patient and they can-
not let a single patient monopolite their 
time, They must see an average of 60 
patients a day to make a living. About 95 
percent of these amputations would be un-
necessary by stateside standards. I know of 
a German family of eight who periodically 
go to the doctor with imaginary aches and 
pains because he will prescribe tea for them. 
They then get their tea free from the gov-
ernment. If you multiply the million of tea 
drinkers by the number of people who clutter 
the doctor's office for aspirin, band-aids, eye-
wash, cotton, etc., it is easy to see why a 
patient who really needs medical aid cannot 
get it. The doctor is the middleman in this 
governmental dispensary but he does not 
discourage it. He needs the 60 signed yellow 
slips each day to make a living. 
A patient entering a hospital has no doctor 
responsible for him but is subject to every 
doctor working in the hospital. A doctor 
treating a patient in the hospital may find 
that when he returns the next day, another 
doctor may have amputated on the patient 
he was treating. I heard one young doctor 
complaining that on a "privet" patient no 
one could do anything unless he had the 
permission of the doctor in charge of the 
patient. He said it prevented him from 
doing a lot of things he wanted to do. All 
I could do was to whisper, "Thank God." 
The Deutscher of today is still not a free-
thinking individual. The stigma of the 
"police state" is still stamped somewhere 
In the back of his brain. He would rather 
be legal than right. He derives maximum 
security from the multitude of laws and 
stamped legal documents he must carry for 
ordinary living. The "Stempel" is his God. 
Because of this ingrained characteristic he 
feels that this grist mill they call medicine 
emanating from the "Bund" is the best they 
can expect. They accept it without com-
plaint because they have been conditioned 
for it and chalk up the loss of an arm or a 
leg as "ungluck." 
My appendicitis began about 5 weeks ago 
In Berlin. After about 24 hours of a pain 
in my side I came back to Munich. Claire 
drove me to the emergency ward of the 
public hospital to get a blood count. I was 
taken to a small room by the intern and 
given two flat thermometers. I was in-
structed to crawl up on a narrow table and 
take my temperatures. The intern then left 
the room. How these Deutschers can bal-
ance on that narrow table and rectally take 
their own temperature while holding another 
thermometer in their armpit is an arcrobatic 
feat I will never master. I think I estab-
lished medical history by having the same 
temperature at both ends. I now know 
that if you hold a thermometer under each 
armpit they will both read 37.5? C. and sur-
prise the doctor. 
I finally got the blood count and it reg-
istered 11,000. I didn't know if that was 
high or not hut they did want to operate 
right away. I stalled them and got in touch 
with Dr. ---- who recommended a surgeon. 
I entered the hospital on a Sunday evening. 
I met the doctor and talked to him for about 
2 minutes. I was later given a stomach shave 
and an enema. The next morning I was 
given a sedative and wheeled to the operat-
ing room. There was no physical examina-
tion or past history interrogation. I could 
have been a born bleeder or subject to 
coronary attacks but the doctor would have 
never known it. The only information they 
had on me was my address and that I was a 
"privet" patient. I was told later that since 
they don't have the time to do these things 
with the government patients that most doc-
tors have also eliminated it from their pri-
vate patients. 
It will be 5 weeks tomorrow since the op-
eration and I am still not back to work. I 
had actually gone to Berlin last Monday to 
resume flying but I was seized with pains 
every time I breathed, running from the scar 
up to the base of my right rib cage. I had 
to come back to Munich. I saw the doctor 
yesterday and he explained "auf Deutsch" 
that my "Blinddarm" was on the wrong side 
of my liver and they had quite a bit of trou-
ble getting it out. He prescribed "spaziern 
and frische Luft." 
Well, enough of this ranting. I just 
thought that maybe you would be interested 
in our experience on this medical frontier. 
Claire said that she may possibly add some-
thing so I will close. If you ever possibly 
tear yourself away and decide to aggravate 
the outflow of gold by taking a European 
vacation, we would love to have you stay with 
us. Give our best to everyone.

means that the local contractor who had 
local people working for him would not be 
subject to the hazard that some contractor 
from another part of the country might un-
derbid him on the basis that he could import 
cheap labor into that area and could under-
bid the local contractor, and depress the local 
economy. 
In the 87th Congress I coauthored an 
? amendment to the administration's Ur-
ban Mass Transportation Act which ap-
plied the Davis-Bacon principle to that 
program. The Senate Committee on 
Banking and Currency agreed to the 
amendment which then became Part of 
the Mass Transportation Act enacted in 
mid-1964. In 1964, the 88th Congress 
also accepted revision of the Davis-Bacon 
Act, which I also coauthored, to include 
the fringe benefits previously mentioned. 
The fact that the Congress has stead-
ily extended and improved the original 
Davis-Bacon concept is gratifying. 
However, additional revision is needed. 
The legislation which I have offered 
would fill an acute gap in the present 
law. 
The Davis-Bacon concept should be 
extended to the maintenance contracts?
such as those dealing with the replace-
ment, modification, reconstruction, and 
demolition of a structure or project?
which are made after the original con-
struction has been completed. At this 
time, on military and other Federal in-
stallations in my own State and through-
Out America, we have the strange zigzag 
pattern where prevailing wages?and 
thus protection for local contractors and 
local workers?are honored during the 
construction phase but ignored when 
maintenance work?including replace 
-
Ment, modification, reconstruction, or 
demolition?occurs. Whole crews of out-
of-State workers are brought in to per-
form such work below prevailing local 
wages while our local contractors and 
workers are literally standing outside the 
fence looking in. This condition is nei-
ther logical nor consistent. It certainly 
is not fair. The Federal Government 
should riot condone unfair practices after 
construction while preventing them dur-
ing construction. It should not, through 
Inaction, encourage substandard work-
ing conditions. Interestingly enough, on 
State public works projects in California, 
alteration, demolition, or repair work, as 
well as construction, have been covered 
since the "little" Davis-Bacon Act, 
adopted by the California Legislature in 
1937. The State act has worked success-
fully and has, the support of contractors 
and workers in the areas involved. 
- Mr. President, revision of the Federal 
law is long overdue. I hope that the 
Congress rill choose to amend the Davis-
Bacon Act along the lines suggested in 
S. 1797. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of S. 1797 be printed 
at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
s. 1797

tend its application to contracts for the 
maintenance of Federal installations

ployed on public buildings of the trnited 
States and the District of Columlaia by con-
tractors and subcontractors, and for other 
purposes", approved March 8, 1961, as 
amended (40 U.S.C. 2'76a-6), is amended to 
read as follows: 
"Szc. 7. A contract for maintenance work

BILLS AND RESOLUTION 
Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, the dis-
tinguished junior Senator from Okla-
homa [Mr. HARRIS] has asked to be listed 
as a cosponsor of S. 1675, creating a 
commission to be known as the Presiden-
tial Commission on Simplification of the 
Income Tax Laws, a bill introduced by 
me. I ask unanimous consent that he 
may be included as a cosponsor and that 
his name be added at the next printing 
of the bill. 
The PRESIDING OrriCER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. HARRIS subsequently said: Mr. 
President, in my opinion, nothing has 
greater influence and impact on our 
business lives and actions than the in-
come tax laws. Therefore, those laws 
Should be so simple that all of us can 
know in advance the consequences of our 
acts and business dealings. It is impera-

JOE THORNE AND THE 
WAR 
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President?
The PRESIDING GierICER. The 
Senator from South Dakota is recog-
nized. 
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that I may be 
permitted to proceed for 5 minutes be-
yond the regular 3-minute limitation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
out objection, the Senator from South 
Dakota is recognized for 8 minutes. 
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, on 
Easter Sunday, one of South Dakota's 
most outstanding young men, 1st Lt. 
Josef L. Thorne, of Brookings, was killed 
when the helicopter he was piloting was 
shot down in Vietnam. Joe Thorne, one 
of the alltime great football stars in 
South Dakota's history, was known and 
respected across our State. He was a 
hero to thousands of South Dakota 
schoolboys. His death brings the war 
in Vietnam closer to the heart of every 
South Dakota citizen. 
The son of Mr. and Mrs. M. L. Thorne, 
of Brookings, Joe was married to the 
former Diane Hover, daughter of Dr. 
and Mrs. Glen Hover, of Clear Lake, 
S. Dak. His wife and his 3-year-old son, 
Travis, have been residing in Clear Lake 
during his absence. Three brothers, 
Roy, of Sioux Falls, Tim and Tracy, both 
at home, and two sisters, Mrs. Dennis 
Weiland, of New Orleans, and Julie, at 
home, also survive him. 
Mr. President, Joe Thorne was an un-
usual man. He was described by his 
coach at South Dakota State University, 
Ralph Ginn, as "one of the greatest 
young men I have ever worked with. 
His football record speaks for itself, but 
as a man, he was first team all the way." 
Coach Ginn continued: 
He made a terrific impact on our football. 
I have never known of a player in our con-
ference that opponents respected More than 
they did Joe ThOrne. We never had a foot-
ball player at South Dakota State that com-
manded as great respect of his teammates 
and coaches as Joe 
To illustrate Theme's humility, Coach 
Ginn told how he would frequently pass 
up sitting with stars on the football 
team bus to join some third or fourth 
stringer who barely got to make the trip. 
Mr. President, one of the saddest 
aspects of Joe Theme's death is that 
those closest to him feel that it was a 
needless sacrifice. His father and 
mother told me in broken tones over the 
telephone that they hoped I would do 
everything in my power as a Member of 
the Senate to end this "foolish war in 
Vietnam." These grieving parents ex-
pressed the hope that their son's death 
would dramatize the futility of trying to 
Impose a solution by arms in an area of 
political chaos and economic misery. 
Said Mr. Thorne: 
It is too late to save Joe, but do everything 
you can to get those other boys out of there 
before it is too late. Let's work out a settle-
ment of this war, save our own boys, and 
stop shooting up that little country. 
In a letter which Mr. Thorne sent me 
following his son's death he referred to 
photos and movies which his son sent

home that "depict much of the life of 
the Vietnamese and the need they have 
for almost anything other than arms 
and military." Then he wrote: 
SWOT, GEORGE, I will do everything within 
my power to assist you, in bringing to the 
minds of our people the real need in Viet-
nam. 
Joe's lovely widow, Diane, also told me 
in a, telephone conversation that the only 
consolation she could draw from his 
death is the hope that it might somehow 
hasten a settlement of the war. 
Lieutenant Thorne's father sent me a 
copy of a letter from his son dated Feb-
ruary 19, with permission to quote Por-
tions of it into the CONGRESSIONAL REC-
ORD. The letter reads as follows: 
Today the Vietnamese are having another 
coup (anyway a shakeup in the govern-
ment). The Army and Air Force (Vietna-
mese) are fighting among themselves. I still 
don't know what's going on. 
I'm doing fine and don't worry about a 
big war breaking out over this thing here in 
Vietnam. To be honest the cause is lost. 
We can't possibly win (at least as long as 
the Vietnamese do things the way they do). 
Don't get me wrong, when I say we can't win, 
doesn't mean?the United States is getting 
beat. Lately we have lost some people In 
hotel bombings, etc., but if the Vietnamese 
people could be depended on, it wouldn't 
happen. I don't think the Vietnamese peo-
ple care one way or another. They are the 
ones who are getting beat, not us. 
You can't win when you can't drive over 
any road in the whole country. The people 
can but the soldiers can't. 
We could come over here and clean this 
up, but it wouldn't do any good, cause the 
sante thing would happen when we pulled 
out. 
Mr. President I believe that there is no 
American vital interest in the outcome 
of the Vietnamese turmoil which justifies 
the death of men like Joe Thorne. There 
are predictions in the Washington press, 
more specifically in a recent column by 
the noted Columnists Rowland Evans and 
Robert Novak, that our Government is 
preparing to send upwards of 100,000 
American 'boys to Vietnam. Does this 
mean that we are prepared to sacrifice 
a hundred thousand Joe Thornes in this 
highly questionable ventaire in the south-
east Asia jungle? If we take that course 
we will have ignored the warnings of 
such respected generals as Dwight 
Eisenhower and Douglas MacArthur, 
who have both said that it would be 
disastrous for America to get sucked into 
another major land war on the Asian 
mainland. 
I believe that President Johnson is try-
ing to avoid that course. I applaud his 
repeated offers to enter into negotiations. 
I only hope that he will marshal all of 
his great skill and wisdom to seek out 
every possible way of reaching a peaceful 
settlement of this war before it claims 
many more Joe Thornes. 
It is, encouraging that the President 
has named Averell Harriman to repre-
sent our country in the proposed con-
ference to Insure the neutrality of Cam-
bodia. That conference could open a 
window to discussions of' the Vietnamese 
war. Mr. Harriman was a key figure in 
No. 
negotiating a settlement-in Laos in 1962. 
He has the experience and the wisdom 
needed to undertake additional steps to-
ward peace in southeast Asia. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that news accounts of Lieutenant 
Thorne's death, published in the Brook-
ings Register of April 21; a feature ar-
ticle published in the Sioux Falls Argus-
Leader of April 23; and a stirring report 
on April 20 by KELO?TV sportscaster, 
Jim Burt, be printed at this point in the 
RECORD. 
Mr. President, I also ask unanimous 
consent that two thoughtful editorials, 
one entitled "Time To Review Our Viet-
nam Policy," signed by Mr. Fred C. 
Christopherson and published in the 
Sioux Falls Argus-Leader of April 25, 
and the other, entitled "Sincere Dis-
senter," published in the Watertown 
Public Opinion of April 19, be printed at 
this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the articles, 
report, and editorials were ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD, as follows:

HELICOPTER SHOT DOWN: LT. JOE THORNE 
VIETNAM CASUALTY 
First Lt. Josef L. "Joe" Thorne, 24, son of 
Mr. and Mrs, M. L. Thorne, of 2028 Elmwood 
Drive, Brookings, and one of the alltime 
great football stars at South Dakota State 
University, was killed Easter Sunday when 
his helicopter was shot down in Vietnam, his 
parents were notified by the Department of 
the Army. 
Lieutenant Thorne, a 1963 graduate of 
State, was assigned to the 145th Aviation 
Airlift Platoon with the American advisory 
forces in South Vietnain. 
According to the initial telegram received 
Monday morning by the Thornes, he was air-
craft commander of a UH-1B helicopter 
which was on a combat assault mission Sun-
day night when his aircraft was hit by hostile 
small arms ground fire. The craft crashed 
and exploded on impact. 
A second telegram, received Tuesday, veri-
fied that Lieutenant Thorne had been Identi-
fied as one of the casualties. 
Mr. Thorne said the body of his son will 
be brought to Brookings for burial. How-
ever, no arrangements had been made at 
press time today, awaiting further informa-
tion from the Department of the Army. 
A native of International Falls, Minn., 
where he was born November 17, 1940, Lieu-
tanent Thorne had spent most of his boyhood 
days at Gettysburg, S. Dak. The family 
moved to Beresford when he was a junior 
in high school and he graduated from that 
school in 1958. He enrolled in the fall of 
1958 at South Dakota State University in 
Brookings, where he starred on the Jack-
rabbit football teams of 1959, 1960, and 1961, 
and spent another year at State, "receiving a 
degree in civil engineering in August of 1963. 
It was also in August 1963 that he was 
commissioned a second lieutenant in the 
Army Reserve Officers Training Corps at 
State. Assigned to active duty status on 
Eeptember 18, 1963, he attended school at 
Fort Sill, Okla., then took flight training at 
Fort Wolters, Tex. and later at Fort Rucker, 
Ala. 
He was assigned to Vietnam the first part 
of November last year for a 12-month tour 
of duty, and was nearing the halfway mark 
in his oversea tour at the time of his death. 
Lieutenant Thorne was married to the 
former Diane Hover, daughter of Hr. and Mrs. 
Glen Hover, of Clear Lake, and was the father 
8467 
'of a 3-year-old son, Travis. Mrs. Thorne 
and their young son had been making their 
home in Clear Lake while he was in Vietnam, 
and she was enrolled as a student at State. 
In addition to his wife and son, Lieutenant 
Thorne is survived by his parents; three 
brothers, Roy, of Sioux Falls, Tim and Tracy. 
both at home; and two sisters, Mrs. Dennis 
Weiland, of New Orleans, La.., and Julie, at 
home. 
[From the Brookings (S. Dak.) Register, 
' Apr. 21, 19651 
THORNE ONE OF ALLTIME GRID GREATS Al' 
STATE 
A name that will not soon be forgotten in 
the annals of South Dakota State grid greats, 
Joe Thorne appears destined to go down in 
history as one of the finest athletes to ever 
wear the blue and gold of the football jack-
rabbits. 
A two-time all-North Central Conference 
selection, Thorne was killed Sunday night 
when his assault helicopter was shot down 
by hostile gunfire over Vietnam. 
Thorne, named by the Associated Press as 
a second team Little All-American selection 
in 1961, holds three school records. It was 
in that same year that he scored 50 points in 
NCC play and tied with Dan Boals, of State 
College of Iowa, for "most valuable back" 
honors in the conference. 
Said Ralph Ginn, head football coach at 
State upon learning of the death of Thorne, 
"This certainly brings the war close to home 
when we lose a young man such as Joe. His 
loss is a terrific loss to our society." 
Ginn often referred to his 191-pound back 
as "the best fullback I've ever had." His 
blocking ability and his prowess on defense 
earned him the respect of his coach as much 
as his running talents did. 
Thorne's 3 school records, all set in 1961, 
include most times carried in 1 game, 30 
against SOI; most carries in 1 season, 171, 
and most net yards in 1 game, 200 against 
Morningside. 
But it wasn't on the grid turf alone that 
Thorne stood out. Said Ginn, "As far as the 
boy is concerned, he was one of the greatest 
young men I've ever worked with. His foot-
ball record speaks for itself, but as a man he 
was first team all the way." 
Ginn continued, "In your years of coaching 
you work with a lot of boys. It seems like 
some become a part of you. That's the way 
It was with Joe." 
"He made a terrific impact on our football. 
I've never known of a player in our confer-
ence that opponents respected more than 
tphlaecye. did Joe Thorne. It was the same every 
Ginn commented that it was too bad op-
ponents didn't have the opportunity to know 
him other than in football. 
"We've never had a football player at 
South Dakota State that commanded as 
great respect of his teammates and coaches 
as Joe did." Coach Ginn labeled Thorne "a 
great captain." He was cocaptain with 
Mike Sterner of the 1961 team when the 
Jackrabbits shared the league title with 
State College of Iowa. 
Thorne was named "most valuable" mem-
ber of the Jackrabbit football team, both in 
1960 and 1961, by the Brookings Rotary Club 
and the Collegian, campus newspaper at 
State. 
In 8 years (1959-61) as a member of 
Jackrabbit football teams, he gained a total 
of 2,156 net yards rushing in 426 carries, for 
a healthy ,5-yard-per-carry average. He 
scored 140 points during his 3-year career, 
including 12 touchdowns and 2 points after 
touchdown-74 points?in 1961; 7 touch-
downs and 3 points after touchdown for 48 
points in 1960; and 3 touchdowns for 18 
points in 1959.

LETTERS AND GIFTS ARRIVE AFTER WORD OF 
THORNE'S Dzerx 
(By Bob Renshaw) 
CLEAR LAKE, S. DAK.?TOO young to Com-
prehend that his daddy will not be coming 
home, 3-year-old Travis Thorne played with 
candy eggs the Easter bunny brought to the 
home of his grandparents, Dr. and Mrs. G. P. 
Hover. 
He has been living here with his mother 
while his father, Lt. Joe-Thorne has been 
oversee. In the last letter to his wife 
Thorne, who was one of the allthne great 
football stars at South Dakota State Uni-
versity, told of plans to attend an Easter 
service -on the beach in Vietnam where he 
WEIS serving as a helicopter pilot. 
That letter, along with two others, arrived 
after she had been notified that her husband 
had been killed when his helicopter was shot 
down Easter Sunday night. Easter gifts?
a Vietnamese robe for his wife and suit for 
his son?as well as gifts for his younger 
brother in Brookings and for a neighbor girl 
with whom Travis plays have also come since 
his death. 
REQUESTS DUTY 
When he first arrived in Vietnam, accord-
ing to Mrs. Thorne, he flew VIP's and mail 
for a couple of weeks and then started flying 
troops into battle. He requested duty as 
pilot of an armed ship. His wife said he ex-
plained that he would be flying in the same 
combat areas and it would be no more dan-
gerous flying an armed helicopter than an 
unarmed troop carrier. 
Mrs. Thorne said he had told her father 
that he wasn't afraid of dying, but that he 
hated to leave Diane and Travis for so long. 
Some of his loneliness for his family was ex-
pressed in his last letter when he said, "* ? * 
You know, Diane, all the things I've done 
over here. Well, all I have to do now is re-
peat everything and it will be time to come 
back. Hope God stays with us and sees fit 
for me to return. No sense worrying about 
It.,, 
SENSES TENSION 
His last letter was written at the forward 
base of Nah Trang on the back of his orders 
because he had left his stationery at the 
home base in Phan Thiet. Mrs. Thorne said 
that in his letters starting with March 30 
she seemed to detect a feeling of growing 
tension. 
April 6 for the first time he told of enemy 
fire coming close, with tracer bullets striking 
within a half mile of the hotel where he was 
staying. Lack of good housing had never 
been a problem because troops are billeted 
in old resort hotels built by the French dur-
ing the time they were in Vietnam. 
Mrs. Thorne said his letters told how sorry 
he felt POT the children in Vietnam, how they 
would gather around in swarms when the 
helicopter landed and how they loved to 
have their pictures taken. 
Funeral services for Lieutenant Thorne will 
be held at South Dakota State University, 
Brookings, when the body has been returned. 
Mrs. Thorne requested that all memorials be 
sent to the Joe Thorne Memorial Fund, 
South Dakota State University. It will be 
used to establish an athletic scholarship at 
the university. 
She said her husband didn't care for a lot 
of publicity. "Joe really didn't like big 
splashes. He would be saying 'no' to all 
this," she continued. "He was very sincere 
about everything and hated a big show. He 
wanted people to like him for what he was." 
ECHOES SENTIMENTS 
Ralph Ginn, who coached Thorne at 
South Dakota State University, echoed Mrs. 
Thorne's sentiments. "Joe wanted to be good 
and was willing to pay for it. But he got a 
real thrill from achieving and not from the 
glory that went with it," said Ginn. 
To illustrate Thorne's humility, Ginn told 
how he would pass up sitting with stars on 
the bus to join some third or fourth stringer 
who barely got to make the trip. "He was 
very appreciative of what coaches and oth-
ers did for him," said Ginn. "I never heard 
him criticize a teammate and he never ali-
bied to me. I never had a player who held 
so much respect of teammates, coaches and 
opponents." 
Jim BURT'S SPORTS SCOREBOARD, APRIL 20, 1965 
BURT. The war in Vietnam came closer to 
home today. Especially to those who knew 
Joe Thorne. The former South Dakota State 
football star's body was recovered today after 
the helicopter he was piloting was shot down 
yesterday. When such a tragedy occurs, it 
gives cause for reviving exploits of an in-
dividual?and with Joe Thorne, this is not 
difficult. (Pix.) 
Prx No. 1. We can easily recall watching 
and describing Thorne's explosive running?
his devastating blocking. He was one of the 
most brilliant grid performers we have seen. 
Thorne's name still is attached to three 
South Dakota State school football records. 
Most times carried in one gaine-30?most 
times carried in one season-174 and most 
net yards gained in one game, 200. 
Bram He was cocaptain of the Jackrabbit 
football team in 1961. All North Central 
Conference fullback in 1960 and 1961. He 
tied with Dan Boa's of SCI in 1961 for Most 
Valuable Back Award. He won the Collegian's 
Most Valuable Player Award both in 1980 and 
1961. In 1961 he was second in the North 
Central Conference scoring with 50 points. 
In his 3-year varsity career he carried 426 
times?gained 2,178 yards, lost only 22, for a 
net of 2,156. In his senior year his average 
per carry was 5.5 yards. He scored 22 touch-
downs, ran for 4 extra points, for a scoring 
total of 140 points. He was named second 
team fullback on the 1961 AP Little All-
American team. Thorne was dratted by the 
Green Bay Packers but never played pro ball. 
His football record is there to be admired?
and challenged. But, Joe Thorne as an in-
dividual went deeper than that. As Head 
Football Coach Ralph Ginn said "As a man 
he was first team all the way." (Pix.) 
Pim No. 2 (super name). 
Bum Those comments are typical of those 
who were closely associated with the former 
star athlete. Joe's wife Diane lives at Clear 
Lake with her parents and 3-year-old son 
Travis. She said, "Joe loved what he was 
doing. He was fighting for a cause and never 
once did he complain or regret what he was 
doing. I'm sure Joe had no regrets, he could 
never sit on the sidelines." Coach Ginn said 
he has never known a player in the North 
Central Conference which commanded more 
respect from opponents. Joe probably flew 
his copter like he played football. An in-
tense, determined, bulldozing runner who 
saw no barriers. Joe Thorne joins a list of 
valiant Americans who have fought?and 
died?heroically for their country. Joe 
Thorne?the athlete?and the man?will 
long be remembered.

CHRISTOPHERSON'S NOTEBOOK: TIME TO RE-
lam OUR VIETNAM POLICY 
The expanding military activity in Viet-
nam is disconcerting, and more and more 
people are beginning to wonder just how and 
where it will end. 
About the developments in Vietnam today 
is a scene of frustration and Uncertainty 
comparable to that which prevailed while 
the Korean struggle was underway several 
years ago. 
In respect to Korea, there was confusion 
about our objectives and our methods. The 
same attitude exists now. 
The conflict in Korea was terminated, hap-
pily, before it broadened into a major war. 
Many like to believe that the Vietnam epi-
sode will end similarly. But there's doubt, 
plus bewilderment, accentuated by the reali-
zation the problem seems to become more 
perplexing week after week. 
KEEN PUBLIC INTEREST 
This deep concern about Vietnam was 
very likely the reason why an overflow crowd 
assembled at luncheon in Nettleton Manor 
Thursday to hear Senator GEORGE McGovssue, 
of South Dakota, discuss the matter. The 
luncheon was first scheduled to be a small 
one with members of the Public Affairs Com-
mittee and the directors of the Chamber of 
Commerce. But so many were eager to be 
present that the public generally was in-
vited. 
Perhaps the interest was intensified by 
the fact that McGovenie previously had inch- " 
cated a difference with the administration 
on Vietnam policy, suggesting that we 
should explore the possibilities of negotiat-
ing a settlement. 
In his Thursday speech here, he explained 
why he considered negotiation both desir-
able and feasible. And, judging from the 
reception he received and the close attention 
paid to his remarks, there were many in the 
audience who shared his opinion. 
THE ALTERNATIVES 
The question about alternatives naturally 
arises. If we don't negotiate, what do we do? 
One answer is to say we should either go 
into Vietnam with great enough strength to 
smash the opposition. Another is that we 
should withdraw. 
Flaws can be found, however, with both of 
these suggestions. 
If we go into the conflict with a full de-
termination to smash the opposition, we in-
vite sharp retaliation from both Red China 
and Russia. And that means moving right 
to the brink of major war and perhaps over 
It. We faced the same problem in Korea and 
our leaders wisely refrained from taking that 
gamble. 
The other prospect?that of withdrawal?
is also inadequate. If we do so, it may be 
maintained through the Asiatic southeast 
that we are, as the Red Chinese insist, just 
"a paper tiger." Withdrawal would be her-
alded widely as an American defeat and a 
Red Chinese triumph and it could be charged 
that we had deserted those who had de-
pended on us. 
WE DO HAVE STRENGTH 
Between the two alternatives?an all-out 
smash or withdrawal?is the possibility of 
negotiation. 
There are those who say that this isn't the 
time for a discussion of that and we should 
wait until we are ready to negotiate from 
strength. This means, of course, after we 
have beaten North Vietnam into a state of 
at least partial submission. 
One may be sure, though, that the Red 
Chinese also may be reluctant to allow us 
to acquire this so-called position of strength. 
There will be growing resistance. 
But what seems to be overlooked by many 
is that we are right now, as Senator McGov-
ERN pointed out Thursday, in a position to 
negotiate from strength. 
We have the power in the Pacific and 
Asiatic waters to smash Red China to bits. 
The Red Chinese know this. And when 
you have that kind of strength behind you, 
you aren't negotiating from a position of 
weakness. We could approach the confer-
ence table with some mighty powerful cards 
on our side and those negotiating with us 
would be well aware of this.

F. C. CEIRISTOPHEASON. 
[From the Watertown (S. Dak.) Public 
Opinion, Apr. 19, 1965j 
? , 
,ST-IcQPREDXSRVPITEal 
, 
There are many degrees of political cour-
age but South Dakota Senator _OsoSeE MC-
'GOVERN is exhibiting one of the greatest?
espousal of the unpopular side of a great 
netional issue, even as his political peers 
try to shut him up. 
The issue: Should the United States be-
econe increasingly involved in South Viet-
nam as the dangers of an escalated war loom 
greater? 
McGovEaN's stand: No. , 
lie stands fast on this line and hasn't been 
ehary about saying so, even when such per-
sonal friends and influential big names as 
Hussar FlurEENREY and McGeorge Bundy have 
urged him to keep silent on behalf of na-
tional unity. McGovEaN keeps right on op-
posing the U.S. role in Vietnam and doing 
so out where JCItS of people see and hear him. 
Chicken"? Appeaser malcontent? By no 
means. ,McGovEEN points out that he is 
neither a. pacifist nor an isolationist but 
simply, ,"I don't belieVe military aid can be 
used effectively in southeast Asia. The prob-
lems there are ones of internal,political revo-
lution." 
In other words, in the McGovern book, 
America is charging along a jungle path in 
Vietnam that 18 pot only militarily futile 
but very costly and extremely dangerous. He 
recently told Bucknell University Students, 
"It seems clear that we are now on a spiral 
of bloWS and counterblows Which could lead 
to a major war under the worst possible con-
ditions for the United. States." 
He, has recalled his food-for-peace days and 
reflected: "The extensive traveling I did in 
Asia and Latin America convinced, me that 
the basic problems in these areas are ones 
of huhger, illiteracy, and bad government. 
These are the problems we should attack. In 
South Vietnam, we inherited the hostility 
and Mess pat came from 59 years of French 
Misrule and. exploitation." 
MoGovEEN obviously is under no illusions 
as to the political hazard of his own position. 
For the junior Senator from a prairie State to 
so aiplaillantiy oppose a major policy and com-
mitment pf his own party and administra-
tion, and to do it repeatedly while spurning 
big brother atteMpts_ to shush him, takes a 
? brand of 'nerve One doesn't yery often' 
these days, particularly not in politics. And 
to compound it, McGovEEN displayed some-
thing of the same independent attitude when 
he openly expressed his disappointment over 
some facets of the admiuistration's Pew farm 
program * * "-* and vowed to -work to cor-
rect them. 
MCGOVERN'S views have not prevailed and 
it is unlikely that they will. But whether 
they do or not, the man who endorses them, 
and does so most effectively, has increased 
his stature among many people for his sin-
cerity, his steadfastness, and his willingness 
to "go for broke" in behalf of an ideal he 
honestly believes is right. 
VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965 
Mr. STENNIS, Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I may yield to 
the distinguished Senator from Oregon 
for 2 minutes. 
Mr. MORSE. I shall defer to the Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, as the 
debate on the yoting yightsjoill has con-
tinued, I have become more and more 
amazed that the Senate would even seri-
ously consider passing the section of the 
bill that would abolish poll taxes in State 
and local elections. I shall not speak on 
this subject now, except to sound a grave 
warning that to pass a bill to abolish the 
poll tax by statute would actually leave 
our Constitution in shambles and would 
make a mockery of the Senate's respon-
sibility. The real question before the 
Senate is not the approval or disapproval 
of the payment of a poll tax as a prereq-
uisite for voting. 
The real and only question is the con-
stitutional question as to whether the 
Senate has the power and authority to 
pass such a measure by means of a 
statute. No less a person than the Presi-
dent of the 'United States, yesterday in a 
press conference, said that to abolish the 
poll tax requirement by statute would 
raise a constitutional problem. He said 
he believed that if the poll tax were to 
be abolished, it must be abolished by an 
amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States. That statement comes 
from the highest source of responsibility 
under our Federal Government. Cer-
tainly those are not idle words and this 
statement by the President is consistent 
with what he said as a Senator on March 
9, 1949?00NGRESSI0NAL RECORD, page 
2047. The President?then a Senator 
from Texas?said: 
The framers of the Constitution of the 
United States were plain, specific, and unam-
biguous in providing that each State should 
have the right to prescribe the qualifications 
of its electorate and that the qualifications of 
electors voting for IVIembers of Congress 
should be the same as the qualifications of 
electors voting for members of the most nu-
merous branch of the State legislatures. For 
that reason, and that reason alone, I believe 
that the proposed anti-poll-tax measures in-
troduced in previous sessions of this body 
and advocated in the President's civil-rights 
program is wholly unconstitutional and vio-
lates the rights of the States guaranteed by 
section 2 of article I of the Constitution. 
Not only has the President recently 
spoken on this subject, but also the At-
torney General of the United States, Mr. 
Katzenbach, has stated most recently 
that the provision of the bill that would 
abolish the poll tax in the election of 
8469 
State officers is invalid. The Attorney 
General made that statement in his testi-
mony before our subcommittee. He also 
made the statement to a national tale-
vision audience recently on "Meet the 
Press." 
Not only have those two high officials 
spoken out on this issue, but also the dis-
tinguished majority leader, the Senator 
from Montana [Mr. MANSFIELD] and the 
distinguished minority leader, the Sena-
tor from Illinois [Mr. DnucsEw] are op-
posed to that part of the bill which at-
tempts to abolish the poll tax by statute. 
They know that it would be unconstitu-
tional to do so. 
That the poll tax cannot be repealed 
without constitutional amendment is so 
well settled and firmly established that 
further discussion of the question would 
seem unnecessary. In 1960, by a vote of 
50 to 37, the Senate clearly established 
the precedent that a constitutional 
amendment was necessary to abolish the 
poll tax in Federal elections. In 1962, 
the Senate reaffirmed that position when 
it adopted a resolution proposing a con-
stitutional amendment applicable to Fed-
eral elections. That amendment is now 
part of the Constitution. In the course 
of debate on that resolution the Senate 
rejected by a vote of 59 to 34 the conten-
tion that the poll tax could be abolished 
by mere statute. 
The Attorney General of the United 
States has said that the provision with 
regard to abolishing the poll tax in the 
election of State officers is invalid. He 
made that statement in his own testi-
mony before our subcommittee, and he 
also made it to a national television au-
dience on "Meet the Press." 
The distinguished majority leader is 
opposed to that part of the bill which 
attempts to abolish poll taxes by statute 
because it would be unconstitutional to 
do so. The distinguished minority leader 
has stated his opposition to this section 
of the bill on the grounds that it is un-
constitutional. 
The law on this is as clear as a bell. 
In 1951 the Supreme Court affirmed 
Butler v. Thompson, 97 F. Supp. 17, 
(D.C.E.D. Va., 1951), wherein the district 
court cited the case of Breedlove v. Sat-
ties, 302 U.S. 277 (1937), and held: 
To make payment of poll taxes a prerequis-
ite of voting is not to deny any privilege or 
immunity protected by the 14th amendment. 
Privilege of voting is not derived from the 
United States, but is conferred by the State 
and, save as restrained by the 15th and 19th 
amendments and other provisions of th Fed-
eral Constitution, the State may condition 
suffrage as it deems appropriate. 
That decision of the U.S. Supreme 
Court now stands as the law of the land. 
It is there for all to see. It is absolutely 
clear. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
time of the Senator has expired. 
Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I may be per-
mitted to continue for an additional 2 
minutes.

support the Constitution of the United 
States. This is a constitutional matter 
that must be acknowledged. Every Sen-
ator must be governed by it, whether or 
not he agrees with its holding. 
I do not impugn the integrity or sincer-
ity of anyone. I point out that the de-
cision should be made by each individual 
Senator. It cannot be avoided or dele-
gated to another party by merely shrug-
ging the shoulders and saying, "We elect 
to let the courts pass on it." That pro-
cedure would not follow the letter or 
spirit of the Constitution of the United 
States. 
Every Senator must be governed by the 
constitutional conclusion that he may 
have on this question, regardless of how 
he may feel with reference to the poll 
tax itself. 
The proposed bill was drafted in the 
atmosphere of massive public demon-
strations, introduced in the Senate, and 
referred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary; under such limitations it was neces-
sary that the committee hold only a few 
days of hearings and then frantically 
meet in executive session to report a bill. 
On several occasions, reports reached 
the public that a revised or substitute 
version had been agreed upon by a ma-
jority of the committee; then, before 
that substitute could hardly be printed, 
numerous amendments would be offered 
thereto. Finally, upon the last day in 
which the committee had to consider this 
measure, what may well be called a con-
glomerate bill was put together and re-
ported to the Senate. 
I commend the majority and minority 
leaders, the Attorney General of the 
United States, and the President for 
coining out positively and definitely With 
a flew and correct statement on this 
matter. It seems to me, with all due def-
erence to every Member of this great 
body, that merely to let the court decide 
such a measure would be a dereliction of 
our duty. 
How derelict of our strict duty can 
we become? How mueh can we abdicate 
our responbilities as members of the leg-
islative branch of the Government just 
because the marchers march in Wash-
ington and at the White House? I can-
not believe that a majority will succumb 
to this emotional appeal to set aside the 
Constitution. I know that we should 
promptly vote this provision down. 
I hope that we may have an early vote 
upon this far-reaching act. 
Mr. HILL, Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. STENNIS. I yield. 
Mr. HILL. I commend the Senator 
from Mississippi for his very fine state-
ment. I wish to a associate myself with 
his statement. 
Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator. 
Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, I asso-
ciate myself with the remarks of the 
junior Senator from Mississippi. 
THE PRESIDENT'S NEWS CON-
FERENCE OF YESTERDAY ON 
VIETNAM 
mr. MORSE. Mr. President the 
President's news conference of yesterday 
marked another effort on the part of his 
administration to cloak a policy of war 
In the mantle of peace. 
But all the while the President speaks 
of our desire for peace, he ignores all the 
efforts the United States has led in the 
last 20 years to devise means of keeping 
peace. I refer to our participation in 
and support of the United Nations and 
of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organiza-
tion. 
The President speaks eloquently about 
the lessons of history. But he has missed 
the greatest lesson of all, which is that no 
one nation can determine where and how 
the peace shall be kept without fighting 
eternal wars. 
The specter of Munich, which was 
raised yesterday by the President, is the 
favorite image of the advocates of the 
war in Vietnam. But which of them is 
willing to argue that in 1938 the United 
States should have sent troops to Czech-
oslovakia to fight Germany alone? 
Which of them is willing to say that the 
intervention by Italy, Germany, and the 
Soviet Union into the Spanish Civil War 
was a good thing because each of them 
thought they were stopping the other's 
aggression before it could get started? 
The real lesson of Munich and the 
Spanish Civil War is that nations acting 
unilaterally to protect their self-interest 
as they see it are going to get into wars. 
It is especially tragic to see two great 
ideological contestants again fighting 
over the prostrated body of a third coun-
try, very much as the fascists and Com-
munists fought over the corpse of Spain, 
all in the name of preventing someone 
else's alleged aggression. 
It was because of the events that led 
up to World War II and because of the 
war itself that the United Nations was 
set up, and no nation desired more 
earnestly than the United States that it 
be used to save mankind from another 
scourge of war. 
Yet when the President of the United 
States talks about the international his-
tory of the last 27 years and its lessons, 
he makes no mention at all of the United 
Nations and its peace-keeping function. 
Apparently we are well on the way to 
emulating the French Bourbons who for-
got nothing and learned nothing. 
The President is quite wrong in be-
lieving that we who oppose our policy in 
Vietnam have ignored the terror and the 
bombings committed by the Communists. 
No doubt his attention is drawn to our 
criticisms and not to our condemnations 
of the Communists. But one can hardly 
say that Americans have the right to 
fight a civil war in another land and still 
remain immune from retaliation or at-
tack. I have roundly criticized time and 
time again the tactics and terrorism a 
the Vietcong. I have critized the bomb-
ing of the American Embassy in Saigon, 
and the killing and maiming of innocent 
civilians, both American and South Viet-
namese. Likewise I have critized the 
atrocities of the South Vietnamese prac-
ticed upon the Vietcong with U.S. mili-
tary standing by doing nothing to en-
force the Geneva Treaty covering the 
treatment of war prisoners. I have 
criticized terrorism and atrocities com-
mitted by Vietcong. 
Of course the sad part is that the 
United States cannot expunge the rec-
ord as to our own involvement in this 
dirty war. We have escalated it. We 
have participated in it. We have walked 
out on our peace keeping obligations 
under international law. 
What in the world would lead the 
President to think that North Vietnam 
would not attack, starting with our 
escalation at Tonkin Bay? We can start 
with the American course of action in 
Tonkin Bay. From that time on, North 
Vietnam has proceeded at an ever-
escalating rate to make war. We asked 
for it. We should have taken North 
Vietnams violations of international law 
at Tonkin Bay to the United Nations in-
stead of going beyond the point of self-
defense by committing acts of aggression 
of our own. 
We have made the Vietnam civil war 
our war, and no one has done more to 
make it our war than President Johnson. 
In my opinion, we have been fortunate so 
far that our casualties have been so light 
and the attacks upon American civilians 
as few as they have been. 
I invite the President's attention to the 
fact that despite the barrage of statistics 
from the Pentagon ,eeking to demon-
strate that the Vietcong are being killed 
in large numbers, and that they are kill-
ing large nuMbers of civilians in South 
Vietnam by terrorist methods, the Penta-
gon informs me that it has no figure of 
any kind on the number of Vietnamese 
civilians killen by the military activities 
of the United States and the South Viet-
nam Army. Yet people who have been to 
that sad country tell of hospitals being 
filled with victims of our air raids and our 
fire bombings, and the ground activities 
of the South Vietnamese Army. Also no 
statistics are being given the American 
people of the civilians the bombings in 
North Vietnam are killing. 
It takes at least two to make a war. 
We are one of the parties making it in 
Vietnam today. 
The President's press conference yes-
terday was a graphic demonstration of 
how impossible it is for contesting par-
ties to prevent war, or to stop a war 
before it can get started. All the admin-
istration is able to do under its present 
policy is to do what nations have been 
doing for hundreds of years before us, 
and that is to try to justify its own war. 
With the hope that it may in some 
form reach the President's eyes, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed at the 
conclusion of my remarks a speech pre-
pared by Benjamin V. Cohen entitled 
"The United Nations in Its Twentieth 
Year," and delivered at the Hebrew Uni-
versity of Jerusalem on April 27, 1965.

Mr. President, I close by inviting the 
attention of the Senate to an announce-
ment just received on the ticker, as fol-

SAmorr.?Air strikes against North Viet-

choking off aid to the Vietcong, and a land 
invasion of the north should begin immedi-
ately, the commander of South Vietnam's 
Air Force says. 
"If we are just going to bomb communica-
tion lines, the Vietcong will be able to stand 
up for a long time, I'm afraid. So the next 
step must be big?either a big escalation of 
the war or negotiations," Brig. Gen. Nguyen 
Cao Ky told the Associated Press in an ex-
clusive interview today. 
While the bulk of the raids against North 
Vietnam have been flown by U.S. Air Force 
and Navy planes, Ky's propeller-driven Sky-
raider bombers also have been over North 
Vietnam nearly every day. 
The 34-year-old general has flown three 
Of the missions himself and was grazed by 
enemy flak on one of them. Three of his 
pilots have been shot down. 
"The raids against communications are 
not really effective," he said. "The Commu-
nists can always find ways of moving through 
the jungle. 
"But if we were to set up a kind of 'na-
tional liberation pont' in the north, we 
could do the same things to the Communists 
that they've been doing to us here. We have 
superiority in the air over North Vietnam's 
central area from the 17th to the 20th paral-
lels, and we could easily supply guerrillas of 
Our own there. 
"The people in that area are basically anti-
Communist and I'm sure they would help us. 
Then we could really start cutting their sup-
ply lines and giving them something to worry 
about." 
Let there be no doubt in the minds of 
the American people that our South 
Vietnamese allies are going to continue 
to put on the pressure that the United 
States escalate the war into a big front 
in Asia. 
I repeat?what the administration 
does not like to hear me say?namely, a 
deep conviction of mine based upon my 
conclusions from the briefings I have 
received as a member of the Committee 
on Foreign Relations. I believe that. if 
we follow the Johnson course of action in 
Asia, in not too many months from now 
we shall be involved in a massive war in 
Asia which will take hundreds of thou-
'sands of American boys to Asia. 
What is the alternative that we should 
try? It is an alternative that the Presi-
dent has not attempted to try. 
In my judgment, the only way the 
President can prove his intentions for a 
Peaceful settlement of the war in Asia 
is to proceed to use the procedures of 
international law as they now exist. 
That means that the President should 
lay the problem before the United Na-
tions, pledging his cooperation to the 
United Nations to help enforce the peace 
in Asia. We slionld ask our alleged 
allies, who are also signers of the United 
Nations Charter, to assume their obliga-
tion to ,take United Nations action in 
southeast Asia, 
Until the president does that, he will 
continue to be. justifiably criticized, as I 
have been critipizing him. 
If we wish peace, we must resort to 
peaceful procedures to accomplish that 
end, instead of making statements which 
seek to shroud the war in Asia with 
peace talk. 
Once more I repeat that the United 
States is no longer in a position that per-
mits it to conduct bilateral negotiations 
with North Vietnam, the Vietcong and 
Red China. Negotiations for peace must 
now be conducted by nonparticipants 
sitting at the head of the table under 
the auspices and procedure of the United 
Nations. 
Mr. President, the administration is 
going to great lengths through its own 
officials and through newsmen it can in-
fluence to depict the protests on Ameri-
can campuses' against our Vietnam war 
as irresponsible, "off-beat," and disrepu-
table. Last week, on April 22 and 23, a 
"teach-in" on the Vietnam war was held 
at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, 
N.J. 
I ask unanimous consent to have three 
articles from the campus paper, the Rut-
gers Daily Targum of April 26, printed 
at the close of these remarks. One is an 
editorial headed: "The Dawn of a New 
Era." The second is a letter to the edi-
tor from Hank Wallace, and the third 
is a report entitled: "Teach-in Triumph," 
written by Steve Herman. 
This report on the value, the impact, 
and the conclusions of a teach-in on the 
Rutgers campus cannot be brushed off by 
an administration and a Secretary of 
State anxious to silence questions and 
criticisms of an anxious intellectual com-
munity. If they continue trying to do 
so, they are going to find themselves 
deserted and frankly opposed by an in-
creasingly large body of American public 
opinion. 
There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the REcORD, 
as follows: 
[From the Rutgers Daily Targum, Apr. 26, 
1965] 
THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA 
The dawn surely rose over Warren Bus-
man Friday morning. As daylight broke 
through the foggy horizon surrounding Scott 
Hall at 5:30 a.m., so did the dawn of a new 
era in the history of the university break 
through as Busman began to talk. It was 
brillant climax to what will go down as 
the greatest event at Rutgers in the last 25 
years?it is not likely to be duplicated for 
another 25. 
FEVER PITCH 
The teach-in Thursday night-Friday 
morning to protest the war in Vietnam was, 
indeed, the faculty and student body's finest 
hour. The electric intensity which accom-
panied the magniflcient and impassioned 
faculty oratory spread infectiously through-
out the 1,000-man audience until it reached 
a fever pitch during the now historic Sus-
man-Fitzpatrick exchange. Never again will 
this university, in all likelihood, see a sim-
ilar expression of political-emotional senti-
ments expressed by such a percentage of the 
student body. 
Although we have complained in the past 
about student nondirection and nonactivity, 
We were stunned by the turnout and the gen-
eral seriousness of purpose which character-
ized Friday's rally. Although the atmosphere 
was one of gaiety?helped along, no doubt, by 
relaxation of Douglass curfew laws?there 
was an overriding importance to the students 
involved which extended far beyond the 
scope of socialisation. 
For once, the university was truly a forum 
of ideas. A certain portion of the faculty 
proved incontravertibly that they were re-
sponsible to both their profession and to 
the student body. 
Contrary to James Reston in Wednesday's 
New York Times, this was not "propaganda of 
the most vicious nature." This was a logical, 
clear forward interchange of ideas?it is un-
fortunate, perhaps, that the "stay-in-the-
war" partisans could not have found a more 
effective spokesman for themselves than Wil-
liam Fitzpatrick. He was hopelessly out-
classed. 
HIGH POINT IN DRAMA 
The teach-in team was superb. Susmon 
was at his bombastic, dazzling, persuasive 
and didactic best. His interlude with Fitz-
patrick hit a high point in sheer drama never 
again to be equaled. The three standing 
ovations he received during his peroration 
were indicative of the heights of esteem in 
which the student body holds him. The cold 
assertive logic of Lloyd Gardner's assess-
ment of American-Asian relations, and the 
southern tones of Carter Jefferson's surveyal 
of the French role in southeast Asia best 
complemented Susman's oration. 
There was one extremely sour note 
sounded, however. Notwithstanding the ap-
parent spuriousness of the alleged "Colonel" 
of the "Christian Unity Party"?a purported 
neo-Fascist front?we have nothing but utter 
contempt for the university students who 
went along with the hoax. We do not partic-
ularly consider the Nazi Party to be an 
amusing divertissement. We are also in no 
way amused by either the sickeningly infan-
tile and puerile actions of the students who 
"sieg heiled" along with Stetler or by the 
students who disgraced themselves and the 
university with their vile banners in Scott 
Hall. Such apparently psychopathic minds 
have no place in any institution of higher 
learning. 
Disregarding this one blemish, the teach-
in was a brilliant success. The faculty has 
proven themselves to be responsible to the 
student body and the student body has 
proven themselves worthy of a topflight 
faculty. We may never see its like again. 
LETTERS: FINEST 8 HOURS 
DEAR SIR: Years from now Rutgersmen will 
say this was their finest 8 hours. 
The potential of our university was real-
ized at the teach-in Friday morning. 
Pulled together in a few days by a small 
group of professors, everything clicked: 
Proponents on all sides of the Vietnam 
problem were spontaneous and outspoken, 
yet the exciting lecture series and the effec-
tively distributed breaks were kept tightly 
on schedule but not stifled by coordinator 
Dr. Seymour Zenchelsky, 
Happily, Rutgers College's finest hours 
were shared by hundreds of Douglass girls, 
for whom curfew was waived to further the 
coed-izing of the new Rutgers University. 
Student response was overwhelming: Scott 
Hall walls were lined with standees through 
half the morning, and an astonishing num-
ber of students saw the adjournment at 8. 
Luckily WRSU recorded the entire program 
on a dozen tapes. Jan Ploshnick recom-
mended at 7:30 a.m, that an audio transcript 
be sent to the White House. 
Perhaps a written transcript also could be 
produced in booklet form, available to stu-
dents, faculty, and the public. 
Since the time of the flood 200 years ago, 
Rutgers has never more nearly approached 
its destiny as a great university.

class. It was the beginning of another day. 
For others, however, Friday morning was the 
end of what must be described as one Of the 
most exciting and wonderful evenings in 
their lives. For at 8 a.m. "the teach-in" to 
expose students to the various Issues in 
problems in connection with the Vietnam 
problem came to an end, 
The lecture discussion marathon began at 
12 midnight in Scott Hall 123 before approxi-
mately 1,000 students?most of whom were 
either concerned and worried ebout U.S. 
policy in Vietnam or were just curious to see 
what the whole thing was about 
The audience was not made up of "kooks," 
but consisted of a cross section of the Rutgers 
community. And, as a matter Of fact, the 
only "kooks" who were present were some 
very unsophisticated and crude representa-
tives of the campus radical rightvring fringe. 
They carried signs with such slogans as 
"Better Dead than Red," "Blast the Chinks," 
and "? communism." These "kooks" 
also tried to rattle and heckle some of the 
professors, but they were all skillfully "put 
down.?' (After observing the performance of 
some of these characters, one student com-
mented "the lack of political acumen of the 
rightwingers is exceeded only by their stu-
pidity.") 
At 12 when Professor Zenchelsky started 
the program, Soott 123 had a standing-room-
only crowd, with people sitting on the stage, 
in the aisles, and in the lobby outside the 
room. The crowd surpassed any expectations 
that anyone may have had and it was a 
credit to most of the people there that they 
remained courteous and attentive few 8 hours. 
Even more credit, however, has to gei to 
the dozen professors who participated in 
this demonstration. They were all mag-
nificent (Warren Busman was "super") ? 
they had to be to keep the attention of 
such a large crowd. There was no repeti-
tion from one professor to another, each 
was an expert on his subject, and each one 
added something which was very construc-
tive. They all spoke from the heart as well 
as the Mind and their sentiments were felt 
by the entire audience. 
Sitting in Scott Hall?a little dizzy at 
times because of the smoke and lack of 
sleep?one got the impression that "this is 
college." There was a free and unobstructed 
exchange of some very controversial ideas 
on a most important and meaningful topic. 
And the message that the scholars were so 
eloquently sending was being received by a 
large and very enthusiastic audience. 
It seemed that in the middle of the night 
on legit Friday?an apathetic, disinterested, 
and bored student body had come to life?
' it was serving a reirpose?it was accomplish-
ing something. After leaving the teach-in--
whether one agreed with the views or not--
you had the feeling that something extraor-
dinary had taken place. Something con-
structive was done?time was spent with 
professors who spoke on a topic on which 
there would be no test, no grade, no quiz. 
Once again thank you profs?you were all 
great?it was an evening which will never 
be forgotten and an experience that un-
fortunately will probably not be repeated.

Tam UNITED NATIONS IN ITS 20TH YEAR: THE 
DAVID NILES MEMORIAL LECTURE AT THE 
HEBREW UNIVERSITY OF JERUSALEM, APRIL 27, 
1965 
(By Benjamin V. Cohen) 
It is a high honor to be asked to inaugu-
rate the David Niles Memorial Lectures at the 
Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 
I was privileged to know David Niles. He 
was a retiring, self-effacing man of quiet 
powers. Even with his close friends he sub-
ordinated his person to his work and to their 
work and even more frequently to other peo-
ple's welfare. He was by profession a social 
worker and both in public office and in non-
governmental work his principal concern was 
to help disadvantaged persons and groups to 
participate on a basis of *quality in the life 
and work of the community in which they 
chose to live. 
Quite early in his career he became inter-
ested in politics and government in order to 
secure the social and economic legislation 
necessary to protect disadvantaged persons 
and groups in our modern industrial society. 
He became active in the progressive move-
ment in the 1020's. Be took a prominent part 
in the LaFollette-Wheeler, third party cam-
paign in 1924 and became a close friend of 
the LaFollettes, father and sons, of Senator 
Wheeler and Senator Norris. And in nearly 
every presidential campaign thereafter he 
was active in organizing an independent 
committee of liberals to support the more 
liberal candidates of the two parties. 
I think it was Justice, then professor, Felix 
Frankfurter who first suggested to Harry 
Hopkins that David Niles belonged in the 
New Deal in Vrashington. David first worked 
as a personal assistant to Harry Ffopkins, 
then to President Roosevelt and then to 
President Truman?concerning himself prin-
cipally with the problems of the disadvan-
taged and minority groups. 
In these positions David worked quietly for 
years in Washington. Ile had a real passion 
for axtonimity, not being concerned with re-
ceiving public credit for what he did do and 
not troubling to deny blame attributed to 
him for what others did. 
His years with President Truman were par-
ticularly productive. He gave significant as-
sistance to President Truman in organizing 
and establishing in December 1946 the Presi-
dent's Committee on Civil Rights. It was the 
report of this Committee which gave great 
Impetus to the movement for effective Fed-
eral civil rights legislation in the United 
States in the last decade. But nothing gave 
David Niles quite so much satisfaction, I am 
sure, as his work with President Truman on 
the Palestine problem. President Truman 
was deeply affected by the plight of the Jew-
ish refugees in Europe at the close of the 
war and he turned to David for advice and 
assistance. President Truman discovered 
that the majority of the refugees wanted to 
go to Palestine and he was determined to 
help them get there. 
I cannot tell you all the things David Niles 
did or did. not do during the critical period 
of the Angelo-American Inquiry, the parti-
tion plan in the United. Nations, and the 
subsequent struggle of the Jews in Palestine 
to gain their independence and to establish 
the State of Israel?because I do not know. 
But I do know that there were great and 
honest differences of opinion within the 
American Government and feelings ran high 
among those opposed to the establishment 
of the State and those in favor of it. There 
were those who suggested David was bring-
ing political pressure on the State Depart-
ment as if control of foreign policy in a 
democracy through the President and the 
Congress was unwarranted political pressure. 
But I feel confident when all the records are 
disclosed and all passion is spent it will be 
revealed that the greatest service David Niles 
rendered was to keep the President fully in-
formed as to how his policies and directives 
were being carried out in the Various depart-
ments of government so that the President 
could. knowingly exercise his constitutional 
responsibilities. David performed this deli-
cate and difficult task with great ability and 
skill. For this task conscientiously and 
faithfully performed we should gratefully 
honor his memory. 
When I informed M. Truman I was to give 
the first David Niles Memorial Lecture here, 
he wrote me as follows: 
"I was very fond of Dave Niles and I trusted. 
him as I did. few men, 
"If there ever lived a man dedicated to the 
cause and plight of the abused, persecuted, 
and 'Oppressed, it was Dave Niles. His con-
cern for these people was mirrored in his 
face?a face I will always remember for its 
solemn sadness and compassion. 
"Yours sincerely, 
"Matey S. TRUMAN." 
In view of David Niles' great interest in 
the United Nations as he watched the de-
velopment of the United Nations Palestine 
partition plan, I thought it would be ap-
propriate for me to take as the subject of 
the first David Niles memorial lecture?"The 
United Nations in Its 20th Year." As I shall 
be particularly concerned with some develop-
ments and trends which in my view threaten 
to undermine the first and primary purpose 
of the United Nations?that is to maintain 
international peace and security?I do not 
want you to think that I am unaware of the 
great difficulties with which the United Na-
tions has had to contend and the consider-
able progress it has made in many spheres of 
its activities. 
When the charter was drafted it was con-
templated that the Great Powers would work 
out an acceptable peace which the United 
Nations could maintain. But a stable and 
acceptable peace?a consensus or modicum 
of common understanding on the basic prin-
ciples of coexistence?was never established 
after the last world war. The Great Powers 
were in no position to cooperate to maintain 
a peace the terms of which they were unable 
to agree upon. Rivalry and conflict among 
the. Great Powers led to a cold war in which 
the adversaries lost sight of their common 
interest in peace and were prone to exploit 
their differences rather than to attempt to 
find means of composing them. Even apart 
from the cold war the whole world was strug-
gling to adjust itself to revolutionary politi-
cal, economic and social changes, and the 
adjustment in many areas was difficult, pain-
ful, and not altogether rational. There was 
widespread need of adjustment to the radi-
cally Changed conditions of life which mo-
dern science and technology made possible. 
In many areas the striving for economic im-
provement was accompanied by movements 
to break the bonds of colonial rule and 
fuedal and tribal relationships. The very 
survival of the United Nations under these 
circumstances attests to humanity's essential 
need of the United Nations as an instru-
ment of international cooperation in a world 
which has become increasingly intedepend-
ent despite ideological national and cul-
tural differences and outlooks. 
It is amazing the number of international 
institutions which have been created in the 
last two decades within the framework of the 
United Nations and its specialized agencies 
to meet the varied needs of states and their 
people. There is not only the United Na-
tions but UNESCO, UNICEF, the World 
Health Organization, the Food and Agricul-
tural Organization, the Monetary Fund, and 
the World Bank, GATT, the several regional 
U.N. economic commissions, the expanded 
program of technical assistance, the Special 
Fund, the Trade and Development Confer-
ence, and many more. In the modern world 
all states have felt the need in various ways 
of participating in cooperative international 
activities, and international cooperation is 
becoming the norm in many spheres of ac-
tivities. 
Technology has broken down the barrier: 
of time and distance. New vistas bring new 
opportunities but new dangers. For good or 
ill, states cannot avoid multiple contacta 
with the outside world and increasing orga-
nization on an international basis is neces 
sary to avoid conflict and promote common 
welfare. This is particularly true in the 
case of states emerging from colonial status. 
There can be no revolution of rising expecta-
tions in these underdeveloped lands without 
access to the tools and know-how of modern 
science and technology. To have such accesa, 
colonialism must not give way to a narrow

isolationism with its turbulent nationalism 
or resurgent tribalism, but must be succeeded 
by enlightened international cooperation. 
Continued progress in the substitution of 
international cooperation for the old colo-
nial relationship will be necessary in the 
years ahead for the common welfare of the 
people of the old as well as new states. 
International cooperation within the gen-
eral frame*ork of the United Nations during 
the past 20 years has been much more wide-
spread than it was within the framework 
of the League of Nations between the First 
and Second World Wars. This is an impor-
tant jneaaure due te the participation of the 
United States in these activities in con-
trast with its nonparticipation in most of the 
League's activities. The United Nations has 
aspired te a universality which was denied 
to the League because of America's absence. 
But it is important to remember that the 
universality to which the United Nations as-
pires is seriously threatened by the absence 
of representation of the mainland of China in 
United Nations' activities. 
. Without going into detail I think I have 
said enough to indicate that I am not un-
mindful of the growth and progress of many 
international activities within the frame-
work of the United Nations during the last 
20 years. But the many useful activities 
of the United Nations should not blind us 
to its faltering and disappointing progress 
in the fulfillment of its primary objective. 
While there may have been doubts and 
misgivings as to how the primary objective 
of the charter was to be achieved there was 
and can be no doubt what the primary ob-
jective of the charter was and is. It is not 
necessary to recite at length the purposes 
and principles of the charter as enumerated 
in articles 1 and 2 and as embellished in 
the preamble. Paragraph 1 of article 1 states 
the first and primary objective of the char-
ter?"to maintain international peace and 
security." All of the other stated purposes 
and principles of the charter are designed to 
strengthen and safeguard the primary pur-
pose of maintaining peace among nations. 
One.should, of course, avoid making dog-
matic judgments about bypassing the United 
_Nations. The United Nations is not a totali-
tarian institution. The charter does not re-
quire that all international acts and trans-
actions be done in or throug the United 
Nations. The charter expressly contemplates 
that parties to a dispute which may endanger 
the peace should, first of all, seek a solution 
by peaceful Means of their own choosing. 
But the charter provides no excuse for mem-
ber states, large or small, keeping disputes 
for which no peaceful solution has been 
found away from the United Nations until 
they have actually erupted into war. 
The basic law on which the charter was 
construeted in simple. It imposes no strait-
jacket, no impossible burden or restriction 
on any state. It is based on principles by 
which all nations, large as well as small, 
must live if mankind is long to survive on 
this planet in this nuclear age. The law 
of the charter which all members are pledged 
to observe is twofold. First it requires all 
states, large as well as small, to refrain in 
their international relations from the threat 
or use of force except in individual or col-
lective self-defense against armed attack, 
and all measures taken in the exercise of 
self-defense must be immediately reported 
to the Security Council. Second, the charter 
,required all statee, large and small, to set-
tle their disputes by peaceful means in such 
a manner that peace, security, and justice are 
not endangered. 
These two obligations of the charter are 
correlative. The surrender of the right of 
states to use force was not intended to 
leave states without any effective means of 
securing a redress of their , grievances. A 
state which resorts to force to redress its 
grievances without first invoking the pro-
cesses of the United Nations violates the 
charter. But a state which refuses to con-
sider the serious grievance of a sister state 
and refuses to agree to any procedure for 
peaceful settlement also violates the law of 
the charter. Force is proscribed as a means 
of settlement but members must be willing 
to negotiate and submit their disputes for 
settlement under some reasonable procedure. 
While the primary purpose of the United 
Nations must be to maintain peace, peace 
cannot be maintained without some mini-
mum redress of genuine grievances. This 
twofold law of the charter constitutes the 
heart of the charter. The law of the charter 
provides the minimum requirements neces-
sary to enable members to work together to 
outlaw the use of force as a means of settling 
International disputes and to provide pro-
cedures for the peaceful settlement of dis-
putes which threaten the peace. 
There have always been questions and 
doubts how the United Nations could enforce 
the obligations of the charter against re-
calcitrant states, particularly the great 
powers. But there can be no question that 
the great powers as well as the small powers 
obligated themselves to observe the law of 
the charter. The veto may have given the 
great powers the right to forestall Security 
Council action, it did not give them the 
right to deny their obligation under the 
charter to respect the law of the charter. 
The "Uniting for Peace Resolution" of 1950 
formally recognized- the right of the As-
sembly to recommend action based on the 
obligations of the great powers as well as 
the small powers to observe the law of the 
charter. 
In the early days of the charter the Soviet 
Union withdrew its troops from Iran, and 
France withdrew its troops from Syria to 
avoid charges of charter violation. In the 
early days of the charter it was assumed that 
if there was a threat to or breach of inter-
national peace, the United Nations would in 
one way or other be activated in an effort to 
stop the fighting and to restore peace. The 
U.N. may have been an imprefect instrument 
but it did help to restore peace in Greece, 
Kashmir and Korea. It also helped to re-
store peace in Israel when the State of Israel 
was first established and again at the time 
of the Suez difficulties even though the one-
sided character of some of the Assembly's 
resolutions in the latter case may have been 
unfortunate and unwarranted. 
Professions of faith in the United Nations 
and the law of the charter continue to be 
made in their formal addresses by heads of 
states and governments. But there has been 
a perceptible decline in the recognition and 
observance of the law of the charter, in the 
obligation to seek peaceful settlement or con-
tainment of disputes through the United Na-
tions before using or threatening to use force 
to resolve them. There are, to be sure, ex-
planations for these adverse developments?
ideological differences between the east and 
the west and marked contrast in social and 
economic conditions between the north and 
the south. These would be sufficient expla-
nations for nations trying to settle their dis-
putes peacefully when they could without 
burdening the United Nations with their 
troubles. But these are scarcely justification 
for nations taking the law into their own 
hands and threatening to use and actually 
using force without first submitting the case 
to and seeking the good offices of the United 
Nations to obtain a redress of their griev-
ances. It is said, however, that the United 
Nations cannot take care of its present bur-
dens and is in no position to assume more. 
Feigned concern for the United Nations is 
no excuse for any member violating the law 
of the charter without even attempting to 
fulfill its obligations Under the charter. If 
8473 
a member in good faith seeks the assistance 
of the United Nations to obtain a redress of 
its grievances against another state and the 
United Nations is, in fact, unable to act, it 
may then possibly be urged that there is a 
hits,us in the charter that would relieve the 
aggrieved state of its obligation not to take 
the law into its own hands. But charter 
obligations become illusory and the charter, 
as the last best hope of peace on earth, be-
comes a dying hope if member states resort to 
war for the settlement of their differences 
'without first at least invoking the good offices 
of the United Nations. Bypassing the United 
Nations under such circumstances, I fear, 
evinces more contempt than concern for the 
future of the United Nations. 
During the last decade or so, states have 
with disturbing frequency resorted to force 
or the threat of force without feeling even 
a sense of obligation of reporting their action 
in advance or even subsequently to the 
United Nations. One need only mention Rus-
sia in the case of Hungary. India in the case 
of Goa, and the United States in significant 
aspects of the Cuban and South Vietnam 
situations. I mention these instances not to 
single out a few states but to indicate the 
generality of the nonobservance. 
Some authorities have tried to justify the 
evisceration of the law of the charter by a 
latitudinarian construction of the right of 
self-defense under article Si and of the au-
thority of regional agencies under articles 
52 and 53. I fear many of these interpreta-
tions are based on opinions that the legal 
advisers are requested to render after, rather 
than before, the political decision to resort 
to force has been made by the responsible po-
litical officers. Some of the more latitudina-
rian constructions of the right of individual 
'and collective self-defense seems to me to 
militate against the spirit of the charter 
which is to bring disputes to the United Na-
tions before they erupt into war. Perhaps 
more important than the exact scope of the 
right of self-defense is the recognition that 
the right of self-defense, whatever it limits, 
affords no excuse for not bringing a dispute 
which threatens the peace of the United Na-
tions for settlement before the right of self-
defense is exercised if time permits and im-
mediately thereafter if prior submission is 
not possible. 
The rightful exercise of the right of self-
defense, in my view, is no excuse for continu-
ing to wage war without resort to the United 
Nations for peaceful settlement. Neither 
should the wrongful exercise of the right of 
self-defense, if discontinued at the request 
of the United Nations, deprive a member 
state of its right to secure a redress of its 
grievances as part of the United Nations proc-
esses of peaceful settlement. 
In recent years there has also been an at-
tempt to justify the evisceration of the law 
of the charter on the ground that the char-
ter does not forbid the use of force by one 
state at the request of the recognized gov-
ernment of another state to assist the latter 
state to quell a rebellion. Such a libertarian 
construction of the charter does violence to 
the letter and spirit of the charter. The 
armed intervention of one state in the civil 
war of another state whether at the request 
of the established government or its rival 
government is in fact the use of force by the 
intervening states in its international rela-
tions, whether the civil war be called a war 
of liberation or a war in defense of freedom. 
True the charter does not forbid civil war 
or deny the right to revolt. But it does not 
sanction the right of an outside state to 
participate in another's state civil war. If 
a civil war in one state threatens interna-
tional peace the United Nations may inter-
vene to deal with that threat, but no mem-
ber state on its own responsibility has the 
right to participate in the fighting in an-
other state's civil war, If differea states

recognize opposing factions in a civil war 
and participate in the fighting with oppos-
ing factions, they create and do not prevent 
a threat to international peace. Events in 
Europe in connection with the Spanish Civil , 
War made this obvious. This does not mean 
that arms may not be shipped to a friendly 
state threatened with rebellion; or that 
troops may not be sent to a friendly state 
to participate in a collective self-defense ac-
tion to repel an armed attack from another 
state; or that troops may not be dispatched 
to a friendly state to participate in a mission 
of mercy to prevent the massacre of inno-
cent civilians. But taking sides and fight-
ing in another state's civil war is quite a dif-
ferent matter. See, Cohen, "The United Na-
tions, Constitutional Developments, Growth, 
and Possibilities," Harvard University Press, 
1961, pages 53-54, 
It serves little purpose to debate the legal 
soundness of some of the interpretations 
given the charter under the impact of politi-
cal forces. A recent study of the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace ("The 
OAS, the U.N. and the United States," by Inis 
L. Claude, Jr., International Conciliation No. 
547, March 1964) demonstrates how under 
the impact of the cold war the U.S. Govern-
ment has come close to shifting its legal po-
sition completely on the relations between 
the United Nations and regional agencies. 
There is a sort of Gresham's law operating 
in the field of charter interpretation. No 
state can or will long operate under a rule 
of law that is not respected by its fellow 
states. A restatement of the rule may fare 
no better unless there is a change in the 
political environment and the forces which 
shape the decisions of the responsible po-
litical officers of the state. I do not agree 
with many international lawyers and teach-
ers with would like to have the Legal Com-
mittee have a monopoly on the legal ques-
tions arising under the charter in the Gen-
eral Assembly. I think it important that the 
highest political officers have a realtistic un-
derstanding of the meaning and effect of 
charter interpretations and not merely ac-
cept the advice of their legal experts pro 
forma when it does not matter, only to re-
ject and ignore it when it really touches a 
vital political nerve. , 
But whatever the causes or explanations, 
the law Of the charter which was to outlaw 
the use of force as a means of settling dis-
putes between states has fallen into desue-
tude. If we continue to accept this aban-
donment of the basic law of the charter re-
quiring all nations, large and small, to seek 
in good faith peaceful settlement through 
the processes of the United Nations before 
resorting to war, we shall have allowed the 
very heart to be torn from the charter. Im-
portant as are the technical and social serv-
Mee the United Nations may render the 
underdeveloped countries, these are but 
fringe benefits which will wither away once 
the heart of the United Nations ceases to 
beat. 
? ? 
What has gone wrong? Is it the fault of 
the charter? Is it due to the veto? Is it due 
to the excessive voting power of the small 
new states in the Assembly? Have we really 
exhausted the untried resources and poten-
tialities of the charter? 
The *barter May not be perfect. But it is 
not the charter that obstructs the way to 
petite. The charter sets forth a few basic 
principles but leaves to successive genera-
tions Who will live under it the responsibility 
of huffing suitable means of carrying out 
thote principles. The charter is not a self-
operating mechanism. Its operation de-
pends not so much on the words of the char-
ter as on the way member states exercise 
their rights and meet their responsibilities. 
Some means are specified in the charter but 
these are not necessarily exclusive. Within 
widest limits other means are not prohibited. 
The charter is not a code of civil procedure 
to be strictly construed. I know no better 
canon of construction to be used in deter-
mining charter power than that laid down by 
Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch V. Mary-
land, 4 Wheaton 316, 421, for determining 
constitutional power: "Let the end be legiti-
mate, let it be within the scope of the Con-
stitution, and all means which are appro-
priate which are plainly adapted to that end, 
Which are not prohibited, but consist with 
the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are 
constitutional." 
It is the right and responsibility of mem-
ber states to and means which are appro-
priate, which are not prohibited, but con-
sist with the letter and spirit of the charter, 
to carry out purposes of the charter. There 
has been a tendency, I fear, for members to 
seek excuses and alibis for not working under 
the charter rather than to make any sus-
tained efforts to find means of carrying out 
the purposes of the charter. It is quite pos-
sible that the means which may prove most 
helpful now are not necessarily the means 
which would have been most helpful in years 
past or the means which may be most help-
ful in the more distant future. 
It seems to me that we have tried to build 
the United Nations too much in the image 
of the nation state?to muster power to light 
wars rather than to develop the tolerance 
and understanding to prevent war. We have 
tried to exorcise differences by a majority 
vote rather than to seek means of composing 
and reconciling differences and containing, 
within reasonable, tolerable, and livable 
limits, those which cannot presently be com-
posed or reconciled. 
Of course until there is much greater 
progress toward general and effectively safe-
guarded disarmament it is necessary and in 
the interest of the United Nations and world 
peace that the member states maintain a 
reasonable balance of armed strength so that 
the most aggressive states will not be 
tempted to secure their interests by war 
rather than peaceful means. Of course it is 
in the interest of the United Nations and 
world peace that member states cooperate not 
only in the United Nations but in regional 
and functional organizations so that they 
will be better able to support the efforts of 
the United Nations to maintain peace in the 
world. We live in a pluralistic world and 
diverse and varied efforts--political, eco-
nomic and social within and without the 
United Nations?are needed to strengthen 
the forces of peace, freedom anal well-being 
throughout the world, provided however that 
such efforts do not countenance the waging 
of war in disregard of the United Nations 
Charter. 
In this divided world in this nuclear age 
there is no substitute for an organization 
like the United Nations which teanscends 
the interests of states and groups of states 
and seta above their divergent interests the 
common interest and the transcending vital 
Interest of all states in the maintenance of 
peace. 
Military alliances may deter war for a 
period by maintaining an uneasy balance of 
power, but military alliances are not likely 
to develop means or procedures for peaceful 
settlement or containment of vital differ-
ences among states or groups of states par-
ties to different alliances. NATO, SEATO, 
and CENTO were to function in support of 
the United Nations and its charter princi-
ples, but in fact there has been little or no 
effort to relate their work to the United 
Nations, Many supporters of NATO, the 
greatest of the postwar military alliances, 
would give it priority over the United Na-
tions. Yet NATO has not been able to se-
cure peaceful settlement in its own area; it 
reluctantly acquiesced in the United Nations 
intervention in Cyprus when all else failed. 
NATO has in no way responded to the de-
April 28, 1965 
tente with the Soviet Union with any arms 
control proposals. Indeed it has tended to 
regard with suspicion any arms control pro-
posals which would affect it. At the time of 
the 1961 Berlin crisis, NATO was used not in 
support of the U.N. and peaceful settlement 
but as an alternative to resort to the United 
Nations. When crises developed in Laos and 
South Vietnam, SEATO was invoked not in 
support of the U.N. and peaceful settlement 
but in lieu of the United Nations. 
If one believes in the therapeutic effects 
of shock treatment in international affairs, 
in the therapeutic value of periodic armed 
confrontations such as occurred in Berlin, 
Cuba, and Vietnam, one need not be con-
cerned by the fading out of the United Na-
tions and what was once called man's last 
best hope of peace on earth. But such con-
frontations in this nuclear age involve risks 
which responsible statesmen conscious of 
their responsibilities to future generations 
cannot continue to ignore. 
The United Nations was established to en-
able responsible statesmen to work together 
to avoid these risks. It was intended to pro-
vide an instrumentality through which mem-
bers could unite their power and resources, 
spiritual and material, to protect their one 
and all-important common interest in the 
maintenance of peace in this nuclear age. Of 
course the charter will fail of its purposes if 
states insist on using force or the threat of 
force when it suits their interests without 
giving the United Nations the chance to use 
its good offices to compose differences which 
threaten the peace. 
It is not the lack of power which might 
be called to the support of the United Na-
tions which stands in the way of the realiza-
tion of the promise of the United Nations. 
It is the lack of genuine effort on the part 
of the member states particularly the great 
powers, to use the as yet untapped resources 
of the United Nations to develop processes 
and procedures for the peaceful settlement of 
disputes among states. It is putting the cart 
before the horse, to put it mildly, to worry 
about how the United Nations is going to 
muster power to enforce peaceful settlement 
before it has developed processes and pro-
cedures for reaching peaceful settlement's 
which can command the respect of states 
whose vital interests and possibly very ex-
istence are at stake. Intemperate invective 
and unrestrained cold war debate hastily 
followed by the counting of votes, in many 
instances uninformed and unaffected by the 
facts or merits of the controversy, consti-
tute a rank betrayal of the purposes and 
principles of the charter. 
It is extraordinary that so little sustained 
thought and consideration has been given to 
the development of the processes of concilia-
tion and mediation as part of the pacific 
settlement functions of the United Nations. 
The sidetracking and soft-pedaling of the 
pacific settlement functions of the United 
Nations may be ascribed in large part, as 
I have indicated, to the cold war. Issues 
formally brought to the United Nations for 
peaceful settlement have been exploited for 
propaganda purposes and serious efforts to 
harmonize differences have been notice-
able by their absence. The mediation and 
conciliation functions of the United Na-
tions have been neglected and allowed to 
to atrophy. Obviously in dealing with differ-
ences among sovereign states, particularly 
at this stage of international organization 
when states are excessively jealous of their 
sovereignty, an agreed solution is to be pre-
ferred to an imposed solution. Even states 
eager for a solution are loath to agree i1. 
advance to accept arbitration or an imposed[ 
solution for fear, sometimes for groundles; 
fear, it may involve unexpected terms dif. 
Rauh or impossible to explain to their people. 
The imposition of a solution may produce 
serious divisions and strains within the 
United Nations, while an agreed solution, if

can be brought about, is an undisputed 
iievernent and builds international con-
ence in the United Nations, 
"'he process of conciliation and mediation 
courages good faith negotiations and col-
;tive bargaining among states. It tends to 
rb the instinctive habits of states when 
tional passions are aroused to try to get 
eir way by threats and counterthreats of 
rce instead of seeking a fair accommoda-
pn by a little give-and-take on both sides. 
There is Indeed at this stage of interne,-
onal organization perhaps more to learn 
'oni the traditions and practices which 
overn the peaceful settlement of labor dis-
mtes in modern industrial states than there 
s from the study of the making and en-
orcernent of law Within a state. In the 
arly days of labor unions there seemed to 
be irreconcilable differences in the ideology 
of labor and capital, and the law in many 
states did not even recognize the right of 
labor to organize. Labor did not trust the 
courts, which labor felt shared the ideas of 
management. To paraphrase the remarksof 
Mr. Litvinoy regarding the relations of capi-
talism and communism, labor thought no one 
could be neutral between management and 
labor. In the early days of union activities 
violence on one side or the other or both?
allegedly in self-defense, of course?was not 
uncommon. Gradually the right of unions 
to organize and bargain collectively was rec-
ognized by law, but both sides shied away 
from compulsory arbitration unless it was 
agreed to in ad.vance by both sides. But 
custom., if not law, imposed upon both sides 
the duty to bargain in good faith and make 
every effort to reach a peaceful agreement. 
If prolonged work stoppage threatens the 
Welfare of the community it has become 
customary for the state or conrimunity to in-
tervene, not by imposing a settlement but by 
creating an environment which should fa-
cilitate an agreed settlement. Sometimes 
the state or community will provide a cool-
ing-off period comparable to a waiting period 
of 3 months following the? report of the 
Council, which, under the convenant of the 
League, states agreed to observel3efore resort-
ing to war. Sometimes the state or com-
munity will provide a cease-strike period 
comparable to a cease-fire during which ne-
gotiations can proceed in a relaxed atmos-
phere. "Frequently the state or community 
will provide a mediator or conciliator, or a 
group of mediators or conciliators. These 
skilled professionals will bring the parties to-
gether, find the essential facts at thT?oot of 
the controversy, define and narrow issues, iso-
late and defer issues on which agreeinent is 
clearly impossible, .suggest afternatiVe Solu-
tions, and at times make definite recommen-
dations for settlement that they think both 
sides can accept and live with. 
It might be said that in the labor relations 
field an wiwritten common law has been 
developed and accepted that all disputes af-
fecting the public welfare must be settled 
peacefully; that is, without violence and 
without protracted disruption of the public 
service. No particular means of reaching a 
settlement is prescribed, but all means can-
not be rejected. idediation and conciliation 
processes will be available to assist the par-
ties reach an agreement by means of their 
own choice, and compulsory arbitration will 
be avoided as long as possible. But an agreed 
settlement or modus vivendi must be reach_ed 
or the parties will be obliged to accept an 
Imposed settlement. 
Much of what has been learned in the last 
century in the handling of labor-manage-
ment disputes can be applied in the han-
dling of disputes among states. We should 
worry lest about he power of the United - 
Nations to,,, cOMpel or coerce settlement and

concern 011reelves more with the conciliation 
and mediation procedures and processes the 
United Nations can provide to assist states

compose their differences and settle their dis-
putes. The United Nations environment 
should be most favorable to the development 
of unparalleled facilities for conciliation and 
mediation. Most member states, with little 
or no direct interest in a direct dispute un-
less prematurely forced to take sides, will 
naturally want to be helpful in facilitating 
an agreed settlement by peaceful means. 
Most disputes between states like most dis-
putes between labor and management in-
volve other legal issues and cannot be settled 
by the application of any preexisting or 
mutually acceptable rule of law. Conse-
quently they lend themselves more readily 
to negotiated settlements than to inflexible 
judicial settlements of ,political legislative 
solutions. The disputant states, like labor-
management disputants, are less likely to fear 
outside intervention to facilitate a negoti-
ated settlement than they are to fear out-
side intervention to impose or coerce a settle-
ment. 
Indeed despite the neglect of the pacific 
settlement functions of the United Nations 
and the lack of preparations to enable the 
United Nations to function effectively in this 
area, there is enough in the past activities of 
the United Nations to justify faith in the 
great potentialities of the United Nations in 
this area. There are the outstanding accom-
plishments of Count Bernadotte and Dr. 
Ralph Bunche as mediators in the Israeli-
Arab conflict in 1948; the quick and ex-
traordinary resourcefulness and imaginative 
statesmanship of Mr. Lester Pearson of Can-
ada which led to the creation over a week-
end in 1956 of a peacekeeping force not to 
fight but to keep the peace in the most sen-
sitive areas in the Near East; the patience 
of Mr. Frank Graham in containig the Kash-
mir conflict; the deft and dedicated efforts 
of Dag Hammarskjold in handling the opera-
tions of the United Nations peacekeeping 
forces in the Near East and later in the 
Congo; and similar efforts of U Thant in the 
tense Cyprus situation. 
Indeed it is interesting to contrast the 
failure of member states to earmark troops, 
by special agreements with the Security 
Council under article 43 of the charter or in 
response to the Collective Measures Commit-
tee of the General Assembly, for enforcement 
or sanction' actions with the increasing will-
ingness of member states to earmark troops 
for peacekeeping operations as an adjunct 
to pacific settlement. Canada, Denmark, 
Finland, Iran, Italy, the Netherlands, Nor-
way, and Sweden and most recently the 
United Kingdom have already volunteered to 
hold troops on a permanent basis in readi-
ness for United Nations peacekeeping opera-
tions. (Issues before the 19th General As-
sembly, International Conciliation, No. 550 
November 1964, pp. 19-24.) 
These are significant stirrings of hope. 
Yet one must regretfully observe that most 
national statesmen?while paying lipservice 
to the United Nations and tearfully lament-
ing its ineffectiveness and professing to wish 
to see it strengthened?have done precious 
little to develop and dramatize the great po-
tentialities of the United Nations under the 
present charter in the field of peacekeeping 
and pacific settlement. If, as they tell us, 
there is no alternative to peace in this nu-
clear age, they should give at least a fraction 
of the time they give to building up military 
power to building up an effective adminis-
trative corps within the United Nations to 
assist and promote the peaceful settlement 
of international disputes. Certainly na-
tional statesmen might be expected to give us 
much time to this task as they give to the 
recently revived study of geopolitics which 
seems to be based on the supposedly obso-
lete theory that there is no alternative to 
war. 
I will make only a few of many suggestions 
which should be worthy of study in this con-
nection. One, there should be get up a re-
porting or rapporteur system to assist the 
Security Council and the General Assembly 
in handling disputes between states which 
threaten the peace. Every precaution should 
be taken to relieve the Security Council and 
the Assembly from having to act on the un-
corroborated statements of the disputants 
and their partisans. There should be 
avail-
able to these organs reports?prepared by a 
professional rapporteur or group of rappor-
teus?as objective as possible of the essen-
tial facts at issue and the positions taken by 
the disputants. 
Second, as part of or in addition to such 
a corps of rapport,eurs, there should be small 
corps of professional diplomats whose ex-
perience or training qualify them to act as 
mediators or conciliators. Among other 
things, it should be their duty to investigate 
on their own initiative or on the request of 
a specified number of member states the use 
of force or the threat to use force by any 
state or states which has not been brought 
to the attention of the United Nations and 
to report the essential facts to the Secre-
tary General. The Secretary General should 
be authorized on the basis of such report to 
offer the services of the mediating and con-
ciliating corps to the disputants to assist 
them in negotiating a settlement of their 
differences. 
It is gravely disturbing that many de-
voted friends of the United Nations have 
failed to grasp that the failure of the United 
Nations is threatened as much or more by 
the neglect of the great powers than by the 
irresponsibility of the small states. Even the 
revered Dag Hammarskjold who gave his life 
for the United Nations, in appealing for the 
support of the small states against Mr. 
Khrushev's proposal to force his resignation 
and to trifurcate the office of the Secretary 
General, stated in the General Assembly in 
September 1961: "It is not the Soviet Union 
or indeed, any other big powers, who need 
the U.N. for their protection; it is all the 
others. In this sense, the Organization is 
first of all their organization, and I deeply 
believe in the wisdom with which they will 
be able to use it and guide it." It is quite 
understandable at that critical time 
Hammarskjold should have reminded the 
small states of their great stake in the United 
Nations and their duty to act responsibly. 
It was unfortunate, however, that the words 
may suggest that the great powers have a 
lesser stake in and a lesser need of the U.N. 
If great powers do not sense their imperative 
need of the United Nations to preserve the 
peace, they will not give the United Nations 
the support necessary for its growth and 
survival. If the great powers do not have 
confidence in the United Nations, they can-
not expect the smaller powers to have con-
fidence in it. 
Recurrently and persistently a school of 
realists tell us that the United States can-
not deal with conflicts between the great 
powers because of the veto and the lack of 
countervailing power. One would have 
thought that the uniting for peace resolu-
tion in 1950 would have put that argument 
to rest. Moreover, whatever criticism may 
be made of the one-sidedness of some of the 
resolutions in the Suez case, it certainly es-
tablished the continued vitality of the 
uniting for peace resolution and rejected the 
proposition that the great powers have a 
right to ignore their charter obligations. 
Strong arguments may be advanced that the 
United Nations cannot muster the power, and 
would be unwise to attempt, to impose its 
will by force on the great powers or for that 
matter on some of the lesser powers. The 
primary purpose of the United Nations after 
all is to keep the Peace and prevent war, not 
to fight wars, to stop aggression not to pun-

ish the aggressor. But there is nothing in 
the charter or outside the charter that would 
justify the great powers any more than the 
small powers to reject and ignore the con-
ciliation, mediation, and other peace-keeping 
processes and procedures that the United 
Nations might provide for the peaceful settle-
ment of disputes which threaten the peace. 
If the United Nations withers away, it will 
not be because it lacks the power to impose 
its will by force but because the forces for 
peace represented in the United Nations do 
not unite their strength as the charter bids 
them to do to bring the powers, great or 
small, which are involved in the conflict, to 
the conference table for good faith negoti-
ation. I have scant sympathy with those 
Who are so devoted to the United Nations 
that they would not saddle it with the bur-
densome task of bringing clashing powers to 
the conference table for fear the conference 
will be abortive. To what a pass the United 
Nations has come when it scarcely takes no-
tice of a war in Vietnam which threatens to 
escalate into a major world conflict. 
It is not suggested that disputes affecting 
the vital interests and very existence of states 
may peacefully be settled by cold war debate 
and the counting of partisan votes. On this 
greatly diversified and deeply divided world, 
a consensus Is not easily found. But even 
amid diversity and division the common in-
terest in peace?in the continuation of life 
itself on this planet?should be strong and 
effective enough to provide the procedures 
and processes to bring states in conflict to 
the conference table and to assist them to 
reach agreed settlements with which they 
can live. 
This does not mean that all debate in the 
General Assembly and Security Council can 
or should be suppressed. As in all political 
bodies the delegates often speak as much to 
their own constituents as to their fellow 
delegates. To some extent this is unavoid-
able and with limits desirable. It does en-
able the delegates to inform and advise one 
another of the grievances, problems, and pre-
dilections of their various constituencies. 
But the cold war has unfortunately invaded 
the United Nations and taken over to the 
point that in some instances it has strength-
ened and accentuated divisions and actually 
militated against the development of a feel-
ing of community, of shared Interests in 
meeting the problems and adjusting the dif-
ferences which threaten not only peace but 
life on this planet. 
If the political organs of the United Na-
tions are to play their part in building peace 
which will save the world from a nuclear 
holocaust, there must be when there is no 
clear consensus, a downgrading of voting 
and an upgrading of efforts to create and 
employ the processes of mediation and con-
ciliation to obtain the accommodations, com-
promises, and provisional arrangements 
which are necessary if we are to live at peace. 
But there are those who say let justice and 
right prevail though the heavens fall. But 
who is to determine what is just and what 
Is right. Does justice lie with the strongest 
battalions or the deadliest missiles? And 
what justice can there be if the heavens 
fall. / should think it might better be said: 
Let justice be done so that the heavens will 
not fall. 
Antagonistic ideologies not reconcilable by 
logic have in the past been reconciled by the 
felt necessities of the times, even when they 
contended not only for the things of this 
earth but for man's immortal soul. The test 
of life, the test of peaceful coexistence?like 
the test of law as Justice Holmes has re-
minded us?is not logic but experience. 
Slowly and surely the most hardheaded 
statesman barring lapses in periods of ten-
sion and passion are coming to realize that 
war no longer is a practical way of adjusting 
international disputes. 
What are some of the working rules which 
should be observed in the United Nations in 
order to make the most effective use of the 
processes of conciliation in the settlement of 
international disputes which threaten the 
peace? They conform very closely with 
those which have proved effective in the con-
ciliation and mediation of labor disputes. 
Impartial rapporteurs and skilled mediators 
should objectively try to ascertain the essen-
tial facts and to determine the extent to 
which they may be in dispute; to ascertain 
and define the essential issues which divide 
the disputants so as to reduce, narrow and 
contain them to the greatest possible extent. 
They should also suggest alternative solu-
tions to compose those differences which 
seem reconcilable with a little give and take, 
and should suggest provisional and ad hoc 
arrangements to circumvent or contain with-
in tolerable and livable limits vital issues on 
which the parties are presently irreconcilably 
divided. This generation must be wise 
enough to find ways of leaving to the solvent 
of time and the wisdom of succeeding gen-
erations problems which this generation is 
unable to solve. If this generation does not 
find and accept such ways there may be no 
tomorrow. Let us not forget that the most 
aggressive ideologies undergo changes over 
the years. Even the most fanatical faiths 
balk at self-destruction and mellow with 
time. When men realize as Justice Holmes 
so eloquently stated that "time has upset 
many fighting faiths" (Abrams v. U.S., 250 
U.S. 616, 630) and when men realize that 
time has brought many unexpected changes 
even in our lifetime, we should have faith 
that the next generation may be able to solve - 
the problems we are unable to solve. At 
least we should do our best to give the next 
generation a chance. 
? 
Let us now take a look at the none too 
successful efforts at mediation and concilia-
tion in the recent ill-fated 19th General As-
sembly centering about the application of 
article 19 of the charter to the Soviet Union. 
Article 19 provides that a member 2 years in 
arrears shall have no vote in the General 
Assembly, although the General Assembly 
may permit it to vote if it Is satisfied that 
failure to pay is due to conditions beyond its 
control. It was contended by the United 
States, the United Kingdom and Canada 
that the Soviet Union was more than 2 
years in arrears because of its failure to meet 
the General Assembly's assessments against 
it for the UNEF (United Nations Emergency 
Force) peacekeeping in the Middle resit and 
for ONUC (United Nation's Operations in the 
Congo) peacekeeping. The International 
Court of Justice in an advisory opinion on 
which its members were sharply divided, 
nine to five, had found the assessments for 
UNEF and ONUC valid and binding under 
the charter. The General Assembly after 
acrimonious debate in its 18th session had 
voted to accept the opinion. The Soviet 
Union and Prance have taken the position 
that only the Security Council under the 
charter can impose binding obligations, al-
though France supported the uniting for 
peace resolution an 1950 and met her contri-
butions to UNEF voluntarily. The Soviet 
Union had initially supported the peace-
keeping operation for the Congo in the Se-
curity Council, although it withdrew its sup-
port after Lumumba's ouster. 
It is the contention of the Soviet Union 
that it is not in arrears, and that neither the 
Court's advisory opinion or the resolution of 
the General Assembly can impose an obliga-
tion to pay for peacekeeping not authorized 
by the Security Council. France which dur-
ing 1965 will similarly become in arrears be-
cause of her nonpayment of the Congo as-
sessments supports the Soviet contention. 
It should be observed that both UNEF and 
ONUC were financed partly by a modified 
scale of assessments and partly by volunta 
contributions. All subsequent peace-kee 
ing operations have been financed by voila 
tary contribution. 
The United States, the United Kingdo: 
and Canada have taken the position that t 
General Assembly has accepted the Cour 
opinion, that the President of the Assemb 
must automatically apply article 19 and del 
the Soviet Union the right to vote. Th, 
further contend that on a point of order h 
ruling should and would be sustained by 
simple majority vote. Other members tal 
the position that article 19 must be read 1. 
connection with article 18 which providc 
that the suspension of rights and privilege 
should be considered important question 
requiring a two-thirds vote. 
The President of the Assembly and tla 
Secretary General tried from November tc 
February to mediate the dispute. They suc-
ceeded in quieting. considerably the usual 
cold war debate and in avoiding a tabulated 
vote save on the final motion to adjourn in 
order to prevent a direct confrontation not of 
arms but of wills between the Soviet Union 
and the United States which might lead to 
the breakup of the United Nations. 
Conciliation efforts have not succeeded but 
they have not finally failed. It seems a pity 
that in a period of detente between the 
United States and the Soviet Union, it was 
not possible to find practical means and 
measures of meeting the United Nation's 
deficit so that the Assembly could get on 
With its work without being bogged down in 
legalisms. With a little give and take a prac-
tical settlement might have been reached 
without resolving the controversial legal is-
sues which have been unduly and unneces-
sarily exploited. Neither the Court's ad-
visory opinion nor article 19 need stand in 
the way of a practical settlement. To reach 
a practical settlement it is not necessary to 
accept or reject the Court's opinion. 
It is important to recall just what the 
Court did and did not advise: Not that the 
General Assembly may not finance peace-
keeping by voluntary contributions, indeed 
both UNEF and ONITC are partially financed 
by voluntary contributions; Not that the 
General Assembly may not authorize States 
particularly interested to assume the pre-
ponderant burden as was the case in Korea 
and later in Cyprus and Yeman. The Court 
merely advised that the General Assembly 
had the charter power, and had exercised it 
In the case of UNEF and ONUQ, to impose 
obligatory assessments to defray the costs of 
peacekeeping. 
But the Court did not decide that at this 
stage of international organization in the 
world where states are still inordinately 
jealous of their sovereignty that it was- wise 
statesmanship to finance peacekeeping on 
the basis of obligatory assessments. politi-
cal body whose powers are essentially recom-
nriendatory should hesitate, particularly in 
the absence of Great Power unity and an 
overwhelming consensus, to require sovereign 
states to finance actions which they oppose 
and which they cannot be required to par-
ticipate in or assist directly. It is frequently 
asserted that the peacekeeping functions of 
the United Nations will not be undertaken 
if there is no power of obligatory assessment. 
I doubt this. Peacekeeping will not and 
should not be authorized unless the States 
supporting such action are-willing to support 
or to find support for it. Obviously much 
of the social and economic work of United 
Nations and its specialized agencies could not 
and would not be carried out on other than 
an essentially voluntary basis. 
It is no accident that both the United 
States and United Kingdom last summei 
(1964) proposed to the Working Group ol 
the Assembly, which was studying meth-
ods for financing peacekeeping operations 
involving heavy expenditures, a special pro-

maybe expected to give good faith considera-
tion to the Assembly's recommendation, but 
they are not bound to act against their own 
better judgment nor to ignore the fact that a 
numerical majority may in some instances 
not 'he trillY representative of informed 
world opinion. 
When the cold war was at its height there 
was excessive en-if:thesis on voting and a mis-
guided attempt to exaggerate the significance 
of a mere numerical Majority. At this stage 
of international organization a vote whieh 
requires action can become effective only if 
it moves to action states which have the will 
and power to act. A vote will command 
respect not by the mere number of states 
back of it but by the worldwide feelings or 
sentiments it reflects, by the worldwide 
response or reaction to events it evokes, and 
by the influence it brings to bear on the ac-
tions of the states to which it is addressed. 
Many closely divided votes may only serve to 
strengthen divisions rather than to develop 
a consensus. ? 
Small states cannot expect to dictate to 
the more powerful states what they must do. 
On the other hand small states also have 
their rights, and large states cannot claim 
the right to act in areas in which small 
states are concerned without explaining and 
justifying their action. As President Roose-
velt stated in his last state of the Union 
message on January 6, 1945, when the charter 
of the United Nations was being drafted: 
"We cannot deny that power is a factor in 
world politics any more than .we can deny 
that power is a factor in national politics. 
But in a democratic world, as in a democratic 
nation, power must be linked with respon-
sibility and obliged to defend and justify 
itself within the framework of the general 
good." And the power of which President 
Roosevelt was speaking was power which was 
something more than transient military 
force. 
For the United Nations to function effec-
tively with its present membership at this 
stage of international organization, greater 
reliance must be placed on procedures for 
peaceful settlement through conciliatory 
processes. Less reliance should be placed on 
voting on volatile political issues which in 
the absence of a clear consensus cannot be 
resolved by a vote. 
In emphasizing the flexibility of the charter 
and its adaptability to "exigencies"?to 
paraphrase the remarks of Justice Holmes in 
reference to the American Constitution, 
"which could not have been completely fore-
seen by the most gifted of its begetters"?I 
do not wish to rule out all charter amend-
ments. I only warn that we must exploit the 
potentialities of the present charter in order 
to develop a broader and deeper feeling of 
worldwide community which must precede 
any meaningful charter change. As we 
broaden the areas of concensus, we increase 
the possibility of strengthening the charter 
by amendment. 
Amendments to the charter enlarging the 
Security Council and the Economic and So-
cial Council have been proposed by the 18th 
General Assembly. (Resolutions 1991 A and 
B (xviii) Dec. 17, 1963.) The Security Council 
amendment would enlarge the Security Coun-
cil to 15 members. Of the 10 nonpermanent 
members, 5 would come from Africa and Asia, 
1 from Eastern Europe, 2 from Latin America, 
and 2 from Western Europe and elsewhere. 
The Economic and Social Council amendment 
would enlarge ECOSOC to 27 members, of 
which 9 would be elected each year for 3-year 
terms. Seven of nine elected each year would 
come from Africa and Asia, one from Latin 
America, and one from Western Europe. 
A larger' Security 'Council and ECOSOC 
would appear desirable in order to reflect a 
broader spectrum of world opinion. But it 
would seem to the that if the Security Council 
is to be enlarged there Should be provision to 
edure for :handling such financing in the

her proposed that: Such recommendation be 
nade only on a two-thirds vote of the cam-
nittee membership. (U.N. Doc. A/AC 1137 
50, Sept. 14, 1964.) :These proposals, I am 
sure, ere designed not simply to offer some 
protection in the future to the Soviet Un-
ion but to other lane contributors includ-
ing the United States and the United Xing-
done against being assessed for operations 
which they oppose and in which they can-
not be forced to participate directly. At 
this stage of international organization, it 
Is neither wise statesmanship nor practical 
politics to expeet states' to be able to get 
substantial appropriations from their na-
tional legislatures to finance* international 
operations to 'which they are opposed. At 
this stage of international organization states 
must learn to cooperate voluntarily before 
they seek to enforce cooperation from recal-
citrant states. 
The long period of watchful waiting .dur-
ing which the 19th Assembly did' nothing, 
Clearly indicates that 'the member states do 
not Want the future of the organization to 
depend' upon whether the application of 
article 19 to the SOViet 'Union Under the

litical champion of its expanding, role in 
world affairs, Qta, the other hand they rec-
ognize that the United Nations cannot be 
a worldwid,e organization for peace if the 
Soviet Union is to be deprived of its vote. 
The inenibers do not want the United Na-
tions to be stalled in its tracks.,They want 
to find a way to get on wit its work. 
Had a way not been found to adjourn 
the Assembly until next September (1965), 
the President of the Assembly would un-
doubtedly have refrained from ruling on 
his own responsibility on the automatic ap-
plication of article 19. He would undoubt-
edly have asked the advice of the member 
states. They also would have sought a way 
to avoid Making a decision on application 
of article 19. If need be a majority might 
have voted to make this an important ques-
tion requiring a two-thirds vote under arti-
cle 18(3). In that case it would have been 
unlikely that any decision could command 
a two-thirds vote and efforts to find an 0A-
commodatien or compromise would have had 
to be resumed. 
A new Committee of 3$ has: been estab-
lished by the Assembly and is Instructed 
in consultation with the President and Sec-
, ,

of overcoming the present financial difflcul-

well recommend that, in light of the prac-
deal difliculties encountered which have 
taralyzed the work of the 19th session, the 
- - 
Assembly should reconsider the nature of the 
assessments levied for ITNEF and ONUC. It 
might suggest that without prejudice to 
its charter powers and without prejudice to 
the advisory opinion of the Court, the Assem-
bly should declare the assessments to be 
? recommendatory and nonmandatory while 
urging all states to meet their share of such 
?assessments. The states which voted for 
these aSsessments should naturally feel 
morally bound to meet their share. Should 
some states fail to meet their quota, for 
reasons which to them seem compelling: they 
should be urged to contribute a substan-
tially equivalent amount to other operations 
of the United Nations so that the overall 
`costs of the United Nations may be equitably 
shared by its members. Should there re-
main a deficit in meeting the costs of UNEF 
and ?NIX, a special appeal should be made 
for voluntary contributions to make up the 
deficit. 
If the Assembly is prepared to recognize 
the unwisdom at this stage of international 
organization of attempting to make its 
assessinents for special peacekeeping op-
"erations obligatory, there should be reason 
to hope that the Soviet Union and Prance 
'would voluntarily meet their assessments 
' or make substantially equivalent contribu-
tions to other essential activities of the 
United Nations. In the absence of special 
circumstances, States 'which do not con-
tribute to special peacekeeping operations 
'Should not be entitled to a voice in the 
administration of such operations. Of 
course it may be a bit messy to reconsider 
the mandatory character of a partially ex-
ecuted plan of assessments. But it is better 
to offend the purists than to let the Assem-
bly be stalemated or blackout indefinitely. 
It is to be regretted, as I have indicated, 
that in a period of relative detente between 
the West and the Soviet Union a negotiated 
settlement has been so difficult to achieve. 
It is particularly regrettable that the work of 
the Assembly should have been stalled over 
the financing of peacekeeping operations 
because it has been in the field of peace-
keeping as an aid to peaceful settlement 
that the most promising developments in the 
United Nations in recent years have occurred. 
It was somewhat reassuring to note that the 
cold war debate was less acrimonious than 
usual and that the membership as a whole 
calmly exerted their influence to mediate 
the differences between the United States 
and the Soviet Union and to prevent a self-
defeating confrontation over article 19. De-
spite the unsuccessful attempt of Albania 
to precipitate the confrontation, the many 
new, small and weak members acted with 
a sense of responsibility and restraint. 
* * 
The admission of many new small states 
has created problems which cannot be ig-
nored. But the seriousness of these prob-
lems can be greatly minimized if the larger 
states take the lead in developing practices 
and procedures which encourage and promote 
the use of the Assembly not as a forum for 
fighting cold wars, but for ending them. 
With the admission of many new and 
relatively weak states it becomes the-
oretically possible for the General Assembly 
to vote for action for the carrying out of 
which the voting majority would shoulder 
little or no responsibility or burden. It must 
be remembered, however, that the action of 
the General Assembly is recommendatory 
and not mandatory. Its effectiveness must 
depend upon its appeal to the judgment and 
interests of states. Indeed, democratic 
states cannot be expected to assist actively

insuze that not less than one-third of its 
membership are drawn from a middle group 
of states which, while not among the original 
permanent members of the Council, are large 
financial contributors. This middle group 
might constitute a class of additional perma-
nent members without power Of veto or at 
least an additional class of members eligible 
for successive reelection. This middle group 
should include states like India, japan, Brazil, 
Italy, Germany, and, possibly, 'Nigeria. 
Moreover if the Security Council is to be 
enlarged in order to obtain a more balanced 
representation it would seem to be desirable 
If not necessary at the same time to provide 
for a better balanced distribution of voting 
power in the General Assembly. In light 
of the great disparity of power between the 
relatively small number of large States and 
the large number of small States some 
change in the distribution of voting power 
in the Assembly is important to maintain 
the influence of the General Assembly and to 
give meaning and power to its resolutions. 
It is likewist important to maintain the 
capacity of the Assembly to act. responsibly?
to represent power as well as numbers?when 
the veto forestalls action in the Security 
Council. But it is not easy to find any ac-
ceptable principle of weighted voting to im-
pose oh the principle of sovereign equality 
of States. A duel voting system perhaps af-
fords the best way of reconciling the sov-
ereign equality of states with a responsibly 
balanced pewee structure. It might con-
ceivably be possible if and when the Great 
Powers consent to an enlarged and better 
balanced Security Council that the smaller 
powers would concurrently consent to a dual 
voting system in the General Assembly 
whereby ordinary resolutions in the Gen-
eral Assembly wciuld require a double major-
ity vote?a majority of all members and a 
majority of those states in the Assembly 
which are represented on the enlarged Secu-
rity Council. Then important resolutions of 
the Aiserably would require a two-thirds ma-
jority of the whole membership and a two-
thirds majority of those states in the Assem-
bly which are members of the Security Coun-
cil. This is a form of weighted voting which 
avoids the need for weighing the votes of 
individual states. It should create a better 
relationship between the Security Council 
and the Assembly and at the same time in-
crease the effective influence of the Assembly 
on the Security Council. 
But desirable as some amendments may 
be, we must not let the obstacles in the way 
of attaining them blind us to the potentiali-
ties of the present charter which is and was 
*signed to be adaptable to changing condi-
tions and unforeseen exigencies. The means 
which may be most effective for carrying out 
the charter purposes when the Great Pow-
ers are working together may not be the most 
effective means when they are in conflict. 
The most effective means of carrying out the 
charter objectives at one stage in the growth 
of international organization may not be 
the most effective means at a different and 
more advanced stage. The charter is broad 
in scope and allows a wide measure of choice 
of means. It IS for each generation to have 
the wisdom and imagination to choose the 
appropriate means and procedures for keep-
ing the peace-in its time. 
At the present time the important thing 
is to find the means which enable the mem-
ber states to cooperate to the maximum ex-
tent to keep the peace within the frame and 
law of the charter. The important thing is 
not to impose the will of a majority of states 
OE a minority of states but to provide an en-
vironment and a procedure for composing or 
containing differences among states before 
they erupt into war. The peaceful settlement 
of disputes requires not armies but -Wisdom 
and vision. Long ago in the days of Solomon 
it was said that "Where there is no vision 
the people perish." Let us hope that in this 
nuclear age vision is not lacking when with-
out vision life on this planet may cease to 
exist. 
MIGRATORY FARM LABOR?THE 
BRACER? PROBLEM 
Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, in re-
cent months, the Senate has been en-
gaging in serious colloquy concerning the 
bracer? problem of importing labor to 
harvest the crops. 
A great many farmers, as the President 
knows, are presently in serious straits, 
wondering whether to plant their crops 
because of the absence of available labor. 
The other day, out of the blue, I re-
ceived a letter from a gentleman in New 
York who owns property in my State of 
Colorado, and in that letter he included 
a copy of his letter to the Secretary of 
Labor, Mr. Wirtz. 
The letter details the problems which 
farmers face in Colorado as well as in 
other parts of the country, and he in-
cludes some exhibits from his own tenant 
farmers in that area. I ask unanimous 
consent to have this material printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
NEW Ycenc, N.Y., 
April 5, 1965. 
Senator PETER H. Donanvicx, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR Ma. SENATOR: I am taking the liberty 
to forward to you a copy of a letter which I 
believe is self-explanatory in reference to the 
sugarbeet labor situation. 
The situation is critical, and anything 
which you could do to help correct it in these 
next few days before planting time for the 
1965 crop would be a godsend. 
Sincerely yours, 
HARRISON D. 13r..sis. 
NEW Yoloc, N.Y., 
April 5, 1965. 
Hon. W. WILLARD WIRTZ, 
Secretary of Labor, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR Ma. SECRETARY: I doubt that you will 
remember me from the New York Beta of 
the Year Dinner at the Harvard Club May 16, 
1963, but as a New York City banker of 40 
years' experience and a third generation land-
owner from the Plains of Colorado where I 
grew up knowing well and intimately the 
vicissitudes of struggle with nature, I want 
to impose on your time for a few minutes to 
urgently discuss a matter of economic sur-
vival for some of our most valuable citizens?
the sugarbeet farmers. 
The lapse of Public Law 78, and sudden 
prohibition of the hiring of Mexicans, who 
have worked our beets for some two genera-
tions, presents a crisis, not just a problem, 
and a very serious crisis. The use of "bra-
ceros" must be reinstated at once. 
Farming at best is a great risk, and the 
beet farmers have been working valiantly 
under the guidance of the sugar companies 
to mechanize and dispense with hand labor. 
Much progress has been registered with the 
innovation of segmented seed and introduc-
tion of chemical weed eradicators, but nature 
cannot be changed over night as can be re-
strictive legislation. The substitute labor 
suggested Is just not available for those 
farmers from a hundred to several hundred 
miles from congested cities with large relief 
populations. It Is doubtful that those on 
relief would be efficient and effective on 
farms, or would care to "go rural" for a ' 
month period. Furthermore, the capital co 
of supplying required housing facilities f 
the short-term city relief workers and th* 
families would be prohibitive and uneo. 
nomical. 
The goal of complete mechanization Cf 
quite likely be achieved?but it will tel 
some time. When that time comes, the la 
efficient labor that you are now trying to foi, 
on the beet farmers will still be unen 
ployed?and you will have only postpone 
the solution while ruining the solid citize 
farmer. 
Our domestic beet-sugar industry prove. 
a godsend to the consuming public in Worl. 
War II, but can it endure economically wit] 
a legislated 50-percent increase in labcy 
costs plus the increased capital cost of meth. 
anization? Forty or fifty years ago a farmei 
could get along with four or five teams that 
were worth about $100 per animal and ma-
chinery that cost $75 to $100 per item. Nov. 
tractors, harvesters, etc., cost $3,000 to $6,000 
each, and the average tenant farmer can 
easily have a capital investment of $20,000 
or so. 
Our cost of sugar production should be as 
low as economically possible, as our prices 
are influenced or set by world supply. Does 
it make sense to legislate a 50-percent in-
crease in labor cost when large producing 
areas around the world produce with labor 
costs only a fraction of ours? Also, is it 
good international relations to kick our 
neighbors south of the border in the teeth? 
On my irrigated farmland of some 1,100 
acres, I have six tenant farmers; they repre-
sent the kind of families that are the back-
bone of our American free-enterprise system. 
One is a grandson of a former tenant of my 
father, two are sons, and a fourth is married 
to the daughter of a former tenant. The 
boys and girls that have come from those 
farms for three generations are real Ameri-
cans, and one son of a man who worked for 
my grandfather and father went to Wash-
ington to head up a section. Are we going 
to legislate those kind of people to second-
grade society and relief? 
That is what we *111 do if we solve this 
problem on the present approach of politics, 
and continue to ignore the rules and laws of 
economics. 
It is wrong to throw a 50-percent labor 
cost increase at the farmer when he is fac-
ing a water shortage for the second year in 
a row. The Prewitt Reservoir in Logan 
County, Colo., is still empty, and our North 
Sterling Reservoir, dating from the early 
1900's, has prospects of being only 50 percent 
full with the irrigation season now less than 
2 months away. 
At best, farming is precarious, and my 
tenant farmers work long hours for a modest 
return, if. Nature is kind. As a landlord, my 
six farmers, in the 9 years since I inher-
ited them, have produced a gross income 
(including insurance, rebates for fire, wind, 
and hail damage, and some $15,800 soil prac-
tices payments) of $259,615.02, but after 
total expenses of $251,727.14 (which includes 
only modest depreciation as some buildings 
are 50 years old or more) my net income has 
been only $7,887.88. This is an average of 
6876.43 per farm over a 9-year period, 
or an average of only $97.38 per tenant per 
year. Not very exciting, considering the 
constantly increasing cost of repairs, insur-
ance, and taxes?and my land is among some 
of the better land in the area. Some of my 
financial friends urge me to liquidate my 
landholdings and employ the funds in 
stocks and bonds to better advantage, but 
I like to think that, in that expenditure of 
$251,000, plus a greater one of my combined 
tenants, we have helped make honest jobs 
But if this keeps up, maybe in 2 year 
when I retire from the bank I'll be forcer 
to accede to their wishes.

I think that also I have among the better 
tenants in the area. Sometimes it is diffi-
cult to keep them from becoming discour-
aged. With the outlook which your De-
ment is harnessing our beet farmers, they 
may not obtain their usual credit facilities 
from the local banks. The goal of your De-
partment and the Department of Agriculture 
should be to reduce the need for farm sup-
port?not legislate so that there will be a 
necessity for more. I enclose three photo-
stats of extracts from some of my tenants' 
correspondence these past couple of months 
to let you know eloquently how they feel and 
vorry. 
Cast for both the tenant farmer and the 
Indlord are co/Latently rising (my farm real 
,.'state taxes last year advanced from 11.2 to 
14.7 percent, and it is imperative that we 
grow the maximum dollar yield per acre 
:Tops (beets) so far as sound rotation pro-
grams permit in order to break even and stay 
Alt of the red. That is true in addition to 
having good growing weather and conditions. 
I have urged my tenants to cooperate fully 
in soil conservation practices but on prin-
ciple have constantly insisted that they not 
engage in those practices whereby they 
might be paid for not growing crops which I 
feel is boondoggling. 
The planting season is here, and I hope 
that your department and all other depart-
ments involved and bureaus in Washington 
will reconsider and immediately advise the 
growers that after careful study they will 
have recourse to their tried and proven labor 
sources. 
While I am leaving this Wednesday for a 
much needed week of vacation in Florida, 
after finishing on March 23 a grand jury term 
that started February 1 (which was in addi-
tion to my full-time bank job), I should be 
happy to come to Washington for conference 
it you feel that I could further clarify the 
picture. I shall be a guest of Mrs. Nohowel, 
222 El Brill? Way, Palm Beach, telephone

make that sacrifice for my farmer boys. 
I am taking the liberty to send a copy of 
this letter to my Congressmen and Senators, 
and also to frank A. Kemp, president of the 
Great Western Sugar Co, a brother Beta 
from. the University of Colorado and a very 
able executive of the highest integrity. 
Sincerely yours, 
? HARRISON D. BLAIR. 
JANUARY 6, 1965. 
Mr. BLAIR: Enclosed is a clipping from a 
local paper concerning the wage scale for the 
beet labor. In the past it was 90 cents per 
hour. And I understand in the future they 
are going to raise it 15 percent each year till 
it gets to a level where local labor will be 
glad to come to work for us. The only thing 
is us small farmers won't be around to pay 
this kind of labor bill. About the only other 
thing we can do is just let the weeds grow. 
Any suggestions? 
The reservoir is taking in a little water, but 
they said that if some miracle didn't happen 
we'd be lucky to get 50 percent of water. Be-
tween the wafer shortage and labor shortage 
the future looks a little bleak. 
JANUARY 23, 1965. 
DEAR MR. BLAIR: Sounds like you are hav-
ing a lot of snow in New York. We had 5 
inches of snow, which was most welcome. 
This is the first moisture we have had all 
Winter. We need 10 times as much yet. 
The reservoirs are still low. Prewitt is com-
pletely dry yet. 
As for the crop planning for 1965, looking 
the situation over with the severe water 
shortage we had last year and not to much 
moisture ap yet, and also, with this beet 
labor problem it encounters some very ser-
ious thinking and a lot of figuring. 
I applied for 53 acres of beets, which I 
doubt I will get, It will probably be between 
40 to 47 acres. This will most certainly be 
enough the way the outlook is on sugarbeets. 
We already lost one beet payment in August 
of 1964 for the 1963 crop. According to the 
newspaper of Great Western we might lose 
one or two payments in 1965 for the 1964 
sugarbeet crop. Also, the water shortage. 
As for beet labor, the Government is setting 
the price. We will have to pay by the hour 
instead of by the acre. We have to pay $1.30 
an hour and hire domestic labor, which 
mainly will be people who are on welfare. 
I don't think I have to explain on how suc-
cessful this will be. My opinion is It will be 
one of the biggest labor flops in American 
history. They are too lazy to work nowadays. 
Also, the Government is trying to push 
through better living quarters for the labor. 
They are talking about running water, bath-
rooms, and also furnish some of the house-
hold furnishings. The Government will 
send inspectors around to look at labor 
houses to see if they are suitable. It's one 
big mess. Pretty soon the Government is 
going to tell us what and when on every-
thing we do. 
MARCH 24, 1965. 
MR. BLAIR: It's getting nearer to planting 
time and we are still in bad shape as far 
as water and beet labor is concerned. 
At last report they figured the reservoir 
would end up with about 50 percent water, 
unless some miracle happens which is pretty 
doubtful. It's going to be pretty hard to 
make ends meet with that poor of a water 
supply. The farm loan people don't think 
too much of loaning money to farmers with 
half a supply of water. 
They still haven't come up with anything 
for our beet labor, and the company has 
told us not to figure on any either._ You 
said to go ahead and plant and see what 
happens. 
It might be a little late to replant if 
we wait to see if they are going to be too 
weedy to save. I'm not financially fixed to 
take too many chances. You know that 
bankers don't loan too much money on 
hopes. 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON 
REAPPORTIONMENT ' 
Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, I 
have had the privilege of testifying be-
fore the Subcommittee on Constitutional 
Amendments of the Committee on the 
Judiciary in support of the proposed con-
stitutional amendment of the Senator 
from Illinois [Mr. DIRKSEN] with respect 
to reapportionment. 
The other day, I had an opportunity 
to read an excellent article on this prob-
lem written by Holman Harvey and Ken-
neth 0. Gilmore, and published in synop-
sis form in the Reader's Digest for March 
1965. 
I believe that this article clearly sets 
forth one of the problems this country 
has faced before; namely, that some 
States have not gone ahead with reap-
portionment on their own. 
It also clearly shows the great efforts 
which have been made by the State of 
Colorado in this particular complex sit-
uation and the difficulties Colorado has 
encountered because of the Supreme 
Court decision. 
The article gives many of the basic 
reasons why I feel?as I know many 
others feel?that the passage of this con-
stitutional amendment is imperative and 
should be accomplished as soon as pos-
sible. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have the article to which I have 
referred printed in the RECORD for read-
ing by all Senators. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the Reader's Digest, March 19651 
REAPPORTIONMENT: SHALL THE COURT OR THE 
PEOPLE DECIDE? 
(NOTE.?It is more than a power struggle 
between city dwellers and country dwellers. 
At issue in today's political battles over the 
makeup of State legislatures are flanda-
mental principles of democratic representa-
tion.) 
(By Holman Harvey and Kenneth 0. 
Gilmore) 
Lightning struck last June 15 when the 
Supreme Court handed down its one-man, 
one-vote reapportionment decision. This 
decree requirec both branches of every State 
legislature to be strictly based on population 
only. It represents the most far-reaching 
Change in American political structure since 
our Constitution was written 178 years ago. 
Few issues in recent times have stirred 
more controversy or created more confusion. 
Nearly every State in the Nation?from Mon-
tana to Maryland, from Alaska to Florida?
is truggling to satisfy the Federal judiciary's 
order. A dozen States have already re-
mapped their legislative districts. Others 
are desperately trying to meet Court-imposed 
deadlines or to devise delaying tactics. In 
the meantime, proposals for a constitutional 
amendment reversing the Court's action are 
being seriously debated in Congress and in 
the States. 
Make no mistake, we are at a crossroads: 
our form of government is in a major crisis. 
What then are the stakes? 
REPRESENT THE PEOPLE 
"The basic issue," says Robert G. Dixon, 
Jr., professor of law at George Washington 
University, "is not simply 'one man one 
vote.' It is fair representation, a concept 
which philosophers and politicians have been 
arguing about for ages." 
Since the beginning of democracy in the 
Greek city-states, man has groped for the 
best ways to govern himself and to achieve 
a true representation of the people's will. 
As far back as the 11th century England be-
gan to move painfully toward more repre-
sentative government; kings formed various 
councils consisting of lords, clerics, and pow-
erful landowners. Later, townships, bor-
oughs and counties were called into coun-
cils?originally to be consulted on property 
taxes. 
In America at the Constitutional Conven-
tion in Philadelphia in 1787, this was the es-
sential question: How could a balanced, gen-
uinely representative form of government be 
achieved, one that would reflect the majority 
will while protecting the minority and pre-
venting mob rule? A solution was ham-
mered out by our forefathers. So that the 
large States could not be controlled by the 
small or the small steamrollered by the large, 
a two-house plan was born, with a House of 
Representatives based on population and a 
Senate based on geography. 
Thomas Jefferson is reputed to have asked 
George Washington why he favored the sys-
tem. Washington asked Jefferson why he 
poured his coffee from cup to saucer. "To 
cool it" was the response. 
"Even so," Washington said, "we pour leg-
islation into the senatorial saucer to cool it." 
As America matured into the world's first 
successful example of modern constitutional 
democracy, States adopted the Federal two-
house system. By 1961, all but 11 States had 
constitutions that took into account inter-
ests other than population?geographic fac-
tors, mainly?so as to achieve fair represen-
tation. Missouri's "Little Federal" system

8480 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE April 28, 1965 
furnishes an example. One house is appor-
tioned on the basis of districts of fairly 
equal population in both city and lanai 
areas, with districts adjusted every 10 years. 
In the other chamber each of the 114 coun-
ties has at least 1 member. Under these 
provisions, cooperation between city and 
rural areas is a valued tradition. 
THE CHICKEN VOTE 
But?and this is where the rub came?as 
America's cities grew, some States neglected 
to reapportion their lower houses. The re-
sult was, in many States, unjust rural dom-
ination of legislatures. Delaware's house 
districts had not changed since 1897. So 
unbalanced was Connecticut's House of Rep-
resentatives that 1 vote in a rural town was 
worth 429 votes in Hartford. In New Hamp-
shire's lower house, one district had 1,000 
times more residents than another. 
One remiss State was Tennessee, with no 
revisions since 1901. A group went to court 
to force reapportionment of the assembly, 
with Memphis resident Charles W. Baker 
suing the secretary of state, Joe C. Carr. 
"The pigs and chickens in our smaller coun-
ties have better representation in the Ten-
nessee Legislature than the people of Nash-
ville, declared that city's mayor. 
The case reached the Supreme COurt. 
Contrary to all previous decisions?and to 
Justice Felix Frankfurter's warning that the 
judiciary "ought not to enter this political 
thicket"?the Court ruled in 1962 that State 
legislative districts are subject to its judicial 
scrutiny. 
The Baker v. Carr decision was a bomb-
shell. It spawned similar reapportionment 
suits in 34 States. So varied were the court 
interpretations that cases from six States--
Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, 
New York, and Virginia?were appealed to 
the High Tribunal. 
Then on June 15, 1964, the nine black-
robed men filed into the marbled chambers 
and handed down their shattering decision. 
In four eases the voting was 8 to 1; in the 
other two, 6 to 3. In all cases, the long-
established "Little Federal" system was 
knocked out. Chief Justice Earl Warren 
justified the decision on the provision of the 
14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution 
which requires that no State shall "deny to 
any person Within its jurisdiction the equal 
protection of the laws." He wrote: "Legis-
lators represent people, not trees or acres. 
Legislators are elected by voters, not farms 
or cities or economic interests." 
QUESTION THE WISDOM 
There were vigorous dissents to the deci-
sion. Justice Potter Stewart noted: "The 
Court's draconian pronouncement, which 
makes unconstitutional the legislatures of 
most of the 50 States, finds no support in 
the words of the Constitution, or in any 
prior decision of this Court, or in the 175-
year political history of our Federal 'Union." 
"It is difficult to imagine a more intolerable 
and inappropriate interference by the judi-
ciary with the independent legislatures of the 
States," said Justice John M. Harlan. 
"People are not ciphers. Legislators can 
represent their electors only by speaking for 
their interests?economic, social, political?
many of which do reflect where the electors 
live." 
Aroused critics from both political parties 
questioned the wisdom of the Court's flat. 
The Wall Street Journal summed up the 
feelings of many when it said, "The Court 
had a chance to bolster our traditions by 
requiring one house truly on population, 
and permitting the other on a geographical 
or other basis to reflect common interests. 
Instead of stopping with that, its fiat threw 
out institutions painfully wrought by exper-
ience and tried to substitute abstract 
theory." 
The House of Representatives was SO in-
censed that it rammed through a bill strip-
ping all Federal courts of the power to hear 
or review State legislative apportionment 
cases. The Senate passed a "sense of Con-
gress" with the purpose of asking the courts 
to go slow in forcing State legislatures to 
fall into line until the whole matter could 
be reviewed. 
MOSLEMS THAT COUNT 
Today, as this momentous issue is debated 
across the land, every citizen should ponder 
these points: 
1. The Court's decree threatens to spark 
a chain reaction that may go all the way 
down to the school-board level. There are 
3,072 counties in the United States, and 
91,185 local governments. How long will 
it be before the Federal courts poke into each 
of these units of representative democracy to 
take head counts and draw boundary lines? 
A Michigan court recently told Kent County's 
Board of Supervisors that it mutt be reap-
portioned on a population-only basis. Other 
suits have been filed in New York and Cali-
fornia. Where, exactly, will it end? 
"Carry the Court's decision to its logical 
conclusion," says William S. White, Pulitzer 
Prize-winning biographer and journalist, 
"and even the historic and deliberate popula-
tion imbalance in the U.S. Senate could not 
in any logic longer prevail," After all 
Navada's 285,000 citizens elect as may U.S. 
Senators as do New York's 17 million. 
2. The decision will swing 'the pendulum 
from legislatures with outdated apportion-
ment and too much rural weight, to legis-
latures under the raw control of metropoli-
tan vote-getting machines. In 25 States, 
more than half the population resides in 
metropolitan areas. In 14 States, three pop-
ulous counties or fewer will elect more than 
50 percent of the legislators? America's 
sprawling urban areas will call the shots, up 
and down the land. Chicago will hold sway 
over Illinois, Detroit over Michigan, Philadel-
phia and Pittsburgh over Pennsylvania, 
Phoenix over Arizona, and Las Vegas over 
Nevada. 
The specter of raids on State treasuries by 
metropolitan-dominated legislatures con-
cerns many. They see pressures mounting 
for more State funds for urban renewal, relief 
cases and public housing?with many of the 
funds being matched by U.S. tax dollars. 
These spending programs in turn will garner 
more votes for the city machines. Mayors in 
some States may soon be far more influential 
than the governors. 
New York is perhaps the most vivid case. 
Here 88 percent of the population has been 
able to elect a majority in the Senate, thus 
protecting certain underpopulated counties 
of this large State with all its diverse inter-
ests. But, under the Court's rule, it is only 
a matter of time before the New York City 
metropolitan area, with 63 percent of the 
State's population, will be completely domi-
nant. 
3. Some groups of voters can be wiped out, 
under a winner take all numerical system. 
The Court's decision, notes the Christian 
Science Monitor, "will tend to weaken the 
complex American system for diffusing power 
and protecting minorities." For example, 
under a purely numerical system of redis-
tricting, South Dakota's 30,000 Indians, who 
live in huge reservations covering entire 
counties, will lose two State senators who 
now watch out for their interests. 
Representative WILLIAM M. McCultocx, of 
Ohio, says: "People have ever-changing prob-
lems that sometimes fail to yield to computer 
logic. Some may be lumbermen, miners, 
1 Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, 
Delaware, HaWsli, Illinois, Massachusetts, 
Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Rhode 
Island, Utah, Washington. 
fishermen or farmers. Some may be of one 
religion or national origin peculiar in need 
or consideration. Some may direct their 
needs toward secondary roads or superhigh-
ways, while others are more concerned about 
the rapid transit system. Certainly the ma-
jority must have effective rule, but the mi-
nority, too, is entitled to effective representa-
tion, lest important segments of our people 
be completely subject to the tyranny of a 
teneporary majority." 
Chief Justice Warren himself declared, in 
1948, when he was Governor of California: 
"Many California counties are far more im-
portant in the life of the State than their 
population bears to the entire population of 
the State. It is for this reason that I have 
never been in favor of restricting the repre-
sentation in the [State] senate to a strictly 
population basis." 
4. The Court's decree is a dangerous in-
trusion by the Federal judiciary into the 
political affairs of the States. Hardly was 
the one-man-one-vote decision announced 
before lower courts showed how fast and how 
far they were willing to muscle in on the 
deliberations of State governments. Just 
2 days after the June 15 decision, a U.S. dis-
trict court directed the Michigan Apportion.. 
meat Commission to come up with a dis-
tricting plan in 48 hours. In a Vermont case 
appealecato the Supreme Court, it was ruled 
In January that the legislature must decide 
upon a plan and then disband?even though 
this defies the State constitution. 
In Oklahoma a three-man Federal district 
court ignored the machinery set up by the 
State for reapportionment and autocratically 
undertook to rearrange the States' legislative 
districts itself. It set up a master plan that 
was a nightmare of free-floating voting zones 
and mistakes. Angrily. Oklahoma's Sena-
tor MIKE Moaremenr said: "Hasty and ill-
advised redistricting formulas promulgated 
by the courts can result in confusion and 
inequities. Good local self-government can-
not be imposed from above. It must be gen-
erated by the poeple themselves." 
b. The Court's edict means that the citi-
zens of a State can no longer decide upon 
their own form of representative government. 
One of the six States involved in the Court's 
June 15 ruling was Colorado. Few States 
have so diligently attempted to work out 
a method of representation tailored to their 
own unique characteristics. Since it became 
a State in 1876, its legislature has been reap-
portioned five times. In the spring of 1962, 
citizens' groups gathered to work out a reap-
portionment amendment that would keep 
pace with the State's increasing urban 
growth. They split into two camps. One 
wanted both houses of the general assembly 
based on population alone; the other sup-
ported a Federal plan, keeping geographic 
representation in the senate. 
Each side took its case to the public. They 
fought up and dawn the State with count-
less speeches, debates, newspaper ads, bill-
board posters, radio and TV spots. This ref-
erendum overshadowed all other election 
issues in Colorado that year. And the out-
come was stunningly clear. The "Federal 
plan" won by 305,700 to 172,725. It carried 
every county in the State. 
The amendment was challenged; it was up-
held by a Federal district court. And then, 
on June 15, the Supreme Court threw out 
Colorado's plan. In an amazing statement, 
Chief Justice Warren said that, because the 
plan adopted was contrary to the Court's 
new ruling, Colorado's referendum vote was 
"without Federal constitutional signifiance." 
There were stinging dissents. Said Justice 
Tom C. Clark: "Colorado, by an overwhelm-
ing vote, has written the organization of its 
legislative body into its constitution. In 
striking down Colorado's plan of apportion-
ment, the Court is invading the valid func-
tioning of the procedures at the States, and

thereby commits a grievous error which will 
do irreparable damage to our Federal-State 
relationship." 
Today Colorado's senate has been redrawn 
to satisfy the Court. But the issue is still 
being debated. Meanwhile, the voters won-
der what, if anything, their ballot is worth, 
or their State constitution. 
WILL OF TUE PEOPLE 
Only one recourse is left to American cit-
izens who wish to restore our representative 
system to its original integrity: an amend-
Ment to the U.S. Constitution. Today in 
Congress, and in the States, forces are 
gathering behind proposals that would: 
1. Guarantee the citizens of every State 
the right to decide for themselves, by one-
man, one-vote ballot, the apportionment of 
their own legislature. 
2. Guarantee that this power will not be 
curtailed or reviewed by any Federal court. 
3. Guarantee that one house of each leg-
islature can reflect factors other than pop-
ulation if such apportionment has been 
submitted to a vote of the people. 
This in essence would be the 25th amend-
ment to the Constitution. Whether it is 
passed in Congress and ratified by the States 
Will depend upon the support It receives 
from the American people. The stakes 
are high?as high as the preservation of 
our Republic. 
DR. TELLER CONTINUES TO BE 
WRODR; LET US DEFEAT CIVIL 
DEFENSE SHELTER PROPOSAL 
Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President, 
throughout the great debate in Congress 
on the ratification of the limited nuclear 
test ban treaty, the chief opponent in the 
scientific community, and practically the 
only nationally noted scientist to op-
pose ratification of the treaty, was Dr. 
Edward Teller. 
Personally, I am very proud that the 
limited n,uclear test ban treaty, so pa-
tiently and thoroughly sought by Presi-
dent Eisenhower and by President Tru-
man before him, was finally ratified by 
the Senate during the term of our great 
late President John F. Kennedy. It will 
stand as one of the many monuments to 
his wisdom and determination. 
Throughout that time Dr. Teller was 
wrong in opposing the ratification of this 
treaty. He direly predicted doom for 
this Natfon were the nuclear test ban 
treaty to be ratified. 
The treaty was ratified by an over-
whelming vote in the Senate, and the first 
step toward permanent peace in this grim 
period of international anarchy was 
taken, the first step in a Journey of a 
thousand miles, as it was so eloquently 
stated by our late great President Ken-
nedy. In years to come historians may 
look upon the ratification of the limited 
nuclear test ban treaty as the most im-
portant single action taken by the U.S. 
Senate in this decade. It is certainly 
our hope and prayer and the prayer of 
free people the world over that eventu-
ally peoples of the world will enjoy per-
manent peace. 
. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
time of the Senator has expired. 
Mr. YOTJNG of Qhick. I ask unanimous 
consent that I may proceed for 3 addi-
tional minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered, 
Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President, 
Dr. Teller was dead wrong in 1962 and 
1963. He is wrong now. The nuclear 
test ban treaty has succeeded. There 
have been no violations. In fact, our 
Government has conducted more under-
ground nuclear tests than has the Soviet 
Union. 
Now this prophet of doom, Edward 
Teller, is highly critical of Government 
apathy toward the holes in the ground 
referred to by high salaried civil defense 
officials as "fallout shelters." He urges 
that the Federal Government undertake 
a mass shelter program, which by his 
own estimate will cost at least $20 billion 
over the next 10 years. This is a con-
servative estimate. 
Herman Kahn, one of the foremost 
proponents of fallout shelters, has esti-
mated that a reasonable program might 
involve a gradual buildup from about $1 
billion annually to somewhere in the 
neighborhood of $5 billion annually. A 
recent estimate by Prof. John Ullman, 
chairman of the Department of Manage-
ment of Hofstra College, would place the 
cost of an effective civil defense shelter 
system as high as $302 billion. Regard-
less of which of the expert opinions is 
cited, the price tag would be astro-
nomical. Even then, there is no guaran-
tee that a shelter program will be at all 
effective. With extensive advances be-
ing made in rocket and nuclear tech-
nology, many shelters would probably be 
obsolete and utterly useless before com-
pletion. One of the scientists now work-
ing on advanced weapons technology is 
reported to have said: "You ain't seen 
nothing yet, compared with what is 
coming into sight in the way of new 
weapons." 
There is the possibility of more deadly 
types of warfare for which shelters would 
offer no protection whatever?chemical 
and biological warfare. Any nation that 
would unleash a thermonuclear war 
would probably not hesitate to use other 
methods equally as terrifying. 
Is the Congress prepared to embark on 
such a vast gamble and to spend per-
haps $200 billion of taxpayers' money? 
Let us have no illusions. In reality this 
is what the civil defense planners and 
alarmists such as Edward Teller are ask-
ing us to do. 
Anyone who has taken the trouble to 
look into the matter is aware of the fact 
that most building owners have ignored 
or refused requests to provide shelters, 
and that ordinary citizens have lost in-
terest. During each crisis the get-rich-
quick shelter salesmen appear. As soon 
as the crisis abates and public interest 
fades completely, they crawl back under 
the rocks from whence they came. 
Communities throughout the Nation 
are awakening to the fact that thou-
sands of dollars of taxpayers' money 
have been spent on foolish programs 
with no tangible results except for the 
fact that in many instances lush posi-
tions at the public trough were provided 
for ex-politicians and city hall Parasites. 
Mr. President, there is no shelter build-
ing program in Great Britain, France, or 
in any of the major Western Powers. Re-
liable observers in the Soviet union re-
8481 
port that there is no fallout shelter pro-
gram in Russia. Henry Shapiro, dean of 
the American correspondents in Moscow, 
wrote: 
No foreigner here has seen any civil de-
fense shelters. The average citizen is un-
aware of the existence of shelters. 
Preston Grover of the Associated Press 
stated: 
Attaches from embassies who have looked 
around the country for sign of shelters have 
found nothing. Foreigners live in many of 
the newest buildings put up in Moscow, and 
they have no bomb shelters. 
In 1961, the New York Times published 
a report from Moscow by Harrison Salis-
bury which stated: 
About 12,000 miles of travel in the Soviet 
Union by this correspondent in the last 4 
weeks failed to turn up evidence of a single 
Soviet bomb shelter. Diplomats, foreign 
military attaches, and correspondents who 
have traveled widely in the Soviet Union re-
port that there is no visible evidence of a 
widespread shelter program. 
Gen. Curtis LeMay and others have 
said that our protection lies in spending 
money for offensive and defensive weap-
ons, rather than in preparing to hide in 
holes, waiting for conquering paratroop-
ers to come. 
Mr. President, this year the Congress 
is being asked to appropriate $200 mil-
lion to perpetuate this ridiculous shelter 
scheme. This is twice the amount re-
quested by the President for the Peace 
Corps; it is 125 times the amount re-
quested for the Commission on Civil 
Rights; it is 28 times the amount re-
quested for the Small Business Admin-
istration. 
Wherever and whenever possible our 
President and we in the Congress should 
be endeavoring to effect economy in 
Government without curtailing vital and 
needed programs both foreign and do-
mestic. In good conscience we should 
not appropriate anywhere near the huge 
sum requested for civil defense purposes. 
To do so would be to make a sham of 
efforts toward more economy in Govern-
ment, to encourage waste of taxpayers' 
money at all levels of Government, and 
a slap in the face to taxpayers. 
Mr. President, the average salary in 
the Civil Defense Division of the Depart-
ment of Defense is one of the highest 
in any agency in the Federal Govern-
ment?$11,478 a year. Compare with 
$10,085 for the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, $8,318 for the 
Small Business Administration, and 
$8,467 for the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation?agencies that are performing 
essential and worthwhile public services. 
Out of a total of 991 employees in the 
Civil Defense Division of the Department 
of Defense, 481?almost half?are 
GS-13 or above receiving from $13,336 
to $27,000 a year. The remaining 510 
are paid from $4,417 to $10,982 a year. 
Fifty-eight percent of those employed 
with the Civil Defense Division are class-
ified as professional employees; that is, 
GS-12 or above. Compare this with 35 
percent in the FBI and 37 percent in the 
NASA. What justification is there for 
such a high percentage of supersalaried 
bureaucrats in an agency performing so

little service to taxpayers. The civil de-
fense bureaucrats receive the most and 
do the least of all officials or employees 
of any agencies or departments in our 
Federal Government. 
The PRESIDING OtoriCER. The time 
of the Senator has again expired. 
Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 
2 additional minutes. 
The PRESIDING 0.10.toiCER. Without 
objection, it so ordered. 
Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President, 
these officials and employees do very 
little for their money except concoct 
plans and send messages to each other, 
and think up silly schemes which would 
accomplish very little except annoy 
citizens. They make estimates that if 
thus and so happens, 50 million Ameri-
cans will be killed. It is said that figures 
do not lie, but that liars figure. Inci-
dentally, they issue a civil defense book-
let on how to live through a nuclear 
bombing. In it they state: 
If you were near the explosion without 
adequate protection, you would be seriously 
affected by the immediate radiation, in ad-
dition to being killed. 
There is no excuse whatever for the 
waste of money and personnel for the 
civil defense agency as now operated. 
Since its inception it has cost American 
taxpayers more than one and a half 
billion dollars with no tangible results 
whatever. 
Mr. President, when I first began my 
investigation, research and protests 
against wasteful civil defense spending 
early in 1959 I was virtually alone in the 
Congress. Today I know that many of 
my colleagues share my views. This is 
evidenced by rollc,all votes at various 
times on efforts to reduce such spending, 
and by the fact last year we in the 
Senate succeeded in defeating in corn--
mittee the civil defense bill passed in 
the House of Representatives, authoriz-
ing an expenditure of $193 million. 
I am hopeful that a majority of 
Senators will agree this year to the ur-
gent necessity for drastically reducing 
the appropriations for this boondoggle. 
XHE PRESIDENT'S NEWS 
44,S* CONFERENCE 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, yes-
terday the President met with the press 
In a conference which was covered by 
TV and radio. His words were widely 
disseminated throughout the Nation and 
the world. It is most fortunate that 
they were because it was an excellent 
and highly informative interview. The 
President spoke with detailed knowledge 
on a great range of subjects. His re-
sponses were frank, straightforward, and 
most informative. 
In particular, President Johnson's re-
marks on Vietnam and other interna-
tional issues are of exceptional impor-
tance. They should be read and reread 
by all concerned both here and abroad. 
Once again, he underscored his great 
desire and continuing quest for a ra-
tional peace in Vietnam and southeast 
Asia. He deplored the violence which 
prevails there, noting correctly that it 
Is being suffered most not in North Viet-
nam but in South Vietnam and by 
Americans as well as Vietnamese. 
He made clear that his desire is to see 
a termination of this violence, on all 
sides and as quickly as possible. To that 
end, he stressed once again his willing-
ness to enter into unconditional discus-
sions. I would hope that this open door 
to peaceful settlement will be noted, 
along with his determination to stay 
with the situation until the people of 
Vietnam do have an assured freedom of 
choice as to their future. Both his 
words of peace and his determination 
should be heeded in Hanoi, Saigon, and 
among all those who are carrying on the 
warfare in South Vietnam. 
I would call attention, too, to the 
President's expressed aversion to the 
name-calling and labeling which has ac-
companied some of the debate and dis-
cussion of the Vietnamese question. Dis-
cussion in the Senate on Vietnam or any 
foreign policy issue, as I have noted on 
many previous occasions, has been and 
can -continue to be useful. The Presi-
dent's comments on this matter in his 
press conference point the way to their 
most effective utilization. I quote these 
words in full: 
I don't believe in characterizing people 
with labels. I think you do a great disserv-
ice when you engage in name-calling. We 
want honest, forthright discussion in this 
country, and that will be a discussion with 
differences of views, and we welcome what 
our friends have to say, whether they agree 
with us or not. And I would not want to 
label people who agree with me or disagree 
with me. 
These words are on appropriate answer 
to those who have taken exception to 
the immense value?indeed, the vital 
necessity?to the Nation of free and re-
sponsible discussion of all points of view 
on the Vietnamese situation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the President's press 
conference be included at this point in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the news conference was ordered to be 
Printed in the RECORD, as follows:

TRANSCRIPT or THE PRESIDENT'S NEWS CON-
? FERENCE ON PORE/GN AND DOMESTIC MAT-
TERS 
(Norm?Following is a transcript of Pres-
ident Johnson's news conference in Wash-
ington yesterday, as recorded by the New 
York Times.) 
OPENING STATEMENT 
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, I 
am glad to see that you are willing to trade 
your new comfort in the west lobby for 
these stmightbacked chairs in the East 
Room. 
Today I have somewhat of a conflict of 
emotions. I wanted to give you due and 
adequate 8-day notice of a press conference, 
and at the same time I didn't want to man-
age the news by holding up announcement 
of some appointees I have here today. Bo, 
we have tried to reconcile the two, and a 
little later in the statement I want to pre-
sent to you some men that, over the week-
end, I selected to occupy some important 
posts in Government. 
VIETNAM STRUGGLE 
We are engaged in a crucial struggle in 
Vietnam. Some may consider it a small war, 
but to the men who give their lives it is 
the last war, and the stakes are high. 
Independent South Vietnam has been at-
tacked by North Vietnam. The object of 
that attack is total conquest. Defeat in 
South Vietnam would deliver a friendly na-
tion to terror and repression. 
It would encourage and spur on those who 
seek to conquer all free nations that are 
within their reach. Our own welfare, our 
own freedom, would be in great danger. 
This is the clearest lesson of our time. 
From Munich until today, we have learned 
that to yield to aggression brings only greater 
threats and brings even more destructive 
war. To stand firm is the only guarantee of 
a lasting peace. 
At every step of the way we have used our 
great power with the utmost restraint. We 
have made every effort possible to find a 
peaceful solution. We have done this in the 
face of the most outrageous and brutal prov-
ocation against Vietnamese and against 
Americans alike. 
Through the first 7 months of 1964, both 
Vietnamese and Americans were the targets 
of constant attacks of terror. Bombs ex-
ploded in helpless villages, in downtown 
movie theaters, even at the sports fields where 
the children played. Soldiers and civilians, 
men and woMen, were murdered and crip-
pled, yet we took no action against the 
source of this brutality?North Vietnam. 
When our destroyers were attacked in the 
Gulf of Tonkin, as you will remember, last 
summer, we replied promptly with a single 
raid. The punishment then was limited to 
the deed. 
For the next 6 months we took no action 
against North Vietnam. We warned of 
danger. We hoped for caution in others. 
Their answer was attack and explosion and 
indiscriminate murder. So, it soon became 
Clear that our restraint was viewed as weak-
ness; our desire to limit conflict was viewed 
as a prelude to our surrender. We could no 
longer stand by while attack mounted and 
While the bases of the attackers were im-
mune from reply. 
And, therefore, we began to strike back. 
But America has not changed her essential 
position?and that purpose is peaceful set-
tlement; that purpose is to resist aggression; 
that purpose is to avoid a Wider war. 
I say again that I will talk to any govern-
ment, anywhere, any time, without any con-
ditions; and, if any doubt our sincerity, let 
them test us. Each time we have met with 
silence or slander or the sound of guns, bat, 
just as we will not flag in battle, we will not 
weary in the search for peace. 
So, I reaffirm my offer of unconditional 
discussions. We will discuss any subject and 
any point of view with any government con-
cerned. This offer may be rejected, as it has 
been in the past, but it will remain open, 
waiting for the day when it becomes clear to 
all that armed attack will not yield domina-
tion over others. 
And I will continue along the course that 
we have set?firmness with moderation, 
readiness for peace with refusal to retreat. 
For this is the same battle which we've 
fought for a generation. Wherever we have 
stood firm, aggression has been halted, peace 
has been restored and liberty has been main-
tained. This was true under President 
Truman, under President Eisenhower, uncle] 
President Kennedy, and it will be true again 
in southeast Asia. 
STEEL AGREEMENT 
I want to go now to another subject. 
I want to congratulate the negotiators for 
the steel companies and the United Steel-
workers Union on the statesmanlike agree-

CONGRESSIONAL R.ECORD SENATE 8483 
Inelat that they reached yesterday to extend 
their contract. I hope and I expect that it 
will be approved by the union's committee 
tomorrow. 
While the settlement reached in steel is 
? only an interim one, I think we can be con-
fident that the _Waal settlement will be a re-
sponsible one which full considers not only 
the interests of the immediate parties but 
also the larger public interest. 
So far in 1965, our record of wage-price 
stability remains intact. A survey of the 
wage increases in more than 600 collective 
bargains settled so far this year shows that, 
on the average, the percentage' increases were 
unchanged from the moderate increases 
agreed on in the same period last year. A 
number of important settlements were at 
-approximately the level of our guideposts. 
And this record of private action is most 
encouraging. 
rzerstat. BUDGET 
Today I can report to you and to the 
Nation that our expanding economy will pro-
duce higher Federal revenues this year than 
We estimated to Congress in January. 
can also report that our continuing 
drive to hold down Government spending 
Will produce lower expenditures this year 
than we estimated to Congress in January. 
As a result, we expect the actual budget 
deficit for fiscal 1965 to be at least $1 billion 
below the $6.3 billion estimated last Jan-
nary, when we sent our budget to Congress. 
Our expenditures, therefore, will be de-
creased by approximately $600 million under 
our estimate, and the revenues collected will 
be increased approximately $500 million over 
our estimates. 
;OB CORPS CAMPS 
I'm pleased also to announce today that the 
war On poverty is setting 10 new Job Corps 
conservation camps in nine States. They 
have mu te 37 the number of centers that 
provide skills and education to our young-
sters who are out of school and of work. 
These-new centers will be located in the 
States of .Arizona and Maine and Minnesota 
and Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, 
Ohio, Utah, and Washington.

and able Man has served in Government for 
21 years under four Presidents. He was 
President Truman's special counsel in the 
White House. He has performed with out-
ite,nding quality as Under Secretary of Agri-
etiltare. T.,pday I'm nominating him to be-
dome chairman, of the Civil Aeronautics 
Board. 
Gen. WilLiana F. McKee. He is a four-star 
general who was a vice chief of the Air Force 
and on retirement became special assistant 
to the administrator of the National Aero-
No. '75-17 
nautics and Space Administration. Secre-
tary McNamara has called him one of the 
most knowledgeable and competent admin-
istrators in the Defense Department with 
skills in research and development and ad-
ministration, procurement and logistics, and 
today I'm nominating him to be the new ad-
ministrator of the Federal Aviation Agency.

College. Since 1961, he has served as deputy 
legal adviser in the State Department. To-
day I am nominating him to become legal 
adviser in the State Department. 
DOMINICAN CRISIS 
We are all very much concerned about the 
serious situation which has developed in the 
last few hours in the Dominican Republic. 
Fighting has occurred among different ele-
ments of the Dominician armed forces and 
other groups. Public order in the capital at 
Santo Domingo has broken down. 
Due to the gravity of the situation and the 
possible danger to lives of American citizens 
in the Dominican Republic, I ordered the 
evacuation of those who wished to leave. As 
you know, the evacuation is now proceeding. 
My latest information is that 1,000 Ameri-
cans have already been taken aboard ships 
of the U.S. Navy off the port of Haina, 8 
miles west of Santo Domingo. 
We profoundly deplore the violence and 
disorder in the Dominican Republic. The 
situation is grave and we are following the 
developments very closely. It is our hope 
that order can promptly be restored and that 
a peaceful settlement of their internal prob-
lems can be found. 
DEATH OP MURROW 
I have just received the sad news of the 
passing of Edward R. Murrow. It came to 
me just a little while ago. I believe that all 
of us feel a deep sense of loss. We who knew 
him knew that he was a gallant fighter, a 
man who dedicated his life, both as a news-
man and as a public official, to an unrelent-
ing search for truth. He subscribed to the 
proposition that free men and free inquiry 
are inseparable. He built his life on that 
unbreakable truth. We have all lost a friend. 
QUESTIONS 
1. Vietnam policy 
Question. Mr. President, do you think 
any of the participants in the national dis-
cussion on Vietnam could appropriately be 
likened to the appeasers of 25 or 30 years 
ago? 
Answer. I don't believe in characterizing 
people with labels. I think you do a great 
disservice when you engage in name calling. 
We want honest, forthright discussion in this 
country, and that will be a discussion with 
differences of views, and we welcome what 
our friends have to say, whether they agree 
with us or not. And I would not want to 
label people who agree with me or disagree 
with me. 
2. India border strife 
Question. Mr. President, what can you--
can yon tell us your reaction, or any informa-
tion you have, on the reports of seemingly 
intensified fighting between the Indians and 
the forces of Pakistan, and could this pos-
sibly relate or have an effect on the fighting 
in Vietnam? 
Answer. We deplore fighting wherever it 
takes place. We have been in close touch 
with the situation there. We are very hope-
ful that ways and means can be found to 
avoid conflict between these two friends of 
our country. I talked to Secretary Rusk 
about it within the hour, and we are anxious 
to do anything and everything that we can 
do to see that peace is restored in that area 
and conflict is ended. 
3. Disarmament talks 
Question. Mr. President, today the Soviet 
Union agreed to a French proposal for a five-
power nuclear disarmament conference which 
would include Communist China as a nu-
clear power. What would be your attitude 
to this proposal, sir? 
Answer. I have not studied the proposal 
and was not familiar with the fact that it 
had been made. 
4. Vietnam talks 
Question. Mr. President, the only formal 
answer so far to your Baltimore speech was 
that by the North Vietnamese Prime Min-
ister, Pham Van Dong, Who offered a four-
point formula) which he suggested was a 
possible basis for negotiations. My question - 
is: Do you regard the four points as so un-
acceptable as to be a complete rejection of 
your offer to begin discussions or are there 
portions of the four points which interest 
you and which you might be willing to 
discuss? 
Answer. I think that it was very evident 
from the Baltimore speech that most of the 
non-Communist countries in the world wel-
comed the proposal in that speech and most 
of the Communist countries found objec-
tions to it. I am very hopeful that some 
ways and means can be found to bring the 
parties who are interested in southeast Asia 
to a conference table. 
Now just what those ways and means will 
be I do not know. Bu,t every day we ex-
plore to the limit of our capacity every pos-
sible political and diplomatic move that 
would bring that about. 
5. Chinese volunteers 
Question. I wonder, sir, if you could 
evaluate for us the threat that's been posed 
by Red China to send volunteers into Viet-
nam if we escalate the war further? 
Answer. We have read their statements 
from time to time and the statements of 
other powers about what they propose to do. 
We are in close touch with the situation and 
that's all I think I would like to say on that 
matter. 
6. War on poverty 
Question. Mr. President, there's been some 
criticism at the local level in this country of 
your war on poverty and one of the chief 
complaints is that the local community ac-
tion groups do not represent the poor. Have 
you found any basis for this criticism and 
do you feel that criticism such as this could 
have a demoralizing effect on the overall pro-
gram? 
Answer. Yes, I think that there has been 
unjust criticism, and unfair criticism, and 
uninformed criticism of the poverty program 
even before Congress passed it. 
Some people opposed it every step of the 
way, some people oppose it now. I don't 
know of any national program in peace time 
that has reached so many people so fast and 
so effectively. 
Over 16,000 Americans have already volun-
teered to live and work with the Peace Corps 
.domestically. A quarter of a million young 
men have joined the Job Corps. Every major

city has developed poverty plans and made 
applications for funds. Three hundred 
States and city and county community ac-
tion programs have already received their 
money. Forty-five thousand students from 
needy families are already enrolled in 800 
colleges- under the work program. 
More than 125,000 adults are trainees in 
adult education on the work experience pro-
gram. 
We will have difficulties, we will have 
politicians attempting to get sortie jobs in 
the local level; we'll have these differences 
as we do in all of our programs. But I 
have great confidence in Sargent Shriver as 
an administrator and as a man. And I have 
great confidence in the wisdom the Congress 
displayed In passing the poverty program and 
I think it will be one of the great monu-
ments to this administration. 
7. U.S. prestige 
Question. Mr, President, is it trite that the 
United States is losing rather than making 
friends around the world with its policy in 
Vietnam?sort of a falling-domino theory in 
reverse? 
Ansvier. I think that we have friends 
throughout the world. I'm not concerned 
with any friends that we've lost. Following 
my Baltimore speech, I received from our 
allies almost universal approval. 
Our enemies would have you believe that 
we are following policies that are ill-advised, 
but NW? are following the same policies in 
Asia that we followed in Europe, that we fol-
lowed in Turkey and Greece and Iran. We 
are resisting aggression, and as long as the 
aggressors attack, we will stay there and 
resist them, whether we make friende or lose 
friends. 
8. Voting rights bill 
Question. Mr. President, your voting rights 
bill is moving toward completion in the Sen-
ate oig weak. Do you think that the pro-
posal?the amendment to abolish the poll 
tax WOUld make this unconstitutional? Do 
pan thtiik it would damage the passage of the 
bill in the Rouse? And ivhat fib you think 
about it generally? 
Answer. I think that that is being Worked 
out in poriferences they're having today and 
they Will have in the neat few weeks. I 
have -graWays opposed the poll tax. I am op-
posed to it now. I have been advised by 
constitutional lawyers that we 'have a prob-
lem in repealing the poll tax by statute. 
For that reason, while a Member' of Con-
gress, I initiated and supported a constitu-
tional amendment to repeal the poll tax in 
Federal elections I think the bill as now 
drawn Will not permit the poll tax to be 
used to disoriminate against-Noters and I 
think-the administration win have adequate 
authOalty to prevent its use for'that purpose. 
I have asked the Attorney General, how-
. 
even, tO meet With the various Members of 
the Itause and Senate who are interested in 
this phase Of it and, if possible, take every 
step' that he can within constitutiemal 
bounds to see that the Poll tat is not used as 
a discrimination against any voter, anywhere. 
9. Critics of bombing 
Question. Mr. Pretident, a ritimber Of di-A-
les 'Of yratir Vietnaria pcatcy say they" support 
ournaresence in South Vietnam but do not 
support the 'bombing raids to the North. I 
woncler if there is anything you can say to 
them and What you can say on any condi-
tions that Might arise under which you feel 
the raids could be stopped? 
Answer. I said in my opening statement 
that we Went for months without destroying 
a bridge, or an ammunition depot, or a radar 
station. Those military targets have been 
the primary targets that we have attacked. 
There's no blood in a bridge mane of con-
crete and steel. 
But we do try to take it out so that people 
cannot furnish additional troops and addi-
tional equipment to kill the people of South 
Vietnam and to kill our own soldiers. 
There are not many civilians involved in a 
radar station. But we do try to make it in-
effective so that they cannot plot our planes 
and shoot our boys out of the skies. There 
are not many individuals involved in an am-
munition dump. But we have tried to de-
stroy that ammunition so it would be ex-
ploded in North Vietnam and not in the 
bodies of the' people of South Vietnam or 
our American soldiers. 
We have said time and again that we regret 
the necessity of doing this. But as long as 
aggression continues, as long as they bomb 
In South Vietnam, as long as they bomb our 
sports arenas and our theaters and our em-
bassies and kill our women and our children, 
and the Vietnamese soldiers--severin thou-
sand of whom have been killed since the first 
of the year?we think that we are justified in 
trying to slow down that operation and make 
them realize that it is very costly and that 
their aggression should cease. 
I do sometimes wonder how some people 
can be so concerned with our bombing a cold 
bridge of steel and concrete in North Viet-
nam but never open their mouth about a 
bomb being placed in our Embassy iri South 
,Vietnam. 
The moment that this aggression ceases, 
the destruction of their bridges and their 
radar stations, and the ammunition that 
they use on * * *. 
10. Shastri visit 
Question. Mr. President, on your can-
cellation of the Ayub and Shastri visits, some 
of your critics have said that the reasons for 
your postponement were sound, but the 
abruptness of it left millions of Asians angry 
at this country. Is anything being done to 
correct that impression on their part? 
Answer. Well, first of all, I Would not 
assume many parts of your statement. First, 
we didn't cancel it, so that's the first error 
that the critics have made, We feel very 
friendly toward the people of India and the 
Government of India, toward the people of 
Pakistan and the Government of Pakistan. 
I have spent Brame time ih both of those 
countries. 
I've had the leaders of those countries visit 
me in this country, and visit in my home. 
I have before the Congress now recom-
mendations concerning the peoples of those 
countries, and how we can work together 
to try to achieve peace in the world. 
I said, through the appropriate channels, 
to those governments that I had had some 
8 or 9 visitors already the first 90 days 
of this administration, that the Congress was 
hopeful that it would get out of here early 
summer, that we had approximately 75 top 
important measures that we were trying to 
get considered and passed, 1 of which 
vitally affected that part of the world, and 
that I could be mucit more 'comm-unicative 
and could respond much snore to their sug-
gestions and to their recommendations on the 
future of India and their 5-year plan and 
Pakistan and their plan if our visit could 
follow the enactment of some of these bills 
instead a precede them, because if they pre-
ceded thein, I could not speak with author-
ity?I would not know what the Congress 
would do. 
We will spend--we have spent, oh, in ex-
cess of $10 billion in that area, and this year 
we will propose expenditures of more than 
$1 billion. But if the Congress said "No" to 
me, and didn't pass the foreign aid bill or 
materially reduced it, I would have made a 
commitment that I could not support. 
So I said that if you would like to come 
now, in the month of May or June during this 
period, ave can have a visit, but we will not 
be able to be as responsive as I would like to 
be if you could come a little later in the year. 
And I've been host a few times in my life, 
and when. you put things that way, most peo-
April 28, 1965 
plc want to conic at the time that would be 
most convenient to us?to the hoat?and 
would be most helpful to them. And we 
Communicated that to the appropriate people, 
and the answer came back that they would 
accept that decision. 
Now I think it was a good decision in our 
interest, and I think it was a good decision in 
their interest, and I'm very sorry that our 
people have made a good deal of it. 
But the provocation of the differences 
sometimes comes about, and I regret it, and 
so far as I know, it's a good decision and a 
wise one and one that I would make again at 
the moment. 
11. Nuclear weapons 
Question. Mr. President, there were?in 
light of the new reports that came over the 
weekend, I wonder if you could clarify for ua 
your position concerning the possibility of 
the use of nuclear weapons in southeast Asia? 
Answer. Well, first of all, I have the re-
sponsibility for decision on nuclear weapons. 
That rests with the President. It is the most 
serious responsibility that rests with him. 
Secretary McNamara very carefully and very 
clearly in his television appearance yesterday 
covered that subject thoroughly and, I think, 
adequately, and there's not anything that I 
could really add to what he said. 
I would observe this, that I've been Presi-
dent for 17 months, and I have sat many 
hours and weeks with the officials of this 
Government in trying to plan for the pro-
tection and security of our people, and I 
have never had a suggestion from a single 
official of this Government or employe of this 
Government concerning the use of such 
weapons in this area. 
The only person that has ever mentioned 
it to me has been a newspaperman writing 
a story, and each time I tell him, please, get 
it out of your system?please forget it. 
There's just not anything to it. No one 
has discussed it with us at all. And I think 
that when Secretary McNamara told you of 
the requirement yesterday, and that no use-
ful purpose was served by going into it 
further, I thought it had ended there. 
/2. Charge by Hanoi 
Question, Mr. President, the North Viet-
namese today, sir, say that in a raid on 
Sunday the United States and South Viet-
nam used what they called toxic chemicals. 
Now can you tell us, sir, what they might be 
talking about? 
Answer. I wouldn't know. I frequently 
see statements they make that we never 
heard of, and I don't know about the par-
ticular report that you mention. 
13. Troops in Vietnam 
Question, Mr. President, are there?could 
there come about, as you now see the situ - 
ation in Vietnam, could there be circum-
stances in which the?which large number; 
of American troops might be engaged in the 
fighting of the war rather than in the advis-
ing and assistance to the South Vietnamese? 
Answer. Our purpose in Vietnam is, as you 
well know, to advise and to assist those peo-
ple in resisting aggression. We are per-
forming that dirty there now. I would not be 
able to anticipate or to speculate on the 
conduct of each individual in the days ahead. 
I think that if the enemy there bellevc s 
that we are there to stay, that we are not 
going to tuck our tails and run home and 
abandon our friends, I believe in due tin '.e 
peace can be observed in that area. 
My objective is to contribute what we can 
to aseist the people of South Vietnam, wl o 
have lost thousands of lives defending their 
country and to provide the maximu n 
amount of deterrent with the minimum 
cost. They have lost thousands of people 
since February. We have lost some 40 to 150 
people of our own. We could not anticipate 
in February whether we'd lose 50 or whether 
we'd lose 500.

That depends on the fortunes and the 
problems of conflict. But I can assure 
you that we are being very careful, we're be-
ing very studious, and we're being very de-
liberate?that we're trying to do everything 
We can within reason to convince these peo-
ple that they should not attack, that they 
should not be aggressors, that they should 
not try to follow?swallow up their neigh-
bor, and we are doing it with the minimum 
amount of expenditure of lives that we can 
spend. 
14. Steel productivity 
Question. Mr. President, labor, and man-
agement in steel have different versions of 
what their increase in productivity is. Can 
you tell us what your advisers figure this is 
arid whether you think a settlement in ex-
cess of 2.7 percent of the interim agreement 
would be acceptable? 
Answer: I don't want to pass on?we have 
laid down the guideposts, they're well ac-
quainted with them, both management and 
employees. They have had very responsible 
negotiations. 
We are very pleased with the outcome of 
those negotiations. We anticipate that they 
will be confirmed by both parties very short-
ly, and we believe between now and the 
September deadline that we will have an 
agreement. 
don't think that I've ever observed a 
period in the life of free enterprise in this 
country when American labor and American 
business have been more responsible and 
have been more anxious to work with this 
Government in maintaining full productiv-
ity, and I expect that that will come about. 
Question. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana subsequently 
said: Mr. President, I wish to applaud 
the strong stand of the President as it 
concerns the position of this Nation in 
Vietnam. The President made it clear 
that we are in Vietnam to resist aggres-
sion, that we are there to help a friendly 
government protect itself against sub-
version and aggression from without. 
We wish to see that the Government 
of North Vietnam keeps its pledged word 
Under Pie Geneva agreement which it 
signed, an agreement which that Gov-
ernment has violated in many ways. 
It is costing this Government the lives 
of many American fighting men to assist 
a friendly power. Let me point out to 
those who do not seem to be aware of it, 
that the friendly Government of South 
Vietnam is doing the fighting there, that 
only a small portion of the fighting is 
being done by American troops. We 
have approximately 30,000 troops in that 
area. There are approximately 500,000 
South Vietnamese troops fighting in the 
area. In other words, South Vietnam 
has approximately 15 men fighting 
against communism for every man the 
United States has there to assist that 
friendly power. In addition, our friends 
who are doing the fighting have done a 
rather good job of it. The estimate I 
saw was that approximately 89,000 Viet-
cong and North Vietnamese invaders 
have been killed by the forces of South 
Vietnam which has not sustained nearly 
so many casualties as the Vietcong and 
the ktorth .Viethainese invaders. It has 
been estimated that approximately one 
South Vietnamese has been killed in bat-
tle, or rnis,sing, for every three Vietcong 
killed. The last figures I saw indicate 
that the kill ratio in battle for the fight-
ers whom we are _supporting in South 
Vietnam in recent weeks is approxi-
mately six Vietcong killed for every 
South Vietnamese lost. 
On that basis, it appears that the 
enemy has lost approximately 200 men 
for every 1 American lost in the defense 
of freedom against communism. 
Mr. President, if we have to run up the 
white flag and surrender to a small back-
ward Communist power of 19 million 
people when the enemy is suffering cas-
ualties 200 times as great as ours, then 
this great Nation of over 190 million will 
be a far cry from what it has been in my 
time. 
I notice that the present Presiding 
Officer in the chair is the new Senator 
from the State of South Carolina [Mr. 
RUSSELL], who was on the "Today" pro-
gram this morning. He made an excel-
lent presentation, for one who has not 
had an occasion to study the question at 
the Washington level because he was dis-
charging his responsibilities as Governor 
of South Carolina. He showed an under-
standing of the problem. He stated 
what I believe to be the case in Louisiana, 
that the people in our State are behind 
the President in his efforts to resist Com-
munist subversion and aggression. 
We applaud the President for the posi-
tion he takes, that we will not surrender 
to communism, that we will meet force 
with greater force, that we will use such 
force as may be necessary, that we are 
not going to let Communist aggressors 
and Communist revolutionaries over-
throw friendly powers by means of 
brutality, murder, kidnaping, assassina-
tion, or whatever device along that line 
happens to fit their methods. 
The President stated quite clearly that 
this Nation is willing to negotiate. MY 
impression is that every diplomatic 
channel available to us has been used to 
inform both the powers of Hanoi, Peiping, 
and Moscow that we are ready to negoti-
ate at any time, on any honorable and 
reasonable basis; but that we are not pre-
pared to surrender. We intend to strike 
them when they strike us, that when 
they undertake to attack Americans, to 
attack our ships at sea, to blast down our 
barracks and assassinate our people, we 
expect to strike them with whatever 
means are available to us and which 
seem appropriate to use under particu-
lar circumstances. 
Mr. President, it is my understanding 
that the text of yesterday's news con-
ference by President Johnson has al-
ready been placed in the RECORD by the 
majority leader. I recommend his state-
ment on Vietnam to my colleagues and 
to all Americans as a clear, unequivocal, 
easily understood declaration of U.S. 
policy in Vietnam. 
THE WAR IN VIETNAM 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, repeat-
edly I have made it clear on the floor of 
the Senate that I want to stand as a part 
of the solid phalanx of Members of the 
Senate and the people of the country who 
offer prayers and support for President 
Johnson as he deals with the delicate, 
grave, and troublesome problems of 
southeast Asia and South Vietnam. 
8485 
I would first observe that those who 
look for immediate and dramatic solution 
to the "South Vietnam problem" or the 
"southeast Asia problem" by negotiation 
or unilateral action by the United States, 
whether it be the strategic bombing of 
cities or the withdrawal of our forces and 
a cessation of the present bombing of 
military targets, look in vain. History 
shows that in international relations, as 
in human relations, serious problems are 
seldom lastingly solved in one fell swoop. 
We must prepare for a long period 
ahead when our perseverance and con-
tinuing interest in the peoples of south-
east Asia will be required if their eco-
nomic, social and political rights as in-
dividuals are to be allowed to flourish 
and develop, free from external aggres-
sion and internal terrorism and unrest. 
While we are deeply motivated by a 
national sense of compassion and hu-
manity, we must nevertheless continue to 
recognize that our own interests are in-
volved in South Vietnam; that our power 
and prestige have been committed there 
by three Presidents; that those in that 
area who seek to build their own future 
free of Communist domination are 
watching closely to judge how valid our 
commitment to them is in the light of 
how we respond to our obligations to 
South Vietnam. 
History clearly shows that aggression, 
even in that tiny and remote area of the 
world designated South Vietnam, threat-
ens the peace and security of our country 
and of the world. 
History clearly teaches that unchecked 
aggression builds and feeds on itself and 
is reproduced and duplicated until stop-
ping it requires a much greater cost in 
lives and treasure than if resistance had 
first been made. 
Furthermore, almost no one now faults 
President Truman for his momentous 
decision, following World War II, under 
the courageous Truman doctrine, to aid 
Greece, for example, to stabilize its politi-
cal independence and its resistance to 
Communist domination, by helping it 
to quell Communist guerrilla activities 
within its borders, activities which were 
aided and abetted externally. 
The case of aggression in Vietnam is 
even more flagrant. Let no one say that 
this country is more interested in Europe 
than in Asia. Let it be known that this 
country is as interested in the peoples of 
Asia as it is in the peoples of Europe. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed at this point in the 
RECORD an editorial entitled "L.B.J.'s 
Appeal for Viet Peace," published in the 
San Francisco Chronicle in April.1965. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the San Francisco Chronicle, 
Apr. 19661 
L.B.J.'s APPEAL FOR VIET PEACE 
The transcendent sincerity and earnest 
good will of Lyndon Johnson are qualities 
which show through the TV screen on occa-
sions like the Johns Hopkins speech on Viet-
nam Wednesday night. Many confused 
Americans who had been wondering darkly 
what the President was really up to in 
southeast Asia, suddenly found themselves

8486 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
swept along with the Johnson dream of a 
Great Society along the Mekong. 
Such is the measure of a. great speech, 
that it can convert doubts into conviction 
and cross purposes into purposeful new di-
rections. This timely, indeed overdue, ad-
dress reached occasional peaks of eloquenre 
(we offer an example in the editorial be-
low) and conveyed the impression that our 
intentions in Vietnam are both humane and 
plausible. Undoubtedly almost every Amer-
ican who heard or read it was filled with 
renewed hope that somehow the President% 
offers?of "unconditional discussions and of 
a billion dollars for southeast Asia% devel-
opment program?will promptly bring nego-
tiators to a table where peace with honor 
can be agreed to. 
For unquestionably, the American people 
want to get detached from the interminable 
conflict that has been going on almost with-
out interruption in Indochina since the early 
1940's. Yet at the same time, most would 
heartily support the President In refusing to 
abandon South Vietnam, "this small and 
brave nation," to its enemy. 
Our objective is the independence of South 
Vietnam and its freedom from attack, said 
the President, and he wishes ft were possible 
to "convince others with words of what we 
now find it necessary to say with guns and 
planes," namely, that armed ?hostility is fu-
tile because our resources are equal to any 
challenge. Once this is clear, there could be 
many ways tO peace through "unconditional 
discussions" with the governments con-
cerned; in large groups or small ones; in the 
reaffirmation of old agreements (the Geneva 
agreement of 1954?) or in new' ones that 
strengthen the old. 
This constitutes an offer, and it is clearly 
his hope that those who threaten South 
Vietnam's independence, i.e., "the readers of 
North Vietnam," will respond to it. If they 
do respond, a mighty aid program beneficial 
to all countries of southeast Asia, including 
North Vietnam, will be set in motion. 
However the Communist powers may react, 
and that will probably not become clear for 
some time, the President's speech has very 
effectively impressed the British, the Cana-
dians and the French, whose smanort we 
certainly need; and it has earned" the warm 
approbation of Secretary General IT Thant of 
the United Nations, whose good offices' were 
only recently being rather summarily re-
buffed by the State Department. 
The prestige and good name of America 
have been rescued and repaired, we hope and 
believe, by the President's performance. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, while 
the hope expressed in the editorial that 
the response from the other side would 
be favorable tO the President's call for 
"unconditional discussion" has not thus 
far Materialized., nevertheless, the edi-
torial calls to mind again, in the midst 
of public dialog oft this subject, that 
President Johnson has no policy in south-
east Asia other than peace and stability, 
and that his speech at Johns Hopkins 
'University brought reeoMition of that 
fact here and abroad. 
Each of Us should be careful to note 
in our remarks that our goal is peace; 
and that President Johnson has clearly 
declared how it may be anhfeved. 
Each of us should recognize that he 
who takes risks now in order to achieve 
a just and lasting peace is no Tess a peace-
maker than, he who advocates peace im-
mediately but with no assurances against 
having to defend or enforce it later at a 
much greater price. 
THE NEW EDUCATION BILL 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed at 
this point in the RECORD an article en-
titled "The New Education Bill," written 
by W. Barry Garrett, associate director 
of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public 
Affairs, Washington, D.C. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[Prom the Baptist Messenger, Apr. 22, 19651 
TUE NEW EDUCATION Bria. 
(By W. Barry Garrett, associate director, 
Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, 
Washington, D.C.) 
The Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act of 1965 has passed the House of Repre-
sentatives and the Senate of the U.S. Con-
gress by overwhelming majorities. The bill 
has been signed by the President and is now 
the law of the land. 
Much confusion is abroad about the bill. 
This brief question and answer article will 
attempt to clarify some of the misunder-
standings about it. 
Question. What are the provisions of the 
bill? 
Answer. It extends the federally impacted 
area, aid program for another 2 years. In 
addition it does the following: 
1. It authorizes $1.06 billion for public 
school agencies for the education of children 
of low-income families. 
2. It authorizes $100 million to State pub-
lic education agencies for school library re-
sources, textbooks, and other instructional 
materials for children and teachere in pub-
lic and private elementary and secondary 
schools. 
3. It authorizes $100 million to public 
school agencies for the creation of supple-
mentary educational centers and services 
available to all the schoolchildren in a com-
munity. 
4. It authorizes $100 million to be allocated 
by the U.S. Commissioner of Education to 
universities, colleges, and other public and 
private research agencies to develop educa-
tional research and training. 
5. It authorizes $25 million for grants to 
States to strengthen State departments of 
education. 
The total of these authorized appropria-
tions is $1.305 billion. 
Question. Does the bill give aid to paro-
chial schools? 
Answer. The bill does not authorize any 
grant of funds or provide for services to pri-
vate schools. All of the appropriations for 
elementary and secondary education are to 
public agencies. 
Question. Does the bill give aid to paro-
chial school pupils? 
Answer. Yes. If the private school has 
children from poor families ($2,00a or less 
annual income) the public school that re-
ceives aid from this bill must provide them 
"special educational services awl arrange-
ments (such as dual enrollment, educational 
radio and television, and mobile educational 
services and equipment)" in which private 
school pupils can participate. 
Other aids to private school pupils are 
school library resources, textbooks and other 
Instructional materials. The supplementary 
educational centers and services are also 
available to all school children in a com-
munity. 
Question. Through what channels or agen-
cies will these aids be available to private 
school pupils? 
Answer. Only through public agencies. 
The bill requires that the local educational 
agency will maintain administration and 
April 28, 1965 
control of the programs available to private 
school children. It also assures that the title 
to any property constructed or purchased 
shall be in a public agency and that a public 
agency will administer the funds and prop-
erty for public educational purposes. 
According to the report of the Committee 
on Education and Labor, under the provision 
for library resources, textbooks and other aids 
available to all school children, the bill as-
sures that the funds "will not enure to the 
enrichment or benefit of any private institu-
tion" by the following: 
1. Library resources, textbooks and other 
instructional materials are to be made avail-
able to children and teachers and not to in-
stitutions. 
2. Such materials are made available on a 
loan basis only. 
3. Public authority must retain title and 
administrative control over such materials. 
4. Such material must be that approved 
for use by public school authority in the 
State. 
5. Books and material must not supplant 
those being provided children but must sup-
plement library resources, textbooks, and 
other instructional materials to assure that 
the legislation will furnish increased op-
portunities for Yearning. 
For the supplementary educational centers 
and services the grants are made to a public 
education agency, the property is in a public 
agency and the program is administered by 
the public agency. 
Question. Why is there such widespread 
belief that the new education bill gives aid 
to parochial schools, as well as to public 
schools? 
Answer. There are at least four clear 
reasons for this confusion. First, the bill 
approaches education aid on a new basis. It 
is a poverty bill as well as an education 
bill, and it is aimed at children rather than 
Institutions. This shift from the traditional 
thought patterns of education is not quickly 
made by those who have thought only of aid 
to schools. 
Second, the news media are not always pre-
cise in the language used in reporting. In 
efforts to simplify complicated matters and 
to shorten lengthy explanations it is easy to 
use misleading terminology. Such efforts 
have resulted in a misrepresentation of the 
bill In some instances. 
Third, some of those who are opposed to 
Federal aid to education have sought to use 
the religious issue to defeat the bill. When 
It was evident that all other tactics were fail-
ing, the opponents attempted to sidetrack it 
by the charge it provided aid to parochial 
schools. They did not succeed in convincing 
the religious leaders, the education leaders, 
or the political leaders of the Nation. 
Fourth, the administration of the act will 
require private schools to cooperate with 
public schools to some extent if their pupils 
are to receive their aids. In some instances 
they may create community tensions and 
abuses if either the school board or the 
private school interests press for undue ad-
vantage. 
Question. What has been the position of 
the Bapitist Joint Committee on Public Af-
fairs on the new education bill? 
Answer, The Baptist Joint Committee on 
Public Affairs neither endorses nor opposes 
Federal aid to education. Neither can nor 
does the committee attempt to speak for all 
Baptists on such issues. 
However, the Baptist agency played an im-
portant role in this legislation. From the 
first it was evident that Congress would pass 
an education bill this year. The problem 
was to get the best bill possible from a 
church-state viewpoint. The executive di-
rector of the committee, C. Emanuel Carlson, 
testified at hearings before the Senate and

here is deep doubt and =day about the 
oourSe We are taking. This is why he knows 
hat the ice is very thin. 
The popular doubt and anxiety have 
;yoked a great debate which Ought not to 
)e vulgarized and degraded by the use of 
pithets like dove and hawk. This debate 
.:annot be suspended while American policy 
Ls, as it is today, still unsettled and in the

provement in our policy.

saying that our war aim was that the North 
Vietnamese must "stop doing what they are 
doing," without specifying exactly what they 
must do or not do and what we would re-
gard as surncient proof they had done it. 
This was a deraancl for unconditional sur-
render, and it was far away from the Presi-
dent's Baltimore speech which offered, for 
the first time, "unconditional discussions." 
We have come a long way from the posi-
tion of 3 months ago when we said that we 
did not think there was anything to nego-
tiate about. For now the avowed purpose 
of our policy is to induce Hanoi to nego-
tiate. 
The debate, therefore, has not been in 
vain, and it must eontinue in order to clari-
fy our thinking about where and when and 
how we want to bring about a cease-fire, and 
What, in the ensuing negotiations, we hope 
to achieve in Indochina. We are still far 
from such a, clarification, even among the 
small circle of the President's principal ad-
visers, and obviously the country as a whole 
Is groping for information and for enlight-
ment 
As part of that debate, I should like to 
say something about a powerful and mov-
ing leading editorial in the Washington Post 
on Monday. It is called "Anguish of Power." 
Its theme is that once a nation has achieved 
great power, such as Great Britain did in 
the 19th century and as the United States 
has now, it "must live in anguish." For 
"no country can have great power and a 
quiet conscience," 
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown: 
No doubt it is true that great power and a 
quiet conspience do not easily or for long 
go together. Where I differ from the Wash-
ington Post is not about that. We cannot, 
and we should not if We could, return to the 
Isolation whic,h we practiced before the two 
World Wars, and, imagine that we are re-
turning to the age of our innocence. My 
thesis is that We must not make the mis-
take of jumping from isolationism into 
globalism, and that this is What the Wash-
ington Post is in_ fact saying we need to do. 
It is true that this country cannot admit 
disinterest in any crisis. But what this 
country must learn to do is to measure how 
much it can afford to intervene in any 
crisis, and  to distinguish between crises 
which effect its vital interests and those 
which do not. Great Britain _in the 19th 
century did not regard it as a duty to inter-
vene when a fire broke out?as, for example, 
in our 'Civil War, in the Franco-Prussian 
War, in the Balkan wars, in the Russo-Jap-
anese 'War. What I reject is the idea that 
because the United States must take an in-
terest when there is any breach of the peace, 
it must therefore bp the global policeman 
or, as the Washington Post puts it, the 
global fire department. 
A mature great power will make measured 
and limited use of its Tower. It will eschew 
' the theory of a global and universal duty 
which not only commits it to Unending wars 
of intervention but ?intoxicates its thinking 
With the illuslpP. that it is a crusader for 
righteousness, that each war 18 a war to end 
all war. 
Since in this generation we have become 
a great power, I am in favor of learning to 
behave like a ,great power, of getting rid of 
the glohalism which would not only en-
tangle us everywhere but is based on the 
totally vain notion that if we do not set the 
world in order, no matter what the price, we 
cannot live in the world safely. If we ex-
amine this idea thoroughly, we shall see 
that it is nothing but the old isolationism of 
our innocence in a new form. Then we 
thought we had to preserve our purity by 
withdrawal from the ugliness of great power 
politics. Now we sometimes talk as if we 
could preserve our purity only by policing 
the globe. But in the real world we shall 
have to learn to live as a great power which 
defends itself and makes its way among 
other great powers. 
[From the Washington Post, Apr. 26, 1965] 
ANGUISH OF POWER 
This administration, and no doubt its suc-
cessors far into the future, will have to deal 
with a deep-seated revulsion against the 
great power role of the United States. Now 
there is criticism of that role in South Viet-
nam; in subsequent crises It will be against 
the execution of a great power role in other 
areas. 
Those who express resentment at and op-
position to the employment of force in south-
east Asia include some of the country's 
foremost liberals and intellectuals as well as 
academic and campus leaders of lesser emi-
nence. Some of course oppose the policy on 
practical grounds. Some oppose it because 
of a belief that Chinese Communist power 
in the area is irresistible. Some are against 
it because they see it is an excessive com-
mitment to a, "Balkan" war that may weaken 
or divert forces needed in more important 
theaters of conflict. Some criticize it be-
cause they disagree as to the real national 
interest in the area. Some deplore it be-
cause they simply think we cannot achieve 
our objectives or carry out our commitments. 
The largest opposition, however, no doubt 
comes from those who instinctively rebel 
against this country's great power role. 
They oppose the burden of great power as 
many of the British opposed it for nearly 
300 years. But Great Britain for a long 
period could not escape the anguish that 
comes with the very possession of power. 
However large the crowds that gathered in 
Trafalgar Square to shout against the de-
cisions of successive ministries to commit 
British power in Africa and Asia and America 
(or against the failure to commit it) no 
Parliament could relieve Great Britain of 
the anguish of great power, no monarch 
could rescue it from the burdens that go 
with the possession of predominant force. 
It was not governments that the people op-
posed; but the fate that put into the hands 
of the leaders of one nation the leverage to 
influence the course of events and the des-
tiny of nations. 
And this is the real misery of the mighty. 
Once power descends upon a people it can 
no longer achieve national peace of mind, 
even if it can achieve peace in the sense of 
avoiding war. From the moment its power 
position is achieved, the nation must live in 
anguish. It must endure the anguish that 
attends the application of force, arising out 
of all the normal revulsions against the re-
sort to violence and against the imposition 
of pain and misery to achieve political re-
sults in a world where force or the use of 
force is the chief arbiter "of nations. Or it 
must endure the anguish that attends the 
failure to use force where its employment 
would work for the national salvation or the 
preservation of peace. No country can have 
great power and a quiet conscience. Its peo-
ple and its leaders must suffer either the 
reproaches of having used force or the re-
proaches for having failed to use it. Life 
alternates between, the miseries of Vietnamas 
and Munichs and is seldom free from one or 
the other. 
There is no Way a party or a President or 
a Congress can deliver a people from this 
discomfort. It was inescapable in the days 
of British power; it is more inevitable now 
when no crisis can be so remote or so little 
connected with the national interest that it 
can be simply overlooked. This country 
cannot admit disinterest in any crisis. It is 
vain to cry that Alabama is for Alabamians. 
Africa for Africans, Asia for Asians, America 
for Americans. We are influenced by every 
act of injustice and tyranny that takes place 
everywhere in the globe; and every act of 
tyranny and injustice that takes place here 
has its influence everywhere in the world. 
It is not one world in the happy sense that 
Wendell Willkie imsgined it; but it is one 
world, nevertheless. And its oneness is such 
that no one can light a fire anywhere in it 
but that the nation with the biggest fire 
department has to decide whether to use it 
or not to use it. And out of that choice 
enormous consequences for good or evil must 
flow. 
Such is our burden, such our plan, and 
such our anguish. When, as a people, we 
accept the fact that it is unavoidable and 
inescapable, the level of debate over what 
we should or should not do in each recur-
ring crisis will rise. Each of our decisions 
to use force or to fail to use force is filled 
with potential pain and injury for millions. 
This is the anguish that goes with great 
power. No one can deliver us from it. 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, on the 
subject of Vietnam and the President's 
press conference held yesterday, I should 
like to read into the RECORD headlines 
from three great eastern metropolitan 
daily newspapers, reflecting their views 
on the press conference, which views I 
am sure -too many readers take instead 
of reading the remainder of the news 
article. 
I would hope that the printer of the 
CONgRESSIONAL RECORD would feel that 
under the rules by which we operate, it 
might be appropriate to place headlines 
around these headlines. 
The first is from the Washington Post 
of today, and reads as follows: 
JOHNSON REAFFIRMS OFFER TO TALK PEACE 
INVITES DOUBTER NATIONS TO TEST 'US. 
SINCERITY 
The second headline is from this morn-
ing's Philadelphia Inquirer and reads as 
follows: 
JOHNSON DARES REDS TO TAKE VP PEACE 
OFFER, BARS WAR LETUP 
DEFENDS RAIDS, JABS AT CRITICS 
The third headline reporting on the 
same press conference, published in the 
New York Times, reads as follows: 
JOHNSON RENEWS BID ON VIETNAM; DEFENDS 
BOMBING 
REPEATS HIS OFFER TO CONFER WITH ANY 
GOVERNMENT WITHOUT CONDITIONS?PEACE 
HOPES STRESSED 
Mr. President, I ask the question: 
What newspapers do you read? 
I thank the Senator from Arkansas for 
his courtesy in yielding to me. 
DEATH OF EDWARD R. MURROW 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, 
"good night and good luck"?these were 
the words with which Edward R. Mur-
row concluded his radio and television 
program for more than 20 years. Born 
In the South, raised in the West, working 
In the East, he was truly all American. 
Ed Murrow's career was a unique one. 
It was a career based on a high regard

for honesty, modesty, integrity, and 
forthright reporting. It was a career 
underlined by courage, a keen sense of 
the truth, and the need of the American 
people to know the truth. Ed Murrow 
served the American people, first as their 
eyes and their ears, as their 'witness to 
events which shook the world?then as 
interpreter to the world of American pol-
icies and American life. It was this 
sense of duty and a desire to get the 
truth across which motivated Murrow 
to leave his high-paying position as 
newseaster and analyst and to accept 
the difficult and demanding challenge to 
be Director of the U. S. Information 
Agency, a position which offered one-
tenth his salary at CBS At USIA Ed 
Murrow made a great contribution. He 
worked tirelessly to upgrade the quality 
of our information program abroad and 
for some months he did it while fighting 
the early stages of lung cancer, 
Ed Murrow was forced to leave his 
Post at USIA last year. His fight had 
become his full-time job. It was, per-
haps, the only job he ever undertook in 
which he was unsuccessful. His own 
words serve best right now to express my 
feeling at the passing of Edward R. 
Murrow: "Good night?and good luck?
and thanks." 
TRIBUTE TO SENATOR OLIN D. 
JOHNSTON 
Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, 
the Postal Record, the official publica-
tion of the National Association of Letter 
Carriers, in its May 1965 issue has pub-
lished an editorial, written by the able 
president of the NALC, Jerome J. 
Keating, on the life of our late colleague, 
Senator Olin D. Johnston. I believe the 
editorial should be printed in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD, and I ask unanimous 
consent that that be done. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RscoaD, 
as follows: 
SENATOR OLIN D. JOHNSTON 
(Editorial, from Jerome J. Keating) 
Early Easter Sunday morning, my tele. 
phone rang; it was Bill Gulledge, staff di-
rector of the Senate Committee on Post 
Office and Civil Service. In tearchoked 
voice, he declared, "Our Senator is dead; 
he passed away at 4:21 this morning." 
Yes, "Our Senator is dead." If the letter 
carriers- of America ever had a Senator, it 
was the six-foot-three South Carolinian--
the Man with the big heart and the astute 
mind?the man who was responsible for more 
postal legislation than any man who had 
ever lived. 
Senator RALPH YARBOROUGH, Of Texas, said 
simply: "My staunchest friend in the Senate 
is gone." The letter carriers of America can 
well re-echo that sentiment. 
The Columbia, (S.C.) Record paid Senator 
Johnston a marvelous tribute: 
'Son of a tenant farmer and early in life 
a laborer in the textile mills of South Caro-
lina, Min Dewitt Johnston never forgot' his 
heritage. Throughout his long and colorful 
carter of service to State and Nation, the 
Senator never disremeMbered What it is like 
to be born with a pewter, rather than 6. silver 
spoon. He never forgot the little people of 
South Carolina. 
They Were his joy and his Strength. And 
he was their joy and their strength. 
"He knew and he understood, from first-
hand, the privations of the poor, the con-
stant struggle for survival of the textile 
worker, the pain of the Federal employee 
ignored by the sprawling bureaucracy, and 
the debilitating toil of the farmer patiently 
coercing a living out of Carolina soil. He 
knew. And these people knew that Olin 
Johnston knew?and cared. 
"Throughout his governmental service, 
whether as State representative, governor or 
'Senator, he championed the causes of the 
little people. Born to a tenant farm, nour-
ished in a textile mill, politically educated 
in the great depression, he became an ar-
dent New Dealer under Franklin Roosevelt 
and remained adamantly dedicated to its 
principles until his death. 
"In the Senate, he was a good party man?
one who knew the rules of 'the greatest club 
in the world,' understood its rules and played 
by its rules. He was universally respected. 
On his last visit to the Senate, he was warm-
ly welcomed by both sides of the aisle?
with words of genuine affection, concern and 
praise from men of widely separated political 
attitudes. 
"Today, South Carolinians paid due hom-
age to the Senator, as his body rested in 
state in the State House. Tomorrow, he will 
be buried in the upstate region that nur-
tured him. 
"And a Change has come over our State 
with his passing. No longer will the textile 
workers greet the tall, hulking figure with 
the deep voice who knew them by their 
Christian names. No longer will the people 
of the State see hint rise, shake his jowls and 
in characteristic southern speech intone, 
'My fellow South Carolinians.' 
"His fellow South Carolinians, who showed 
their esteem for the Senator by electing him 
to a series of offices matched by few in our 
history, will miss the big man from the 
Piedmont." 
The letter carriers will miss him; the 
Federal employees and the little people all 
over America will miss this wonderful man 
of great courage and determination. Alvin 
Haith, his letter carrier at Kensington, Md., 
traveled all the way from Kensington to at-
tend the funeral at Spartanburg. "You just 
don't know what your coming here means to 
me," declared Mrs. Gladys Johnston on see-
ing Carrier Haith. 
On Monday, the body of Senator OLIN D. 
Joilarsrow lay hi state in the beautiful old 
South Carolina Capitol, in the Capital city 
of the State where Senator JOHNSTON had 
served longer as Governor than any other 
man. He was the first man ever to lay in 
state in the capitol building. 
All day long a steady stream of people, 
young and old, well dreased and poorly 
dressed, people of all races, passed the bier. 
On the face of each was reflected signs of 
sorrow. Many, remembering some kind deed, 
wept openly. 
At 3:30 p.m., 50 Columbia letter carriers 
in uniform, led by Branch President Ray 
Lemmons, having completed their day's 
work, passed solemnly, soberly, and tearfully 
by the bier' of their great Champion. The 
loyal and falthfull Bill Johnston, the Sena-
tor's brother, who never left his side, greeted 
every one of them. 
'At 5:30 pin, the President of the United 
States and IVIrs. Johribon came to Columbia 
to console Mrs. Johnston and the Senator's 
family, and to pay their last respects to his 
long-time Senate colleague and his faithful 
supporter. Governor Donald Russell, in a 
few touching words, paid tribute to his 
friend. Chaplain George Mutze of the South 
Carolina State Senate prayed and offered 
spiritual consolation. The Capitol was 
crowded With mourners, and the people lined 
the steps outside. Many letter carriers from 
nearby towns hurried in to attend the serv-
ices in Columbia. 
Early Tuesday morning the body we 
taken to Spartanburg, to the church whet 
the Senator had long worshipped. The Vic 
President, and Mrs. Humphrey, headed 
large group of Senators who came from 
Washington to attend the funeral. Post 
master General John Gronouski and Deput 
Postmaster General Fred Helen accompanie( 
the Vice President and his party. TM 
State's congressional delegation and Stati 
officials were in the church; the main churel 
was packed with mourners; a second drape 
was crowded, and the steps to the church 
and sidewalk in front were filled with people 
who could not get in. Scattered through 
the reverent audience were many letter car-
riers from North and South Carolina. 
The Spartanburg Journal reported: "In-
side the church, floral wreaths from far and 
near were banked around the altar and two 
walls. In the lobby one simple wreath of 
red carnation.% yellow chrysanthemums, and 
Easter lilies in green fern stood out from the 
others. 
"It bore this message: 'Letter Carriers 
Branch 628, Spartanburg.' It was mute 
testimony to the popularity of the late Sen-
ator among letter carriers throughout the 
United States. He had served as chairman 
of the Senate Post Office Committee for years 
and, as such, wielded considerable influence 
In postal affairs." 
Following the funeral at the Southside 
Baptist Church, the body was taken to 
Hones Path, South Carolina, for interment. 
It was characteristic of the humility and 
faithfulness of the Johnstons that the body 
was returned to a little cemetery in the small 
community of Honea Path, where Senator 
Johnston had lived as a boy. 
A MARVELOUS CAREER 
The career of Senator Olin D. Johnston 
is indeed one to inspire hope and raise the 
ambition of every young man in America. 
Here was a boy, the son of a tenant farmer. 
At the age of 9, he started to work in the 
mill. He studied hard; graduated with a 
bachelor's degree; later secured a master's 
degree; and finally secured his law degree. 
Be was elected to the legislature, served as 
Governor of his State longer than any other 
man, and finally became U.S. Sena-
tor. In his senatorial campaigns, he was 
consistently opposed by the strongest candi-
dates in the State. In his last election he 
turned back the Governor of the State in the 
primary and defeated a strong Republican 
candidate in the general election. Ile never 
forgot the people, and they never forgot him. 
Senator Johnston served with the Rainbow 
Division in World War I. In college and in 
the service, he boxed as a heavyweight. In-
deed, he had a fighting heart--a man 68 years 
of age who survived two major operations 
within a period of 3 months, and was 
finally struck down by pneumonia, was in-
deed a man with a fighting heart. So en-
grossed in the Senate and his responsibilities 
was he that he returned to his senatorial tasks 
between operations. 
FRIEND OF THE POSTAL AND FEDERAL 
EMPLOYEES 
To me, the death of Senator Johnston is 
a great loss. A kindly man, he always had 
time for our problems. One citizen attend-
ing the Senator's funeral at Spartanburg told 
a reporter: "I was down on my luck; I went 
to Washington. Our other Senator was too 
busy to see me, but Senator Johnston saw 
me and took care of my problems." That 
was typical of this great Senator. 
Senator Olin D. Johnston came to Wash-
ington in 1945. I came to Washington ir 
1945. I have had the honor and privilege 
of associating with him during his entir( 
career in the Senate. One of the first major 
legislative efforts in which he was involve( 
was the 1948 amendments to the RetiremenA; 
Act. That was epoch-making legislation.

The Senator stood up like a trojan in the 
committee and on the floor of the Senate. 
He was a central figure in our national 
convention and in our meetings held in 
Washington. Frequently he was accom-
panied by his good wife Gladys, and on some 
occasions by his fine children. A convention 
was not a, convention without the Senator. 
Legislatively, he worked closely with Presi-
dent Doherty and myself, and, in more re-
cent years, with Vice President Radernacher 
as well, 
Without a doubt, he sponsored and guided 
More postal and Federal employee legisla-
tion through the Congress than any man 
Who had ever lived. The very last deed that 
he performed as a Member of the Senate was 
to introduce 5, 1667, a bill to transfer back 
to Congress the exclusive right to set rates on 
parcel post, 
The la,st increase for retirees enacted in 
1962 would not have become a law were it 
not for the Senator. The House had passed 
the pay bill, but the increase for annuitants 
was tied up in the Rules Committee. Sen-
ator Johnston amended the pay bill by at-
taching the annuity increase to it, and thus 
it became laW. 
Frequently during his career as chairman 
of the Senate committee, the astute Senator 
resorted to unusual strategy to secure the 
enactment of a bill. Legislation during the 
past 20 years in _the House has frequently 
been bottled up in the committees. Senator 
1/4Johhston would take a minor bill that had 
paSsed the House, amend it by adding the 
major bill to it, and the bill would then go to 
conference. 
The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, in a some-
times complimentary and sometimes critical 
editorial, commenting on his political suc-
cess, declared: "The overly frequent pay 
raises he got for the employees did not hurt 
either." 
The same editorial stated, "But it is safe 
to say that South Carolina has not had a 
more effective lawmaker in Washington in 
many years." 
Senator Johnston was kind, he never spoke 
harshly of anyone; he was an able legislator, 
Universally liked, most considerate, and a 
great champion of the postal employees. He 
will be missed and mourned. To his fine 
family?his faithful wife Gladys, his son 
Olin, Jr., his two lovely daughters Mrs. Sallie 
Scott and Elizabeth, we extend our most sin-
cere sympathy. 
Undoubtedly Senator A. S. (MIKE) MON-. 
RONEY will become chairman of the commit-
tee. He has worked closely with Senator 
Johnston, he is a good friend of the em-
ployees, and will closely parallel the policies 
of his predecessor. 
Gov. Donald Russell has stepped down 
from the governorship to assume the office of 
U.S. Senator. Suffice it to say, he was a 
close friend of Senator Olin D. Johnston. 
PEOPLE'S WAR IN VIETNAM 
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I invite 
the attention .of My colleagues, as well 
as of other readers of the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD, to a somewhat different and pro-
vocative viewpoint on the current 
struggle in Vietnam. Its expositor is 
Maj. Gen. Edward G. Lansdale, U.S. 
Air Force, retired, who as a result of 
several years' service in the Philippines 
and southeast Asia has earned the repu-
tation of being one of the most knowl-
edgeable Americans on the subject of 
Communist "wars of national liberation" 
and counterinsurgency. General Lans-
dale is presently a consultant to the staff 
of Food for Peace, at the White House. 
NO. 75-18 
General Lansdale does not question 
our presence in Vietnam, nor does he call 
for American withdrawal from Vietnam 
and southeast Asia. If anything, I think 
it is fair to say that he does not feel that 
we are involved as much as we should be 
in Vietnam. His principal criticism of 
our present policy in Vietnam is perhaps 
best summed up in the question: "Do we 
do something halfway: give a man a gun 
to defend himself, give him means to fill 
his belly, and let him shift for himself 
when it comes to realizing his great hope 
for man's liberty?" General Lansdale 
argues that the United States must help 
the Vietnamese arm themselves politi-
cally, as well as physically and materially. 
He cites as the major unused weapon of 
this "people's war" our ideology which is 
embodied in the opening paragraphs of 
the Declaration of Independence and the 
Bill of Rights. 
General Lansdale most recently ex-
pressed his viewpoint on Vietnam in a 
talk at the Principia Conference on Viet-
nam, in Elsah, Ill., on April 9, 1965. I 
ask unanimous consent that General 
Lansdale's interesting and stimulating 
address be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the address 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
TALK AT PRINCIPIA CONFERENCE ON VIETNAM, 
ELSAH, ILL. 
(By Edward G. Lansdale, major general, 
USAF, retired) 
It is time that you and I and other Amer-
icans become pragmatic about Vietnam. A 
truly pragmatic American would insist that 
we do today what will help us tomorrow. 
From this pragmatic viewpoint, we almost 
seem to have forgotten why we are in Viet-
nam. To be sure, we have said why. We 
have talked it up big. Some Americans even 
have talked it down big. Yet, the great chal-
lenge given the United States by events in 
Vietnam largely has gone unmet by practical 
or effective American deeds. 
Since this challenge won't go away, just 
because we duck accepting it, let us get it 
out into the open here and now, look at it 
hard, and then dare to consider meeting it. 
The great challenge given to us in Viet-
nam is political. Essentially, it is this: Can 
the Vietnamese win their freedom while they 
fail to agree on what freedom is?and fail to 
start governing themselves in a way that 
takes them toward that freedom? If they 
cannot, then should we Americans remain 
aloof from this political heart of the strug-
gle and confine our most generous and dedi-
cated help in Vietnam to military and socio-
economic assistance? Or rather, should we 
Americans give equally generous and dedi-
cated help to the Vietnamese in their heart-
felt longing to achieve ways to govern them-
selves, within their own truths and with a 
real degree of stability, while they set forth 
clearly the premise of the freedom they most 
desire for themselves? 
Put it another way, it can be said that our 
side in Vietnam outnumbers, outguns, and 
outspends the enemy. Shouldn't we now 
make -a real effort to outhink the enemy on 
the actual battleground among the people 
of Vietnam? This means helping the Viet-
namese find their own true cause to fight 
for, much more than helping them fight 
against something. Such positive, in con-
trast to negative, help could well include 
sympathetic encouragement and assistance 
8491 
in the step-by-step development of a repre-
sentative and responsive political system of 
Vietnamese origin. This would create some-
thing of their own to which the Vietnamese 
could pledge, willingly and freely, their lives, 
their fortunes, and their sacred honor. 
Such work would fill a gap which has 
been the despair of Vietnamese, Americans, 
and other free people in Vietnam. It would 
put the war upon a sound moral and political 
footing. Given true political meaning, the 
military, psychological, and economic ac-
tions used to win the moral goal would in-
crease a hundredfold in their effect on break-
ing the will of the enemy. A Vietnamese 
cause, with an attainable national goal 
closest to the hearts of the overwhelming 
majority of the Vietnamese, would not only 
give the Vietnamese something worth every-
thing to defend. It also would be a goal 
desired even by those now under the control 
of Communist masters, one that would give 
them just cause to leave the ranks of the 
Communist and join their brothers on our 
side. This is true strategy for a "peoples' 
war" such as the Communists have sought 
to wage. It directly confronts the main 
weapon of the Communists?their political 
action?with a superior action of our. own. 
If we employ it truly, there is little doubt 
about victory for the cause of freedom. Fur-
ther, the struggle would be fought on the 
terms of freemen, not on those of the Com-
munists. 
This strategy deals with the hard inner 
core of the struggle in the world today, in 
Vietnam, in the so-called wars of national 
liberation elsewhere. The basic conflict is 
between the way we, the free, look at man 
and the way the Communists look at man. 
We see man as an individual, endowed by 
his Creator with "certain inalienable rights." 
The Communists see man as a cipher of the 
state, a materialist zero without a creator. 
So, what do we do in this basic conflict? Do 
we profess "self-evident truths" for ourselves 
alone? Do we permit the Communists to be-
guile, coerce, or otherwise rob a man of the 
true heritage we say he has, and let them 
make him a part of the Communist ma-
chine?while we keep silent about this true 
heritage, not help him come into it to the 
full extent of our ability? Do we do some-
thing halfway: give a man a gun to defend 
himself, give him means to fill his belly, and 
let him shift for himself when it comes to 
realizing his great hope for man's liberty? I 
don't believe we can do only this and still 
maintain our own freedom, strong and hon-
est and lasting. 
Now, this challenge has come to us at a 
moment of history. We should recognize 
that man's history is full of political chal-
lenges which were met by the world's lead-
ing power in each era. The challenges were 
met to keep the peace, as the leading power 
defined that peace. The great khans, Alex-
ander, Tamerlane, Rome, Spain, and Britain 
all had their time of leadership and of keep-
ing the peace, their style. Along with mili-
tary strength which gained and enforced 
their leadership, along with economic meas-
ures which gave it commercial meaning, 
there also was political action by the leading 
power, to provide his means of control. Our 
name for this political action is "colonial-
ism." The world leader in the past simply 
made colonies out of lands and peoples 
ab-:oad, imposing upon them political sys-
tems, laws, language, modes of justice that 
were his own. 
Today, the United States finds itself in 
the position of being the world's leading 
power. Yet, we Americans are opposed to 
colonialism and colonial methods for many 
reasons, including the fact that we too were 
once a colony and rebelled against_ the con-
cept. Lyndon Johnson, with his gift for

8492 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD SENATE Apra 28, 1965 
censensus, expressed out national feelings 
well in his inaugural address last January. 
The President said: "Our Nation's course 
is abundantly clear. We aspire to nothing 
that belongs to others. We seek no dominion 
over our fellow man, but man's dominion 
over tyranny and misery." 
However, at this moment a man's his-
tory, we are not alone in the world. There 
are two Communist powers, the Soviet un-
ion and China, who singly and jointly chal-
lenge our world leadership. On their part, 
they are quite brazen about using political 
action to gain control of other natiOns. They 
use a form of old power play, the old Co-
lonialism, in modern dress. A mention of 
Hungary and Tibet will make this point. 
These once-independent cotmtries, con-
quered by neighboring Communists and made 
into satellites, tried to gain independence 
in much the same way as the American col-
onies did in 1776. The stamping out of 
these recent revolutions by foreigl1 troops 
under the Communists were plain acts of 
colonial imperialism in the ugliest historic 
sense. Further, the expansion of the Commu-
nist empire has been an active fact of life 
in our time. For example, back when many 
of today's faculty members were students 
themselves, just before the outbreak of 
World War II, there were a little less than 
200 Million people under direct Commu-
nist rtile. Today, the number of people un-
der direct Communist rule has grown to 
almost 1,100 million people. (In contrast, 
people on our side, clearly committed to the 
cause of freedom, number some 752 million. 
This doesn't count many millions in Africa, 
India, the United Arab Republic, and Indo-
nesia whose politics await the future.) 
While the original Communist takeovers 
of Hungary, Tibet, and several other coun-
tries were plain conquests by use of con-
vential military force, the current meth-
ods of Con-animist expansion are more sub-
tle. They entitle these methods as "wars 
of national liberation." We see them as 
"Communist subversive insurgency." Viet-
nam Is today's most active example. 
In the Asian method of Communist slab-
versive insurgency, a national liberation po-
litical group is established at a remote base. 
This political group is given the image of 
a people's movement by naming members 
Who allegedly represent big sectors of the na-
tional population?the farmers, the youth, 
the women, the workers, the students, and 
so on. Added to the political cadres are 
military cadres who are specialists in guer-
rilla warfare, and who will build a mili-
tary apparatus upon the political footing 
provided by the political cadres. The "re-
mote base" where this starts coming out in 
the open usually means a camp located far 
enough from centers of population to avoid 
irameditite detection or access by the coun-
try's forces of law and order 
This political-raiiltary force then acts to 
gain centrol of the people on the land, by 
attraction or coercion as required. It is a 
step-by-step operation, first in the villages 
Mad hamlets closest to the base, and then 
ever widening. Nuclei are sent to establish 
more bases, to start the same process in other 
regions. Secret agents are sent to infiltrate 
centers a population and government orga-
nffiations. The Asian Communist slogan 
which goes, "first the mountains, then the 
countryside, 'then the cities" is a good 
thumbnail description of the process. It is 
considerably different than the Soviet 
method of working with the proletariat in 
cities or of Soviet defensive partisan warfare 
Along With Selling nationaliStic goals], se-
lected fur the greatest local appeal, Asian 
Communists also act te destroy both the 
credibility and the instruments of the Mt-
tion's government among the local people. 
In brief, they act to create a momentary 
vacuum of anarchy, to permit them to fill 
this vacuum with their own governing appa-
ratus. The anarchy is created by destructive 
means: the character assassination Of na-
tional leaders by psychological means, isolat-
ing the countryside from the city by 
strangling lines of communication through 
ambushing and cutting highways and rail-
ways, provoking government forces into acts 
against the people (such aa hiding in villages 
and forcing the villagers to stay there while 
the Communists start a battle with govern-
ment forces, and the liquidation of local 
people representing authority?such as vil-
lage headmen, judges, public health and 
pnblic works officials, policemen, even 
schoolteachers, and at times the families of 
these people. Many thousands of such pub-
lic servants have been murdered by the Com-
munists in Vietnam. 
I suspect that Mao Tse Tung had a know-
ing look on his face when he told Edgar 
Snow recently that Americans seem to ignore 
-the decisive political fact that ? * gov-
ernments cut of from the masses could not 
win against wars of national liberation." 
Mao had a big hand in developing the cyni-
cal, brutal Asian Communist method of cut-
ting off the people from their government. 
The trouble is, this method has a big ap-
peal to ambitious people in a number of 
countries. /t has become quite an export 
item to the Western Hemisphere and Africa, 
where there are some would-be leaders eager 
to try it. As General Giap, the Communist 
military leader in Hanoi, said not long ago: 
"South Vietnam is the model of the national 
liberation movement of our time * * *. If 
the special warfare that the U.S. imperialists 
are testing in South Vietnam is overcome, 
this means that it can be defeated every-
where in the world." 
The foroes of freedom must be vigilant 
about this vital facet of Communist aotion. 
In Malaysia, Where Sukarno is trying to use 
this method his own way, the Malaysian 
Government has had a long, bitter experience 
in facing up to the challenge, from Commu-
nist guerrilla days. A recent warning by 
Dato Ghazall bin Sha.fie, who is Permanent 
Secretary to the Malaysian External Affairs 
Ministry, is worth noting. Dato Ghazali 
told the Malaysians: "It is the height of 
folly to assume that superior military exper-
tise and superior firepower alone are de-
cisive. To overlook the importance of po-
litical action is to miss the bus completely 
* * Malayan), will endure * * * so long as 
the national will, which is the active expres-
*ion of growing national unity, can with-
stand the pressures from within and with-
out * * *. There is no alternative. It is of 
paramount importance to anticipate ten-
sions and stresses wherever they are likely 
to appear between the people and the 
Government." 
Iv 
So far, then, I have pointed out that a great 
challenge exists for us in Vietnazn, have done 
my best to describe it, to tell how it came to 
be, and to sketch in the major pressures 
facing us. Now we reach the hard part. 
What do we want to do about it? What can 
we do about it? What is practical, feasible 
for the United States to do?within our own 
political heritage, within the talents of our 
people, within the goal of an honorably 
peaoeful world such as we seek? 
Noted journalists such as Joseph Kraft and 
C. L. Sulzberger have analyzed our U.S. orga-
nization and efforts in Vietnam and have 
concluded, in brief, that the United States 
does not have in Vietnam what it takes to 
meet the Communist political challenge 
there. Mr. Sulzberger wrote to the New York 
Times ft:ma Danang, Vietnam, in March: 
"Today, we acknowledge we have not found 
a formula to frustrate conununism's 
revolutionary warfare techniques as such. 
Our governmental social and military sys-
tems are not devised for this. Never having 
had an empire, we possess no large cadres 
of civil servants experienced in Asia. We 
Cannot dynamically export our ideology, 
which is not dynamic. And our wan:oak-
ing capacity is founded on highly technical 
equipment and strategy unsuited to guerrilla 
engagements." 
Assuming that there is some validity in 
such analyses, that we do not now have the 
people nor the organization in Vietnam to 
Meet the great political challenge given us, 
we rnust also assume that the challenge 
won't go away just because it is unmet by 
us. Military actions in North Vietnam, the 
most skillful diplomatic moves, mammoth 
economic development projects such as the 
one for the Mekong Basin?even if successful 
in stopping the Communists from waging 
guerrilla warfare hi South Vietnam and in 
giving a giant boost to the material well-
being of the people in the region?won't by 
themselves end the Communist revolution-
ary process among the people. Like the 
magical invisible clothing for the emperor, 
in the child's tale, no matter haw we say 
we see the problem, the central figure still 
remains naked. It is there. It is the truth 
we must faoe, sooner or later. 
Further, there at the heart of the chal-
lenge is that question of ideology. As an 
American who served the United States for 
many years in Asia?served, if you will, as a 
public servant not to an empire but to a 
democracy, and served long tours in areas 
of active Communist revolution?I can say 
flatly that our political beliefs, our ideology, 
are far more dynamic, far more appealing 
in Asia than anything the Communists can 
put forward. Every time we have given our 
fundamental principles a fair chance, have 
stayed true to them, have practiced what 
what we preached, our ideology has licked 
the Communists hands down. I have seen 
this happen. on the spot at critical moments 
of history. If the Communists are beating 
us in Vietnam on so basic an issue, then I 
must join Dato Gh.azali of Malaysia and say 
we are missing the bus completely. 
One of our difficulties is that we confuse 
ourselves when we talk about politics, politi-
cal action, and ideology once we leave our 
own shores. Different Arnericaias define these 
wards differently, when abroad. Yet, our 
basic political beliefs are set forth plainly 
and interpretation really rests on the courage 
of our convictions. Our basic political be-
liefs are there, for all to read, in the opening 
paragraphs a the Declaration of Independ-
ence, as followed by specific guidance in our 
Bill of Rights. We have, in these, a great 
promise coupled with its principled guidance. 
They form an ideology of dynamic universal-
ity, as alive today as When, conceived, and 
close to the hearts of men of good will 
throughout the world. Although our expres-
sion of higher human concepts grew out of 
our own Graeco-Judaic-Christian back-
ground, the ethics expressed are in close 
harmony with the great teachings of Asia, 
including Confucianism. It passes under-
standing why any American tries to put this 
ideology of ours on the shelf, unused, in the 
face of an admittedly Godless, a dialectical 
materialism, and, instead, substitutes a ma-
terialism of our own to meet the thrust of 
communism in dubious battle. This is wag-
ing war on grounds of our enemy's choosing, 
when we could be in our true place, fighting 
the good fight of our own choosing. 
Too often, American political action abroad 
is seen as being limited to diplomatic nego-
tiations between governments, or promoting 
the pro forma copying of parliamentary de-
mocracy in the image of the United States, 
or in a sort of self-righteous scolding of 
foreign leaders for behavior riot conforming 
to our idea of what it should be, or even in 
charting how a native bureaucracy should 
work in an unwitting adherence to Parkin-
son's Law. We ourselves are to blame. We 
have not assigned the mission for true Amer-
ican political work abroad to any of our Gov-
ernment services, nor have trained any of our

. AN ENGLISH VIEW 
IL Mr. President, all the 
evidence which comes from the Afro-
Asian world bears one lesson for us: that 
the white Western powers must learn to 
play a new, nonmilitary role in that area. 
This advice applies to the European 
countries, as well as to the United States. 
In an article which was published in 
the highly respected English newspaper, 
The Guardian, Patrick Keatley reported 
that Western military intervention in 
that area only serves to benefit the cause 
of the Communist Chinese. In his 
article, Mr. Keatley summarized the 
Afro-Asian viewpoint as follows: 
The era, for a Western military presence is 
past, though there are _still Afro-Asian lead-
ers who have not absorbed the lesson. Now 
is an era, not.for TanUnies, but for teachers 
and technicians; not for bombs and bases, 
but for b041aS and b14841.easmen-
Mr. Keatley concluded: 
In the Afro-Asia of 1965, the wisest rule for 
those heading east of Suez bearing burdens 
is that they should not be in 'uniform and 
not carrying guns. It is a lesson that 
Andrei Gromyko and Charles de Gaulle have 
both quite eVidently learned. 
I ask unanimous consent that this 
article be printed at this point in the 
FtECORD. 
"Representing the American Historical 
Association. 
'Representing the American Political Sci-
ence Association. 
Representing the American Society of In-
ternational LaW. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
KIPLING% COUNSEL 
(By Patrick Keatley) 
"Pan-Africanism has neither army nor 
budget."?Sir ROY WELENSKY. 
"We must give active support to the na-
tional independence movements in Asia, 
Africa, and Latin America; to the righteous 
struggle in all countries throughout the 
world."?MAo TSE-TUNG. 
There is a world of wisdom to be gained 
from the verbal confrontation above. The 
pathetic thing is that Rhodesia's fallen leader 
made his cynical assertion as recently as 
December 1962, during a congratulatory ban-
quet in Johannesburg; whereas Chairman 
Mao had already spoken his prophetic warn-
ing in Peiping 6 years earlier. 
And the single, stunning political fact of 
the world of Afro-Asia today is that national-
ism. no longer lacks for budget nor battalions. 
This is the thing that strikes the Western 
visitor now who journeys east or south of 
Suez. Indeed, Sir Roy Welensky was already 
out of data (not for the first time) when he 
made that remark 2 years ago, though the 
process of boosting Afro-Asian firepower with 
Moscow muscle and Peiping potency has ac-
celerated since then. 
This is not to rejoice at his discomfiture, 
for I do not. Nor am I one of those who 
applaud with silent satisfaction at each new 
diplomatic success in Afro-Asia by China or 
the Soviet Union. It is just that as ah ob-
server, traveling in those lands today, I am 
bound?in spite of a private faith in liberal 
capitalism?to recognize and report blunt 
facts. And the basic fact is that the white 
man has, today, largely lost the diplomatic 
initiative. 
This applies to the Russians almost as 
much as ourselves and, if Peiping overplays 
its hand, it will apply to the Han dynasts 
too. There is a world of feeling in the 
sharp comment of President Ben Bella when 
he said recently that he will not tolerate that 
"at any price Algeria should become the 
pawn in a dispute which seems to us, at the 
very least, infuriating." 
That observation came not long after Mr. 
Chou En-lai had wound up a Pan-African 
tour with the remark that "Africa today is 
ripe for revolution." So there is a certain 
caution in the " back of the mind of any 
African leader when he negotiates with Mr. 
Ho Ying in Dar, Mr. Wang Yu Tien in 
Nairobi, or any of the other able ambassa-
dors that People's China has assigned in the 
past 5 years to the 16 new diphinaatic mis-
sions she has opened on that continent. 
(Six more will be operating before the Sec-
ond Afro-Asian Conference opens on June 29 
in Algiers.) 
But the thing that drives the Afro-Asian 
nationalist straight into the able, avuncular 
arms of Mr. Ho and Mr. Wang is when we in 
the West give way to an atavistic reflex that 
dates from Bismarck and Canning and the 
Congress of Vienna. Instinctively, like 
aging circus horses going into a familiar 
rountine, we have one instant reaction when 
we hear the thump of the Afro-Asian na-
tionalist drum; alert aircraft/send soldiers/ 
build bases. The harvest of headlines?as I 
saw them recently in the press of India and 
Pakistan?makes curious, outdated reading 
east of Suez: Airlift from Lynehatn, RAP 
Rakes Harib, Greenjackets Go In, 
HEADY W12,TE . 
.These headlines may come as heady wine 
to some diehards at Westminster but there 
is only one other place where they can con-
ceivably be received with satisfaction. That 
is in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 
Peiping where Mr. Wang?now in Nairobi?
was until recenity director of the West Asia 
and African pepartment, 
The thing was put most vividly to me by 
the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Dr. Suban-
drio, when we met by chance in the plane 
from Lahore to Karachi just over a fortnight 
ago. We were introduced by Pakistan's For-
eign Minister, Mr. Zulfikar Bhutto, his host 
for the political mission then in progress. 
(This has since been followed by a trade 
mission and a handsome loan, at low interest, 
to help Indonesia buy nonmilitary goods 
in Pakistan) . Mr. Bhutto, having made it 
clear that his country values its .Common-
wealth links with Britain and with Malaysia, 
then prompted his guest to speak. 
What Dr. Subandrio had to say took some 
time, but in sum it came to the simple point 
that "We don't want British bases in Asia and 
we don't want white men in uniform on 
Asian soil." I started to argue the Malaysian 
case, pointing out that Tunku Abdul Rah-
man had negotiated the Singapore bases 
and the Anglo-Australian-New Zealand troop 
commitments as prime minister of a state 
that had?at the time of the 1963 London 
conference?been sovereign for 6 years. 
But Dr. Subandrio'S basic point was sim-
ple and he came back to it with Asian ob-
duracy: whatever the reasons, these are sim-
ply the soldiers of a European colonial power 
on Asian soil; and the concept is politically 
out of date and emotionally unacceptable in 
the Asia of 1965. He did not want in stress 
the racial element, which was for him clearly 
a distasteful argument to employ. But it 
came through just the same, and when Mr. 
Bhutto joined in the conversation at the 
end (having carefully remained out of it so 
that I should hear the undiluted Indonesian 
case) the Afro-Asian view was summed up 
for me by the two Foreign Ministers this 
way: 
"The era for a Western military presence 
is past, though there are still Afro-Asian 
leaders who have not absorbed the lesson. 
Now is an era, not for Tommies but for 
teachers and technicians; not for bombs 
and bases but for books and businessmen." 
The same thought has been expressed in 
the past few days by the Vice President of 
Kenya, Mr. Oginga Odinga, who can hardly 
be described as a friend of the West and has 
spent many weeks in Peiping in the course 
of half a dozen visits since 1960. On a per-
sonal plane, he and I clash ideologically each 
time we meet. Yet I readily concede that he 
is a master politician, for he has an uncanny 
"nous" for sensing the pulse of the new 
Afro-Asia. 
This week the news came out that Britain's 
new foreign secretary, Mr. Michael Stewart, 
had submitted to his fellow ministers at the 
Western European Union meeting In Rome 
a confidential analysis of Communist diplo-
matic penetration in Africa. Twenty-four 
hours later tilts produced from Nairobi this 
reaction from Mr. Odinga: 
"During colonial days imperialist powers 
enjoyed the right to defend their ideological 
interests on Africa's soil. They still appear 
to retain that colonial mentality and con-
tinue to assume their activities cannot be 
checked." 
One thing is certain to me: regardless of 
any private reservations President Kenkatta 
may feel about Mr. Odinga, when it comes to 
this sort of hot gospel of the new Afro-
Asianism he certainly may not be checked. 
VIGOROUS POLICY 
But let me bring forward two authentically 
conservative voices to buttress my case. Mr. 
Bhutto is foreign minister of a regime which 
follows a vigorous economic policy favoring 
private enterprise as against the state. Yet 
on Afro-Asia he sounds like all the rest: 
"The desire for solidarity is rooted in our 
general experience of colonialism and im-
perialism, with all the resultant indignities 
and exploitation. When nations emerging 
from foreign domination get together to pro-
Mote the liberation of countries still sub-

jest to external control, It should net be re-
garded as merely negative unity but as a 
positive, moral force for human dignity and 
freedom." 
My Second authority is that other Asian 
conservative, Rudyard Kipling: 
"Take up the White Man's burden, 
and reap his old reward: 
The blame of those ye better, 
The hate of those ye guard." 
In the Afro-Asia of 1965, the wisest rule 
for those heading east of Suez bearing bur-
dens is that they should not be in uniform 
and not carrying guns. It is a lesson that 
Andrei Gromyko and Charles de Gaulle have 
both quite evidently learned. 
COLD WAR GI BILL ESSENTIAL FOR 
BETTER EDUCATED AMERICA 
Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, 
the 88th Congress has been referred to 
as "education Congress," and the 89th 
Congress has earned itself credit for 
passing the Elementary and Secondard 
Education Act, this year. 
However, before we can be assured of 
a better educated America, it is essential 
that we do not neglect any group of citi-
zens who require an education in order 
to advance themselves in our society. 
Recently, I received from Private John 
F. Maxwell a letter in which he states 
that most servicemen planning to reenter 
civilian life require further education 
If they are to compete in our society. 
To illustrate the need for assistance 
through the cold war GI bill, to these 
cold war veterans, I ask unanimous con-
sent that Private Maxwell's letter be 
printed at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the letter 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
FXBRUARY 26, 1965. 
Senator RALPH YARBOROUGH, 
V.S. Senate, 
Washington, D.C. 
IDEAS _Stiescort Yaasonerrcra: I have been 
reading about the GI bill you have intro-
duced into the Senate. I think that such a 
bill would be an asset to the strength and 
freedom af our country. 
As a soldier myself, I know some of the 
feelings of anxiety and worry of the return to 
civilian life. Upon reentering civilianhood, 
aiol,ig with thousands of others, face the 
problems of finishing an education. 
I believe that if this bill is passed, it will 
encourage many people to finish their edu-
cations. Most soldiers planning on regaining 
their civilian status understand and 
acknoWledge the need of a good education to 
be better able to cope with the competition 
that exists in our society of free enterprise. 
A program of this nature would more than 
,repay its expenses, not only financially, but, 
also, in ways not measurable in money. 
This bill would lead to a greater, better-
ethiCated America. An America that will not 
be pushed not atvayed in this unpredictable 
age in which we live. 
I want to congratulate you on an excellent

GARDNER JACKSON 
Mr. GRUENING. TVIr. President a 
little over a Week ago there died in Wash-
ington a man the like of whom America 
needs more?Gardner Jackson. 
"Pat,"as he was known affectiOnate-
ly by a wide circle of friends, was a 
crusader for fairness to the underdog, 
a vigilant sentry for often forlorn causes, 
a kindly, generous human being who 
spent his life in helping those of his fel-
low men who lacked the conventional 
supports which in America can often, 
but not always, be mobilized in behalf 
of the disadvantaged. 
"Pat's" range of interest was wide. It 
included the diversity of race, creed, 
color, national origins, of political, social 
and economic discrimination. He was a 
liberal in the generally accepted use of 
that label, which perhaps always needs 
definition. And so, while mobilizing, as 
a young newspaper reporter in Boston, a 
campaign for a fair trial for Sacco and 
Vanzetti, whose electrocution for a crime 
which it is now generally recognized they 
never committed?as the late Justice 
Frankfurter also stoutly maintained?
Gardner Jackson fought the attempted 
Communist penetration of the ranks of 
organized labor and suffered lifelong 
physical disabilities in consequence. 
Using much of his material inheritance 
in behalf of the victims of misfortune 
whom he sought to aid, he leaves to his 
family a priceless legacy of conspicuous 
courage, hopeful faith in his fellow men 
and of undeviating purpose to try to 
correct injustice. 
Gardner Jackson falls into the pre-
cious category of occasiOnal "movers and 
shakers" who, from the early days of our 
Republic, have risked contumely and ob-
loquy to carry out the promptings of their 
conscience and to seek to bring American 
life closer to its professions and ideals. 
"Pat" took the inevitable obstacles that 
his activities aroused in his stride, good 
humoredly, unpretentiously and without 
animus. His was a great soul. 
An excellent tribute to Gardner Jack-
son by historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. 
appears in the current?May 1?issue of 
the New Republic. I ask unanimous 
consent that it, an editorial from the 
Washington Post, and his obituary 
from the same paper be printed at the 
conclusion of my remarks. 
There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

GARDNER JACKSON, 1897-1965 
One of the notable figures of our times died 
in Washington on April 17. Gardner Jackson 
came from a wealthy railroad family in Colo-
rado; but he spent his life, and most of his 
fortune, in helping the submerged people of 
his day, the subsistence farmers, the share-
croppers, the migrant laborers, the unskilled 
workers, the braceros, the American Indians. 
He began as a student by defending President 
Alexander Meiklejohn against conservative 
attacks at Amherst. As a reporter on the 
Boston Globe, he organized the defense com-
mittee for Sacco and Vanzetti. In New Deal 
Washington, he constituted a one-man farm-
er-labor party and reform movement, 
whether he happened to base himself at the 
Department of Agriculture or the Senate Civil 
Liberties Committee, the CIO, or the Farmers 
Union. If he could get no one to work with 
him in combating the indignities of the 
world, he would cheerfully set out to do it 
by himself. 
April 28, 1965 
Because he cared so deeply about people 
and injustice, he forgot things other people 
cared about, like power, success, prestige, 
money. They used to say sometimes that the 
underdog had "Pat" Jackson on a leash; but 
his caring was not soft or undiscriminating. 
Nearly a quarter of a century ago, when I 
came to Washington in the first years of the 
war, "Pat" Jackson invited me to join a group 
of anti-Communist liberals in Government 
agencies who met regularly for dinner and 
discussion. His courage as labor reporter for 
PM in exposing communism in the unions 
at the height of the wartime alliance with 
Soviet Russia led a band of National Mari-
time Union thugs to set on him late one 
night in 1944, beating him unmercifully and 
blinding him in one eye. No doubt historians 
will be hard put to credit Gardner Jackson 
with specific achievements?though people in 
Washington, as they read about Secretary 
Wirtz' bracero campaign today, will remem-
ber that they first heard about Mexican mi-
grant labor from "Pat" Jackson 30 years ago; 
and this is true about many other things 
His was a humane and spontaneous faith, 
generous, and disorderly, and he quickened 
the lives of all who knew him. He seemed to 
know everybody in the America of his time?
from Meiklejohn, Robert Frost, and Stark 
Young in his undergraduate days through 
Felix Frankfurter, Reed Powell, and my 
father in Cambridge, John Dos Paso s and 
Edmund Wilson on Cape Cod, and Franklin 
and Eleanor Roosevelt, Henry Wallace, 
Francis Biddle, John L. Lewis, and James G. 
Patton, down to John F. Kennedy, for whom 
he worked in the Massachusetts senatorial 
campaign of 1952. 
With some of these people he came to a 
parting of the ways. But he valued and pre-
served the bonds of human affection. Not 
being devoid of human frailties, he always 
distinguished between the sinner and the sin. 
Those whose lives he enriched never forgot 
him. I remember that in the White House 
President Kennedy used to ask me from time 
to time what "Pat" Jackson was up to. Next 
to Pat's irrepressible humanism, the cheer-
less bureaucratized liberalism of later years, 
drilled in movements and tyrannized by slo-
gans, seemed a sad and dreary thing. Gard-
ner Jackson's everlasting strength was his 
perception that people mattered more than 
dogma, sympathy more than righteousness--
this and a rare humor and modesty about 
himself.

GARDNER JACKSON 
Gardner Jackson?he was Pat Jackson to 
everyone who knew him?represented an es-
sentially romantic and crusading tradition in 
journalism and in politics. The role of de-
tached observer was not for him. He was 
a part of all that he experienced, a pro-
foundly involved mover and participant. 
Thus, as a young newspaperman in Boston 
during the 1920s, he became involved in the 
Sacco-Vanzetti case and took a leading role 
in that bitter controversy. As a reporter in 
Washington during the earliest days of tht 
New Deal, he soon found himself caught 
up in the excitement of its reform's and di-
rectly engaged in its internal struggles 
The same course characterized his relations 
with the turmoil in the labor movement of 
the 1940s. 
To every cause with which he was con -? 
nected, Pat Jackson gave himself unstint-
ingly. He brought to all that he did an ex - 
traordinary exuberance and commitment, a 
sense of ardor and of passionate conviction. 
His death at 68 takes from the Washington 
scene a most colorful and attractive figure. 
If he belonged somewhat more to an exciting 
past than to the present, he belongs none the

tSSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE 8W1 
In 1960 Dr, Schnittker served as a con-
sultant to ?the Joint Economic Commit-
tee of 'Congress in, a study of American 
farm policy. In that report issued late 
In 1960, Dr. Schnittker worked closely 
with Dr. Walter Wilcox, the respected 
agricultural specialist of the Library of 
Congress, and with Dr. George Brandow, 
now the staff director of the National 
Commission on Food Marketing. This 
report again reaffirmed the importance 
of sound and responsible Government 
programs both to American farmers and 
to the national economy. 
In 1960 Dr. Schnittker also published 
through the Kansas Agricultural Experi-
ment Station an important report on 
Wheat programs, in which he examined 
the basic alternatives open to farmers 
and to the Congress for changes in the 
wheat program in the 1960's. 
In October of 1960 Senator John F. 
Kennedy asked Dr. Schnittker to serve 
as chairman of a task force to examine 
the wheat situation and to Make recom-
mendations to him after the election. 
This report was made to President Ken-
nedy after his inauguration. 
In May of 1961, Dr. Schnittker joined 
the Department of Agriculture as staff 
economist and worked closely with the 
Secretary and his staff in the develop-
ment of improved programs for the major 
commodities particularly feed grains and 
wheat. 
He has appeared many times before 
the Senate Committee on Agriculture and 
Forestry and other coipmittees of the 
Congress and has always been most help-
ful to Members of Congress. 
Over the last 2 years, Dr. Schnittker 
has also represented the Department of 
Agriculture and the U.S. Government in 
Connection with grain negotiations asso-
ciated with the Kennedy round of trade 
negotiations now underway in Geneva. 
Early this year, he spoke at the annual 
convention of the National Association of 
Wheat Growers in Portland, Oreg., on 
the critical importance of both continua-
tion of the wheat programs in this coun-
try and developments of export markets 
abroad. This was an excellent statement 
Of the crucial relationship between do-
mestic programs and trade relation-
ships. 
As a Senator from a wheat and feed 
grain producing State, I welcome Dr. 
Schnittker's elavation, for he is a scholar, 
a realist, and a dedicated friend of 
farmers. 
EDWARD R. MORROW 
Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. 
President, the passing, yesterday, of Ed-
ward R. Murrow was a tragic loss for his 
family, and was an overwhelming loss 
- for all the people of the United States. 
None of us will ever forget his broadcasts 
from England during the war. Millions 
of us sat by our radios regularly, waiting 
to hear his familiar voice saying, "This 
is London." 
Of course, I knew him by reputation 
from that time; and I came to know him 
personally while we served together in 
Ckovernment, Everything I had heard 
Was true; his integrity and his judgment 
earned him the highest respect of all who 
knew him. President Kennedy relied im-
plicitly on him. He made a major dif-
ference, not only in the USIA, but also 
In everything else he turned his hand to 
within the Government. His recommen-
dations and thoughts changed the course 
of American foreign policy more than 
once. He spoke very seldom, but when 
he did?in Cabinet meetings, in the Na-
tional Security Council, and in many of 
the committees of Government?he in-
evitably made sense, and was listened to 
by everyone. All of us who served with 
him had the greatest affection for him. 
For President Kennedy, he was, in a 
word, indispensable. 
I can think of nothing more appropri-
ate to describe Ed Murrow than the fol-
lowing excerpt from Shakespeare's 
"Julius Caesar": 
His life was gentle, and the elements 
So inird in him that Nature might stand up 
And say to all the world, "This was a man I" 
Mr. President, the tribute to Ed Mur-
row, written by James Reston, and pub-
lished today in the New York Times, is 
deeply moving and very appropriate. I 
ask unanimous consent that it be printed 
in the RECORD at the close of my remarks. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Apr. 28, 19651 
WASHINGTON: FAREWELL TO BROTHER En 
(By James Reston) 
WASHINGTON, April 27.?Edward R. Murrow 
lived long enough before he died this week 
to achieve the two great objectives of a re-
porter: He endured, survived, and reported 
the great story of his generation, and in the 
process he won the respect, admiration, and 
affection of his profession. 
The Second World War produced a great 
cast of characters, most of whom have been 
properly celebrated. Roosevelt, Churchill, 
and Stalin are gone. Chiang Kai-shek is now 
living in the shadow of continental China, 
which he once commanded, and only , De 
Gaulle of France retains power among that 
remarkable generation of political leaders 
formed in the struggle of the two World 
Wars. 
The great generals of that time too, like 
MacArthur and Rommel, have died or, like 
Eisenhower and Montgomery, have retired; 
but in addition to these there was in that 
war a vast company of important but minor 
characters who played critical roles. 
THE IRONY OP HISTORY 
History would not have been the same 
without them. They were the unknown 
scientists, like Merle Tuve, who invented 
the proximity fuse and helped win the air 
war, and chiefs of stag like Bedell Smith, 
and the Foreign Service officers like Chip 
Bohlen and Peter Loxley of Britain, and on 
the side, the Boswells of the story, like Ed 
Murrow of the Columbia Broadcasting Sys-
tem. 
It was odd of Ed to die this week at 57?
usually his timing was much better. He was 
born at the right time in North Carolina?
therefore he was around to understand the 
agony of the American South. He went 
west to the State of Washington as a stu-
dent and therefore understood the Ameri-
can empire beyond the Rockies; and he came 
east and stumbled into radio just at the 
moment when it became the most powerful 
instrument of communication within and be-
tween the continents. 
A REMARKABLE GROUP 
He was part of a remarkable company of 
reporters from the West; Eric Sevareid, Ed 
Morgan, Bill Costello, whom MUTTOW re-
cruited at CBS; Hedley Donovan and Phil 
Potter, out of Minnesota; Elmer Davis, Ernie 
Pyle, Tom Stokes, Bill Shirer, Raymond Clap-
per, Wallace Carroll, Webb Miller, Quentin 
Reynolds, Wally Deuel, the Mowrers, and 
many others, including his dearest friend, 
Raymond Gram Swing, who played such an 
important part in telling the story of the 
Old World's agony to America. 
"THIS IS LONDON" 
But Murrow was the one who was in Lon-
don at that remarkable period of the battle 
of Britain, when all the violence and sensi-
tivities of human life converged, and being 
sensitive and courageous himself, he gave the 
facts and conveyed the feeling and spirit of 
that time like nobody else. 
It is really surprising that he lived to be 
57. He was on the rooftops during the bomb-
ings of London, and in the bombers over the 
Ruhr, and on the convoys across the Atlantic 
from the beginning to the end of the battle. 
Janet Murrow, his lovely and faithful wife, 
and Casey, his son, never really knew where 
he was most of the time but somehow he 
survived. 
In the process, he became a symbol to his 
colleagues and a prominent public figure in 
his country, and there was something else 
about him that increased his influence. He 
had style. He was handsome. He dressed 
with that calculated conservative casualness 
that marked John Kennedy. He was not a 
good writer, but he talked in symbols and he 
did so with a voice of doom. 
It is no wonder that the British, who know 
something about the glory and tragedy of 
life, knighted him when they knew he was 
dying of cancer at the end. Their main hope 
in the darkest days of the German bombard-
ment of London was that the New World 
would somehow understand and come to the 
rescue of the Old, and if anybody made the 
New World understand, it was Murrow. 
THE RAT RACE 
He hated the commercial rat race of the 
television networks, and fought their em-
phasis on what he regarded as the frivolities 
rather than the great issues of life, and talked 
constantly of escaping back into the small 
college atmosphere from which he came. He 
never made it, and probably wouldn't have 
liked it if he had. 
Those who knew him best admired him 
most. He was a reporter of the old school 
and a performer of the new. In radio and 
television, only the memory of other people 
remains, and the memory of Ed Murrow will 
remain for a long time among people who re-
member the terrible and wonderful days of 
the Battle of Britain. 
SUCCESSFUL RAIL COMMUTER 
SERVICE 
Mr. DOUGLAS. Mr. President, dur-
ing recent years it has been the fashion 
of many railroads to bemoan their obli-
gations to continue passenger service, 
when they would rather devote their in-
vestments to the more lucrative pastime 
of hauling freight. Passengers, it has 
been repeated time and time again, can-
not be transported by rail at a profit. I 
always believed this premise was false; 
and now I am glad to report that it has 
been proven false. Airplanes have car-
ried passengers at a profit, and busses 
have carried passengers at a profit; and 
I believed that sincere management 
would enable railroads to carry pas-
sengers at a profit: 
The commuter problems in Chicago 
and Cook County are as severe as any 
that will be found in the world. While

851i2 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD --- SENATE April 28, 1965 
bringing passengers to and from work in 
the metropolitan area, the railroads com-
plained of revenue and operating losses 
Year after year. New expressways were 
constructed to meet the public demand 
for effective transportation facilities. 
Soon, these highways were enabling 
hundreds of thousands of commuters to 
drive into Chicago every day. But this 
resulted in the strangulation of the city's 
streets and parking lots. 
Recently, the Chicago and North West-
ern Railroad began a program of attack-
ing the railroad-commuter problem at 
its source; the railroad management. It 
brought in Ben W. Heineman as chair-
man, and Clyde J. Fitzpatrick as presi-
dent; and these two twisted the com-
pany's thinking around to where the 
considerations of the commuting public 
becanie paramount, rather than con-
tinuing under the old approach of giving 
the public what management thought 
the company could afford to give. 
The entire attitude of the company 
changed from commuter tolerance to 
commuter enthusiasm. The C. & N.W. 
proceeded to Put $50 million into new 
equipment designed specifically for com-
muter service. The bold gamble began 
to pay off; and in 1963, and again in 1964, 
the C. & N.W. operated its commuter 
service, using its new equipment, at a 
profit. This demonstrates the ability of 
railroads to operate this service at a pro-
fit. The story of the C. & N.W. encour-
ages other railroads to step into this 
breach. Profits can be made by operat-
ing rail service for commuters; all it 
takes is the proper company attitude. 
As Mr. Heineman put it: 
You can't have succesSful suburban ser-
vice without support, interest, attention, and 
devotion to top management. If top manage-
ment doesn't want it, it's not going to 
happen. 
In its April 5, 1965, edition, the St. 
Louis Post-Dispatch published an edi-
torial on the C. & N.W.'s progress in serv-
ing the commuter; and I ask that the 
editorial be printed at this point in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
a" follows: 
[From the St. Louis (Mo.) Post-Dispatch, 
Apr. 5, 1965] 
WHERE THE COMMUTER IS KING: CHICAGO 
PRODUCES SUCCESSFUL RAPID TRANSIT WITH 
GOOD MANAGEMENT, THOUGH PROBLEMS 
Loom 
Roaring toward Chicago at high speeds 
from six different directions every workday 
morning are strings of double deck com-
muter cars bearing the emblems of four 
different railroads. They are clean, well 
lighted, warm in Winter, cool in summer, and 
almost always on time. In their seats are 
perhaps the country's most contented rail-
road commuters. 
There are two basic reasons why railroad 
commuter service is so much better in sub-
urban Chicago. One is that most of the rail-
road Managements there desired to make it 
so, and had the money or Credit to imple-
ment their desires. 'The second is an en-
lightened public commission. 
To four of Chicago's six major commuter 
railroads, the conimuter is king. Together, 
the four have spent an aggregate 8100 mil-
lion in the past 10 years for modernization 
of suburban service. As a consequence they 
have held far more riders than the New 
York commuter lines. They have also cut 
or erased huge deficits, since newer equip-
ment reduces their costs. 
Most of these Chicago lines deal with a 
single State regulatory body, the Illinois 
Commerce Commission, which has re-
peatedly accepted railroad contentions that 
they deserve fare increases if they operate 
modern equipment. 
Until recently Chicago has had nothing 
like New York's celebrated parkway system, 
which dates back to the 1930's, and this, too, 
has helped. 
Now that expressway building in and 
around Chicago is in high gear, however, 
railroads are running into experiences simi-
lar to those that hit New York years ago. 
The Illinois Central's daily passenger total, 
for example, has plummeted from 67,000 in 
1957 to 46,000 today, with nearly half the 
decrease coming after the opening of a new 
expressway. For the same reason, the Chi-
cago, Rock Island & Pacific lost 10 percent of 
its passengers in 1963. When the Kennedy 
Expressway opened several years ago, the 
Chicago & North Western, perhaps the classic 
case of a successful suburban operation, lost 
7.3 percent of its passengers. 
At the time, the North Western had actu-
ally been making a slim profit from its com-
muter service. But after the expressway 
opened, it lost a combined $4 million in 1961 
and 1962 when passengers deserted the rail-
road for concrete. Operations were back in 
the black in 1963, though, to a tune of 8706,-
000?for a significant reason. 
Extensive highway building north of Chi-
cago had helped bring the demise of an elec-
tric interurban railway, the Chicago North 
Shore & Milwaukee. But when all the former 
North Shore passengers were turned loose, 
the highways became so jammed that the 
North Western added Customers. It now car-
ries 72,000, up from 62,000 a decade ago. 
Many in Chicago fear that as such changes 
occur a lack of foresight and overall plan-
ning may someday create the same problems 
for Chicago the New York lines now suffer 
from. 
Even with the relative success of the Chi-
cago railroads, there are problems that could 
halt the system in the future, says one top 
official. "Public bodies react only to crisis," 
he points out. "Thus," he says, "there has 
been no comprehensive transportation plan 
completed to produce an integrated system 
of expressways, rapid transit, and commuter 
lines. Unless there is this plan, in 10 or 15 
years we will find Chicago's favorable trans-
portation situation changing to unfavor-
able." 
For the time being, however, conditions are 
comparatively favorable. Take the case of 
the North Western. It was saddled with a 
$2,100,000 suburban deficit in 1957, when 
Chairman Ben W. Heineman and President 
Clyde J. Fitzpatrick spent their first year 
in control of the railroad. They concluded 
that the route to improvement lay in offering 
a first-class product. They first won the 
right to close 22 of 88 commuter stations; 
these were the stations closest to the city 
that were also being served by rapid transit 
lines. More importantly, they obtained a 24-
percent increase in fares, Heineman then 
persuaded the Metropolitan Life Insurance 
Co. to lend the road what finally amounted 
to $50 million to purchase new equipment. 
With the new equipment came two edicts: 
Trains would be run on time; commuters 
would be pampered. 
This gives another insight into the success 
of the C. & N.W.'s commuter service. "You 
can't have successful suburban service with-
out support, interest, attention, and devotion 
of top management," Heineman declares. "If 
top management doesn't want it, it's not 
going to happen," 
Two other moves, unusual for cominuter 
railroads, that Heineman instituted were a:n 
advertising campaign and special classes to 
teach conductors how to be polite. 
Since 1959, the North Western has spon-
sored radio helicopter traffic report programs, 
seeking out the_people it considers its prime 
potential c mers----motorists stalled in 
traffic. 
WAR IN SOUTHEAST ASIA?STATE-
MENTS BY SENATOR MANSFIELD 
AND SENATOR AIKEN 
Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, on April 
21, both the distinguished majority lead-
er, Senator MANSFIELD, and the respected 
dean of Senate Republicans, Senator 
AIKEN, made eloquent statements about 
the danger of an escalating war in 
southeast Asia. The applause from the 
galleries which greeted Senator AIKEN'S 
remarks represented a spontaneous dem-
onstration of the commonsense feeling 
of most Americans that the United 
States should not become involved in 
a major war on the Asian continent. In 
the April 22 issue of the New York Times, 
Arthur Krock had a fine article in 
which he praised Senators MANSFIELD, 
AIKEN, and FIMBRIGHT for the responsi-
ble manner in which they have fulfilled 
their constitutional duty respecting for-
eign affairs. 
The New York Times published a fine 
editorial on the same day. In its lead 
editorial, entitled " 'Descalation' Need-
ed," the Times commented: 
Bitterness and emotionalism are increas-
ingly entering the discussions on Vietnam in 
the United States. This is a deplorable de-
velopment, and so is the polarization of 
opinion in every country and between blocs 
of countries. It is as if the battle lines were 
being drawn all over the world?but for 
major war that need not and must not take 
place. 
President Johnson launched a very tenta-
tive but real peace offensive at Johns Hop-
kins. He has not yet given this policy 
enough time but the continued bombing; 
has tended to cast some doubt on the sin. 
cerity of the U.S. desire for negotiations. 
This is clearly a moment of crisis--for 
Vietnam, for the United States and for the 
world. Less bombing, not more, offers some 
hope of peace?without weakness of Amer - 
lean resolution. By taking such an attitude 
the United States would show strength as 
well as wisdom. 
I ask unanimous consent to have th3 
editorial and the article?both excel - 
lent?from the April 22 issue of the New 
York Times, printed at this point in th3 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
and the article were ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Apr. 22, 1965] 
"DESCALATION" NEEDED 
The war in Vietnam is to be "stepped up" 
Washington now says. In other words, the 
U.S. Government is going to continue to 
bomb, send in more Americans, spend more 
and commit more lives, money, destructive-
ness and power?and take more risk. In re-
turn, the hope is that Hanoi will act to 
curb the Vietcong guerrillas in South Vies-
nam, if it can, and will refrain from sendir.g 
in more men and arms and orders to the 
south. The hope also is that Peiping ar d 
Moscow will hold off from their own particu-
lar methods of escalation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 8503 
April. 28, 196 
Those who have all along feared that the 
course the war has been taking since early_ 
February would force the United States into 
an ever greater commitment, leading to ever 
greater danger to Asia and to the world, are 
unhappily being proved true prophets. 
Once a war begins, forces take over which 
seem beyond control. In Vietnam, on both 
sides, one step is leading?as if inexorably?
to another and then another. Continuance 
of the present process by the opposing forces 
could lead to catastrophe. 
Nothing is more important for Americans 
today than to face these hard truths before 
It is too late. And it is vital that the chan-
nels of communication, of opinion and of 
dissent be kept open?on the floor of Con-
gress, in the press, in the Country at large--
in the face of a growing tendency to ridicule 
or to denounce the opposition and to de-
mand unswerving support of further escala-
tion in the name of patriotism. 
Bitterness and emotionalism are increas-
ingly entering the discussions on Vietnam in 
the United gtaes. This is a deplorable de-
velopment, and so is the polarization of opin-
ion in every country and between blocs of 
countries. It is as if the battlelines were 
being drawn all over the world?but for a 
major war that need not and must not take 
place. 
President Johnson's offer of 'runconditional 
discussions" was a splendid move on the 
diplomatic/political front, in the effort to , 
achieve a peaceful solution of the quarrel. 
While it deserved a far better response from 
the other side than it has yet received, it 
did mark, as we have previously noted, a be-
ginning to an interchange among the com-
batants?subtle and indirect, but neverthe-
less a beginning. 
But the continued bombing of North Viet-
nam makes progress toward a peaceful settle-
ment?however far off it must necessarily 
be?more difficult rather than less, harder 
rather than easier. We think that as a fol-
lowup to the President's fine declaration in 
Baltimore, a descalation of the war is needed, 
rather than the escalation that we now see 
imminent. 
/t is p.t least worth the effort to see whether 
a scaling-down of the bombing might not 
evoke a corresponding scaling-down of North 
Vietnamese aggression in South Vietnam. 
The North Vietnames6 incidents in the South 
are easily measurable; if a diminution of 
American bombing of the North should lead 
to a miminution in the rate of incidents in 
the South, a major step would thereby be 
signaled toward the "unconditional discus-
sions" offered by the President. 
Of course there might be no such response 
at all; and if there were not, the bombing 
would be resumed. But at least a descalation 
such as we suggest would afford the oppor-
tunity to the other side of making a gesture 
toward peace without losing face. It might 
lead, ultimately, to a cease-fire and a truce. 
President Johnson launched a very tenta-
tive but real peace offensive at Johns Hopkins, 
He has not yet given this policy enough time 
but the continued bombing has tended to 
cast some doubt on the sincerity of the U.S. 
desire for negotiations. 
This is clearly a moment of crisis?for Viet-
nam, for the United States and for the world. 
Less bombing, not more, offers some hope for 
peace?without any weakness of American 
resolution. By taking such an attitude the 
United States would show strength as well as 
wisdom.

IN THE NATION: THF SENATE CN VIETNAAI 
(By Arthur Krock) 
WAam.NceroN, April 21.?On the initiative 
of its majority leader, MIELE MANSFIELD, the 
Senate today responsibly fulfilled the role 
assigned to it by the Constitution to advise 
the President on foreign affairs. 
Senator FULBRIGHT who, in his official ca-
pacity as chairman of the committee on 
which the Senate relies for guidance on these 
questions, has been subjected to unwar-
ranted abuse for stating as a mere hypothesis 
that "the prospects for discussions" looking 
to peace in southeast Asia "might be en-
hanced by a temporary cessation" by the 
United States of the military actions it is 
steadily escalating in the Vietnams. But, 
except for specific endorsement of what rm.-
BRIGHT plainly identified as only a specula-
tion, all the Senate speeches today were 
directed at the same objective, which MANS-
FIELD expressed as follows: 
APPLY/NG GENEVA PRINCIPLE 
It is of the utmost importance that the 
question of how to apply the principle of 
the Geneva agreement of 1954 be faced as 
soon as possible. * * * The longer this con-
frontation is put off, the more the people of 
North and South Vietnam pay for the, delay, 
and the more the likelihood that the present 
limited conflict will spread into a general war 
in Asia. 
His reference was to a proposal that the 
Geneva Conference be reconvened on the 
limited basis of producing an international 
guarantee of the neutrality of Vietnam's 
neighbor, Cambodia. "The need for a con-
frontation," he said, "on [this] situation in 
which none [the United States, Communist 
China, and the two Vietnams] is involved so 
directly may indeed be a preliminary to a 
separate and second confrontation on Viet-
nam in which the involvement of all is di-
rect." And though MANSFIELD extolled the 
President as one who has "grasped the prob-
lem fully," citing his call for "unconditional 
discussions with the object of restoring a 
decent and honorable peace," it was evident 
from remarks by Senators who praised MANS-
FIELD'S observations that they detected in 
these their own doubts of the wisdom of 
escalating U.S. military attacks on North 
Vietnam while there is the slightest possi-
bility of progress in the secret negotiations 
for reconvening a Geneva Conference on 
Cambodia. 
"While the talk goes on," said MANSFIELD, 
"the bloodshed also goes on. And the bleed-
ing is not being done in the capitals of the 
world. It is being done in the ricefields 
and the jungles of Vietnam" whose peas-
ants, in all probability, want peace and a 
minimum of contact with distant Saigon 
and distant Hanoi?not to speak of places of 
which they have scarcely heard about?Pei-
ping, Moscow, or Washington. This called 
attention to the officially inconvenient fact 
that the conflict is in part a civil war. 
CONFLICTING VIEWS 
Taking this from the inajority leader as his 
cue, Senator AIKEN protested that "it is diffi-
cult to see?except as an act of braggadocio?
what U.S. military leaders are trying to ac-
complish when they send 200 planes to de-
stroy one little bridge." But on the same 
day that the Senate was voicing its disturb-
ance over the policy of military escalation; 
Secretary of Defense McNamara was an-
nouncing its wide expansion, as agreed on 
at the Honolulu conference this week. This 
cdnflict of attitudes is the inevitable prod-
uct of the involvement into Which the U.S. 
Government has drifted in Vietnam. 
. . _ . 
The Senate today reflected its alarmed con-
viction that the time is everdue for ending 
the war in sutiaeast Asia, hopefully through 
the back door of guaranteed neutrality of 
Cambodia. But it has no magic formula 
for reconvening a Geneva Conference, now 
that the U.S.S.R. which proposed this has set 
preconditions it is aware the United States 
cannot possibly accept. And the close Presi-
dential relations of some of the sources of 
the hysterical attacks on Senator FULBRIGHT 
for speculating that a temporary halt of 
U.S. military actions against North Vietnam 
"might" be the best way to discover whether 
the aggressors are open to a reasonable 
and honorable settlement, suggest that this 
idea has no future in the administration. 
TO RESTORE PEACE 
President Johnson has more information 
than the Senate can possibly have for the 
alarm which MANSFIELD and others expressed 
on the floor. But the sole meaning to be 
read into Secretory McNamara's announce-
ment on the same day is that continued 
escalation of the Vietnam war on a steadily 
rising scale is our only policy for the resto-
ration of peace in southeast Asia. 
PRESIDENT JOHNSON IS THE BEST 
JUDGE OF WHEN STATE VISITS 
SHOULD OCCUR 
Mr. DOUGLAS. Mr. President, our 
Government's postponement of the state 
visits to this country by the Prime Min-
ister of India and the President of Pak-
istan has been unfairly criticized in this 
country and abroad. Frankly, I have 
been amazed at the lack of perspective 
on the part of those who have insti-
gated this criticism. The President of 
the United States has a tremendous bur-
den of responsibilities at all times; and 
at this particular time the international 
situation has made this burden greater 
than any man should have to bear. The 
President, moreover, is carrying out 
these responsibilities very well, with wis-
dom and courage. 
This ridiculous tempest over the ob-
viously necessary postponement of the 
state visits during this trying period is 
wholly unjustified. 
Mr. President, with a personal apology 
for its choice of adjectives, I ask unani-
mous consent that there be printed in 
the RECORD an editorial from the Wash-
ington Daily News of April 22. I strongly 
agree with its wish that our homegrown 
and overseas advisers?who do not have 
any of the President's burdens?would 
give more weight to how he does his job, 
and less to relatively minor points of eti-
quette. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the Washington Daily News, Apr. 22, 
1965] 
L.B.J. DOESN'T CLAIM To BE COUTII 
Some Nervous Nellie editorial writers and 
commentators, who think more of protocol 
than substance, are aflutter over President 
Johnson's request to the Prime Minister of 
India and the President of Pakistan to post-
pone their visits to the United States. 
A social?or a state?visit should be ar-
ranged at the convenience of both the guest 
and the host. 
If a host,. at a given time, has family prob-
lems, naturally he would prefer that a guest 
come later when the family crisis has passed, 
especially if the guest is someone who has a 
penchant for advising the host on how to 
handle family problems. 
It so happens that our President and our 
Congress are in the throes of decisions on 
foreign aid, in which India and Pakistan are 
involved to the tune of around a billion 
dollars. It also happens that we are involved 
in unpleasant difficulties in Vietnam, con-
cerning which the Indians and Pakistanis 
have differing ideas on how we should meet 
our responsibilities. We seem to be getting 
advice from lots of folks who do not share our 
responsibilities.

It is one thing for them to advise from 
their own far-off rostrums, and quite another 
for them to come inside our borders to launch 
their views. That might really have muddied 
congressional waters where foreign aid allot-
ments are supposed to be made on merit 
rather than emotional reaction. 
We wish some of our homegrown and over-
sea advisers on our President's manners 
would give a bit more weight to how he dots 
his job, and less to his etiquette. 
The gentleman from the Pedernales River 
will never balance a teacup on his knee to 
their satisfaction?but when not nibbled to 
distraction by their mincing criticism, he has 
demonstrated he is quite a hand at getting 
results. 
THE SECURITY TITLE GROUP AND 
E. CLAYTON CrENGRAS 
Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, Hart-
ford, Conn., has long been known as the 
Insurance capital of the Nation. The 
insurance industry .has benefited for 
years from the great leadership of E. 
Clayton Gengras, board chairman of the 
Security Insurance Group. 
The Security Insurance Group has just 
completed its move to Hartford, Conn. 
Thus, the Security Group becomes the 
26th insurance home office in the Greater 
Hartford area, and the 34th in the State 
of Connecticut. 
The Security Title Group is a con-
solidated group of five property and 
casualty companies and one life insur-
ance company: Security Connecticut Life 
Insurance Co., Security Insurance Co. of 
Hartford, New Amsterdam Casualty Co., 
United States Casualty Co., the Con-
necticut Indemnity Co., and the Fire 
and Casualty Insurance Co. of Connect-
icut. 
The group has over 1 million policy-
holders, and operates in all 50 States, 
with 30 branch offices in principal cities 
throughout the country. 
The group has 650 employees in its 
home office, 1,100 employees in its branch 
offices, and 6,000 agents throughout the 
country. 
The Hartford Times recently pub-
lished an excellent biography of Mr. 
Gengras and his dynamic operation. I 
ask unanimous consent that the article 
be printed at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the Hartford Times, Apr. 19, 1965] 
MOVER AND $HAKER IN INSURANCE?THE 
GENGRAS IMPACT 
E. Clayton Gengras, noted for his verve 
and drive in the business world, not only 
plays out this role, he also looks the part. 
This brown-eyed 56-year-old West Hart-
ford native is trim and agile and is well-
known among colleagues and executives as 
a man who uses little waste motion?he 
moves quickly, doesn't like long conferences, 
makes fast, on-the-spot decisions, hates 
organizational "deadwood." 
These qualities have put him to good 
stead in many business ventures, and his 
movement into the insurance industry is no 
exception. The Gengras "touch" has marked 
him as one of the few men who has ven-
tured to demonstrate that the same prin-
ciples can be applied to an intangible prod-
uct?insurance?as to a tangible one. 
SALES ORIENTED 
Mr. Gengras and the executives around 
him are sales-oriented since this son of a 
West Hartford dentist, starting on the 
ground floor in the automobile business with 
a job in a garage in the midtwenties, early 
gained success as a salesman, first of the 
celebrated Stutz, and then, in 1931, of Fords. 
In 1937, he opened a Ford agency in West 
Hartford, and married Elizabeth Hutchins. 
His business grew almost as quickly as did 
his family, eventually adding Ford dealer-
ships in Hartford, Providence, R.I., and 
Queens, and the Lincoln distributorship for 
all of Connecticut except Fairfield County. 
During _World War II, he held his business 
together in large part by selling to priority-
rated customers cars from the large inven-
tory he had when civilian production ended. 
WAR YEARS 
In 1942, Mr. Gengras bought the Dauntless 
Shipyard in Essex. Conn., where 350 Coast 
Guard training ships were built. He then 
founded the Clayton Manufacturing Co., 
which, under Government contract, did over-
sea crating and packing and built gliders. 
In 1945, he sold the shipyard, disolved Clay-
ton Manufacturing and went back to auto-
mobiles. 
It was not until 1950 that he entered the 
insurance field. Two years earlier, he had 
established Connecticut Acceptance, Inc., an 
auto financing company. Wanting to in-
sure his financing deals, too, he bought the 
Fire & Casualty Insurance Co., of Connect-
icut. 
Mr. Gengras took his second step into the 
insurance field in 1953, when a patient of his 
father's approached him with an offer of 
50,000 shares, at $60 each, of the National 
Fire Insurance Co. of Hartford. 
NATIONAL 
Though he did not buy the offered stock, 
Mr. Gengras became a National Fire director 
and finance committee member. He later 
became a major stockholder. In 1956, the 
company was merged with the Continental 
Casualty Co. of Chicago. 
He bought 35 percent of the Security 
Group's stock in 1957. The group was then 
made up of the Security Insurance Co. of 
New Haven, the Connecticut Indemnity Co. 
and the Security-Connecticut Life Insurance 
Co. 
The next year Security bought Mr. Gen-
gras' Fire & Casualty Co. In 1960, Secu-
rity acquired the Founders Insurance Co. 
of Los Angeles in an exchange of stock. 
The next year, the New Amsterdam 
Casualty Co. of Baltimore and its wholly 
owned subsidiary, the United States Casualty 
Co. of New York became the sixth and 
seventh members, but not without a fight 
with a major underwriter, the Home In-
surance Co. 
NEW AMSTERDAM 
New Amsterdam's staff was reduced from 
2,400 to 1,400 employees, and operations were 
centralized in the Baltimore office. Its New 
York buildings were sold, through their man-
ager, to the Home. Similarly, Mr. Gengras 
had reduced by half the Security Group's 
New Haven staff of 800. 
After several years in New Haven and 
Baltimore upgrading and reorganizing opera-
tions came what has been a milestone for 
Mr. Gengras, the climactic move to Hart-
ford. 
As' he said in an announcement of the 
move last May before top business leaders 
at the Greater Hartford Chamber of Com-
merce, "It's nice to be back home." 
This Hartford area native has overcome 
initial scorn by aggressive renovations in the 
insurance industry. Among his techniques: 
Expansion through acquisition of estab-
lished companies and cost-cutting central-
ization of operations. 
Stressing of incentive payments (rather 
than high initial commissions) for agents, 
resulting in higher sales. 
Highly selective risk coverages (for better 
underwriting profits), and quick settlement 
of claims. 
JOSEPH KRAFT ON VIETNAM 
Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, during 
the current Vietnam crisis, the articles 
written by Joseph Kraft have been 
among the best which have appeared. 
His article entitled "General War Held 
a Real Threat" was particularly out--
standing. Mr. Kraft maintains that the 
time to try to achieve a negotiated set-
tlement in Vietnam is now, before the 
major Communist powers are drawn into 
Southeast Asia. Mr. Kraft aptly con-
cludes his article in this way: 
Once the Chinese enter North Vietnam in 
large numbers, the prospects for settlement 
go down to zero. 
What has happened, in sum, is that the 
Russians and Chinese, once holding back, 
are now competing to help Hanoi. In these 
circumstances, the deeper the Americans 
become engaged, the deeper the Russians 
and Chinese will become engaged. Instead 
of a merely hypothetical possibility, the 
spread of the limited conflict in Vietnam 
to a more general war has become a real 
threat. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ar-
ticle, which was published in the April 
23 issue of the Washington Evening Star, 
be printed at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the REcosn, 
as follows: 
GENERAL WAR HELD A REAL THREAT 
(By Joseph Kraft) 
Washington is now approaching a point 
of no return in Vietnam. Diverse, though 
vague, possibilities for negotiations exist. 
But the logic of the war effort?the supposed 
military necessity?is pushing this country 
toward measures that would certainly com-
promise immediate prospects for settlement, 
and possibly plunge the United States into 
an endless war on the Asian mainland. 
The hopes for settlement arise from two 
principal documents?the President's April 7 
speech in Baltimore?and the four-point res-
olution of the North Vietnamese Assembly 
on April 10. The statements come from the 
highest, most responsible authority in each 
county. Both were measured and careful In 
tone. At least in words, they expressed a 
surprising amount of agreement. 
Both countries are agreed that there need 
be no preconditions before discussion can 
get underway. Both call for a return to the 
Geneva Treaty of 1954. Both imply free 
choice for South Vietnam in picking its own 
regime and on the matter of unification with 
the north. Both look toward the eventual 
withdrawal of American troops. 
To be sure, there are two important points 
of disagreement. One involves the rebels in 
the south, the so-called Vietcong. Washing-
ton has tended to exclude them from any 
approach to the conference table; Hanoi in-
sists on their participation. 
But that is a juridical issue, open to many 
different formulas of compromise, and thus 
one that could usefully be discussed. For 
that purpose, an immediate occasion is at 
hand. It lies in the proposal by Britain and 
the Soviet Union, as cochairman of the 
Geneva powers, to convoke the signatories 
in order to consider a complaint from Cam-
bodia- respecting alleged violations of her 
territory. If the soundings now in progress 
on such a conference proved satisfactory, it 
could begin in a matter of days. Even if 
the soundings did not prove out, it would 
not be difficult to find other occasions for 
talks?either secretly or in public. 
The other big sticking point is a cease-fire. 
Neither side has yet declared itself officially 
on that issue. But once again there are 
some opportunities. Vietcong attacks have 
fallen in the last few weeks from a high of 
35 in the week of March 6 to 13 to a low of

vious condition a servitude. There was 
no provision which would touch the right 
of Congress to fix qualifications. 
This bill is as unconstitutional as it 
can be. 
Mr, HILL. Mr. President, can the 
Senator think of anything that would 
be more unconaitutional than this bill? 
Mr. ROBERTSON. We might pro-
vide for the iminediate repeal of the 10th 
amendment. This bill would practically 
do that, , 
Mr. HILL, That amendment ratified, 
affirmed, and confirmed the very thing 
?the Senator said; namely, that the power 
to fix qualifications was to be absolutely 
and wholly within the Power and au-
thority of the States. 
Mr. ROBERTSON. George Mason, 
Patrick Henry, and others claimed that 
Congress would eventually override the 
States and that the States would lose 
their power. 
Virginia would not have ratified the 
Constitution but for the promise of 
George Washington, James Madison, 
and the great jurist John Marshall, that 
amendments would be offered. They 
spelled out 12 of the amendments. 
One of the amendments was the 10th 
amendment, which provided that all 
powers not delegated to the Federal 
Government or denied to the States, 
would be reserved to the States and the 
people. 
Virginia was the largest State in area 
and population. Virginia was the most 
powerful and richest State. When the 
State of Virginia entered the Union, it 
had more Members in the House than 
any other State. The largest city south 
of Philadelphia was Williamsburg. 
Think of that. 
We would not have had any perfect 
Union without the 10th amendment. 
What kind of Union would we have if 
we were to pass this bill and take palt 
of the 10th amendment out of the Con-
stitution? That is what it would boil 
down to. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. President, I congrat-
ulate my distinguished colleague for the 
very fine speech he made today. 
Mr. ROBERTSON. I thank the Sen-
ator very much. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
IVCREDIBLE VIEWS OF FORMER 
SENATOR GOLDWLSTEA ON WAR 
WITH CHINA 
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. P esident, I was 
appalled by the report in today's Wash-
ington Post of statements made by 
former Senator Barry Goldwater in 
Paris on yesterday. According to the 
distinguished Washington Post foreign 
correspondent, Waverly Root, Mr. Gold-
water told newsmen at the Anglo-Amer-
ican Press Association luncheon that he 
"prays for Red China to provide provo-
catiOnS Which would justify the United 
States in attacking her atomic installa-
tions, but he doesn't think she will." 
As reported by Mr. Root, "the state-
ate,4t, on, 9,,Aina... Paine in answer to the 
1111000A Baia), reporter who asked 
whether crioldwater would advocate at-
tacking Chinese military, industrial, or 
atomic installation: `Yes, if they give 
us provocation,' Goldwater answered. 
`No, if they do not give us provocation. 
I rather pray that Red China would give 
us provocation to attack her military and 
atomic installations.'" 
Asked what would constitute sufficient 
provocation for attacking China, Gold-
water said "If China sends troops into 
South Vietnam or materiel in massive 
quantities." 
In other words, Mr. President, what 
Mr. Goldwater is saying is that he hopes 
China will send troops into the Viet-
namese conflict so that we will have an 
excuse to launch an attack on China. 
Mr. President, this is the most incred-
ible statement I have ever attributed to a 
prominent national figure. We can only 
speculate on the disastrous course our 
nation might have followed had Gold-
water been elected to the Presidency last 
fall. Consider the impact on the rest 
of the world if a leading American figure 
openly prayin,g that China will intervene 
in the Vietnamese war so that we will 
have an excuse to launch world war 
III by attacking this largest of all na-
tions on the face of the earth. That 
concept is almost beyond comprehen-
sion. It makes one shudder at the mere 
expression of the thought, particularly 
when it was expressed in a foreign coun-
try at the largest luncheon ever held by 
the Anglo-American Press Association. 
We can be thankful that the American 
people in their wisdom elected to the 
Presidency Lyndon Johnson, who has not 
only given repeated assurances that he 
seeks no wider war in Vietnam, but has 
offered to proceed at anytime with un-
conditional negotiations. 
I applaud the President's appointment 
of the distinguished W. Averell Harriman 
to represent us at the proposed confer-
ence on Cambodian neutrality. That 
conference, as our majority leader has 
repeatedly reminded us, can open the 
door to further discussions leading to a 
settlement on the Vietnamese war.. 
. _ 
As I first indicated on April 1, I trust 
that the President will also interrupt the 
bombing of North Vietnam long enough 
to provide some breathing room for the 
regime in Hanoi to consider negotiations, 
because, as the Senator from Arkansas 
[Mr. FULBRIGHT] has said, it is very diffi-
cult to create a climate favorable to ne-
gotiations so long as attacks continue on 
both sides. I would like to believe that 
this Nation is big enough and great 
enough to break the cycle of blows and 
counterblows which is a formula for a 
larger and larger war. 
I also hope that our great President 
would not hesitate to consider some ar-
rangement under which the National 
Liberation Front fighting in South Viet-
nam can be represented at negotiating 
sessions. After all, the principal antag-
onists in Vietnam are the South Viet-
namese Government in Saigon and the 
South Vietnamese Liberation Front, 
which speaks for the Vietcong guerrillas. 
Unless those two principal antagonists 
can work out some kind of a settlement, 
it seems to me we miss the main point. 
Negotiations must take place so that 
these two groups can reach some kind of 
a settlement, if the fighting is to cease. 
We should not lose sight of the fact that 
8529 
however much Hanoi and Peiping en-
courage and support the Vietcong guer-
rillas, this has always been fundamen-
tally an internal struggle involving the 
Government of South Vietnam on one 
hand, and the Vietnamese guerrilla forces 
on the other. 
I further hope that if negotiations do 
go forward, we will consider the creation 
of a southeast Asian peacekeeping force 
composed primarily of forces supplied 
by Burma, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, 
Malaya, and Vietnam, and other nations 
In the southeast Asia area. I think it 
has been one of the ingredients missing 
from the agreement of 1954. We have 
had no effective peacekeeping force to 
bring into that area under the agree-
ments at Geneva 11 years ago. 
Such a regional force affiliated with 
the United Nations would be in a much 
stronger position to stabilize this area 
of conflict and tension than would a uni-
lateral force of Americans operating 
8,000 miles away from home in alien ter-
ritory. 
Mr. President, one of the tragic as-
pects of this war is the growing terror-
ism on both sides. 
I suspect that one of the prices we pay 
for an undeclared war is that it stays 
outside the scope of the application of 
international law that is applied in in-
ternational conflicts. 
Americans have certainly felt a grow-
ing sense of uneasiness about the use of 
our weapons to burn villages, destroy the 
jungle foliage, and wreak havoc on the 
Vietnamese countryside. All of this, 
however, has been accompanied by 
mounting terrorist activity by the Viet-
cong guerrillas. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed at this point in the RECORD a 
list of 12 recent acts of terrorism on the 
part of the Vietcong guerrillas directed 
primarily at U.S. personnel. 
I request further that the article by 
Waverly Root reporting on Mr. Gold-
water's comments printed in this morn-
ing's Washington Post be inserted at this 
point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the list and

BARRY SEES PEIPING. FEAR OF ATTACK 
(By Waverly Root, Washington Post foreign 
service) .. 
PARIS, April 27,?Former Senator Barry 
Goldwater told 135 persons at the largest 
luncheon the Anglo-American Press Associa-
tion has ever held today that he prays for 
Red China to provide provocations which 
would justify the United States attacking 
her atomic installations?but he doesn't 
think she will. 
He also said he backed President Johnson's 
policy in Vietnam, that he did not expect 
nuclear weapons 40 be used there, and that 
while he doesn't expect to make another try 
for the presidency, he might run again for 
the Senate. But he said he found it rather 
pleasant to "stay home, play with my grand-
children, hunt and fish, bumming 'Hail To 
The Chief.' " 
The statement on China came in answer to 
the question of a British reporter who asked 
whether Goldwater would advocate attacking 
Chinese military, industrial, or atomic instal-
lations. 
"Yes, if they give us provocation," Gold-
water answered. "No, if they do not give us 
provocation. I rather pray that Red China 
would give us provocation to attack her mili-
tary and atomic installations." 
He added that "many peoples around the 
world would be happy to see China's nuclear 
capacity disappear." 
RUSSIANS INCLUDED 
He confirmed after his public speech that 
when he spoke of many peoples, he had Rus-
sians in mind among others. 
lisied what would constitute sufficient 
provocation for attacking China, Goldwater 
said, "if China sends troops into South Viet-
nam or materiel in massive quantities." 
He said this would not necessarily mean 
war. He said the United States could punish 
China from air or sea, where her strength is 
superior, but he would never favor sending 
ground troops in.. "No country," he said, 
"can match China on the ground." 
But he expressed the opinion that China 
will not provide provocation as he had de-
fined it. 
, Asked by another British newspaperman 
how long the United States can keep China 
out of the United Nations, Goldwater said, 
"if it comes right down to it. I don't think 
we could keep her out very long." 
He admitted the strength Of the argument 
that a nation of 600 or 700 million is hard 
to ignore, but went on, "in the United States, 
this is a political question. If you want to 
get into trouble there, just advocate admit-
ting Red China to the United Nations, or 
recognizing her." 
"Do you agree with President Johnson's 
policy in South Vietnam?" Goldwater was 
asked. 
JOHNSON SUPPORTED 
"I have to say yes. My President has done 
the right thing, in the right way." 
This came after Goldwater had introduced 
himself by saying, "If you don't know who I 
am, I'm the trigger-happy war-mongering 
* * * who proposed bombing the supply 
routes from North Vietnam. You're a states-
man today when you propose that. I was a 
year too early." 
Goldwater and Soviet Foreign Minister 
Andrei Gromyko were both on the town last 
night, playing an unperceived game of hide-
and-seek, but so far as anyone knows their 
criss-crossing paths never intersected. 
That was because they were pursuing 
widely different interests, both artistic. Gro-
myko was looking at the architectural gems 
of Paris and Goldwater was being tattooed. 
LAST TATTOO 
This took Gromyko to such magnificent 
sights of Paris as Notre Dame Cathedral and 
the Place de la Concorde, with fountain 
playing full blast, both floodlighted. 
It took Goldwater to a narrow street climb-
ing up the Montmartre hill behind the 
Pigalle Quarter. This is where you have to 
go to find one of the World's most famous 
tattoo artists, known by the single name of 
Bruno, whose weird working hours are 5 p.m. 
to 2 a.m. 
Goldwater went there to have a Ilopi In-
dian insignia near the base of his thumb 
completed. Member of a white man's asso-
ciation interested in Hopi folklore, Gold-
water already had the first insignia?two 
little points symbolizing a snake bite. He 
also had the two dots, one below the other, 
beneath the bite mark, each of which signi-
fies participation in a dance. After that you 
can dance and dance, but you earn no more 
dots. However, Goldwater was notified while 
here that he had just been named an hon-
orary chief, which gives him the right to a 
half circle over the snake bite. He had it 
added last night. 
Mr. MORTON, Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. McGOVERN. I yield. 
Mr. MORTON. I was not present in 
the Chamber and did not hear the early 
part of the Senator's statement. Did 
the Senator quote from what Secretary 
McNamara, said or what former Senator 
Goldwater said? 
Mr. McGOVERN. The quotation was 
from an article appearing in today's 
Washington Post, under the byline of 
Waverly Root, and is attributed to former 
Senator Goldwater. 
Mr. MORTON. I thought that per-
haps it might have been Secretary Mc-
Namara. 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OrtoiCER (Mr. Rus-
SELL of South Carolina in the chair). 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to call 
the roll. 
Mr. HART. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OteriCER (Mr. Mc-
GOVERN in the chair) . Without objec-

VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965 
The Senate resumed the consideration 
of the bill (S. 1564) to enforce the 15th 
amendment of the Constitution of the 
United States. 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, those of 
us who are proponents of the bill have 
found, in recent days, so much concen-
tration of attention on the issue of the 
poll tax which, interestingly enough, is 
eliminated by bills pending in both this 
and the other body, that we thought it 
might be useful to discuss the matter 
again, to make our position clear on the 
Recoso, and to underline the fact that 
elimination of the poll tax would repre-
sent a really tangible and practical ele-
ment of progress hit the field of civil 
rights. 
It is interesting to me that we have 
acted cautiously with respect to this 
problem in the past by adopting a con-
stitutional amendment which eliminates 
it only as to Federal elections, but that 
we now find this half measure does not 
really cure the situation. For all practi-
cal purposes, the voter is still called upon 
to pay the poll tax. 
I believe that it is fair to call the poll 
tax an anachronism. It is difficult to 
see how it can be defended by anyone 
except on the basis that the States 
should be permitted to do whatever they 
please in terms of defining as a qualifica-
tion something which is not a qualifica-
tion, or in terms of clinging to every 
vestigial institution, whatever it may be, 
Including the poll tax, which places re-
strictions upon the voting right. 
As a constitutional lawyer, it is my 
judgment?and I put into practice what 
I teach in theory, by introducing legisla-
tion to eliminate the poll tax by statute 
on previous occasions?that the poll tax 
can be eliminated by statute. This is cen-
tral, I believe, to the theme of the ma-
jority on the Judiciary Committee which 
supported the amendment, that the poll 
tax in fact represents a burden on the 
voting right and an abridgment of the 
voting right within the context of the 
15th amendment, and that as it has 
worked out it represents discrimination 
in favor of those who are economically 
able to pay and against those who are 
economically unable to pay. 
(At this point Mr. TYDINGS took the 
chair as Presiding Officer.) 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, it has 
actually been used as an instrument to 
perpetuate abridgement of the right to 
register and vote, and therefore, both 
on the basis of law and practice?and 
the Supreme Court has always consid-
ered both?the poll tax should bc 
abolished. 
To those who would cite Breedlove 
against Suttles, which is the Georgia 
case which upheld a poll tax levied bY 
a State, I would say two things: First, 
that case can be easily distinguished 
on the facts from the case now pending 
before the Supreme Court, Harper 
against the Virginia State Board of 
Elections, which will be argued this fail 
and undoubtedly decided reasonably soot 
thereafter. Second, the question of the 
15th amendment was not even raised in 
Breedlove against Suttles. 
Most of the States have repealed the 
poll tax. Only four States still have IL

polls, research reports, factflnding, one-man 
and any-man Opinions, searching looks which 
were meant to penetrate and describe what 
has been called, ftont time to time, "the 
agony of the GOP," "a party in crisis," "the 
GOP struggle for survival," "dialectic Re-
publicanism," "the Republican election 
trauma," "can the elephant forget?" and the 
"Republicans after the debacle," with each 
report usually coming to the brilliant con-
clusion that the Republican Party was in a 
bit of a mess. 
As a Republican, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank all of those who con-
tributed in such a thoughtful and well mean-
ing way to starting us off on the long road 
back and if they have run out of salt for our 
wounds, I would be glad to replenish their 
supply. 
I am not trying to minimize the extent of 
rethinking and the toUgh policy and leader-
ship decisions that will be necessary for the 
GOP to win elections again. It's not every 
year that a party loses over 500 seats in 
State legislatures across the Nation along 
with key Senate and House seats. 
But I do not foresee the 1964 Goldwater 
candidacy as the Republican's albatross, rele-
gating the party to minority status for years 
to come. Neither do I believe it represented 
a strictly indigenous attitude of the Repub-
lican Party. 
The American concept of conservatism is 
not confinett to one political party. The par-
ticular attitude winch dominated the 1961 
Republican Convention has lain under the 
surface of American political activity for 
20 years, since the inception of the cold war. 
It has been the reservoir of frustration re-
sulting from our necessary international role, 
and the repository of fear, mistrust, and in-
security which are products of the social' and 
economic adjustments since the war. 
If the election was supposed to offer a 
choice, it was 20 years too late, and if we 
wanted the candidates to embody that choice, 
the American public missed its chance in 
1962 when it failed' to match Adlaf 'S'teven-
son and Robert A. Taft, two articulate repre-
sentatives of opposing philosophies. 
The possibility of a liberal-conservative 
confrontation passed from the sublime to 
the ridiculous and 1964 witnessed a campaign 
billed as a great confrontation of America's 
past with its future, between two Men who 
were probably personally in more general 
agreement on more issues than any two op-
Mg candidates in recent history. 
, Frankly, I am less concerned about the 
Supposed "cost" of this election to the Re-
publican Party than I am about its cost to 
the American people. 
It, deprived us of the necessary and serious 
exchange of views on the alternative ways of 
dealing with the difficult problems this coun-
try faces, both at home and abroad; of ex-
ploring the meaning and extent of our in-
volvement in South Vietnam; of debating 
and eXaMining the proposed programs to 
eradicate poverty, to provide medical care 
for the aged; aid to public, private, and paro-
chial school education and the myriad other 
problems that majorities of broth parties rec-
ognize and are committed to resolve. 
In short, the American people were de-
prived of the opportunity to judge a cam-
paign that bore some relation to the real 
vvorld and its very real problems. 
Instead, we watched TV spots with people 
.earing up their social security cards; the 
prOlected linage of a choice between good 
sIld eY117 bf'ack and white, war and peace?
cot that t wasn't ripe for presentation 
along those lines and the obvious image for 
the party in power to exploit, but what was' 
the result after the Nation went through the 
motions of registering their choice. What 
was the resUlt after the computers predicted 
the, winner, w,thiu pe-tenth of 1 percent 
accuracy 10 minutes after the polls closed? 
What ac1 happened, or rather what had not 
happened? 
The administration, the incumbent, had 
not been put to a test; he had not been chal-
lenged; he did not have to defend the poli-
cies and programs he had set before the Na-
tion and was proposing for the future. 
What did he have to defend them against? 
His program for aid to education against no 
program? His background as a leader in 
civil rights against that of his opponent? 
We did not learn very much about the way 
the President would react under the pres-
sure of an articulate and well-directed oppo-
sition to whom the public was listening and 
to whom he would be expected to reply. 
Discussion of the whole area of foreign pol-
icy took place under a mushroom cloud 
which prevented the public from giving seri-
ous consideration to What else the President 
must do besides refrain from "pushing the 
button." 
We are facing some of the consequences of 
the lack of public debate in this area right 
now. The public was ill informed and un-
prepared for our present policy in Vietnam 
and the temper of the man who is directing 
it. The campaign was supposed to have 
been between a dove and a hawk. The dove 
won. So, what's he doing acting like a 
hawk? 
The campaign distorted the issues and the 
candidates, and in the end, not only did 
Goldwater lose, but Johnson lost and the 
American people lost. Why? Because the 
presidential process failed to work. It 
failed to force a presidential candidate to 
win the Presidency. It was left to him by 
default and we didn't accurately judge the 
man who won. 
Our fling for the sake of the American 
political neurosis cost us more than the elec-
tion and I am more distressed by that than 
anything else. 
In terms of practical politics, the Repub-
lican Party need not ask of Goldwater and 
the ensuing election disaster, in the words 
of an old popular song, "Is you is, or is you 
ain't my baby?" It's our baby, all right, al-
though many of us question the parentage. 
At least there is one thing upon which all 
Republicans can agree, and that is that the 
party's major task between now and the 
1966 congressional elections is to project a 
positive Republican image in keeping with 
the true traditions of the party. 
In 18 months the Republican Party will 
again face the electorate, and we must face 
the electorate with a constructive record of 
accomplishment. 
I suggest with pride that the Republican 
congressional delegation has distinguished 
itself in the two critical areas of foreign and 
domestic policy with honor and good judg-
ment. 
Senator `Dirinsw and Representatives FORD 
and NicCuLLocit have played and are playing 
an admirable role in' the effort to write an 
effective and problem-solving 'voting rights 
bill. 
Almost without exception, the Republican 
congressional delegation has given loyal and 
valuable assistance to the President in re-
gard to the crisis In Vietnam. 
In the matter of foreign policy our re-
sponsibility as Republicans, as the loyal op-
position, is aparticularly_important_gne and 
a particularly delicate one. 
The Republican Party has a special obliga-
tion in the Vietnam crisis and in all other 
foreign policy crises to insist that the minor-
ity voice, the voice which challenges ad-
ministration policy is heard. 
If there is anything that is more troubling 
than the problem of Vietnam itself, and the 
role of the United States in Vietnam, it is 
the increasingly hysterical and thoughtless 
tone which has characterized public discus-
sion about Vietnam. 
I think, in such a crisis, that the minority 
party, the Republican Party must be the un-
deviating ally of the press as you and your 
colleagues seek to supply the Nation with the 
facts about Vietnam. 
It is no reflection on the good faith, the 
good intentions, or the ability of those 
charged with the execution of U.S. policy in 
Vietnam to remind them and the Nation that 
the public and the minority party also have 
a vital role to play in this crisis. 
All need to know the plain truth about 
what is happening in Vietnam. We need to 
know the good news and the bad news. We 
need to know our strengths and our weak-
nesses. 
When overzealous, oversensitive men?
civilian or military?attempt to impose a 
news blackout from Vietnam, try to conceal 
what is happening there and elsewhere in 
southeast Asia, I submit that the Republican 
Party has the responsibility to speak out 
loudly and clearly in favor of your right to 
gather the facts and the public's right to 
know them. 
A party that controls neither the White 
House nor the Congress is in a difficult posi-
tion to take the lead in offering new ideas 
and programs to deal with such problems as 
health, housing, education, transportation; 
the increasingly important and complex 
problems of our growing urban centers. 
A party's programs and goals in these areas 
are formulated at its convention and ham-
mered into its platform. 
Unfortunately the Republican Party's 1964 
platform Committee and its product did not 
impress upon the American public the com-
mitment and resolve of the party as a whole; 
to devise thoughtful and effective programs 
to meet the needs in these areas. 
This lack of a realistic and meaningful 
action program for the party is the major 
obstacle to our presenting the Republican 
Party to the American people in 1966 as a 
serious alternative to those presently in 
power. 
When I was asked by reporters on election 
night, what I thought might be done to be-
gin to overcome the disasterous defeat we 
had suffered, I suggested then, and still be-
lieve, that, it was important to hold a na-
tional Republican convention or conference, 
in this off year, to formulate a sound Repub-
lican position on the host of foreign and 
domestic problems which confront the Na-
tion. 
There is precedent for such an off year 
conference in both the Democratic and Re-
publican Party. 
I am of the opinion that a conference of 
this nature would go a long way toward 
chystallizing both leadership and policy 
within the party, giving new direction and 
vigor to our coming election efforts. 
It has been asked, "what good is a political 
party unless it is serving some great national 
purpose?" 
Out of power the Republican Party must 
be an articulate and informed opposition 
and when we assume national leadership the 
party must pursue our goals at home and 
abroad with programs that show a deep con-
cern for the individual. If the Democrats 
call themselves the party of the people, then 
we are the party of the individual, concerned 
with the place and dignity of man; his rights 
and his welfare, his future in a free society. 
A party demonstrating this concern will de-
serve the support of the American people. A 
party demonstrating this concern will win 
the support of the American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- APPENDIX April 28, 1965 
Council of America carries a most in-
teresting and revealing article entitled 
"The Growing Threat of Soviet Sea-
power." 
I recommend a close analysis of this 
succinct article to each of my colleagues 
for I feel we have been lax in recognizing 
the significance of Russia's advances: 
THE GROWING THREAT OF SOVIET SEAPOWER 
Also included in last year's report was an 
official assessment of the condition of the 
U.S.-flag merchant fleet prepared by the 
Deputy Chief of Naval Operation (Logistics). 
This showed that our merchant fleet is in 
even more critical shape than the naval fleet. 
Over 90 percent of the dry-cargo ships and 55 
percent of the tankers in the fleet will 
shortly reach the end of their economic lives 
simultaneously. There has been no improve-
ment in this situation. 
In addition, the active fleet, which num-
bered 1,950 ships totaling 22.4 million dead-
weight tons in 1951, has contracted steadily 
and now is composed of only 900 ships aggre-
gating 13 million tons. 
Any significant improvement of the future 
outlook for the private shipyards must await 
official recognition of the deteriorated state 
of this Nation's seapower resources. This day 
of reckoning cannot be delayed or postponed 
much longer. Time is running out. 
Budgetary expediencies adopted for too 
many previous years account for the alarm-
ing block obsolescence problems which now 
afflict our naval and merchant fleets. Our 
shortsighted policies also have taken their 
toll on the private shipyard industry, as evi-
denced by the fact that 18 private shipyards 
have been forced to close their gates per-
manently during the past 10 years. 
Of necessity, our national planners ulti-
mately will have to face up to the block 
obsolescence or this Nation will lose its sea 
power capability by default. We believe the 
former alternative will prevail. Hopefully, 
the required remedial action will be taken 
before further contraction in the size of the 
private shipyard industry occurs. 
The sharp contrast in the priorities which 
Russia and the United States have assigned 
to seapower again was all too evident during 
1964. 
Russia's naval strength continued to grow 
and her enormous merchant fleet expansion 
program was further accelerated. In this 
country a welcome increase in naval ship con-
struction occurred. However, the volume of 
new orders fell far short of the level required 
to prevent further magnification of the U.S. 
Navy fleet's alarming block obsolescence 
problem. The construction of merchant 
ships, as has been noted, continued at such 
a low level that the quantitative and qualita-
tive deficiencies of the American merchant 
marine were further accentuated. 
As a naval power, Russia is second only to 
the United States. The U.S. Navy's fleet is 
better balanced and possesses more versatile 
striking power. Russia, whose naval stratgey 
stresses the submarine as the major element 
of her fleet strength, boast's the largest sub-
marine fleet in the world. "Janes Fighting 
Ships," the authoritative naval journal, says 
the U.S.S.R. fleet comprises more than 430 
submarines?a growing number of which are 
nuclear-powered attack and missile-firing 
types. The U.S. Navy has only 175 sub-
marines, of which 51 are nuclear-powered 
units. As a point of refere:nce. Hitler, in the 
early stages of World War II, decimated the 
Allies' supply lines with a total fleet of only 
57 submarines. 
The remarkable expansion of the U.S.S.R. 's 
merchant fleet stems from a series of con-
tinuing shipbuilding programs, which since 
1950 have increased the fleet size from 432 
ships of 1.8 million deadweight tons to 1,200 
vessels totaling 8 million tons today. 
Currently underway is a 5-year plan (1965-
70) which is programed to increase the mer-
chant fleet's tonnage to 15 million dead-
weight by 1970. 
By mid-1966 Russia's merchant marine, 
which already possesses more ships, will sur-
pass the American fleet in terms of total 
tonnage. More importantly, the Russian 
fleet will be composed predominantly of new, 
efficient vessels while the U.S. merchant 
marine will be composed, overwhelmingly of 
obsolete ships in the 25-year-old bracket. 
The U.S.-flag fleet has been contracting 
steadily for the past 15 years. In 1951 it 
numbered 1,955 active vessels totaling 22.4 
million deadweight tons. Today, this Nation 
has only 900 ships aggregating- 13.5 million 
tons in active service. 
The accompanying table, which compares 
the level of shipbuilding activity generated 
by the American and Soviet merchant ma-
rines, vividly reflects the contrasting mari-
time objectives. 
Because Russian shipyards are heavily en-
gaged in naval construction, 3.9 million of 
the 6.5 million tons of shipbuilding will be 
built outside of Russia.

EXTE0 N OF REMARKS 
or 
HON. ROBERT F. ELLSWORTH 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 1965 
Mr. ELLSWORTH. Mr. Speaker, the 
April 24, 1965, issue of the Economist of 
London has a better, clearer, and more 
enlightening explanation of the U.S. 
position and policy in Vietnam than any-
thing put out by anybody in the Johnson 
administration. I commend the Econ-
omist explanation to the attention of my 
colleagues in the Congress: 
ALL WARS ARE FILTHY?BTJT THE VIETNAM 
ONE IS GOING TO BE SETTLED BY CAREFUL 
PERSEVERANCE, NOT BY WRINGING ONE'S 
HANDS 
That "filthy Fascist war" in Vietnam, as 
Mrs. Anne Kerr called it in Trafalgar Square 
on Monday, has reached a stage where high-
pitched simplicities like Mrs. Kerr's have 
long since been overtaken by events. The 
honorable but confused member for Roch-
ester and Chatham presumably wants the 
Americans to stop bombing North Vietnam, 
thus returning matters in South Vietnam 
to where they were at the beginning of 
February (which was two-thirds of the way 
down the slippery slope to a Vietcong vic-
tory). So do the rather haphazard collec-
tion of her fellow Labor Members of Parlia-
ment and other Labor Party supporters 
who assembled at the annual jamboree or-
ganized by the cooperative movement at 
Blackpool on Sunday. On the other side of 
the hill, there may be men in Washington 
who still believe the war will be ended by 
somebody in Peiping flicking a switch and 
turning off the flow of revolutionary cur-
rent that runs through Hanoi to the Viet-
cong. But it ought to be plain that the 
positions taken by the United States and 
China in the past 11 weeks virtually rule 
out both these extreme possibilities. Neither 
of the two great patron powers is in a mood 
to throw in the sponge completely without 
a major struggle. 
What has been happening in the 11 weeks 
since the Americans started bombing North 
Vietnam is a gradual narrowing down of the 
range of likely outcomes, though the range 
still runs from the tolerably acceptable to the 
very undesirable: The central question is 
the part the rebels in the south will play in 
any future political settlement. Most peo-
ple, looking at the guerrilla wars of the last 
20 years, suspect that the Vietcong rebellion 
is probably too well established to be totally 
extirpated. It is entirely possible, on- the 
other hand, that if it can be cut off from its 
sources of nourishment in the north it can 
be brought under control, as a fire sometimes 
is, without being actually put out. In that 
case the rebels' share in a future political 
settlement can probably be kept small 
enough for South Vietnam to remain outside 
the Communist camp. Other small countries 
with half-assimilated Communist minorities, 
like Finland and Burma, have managed to 
do just that, though the trick is harder to 
turn in Asia than in Europe. But if the 
attempt to cut the Vietcong off from its 
northern roots fails, it will pretty certainly 
be the Communists who dominate the final 
settlement. The only question then will be 
the speed with which it happens, and the de-
gree of humiliation inflicted on the United 
States in the process. 
(It might alternatively, as the optimists 
hope, be the beginning of a general retreat 
north of the 17th parallel, but nothing else 
the Communists have been doing confirms 
this hopeful reading.) The attempt at a 
showdown might come at an American base 
like Pleiku or even, if the Vietcong is ready 
to "try a Dienbienphu," at the Marines' 
laager at Da Nang. One rather hopes it will; 
Da Nang, on the coast, is not Dienbienphu 
in its pocket of hills, and the Americans are 
not the French. Or, alternatively, the attack 
might take the form of an attempt to cut 
communications between Da Nang and the 
south across the middle of the country. 
If a major Vietcong offensive in the wet 
weather that begins soon does succeed in 
capturing an American base or cutting South 
Vietnam in two, the result will be more or 
less a foregone conclusion. Morale in the 
south, which has been rising in the last few 
weeks, will drop again; the old routine of 
coups d'etat will be resumed; and the Ameri-
cans will find themselves frighteningly near 
the end of the gangplank. If, on the other 
hand, the outcome is a big battle that the 
Vietcong loses, it will be North Vietnam's 
turn for an agonizing reappraisal. For the 
North Vietnamese would then face the pros-
pect of being steadily bombed to pieces while 
the rebels in the south slowly pulled them-
selves together, regrouped, and thought out 
their tactics afresh. In that event the 
Americans' tactics would have been triumph-
antly justified: by forcing the Vietcong into 
a decisive battle before it was really ready, 
they might in effect have won the war. 
The North Vietnamese have made it clear 
that the American bombing is not yet hurt-
ing them enough - to persuade them to stop 
helping the rebels in the south. However, 
it is certainly hurting them enough for them 
not to want it to go on indefinitely. This 
gives them a powerful motive for urging the 
Vietcong to have a last great fling at win-
ning the war in the south as soon as pos-
sible. The reported withdrawal of rebel 
forces from the southernmost part of the 
country may well be the sign of an impend-
ing last fling further north.

But it is quite likely that the rainy season 
will bring no decisive victory for either side. 
In that case the range of possibilities will 
narrOw still further, and the conflict will 
settle down into a war of attrition that might 
drag on for a long time. The outcome of 
this war of attrition will depend, first, on the 
extent to which the recent rise in South 
Vietnamese Morale can be put to practical 
use (Mr. McNamara, the Anlerican Secretary 
of Defense, has been arranging in Hawaii 
this week, to traln. an extra 100,000 South 
Vietnamese troops). It will depend, second, 
on the extent tO which the flow of aid to 
the Vietcong from the north can be dimin-
ished. If the North Vietnamese can be 
jostled into reducing the supply of recruits 
and arms in the hope of limiting the aerial 
pounding they have to take?or if thay 
simply cannot get the supplies through be-
cause the bridges are down and the railway 
broken?time will probably work on the side 
of the Americans and the South Vietnamese. 
The Vietconk, deprived of its northern sup-
port, would gradually be cut down to its 
proper size as a native southern rebellion, 
and the way might at last be open to a 
political settlement that is not merely a 
case of the Communist north swallowing the 
south. 
In this long and delicate operation, timing 
will be very important indeed. The sensible 
idea has been put forward?and informally 
approved of by the United States, Russia and 
Britain,?of holding a conference about 
Cambodia's problems during which the in-
terested parties could draw the conversation 
round to Vietnam. Cambodia said primly on 
Tuesday that any such conference should 
deal with Cambodia alone, but delegates in 
conference corridors have a way of getting 
round difficulties like that. No conference 
held in the near future is likely to produce a 
clear-out solution of Vietnam's problems, 
unless one side or the other changes It posi-
tion in a hurry. But informal conversations 
would be useful as a means of delaying 
the moment when either the Chinese or the 
Missions might feel obliged to involve them-
selves more directly. (Both have lately as 
good as said?the Russians on April 17 and 
the Chinese on April 20?that they will not 
send volunteers to North Vietnam unless the 
American bombing goes beyond its present 
limits.) Better still, the conversations could 
provide a way of delicately discovering what 
mixture of military stick and diplomatic car-
rot would be most effective in getting the 
North Vietnamese to cut down their aid to 
the Vietcong. 
Senator Ftmaainivr called on April 18?
echoing an earlier suggestion by Canada's 
Prime Minister, Mr, Pearson?for a pause 
in the bombing of North Vietnam. The 
trouble with this course is that there is no 
evidence that the North Vietnamese would 
interpret it as anything but a sign of Ameri-
can vacillation; and, if an openly announced 
pause failed to bring a response from Hanoi, 
and the bombing started again, there would 
be a natural reluctance in Washington to 
repeat the experiment later on, when a halt 
might well be more fruitful. But these ob-
jections do not apply to a privately dropped 
American hint, whispered on the back row 
of a Cambodia conference, that the bombing 
Might just stop for a week or so, without any 
oUblic announcement whatever, to give the 
NTorth Vietnamese a chance to reply in kind 
with an equally unpublicized halt in their 
sssistance to :the Vietcong. The same 
whispered conversation might include a 
spelling out of President Johnson's remark 
on 'March 25.04101.1t_tbe .conditions in which 
"the people and Government of South Viet-
nam" should, be "free to settle their own 
future." This would begin to define the 
terms under NO/Jell the southern rebels, once 
they were confined to .real southerners, could 
join in the political dialog. 
Shrill denunciation is simply no longer 
relevant to the Vietnam problem. The need 
now is for a careful use of military strength 
and diplomatic ingenuity, of determination 
coupled with an awareness of the value of 
treading cannily. The evidence suggests that 
President Johnson knows what is called for. 
One hopes the other side does too. 
Right-To-Work Laws 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WILLIAM H. AYRES 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 1965 
Mr. AYRES. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Robert 
H. Feldkamp, one of the Nation's out-
standing political writers, recently com-
mented in his column in the Akron Bea-
con Jotirnal about my position in regard 
to the repeal of section 14(b) of the 
Taft-Hartley Act. 
The column follows: 
THE POLITICAL PARADE 
(By Robert H. Feldkamp) 
Representative AYRES, of Akron, has de-
cided to vote for repeal of section 14(b) of 
the Taft-Hartley Act?which may raise some 
eyebrows. 
The is the controversial section permitting 
States to enact their own right-to-work 
laws?laws which bar compulsory unionism. 
AYRES, a Republican, confides he will be 
taking a position contrary to that generally 
expressed by his party on the touchy subject 
of right to work. 
Couple AYRES' position with the fact that 
he is the ranking Republican on the House 
Education and Labor Committee?where the 
repealer will first be considered, most likely 
this session?and it adds up to smooth sail-
ing once the bill is thrown into the hopper. 
This is doubly significant because labor has 
wanted to repeal 14(b) for nearly 20 years, 
but could never muster the strength in Con-
gress. 
This time, with AYRES' help, repeal is im-
minent. 
AYRES and ADAM CLAYTON POWELL, the New 
York Democrat who heads the Education 
and Labor Committee, are working together. 
POWELL, in fact, is part of the reason that 
AYRES will support repeal. 
The New Yorker knows that the bill prob-
ably will pass easily once it is reported out of 
committee. Democrats hold an overwhelm-
ing edge in Congress and most will go for 
it. And of the 435 House Members, only 
124 come from the 19 States now having 
right-to-work laws?so no great opposition 
will develop there. 
POWELL knows that his greatest bargain-
ing power comes while the bill still is in 
committee. So do labor chieftains, who 
dearly want repeal. 
AFL-CIO President George Meany has a 
pledge from President Johnson?in return 
for a lot of help from labor during the last 
campaign?for help in killing 14(b). 
Meany, however, must contend with Pow-
ELL and that is what is happening now. 
POWELL, a Negro, long has been unhappy 
about the virtual exclusion of Negroes from 
union apprentice training programs. AYRES 
also has said publicly that qualified Negroes 
should be allowed, into these programs. 
Meany, it is understood, has promised 
POWELL he will do all he can to break down, 
these racial barriers?in return for fast com-
mittee action on 3,4(b). 
This is where the matter now stands, and 
is part of the reason AYRES will line up with 
the Democrats. ' 
He knows, too, that the' Southern States 
now having right-to-work laws are using 
them as a magnet in attracting northern 
industries. 
"Come on down," these Southern States 
are saying, "and you won't have to face 
compulsory union shops." 
AYRES also remembers 1958 in Ohio of 
course, when Republicans who favored right 
to work were overwhelmed py labor-backed 
Democrats in almost every instance. 
"The people of Ohio spoke out on this 
then, and were very clear," he says. 
Mr. Speaker, I do not differ from the 
conclusions as drawn by Mr. Feldkamp; 
rather, I would elaborate and give the 
background-of my position. 
In 1958, when a right-to-work amend-
ment was placed on our Ohio ballot, I 
publicly stated that I would not vote for 
it. I further stated that I felt that the 
U.S. Congress should face this issue. 
Let no one feel that this is a reversal of 
position. I am a firm supporter of the 
Taft-Hartley Act and took a major part 
in the conference that brought about 
the enactment of the Landrum-Griffin 
Act. 
I have always supported labor legisla-
tion that would provide the proper 
climate for fair bargaining. Excess of 
power by either party can but lead to 
disaster for both. I have always kept in 
mind that the general public had a great 
interest and that interest should have 
proper consideration. 
There might be some who would infer 
that any movement to repeal section 
14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act would be 
an attack on that act itself. This is un-
true. 
There comes a time when experience 
brings about a review of some sections of 
what might be considered a very fair 
law. 
Just a short time ago, I called for a 
review of the election provisions of the 
Landrum-Griffin. In two recent national 
union elections, loopholes in that law was 
found to exist?loopholes that permitted 
fraudulent or confusing action. The 
right of union members to conduct fair 
elections is paramount. 
The Landrum-Griffin Act was drawn 
so as to give protection to union members 
that might, on occasion, be beset by au-
tocratic leadership. It is a fine law but 
improvements, in this one direction, 
might be made. I would still protect the 
Landrum-Griffin Act as I still would pro-
tect the Taft-Hartley Act. 
An organization that is disputing the 
repeal of section 14(b), falsely charges 
that this repeal would force every em-
ployee to join a union and pay dues. To 
clear up this misconception, I am detail-
ing the actual effect of the repeal of sec-
tion 14 (b) . 
As I recently covered this subject in a 
speech, I do now include excerpts from 
my remarks pertaining to this subject: 
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS IN CONNECTION 
WITH PROPOSALS To REPEAL SECTION 14(b) 
Section 14(b) of Taft-Hartley authorizes 
the States to limit or completely prohibit 
any form of compulsory union membership 
arrangement. Nineteen, of the fifty States

A2012 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX April 28, *in 65 
have enacted such statutes, popularly known 
as right-to-work laws. 
There seems to be a widespread miscon-
ception that in the 31 States which do not 
have right-to-work laws union membership 
is compulsory for employees in organized 
enterprises. This is utterly erroneous. 
Compulsory union membership results ex-
clusively from voluntary contracts entered 
into between employers and labor unions 
during the course of free collective bargain-
ing. Nothing in either Federal or State law 
compels an employee to join a union or an 
employer to consent to an agreement with a 
union which would require his employees to 
join the union as a condition of retaining 
their jobs. 
In other words, compulsory union member-
ship, where it exists, is a result of free and 
voluntary agreement between employer and 
union, and is not a requirement imposed by 
law. If 14(b) were to be repealed, thus,nul-
lifying State right-to-work laws, neverthe-
less, no employee could be compelled to join 
a union in order to hold his job, Unless his 
employer voluntarily agreed to including 
such a requirement in his contract with the 
union. 
If section 14(b) were to be repealed, the 
provision in the Taft-Hartley Act permit-
ting union security arrangements would then 
apply uniformly in all of the 50 States. 
Again there seems to be a wideapread mis-
conception that this would have the effect of 
imposing unrestricted compulsory union 
membership on all employees in organized 
enterprises. This, too, is erroneous. The 
provision in Taft-Hartley permitting em-
ployers and unions to agree to union security 
arrangements is an extremely limited one. 
The closed shop, which requires the em-
ployer to hire only those job applicants who 
are already members of the union, would 
still be unlawful. And employees required 
to join the union after getting their jobs 
this is known as the union shop] could not 
be deprived of their jobs even if they lose 
their membershili in the union, unless such 
loss Of membership were the result of a re-
fusal to pay their dues or initiation fee. Loss 
or denial of union membership for any other 
reason Would not be a lawful reason for the 
employee's loss of his job. 
Hence, apart from the requirement to pay 
union dues and initiation fees, the employee 
required to join the union would have no 
other obligations to the union as a condi-
tion of holding his job. 
Repeal of 14(b) would leave the funda-
mental scheme of the Taft-Hartley and Lan-
drum-Griffin Acts unchanged. 
The Wagner Act which remained on the 
statute books substantially unchanged from 
1935 to 1947, was limited to protecting em-
ployees against any attempt by their em-
ployers to interfere with their membership 
in or activities in behalf of their unions. 
No other safeguards for employees were pro-
vided, nor were there any protections pro-
vided for employers against any type of 
union misconduct. 
The Taft-Hartley Act, passed in 1947, pro-
vided protections for employers against cer-
tain types of union conduct such as 
secondary boycotts, certain types of picket-
ing, jurisdictional dispute strikes, etc. 
Moreover, the closed shop was completely 
outlawed, and only the limited type of union 
shop described above was permitted even in 
those States without right-to-work laws. 
None of these new safeguards would be af-
fected in any way by the repeal of 14(b). 
In 1959, the Landrum-Griffin Act became 
law. This strengthened the ban on second-
ary boycotts, outlawed hot-cargo contracts, 
and prohibited organizational, recognition, 
and extortionate picketing. These addi-
tional safeguards for employers and em-
ployees would not be changed by repeal of 
14(b). Moreover, the new provisions estab-
lishing a bill of rights for union members, 
protecting union funds against misuse, erect-
ing certain safeguards for the conduct .of 
union elections, similarly would remain un-
affected by repeal of 14 (b) . 
Thus it is plain that repeal of 14(b) would 
result in no fundamental or significant mod-
ification in the structure and safeguards 
which the Taft-Hartley and Landrum-Grif-
fin Acts have made available to rank-and-file 
union members, employees, and employers.

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. GLENN CUNNINGHAM 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 1965 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, as 
the author of H.R. 980, the bill over-
whelmingly approved by this distin-
guished body, to stop the free flow of un-
solicited obscenity through the mails, I 
would like to call attention to an inter-
faith group in New York City which has 
done an extraordinary job of fighting 
smut in that community. I am speaking 
of Operation Yorkville. The efforts of 
this outstanding group of interested citi-
zens have alerted others throughout the 
United States to the dangers of the avail-
ability of obscene and pornographic ma-
terial to our young people. 
This interfaith campaign is organized 
to protect the parental-civil right to stop 
the traffic in pornography ariaong chil-
dren by expressing community standards. 
I am certain my destinguished col-
leagues join in commending this very 
worthwhile organization for their untir-
ing efforts in the war against obscenity. 
The following articles taken from the 
March issue of the Operation Yorkville 
Newsletter point up the problem which 
exists and show what can be done and 
what is being done about this most seri-
ous problem: 
LETTER POWER (LP) IS PEACEFUL PROTEST--
PROTEST AGAINST THE VIOLATIoN OF You 
RIGHTS To EDUCATE AND PROTECT 
The problem of the traffic in pornography 
among children is your problem, and only 
you can begin the cycle which will result in 
the protection of your parental-civil right 
to educate and protect. 
Police will not arrest, district attorneys will 
not prosecute, many judges will continue to 
rule in favor of pornographers--unless you 
protest. 
Letter writing is protest, peaceful but 
forceful protest. Letter writing can be the 
power of the people, which when applied, can 
tip the scales of justice in favor of innocent 
children. 
The cycle is simple, but effective. Letter 
protests to the press (to one newspaper, so 
that the greatest force will be directed to one 
point) will result in conflict in the press?
conflict between parents and pornographers. 
Conflict will result in news; news will stimu-
late editorial coverage; editorial coverage will 
spur law enforcement, prosecution, and 
judgments, which will reflect regard for your 
rights and, in so doing, protect the innocent 
from perversion. 
You can help start the wheels of justice 
turning. You can use the machinery of 
peaceful protest?use your letter power. Be-
gin writing your newspaper as soon as pos-
sible. 
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN AND THE PUZZLING 
DEFENSE 
As the last 1964 issue of the Newsletter was 
going to press, Justice William J. Brennan, 
of the U.S. Supreme Court was busily de-
fending his opinion in the June 22 "Lovers" 
and "Tropic of Cancer" decisions. 
Mr. Justice Brennan, in the June 22 opin-
ion, defined community standards (a test 
since 1957 in obscenity cases) as a national 
standard, referring to society at large, 
thus indicating that the test for obscenity 
should rest on the lowest possible Common 
denominator of morality. 
In a November 15 speech at the Louis Mar-
shall Award Dinner of the Jewish Theological 
Seminary in New York City, Justice Brennan 
chose to defend his position and succeeded 
only in compounding the confusion which 
the Court's June 22 decisions created. 
Mr. Justice Brennan quoted from Leclercq: 
"The jurist is above all interested in Social 
good, in rules to be observed in view of that 
good; the moralist is preoccupied with the 
good of the individual." He quickly went on 
to say, "It is- not necessary to accept the 
proposition as invariably true to recognize 
its validity in some cases." He hurried on 
to demonstrate, that he is aware that there 
is suchja thing as a public, social morality, 
even indicating that it is at a higher level 
than his June 22 opinion would have us be-
lieve: it is a mistaken notion that judges 
are not as fully conscious as men of religion 
that our institutions reflect a firm convic-
tion that we are a religious people * 
Judges in fact daily administer innumerable 
laws which enact moral standards fashioned 
by theologians. But there are constitutional 
limits to the legislative power even in the 
areas of religion and morality. 
Operation Yorkville submits that Justice 
Brennan's June 22 opinion does not reflect a 
firm conviction that we are a religious peo-
ple, and raises a question as to his ideas of 
the individual good and even the social 
good. Further, the Court's reading of the 
Constitution has seemed strained and over-
doctrinaire in the area of publications. 
Why? Mr. Justice Brennan went on in his 
speech: "The line between protected and un-
protected portrayal is dim and uncertain." 
This, in spite of the fact that we are a re-
ligious people. Mr. Brennan's opinion has 
helped render the line even dimmer and more 
uncertain. Where to now, Mr. Justice Bren-
nan?

Historically, Pittsburgh has been a mate-
rials center. More new materials and proc-
essing techniques have been developed in the 
area than in any other section of the United 
States. 
Although the region's research and devel-
opment activities have been broadened con-
siderably, new and better materials and proc-
esses still command the largest volume of 
& D. efforts. 
These activities range from research in 
ouch traditional areas as steel, aluminum, 
coal, refractories, ceramics, and glass, to 
pioneering work in alloys, nuclear fuels, and 
exotic materials. 
Basic studies into the nature of metals and 
alloys are conducted at Mellon Institute, 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, and Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, as well as industrial 
laboratories. 
On the applied research scene, Allegheny 
Ludlum Steel Corp. is improving upon its 
vacuum melting technique breakthrough; 
MSA Research Corp. is experimenting with 
new liquid metals; and Universal-Cyclops 
Steel Corp. is studying ways to fabricate re-
fractory metals in an inert atmosphere. 
. Semi-Elements, Inc,. is developing single 
aryatals of metals; Harbison-Walker Re-
fractories Co. is working on extremely high 
temperature refractories; Magnetics, Inc., is 
producing new magnetic materials; Pitts-
burgh Plate Glass Co. is exploring deep-div-
ing structures made of glass; and Nuclear Ma-

Victory Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn 
Continues To Provide Unexcelled Serv-
ices After 60 years 
EXTENSION OF FtEm4Rxp 
HON. HUGH L. CAREY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 1965 
Mr. CAREY. Mr. Speaker, for many 
years the Bay Ridge community in 
Brooklyn has been considered one of the 
most underhospitalized areas in the city. 
One of the leaders in the struggle 
against sickness and suffering has been 
Victory Memorial Hospital, Bay Ridge's 
only nonprofit, voluntary hospital. This 
magnificent institution has proven ef-
fective and compassionate medical care 
for the sick and needy, of all races and 
creeds, for over 60 years. Founded in 
1904, Victory Memorial today serves well 
over 5,000 patients each year, and the 
quality of medicine and surgery practiced 
in the hospital is unexcelled anywhere. 
Throughout its history, Victory has re-
sponded to the call for expanded facil-
ities in the community and its new 62-
bed wing which opened in 1962 has been 
the key factor in enabling the hospital to 
meet the mounting demands for medical 
care in Bay Ridge. The importance of 
this new facility is reflected in the fact 
that in 1961 Victory Memorial admitted 
3,186 patients. By 1964 this figure in-
creased by 70 percent. 
Significantly, Victory Memorial also is 
providing a major medical service for the 
residents of Staten Island, now that the 
Verazana Bridge has linked that borough 
with Brooklyn. Scores of emergency as 
well as routine cases have been brought 
to the hospital !rout Staten Island, and 
in general, Victory is providing valuable 
assistance to a neighboring county_ 
Last month, at the hospital's annual 
meeting of the board of trustees, George 
A. Allan?, an attorney and distinguished 
civic leader, was elected to an unprece-
dented 16th consecutive 1-year term as 
president of Victory Memorial. As a re-
sult of his dedicated efforts and the close 
cooperation of the entire board and the 
professional and nonprofessional staffs, 
the hospital has witnessed steady and 
healthy growth over the past several 
years. 
I think it is noteworthy to point out 
that Victory's west wing was dedicated to 
the 134 south Brooklyn men killed in ac-
tion in World War I and that the east 
wing was dedicated in memory of those 
servicemen from Bay Ridge who gave 
their lives during World War II and the 
Korean conflict. 
It is in the name of these heroic men 
that Victory Memorial carries on its hu-
mane and essential programs in the un-
ceasing war against disease and travail. 
Harry Truman, Man of Decision 
=TENSION OF REMARKS 
HON. MICHAEL A. FEIGHAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 1965 
Mr. FEIGHAN. Mr. Speaker, the 
Cleveland Plain Dealer of April 13, 1965, 
carried an editorial tribute to Harry S. 
Truman which rates with the best ever 
written about the great man from Inde-
pendence, Mo. 
The theme of this editorial is that For-
mer President Truman grows in stature 
with the passage of time because his 
decisions in the years of world crisis im-
mediately following World War II have 
taken on added luster under the test of 
time. Few leaders have been fully ap-
preciated during their lifetime and many 
have been maligned by the second guess-
ers of history. But the swift passage of 
events, trying the mettle and courage of 
free people everywhere in our world, have 
adequately justified the Truman years in 
little more than a decade. 
Under leave previously granted, I in-
sert in the RECORD, the editorial: 
HARRY TRUMAN, MAN OF DECISION 
As time passes and as we see the recent 
past in fuller perspective, forhier President 
Harry S. Truman grows in stature. 
We realize that Mr. Truman built the very 
foundations of America's new, powerful for-
eign policy after World War II, and mobilized 
all the free world behind it. 
Tonight Mr. Truman will go to the Wal-
dorf-Astoria in New York City. There Free-
dom House will prcaent to him its Freedom 
Award on the 20th anniversary of his first day 
in the Presidency. 
It will be a reunion for the doughty Mis-
sourian. Most of his last Cabinet will be 
there. So will many men who played im-
portant parts in the dramatic and momen-
tous years, 1945 to 1952, when Mr. Truman 
and they were together winning a war, re-
building a world and trying to find paths to 
permanent peace,

No President since Mr. Truman has?made 
more than minor changes in the foreign 
policy for which he took full responsibility. 
The Truman doctrine, the Marshall plan, the 
Berlin airlift, the Korean InterVention, the 
revival of war-stricken nations?these are 
still the chief girders of America's free world 
leadership. 
On each of these policies Mr. Truman made 
the final decisions. So he did on dropping 
the nuclear bomb, too. 
Ile consulted others, but in the end, on 
the lonely spot of the ultimate decisionrnaker, 
he stuck to his resolute policy: "The buck 
stops here." 
The late Cleveland mayor, Tom L. Johnson, 
once said with rueful humor: A good ex-
ecutive is one who can make decisions, and 
is sometimes right." 
Mr. Truman made some of the most cru-
cial decisions any President, and any man in 
world history, has had to make. And we 
honor him because he was right so much 
of the time.

teers," while veiled and. "iffy," could imply 
that Soviet troops will man Soviet antiair-
craft missiles in North Vietnam, since sites 
for such weapons are apparently under prep-
aration. On the other hand, the communi-
que can be interpreted to be a threat, a 
warning, that may or may not be imple-
mented. 
But what the Soviet communique clearly 
is not is an affirmative answer to President 
Johnson's offer to negotiate. Until such an 
answer is forthcoming, the more or less well-
intentioned Americans who have been dem-
onstrating against their country's policy in 
Vietnam as a threat to peace are delivering 
their message to the wrong address. 
[From the New York Herald Tribune, Apr. 8, 
1965] 
JOHNSON RENEWS VIET PLEDGE: ALWAYS 
READY FOR, PEACE TALKS BUT "No POWER 
CAN FORCE Us OUT" 
(By Barnard L. Collier) 
Josussoia Cry/a TEIE.?In a somber Easter 
message, President Johnson warned yester-
day that "no human power is capable of 
forcing ut from Vietnam." But he still held 
out the offer of unconditional peace talks 
with the Communists "next week, tomorrow, 
or tonight." 
or After the President spoke, the Soviet Union 
announced that it will permit Russian "vol-
unteers" to fight in Vietnam if "U.S. aggres-
sion against the Democratic Republic of 
(North) Vietnam is intensified" and if 
Hanoi requests such aid. The Moscow state-
ment charged that the United States is "ex-
tending aggression and does not seek to ex-
plore avenues leading to a peaceful solution." 
The Soviet announcement in a Soviet-
North Vietnamese communique, appeared 
not to have been in response to the Presi-
dent's statement. 
The President spoke from the porch of the 
LBJ Ranch. He was as serious as reporters 
have seen him in months. 
"If the price of victory in Vietnam is blood 
and men, we are willing to pay that price," 
he declared. 
"They want no talk with us," he said 
grimly, summing up Communist reaction so 
far to his April 7 peace talk proposals. "But 
our offer stands. The window to peace is 
still open." 
In an implied appeal to America's allies 
and to neutrals to press for peace talks, he 
said he hoped that "a mounting crescendo 
of world opinion, weary of war, opposed to 
aggression, will finally find a way to reach 
the ears of those now deaf to calls for peace." 
Hours earlier, U.S. planes had lashed high-
ways and a railroad in North Vietnam for 
the second straight day?and South Viet-
namese planes dropped 100,000 leaflets carry-
ing the President's April 7 peace talk pro-
posals and his picture on the North Viet-
namese city of Dong Hoi. 
The Moscow communique, issued after 
talks between North Vietnamese Communist 
party secretary Le linen and Soviet officials, 
said Russia would "continue rendering all 
necessary assistance" to the North Vietnam-
ese against United States aggression. A 
Soviet antiaircraft missile site is reported 
under construction near Hanoi, Russians are 
in the country and high-altitude surface-to-
air (SAM) missiles are believed on the way. 
Moscow has spoken previously of "many 
volunteers"?a Communist euphemism for 
trained troops?anxious to fight in Vietnam 
but gave no indication whether they would 
be permitted to go. The new announce-
ment?with the provisos that the united 
States intensifies the war and North Vietnam 
asks for the help?was the furthest the 
Soviets have gone on the "volunteer" 
question. 
The communique specifically scoffed at the 
President's April 7 speech as showing that 
"the United States is still keeping a course

EXT sb OF REMARKS 
HON. JONATHAN B. BINGHAM 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 1965 
Mr, BINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, the-
New York Herald Tribune has once 
again contributed distinguished report-
ing and thoughtful, sober -comment on 
the Vietnam situation. On April 18, 
Barnard L. Collier filed a story from 
Johnson City, Tex., which vividly de-
scribes the President's delivery to the 
press of his Easter message, and the fol-
lowing day the Herald Tribune com-
mented on the situation editorially. 
Under leave to revise and extend my re-
marks, I include these two articles: 
From the New York Herald Tribune, 
Apr. 19, 19651 
BRICKBATS THROUGH THE WINDOW 
The United States, in President Johnson's 
words, "tried to open a window to -peace." 
But the Communists responded, much as 
Communist-inspired mobs have responded 
to American overtures, by heaVing brickbats 
through the window. On the very day that 
Mr. Johnson was repeating his offer of un-
conditional negotiations. the 'Soviet Union 
announced that Mr. Johnson "does not seek 
to explore avenues leading to a peaceful so-
lution of the Vietnamese problem." 
What are those avenues? The Commu-
nists of Red China, North Vietnam and the 
Soviet Union knead only a Single avenue: 
one which leads the United States out of 
Vietnam. And that avenue, Mr. Johnson 
has again and again made plain, the United 
State will not tread?until a peaceful solu-
tion is reached. 
In other words, the Communists do not 
want unconditional negotiations but un-
conditional surrender of the Saigon govern-
ment. The United States, for Its part, can-
not sacrifice the people who have been fight-
ing on against the imported revolt that is 
intended to bring about the end of their 
independence. Once that independence is 
assured, the United States is prepared to 
leave South Vietnam. 
The Soviet communique, after the Moscow 
talks between the Rnssians end the North 
Vietnamese, leaves the suspicion that the 
Soviet Union will take a ham'. in escalating 
the war. The reference to Soviet "volun-
for the extension of acts of aggression and 
does not seek to explore avenues leading to 
a peaceful solution of the Vietnamese prob-
lem." 
In Washington, Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk announced that the 'United States had 
"thought long and soberly" about suspending 
the raids on North Vietnam that began Feb-
ruary 7 but had concluded that such action 
"would only encourage the aggressor and 
dishearten our friends." 
Prime Ministers Lester Pearson of Canada 
and Lal Bahadur Shastri of India, among 
Others, have suggested that the North Viet-
namese might respond by relaxing their 
guerrilla war if the raids were suspended. 
But Mr. Rusk, in a statement, said that "we 
have tried publicly and privately to find 
out if this would be the result, and there 
has been no response." 
President Johnson in his message expressed 
regret "that the necessities of war have 
forced us to bomb North Vietnam." But 
he emphasized that the raids have been di-
rected at military and strategic targets, "at 
concrete and steel and not human life." 
"I understand the feelings of those who 
regret that we must undertake air attacks," 
Mr. Johnson said. "I share those feelings. 
"But the compassion of this country, and 
the world, must go out to the men, women 
and children who are killed and crippled 
by the Vietcong every day in South Vietnam. 
The outrage of this country, and the world, 
must be visited on those who explode their 
bombs in cities and Villages, ripping the 
bodies of the helpless." 
He added soberly: 
"Let us remember that the people of South 
Vietnam, and the Americans who share their 
struggle, suffer because they are attacked?
not because they are attackers." 
The President, who was flanked by Mrs. 
Johnson and Defense Secretary Robert Mc-
Namara, began his message by saying: "This 
has been a week of tragedy, disappointment 
and progress." 
"On this, of all weekends, we must feel 
a deep sadness that men must still die and 
families still be left homeless in the brutal-
ity of war," he said. He expressed sorrow 
for the death of Joseph W. Grainger, the U.S. 
aid official whose murder by his Vietcong 
captors was diselosed last week, and for "all 
the others, on both sides, who found this 
week to be their last." 
A strong theme of the message was the 
President's expressed disappointment?al 
the rejection of his April 7 proposal for un-
conditional peace talks on Vietnam, at the 
continued loss of American and Vietnamese 
lives and at the angry censure, in some parte 
of the world and among some Americans, o 
his orders to bomb North Vietnam. 
The April 7 proposals have been denounced 
by Hanoi, Peiping and Moscow. Red Chine. 
and North Vietnam also turned down visit; 
to their capitals by former British Foreign 
Secretary Patrick Gordon Walker, on a diplo - 
matic sounding mission, and indicated to 
United Nations Secretary General U Thant 
that visits by Mr. Thant would serve um; 
purpose. 
"We tried to open a window to peace," Mr. 
Johnson said, "only to be met with tired 
names and slogans?and a refusal to talk. 
"They want no talks with us?no talk with 
a distinguished Briton?and no talk with the 
United Nations. They want no talk at all--
so far. But our offer stands. we mean ev-
ery word of it. 
"The window to peace is still open. We 
are still ready for unconditional discussion. 
We will impose no conditions, of any kind, 
on any government willing to talk. Nor will 
we accept any. On this basis we are ready 
to begin discussion next week, tomorrow or 
tonight." 
Mr. Johnson ended on a dead-serious note. 
"It is not easy to engage in a struggle whoae 
beginning is obscure and whose end is not

in sight," he said. "Peace, like war, requires 
patience and the courage to go on despite 
discouragement. 
"Yet we must go on. For there is a world 
to lose, a world of peace, of order and of ex-
panding promise for all who live_ therein." 
He then 11111rinnred "thank You" to the as-
sembled reporters, walked over to put his 
arin around Mrs. Johnson and kiss her On 
the forehead and disappeared into the ranch-
house. Reporters could remember no other 
time when he had, not lingered after a for-
mal statement to banter with the press. 
Helicopter Service in New York 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. LEONARD FARBSTEIN 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 1965 
- Mr. FARPSTEIN. Mr. Speaker, on 
January 24 the President's budget mes-
sage called for an end to Federal sub-
sidies in support of passenger helicopter 
operations throughout the country. I 
question whether such immediate with-
drawal of support is the wisest Move at 
this point in the development of heli-
copter service. 
To quote a New York Times editorial 
of February 6: 
Any Government subsidy must, of course, 
be submitted to unremitting review. But it 
would be most unfortunate and shortsighted 
t? stop the subsidy of helicopter passenger 
service at this stage. For one thing, the Pan 
Am heliport itself, because of its great con-
venience, should encourage an immediate 
Increase in passenger use to make trips to 
airports in 5 to 10 minutes that might re-
quire an hour or more by highway. If, as 
likely, the proposed new fourth major air-
port in the area is situated even further 
away, the helicopter's time advantage will 
be enhanced. 
While the helicopter service would 
probably be unable to exist this year or 
next without support, it seems that the 
great increase in recent years of public 
support and usage points to a time in 
the very near future when such service 
would be able to pay for itself. New 
York Airways when it started its opera-
tions 12 years ago carried approximately 
25 passengers daily. Today that figure 
is up to 1,000 daily. As recently as 1958 
subsidies received were 72.9 percent of 
all revenues received by New York Air-
ways. In 1964 other commercial income 
had grown so that only 45 percent of all 
revenues came from Government sub- - 
sidy. In 1965, this will drop to 34.8 per-
cent and in subsequent years it will fall 
to 23.6 percent, finally in 1970 to 3.5 per-
cent. 
The Civil Aeronautics Board has pro-
posed a plan for ending subsidy which 
takes account of this attenuating need 
as well as the requirement of Govern-
ment economy. This program would 
gradually phase out aid to the heliports 
between now and 1970 and offer only the 
barest subsidy needed to-match increas-
ing profits. 
I support this plan because I believe 
it will enable, the needed convenience of 
helicopter service to survive, yet will call 
for the minimum of Federal funds neces-
sary to do this. 
We must remember that we have a 
large investment in this service. The 
Federal Government has spent $46.7 mil-
lion in the past 11 years in fostering the 
growth of the program. To cut off aid 
now would be to nip it in the bud and 
render our previous investment useless. 
The Civil Aeronautics Board program 
would call for a small amount of addi-
tional funds to complete our investment 
and would allow that investment to reap 
the dividend of self-sufficient service 
that was our original goal and which 
promises to be an imminent reality. 
Partners of Alliance 
? EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
? HON. CARLTON R. SICKLES 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 1965 
Mr. SICKLES. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to bring to the attention of my col-
leagues a recent account of an interest-
ing program undertaken between my 
own State of Maryland and the State of 
Rio, Brazil. 
Senor Ronald Hees and Senor Durval 
Goncalves arrived in Maryland on 
March 20 as representatives of the Part-
ners of Alliance program, jointly spon-
sored by the State Department and the 
Agency for International Development. 
This was a followup to a trip taken to 
Brazil by three members of the Maryland 
Partners Committee. These two men 
from the State of Rio came to assist in 
the promotion and development of the 
partners relationship in Maryland and 
to stimulate interest in the many-areas 
of assistance and exchange in which pro-
grams are underway. 
Between March 20 and April 3, Senors 
Hees and Goncalves covered a tremen-
dous amount of territory. They visited 
various secondary schools, the University 
of Maryland, several business establish-
ments, and hospitals. They also took a 
trip to the Eastern Shore and to West-
minster, appeared on two Baltimore 
television programs and attended a din-
ner given by Gov. J. Millard Tawes. 
As a result of their numerous visits, 
Senor Hees and Senor Goncalves were 
provided with insights into problems 
which are acute in Maryland as well as 
in Rio. The people of Maryland also 
gained an insight into Rio's problems 
and responded immediately. For exam-
ple, after meeting with the two men, 
students of Canton Junior High School 
in Baltimore donated a check to the pro-
gram. The students of the University 
of Maryland, too, have responded by in-
itiating an exchange under which they 
are going to attend the University of 
Rio to undertake a program of improv-
ing the level of education and health of 
slum dwellers. In turn, a school in Rio 
is being named for Governor Tawes. 
These two Brazilian visitors estab-
lished many valuable contacts so that 
the Partners of Alliance program will 
A2021 
proceed with Increased effectiveness. It 
is evident that an even closer relation-
ship has been cemented between these 
two great communities. 
At this time, I would like to insert into 
the RECORD two articles from the Balti-
more, Md., Sun of March 31, 1965, con-
crening this program: 
RIO PICKS TAWES FOR SCHOOL TITLE 
ANNAPOLIS, April 10.?Governor Tawes has 
been advised that a school is being named for 
him in the State of Rio de Janeiro. 
Rio is a sister State of Maryland in the 
Partners of Alliance program initiated by the 
State Department. 
Gov. Paulo Torres of the State of Rio ad-
vised the Maryland Governor of the honor 
planned for him, Tawes had given a dinner 
in Annapolis recently honoring two members 
of the State of Rio Partners Committee who 
were visiting, Maryland. 
Governor Tawes expressed appreciation in 
a letter to Governor Torres and said he hoped 
the naming of a Rio school for a Maryland 
citizen will "help to cement the close rela-
tionship" being developed between the two 
States. 
STATE GROTJP Abs BRAZIL? -MARYLAND DOL-
LARS HELP PROVIDE SLUM AREA SCHOOLS 
Maryland dollars are helping put slum 
children in school in the State of Rio in 
Brazil, a Brazilian visitor said yesterday. 
This is one of a number of projects aided 
by Marylanders in the Partners of Alliance 
program, sponsored by the Agency for Inter-
national Development. Maryland is 1 of 20 
States which has been linked up with a Latin 
American counterpart. 
At a press conference, Ronald Hees, 33, said 
the enlargement of one school and the build-
ing of another in the slums of Niteroy, the 
capital of the State of Rio, has enabled many 
slum children to attend school. 
TOTAL OF $1,300 GIVEN 
Money to help enlarge the one and help 
build the other came from the Maryland 
committee. A total of $1,300 was given. 
The chairman of the Maryland committee, 
appointed by Governor Tawes, is Albert 
Berney, president of Hamburger's Men Store, 
Other officers who attended the press con-
ference are Wallace Lanahan, vice chairman, 
president of Stein Bros. & Boyce, investment 
bankers: and Julian Stein, secretary, a public 
relations counsel. 
Mr. Stein said that the Maryland help was 
designed to "help the Brazilians help them-
selves."

On that occasion, the Milwaukee Press 
Club presented its 1965 award for com-
munity service to Mr. Robert A. IJihlein, 
Jr., president of the Jos. Schlitz Brewing 
Co. 
Mr. IJihlein has richly merited this rec-
ognition for his many contributions to 
the city of Milwaukee and the State of 
Wisconsin. Among specific civic deeds 
has been the outstanding support which 
he, his family, and his firm have given 
to Milwaukee's proposed Center for the 
Performing Arts. Further, his sponsor-
ship of the annual Fourth of July parade 
has made Milwaukee the place to be in 
the United States on Independence Day. 
In addition to the citation presented to 
Mr. Ulhlein, awards were presented to 
newspaper men and women in the 00111-
munity for outstanding journalistic 
achievement. 
In order to bring the accontlishrnents 
of Mr. Uihlein and the members of the 
Milwaukee press to the attention of my 
colleagues, I wish to insert in the RECORD 
at this point excerpts from news stories 
on the Gridiron dinner which appeared

specifically nientiOned the downtown urban 
renewal underway and new businesses which 
have started. 
"Wisconsin, and more particularly Mil-
waukee, is on the way 50 great things. It's 
fun to be a Member of a great community 
like Milwaukee," he concluded. 
Inhlein, 49, was honored for his contri-
butions to sports and cultural activities as 
well as for his role in the brewing industry.

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN M. MURPHY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 1965 
Mr. MURPHY of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, the Brown Bomber Social and 
Athletic Club of Staten Island, New 
York, N.Y., held their annual dinner 
on Sunday, April 25, and the proceeds of 
this dinner will be donated to charitable 
organizations. 
Mr. Christopher Moody was chairman 
of the dinner and justice of the criminal 
courts, Alfred J. Cawse, was the recipi-
ent of the achievement award given each 
year to an outstanding citizen for his 
contributions to the Borough of Rich-
mond. George "Timmy" Allen, senior

Councilman Robert G. Lindsay and Jus-
tice Frank Paulo, surrogate of Richmond 
County, were other guests of honor. 
Borough president, Albert V. Maniscalco, 
expressed the greetings of the city of New 
York and introduced me as principal 
speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, under leave to extend my 
remarks in the RECORD, I include my 
address: 
REMARKS OF HON. JOHN M. MTJRPHY BEFORE 
THE BROWN BOMBER SOC/AL Cave, APRIL 25 
Ladies and gentleraen, tonight, I want to 
talk to you briefly about education; but don't 
get in a panic and start looking for the 
exits; I'm not here as a professor?a calling, 
incidentally, that someone once described as 
getting paid to study the sleeping habits of 
students?but I do want to leave a few 
thoughts with you on education as an oppor-
tunity and as a challenge. 
As you know, only 2 weeks ago President 
Johnson?once a teacher himself?signed 
into law the $1.3 billion aid-to-education 
bill, the greatest single advance in the wur 
on ignorance that this country has ever made. 
It was an honor and a privilege for me to 
contribute my vote to the passage of this 
bill through Congress. 
As the President said when he affixed his 
signature to this historic measure, "It will 
bring better education to millions of dis-
advantaged youth who need it most; put the 
best educational equipment and innovations 
within reach of all students; advance the 
technology of teaching and the training of 
teachers, and provide incentives for those 
who wish to learn at every stage along the 
road to learning." 
Specifically, the bill is aimed at breaking 
the cycle of ignorance and poverty by giving 
special help to children from low-income 
families. Its main section authorizes the 
grant of $1.06 billion to the States for the 
benefit of about 5 million children in fami-
lies earning under $2,000 a year. 
It will provide additional millions to aid 
school libraries and buy publicly approved 
textbooks for children in public, private and 
parochial schools; to start a 5-year program 
for the establishment of educational and 
cultural centers such as science laboratories 
and reading clinics, and to aid educational 
research and training designed to improve 
the quality of teaching in grade and high 
schools. 
But let me put it in human terms: 
We Americans always pride ourselves on 
the availability and quality of our public 
education. For most of us, it is available and 
it is of good quality. But to hundreds of 
thousands of families in areas where poverty 
was and is a bitter reality?and these fami-
lies and areas know no color line and no 
State lines?public education often is just 
barely available and too often of substandard 
quality. 
For instance, recent educational research 
has shown that alarming numbers of these 
disadvantaged children are hopelessly behind, 
scholastically, by the time they struggle into 
the third or fourth grade. They must have 
preschool training in order to start on even

WefAile Wire Mesh, 6 by 6-10/10, $135 per 
short ton, fob, 
Common quality 10-gage steel wire, $160 
per short ton, fob, mill. 
The eminent steel economist, Prof. Walter 
Adams, of Michigan State University, recently 
said that without the independent wire draw-
er "We W9u.lfi have an oligopolistic managed 
economy (in the steel wire industry). The 
persistence of the independents is necessary, 
in the public interest, as the only means?
short of regulation or public ownership?of 
injecting a suitable measure of fluidity into 
the steel price structure." 
It is apparent from this brief analysis of 
the steel wire and wire products industry 
that the vertical oligopoly power of the in-
tegrated steel producers has tended to keep 
prices artificially high, which, in turn, has 
contributed to this Nation's adverse balance-
of-payments position by forcing independ-
ents to buy imported steel. 
The independent wire drawers have dis-
played direct, vigorous, and dynamic com-
petitive effort?this competitive effort is in 
the public interest of maintaining a free 
competitive marketplace. If the integrated 
Steel producers had followed the example of 
the major auto producers by meeting import 
competition directly in the marketplace 
rather than running to Washington, there 
would have been no need for the independ-
ents to use imported steel, and the industry, 
the public, and the Nation would have 
benefited. 
The Roosevelt bill would require fair pric-
ing behavior in dual distributionindustries. 
The Roosevelt bill is not an indirect subsidy 
for inefficient independent producers; in the 
fabricating segment of the steel industry 
scientific evidence proves that independent 
fabricators one one-hundredth the size of 
their integrated rivals have been capable of 
competing effectively with the giants?when-
ever allowed to do so in free and open 
Competition. 
The independent wire drawers and fabri-
cators do not want special favors or subsidies 
from the r ederal government?all we ask is 
preservation of the marketplace?free from 
Squeeze tactics and monopolistic sharp-
shooting.

nam Policy Statement 
EXTENSION OF REM 
OF 
HON. THADDEUS J. DIJLSKI 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 1965 
Mr. DULSKI. Mr. Speaker, the John 
R. Pillion chapter of Young Americans 
for Freedpin, in Buffalo, N.Y., endorses 
the strong position taken by President 
Johnson in dealing with the Vietcong 
Communists. 
In support of the President's action, 
the Members of this chapter have cir-
culated petitions in Buffalo which al-
ready include more than 1,000 signatures. 
These petitions, together with the Viet-
nam policy statement of the Young 
Americans for Freedom, are being for-
warded to the President so that he can 
be apprised of this group's efforts in sup-
Port of the course he is pursuing in this 
troubled yea. 
Under leave to extend mY remarks, 
their Vietnam policy statement follows: 
VIETNAM POLICY STATEMENT 
Young Americans for Freedom is proud of 
President Johnson's strong and effective ac-
tions against the Communists in Vietnam. 
There are many influential parties exerting 
maximum pressures on the President to re-
treat and negotiate in Vietnam. In this 
morning's newspaper, we read of Democratic 
Senator J. WILT,IAIVI Foingionr, of Arkansas, 
chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee, urging the President to 
temporarily halt air strikes against North 
Vietnam because he is "pessimistic about 
the outcome of the situation in Vietnam if 
there is no attempt at negotiations." This is 
not an isolated case. Students and Com-
munists have marched on Washington to 
picket the White House; college professors 
and university senates have sponsored rallies 
and marathon teach-ins urging with-
drawal; Senators WAYNE MORSE, Of Oregon, 
and ERNEST GRUENING, of Alaska, have de-
livered vehement tirades against the Presi-
dent's southeast Asian policy of contain-
ment; Senators FRANK CHURCH, of Idaho, and 
GEORGE MCGOVERN, of-South Dakota, have 
made severe attacks on Mr. Johnson; and 
other powerful agitators continue a furious 
onslaught of pe-ace-at-any-price propaganda. 
Moreover, such irresponsible conduct is in-
creasing at a shocking pace. 
Americans must assure Mr. Johnson that 
he is not alone in the cause of freedom. It 
is our patriotic and moral duty to stand by 
our President in this hour of great crisis. 
We must not relent our traditional duty 
to defend liberty. We must not capitulate 
even in the face of defeat. We must not suc-
cumb to threats of a full-scale war. We 
must not forsake the people of southeast 
Asia to the barbarous invasions of the At-
tilic Red Chinese. We must not abandon 
the South Vietnamese to the inhumane 
atrocities of communism. 
The American people's will to fight for 
freedom?not only for ourselves, but for all 
the people of the world?has been demon-
strated in the past and must be reasserted 
now. 
Outstanding anti-Communists such as 
Senator THOMAS Done, of Connecticut, and 
our own Congressman THADDEUS J. DuLsio 
are to be congratulated for their stanch and 
resolute positions in this crucial situation. 
As they know and have repeatedly said, we 
must win?we can win?and we will win.

California State Senator Introduces Res-
olutions for Study of Nature's Destruc-
tive Forces 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. GEORGE P. MILLER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 1965 
Mr. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, recently, 
Gov. Edmund G. Brown, of California, 
gave a speech in which he suggested that 
the great ingenuity and resources of the 
aerospace team in California should be 
channeled to provide some sources or at 
least unravel some of the unknowns con-
cerning the destructive forces of nature 
such as storms: earthquakes, fires, and 
floods. 
State Senator Alvin C. Weingand re-
cently announced that he plans to in-
troduce resolutions in the State legisla-
ture to accomplish this purpose. 
I am pleased to insert in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD Senator Weingand's press 
release which indicates the great promise 
of this approach to some of the prob-
lems which have plagued mankind for 
many years. 
The press release follows: 
CALIFORNIA STATE SENATOR INTRODUCES RESO-
LUTIONS FOR STUDY OF NATURES DESTRUCTIVE 
FORCES 
Senator Alvin C. Weingand announced to-
day he will introduce resolutions calling for 
studies by California aerospace firms into 
the mysteries of the destructive forces of 
nature?storm, earthquake, fire, and flood. 
Senator Weingand, Democrat, of Santa 
Barbara, said the legislation represents an 
expansion of the State's pioneering efforts to 
direct California aerospace industry talent 
to pressing State problems. 
It would authorize preliminary feasibility 
studies into the causes, control, and preven-
tion of natural phenomena as well as into 
the long-range forecasting of State recrea-
tional needs. 
'I believe that if the genius of California's 
space age talent can find ways to rocket a 
man to the moon, it can also begin to give 
us some answers to help us control the de-
structive forces of nature," Senator Wein-
gand said. 
"Despite the marvelous accomplishments 
of modern science, we are still all but help-
less before these natural phenomena. 
"The toll in California alone in lives and 
property from forest fires, floods, and earth-
quakes is appallingly high year after year. 
"I am hopeful that the preliminary in-
vestigations my resolutions would authorize 
will suggest some answers. I am hopeful 
they will help us move toward realizing man's 
ancient dream of truly mastering the ele-
ments and controlling them for his own 
benefit." 
Governor Brown commended the senator 
"for his interest in this highly important 
undertaking." 
The Governor said studies under contracts 
already let into four other problem areas?
transportation, information collection and 
control, waste management, and criminal 
control?"are proceeding extremely well." 
"They are proving that the systems anal-
ysis approach can be applied to unsolved 
and expensive problems here at home, and 
they are justifying my original hope in pro-
posing them," the Governor said. 
"Our aim in ,these undertakings is two-
fold. We want to mount a more effective 
attack on some of the problems we face in 
California and the Nation that have too long 
defied the necessary scientific or engineering 
solutions. At the same time, we can assist 
the State's aerospace industry to convert 
part of its activities to nondefense pursuits. 
"Our hope ultimately is that California, 
which now dominates the aerospace scene 
nationally, will become the research and 
development center of the Nation in an 
economy turning increasingly to peaceful 
pursuits." 
The five resolutions authorize the admin-
istrator of the resources agency to coordi-
nate the efforts of agency departments in 
cooperation with the aerospace industry to 
investigate and seek solutions to the various 
problems. 
Excerpts from the resolutions: 
On earthquake cause and prediction: 
"California has experienced a large number 
of earthquakes, three of which were of a 
general magnitude similar to the 1964 Good 
Friday earthquake in Alaska. 
"The occurrence of an earthquake of this 
general magnitude in a densely populated

area of California would be catastrophic not 
only to man's works, but to man himself, 
physically and psychologically. 
"Many disciplines of knowledge should be 
directed to the study of earthquake cause 
and prediction and on man's proper response 
to the knowledge so developed." 
On forest fire control and prevention 
"The problems of wild land fire prevention 
and control have been greatly intensified dur-
ing the past 20 years by California's popula-
tion growth and economic eimansion result-
ing in human use of the 37 million acres of 
wild land and timber. 
"Completed research projects lead to the 
conclusion that direct study of prodUction 
relatiOnships appear to be an essential pre-
requisite for further progress toward de-
termining proper economic production goals 
for fire prevention and fire control pro-
grams, operations, and organization." 
On flood control planning: "The great 
floods of December 1964, caused economic 
and personal damage to vast areas of the 
State, which demonstrate the need for im-
proved methods of forecasting and control-
ling floods. 
"Present Criteria and procedures utilized 
in evaluating the justification of expendi-
tures for flood control works may not prop-
erly account for the long-range impact of a 
major flood on the economy of an area." 
Edward R. Murrow 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. DONALD J. IRWIN 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, .1965 
Mr. IRWIN. Mr. Speaker, I call the 
attention of my colleagues to the follow-
ing article in today's New York Times, a 
fitting tribute to an unusual man, Ed-
ward R. Murrow. 
The article follows: 
EDWARD R. MURROW, BROADCASTER, AND 
FORMER USIA HEAD, DIES 
Edward R. Minrow, whose independence 
and incisive reporting brought heightened 
journalistic stature to radio and television, 
died yesterday at his home in Pawling, N.Y., 
at the age of 57. 
The former head of the U.S. Information 
Agency had been battling cancer since Octo-
ber 1963. He had been in and out of the 
hospital ever since, and death came 3 weeks 
after he was discharged from New York Hos-
pital for the last time. 
The ever-present cigarette (he smoked 60 
to 70 a day), the matter-of-fact baritone 
voice and the high-domed, worried, lopsided 
face were the trademarks of the radio re-
porter who became internationally famous 
during World War II with broadcasts that 
started, "This [pause] is London." 
Later, on television, his series of news 
documentaries, "See It Now," on the Colum-
bia Broadcasting System from 1951 to 1958, 
set the standard for all television documen-
taries on all networks. 
President Johnson, on learning of Mr. 
Murrow'S death, said that all Americans "feel 
a sense of loss in the death of Edward R. 
Murrow." 
He was, the President said, a "gallant. 
fighter" who had "dedicated his life as a 
newsman and, as a public official to the 
unrelenting search for truth." 
Mr. Murrow died at his home on the rolling 
hills of his 280-acre Pawling farm shortly 
before noon. 
He is survived by his widow, the former 
Janet Huntington Brewster; a son, Charles 
Casey Murrow, a freshman at Yale Univer-
sity; and two brothers, L. V. Murrow, of 
Washington, and Dewey Murrow, of Spokane, 
Wash. 
' A funeral service will be held on Friday 
at 2 p.m. at St. James Episcopal Church, 
865 Madison Avenue, between 71st and 72d 
Streets. Burial is to be announced. 
In many years of receiving honors and 
tributes, the most recent was conferred on 
Mr. Murrow on March 5, 1965, by Queen 
Elizabeth II, who named him an honorary 
Knight Commander of the Order of the 
British Empire. 
On September 14, 1964, President Johnson 
awarded him the Medal of Freedom, the 
highest civilian honor a President can confer 
on an American citizen. 
Mr. Murrow's career with the Columbia 
Broadcasting Co. spanned 25 years. It ended 
in January 1961 when President Kennedy 
named him head of the U.S. Information 
Agency. 
In October 1963.a malignant tumor made 
the removal Of his left lung necessary, and 
3 months later he resigned as head of the 
Agency. Last November, Mr. Murrow again 
underwent surgery. 
BROUGHT CONTROVERSY INTO HOMES 
Mr. Morrow achieved international distinc-
tion in broadcasting, first as a radio corre-
spondent reporting from London in World 
War II and then as a pioneer television jour-
nalist opening the home screen to the stimu-
lus of controversy. No other figure in broad-
cast news left such a strong stamp on both 
media. 
In an industry often given to rule by com-
mittee, Mr. Murrow was always recognized as 
an individual, whether in the front lines of 
the war, in the executive conferences of a 
network or, in what he enjoyed most, in 
planning his next story. His independence 
was reflected in doing what he thought had 
to be done on the air and worrying later 
about the repercussions among sponsors, 
viewers, and individual stations. The fruits 
of his determination are shared today by 
newsmen at all networks; they enjoy a free-
dom and latitude not yet won by others work-
ing in the medium. 
Mr. Murrow was a realist about fame. He 
could not walk a block in New York without 
pedestrians turning for a look or a bore try-
ing to strike up a conversation. But in the 
context of television he knew the value of 
adulation. "It can get a lot of things done," 
he once remarked. That was his concern. 
In the last war, Mr. 1Vlurrow conveyed the 
facts with a compelling precision. But he 
went beyond the reporting of the facts. By 
describing What he saw in visual detail, he 
sought to convey the moods and feelings of 
-war. 
Had a London street just been bombed 
out? The young correspondent was soon 
there in helmet, gray flannel trousers and 
sport coat, quietly describing everything he 
saw against :the urgent sound patterns of 
rescue operations. 
Or he would be in a plane on a combat 
mission, broadcasting live on the return leg 
and describing the bombing he had watched 
as "orchestrated hell." 
He flew 25 missions in the war, despite the 
opposition of top executives of the Columbia 
Broadcasting System in New York, who re-
garded him as too valuable to be so regularly 
risked. In the endless German air raids on 
London, his office was bombed out three times 
but he escaped injury. 
Mr. Murrow, never fevered or high-blown, 
had the gift of, dramatizing whatever he re-
ported. He clid so by understatement and by 
a calm, terse, highly descriptive radio style. 
Sometimes there was a sort of metallic 
poetry in his words. 
"BLOOD ON THE PANES" 
In one memorable broadcast he said that 
as he "walked home at 7 in the 'morntitg, the 
windows in the West End were red with re-
flected fire, and the raindrops were like blood 
on the panes." 
For a dozen years, as radio's highest paid 
newscaster, he was known by voice alone to 
millions of his countrymen. "This (pause) 
Is London," was his matter-of-fact saluta-
tion, `delivered in a baritone voice tinged 
with an echo of doom. Later it was, "This 
(pause) is the news." 
Then television added to the distinctive 
voice an equally distinctive face, with high-
domed forehead and deep-set, serious eyes. 
Mr. Murrow's casual television manner was 
superimposed on a quite obvious native 
tension. 
As the armchair interviewer on "Person to 
Person," Mr. Murrow carried out a gentle-
manly electronic invasion of the homes of 
scores of celebrities in the 1950's from Sophie 
Tucker through the evangelist Billy Graham 
The darkly handsome Mr. Murrow, his 
brow knotted and two fingers holding his 
ever-present cigarette, sat in the studio fac-
ing a greatly magnified television image of 
his subjects at home. He would make what 
one writer called "urbane small talk" with 
them, generously admiring their children and 
perhaps inquiring exactly where that hand-
some vase on the side table had been ac-
quired. It was not momentous, but it was 
interesting. 
SERIES OF DOCUMENTARIES 
From 1951 to 1958 Mr. Murrow also did a, 
series of news documentaries under the title 
"See It Now." In the 1953-54 season the tele-
cast studied the various aspects of the im-
pact of the emotional and political phenom-
enon known as McCarthyism. 
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican, 
of Wisconsin, was then conducting his cru-
sade against alleged Communist influence. 
Some regarded it as a hard, honest search 
for subversives by a zealous patriot; others 
saw it as a demagogic opportunism, the ex-
ploitation of a real issue for the purpose of 
gaining political influence by intimidation. 
The debate over Senator McCarthy, was 
supercharged with emotion and fervent be
Since commercial television thrives by 
giving little offense, the medium had given 
the matter gingerly treatment. 
Mr. Murrow and his long-time coeditor, 
Fred W. Friendly, broke this pattern deci-
sively on Wednesday evening, March 10, 1954. 
Using film clips that showed the Senator to 
no good advantage, the two men offered a 
provocative examination of the man and his 
methods. 
The program, many thought, had a devas-
tating effect. McCarthyism did lose public 
force in succeeding months. "The timing 
was right and the instrument powerful," Mr. 
Murrow said to the telecast later. 
DECIDED TO GO AHEAD 
Jack Gould, television critic of the New 
York Times, wrote that "Mr. Murrow decided 
to go ahead with the program at a time when 
passions in the broadcasting industry were 
running wild on the issue of Communist 
sympathizers and dupes. It was the auton-
omy of the Murrow-Friendly operation, often 
the source of internal controversy within CBS 
that got the vital show on the air." 
That autonomy was a singular thing in 
network broadcasting. It was based on Mr. 
Morrow's immense prestige, initially gained 
when he became one of the first radio war 
correspondents and built a superb news staff 
for CBS in Europe. 
Mr. Murrow, one writer said, "has achieved 
a position at CBS that is outside, and basi-
cally antithetical to, the corporate structure 
of authority" and he thereby enjoyed a large 
measure of "freedom from authority of all

that 'cbiniali3i's loss of business to the TBA

major producers. We' turn to tit _Docket 
No. 6486, ciate,d March 9.,,1961, in the matter 
of Goodyear's.. TBA contract With Atlantic

. on 'April 24, 1964, upheld FTC's case and 
denied Goodyear's 'petition to set aside the 
Governnients ,order to break the TBA con-
tract. 
"The success enjoyed by Goodyear * * in 
sellina to Atlantic has been, purchased at the 
eXpense of competing TBA suppliers,"? FTC 
? abted. The "competing supplier" in this case 
happ,ened to be Lee, 
Retigning to the docket we read this., de-
seription of events Which ied to Lee's loss of 
busin4ss (between 1948 and 1950 Atlantic's 
sales a 'MA was $2.1 to Goodyear, 
the Major company which now has an option 
to buy the smaller company. 
"Sometime in ,932, Atlantic eommeneed to 
prirchase 'Lee tires from the, Lee Rubber & 
Tire Corp., and to resell such tires to its 
1.vlieleSale and retail petroleurn,distributors." 
Note that under this plan Atlantic bought, 
warehoused, shipped, and sold the tires to its 
outlet. Thus.,the Oil marketer Was =vet-
, ing th the market by performing a distinct 
eCenomie service. And note too ht an At-
lantic spokesman commenting on the ar-
rangement with Lee, said: "We receive a good 
gross margin in keeping with the duties left 
to us." 
Also note that Atlantic's dealers, were sat-
isfied with the arrangement. The oil firm 
conducted a brand-preference Survey among 
its dealers in 1948 and 1949 and grit following 
reSult; "67 percent of the Atlantie dealers 
contacted indicated, that, they would rather 
obtain. their 1'RA-requirements from Several 
sources rather than a _single `source, the' prin-
cipal reason given therefor being price ad-
vantages and the variety of brancts. r - 
Notwithstanding, negotiations for exclu-
sive TBA contract between Atlantic and. the 
major tire producers were,set in motion. one 
result was that operations under the so-
called "sales commission" plan with Good-
year commenced on an experimental basis in 
Atlantic's Newark, N.J., section in June 1950. 
It proved successful to Atlantic. and Good-
year. But not for Lee and other small 
compelitors. 
- Subsequently, Atlantic gave Lee the boot 
and took on the Goodyear TBA line. An At-
lantic official boasted to his superior: "We 
are relieved of the purchasing function * * * 
do not warehouse or deliver any merchandise, 
we are not involved in the handling of ac-
counts, we do not iseue catalogs or price 
books nor do we have to provide point-of-
sale promotion helps." All that Atlantic 
had to do, he commented, was to, "assist 
in the, selling job as Well as in the dealer 
training and merchandising task, and for 
this effort recelVe a coniMilssichWhich .* 
has been, ayeraging well over 9 percent." 
Lee vigorously protested the loss of its 
right to compete in an open market for :this 
business, but in vain. FTC puts it this way: 
"The sales gain accruing to Goodyear * * 
was accompanied by a corresponding loss in 
sales by Lee" even though Lee had opened 
new.. factory branches in Hartford, Conn., 
,PraVidgace, R.r., and Syracuse, N.Y., to,ac-
, COmniOdate, tins , Within nine 
rrionth,s after Atlantic began sponsoring 
Goodyear TEA Lee dourfully reported that 
only "25 percent of the Atlantic business 
will be salvaged this year (1951)." 
Lee sales. *rote bitter letters to 
Atlantic complaining of the methods em-
ployed to grease the shift from Lee to Good,.. 
year' di Atlantic's outlets.-But these mis-
sales were exercises in futiity. 
Another unrewarding dividend derived 
from such TBA agreements must be pointed 
out, and that is the devasting effect they 
have on smaller tire producers who need to 
build a strong network of distrbution 
through independent dealers. You can 
assess their chances at success in, this vital 
area when you consider that even the tire 
distributors of the majors with TBA ties are 
eliminated in competing for the business of 
"captured" gas stations. FTC illustrates this 
point when it charged that "competition 
among Goodyear wholesalers for the busi-
ness of Atlantic accounts has been eliminated 
through the assignment of each Atlantic ac-
count to a designated supply point." While 
there were 1,155 Goodyear dealers in the 
Atlantic marketing territories assigned to 
Goodyear only 128 of these dealers were 
tapped as "supply points." The remainder 
of Goodyear dealers, like dealers handling 
smaller company lines, "are substantially 
foreclosed from access to Atlantic accounts." 
Multiply this effect on free competition by 
the number of TBA agreements in force be-
tween the major tire and oil firms and you 
get an indication of what is involved. 
Proposal for Peace 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. CLAUDE PEPPER 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 1965 
Mr. PEPPER. Mr. Speaker, under 
leave to extend my remarks in the 
RECORD, I include the following: 
A VIEW OF THE NEWS?GETTING INVOLVED 
IN VIETNAM 
(By Clarke Ash, associate editor of the 
Miami News) 
What can one Miamian do to end the mess 
in Vietnam? , John. R. Bethea doesn't know 
for sure but he aims to find out. 
Bethea is a young (33) social science in-
structor at the University of Miami who be-
lieves teachers should become involved in 
world events. 
Currently, he is looking for ways to spread 
the word about a promising plan to get the 
United States out of the Vietnam conflict 
without abandoning the country to the 
Communists. 
The plan is not Bethea's. It was advanced 
by a fellow educator at the University of Chi-
cago, Dr. Gilbert F. White, professor of geog-
raphy. After first appearing in the Bulletin 
of the Atomic Scientists, it is being distri-
buted by the American Friends Service 
Committee, whose pamphlet came into Be-
thea's hands. 
Essentially, White's plan would substitute 
a masSive, Multination economic assistance 
program for the- ione Military hand the 
United States is playing today. About 20 
nations would be involved in both an eco-
nomic and military venture which would 
help stabilize not only Vietnam but also Laos, 
Cambodia, and other troubled countries of 
southeast Asia. 
RED ATTITUDE 
_ 
?  
What makes anyone think the Commu-
nists would hold,, still. while, all this Is, going 
on? No one knows that they would, of 
course. But optimism springs from the fact 
that they are already cooperating to some 
degree in a little-known development pro-
.42Q5 
gram of vast potential on the southern Me-
kong River Delta. 
_Some 20 nations are working there with re-
Markable, unanimity of purpose on a pro-
gram begun in 1957 by the U.N. Economic 
Commission. The plan has such vast pop-
ular support that so far the Communists 
have kept hands off. 
Dr. White suggests that the present project, 
now in the planning and engineering phase, 
be greatly expanded by the participating na-
tions. The Mekong is to this region what the . 
Mississippi is to the United States, the Nile 
to northeast Africa, the Amazon to South 
America, with huge untapped potential for 
hydroelectric power and agriculture. The 
benefits of its development would extend all 
the way to Red China. It would be to the 
advantage of the nations supplying the eco-
nomic assistance to join in a multination 
police force to assure political stability while 
the project was underway. 
This is but a sketchy outline of a proposal 
which Bethea can propound in detail and at 
length. He believes that if enough people 
can be sold, their combined voices will be 
heard in Washington. 
RIGHT DIRECTION 
Maybe Washington is already tuned in. 
Last Thursday, President Johnson emerged 
from a Cabinet meeting with the announce-
Ment that the United States would consider a 
sort of "Marshall plan" of economic and so-
cial assistance for Southeast Asia if peace 
were restored in Vietnam. 
The President did not mention the Mekong 
River development specifically, but the idea 
would seem to mesh with his thinking. If he 
has any trouble selling the public on this 
new direction, Mr. Johnson should have an 
ardent supporter in Dr. White and his con-
vert in Miami, John Bethea. 
. . 
A PROPOSAL FOR PEACE IN VIETNAM 
A peaceful and honorable resolution of the 
conflict in South Vietnam and Laos may be 
found in a bold plan for land and water de-
velopment which already unites factions in 
four nations of southeast Asia. For 7 years, 
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and South Viet-
nam have been working with little publicity 
and without disagreement on a. huge de-
velopment program. These four countries, 
which do not cooperate in anything else, 
have reached accord on development of the 
Lower Mekong Basin. 
Work already is underway in drawing engi-
neering designs, moving earth for dams, 
building powerplants, cultivating pilot farms, 
and training village technicians. Even 
guerrilla troops have not halted field work. 
If the United Nations were to designate 
this area for international development ac-
cording to the plan already drawn by the 
four nations, there is a strong possibility 
that peace could be achieved in a common 
pursuit of agricultural and industrial growth. 
This is a solution to southeast Asian violence 
which would make sense to peasants in rice 
fields and to American taxpayers * * *. The 
United Nations might be expected to provide 
a blue-helmeted watch and wara service for 
those sectors of the project area where se-
curity is threatened. It could do this on the 
invitation of the country concerned. Cam-
bodia w.91,11c1 have, no immediate 
need beyond protection of their borders. 
Laos and South Vietnam would find it essen-
tial in the areas where civil unrest has been 
intense * * *. 
This type of agreement would be funda-
mentally different from the cease-fire that is 
1Es-runts from "Lower Mekong,' by Gil-
bert F. White, professor of geography at the 
University of Chicago. The article was pub-
lished by the "Bulletin of the Atomic Scien-
tists," December 1964, and reprinted by the 
American Friends Service Committee, 1185

envisioned under a neutralization treaty. 
The four countries, the United States, North 
Vietnam, and other interested nations. would 
commit themselves primarily to advance a 
great development program for the welfare 
of the people * * *. It would substitute a 
development goal for an indistinct battle 
line, and it would permit the United States 
to withdraw gracefully in favor of an inter-
national force committed to that goal. Fi-
nancial obligations of the United States 
would in the future be linked with con-
tributions of money and people from other 
nations. 
A PROPOSAL FOR SOLITTION OF THE VIETNAM 
CONFLICT 
In addition to the obliterating threat of a 
nuclear war, there are two other overriding 
issues which threaten the security of all so-
cieties. One problem is the unrest and in-
stability of two-thirds of the world's popula-
tion, which is suffering from malnutrition 
or worse. Much of this unrest is caused by 
the fact that these people are beginning to 
smell the "aroma" of what might be theirs 
if they could only develop economically. 
Second, it is common knowledge that there 
exists in the world an enormous variety of 
young, emotional national states. These na-
tions have learned well from the history of 
the older Western nation states. Under-
standably these young nations make on oc-
casion what might seem to be, from our 
viewpoint, inappropriate and unrealistic de-
mands. 
However, one consistent and valid demand 
made by these nations is that it be possible 
for them to achieve a reasonable degree of 
economic stability. Economic stability is for 
many of these countries the essential pre-
requisite to social and political stability. 
When feasible, the program of development 
should be an international cooperative 
venture. 
Thus, with the background given by Gil-
bert White's article, it seems reasonable that 
the United States might offer to allocate a 
significant portion of its yearly foreign aid 
appropriation to the existing international 
economic venture in the Mekong River Delta. 
This action would promote long range politi-
cal and social stability. This type of positive 
action would meet a common need of all 
emerging countries?economic development. 
The project by its very nature would promote 
regionalism and provide an example of co-
operation among small nation states. 
The obvious fact is that world peace is the 
responsibility, militarily and economically, of 
all nations. The United States should offer 
to redirect its energies from military to eco-
nomic development if a group of nations 
would agree, with the consent of the South 
Vietnam Government, to bring into South 
Vietnam a sufficiently large force to help 
that Government and people maintain their 
political and territorial integrity. 
This plan does not hope that South Viet-
nam will finally become either capitalistic 
or socialistic. The end result for all of the 
small countries in this area will probably be 
a mixture of both economic systems. This 
plan does involve the determination that no 
single country will dominate the peninsula 
known historically to the westerner as 
French Indochina. Most nations, including 
many of the emerging nations, should be 
willing collectively to resist aggression of this 
kind. 
This plan is an honorable alternative to 
the present U.S. course of action. In the 
positive sense of being creative, the Mekong 
River Delta project promises regionalism and 
long-range social and political growth. 
Thank you for your time and considera-
tion.

How the Handicapped Are Overcoming 
Barriers to Employment in My Community 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WALTER S. BARING 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 28, 1965 
Mr. BARING. Mr. Speaker, under 
leave to extend my remarks, I should like 
to have inserted in the Appendix of the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the prize-winning 
entry of Miss Melody Jean Smith of 
Reno, Nev., in the 1965 national "Ability 
Counts" contest sponsored by the Presi-
dents' Committee on Employment of the 
Handicapped. 
Miss Smith won fourth place and will 
be presented with her award at the open-
ing ceremonies of the committee's an-
nual meeting on April 29. 
The essay follows: 
How THE HANDICAPPED ARE OVERCOMING BAR-
RIER TO EMPLOYMENT IN MY COMMUNITY 
(By Melody Jean Smith, Reno High School, 
Reno, Nev.) 
Addressing the President's Committee on 
Employment of the Handicapped in April of 
1964, President Johnson said, "I am con-
vinced that it is morally right--socially just 
?economically sensible?and administra-
tively feasible to open the door of employ-
ment opportunity to handicapped but job-
qualified Americans." Many handicapped 
individuals in my community have opened 
that door?the door which leads to their em-
ployment and to their acceptance as produc-
tive members of sOciety. 
That a moral imperative endows every hu-
man being with dignity and worth is un-
questioned in our society, yet complete social 
justice has not been attained. There are still 
many prejudices against handicapped indi-
viduals. 
Achieving social justice for these handi-
capped is never the work of a single indi-
vidual or a single agency. Hundreds of peo-
ple and many facilities are involved in over-
coming barriers to the employment of the 
handicapped: rehabilitation counselors, phy-
sicians, psychologists, social workers, and 
prosthetic experts; plus rehabilitation cen-
ters, workshops, hospitals, and schools. The 
President's Committee on Employment of 
the Handicapped has a network of governors' 
committees and local committees carrying 
information and inspiration to every part of 
the country. The work of these groups has 
resulted in modification of the hiring prac-
tices of employers. 
One of the great steps made in the past 
few years has been the removal of architec-
tural barriers such as steep flights of steps 
and narrow doorways that cannot admit em-
ployees confined to wheelchairs. Last year 
when my community's new multimillion-
dollar bank building was completed, Mr. Al-
bert Alegre, the building manager, stated, 
"The handicapped were considered when this 
building was planned." A ramp leads to the 
building's automatic doors, and the eleva-
tors, drinking fountains, and restrooms of 
the interior are easily accessible to the han-
dicapped. A newly built Employment Se-
curity Office Building and an almost com-
pleted city hall also have street level en-
trances accessible to the handicapped. 
Federal-State agencies working as part-
ners in action have made rehabilitation and 
placement of the handicapped administra-
tively feasible. Disabled persons are re-
ferred to the Division of Vocational Rehabili-
tation from many sources: doctors, schools, 
welfare agencies, and employment services. 
Medical data, case study, and an appraisal 
of the client's ability enable the counselor 
to work out an individual rehabilitation 
plan. The services may include medical 
care, the supplying of artificial limbs, train-
ing, transportation, and maintenance dur-
ing rehabilitation, the supplying of occu-
pational tools and equipment, and job place-
ment. 
In my community by means of a grant 
from the Max C. Fleishmann Foundation, 
funds from the Vocational Rehabilitation 
Administration, and contributions from in
and organizations in Nevada, a 
much-needed occupational training center is 
being initiated. This center will provide 
necessary training for disabled people in or-
der that they may become self-supporting. 
The money spent for the construction 
and operation of this training center is well 
spent, for rehabilitation of the handicapped 
is economically sensible. In Nevada, 113 
persons were rehabilitated during the fiscal 
year 1963-64. These individuals had earned 
$62,088 annually before rehabilitation; after 
rehabiLitation they were earning $491,296 
annually, an increase of over 600 percent. 
It is estimated that during the rest of their 
lives they will pay back about $10 in income 
tax for every dollar invested in their re-
habilitation. 
Hiring the handicapped is also economi-
cally sensible for the employer. Publicized 
studies show that properly placed handi-
capped persons are equally or more pro-
ductive than their fellow workers and that 
they have better attendance and safety rec-
ords. 
Many handicapped persons in my commun-
ity have overcome the characteristic barriers, 
to employment?social, architectural, preju-
dicial--and are now proving that "ability 
counts." Although Mr. Howard McKissick 
is a disabled veteran, his consistent reelec-
tion to the post of county commissioner at-
tests to his efficiency and the voters grati-
tude. Mrs. Lillian Barnum, who lost her legs 
when she was eight, is a dedicated worker for 
the Governor's Committee on Employment of 
the Handicapped. In spite of the loss of his 
right arm, Mr. Howard Farrell is an excellent 
accountant for the Internal Revenue Service. 
Mr. Maynard Yasmer, severely crippled by 
polio, necessitating his being confined to a 
wheelchair, has achieved distinction as a re-
hibilitation counselor. 
These people are among those who have 
overcome barriers to employment in my com-
munity. Many more need help. This help is 
being provided by the many agencies and in-
dividuals that concern themselves with this 
problem. Through diligent work, my com-
munity is learning that it is "morally right?
socially just?economically sensible?and ad-
ministratively feasible" to rehabilitate and 
hire the handicapped.
