 IRAN: Oi,]. Situation Report
 25X1
 Despite exiled religious Leader Khomeini's recent
 call to produce enough oil for Iran's domestic needs  oil
 workers are remaining away from their jobs.
 25X1
 Oil production has been below 300,000 barrels per
 day for the past five days and cannot be increased sub-
 stantially for domestic use until workers return to the
 refineries now shut down by strikes. Normal production     25X1
 levels at these refineries could reportedly be reached
 within two weeks after workers return.
 A pipeline to Tehran from Abadan--site of Iran's
 only currently operating refinery--was damaged, presumably
 by sabotage, on Tuesday. The flow of refined products may
 be interrupted only tem oraril ; repairs reportedly are
 under way.
 //There have been only a few minor incidents of sabo-
 tage at oil facilities to date, and the Shah's opponents
 have not given any indication that they intend to inflict
 serious damage to the nation's most im ortant industry.//

 CHINA: Leadership Shakeup
 Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-ping) ap-
 parently has engineered a major shakeup of the Chinese
 Communist Party apparatus that makes his closest asso-
 ciate and protege Hu Yaobang  (Hu Yao-pang)  the most
 powerful official of the younger generation.  Hu,  63,  has
 inherited Deng's former job as secretary general of the
 party,  the key official in the party who supervises all
 of its activities and has displaced an associate of
 Chairman Hua Guofeng (Hua KuO-feng) as head of the party
 propaganda department.  The move in effect informally
 designates Hu as Deng's successor.
 The post of party secretary general has been vacant
 since Deng lost the job when he was purged in the mid-
 1960s. The party leadership apparently had been unable
 to agree for more than a decade on a candidate to fill
 the powerful post. It probably selected Hu as secretary
 general of the central committee plenum last month; at
 that time the Chinese announced only that Hu was a new
 member of the ruling Politburo. Deng undoubtedly regards
 Hu's selection as secretary general as the best way to
 insure the continuation of his pragmatic policies.
 Hu's appointment as propaganda chief reflects Deng's
 evident dissatisfaction with some of China's main media,
 which have failed to endorse his campaign to move China
 away from rigid adherence to Maoist ideology. The former
 propaganda chief, who has longstanding ties to Chairman
 Hua, was recently attacked in posters for urging others
 not to go along with the desanctification of Mao. Hu,
 by contrast, has apparently written articles arguing
 Hu's career has paralleled Deng's since the two
 served together in the army in the 1930s. Both were
 transferred to Beijing (Peking) in the 1950s, when Deng
 became party secretary general and Hu became the head
 of the party's youth apparatus. Both were purged during
 the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s. Hu prospered again
 (luring Deng's first return to power in the mid-1970s but
 fell with Deng in 1976. He returned shortly before Deng
 in 1977 and was Deng's main lieutenant in the purge of
 followers of the fallen Gang of Four.

 Deng apparently was willing to make some compromises
 for Hu's elevation. For example, two former province 25X1
 chiefs who were harshly criticized and stripped of their
 posts recently at Deng's apparent instigation have since
 appeared in the capital in evident good standing.
 An editorial in People's Daily published three days
 after the party plenum last month departed significantly
 from the communique issued by the plenum and seemed to
 represent Deng's "dissenting" views. The editorial, un-
 like the communique, explicitly endorsed the use of wall
 posters as a way for the people to express their opinions.
 In fact, the failure of China's three leading media or-
 gans to greet the conclusion of the plenum with a joint
 editorial suggests continuing disagreement within the
 leadership.

 CUBA-US: Anniversary Speech
 25X1
 Cuban President Fidel Castro used his speech on
 1 January commemorating the 20th anniversary of the tri-
 umph of the Cuban revolution to deliver his strongest
 condemnation of the US since the Carter administration
 took office. The harshness of Castro's Language reflects
 his frustration over what he sees as Washington's failure
 to respond to his friendly gestures during the past sev-
 eral months and indicates that Castro has all but written
 off the possibility of improved relations in the near      25X1
 term. The Cuban President refrained from criticizing
 President Carter personally and was careful to Leave the
 door open for an eventual normalization of relations.
 Castro has been aware for some time that Cuba faces
 a period of prolonged austerity unless it can sell its
 major export products--sugar and nickel--to the US.
 Cuba's hope that the economic embargo would be lifted to
 allow access to the US market has been the chief motive
 behind its recent gestures concerning human rights, and
 Castro was particularly bitter about the Carter adminis-
 tration's failure to respond positively.
 Castro's biting remarks about the decision to nor-
 malize US-Chinese relations arise from his awareness
 that China--toward which Cuba has long felt antipathy--
 now stands to take advantage of an economic relationship
 with the US that is denied to Cuba. Castro emphasized,
 however, that Cuba--unlike China--will not abandon its
 revolutionary principles to obtain the benefits of com-
 mercial relations with the US.
 The Cuban President apparently sees no possibility
 that local conditions will allow any lessening of Cuba's
 military presence in Africa in the near future. In fact,
 his remark that Cuba will be "unflinchingly loyal" to
 its "revolutionary obligations" implies that Havana will
 continue to stand ready to hel  its friends in Africa
 and elsewhere.
 Castro used highly pejorative language in contrast-
 ing his government's domestic accomplishments with what
 he asserted was the failure of US-supported regimes in
 Latin America to overcome their social problems.

 The Cuban armed forces parade Tuesday emphasized
 weapons that contribute both to Cuba's defense and to
 its military commitments abroad and the increasing mo-
 bility of the armed forces. The Cubans showed amphibious
 weapons, engineering equipment, personnel transports,
 and--in their first public display--armed MI-8 helico -
 ters and a unit of naval infantry.
 A television documentary shown Tuesday pointed out
 that the USSR has provided Cuba all its military equip-
 ment free of charge; the commentator put the value of
 this equipment since 1959 at several billion dollars.

 Spain
 25X1
 The assassination yesterday of the military governor
 of Madrid and the killings on Tuesday of an Army and a
 police officer in the Basque country were probably part
 of the campaign by the Basque terrorist group ETA to
 provoke the Spanish Government to impose martial law.
 Major General Constantino Ortin Gil was the sixth and
 highest ranking military officer to be killed since
 November 1977 by the terrorists. F7          1    25X1
 ETA apparently hopes that the killings will provoke
 the military to press the government to impose martial
 law. Such a move would draw the military into violent
 clashes between security forces and civilians and provoke
 further resentment in the Basque area. ETA hopes that
 such resentment will make it impossible for the moderate
 Basque Nationalist Party to reach an agreement with the
 central government on the final form of the autonomy
 statute for the Basque area. ETA may also be reacting to
 the government's recent step up in arrests of suspected
 ETA terrorists.
 The government is unlikely to resort to martial law
 except in an extreme emergency. Although military leaders
 may advise the government to crack down harder on Basque
 terrorists, most generals reportedly do not favor im-
 posing martial law.                                                25X1
 China
 China's massive modernization efforts have already
 created construction material shortages and bottlenecks.
 In anticipation of even larger shortages, the Chinese
 have contracted with Japan to deliver 1.5 million to 2
 million tons of cement this year. This contract is the
 largest cement contract the Ch'n se ever signed with the
 West.
 China has traditionally been a cement exporter but
 bought nearly 200,000 tons of cement from Japan last year.

 The Chinese are importing cement despite their claims
 that they produced 67 million tons in 1978--nearl   21
 25X1    percent over 1977 production.
 Imp

 TURKEY: Prospects for Ecevit
 25X1
 The coming months will test the cohesiveness of the
 left-of-center government of Turkish Prime Minister
 Ecevit and the resilience of Turkey's democratic insti-
 tutions. The declaration of martial Law in 13 provinces
 Late Last month has cost Ecevit much of his remaining
 political capital in his party, given new opportunities
 to the opposition, and Limited further Ecevit's ability
 to risk the hard decisions needed to rescue the economy.
 It has also reopened the possibility of a political role
 for the military.  Should Ecevit's precariously poised      25X1
 government fall, it is unlikely that a government would
 emerge that would be more able and willing to confront
 Turkey's domestic and foreign policy problems.
 The majority in Ecevit's Republican People's Party
 who supported martial law hope it will suppress political
 violence, free the government to deal with the economy,
 and permit Ecevit and the party to emerge with a healthier
 image. The 63 members of the party's increasingly trucu-
 lent left wing who opposed martial law remain concerned
 that it will fall heaviest against the left and will ul-
 timately fortify the right. Ecevit will find it difficult
 to cope with the conflicting pressures from within his
 party, which have already compelled him to sack his in-
 terior minister.
 The opposition parties, despite having unanimously
 approved martial law in parliament, have portrayed Ecevit
 as a weak and vacillating leader who allowed events to
 get out of hand. Recognizing that the issue of civilian-
 military relations is a sensitive one within Ecevit's
 party, the opposition parties have taunted the Prime Min-
 ister for not increasing the prerogatives of martial law
 authorities. Suleyman Demirel, a former Prime Minister
 and leader of the principal opposition party, the Justice
 Party, has introduced a motion of censure in parliament
 and announced that he is placing his trust in the armed
 forces. F7             I

 The neofascist National Action Party, which is be-
 hind most of the rightist-inspired violence, has pointed
 out that the government has not imposed martial law in
 leftist-dominated provinces. The party has called for
 martial law in seven more provinces. Alpaslan Turkes,
 leader of the party and a major participant in the 1960
 military intervention, has made no secret of his desire
 for another military takeover to stop the alleged drift
 of the government and Turkish society toward Communism.
 25X1

 25X1
 Only Necmettin Erbakan's Islamic-oriented National
 Salvation Party, which is leaving open the possibility
 of again joining in a governing coalition, has hedged
 its criticism of the Prime Minister. Although the opposi-
 tion parties may not be ready to return to power during
 this troubled period, their effort to bring Ecevit down
 is unlikely to abate.
 Ecevit's continuation in office depends on the evo-
 lution of civilian-military relations and the military's
 effectiveness in reducing violence. Recognizing this,
 Ecevit has sought to assure civilian supremacy by utiliz-
 ing such devices as daily meetings with General Staff
 Chief Evren, formation of a cabinet-level martial law co-
 ordination board, and weekly meetings with provincial
 martial law commanders. Ecevit hopes to prevent military
 excesses and mollify those in his party who distrust the
 military as well as to discredit o  osition charges that
 he is weak. F77
 The prospects that martial law will quell political
 violence in Turkey are considerably more favorable than
 they are in neighboring Iran. Having intervened twice be-
 fore in the political process--in 1960 and in 1971--the
 Turkish military has had substantial experience in crowd
 control methods and law enforcement.
 Turkish extremists of the left and right are feuding
 and their activities are chiefly aimed against each other
 rather than at the government. The extreme left is di-
 vided, and Islam is not as strong a political force in
 Turkey as in Iran despite the resurgence of the antisec-
 ular sentiment in Turkey. Turkish extremist leaders have
 so far been unwilling openly to incite their followers

 to commit acts of violence. Perhaps the most important 25X1
 difference between Turkey and Iran is that Turkey's demo-
 cratic institutions are better able to channel most dis-
 content into constructive give-and-take.
 The causes of political violence in Turkey will re-
 main, however, even if the military is able to limit the
 number of killings and demonstrations. Ecevit-will also
 find it difficult to end martial law and thus will have
 another problem to face. Others include the worsening
 economy, the budget debate in late February, his party's
 convention in April, and the senatorial election in
 June.
 Although martial law will sharply reduce the level   25X1
 of violence where it is in force, there is always a
 danger that an incident could trigger mass rioting. Vio-
 lence might also increase in areas not covered by martial
 law. Pressure for an expansion of the area covered by
 martial law combined with the continuing downslide in the
 economy could well cause Ecevit's government to fall.
 The combination of the Ataturk tradition and its
 earlier unhappy attempts to govern the country thus far
 has inclined the military to stay out of politics. Mili-
 tary leaders, however, have been deeply concerned over
 the growing economic and internal security crisis, which
 threaten both military values and its corporate and in-
 dividual economic interests. Even before the martial law
 decision, however, the military declared its intention
 to "go public" with its many economic and morale prob-
 lems, in part because of concern that Ecevit's "New De-
 fense Concept" will entail a sharp reduction in next
 year's defense budget.
 In a manner reminiscent of the period before the
 25X1
 1960 intervention, General Staff Chief Evren criticized
 the parliament for hastily enacting legislation adversely
 affecting the morale and economic well-being of his offi-
 cers.
 Such sentiment and the expected civilian-military
 strains if political violence is not quelled could impel
 the military to be more assertive. Should the Ecevit gov-
 ernment fall, the military might decide to play at least
 a behind-the-scenes role in putting together a successor
 government. Should that Trove impossible  the military
 could again seize power.                                          25X1

 The outlook for the Ecevit government is not prom-
 ising, and prospects that Turkey will be able to solve
 its mounting problems without at least some indirect in-
 volvement by the military are only slightly better.
 Forced by events to spend a good deal of his remaining
 political capital to curb political violence, Ecevit will
 be less willing and able to take the measures necessary
 to stop the related problems of stopping the economy's
 downward slide and ensuring needed international assis-
 tance. The same holds true for confronting the quarrels
 with the Greeks over Cyprus, the Aegean, and NATO. Such
 immobilism will further aggravate the economic situation
 and ma  also deter an ade uate international rescue ef-
 25X1         fort.
