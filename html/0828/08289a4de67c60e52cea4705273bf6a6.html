 Afghanistan:
 The Politics of
 the Resistance Movement
 Key Judgments        The Afghan resistance movement consists of hundreds of independent
 groups, many of which have no goal beyond that of driving out the Soviet
 occupation force and ending Communist rule in Afghanistan. Those with
 longer term political goals range from Maoists to Islamic fundamentalists,
 and the number of organizations espousing regional and ethnic interests is
 growing.
 At present there appears to be little chance that the insurgent groups will
 unite into a single organization. Former King Zahir might have the best
 chance of unifying the resistance, but it is questionable that even half of
 the insurgents would accept his leadership.
 Substantial external support might provide one insurgent leader with the
 prestige and influence necessary to combine several groups into a National
 Liberation Movement, but such a group would still be plagued with
 divisions and jealousies.
 Any government formed by the resistance would be weak. If broadly based,
 it would face serious internal tensions. If dominated by a single group, it
 would face intense competition from other insurgent organizations. In
 either case it would have little influence in large parts of Afghanistan.
 The absence of central authority, however, has not prevented the develop-
 ment of cooperation among insurgent bands in the field.

 Secret
 Afghanistan:
 The Politics of
 the Resistance Movement
 Introduction
 The Afghans are engaged in a spontaneous and
 essentially nonideological resistance against the Com-
 munist regime of Babrak Karmal and his Soviet
 masters. There is no central organization. There are
 hundreds of independent resistance organizations,
 some with long-range plans for Afghanistan, many
 more with no goal beyond keeping Soviet and govern-
 ment forces out of a single valley or village. Many of
 the bands fighting in Afghanistan recognize no higher
 authority. Others are associated to some degree with
 larger organizations-either exiles or groups based
 within Afghanistan.
 The Insurgents in the Field
 Many insurgents-probably the majority-belong to
 independent bands representing a village, valley,
 tribe, clan, or family and feel little identity with a
 national movement. These bands are fighting to pre-
 serve Islam and tradition from outside interference,
 just as Afghan rebels have done for centuries. Com-
 manders of these bands often cooperate with other
 leaders against a common enemy; joint operations are
 becoming more common, intelligence is being ex-
 changed more regularly, and assistance is extended
 more frequently in moving supplies. The cooperation
 is between equals, however, with neither commander
 willing to surrender his independence in a common
 cause.
 example, some raids by bands based in Pakistan are
 organized and directed by exile leaders in Peshawar.
 Other bands are under the direct control of political
 organizations based inside Afghanistan. More com-
 mon, however, is a situation in which an insurgent
 commander acknowledges his allegiance to a political
 leader but is largely left on his own in conducting
 military operations. Some commanders receive
 neither guidance nor assistance from the political
 leaders.
 The Exiles
 Most of the resistance leaders with a national outlook
 are in exile. Among the dozens of exile groups, the
 most prominent and the only ones recognized by the
 Pakistani Government are six based in Peshawar,
 Pakistan. Since late 1978 much time and effort has
 been devoted to forming alliances among various
 combinations of these Peshawar parties. The latest
 alliance, announced in August 1981, will probably not
 be any more durable or genuine than the preceding
 three (see table 1). This particular effort is notewor-
 thy, however, because for the first time it includes
 Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's fundamentalist Islamic
 Party and excludes Ahmad Gailani's moderate Na-
 tional Islamic Front (see appendix). Gulbuddin, who
 has previously shunned attempts at unity, has come
 under increasing pressure from religious leaders and
 insurgent field commanders to curb his intransigence.
 Gulbuddin's precondition for joining this time was the
 These bands are often critical of the larger political
 organizations, which they see as corrupt, inefficient,
 prone to intrigue and petty squabbling, and useful
 only as potential sources of externally supplied arms.
 To obtain arms they may give nominal allegiance to a
 political organization without actually allowing it any
 control over their actions. A political organization
 may also count among its f''lowers any who receive
 its help
 Other bands have more genuine relationships with the
 political organizations. In some cases an organization
 has direct control over a band's operations. For
 exclusion of Gailani's moderate party.
 Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's disunifying influence has
 been felt in Afghanistan as well as in Peshawar.
 Increasingly, Gulbuddin's men, long resented for their
 gangster-like tactics, have been involved in attacks on
 other insurgents and have intimidated villagers while
 in search of supplies and "donations" for their party
 treasury. On occasion the situation has gotten so bad
 that village elders have been forced to call on the
 hated government forces to help

 In the early days of the insurgency the Peshawar
 parties minimized their ideological differences to con-
 centrate their efforts against the common enemy.
 During the past year, however, polarization between
 fundamentalists and moderates has increased.
 Fundamentalists advocate a revolutionary Islamic
 state and the elimination of modern social trends-
 such as equality for women-for post-Soviet Afghani-
 stan. Although opposed to the radical Iranian brand
 of Islamic revolution, the fundamentalists are
 adamant in their opposition to the return of the
 monarchy.
 The moderates, representing for the most part the
 urban, educated elite of the pre-Communist era,
 envisage a secular state under democratic institutions
 with a member of the exiled royal family as a
 figurehead king or president. The moderates are also
 amenable to friendly relations with the West.
 The Regional Organizations
 The growing belief among insurgents in the field that
 the Peshawar parties are self-seeking and hopelessly
 divided has led to the formation in various areas of
 insurgent organizations based on tribal or ethnic
 rather than political ties. These groups, some very
 effective militarily on their own home ground, hope to
 bypass the Peshawar parties in securing external aid
 and have begun to send representatives to Iran and
 Europe, as well as Peshawar and Islamabad, in search
 of assistance. Many insurgent commanders hope that
 eventually these organizations can coalesce into an
 organized national consensus.

 The Outlook for Insurgent Unity
 In the near term the prospects for unity among the
 disparate elements of the insurgency are not good.
 Among the Peshawar exile groups-despite their peri-
 odic alliances-the trend seems to be toward more
 factionalism both between parties and among the
 leaders of individual groups. In the various party
 headquarters in Peshawar there is increasing strife as
 the party leaders fend off the power moves of their
 subordinates. Without the occasional intervention of
 the Pakistani Government, the situation would be
 considerably worse.
 Some tribal groups in the field have been able to pool
 their military efforts under the auspices of regional
 organizations, but such cooperation rarely extends
 across ethnic lines. Non-Pushtun tribes still harbor a
 deep-seated enmity against their- Pushtun neighbors-
 historically the dominant ethnic group in Afghani-
 stan-and are unwilling to return to the pre-Commu-
 nist status quo. Additionally, these regional groups
 might succeed in organizing the insurgency in a given
 area, but in so doing they would solidify ethnic and
 regional differences and in some areas become de
 facto governments unlikely to surrender their author-
 ity to a broad national resistance movement or to any
 non-Communist government in Kabul.
 Former King Zahir Shah, who may have the best
 chance of uniting the various tribal and political
 elements of the resistance, has so far shown little
 inclination to attempt this. Furthermore, such an
 action would draw extreme opposition not only from
 fundamentalists but from many others in the resist-
 ance unwilling to lessen their own authority.
 The situation would change if one insurgent leader or
 group were to secure a disproportionate share of
 foreign assistance in obtaining weapons. In Afghan
 tribal society the power and prestige of a leader is still
 a matter of patronage and of the exercise of reciprocal
 rights and obligations between "feudal lord" and
 "vassal." The leader of a Peshawar political party
 who could demonstrate a consistent ability to supply
 his men in the field with enough weapons and ammu-
 nition to continue the fight against the Communists
 would assume greater stature in the eyes of insur-
 gents. Other groups would lose support if they too
 were not able to obtain such aid.

 The Pakistani Government provided a practical dem-
 onstration of this principle when it decided to recog-
 nize only six major insurgent groups in Peshawar.
 Literally dozens of other would-be insurgent groups,
 lacking the official blessing and materiel support of
 Islamabad, disappeared overnight.
 In the Afghan countryside, tribal groups and insur-
 gent commanders would quickly acquire renewed
 respect for and confidence in a party leader who could
 provide significant military support for their efforts in
 the field. Afghan tribesmen who know and care little
 about abstract political or ideological concepts would
 respect and follow a strong leader with powerful
 backing. Such a leader may be able to draw together
 enough support to form a national liberation move-
 ment.
 Post-Soviet Government?
 Should the resistance somehow come to power in
 Kabul, the resulting government would be weak.
 Afghan governments historically have had full control
 only in the major cities and nearby rural areas. In
 most of the country, government authority has been
 tolerated only so long as there was no serious interfer-
 ence with local affairs. In the past few years, central
 authority has been virtually nonexistent in much of
 the country, leaving local leaders in complete control.
 It seems unlikely that these leaders will give up their
 new power easily, and any future government may
 have even less authority outside Kabul than its pre-
 Communist predecessors
 The government also would probably be divided.
 Infighting in any coalition government would make
 the formulation of coherent policy difficult and would
 probably lead to attempts by the various groups to
 eliminate their rivals. Frequent coups, purges, and
 assassinations would be likely, a situation Afghani-
 stan's neighbors-including the USSR-would be
 greatly tempted to exploit, whatever agreement they
 had reached about noninterference
 A government representing only one faction of the
 insurgency might be no better. If it made a serious
 effort to implement its policies, it would meet resist-
 ance from both its ideological rivals and regional
 groups opposed to any extension of central authority.
 Perhaps the best the Afghans could hope for would be
 a government headed by a member of the royal family
 and administered by experienced and well-known
 politicians from the monarchy and Daoud's republic.
 The leaders of such a government might have enough
 tribal and political status to survive, but only if they
 succeeded in avoiding serious offense to any of the
 contending groups in Afghanistan.

 Appendix: Afghan Dissident Groups
 Peshawar-Based Political Parties
 Fundamentalists
 Hizbi Islami (Islamic Party). The oldest, best orga-
 nized, most dedicated and efficient of the Peshawar-
 based political parties, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's
 Hizbi Islami is the only group that resembles the
 ruthlessly dedicated cadre usually associated with
 guerrilla movements. The organization began in 1969
 as a student group at Kabul University, founded by
 Gulbuddin to oppose King Zahir Shah, and after his
 fall, President Mohammad Daoud.
 At 36, younger than most other exile leaders, Gulbud-
 din is ambitious and opportunistic. An impressive
 orator who fits the conventional image of a stern
 Islamic traditionalist, he has in the past refused to
 deal with other groups because his own preeminence
 within the insurgent movement might be diminished.
 Under pressure from religious leaders and perhaps
 seeing personal advantages in unity, he joined an
 alliance with four of the other main exile groups in
 August 1981. He remains convinced that the others
 will eventually acknowledge his leadership.
 Gulbuddin is uncompromising in his opposition to the
 pro-Soviet regime of Babrak Karmal, and if he came
 to power in Afghanistan, he would almost certainly
 remain staunchly anti-Soviet.
 He has, however, also been critical of the United
 States and other Western countries, probably to avoid
 strings he believes would accompany any help, to
 emphasize his independence to the Afghan people,
 and because he doubts Washington's willingness to
 continue support for an extended period. Recently his
 representatives have been more friendly to US offi-
 cials and have indicated a desire for "friendly ties"
 with the United States.
 He strongly opposes any role for the royal family in
 either the insurgency or any future Afghan Govern-
 ment. His plans for a post-Soviet Afghanistan include
 the establishment of an Islamic theocracy and the
 Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader
 of the Islamic Party
 outlawing of education for women. His supporters
 insist, at least in dealing with Westerners, that a
 Khomeini-like "dictatorship of mullahs" is neither
 possible nor contemplated by Gulbuddin, and they
 profess horror at the excesses of Islamic fundamental-
 ism in Iran.
 Hizbi Islami claims to have 27 autonomous provincial
 organizations in Afghanistan and support from an
 equal number of offices in Pakistan-24 in Peshawar
 and three in Quetta. The central organization is
 divided into functional committees dealing with sub-
 jects such as politics, military operations, culture,
 education, and refugees. These committees meet regu-
 larly, work hard, and appear to be productive.
 Gulbuddin's propaganda apparatus is undoubtedly the
 most professional that the exiles have. Its press re-
 leases are published in the Pakistani press more
 frequently than those of other groups, and it has had

 considerable success convincing Western newsmen
 that Gulbuddin is the most important of the insurgent
 leaders. The cultural committee puts out a wide range
 of relatively slick publications aimed at a number of
 different audiences, including Pakistanis, Arabs, Ira-
 nians, and Russians.
 Other indications of the organization's effectiveness
 are a pool of articulate and well-prepared spokesmen,
 an effective medical program, a zealous recruiting
 program in the refugee camps, and-in contrast to
 most exile groups-tight security and a smoothly
 functioning central headquarters.
 It is difficult to gauge Hizbi Islami strength and
 military accomplishments, but the organization ap-
 pears to have its greatest strength in Paktia and
 Nangarhar Provinces, where it maintains arms caches
 and field headquarters. Some of the best trained and
 equipped insurgent bands in this area are under its
 control. In other parts of the country, Hizbi Islami's
 activities appear to be limited to collecting donations
 and spreading Gulbuddin's party line. Gulbuddin's
 image throughout Afghanistan has been enhanced by
 Afghan Government propaganda, which tends to por-
 tray him as the most dangerous of the "rebel bandit"
 leaders.
 Hizbi Islami's relations with other insurgent groups in
 both Peshawar and Afghanistan have been poor.
 Gulbuddin's self-serving public relations efforts, his
 favored position with the Pakistani Government,
 strong-arm recruiting in refugee camps, and his re-
 fusal to cooperate with other organizations have cre-
 ated extreme resentment among Afghans in Pakistan.
 Within Afghanistan his men have earned a reputation
 for intimidation and taking supplies without payment.
 Reports of armed clashes resulting from Hizbi Islami
 efforts to eliminate rival insurgent leaders and to
 claim exclusive "turf" are growing. In addition Gul-
 buddin's rivals in the resistance are trying to convince
 the people that he is actually a leftist-a claim that
 has some basis in the beliefs he professed when he was
 a student.
 In August 1981 rumors circulated about personality
 and policy differences within the party's leadership.
 Tension between the hot-tempered Gulbuddin and his
 deputy Qazi Mohammad Amin appears to be simmer-
 ing. Qualified observers describe the smoothly run-
 ning party offices as disrupted by the maneuvering for
 power of the two men.
 Hizbi Islami (Islamic Party-Khalis Faction).
 Mohammad Younus Khalis' Hizbi Islami broke away
 from Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's group in the spring of
 1979 in protest over Gulbuddin's temporary merger
 with Burhanuddin Rabanni's Islamic League. Khalis
 probably believed that the moderately fundamentalist
 Rabanni would compromise the Islamic Party's reli-
 gious purity. Khalis's small but effective fighting
 force of about 800 men concentrates more on waging
 holy war in the hills of Afghanistan than on political
 maneuvering in Peshawar.
 committee.
 Younus Khalis, 60 years old, is admired by men of
 almost all political parties and is the closest thing in
 the Afghan insurgency to being the traditional tribal
 role model-the warrior-poet. A fiercely traditional
 leader who believes that the Koran is the only consti-
 tution Afghanistan needs, Khalis in his early days was
 an editor of religious magazines and later a teacher of
 Islamic thought in Kabul. He was eventually forced to
 flee to Pakistan in 1974 after the publication of a
 book that was critical of former President Moham-
 mad Daoud. He subsequently joined the original
 Hizbi Islami and became a member of its advisory

 Khalis's influence is strongest in his home province of
 Nangarhar and to a certain extent in the adjoining
 province of Paktia, where his forces are commanded
 by the renowned fighter, Jalaluddin Hakani, who
 serves as Khalis's second-in-command at Peshawar.
 Khalis's headquarters in Peshawar has long suffered
 from disorganization, lack of professionalism, and an
 inability to master the political aspects of the insur-
 gency. Recently, however, Khalis reportedly tightened
 up his organization considerably and extended the
 geographical scope of his operations. His group has

 Jamiat-i-Islami-Afghanistan (Islamic League of Af-
 ghanistan). Professor Burhanuddin Rabanni's Jamiat-
 i-Islami is second only to Gulbuddin's Hizbi Islami in
 its adherence to fundamentalist rhetoric and political
 philosophy. The two groups share a desire to establish
 rule based on the Koran and the traditional precepts
 of Islamic law, although Rabanni would not oppose
 the return to power of the monarchy.
 Burhanuddin Rabanni, leader
 of the Islamic League of
 Afghanistan
 Rabanni, a former professor of Islamic law and
 theology at Kabul University, began his political
 activism while working on his doctorate in Islamic
 philosophy at Al-Azhar University in Cairo. While in
 Cairo in 1968, he helped establish a clandestine
 organization to oppose the rule of King Zahir Shah.
 After returning to Kabul, he worked to expand the
 new organization through active recruitment and was
 finally elected secretary general of the group in 1972.
 Rabanni fled to Pakistan in 1974, when President
 Mohammad Daoud ordered his arrest for antigovern-
 ment activity. There Rabbani founded the Jamiat in
 July 1978.
 Rabanni's group, mainly non-Pushtun in composition,
 is probably strongest in his native province of Badakh-
 shan. It has limited contacts in Tajik and Uzbek areas
 and some support among the Shia tribesmen of the
 Hazarajat region in central Afghanistan. The organi-
 zation's military strength is thin even in these areas,
 and many insurgent bands who acknowledge
 Rabanni's leadership rarely receive either guidance or
 support from him

 Rabanni's group, like Gulbuddin's, is organized into
 committees. But the Jamiat's committees are much
 less effective. Jamiat's "public relations" committee,
 recognizing the need for media exposure, regularly
 releases articles and photographs to the local and
 international press.
 Rabanni receives substantial outside backing from the
 Jamiat-i-Islami-Pakistan as well as from Arab Gulf
 states and Iranian sources. Rabanni has recently
 spent considerable time improving his strained rela-
 tions with the Khomeini regime and soliciting aid
 from sympathetic Arab sources.
 In July 1981 the Jamiat suffered significant internal
 upheaval when the number-two man, Ahmad Shah
 Ahmadzai, withdrew from the party along with a
 number of others. The move seems to have been
 motivated by personality conflicts, not ideological
 differences. The Jamiat does not seem to have been
 seriously hurt organizationally and reportedly has
 even benefited from defections from Gulbuddin's
 Islamic Party.
 Harakat-i-Ingilab-i-Islami (Revolutionary Islamic
 Movement). Maulvi Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi's
 party, basically fundamentalist in ideology, began as
 an attempt to bring Gulbuddin's Hizbi Islami and
 Rabanni's Jamiat together in one organization and
 under one neutral leader. The coalition fell apart
 within a month. Nabi subsequently formed his own
 political party, the Harakat.
 The Harakat has been less specific about its ideology
 than other groups, and it appears to have only a
 rudimentary political structure. In the past, however,
 Nabi has been more willing to cooperate with secular
 groups than with other fundamentalist leaders. The
 support of large numbers of fighters throughout
 Afghanistan which Nabi claims seems to be based on
 the rural population's perception of him as a staunch
 protector of Afghan tradition and religious belief,
 rather than actual control of military operations
 Nabi, from the Khowst area in Paktia Province, was a
 member of the Afghan parliament and later went into
 voluntary exile during the regime of President Daoud.
 Maulvi Mohammad Nabi
 Mohammadi, leader of the
 Revolutionary Islamic
 Movement
 Nabi is thought by many to carry the extremely
 prestigious blessings of the mullah of the Shor Bazaar
 as the chosen standard bearer for the holy war against
 the infidel.
 In early 1981 Nabi dealt his party a severe blow by
 briefly aligning himself with two moderate party
 leaders, Ahmad Gailani and Sibghatullah Mojadedi,
 precipitating a showdown with the extreme funda-
 mentalist wing of his party led by Mansoor Nasrullah.
 Nasrullah and his followers were ejected from the
 Harakat after they attempted to remove Nabi from
 his party leadership
 The Pakistani Government was finally forced to inter-
 vene and bring back a semblance of unity to the
 Harakat, with Nabi remaining as titular head of the
 party and Nasrullah brought back into the fold. The
 administrative efficacy of the Peshawar headquarters
 has been shattered, however, by the party's internal
 squabbling. Within Afghanistan the quarrel is re-
 flected in partisan divisions between Harakat's fight-
 ers and a slow melting away of support to other

 leaders maneuver to undercut Nabi's position.

 Mahaz-i-Milli-Islami (National Islamic Front). If
 impeccable Islamic credentials were the true mark of
 a powerful and effective insurgent leader, then Pir
 Syed Ahmad Gailani and his party would be a
 credible force in the insurgency. Gailani, 48 years old,
 is a descendant of Afghanistan's principal "saintly"
 family and traces his ancestry back to the Prophet
 Mohammad. He thus commands a considerable reli-
 gious following from Sufi Muslims throughout
 Afghanistan.
 Gailani, a well-educated, well-dressed, well-traveled,
 extremely Westernized gentleman, is considered too
 ineffectual and too tainted by Western liberal ideas to
 count for much with the only constituency that mat-
 ters in the insurgency-the fighting tribesmen. Fur-
 thermore, Mahaz officials are widely regarded in
 fundamentalist circles as effete intellectuals who har-

 other exile leaders.
 Gailani's scheme for a post-Communist Afghanistan
 includes the separation of church and state and a
 parliamentary form of government with the possible
 participation of the king as a figurehead. He also sees
 an Afghanistan led by intellectuals instead of reli-
 gious figures and a constitution guaranteeing a multi-
 party system and a mixed economy with opportunity
 for eventual industrialization. Gailani's foreign policy
 would consist of nonalignment-friendly relations
 with the USSR, but a decided "tilt" toward the
 United States
 The Mahaz maintains no permanent guerrilla forces
 in Afghanistan, although it occasionally sends raiding
 parties across the border and a few insurgent groups

 Tribal-Based Regional Organizations, Proroyalist
 Groups, Religious Leaders
 Shora-i-Itifaq Islami (United Council of Islamic
 Revolution)
 The Hazara tribes of central Afghanistan were the
 first to unite into a regional grouping to defend their
 homeland from government and Soviet incursions.
 The Shora is a "cooperation" of 31 separate Hazara
 groups under the elected leadership of Syed Ali
 Behishti. The organization serves as the governing
 body of the Hazarajat with two vice chairmen and a
 secretariat subordinate to the chairman of the United
 Council (Behishti). The council is directed by 42
 representatives from various districts who form an
 executive committee. The committee handles its af-
 fairs through five departments-law, public relations,
 military affairs, finance, and friendship affairs.
 Not particularly well-armed, the Hazaras have not
 received any aid from the Peshawar parties, although
 they have been able to buy arms from them on a few
 occasions. Iran has provided the Hazaras with rela-
 tively small quantities of weapons, including Ameri-
 can M-1 semiautomatic rifles and West German G-3
 automatic rifles. The Iranians reportedly have also
 provided a few military advisers to teach the
 Hazaras-with whom the Iranians share the Shia
 brand of Islam-weapons handling and basic tactics.
 It is unlikely that the Khomeini regime, beset with
 numerous problems of its own, is providing a signifi-
 cant amount of aid.
 Regardless of their supply problems, the Hazaras
 have turned their mountain strongholds into a virtual-
 ly autonomous region with Kabul in control of only
 about a half dozen isolated garrisons. The fact that
 very few refugees in either Pakistan or Iran are
 Hazaras testifies to their success
 The Hazaras are also conducting nighttime raids into
 Kabul with a force called the "Kalibdad Freedom
 Fighters Corps," said to have 3,000 fighters based as
 close as 30 kilometers outside Kabul
 The Hazara resistance to some extent may be an
 independence movement. The Hazaras resent their
 second-class status in a country in which all govern-
 ments-including the present one-are dominated by
 Pushtuns. According to one Hazara leader, when the
 Soviets are driven out, the "real war" between the
 Pushtuns and. Hazaras will begin.
 The Panjsheris
 The Tajiks of the strategic Panjsher River valley have
 organized themselves into a self-reliant and formida-
 ble thorn in the side of the main Soviet supply line,
 playing havoc with military convoys on the main
 highway from Kabul northward to the USSR and
 posing a potential threat to Bagrani, one of the main
 Soviet airbases. As a result the Soviets periodically
 have sent powerful columns up the valley to eradicate
 resistance. None have penetrated farther than the end
 of the motora.ble road-about 30 kilometers-and
 some suffered heavy casualties. The Soviets reported-
 ly at one point even tried to block the narrow entrance
 to the valley with a wall
 The valley, now an autonomous entity in the hands of
 its people, runs its own public services, including a bus
 line. The Panjsheris have not been hindered by the
 lack of outside support.
 Konar-Nuristan Organization
 The leader of this tribal-regional group, Dr. Syed
 Shamsuddin Majrooh, served as Minister of Justice
 during 1963-65 and briefly as Deputy Prime Minister
 in 1965. In spite of his governmental experience,
 Majrooh has become an outspoken advocate of the
 primacy of tribalism over political leadership as a
 driving force for the resistance movement. He believes
 that only a coalescence of tribal and regional groups
 within Afghanistan can forge a true national consen-
 sus.

 Secret
 There is very little real cooperation between the
 Nuristanis and the Pushtuns of the Konar Valley,
 traditional tribal enemies. The tribal confederation is
 more a theoretical formulation in the mind of
 Majrooh than a political or military reality. He,
 however, has the support of the well-respected insur-
 gent field commander, Anwar Amin. The Nuristani
 resistance, like that of the Hazaras, is to some degree
 a reaction to Pushtun domination
 Durrani Pushtun Tribes
 Azizullah Wasifi, Minister of Agriculture under
 Daoud, heads a coalition of Durrani Pushtun tribes in
 southwestern Afghanistan from Farah Province to the
 Pakistani border east of the Qandahar. The group
 appears to be proroyalist. (The Afghan royal family
 comes from one of the Durrani tribes.) The collective
 military forces of the group are under the command of
 Ismatullah Achikzai, a former major in the Afghan
 Army. Achikzai reportedly operates three training
 and resupply camps in Pakistan. The degree to which
 he controls the resistance in this area is unclear; many
 insurgent bands do not recognize his authority.
 Central Tribal Confederation
 This loose union of central Afghan tribes encompasses
 the areas of Qonduz, Samangan, Bamian, Ghazni,
 Lowgar, and Kabul Provinces. The central headquar-
 ters is in Khawaat, Chaki Vardak district. As with
 other tribal coalitions, a major reason for uniting
 regionally is frustration with the political maneuver-
 ing and intrigues of the Peshawar political parties.F_
 Islamic Union of Northern Afghan Provinces
 This newly formed organization of Uzbeks living in
 the northern provinces appears to be very successful in
 raiding military convoys coming into Afghanistan
 from the Soviet Union. Numbering about 800 men,
 the group has received some aid in the form of four
 12.7-mm DSHK antiaircraft guns from Rabanni's
 Jamiat.
 Afridi Tribe
 The Afridi tribe, long known for its warlike exploits
 against governmental authority in the area of the
 Khyber Pass, has now joined the fray under the
 leadership of Anwar Afridi, grandson of the famous
 tribal leader, Ajab Khan. The tribe's political sympa-
 thies are proroyalist
 Quetta-Qandahar Group (National Islamic Union)
 Led by Sardar Mohammad Akram, who is said to be
 related to the royal family, this group is headquar-
 tered in Quetta, Baluchistan. It conducts insurgent
 operations in Qandahar and Helmand Provinces.
 Sazman-i-Jihad-i-Akbar-i-Islami (Organization for
 the Great Islamic War)-Baluch Tribe
 This organization, headed by Dost Vakeel Gorgaij
 Baluch, is intended primarily to draw attention and
 support to this ethnic minority in southwestern
 Afghanistan. The Baluch, residing in Qandahar,
 Helmand, Nimruz, and Farah Provinces, are weak
 militarily because of their small numbers, lack of
 supplies, and the open country in which they operate.
 They could, however, because of their kinship ties
 with Pakistani and Iranian Baluch communities, be-
 come vital conduits for external assistance to insur-
 gents in western Afghanistan.
 Afghanistan Islamic National Revolution
 This group is headed by Fazle Rahman Hussanini,
 called Pir Muqtadar Sahib by the faithful, an ac-
 knowledged Afghan religious leader. The Pir claims a
 following of a million fighters, mostly Pushtuns from
 Paktia Province and Pakistan's Waziristan agencies.
 The group receives no arms from the Peshawar groups
 but depends entirely on captured weapons. There is
 nothing to confirm the size of the Pir's group or to
 show that it constitutes a cohesive organization. Also,
 as a political/ military leader the Pir leaves much to
 be desired.
 Unity Ulema-Organization of Afghan Mullahs
 This group of Afghan religious leaders is applying
 considerable pressure for an alliance between the six
 major Peshawar political parties. Although we know
 very little about the group's membership or organiza-
 tion, it was the primary force behind the alliance
 formed in August 1981 of five of the six major
 Peshawar groups. The exclusion of the moderate
 Gailani party may mean that the group is controlled
 by the fundamentalists and designed to cut out those
 having any connections with the regimes of King
 Zahir Shah or Mohammad Daoud

 For some time a proroyalist faction has coalesced in
 Hamburg, West Germany around Dr. Mohammad

 government-in-exile. Under this plan the King would
 assume the role of President with Yusuf as Prime
 Minister and Prince Abdul Wali, the King's son-in-
 law, serving as Minister of Defense. The proposed
 organization is seen as a rallying point capable of
 drawing together the regional/tribal confederations
 and producing a viable government of national con-
 sensus. King Zahir Shah, the only man who could
 realize the plan, has so far declined to leave his refuge
 in Rome or lend his name to the enterprise.
 Loya Jirgah (Grand Assembly)
 During times of crisis in the history of the Afghan
 people, the Loya Jirgah has been convened. Originally
 an assembly of tribal leaders, it fills roughly the same
 role in Afghanistan that a constitutional convention
 does in the United States. The last one that met in
 Afghanistan ratified the constitution presented by
 President Daoud and formally elected him President.
 Convened again in the early summer of 1980, the
 Loya Jirgah carried some promise of bringing togeth-
 er the disparate elements of the insurgency, both
 political and tribal. It soon became clear, however,
 that the fundamentalists, especially Gulbuddin Hek-
 matyar's Islamic Party, would not tolerate a challenge
 to their privileged position in the insurgent movement.
 The lack of support from the fundamentalists and the
 inability to weld the moderates and the regional/
 tribal groups into a working union ensured that the
 Loya Jirgah would slowly fade into dissolution. There
 are occasional reports that either the Jirgah will
 reconvene or a new Jirgah will be held.
 Qaum-i-Itihad (Tribal Union)
 This is nothing more than a catchall phrase expressing
 the intense frustration of the indigenous Afghan
 insurgent leadership with the inability or unwilling-
 ness of the Peshawar political parties to provide
 significant assistance to the fighters in the field.
 Although an expression of the popular will, this effort
 is doomed without the support of a powerful patron,
 such as the king.
 Several individuals and groups connected with the
 Afghan insurgency operate between legitimacy and
 fraud. Some appear to be well-meaning people who
 lack the resources and support to contribute effective-
 ly to the resistance; others limit themselves to propa-
 ganda in Western countries and do not claim a role in
 the insurgency. But some are simply confidence men.
 Sadudin Schpoon and Bahauddin Majrooh
 Both professors, Schpoon and Majrooh (son of Dr.
 Syed Shamsuddin Majrooh of the Kunar-Nuristan
 Organization.) are well-known Afghan intellectuals
 and articulate spokesmen for the insurgent cause both
 in the media and on occasion in the halls of the US
 Congress. They identify most closely with the political
 philosophy of Ahmad Gailani, although Schpoon has
 ties with Younus Khalis, and Majrooh has some links
 with Mojadedi. Reportedly they have formed an
 organization called AGEL (an acronym derived from
 its Pushtun name), which enlists expatriate "adven-
 turers" to train recruits in guerrilla tactics and the use
 of weapons. Nothing much should be expected from
 this particular effort.
 Alliance of Former Afghan Generals (Group Still
 Unnamed)
 the following
 exiled Afghan generals are prepared to form a new
 Afghan resistance group:
 ? Alam Omar Olomi, former Deputy Chief of Staff
 and commander of forces in Paktia Province, is a
 leader of the Mohammad tribe in Helmand
 Province.
 ? Abdul Kariim Mustaghni, former Chief of Staff
 and Defense Minister, purports to have influence in
 Vardak Province.
 ? Mohammad Arif, a former Army general, has
 followers in Paktia Province.

 Secret
 ? Abdul Salam Malkyar, former Deputy Chief of
 Staff, has followers in Ghazni Province.
 ? Qamruddeen Nassri, former commander of the 7th
 Division stationed in Kabul, claims to have influ-
 ence in Lowgar and Laghman Provinces as well as
 around Jalalabad.
 ? Mohammad Hussein Abassi, former chief of per-
 sonnel affairs of the Ministry of Defense, has
 influence among the Hazara tribes.
 ? Mohammad Akram, former commander of forces in
 Nahrin Province, has a number of followers in
 Baghlan Province, including the area around the
 Chinese border.
 The group claims to be opposed to the corruption and
 ineffectiveness of the six major Peshawar political
 parties and to have no connection with royalist fac-
 tions. The group's claims to widespread tribal influ-
 ence within Afghanistan are suspect, however, be-
 cause most of the generals have been absent from
 tribal areas so long that ties with tribesmen have
 eroded. Furthermore, many tribesmen are deeply
 suspicious of professional military men
 Col. Mohammad Zarif Qader
 Living in Frankfurt, West Germany, former Col.
 Mohammad Zarif Qader represents himself as the
 chief of the major Peshawar insurgent groups, with a
 strength of 3 million followers and 100,000 fighters.
 There is nothing to substantiate the Colonel's grandi-
 ose claims.
 Itihad-i-Mujahiddin-i-Islami Afghanistan (Union of
 Islamic Freedom Fighters of Afghanistan)
 The Itihad is a Hazara insurgent group founded in
 Quetta two years ago and led by Haji Rasul. The
 group's representatives complain about the Pakistani
 Government's aid to the Pushtun-dominated political
 parties in Peshawar to the exclusion of non-Pushtuns
 like the Hazaras. The group also claims that it
 receives no aid from Iran and is opposed to the
 Khomeini brand of Islamic fundamentalism.
 This Hazara group appears to be of little importance
 when compared to the much larger and effective
 Shora-i-Itifaq led by Syed Ali Behishti
