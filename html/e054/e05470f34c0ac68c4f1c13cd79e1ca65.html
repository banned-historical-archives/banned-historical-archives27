New York Times Summary 
International 
The three veteran Soviet 
leaders Molotov, Kaganovitch 
and Malenkov have been dis-
missed from their high Govern-
ment as well as their party 
leadership positions, the Krem-
lin announced. Reports in 
Poland said they were under 
house arrest. The Soviet Gov-
ernment was represent0 at the 
United States Embassy's In-
dependence Day reception by 
Foreign Minister Gromyko, 
First Deputy Premier Mikoyan 
and Nikolai M. Shvernik, one of 
tile new appointees to the party 
Presidium. [Page 1, Column 8,.1 
The dismissal of two inern-
hers of the Rumanian Comm-
ilist party Politburo was an-
nounced, amid indications that 
advance notice of the Moscow 
decisions had been sent to other 
Communist parties. [1:6.] 
In China, the news was pub-
lished and broadcast without 
comment. But observers noted 
tbat the eclipse of Kaganovitch 
and Molotov made Mao Tse-
thng more than ever the 
senior living Communist in the 
World. 14:6.1 
_ 
Meanwhile Muscovites went 
about their shopping in the 
shadow of the Kremlin, and 
expreased their hope that the 
party in its wisdom had served 
the misuse of peace and pros-
lieritT. There were a. few who 
4ared to disagree with the 
changes. [1:6-7.) 
. In Washington, there was a 
holiday calm very different 
from what would have been 
going On a few years ago. Both 
the President and the Secretary 
of State were out of town, and 
the Voice of America was put-
ting out entirely unofficial re-
actions to the news. [1:7.] 
Experts on Soviet affairs 
thought Defense Minister Zhu-
kov would be the No. 2 man in 
the reshuffled regime. [2:4-5.] 
Prime Minister Nehru of In-
dia said in London that the 
changes meant a return to nor-
mality after a long revolution-
ary period. [2:3.] 
Senator Humphrey proposed 
the formation of a United Na-
tions Good Offices Commission 
to explore means of solving the 
problem of the 900,000 Arab 
refugees from Palestine. He said 
that Israel should accept a 
d'token" number of repatriates, 
and that the rest should be 
settled in Jorden, Iraq, and 
other Arab states. 11:4.1 
The Egyptian Defense Minis-
ter flew unexpectedly to Saudi 
Arabia, apparently in an effort 
to ease the strained relations 
between the two countries and 
to revive President Nasser's goat 
of a neutralist bloc. [8:4-5.]

to fashion experts at a special 
audience with the personnel of

WASHINGTON, July 3 --
..e.eMe.. tle ...I.....e. cola Leto 
he was thinking of sharing' with 
the Soviet Union and other com-
es the knowledge of how to 
. produce "Mean" hydrogen bombs. 
Sort * step would require 
legislation, be said. But he dis-
closed that he nad asked his 
scientific advisers about. the pos-
sibility of sharing, and they had 
suggested such a course might 
be adopted as soon as they had 
proved they could produce a 
bomb totally free of dangerous 
radioactive fall-out. 
The President saki that in the 
meantime he intended to invite 
foreign countries lo make their 
own measurements of the per-
centage of radioactivity on the 
site of the next United States, 
hydrogen bomb detonation, 
This should serve as an aP-1 
propriate test by doubters of the: 
contention that 'even now only; 
4 per cent radioactivity results 
from the explosion of United. 
States hydrogen bombs, the 
Prenident declared. 
It-eaS Given la Others 
President Eisenhower opened 
his news conference with an an-
nouncement that the United 
States was making more man-
WM-235 available in the peaceful 
uses of atomic power. . 
In response to questions about 
Carted States policy on disarm-
am.ent and the effects on that 
policy of reduced radioactive 
fended, in bomb explosions, the; 
President emphasized: 
!The United States stands[ 
firm on its position at the Lon-
don disarmament conference,: 
?agreeing to a temporary suspen-
sion of nuclear arms tests if it 
will lead to an end of bomb-
making. 
011ie United States disarm-
ament position Was carefully 
f worked out over $ period of at 
least three years and its pro-
posals are not designed to refute 
allegations of insincerity. 
9The United States' effort to 
produce "clean" bombs is in-
Emoted to make peaetime uses of 
nuclear energy possible, for 
:example, in the building of 
jtunnels or in moving mountains. 
Need: of Unity Strearsed 
The President also discussed 
at some length the importance of 
coordinating United States dis-
armament proposals with those 
of its pities. 
"You don't want to go to the 
Soviets; or to any other nation, 
for exempla and make a pro-
posal that affects a third coun-
try without that third country's 
a.pproval, because then you sud-
denly become like Napoleon and 
Alexander, on a raft in the 
. Vistula, settling the fate of 
Europe?' 
The President referred to a. 
meeting in 1807 that took place. 
on the river Neeman, or Memel. 
?We are not doing that," he? 
continued, stressing that the 
Icing laborious process of work-: 
ing out policies required con-
sultation with West Germany,' 
France, Britain, Canada and all 
the countries .of the North At': 
lantic Treaty Organization. 
With some heat he responded 
to a question whether the United 
States "dare" be sincere in dis-
armament by declaring, "You 
mustn't think that this whole 
business of disarmament fluid 
as it is, is operated on the hares 
of shooting from the hip." 
President Eisenhower stressed 
the "political, psychological ef-
fects" of getting on with a dis-
armament agreement, "even if 
you suffered some scientific dis-
advantage" 
The President did not specify 
what these disadvantages might 
be, but presumably he referred 
Co testimony by scientists of ? the 
Atomic Energy Commiesion that 
s. suspension of nuclear arms 
testa would impede the develop-
ment of new weapons as well as 
peacetime protects. 
However, Charles E. Wilson, 
Secretary of Defense, has said 
[Jett a sueponsion of nuclear 
sems tests would not halt the 
development of the long-range 
ballistics missile, 'since the de-
irelopment of delivery systems 
could continue. 
In addition Secretary Wilson 
eats said that suspension of the 
Melees, arms tests would con-
stitute little more than a "nui-
sance," and need not affect the 
international arms race at, Ml. 
The President revealed, in re-
iponse to a 'question, that when 
as set down the final disarma-
ment position for the talks in 
London last May 25, he knew 
Mat the United States had sue-
teeded in reducing bomb radio-
rictivIty fall-out by at least 90 
cer cent. 
'Clean' Bomb Data Lacking 
But no one bad suggested to 
nin at the time that "complete-
y clean" bombs were possible, 
Othough Lewis L. Strauss, 
?hairman of the Atomic Energy 
,Iommission, had forecast "N 
ser cent clean" bombs, General 
Eisenhower went on. 
Then the President said, "in-
?Mentally," while there was 
'very hopeful." talk of suspend. 
rig tests, he planned to invite 
my country in the world that 
canted to come to test the radio-
settee fall-out of United States 
somas to do so "if, ever tinder 
my circumstances there is &n-
ether test made."

`CLEAN' BOMB DATA

Hickenlooper for Plan 
Special to The New Yore Time. 
WASHINGTON, July 4. Co 
Lion that this country give U e 
Soviet Union the formula for a 
"clean" hydrogen bomb appeared 
today to be weighted oil the u - 
favorable side. 
William F. Knowland of Ca - 
Contra the Senate Republican,' 
leader, said he deubted that Co 
James C. Hagerty, Whit? 
House press secretary, eon:Innen 
[afterward that this was not r 
reference to the current nuclear 
test series in Nevada, 
In answer to the questio 
whether there wag any way I I 
which the United States tout 
share its knowledge of precis:min 
clean bombs, the President it 
plied that he had raised the-
westion himself "the second th 
scientists talked to me about it. 
And the scientists told Mu 
'Why, the minute that we hay 
srovedwhat we say we ar 
. , . 
going to prove. Why, we would 
want them to have ft," Presider.. 
Eisenhower continued. 
It appeared from the transcrigt 
of the President's remarks that 
he had not himself advocated 
this action, but it was clear that 
he had thought about it ant 
raised the possibility without 
prompting. 
Last week President Eiser-
lower MM that he hoped the 
eussians would learn how t 
take a bomb free of radioaetiv 
Otil-out and that, in the even. 
A' war, that was the kind a: 
weapon they would use. 
"We are trying to make IIM4 
maths, clean hornba, and to de-
velop usefulness in a peacefut 
vorld, as well as just weapons 
war," he said. . 
"There are devices that ar 
cot necessarily weapons," h

furnish the Soviet Union with 
such information. 
Senator Nne Mansfield, 
Democrat of Montana, said: 
'I would be careful about glv-
i Mg our formula away.'' 
, President Eisenhower, at his 
; news conference yesterday, said 
'that some nuclear scientists had 
told him that they favored giv-
ing the Soviet Union and other 
nations information about mak-
ing a bomb relatively free of 
radioactive fall-out. General 
Eisenhower did not say explic-
itly that he favored this course 
hanself. 
96.70 of Fall-Out Eliminated 
Previously, the President had 
noted that scientists believed 
that they had eliminated about 
96 per cent of the radioactive 
fall-out from such devices and 
with time could reduce the 
amount even more, 
Representative Chet Holifield, 
Democrat of California, a mem-
ber of the Joint Congressional 
Atomic Commission, said: 
'If the President means that 
we should reveal to the Soviets 
how to make a clean bomb or 
any other kind of bomb, this is a 
complete reversal of our national 
policy and security." 
Stich a step would require 
Congressional approval. 
The President did not say any-
thing about dieclosing bomb 
-
making secrets, but only a for-
mula for avoiding most fall-out. 
Senator Bourke B. Ilickem 
looper, Republican of Iowa, also 
a member of the Joint Atomic 
Committee, indicated cautious 
support of the proposal. 
"Through such programs as 
this," les said, " we may be able 
some day to obtain assurances 
that in event of another war all 
nations will have clean bombs." 
Knowiand Is Doubtful 
Senator Knowland remarked: 
411 doubt that Congress would 
be prepared to turn over any 
weapons information to the So-
viet Union." 
Mr. Mansfield, in an interview, 
deceased, "Before we agree to 
give thern a.ny information we 
certainty should have an iron-
clad agreement., backed by 
sscape-proof inspection arrange-
ments to do away with the 
building of the bigger bombs and 
a disarmament plan which would 
tut down defense expendituies 
for all countries." 
Senator Mansfield, the acting 
Democratic leader. toldthe Sen-
ate yesterday that the search 
or a [?'elean" bomb must not 
be permitted to obscure attempts 
to reach an agreement to ban 
future testing of large bombs. 
.E am not at all convinced that 
ULC use of a 'clean' bomb would 
automatically displace the use 
f hydrogen weapons which 
would spread radioactive fall-out 
over a lareg area," he said, "We 
as Americans may not use 'dirty' 
bombs, but who is to say that

Better knowledge of the lone-
ular World Day in the Interna-
tional Geophysical Year. The 
World Day is a period of in. 
tensified observations throughout 
the world of the phenomena 
manifesting the link between the 
earth and the sun. 
It came close to what might 
prove to be the climax of the 
eleven-year sunspot cycle, but it 
caught several of the partic-
ipants with their rockets not 
completed. 
Sixty-four, days have been set 
aside during the eighteen months 
of the International Geophysical 
Year as Regular World Days. 
They occur three or four times a 
month and are timed to coincide 
with the new moon, quarter 
moon or with expected meteor 
showers. 
The moon was in Its first. 
quarter yesterday and a shower 
of. meteors was expected to del' 
ug- the earth's atmosphere. 
Clouds of meteors, most of them 
hardly larger than grains of 
sand, orbit about the sun or fol-
low other paths that bring them 
near the earth at predictable 
times. 
Data Sought on Flares 
When they plunge into the 
atmosphere they become shoot-
ing stars as they are consumed 
fected. ? 
The key man In today's experi-
ments was a 36-year-old elec-
trical engineer front the Naval 
Research Laboratory. John E. 
Jackson devised the experiments: 
to be performed. They entailed 
the following: 
Each rocket had two whip-
like antennae clasped tight to 
the air frame at take-off but 
rigged to extend like out-
stretched arms abler the rocket 
had emerged into thin air, Radar, 
devices were set to record the 
rocket's position. 
Canadian scientists tried to 
beam vertical sigoals from 
ground to ionosphere to take 
readings that, in the past, had 
given useful but imprecise pic-
tures of ionospheric activity. , 
Today these measurements were 
blacked out, by intense ionos-
pheric activity. It is because 
such aberrations are prevalent 
in the arctic that much of the 
rocket research is concentrated 
here. 
What the scientists counted on 
calculating from all the sta-
tistics were such data as: 
The density of electrons at 
various os 
MOS hectoric_a_nitudes; the 
ffirdpinagnetic 
field, and the frequency ofelec-

Although the cycle of sunspots

ling the effects of recent flares; 
on the sun as part of the Intern 
national Geophysical Year. 
The latest flare was imported 
yesterday at Britain's largest 
radio research station at Slough, 
about twenty miles from London. 
When a researcher noticed' that 
an instrument called a vertical 
sounder- was no longer recording 
as it should have been. 
Vertical sounders are used to 
hurl radio signals into the iono-
sphere at regular intervels. By 
noting the height at which sig-
nals are reflected back to earth, 
researchers can calculate the 
density of layers of electrified 
particles from heights of about 
forty-five miles upward. 
The radio teams at Slough 
also found that it was impossible 
to pick up the wavelength of a 
British Broadcasting Corpora-
tion long-range transmitter In 
North Wales, on which they 
carry out routine studies in 
radio-wave fluctuations. 
Inquiries at ten other radio 
and ionospheric research stations 
showed that all experimental 
short- wave transmissions had 
been blanketed by the initial im-
pact of the wave of ultraviolet 
light from the flaring sun.

PRESIDENT EISENHOW- , 
aame time this afternoon a 
re:dement on the making

more 17-235 or equivalent for 
use both at home and abroad 
in the development of peaceful

CHALMERSIt ROBERTS 
of The Washington Post and 
Times-Herald?Mr. President, 
as a result of your remarks 
last week on disarmament at 
the press ennference, especial-
ly what you told us about the 
scientists who called on you, 
there appeats to be some im-
pression, both at home and 
abroad, that you and the Ad-
ministration are less enthusi-
astic about a disarmament 
agreement than you had been 
previously. Could you straight-
en us out on that, sir? 
At ?Welt I think if you will 
ratan my statement?arid now 
ma just depending upon my 
memory-4 think I started out 
by saying the Hinted States 
elands firmly by the agree-
ment and the offers it has 
made in this regard, and we 
have not withdrawn from that 
position. 
I tailed to your attention a 
fact that coming tip as a 
rather new one in this whole 
scientific field, kept this sub. 
bet ever from being a stabs 
suet It ta at very dynamic, fluid 
sort of subject that you are 
working with all the time, but 
I I think I said last 'week that 
the political, paycheiogical et- ' 
I feels of doing this, going ahead 
I with this thing, were so great 
that even if you suffered some 
7CiPilt Vic disadvantage, we 
I should go ahead with it, and 
stai believe that very firm-
ly; and under the?under the 
conditions that: the United a, 
States has always insisted tts 
on. that is, that we have ant-
ficient inspectma to know that th 
InP are both honest...doing what h 
we said we would do, and that fa 
it is coupled with some agree- h 
'sent that at some future date 
We will cease Making bombs 
out, of this material, and de-
vote It all to peaceful purposes, 
our offer always stands. el:

an charges that he killed an -14 
Algerian. Do you think he at 
should be turned over to our ha 
aittherities? there th 
was a short report made to sue St 
about it, but, as I recall, this at 
was off-duty, and I hope we er, 
are talking about the same F

? URN SCALA of The As-
lated Press?In order to 
p Us understand the dis-
ament picture a little 
re clearly, sir, could you 
its whether on May 295, at 
ich time you laid down the , 
:lc guidelines for our dis-
ament policy, whether you 
-w that it might be pos. 
IC within four or five years 
produce an absolutely 
. bomb, if tests contin-
; and, secondly, could you 
? tell us, sir, how the 
spect of being able to 
duce a clean bomb affects 
It you told us was your 
dive, several weeks ago, 
lely, total elimination of 
in weapons ? 
.--Well, now, there ate 
'ces that ate not acres-
ly weapons. If you had 
clean, completely clean, 
net, I should think that 
nilding of tunnels, or you 
kit say, moving mountains 
that sort of thing, you 
d have many economical, 
I, peaceful purposes for 
thing and, of course, you 
Idn't want to deny civil', 
the opportunity of us-
it. 
to the first Pali of your 
'Lion, May 25th, I knew 
flat time that We had sue-
ed in reducing the radio-
o fall-out from bombs by 
cast 90 per cent, No one 
suggested to me at that 
cnt that we were going 
lake it completely clean, 
ugh Admiral (Lewis L.] 
uss [chairman of the 
to Energy Commission] 
told me that It was cer-
we would get down to 
95, 96 per cent. which 
?tting very close to it, 
identally, now we are ; 
ng, and very hopefully 
t, about some kind of 
'Won of tests, But if, 
under any circumstances 
, is another test made, I 
ming to invite any cous-
in the world that wants 
me and fire its rockets in 
ir and see just exactly 
much radio !radioactive] 
'lit there is from those 
s because we are not 
g to make at this ?to 
bigger bombs, as I have 
you before. We are try-
to make small bombs, 
bombs, and to develop 
Inns in a peaceful world, 
ell as just Weapons of 
D MaeLEISH of West. 
'use Broadcasting? Sir, 
-resident, yesterday Sen-
[John F4 Kennedy, Dem-
of Massachusetts, told 
Senate that the 'United 
s policy should express a 
ger opposition to west-
colonialism, such as 
cc's position In Algeria. 
ell as to Communist im-
ism. Do you see any 
,s by which this op/tom-
' 1,9 is In 
expreici-.In our'irescrit-rior.: 
des. 
A.?Well, / Understand the 
Secretary of State commented 
at some length on this matter 
yesterday. As I have told you 
before, nothing is more com-
plicated than the questions 
and prolamin that involve for-
eign policy; and any attempt 
to oversimplify them and just ? 
to make one great statement , 
of principle and truth and then 
say, "That's that, no more," 
Is to ignore the other side of , 
equally intricate problems. 
For example, take it at 
home: I was just asked. a : 
question about civil rights. 
From one side of this picture i 
there is no question. But from 
the side of people who have 
lived with a very, very deft-
the social problem for a num-
ber of years, there are almost 
violent reactions on the other 
side. 
Now,, the same way foreign 
policy, in here you have the?
you have the whole standing 
of America in the world in-
volved, the standing of Amer-
ica as a fair nation trying to 
be decent to all, not taking 
any particular sides in either 
domestic. or in international 
quarrels, trying to be a friend 
to lead back to peace. And I 
believe the United States' best 
role as a leader in the world 
today is te. try tO.be under-
standing to bags Wes in any 
quarrel if .it is any of our 
business, and we are invited 
in any -way and try to lead 
them back to peace. 
Now, that means often you 
work behind the scenes, be-
cause you don't get up and 
begin to shout about such 
things or there will be no 
effectiveness. Generally speak-
ing, though, I would say read 
Mr. Dulles' report or reac-
tion to this, which I agree 
Pryrb Knowledge 
P. BRANDT of 
Mr. President, is ,there any 
way in which we can share our 
knowledge on clean bombs 
with Russia and the other na-
tions which might develop 
theni? A.---Well, I raised that 
question, Mr. Brandt, the sec-
ond the scientists talked to me 
about it, and they said, 'Why, 
the minute that we have 
proved what we say we are 
going to prove, why, we would 
want them to have it." That 
Is just what they 
Q.?That would require leg-
islation, of course? A.--
would think so, yes. 
MARTIN S. HAYDEN o 
The Detroit News?Sir, would 
you elaborate adittle more on 
this statement that you made 
that future atomic tests are 
going to be open to any coun-
try that wants to come to 
watch them? A --Well, I saki 
this- well, I don't mean to say 
you take the men and show 
them all your formula, and all 
that sort of thing as to what , 
you have done. But I said ter-
Mikilbtitt dtt Weird 
CPYRGHT 
Conference 
the proposition U1T1t1? 
nest 0.1 Lawrence and Dr, 
[Edward] Teller brought to 
e, that eventually you could 
eke completely clean bombs, 
nd that even now you are 06 
r cent clean, that it, you 
aye only 4 per cent of radio-
Malty, radioactive fallout, 
at you did in the original 
mb, I say we would be glad 
ask any nation there to put 
s proper instruments in the 
ir to detect whether or not 
en' contention is true. 
LILLIAN LEVY of The Na-
onal Jewish Post, Indiana-
lis?Congressman (Ray J.I 
ridden 9Democrat] of Indiana 
as proposed a resolution that 
[fluid require all questions 
sed in radio and TV broad-
? sts of interviews with Com-
, unist leaders to be subject 
advance clearance by the 
ecretary of State and the di-
tor of C. L A. Do you 
? have, Mr, that such vestries: 
ons can serve any useful 
irpose? 
A.?Well, I dent?you ask 
? question can it serve any 
eful purpose: I say this; 
hat our tradition of a free 
? ess and tree access to 
owledge and to opinion is 
?t only very great, but it is 
aranteed really by the Con-
nation, and I would think 
y such process as you talk 
,out would align, us with that 
'pe of country where gov-
mental, political goveni-
ental, action is a dominant 
dor instead of the kind of 
?mocratte processes that we 
? lieve in so thoroughly. 
DOUGLASS CATER JR. of

within the past year 
iu have failed to reappoint 
r. Dewey Adams of the 
A, B. and Mr, Harry Cain 
the Subversive Activities 
introl Board, and Mr. 
homes E.! Murray of the

at you do not look favorably 
the right of the dissenter 
ithin these regulatory com-
issions, I wonder if you could 
just say broadly what is your 
philosophy about the right to 
dissent upon these commis-
sions? 
A.---Well, if someone would 
hear sonic of the conversa-
tions and discussions in con-
ferences in my of Lice there 
would be no doubt about my 
approval of the right to dis-
sent, I appoint people to of-
fice on the basis of the hest I 
tank I can find and I am re-
sponsible to myself and to my 
own conscience it appointing 
them that way, and that Is 
the way I do- it. 
PETER LISACCIII of The 
Chicago Daily News?To get 
back to the French-Algerian 
question for just a moment-, 
A. Get back to what? 
Q.?The French - Algerian 
dispute for just a moment?
Q,?When he returned from 
Africa, Vice President Nixon 
made a -report to you about 
the situation in Algeria, as we 
understand it. Could you tell 
us whether he mace any spe-
cific changes for the Admin-
istration to take a different 
approach in the matter? A.--
No no. As a matter of fact, 
5 
CPYRGHT 
13 0 eq, 
about that,. and, I believe, .1 
not mention it in his writo 
report. That is the way I r 
cam because he was not eon 
alls' Orilefed to go to Algeri. 
in that trip. He went to scan 
of the other countries, 
He merely pled for, or roe 
mornended, understanding am 
...........g tote fair to both sides 
1 because there is a terrific ar? 
gument. After all, there is 
one million three or tour hun-
dred thousand Europeans in 
the country, and just 'turning 
the whole thing loose could 
well result in a very great 
disaster 
I don't know exactly what 
to go about it, but it is one 
that you study, realizing It is 
an internal problem primarily 
because Algeria was pact of 
metropolitan letallee, at least 
legally, and you try to jest be 
as fair and square and helpful 
as you can. 
EDWARD P. MORGAN of 
The American Broadcasting 
, 
Company-- Mr. President, 
would it be correct to infer 
from your invitation this 
morning about the witnessing 
of nuclear explosions and the 
Ill rthcoming announcement 
t his. afternoon about the in-
creased gist Himhim of I heee 
that the A diundstration is at-
tempting in this way to refute 
i the a I-guinea Mid Vd7 dare 
i not be as sincere in disarma-
ment as ire would like to be? 
Ir am thinking in terms of the. 
debate Belt has berm going on 
as to whid we would lose and 
what we would gain by sus? 
pending test a. 
A.----Mr. Morgan now yea 
needn't think that this whole 
business of disarmament, Boil 
as it: is, is operdod on the 
bans of shooting Boni the hip. 
For throe long years every-
body' in the Government, with 
the aid of task Woes, of 
which we have had people like 
Dr. Lawrence a MI Gee Bedell 
:Smith, and people of that kind 
have been working on this 
thing to develop a pokey for 
the United States. You take 
that policy and ,you try to find 
out, how it would affect, ether 
nations, 
You don't Want to go to the 
. 
Sends or to any other nation, 
ter example, and make a pro-
posai that affects a third 
country without that third 
country's approval, because 
teen you suddenly become like 
Napoleon arid Alexander, on a 
raft in the Vistula, settling 
the fate 01 Enrope, 
We are not dcang that, SO 
? you do have, though, the prob-
lem, atter yen make out a, 
program that Beelike logical 
and decent, to us on a. country, 
Ii y go and take up the prob. 
Inn with Germany, with 
Frantic, with NATO, the whole 
NATO group, with Britain, 
with Canada, eVarybOdy that 
in affected by that proposal, 
in order that you don't Just 
destroy the whole effort by 
sadden recalcitrance because 
someone believes their Own 
sovereignty or their own 
rights have been ignored. 
Now, we have very valued 
allies and friends and we try 
to work with them very, very 
closely in all such things. Now 
this means that from time to 
thee, as new information be-
comes available, It becomes 
very difficult or, I mean, it 
takes a long, sort of iaborious 
process, to get. everybody in 
line again. This is not easy

On the Grandchildren's Future 
CPYRGHT 
? By Walter Lippmann 
MARSHAL TITO. it turned 
out, has more than enough to 
do without being drawn ;into 
: the discussion, which was 
:started by 
: Ishrushc he so 
about social-
' ism and Airier-
scan grand 
; children. This 
may have 
been mere dis-
cretion but I 
rather sus-
pect that Tito 
!has learned 
from his own 
varied expert- Lippman 
, race that long-range ? predict-
thins about the future of a so-
cial system are almost certain 
to express little more than the 
prophet's hopes or fears. Al-
though Marxists like to think 
'that they possess the secrets 
t of history, no Marxist. tore 
:saw, or could have foreseen, 
:what now goes by the name of 
t socialism in Yugoslavia. 
The only thing' we know for 
:certain is that in the twent 
?eth century, there is a rapid 
;arid unpredictable evolution 
in every society, except pee-
!haps in the most primitive 
:and isolated. Kbrushchey does 
not know, he cannot know 
,wtiat will develop in Russia in 
:ten years, much less in Amer-
Ica in thirty years. 
The Communist world from 
:China to Yugoslavia and Po-
land, including Russia itself, 
is not proceeding at-cording to 
some grand plan, revealed by 
Marx and Lenin, which leads 
to a common end; the various 
Communist regimes are feel-
ing their way, seeking reme-
dies and solutions for their 
tactical difficulties, and they 
are rationalizing the absence 
of a grand and universal 
principle by saying that there 
are many roads to socialism, 
As they take these many and 
!differing roads, they will he-
gome Many and differing sod. 
tties 
Casa 
IF NO ONE KNOWS what 
'socialism will he like in 1W0 
generations, neither does any. 
'one know what the American 
eronomy will be like.. It will 
Or course, not be like the Rus-
sian or the Chinese today. 
We can be sure of that he-
cause the controlling princi-
ple in both Russia and in 
China is the rapid and forced 
development of an economi-
cally and technologically back-
ward country. The American 
economy, as Communist think-
ers themselves often say, has 
long since reached a stage of 
development which Russia is 
still struggling to reach, 
which China has hardly be-
gun to approach. 
SO we can be sure that while 
our grandchildren will nape-
tinnce great changes in the 
A inericaa economy, these 
changes will not bra reaction 
to and a recapitulation or the 
Russian and Chinese experi-
ence. Communism may rep) 
resent a future to A priMitive 
country like China. But for 
America, Communism is heel. 
event, having nothing to dn 
with our highly &kapott and 
complex economy. 
The American social order 
has changed greatly in this 
century, so greatly that terms 
like capitalism and free en-
terprise and competition, 
which come down to its from 
the nineteenth century, no 
longer describe our economy 
There have been the wars, 
and the rise of the United 
States as a world power with 
a great military establishment. 
There has been the fabulous, 
indeed explosive, increase of 
the American population. 
There has been not only the 
deep and wide technological 
development, but, with the on 
ganization of scientific re-
search, a radically new pace 
in the application of science. 
There has been also, so at 
least it seems to me, a non-
violent? but nevertheless rev-
olutionary ehan le in the 
inner principle of our own 
social economy. This is the 
new principle, which goes by 
the prosaic name of "full em-
cloym en t"?the imperative 
that the Government must 
use the fiscal and other 
powers of the state to keep 
the demand for labor at least 
equal to the supply. 
Until the present generation 
this principle was unknown 
to, much less was it the policy 
of, the United States or any 
other capitalist nation. Its 
adoption marks a profound 
change. It would not in my 
view be an exaggeration to 
say that It has brought about 
a revolution in the West which 
has made the Communist rev-
olutionary propaganda irrele-
vant and antiquated. 
For when the Governrryent 
is committed to the mainte-
nance of full employment, the 
bargaining power of labor is 
underwritten, This means a 
decisive change in the balance 
of forces within our society, 
Ns, 
THE NEW PRINCIPLF, of 
full employment was formu-
lated during the great depres-
sion between the two world 
wars. Its technique is based 
on the discovery during the 
first world war that a govern-
ment can promote production, 
regardless of the gold supply. 
by managing credit and the 
currency. The impulse to ap-
ply the technique of war fi-
nance to the pe?atetime econ-
omy came from the' huge un-
employment' and the vast 
misery of the great depres. 
shim The commitment to the 
new policy CMOS from the 
voters who, having learned 
that unemployment can he 
prevented, wilt rot tolerate 
any government which does 
not prevent it. 
Although the principle or 
ti.el employment was worked 
out under Roosevelt and 'fru-
:man, it is now national policy 
from which no public :man, 
who expects to have a future? 
would think ,of dissenting. 
cs1.3 
WE It AVE not begun to see 
the full consequences of the 
new principle. But la all 
probability, it is the real reau 
son why it appeared that the 
inflation in which we find our 
selves cannot be stopped by 
the orthodox devices of tight 
money and a balanced budget. 
It may well be that, a gradual 
inflation is the inseparable 
accompaniment of the policy 
of full employment, and that 
the two together will gradu-
ally hut inexorably work a 
great transformation in the 
American way of life. 
YRGHT  
it, ion the other hand, there 
is CO shooting from the hip. 
It 'is' all based on long, earnest 
tidies by the finest people we 
can get together.

RGH.Stepping Out 
In terms or its impact on worm opinion, Tne 
American response to Russia's proposal foie a 
suspension of nuclear weapon tests seems grudg-
ing ;rid conditional. Valerian Zorin, the Soviet 
deleg ite to the London conference, offered a two? 
to th cc-year cessation of tests. Harold Stassen, 
the A,nerican delegate, has now offered in return, 
in behalf of the United States, to halt nuclear 
tests for 10 months, provided the Russians will 
agree tU,. stop making bomb material, with an 
actual cutoff about 1959. It would have reflected 
much greater credit on the United States if the 
initial suspension proposal had come from this 
country with the support of its allies. Unfortu-
nately, the difficulties of securing agreement in 
the West have enabled Russia to seize the 
iMtiative. 
Ten months is not a very long or impressive 
suspension period. It was made brief, nn dnubt, 
in order to fix a deadline for Soviet acceptance 
of the proposed halt in production of fissionables. 
But the tentative nature of the American suspen-
sion plan, together with the condition attached 
' to a gives rise. inescapably, to some suspicion 
that the United States is less enthusiastic about 
achieving agreement than it might be. And this 
suspicion may well have been augmented by the 
hope which President Eisenhower expressed at 
his news conference a week ago that a completely 
'clean" bomb might be developed if testing could 
continue. 
At his news conference yesterday, the President 
helped to dispel this suspicion. The political and 
psychological benefits of reaching some agreement 
with the Russians would be so great, he pointed 
out, that they would outweigh the scientific dis-
advantages of suspending further tests. For this 
reason, he said, he still believes firmly that the 
United States should go ahead with the effort to 
work out a firm agreement. This seems to us 
the heart of the matter. The political and psycho-
logical benefits are so immensely important that 
they would warrant acceptance of a single-step 
stispension agreement if the two-step proposal 
advanced by the , United States could not he 
achieved, One step leads to another. The Ind's-
'pensable thing is to get moving.

-brother Danger 
In Red Approach 
There ts another danger in 
accepting' the Soviet piecemeal 
approach. This is a slippery 
slope. Once a suspension of tests 
was in effect, it would then be 
argued that we stannic' accept, 
the Russian proposals for con-
ventional disarmament. 
'Don't complicate things b, 
making a German settlement a 
precondition' we should be told. 
Soviet propaganda would parade 
:heir latest reductions from 4,6 
to 2.8 million men. conveniently 
ignoring that the purpose of 
those cuts was mat disarmament

British and Amatican public,

Opposition by Messrs. Melotov, 
; Malertov and Kaganovich to the 
!abolit on of these compulsory 
&live-les was listed by the 
party yesterday as. one of the 
reasoi s for their dismissal. 
Deaeloprnents at the top of 
pyran id of the Soviet leadership 
were almost the only topic of 
conve sation at the traditional 
July 4 reception given today by 
the V ated States Embassy. The 
party was held at Spaso Rouse, 
the Ambassador's residence, 
where Richard Davis, Charge 
d'Affe res, acted as host. 
The Soviet leadership was rep-
resent el only by Anastas I.

usual elves as they chatted and 
1drank with members of Mos-
leceses iplornatie community and 
host of visiting Americans. 
Asked what effect the re-
moval of Messrs. Molotov, 
,Maienhav and Kaganovleh would 
have Mr. Mikoyan relined: 
"everything will be the same, 
only atter." He indicated there 
would be no major policy

"sided with them." 
Mr. Skeane's, was dismissed 
from all his party posts as alter-
nate member of the Presidium, 
ember of the Central iruttee and one of the Partal 
retaries. He held no Govern.; 
ment post since he resigned as; 
Foreign Minister last March. 
Another mystery was what, 
had happened to Maxim Z. Sabu-
rov, one the Soviet Unimes top 
economic planner. He was 
dropped from the party Presidi-
um without explanation and had 
not even been made a candidate 
as had his colleague in economic 
planning, Mikhail G. Perviiklart. 
Mr. Mikoyan said tonight that 
?Sr. Saburov still was a member 
of the Central Committee. He 
said, too, that Mr. Permikhin 
had been demoted because of his 
"youth and inexperience."

the party, it was announced aft 
daily that they would leave to 
a state visit to Czechosloyaki 
July 8. Their visit had bee 
postponed, presumably because 
of the developments of the last 
two weeks. 
Much of sPeeulation m Moe-
cow tonight centered on what 
changes, if any, could be expect-
ed from the Kremlin as a result 
of the changes n leadership. In-
terest was focused on foreign,  
policy. The dismissed leaders 
had been accused of opposing 
the Soviet policy of promoting 
better relations with all coun-
t:1;i% 
Mikoyan gave no hint at 
the party that there would be 
any alteration in the Kremlin's 
general line in domestic or for-
eign affairs. 
Mr. Mikoyan wa sengaged in 
earliest conversatton with Yugo-
slav Ambassador Veliko Mieuno-
vie. One of the things Mr. Mo-
lotov was specifically criticized 
for was opposition to the resto-
ration of friendly relations with 
Yugoslavia. 
Mass Meetings Held 
The Soviet leadership did not 
rely on the bare announcement 
of the removal of Messrs 'Molo-
tov, Malenkov and Kaganovich 
to convince. the Soviet public 
that the action was both neces-
sary and desirable. Newspapers 
today were filled With. reports] 
of mass meetings that had been 
'held in most major cities in ad-
vance of the official announce-
ment. 
The most important of those 
meetings was held in Moscow 
Tuesday evening. The audience 
heard speeches by Mr. Khmer 
shchev, Premier Regatta% and 
Miss Yekaterina A. Furtseva, 
newly appointed to regular mem-
bership in the party Presidium 
and the only woman ever to 
reach that position. 
At the meeting party officials, 
engineers and workers spoke in 
support of the party's action 
against the three men who had 
been dismissed. Messrs. Molotov, 
_Malenkov and Kaganovich were 
accused of "conspiratorial meth. 
ods" in trying to set up an "anti-
party faction." 
? Special fire was directed 
against Mr. Molotov, who has 
been in the highest Soviet circle 
longer than any living man. One 
speaker at the Moscow meeting 
said that as Minister of State 
Control Mr. Molotov, instead of 
promoting party decisions, had 
"written letters against those 
decisions."

alalenkov and the other ousted 
Soviet leaders optioned this con-
cession as asserted in the official 
Communist party communique. 
Doubt on this point arises for 
at least two reasons: 
First, Government requisitions 
from the private gardens were 
sharply reduced earlier in the 
post-Stalin period, while the now 
ousted leaders were still very 
powerful, Under Stalin, the exac-
tions from these gardens were so 
heavy that Many peasants found 
It Wiser to slaughter their cows 
rather than keep them and have 
to deliver what the Government 
required. 
Second, .the communique as-
serted that. the ousted leaders 
opposed raising material Moen 
trees for fanners, that is to say 
they opposed raising prices the 
Government pays the collective 
lams for their produce. But, the 
first major increase in such 
prices was announced in Septem-
ber 1953 while Ma Malenkov was 
Premier of the Soviet Union. 
Other Discrepancies 
There were also ether discrep-
ancies in the official communi-
que explaining the ouster of the 
leaders. 
The most striking seemed to 
be the linking of Dmitri T. 
Shepilov as a fellow conspirator 
with Mr. Malenkov. This raised 
doubts because in January, 195. 
Mr. Shepiloy gave the public sig-
nal for tb.e policy change that 
preceded Mr. Ma.lenkov's 
nation RS Soviet Premier, 
Mr. FhepileV then was the 
author of a major article in 
Pravda that laid down the thesis 
that the "general line of the 
party" was the absolute primacy 
of heavy industry over eon:sumer 
good; industry. Premier Maine 
Roe bad been identified since the 
summer of 1953 with a policy of 
muck higher pnority for con-
sumer goods production.. 
Linking of Mr. Shripilov with 
former soviet Foreign 'Minister 
Vyacheslay M. Molotov in the al-
leged conspiracy also seemed to 
raise douhts. 
Mr. Moletnir was knot to 
have opposed the Soviet reeen-

Radar welcomed today the. 
changes in the Soviet leadership. 
They predicted that the con-
solidation of Nikita S. Khrush-
chev's authority in the Kremlin 
would strengthen Mr. Kadar's 
:hand with the Hungarian Com-
munist party. 
In a front-page editorial titled 
"On the Road of the Twentieth 
Congress," the Hungarian party 
organ Nepszabadsag said this 
morning: 
"The revolution of the Cen-
tral Committee of the Soviet 
Communist party also helps our 
party to overcome existing and 
- reviving mistakes and sectarian 
methods and feelings. It is pos-
sible that at the same time cer-
tain revisionists or revisionism. 
minded persons will try to use 
the present resolution * ? * to 
justify and strengthen their 
? ? * ambitions and inclinations. 
Of course one must stand up 
with proper firmness against 
slut phenomena,. aimed at ideo-
logical troublemaking," 
At a conference of his own 
Party last week-end Mr. Kadar 
had no apparent difficulty in 
overcoming a challenge from the 
old Stalinist wing led by Jozsef 
Revel, former Minister of Cul-
ture and arch-enemy of the in-
tellectuals who sparked the 
October uprising. Mr. Revel got 
a. seat on the new Hungarian 
Central Committee, however, 
along with Imre Doget, Minister 
of Agriculture, also regarded as  
a Stalinist, 
'Sectarian Methods' Scored 
The Stalinist group obviously 
as the target of Nepszahad-
sag's attack on "dogmatic mis-
takes and sectarian methods." 
The so-can et revisionists, many 
or whom ?fused to rejoin the 
Kadar grit after the crushing 
of the rm. 'ion, are the follow-
ers of Imre Tau, the National 
Communist evener Premier now 
in exile to Lutaania. 
Mr. Kadar evidently had had 
advance knowledge of the So-
viet shake-up. The action in 
IMoscow took place during a Cen-
tral Committee meeting from 
June 22 to 29, which also was 
the last day of the Hungarian 
party conference in Budapest.

had at least given lip service to. 
peace, disarmament and more 
freedom in the Communist etri-' 
Pitt. 
The general feeling was that, 
as a result of his victory over 
the more rigid Stalinists, Nikita 
S. Khrushchev, First Secretary 
of the Soviet Communist party, 
would have more freedom of 
action in the field of foreign 
affairs, 
This speculation produces 
mixed feelings In. Washington. 
It is reassuring in that officials 
here feel that Mr. Khnish.chev 
wants peace so that he can con-
solidate the vast gains of the' 
Stalin era, but it is perplexing 
in that Mr. Ehrushettev, even 
under the restraints of the Stal-
inists, has demonstrated ton-
sideratde diplomatic skill in 
administering his coexistence 
policy in the last year. 
New Rhrushehee Moves Effected 
Though the normal procedure 
after so sharp a break is for 
the Soviet leaders to swing back 
temporeerily to a middle peal-
lion, officials here expect Mr, 
Ehruslichey to take on more 
trips abroad, to make new ef-
forts to propagandize the West 
and to try in various ways to 
seize the initiative In the world-
wide debate over disarmament 
and ending the nuclear weap-
ons tests. 
Washington itself is not ex-
pected to take any new initia-
tives until events indicate more 
clearly the meaning of what has 
happened. There are some offi-
cials here who feel that the 
troubles in both Moscow and 
.Peiping are divided on the tough 
.Washington policy, and there-
fore that it should, be main-
tained, while others look on it as 
an invitation to a more hopeful 
period of negotiation with the 
strengthened fehrtzshehey. 
In this situation, the likelihood 
is that. the Administration will 
Wat and see. It is still citylded 
even on the cenditional offer tol

that to do anything about a 
general political settlement in 
Europe until after the West Cern 
men election Sept. 11, and the 
long humid summer days are 
coming on?never a time for 
great, activity along the Potomac.' 
Nevertheless, some officials 
here feel that Mr. Khrushchey 
may force the pace of negotia-
tion, and President Eisenhower 
inadvertently gave him an op-
portunity to do so here this 
week. 
The Pteiddent said at his news 
confenenee yesterday morning 
that he would be glad to Invite 
other nations to attend the next 
United States atomic tests to 
check on he progress made by 
the Government in reducing the 
radiation-content of this coun-

He also indicated that he 
might be wilting to let the Rus-
sians in on the secret of how 
these comparatively radiation-
free bombs could be decontimi-
nated. Both these references 
caused some surprise even with-
in the Administration. 
What if Mr. Ehrushchey should 
say that he would like to come 
here and see a demonstration 
of these new deanear atomic 
bombs?, some officials asked. 
Would the President then not be 
confronted with having to ac-

Man of Many Talents 
Nikita S. Khrushchev  
lslhendoit had been an alternate 
member of the Presidium. 
In addition, Mr. Khrushchev 
demoted leading members of the 
so-ralled "technicians" group. 
Maxim Z. Sebum:, a state 
planning official. was dropped 
from the Presidium, and Mik-
hail G. Pervuklen, another lead-
ing technician, was reduced in 
rank from a fell member to an 
alternate member. 
There were two notable facts 
about the new and enlarged 
party Presidium, One was the 
complete predominance of Khru-
shelters supporters almost all of 
them petty bureauerate. The 
other was the elevation of Mar-
Heti Georgi K. Zhlikces to full 
;Jtisnberhip. 
While nothing was said in the 
communique about the role! of , Itornth,coming? 
Ute Army, it seemed beyend ; eAll% the area in which change 
question that Mr. Ithruelichev 
seemect to be most strongly die-
could not have embeikeil 
:teted was in the continuing Sta-
on so 
sweeping a cone.olldation of imist leadefailiP within tionne of 
power without tlet 100 per eent 
assurance of military backing. 
It was probably not without 
significance that the Only public 
appearances made by Mr. Khru-
sheavv and by Premier Nikolai 
A. Bulganin In the period when 
the Central Committee was 
retrying on its deliberations be-
tween Jane 22 and 29 were in 
the !company of Marshal Zhukov. 
It may be of eddltIonal signi-
ficance that these appearances 
were all in connect on with the 
visit to the Soviet Union of the 
Yugoslav Minister of Defense,

However, it was expected that 
at the onset, at least, of the 
inew IChrushchey regime caution 
would probably be the watch-
word. The powerful individuals 
displaced by Mr. Khrushchev are 
not without friends throughout 
the structure of the Soviet and 
party apparatus.

that the list of changes in the

BtW ERA m JUL4 1957 MOSCOW? 
Government leaders all over the 
world have put in many hours these 
last two days, and will undoubtedly 
put in many more, attempting to 
divine the meaning of Wednesday's 
sensational changes In Moscow. The 
central question in these donee:a-
tions is obviously this: Do the ?, 
changes in Moscow mean the open.' 
fog a a new era in which the cold 
war will be liquidated and the men-
ace of nuclear war removed from 
humanity? A more Important . 
tion could hardly be imagined. 
Prime Minister Nehru Indicated 
yesterday that he is hopeful that 
the answer to this key question is 
positive. Apparently he believes that 
the removal of Molotov & Co. has 
opened the road to roe/ progress 
toward a more normal world. Cory 
tain/y the official communique is-
sued by the Soviet Communist party 
is clearly intended to encourage this 
view. It can hardly be considered 
less than astounding that this offi-
cial Soviet statement in effect ac-
cuses Molotov, Ea ganovich, and 
Malenkov of being warmongers, men 
opposed to easing intetnaticnal ten-
sion and opposed also to steps 
'ressential for the achievement of 
mutua/ understanding and laettr 
International relations." What a 
Shock this must be for ComnaimIsts 
who have been taught to parrot 
that only "Western imperialists9 are 
against reducing international ten-
sion! 
Unfortunately, however, to bade 
judgments cif this sort only upon 
the power or lack of power of par-
ticular personalities is really to fall 
victim to the "cult of personality." ; 
Such men as Khrushchev, Bulganin, 
Voroshilov and Mikoyan were a's , 
much Stalinists while Stalin lived 
as the men who have been ousted. 
They too supported such measures 
as the political attack on Yugo-
slavia in 194S, the military attack 
on South Korea in 1950 and the 
treacherous onslaught on the Hum. 
garian people rasa November. And 
it was Mr. Khrushehey, we should 
remember, v:ho threatened the use 
of armed force against Poland that 
fateful Friday In Warsaw last Oc-
tober. On the record the men who 
rule in Moscow now are as poten-
tially capable of treacherous attack 
?in terms of their individual hiss' 
tories?as the num now purged, 
The answer to our question must 
take into account the political and 
economic and military realities with 
which the rulers in Moscow, who-
ever they are, must grapple. It was 
klaienkov who spoke out three years

true for Khrushchev as well.   
discontent of the Soviet people is 
a hard fact with which Mos vi 
must grapple, discontent over 
remaining features of the po e 
state and discontent over the st te 
exploitation the people live un r. 
It is of the highest significance tat 
the first concrete measure 
flounced after this purge is the 
of Government exactions from

CPYRGHT 
o one outsme of Mos ow is likely to discern 
the full meaning of the latest explosion that has 
blasted three alleged Stalinist leaders and former 
Foreign Minister Shepilov out of the Communist 
Party's ruling presidium. Yet the moat casual 
observer must see in these events a signiflcant 
iaking DI the monolithic system that has prevailed 
n the Soviet Union. 
The explanation offered by the Kremlin itself 
rough the columns of Pravda is that the party 
has cracked down on malcontents who were trying 
to return to Stalinism in disregard of the edicts 
of the 20th Party Congress. That seems to be 
consistent with the Stalinist records of former 
Foreign Minister Molotov and First Deputy Ike-
ier Kaganovich, Who was Stalin's brother-in-law. 
ut former Premier Malenkov, who was also 
mated, is believed to have opposed the old Bel-
iheriki in recent years. In any event, the Provele 
?xpianation appears to be only part of the story. 
The break would not have come in this dramatic 
ashion if the Kremlin had not been rent by feuds 
ind basic disagreements. 
No doubt the scramble for power played a large 
tart in the dismissals. Nikita Khrushehev has 
eized an opportunity to dispose of potential rivals 
s Stalin did before him, although, presumably, 
a less ruthless fashion. Yet this action is taken 
the name of progressive communism. The con-
tolling faction 16 still trying 10 move, it appears, 
way from the terrors of Stalinism. 'Probably the 
most significant fad is that as soon as it grants 
additional leeway in the pursuit of conflicting 
fleas, it is faced with the dilemma of tolerating 
r idening areas of dissent or resorting once more 
Li repression. 
In some respects, therefore, the latest purge in 
Yescow may be the internal expression of the 
plicy that led to the crushing of Hungary. Pre-
s !madly the now ousted officials, like the Nagy 
pvernment in Hungary, went further in their 
ii dependent thinking than Khrushchev and his 
a iseelates in the central scats of power would 
!crate. 
The great unanswered question is whether the 
S wiet Union can, by these uncertain swings to-
wlsrd looser controls and then back to harsh 
r pression, move toward a more tolerable political 
s. stem. Secretary Dulles believes that such an 
e elution k possible and that American policy 
sl ould be directed toward encouraging it. Cer-
tardy that is much lo be desired. But we must 
n vet lose sight of the danger that a sudden blow-
UI within the Kremlin may lead to chaos within 
issia as well as in her relations. to other 
countries.

it grew and became stronger 
in the struggle against. numer-

been conditioned by the very

philosophy of life, by its aims

and to struggle relentlessly 
against those who under vari-

Thanks to this the party has

Foreign Visits Welcomed 
As One men, the Soviet peo-
ple warmly tvelcome the eci-
stilts of the visits of Our party 
and Government delegations to 
other countries, as well as the 
results of teaks with the dele-

bordering on our -country. In 
this connection, the strength-

the Communist party of China 
and the Communist and work-

ritheraeies has been welcomed 
with particular satisfaction. 
The growing! unity of the 
party ranks is undeniable 
proof that the political and or-
ganizational leadership of the 
Central Committee of the 
party is satisfactory, that the 
party is correctly solving 
problems of party and state

sitillfellyr leading the country 
along Lenin's path. This does 
not, however, mean that one

report of the party's Central 
Committee to the twentieth 
party congress, the ideological 
and political and. organiza-

stitute a guarantee of its in-
vincibility. No enemies and no 
difficulties are to be feared by 
the party if it is united. Any 
task can be shouldered by it 
if it comes ,out as a united 
force knowing no fear in 
struggle, no vacillation in the 
implententation of its policy. 
arid no retreat in the face of , 
difficulties. 
The party statutes,agnike it 
incumbent upen.every member 
of the party to safeguard in

The most important condi-
tion for the preservation and 
strengthening of unity is the 
?observance ? of Lenin's prima 
iple of democratic centralism 
in the party. This principle 
provides for adherence to

Central ConimIltee and at the 
rongress for their expulsion 
from the party? 
In unity of action, Lenin 
conceived the party's greatest 
weapon in its struggle for So-
cialist revolution. Striving to-
ward party unity, Lenin de-
cisively brake with all who did 
not submit to measures of dis-
cipline and who went against 
the majority of the party and 
against the Central Commit-
tee. Lenin attached cartieular 
importance to the partils ex-
ecutive nucleus, its Central 
Committee. He took pride in 
saying that our Central Com-
mittee has developed into a 
strictly centralized and high-
ly authoritative group." He 
guarded it In every way from' 
influences of purely , personal 
nad fortuitous contingencies 
and ably averted the passibil-
ity o any break in unity. 
The80 Leninist traditions are 
au immutable law, binding on 
our party and an all Commu-
nists. For the Marxist-Lenin-
hit party, the unity of its 
tanks assumed iamont impor-
tance after the victory of the 
Socialist 'evolution and during 
the period of building social-
ism and of gradual transition 
toward communism, M Is 
known, during the first years 
of Soviet rule our party was 
forced to wage an intensive 
struggle against all kinds of 
petty bourgeois trends, group-
ings and fractions that sought 
to undermine the party's unity. 
in March, 1921, the tenth 
party Congress, in distussing 
the question of party unity, 
unanimously adopted a resolu-
tion drafted by Lenin that 
Stressed the need for insuring 
complete cbtetidence among 
Communists and for concerted 
work embodying the united 
will of the vanguard of the 
proletariat. 
In order to insure strict dim 
cipline within the party and in 
all StiViet work, the resolution 
stated, to attain the utmost 
unity, and to eliminate all re-
fractorinesa the congress au-
thorizes the Ccietral Commit-
tee to employ, in the event of 
infringement of discipline or 
revival or tolerance of refrac-
toriness, any measures of party 
punishntent, even expulsion 
from the party., and with re-
gard to Central Committee 
members. reduction to the 
status of alternate members 
and, in extreme cases, expul-
sion from the party. 
The condition of the appli-
cation of such extreme meas-
ures against members of the 
Central Committee, alternate 
members and members of 
omitting commissions must be 
the convocation of a plenary 
session of the Central Com-
mittee, with ? all alternate 
members and members of 
auditing commissions in at-
tendance. If such a general 
meeting of the mord responsi-
ble leaders of the party de-
dries by a two-thirds major-
ity vote to reduce a Central 
Committee member to the 
status of alternate member or 
expel him from the party, 
imch a measure must be put 
into effect immediately. 
The congress dissolved all 
groups which had formed un-
der one platform or ;mother 
and charged all organizations 
with the task of exercising 
vigilance against Any manifes-

Being completely loyal to

rect were the measures put 
into effect by the party In the

sequences a the personality 
cult. 
A worthy example of ad-
herence to Leninist principles, 
firmness and determination in 
the struggle for party unity is 
displayed by the Central Com-
mittee. There are no people 
in the party, nor can there be 
any, who by virtue of their 
high posts, could be shielded 
from criticism of their mis-
takes and shortcomings. This 
would be contrary to the spirit 
of the Marxist-Leninist party. 
The Central Committee, 
boldly and ireespective of per-
sonality, subjects to discussion 
and criticism any leading fig-
ures of the party and state, if 
they allow mistakes to occur 
In their work, and takes de-
cisive measures against any 
persons if their actions and 
deeds contravene the party line. 
The party only gains from 
this: ? 
In our Socialist country 
there is no soda! foundation, 
nor can there be any for the 
emergence within the party of 
factions and trends hostile to 
Leninism. The unity of the

a, ? 
and the Soviet Army are ex-
pected by close observers of 
Soviet affairs to share power 
with Nikita S. Khrushchev in 
the newly-constituted Moscow 
regime. 
, A conviction that Marshal 
Zhukov, newly deviated; to the 
Presidium of the Soviet Commu-
nist party's Central, Committee, 
is the No. 2 man in the new

part in the defeat of the group

The second most important 
Soviet civilian?after Mr. Khru-
navy hiraself?an the maneuver-
ing that preceded the coup 
appears to have been Anaatas I. 
Mikoyan, the Soviet foreign 
trade specialist. Mr. Mikoyan

bitter infighting among the So-

tated Mr. Khrushthey's move 
against his oppbnente. 
have sought to give the impres-
sion that it was a mere "faction" 
of the Soviet Communist Party 
that Mr. Khrushchev ousted. 
However, closer Inspection of 
the changes shows that there 
was the narrowest kind of a Blatt 
within the ruling Presidium of 
the Central Committee. 
WM approval of the plan to ilan e 
Mn Pervukhtn as the new Me 
nomic czar. 
Theoretically, the Mx-mo 
antlelehrushehee majority on t e 
Presidium could have removed 
him at that time. With both U e 
Chinese leaders and Marsh 
Mary opposed to such a ram s, 
however, the Molotov coaliticn 
presumably was afraid to tal e 
such a radical step. 
This seems to have been a 
fatal error for Mr. Khrushches s 
opponests. The energetic par y 
chief set about rallying support. 
Communist China's Presal r 
and Foreign Minister, Chou E

and the satellite regimes. It s 
probable that he assisted W. 
Khruslichee and, perhaps, Mae-
shal Zhukov in rallying over t 
least one of the antblehrushehry 
votes within the Presidium. 
By late February, at a ne v 
plenary session of the Centr I 
Committee, Mr. Khrushchev wags 
able to overturn the results I f 
the fateful December meetin 
To do this he had to command 
at least six of the eleven Pr -

Mr. Makeyan or Mr. Suslov. 
It is also possible that by lan 
February Mr. Khrushchev hal 
succeeded in separating M 
Pervulthin from his erstwhiM 
allies. This is suggested by the 
fact that Mr. Pervukhin Is the 
only one of the five known ant ? 
Khrushchev men who was no.

He was forced to agree to a slipped from full membership Ls

Union. 
Maeshal Teinkov, who !at 
December was only an alternate 
member of the Presidium and as 
such had no voting rights In the 
party's ruling body, probably 
also rallied to Mr. Khrushchev. 
Deeptte these powerful allies, 
Mr. Mintsbehey, as is now evi-

Soviet hierarchy has for 
the first time put a profes-

Mershal Georgi Konstantino-

must have been specially 
sweet because it 
fri" eficanciled with the

closest eollaborm

dictator who so 
long had deprived him of the 
glory he had wort in World 
War It. 
"Eisenhower of Russia" is 
the way some writers have de-
scribed the marshal's role In 
the wan Certainly from the 
sueeessful defense of Moscow 
In early 1041 to the capture of 
Berlin in 1945 It was Marshal 
Zhukov who commanded gi-
gantic Soviet. armies at key 
battles. "Spasiter," or SeVier, 
was what be was called by 
many a SeViCt man in the 
street. 
The reaction of Stalin, 
always envious and fearful of 
rivals, was to banish the mar-
shal after the war to pro-
vinc.ial pests, first in Odessa 
and then in the Urals, A 
legend was built up deliberate-
ly that It was Stalin who bed 
planned the , victory over 
Hitler in every detail. 
A special film "The Fall of 
' 
Berlin, Was made and widely 
&Lewis to "prove" Statin 
military genius and to portray 
Marshal Zhukov as a coward 
and a military fumbler. In per-
sonal conversation with his 
intimates, Stalin accused the 
marshal of being a super-
stitious oaf who smelled 
handsfid of dirt to divine 
whether he should begin an 
attack. 
But Stalin's eampaign failed, 
and within twenty-four hours 
after the dictator's death was 
announced in March, 1953, the 
marshal was back in a high 
Moscow post, beginning the 
climb to the highest level, of 
Soviet power, 
A Wrestler's Shoulders 
Marshal Zhukov is a squat 
5 feet I inch in height, and 
has broad shoulders of a 
wrestler, His broad face be-
trays that he Is a descendant 
of a long line of Russian 
peasants. His erect posture, 
his intelligent and mobile face 
and his piercing blue eyes 
make even a casual. acquaint-
ance soon aware that he is a 
man to be reckoned with, 
while his vigor of movement 
and his obviously well pre-
served body make lam seem 
younger than one born more 
than sixty years ago, in 1896. 
The marshal's slightly bowed 
legs testify to his ?Heiner 
cavalry background. He is still 
a good rider. A good shot with 
pistol or rifle, he was also a 
supple daya Be La a studencof

vorite military Imre is re-
ported to be Hannibal. 
Marshal Zinesov's military 
career began two years before 
the Bolshevik Revolution 
when, at the age of 19, he was 
drafted into the Czar's Nov-
gorod Dragoons. Be joined the 
Red Army in 1.918 and the 
Communlet. party in 1919,. In 
the next twenty years he rose 
In the officer corps, attended 
.military schools in. the Soviet

Union and Germany, and ob-
served tank warfare in' Spain 
during the Spanish civil war. 
A Victory in Mongolia 
The quality. of Ms Profee-
Monet prowesa was made dear 
when he commanded a tank 
array that defeated the Japan-
ese in Mongolia in 1999 at a 
little-known but. important 
battle on the Khalka River. 
His opportunity to have this 
command, as well as to rise 
so rapidly in the next few 
years, came in large part be-
cause most of the Soviet 
Anny's. high command had 
been destroyed during Stalin's 
great purges of 1936-38, 
President Else,nhower evalu-
ated Marshal Zhulsov's role in 
World War II in these words, 
"To no one man do the United 
Nations (the Allies of that 
war) owe a greater debt than 
to Marshal Zhukov." The lat-
ter, in turn, credited President 
Eisenhower with "the most 
magnificent performance of 
any general of the current 
time." 
The personal friendship be-
tween these. two generals re-
sulted in a brief exchange of 
letters earlier in the post-
Stalin period, but; to date there 
has been no sign that this : 
friendship has had major po-
litical importance. While visit-
ing India this year Marshal 
Mallow indicated that the 
friendship bed cooled some-
what, at least Ince the Hun-
garian revolt. 
Little is known of Mme. 
Zhukov. But the marshal has 
often expressed great pride in 
his two daughters and in Ms 
6 - year - old granddaughter, 
whom he MPS to take rowing 
on a lake near his country

The younger daughter, Ella,

husband is a nephew of Mar-

1Throughout these last eight-

icism among the long-time col-
leagues of Stalin fir this looser 
control of the political life of 
the world Coaantinist movement 
and decentralized plan for the 
economy at home. And while 
Mr. Khruslachev had encouraged 
criticism, it finally, reached a 
point where lie felt he had to 
remove his critic,. 
Some of the Soviet experts 
here thought: Mr. bilituscher's 
China and disarmament policies 
hag something to do with the 
dismissals : others were inclined 
fri miaimize these as causes or 
dismiss them altogether, 
According to some of these n-
perts, Mr. M.alenliov was unen-
thusiastic, not only about Me 
Khrushchev's emphasis on heavy 
industry, but about his policy of 
Rid to Communist Chinn, Ma. 
Malenkovhs theme was that the 
time had come 'to concentrate 
more on the production of con-
sumer goods, even if that meant 
being unable to help Red China. 
The men here who are 
paid to solve the Soviet riddle 
agree that his dismissal was not 
caused by any desire on his part-
to return to the hard centraliza-
tion policies of the Stalin regime. 
The argument over tile Soviet 
disarmament policy was this: 
some of the expert.s scented to 
think that this would inevitably 
Lad to a lessening of tensions. 
In the World and thus to greater 
influence of the West among the 
Soviet satellites, 
According to this thesis, the 
"old Bolsheviks" were fright-
ened by the evidence that a re-
laxation of centralized control 
nod of tensions inevitably leads 
lo opposition to Moscow both at

KREMLIN CHANGES 
FORESEEN BY TITO 
He Indicated Anti Stalinists 
Would Win Power Struggle 
That Dates Back to '53 
By DA SCHWARTZ 
President Tito of Yugoslavia 
last November gave the world 
itit first authoritatitve news of 
the internal. Kremlin struggle 
that resulted in yesterday's 
major Soviet shake up. The 
shake-up also appeared to vindi-
cate the confidence Marshal Tito 
expressed then that the anti-
Stalinist forces would win the 
contest. 
Soviet organs last fall unani-
mously denied that there was 
any split between Stalinists and 
anti- Stalinists in the Soviet 
leadership as the Yugosia.v 
leader described. 
But yesterday's charges that 
it. atroup of the highest Soviet. 
leaders had sought to sabotage 
the decisions of the twentieth 
Communist Party Congress of 
February, 1958, appeared fully 
to vindicate the accusations 
made by President Tito in a 
widely publicized speech at Pula 
Nov. 11. 
The struggle that reached its 
climax yesterday in Moscow, did 
not begin at the twentieth con; 
gross, however, nor was it aim.-
ply between Stalinists and anti-
Stalinists. The congress was the 
Thruni before which Nitrite S. 
Khrushehev delivered his orig-
inally secret speech exposing 
tome M Stalin's crimes. The 
party meeting also adopted cer-
tain policy assumptions that re-
versed earlier policy bases ac-
cepted during Stalin's reign, 
Struggles on Two Plane. 
The three top figures ousted 
Prom the Soviet leadership yes-
terday ell had previously suf-
fered significant demotion In re-
cent years. Georgi M. Malenkov 
"resigned" as Premier of the So-
viet Union in Febeuary 1055. 
Vyacheslay Ma Molotov was re-
leased from hie post as Foreign 
Minister a year ago, while some 
months afterward Lazar M. 
Kaganoyich was released from 
his post as head of the Soviett 
internment committee in charge' 
of setting wage policy for the 
ountry. 
Struggles. among Soviet lead-
ers since Stalin's death in 
March, 1953, have developed on 
two planes. One has been the 
conflict among individuals and 
cliques for personal power and 
position. The other has been the 
struggle among Statinat succes-
sor* on the issues posed by the 
problem of reshaping the Soviet 
sr stem from the frozen mold of 
Stalin's teat, yenrs to new forms 
corresponding more nearly with 
the real requirements of a So-
viet Union educationally and 
economically far advanced from 
'ts relatively primitive state 
when Stalin assumed power in 
the Nineteen Twenties. 
A tense competition for indi-
vidual power dominated the 
first three months after Stalin's 
death. A day after the an-
nouncement that Stalin was 
dead Georgi M. Malenkov, long of the same group's meeting of 
the dictator's protege, appeared ettelltlItly a return to Stalinist December. laparticular, Mr,

SOVIET EXPECTED 
TO EASE BLOC TIE 
Shift in Leadership Viewed 
as Move to Consolidate 
the Communist Orbit 
By SYDNEY HUTSON 
Spettal to Tn. Ni Mk rim'., 
PRAGUra, Ezechoslovakia, July 
--The changes in the Soviet 
Communist party's leadership, 
announced in Moscow tonight, 
may have ushered in a signifi-
cant period of readjustment in 
? relations between the Soviet 
Union and other Communist 
countries. 
The changes, and the Pravda: 
editorial accompanying them 
were considered of such basic 
Importance that people here and 
in Warsaw hesitated to comment 
until a more thorough Study! be-
came possible. But aitiong their 
hest impressions were these: 
? ithiikita S. Kik:thistle:hey had 
consolidated his 'position as the 
first among equals in the new 
Presidium ofithe Soviet party. 
Cdr. Ichrustichey was bent 
Oil it deeirmined effort to nay-
row the steadily widening gip, 
between the Soviet party andl 
sorrel' of the other Communist 
patties, particularly that of 
communist China. 
To Leseen Antagonism 
The dismissal of Vyacheslav 
M. Molotov would be bound to 
.lassen the sharp antagonism be-
kween Moscow and Belgrade, 
Yugoslavia, and the differences 
between Moscow and Warsaw as 
well. In both Belgrade and War-
saw Mr. Molotov had been con 
sidered the prime architect of a, 
tough policy toward parties1 
straying front the Soviet line. i 
The section of the Pravda edi-? 
tonal concerning the failure of 
"sectarian, and dogmatists" 
tStaltnistal to understand the 
necessity of consolidating the 
Socialist camp was read here as 
aimed against Mr. Molotov. 
? Through the Pravda editorial 
the Soviet Union was assuming 
a. posture that had already been 
taken up elsewhere in the COM-
thentst camp. Editorial strictures 
against Stalinists on the one' 
hand and revisionists ? on. the 
other echoed the 'Struggle on 
two fronts" adopted 25 the Po-
hair party's major ideological 
lisle menthe ago. 
One paragraph in Pravda par-
ticularly sounded like dozens of! 
recent editorials of Trybunat 
Ludo, the newspaper of the Poi-, 
ish party's Central Committee. 
Pravda described 'sectarians' 
and dogmatists" as people "di-
vorced front life" who bevel 
"backward conceptions." 
"They do not see new atua-
bons," !Pravda declared. "They 
stubbornly cling to obsolete 
arms and methods of work and 
eject that which is born by 
fe. They would like to turn the

his position by eliminating thi 
three most prominent member: 
of Stalin's old guard from tlu

To this view of today's event: 
In Moscow, qualified Britist 
sources added the comment thal 
Mr. Khnishchev, the most vont 
tile opponent of the "cult of per. 
sonality" established by Stalin 
heel now enhanced his own per, 
board position. 
The effect of the action 'Tor 
Soviet policy may in time be 
reflected in a superficially mon 
liberal attitude toward both the 
Western democracies and the 
Soviet satellites, these sources 
said, 
The Central Committee's state-
ment belabored Vyacheslav M. 
Molotov, former Foreign Minis-
ter for his narrow-minded oppo-
sition to Mr. Khrushchey's policy 
of coexistence and relaxation of 
international tension. But the 
British sources warned that the 
Soviet rulers "interpretation of 
these slogans probably would re-
main far different from that of 
the West. 
Appeal to West Seen 
It, was auggested that Mr. 
Ithrushebev, having rid himself 
of the most powerful holdovers 
Ira the Stalinist regime, would 
now appeal to the West as a rep-
resentative of a united party and 
government bent on the peaceful 
settlement. of outstanding differ-
ences, both in the field of potit-
teal issues and in disarmament. 
Although this "reformist" 
front may be false, those who 
etudy Soviet policy here in? 
cheated that it could present real 
problems to the leYestern powers. 
There already exists In West_ 
ern Europe, British sources said, 
a strong tendency to believe. 
that the Soviet Union means no 
harm, that: rearmament. with ail 
s financial burdens under 
NATO can be abandoned and 
that: equitable settlement, of 
issues, such as German reunifi-
cation, can be negotiated with 
the Seviet Union, 
Diplomats Expect Bid 
Among professional diplomatol 
there was an expectation that; 
Mr. Khrushchev would ask for. 
Another heads - of - government : 
- ? meeting, preferably with Presi- I 
dent Eisenhower alone, but, ir 
this proved impossible, with the 
President, Prime Minister Mace 
mann of Britain and Premier 
Maurice Bourges-Manoury of 
France. ' 
One aped of Mr. Khru-
shchev's action that, surprised 
the British sources, was that 
Lazar M. Kaganovidt and ,Mr. 
Molotov, long considered to he 
supnorters of the Stalinist 
matey in both foreign affairs and 
internal policy, apparently had 
rinds, common cause with former 
Premier Georgi M. Malenkov and 
Dmitri T. Shepilov, who have 
been thought peek's radillerS. 
tateppwiee ineferteNASEn 
erther by their general opposi-
tion to Mr. Khrushehey's 
Wi1i1d. The breaking point 
may have been the plan put for-
ward recently by Mr. Khrush-
they for dispersing control of 
Soviet industry. 
This plan involved disbanding 
of many of the central industrial 
ministries and establishment of 
regional economic councils. 
Soviet newspapers, although 
they recognized its completion, 
have spent more time attacking 
opponents of the plan than 
glorifying its results. 
There have been recent attacks 
against "snivellers and skeptics" 
e Soviet press. Crilieism of 
tho e who have "lost their links

MOE IN MOSCOW ran 
Once again, this morning the head-
lines on the front page of thiii news-
paper tell of a purge in Moscow, a 
purge which km sent toppling men 
Who only a few days ago were 
titans on the Soviet, scene. The 
Meer drama of this news must 
amaze even the most blase observer. 
Molotov has fallen, he who forty 
years ago worked at Lenin's side in 
preparing the 'Bolshevik revolution. 
Kaganovich has fallen, he who first 
spotted lahrushcheies talents rim 
than three decades ago, When Kivu-
shchev was an unknown and barely 
literate minor party functionary. 
Malenkov has fallen, he who in 
March, 1953, appeared to be Stalin's 
' successor as Premier of the Soviet 
Union and head of its Communist 
party. Not since the Nineteen Twen-
tea, when such former giants as 
Trotsky, Bukharin, Kamenev and 
Zinnviev met defeat, has there been 
a 'Parallel to the news Moscow an-
?Loomed yesterday. 
The victor, 'clearly, Is Khrusheliev. 
Yesterday's Moscow newspaper arti-
cles, which gave the first: hint of 
the political lightning stroke to 
come, made it evident that the 
losers had opposed Khnishchev's 
policies, and by implication had op-
posed K.hrushc.hey's power. The 
isitMe impression of Ithrushchey 
power is given by the new composi-
tion of the Communist party Presid-
ium, especially by the known politi-
eat records of those who have been , 
promoted and these who have been 
demoted. Once again, as in the case 
of Stalin, 3 has been proved that 
the First Secretary of the Commu-
nist party is the key figure in the 
Soviet Union, whose control of the 
party machine enables him to de-
feat even his most august opponents. 
It would be wise, at this early 
point, to be cautious In assessing, 
the policy implications of this latest 
'mud in the Soviet struggle for 
power. The official charges against 
Molotov, Kaganovich and Malenkov 
attempt to picture them as vile fig-
ures who sought only a return to 
Stalinism, That they are vile we 
have known for long, but Khru-
shehev & Co. are also vile on the 
same grounds and were also Stalin's 
close collaborators. Meanwhile it 
would be wise not to forget that it 
was Malenkov who in 193 first 
tiled to get higher priority for the 
long-suffering Soviet consumer, and 
it was Malenkov too who, first 
among Soviet leaders, recognized 
publicly that nuclear- war would 
Ming world suicide. These positions 
were last Stalinist. 
V7hat M dear beyond othate, how-
aver, is the Mailing character of 
this purge. .Three of the highest 
ruler* of the Soviet Union have been 
dismissed by a votr, taken M secret 
In the Communist party Central 
Committee, a body composed of in-
dividuals who hold no mandate from 
The peopte of the Soviet Union. Their 
dismissal arises because of policy 
differences involving questIona of 
the fint importance to every Soviet 
man, woman and child, yet no ordi-
Of what was going on until yester-
day's newspapers appeared.. The men 
Who have lost have had no chance 
to defend their positions in public; 
they have had no opportunity (wen 
to argue their case among the seven 
million members of the Communist 
party of the Swint Union, let alone 
among the 200,00000 people of the 
Stalintry. Is this spectacle of secret 
;government, secret struggle and 1 
secret pain anything but pure 
Stalinism 7 
The ? essential Character of the 
Soviet Union has not changed_ It is 
still a totalitarian dictatorship in 
which a minute group of individuals 
successfully arrogate to themselves 
all power over the Soviet people. But 
a totalitarian dictatorship, we now 
see again, Li far from the seamless 
whole it tics to show publicly, Both 
the men who were purged yesterday 
and those who purged them have 
spoken in the past about their. 
"unity." Now we know there, was 
no unity. 
Some of us sometimes become 
discouraged at the public squabbles 
of a democracy and the habit of X 
democracy of speaking with many 
voices simultaneously. But as we : 
read the latest news from Moscow 
we should understand that it is pre-

BONN HOUSE VOTES 
ANTI-CARTEL LAW 
Measure Bans Price-Fixing 
Jr Any Other Steps That 
Curb Free Competition 
By ARTHUR .1, OLSEN 
Special to The New 'Lark Tones 
BONN, Germany, July 4?The 
- lower .hflUSC or al t . n 
roved today anti-cartel legisla-
tion designed to insure genuine 
competition in West German in-
dustry. Approval in the upper 
house of Parliament is expected. 
The legislation provides that 
any agreements. made by busi-
ness concerns Cr associations o 
business enterprises shall be in-
valid if their effect is to limit 
or reduce free competition, 
A Federal cartel agency, 
well as individual agencies in 
each state, will he set up to ad-
minister the law. They will be 
empowered to forbid such agree-
ments and impose fines of up to 
50.000 Deutsche marks (about 
$12900) against violators, 
Withthe permission of admin-
istering authorities, however, 
:business concerns will be allowed 
to combine t.o promote exports, to 
rationalize production in certain 
industries, to establish agreed 
standards on items of proctiction 
anti to enter Into price-fixing 
agreements in time of an eco-
nomic crisis. 
Bundestag approval of the 
legislation by a substantial 
majority amounted to a sweep-
ing victory for Dr. Ludwig Er-
hard, Minister of Economies, 
against a 'virtual solid front of 
German industr iGists. 
Dr. Erhard stubbornly insisted, 
upon and finally obtained -legis-
lation that would gibe the Fed-
eral Government authority to 
invalidate price-fixing and mar 
kit-sharing agreements such FIS 
dominated the German economy 
in the years before World War II. 
The Economics Minister, whose 
free-enterprise, philosophy domi-
nates West German economic 
policy, has predicted that the 
new law will put an end to the 
Mstorie designation of Germany 
'as "the classic cartel land." 
Mrs Specified In Measure 
United States economic ex-
pert:; speak of the West German 
legislation as a desirable model 
for other West European coun-
tries Independent observers em-
phasized, however, that the West 
German legislation would be no

tering authority chose to make it.

More than thirty speakers re-

which Paris does not have. The 
atmosphere in the Assembly

Another reason may be that 
the basic principles of the two 
treaties have already been de-

Hopes for German reunineahon

Stalinist-influenced Soviet policy 
might lead to serious negotia-
tion on the reunification of Ger-

The West German Govern-

a study of reports from Moscow 
and consultation with diplomats 
of the Western Allies. Dr. Hein-

Minister, spent the day confer-

He was somewhat surprised at the

he, M. Speak, had got his staff to turn 
up recent speeches by Soviet military 
leaders, which showed that they were quite 
ready to proclaim Soviet strength in nuclear 
arms and make such references tis " crush-

ashes the territory of any enemy whatso-

On the subject of the Arab

that according to experts he had 
consulted, Iraq is "desperately 
short of people" and could With 
advantage absorb the entire re-
fugee population. The Senator 
said Iraq actually aeeded'3,000,-

I his proposal in a report to the: 
Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee on his tour of the Middle:

'rho existence of this refugee 
problem ten years after the 
Arab-Israeli war is "a challenge 
to the conscience of humanity," 
he said. 
The "Vast majority," he be-
lieved, could find homes M. the 
Arab states but there must also 
be "a commitment by Israel to 
accept a limited number of token 
repatriates? 
Cites Talk Will, Nasser 
The Senator reported that 
President Carnal Abdel Nasser 
of Egypt had indicated in an in- : 
terview that "both the problems 
of passage through the Gulf of 
Aqaba and the Suez Canal for' 
Israel ships and shipping intend-
ea. for Israel could be handled : 
peacefully." 
"In the ease of the Suez Canal , 
he reiterated that the matter 
might be settled in the World 
Court," Ube International Court 
of Justice at The Hague, the 
Netherlands). 'His language was 
moderate and non-belligerent, al-
though he did say that any Arab 
leader that tried to negotiate 
with Israel for a peace settle-

Senator Humphrey recom-

s id, 'Israel has already dis-
osed its willingness to compen-

c ara in the Middle East an op-

Direct Negotiations Pressed 
The tallied States in Senator' 
iimphrey's opinion, should use 
s leadership to being about di-
Net negotiations between Israel

As one way of combatting 
emmunist penetration, he ret-

CAIRO, July 4?Egypt's Do-
tense Minister flew unexpectedly 
to Saudi Arabia today, His mis-
sion reportedly was to try to 
ease the grain an relations be-
tween Saudi Arabia, on the one 
hand, and Egypt and Syria, on 
the other. 
The Egyptian official, Maj. 
Gen. Abdel Haklin Amer, was 
the only passenger in almilitary 
transport plant. His trip was 
seen as another step in the ef-
forts Egypt has been making to 
pull together the Arab alliance 
behind President Gamal Abdel 
Naseer's policies of so-called 
positive neutralism. 
On paper, at least, General 
Amer is still the joint comman-
der of the armed forces of three 
countries. The alliance also origi-
nally included Jordan but was 
seriously split when King Saud 
backed the Jordanian monarch, 
King Hussein, in his fight 
against pro-Nasser elements and 
their Communist supporters. 
The Egyptian and Syrian Am-
bassadors in Jidda., Saudi Ara-
bia's port capital, bare had long 
discussions with King Saud re-
cently in what was believed by 
Arab diplomats to be attempts 
to find means of regaining the 
one-time confidence and friend-
ship of the monarch.

R subtle realignment, with regard

An important factor underlying

France and the United States an 
the one hand, and the "East" as 
tepresented tay Communist Russia 
and her European satellites on the 
either. but clearly mid simply be-

Soviet Union. The direct commitnts of America and the USSR 
in the Middle East have created a 
new atmosphere in which it has be-

impassible for any Arab govern-
ment or political group to avoid 
taking a clear atand in the cold 
war.

During the writer's visit to this 
area three years ago, the situation 
Was funda.mentally different. In-

in determining Arab attitudea iwith 
the possible exception of Iraqi, and 
ment, d ispite bitter Egyptian op-
position Intellectual and profes-
sional !bides backing Egyptian 
President NEISSOCS policies in the 
Arab word seem now to have seri-
ous doubts regarding the genuine-
miss of Egypt's Arab nationalism 
and he intentions in the Arab 
world. 
Then doubts are primarily caused

iThe sending of the 6th Fleet during

countries,i

France and "pre-Zionist" America. 
The change brought about by the 
mutual stand rif RusSia and the. 
United States during the Suez in-
vasion has acted upon the two 
most sensitive problems of Arab 
concern, namely, Israeli expansion-
ism and direct or indirect Anglo-
French imperialism, In Arab eyes 
both Russia and America stood in 
October-Noirembem 1956, for the 
cause of truth and justice in the 
Middle East. But present develop-
ments seem, to show that of the 
two stands the American is by fat 
the more radical in its effect, for 
despite the fact that the Soviet 
Union has scored significant politi-
cal and psychological gains in Syria 
:Ind Egypt., the new Eisenhower 
policy has been a curbing influence 
on anti-Arnerican, anti-Western 
feeling. 
A new air of growmp, confidence 
is evident, especially in Saudi 
Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon. A 
v militant spirit has resulted 
in concrete steps to stem pro-
Communist movements and at the 
same time move into closer co-
operation with the United States?
in act which only a few months 
ago would have created wide-
spread disturbances and caused the 
immediate collapse of governments. 
This change is perhaps best 
demonstrated by the new rap-
prochement between the three 
Arab monarchies of Saudi Arabia.

sisit to Jordan last 7 eek has

THE CRISIS IN COMMUNISM 
A collection of items on the confusion in Communist, 
ideology and the resulting disaffection and deser-
tions from Communism throughout the world. ? Ma-
terial will be reproduced, under this heading from 
time to time as it becomes available. 
The Belgian Road to Socialism. 
by. Alois Geri?. 
? 
I hay,- left [doe Belgian uommunist Party (BCP) after 17 years as a 
member. I had to take this step in order to remain true to Myself and 
La ay former fellow members. 
I still believe in Marxist Socialtmn? just as I did before. 
I no longer believe in the BCP. I. have gradually become convinoed 
that the IICP nen no longer play a single useful role in Belgium, with a 
view to the establishment of J. socialist regime. The Belgian Communist 
Party emerged from the underground in 1944 as a strong party and one 
deservedly renowned, but this party has now definitely lost or rather 
destroyed its opportunity. 
I am now convinced that when the party act/gross meetina in Vilvoorde. 
in December 19514 made an effort to alter the course of the party it was 
already too late. The mistakes had been too serious and the ?line" had 
been too bad. At that time the BCP had already separated itself from 
the Belmian labor movement and was completely isolated. It was already 
too late for the party to renew its contacts with the working class and 
the serious efforts whieh were afterwards made by militant, devoted and 
honcat party members could not Produce any results. 
The BCP has become a small, powerless faction. It stands outside 
of the workers' movement in Beldium. It has lost the confidence of the 
Belgian workers. Anyone who thinks that in spite of everything the 
strucle for socialism and peace is still possible within the ranks of 
the ICP is wasting his time and energy. 
Personally I wish to carry on this struggle within 
Belgian labor movement and as a member in good atanaing 
do not wish to fool people anymore. The clincher about, 
done for, as far as I am concerned. That is the reason 
the ranks of the 
of this class. 
the Ivanguard" is 
for my resianation. 
There is, however, a second dnd equally important reason. I am a 
liberal, that is, a convinced adherent of free investigation. I reject 
cvery dogma, every Talmudism. I wish to think independently and to retain 
OY fre1d.om to criticize. I do not wish to be suspected of having surienderec 
my freedom of thinking. This?susoicion will ultimately weigh down upon 
anyone who remains a atember of the BC?. 
In spite. of the resolutions of the 20th Congreas of the &did, the. 
PCP continues slavishly to parrot the. Pravda; the Soviet leader, and their 
actions still remain sacred and everything they say is apparently gospel 
for the leaders and the press of he BOP. Such an attitude is not only 
anti?liberal; it is neither Marxist nor Leninist; it degrades man and 
impoverishes his mind. I wilTh not participate in this and neither will 
the Belnian workers. It is larmely for ohis reason that they have turned 
Lir backm on the RCP.

in Belgium the road to secialism is through the Belgian Socialist 
Party (B3P), or, to express My opinion more exactly, through the mass of 
the workers organized in the, BST and affiliated organizations. 
In the maturing of this new conviction the resolutions of the 20th 
Congress of the CPSU held:in Moscow in February 1956 played a very great 
role. These resolutions do not contradict what I have written above. 
The 20th Congress passed many good resolutions. Among other things it 
corrected many mistakes. And it emphasized - and proved for those who 
needed such proof - that the CPSU can also make mistakes. 
Among the essential points which have qualified the 20th Congress 
as a genuine congress of renovation, I wish to mention: 1. the demolition 
of the Stalin cu1ta/20 the thesis about the different roads to socialism, 
and in this connection, 3. the changed attitude of the Communists in the 
Soviet Union toward the socialist parties. 
The thesis *but the roads of the various countries toward socialism, 
or - as Marc Pieisto stated in i.e SOir - the thesis of "socialist pluralism," 
expressly pointed out that this socialism can be reached along other roads 
than those pursued by the Soviet Union. 
This thesis is actually not new, but one which had fallen into oblivion 
under Stalin. Marxism has always expressed the opinion that different roads 
to socialism: are possible and even inevitable, because of the internal and 
external cenditione in whit any country may find itself at a given moment. 
Jean'Jaures wrote in 1902: "the social revolution is being accomplished 
among each of the great people of modern times by means of an autonomous 
movement" (in La Petite Republique, 2 January 1902). 
On the eve of the October Revolution Lenin wrote: "All nations will 
attain to socialism, this is inevitable, but this will not take place in 
exactly the same way in every nation. Every nation will make its own 
contribution to one form Or another of democracy, the dictatorship of the 
proletariat, and the tempo in which the socialist transition is brought 
eh:eft in the various domains of social life" (Collected Works, Volume 23, 
page 58, Russian). ' 
The thesis of the socialist pluralism was applied by the Yugoslav 
Communists, hence the breach with Stalin who appexently wanted the soviet 
experiment copied everywhere. 
This thesis is also being applied with visible success by the People's 
Republic of China?'which is pursuing a policy of peaceful reorganization of 
private industry and commerce. 
' Finally, and this is once more "creative Marxism in action," the 
People's Democracy. of Poland is now resoluteey proceeding along this: 
way. The Polish leader Gomulka, *ho was once arrested as a deviatiZniste , 
has made a brilliant come-back. A plebiscite ?lathe Polish peoples 
supported him. 
Nikita Khrushohev stated in his report to the 20th Congress: "It 
is not true that we regard violence and civil war as the only way to 
change society." There is also the parliamentary road, the way of the 
parliamentary majority. In this regard Khrushchev stated.: "Socialism 
has become a great magnetic force for the workers, the farmers, and the 
intellectuals of all countries. The ideas of socialism will dominate 
the minds of all of working humanity. At the same time the present 
situation offers the wOrking class in a number of capitalist countries a 
real opportunity for uniting the overwhelming majority of the people 
under its leadership and for guaranteeing the transfer Of the decisive 
means ofproduction into the hands of the people. TheSrightist bourgeois 
parties and the governments set up by them are increasingly suffering 
fiasco. Under these circumstances the working class has an opportunity 
-(by uniting about itself the working farmers, the intellectuals, and

all patriotic forces, and forcing back the opportunist elements which 
are finable to oareender the policy of compromise with the capitalists 
and landowners)- to inflict defeat upon the reactionary forces which 
oppose the interests of the people, to gain a stable majority in 
par1im7ent, and to change thin parliament from an organ of bourgeois 
democracy into a genuine instrument of the will of the people." 
This assuredly does not mean a conversion to reformism. The problem 
dealt with concerns the form of the transition to socialism. The main 
thing is the content of this transition, and for all Marxist socialists 
this content remains the socialization of the essential means of production 
and the establishment of the government of the working class, a government 
which Marx and also the Ruaregnon statement of principle of the Belgian, 
Sacialist Party called "the dictatorship of the Proletariat," a terminology 
which is now somewhat obsolete. . 
At any rate there is no doubt about the fact that the acceptance 
of the thesis, first, of socialist pluralism, and second], Of the 
parliamentary road to accialiem has brought the CPSU considerably closer 
to the socialist parties. It was accordingly all the more normal for 
the 20th. Congress to emphasize the desirability and even the necessity 
,for improving the relations between Communists, and soeialists and for 
overcoming the dangerous division of the international labor movement. 
Thinking thaings through logically, all of this means that the struggle 
which the BCP io actually waging against the DSP makes no sense whatever. 
In a country such az Belgium, in view of the objective situation and historica: 
(ambition, we mast see to it that the BSP obtains a parliamentary majority 
and that this majority is used toward establishing a really socialist regime. 
Neither of these, however, will be brought about by continuing to support an 
impoverished, totally isolated and discredited little Communist party'. It 
is hitbag to affirm: 10 that the cause of workers" unity is horeby served, 
and 2. that this contributes to the reinforcement of the leftist, Marxist 
trends in the ESP. 
The thesis which Khrushchev - proceeding from a realistic view of the 
international situation and of the actual power relationships in the various 
countries - formulated coriectly, in our opinion, has implications not only 
for the PCP but also for all Communist disruptive little parties which assume 
a.position over against a strong socialist party and which have rip held on 
the laboring nares. The. problem iaquite different where there are Communist 
and socialist parties of equal strenght or where the working class is 
represented by a strong Communist and a weak socialist party. 
The 20th Congress of the CPSU also began the demolition of the Stalin 
cult. This demolition, which was actually begun immediately after Stalin's 
death, was sealed at tho Congress by the secret report of Khrushchev. In 
view of the reactions in the entire world and first of all, in the other 
Communist parties., the CPSU set forth its standpoint in greater detail in 
ancther important document; the resolution of the Central. Committee "about 
the victorious struggle against the cult of the individual and its consequences 
adopted in July 1956. 
That which we remember from all of this material is that Stalin was 
a tyrant, who respected no one, at least during the last years of his life. 
In this regard the highest party authorities of the CPSU decided to tell 
the truth, no matter how unpleasant.

.eveeyone and he was always right. He withdrew himself from criti ism py'no 
? longer calling together the regular party authorities. This attilude resulted 
in a number of judicial crimes and mass repressions and it also led to a general 
sclerosis and paralysis of the initiative of the masses and of creative thinking 
in every field. Such an attitude was completely in conflict with Marxism and 
(not least) with the example of Lenin. 
People may disagree with some of the things contained in the secret report 
of Khrushchev and they may dispute the way in which this report was; brought 
to the attention Of the World; at any rate, the report remains a great 
liberating act. And there is little sense in wanting to start a fight against 
the terms "Stalinism" and "destalinization." As a result of theOth Congress 
these terms have eimply become standardized. The Belgian Communist know very 
well the term "Stalinism" means. It has resulted in the wrecking of their 
party. 
Does the use of these terms mean that henceforth there ae two kinds 
of Communists and that there is a threat of a new split within the labor 
movement? 
Not at all, unless some want to cling obstinately tolthe deviations 
from NerximmpeLenihism branded by the 20th Congress. Thie really seems 
to be the case with the leadership of the French CommunitSt Party, which 
has assumed a grave responsibility by opposing the neceSsaey destalinization 
and democratization, and not in France alone. In thipsregard and in connection 
with the discussion about this matter, the SCP ? which had an opportunity to 
show that it can still think independently ? is otanding nowhere; or rather, 
it is once again etanding on the wrong side. Among/other things the BCP is 
continuing to speak of mistakes " and "miscalculatiOns," and sometimes of 
"serious adstakes and miscalculations," but every thinking person, every 
Belgian worker knows that the things involved were Outright crimes and 
violations of justice. 
The sclerosis' is making headway. The theeketical schematism for 
beginners is making headway. 
What do I think about Hungary?

I have of course developed an opinion on the basis Of the mass Of reports, 
pro and con, and on the basis of my own appreciation of the events. 
As far as the course of the insurrection is concerned my opinion is the 
following: at the !bottom there was -Oustified and practically general state 
of dissatisfaction, which nevertheleas did not in the beginning threaten -she 
people's democratie regime. In part; however, as,a result of the weakness - 
and the blunders of Nagy, the reactionary and clerico?fascist elements assumed 
the leadership of the movement and/introduced, a kind of white terror which was 
directly aimed against the socialist achievements in general and against the 
Communists in particular. The seepe of this fasicis terror is to some extent 
underestimated in the Vest. At any rate, the result was that persons such as 
Janos Kadar thought the matter over and began a different course, that of the 
defense of the people's democraey with the aid of the Soviet troops. 
This intervention was undeubtedly a very regrettable matter. I think . 
this decision must also have been a painful one for the Soviet

view of the policy introduced by the 20th Congress, but that there were two 
kinds of considerations which tarried ? the scale: 
1. considerations of a military nature: rte threatening of the entire defensive 
position of the Soviet Union in Central Europe; 
2. considerations of a political nature: I do not think that there was a 
betrayal .of the destalinization.. To the contrary, I believe that without the 
interference of the Soviet troops the destalinization would have run into 
difficulties. It stands to reason that if Hungary should irr.ie been lost as 
an allied nation the unconverted "Staliniss" would have raised their heads 
everywhere and would have caused a great deal of trouble for the new course 
of the Politburo. I believe that this view is confirmed by the fact that 
Gomulka and the Poles got their way, sot:that "Hungary" did not destroy every 
hope which the 20th Congress had aroused. 
It me be so free as to an almost prophetic article of Blaude Boardet 
in the 18 October 1956 issue of L:Observateurt, prior to the tragic develop-
ment in Hungary, which concludes as follows: nend, my Polish and Hungarian 
friends, do not throw out the socialist baby with the dirtyStalinian bath 
water." 
The future alone will show whether the interference of the Soviet troops 
in Hungary has saved socialism and. peace. If this proves to be the case, 
then that interference was the least of two evils. 14hen all is said and done, 
however, I cannot forget that the Hungdrian.tragedy and the counterffrevo]ution 
were possible only as a result of 10 years of terror and folly, as 4 result 
.of the fact that incorrigible 4Stalinists" such as Rakosi and Gena whO were 
hated by the people remained in power until it was too late. 
That this was the great, the initial crime cannot be emphasized enough, 
if similar dramas are to be prevented from occurring elsewhere. Socialism 
is not an export commodity and it is particularly no terror. (1) 
(1) I will gladly set forth in a followin: contribution my views on the 
problem of the unity of the workers and of oexistence on the world 
scale.
