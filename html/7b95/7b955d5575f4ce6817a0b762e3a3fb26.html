 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 KHRUSHCHEV AT THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY                            Page 1
 Khrushchev seems determined to overcome any impres-
 sion that the bloc is on the defensive as a result of the
 generally adverse reaction to his UN reorganization plan.
 Khrushchev probably believed that the President's letter
 turning down a meeting and Macmillan's speech at the UN
 requited a vigorous reply to dispel any suggestion of re-
 treat,   His performance indicates that the bloc will pur-
 sue an uncompromising line toward the West for the remainder
 of the UN session, but in           talks with Prime Minister
 Macmillan he has indicate     a  a summit negotiation on
 the Berlin question might be possible in a few months.
 Hammarskjold will be under increasing pressure from
 Asian-African UN members to revamp the senior echelons
 of the UN Secretariat to make its composition more repre-
 sentative of the present membership.
 REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO  .  .  .  .         .    .    .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 4
 The government crisis in Leopoldville continues, al-
 though Lumumba appears to have lost the support of many
 of the deputies from his own stronghold of Stanleyville
 and may no longer be able to carry the assembly.   The
 projected round-table conference of political leaders
 now may be shelved by Colonel Mobutu in favor of a
 direct appeal to the Congolese assembly.   The apparent
 erosion of Lumumba's support will make it more difficult
 for his African allies--the UAR, Ghana, and Guinea--to
 restore him to power.   Meanwhile, the UN Command is
 turning greater attention to the Congo's grave economic
 SITUATION IN LAOS   .

 Premier Souvanna Phouma seems to be gaining the upper
 hand in his struggle with General Phoumi's Savannakhet
 Revolutionary Group.   Souvanna's improved position is re-
 flected in his growing reluctance to negotiate with
 Savannakhet.   Negotiations between Souvanna and the
 Communist Pathet Lao are apparently imminent.   The
 Pathet Lao will be negotiating from a strong position
 because of its control of Sam Neua Province.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 SING-SOVIET RELATIONS       .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .           .  . .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 1
 Moscow evidently sent a high-level delegation, pos-
 sibly including Mikoyan and Suslov, to Peiping in September,
 presumably to attempt again to find some way to compose the
 dispute between the Soviet and Chinese Communist parties
 and end the bitter recriminations of recent months.                              Moscow
 may have felt that as a result of its campaign to isolate
 the Chinese party in the world Communist movement, Peiping
 would be more ready to compromise.   Recent Chinese state-
 ments, however, suggest that no progress toward reconcilia-
 tion has been made, and a further deterioration in rela-
 tions appears likely.
 PEIPING CELEBRATES. NATIONAL DAY  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page 4
 The 11th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese
 Communist regime was celebrated on 1 October in a more
 subdued spirit than in previous years.   Peiping had no
 outstanding economic achievements to announce; indeed,
 the principal speaker this year, Foreign Minister Chen
 Yi, dwelt on the effects of natural disasters on this
 year's grain harvest.   The failure of all bloc coun-
 tries, except Albania, to send delegations underlined
 the stresses in the Sino-Soviet alliance.   A highlight
 of the day was the signing of the Sino-Burmese boundary
 treaty--an event stressed in holiday propaganda, particu-
 larly for neutral countries, as proof of Chinese adher-
 ence to peaceful coexistence.
 ALBANIA REAFFIRMS SUPPORT OF CHINESE POSITIONS .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 5
 Albania, the smallest and least significant of the
 satellites, in the last three weeks has firmly aligned it-
 self with the Chinese Communist positions in the Sino-
 Soviet dispute.   China is supporting Albania in the face
 of growing Soviet disapproval of the Tirana regime.     The
 Soviet leaders probably view Albania's continued willing-
 ness to defy Moscow as a threat to their campaign to
 isolate Ching and to their authority in Eastern Europe,
 and can be expected to make further moves to bring
 Albania into line.   Tirana leaders earlier were reported
 to be uneasy and tense, apparently because of Soviet
 pressure, and evidently have postponed their party
 congress scheduled for November.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PART II (continued)
 Togliatti can be expected to keep the party firmly
 oriented toward Moscow, but opposition elements may
 attempt to use the Sino-Soviet dispute to undercut the
 present party leaders.       Provincial congresses reportedly
 will be held throughout Italy this fall to discuss
 "peaceful coexistence between diverse systems and the
 noninevitability of war."
 TENSIONS OVER BERLIN .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 Bonn?s termination of its 1961 trade agreement with
 East Germany--announced on 30 September in retaliation for
 Communist harassment of West Berlin--will probably not re.-
 suit in an end to interzonal trade, but it puts West
 Germany in a legal position to take further action to
 restrict trade.   Bonn and West Berlin authorities are
 considering a plan to strengthen West Berlin's position
 by routing all interzonal shipments through West Berlin,
 thereby making it difficult for the East Germans to
 tamper with Berlin access routes without blocking their
 own imports.   Party boss Ulbricht on 4 October strongly
 asserted East German "sovereignty" over East Berlin. and
 demanded establishment of a demilitarized "free city" of
 West Berlin, but gave no indication of what counter-
 measures his regime intends to take.   His cautious atti-
 tude may mean that any decision on countermeasures must
 await Khrushchev's return from New York.
 Fidel Castro's experience at the UN General Assembly
 has apparently strengthened his view of himself as a
 leader of the peoples of all underdeveloped countries
 "against imperialism," and there are indications that he
 may return to the UN later this month.   Castro has an-
 nounced that Nkrumah and Nasir may visit Cuba, and his
 regime is increasing its propaganda support of the
 Algerian rebels.   Meanwhile, the government is further
 strengthening its ties to the Sino-Soviet bloc in various
 ways.

 NEW PARTY STRUCTURE IN THE SOVIET ARMED FORCES .  .  .  .  .  .            Page  12
 A plan set forth in May to expand the regular party
 structure in the Soviet armed services now is being im-
 plemented as a result of a new decree of the Soviet central
 committee.   Battalion.--level party organizations are being
 given powers formerly exercised at the regimental level.
 Further steps toward replacing the political departments
 in military units with the type of party organizational
 forms found in civilian life will probably depend on the
 success the new organizations have in safeguarding party
 interests in the military

 PART II  (continued)
 USSR INTENSIFIES CAMPAIGN AGAINST IDLERS .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 12
 Moscow has stepped up its drive against "parasites"
 and idlers, and greater efforts are being made to generate
 widespread public indignation against all forms of unde-
 sirable behavior.   The campaign has spread into all social
 levels, even the upper levels of the bureaucracy, and in-
 cludes particularly vehement attacks on the tendency to
 acquire private property.   Parasitism in all its varieties
 is characterized as the most serious vice of present-day
 Soviet society.
 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 14
 Representatives of the Algerian rebels are intensify-
 ing their efforts both in New York and in Western capitals
 to secure backing for a UN-conducted referendum to settle
 Algeria's political future.   Rebel Premier Ferhat Abbas'
 trip to Peiping was probably undertaken to demonstrate to
 Western governments that the rebels were in earnest when
 they stated they would accept aid "wherever it can be
 found."  Meanwhile, Morocco and Tunisia are engaged in
 maneuvers designed to enlist UN intervention in Algeria
 on the pattern of UN operations in the Congo.
 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 15
 The situation along the Syrian-Jordanian border has
 eased somewhat, but efforts to arrange a meeting between
 Husayn and Nasir have been unsuccessful, and the tensions
 between the two countries persist.   Jordan's recognition
 of the Qasim regime in Iraq stems from the antipathy of
 both governments toward the UAR; the two countries now may
 cooperate to support secessionist tendencies in the UAR's
 Syrian region.   On a neighboring border,  Israel's resump-
 tion of dredging work in the Jordan River is causing new
 friction with the UAR,
 In Iraq, the regime's crackdown on extremism in the
 press appears to be damaging the Communists more than the
 nationalists.   Relations between the Qasim government and.
 the  Iraq Petroleum Company are worsening.   New efforts are
 under way in Sudan to form a coalition among the various
 influential elements seeking to oust the Abboud regime.
 AFGHAN-PAKISTANI BORDER TROUBLES .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 18
 Fighting among the Pushtoon tribes living along the
 Afghan-Pakistani border north of the Khyber Pass now ap-
 pears to be slackening.   Despite the continuing build-up
 of military forces in the area and the exchange of re-
 criminations, both Kabul and Rawalpindi seem to be trying
 to keep the disturbance localized.

 SINO-BURMESE BORDER TREATY .  .                                                                              .  .    ?

 The Burmese consider the border treaty signed on 1
 October in Peiping their most significant diplomatic
 achievement since independence.                                                                                 The exactitude of the
 language and completeness of detail in the treaty appear
 to be products of the Burmese chief negotiator's  deter-
 mined effort to make it difficult for Peiping to find any
 basis for future disputes over the treaty's interpretation.
 The Burmese still view the Chinese as a dangerous neigh-
 bor and have placed the frontier areas under special
 PHILIPPINE CONCERN OVER POSSIBLE RESURGENCE OF HUK
 ACTIVITY .  .  .  .  .                                          .  .  .  .   Page 20
 A recent wave of killings in Luzon provinces, possibly
 politically motivated, has caused speculation in the
 Philippines concerning a possible resurgence of the Commu-
 nist-led Huk rebellion.   The Auks apparently have no more
 than a nuisance capability, however, and the Philippine
 Communists are not believed to be abandoning their
 primary reliance on tactics of subversion and on efforts
 to exploit the country's growing nationalist sentiment.
 SOUTH KOREAN UNREST  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .    .       .  .  .  .  .   Page 21
 Increasing South Korean student unrest, agitation
 among lower ranking officers in the armed forces, and
 press criticism suggest growing popular dissatisfaction
 with the Chang Myon government.   The situation is aggra-
 vated by the political stalemate resulting from factional-
 ism in the ruling party which prevents the government from
 t
 k
 a
 ing a firm lead in shaping public opinion.
 THE COMMON MARKET'S FARM PROBLEM .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 22
 The Common Market is encountering strong opposition
 to its program for gradually equalizing agricultural
 prices among the member states, supporting prices with
 variable import duties, and replacing national marketing
 bodies with community agencies.   The program, which had
 been recently revised by the Common Market Commission
 in an effort to satisfy both internal and external criti-
 cism, is still criticized as either insufficiently pro-
 tectionist or not liberal enough.                        An agreed farm policy,
 however, is probably prerequisite to full implementation
 of last May'   decision to accelerate the Common Market's
 development.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 October 1960
 PART II (continued)
 POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN EL SALVADOR .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .        Page  23
 The Salvadoran Government has emerged from its recent
 political crisis in a dangerously weakened condition and
 on 3 October extended the state of siege for an additional
 30 days.   Communist and pro-Castro elements are actively
 exploiting growing popular pressure for socio-economic
 reforms, and President Lemus has been unable to provide
 the leadership required to carry out his electoral prom-
 ises of moderate progress in this field.   A new political
 crisis could arise at any time and might result in a
 military seizure of power and the subsequent transfer of
 the presidency to the still popular ex-President Osorio.
 PROSPECTIVE CHANGES IN FEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND
 NYASALAND  .  .  .  .    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  24
 The publication on 11 October of the Monckton Com-
 mission report on possible structural changes in the
 Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland will revive controver-
 sy as London tries to reach an accommodation between white-
 settler and African-nationalist interests.  While now
 tending to concede to African aspirations, London will
 be unwilling to "sell out" the white settlers at a con-
 stitutional conference which may follow as early as
 December.   Britain's recent moves to promote harmonious
 relations with African nationalists will probably not
 prove wholly successful, and the federations' white-
 settler prime minister already opposes the reported
 recommendation that Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia be
 free to secede after five years.
 REPUBLIC REFERENDUM IN SOUTH AFRICA   .  .
 .  .   Page  26
 The victory of Prime Minister Verwoerd's Nationalist
 party in the referendum on 5 October gives Verwoerd a
 mandate to press for the early reconstitution of South
 Africa as a republic.   The strong showing of the opposi-
 tion indicates that the deep split between the Afrikaans-.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES IN TURKEY . .  .  ,  .
 Page  1
 As the military regime in Turkey enters its fifth
 month in power, the restoration of civil authority, which
 the regime still professes as its goal, appears more
 distant than ever.   The ruling Committee of National Union
 (CNU), having consolidated its position, has launched a
 widespread program of reform.   Despite outward signs of
 stability, however, there are growing indications of
 cleavage and tension within the ruling group and of
 possible adverse public reaction to the forthcoming
 trials of officials of the ousted Menderes government.
 In developing its foreign policy, the CNU may in effect
 promote "positive neutrality" and accept Soviet aid offers.
 FRENCH LABOR AND THE FIFTH REPUBLIC   .  .  .  .  .  .
 French labor unions have been in a relatively un-
 favorable position under the De Gaulle regime, and until
 well into 1959 were hesitant to press demands on the
 government.   Since then strike activity has increased,
 but the government has ignored most union demands and
 is unlikely to change its basic policy of tight wage
 controls.   The Communist leaders of the General Labor
 Confederation are confident that they have laid a firm
 basis for broad joint action with the non-Communist
 unions at some future date.
 BOLIVIA UNDER THE NEW PAZ ADMINISTRATION .  .  .  .  .
 In its first two months in office the leftist Paz
 Estenssoro administration has initiated a drive for
 foreign aid in improving Bolivia's economy, which is
 nearly bankrupt despite continuing US help.    Paz

 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 KHRUSHCHEV AT THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
 Khrushchev's actions and
 statements at the UN are in-
 tended to make it clear that the
 USSR will not retreat from its
 demands in face of the generally
 adverse reaction to his UN reor-
 ganization plan and attacks on
 Secretary General Hammarskjold.
 After a few attempts to play
 down this question and re-empha-
 size disarmament as the key is-
 sue facing the assembly, Khru-
 shchev reacted to continuing
 strong support for Hammarskjold
 and criticism of the Soviet plan
 by renewing his attacks on the
 secretary general.
 In his address on 3 October
 he warned that Hammarskjold's
 failure to resign would lead
 the Soviet Union to draw the
 "necessary conclusions," and he
 threatened to withhold Soviet
 cooperation with future UN de-
 cisions.   In his previous speech
 on the Chinese representation
 question, Khrushchev hinted the
 bloc might withdraw from the UN
 and form a separate internation-
 al organization.
 Khrushchev's tactics in re-
 newing his campaign suggest.. that
 he sees a sustained attack backed
 by occasional threats as the only
 means of achieving some results
 which could be represented as an
 acknowledgment of the validity
 of Soviet demands for a redis-
 tribution of power in the UN ex-
 ecutive organs.   The Soviet Un-
 ion may feel that continuing
 attacks on Hammarskjold's posi-
 tion will gradually erode sup-
 port for him among the Afro-
 Asian powers.
 Eisenhower-Khrushchev Meeting
 Khrushchev's strategy in
 handling the question of a meet-
 ing with President Eisenhower,
 as proposed by five neutralist
 leaders, appears to have back-
 fired and forced a switch in
 tactics.
 After Nasir's original
 call for a meeting,  bloc dele-  25X1
 gates encouraged expectations of
 a favorable reply from Khrushchev.
 25X1
 ru-
 shchev had obtained "permission"
 from Moscow for the meeting.  It
 is likely that Khrushchev ex-
 pected that the United States
 would have difficulty rejecting
 the neutral powers'  initiative
 out of hand,  and that an equiv-
 ocal reply would provide a wide
 field for maneuvers designed to
 discredit American sincerity
 and contrast the President's
 expected insistence on release
 of the RB-47 crew with Khru-
 shchev's own willingness to dis-
 regard previous American "prov-
 ocations."
 The President's letter re-
 jecting the neutralists' move
 and calling for "Soviet action
 in the UN and elsewhere" to pave
 the way for future talks created
 a new and apparently unexpected
 situation.   Khrushchev probably
 believed that,  in light of
 Macmillan's rebuttal, of his
 views and the President's re-
 jection of a meeting,  even an
 ambiguous response from him
 would have implied a. retreat
 under pressure from the position

 he took in Paris and would have
 been interpreted as a sign of
 weakness.
 In his 3 October speech,
 therefore, Khrushchev dismissed
 any hope for agreement in a
 bilateral meeting as "naive"
 and made no attempt to align
 himself with the neutralists'
 position.   In his formal reply
 to the five leaders, he avoided
 an outright rejection of a meet-
 ing but reverted to his patently
 unacceptable demands for con-
 demnation of the U-2 and RB-47
 flights as a precondition to a
 meeting.
 The Soviet leader apparent-
 ly chose to regard the Presi-
 dent's position as an affront
 to his own prestige and that of
 the USSR, and felt it required
 a vigorous reply.   Khrushchev
 probably also concluded that
 any acknowledgment of the pos-
 sibility of resuming negotia-
 tions now would have blunted his
 efforts to use this UN session
 to indict the West on the issues
 of anticoloniajism, the Congo
 situation, and the U-2 affair.
 In his letter to the neu-
 tralists, Khrushchev did not
 repeat his characterization of
 the idea of a meeting as "naive,"
 but instead sought to place the
 onus on the President for fail-
 ure of the initiative.   He
 strongly rejected "any attempts
 to advance some preliminary con-
 ditions" for a meeting by the
 "side which has embarked on the
 road of perfidy..." and contended
 that the President's letter
 proves that the United States
 "has no serious intention of
 seeking ways to Settle oiat9tand-
 ing issues."  Nehru withdrew
 the five-power resolution on 5
 October, explaining that amend-
 ments had made it meaningless.
 SECRET
 East-West Issues
 Although Khrushchev's per-
 formance indicates that the
 bloc is determined to pursue an
 uncompromising line toward the
 West for the remainder of the
 UN session,  in his            talks 25X1
 with Prime Minister Macmillan
 and in his remarks to the press,
 Khrushchev attempted to keep
 alive the possibility of a sum-
 mit conference on the Berlin and
 German questions.  In his first
 meeting with Macmillan on 29
 September, Khrushchev proposed
 that a summit conference could
 be convened in January, provided
 there were no "provocations" by
 Bonn.   He stressed the standard
 Soviet position that the West
 must recognize the existence
 of two German states, sign a
 peace treaty on that basis,
 and "liquidate" the occupation
 of Berlin.
 These statements were ac-
 companied by the warning that
 the West's failure to agree
 would result in a German peace
 conference and the conclusion
 of a separate peace treaty.
 Khrushchev, as well as
 Foreign Minister Gromyko in his
 discussions with Foreign
 Secretary Home, defended the
 recent East German actions in
 Berlin as justified countermoves,
 but indicated that Moscow was
 not seeking a new crisis.   Gro-
 myko warned,  however,  that fu-
 ture developments would depend
 on the West.
 The second round of Khru-
 shchev-Macmillan discussions
 apparently covered the same
 ground.   According to press re-
 ports quoting Soviet diplomats,
 Khrushchev refused to agree that
 disarmament discussions could
 be resumed in the ten-nation

 cow   is not prepared to nego-
 tiate with the United States un-

 office.
 UN Afro-Asian Bloc
 Both East and West are com-
 peting for the support of the
 UN's 45-member Afro-Asian bloc,
 which includes countries allied
 to the United States by treaties
 as well as those seemingly fol-
 lowing the Soviet line.   There
 is also a rivalry among members
 of the bloc itself for recogni-
 tion as its principal spokesman
 and leader.   President Tito of
 Yugoslavia probably still hopes
 to recruit members of this loose-
 ly knit group into his  "third
 -force."   Nehru,  Sukarno,  Nasir,
 and Nkrumab of Gana   also have
 presented themselves as poten-
 tial leaders of the group.  Dele-
 gates from most of the Asian,
 African,   and Arab members have
 stressed their bloc's potential
 for mediation between the major
 rival camps.
 The addition of 16 new
 states--15 from Africa plus
 Cyprus--has made the Afro-Asian
 bloc potentially the largest
 voting group in the General As-
 sembly.   Even if a strong lead-
 er should emerge,  dissensions
 within the group and the wide
 disparity of culture and polit-
 ical maturity among its members
 will probably continue to prevent
 a great degree of cohesiveness.
 The Asian-African bloc ex-
 hibits considerable unanimity
 on the subject of anticolonial-
 ism, and Khrushchev's emphasis
 on this issue has probably had
 strong emotional appeal to the
 group as a whole.
 At a 29 September meeting
 of the bloc,  Krishna Menon of
 India led an attack against
 Portugal's candidacy for the
 Western European seat on the
 Security Council which is to
 be vacated by Italy at the end
 of the year.   While recognizing
 the dangers of throwing the con-
 ventional system of allocating
 elective seats on the Security
 Council into "disequilibrium"
 by not supporting the Western
 European choice for the seat,
 several Asian-African members
 insist that Portugal,  the major
 remaining "symbol of colonial-
 ism," cannot be allowed to rule
 on international issues,  par-
 ticularly as related to Africa,
 by virtue of a seat on the UN
 Security Council.
 Portugal has been under
 attack ever since it joined the
 UN in 1955 for its refusal to
 be bound by the UN Charter pro-
 vision requiring members to
 submit yearly reports on their
 non-self-governing territories.
 The Portuguese maintain they
 have no such territories,  that
 all their possessions are in-
 tegral parts of Portugal itself.
 Since the'balloting for the of-
 fice is secret, and strong op-
 position from the Afro-Asians
 is developing rapidly,  Lisbon's
 claim to have commitments from
 62 nations is doubtful,  and the
 Salazar regime itself has re-
 cently been showing consider-
 able apprehension about its
 chances.
 Opposition to Portugal
 might result in the emergence
 of another candidate for the
 seat; Yugoslavia,  Iceland,
 Austria,  and Finland have been
 suggested.   With the UAR ex-
 pected to get the Middle East
 seat, the possibility that the
 Western European seat might be
 occupied by a member not closely
 allied to the West will make it
 difficult to ensure the West

 Hammarskjold, in order to
 keep the support of the smaller
 nations in his fight with the
 Soviet bloc, will be under in-
 creasing pressure to revamp the
 upper echelons of the UN Secre-
 tariat.   The preponderance of
 American. and Western European
 nationals in the Secretariat?
 although a direct result of the
 unavailability of qualified ap-
 plicants from other areas at
 the time of the founding of the
 UN--has long been a grievance
 to members of the Afro-Asian
 bloc,
 Nkrumah's proposal of 30
 September urging the creation
 of an advisory group of under
 secretaries representing the
 various power groupings probably
 would have the support of many
 Afro-Asians.   Most seem to agree
 that the USSR's suggestion to
 create a triumvirate to replace
 the secretary general is unreal-
 istic since it would require an
 amendment to the UN Charter.
 Prime Minister Nehru,  in reject-
 ing the Soviet recommendation,
 nevertheless agreed that the
 policy-making level of the Sec-
 retariat should take account
 of the various UN groupings.
 The British UN delegation
 believes that the Afro--Asians
 would be susceptible to the argu-
 ment that the USSR must be given
 some concession to its point  of
 view and would regard Nkrumah's
 proposal as the obvious solu-
 tion.   The British delegation
 views Nkrumah's proposal with
 the alarm because it would per-
 mit the Russians to gain either
 positive direction of or at
 least negative control over the
 Secretariat's operations and because
 it would introduce   political
 considerations  on   a   level
 just   under   the secretary gen-
 eral.
 The government crisis in
 Leopoldville continues.  Lumumba
 is still at the premier's offi-
 cial residence guarded by UN
 troops and has ventured outside
 on only two occasions recently.
 President Kasavubu has made few
 public appearances,  and Colonel
 Mobutu has remained mostly in
 Camp Leopold.   The recently in-
 stalled Commission of Tebhnicians
 is functioning but has yet to
 come to grips with the Congo's
 administrative problems.
 Lumumba's position in his
 political stronghold of Orien-
 tale Province appears to be
 cracking.    On 5 October, Mobutu
 arrested two leading Lumumba
 supporters there without op-
 position.                   the ex-    25X1
 premier's hold over the local
 political and military organiza-
 tion is weakening because of
 poor leadership and lack of
 funds.
 In addition, Lumumba ap-

 of many members of the delega-

 from Orientale Province--a loss
 which may make it impossible for
 him to obtain an assembly ma-

 Outbreaks of smallpox and bubonic
 plague have already necessitated

 THE SITUATION IN LAOS
 Premier Souvanna Phouma
 appears to be gaining the upper
 hand in his struggle with Gen-
 eral Phoumi's Savannakhet Rev-
 olutionary Committee.   His order
 dismissing Phoumi and 26 other
 officers from the army,  his an-
 nounced refusal to negotiate
 with Phoumi,  and his insistence
 that Phoumi pledge his loyalty
 to the legal government all re-
 flect Souvanna's growing confi-
 dence.   The premier planned to
 go to Luang Prabang on 6 Octo-
 ber, ostensibly for the first
 of several consultations King
 Savang will have with various
 Laotian leaders with a view to-
 ward formation of a new govern-
 ment of national unity embracing
 both the Vientiane and Savanna-
 khet camps.
 Souvanna asked his supporters
 to organize a popular demonstra-
 tion timed to coincide with his
 visit to Luang Prabang provides
 another indication that he may
 now feel strong enough to avoid
 a compromise with Savannakhet.
 Such a demonstration would tend
 to dissuade the King from ask-

 the Pathet Lao has sent addition-
 al personnel into neighboring
 Phong Saly Province. Although
 little fighting has been reported
 there,  the insurgents may be try-
 ing to create a position of strength
 in .that,. area in anticipation of
 the forthcoming talks. The Pathet
 Lao used Phong Saly and Sam
 Neua as their trump cards in the
 negotiations which culminated
 In the integration agreements of
 1957 and the subsequent formation
 of a coalition; government.
 The King has approved the
 proposal for establishing dip-
 lomatic relations between Laos
 and the USSR, thus completing
 the procedures required under
 the constitution for entering
 into relations with another state.
 Under present plans, the Soviet
 ambassador to Cambodia will be
 accredited'to Laos-and the Lao-
 tian ambassador to France will
 be accredited to the USSR.
 Hanoi has hailed the fall
 of Sam Neua as a victory for the
 Laotian people.   Pathet Lao
 operations in northern Laos have
 probably been supported by Hanoi,
 but there  is  no  evidence to
 support  rumors   that  North
 Vietnamese troops are in Laos.
 While it may be providing Lao-
 tian Communists with training
 and provisioning depots across
 the border in North Vietnam,
 Hanoi probably would be reluc-
 tant to become more overtly in-
 volved at present for fear of
 precipitating pro-Western in-
 tervention at a time when Hanoi
 most likely feels that the Laotian
 situation is favorable for the
 Pathet Lao.
 The Soviet counselor in
 Peiping recently told a British
 visitor that Peiping did not
 intend to intervene in Laos,
 but if the Chinese should de-
 cide to send troops to counter
 a United Nations move into Laos,
 the USSR would support Peiping
 even to the extent of sending
 Soviet troops.   The US consul
 general in Hong Kong Points out
 that the Soviet counselor's
 statement is indicative of the
 impression Moscow wants conveyed
 to the West.
 Moscow propaganda continues
 to show concern that the UN or
 Laos' pro-Western neighbors might
 intervene and has stressed the
 gravity of the Laotian situation
 in an effort to prevent such
 intervention.   Moscow radio on 30
 September called for the United
 States to stop its interference
 in Laotian internal affairs and  25X1
 accused Thailand of planning a
 joint attack with the! United
 States against Laos.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Less than three months
 after the bitter confrontation
 of the Soviet and the Chinese
 Communist parties last June at
 Bucharest, which increased the
 already rapid pace of deteri-
 oration in their relations, the
 Soviet Union evidently sent a
 high-level delegation to Pei-
 ping for still another attempt
 to reach a mutually satisfac-
 tory position.   The  Soviet
 party may have felt that its
 efforts of the preceding two
 months to marshal support for
 its own views and thus isolate
 the Chinese within the world
 Communist movement would induce
 the Chinese to adopt positions
 closer to those of the Soviet
 Union.   Recent Chinese state-
 ments suggest,  however,  that
 no progress toward reconcilia-
 tion has been made.
 Ambassador Thompson reported
 on 27 September that a rumor
 was circulating in Moscow that
 Mikoyan and Suslov were visit-
 ing China.
 A delegation of this stat-
 ure,                                                                   including Suslov,   the
 Soviet Union's top ideologist,
 would be empowered to conduct
 authoritative negotiations
 with the Chinese--and to make
 some adjustment in the Soviet
 positions--in an effort to
 bring their views closer to-
 gether in order that the meeting
 of Communist parties in Moscow
 in November not result in the
 same impasse as the Bucharest
 meeting.  In addition, the delega-
 tion may have been sent to China
 to determine if a meeting of
 Chinese leaders with Khrushchev
 during his planned visit to
 North Korea in October would
 be possible and fruitful.
 Recent Chinese statements
 suggest that this latest attempt
 at reconciliation failed. Dur-
 ing the period when the talks
 were presumably under way, Chi-
 nese treatment of the issues
 in  'dispute was pitched in a
 low key.   On 29 September, how-
 ever,                                                       the Chinese party central
 committee, in a commentary on
 a new volume of Mao Tse-tung's
 works, issued its most substan-
 tial reaffirmation since the
 Bucharest meeting of several
 of the most important Chinese
 positions in the dispute.
 The commentary warns against
 "illusions hbout imperialism,"

 cites past Western peace
 "tricks," insists that peace
 can be achieved only through
 struggle, rebukes those who
 overestimate the strength of
 the enemy and underestimate
 the strength of the revolution-
 ary forces, and reiterates that
 imperialism is a "paper tiger."
 The commentary concludes that
 the volume is of "tremendous
 significance" for the present
 situation and will become a
 powerful weapon in "intensify-
 ing the struggle against im-
 perialism and modern revision-
 ism"--the latter phrase one
 which the Chinese often use to
 describe Soviet policy.
 In :reaffirming that Mao's
 propositions were successful
 in the Chinese revolution,  the
 Chinese party appears to be
 asserting that it has been right
 all along and that Soviet argu-
 ments have not persuaded it to
 change its views.   The publi-
 cation of this commentary ap-
 pears to mark the opening of
 a new offensive by the Chinese
 in support of their views.  A
 People's Daily editorial on 30
 September picked up the same
 themes for exploitation.  Red
 Flag, Communist China's theor-
 etical journal, which has been
 silent on international ques-
 tions since early June, devoted
 two articles of its current
 issueto demonstrating how Mao's
 theses properly fit the present
 situation.   The American consul
 general in Hong Kong concludes
 that the editorials in Red
 Flag and other publications
 indicate that a massive Chinese
 campaign is now under way to
 show that Mao is the "creative
 Marxist" on international ques-
 tions and that his opponents
 are the ones divorced from
 reality.
 It seems likely that this
 hard line will be the Chinese
 party's position in any further
 bilateral talks with the Soviet
 or other parties prior to the
 November conclave,  or at the
 Moscow meeting itself.   Some in-
 dication of the strong line
 which the Soviet party is now
 likely to take in this meeting
 came in a public lecture on
 ideology in Moscow on 30 Septem-
 ber.   The speaker said "he had
 to admit" that the Chinese were
 dogmatists because of their
 incorrect assessment of the
 world situation and, since their
 views definitely represent left-
 ist. deviation,  they would re-
 quire self-criticism and ad-
 mission of error.
 Dealing with another cen-
 tral issue in the dispute, Army
 Major General Nikolay A. Talen-
 sky, a noted writer on Soviet
 military doctrine, has condemned
 the idea that war might be jus-
 tified if it meant the end of
 capitalism.   In the magazine
 International' Life,   Talensky
 said that after Ianother war,
 which "could not fail" to be a
 world war,  "the earth's popu-
 lation would be cut in half, and
 it would be the most active and
 most cultured part of mankind
 that would disappear."  He con-
 cluded that a mass surprise
 would    not   bring victory for
 the attacker because the re-
 taliation could still destroy
 all his vital centers.
 The article, which has been
 given added stature by a review
 by TASS,  is a direct attack on
 the Chinese Communist attitude
 that the dangers of nuclear war
 have been overrated.   Talensky
 is also in effect reiterating
 to the Chinese--who continue
 to clamor for Taiwan--that the
 concept of limited war is invalid
 because it would risk full-
 scale war.   This is the most em-
 phatic major article on military
 theory to appear in the Soviet
 press since the Sino-Soviet dis-
 pute sharpened at the Bucharest

 conference, and indicates an
 effort to show in practical mil-
 itary terms why the coexistence
 line must be followed.
 The strain in Sino-Soviet
 relations was pointed up by the
 failure of any Communist coun-
 try, except Albania, to send
 a delegation to Peiping to take
 part in the 1 October anniver-
 sary celebrations.   All the
 communiques of congratulations,
 a standard part of any such
 celebrations, were unenthusias-
 tic and routine, and none--with
 the exception of Albania and
 the Asian satellites--made a
 personal reference to Mao.   In
 speeches and writings on the
 anniversary, the Chinese,.:with
 the support of the Albanians on
 one side, and the Soviet Union
 and the other bloc members on
 the other, while all paying con-
 ventional tribute to the need
 for bloc unity, displayed sharp
 contrasts in their assessments
 of the international situation.
 In addition to the support
 given Moscow on this occasion,
 the satellites have moved in
 other directions as well.   In
 mid-September, the Polish cen-
 tral committee, the last of the
 East European central committees
 to discuss the results of the
 June Bucharest conference,  is-
 sued a resolution which faith-
 fully mirrored the Soviet Un-
 ion's own.   The Poles--as have
 some of the other Communist
 parties--sent a letter to Pei-
 ping disputing the Chinese po-
 sition on the inevitability of
 war and reaffirming the Soviet
 concept of peaceful coexistence.
 A shrill note of irrita-
 tion has begun to appear in
 the day-to-day contacts between
 the Chinese Communists and mem-
 bers of the rest of the Soviet
 bloc.   Earlier reports that
 bloc diplomats were increas-
 ingly bitter over their treat-
 ment by the Chinese in Peiping
 has in part been substantiated
 by complaints made by the Pol-
 ish  ambassador in mid-Septem-
 ber over restrictions placed by
 the Chinese on the movements of
 all diplomats.  Despite the
 fact that the Chinese ambassador
 is the dean of the diplomatic
 corps in Prague and that rep-
 resentatives of all major na-
 tions gathered to see Czech
 leader Novotny and Polish boss
 Gomulka depart from Prague for
 the UN session on 18 September,
 the Chinese ambassador failed
 to appear.
 At the International Scien-
 tific Film Association meeting
 in Prague, which began on 16
 September, the Chinese dele-
 gates refused to ride in the
 same bus with the Soviet dele-
 gation.   The Soviet chairman of
 the meetings publicly condemned
 the Chinese when they arrived
 late for a meeting and recommend-
 ed that they emulate the conduct
 of the American delegates.   Hong
 Kong distributors of Druzhba,
 the Sino-Soviet Friendship So-
 ciety magazine published in Mos-
 cow,  learned on 3 October in
 answer to their earlier query
 that publication of the maga-
 zine has ended and that they
 would receive a refund for the
 unused portion of their subscrip-
 tions.  A Soviet distributor in
 July had indicated that cessa-
 tion of the magazine was still
 an open question.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 With the present unyield-
 ing attitudes evinced by both
 major parties,     it is difficult
 to see how the planned confer-
 ence in Moscow can make much
 headway..  The Chinese, bolstered
 by the expression of support
 from the Albanians and the de-
 termined effort of Ho Chi Minh
 to remain neutral,:. may become
 even more adamant in hopes. of
 encouraging  whatever  under-
 currents of sympathy may exist
 in other parties.  The USSR,
 faced with the possibility of
 additional defections from the
 ranks of its supporters, may
 feel it necessary to contain
 the Chinese by withdrawing some
 of the economic and military
 benefits it has bestowed on        25X1
 them.  A further deterioration
 in relations appears the most
 likely outcome.
 PEIPING CELEBRATES NATIONAL DAY
 The 11th anniversary of
 the founding of the Chinese
 Communist regime was celebrated
 on 1 October in a more subdued
 spirit than in previous years.
 Peiping had no outstanding eco-
 nomic achievements to announce;
 indeed, the principal speaker
 this year, Foreign Minister Chen
 Yi, dwelt on the effects of nat-
 ural disasters on this year's
 grain harvest.
 Statements on the domestic
 economic situation were mostly
 generalities to, the effect that
 things were going as well as
 could be expected, at least in
 industry.    Chen Yi asserted that
 China was continuing its "leap
 forward," now in its third year,
 and expressed confidence that
 the major targets for industri-
 al production this year would
 be met.
 The regime has been unusu-
 ally reticent about industry's
 performance this year, but Chen
 did claim that output of iron
 and steel had increased about
 40 percent, electric power about
 45 percent, and coal about 25
 percent by the end of August
 as compared with the same peri-
 od in 1959.   Output of major
 industrial products is there-
 fore apparently proceeding at
 or near scheduled levels.
 Despite a massive campaign
 to enlist the help of "all the
 people," the nation's agriculture
 continues to founder.  Comments
 on agriculture were confined to
 references to the "worst" nat-
 ural calamities since the re-
 gime came to power.  People's
 Daily said in its National Day
 editorial that some 150,000,000
 acres--about half the total grain
 area--had been affected by ca-
 lamities, and that one third
 of this area had sustained "seri-
 ous" losses.  Peiping says
 drought has struck wide areas
 for the second straight year,
 adding that reservoirs through-
 out the nation are only about
 40 percent full and that only
 50 percent of this water can be
 used for irrigation.
 Independent weather data
 through late September reveal
 that crop weather, although bad,
 was not as bleak as the picture
 drawn by the regime.  Drought
 is continuing in the North China
 plain and will hinder the plant-
 ing of the winter wheat crop;
 the late rice crop is several
 weeks behind schedule and could
 be damaged by an early frost.
 Industry is providing
 more in the way of material
 support for agriculture than
 ever before--120 percent more

 chemical fertilizer, 82 percent
 more insecticides, and 18 per-
 cent more. irrigation machinery
 were furnished in the first
 eight months of 1960 than in the
 comparable period last year--
 but the gains here have not
 dispelled the regime's concern
 over crop prospects.
 The National Day cele-
 brations provided little fresh
 insight into the leadership
 situation in China.   Most of
 the regime's top officials were
 in attendance in Peiping, and
 the absence of several others
 could be accounted for by the
 press of regional duties.   Mao
 Tse-tung as head of the party
 and Liu Shao-chi as head of the
 government and heir apparent to
 Mao's party role jointly re-
 ceived the accolades of the
 more than 500,000 people who
 jammed Tienanmen Square,  and
 the two leaders shared promi-
 nence in holiday newspapers,
 which featured their pictures.
 Chen Yun, at one time the re-
 gime's leading economic plan-
 ner whose activities now may
 be restricted by illness, oc-
 cupied a place on the rostrum
 among the top party leaders.
 Missing, however, were
 party Secretary General Teng
 Hsiao-ping and politburo member
 Peng Chen, the mayor of Peiping
 who traditionally opens the
 ceremonies.   One or both of them
 may be involved in discussions
 with Soviet party officials.
 Former Defense Minister Peng
 Te-huai, apparently still in
 disgrace for resisting party
 leadership in the armed forces
 last year, was also absent.
 Peiping used its holiday
 propaganda, particularly to the
 neutralist states, to rebut crit-
 icism that China is belligerent
 and to make a show of "socialist
 unity," but the Chinese pre-
 occupation with militant struggle
 clearly showed through these
 surface themes.   The absence of
 official delegations from any
 bloc countries except Albania
 underlined the stresses in the
 Sino-Soviet alliance.
 The traditional military
 parade was eliminated from the
 ceremonies, perhaps to help mod-
 erate the impression of Chinese
 bellicosity.   To this end, the
 holiday propaganda also made much
 of the signing of the Sino-
 Burmese boundary treaty and of
 the activities of visiting Bur-
 mese Premier U Nu and the large
 cultural delegation which ac-
 companied him.   (See article
 on page 2Q)
 This peace posture is not
 intended to suggest any lessen-
 ing of Chinese support for the
 "anti-imperialist forces."  Anx-
 ious to demonstrate their support
 of the Algerian rebellion, the
 Chinese devoted considerable
 attention to Algerian rebel
 premier Ferhat Abbas, who was
 in Peiping for the celebrations.
 In the last three weeks,
 Albania has extended its sup-
 port of Chinese Communist po-
 sitions in the Sino-Soviet dis-
 pute, while China has supported
 Albania in the face of growing
 Soviet disapproval of the
 Tirana regime.
 The Albanian leaders have
 used the Chinese Communist Octo-
 ber anniversary celebrations as
 t:e occasion for an explicit re-
 affirmation of their support for
 Peiping's ideological positions
 in the dispute.  Recent Albanian
 statements are  the  most

 outspoken of any that this coun-
 try--which has been out of step
 with Moscow on the Sino-Soviet
 dispute for over a year--has
 yet made.
 Speeches by Deputy Premier
 Abdyl Kellezi, the leader of the
 Albanian delegation to Peiping--
 the only satellite delegation
 sent for the anniversary cele-
 brations--contain unusual praise
 for the Chinese Communist party,
 referring to the "correct line
 ...followed consistently by the
 glorious Chinese Communist
 party led by Comrade Mao Tse-
 tung," and averring that Albania
 will study the Chinese "experi-
 ence ."
 On 4 October, Kellezi stat-
 ed that the Chinese "have always
 marched forward along the cor-
 rect Marxist-Leninist line as
 delineated by the party and Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung."  The Chinese
 reply stated that Albanian-
 Chinese friendship was "moot
 intimate, eternal, and unbreak-
 able."  Party First Secretary
 Enver Hoxha, speaking at a
 Chinese Embassy reception in
 Tirana, labeled the Chinese line
 a '"correct application in a
 creative manner" of Marxism-
 Leninisn--a contradiction to
 Moscow's position.
 Soviet pressure to force
 the Albanians to accept Moscow's
 line may be responsible for the
 "tense" internal situation re-
 ported by the Italian Legation
 in Tirana.   Albanian leaders
 reportedly are "nervous" and bloc
 diplomats in Tirana unusually
 "agitated."  The legation noted
 that the Soviet ambassador to
 Tirana returned to Moscow for
 consultations twice in late
 August.  Moscow's efforts may
 have been reflected in the 9
 September ouster of politburo
 member Liri Belishova and Central
 Auditing Commission chief Koco
 Tasbko,  and the reported removal
 of Rrapo Dervishi as head of the
 Tirana city party organization.
 There have also been an
 unusual number of rumors cir-
 culating in Tirana about further
 personnel changes and about an
 abortive coup attempt.   Soviet
 pressure and Tirana's "nervous-
 ness'" may also be behind the
 evident postponement of the par-
 ty's fourth congress, s lated for
 November.   Specified precongress
 activities--including the pub-
 lication of the new economic
 plan--havenot been carried out.

 Albanians in recent weeks.
 Pravda failed to mention the
 ATGan.zans in its 7 September
 listing of Eastern European
 delegations to the UN General
 Assembly.   Premier Shehu, who
 headed the Albanian contingent
 --Hoxha was the only Eastern
 European party leader whose
 country has UN membership that
 failed to attend--apparently
 got a chilly reception from
 other Eastern European delega-
 tions.   TASS failed to mention
 him in reporting the reception
 on 27 September at the Czech
 UN mission headquarters in New
 York.   According to Western
 press accounts,  Shehu was
 pointedly ignored by  Khru-
 shchev, who refused to shake
 hands ,with him.
 The reasons for Albania's
 support of China is its ideo-
 logical sympathy for the Chinese
 position and the similarity in
 its concern over the "external
 threat"--in the Albanian case,
 from Yugoslavia.   That Albania
 has continued to lend its sup-
 port despite Soviet disapproval
 may be due to the apparently
 high degree of control Hoxha.has
 over the party, his receipt of
 support from China, and aware-
 ness of latent sympathy in other
 bloc countries for the Chinese
 position.
 The Soviet leaders prob-
 ably view Albania's continued
 defiance as a threat to their
 campaign to isolate Peiping and
 to their authority over Eastern
 Europe: ~ and can be expected to      25X1
 make further moves to brin
 Albania   into   line.
 ITALIAN COMMUNISTS AND THE SING-SOVIET DISPUTE
 The Sino-Soviet dispute has
 rovived the' "hard-SOf t't !contro-
 versy that has long plagued
 Italy's Communist party  (PCI)
 --the largest outside the So-
 viet bloc.   Secretary General
 Togliatti can be expected to
 keep the party firmly orientat-
 ed toward Moscow, but oppo-
 sition elements may attempt to
 use the Sino-Soviet dispute to
 undercut the present party
 leaders.   Provincial congresses
 reportedly will be held through
 out Italy this fall to discuss
 "peaceful coexistence between
 diverse systems and the non-
 inevitability of war."
 The Moscow-Peiping contro-
 versy has been having repercus-
 sions for over a year in the
 PCI.   In the early stages of
 the dispute the party press
 was cautious in commenting
 about the ideological rift,
 apparently because it was not
 sure of the Soviet line. J
 At the January 1960 con-
 gress of the Italian party, a.
 number of the revolutionary-
 minded "old guard" were ejected
 from the directorate, and the

 majority in the central commit-
 tee.                    Togliatti and Giorgio
 Amendola, chief of the PCI's
 "organization commission," are
 believed to have engineered the
 removal of revolutionists di-
 recting party committees in
 Milan and Bologna, but were less
 successful in Turin, Genoa,
 and elsewhere.   Leadership of
 most of the smaller federations
 --or local organizations--re-
 mained unchanged.
 On 25 July an intensive
 campaign to clarify "policy
 issues" was apparently begun.
 Meetings were reportedly held
 in all federations to discuss
 the main points of Khrushchev's
 speech at Bucharest criticizing
 the Chinese, and a series of
 articles translated from Rus-
 sian and Chinese was presented
 to illustrate the disagreement.
 On 3 August the party daily
 L'Unita broadly hinted that the
 hh inese Communists fall into
 an "extremist" category, and
 at about the same time the Com-
 munist journal Rinascita sum-
 marized the Soviet press with
 reference to the "full valid-
 ity of the policy of coexist]
 ence and of the line of the
 20th congress."
 Fall. congresses at the
 provincial level are said to
 have been planned to show up the
 Chinese position as anachronistic

 Soviet stand.   Furthermore, the
 Italian party is said to have
 been destroying thousands of
 pamphlets sent by the Chinese
 Embassy in Bern setting forth
 the Chinese thesis.
 The Chinese Communists are
 reported to have reacted by ad-
 vising the PCI not to send its
 usual delegation to this year's
 National Day celebration in Pei-
 ping.   Giuliano Pajetta, head
 of the PCI's foreign section,
 has hinted that the Chinese may
 reduce or even cease their month-
 ly subsidy for Rome's Peiping-
 inspired "studies center for

 For propaganda purposes,
 the PCI will probably play down
 the dispute, continuing; to ad-

 Germany--announced on 30 Septem-

 has made no decision on nego-
 tiating a new agreement with
 East Germany or on making any
 definite   moves,,,         against
 interzonal shipments during the
 remainder of 1960.   At a cabi-
 net meeting on 30 September,
 the possibility was recognized
 that interzonal trade could
 continue after 31 December if
 the East Germans do nothing
 further to aggravate the po-
 litical situation,
 Bonn and West Berlin au-
 thorities are discussing a
 plan designed to strengthen
 West Berlin's position.   Under
 this proposal,  if a new trade
 pact is negotiated, all inter-
 zonal shipments would be routed
 through West Berlin,  thereby
 making it difficult for the
 East Germans to tamper with
 Berlin access routes without
 blocking their own imports,
 including vital iron and steel
 from the Federal Republic.
 Bonn has already decided to set
 up a central Berlin clearing
 house for all interzonal trade
 that may continue after 31
 December in order to eliminate
 individual dealings with East
 German firms.
 As a further move to bol-
 ster West Berlin, Chancellor
 Adenauer has asked the Western
 Allies to consider increasing
 their garrisons in Berlin be-
 cause the nearly 50,000 East
 Berliners and East Germans now
 working in West Berlin are
 capable of causing local dis-
 turbances.   West German offi-
 cials have also publicly
 hinted that continued Communist
 encroachments in Berlin may af-
 fect Soviet - West German ne-
 gotiations scheduled to begin
 on 17 October for the 1961
 trade agreement.   The 1960
 protocol called for trade of
 $180,000,000 each way.
 West Germany is now seeking
 assurance from the Western Allies
 that they will not take advantage
 of the cancellation of the trade
 arrangement to provide the East
 Germans with goods that may be em-
 bargoed.   Representatives of the
 Allies have expressed varying
 degrees of doubt as to the ap-
 propriateness and timing of eco-
 nomic countermeasures to East
 German travel restrictions and
 want a full study made of the
 consequences and effectiveness
 before imposing any economic
 sanctions.   However,  they have
 stated their readiness to co-
 operate in implementing any
 agreed and fully considered
 measures.
 Two West Berlin meetings
 are likely to draw Communist
 propaganda fire.  One is the
 anniversary celebration on 24
 October of the dedication of
 the "Freedom Bell" ten years
 ago;  leading German and Western
 dignitaries will attend.   The
 other meeting,  for which no
 date has been set, will be held
 by the All-German Affairs Com-
 mittee of the Bundestag,  which
 has met many times before in
 West Berlin without arousing
 Communist attacks.
 East German party boss
 Ulbyicht's statement before the
 People's Chamber on 4 October,
 presented in reasonable lan-
 guage, strongly asserts his re-
 gime's "sovereignty" over East
 Berlin,  and demands establish-
 ment of a demilitarized "free
 city" of West Berlin.   It gives
 no indication, however,  of any
 countermeasures to Bonn's can-
 cellation of the trade agree-
 ment.   Ulbricht offered to con-
 duct trade talks with the West
 Germans, but he imposed precon-
 ditions which would be unac-
 ceptable to Bonn,  including re-
 pudiation of the "Hallstein

 breaks diplomatic relations
 with any nonbloc country which
 accords diplomatic recognition
 to East Germany.
 Ulbricht`also set the line
 for bloc propaganda by charging
 that Bonn's action "would sever
 the last link between the two
 German states" and would indi-
 cate that the West Germans are
 not interested in working for
 German reunification.
 Ulbricht's cautious atti-
 tude may indicate that any de-
 cision on specific counter-
 measures must come from Khru-
 shchev, who currently seems
 preoccupied with the affairs of
 the UN General Assembly in New
 York.
 CUBAN DEVELOPMENTS
 Fidel Castro's experience
 at the United Nations has ap-
 parently whetted his appetite
 for international politics and
 strengthened his view of him-
 self as a leader of the people,
 not only of Latin America, but
 of all underdeveloped countries,
 in their "struggle against im-
 perialism."'  The virtually un-
 qualified identification of
 Cuba's foreign policy with that
 of the USSR, evident in Castro's
 UN address, shows signs of be-
 ing played down and the theme
 of Cuba's association with
 world neutralist leaders
 stressed.  On his return to
 Cuba, Castro declared that
 Ghana's Nkrumah may visit Cuba
 late this Year and Nasir may
 visit.next March.
 The Castro regime, which
 has given increasing propaganda
 support to the cause of the
 Algerian rebels,  is apparently
 to act as host later this month
 for a conference sponsored by
 the "Algerian Aid Committee"
 based in Morocco.   The committee
 member representing the Com-
 munists' World Federation of
 Trade Unions  had urged Havana
 as the site of the conference.
 On his departure from New
 York on 28 September, Castro
 declared that he expected to
 return to the United Nations in
 a few weeks,  and New York hotel
 managers reported on 3 October
 that Cubans had been seeking
 reservations for a party headed
 by Fidel or Raul Castro begin-
 ning 23 October.   Castro told
 a Cuban television audience on
 30 September that "we are think-
 ing of presenting a:motion in
 the United Nations against
 racial segregation in the United
 States."
 Cuba's withdrawal on 4 Oc-
 tober of its candidacy for a UN
 Security Council seat;, which it
 had little hope of winning, may
 have been in return for a promise
 by some Latin American delega-
 tions for support for a council
 seat next year.
 Cuban propaganda media con-
 tinue their almost hysterical
 attacks on the United States,
 and some proclaim that the
 embassy's advice tp American
 citizens to leave Cuba fore-
 shadows armed intervention by
 the United States.  The $100,-
 000,000 US Government - owned
 Nicaro nickel plant was seized
 by the workers' militi^ on 1
 October following the delivery
 of a US note announcing closure
 of the plant because of con-
 fiscatory Cuban taxes.   Castro
 responded publicly, saying,"They
 spend a billion dollars on es-
 pionage and 40 billion on arms,
 but now, after exploiting our
 mineral resources for many years,
 they object to paying a 25-
 percent   tax....   Let   the
 plant  be  closed."

 Cuban Government agencies
 appear fearful of the imposi-
 tion of controls on exports to
 Cuba.   According to rumors prev-
 alent in Havana, they are form-
 ing companies in the United
 States to purchase scarce items
 for indirect shipment to Cuba.
 A Bulgarian trade delega-
 tion, headed by the first dep-
 uty foreign trade minister, ar-
 rived in Cuba on 30 September.
 The expected trade agreement
 will be the seventh concluded
 by Cuba this year with bloc
 countries.   The second major
 shipment of military equipment
 from the Soviet Union recently
 arrived, and further shipments
 are expected.
 Che Guevara is to visit
 Moscow in early November for
 the anniversary celebrations of
 the Soviet revolution, and
 Carlos Franqui,  pro-Communist
 director of the government's
 newspaper,  and several other
 newsmen left on 29 September
 to study Soviet journalism.
 Numerous other Cubans now are
 visiting Moscow, Peiping, and
 satellite capitals.   At the
 same 'time,  two East German and
 two Czech professors arrived
 in Cuba in late September as
 guests of the Cuban Government.
 Chou En-lai's message to
 Castro in late September, on
 the occasion of the formal es-
 tablishment of diplomatic re-
 lations between Havana and Pei-
 ping, promised "every possible
 support and assistance to the
 Cuban people, in case of need."
 The "International Volun-
 tary Labor Brigade," which came
 to Cuba under Communist-front
 sponsorship last July to work
 on a Cuban school center,  left
 on 1 October after a send-off
 featuring an address by Guevara.
 Guevara told the youths, who
 were said to have represented
 43 countries,  that "we of this
 generation will see the world
 liberated. completely,  even if
 we have to undergo the greatest
 of sufferings."
 On the domestic scene,
 the armed :forces and militia
 are evidently still suffering
 casualties in the regime's ef-
 forts to suppress guerrilla
 activity in the Escambray Moun-
 tains,   Press sources report
 the launching on 4 October of
 an all-out government drive to
 rout-the guerrillas and the
 capture by government forces
 of an arms cache destined for
 the rebels which  had  been
 dropped by an aircraft from an
 unknown destination.
 On 2 October the Catholic
 archbishop of Santiago,  in
 Oriente Province, issued a pas-
 toral letter constituting the
 strongest anti-Communist state-
 ment yet made by any church of-
 f icial in Cuba.                         25X1
 although the
 church is weak in Cuba,  it is in
 a psychologically favorable posi-
 tion in Oriente to head such a
 campaign because many priests
 there participated in the fight
 against the Batista dictator-
 ship,  and the archbishop himself
 is credited with saving Fidel
 Castro's life in 1953 after
 he had been captured by the
 Batista forces.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 October 1960
 NEW PARTY STRUCTURE IN THE SOVIET ARMED FORCES
 A new decree on the struc-
 ture of party organizations in
 the Soviet military establish-
 ment, recently adopted by the
 party central committee, is
 apparently the first major step
 in implementing a program for
 expanding the regular party
 structure in the army and navy
 --a program discussed and ap-
 proved at the All-Army Confer-
 ence of Secretaries of Primary
 Party Organizations held in
 Moscow from 11 to 14 May.   The
 text of the decree has not been
 published, but commentary on it
 indicates that its provisions
 follow closely the proposals
 advanced to the conference by
 the head of the Army and Navy's
 Political Directorate, Army
 General Golikov.
 No mention has been made
 of the proposal to substitute
 "elective"  party organs for
 political departments in the
 headquarters of military dis-
 tricts,  groups    of   forces,
 fleets,   and military schools,
 nor of the earlier proposal
 to replace the battalion dep-
 uty commander for-political
 affairs with full-time party
 secretaries.   Instead, the po-
 litical departments are charged
 with organizing the preparatory
 work for the transition to the
 new system, with supervising
 the new and largely inexperi-
 enced party secretaries, and
 with "teaching" the battalion
 commanders how  to  work with
 the party organization.
 Basic party units are to
 be established at the battalion
 level instead of at the regimen-
 tal level as heretofore, and the
 staffs of the regimental party
 organizations are to be expanded
 to enable the regimental unit
 to exercise a supervisory role
 over the subordinate party units.
 In addition, subunits of the
 battalion party organizations
 can be established in companies
 or batteries, operating some-
 what like shop subdivisions of
 a factory party organization.
 The ultimate aim  of this
 reorganization apparently is to
 replace the deputy military
 commanders for political affairs
 and the political departments
 in military units with the type
 of party organization found in
 civilian life.   The  decree
 creates conditions favorable
 for increasing the influence of
 the party organizations, but
 further steps will probably de-
 pend on the success the new or-   25X1
 ganizations have in looking
 after party interests in the
 military.
 USSR INTENSIFIES CAMPAIGN AGAINST IDLERS
 Moscow has stepped up its
 drive against "parasites" and
 idlers, and efforts are being
 made to      generate  widespread
 public indignation against all
 forms of undesirable behavior.
 The campaign has spread into
 all social levels, even the

 upper levels of the bureaucracy,
 and includes particularly vehe-
 ment attacks on the tendency to
 acquire private property. Par-
 asitism  in all its varieties
 is characterized as the most
 serious vice of present-day
 Soviet society.
 The renewed offensive was
 opened in late August at a con-
 ference of representatives of
 the police,  legal officials,
 and youth organizations; the
 meeting concluded that "a piti-
 less fight against parasites and
 loafers is a matter of urgency."
 The police and courts were said
 to be in no position to tackle
 the problem unaided.   Every
 member of the general public
 was urged to join the fight.
 Khrushchev has lent his per-
 sonal influence to the campaign
 by invoking Lenin's dictum that
 whoever refuses to work does
 not eat and by stating on 31
 August, "Anybody who thinks he
 can live well and work badly
 is a parasite."
 What constitutes a parasite
 was further spelled out last
 month at the all-union confer-
 ence on ideological problems,
 where heavy blows were demanded
 against those who display "pri-
 vate ownership tendencies, in-
 difference to politics .,,na-
 tionalism, religious prejudices,
 and other forms of bourgeois
 ideology,"
 In past campaigns of this
 sort, the primary target has
 been those who refuse to en-
 gage in "socially useful work"
 and prefer to make a living by
 black-marketing, profiteering,
 or running unauthorized "serv-
 ice" enterprises such as tailor
 shops.   While miscreants of
 this kind are again under heavy
 fire, the central themes of
 this year's propaganda reflect
 the Kremlin's concern over the
 markedly increased tendency of
 the people to acquire material
 wealth.   Young people and en-
 trenched party and government
 bureaucrats are emerging as ma-
 jor offenders; the principal
 cause seems to be the slowly
 growing prosperity of the in-
 dividual citizen.
 In at least one case,  it
 had been explicitly stated that
 the prosperity of youth can lead
 to individualism and "leaving
 the collective."  Some property-
 holding "parasites" have even
 been accused of quoting Darwin
 to the effect that freedom of
 spirit and any kind of creative
 activity presuppose the existence
 of private property.   While such
 manifestations are officially
 attributed to remnants of bour-
 geois ideology, certain press
 writers have begun to wonder--
 at least rhetorically--how it
 happens that a petit-bourgeois
 outlook can grow in a socialist
 society.
 Parasites among Soviet of-
 ficials present an entirely dif-
 ferent problem.   The press has
 severely attacked those who seem
 intent on "entering Communism
 only on condition that they can
 take along their summer houses,
 cars, pensions, and bank ac-
 counts.-  At the same time,
 there have been hints that it
 is difficult to answer the con-
 tention of these officials that
 they have a right to enjoy the
 fruits of their labors on be-
 half of the Soviet cause,
 In late September  the
 Georgian Republic passed an
 antiparasite law similar to
 those adopted in most other
 Soviet republics during the
 past three years.   Under its
 provisions, offenders can be
 sentenced to exile in remote
 areas and to periods of "cor-
 rective labor" ranging from six
 months to two years.   Heavy
 press attention to the problem

 suggests that the way is being
 prepared for the adoption of a
 similar law in the Russian Re-
 public, largest of the Soviet
 republics.       Otherwise,  the cam-
 paign has concentrated                         on
 threats of more severe action
 against parasites and on ap-
 peals for increasing ideolog-
 ical indoctrination of the
 masses in the proper Communist
 outlook.
 Despite the bitterness of
 the attacks on private property
 tendencies,  no ready solution
 has been found, and the regime
 appears unable to overcome the
 increasingly bourgeois outlook
 of the people.
 The Algerian rebels are
 intensifying their efforts both
 in New York and in various West-
 ern capitals to secure backing
 for a UN-conducted referendum
 to settle Algeria's political
 future.   At the same time,
 Morocco and Tunisia are try-
 ing to elicit UN intervention
 in Algeria on the pattern of
 the UN operation in the Congo.
 The rebels apparently are
 encouraged by the two-hour
 meeting on 2 October of the
 rebel delegation in New York
 with Khrushchev and by the fan-
 fare surrounding the  reception
 of rebel premier Ferhat Abbas
 during his two-day stopover in
 Moscow en route to Peiping.
 Khrushchev's public statement
 that the Algerian government
 "exists" and that French-
 Algerian talks at Melun last
 June were De Gaulle's "tacit
 recognition" of the rebel
 regime indicates a shift in
 Soviet policy from the cautious
 neutral position adopted in mid-
 1959 to a more open pro-rebel
 stand.
 Rebel claims that the
 Soviet UN delegation offered
 official recognition to the
 provisional Algerian government
 probably are exaggerated,  how-
 ever.   Although Soviet leaders
 appear less concerned now than
 in the past about avoiding
 offense to France, the USSR
 and European satellites seem
 likely to continue to with-
 hold diplomatic recognition at
 least until after Khrushchev's
 expected call for new East-
 West talks on Berlin and Germany
 early next year.
 Abbas' ostentatious visit
 to Peiping probably was designed
 primarily to impress Western
 governments that the rebels were
 in earnest when they stated they
 would accept aid "wherever it
 can be found."  He left there
 on 6 October after a week's
 stay, with promises of "material
 and moral support in the
 Algerian war for independence."
 Although he may have secured
 additional financial assistance,
 new arms commitments from
 Communist China seem unlikely,
 inasmuch as previous armament
 commitments apparently have not
 been delivered.
 Tunisia and Morocco appear
 to be vying with each other to
 support  rebel efforts to
 involve the UN more directly in
 an Algerian solution, andthey'look
 on the UN's operations in the
 Congo as a useful precedent.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 October 1960
 Bourguiba has let it be
 known that he is weighing the
 merits of an Algerian-proposed
 Tunisian-Algerian "union" to
 which he referred cryptically
 on 3 September
 e    gerza.ns,  on   ie o  er
 hand, are said to envisage
 implementation of the union as
 a means to provoke French
 military retaliation against
 Tunisia, which could then demand
 UN intervention.
 Morocco's acting deputy
 premier, Abdelkhalek-  Torres, has
 threatened to order Moroccan
 armed forces to retaliate, should
 the French.troops based in
 Algeria continue to violate
 Moroccan territory.    Two appar-
 ently minor incidents in late
 September have been widely ex-
 ploited by the Moroccan. press.
 Such a counterattack, which is
 said to have the approval of the
 King, who is 'Vacationing in
 Switzerland, would also be de-
 signed to justify a call for UN
 intervention,
 Meanwhile, in France, the
 predominantly Moslem study com-
 missions, which were apparently
 established with an eye to the
 forthcoming UN debate, are faith-
 fully, but with questionable
 utility, studying local Algerian
 problems.   The government also
 has begun to crack down on both
 leftist and rightist domestic
 criticism of its Algerian policy.
 It appears unlikely that
 De Gaulle will make any signifi-
 cant new move before the UN de-
 bate--now expected in mid  or
 late November--although his Octo-
 ber visits to the provinces and
 possibly also to Algeria will
 provide him opportunities to
 speak out on the problem. Re-
