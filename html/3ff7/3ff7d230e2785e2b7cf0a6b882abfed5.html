 Chapter 28
 Recommendations
 It is the conclusion of these Committees that the Iran-
 Contra Affair resulted from the failure of individuals
 to observe the law, not from deficiencies in existing
 law or in our system of governance. This is an impor-
 tant lesson to be learned from these investigations
 because it points to the fundamental soundness of our
 constitutional processes.
 Thus,  the  principal  recommendations emerging
 from the investigation are not for new laws but for a
 renewal of the commitment to constitutional govern-
 ment and sound processes of decisionmaking.
 The President must "take care" that the laws be
 faithfully executed. This is both a moral and legal
 responsibility.
 Government officials must observe the law, even
 when they disagree with it.
 Decisionmaking processes in foreign policy matters,
 including covert action, must provide for careful con-
 sideration of all options and their consequences. Op-
 posing views must be weighed, not ignored. Unsound
 processes, in which participants cannot even agree on
 what was decided (as in the case of the initial Iranian
 arms sale) produce unsound decisions.
 Congress' role in foreign policy must be recog-
 nized, not dismissed, if the benefit of its counsel is to
 be realized and i(public support is to be secured and
 maintained.
 The Administration must not lie to Congress about
 what it is doing. Congress is the partner, not the
 adversary of the executive branch, in the formulation
 of policy.
 Excessive secrecy in the making of important
 policy decisions is profoundly antidemocratic and
 rarely promotes sound policy decisions.
 These recommendations are not remarkable. They
 embody the principles on which this country's success
 has been based for 200 years. What is remarkable is
 that they were violated so freely and so repeatedly in
 the Iran-Contra Affair.
 Congress cannot legislate good judgment, honesty,
 or fidelity to law. But there are some changes in law,
 particularly relating to oversight of covert operations,
 that would make our processes function better in the
 future. They are set forth below:
 1. Findings: Timely Notice
 The Committees recommend that Section 501 of
 the National Security Act be amended to. require that
 Congress be notified prior to the commencement of a
 covert action except in certain rare instances and in
 no event later than 48 hours after a Finding is ap-
 proved. This recommendation is designed to assure
 timely notification to Congress of covert operations.
 Congress was never notified of the Iranian arms
 sales, in spite of the existence of a statute requiring
 prior notice to Congress of all covert actions, or, in
 rare situations, notice "in a timely fashion." The Ad-
 ministration has reasoned that the risks of leaks justi-
 fied delaying notice to Congress until after the covert
 action was over, and claims that notice after the
 action is over constitutes notice "in a timely fashion."
 This reasoning defeats the purpose of the law.
 2. Written Findings
 The Committees recommend legislation requiring
 that all covert action Findings be in writing and per-
 sonally signed by the President. Similarly, the Com-
 mittees recommend legislation that requires that the
 Finding be signed prior to _the commencement of the
 covert action, unless the press of time prevents it, in
 which case it must be signed within 48 hours of
 approval by the President.
 The legislation should prohibit retroactive Findings.
 The legal concept of ratification, which commonly
 arises in commercial law, is inconsistent with the ra-
 tionale of Findings, which is to require Presidential
 approval before any covert action is initiated.
 The existing law does not require explicitly that a
 Presidential Finding approving a covert operation be
 in writing, although executive, orders signed by both
 Presidents Carter and Reagan required that they be in
 writing. Despite this requirement, a PROF note by
 McFarlane suggested that the initial arms sales to Iran
 were approved by a "mental finding," and there is
 conflicting testimony about whether certain actions
 were orally approved by the President. The require-
 ment of a written Finding will remove such uncer-
 tainties in the future.

 Chapter 28
 3. Disclosure of Written Findings to Congress
 The Committees recommend legislation requiring
 that copies of all signed written Findings be sent to
 the Congressional Intelligence Committees.
 Since existing law does not require that covert
 action Findings be in writing, there currently is no
 requirement that written Findings be disclosed to
 Congress. The existing practice has been not to pro-
 vide the Intelligence Committees with a signed writ-
 ten Finding.
 4. Findings: Agencies Covered
 The Committees recommend that a Finding by the
 President should be required before a covert action is
 commenced by any department, agency, or entity of
 the United States Government regardless of what
 source of funds is used.
 The existing statutes require a Presidential Finding
 before a covert action is conducted only if the covert
 action uses appropriated funds and is conducted by
 the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). By executive
 order  and  National  Security  Decision  Directive
 (NSDD), Presidential Findings are required before
 covert actions may be conducted by any agency.
 Nonetheless, both  the National  Security Council
 (NSC) and the Drug Enforcement Administration
 (DEA) became engaged in covert actions without
 Presidential Findings fully authorizing their involve-
 ment.
 The executive order requirement is sound. In the
 Committees'  judgment,  Presidential  Findings  for
 covert actions conducted by any agency should be
 required by law. Experience suggests that Presidential
 accountability, as mandated by the Finding require-
 ment, is equally as important in the case of covert
 actions conducted by agencies other than the CIA.
 The Committees also believe the Finding require-
 ment should apply regardless of the source of funding
 for the covert action.
 are matters of considerable importance if Congress is
 to fulfill its oversight responsibilities adequately.
 The record of the Iran-Contra investigation reflects
 repeated efforts by the executive branch to obtain
 funds from third countries for covert operations and
 for other causes the Administration supports.
 These actions raise concerns of two kinds. First,
 there is a risk that foreign countries will expect some-
 thing in return. Second, in an extreme case such as
 that presented by the record of these hearings, the use
 of third country or private funds threatens to circum-
 vent Congress' exclusive power of the purse.
 6. Findings: The Attorney General
 The Committees recommend that the Attorney
 General be provided with a copy of all proposed
 Findings for purposes of legal review.
 The first Iranian arms Finding of December 5,
 1985, was not reviewed by the Attorney General. The
 Attorney General did give oral advice on the January
 17 Finding but did not do the analysis or research
 that a written opinion would have entailed. The Presi-
 dent, the intelligence community, and Congress are
 entitled to a review by the country's chief legal offi-
 cer to ensure that planned covert operations are
 lawful.
 7. Findings: Presidential Reporting
 The Committees recommend that consistent with
 the concepts of accountability inherent in the Finding
 process, the obligtion to report covert action Findings
 should be placed on the President.
 Under current law, it is the head of the intelligence
 entity involved which has the obligation to report to
 Congress on covert action. Yet policy choices are
 inherently part of the Findings process and it is the
 President  who  must  authorize  covert  operations
 through the signing of Findings.
 5. Findings: Identifying Participants
 The Committees recommend legislation requiring
 that each Finding should specify each and every de-
 partment, agency, or entity of the United States Gov-
 ernment authorized to fund or otherwise participate in
 any way in any covert action and whether any third
 party, including any foreign country, will be used in
 carrying out or providing funds for the covert action.
 The Congress should be informed of the identities of
 such third parties in an appropriate fashion.
 Current law does not require a Finding to state
 what agencies, third parties, or countries will be uti-
 lized in conducting a covert action. The Iran-Contra
 investigation demonstrates that disclosure of what
 U.S. agencies (such as the NSC), private parties, or
 foreign countries, will be engaged in covert actions
 8. Recertification of Findings
 The Committees recommend that each Finding
 shall cease to be operative after one year unless the
 President certifies that the Finding is still in the na-
 tional interest. The executive branch and the Intelli-
 gence Committees should conduct frequent periodic
 reviews of all covert operations.
 9. Covert Actions Carried Out by Other Countries
 The Committees believe that the definition of
 covert action should be changed so that it includes a
 request by an agency of the United Sttes to a foreign
 country or a private citizen to conduct a covert
 action on behalf of the United States.

 Chapter 28
 10. Reporting Covert Arms Transfers
 The Committees recommend that the law regulat-
 ing the reporting of covert arms transfers be changed
 to require notice to Congress on any covert shipment
 of arms where the transfer is valued at more than $1
 million.
 Under current law, the Administration must report
 covert arms transfers involving any single item valued
 at more than $1 million. Since a TOW or a HAWK
 missile is individually worth less than $1 million, this
 reporting requirement did not apply to the Iranian
 arms sales even though two shipments involved $10
 million in arms or more. It is the value of a transfer,
 not the value of each component of a transfer, that
 matters.
 11. NSC Operational Activities
 The Committees recommend that the members and
 staff of the NSC not engage in covert actions.
 By statute the NSC was created to provide advice
 to the President on national security matters. But
 there is no express statutory prohibition on the NSC
 engaging in operational intelligence activities.
 12. NSC Reporting to Congress
 The Committees recommend legislation requiring
 that the President report to Congress periodically on
 the organization, size, function, and procedures of the
 NSC staff.
 Such a report should include a list of duties for
 each NSC staff position from the National Security
 Adviser on dov :1, and whether incumbents have been
 detailed from a particular department or agency. It
 should include a description of the President's guide-
 lines and other instructions to the NSC, the National
 Security Adviser, and NSC staff for their activities.
 Particular attention should be paid to the number and
 tenure of uniformed military personnel assigned to the
 NSC.
 13. Privatization
 The Committees recommend a strict accounting of
 all U.S. Government funds managed by private citi-
 zens during the course of a covert action.
 The record of the Iran-Contra hearings reflects use
 of private parties to conduct diplomatic missions and
 covert actions. Private parties can be of considerable
 use to the Government in both types of ventures and
 their use should be permitted. However, the record
 reflects that funds generated during a covert action
 are subject to abuse in the hands of a private citizen
 involved in conducting a covert action.
 14. Preservation of Presidential Documents
 The Committees recommend that the Presidential
 Records Act be reviewed to determine how it can be
 made more effective. Possible improvements include
 the establishment of a system of consultation with the
 Archivist of the United States to ensure complete
 compliance with the Act, the creation of a program
 of education of affected staff as to the Act's provi-
 sions, and the attachment of criminal penalties for
 violations of the Act.
 During the Iran-Contra hearings, Oliver North,
 John Poindexter, Fawn Hall, and others admitted to
 having altered and destroyed key documents relating
 to their activities. Such actions constitute violations of
 the Presidential Records Act, which was intended to
 ensure the preservation of documents of historical
 value that were generated by the Chief Executive and
 his immediate staff.
 15. CIA Inspector General and General Zounsel
 The Committees recommend that a system be de-
 veloped so that the CIA has an independent statutory
 Inspector General confirmed by the Senate, like the
 Inspectors General of other agencies, and that the
 General Counsel of the CIA be confirmed by the
 Senate.
 The CIA's internal investigation of the Iran-Contra
 Affair-conducted by the Office of the Inspector
 General-paralleled those of the Intelligence Commit-
 tees and then the Iran Committees. It contributed to,
 and cooperated with, the Tower Board. Yet, the
 Office of the Inspector General appears not to have
 had the manpower, resources or tenacity to acquire
 key facts uncovered by the other investigations.
 The Committees also believe the General Counsel
 plays an important role in these matters and accord-
 ingly should be confirmed by the Senate.
 16. Foreign Bank Records Treaties
 The Committees recommend that treaties be negoti-
 ated with foreign countries whose banks are used to
 conceal financial transactions by U.S. citizens, and
 that these treaties covering foreign bank records
 specify that Congress, not just the Department of
 Justice, has the right to request, to receive, and to
 utilize such records.
 Many of the important records relating to the Iran-
 Contra Affair were generated by foreign banks that
 were used by the Enterprise for the covert arms sales
 to Iran and the Contra supply operation. The -Inde-
 pendent Counsel has sought access to these Swiss
 bank records pursuant to a treaty with Switzerland.
 But the Independent Counsel and the Justice Depart-
 ment do not believe the Congressional Committees
 are entitled under the terms of the treaty to receive
 these records. New treaties should assure Congress of
 access to such records and should streamline the
 process for obtaining them. The Independent Counsel
 had not received all of the Swiss bank records after 9
 months of waiting. Given the use of foreign banks by
 drug dealers, terrorists, and others involved in unlaw-

 ful activity, it is more essential than ever that binding
 secrecy not be a shield for serious criminal conduct.
 17. National Security Council
 The Committees recommend that all statutory
 members of the National Security Council should be
 informed of Findings.
 18. Findings Cannot Supercede Law
 The Committees recommend legislation affirming
 what the Committees believe to be the existing law:
 that a Finding cannot be used by the President or any
 member of the executive branch to authorize an
 action inconsistent with, or contrary to, any statute of
 the United States.
 19. Improving Consistency In Dealing with
 Security Breaches
 The Committees recommend that consistent meth-
 ods of dealing with leaks of classified information by
 government officials be developed.
 The record of these hearings is replete with expres-
 sions of concern by executive branch officials over
 the problem of unauthorized handling and disclosure
 of classified information. The record is also replete
 with evidence that high NSC officials breached secu-
 rity regulations and disclosed classified documents to
 unauthorized persons when it suited their purposes.
 Yet no steps have been taken tc withdraw or even
 review clearances of such people.
 20. Review of Congressional Contempt Statutes
 The Committees recommend that the Congressional
 contempt statutes be reviewed by the appropriate
 Committees.
 There is a need, in CongressioruA investigations, for
 a swift and sure method of compelling compliance
 with Congressional orders for production of docu-
 ments and the obtaining of testimony. These investiga-
 tions raised questions about the adequacy of existing
 statutes.
 In addition, new legislation should make clear that
 a Congressional deposition, including one conducted
 by staff, is a "proceeding" at which testimony may be
 compelled under the immunity statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec-
 tion 6001 et. seq.
 21. Review of Special Compartmented
 Operations Within the Department of Defense
 The Committees recommend that oversight by In-
 telligence and Armed Services Committees of Con-
 gress of special compartmented operations within the
 Department of Defense be strengthened to include
 systematic and comprehensive review of all such pro-
 grams.
 22. Review of Weapons Transfers by Chairman
 of Joint Chiefs of Staff
 The Committees recommend that the President
 issue an order requiring that the Chairman of the
 Joint Chiefs of Staff should be consulted prior to any
 transfer of arms by the United States for purposes of
 presenting his views as to the potential impact on the
 military balance and on the readiness of United States
 forces.
 23. National Security Adviser
 The Committees recommend that Presidents adopt
 as a matter of policy the principle that the National
 Security Adviser to the President of the United States
 should not be an active military officer and that there
 should be a limit placed on the tour of military offi-
 cers assigned to the staff of the National Security
 Council.
 24. Intelligence Oversight Board
 The Committees recommend that the Intelligence
 Oversight Board be revitalized and strengthened.
 25. Review of Other Laws
 The Committees suggest that appropriate standing
 Committees review certain laws for possible changes:
 a. Should restrictions on sales of arms to certain
 countries under the Arms Export Control Act
 ("AECA") and other statutes governing overt
 sales be made applicable to covert sales?
 b. Should the Hostage Act be repealed or amend-
 ed?
 c. Should enforcement or monitoring provisions
 be added to the AECA so that we better control
 retransfers of U.S.-manufactured arms by coun-
 tries to whom we sell them?
 26. Recommendations for Congress
 a. The Committees recommend that the oversight
 capabilities  of  the  Intelligence  Committees  be
 strengthened by acquisition of an audit staff.
 b. The Committees recommend that the appropriate
 oversight committees conduct review of sole-source
 contracts for potential abuse.
 c. The Committees recommend that uniform proce-
 dures be developed to ensure that classified informa-
 tion is handled in a secure manner and that such
 procedures should include clear and strengthened
 sanctions for unauthorized disclosure of national secu-
 rity secrets or classified information which shall be
 strictly enforced.

 27. Joint Intelligence Committee
 The Committees recommend against consolidating
 the separate House and Senate Intelligence Commit-
 tees into a single joint committee. We believe that
 such consolidation would inevitably erode Congress'
 ability to perform its oversight function in connection
 with intelligence activities and covert operations.
 Congress has structured its system for effective over-
 sight in this area to meet the need for secrecy that
 necessarily accompanies intelligence activities and the
 creation of a single oversight committee would simply
 add nothing to this effort.

 Recommendations
 The majority report reaches the conclusion, accurate-
 ly in our opinion, that the underlying cause of the
 Iran-Contra Affair had to do with people rather than
 with laws.* Despite this laudable premise, the majori-
 ty goes on to offer no fewer than 27 recommenda-
 tions, most involving legislation and several of them
 multifaceted. Some of the recommendations unfortu-
 nately betray Congress' role in the legislative-execu-
 tive branch struggle by proposing needlessly detailed
 rules for the organization of the executive branch. At
 the same time, the majority recommendations barely
 touch the problem of leaks, and say nothing at all, to
 no one's surprise, about Congress' misuse of massive
 continuing appropriations resolutions to conduct for-
 eign policy.
 We do not intend here to give a detailed critique of
 the majority recommendations. We do believe that
 requiring the President to notify Congress of all
 covert operations within 48 hours, without an-, excep-
 tions, would be both unconstitutional and u: wise.**
 Many of the remaining recommendations seen to us
 to be unconscionably meddlesome. No good reasons
 are offered for prohibiting military officers, such as
 General Powell, from being National Security Advis-
 er. No good reasons are offered for having the Na-
 tional Security Council produce regular staff rosters
 for Congress. And so forth, and so on. It all strikes as
 more of the same: an attempt to achieve grant policy
 results by picking away at the details.              -
 In the spirit of offering recommendations. however,
 we are pleased to present some of our own.
 Recommendation 1: Joint Intelligence
 Committee
 Congress should replace its Senate and House Select
 Committees on Intelligence with a joint committee.
 Congress has realized that limiting the number of
 people with access to sensitive information can help
 protect the information's security. The House and
 Senate took worthwhile first steps to limit the number
 of Members and staff engaged in intelligence over-
 sight by establishing Select Committees on Intelli-

 " See the Minorite Report, Chapter 4 at 477-478, and Chapter 9 at
 543.545.
 gence. Unfortunately, as we have seen, security still is
 not tight enough. The time has now come, therefore,
 for taking the next logical steps.
 Given the national security stakes involved, Con-
 gress and the Administration must find a remedy for
 restoring mutual trust. One major step in that direc-
 tion can be taken by merging the existing "House and
 Senate intelligence committees into a joint committee,
 along the lines of legislation (H.J. Res. 48) sponsored
 by Representative Henry Hyde and a bipartisan group
 of 135 cosponsors (see Appendix Q. Such a commit-
 tee need not have the 32 Members (plus four ex-
 officio) and 55 staff now needed for two separate
 committees. Fewer Members, supported by a small
 staff of apolitical professionals, could make up the
 single committee. In recognition of political reality,
 the  majority-party  membership from each  House
 would have a one vote edge.
 A joint intelligence panel would drastically dimin-
 ish the opportunities for partisan posturing and sub-
 stantially reduce the number of individuals with
 access to classified and sensitive information. This
 would not only minimize the risk of damaging unau-
 thorized disclosures but would also significantly in-
 crease the likelihood of identifying leak sources-
 something that rarely occurs now because so many
 people are in the "intelligence information loop." Fur-
 thermore. with the possibility of discovery so much
 greater. potential leakers would be strongly deterred
 from unauthorized disclosures.
 To achieve both efficiency and secrecy in congres-
 sional consideration of intelligence matters, a Joint
 Intelligence Committee must have legislative as well
 as oversight jurisdiction. Otherwise, the two Houses
 would not give the Joint Committee the deference the
 two existing intelligence committees enjoy. Neither
 would the intelligence agencies have the budget-based
 incentives to cooperate with the Joint Committee as
 they have now with the two select committees. Inad-
 equate jurisdiction might also prompt the various
 committees in each House with historical interests in
 intelligence to reassert themselves. That could trigger
 increased fractionalization of the congressional over-
 sight  process,  with  the  concomitant  proliferation
 within the Congress of access to sensitive intelligence
 information.

 Chapter 14
 Recommendation 2: Oath and Strict
 Penalties for Congress.
 To improve security, the Joint Intelligence Committee (or
 the present House and Senate committees) should adopt
 a secrecy oath with stiff penalties for its violation.
 Creating a joint committee will not by itself guaran-
 tee the security of intelligence information. Also es-
 sential is committee self-discipline. Earlier, we pointed
 out how the reputations of the Senate and House
 Intelligence Committees have been sullied by leaks
 from Members or staff. As the importance of congres-
 sional oversight, and the reputation for leaking, both
 grow, foreign intelligence agencies are discouraged
 from unguarded cooperation with the United States.
 Change is therefore urgent both to stanch the flow of
 leaks and to symbolize to foreign countries that Con-
 gress is serious about preserving the confidentiality of
 secrets.
 One significant change that would help further both
 goals would be to require an oath of secrecy for all
 Members and staff of the intelligence committees.
 Such an oath would not be an American novelty. As
 we have already noted, the Continental Congress'
 Committee on Secret Correspondence required all of
 its members and employees to pledge not to divulge,
 directly or indirectly, any information that required
 secrecy.
 The proposed oath should read: "I do solemnly
 swear (or affirm) that I will not directly or indirectly
 disclose to any unauthorized person any information
 received in the course of my duties on the [Senate,
 House or Joint] Intelligence Committee except with
 the formal approval of the Committee or Congress."
 The  Committee  Rules  should  be  amended  to
 compel permanent expulsion from the committee of
 any member or staff person who violates his or her
 oath. While proceedings remain pending. the accused
 would be denied access to classified information. The
 rules of the House and Senate should also be amended
 to provide that the Intelligence Committee would be
 authorized to refer cases involving the unauthorized
 disclosure of classified information to the Ethics Com-
 mittees. The rules should make it clear that the Ethics
 Committees may recommend appropriate sanctions.
 up to and including expulsion from Congress.
 This approach is well within the Constitution's ex-
 pulsion power and the power of each House to set
 rules for its own proceedings. The power of each
 House of Congress to expel Members for misbehavior
 by two-thirds vote is virtually uncircumscribed.1 His-
 torically, fifteen Senators and four Representatives
 have been expelled. Fourteen of the Senators were
 expelled for supporting the Confederate secession.
 The fifteenth, Senator Blount. was for conspiring with
 Indian tribes to attack Spanish Florida and Louisiana.
 The House and Senate also have considered and re-
 fused expulsion on twenty-four occasions for charges
 as varied as corruption, disloyalty, Mormonism, trea-
 sonable utterances, dueling, and attacking other Mem-
 bers of Congress. Expulsion decisions of Congress are
 probably beyond judicial review.2
 Any set of recommendations that limits itself to
 Congress would not be adequate to respond to the
 problem of leaks. Therefore, we recommend a more
 balanced approach that would stiffen the penalties for
 others who participate in this activity.
 Recommendation 3: Strengthening
 Sanctions
 Sanctions against disclosing national security secrets or
 classified information should be strengthened.
 Current federal law contains many provisions pro-
 hibiting the disclosure of classified information, but
 each of the existing provisions has loopholes or other
 difficulties that make them hard to apply. The section
 that covers the broadest spectrum of ? information.
 "classified information," only prohibits knowing, un-
 authorized communication to a foreign agent or
 member of a specified Communist organization.3
 Another set of provisions contains no such limit on
 the recipient of the information, but applies only to
 information related to the national defense.4 For some
 specified  information,  unauthorized  disclosure  or
 transmission is criminal under any circumstances.s
 The transmission of other "information relating to the
 national defense" to an unauthorized person is also
 illegal if a person has reason to believe the informa-
 tion would be used to injure the United States or to
 benefit a foreign nation. The problem with these pro-
 visions is that they cover only "information relating
 to the national defense" rather than the full range of
 national security information whose secrecy the gov-
 ernment has a legitimate reason to protect.6
 A third set of provisions in current law is limited to
 nuclear weapons production.' A fourth is limited to
 information about ciphers or communications intelli-
 gence.8 This is the law that the National Security
 Agency Director, General William E. Odom, believes
 should he applied more vigorously against both feder-
 al employees and the press.*
 *The following is quoted from Moll) Moore. "Prosecution of
 Media for Leaks Urged." The Washington Post. Sept. 3, 1987, p.
 A4:
 "I don't want to blame any particular area for leaking." said
 Odom, who added, "There's leaking from Congress . . . there's
 more leaking in the administration because it's bigger. I'm just stuck
 with the consequences of it.
 Leaks  have  damaged  the  [communications  intelligence]
 system more in the past three to four years than in a long. long
 time.". . . .
 Odom said he has encouraged the administration to use an
 obscure law that prohibits disclosures of "communications intelli-
 gence." Odom said he has referred several cases involving news
 leaks to the Justice Department since 1985 but said the department
 has declined to prosecute any of them. The department said it has
 not prosecuted any so far. . . .

 Chapter 14
 Finally, a fifth provision-also limited in the infor-
 mation it protects-makes illegal the disclosure of
 agents' identities. This law is also restricted to disclo-
 sures by someone who (a) has authorized access to
 the identity from classified information or (b) is en-
 gaged in a "pattern of activities intended to identify
 and expose covert agents" with reason to believe the
 publicity would impair the foreign intelligence activi-
 ties of the United States." The latter limitation means
 that the agent disclosure law does not cover most
 normal press disclosures, such as the ones we men-
 tioned earlier about reports based on these commit-
 tees' work, because they are not normally part of a
 pattern or practice of identifying covert agents.
 In order to close these loopholes, Rep. Bill McCol-
 lum has introduced a bill (H.R. 3066) co-sponsored by
 all the other Republican members of the House Iran
 Committee. The bill is limited to current and past
 federal employees in any branch of government. For
 these people, the bill would make it a felony know-
 ingly to disclose classified information or material
 (not just specific national defense information) to any
 unauthorized person, whatever the intent.
 Another  approach  that  would  supplement  the
 McCollum bill would be to introduce substantial civil
 penalties for the knowing disclosure of classified in-
 formation to any unauthorized person. The penalties
 might range from administrative censure to a perma-
 nent ban on federal employment and a fine of $10,000.
 The advantage of giving the Justice Department the
 option of using a civil statute would be (a) that the
 standard for proof would be the preponderance c'-
 evidence rather than proof beyond a reasonable doub
 and (b) the law could stipulate that contested viola-
 -Generally, when I'm with a group of journalists. I can
 usuall     see two or three people who fall in the category of those
 who probably could be successfully prosecuted." Odom told th
 reporters
 The following material, from the same press briefing, is from
 Norman Black. "Gen. Odom blames leaks for 'deadly' intelligence
 loss." Associated  Press dispatch published in The Washingtor
 Times. Sept 3. 1987. pp. 1. 12
 Asked to provide examples. Gen. Odom said he didn't want
 to get specific right now and compound the things. but a number
 of sources have dried up in some areas which you are all familiar
 with. in the past year or tHwo.
 A number of years ago there was a case that had to do with
 a Damascus communication. . . . It was a leak. It attributed this
 thing to an intercept. And the source dried up immediately." Gen.
 Odom said.
 Asked then about Libya. he replied. "Libya. sure. Just deadly
 losses."
 tions should be heard in secret, without a jury. These
 procedures should not encounter constitutional diffi-
 culties in light of the Supreme Court's broad endorse-
 ment of controls on the disclosure of classified infor-
 mation in Snepp v. US. 10
 Recommendation 4: Gang of Four
 Permit the President to notify the "Gang of Four" in-
 stead of the "Gang of Eight" in special circumstances.
 Representative Broomfield has introduced a bill
 that, among other things, would permit the President
 on extremely sensitive matters to notify only the
 Speaker of the House, House Minority Leader, Senate
 Majority Leader and Senate Minority Leader. Under
 current law, limited notification means notification of
 these four plus the chairmen and ranking minority
 members of the two intelligence committees. On the
 principal that notifying fewer people is better in ex-
 tremely sensistive situations, we would be inclined to
 support legislation along these lines that would ratify
 what has already come to be an informal occasional
 practice.
 Recommendation 5: Restore Presidential
 Power to Withstand Foreign Policy by
 Continuing Resolution
 Require Congress to divide continuing resolutions into
 separate appropriations bills and give the President an
 item veto for foreign policy limitation amendments on
 appropriations bills.
 The way Congress made foreign policy through the
 Boland Amendment is all too normal a way of doing
 business. Congress uses end of the year continuing
 resolutions to force its way on large matters and
 small, presenting the President with a package that
 forces him to choose between closing down the Gov-
 ernment or capitulating. Congress should give the
 President an opportunity to address the major differ-
 ences between himself and the Congress cleanly, in-
 stead of combining them with unrelated subjects. To
 restore the Presidency to the position it held just a
 few Administrations ago, Congress. should exercise
 the self-discipline to split continuing resolutions into
 separate appropriation bills and present each of them
 individually to the President for his signature or veto.
 Even better would be a line-item veto that would
 permit the President to force Congress to an override
 vote without jeopardizing funding for the whole gov-
 ernment.
